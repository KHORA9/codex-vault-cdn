Thanks to our trade relations\r\nwith the Antilles, and the number of meritorious books that have\r\nbeen written about them during the last few decades, our knowledge\r\nof the West Indies is fairly complete and satisfactory. The same,\r\nhowever, cannot be said of the two extensive republics just south of\r\nus. Outside of their capitals and a few of their coast towns, they\r\nare rarely visited, and as a consequence, the most erroneous ideas\r\nprevail regarding them. Vast regions in both republics are now less\r\nknown than they were three centuries ago, while there are certain\r\nsections about which our knowledge is as limited as it is regarding\r\nthe least explored portions of darkest Africa.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to account for the prevailing ignorance regarding\r\nthe parts of the New Hemisphere that first claimed the attention of\r\ndiscoverers and explorers. Suffice it to state that, paradoxical as\r\nit may seem, it is, nevertheless, a fact.\r\n\r\nWhen we recollect that the lands in question were not only the\r\nfirst discovered but that they were also witnesses of the marvelous\r\nachievements of some of the most renowned of the conquistadores,\r\nour surprise becomes doubly great that our information respecting\r\nthem is so meager and confined almost exclusively to those who make\r\na special study of things South American.\r\n\r\nNever, perhaps, in the history of our race was the spirit of\r\nadventure so generally diffused as it was at the dawn of the sixteenth\r\ncentury--just after the epoch-making discoveries of Columbus and his\r\nhardy followers. It was like the spirit that animated the Crusaders\r\nwhen they started on their long march to recover the Holy Sepulchre\r\nfrom the possession of the Moslem. It was, indeed, in many of its\r\naspects, a revival of the age of chivalry. The Sea of Darkness had at\r\nlast been successfully crossed. That ocean of legend and mystery with\r\nits enchanted islands inhabited by witches and gnomes and griffins\r\nhad been explored. And that strange island of Satanaxio, \"the island\r\nof the hand of Satan,\" where the Evil One was \"supposed once a day to\r\nthrust forth a gigantic hand from the ocean to grasp a number of the\r\ninhabitants\" was consigned to the limbo of mediæval superstitions. A\r\nnew world was revealed to the astonished Spaniards. Every animal,\r\ntree, plant seemed new to them and often entirely different from\r\nanything the Old World could show. There was, too, a new race of men,\r\nwith strange manners and customs--men who told them of a Fountain of\r\nYouth, of regions of pearls and precious stones, of cities and palaces\r\nof gold in the lofty plateau and in the heart of the wilderness.\r\n\r\nThose who first came to the New World acted as if they were\r\nin a land of enchantment and were prepared to believe any tale,\r\nhowever preposterous, that appealed to their lust of gold or love of\r\nadventure. No enterprise was too difficult for them, no hardship too\r\ngreat. Neither trackless forests, nor miasmatic climates, nor ruthless\r\nsavages could deter them from their quest of treasure, or quench their\r\nthirst for glory and emolument. Hence those extraordinary expeditions\r\nin search of El Dorado,--that El Dorado which Quesada hoped to find in\r\nCundinamarca, his brother in Casanare, Orsua among the Omaguas on the\r\nAmazon, Philipp von Hutten in the regions of the Meta and the Guaviare,\r\nand Cesar and Belalcazar in the territories drained by the Cauca and\r\nthe Magdalena,--in which were combined the extravagant performances of\r\na Don Quixote with the feats of prowess of a Rodrigo Diaz. The spirit\r\nof knight-errantry seemed to revive and to bring with it an age of\r\nromance that for hardihood of enterprise and variety of incident\r\nsurpassed any period that had preceded it. The feats of individual\r\nprowess were as brilliant as the success of Spanish arms was pronounced\r\nand far-reaching. It was an age of epics, of poetry in action.\r\n\r\nLord Macaulay, in his essay on Lord Clive, writes, \"We have always\r\nthought it strange that, while the history of the Spanish empire in\r\nAmerica is familiarly known to all the nations of Europe, the great\r\nactions of our countrymen in the East should, even among ourselves,\r\nexcite little interest.\"\r\n\r\nOne reason for the difference noted was the absence, in the English\r\nconquest of India, of those romantic and picturesque elements that\r\nso distinguished the achievements of the conquistadores in the New\r\nWorld, and which so fascinated Leo X, that he sat up all night to\r\nread the Decades of Peter Martyr. \"The picturesque descriptions,\"\r\ndeclares Theodore Irving, in his Conquest of Florida, \"of steel-clad\r\ncavaliers with lance and helmet and prancing steed, glittering through\r\nthe wildernesses of Florida, Georgia, Alabama and the prairies of\r\nthe Far West, would seem to us fictions of romance, did they not\r\ncome to us recorded in matter-of-fact narratives of contemporaries,\r\nand corroborated by minute and daily memoranda of eye-witnesses.\"\r\n\r\nThe same can be said with even more truth of the conquistadores of the\r\nSpanish Main and of the daring adventurers who first penetrated the\r\ntrackless forests and scaled the lofty mountains of Venezuela and New\r\nGranada. \"Their minds,\" as Fiske well observes, \"were in a state like\r\nthat of the heroes of the Arabian Nights who, if they only wander far\r\nenough through the dark forest or across the burning desert, are sure\r\nat length to come upon some enchanted palace whereof they may fairly\r\nhope, with the aid of some gracious Jinni, to become masters.\" Thus\r\nit was that Cortes, unaided, however, by a gracious Jinni, became the\r\nmaster of the capital of the Aztecs, as Quesada and Pizarro became the\r\nmasters of the lands and the treasures of the Muiscas and the Incas.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for the student of early American history to cruise\r\nalong the Spanish Main, or sail on the broad waters of the Orinoco,\r\nthe Meta and the Magdalena, without harking back at every turn to the\r\nachievements of some of the early discoverers or conquistadores. Every\r\nisland, every promontory, every river has been visited by them and,\r\nif endowed with speech, they could tell thrilling stories of daring\r\nadventure and brilliant exploit unsurpassed in the annals of chivalry\r\nand crusading valor. Every place he goes, he will find that he has been\r\npreceded by the Spaniard by three or four centuries, for everywhere\r\nhe will find traces or traditions of his passage.\r\n\r\nIt matters not that the Spaniards were lured on by such ever-receding\r\nchimeras as Manoa, El Dorado and Lake Parime, that many other\r\nobjects of their quest were as mythical as that of the Argonauts or as\r\nunattainable as the golden apples of the Hesperides. Their expeditions\r\nwere not for these reasons wholly fruitless. Every one of them, whether\r\nfor the purpose of exploration or conquest or colonization, contributed\r\nto our knowledge of the lands visited and of the tribes inhabiting\r\nthem, many of whom have long since disappeared. And everywhere one\r\nfinds towns founded by them, or places, mountains and rivers that still\r\nbear the names that were given them at the time of their discovery.\r\n\r\nIt was always our pleasure, during our wanderings in the tropics, to\r\nrecall what the first explorers thought of the new lands visited by\r\nthem while they were still under the spell of the novel and marvelous\r\nthings that were ever claiming their rapt attention whithersoever\r\nthey went. We loved to look upon the countries we visited as their\r\nfirst explorers had looked upon them. This we were able to do, for\r\nthanks to the old chroniclers, the wonderment of the discovery of\r\nthe New World has been preserved, as in amber, in all its freshness,\r\nand that, too, for all time to come.\r\n\r\nComparatively few people realize how extensive is the literature,\r\nespecially in Spanish, that relates to the period of the conquest and\r\nthat immediately following it. And still fewer are aware of its intense\r\ninterest and importance. In addition to the well-known classic works\r\nof Peter Martyr, Las Casas, Herrera, Oviedo, Garcilaso de la Vega,\r\nCieza de Leon, Gomara, Acosta, and others scarcely less valuable,\r\nthere are scores of similar annals that have for centuries lain in\r\nthe archives of Spain and of the various countries of Latin-America\r\nwhich have but recently been published. Many of these--beyond price\r\nfor the historian--were absolutely unknown until a few years ago,\r\nand are still awaiting the artistic pen of a Prescott or an Irving\r\nto transmute their contents in masterpieces of literature. It is safe\r\nto say that nowhere else will the man of letters find a more fertile\r\nand a less cultivated field to engage his talent.\r\n\r\nThen there are the works, equally precious, of the early\r\nmissionaries. Many of them are veritable mines of information\r\nrespecting the manners and customs of the native inhabitants of\r\nthe tropics, while not a few of them are the only sources extant\r\nof knowledge respecting many interesting Indian tribes that have\r\nlong since become extinct. Among these deserving of special notice\r\nare the works of Simon, Gilli, Caulin, Rivero, Cassani, Gumilla\r\nand Piedrahita--not to mention others of lesser note--that treat\r\nspecially of Venezuela and New Granada, and afford us the truest\r\npicture of the condition of these countries during their existence\r\nunder Spanish domination. Humboldt frequently quotes them in his\r\ninstructive Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions\r\nof America, and usually with the generous approval and commendation\r\nwhich they so well deserve. To the humble and intelligent and often\r\nerudite missionaries of the tropics the illustrious German savant\r\nwas indebted for much of the success that attended his explorations\r\nin the basin of the Orinoco and along the plateau of the Cordilleras.\r\n\r\nWorthy of mention, too, in traversing countries where the traveler has\r\nnot the benefit of a Murray or a Baedeker, are the numerous works of\r\nthose explorers--German, English, French, American--who have followed\r\nin the footsteps of Humboldt and his compagnon de voyage, Bonpland,\r\nand who have cast a flood of light upon the fauna and flora of the\r\ncountries visited, and supplemented the works of the early historians\r\nand missionaries by describing the condition of their inhabitants as\r\nit obtains to-day.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages the author has endeavored to give not\r\nonly his own impressions of the lands he has visited but also,\r\nwhen the narrative permitted or required it, the impressions of\r\nothers--conquistadores, missionaries and men of science--who have gone\r\nover the same grounds or discussed the same topics as constitute the\r\nsubject-matter of this volume. The rapidly increasing interest of our\r\npeople in all matters pertaining to South America, and the eagerness\r\nnow manifested to see closer trade-relations established between the\r\nUnited States and the various republics of Latin America, seemed to\r\njustify this course. For the student, as well as for the general\r\nreader, it seemed to be desirable, if not necessary, to indicate,\r\nat least cursorily, by citations and footnotes, the character and\r\nextent of that large class of works, historical and scientific,\r\nthat occupy so important a position in the annals of discovery and\r\nof material and intellectual progress.\r\n\r\nIn the words of Pliny, quoted on the title page, it has been the aim\r\nof the author \"to give newness to old things, authority to new things,\r\nbeauty to things out of use, fame to the obscure, favor to the hateful,\r\ncredit to the doubtful, nature to all and all to nature.\" A difficult\r\ntask truly; how difficult no one can more fully recognize than the\r\nauthor himself. If he has failed in many of the things proposed,\r\nhe cherishes the hope that the reader's verdict will incline to\r\nthat contained in the last sentence of the paragraph cited: \"To\r\nsuch neverthelesse as can not attayne to all these, it is greatly\r\ncommendable and magnificall to have attempted the same.\"\r\n\r\nThe present book will be followed by a volume to be entitled: \"Along\r\nthe Andes and Down the Amazon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n        The Author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER                                                PAGE\r\n\r\n        I.

He was pondering a long vacation,\r\nmusing where rest and recreation might be found, at once wholesome\r\nand instructive, amid scenes quite different from any afforded by his\r\nprevious journeys. He was familiar with every place of interest in\r\nNorth America, from Canada to the Gulf, from Alaska to Yucatan. He\r\nhad spent many years in Europe, had visited Asia, Africa, and the\r\nfar-off isles of the Pacific. He cared not to revisit these, much\r\nless to go where he must entertain or be entertained. He sought rest,\r\nabsolute rest and freedom, untrammeled by conventional life. For\r\nthe present he would shun the society of his fellows for the serene\r\nsolitude of the wilderness, or the companionship of mighty mountains\r\nand rivers. Not that he was a misanthrope or that he wished to become\r\nan anchoret. Far from it. Still less did he wish to spend his time in\r\nidleness. This for him would have been almost tantamount to solitary\r\nconfinement. He dreamed of a land where he could spend most of the\r\ntime in the open air close to Nature and in communion with her--where\r\nboth mind and body could be always active and yet always free--free\r\nas the bird that comes and goes as it lists.\r\n\r\nWhilst thus absorbed in thought, and casting an occasional glance\r\nat the laborers in the street battling against the Frost-King, whose\r\nwork continued without intermission, the writer was awakened from his\r\nreverie by the dulcet notes evoked from a Steinway grand and the sweet,\r\nsympathetic voice of one who had just intoned the opening words of\r\nGoethe's matchless song as set to music by Liszt:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"Knowest thou the land where the pale citron grows,\r\n        And the gold orange through dark foliage glows?\r\n        A soft wind flutters through the deep blue sky,\r\n        The myrtle blooms, and towers the laurel high,\r\n        Knowest thou it well?\r\n                              O there with thee!\r\n        O that I might, my own beloved one, flee.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was La Niña--the pet name of the young musician--that came as a\r\nspecial providence to clear up a question that seemed to be growing\r\nmore difficult the longer it was pondered. The effect was magical,\r\nand all doubt and hesitation disappeared forthwith. La Niña, as if\r\ninspired, had, without in the least suspecting it, indicated the land\r\nof the heart's desire. Yes, the writer would leave, and leave at once,\r\nthe region of cloud and frost and chilling blast, and seek the land\r\nof flowers and sunshine, the land of \"soft wind\" and \"blue sky,\" \"the\r\nland where the pale citron grows,\" where \"the gold orange glows.\" It\r\nwould not, however, be the land of which Mignon sang and which she\r\nso yearned to see again. Lovely, charming Italy, with its manifold\r\nattractions of every kind, must for once yield to the sun-land of\r\nanother clime far away, and in another hemisphere.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards the writer, with a few friends, had taken his\r\nplace in a through Pullman car bound for the Land of Easter--the land\r\nof Ponce de Leon. They found every berth in the car occupied by people\r\nlike themselves hastening away from the rigors of winter and betaking\r\nthemselves to where\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Trees bloom throughout the year, soft breezes blow,\r\n    And fragrant Flora wears a lasting smile.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSome were going for the rest and the amusement promised at several\r\nnoted winter resorts. Others were in search of health that had been\r\nshattered by confinement or over-work. Some were going away for a few\r\nweeks only; others for the entire winter. Some were going no farther\r\nsouth than Florida, others purposed visiting some of the Antilles,\r\nand even, mayhap, the Spanish Main.\r\n\r\nAs for the writer, he had no fixed plan, and for this reason he had\r\nnot even thought of making out an itinerary. He would go to Florida to\r\ntake up again a line of travel that had been interrupted some decades\r\nbefore. He had always been interested in the lives and achievements\r\nof the early Spanish discoverers and conquistadores, and had, in\r\ndays gone by, followed in the footsteps of Narvaez and de Soto,\r\nof Cabeza de Vaca and Coronado, Fray Marcos de Niza, and Hernando\r\nCortes. And now that he had the opportunity, it occurred to him that\r\nhe could do nothing better or more profitable than make a reality what\r\nhad been a dream from boyhood. He would visit the islands and lands\r\ndiscovered by the immortal \"Admiral of the ocean sea\" and follow in\r\nthe footsteps of the conquistadores in Tierra Firme. He would explore\r\nthe lands first made known by Balboa, and Quesada, and Belalcazar and\r\nrendered famous by the prowess of the Almagros and the Pizarros. He\r\nwould visit the homes of the Musicas, the Incas, and the Ayamaras,\r\nwander among the Cordilleras from the Caribbean Sea to Lake Titicaca\r\nand beyond, and follow in the wake of Diego de Ordaz and Alonzo de\r\nHerrera on the broad waters of the Orinoco and in that of Pedro de\r\nOrsua and Francisco de Orellana in the mighty flood of the Amazon.\r\n\r\nA great undertaking apparently, and, considered in the light of certain\r\nreports published about tropical America, seemingly impossible. To\r\nsay the least, such a journey, it was averred, implied difficulties\r\nand privations and dangers innumerable.\r\n\r\n\"Do you wish to spend the rest of your life in South America? It will\r\nrequire a lifetime to visit the regions you have mentioned. I have\r\nmyself spent many years in traveling in tropical America, and knowing,\r\nas I do, the lack of facilities for travel, the countless unforeseen\r\ndelays of every kind, and the mañana habit that obtains everywhere in\r\nthe countries you would visit, I have no hesitation in stating that\r\nyou are attempting the impossible, if you mean to accomplish all you\r\nhave spoken of in the limited time you have allotted to yourself.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the words addressed to the writer on the eve of his departure\r\nby a noted traveler and one who is considered an authority on all\r\nthings South American. Not very encouraging, truly, especially to\r\none who was seeking rest and recreation and who was anything but\r\ninclined to court hardships and dangers in foreign lands and among\r\npeoples that were reputed to be only half-civilized, where-ever they\r\nchanced to be above the aboriginal savage that still roams over so\r\nmuch of the territory on both sides of the equator.\r\n\r\nBut, as already stated, the writer had on leaving home no definite\r\nprogramme mapped out. He left that to shape itself according to events\r\nand circumstances. He departed on his journey with little more of a\r\nplan than the vague indications of a life-long dream. Still, confiding\r\nin Providence, he hoped that he would be able to realize this, as he\r\nhad, in years gone by, realized other dreams that seemed even less\r\nlikely ever to become actualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLA FLORIDA\r\n\r\nTwenty-eight hours after leaving New York, with its snow and ice\r\nand arctic blasts, our party found itself wandering among the orange\r\ngroves and promenading beneath the graceful palms of old, romantic\r\nSt. Augustine. We could scarcely credit our senses, so complete was the\r\nchange in our environment. A soft, balmy atmosphere, gentle zephyrs,\r\nsweet, feathered songsters without number, all joining in a chorus\r\nof welcome to the strangers from the North, made us think that we had\r\nbeen transported to the Hesperides or to the delights of the Elysian\r\nFields. And when, after nightfall, we walked about the grounds and\r\nthe courts of the famous hostelries that have been recently erected\r\nregardless of expense, and provided with every luxury that money\r\nand art can command--all brilliantly illuminated by thousands of\r\nelectric lights of divers colors--it seemed as if we had, in very\r\ndeed, suddenly, we knew not how, become denizens of fairyland. To\r\nfind anything similar to the scene that here bursts upon the view of\r\nthe delighted visitor one must go to Monte Carlo during the season\r\nwhen thousands are attracted thither from all parts of the world,\r\nor betake oneself to the Place de la Concorde when the gay French\r\ncapital is en fête.\r\n\r\nSt. Augustine, with all its traditions and historic associations,\r\nis one of the most restful and interesting of places, especially\r\nin winter, and a place, too, where one might tarry for months with\r\npleasure. Nothing can be more delightful than the drives in the\r\npine-forests adjacent to the city,\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Where west-winds with musky wing\r\n        About the cedarn alleys fling\r\n        Nard and cassias balmy smells.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe could now verify at our leisure what we had been wont to consider\r\nas the exaggerated statements of the early explorers of Florida\r\nregarding the beautiful forests--\"trellised with vines and gay\r\nwith blossoms\"--and the fragrant odors that were wafted from them\r\nby the breeze even out to the ships passing along the coast, and\r\n\"in such abundance that the entire orient could not produce so\r\nmuch.\" \"We stretched forth our hands,\" writes Lescarbot, in his\r\nHistorie de la Nouvelle France, \"as if to grasp them, so palpable\r\nwere they.\" All carried away with them the same impression about the\r\n\"douceur odoriferante de plusieurs bonnes choses\"--the odoriferous\r\nsweetness of many good things--that was everywhere observable.\r\n\r\nNor were their accounts of this grateful feature of the country\r\noverdrawn. It is the same to-day as it was four centuries ago,\r\nwhen the European had just landed on these shores and found so many\r\nthings--as novel as they were marvelous--to excite his delight and\r\nenthusiasm. It is something that is denied to us whose homes are\r\nin the North, and, to enjoy it in all its newness and freshness,\r\nwe must perforce immigrate to tropical and subtropical climes.\r\n\r\nBut the foregoing is only one of the delectable features of this\r\nfavored land. As we wander through the groves and gardens and sail on\r\nthe placid waters of the rivers and lakes through the silent everglades\r\nor the dark and mysterious forests, we find at every turn something\r\nto charm the ear or delight the eyes. Everywhere we meet with new\r\nand beauteous form of animal and vegetable life and realize for the\r\nfirst time, perhaps, how diverse and multitudinous are the forms of\r\nanimated nature.\r\n\r\nIf we are to credit Herrera, it was on account of its beautiful aspect,\r\nas well as on the day on which it was discovered, that the locality\r\nreceived the name it now bears. The historian says explicitly that\r\nPonce de Leon and his companions \"named it Florida because it appeared\r\nvery delightful, having many pleasant groves, and it was all level;\r\nas also because they discovered it at Easter, which, as has been said,\r\nthe Spaniards call Pascua de Flores or Florida.\" [1]\r\n\r\nIn view of this clear and positive statement of Herrera, one is\r\nsurprised to see that writers treating the subject ex professo have\r\nfallen into error regarding the origin of the name Florida. Thus\r\nBarnard Shipp writes: \"The Peninsula of Florida was discovered by\r\nJuan Ponce de Leon on Pascua Florida, Palm Sunday, in the year 1512,\r\n[2] and because of the day on which he discovered it, he gave it the\r\nname Florida.\" [3]\r\n\r\nAll doubt, however, about the real origin of the name, about which\r\nthere has been so much misunderstanding, is removed by the declaration\r\nof Peter Martyr, the father of American history. In his delightfully\r\nrefreshing work, De Orbe Novo, which is not so well known as it\r\nshould be, he asserts in language that does not admit of ambiguity,\r\nthat Juan Ponce named the newly discovered territory Florida because\r\nit was discovered the day of the Resurrection, for the Spaniards call\r\nthe day of the Resurrection Pascua de Flores.\" [4]\r\n\r\nWhen the French Huguenots some decades later attempted to colonize\r\nthe country they called it \"La Nouvelle France\"--New France--a name\r\nthey also subsequently gave to Canada.\r\n\r\nMore interesting, however, is the fact that the Spaniards first thought\r\nthe peninsula to be an island and called it Isla Florida. Ponce de Leon\r\nin writing to Charles V calls it an island, and it is figured as such\r\nin the Turin map of the New World, circa 1523. But after they learned\r\nthat it was the mainland, Florida was made to embrace the whole of\r\nNorth America except Mexico. Thus writes Herrera and Las Casas. The\r\nlatter make it extend from what we now know as Cape Sable to \"the\r\nland of Codfish\" (Newfoundland), \"otherwise known as Labrador, which\r\nis not very far from the island of England.\" The present boundaries\r\nof Florida, it may be remarked, were not determined until 1795,\r\nwhen they were fixed by treaty with Spain.\r\n\r\nBut what in more interesting than names and boundaries, and what will,\r\nperhaps, be more surprising to the readers of popular works on the\r\nsubject, is the fact that Ponce de Leon, in spite of all that has\r\nbeen said to the contrary, was not the discoverer of Florida, the\r\nfact that it was discovered nearly two decades before Ponce de Leon\r\nreached its shores, and the further and more unexpected fact that it\r\nwas discovered by that much misrepresented and much abused navigator,\r\nAmericus Vespucius.\r\n\r\nThanks to the researches of Varnhagen, Harrisse and others, these facts\r\nhave been apparently demonstrated beyond doubt. In his work on the\r\nvoyages of the brothers Cortereal, Harrisse has clearly proven that,\r\nbetween the end of the year 1500 and the summer of 1502, certain\r\nnavigators, whose names and nationality are unknown, but who were\r\npresumably Spaniards, discovered, explored and named that part of the\r\ncoast-line of the United States which extends from Pensacola Bay,\r\nalong the Gulf of Mexico, to the Cape of Florida, and, turning it,\r\nruns northward along the Atlantic coast to about the mouth of the\r\nChesapeake or the Hudson. [5] The maps of Juan de la Cosa--drawn\r\nin 1500--and the one made for Alberto Cantino in 1502--maps which\r\nhave only recently received the attention due them--are overwhelming\r\nevidence of the truth of these conclusions.\r\n\r\nAccording to M. Varnhagen, the one who furnished the data for these\r\nmaps, if indeed, he did not construct the prototype from which they\r\nwere both executed, was no other than Americus Vespucius, who from now\r\non must receive different treatment from that which has hitherto been\r\naccorded him. By marshalling a brilliant array of facts, presented with\r\nmasterly logic, Varnhagen, silences the detractors of the illustrious\r\nFlorentine navigator, and disarms those objectors who have been\r\nunwilling to accept as true the statements contained in the celebrated\r\nSoderini letter regarding his first voyage to the New World in 1497 and\r\n1498. He leaves no doubt on the reader's mind, that Vespucius, after\r\nvisiting Honduras and Yucatan, sailed thence to and around Florida,\r\nand that, if he did not himself actually construct the original of the\r\nCantino map, it was he that supplied the data from which both this\r\nmap and that of Juan de la Cosa were rendered possible. [6] If some\r\nfortunate student of early Americana should eventually ferret out\r\nthe Quattro Giornate--Four Journeys--of which Vespucius frequently\r\nmakes mention, and in which he gives an account of all his voyages,\r\nhe would render an incalculable service to the cause of truth, and\r\nwould be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of even the most\r\nexacting critic the extent and importance of the services rendered by\r\nthe pilot major of Spain to the crown of Leon and Castile--services\r\nonly second to those which distinguish Columbus himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFONS JUVENTUTIS\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be said about the discovery of the country, Ponce\r\nde Leon's name will always remain so closely linked with Florida\r\nthat it will never be possible to dissociate the two. One may forget\r\nall about his enterprise as a navigator and may ignore his claims\r\nas a discoverer, but one can never become oblivious of that strange\r\nepisode with which his name is inseparably connected--the romantic\r\nsearch for the Fountain of Youth.\r\n\r\nFor the historian, as for the psychologist, the subject possesses\r\nan abiding interest, and even the casual visitor to Florida finds\r\nhimself unconsciously dreaming about the days long gone by when\r\nSpaniard and Indian were wandering through forest and everglade in\r\nsearch of the life-giving fountain about which they had heard such\r\nmarvelous reports. And if his dreams do not consume all his time,\r\nhe also finds himself speculating on the origin of such reports, or\r\nthe basis of the legend which started Ponce de Leon and others on a\r\nsearch for what proved to be an ignis fatuus as extraordinary as was\r\nthe mythical Eldorado a few years later.\r\n\r\nThe historian Gomara, referring to this episode in the life of Ponce de\r\nLeon, writes as follows: \"The gouernour of the Islande of Boriquena,\r\nJohn Ponce de Leon, beinge discharged of his office and very ryche,\r\nfurnysshed and sente foorth two carvels to seeke the Ilandes of Boyuca\r\nin the which the Indians affirmed to be a fontayne or spring whose\r\nwater is of vertue to make owlde men younge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whyle he trauayled syxe monethes with owtragious desyre among many\r\nIlandes to fynde that he sought, and coulde fynde no token of any\r\nsuch fountayne, he entered into Bimini and discouered the lande of\r\nFlorida in the yeare 1512 on Easter day which the Spanyardes caule the\r\nflorisshing day of Pascha, wherby they named that lande Florida.\" [7]\r\n\r\nAntonio de Herrera speaks not only of this Fountain of Youth but\r\nalso of a river whose waters had likewise the marvelous property\r\nof restoring youth to old age. This river was also supposed to be\r\nin Florida. It was known as the Jordan and received quite as much\r\nattention from both Spaniards and Indians as did the Fountain of Youth.\r\n\r\nFonteneda, who spent seventeen years in the wilds of Florida, as a\r\ncaptive of the Indians, gives more explicit information about the\r\nsubject than either Gomara or Herrera. \"Juan Ponce de Leon,\" he says,\r\n\"believing the reports of the Indians of Cuba and San Domingo to\r\nbe true, made an expedition into Florida to discover the river\r\nJordan. This he did, either because he wished to acquire renown,\r\nor, perhaps, because he hoped to become young again by bathing in\r\nits waters. Many years ago a number of Cuban Indians went in search\r\nof this river, and entered the province of Carlos, but Sequene, the\r\nfather of Carlos, took them prisoners and settled them in a village,\r\nwhere their descendants are still living. The news that these people\r\nhad left their own country to bathe in the river Jordan spread among\r\nall the kings and chiefs of Florida, and, an they were an ignorant\r\npeople, they set out in search of this river, which was supposed\r\nto possess the powers of rejuvenating old men and women. So eager\r\nwere they in their search, that they did not pass a river, a brook,\r\na lake, or even a swamp, without bathing in it, and even to this day\r\nthey have not ceased to look for it, but always without success. The\r\nnatives of Cuba, braving the dangers of the sea, became the victims\r\nof their faith, and thus it happened that they came to Carlos,\r\nwhere they built a village. They came in such great numbers that,\r\nalthough many have died, there are still many living there, both old\r\nand young. While I was a prisoner in those parts I bathed in a great\r\nmany rivers but never found the right one.\" [8]\r\n\r\nThe poet-historian, Juan de Castellanos, writing in mock heroic\r\nstyle, says that so great were the virtues of the Fountain of\r\nYouth, that by means of its waters old women were able to get rid\r\nof their wrinkles and gray hairs. \"A few draughts of the water and\r\na bath in the restoring fluid sufficed to restore strength to their\r\nenfeebled members, give beauty to their features, and impart to a faded\r\ncomplexion the glow of youth. And, considering the vanity of our times,\r\nI wonder how many old women would drag themselves to this saving wave,\r\nif the puerilities of which I speak were certainties. How rich and\r\npuissant would not be the king who should own such a fountain! What\r\nfarms, jewels, and prized treasures would not men sell in order to\r\nbecome young again! And what cries of joy would not proceed from\r\nthe women-folk--from the fair as well as from the homely! In what\r\na variety of costumes and liveries would not all go to seek such\r\nfavors! Certainly they would take greater pains than they would in\r\nmaking a visit to the Holy Land.\" [9]\r\n\r\nWhat Castellanos said might be repeated to-day. If the Fountain of\r\nYouth or the river Jordan, such as Ponce de Leon, Ayllon and de Soto\r\nsought, now existed, Florida would be the most frequented and most\r\nthickly populated country on the face of the globe. Vichy, Homburg,\r\nKarlsbad and other similar resorts would at once be abandoned, and\r\nthere would forthwith be a mad rush for the Land of Easter. The\r\nFountain of Youth would be worth more to its possessor than the\r\ndiamond mines of Kimberley, more than the combined interests of\r\nStandard Oil, more than all the stocks and bonds of the United\r\nStates Steel Corporation. There would be countless numbers who,\r\nlike Faust, would be ready to sell their souls for a single draught\r\nof the life-giving fountain, for a single plunge into the health-\r\nand strength-restoring river.\r\n\r\nThat the simple and ignorant Indians of Cuba and Haiti and adjacent\r\nislands should have credited the stories in circulation about\r\nthe marvelous waters said to exist somewhere in Florida we can\r\nunderstand. The marvelous and the supernatural always appeal in a\r\nspecial manner to the superstitious and untutored savage. We are,\r\nhowever, disposed to smile at the credulity of the enlightened\r\nSpaniard who did not hesitate to sacrifice fortune and life in the\r\nquest of what could never be found outside of Utopia. But, viewing\r\nthings in our present state of knowledge, it is easy to judge them\r\nrashly and do them a grave injustice. We must transport ourselves\r\nback to the times in which they lived and acted, and consider\r\nthe strange and novel environment in which they suddenly found\r\nthemselves. A new world had just been discovered--a world in which\r\neverything--plants, trees, animals, men--seemed different from what\r\nthey were familiar with in their own land. And for a people who from\r\ntheir youth had eagerly listened to stories of knight-errantry, and\r\nwho, by long association with their Moorish neighbors, were ready\r\nto accept as sober facts the wildest statements of oriental fable,\r\na special allowance must be made. They had heard of the adventures\r\nof Marco Polo, and of the wonders of Cathay and Cipango, and their\r\nminds were full of the oft-told tales about the Fortunate Isles, and\r\nthe Islands of the Blest--located somewhere in the broad Atlantic,\r\nand presumably in the region of the setting sun--and what more natural\r\nthan that they should expect to find themselves some bright morning\r\nin a land of enchantment? The marvelous stories current about the\r\nvoyages of St. Brendan and his companions, about the island in the\r\nWestern sea inhabited by Enoch and Elias, about the Garden of Eden\r\nmoved from the distant East to the more distant West, all contributed\r\nto prepare their minds for a ready acceptance of the most extravagant\r\nstatements. Had not the great Admiral, Columbus, announced that he\r\nhad located the site of the Terrestrial Paradise, when he sailed by\r\nthe rushing water of the Orinoco, and had not his views been accepted\r\nby thousands of his wondering contemporaries?\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, is it astonishing that the early explorers should\r\nhave seriously believed in what we are now so ready to denounce\r\nas absurd? The romantic world of the sixteenth century, when Pliny\r\nand the Physiologus and the Bestiaries, were accepted by students\r\nof nature as unquestioned authorities; when learned men spent their\r\nlives in search of the elixir of life and the philosopher's stone,\r\nand believed in the transmutation of the baser metals into gold,\r\nwas quite different from our prosaic twentieth-century world, when\r\nnothing is accepted that cannot pass the ordeal of exact science.\r\n\r\nAgain, we must not imagine, as is so often done, that a Fons\r\nJuventutis, such as Ponce de Leon and his contemporaries sought for,\r\nwas something unheard of in the history of our race. Stories of\r\nmiraculously healing fountains have been current from early times\r\nand in divers parts of the world--in India, in Ethiopia, and in the\r\nisles of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe reader will recall what Sir John Mandeville says about a well\r\nof youth he found during his travels in India. It was, he declares,\r\n\"a right faire and a clere well, that hath a full good and sweete\r\nsavoure, and it smelleth of all maner of sortes of spyces, and also\r\nat eche houre of the daye it changeth his savor diversely, and whoso\r\ndrinketh thries on the daye of that well, he is made hole of all maner\r\nof sickenesse that he hathe. I have sometime dronke of that well and me\r\nthinketh yet that I fare the better; some call it the well of youth,\r\nfor they that drinke thereof seme to be yong alway, and live without\r\ngreat sicknesse, and they saye this, cometh from Paradise terrestre,\r\nfor it is so vertuous.\" [10]\r\n\r\nSo writes Mandeville, but there is reason to believe that he cribbed\r\nthis account of the Fountain of Youth from a medieval legend of\r\nPrester John, from which, on account of the interest that attaches\r\nto the subject, I select the following paragraph:--\r\n\r\n\"Item aboute this passage is a fonteyne or a conduyte so who of this\r\nwatere drinked, IIJ. tymes he shall waxe yonge and also yf a man haue\r\nhad a sykenes, XXX. yere and drynked of thys same water he shall therof\r\nbe hole and sonde. And also as a man thereof drinked hym semeth that\r\nhe had occupyed the beste mete and drinke of the worlde, and this same\r\nfonteyne is full of the grace of the holy goost, and who sowe in this\r\nsame water wasshed his body he shall become yonge of XXX. yere.\" [11]\r\n\r\nWhether these stories had their origin in folklore or not, they\r\nfound their way into Europe at least two centuries before the voyage\r\nof Ponce de Leon to Florida. Mandeville's work appeared in French,\r\nLatin, and English, and such was its popularity, that Halliwell did\r\nnot hesitate to declare that \"of no book, with the exception of the\r\nScriptures, can more MSS. be found at the end of the fourteenth and\r\nthe beginning of the fifteenth century.\"\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, it would be strange indeed if the Spaniards were\r\nnot familiar with stories so widely circulated, and stranger still\r\nif, on arriving in the New World, and learning from the Indians of\r\nthe existence of a fountain of youth, and at no great distance away,\r\nthey should not seek to locate it and test its virtues. Given the\r\nstate of knowledge at the time, and the credence accorded to the\r\naccounts of similar fountains in the Old World, the much ridiculed\r\nexpedition of Ponce de Leon followed as a natural consequence. It\r\nwould have been more surprising if the expedition had not been made\r\nthan that it was made.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks on the Florida Fountain of Youth and river\r\nJordan would be incomplete without a few words about the probable\r\norigin of the traditions concerning them. To attribute their origin\r\nto folklore simply may be true, but it explains nothing.\r\n\r\nM. E. Beauvois, in a series of interesting articles--very plausible\r\nif not conclusive--on the subject, contends that all the traditions\r\nregarding the Fountain of Youth and the river Jordan, which proved\r\nso attractive to the Spaniards, are of Christian origin. He maintains\r\nthat the Gaels, as early as 1380, \"had established relations with the\r\naborigines from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the tropical zone of North\r\nAmerica, and that it is very probable that missionaries accompanied\r\nthe merchants in their voyages to Florida and the Antilles.\" He argues\r\nthat these missionaries baptized the indigenes in some river which,\r\nfor that reason, they called the Jordan, or that they spoke to them\r\nof a river in their country, on which a Christian mission had been\r\nestablished, and that this fact gave rise to the formation of the\r\ntradition of a Jordan situated somewhere at the north of the Antilles.\r\n\r\nIt remains to show how this tradition came to be confounded with\r\nthe story of the Fountain of Youth. This confusion was the more\r\nnatural that the same idea is at the foundation of the two parallel\r\ntraditions. The one has reference to the regeneration of the soul,\r\nthe other to the rejuvenation of the body, both being effected by\r\nmeans of vivifying water. In the beginning, but one kind of water\r\nwas known, that \"which saved by its own proper virtue, the water of\r\nbaptism, which is exclusively spiritual.\" Subsequently, however, the\r\nsimple and superstitious Indian attributed to the waters of baptism\r\nproperties which seemed to him preferable to those spoken of by the\r\nmissionary--the properties, namely, \"of curing diseases of the body,\r\nor of restoring youth to the decrepit and of indefinitely prolonging\r\nlife. From that time the Fountain of Youth had a proper existence\r\nand began to play an important role in popular traditions.\"\r\n\r\nHow long the tradition of the beneficent waters of Florida\r\nexisted--and Florida, it must be remembered, meant to the Spaniards\r\nof the sixteenth century all the Atlantic coast--M. Beauvois does\r\nnot determine. It may have been only a few generations, or it may\r\nhave been several centuries. It may even have dated back to about\r\nthe year 1008, when Thorfinn Karlsefni was baptized in \"Vinland the\r\nGood\"--Massachusetts--the first Christian, so far as known, born on\r\nthe American continent. Or it may have originated as far north as New\r\nBrunswick--\"Great Ireland or Huitramannaland--which had been occupied\r\nby a Gaelic colony from the year 1000, or from an earlier date,\r\nuntil the end of the fourteenth century, and where, about the year\r\n1000, the Papas, Columbite monks, the evangelizers of that region,\r\nhad baptized the Icelander, Aré Mârsson, who had left his native\r\nisland before his conversion to Christianity.\"\r\n\r\nAt all events, whatever conclusions may be reached as to the time when\r\nand the place where the tradition originated, it is manifest that\r\n\"it could have been propagated in the New World only by Christians\r\nand as it was in existence before the arrival of the Spaniards,\r\nwe must attribute its propagation to other Europeans, to those,\r\nfor example, whose crosses the indigenes of Tennessee and Georgia\r\nhad exhumed from their ancient burial places, or to those whom the\r\ninhabitants of Haiti had known either de visu or by hearsay.\" [12]\r\n\r\nWhat is here said of the Christian origin of the Florida Fountain of\r\nYouth can likewise be predicated of the one mentioned in the legend\r\nof Prester John--whence, as we have seen, Mandeville got his story,\r\nfor it is said, \"this same fonteyne is full of the grace of the holy\r\ngoost,\" an obvious allusion to the regenerating waters of baptism.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to resume the thread of our narrative, interrupted by a\r\ndiscussion unavoidably long, but pardonable, it is hoped, in view of\r\nits abiding interest and intimate connection with the early history\r\nof Florida. Besides, my purpose is not so much to give descriptions\r\nof the countries through which we shall pass--something which has\r\nin most instances been done before--as to give the impressions of\r\ntheir earliest explorers and to dwell, as briefly as may be, on topics\r\nrelating to the various regions visited, that possess even for the most\r\ncasual reader a perennial fascination and importance. In countries like\r\nthose we shall visit, the impressions of the first explorers are often\r\nmore interesting and instructive than those of the latest tourist or\r\nnaturalist, for such impressions have about them a freshness and an\r\noriginality--often a quaintness and a simplicity--that are entirely\r\nabsent from modern works of travel. Another reason for so doing is that\r\nmuch of the ground, over which we shall travel, is practically the\r\nsame to-day as when it first greeted the eyes of the conquistadores,\r\nand many of the towns and cities we shall visit, no less than the\r\nmanners and customs of the people, differ but little from what they\r\nwere in the time of Charles V and Philip II. Thus, regarding many\r\nthings, the statements of the Spanish writers and missionaries of\r\nfour centuries ago are still as true as if they had been penned but\r\nyesterday, and that, too, by the most accurate observer.\r\n\r\nFrom St. Augustine, the oldest city in the United States, the traveler\r\nhas the choice of two routes to Havana. One is by way of Tampa Bay,\r\ncalled by De Soto the Bay of Espíritu Santo, and by some of the early\r\ngeographers designated as the Bay of Ponce de Leon. What, however,\r\nis now known as Ponce de Leon Bay, is farther south and near the\r\nsouthernmost point of the peninsula. The other route is along the\r\neast coast of the state. At the time of our visit the railroad was in\r\noperation only as far as Miami, but was being rapidly pushed towards\r\nits terminus at Key West.\r\n\r\nWe chose the eastern route because we could in fancy follow more\r\nclosely in the footsteps of the conquistadores and picture to\r\nourselves, in the ocean, nearly always visible, that long procession\r\nof barks and brigantines which four centuries ago plowed the main,\r\nsome moving northward, others southward--all manned by brawny,\r\nhardy mariners in search of gold and glory. Spaniards, like Ponce\r\nde Leon and Pedro Menendez; Italians, like Americus Vespucius and\r\nVerrazano; Englishmen, like Hawkins and Raleigh; Frenchmen, like\r\nRibaut and Laudonniere, all passed along this coast--all bent on\r\nachieving distinction or extending the possessions of their respective\r\nsovereigns. Brave and gallant mariners these, men whose names are\r\nwrit large on the pages of story and who occupy a conspicuous place\r\nin the records of the heroes of adventure.\r\n\r\nFrom Miami we went by steamer to Key West, which will soon be\r\naccessible by rail from St. Augustine. The sea was as placid as an\r\ninland lakelet and the voyage to Havana was in every way ideal. We\r\nskirted along the Florida Keys--those countless coral islets that\r\nare to serve as piers for the railroad under construction, which is\r\nto form so important a link between Cuba and the United States. When\r\ncompleted the time consumed in going to the Pearl of the Antilles\r\nwill not only be greatly lessened, but the former discomforts and\r\nterrors of the journey will be entirely eliminated. No longer will\r\nthe traveler be obliged to encounter the hurricanes of the Bahamas or\r\nthe heavy seas off Cape Hatteras. He will be able to take his seat\r\nin a Pullman car in New York and go, without change, through to Key\r\nWest and thence to Havana and Santiago de Cuba.\r\n\r\nHow different was it when the small Spanish craft of four centuries\r\nago navigated these waters on their way from Panama and Vera Cruz to\r\nthe mother country! Then, as the reader will observe, by reference\r\nto the old maps of Florida, the keys or coral reefs along the coast\r\nwere known as Los Mártires--the Martyrs--so named by Ponce de Leon on\r\naccount of the number of shipwrecks that occurred here, and because\r\nof the number of lives that were lost on these treacherous shoals\r\nand also, as Herrera informs us, because of certain rock-formations\r\nin the vicinity that have the appearance of men in distress.\r\n\r\nIf we may credit the legends and traditions that have obtained in\r\nthose parts, many a Spanish treasure-ship has been lost in threading\r\nits way through the uncharted shoals and islands of Los Mártires and\r\nthe Bahamas, and many futile attempts have been made to recover at\r\nleast a part of the treasure lost, but it was\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"Lost in a way that made search vain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd of the adventurous divers, who braved the dangers of current and\r\nwave, one can safely say in the words of Bret Harte\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  \"Never a sign,\r\n        East or West, or under the line,\r\n        They saw of the missing galleon;\r\n        Never a sail or plank or chip,\r\n        They found of the long-lost treasure-ship,\r\n        Or enough to build a tale upon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEARL OF THE ANTILLES\r\n\r\nEarly the morning following our departure from Miami we were aroused\r\nfrom our slumbers by the cry of a mariner, \"Land ho! all hands\r\nahoy!\" We were on deck without delay, and there before us, under a\r\nsky of purest azure, we beheld the hills of Cuba, clad in a mantle\r\nof undying verdure. Its resplendent shores were arrayed in hues of\r\nglowing beauty and unimagined loveliness. Fragrant groves of orange\r\nand pomegranate, luxuriant forests white with clouds of bloom, formed\r\na glorious setting to the refulgent waves that reflected the crimson\r\nsplendors of the rising sun. Delicious zephyrs, fanning their balmy\r\nwings, bathed our brows with dewy freshness, sweet with perfume from\r\nambrosial fruits and tropic flowers. Yes, we were in the Pearl of\r\nthe Antilles, the \"Sweet Isle of Flowers\"; in Gan Eden--the Garden\r\nof Delight--that in the legends of long ago was reckoned among the\r\nIsles of the Blest.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful pictures before us, however, were but as a fleeting\r\npanorama. We had but little time to feast our eyes on them before we\r\nwere in front of grim, frowning Morro Castle, that for three centuries\r\nand more has stood sentinel of the fair city at its feet. Adjoining\r\nthe Castle are the Cabañas, a vast range of fortifications more than a\r\nmile in length, and nearly a thousand feet in breadth. Just opposite,\r\non the other side of the harbor's entrance, is the Bateria de la\r\nPunta, and some distance farther beyond is the star-shaped Castle\r\nAtares. From a military standpoint Havana is well protected, and,\r\nwith Morro Castle properly equipped with modern artillery, would be\r\npractically impregnable.\r\n\r\nFew West Indian cities have greater historic interest than Havana. From\r\nthe time it was first visited by Ocampo, four hundred years ago, until\r\nthe raising of the flag of the Cuban Republic in 1904, it has been\r\nthe witness of many stirring events that have effected the destinies\r\nof millions of people in various parts of the world. It was from\r\nHavana's port that Cortes, in 1519, sailed on his memorable voyage to\r\nMexico. It was from this port that Pamphilio de Narvaez and Hernando\r\nde Soto started on their ill-starred expeditions to Florida. Time\r\nand again the city was harassed by Dutch, French and English pirates\r\nand Buccaneers. Oftentimes, too, the daring sea-rovers, who so long\r\ninfested West Indian waters, levied tribute on the unfortunate\r\ninhabitants who were unable to defend themselves. Indeed, it was\r\nto defend the city from these marauders that the kings of Spain,\r\nin the middle of the sixteenth century, began the erection of\r\nthose fortifications that, since their completion, have excited the\r\nadmiration of all who have visited them.\r\n\r\nCuba was one of the islands Columbus discovered during his first\r\nvoyage. But he thought he had discovered a continent--that he had\r\nreached the eastern extremity of Asia. He had set out from Spain\r\nto find a western route to the Indies, to offset the discoveries\r\nof Bartholomew Diaz and Vasco da Gama. To him Cuba was the land\r\nof the Great Khan, far-off Cathay, and Española, discovered shortly\r\nafterwards, was Cipango, Japan. Indeed, there is reason to believe that\r\nhe died in the belief that Cuba, far from being an island, was a part\r\nof China, as mapped by Toscanelli and described by Marco Polo. We have\r\nno positive evidence that he was ever aware of the circumnavigation\r\nof the island by Pinzón and Solís in 1497, and he was dead two years\r\nbefore its insularity was again proved by Ocampo. He never dreamed\r\nthat he had discovered a new world, nor did any of his contemporaries\r\nor immediate successors have any conclusive reason to infer that the\r\nlands discovered by the great Admiral in his third and fourth voyages\r\nwere not a part of the Asiatic continent.\r\n\r\nBalboa's discovery of the Pacific Ocean did not supply such reasons,\r\nneither did the rounding of South America and the circumnavigation\r\nof the globe by Magellan. Nor were the necessary proofs furnished by\r\nthe explorations of Drake or Frobisher, Davis or Hudson or Baffin.\r\n\r\nThe final demonstration of the complete separation of America from\r\nAsia was a long process and was not given until the noted explorations\r\nof Vitus Behring in 1728, more than two centuries after Balboa from\r\nthe summit of a peak in Darien first descried the placid waters of\r\nthe great South Sea. [13]\r\n\r\nWe had desired to visit the northern and southern coasts of Cuba,\r\nand to feast our eyes on the beautiful scenes that had so captivated\r\nColumbus; to view the hundred harbors that indent its tortuous\r\nshores; to see the Queen's Gardens--now known as Los Cayos de\r\nlas Doce Leguas--which the great navigator fancied to be the seven\r\nthousand spice islands of Marco Polo, but our time was too limited to\r\npermit the long and slow coasting that would be required. Besides,\r\nwe preferred to study the interior of the country, and pass through\r\nthe sugar and tobacco plantations for which the island is so famous.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the comfort of the traveler, there is now a through\r\ntrain from Havana to Santiago, so that one can make the entire five\r\nhundred and forty miles in twenty-four hours, and that, too, if one\r\nso elect, in a Pullman car.\r\n\r\nColumbus, in writing of his first voyage to Rafael Sánchez and Luis\r\nde Santangel, says that all the countries he had discovered, but\r\nparticularly Juana--the name he gave to Cuba--\"are of surpassing\r\nexcellence,\" and \"exceedingly fertile.\" \"All these islands\" he\r\ncontinues, \"are very beautiful and distinguished by a diversity of\r\nscenery; they are filled with a great variety of trees of immense\r\nheight, and which I believe retain their foliage in all seasons; for\r\nwhen I saw them\"--in November--\"they were as verdant and luxuriant\r\nas they usually are in Spain in the month of May--some of them were\r\nblossoming, some bearing fruit, and all flourishing in the greatest\r\nperfection, according to their respective stages of growth, and the\r\nnature and quality of each.\" Again he writes, \"The nightingale and a\r\nthousand other sorts of birds were singing in the month of November\r\nwherever I went. There are palm trees in these countries of six\r\nor eight sorts, which are surprising to see, on account of their\r\ndiversity from ours, but, indeed, this is the case with respect to\r\nthe other trees, as well as the fruits and weeds. Here are also honey,\r\nand fruits of a thousand sorts, and birds of every variety.\" [14]\r\n\r\nThe Admiral's delight and enthusiasm at all he saw knew no bounds,\r\nand in his diary he gives frequent expression to the pleasurable\r\nemotions he experienced. All was new to him, and all beautiful beyond\r\nwords to describe. Trees and plants were as different from those in\r\nSpain as day is from night, and the verdure and bloom in November\r\nwere as fresh and brilliant as in the month of May in Andalusia. [15]\r\nThe great navigator had a poet's love of nature, and artist's eye\r\nfor the beautiful. Indeed, it may be truthfully said that no one\r\nsince his time has more correctly and more succinctly portrayed the\r\nsalient features of these islands, and it may be questioned if any\r\none has more deeply appreciated their beauty and splendor.\r\n\r\nThat which frequently arrests the attention of the traveler, on the way\r\nfrom Havana to Santiago, is the numerous sugar and tobacco plantations\r\neverywhere visible. Sugar cane, as is known, was not found by the\r\nSpaniards on their arrival in the New World, but was introduced there\r\na short time after, most probably from the Madeira or Canary Islands.\r\n\r\nTobacco, however, is an American plant, and one of the things that\r\nmost surprised the Europeans on first coming in contact with the\r\nIndians of the newly discovered islands was to find them smoking the\r\ndried leaves of this now favorite narcotic.\r\n\r\nThe first mention of tobacco is in Columbus' diary under date of\r\nNovember 6, 1492. Referring to two messengers he had sent out among the\r\nIndians, he writes, \"The two Christians met on the road a great many\r\npeople going to their villages, men and women with brands in their\r\nhands, made of herbs, for taking their customary smoke.\" [16] These,\r\nthen, were the first cigars of which we have any record. The use of\r\ntobacco in pipes was apparently first observed in Florida by Captain\r\nJohn Hawkins during his voyage to the peninsula in 1566. Among many\r\nother interesting things he tells us about the inhabitants is that\r\nof their use and love of the pipe.\r\n\r\n\"The Floridians when they trauel haue a kinde of herbe dryed, which\r\nwith a cane, and an earthen cup in the end, with fire, and the dried\r\nherbs put together do sucke thoro the cane the smoke thereof, which\r\nsmoke satisfieth their hunger, and therewith they liue foure or five\r\ndays without meat or drinke, and this all the Frenchmen vsed for this\r\npurpose; yet do they holde opinion withall, that it causeth water\r\nand flame to void from their stomachs.\" [17]\r\n\r\nThe early Italian traveler, Girolamo Benzoni, evidently did not\r\nshare the views of the Floridians and Frenchmen regarding the\r\nvalue of tobacco. To him it was nothing less than an invention of\r\nSatan. Speaking of its evil effects, he says, \"See what a pestiferous\r\nand wicked poison from the devil this must be.\" [18]\r\n\r\nBut it is the good Old Dominican, Père Labat, who has the most to\r\nsay about the introduction and use of tobacco. His charming, gossipy\r\naccount of men and things and his vagabunda loquacitas, have lost\r\nnone of their fascination for the curious reader since they were\r\nfirst written nearly two centuries ago.\r\n\r\nAmong other things he does not hesitate to affirm that the Indians,\r\n\"by introducing the use of tobacco among their pitiless conquerors,\r\nsucceeded, in great measure, in avenging themselves for the unjust\r\nservitude to which they had been reduced.\" [19] According to the good\r\nfather, tobacco proved to be a veritable apple of discord, because it\r\ngave rise to a protracted war of words among men of science. In this\r\nwar a large number of ignoramuses as well as savants participated. And\r\nnot the last to declare themselves in favor of or opposed to what\r\nthey understood no better than the serious affairs of the day, in\r\nwhich they had been but too active, were the woman-folk.\r\n\r\nPhysicians discussed its properties, nature and virtues, as if it\r\nhad been known all over the habitable world from the times of Galen,\r\nHippocrates, and Æsculapius, and their opinions were as diverse, and\r\nas opposed to one another as are to-day the opinions of allopaths\r\nand homeopaths, osteopaths and psychopaths. They prescribed when\r\nand how it was to be taken and in what doses. They and the chemists\r\nof the time soon recognized in tobacco a valuable addition to their\r\npharmacopoea. Nay, more, it was not long before it was proclaimed as\r\na panacea for all the ills that poor suffering humanity is heir to.\r\n\r\nIts ashes cured glanders; taken as a powder it cured rheumatism,\r\nheadache, dropsy, and paralysis. It was a specific against melancholy\r\nand insanity; against the smallpox and the plague, against fever,\r\nasthma and liver troubles. It strengthened the memory and excited\r\nthe imagination, and philosophers and men of science could be, it\r\nwas averred, no better prepared to grapple with the most difficult\r\nof abstract problems than by having the nose primed with snuff.\r\n\r\nThe effects induced by chewing tobacco were said to be even more\r\nmarvelous, for among other things it was claimed that by thus using\r\nit hunger and thirst were allayed or prevented. It removed bile,\r\ncured toothache and freed an over-charged brain from all kinds of\r\ndeleterious humors. It strengthened and preserved the sight. Oil,\r\nextracted from tobacco, cured deafness, gout, sciatica, improved the\r\ncirculation, and was a tonic for the nervous. In a word, it was the\r\ngreat panacea of which physicians and alchemists had so long dreamed,\r\nbut had hitherto been unable to find.\r\n\r\nFinally, however, a reaction came. Books were written against it,\r\nand kings and princes forbade its use. On the 26th of March, 1699,\r\nthe question was seriously discussed before L'Ecole de Médecine\r\nwhether the frequent use of tobacco shortened life--An ex tabaci usu\r\nfrequenti vita summa brevior? And the conclusion was a demonstration\r\nthat the frequent use of tobacco did shorten life. Ergo ex frequenti\r\ntabaci usu vita summa brevior. [20]\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the opinions of learned men and university\r\nfaculties regarding the alleged deleterious properties of tobacco,\r\nand the denunciations hurled against the use of this invention of\r\nthe Evil One, the smoking of cigars and pipes soon became a general\r\nhabit the world over, and, it was at times difficult for the supply\r\nto meet the demand. How little Las Casas dreamed that this \"vicious\r\nhabit,\" as he called it, was soon to become universal, and that the\r\ntime would come when young and old would regard the \"fragrant weed,\"\r\nprepared in one way or another, not only as an indispensable luxury,\r\nbut also as a prime necessity--for rich and poor alike, if life were\r\nto be worth living.\r\n\r\nAnd how far was Columbus from imagining, when he saw the Indians taking\r\n\"their customary smoke,\" that the leaves which they had so carefully\r\nrolled together for this purpose, would eventually prove to be one\r\nof the great staples of commerce, and one of the world's most valued\r\nsources of revenue. He crossed \"the Sea of Darkness\" to discover a\r\ndirect route to the lands of spice and the Golden Chersonese in order\r\nto fill the coffers of the land of his adoption. He and his companions\r\nexplored every island they met in their wanderings in quest of gold\r\nand pearls and precious stones and here, in the narcotic plant, that\r\nappeared to them as little more than a curiosity, there were treasures\r\ngreater than those of \"Ormus and Ind.\" In this very island of Cuba,\r\nof whose charms he has left us so glowing a picture, was in after\r\nyears to be developed from the humble plant--Nicotiana Tabacum--one\r\nof Spain's most important industries--an industry that would, in the\r\ncourse of time, contribute more to the nation's exchequer than the\r\ncombined output of the mines of Pasco and Potosí. Such was evidently\r\nthe thought of the Cuban poet, Zequeira, when, in his much praised\r\nHoratian ode, A La Piña, he sings\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"¡Salve, suelo felíz, donde prodiga\r\n        Madre naturaleza en abundancia\r\n        La ordorifeva planta fumigable!\r\n            ¡Salve, felíz Habana!\" [21]\r\n\r\n\r\nSantiago, like Havana, is a historic city, and, from its foundation,\r\nnearly four centuries ago, until the memorable siege of 1898, it\r\nexperienced many reverses at the hands of privateers and pirates. We\r\nlingered just long enough to see its chief attractions--there are\r\nnot many--outside of the Morro--and to get a view of the now famous\r\nEl Caney and San Juan Hill.\r\n\r\nThe sun was sinking below the horizon when we boarded the steamer\r\nthat was to take us to Haiti and Santo Domingo. As we passed under El\r\nMorro, that has so long and faithfully guarded the entrance to the\r\nplacid harbor, and looked towards the setting sun where Cervera's\r\nproud fleet was scattered, we could not but recall the prophetic\r\nwords of Las Casas penned in his last will and testament. Speaking of\r\nthe Indians, to whose care and protection he had devoted a long and\r\nfruitful life, the holy bishop writes: \"As God is my witness that I\r\nnever had earthly interest in view, I declare it to be my conviction\r\nand my faith--I believe it to be in accordance with the faith of\r\nthe Holy Roman Catholic Church, which is our rule and guide--that\r\nby all the thefts, all the deaths, and all the confiscations of\r\nestates and other uncalculable riches, by the dethroning of rulers\r\nwith unspeakable cruelty, the perfect and immaculate law of Jesus\r\nChrist and the natural law itself have been broken, the name of our\r\nLord and His holy religion have been outraged, the spreading of the\r\nfaith has been retarded, and irreparable harm done to these innocent\r\npeople. Hence I believe that, unless it atones with much penance for\r\nthese abominable and unspeakably wicked deeds, Spain will be visited\r\nby the wrath of God, because the whole nation has shared, more or\r\nless, in the bloody wealth that has been acquired by the slaughter and\r\nextermination of those people. But I fear that it will repent too late,\r\nor never. For God punishes with blindness the sins sometimes of the\r\nlowly, but especially and more frequently the sins of those who think\r\nthemselves wise, and who presume to rule the world. We ourselves are\r\neyewitnesses of this darkening of the understanding. It is now seventy\r\nyears since we began to scandalize, to rob and to murder those peoples,\r\nbut to this day we have not come to realize that so many scandals, so\r\nmuch injustice, so many thefts, so many massacres, so much slavery,\r\nand the depopulation of so many provinces, which have disgraced our\r\nholy religion, are sins or injustices at all.\" [22]\r\n\r\nWere the tragic scenes enacted in these waters and in the harbor of\r\nManila the fulfillment of the prophecy? If we should be disposed to\r\nthink so, let us not forget, in contemplating the humiliation and\r\npunishment of Spain, that we too have sinned as Spain sinned. And\r\nlet us pray that the blood of the millions of Indians that have been\r\nexterminated in our own land may not call down the vengeance of Heaven\r\non our children and our children's children. Nations, like individuals,\r\nare punished where they have sinned. [23]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAITI AND SAN DOMINGO\r\n\r\nA short sail eastwards and we found ourselves crossing the\r\nWindward Passage. Not far from our port quarter was Cape Maisi,\r\nwhich Columbus, on his first voyage, named Cape Alpha and Omega, as\r\nbeing the easternmost extremity of Asia; Alpha, therefore, from his\r\nown point of view, and Omega from that of his Portuguese rivals. On\r\nhis second voyage Columbus came down through this passage to satisfy\r\nhimself that he had actually reached Mangi, the land of the Great Khan,\r\nand coasted along the island of Cuba, as he reckoned, for a thousand\r\nmiles. But as fate would have it, he stopped short in his westward\r\ncourse within a few hours' sail of the present Cape San Antonio,\r\nthe westernmost promontory of the island. If he had only journeyed\r\non a few miles further, he would have detected the insularity of what\r\nhe considered a continent, and thus have anticipated the discoveries\r\nof Vespucius and Ocampo. And he would have done more. He would have\r\nreached the shores of Yucatan and Campeachy and had an opportunity of\r\nexploring the famous ruins of Chichen Itza and Uxmal. How different,\r\ntoo, it would have been, if, after discovering Guanahuani, he had\r\ndirected the prow of the Santa Maria slightly to the northwest, when\r\na short sail would have brought him to the coast of Florida! It is\r\ninteresting to speculate not only how much his own life, but also how\r\ngreatly the entire course of American history would have been affected\r\nby these slight changes in his course on these momentous occasions.\r\n\r\nBut during his four voyages among these mysterious islands the great\r\nnavigator was as one groping his way in the Cretan labyrinth. On his\r\nreturn eastward from the Cape of Good Hope--the name he gave to the\r\nwesternmost point of Cuba attained by him--he found, almost before\r\nhe was aware of it, that he had actually circumnavigated what he had\r\nimagined to be Cipango, the great island of Japan. This surprised\r\nand puzzled him beyond expression. Evidently, either he was mistaken\r\nor the authorities on whom he had been relying were mistaken. If the\r\nisland--Española--was not Cipango, what was it? He soon learned that\r\ngold mines existed in the interior of the country and that there was\r\nevidence of excavations that had been long abandoned. [24] What more\r\nnatural, then, than his conclusion that this was the far-famed Ophir\r\nwhence King Solomon had obtained the gold used in the adornment of\r\nthe temple of Jerusalem!\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said of the Admiral's theory, one thing is certain,\r\nand that is that the discovery of gold in Española [25] was directly or\r\nindirectly the cause of untold misery to the aborigines, and eventually\r\nled up to the present unfortunate condition of this hapless island. It\r\nwas, as the reader knows, the work in the mines that was the chief\r\nfactor in the gradual decimation and the final extinction of the\r\nIndians in Española. When there were no longer Indians to do the work,\r\nnegroes were imported from Africa, and thence dates that hideous period\r\nof cruel traffic in human beings which, for more than three centuries,\r\nwas the blackest stain on the vaunted civilization of the Caucasian\r\nrace. But in this, as in other similar cases, an avenging Nemesis\r\nhas either already overtaken the offending nations or is giving them\r\ngrave concern regarding the future. In the black republics of Haiti and\r\nSanto Domingo the slave has replaced the master, and there are already\r\nindications that the day of reckoning is approaching for the powers\r\nthat are in control of the other islands of the West Indies. We saw\r\nevidences of this during our visit in Cuba, and are convinced that,\r\nif it were not for the strong arm of the United States, it would not\r\nbe long before we should have another black republic at our doors. And\r\nwhat is said of Cuba may be said of all the islands of the Lesser\r\nAntilles from Trinidad to Puerto Rico. The race question is one\r\nthat will have to be met sooner or later. The whites are decreasing\r\nin numbers and the blacks are rapidly increasing and becoming more\r\ninsistent on what they claim to be their rights, especially to that\r\nof a greater representation in government affairs, and to a larger\r\nshare of the emoluments of public office.\r\n\r\nIt was only a few years after the colonizing of Española when negro\r\nslavery was introduced into the island. The motive was, in some\r\nmeasure, a humane one--namely, to spare the Indians the arduous\r\nlabor in the mines for which they were physically incapacitated. The\r\nAfrican was much stronger and had much greater powers of endurance\r\nthan the native. According to Herrera, \"the negroes flourished so\r\nwell in Española, that it was thought that if a negro was not hanged\r\nhe would never die, for no one had ever seen one die of disease. Thus\r\nthe negroes found, like the oranges, a soil in Española better suited\r\nto them than their own country, Guinea.\" [26]\r\n\r\nMonopolies of licenses were granted by the Spanish monarchs for the\r\nimportation of negro slaves to the West Indies, first to their own\r\nsubjects, and later on to certain Genoese and Germans, and finally,\r\nby a special asiento, or contract, the Spanish government conveyed\r\nto the English the \"exclusive right to carry on the most nefarious\r\nof all trades between Africa and Spanish America.\" The British\r\nengaged to transport annually to the Spanish Indies during a term\r\nof thirty years, four thousand and eight hundred of what, in trade\r\nlanguage, were called \"Indian pieces,\" that is to say, negro slaves,\r\npaying a duty per head of thirty-three escudos and one-third. [27]\r\nSo great was the number of negroes imported into America from 1517,\r\nwhen Charles V first permitted the traffic, until 1807, when the slave\r\ntrade was abolished by an act of the English Parliament, that it has\r\nbeen computed that their total number was not less than five or six\r\nmillions. In one single year, 1768, it is said that the number torn\r\nfrom their homes and country and transported to Spain's new colonies\r\nwas no less than ninety-seven thousand. [28]\r\n\r\nBut the inevitable soon came to pass--much sooner than even the wisest\r\nstatesman could have foreseen. The great Cardinal Ximenes, it is true,\r\nrealized from the beginning the risk incurred by sending negroes to\r\nthe Indies. He contended that it was wrong to send beyond the ocean\r\npeople so \"apt in war\" as the blacks, who might at any time stir up\r\na servile war against Spanish rule. He insisted that \"the negroes,\r\nwho were as malicious as they were strong, would no sooner perceive\r\nthemselves to be more numerous in the New World than the Spaniards,\r\nthan they would lay their heads together to put on their masters the\r\nchains they now carried.\" [29]\r\n\r\nThe cardinal's prediction soon came true. In all parts of the\r\nIndies--in the islands of the sea and on Tierra Firme--there\r\nwere massacres and uprisings and \"servile wars,\" without number,\r\nand both the colonies and the mother country had often occasion to\r\nregret the introduction within their boundaries of so dangerous and\r\nwarlike subjects. But it was too late to rectify the mistake. It\r\nwas impossible to drive them out of the country, or to return them\r\nto the land whence they had been brought against their will. So\r\nrapidly had they increased in numbers that they now, in many places,\r\nconstituted a great majority of the population. Española, to-day\r\nconstituting the two republics of Haiti and Santo Domingo, was the\r\nfirst island of which they got supreme control. Which will be the\r\nnext? The question is not an idle one. It is one frequently asked\r\nin the West Indies. The unrest and agitation of the blacks are much\r\ngreater than we in the North imagine. Their ambition is greater and\r\ntheir political aspirations higher than those who have not been among\r\nthem are prepared to admit. The situation is certainly not one that\r\njustifies supine indifference on the part of the governments now in\r\ncontrol, nor is the difficulty one whose solution can be indefinitely\r\npostponed. Every lover of law and order must hope that some modus\r\nvivendi can be arrived at whereby, while all the legitimate claims\r\nof the negro are conceded, the world will he spared another \"decline\r\nand fall\" like that which has been witnessed in Española.\r\n\r\nWe called at several of the ports of Haiti and Santo Domingo but we\r\nfound little to interest us outside of the capital of the latter\r\nrepublic. Santo Domingo is not only the oldest city in the New\r\nWorld--the early abandoned settlement of Isabella never deserved the\r\nname of city--but is, in many respects, the most interesting. Founded\r\nby Bartholomew Columbus in 1496, and named Santo Domingo after the\r\npatron saint of his father, Domenico, it was, for a while, the seat\r\nof the vice-royalty. It was to this place that Don Diego Colon, the\r\nson of the Admiral, brought his lovely bride, Doña Maria de Toledo,\r\na daughter of one of the oldest and proudest families of Spain. Here\r\nhe set up a vice-regal court that excited the envy of his enemies,\r\nand was by them made the basis of charges preferred against him that\r\nhe meditated establishing a government independent of the mother\r\ncountry. Of the viceroy's palace, Oviedo writes to Charles V, it\r\n\"seemeth unto me so magnificall and princelyke that yowr maiestie\r\nmaye bee as well lodged therin as in any of the mooste exquisite\r\nbuilded houses of Spayne.\" [30]\r\n\r\nFrom Santo Domingo radiated the lines of discovery and conquest that\r\nculminated in the achievements of Cortes, Balboa and Pizarro. Here\r\nColumbus was loaded with chains and imprisoned by Bobadilla. Here was\r\nestablished the first university of the New World. Here, within the\r\nwalls of the Convent of San Domingo, prayed and labored that noble\r\n\"Protector of the Indians,\" Las Casas, and here he planned and began\r\nwork on his monumental Historia de las Indias. Until the last assault\r\nby Drake in 1586, it was the centre of commercial activity in the\r\nIndies, for it was the chief port of call to and from Spain and\r\nthe place where merchants, miners, and planters disposed of their\r\ncommodities and amassed fortunes.\r\n\r\nBut Santo Domingo's halcyon days were of short duration. Before the\r\nend of the sixteenth century the city began to decline. The theatre of\r\nactivity, that had hitherto been confined to Española, was transferred\r\nto Cuba and Mexico, Panama and Peru, and to-day the once gay and\r\nprosperous capital exhibits but a shadow of its pristine glory.\r\n\r\nHomenage Castle, the crumbling palace of Don Diego Columbus, and the\r\nfew churches and monasteries that still, even in their neglected\r\ncondition, attest the former importance of the place, present a\r\npathetic picture, and tell, in mute but elegant language, of the\r\nreverses and evil days that have been the lot of America's first city.\r\n\r\nBesides the buildings just named we were especially interested in the\r\nCathedral. It is a noble structure and its interior decorations compare\r\nfavorably with similar edifices in Spain and Mexico. But there was one\r\nattraction there that had for us, as it must have for all Americans,\r\na special interest, and which alone would well repay a pilgrimage to\r\nSanto Domingo--the last resting place of the one \"who to Castile and\r\nLeon gave a new world.\"\r\n\r\nAs the reader is aware, there has been a long and spirited controversy\r\nas to the location of los restos--the remains--of the illustrious\r\ndiscoverer. We have been shown his sepulchre in the Cathedral\r\nof Havana, and in that of Seville, yet it has been demonstrated\r\nbeyond question that his ashes have never reposed in either of these\r\nplaces. Without entering into details, it may now be stated, as facts\r\nwhich no longer admit of any reasonable doubt, that after his death\r\nin 1506, the remains of Columbus were interred in the Franciscan\r\nmonastery of Valladolid, whence, in 1508, they were transferred to\r\nthe monastery of Las Cuevas, at Seville. In 1541, at the request of\r\n\"Doña Maria of Toledo, Vicereine of the Indies, wife that was of the\r\nAdmiral Don Diego Columbus,\" Charles V, by a special cedula, granted\r\npermission for the transfer of the remains of Christopher Columbus\r\nto Española, to be interred in the capilla mayor of the Cathedral of\r\nSanto Domingo. Here they have since reposed, with the exception of\r\nthe short time during which they were kept in the adjoining church,\r\nwhen the Cathedral was undergoing certain necessary repairs in 1877\r\nand 1878. The supposed remains of the first Admiral, that were taken\r\nto Havana in 1795, and finally transferred to Seville in 1899, have\r\nbeen shown to be those of his son, Don Diego, who, together with Don\r\nLuis Columbus, the third Admiral, and the first Duke of Veragua, was\r\nalso buried in the capilla mayor of the Cathedral, where the remains\r\nof Don Luis still lie near those of his illustrious grandfather. [31]\r\n\r\nAs our steamer moved out of the water of Santo Domingo our eyes\r\nremained fixed on the Cathedral, whose Spanish tiled roof reflected\r\nthe vermilion rays of the setting sun, and afford shelter for one of\r\nthe world's greatest heroes and benefactors.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"Hic locus abscondit præclari membra Coloni,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis place hides the remains of the illustrious Columbus, of him who,\r\nin the language of one of the many epitaphs devoted to his memory,\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"Dió riquezas immensas á la tierra,\r\n        Innumerables almas al cielo.\" [32]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then, as the last vestiges of this noble old temple vanished\r\nfrom our vision, we thought of the words of Humboldt, than whom no\r\none was better qualified to pronounce a fitting eulogy on one of the\r\nworld's immortals.\r\n\r\n\"The majesty of great memories,\" he declares, \"seems concentrated\r\nin the name of Christopher Columbus. It is the originality of his\r\nvast conceptions, the compass and fertility of his genius, and the\r\ncourage which bore out against the long series of misfortunes, which\r\nhave exalted the Admiral high above all his contemporaries.\" [33]\r\n\r\nAnd we dreamed--or was it a telepathic intimation of a future\r\nreality?--when the precious remains, that have so long been guarded\r\nin this distant and rarely visited island, should be transferred for\r\na third and a last time, but this time where they might be visited\r\nand venerated by millions instead of the few hundred that now find\r\ntheir way hither, and where they might occupy a noble sarcophagus,\r\nlike that which beneath the dome of the Invalides, holds all that is\r\nmortal of the great Corsican, and in a temple worthy alike of the\r\nman and of the greatest nation in the world. There is one edifice\r\nin which all the nations of the hemisphere discovered by Columbus\r\nhave a common interest, the splendid structure now being erected in\r\nWashington, for the special use and benefit of the North and South\r\nAmerican Republics. Here in the capital of the nation, in the district\r\nnamed after the discoverer, in sight of the tomb of the \"Father of\r\nhis Country,\" should the remains of \"The Admiral of the Ocean Sea,\"\r\nfind an abiding place of sepulture commensurate with the magnitude of\r\nhis achievements. Alongside and in connection with this Pan-American\r\nbuilding, in the heart of what is to be \"the City Beautiful,\" and\r\nthere alone, let there be erected a mausoleum that, as a monument of\r\nart, shall rank, as did those of Hadrian and Mausolus, amongst the\r\nworld's wonders, and be a fitting culmination of the architectural\r\ncreations that have been planned for the great and growing capital\r\nof the New World, the world of Columbus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUERTO RICO AND CURAÇAO\r\n\r\nFrom Santo Domingo we went to Puerto Rico. As is well known,\r\nthis island was discovered by Columbus during his second voyage in\r\n1493. Sixteen years later a settlement was founded here by Ponce de\r\nLeon. It was from here that he set forth in quest of the \"Fountain\r\nof Youth,\" and it is in San Juan, in the Church of Santo Domingo,\r\nthat he was buried after a poisoned arrow from the bow of an Indian\r\nbrave had terminated his existence during his second expedition to\r\nFlorida. Over his tomb was inscribed the following epitaph:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"Mole sub hac fortis requiescunt ossa Leonis\r\n        Qui vicit factis nomina magna suis.\" [34]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter sojourning a week in Puerto Rico, we called at the little Dutch\r\nisland Curaçao and spent the greater part of the day in the quaint\r\nlittle town of Willemstad. The harbor is perfectly landlocked and was\r\nat one time the favorite rendezvous for pirates and buccaneers. In\r\nstrolling through its streets, we could easily fancy ourselves in\r\nsome quiet section of Rotterdam or Amsterdam. The island is known for\r\nits much prized liqueur, Curaçao, which, however, strange to say,\r\nis not made here but in Holland. Curaçao supplies only the orange\r\nrind with which the liqueur is flavored. Willemstad is a popular\r\nresort for smugglers, who do an extensive business on the mainland,\r\nand the temporary home of a colony of exiled Venezuelan generals and\r\ncolonels, who here eke out a precarious existence in the hope that\r\none of their periodical revolutions may soon give them the eagerly\r\ndesired opportunity of enjoying some of the spoils of office, that,\r\nfor the time being, are monopolized by their enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE SPANISH MAIN\r\n\r\nWe arrived in the roadstead of La Guayra early in the morning, after\r\nour departure from Curaçao, and our vessel was soon moored alongside a\r\nsplendid breakwater, which extends out from the shore for more than\r\na half mile, and gives this port a fairly good harbor, which even\r\nthe largest ships may enter. We were now on the Spanish Main where\r\nwe had our first view of the great continent of South America.\r\n\r\nAs the phrase, \"The Spanish Main,\" has been given many and different\r\nsignifications since it was first introduced, I shall employ it,\r\nin what was long its generally accepted meaning, as designating\r\nthe southern part of the Caribbean Sea, and the coast line of what,\r\non the early maps of South America, was known as Tierra Firme--the\r\nFirm Land--namely, that part of the present republics of Venezuela\r\nand Colombia on which the Spaniards effected their first settlements.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to attract our attention and that which impressed\r\nus most, was the apparently stupendous height of the mountains in\r\nthe rear of the town. Before us were La Silla and Pico de Naiguata,\r\nsheer and precipitous, rising almost from the water's edge and piercing\r\nthe clouds at an altitude of more than eight thousand and two hundred\r\nfeet. They are thus apparently higher than any of the peaks of the\r\nRocky Mountain chain. The summits of the latter are attained only\r\nafter traveling over a long and gradual incline, that is scarcely\r\nperceptible, and after scaling numerous foothills that conceal and\r\ndwarf the giants which tower behind and above them. Thus, while the\r\nsummit of Pike's Peak is more then fourteen thousand feet above sea\r\nlevel, it is less than seven thousand feet above the charming town of\r\nManitou, that nestles at its feet. For this reason, and because the\r\nsides of the Colorado peak are not so steep as those behind La Guayra,\r\nLa Silla and the Pico de Naiguata give an impression of height and\r\nmajesty that is not experienced even when contemplating the loftiest\r\nmonarchs of the Alps.\r\n\r\nThe distance from La Guayra to Caracas, in a straight line, is less\r\nthan six miles; by rail it is twenty-three. There has been talk\r\nof connecting the capital and its port by a tunnel but under the\r\nexisting conditions of the country it will be a long time before such\r\nan undertaking shall be realized.\r\n\r\nFrom sea level to the summit of the range, the railroad is conspicuous\r\nfor its heavy grade--about four per cent.--its sharp curves, its cuts\r\nand tunnels, but above all for the magnificent scenery everywhere\r\nvisible. From the car window one may look over precipitous cliffs\r\ninto yawning abysses far below the track on which the train slowly\r\nand carefully winds its way. On the beetling rocks above, in the dark\r\nand wild gorge below--what a wealth of vegetation, what luxuriance\r\nof growth, what a gorgeous display of vari-colored fruit and flower,\r\nof delicate fern and majestic palm!\r\n\r\nAs a feat of engineering the road is quite equal to any of the kind\r\nthat may be seen in Europe or the United States; but for scenic beauty\r\nand splendor it is absolutely unrivaled. On the lofty flanks of the\r\nRockies, and in the deep cañons of the Fraser and Colorado rivers,\r\nwhere the shrill whistle of the locomotive startles the falcon and\r\nthe eagle, one can have fully gratified one's sense of the grand and\r\nthe sublime in nature; but here it is beauty, grandeur, sublimity\r\nall combined. And what marvelous perspectives, what delightful\r\nexhibitions of color, what superb and ever-changing effects of light\r\nand shade--scenes that would be the despair of Claude Lorrain and\r\nSalvator Rosa, and as difficult to catch on canvas as the glories of\r\nthe setting sun.\r\n\r\nNo where else in the wide world can one find such another picture as\r\ngreets one's vision when, rising into cloudland, one gets one's last\r\nview of the Caribbean circling the mountain thousands of feet beneath\r\nthe silent and awe-stricken spectator. It is matchless, unique--like\r\nRaphael's Madonna di San Xysto, impossible to duplicate.\r\n\r\nAs we reached this point, the sea disclosed itself as a vast mirror\r\nresplendent under the aureate glow of the quivering beams of the\r\ndeparting lord of day. Fleecy clouds of every form and hue flitting\r\nover sea and land, by a peculiar optical illusion, magnified both\r\nobjects and distances, and unfolded before the astonished beholder\r\na panorama of constantly varying magnitude and of surpassing\r\nloveliness. On the foreground Nature shed her brightest green, and\r\nimparted to flower and foliage the flush of the rainbow. Of a truth,\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"Never did Ariel's plume\r\n        At golden sunset hover\r\n        O'er scenes so full of bloom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAway and beyond was the boundless, glimmering sea, ravishing in\r\nits thousand tints, and in its harmonious dance of vanishing light\r\nand color.\r\n\r\nSo occupied were we in observing the beauties of the everchanging\r\nlandscape, that, before we realized it, we were in Caracas. And so\r\nmomentary was the twilight-- a characteristic of the tropics--that the\r\ntransition from daylight to darkness was almost startling. We found an\r\nunexpected compensation, however, in the friendly glow of the electric\r\nlights which illumine the street and plazas of Venezuela's capital.\r\n\r\nWe spent a month in and about Caracas, finding every hour enjoyable. It\r\nis, in many respects, a beautiful city and located near the base of\r\nthe mountains La Silla, the saddle--from its fancied resemblance to\r\nan army saddle--and El Cerro de Avila, in a charming valley from one\r\nto three miles wide and about ten miles long. The valley was at one\r\ntime, seemingly, the bed of a lake, and its soil is, consequently,\r\nexceedingly fertile, and admirably adapted to cultivation of the farm\r\nand garden produce of both tropical and temperate climates.\r\n\r\nA friend, who had traveled much, once told us that he regarded\r\nTaormina, in Sicily, as the best and most beautiful winter resort\r\nin the world. We are familiar with both places, and can say, in all\r\ncandor, that we prefer Caracas. True, Taormina is one of the beauty\r\nspots of the world, but one expects to find more than beauty in a\r\nwinter resort. Some years before our visit to Caracas we were in\r\nTaormina, and during the same time of the winter as marked our visit\r\nto Caracas, and we found it so cold that, during our entire stay, we\r\nwere obliged to have our rooms heated by steam. In the latter place we\r\ncould leave the doors and windows of our room open day and night, and\r\nenjoyed, during all the time we tarried there, the name soft, balmy,\r\nfragrant air, and the same equable temperature. The mean temperature\r\nwe found to be about 70° F., the thermometer seldom rising above 75°\r\nF. and rarely falling below 65° F. The only place where we over had a\r\nlike experience was on the slope of a mountain in one of the Hawaiian\r\nIslands, where the temperature is so constant that the native language\r\nhas no word to express the idea of weather--what we call \"weather\"\r\nbeing always the same.\r\n\r\nConsidering the many natural beauties of the valley of Caracas,\r\nits rich, tropical vegetation, its matchless climate, its soft,\r\nbalmy atmosphere, the rippling brooks and purling rivulets that\r\neverywhere gladden the landscape, we can understand how an early\r\nSpanish historian, Oviedo y Baños, [35] was in his enthusiasm led to\r\ndeclare this location of the capital of Venezuela to be that of the\r\nhome of perpetual spring--nay, more, that of a terrestrial paradise. If\r\nhe could revisit these scenes to-day, he would find but little change\r\nin their general physical aspect, but he would see at once that the\r\nserpent's trailing has cast a blight over its former beauty, and that\r\nthe people, as a whole, have sadly degenerated since his time. Then,\r\nas he tells us, the stranger that had spent two months in this Eden\r\nwould never wish to leave it. Alas, that one cannot say this now! [36]\r\n\r\nAfter a month's sojourn in Caracas we felt the Spiritus movendi again\r\nupon us, urging us onward, we knew not whither. We were under the\r\nspell of what the Germans so aptly call the Wanderlust and it did\r\nnot make much difference what direction we took so long as the road\r\nwe traveled enabled us to enjoy new scenes and visit peoples whose\r\nmanners and customs were different from our own.\r\n\r\nHaving thoroughly rested and recuperated the strength we so much\r\nneeded, we felt that we should like to take a trip to the Orinoco,\r\nin order that we might have an opportunity of studying the fauna and\r\nflora of its wonderful valley and of meeting some of the many Indian\r\ntribes that rove through its forests. In spite of all our efforts,\r\nhowever, we could find no one who could give us any satisfactory\r\ninformation about the best means of reaching the river or the time\r\nthat would be required to make the journey. We consulted government\r\nofficials and merchants that had business relations along the Orinoco,\r\nbut their information was vague and contradictory.\r\n\r\nWe purposed going first to San Fernando de Apure, on an affluent\r\nof the Orinoco, and thence by water to Ciudad Bolivar and the\r\nPort-of-Spain. We were told that there were steamers plying between San\r\nFernando and Ciudad Bolivar--the chief city on the Orinoco--during the\r\nwet season, our summer, but not during the dry season, our winter. That\r\nmeant that if we went to San Fernando we should be obliged to use\r\na canoe to reach Ciudad Bolivar, and this implied a long, tiresome,\r\nand somewhat dangerous voyage under a burning sun and in what we were\r\nassured was a malarious region. The time necessary to reach the river\r\non horseback varied, according to our informants, from one to two\r\nweeks. One well known general, it was stated, had by an extraordinary\r\ntour de force made the trip the preceding year in four days. Some\r\nassured us we could go by carriage the entire distance. Others were\r\nequally positive that there was nothing more than a trail connecting\r\nthe points we wished to visit, and that mules would be better than\r\nhorses for such a journey. Outside of one or two small towns, there\r\nwere no hotels along the route. But this did not matter. We had our\r\ncamping outfit with us, and rather preferred to live in our tent to\r\nrisking our night's rest in such uninviting posadas--lodging houses--as\r\nwe should meet with in the way.\r\n\r\nFinding that we could not get in Caracas the information we desired,\r\nwe resolved to go to Victoria, an interesting town southwest of the\r\ncapital, and accessible by rail in a few hours. But our success in\r\nVictoria was no better than it had been in Caracas. In spite of all\r\nour efforts we could elicit no information that would warrant us in\r\nstarting on so long a journey as that to the Orinoco, and one that\r\nmight involve many hardships and dangers without adequate compensation.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding our ill success so far, we did not for a moment\r\nthink of abandoning our contemplated trip to the valley of the\r\nOrinoco. Far from it. The more we thought of it the more fascinating\r\nthe project became. Now that we had gone so far, we were determined to\r\nsee the famous river at all hazards. If we could not reach it by one\r\nroute we would go by another. We accordingly concluded to continue\r\nour journey by rail to Puerto Cabello, and thence go by steamer to\r\nTrinidad. Once there, we felt reasonably sure we should find some\r\nmeans of attaining our goal--the grassy plains and vast forests of\r\nthe Orinoco basin. As proved by subsequent events, it was for us\r\na most fortunate occurrence that we did not adhere to our original\r\nplan of reaching the Orinoco by San Fernando de Apure, as our change\r\nof programme enabled us to see far more of South America and under\r\nmore favorable auspices, than we had before deemed possible.\r\n\r\nInstead of going directly to Puerto Cabello, we spent a week at\r\nthe quiet old city of Valencia, Nueva Valencia del Rey, as it was\r\noriginally called, and which, according to the Valencianos, should\r\nbe the capital of the republic. It was begun in 1555, by Alonzo Diaz\r\nMoreno, twelve years before Santiago de Leon de Caracas--the original\r\nname of the capital--was founded by Diego de Losada. As a matter\r\nof fact, Valencia was designated as the capital of Venezuela at the\r\ntime of the revolt against Spain, and congress was actually in session\r\nthere at the time Caracas was destroyed by an earthquake in 1812. Five\r\nyears after its foundation, Valencia was captured by the infamous Lopez\r\nde Aguirre and his sanguinary band, who treated its inhabitants with\r\nthe greatest atrocity. Near by, on the plains of Carabobo, was fought\r\nthe decisive victory which resulted in Venezuelan independence. [37]\r\n\r\nAs a port of entry, Puerto Cabello is incomparably superior to\r\nLa Guayra, and has one of the finest harbors on the Caribbean. The\r\nclimate, however, is far from salubrious. Situated, as it is, in low,\r\nmarshy ground, surrounded by countless pools of stagnant water,\r\nit is not surprising to find that malarial fevers are prevalent\r\nhere, and that El vómito--yellow fever--is a frequent visitant. The\r\n\"nymphs that reign o'er sewers and sinks\" can here count more fetid\r\neffluvia and putrefactive ferments than in any place we had so far\r\nseen in Venezuela.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEARL COAST\r\n\r\nA most delightful voyage was ours from Puerto Cabello to the\r\nPort-of-Spain, the capital of Trinidad. The sea was as placid as an\r\ninland lake on a windless day, and the air as balmy as in a morning\r\nof June. The coast of the mainland was nearly always in sight,\r\nand at times the peaks of the Coast Range rose far above the fleecy\r\nclouds that encircled their lofty flanks. The days were beautiful\r\nbut the nights were glorious. All our youthful dreams about the\r\ndelights of sailing on southern seas, amid emerald isles, and under\r\nbright starlit skies, where soft spice-scented zephyrs blow, were\r\nhere realized. The serenity and transparency of the azure vault of\r\nheaven, with its countless shooting stars, had their counterpart in\r\nthe smooth, unruffled Caribbean, to whose water millions of Noctilucæ\r\nimparted a phosphorescent glow which rivaled that of molten gold. We\r\nwere at last in the favored home of the chambered nautilus, happily,\r\ndreamily gliding along on an even keel\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"In gulfs enchanted, where the siren sings,\r\n          And coral reefs lie bare,\r\n        Where the cold sea-maids rise from crystal springs\r\n          To sun their streaming hair.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, we were skirting along the Pearl Coast, [38] celebrated in legend\r\nand story--darkened by deeds of barbarous cruelty and resplendent\r\nin records of heroic achievement. I shall not tell of our second\r\nvisit to La Guayra and of the day we spent at Macuto or describe the\r\npresent conditions of the historic old towns of Barcelona, Cumana and\r\nCarupano, which lay on our course. Much might be said of all these\r\nplaces, distinguished, since their foundation, both in peace and war.\r\n\r\nI cannot, however, pass this part of the Pearl Coast without recalling\r\nthe fact that it was near Cumana that the earliest settlements in\r\nVenezuela were effected and that here it was that one of the first--if\r\nnot the first--permanent colonies on the mainland of the New World was\r\nestablished. Columbus, during his fourth voyage, attempted to make a\r\nsettlement in Veragua, that might serve as a base of future operations,\r\nbut the attempt resulted in complete failure. Similar efforts had been\r\nmade by Alonso de Ojeda and others, but without lasting results. Panama\r\nwas not founded until 1516 or 1517. Nombre de Dios, it is true, was\r\nfounded somewhat earlier, but in the beginning was little more than\r\na blockhouse. But here, as early in 1514, on the Rio Manzanares,\r\nthen the River Cumana, only \"a cross-bow-shot\" from the shore, the\r\nzealous Sons of St. Francis had erected a monastery, and a short time\r\nsubsequently the Dominicans established another monastery, not far\r\ndistant, at Santa Fe de Chiribichi. Here they gathered the simple\r\nchildren of the forest around them, and soon had the beginnings\r\nof flourishing missions. [39] The trusting and unspoiled Indians\r\nwelcomed these apostles of the gospel of peace and love, and soon\r\nlearned to regard them as friends and fathers. So peaceful did all\r\nthis land become under the influence of the benign teaching of the\r\ngentle friars, that, according to Oviedo and Las Casas, a Christian\r\ntrader could go alone anywhere without ever being molested. [40]\r\n\r\nIt was to the Pearl Coast that Las Casas came, after he found, by\r\nsad experience, that his efforts in behalf of the Indians in Cuba,\r\nEspañola and Puerto Rico were frustrated by influences he was unable\r\nto control. It was here, aided by Franciscans and Dominicans, who had\r\npreceded him by only a few years, that he purposed laying the corner\r\nstone of that vast Indian commonwealth, for which he had secured\r\nletters patent from Charles V.\r\n\r\nFor this great experiment in colonization, the greatest the world\r\nhas ever known, he had received a grant of land extending from\r\nParia to Santa Marta, and from the Caribbean Sea to Peru. In his\r\ncolossal undertaking he planned to have the coöperation of an order\r\nof knights--the Knights of the Golden Spur--specially created to\r\naid him in the work of civilizing and christianizing the Indians. It\r\nwas his dream to bring within the fold of the Church all the Indians\r\nof Central and South America, and to establish for their behoof and\r\nbenefit an ideal Christian state such as a century and a half later\r\nwas realized in the fertile basins of the Parana and Paraguay. [41]\r\n\r\nIf the noble philanthropist had been properly supported by the rich and\r\nthe powerful, the entire course of subsequent events in South America\r\nwould have been altered, and the historian would have been spared the\r\ntask of penning those dark annals of injustice and iniquity which,\r\nfor long centuries, were such a foul blot on humanity. But from the\r\ntime he set foot on the Pearl Coast, in pursuance of his noble plan,\r\nhe found himself beset by untold difficulties, and his designs thwarted\r\nat every turn, and that, too, by his own countrymen. Blinded by lust\r\nof gold and pleasure, they left nothing undone to insure the failure\r\nof his project, and in the end succeeded in their nefarious purpose.\r\n\r\nAbandoned by those on whose coöperation he fully relied, he was, in its\r\nvery inception, forced to relinquish his heroic enterprise, and return\r\nto Española. Discomfited and heartsick, but not crushed, he sought\r\nan asylum in the monastery of Santo Domingo. There for eight years\r\nhe devoted himself to prayer and study, and, true Christian athlete\r\nthat he was, he was always preparing himself for a final struggle in\r\na new arena. When his enemies least expected it, he came forth from\r\nhis retirement, and, clad in the habit of a Dominican, proclaimed\r\nhimself again the champion of the downtrodden Indian. And from that\r\nmoment until the day of his death, at the advanced age of ninety-two,\r\nwhether as a simple monk or as the bishop of Chiapa, [42] his voice\r\nwas always raised in behalf of the children of the forest, and against\r\ntheir enslavement by cruel, soulless seekers after fortune. [43]\r\n\r\nHe was, if not the first, the world's greatest abolitionist, and if\r\nthere are still many millions of red men in the New World to-day\r\nwho have escaped the bond of servitude, it is mainly due to their\r\nillustrious protector, Bartolomé de Las Casas. [44]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEARL ISLANDS\r\n\r\nWithin sight of the land where Las Casas went to lay the first\r\nfoundation-stone of his ideal commonwealth is a group of islands\r\nwhich had a special claim on our attention--islands which, during\r\nfour centuries, have been the scene of many a romance and have been\r\nstained, no one can tell how often, by the blood of tragedy.\r\n\r\nThese islands are Coche, Cubagua and Margarita. They were discovered\r\nby Columbus during his third voyage, and the larger of the two was\r\ncalled Margarita--pearl--from the number and beauty of the pearls\r\nfound in the waters that wash its shore. Even before he had left the\r\nGulf of Paria, between Trinidad and the mainland, he had observed\r\nthat the aborigines of Tierra Firme were decked with bracelets and\r\nnecklaces of pearl, and soon discovered, to his great satisfaction,\r\nthat these much-prized gems could be obtained in great abundance,\r\nand that many of them were of extraordinary size and beauty. Peter\r\nMartyr, as translated by Eden, tells us, \"Many of these pearls were\r\nas bygge as hasellnuttes, and oriente (as we caule it), that is lyke\r\nunto them of the Easte partes.\" [45] During the first third of the\r\nsixteenth century the value of the pearls sent to Europe was equal\r\nto nearly one-half of the output of all the mines in America. [46]\r\nIn one year--1587--after the pearl fisheries of the Gulf of Panama\r\nhad been discovered, nearly seven hundred pounds weight of pearls\r\nwas sent to the markets of Europe, some of them rivaling in beauty\r\nof sheen and perfection of form the rarest gems ever found in the\r\nwaters of Persia or Ceylon. It was from these fisheries of the New\r\nWorld that Philip II obtained the famous pearl, weighing two hundred\r\nand fifty carats, of the size and shape of a pigeon's egg, mentioned\r\nby the early chroniclers.\r\n\r\nSo great was the commercial activity among these little islands,\r\nespecially in Cubagua, that the Spaniards built a town there, which\r\nthey called New Cadiz, although the site chosen was without water,\r\nand so sterile that the Indians had never lived on it. Toward the end\r\nof the sixteenth century the pearl fishery in these parts diminished\r\nrapidly, and in the early part of the century following, the industry,\r\naccording to Laet, had died out altogether, and the islands of Coche\r\nand Cubagua fell into oblivion. But while it lasted, sad to say,\r\nit meant untold misery for the thousands of Indian and Negro slaves\r\nwho were forced, at the sacrifice of their health and often of their\r\nlives, to enrich their cruel masters by work that was almost as fatal\r\nas that in the mines of Española.\r\n\r\nFor more than two hundred years the pearl fisheries in the waters\r\naround these islands were practically abandoned. Even during the last\r\ncentury comparatively little work was done to develop an industry\r\nthat, during the sixteenth century, contributed so much to the\r\ncoffers of Spain. About the year 1900, however, a French company\r\nsecured a concession from Venezuela to fish in the neighborhood of\r\nthese islands. According to agreement, it is to pay the government\r\nten per cent. royalty, and to employ divers and diving apparatus so\r\nas to select only the larger oysters and avoid the destruction of\r\nthose that are immature.\r\n\r\nFrom the estimates available, about $600,000 worth of pearls are\r\nannually sent to the Paris market from Margarita. While a large\r\nproportion of them are cracked and of poor color, there are,\r\nnevertheless, many of the finest orient, and these find ready\r\npurchasers. As for ourselves, we saw few of large size, and none of\r\ngreat value. Even in Caracas, where we made diligent inquiry about\r\nthem, we did not find a single one from these waters that would\r\nattract attention for either size or lustre. [47]\r\n\r\nThe weather could not have been more delightful than it was during\r\nour all too brief cruise among these islands around which at one time,\r\nas has been truly remarked, \"all the wonder, all the pity and all the\r\ngreed of the age had concentrated itself.\" They are now shorn of all\r\ntheir former glory, and there is little to indicate their pristine\r\nimportance. They are practically deserted, with the exception of\r\nMargarita, which, on account of the arid and unproductive soil,\r\nis but sparsely inhabited. And yet, as they lay clustered there on\r\nthe calm bosom of the Caribbean, without a ripple to disturb its\r\nmirror-like surface, they possessed a certain undefinable beauty\r\nthat defied analysis. Besides, there was still hovering over and\r\naround them the glamour of days long past, when they were visited\r\nfor the first time by the great Admiral of the Ocean Sea, and later\r\non, by Cristobal Guerra and Alonzo Niño, and by Francisco Orellana,\r\nafter his memorable voyage down the Amazon.\r\n\r\nThe sun was sloping down to his ocean bed--the air was glimmering with\r\na mellow light, as we drifted from these waters over which Merlin\r\nseemed to wave his enchanting wand. As the orb of day touched the\r\ndistant horizon, and sank into the crimson mist that floated above\r\nthe placid sea, it assumed strange oval and pear-shaped figures that\r\ngrew larger in their waning splendor. The rainbow hues that steeped\r\nin molten lustre the receding shores seemed to float on clouds from\r\nspirit-land.\r\n\r\nA scene it was to swell the tamest bosom, a fairy realm where Fancy\r\nwould\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"Bid the blue Tritons sound their twisted shells,\r\n          And call the Nereids from their pearly cells.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow us, beneath the dark depths of the crystal sea, illumined by\r\nthe lamps of the sea-nymphs, were living flower beds of coral, the\r\nblooms and the palms of the ocean recesses, where the pearl lies hid,\r\nand caves where the gem is sleeping, the gardens, fair and bewildering\r\nin their richness and beauty, of Nereus and Amphitrite. It was indeed\r\nsuch a scene as the poet has painted for us in these charming verses:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"Wherever you wander the sea is in sight,\r\n        With its changeable turquoise green and blue,\r\n        And its strange transparence of limpid light.\r\n        You can watch the work that the Nereids do\r\n        Down, down, where their purple fans unfurl,\r\n        Planting their coral and sowing their pearl.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTRINIDAD AND THE ORINOCO\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            \"The battle's rage\r\n                Was like the strife which currents wage,\r\n                Where Orinoco, in his pride,\r\n                Rolls to the main no tribute tide,\r\n                But 'gainst broad ocean urges far\r\n                A rival sea of roaring war;\r\n                While in ten thousand eddies driven,\r\n                The billows fling their foam to heaven,\r\n                And the pilot seeks in vain,\r\n                Where rolls the river, where the main.\" [48]\r\n\r\n                                                            --Scott.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND OF THE BLESSED TRINITY\r\n\r\nThe morning following our departure from the Pearl Islands we were\r\ndelighted to find our good ship anchored in the beautiful Gulf of\r\nParia. Thus, almost before we were aware of it, we found ourselves\r\nreposing on the waters of the famed Orinoco which we had made such\r\nfutile efforts to reach from Caracas and Victoria. The Gulf of Paria,\r\nas is known, is just north of several of the largest estuaries of the\r\nOrinoco and the line of demarcation between the salt water of the\r\nAtlantic and the fresh water of Venezuela's great river is usually\r\nquite marked. As we entered the gulf, through the Dragon's Mouth,\r\nwe had the mainland on our starboard and the island of Trinidad on\r\nour port quarter. Although the waters of the Orinoco now enter the\r\nAtlantic through two channels--the Boca del Draco and the Boca de la\r\nSierpe--there is no doubt that Trinidad was in recent geological times\r\na part of the mainland of South America and that the Orinoco, instead\r\nof reaching the ocean, as it now does, flowed almost directly across\r\nthe island through a depression which is still quite conspicuous. It\r\nwill thus be seen that during long geologic ages there has been an\r\nintimate physical connection between Trinidad and the Orinoco as\r\nthere has been a close commercial connection between the two ever\r\nsince the Spanish conquest.\r\n\r\nOwing to the shallow waters of the harbor of the Port-of-Spain,\r\nthe capital of Trinidad, our steamer had to anchor about a mile from\r\nthe quay. When we were prepared to go ashore--and we lost no time in\r\ngetting ready--we were surrounded by a motley crowd of sable, shouting,\r\nimportunate boatmen, all clamoring and gesticulating and sounding the\r\npraises of their canoes, and calling attention to their fantastic\r\nnames, as if this were a guarantee of their safety and comfort. In\r\na few moments we were seated in one of these gayly decked craft,\r\nwith our baggage beside us, on our way to the customhouse. Here we\r\nwere delayed only a few minutes, for the English in their colonies,\r\nas in the mother country, rarely subject the traveler to those\r\ndelays and annoyances that constitute so disagreeable a feature in\r\ncertain other countries. \"What a contrast,\" we said to ourselves,\r\n\"between the conduct of the officials here and that of the officious\r\ninquisitors at La Guayra!\"\r\n\r\nAfter we had been comfortably located in our hotel--there are several\r\ngood hotels in the city--our first thought was about our journey up\r\nthe Orinoco. To our great delight we learned that there would be a\r\nsteamer going to Ciudad Bolivar in about a week. This accorded with\r\nour plans perfectly, as we thus had ample time to visit the chief\r\npoints of interest--and there are many--of the island, and enjoy at\r\nleast a passing view of the wonderful and varied floral display for\r\nwhich Trinidad is so famous.\r\n\r\nTrinidad, as the reader will recollect, was discovered by Columbus\r\nduring his third voyage, and given the name it still bears in honor\r\nof the Blessed Trinity. In his letter to Ferdinand and Isabella,\r\ndescribing this voyage, he says he started from San Lucar in the\r\nname of the most Holy Trinity, and after two months at sea, during a\r\nportion of which time all aboard suffered intensely from the heat,\r\n[49] they saw to the westward three mountain peaks, united at the\r\nbase, rising up before them. Here, then, was to them the symbol of the\r\nTriune God--the Three in One--in whose name all had left their native\r\nland, and what more natural than that it should be named Trinidad--the\r\nTrinity? \"Upon this,\" writes the pious admiral, \"we repeated the 'Salve\r\nRegina,' and other prayers, and all of us gave thanks to our Lord.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a grateful change it was from the extreme heat which they\r\nhad endured, to the delightful climate of the newly discovered\r\nisland. \"When I reached the island of Trinidad,\" I again quote from\r\nthe Admiral's letter, \"I found the temperature exceedingly mild;\r\nthe fields and the foliage were remarkably fresh and green, and as\r\nbeautiful as the gardens of Valencia in April.\" [50]\r\n\r\nWhat so deeply impressed Columbus on his arrival at Trinidad was what\r\nlikewise most impresses the visitor to-day--its mild climate and the\r\nbeauty and luxuriance of its vegetation. Although the island is but\r\nlittle more than 10° from the Equator the mean annual temperature\r\nis not more than 77° F. In the mornings and evenings of the cooler\r\nseason the thermometer is about 10° lower. During our sojourn of some\r\nweeks in Trinidad we never suffered from the heat. On the contrary,\r\nduring our morning and evening drives, especially in the mountains,\r\nwe found the ocean breeze delightfully refreshing.\r\n\r\nColumbus was also much impressed by the natives of the island. They\r\nhad a whiter skin--he had expected to find them very black--than any\r\nhe had hitherto seen in the Indies and were very graceful in form,\r\ntall and elegant in their movements.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few scattered families, of more or less mixed\r\ndescent, the visitor will find no evidence of the former existence\r\nhere of that splendid type of Indian of whom the great navigator\r\nspeaks so highly, and of whose race there were then on the island many\r\nthousands of souls. Here, as on the other islands of the West Indies,\r\nthe aborigines have disappeared, never to return.\r\n\r\nIn their place we find the most cosmopolitan agglomeration of\r\npeople under the sun--English, Germans, Spaniards, French, Chinese,\r\nHindoos, and Negroes from the darkest Senegambian to the fairest\r\nOctaroon. About one-half of the population is composed of Negroes,\r\none-third of Coolies, and one-sixth of whites of various nationalities\r\nand shades of color. As we contemplated the motley crowds which always\r\nthrong the streets of the Port-of-Spain we could not but recall Lopez\r\nde Gomara's curious reflections on the divers colors of the different\r\nraces of men. We give his remarks in Richard Eden's translation:\r\n\r\n\"One of the marueylous thynges that god ... vseth in the composition\r\nof man, is coloure; whiche doubtlesse can not bee consydered withowte\r\ngreat admiration in beholding one to be white and an other blacke,\r\nbeinge coloures vtterlye contrary. Sum lykewyse to be yelowe whiche\r\nis betwene blacke and white; and other of other colours as it were\r\nof dyuers liueres. And as these colours are to be marueyled at,\r\neuen so is it to be considered howe they dyffer one from an other\r\nas it were by degrees, forasmuche as sum men are whyte after dyuers\r\nsortes of whytnesse: yelowe after dyuers maners of yelowe: blacke\r\nafter dyuers sortes of blacknesse: and howe from whyte they go to\r\nyelowe by ... discolourygne to browne and redde: and to blacke by\r\nasshe colour, and murrey sumwhat lyghter then blacke: and tawnye lyke\r\nvnto the west Indian which are all togyther in general eyther purple,\r\nor tawny lyke vnto sodde quynses, or of the colour of chestnuttes or\r\nolyues: which colour is to them natural and not by theyr goynge naked\r\nas many haue thought: albeit theyr nakednesse haue sumwhat helped\r\nthereunto. Therfore in lyke maner and with suche diuersitie as men\r\nare commonly whyte in Europe and blacke in Affrike, euen with like\r\nvarietie are they tawny in these Indies, with diuers degrees diuersly\r\ninclynynge more or lesse to blacke or whyte.\" [51]\r\n\r\nThe Coolies interested us immensely, in whatever part of the island\r\nwe met them--and they are to be seen everywhere--and were for us the\r\nsubject-matter of constant study. They occupy an entire suburb of the\r\nPort-of-Spain, and, for those who are interested in sociological and\r\neconomic questions, no place is more worthy of a visit. Day after day,\r\nwhen the delicious evening breezes began to sweep in from the ocean,\r\nwe found ourselves directing our course towards the \"Indian Quarter,\"\r\nas it is called, and we always found something new to arrest our\r\nattention or excite our admiration. It required no effort whatever of\r\nthe imagination to fancy ourselves in the crowded streets and markets\r\nof Benares or Madras.\r\n\r\nPort-of-Spain, whose population is about 50,000, rejoices in quite\r\na number of large and handsome public buildings and churches. Among\r\nthe latter the Roman Catholic Cathedral is conspicuous. The homes\r\nof the people in the better quarters of the city--surrounded by a\r\nrich profusion of tropical flowers, and shrubs and trees covered with\r\nblooming climbers--are frequently models of architectural excellence,\r\nand betoken refinement, comfort and even affluence.\r\n\r\nTo us the most attractive part of the city was the Botanical Garden,\r\nadjoining the residence of the governor. This spot is justly famous\r\nnot only in the West Indies, but the world over. Here have been\r\ncollected from every tropical clime all the plants and shrubs and\r\ntrees that are admired, for beauty of bloom, richness of fragrance,\r\nor grace and majesty of form.\r\n\r\nHere we see the hibiscus shrub, with large, flaming, crimson flowers;\r\nthe poinciana, aglow with a bloom of yellow and orange, scarlet\r\nflowered balisiers, and the poui tree decked with a rich robe of\r\nsaffron. Alongside them are oranges and lemons, pineapples, guavas,\r\nmongosteens, nutmegs, tamarinds, and scores of other kinds of tropical\r\nfruits. A little further on we meet with tea shrubs, the clove and\r\nthe cinnamon tree, the rubber tree, and the Bertolettia excelsa, laden\r\nwith nuts, each of which contains from ten to twenty seeds. Then there\r\nare the curious cannon-ball tree, stately samans, the leopardwood\r\ntree, the trumpet tree and others equally attractive. Besides all\r\nthese there are those princes of the forest--the palms--from every\r\nquarter of the tropics, with every variety of trunk and leaf--date,\r\nfern, talipot, Palmyra, and groo-groo palms, the tall traveler's-tree\r\nwith its graceful plantain-like leaves, and the Oreodoxa speciosa,\r\n\"the glory of the mountains.\" On and among them are rare orchids,\r\nand parasites of countless species, climbing ferns, and convolvuluses\r\nof every hue.\r\n\r\nAnd to complete this scene of beauty, we behold at almost every step,\r\nfluttering across our path, brilliant heliconias and other butterflies\r\nthat contribute such life and charm to the forest glories of tropical\r\nlands. And then the humming birds--those lovely animated gems that\r\nflit from bush to bush, and flower to flower--flashing all the fire\r\nof the opal, and emitting in rapid succession all the brilliant hues\r\nof the topaz and the sapphire, the ruby and the emerald. They are\r\nnot as numerous now--more is the pity--as they were formerly, when\r\nthe aborigines gave the name Iere--humming bird--to this island on\r\naccount of their great numbers and when they protected and venerated\r\nthem as the souls of departed Indians. But one still meets them in\r\none's strolls through the gardens and the forest, and always with a\r\nnew sense of wonder and delight.\r\n\r\nHere, of a truth, were realized, nay, eclipsed, all the marvels of\r\nthe garden of Alcinous, for here\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        \"There was still\r\n        Fruit in his proper season all the year.\r\n        Sweet Zephyr breath'd upon them blasts that were\r\n        Of varied tempers. These he made to bear\r\n        Ripe fruits, these blossoms. Time made never rape\r\n        Of any dainty there.\" [52]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, worth a visit from afar to see and study these marvels\r\nof plant and vine, and bush and tree of the Botanic Garden. But the\r\nwhole island is, at least for the stranger from the North, one vast\r\nbotanic garden. Go where we will, we are astonished and bewildered\r\nby the novelty and the exuberance of the vegetation that surrounds us.\r\n\r\nIf we drive over the broad and well-kept roads along the western\r\ncoast, we pass under shady avenues of cocoa palms bending under\r\ntheir burden of fruit. If we go to the cacao groves--and they are\r\nlarge and numerous here--our eyes are gladdened by the vermilion\r\nbloom that covers the protecting Erythrina umbrosa. [53] In a glen\r\nhard by is a giant ceiba, transformed, by the countless number of\r\ncreepers and epiphytes to which it has given hospitality, into a\r\nvast air-garden. Along the streams and mountain torrents are lovely\r\ncanopies formed by the plume-like foliage of bamboos--seventy to eighty\r\nfeet high--affording retreats of rarest sylvan beauty. Again it is in\r\nthe Rosa del Monte, with its crimson bloom, the purple dracona, the\r\nyellow croton, the night-blooming cereus, the angelim, covered with\r\npurple tassels, the carmine poinsettia, the sweet-scented vanilla,\r\nfestoons of purple flowered lianas, and gray candelabra of a giant\r\ncereus. Beyond it all, as a felicitous background to this gorgeous\r\ndisplay and at the same time an adequate enclosure for Flora's fairy\r\npalace, there is such a profusion of vegetable tracery and arabesques\r\n\"as would have stricken dumb with awe and delight him who ornamented\r\nthe Loggie of the Vatican.\"\r\n\r\nFurther on we have the comely bread-fruit tree, with its deeply-lobed\r\nleaves and its massive fruit, the many-rooted and many-branched\r\nmangrove, [54] and not far distant is a clump of royal palms, with\r\ntheir smooth pearl-gray columns and coronals of verdure. Or there is a\r\ngroup of kindred growth--jagua palms--whose crown of pinnated leaves,\r\neach full twenty-five feet long, caused Humboldt to declare that\r\non this truly magnificent tree \"Nature had lavished every beauty of\r\nform.\" While standing by one of the pillar-stems of the jagua palm,\r\nbeneath its emerald ostrich plumes, we were quite prepared to share\r\nKingsley's enthusiasm for palm trees in general. \"Like a Greek statue\r\nin a luxurious drawing-room,\" he writes, \"sharp-cut, cold, virginal;\r\nshaming by the grandeur of mere form the voluptuousness of mere color,\r\nhowever rich and harmonious; so stands the palm of the forest; to be\r\nworshipped rather than to be loved.\" [55]\r\n\r\nIt would tire the reader to attempt a description of the many pictures\r\nof interest of this charming island, of its delightful drives in\r\nevery direction, of its beauteous cascades and waterfalls, one of\r\nwhich, Maracas Falls, three hundred feet in height, is a reproduction\r\nof Bridal Falls in the Yosemite, with the added setting of tropical\r\nverdure. No pen can picture the exquisite charm of the Caura or Maraval\r\nvalleys, of Blue Basin and Macaripe Bay, or of the Five Islands--real\r\ngems of the ocean--with their cozy and inviting cottages. When in\r\nEgypt years ago we fancied that we should like to spend the rest of\r\nour days on the island of Philæ, ever in the presence of its matchless\r\nruins. When we spent a happy day--how fleeting it was--on one of these\r\nfive islands--it was the largest and fairest--we felt that we had at\r\nlength found that inland home--far away from noise and strife, from\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"Fever and fret and aimless stir\"\r\n\r\n\r\nof which we had so often dreamed, and in which we had so often longed\r\nto dwell.\r\n\r\nThe people of Trinidad think their island the most beautiful of all\r\nthe West Indian group. Having visited, at one time or other, all the\r\nchief islands comprising the Greater and Lesser Antilles, we should\r\nhesitate to dispute their claim. It is certainly very beautiful,\r\nand possesses many attractions that are either entirely absent from\r\nthe other islands or are found only in a lesser degree. Puerto Rico\r\nand Jamaica equal it in many respects, and in others surpass it,\r\nbut in some important features the American possession is inferior\r\nto those of the British.\r\n\r\nI have said nothing of La Brea, the wonderful pitch lake for which\r\nTrinidad has been celebrated since the time of Raleigh, [56] and\r\nwhich for some decades past has supplied us with much of the asphalt\r\nused in the United States. This curious phenomenon has been described\r\nso often that there is no call for further comment. Suffice to say\r\nthat it, together with the sugar plantations and the cacao groves,\r\nconstitutes the chief source of the revenue of the island.\r\n\r\nLike Curaçao, Trinidad is a favorite resort of Venezuelan\r\nrevolutionists, expatriated generals and colonels and their\r\nsympathizers. As a rule, they are an impecunious set, and rarely\r\ninteresting. Crespo and Guzman Blanco both started from here on their\r\nway to the presidential chair in Caracas. So did the unfortunate\r\nParedes, shortly before our arrival in Venezuela, but he had scarcely\r\nset foot on the soil of his native country, which he had promised to\r\nliberate from the evils of Castroism, before he, with his followers,\r\nwas shot down in cold blood.\r\n\r\nOn account of its proximity to the mainland and commanding,\r\nas it does, the entire Orinoco basin, Trinidad should enjoy an\r\nextensive trade with Venezuela. And this she would undoubtedly\r\nhave were it not that Venezuela imposes an extra ad valorem duty\r\nof thirty per cent. on all merchandise that comes from or by way of\r\nTrinidad. This is in retaliation for the island's harboring smugglers\r\nand revolutionists. One of the results of this policy is smuggling\r\non a most extensive scale, at which many of the customs officials\r\nconnive. This means a great loss to the Venezuelan government, for\r\nit is estimated that it thus loses a greater part of the duties that\r\nshould go to the national treasury.\r\n\r\nAnother temptation to smuggle arises from the excessively high tariff\r\non certain necessary articles of consumption. Thus salt, which is a\r\ngovernment monopoly, costs sixteen times as much in Ciudad Bolivar\r\nas it does in Trinidad. The natural consequence is that there is a\r\nlarge contraband traffic in this important commodity. In some cases\r\nthe smugglers elude the vigilance of the government officials and\r\npay nothing whatever in the way of duties. In others they have an\r\nunderstanding with the officials, and pay por composicion--that is,\r\nonly a portion of the tax--the other portion being divided between\r\nthe official and the smuggler.\r\n\r\nContraband trade, however, is nothing new in this part of the world. It\r\ndates back to the sixteenth century when, according to Fray Padre\r\nSimon, the learned author of Noticias Historiales de las Conquistas de\r\nTierra Firme, religion and policy prohibited all commercial relations\r\nbetween Spaniards and foreigners, especially the Dutch and the English.\r\n\r\nAs an obiter dictum, however, it may be remarked that it was this\r\nrestricted and short-sighted trade policy that, more than anything\r\nelse, led to the enormous losses that Spain suffered during so many\r\ndecades from corsairs and buccaneers, and that eventually resulted\r\nin the wars of independence in the Spanish colonies of the New World.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DELTA OF THE ORINOCO\r\n\r\nWe were still reveling in the countless beauties of forest and\r\nfield--quite oblivious of the passage of time--when we were informed\r\nthat our steamer would, in a few hours, start for Ciudad Bolivar,\r\nthe chief city on the Orinoco, and distant about two days' sail from\r\nthe Port-of-Spain.\r\n\r\nEager as we were to explore the wonders of the famed and mysterious\r\nOrinoco, it was with great reluctance that we tore ourselves away\r\nfrom the cherished home of flowers and humming birds--sweet Iere. In\r\nTrinidad, thanks to the kind and considerate hospitality of its\r\npeople, we had enjoyed all the comforts of home and the same freedom\r\nof movement as if we had been given the keys of the city.\r\n\r\nOur steamer was scheduled to leave at two o'clock in the afternoon,\r\nbut, as a matter of fact, did not weigh anchor until some hours\r\nlater. This, however, we did not regret, as it gave us an opportunity\r\nto have \"one last lingering look\" at the island beautiful from the\r\nupper deck of the vessel. Besides this, we could by means of our\r\nfield glasses take a survey of the Gulf of Paria--for it is famous\r\nin history, this Gulf of Paria--and has been visited by men whose\r\nnames are writ large in the annals of the world's heroes.\r\n\r\nIts waters were visited in 1805 by England's one-eyed, one-armed\r\nsailor-man, while in pursuit of the French and Spanish warships which\r\nhe had chased from Gibraltar to the Caribbean Sea and thence back\r\nto Trafalgar, where Spain lost its navy and England her greatest\r\nadmiral. \"Had Nelson found the hostile squadron under the lee of\r\nTrinidad, the delta of the Orinoco would now be as famous in naval\r\nhistory as the delta of the Nile.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, however, the imposing figure of Spain's great admiral, Cristobal\r\nColon, that looms highest in these parts. He it was that gave the\r\nchief promontories of island and mainland, and the channels that\r\nseparate the one from the other, many of the names they still bear.\r\n\r\nFar down to the south is La Boca de la Sierpe--the Serpent's Mouth--the\r\nchannel that separates the southwesternmost point of Trinidad from\r\nVenezuela. It was through this channel that Columbus passed when he\r\nentered the gulf in which we now are, and from which he got his first\r\nview of the mainland of the New World. But he did not realize at first\r\nthe magnitude of his discovery. Thinking the land he saw on his port\r\nquarter was an island--for during his two preceding voyages he had\r\nseen nothing but islands, outside of Cuba, which he fancied to be the\r\neastern part of Asia--he named it Isla Santa, or Holy Island. A short\r\ndistance to the northwest of us is La Boca del Draco, the Dragon's\r\nMouth, through which the great navigator\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"Push'd his prows into the setting sun,\r\n        And made West East.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe names Serpent's Mouth and Dragon's Mouth were given to the two\r\nstraits mentioned on account of the strong currents found there and\r\non account of the danger Columbus experienced in taking his ships\r\nthrough them. His letter to Ferdinand and Isabella contains a graphic\r\ndescription of the dangers he encountered while passing through the\r\nSerpent's Mouth. \"In the dead of night,\" he writes, \"while I was\r\non deck, I heard an awful roaring, that came from the south, toward\r\nthe ship; on the top of this rolling sea came a mighty wave roaring\r\nwith a frightful noise, and with all this terrific uproar were other\r\nconflicting currents, producing, as I have already said, a sound as\r\nof breakers upon rocks. To this day I have a vivid recollection of\r\nthe dread I then felt lest the ship might flounder under the force of\r\nthat tremendous sea; but it passed by, and reached the mouth of the\r\nbefore-mentioned passage, where the uproar lasted for a considerable\r\ntime.\" [57] He had similar difficulty in making his exit through the\r\nDragon's Mouth.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the frightened sailors of Columbus imagined that they\r\nwere the sport of the Evil One. \"Being in the region of Paria,\" writes\r\nNavarrete, \"the Admiral asked the pilots what they made their position\r\nto be; some said that they were in the sea of Spain, others that they\r\nwere in the sea of Scotland, and that all the seamen were in despair,\r\nand said the Devil had brought them there.\" [58]\r\n\r\nColumbus, as has been stated, at first considered the land on his\r\nport side to be insular in character, but before he left the Gulf of\r\nParia he was evidently convinced by the raging surges of fresh water\r\nthat had nearly swamped his ships, that he had discovered a land of\r\ncontinental dimensions. In his letter to the Spanish sovereigns he\r\nwrites, \"This land, which your highnesses have sent me to explore,\r\nis very extensive, and I think there are many other countries in the\r\nsouth of which the world has never had any knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nHe had observed that a very large river debouched from the land of\r\nGracia and he at once \"rightly conjectured that the currents and the\r\noverwhelming mountains of water which rushed into these straits with\r\nsuch an awful roaring, arose from the contest between the fresh water\r\nand the sea. The fresh water struggled with the salt to oppose its\r\nentrance and the salt water contended against the fresh in its efforts\r\nto gain a passage outward. And I formed the conjecture, that at one\r\ntime there was a continuous neck of land from the island of Trinidad\r\nand the land of Gracia, where the two straits now are.\" All these\r\nconclusions have been confirmed by the observations of subsequent\r\nexplorers.\r\n\r\nWhat, however, will most interest the curious reader are the\r\nspeculations into which Columbus was led by the various phenomena\r\nobserved in the Gulf of Paria. The most fantastic, from our modern\r\npoint of view, were his theories regarding the form of the earth and\r\nthe location of the Terrestrial Paradise.\r\n\r\nBefore his arrival in the Gulf of Paria, he had been a firm believer\r\nin the sphericity of the earth, but in this part of the world he had\r\nobserved so many new and unexpected features--\"so much irregularity,\"\r\nas he phrased it--that he came \"to another conclusion respecting the\r\nshape of the earth, namely: that it is not round, as they describe,\r\nbut of the form of a pear, which is very round except where the stalk\r\ngrows, at which part it is most prominent.\"\r\n\r\nIt is very easy for us, in the light of all the advance in\r\nscientific knowledge since his time, to smile at his hypotheses,\r\nand the reasonings by which he arrived at his conclusions. What\r\nseemed plausible then appears preposterous now. But we must remember\r\nthat the proofs of the rotundity of the earth before his time were\r\nquite empirical, and were far from having the demonstrative force\r\nof those that are now adduced. All the epoch-making work in physics\r\nand astronomy by such men as Galileo and Kepler, Newton and Laplace,\r\nHuyghens and Foucault, and the French academicians, bearing on the form\r\nof our globe, has been accomplished since his time. If we now know that\r\nthe earth has the form of an oblate spheroid and not that of a pear, it\r\nis in consequence of the progress of physical astronomy during the four\r\ncenturies that have elapsed since Columbus sailed the western seas.\r\n\r\nBefore his time the learned had located the earthly paradise in\r\nvarious parts of the eastern hemisphere. Some contended that it was\r\nin Mesopotamia, others that it was in Ethiopia near the head waters\r\nof the Nile, but all agreed that it was somewhere in the East. Now\r\nColumbus, who imagined he had reached the eastern part of Asia, by\r\nsailing westwards from Spain, thought he had incontrovertible evidence\r\nfor locating the Garden of Eden in the newly discovered land of Gracia.\r\n\r\n\"I do not suppose,\" he writes, \"that the Earthly Paradise is in\r\nthe form of a rugged mountain, as the descriptions of it have made\r\nit appear, but that it in on the summit of the spot which I have\r\ndescribed as being in the form of the stalk of a pear; the approach\r\nof it from a distance must be by a constant and gradual ascent; but\r\nI believe that, as I have already said, no one could ever reach the\r\ntop\"--except \"by God's permission,\" as he asserts elsewhere. \"I think\r\nalso that the water I have described may proceed from it, though it\r\nbe far off, and that, stopping at the place which I have just left,\r\nit forms this lake. There are great indications of this being the\r\nTerrestrial Paradise, for its site coincides with the opinions of\r\nthe holy and wise theologians whom I have mentioned; and moreover,\r\nthe other evidences agree with the supposition, for I have never\r\neither read or heard of fresh water coming in so large a quantity,\r\nin closer conjunction with the sea. The idea is also corroborated by\r\nthe blandness of the temperature, and if the water of which I speak\r\ndoes not proceed from the Earthly Paradise, it appears to be still\r\nmore marvelous, for I do not believe there is any river in the world\r\nso large or so deep.\" [59]\r\n\r\nBesides Nelson and Columbus, a third celebrated seaman visited this\r\npart of the world. This was Sir Walter Raleigh, of whom we shall have\r\nmore to say as we proceed. [60]\r\n\r\nOur parting view of the forest-clad mountains of Trinidad we shall\r\nnever forget. The sun was setting on the mainland--the land of Gracia\r\nof Columbus--but before disappearing below the horizon he tinged\r\nIere's mountains with a parting smile and enveloped them in a\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"--soft and purple mist\r\n        Like a vaporous amethyst;\"\r\n\r\n\r\nreminding one of the azure haze that veils Hymettus as the sun sinks\r\nbehind Parnassus in an evening in June--something that only the gifted\r\nGreek poet has ever been able adequately to describe.\r\n\r\nThe shades of night had fallen long before we reached the Serpent's\r\nMouth, which we were obliged to pass before entering the Macareo, one\r\nof the numerous channels of the Orinoco delta. We were thus deprived\r\nof the opportunity of getting a good view of the huge billows that\r\nare produced by the meeting of river and sea, of which Columbus has\r\ngiven us so graphic a description.\r\n\r\nThose of the passengers that were disposed to become seasick retired\r\nto their staterooms before we arrived at the Macareo bar, where the sea\r\nis roughest, and where the ground-swells are most unpleasant. For half\r\nan hour or more the steamer tossed considerably, reminding one of the\r\nEnglish Channel in stormy weather. But the impact of surge against\r\nsurge, of which Columbus speaks, was much less than we had been\r\nled to anticipate, and there was little indication of the forcible\r\neddies of the \"violentlie swift Orinoco,\" which caused Raleigh so\r\nmuch embarrassment.\r\n\r\nThis was easily accounted for, as the rainy season had not yet\r\nset in, and the waters at the various estuaries were, therefore,\r\ncomparatively little agitated. Columbus, however, arrived here\r\ntowards the end of the rainy season, when the floods of the Orinoco\r\nwere at their height, while Raleigh came after the rainy season was\r\nquite well advanced. Again, ours was a fairly good-sized steamer and\r\nbetter adapted to stem wave and current than were the fragile barks\r\nof Columbus, or the frail wherries and cock-boats of Raleigh. When the\r\nfloods of the Orinoco were at high-water mark, we can well understand\r\nthat the early navigators had reason to be deeply impressed by the\r\ndangers that confronted them in these seething and roaring waters,\r\nand that, to their exalted imaginations, the realities of their\r\nsurroundings were in nowise short of the fancies of the poet as\r\nindicated in the verses at the head of this chapter. Indeed, so great\r\nwere the supposed difficulties, and so dangerous the climate in these\r\nparts, that sailors were wont to say,\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"Quien se va al Orinoco,\r\n        Si no se muere, se vuelve loco.\" [61]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to navigating the less known rivers and\r\ncaños--channels--which, like a network, intersect the delta in every\r\ndirection, the difficulty and danger are even now so great that the\r\nmost skilled Indian pilots often become bewildered. When this occurs\r\nnothing remains but to follow the current until one reaches the gulf,\r\nand then enter a branch with which one is familiar. Sir Walter gives\r\nsuch a graphic account of the difficulties he experienced in reaching\r\n\"the great riuer Orenoque,\" that I reproduce in his own words a part\r\nof a paragraph bearing on the subject.\r\n\r\nAfter telling us how his Indian pilot had gotten lost in the maze\r\nof caños through which he was trying to grope his way, he says:\r\n\"If God had not sent vs another helpe we might haue wandred a whole\r\nyeere in that laborinth of riuers, ere we had found any way, either\r\nout or in, especiallie after we were past the ebbing and flowing,\r\nwhich was in fower daies: for I know all the earth doth not yeeld\r\nthe like confluence of streames and branches, the one crossing the\r\nother as many times, and all as faire and large and so like one to\r\nanother, as no man can tell which to take: and if we went by the Sun\r\nor compasse hoping thereby to go directly one way or other, yet that\r\nwaie we were also carried in a circle amongst multitudes of Islands,\r\nand euery Island so bordered with high trees as no man could see any\r\nfurther than the bredth of the riuer, or length of the breach.\" [62]\r\n\r\nExaggerated as this account seems, it does scant justice to the\r\nreality. Raleigh had no opportunity to explore the delta, and to\r\nacquire definite notions of its immensity, or he would have had\r\nmuch more to add to the foregoing description of its extent and\r\nmarvels. Even to-day we have no map of this region, which is, in\r\nmany respects, as unknown as the least explored part of Central\r\nAfrica. As yet our knowledge of land and river is limited only to\r\nits most salient features, but this is quite sufficient to excite our\r\nwonder. Suffice it to say that the area of the delta is greater than\r\nthat of Sicily; that its base, from its main branch at the Boca de\r\nNavios to the embouchure of the Manamo, is nearly two hundred miles\r\nin length; that the Orinoco, at the bifurcation of its two principal\r\nbranches, is twelves miles in width; that there are no fewer than fifty\r\nbranches conveying the waters of the mighty river into the Atlantic;\r\nthat the lowlands of the delta are divided into thousands of islands,\r\nand islets, by a network of rivers diverging in fan-shape towards the\r\nsea, and by innumerable caños and bayous, some with stagnant water,\r\nothers with strong currents, ramifying in every direction in straight\r\nlines and in curves, so that escape from their intricacies by any one,\r\nexcept an experienced pilot, would be as impossible as would have\r\nbeen an exit from the Cretan labyrinth without the clew of Ariadne.\r\n\r\nWhen we arose the morning after leaving Trinidad, our steamer had\r\nalready advanced quite a distance on its way through the Macareo. This\r\nbrazo, or branch, is chosen not because it is the largest or the\r\ndeepest, but because it affords the shortest and most direct route\r\nbetween the Port-of-Spain and Ciudad Bolivar. Although the distance to\r\nthis latter place from the mouth of the Macareo is only two hundred\r\nand sixty miles, it usually required nearly two days, counting the\r\nstops on the way, for the trip up the river, so strong is the current\r\nThe return trip, however, can be made in much less time.\r\n\r\nWe shall never forget our first view of the Orinoco and of the\r\nimpressions we then received. Was it that we were at last sailing in\r\nthe placid waters of the one river of all the world that we had from\r\nour youth most yearned to behold, or was it that we had been dreaming\r\nof the site and beauties of the Terrestrial Paradise, as fancied by\r\nColumbus to exist in these parts, or was it because of both these\r\nelements combined? We know not, but one thing is certain, and that\r\nis that our first view of the Orinoco and its forest-shaded banks,\r\nfestooned with vines and flowers, recalled at once those musical\r\nwords of Dante,\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"Sweet hue of eastern sapphire, that was spread\r\n        O'er the serene aspect of the pure air,\r\n        High up as the first circle, to mine eyes\r\n        Unwonted joy renewed.\" [63]\r\n\r\n\r\nand brought vividly back to memory his inimitable description of\r\nhis entrance into the Garden of Eden, where he was to meet again his\r\nlong-lost Beatrice.\r\n\r\nTo emphasize the illusion, there suddenly appeared under a noble\r\nmoriche palm on the flower-enameled bank of the river and only a few\r\nrods from where we were standing, two children of the forest--a young\r\nman and a young woman--bride and groom, we loved to think--who were\r\nas Columbus found the American, as Adam and Eve were after the fall,\r\nwhen, in the words of Milton,\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  \"Those leaves\r\n        They gathered, broad as Amazonian targe,\r\n        And with what skill they had, together sewed\r\n        To gird their waist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHandsome was the youth and beautiful was the maiden, strong as\r\nHiawatha, fair as Minnehaha--both fit models for sculptor and painter,\r\nand such as the poet dreams of when depicting his heroes and heroines\r\nof the forest primeval.\r\n\r\nWere they the king and queen of their tribe? Fancy said, \"Yes.\" But\r\nwhether they were or not, one could say with truth that the tan-colored\r\nmaid was like the one Raleigh met along this very same river and who,\r\nin his own words, \"was as well fauored and as well shaped as euer I\r\nsaw anie in England.\" [64]\r\n\r\nNear this interesting young couple, both in the heyday of youth,\r\nlay a cluster of plantains, which was doubtless to contribute to\r\ntheir morning repast. But what a coincidence that, even in this\r\ntrifling circumstance, we should find an additional reminder of the\r\nEarthly Paradise! Have not men of science named the plantain Musa\r\nParadisaica, in allusion to the tradition, which has long obtained,\r\nthat it was the plantain, and not the apple, that was the forbidden\r\nfruit in Eden? [65] It was there to fill out the picture as an artist\r\nin the tropics would wish to see it painted.\r\n\r\nBut there was still something wanting. While we were yet under the\r\nspell of our environment, and lost in the contemplation of the Edenic\r\nbeauties around us, we were awakened from our reverie by a plunge and a\r\nsplash before the prow of our vessel--and there, greatest surprise of\r\nall in our series of coincidences, was a giant anaconda, full thirty\r\nfeet long, vigorously plowing its way to the opposite bank of the\r\nriver. It was like the water-snakes in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"Blue, glossy, green and velvet black,\r\n        It coiled and swam,\r\n        And when it reared, the elfish light\r\n        Fell off in hoary flakes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSo startling was this strange apparition that we could scarcely\r\ncredit our senses, and, had it not been for exclamations of surprise\r\nby several of the passengers near by, we should have thought, for a\r\nwhile, that it was all a dream.\r\n\r\nThe picture was now complete. There was the serpent in this paradise\r\nof delights, as in the paradise of our first parents. And what added\r\nto the strangeness--the uncanniness--of the appearance of the serpent\r\nat this particular juncture was the extraordinary rarity of such an\r\noccurrence. One of the officers of the steamer told us that he had\r\nbeen sailing up and down the Orinoco for twenty years and had never\r\nseen one of these boas before. And more wonderful still, it was the\r\nfirst and last we ourselves saw, although we subsequently traveled\r\nmany thousands of miles on tropical rivers along which such serpents\r\nhave their habitat. [66]\r\n\r\nAll in all, our first view of the Orinoco fully met our fondest\r\nexpectations so far as they related to variety and exuberance of\r\nvegetation and beauty of scenery. The entire delta of the Orinoco\r\nmay aptly be described as one of Nature's choicest conservatories,\r\nin which Flora has collected together the fairest growths of garden\r\nand forest, and where the charm of foliage and flower is enhanced by\r\nthe presence of countless species of the feathered tribe of richest\r\nplumage and of dazzling hue.\r\n\r\nA distinguished German traveler, Friedrich Gerstäcker, writing of his\r\nimpressions of the delta of the Orinoco, does not hesitate to declare\r\nthat \"there is not in the world anything more glorious in vegetation\r\nthan is to be seen on the banks of the Orinoco,\" and that there is\r\nno place more attractive to the tourist. [67]\r\n\r\nTo form some conception of the wonderful variety of vegetable life\r\nto be seen in the delta, it will suffice to observe that a third of\r\na century ago botanists had counted in the forests of Guiana no fewer\r\nthan 132 families of plants, 772 genera and 2,450 distinct species. Of\r\nthe genera more than sixty were indigenous.\r\n\r\nAlthough we saw many things in the delta of the Orinoco that\r\npossessed intense interest for us, we saw none of the natives living\r\nin houses built on the summits of trees, about which some recent\r\nwriters, following Raleigh, Humboldt and others, still entertain\r\ntheir readers. To tell the truth, we did not expect to find such\r\ndwellings, as it has been demonstrated beyond question that they do\r\nnot now exist, and probably never did exist in these parts outside\r\nof the fertile imaginations of Raleigh and Gumilla. Humboldt never\r\nvisited the delta, and hence, what he says on the subject in Personal\r\nNarrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions, is based on reports\r\nreceived from others. [68]\r\n\r\nCardinal Bembo, writing in the first half of the sixteenth century,\r\nspeaks of them, and Benzoni, his contemporary, who spent fifteen years\r\nin traveling in the New World, illustrates by an engraving what he\r\nhas to say about the Indian houses built on the tops of trees. [69]\r\n\r\nFerdinand Columbus, who, although a mere youth, had accompanied his\r\nfather on his fourth voyage, writes, that when in the Gulf of Uraba,\r\n\"We saw people living like birds in the tops of trees, laying sticks\r\nacross from bough to bough, and building their huts upon them; and\r\nthough we knew not the reason of the custom, we guessed that it was\r\ndone for fear of their enemies, or of the griffins that are in this\r\nisland.\" [70]\r\n\r\nPeter Martyr, who most likely got his information about these strange\r\ndwellings from Ferdinand Columbus, tells us that the trees on which\r\nthey were built were of \"suche heighth, that the strength of no mane's\r\narme is able to hurle a stone to the houses buylded therein.\" He adds,\r\nhowever, that the owners of the houses have \"theyr wyne cellers in\r\nthe grounde and well replenysshed.\" And he vouchsafes the reason for\r\nnot keeping the wine, with \"all other necessayre thinges they haue,\r\nwith theym in the trees. For albeit that the vehemencie of the wynde,\r\nis not of poure to caste downe those houses, or to breeke the branches\r\nof the trees, yet are they tossed therwith, and swaye sumwhat from\r\nsyde to syde, by reason therof, the wyne shulde be muche troubeled\r\nwith moouinge.... When the Kynge or any of the other noblemen, dyne or\r\nsuppe in these trees, theyr wynes are brought theym from the celleres\r\nby theyr seruantes, whyche by meanes of exercise are accustomed with\r\nnoo lesse celeritie to runne vppe and downe the steares adherete to\r\nthe tree, then doo owre waytynge boyes vppon the playne grounde, fetche\r\nvs what wee caule for from the cobbarde bysyde owr dynynge table.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the size of the trees the same writer avers, \"Owr men measuringe\r\nmanye of these trees, founde them to bee of suche biggnes, that seuen\r\nmen, ye sumetymes eight, holdinge hande in hande with theyr armes\r\nstreached furthe, were scarcely able to fathame them aboute.\" [71]\r\n\r\nRaleigh had evidently read some of these accounts about people living\r\non tree tops, but not satisfied with the Munchausen tales of his\r\npredecessors, he proceeds to entertain his readers with stories as\r\nmarvelous as those of Sindbad the Sailor.\r\n\r\nWriting of the Indians of the delta, he says: \"In the winter they\r\ndwell vpon the trees, where they build very artificiall towns, and\r\nvillages, ... for between May and September, the riuer Orenoke riseth\r\nthirtie foote vpright, and then are those Ilands ouerflowen twentie\r\nfoote high aboue the leuell of the ground, sauing some few raised\r\ngrounds in the middle of them.... They neuer eate of anie thing that\r\nis set or sowen, and as at home they vse neither planting nor other\r\nmanurance, so when they com abroad the refuse to feede of ought but\r\nof that which nature without labor bringeth foorth.\" [72]\r\n\r\nOf the Waraus, the Indians who inhabit the delta, the missionary, Padre\r\nGumilla, writes that when their islands are periodically inundated\r\nby the rise of the Orinoco, they erect their huts on piles--not on\r\ntrees, as Raleigh states--above the water. Furthermore, he tells us\r\nthat these huts are made of the moriche palm, which grows abundantly\r\nin these islands, and are covered with the leaves of it. From the\r\nfibres of the leaf, they make their hammocks and their cords for\r\nfishing and for bowstrings.\r\n\r\nAround the pulpy shoot that ascends from the trunks is a web-like\r\nintegument that serves them for the slight covering they wear. On\r\nthe productions of this tree, also, they entirely subsist. The pulpy\r\nshoot is eaten as cabbage, and the tree bears a fruit like the date,\r\nbut somewhat larger. When the inundation ceases, the tree is cut down,\r\nand being perforated, a palatable juice exudes, from which they make\r\na drink. The interior substance of it is then taken out and thrown\r\ninto vessels of water and well washed and the ligneous fibres being\r\nremoved, a white sediment is deposited, which, dried in the sun,\r\nis made into a very wholesome bread. [73]\r\n\r\nAccepting the foregoing statements as true, Humboldt philosophizes as\r\nfollows: \"It is curious to observe in the lowest degree of civilization\r\nthe existence of a whole tribe depending on a single species of palm\r\ntree, similar to those insects which feed on one and the same flower,\r\nor on one and the same part of a plant.\" [74]\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding all that has been written about the Indians of\r\nthe Orinoco delta living on the tops of trees, and depending on only\r\nthe moriche palm for food and raiment, it is certain that they do not\r\ndo so now, and it is almost equally certain that they have never done\r\nso in the past. Truth to tell, these stories seem to repose on little\r\nbetter foundation than those so long circulated and credited regarding\r\nLake Parime, and the great city of Manoa--the home of El Dorado.\r\n\r\nRaleigh had no time or opportunity to explore the delta, and there is\r\nreason to believe that in this, as in other matters, he gave free reign\r\nto his fancy to satisfy his reader's desire for the marvelous. Gumilla,\r\napparently, got his information regarding these particular subjects\r\nat secondhand. He spent many years on the middle Orinoco and some of\r\nits affluents, but there is no evidence that he was ever in a position\r\nto verify the stories so long current regarding the manner of living\r\nof the inhabitants of the delta.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, no one, so far as known, ever made any attempt to explore\r\nthe interior of the delta until more than two centuries after Raleigh's\r\ntime and until nearly a half century after Humboldt's visit to the\r\nvalley of the Orinoco. As a consequence, all that had been reported by\r\nearlier writers was exaggeration and guesswork, if not pure invention.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Schomburgk, who, as Her Majesty's commissioner to survey\r\nthe boundaries of British Guiana, explored the delta in 1841--and\r\nsome months of his sojourn there was during the rainy season--states\r\nexplicitly, that not in a single instance did he find Indians dwelling\r\non trees. \"We can well suppose that the numerous fires which were\r\nmade in each hut, and the reflection of which was the stronger in\r\nconsequence of the stream of vapor around the summit of trees in\r\nthose moist regions, illuminated at night the adjacent trees; but\r\nthe fire itself was scarcely ever made on the top of a tree. The\r\ninundation rises at the delta seldom higher than three or four feet\r\nabove the banks of the rivers;\"--not twenty or thirty feet, as Raleigh\r\nasserts--\"and if the immediate neighborhood of the sea and the level\r\nnature of the land be considered, this is an enormous rise.\" [75]\r\n\r\nHerr Appun, who visited the delta some years subsequently to\r\nSchomburgk's sojourn there, declares, \"I have lived more than a year\r\nand a half among the Waraus of the Orinoco delta, and those of the\r\neast coast of South America, from Cape Sabinetta to Cape Nassau, at\r\nthe mouth of the Pomeroon river in British Guiana, both during the\r\ndry and the rainy season, and never have I beheld any of the aerial\r\ndwellings that have been described.\" [76]\r\n\r\nThe one, however, who has most thoroughly explored the interior\r\nof the delta is Sr. Andres E. Level, who spent several years among\r\nthe Waraus, or Guaraunos, as they are called by the Spaniards. His\r\ninvestigations have completely exploded the false notions so long\r\nentertained regarding the delta and its inhabitants. The land is not\r\nall an impassable swamp. Much of it is so elevated above the river\r\nthat it is never reached by the high floods of the Orinoco.\r\n\r\nIts soil is even more fertile than that of the Nile valley and produces\r\nevery tropical fruit and tree in the greatest profusion. Game is\r\nabundant, and the Indians have extensive rancherias--plantations--which\r\nsupply them grain, fruits and vegetables of all kinds. In the rivers\r\nnear by they have the greatest variety of fish, besides turtle that\r\nwould be the delight of the epicure.\r\n\r\nAs the Waraus of the interior are a timid people and have long since\r\nlearned to distrust the white man, they remain, as a rule, concealed in\r\nthe depths of forests that are impassable. They are, however, a quiet,\r\nindustrious, home-loving people, and are famous among the tribes in\r\nthis section of Guiana for their beautiful curiaras, or canoes--made\r\nfrom a single log of the cedar, or of a tree called Bioci. Some of\r\nthese dugouts--the monoxyla of the Greeks--are full fifty feet long\r\nand from five to six feet broad and find a ready sale as far south\r\nas Demerara.\r\n\r\nFar from being a dismal swamp, inhabited only by poor, starving\r\nsavages, condemned to live on tree tops, and to find food and clothing\r\nin a single palm, Sr. Level [77] shows us that the delta is a garden\r\nof exceeding richness and that the Indians, if the government did\r\nits duty towards them by developing the marvelous resources of their\r\nland and by giving its inhabitants, so long neglected, some measure of\r\nattention and assistance, would eventually make efficient contributors\r\nto the national revenue, and become desirable citizens of the republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT RIVER\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What a wide river!\" was the exclamation of a fellow-passenger as\r\nour steamer passed out of the Macareo and turned the apex of the\r\ndelta. It was, indeed, very wide, and the bank of the Orinoco on our\r\nport-quarter was almost invisible. Here, even during the dry season,\r\nthis mighty water course is no less than four leagues in width. We\r\nnow, for the first time, fully realized that we were sailing on the\r\nbroad waters of one of the world's master rivers. After the Parana\r\nand the Amazon, it is the largest waterway in South America, and,\r\nfor the volume of water it carries into the ocean, it ranks with the\r\nMississippi, the Congo, Yang-tse-Kiang, and the Brahmaputra. Well have\r\nthe natives of the lands through which it flows named it the Great\r\nRiver--for it is great in every way--great in the immense basin it\r\ndrains; great in the tribute it carries to the ocean, and great in\r\nthe number and magnitude of the rivers it counts among its affluents\r\nfrom the distant Cordilleras.\r\n\r\nAs along the Macareo, so here along the Orinoco, one never tires of\r\ngazing at the magnificent forest trees and the dense shrubbery with\r\nwhich the banks are fringed. At one time it is the wide-branched ceiba,\r\ncovered with bright-blooming epiphytes; at another a clump of graceful\r\nmoriche palms, whose tremulous plumes are given an added beauty by the\r\npresence of a bevy of multicolored parrots and macaws. The foliage of\r\ntree and shrub is here ever fresh and luxuriant and retains always\r\nthat delicate hue so characteristic of the leafage of our northern\r\nwoodlands in the early days of spring.\r\n\r\nMost of the trees, large and small, are literally weighed down with\r\nparasites and epiphytes. Among the latter growths are orchids of\r\ncountless variety and rarest beauty, such as are seldom seen in our\r\nnorthern floral conservatories. And the way in which the trees are held\r\ntogether by those strange forms of vegetable life--so abundant in the\r\ntropics--the bejucos or bush ropes! Sometimes they are as thick as a\r\nman's arm, sometimes they are like a ship's cable, sometimes they may\r\nbe mistaken for telegraph wires--so long and fine are they. They extend\r\nfrom the ground to the tops of the highest trees, or drop from the\r\nsummits of the loftiest monarchs of the forest to the earth beneath,\r\nsometimes singly, sometimes by scores. Then again they cross one\r\nanother from tree to tree and form a trelliswork that at times is next\r\nto impassable. And these bejucos, or lianas, as they are also called,\r\nare, like the trees, burdened with air-plants of various species,\r\nat one time large masses of leaves, at another long spikes of the\r\nrichest blossoms.\r\n\r\nAt almost every turn the vision is delighted by lovely arboreal\r\ngroups and charming natural bowers, all graced with the most gorgeous\r\ncombinations of emerald foliage and ruby bloom--interspersed with\r\ndelicate tufts of lilac, pink and canary--and illumined by gleams of\r\nflitting sunshine which bring out a glorious play of color effects\r\nwith which the eye is never tired. \"A dryad's home,\" we heard an\r\nenthusiastic señorita exclaim, as we passed one of these flower-decked\r\nbowers, on which glittered the checkered sunlight. And so well it\r\nmight be, it was so rare a gem of sylvan loveliness.\r\n\r\nWhile passing up this majestic river and admiring the ever-varying\r\npanorama of rarest floral beauty, we recalled a couple of paragraphs\r\nin Darwin's Journal of Researches, in which he refers to the futility\r\nof attempting to describe, for one who has never visited the tropics,\r\nthe wonders of the scenery there and above all the marvels of the\r\nvegetable world. He expresses himself as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Such are the elements of the scenery, but it is a hopeless attempt to\r\npaint the general effect. Learned naturalists describe these scenes\r\nof the tropics by naming a multitude of objects, and mentioning some\r\ncharacteristic feature of each. To a learned traveler this possibly\r\nmay communicate some definite ideas; but who else from seeing a plant\r\nin an herbarium can imagine its appearance when growing in its native\r\nsoil? Who from seeing choice plants in a hothouse, can magnify some\r\ninto the dimensions of forest trees, and crowd others into an entangled\r\njungle? Who, when examining in the cabinet of the entomologist the\r\ngay exotic butterflies, and singular cicadas, will associate with\r\nthese lifeless objects, the ceaseless harsh music of the latter, and\r\nthe lazy flight of the former--the sure accompaniments of the still,\r\nglowing noonday of the tropics? It is when the sun has attained its\r\ngreatest height, that such scenes should be viewed; then the dense,\r\nsplendid foliage of the mango hides the ground with its darkest\r\nshade, whilst the upper branches are rendered, from the profusion\r\nof light, of the most brilliant green. In the temperate zones the\r\ncase is different--the vegetation there is not so dark or so rich,\r\nand hence the rays of the declining sun, tinged of a red, purple,\r\nor bright yellow color, add most to the beauties of those climes.\r\n\r\n\"When quietly walking along the shady pathways, and admiring each\r\nsuccessive view, I wished to find language to express my ideas. Epithet\r\nafter epithet was found too weak to convey to those who have not\r\nvisited the intertropical regions, the sensation of delight which the\r\nmind experiences. I have said that the plants in a hothouse fail to\r\ncommunicate a just idea of the vegetation, yet I must recur to it. The\r\nland is one great wild, untidy, luxuriant hothouse, made by Nature\r\nfor herself, but taken possession of by man, who has studded it with\r\ngay houses and formal gardens. How great would be the desire in every\r\nadmirer of Nature to behold, if such were possible, the scenery of\r\nanother planet! yet to every person in Europe, it may be truly said,\r\nthat at the distance of only a few degrees from his native soil, the\r\nglories of another world are opened to him. In my last walk I stopped\r\nagain and again to gaze on these beauties, and endeavored to fix in\r\nmy mind for ever, an impression which at the time I knew sooner or\r\nlater must fail. The form of the orange tree, the cocoa-nut, the palm,\r\nthe mango, the tree-fern, the banana, will remain clear and separate;\r\nbut the thousand beauties which unite these into one perfect scene\r\nmust fade away; yet they will leave, like a tale heard in childhood,\r\na picture full of indistinct, but most beautiful figures.\" [78]\r\n\r\nWhile the flora of the Orinoco, near the apex of the delta, is so\r\nvaried and exuberant, but little is seen of its fauna, notwithstanding\r\nall that has been said and written to the contrary. In a recent work,\r\nfor instance, written by one who pretends to have made the trip from\r\nTrinidad, is a sentence that will equal any of the extravagances of\r\nJules Verne's Le Superbe Orénoque.\r\n\r\n\"The jaguar,\" says the author, \"will stop drinking, or the tapir look\r\nup from browsing on the grass, and the monkey pause in swinging from\r\ntree to tree, as the boats hurry noisily by, while the drowsy alligator\r\nor manatee floats lazily on, his head half out of the water, until\r\nperhaps a conical bullet from a Winchester rifle or from a revolver,\r\nwhich everyone carries, rouses him to a knowledge that it is not good\r\nto trust too much to mankind.\"\r\n\r\nIt is quite safe to say that neither the author of the work quoted\r\nnor any one else has ever seen a jaguar, or a tapir or a manatee\r\nunder the circumstances mentioned. They are all timid animals and\r\nare never seen from the deck of noisy steamers.\r\n\r\nAlthough we saw no quadrupeds like those just mentioned, there were\r\ncountless birds, large and small. Those that were most conspicuous\r\nwere ibises, flamingoes and herons of various species. So numerous at\r\ntimes were the flamingoes that, to borrow an idea from Trowbridge,\r\nthe sunrise flame of their reflected forms actually crimsoned \"the\r\nglassy wave and glistening sands.\" Of the herons, the largest species\r\nis named by the natives soldado--a soldier--so called both from\r\nits size and the stately attitude it assumes, which, at a distance,\r\ngives it the appearance of a sentry on duty.\r\n\r\nA flock of these tall, white birds, seen feeding in an everglade in\r\nCuba was, during the second voyage of Columbus, taken for a party of\r\nmen clad in white tunics, and led the Admiral to believe that they\r\nwere inhabitants of Mangon, a province just south of Cathay. Indeed,\r\nso striking is their resemblance to men posted as sentinels that,\r\naccording to Humboldt, \"the inhabitants of Angostura, soon after the\r\nfoundation of their city, were one day alarmed by the sudden appearance\r\nof soldados and garzas, on a mountain towards the south. They believed\r\nthey were menaced with an attack of Indios monteros, wild Indians,\r\ncalled mountaineers; and the people were not perfectly tranquilized\r\ntill they saw the birds soaring in the air and continuing their\r\nmigration towards the mouths of the Orinoco.\" [79]\r\n\r\nOur first stopping place was Barrancas, a small and squalid village of\r\nmud, palm-thatched huts. It is situated in the centre of one of the\r\nfinest grazing regions of Venezuela and under a wise and progressive\r\ngovernment, would soon become a place of considerable importance.\r\n\r\nIn the time of the Franciscan Missions here, suppressed nearly a\r\ncentury ago, the herds that roamed the beautiful undulating prairies\r\non both sides of the Orinoco counted no fewer than one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand cattle, and with the markets that could easily be had\r\nfor beef and hides, this number could, under favorable conditions,\r\nbe greatly increased. As it is, however, it is known rather as a\r\nfavorite rendezvous for that numerous class of revolutionists for\r\nwhom the country is so noted, that have been born insolvent, but who,\r\nby grandiloquent pronunciamientos, and through the coöperation of\r\nhungry spoil-seekers like themselves, hope one day to improve their\r\nfinancial condition.\r\n\r\nNear Barrancas we were shown the spot where General Antonio Paredes\r\nand his confiding followers were shot in cold blood, a few days before\r\nour arrival, in pursuance of an order, we were told, that President\r\nCastro had issued from his sick bed in Macuto. This speedy, albeit\r\nunconstitutional, disposition of the leaders of what was heralded as a\r\ngreat popular reform movement was designed to put a quietus on other\r\nrevolutionists who were making or preparing to make pronunciamientos\r\nin various parts of the republic. It did not, however, seem to have\r\nthe desired effect, as during our sojourn in the country two other\r\nrevolutions cropped out when least expected. For a while one of these\r\ngave the government very grave concern but was finally suppressed;\r\nnot, however, until the country had suffered by anticipation many of\r\nthe miseries of internecine strife.\r\n\r\nBefore our departure from Caracas, we tried in vain to get some\r\ninformation not only about the dates of sailing of the Orinoco\r\nsteamers but also about their character. After leaving the capital,\r\nsome of our friends tried to dissuade us from our projected trip to\r\nCiudad Bolivar, assuring us that the only craft plying up and down the\r\nriver were filthy cattle boats unfit for a white man to enter. Imagine\r\nour surprise, then, when we found that our vessel, far from being\r\nthe unclean, poorly-provisioned boat that had been pictured to us,\r\nwas in every way fairly comfortable, and with a cuisine and service\r\nthat were far from bad. In construction and general arrangement,\r\nit was not unlike the smaller double-decked steamers on the Hudson\r\nriver or on our northern lakes. Our cabins were spacious, with broad\r\nberths, and clean bedding and furniture. Indeed, we have often had\r\ncabins in our large transatlantic steamers in which there was less\r\nof comfort and convenience than were afforded by our cabin in this\r\nunpretending boat on the Orinoco.\r\n\r\nAs to the passengers, they were quite a cosmopolitan crowd. Among\r\nthem were some Europeans and several Americans, but the greater\r\nnumber were Venezuelans--most of them bound for Ciudad Bolivar. Of\r\nthe Americans there were two men in quest of fortune in the celebrated\r\nYuruari mining district in southern Guiana.\r\n\r\nThe upper deck of the boat was reserved for the first-class passengers,\r\nwhile the lower one was occupied by those of the second-class, and\r\nby such freight as was carried up and down the river. On returning\r\nto the Port-of-Spain, the steamer usually carried about two hundred\r\nhead of cattle for the Trinidad market. When these were taken on\r\nboard at night, as sometimes happened, sleep was impossible. What\r\nwith the tramping and bellowing of the affrighted brutes below us\r\nand the shouting of the cattlemen and crew, there was a veritable\r\npandemonium which continued the greater part of the night.\r\n\r\nFrequently there are not enough cabins for the passengers. But this\r\nmakes very little difference to the Venezuelan. He simply swings his\r\nchinchorro--hammock--between two stanchions of the vessel and is soon\r\ncalmly reposing in slumberland. Indeed, many of the inhabitants of the\r\ntropics prefer a hammock to a bed, and do not apply for a stateroom\r\nwhen traveling on the rivers of equatorial America.\r\n\r\nThe second-class passengers sleep in their hammocks if they happen to\r\nhave them; if not, they lie down anywhere they can find room and are\r\nsoon fast asleep. Many of them have no beds at home, except a mat,\r\na rawhide, or the lap of Mother Earth, and the absence of a bed or\r\nhammock is no appreciable privation to them.\r\n\r\nThere is no more curious sight than is presented at night on a crowded\r\nriver steamer in the tropics. One sees scores of hammocks swung in\r\nevery conceivable place. All davits and stanchions, all uprights\r\nand crosspieces are provided with hooks and rings, so that hammocks,\r\nwhen necessary, may be attached to them. In saloons and passageways,\r\non forward-deck and after-deck, wherever there is any available space,\r\nthere is stretched on the floor, or snugly ensconced in his chinchorro,\r\nsome quietly sleeping or loudly snoring specimen of humanity. Sometimes\r\none will see several persons stowed away in a single hammock. It is\r\nnot an unusual thing to see two persons in the same chinchorro, and\r\none may now and then see a mother and three children serenely reposing\r\nin one of these aerial cots. How they do it, it is difficult to say,\r\nbut the fact is that they do it, and there is apparently not a budge\r\nin the hammock's occupants until they are awakened in the morning by\r\nthe call of the birds--Nature's alarm clocks in the tropics.\r\n\r\nA place of more than passing interest between Barrancas and Ciudad\r\nBolivar is Los Castillos, formerly Guayana la Vieja, founded by\r\nAntonio de Berrio in 1591. It was here, in 1618, that young Walter\r\nRaleigh, the son of the Admiral, lost his life in an encounter with\r\nthe Spaniards who had possession of this stronghold. It was near here,\r\nalso, that Bolivar, at a critical hour during the War of Independence,\r\nsaved his life by hiding in a swamp near the village.\r\n\r\nAbout ten leagues further up the river, at the mouth of the Caroni,\r\nand opposite the island of Fajardo, Diego de Ordaz--the officer under\r\nCortes who got sulphur out of the crater of Popocatepetl--found in 1531\r\na settlement called Carao during his exploration of the Orinoco. This\r\nwas afterwards named Santo Tomé de Guayana, and was for a short time a\r\nmissionary centre--the first on the Orinoco. It was, however, destroyed\r\nin 1579 by the Dutch under Jansen. There is little now at this point\r\nto interest the traveler except the beautiful Salto--cataract--of the\r\nCaroni river, so celebrated for its picturesque scenery, and the wealth\r\nof orchideous plants with which the adjacent trees are clothed. Raleigh\r\nin describing these falls says that so great was the mass of vapor due\r\nto the fury and rebound of the waters that \"we tooke it at the first\r\nfor a smoke that had risen ouer some great towne,\" and Padre Caulin, in\r\nhis description of it, says the roar of the cataract is so great that\r\nit can be heard at a distance of several leagues. Both these accounts\r\nare quite exaggerated. The falls are very beautiful and romantic,\r\nbut by no means so grand or so imposing as they have been depicted.\r\n\r\nNear the confluence of the Caroni and the Orinoco is the straggling\r\nlittle town of San Felix. At this point our mining party left us\r\nfor their long journey of one hundred and fifty miles on mule-back\r\nto Callao. They gave us a cordial invitation to accompany them, but\r\nwe had other plans, and, although we should have enjoyed exploring\r\nthis famous mining district of southern Guiana, we felt constrained\r\nto continue our course westwards.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years the Yuruari mining district promised to equal, if\r\nnot surpass, the most famous gold fields of Nevada and California. One\r\nof the mines, the Callao, rivaled the great Comstock mines of Virginia\r\nCity, and for \"a considerable period,\" we are assured, \"original shares\r\nof 1,000 pesos produced dividends of 72,000 pesos yearly.\" In 1895,\r\nhowever, the main lode was lost, and since that time, owing to lack of\r\nfunds, little has been done in any of the mines in the district. The\r\nowners of the Callao mine still hope to find the lost lode, and it was\r\nto investigate the condition of this mine, and of certain others in\r\nthe neighborhood, that our American friends undertook their long trip\r\nsouthwards. If the outlook justifies it, they purpose improving the\r\npresent wretched cart-road, which connects the mines with San Felix,\r\nand putting on suitable traction engines for the transportation of\r\nfreight, which has hitherto been carried on the backs of burros and\r\nin carts of the most primitive type.\r\n\r\nDuring the halcyon days of the Callao mine, when all eyes were directed\r\ntowards this quarter of the world, a certain syndicate tried to secure\r\nfrom the government a concession for building a railroad from the\r\nOrinoco to the Yuruari gold fields. The then president of Venezuela\r\nwas quite willing to grant the concession, but insisted, it is said, on\r\nhaving by anticipation a much larger share of the prospective profits\r\nof the road than the company was willing to give. Had the railway\r\nbeen constructed, there is no doubt that many other valuable mines\r\nwould have been developed, and that southeastern Guiana would soon\r\nhave become one of the most productive regions of the republic. The\r\nroad would have benefited not only the mining interests but would have\r\nled to a rapid development of the grazing and agricultural industries,\r\nwhich, in this part of Venezuela, could, under favorable conditions,\r\nbe second only to those of the llanos of the Apure, and of the fertile\r\nplains of the states of Bermudez and Bolivar.\r\n\r\nAside from the interest that attaches to this part of South America,\r\non account of its many scenic attractions and its varied natural\r\nresources of forest and field and mine, it will always possess an added\r\ninterest by reason of its connection with Raleigh's ill-fated search\r\nfor El Dorado. When his purse became depleted, and he had fallen from\r\nthe favor of Queen Elizabeth--who for a while was so \"much taken with\r\nhis elocution\" that she \"took him for a kind of oracle\"--he bethought\r\nhim of retrieving fortune and favor by the discovery and conquest of\r\na second Incaic empire, and, with this end in view, he projected his\r\nfamous voyage to\r\n\r\n\r\n                            \"Yet unspoil'd\r\n        Guiana, whose great city Geryon's sons\r\n        Call El Dorado.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is beside my purpose to comment on the \"cruell and blood-thirsty\r\nAmazones,\" and the race of people who \"haue their eyes in their\r\nshoulders, and their mouths in the middle of their breasts,\" [80]\r\nabout whom Raleigh writes in his remarkable book, so often quoted,\r\nThe Discoverie of Gviana, and which caused Hume to brand the work\r\nas being a tissue of \"the grossest and most palpable lies.\" We are\r\nhere interested only in what he says about the finding of gold in the\r\nregion bordering the Caroni and in his fantastic tales regarding El\r\nDorado. [81]\r\n\r\nWhether Raleigh himself really believed in the existence of El Dorado,\r\nsuch as he has described it, or whether he wished to work on the\r\nimaginations of his countrymen, who were as credulous and as great\r\nlovers of the marvelous as were their contemporaries on the continent\r\nof Europe, cannot be affirmed with certainty. It is probable that he\r\npossessed a full share of the credulity of his age, and that, if he\r\nembellished his accounts of what he saw or exaggerated the reports\r\nwhich he received from the aborigines, he really gave credence to the\r\nleading features of the extraordinary stories that were then current\r\nregarding the fabulous riches of the great city of Manoa.1\r\n\r\nAnd he was most likely in earnest when he declared that \"whatsoeuer\r\nPrince shall possess it\"--Guiana--\"that Prince shal be Lorde of more\r\ngold, and of a more beautifull Empire, and of more Cities and people,\r\nthen eyther the King of Spayne, or the great Turke,\" and was probably\r\nhonest in the belief that he who should \"conquerere the same,\" would\r\n\"performe more than euer was done in Mexico by Cortez, or in Peru\r\nby Pacaro.\"\r\n\r\nThe New World was, for the people of the Old, still a land of mystery\r\nand enchantment, and the great majority of the adventurers in the\r\nnewly discovered lands were quite ready to credit the wildest tales,\r\nand follow the most elusive phantoms, provided they gave indications,\r\nhowever slight, of the possibility of satisfying that auri sacra\r\nfames which consumed the poor and rich alike.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable thing about Raleigh is that he actually found gold and\r\ngold-bearing quartz in the land watered by the Caroni, and located the\r\ncapital of El Dorado near where the great Callao mine was discovered\r\nnearly three centuries later. And not only did he discover gold-bearing\r\nquartz, but he found a variety of gold quartz essentially the same\r\nas that which occurs in the Yuruari districts. It is interesting to\r\nspeculate what effect the actual discovery by him of the Callao mine\r\nwould have had on his subsequent career and on England's schemes of\r\nexpansion in the Western Hemisphere. One thing is certain. He would\r\nhave recouped his lost fortunes, and his head, in all probability,\r\nwould never have fallen on the block in Old Palace Yard. [82]\r\n\r\nThe following is Raleigh's résumé of the riches and marvels of Guiana\r\nand the Orinoco valley, and at the same time a sample of the stories\r\nthen current regarding the land of El Dorado--stories which those\r\nto whom the writer appealed, found little difficulty in accepting as\r\nunquestioned expressions of unvarnished truth:\r\n\r\n\"For the rest, which my selfe haue seene I will promise these\r\nthings that follow and knowe to be true. Those that are desirous to\r\ndiscouer and to see many nations, may be satisfied within this riuer,\r\nwhich bringeth forth so many armes and branches leading to seuerall\r\ncountries, and prouinces, aboue 2000 miles east and west, and 800\r\nmiles south and north: and of these, the most eyther rich in Gold, or\r\nin other merchandizes. The common soldier shal here fight for gold,\r\nand pay himselfe, in steede of pence, with plates of halfe a foote\r\nbrode, wheras he breaketh his bones in other warres for prouant and\r\npenury. Those commanders and Chieftaines, that shoote at honour,\r\nand abundance, shal find there more rich and bewtifull cities, more\r\ntemples adorned with golden Images, more sepulchers filled with\r\ntreasure, than either Cortez found in Mexico, or Pazarro in Peru,\r\nand the shining glorie of this conquest will eclipse all those so\r\nfarre extended beames of the Spanish nation. There is no countrey\r\nwhich yeeldeth more pleasure to the inhabitants, either for these\r\ncommon delights of hunting, hawking, fishing, fowling, and the rest,\r\nthen Guiana doth. It hath so many plaines, cleare riuers, abundance of\r\nPhesants, Partridges, Quailes, Rayles, Cranes, Herons, and all other\r\nfowls: Deare of all sortes, Porkes, Hares, Lyons, Tygers, Leopards,\r\nand diuers other sortes of beastes, eyther for chace, or foode.\" [83]\r\n\r\nAlthough we were intensely interested in the fauna and flora of\r\nthe Orinoco, and never tired of the magnificent prospects, which,\r\nlike an ever-changing panorama, were constantly presented to our\r\nview, we found time to observe the native population, especially\r\nthe Indians, who are seen in considerable numbers along the entire\r\ncourse of the river. In the Delta and in its immediate neighborhood,\r\nthey are represented chiefly by the Waraus, Aruacs, and Caribs.\r\n\r\nThe Waraus have a slightly darker complexion than either the Aruacs or\r\nCaribs. Owing to their lack of personal cleanliness, and the amount\r\nof oil with which they besmear their bodies, their hue becomes so\r\ndark, that, were it not for their straight hair, it would at times be\r\ndifficult to distinguish them from negroes. In consequence of their\r\ncareless habits regarding their persons and places of abode, and the\r\nway in which they neglect their children, they are despised by the\r\nneighboring tribes. Their rude huts, often no more than a little\r\npalm thatch supported by a few uprights, afford them but little\r\nprotection from sun and rain. With these, however, they seem to be\r\nquite satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe Aruacs found here belong to that great group of Indians that, at\r\nthe time of the arrival of the Spaniards in the New World, inhabited\r\nall the large islands of the Antilles. According to ethnologists,\r\ntheir original home was probably on the eastern slopes of the\r\nBolivian Cordilleras. Thence they migrated towards the north and\r\neast and constituted for a time one of the most powerful races in\r\nthe Western Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThey are also one of the oldest of the great South American\r\ntribes. They were the first Indians with whom the Spaniards came\r\nin contact and are to-day, as they were in the time of Columbus, a\r\nfriendly, good-natured, peace-loving people, in spite of all the harsh\r\ntreatment their forefathers received from their cruel conquerors. They\r\nare fairer than either the Waraus or the Caribs, and their women\r\nare reputed the most beautiful of all the native Guianians. [84]\r\nTheir hair is occasionally so long that it reaches the ground, and,\r\nalthough they sometimes do it up and in the most tasteful manner,\r\nthey usually allow it to fall over their shoulders. They anoint it\r\ndaily with Carapa nut oil, and seem to realize as fully as do their\r\nwhite sisters in the north, that \"a woman's glory is in her hair.\" [85]\r\n\r\nThe Caribs here referred to belong to that dread race of whom Columbus\r\nheard such blood-curdling stories from the peaceful inhabitants of\r\nCuba and Española. They are, too, among the youngest of the great\r\nmigratory races of South America, and their original abode seems to\r\nhave been in the upper basins of the Xingu and Tapajos, two of the\r\ngreat affluents of the Amazon.\r\n\r\nDescending these rivers, they took possession of the greater part of\r\nthe continent bordering the Atlantic from the mouth of the Amazon to\r\nthe Caribbean sea, which is named from them. Subsequently, in large\r\nfleets of canoes, in making which they excelled, they pushed their\r\nway up the Orinoco and its principal tributaries, spreading death\r\nand destruction wherever they went. And not satisfied with their\r\nconquests on land, they eventually extended their dominion over the\r\nislands of the Lesser Antilles as far as St. Thomas. Had it not been\r\nfor the timely arrival of the Spaniards, there is no doubt that they\r\nwould have driven the peaceful Waraus out of the Greater Antilles,\r\nas they had forced them from their other homes in the islands to the\r\nsoutheast and on the mainland of South America.\r\n\r\nThey were the terror of all the tribes with whom they came in\r\ncontact. They enslaved the women, and celebrated their victories\r\nby devouring the men. They were the cannibals who so strenuously\r\nopposed the Spaniards on many a bloody field, and who, it is alleged,\r\ncelebrated their victory over the white invader by serving up, at their\r\nsavage banquets, the captives taken in ambush or in battle. Indeed,\r\nthe word cannibal is but a corruption of the word Carib. [86] For\r\nmany generations they preyed on the peaceful Indians of the missions\r\nof the Orinoco basin and elsewhere, and time and again the zealous\r\nmissionary saw the work of years undone in a few moments by the sudden\r\nonslaught of these dread and ruthless visitants.\r\n\r\nThanks to the tireless efforts of the Spanish Franciscans, the Caribs\r\nwho inhabit the eastern part of Venezuela were eventually civilized\r\nand Christianized, and converted from wild nomads into peaceful\r\nand useful citizens, having their own towns and villages. They were\r\nchiefly engaged in the breeding of cattle and in agriculture.\r\n\r\nA century ago there were in the territory bounded by the Caroni,\r\nthe Cuyuni and the Orinoco no fewer than thirty-eight missions, with\r\nsixteen thousand civilized Indians. But by decrees promulgated by the\r\nRepublic of Colombia in the years 1819 and 1821 these missions were\r\nsuppressed and to-day one sees scarcely a vestige of their former\r\nexistence. The Indians are not only much less numerous than formerly,\r\nbut most of them have returned to the mode of life they led before\r\nthe advent of the missionary.\r\n\r\nThey are, as a rule, peaceful and harmless, but as they have been so\r\nlong neglected by the government, their social status is but little\r\nabove that of their savage ancestors. More is the pity. The suppression\r\nof the missions here was followed by the same consequences as resulted\r\nfrom the suppression of the missions in Paraguay and elsewhere--the\r\nrelapse of the Indians into savagery and the loss to the state of\r\nthousands of useful and worthy citizens. It is difficult to see the\r\nwisdom of thus eliminating from the body politic elements so prolific\r\nof good and so essential to the public weal.\r\n\r\nPère Labat, referring to the language of the Caribs, writes as\r\nfollows:--\"The Caribs have three kinds of language. The first, the\r\nmost ordinary, and that which every one speaks, is the one affected\r\nby the men.\r\n\r\n\"The second is so proper to the women, that, although the men\r\nunderstand it, they would consider themselves dishonored if they spoke\r\nit, or if they answered their women in case they had the temerity\r\nto address them in this language. They--the women--know the language\r\nof their husbands, and must make use of it when they speak to them,\r\nbut they never use it when they talk among themselves, nor do they\r\nemploy any language but the one peculiar to themselves, which is\r\nentirely different from that of the men.\r\n\r\n\"There is a third language, which is known only by the men who have\r\nbeen in war, and particularly by the old men. It is rather a jargon\r\nthan a language. They use it in important assemblies of which they\r\ndesire to keep the resolutions secret. The women and young men are\r\nignorant of it.\" [87]\r\n\r\nThis statement was for a long time discredited, and classed among those\r\nfables regarding the New World that were unworthy of the attention of\r\nserious men. Later on it was discovered that the victoriosa loquacitas\r\nof the charming monk was based on fact. But the next thing was to\r\nexplain the fact. On investigation it was found that something similar\r\nexists among other Indian tribes of South America, as, for instance,\r\namong the Guaranis, the Chiquitos, the Omaguas and the Quichuas.\r\n\r\nIn explanation of this strange phenomenon, it was then suggested\r\n\"that women, from their separate way of life, frame particular terms\r\nwhich men do not adopt.\" Cicero observes that old forms of language\r\nare best preserved by women, because, by their position in society,\r\nthey are less exposed to those vicissitudes of life, changes of place\r\nand occupation, which tend to corrupt the primitive purity of language\r\namong men. [88]\r\n\r\nThis suggestion, ingenious though it be, was far from satisfactory to\r\nphilologists and ethnologists. The quest, therefore, for a solution of\r\nthe strange problem, was continued with renewed interest, and with the\r\nresult that the mystery was at length completely solved. As has been\r\nstated, it was the custom of the Caribs in their wars with other Indian\r\ntribes to massacre the men and reduce the women to servitude. In some\r\ninstances many of the women and not infrequently the majority of them\r\nbecame the wives of their conquerors. But even after this enforced\r\nalliance, the women retained their own language. The consequence\r\nwas that, in families thus constituted, there were two languages\r\nspoken--that of the conqueror and that of the conquered.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, the general accuracy of Père Labat's statements were\r\nthus put beyond further doubt, it was discovered, by a comparative\r\nstudy of the languages of the Caribs and those of the tribes which\r\nthey had subjugated, that it was not strictly true to assert that\r\nthe language of the women was entirely different from that of the\r\nmen--totalement different de celui des hommes--as the good Dominican\r\nhad affirmed. They were entirely different in the words of daily use\r\nand of most frequent occurrence, but the difference extended in reality\r\nonly to the minor part of the vocabulary actually employed. But the\r\ndifference was quite sufficient to justify the interest it had so\r\nlong excited among men of science, and to stimulate the researches\r\nwhich have only in recent years been crowned with success. [89]\r\n\r\nThe night before arriving at Ciudad Bolivar, while dreamily reclining\r\nin a steamer chair, I was awakened from my musings by a vivacious\r\nsenorita, of pronounced Castilian type, rushing up to her father,\r\nnear by, and exclaiming in an excited manner, \"Mira, padre, mira,\r\nla Cruz del Sur!\" Look, father, look--the Southern Cross! And\r\nsure enough, there, in the constellation Centauri, was the \"Croce\r\nMaravigliosa,\"--the marvelous cross--of the early navigators, the\r\n\"Crucero\" of incomparable beauty and brightness, the celestial clock\r\nof the early missionaries in the tropical lands of the New World. The\r\ncloud-veiled skies of the preceding nights had prevented us from\r\ngetting a view of these \"luci sante\"--holy lights--but now we were\r\nprivileged to behold them in all their heavenly splendor. At once we\r\nrecalled that well-known passage of Dante, which the lovers of the\r\ngreat Florentine have applied to this constellation:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"To the right hand I turned, and fixed my mind,\r\n        On the other pole attentive, where I saw\r\n        Four stars ne'er seen before save by the ken\r\n        Of our first parents. Heaven of their rays\r\n        Seemed joyous. O, thou northern site! bereft\r\n        Indeed, and widened, since of these deprived!\" [90]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe never suspected it at the time, but as subsequent events proved,\r\nthe señorita's Cruz del Sur was to be our timepiece for many subsequent\r\nmonths. During long wanderings over mountain and plain and in many\r\nchanging climes, it was the Southern Cross that served as our guide,\r\nand marked the hours of night, in lieu of Polaris and Ursa Major,\r\nwhich had disappeared below the horizon.\r\n\r\nToward noon, the second day after leaving the Port-of-Spain, we got\r\nour first view of Ciudad Bolivar, founded in 1764 by Joaquin Moreno de\r\nMendoza, and since that time the capital of Guiana, now the great State\r\nof Bolivar. Situated upon an eminence, on the right bank of the river,\r\nit presents a very imposing appearance and seems much larger than it is\r\nin reality. The white stone walls of the houses, and the brownish-red\r\ntiles of the roofs, together with the delicate green crowns of lofty\r\npalms that dot every part of the city, enhance in a marked degree the\r\nbeauty of the picture as seen under the brilliant light of the noonday\r\nsun. The cathedral, and the government buildings around the plaza in\r\nthe higher part of the town, loom up with splendid effect. Indeed,\r\nit would be difficult to find a more beautiful picture of a city,\r\nwhen seen at a distance, than is that of Ciudad Bolivar.\r\n\r\nAs one approaches this metropolis of the Orinoco basin, the details of\r\nthe city come gradually into view. Parallel with the river bank is the\r\nprincipal business street--La Calle del Coco--which is at the same time\r\nthe most delightful promenade in the place. Here is the custom-house,\r\nthe American and other consulates, and a number of large mercantile\r\nestablishments, controlled chiefly by Germans, Americans and Corsicans.\r\n\r\nFrom a broad waterway, from two to three miles in width, the river\r\nhere contracts to a narrow channel which, at low water, is not\r\nmore than a half mile in width. According to Codazzi, [91] the mean\r\ndepth of the river at this point is sixty feet. Towards the end of\r\nthe rainy season, however, the water rises from forty to fifty feet\r\nabove low-water mark. Sometimes it rises considerably higher. In\r\n1891 the flood was so high that the stores and dwellings of the part\r\nof the city fronting the river were inundated to a height of several\r\nfeet. Then the inhabitants were obliged to have recourse to canoes in\r\npassing from house to house. Then, too, stray alligators were seen\r\nin the streets and it was possible to catch enough fish for a meal\r\nin the patio--court-yard--of one's residence.\r\n\r\nThe original name of the city was Santo Tomé de la Nueva Guayana--the\r\nthird place on the river to bear this name. The first, it will be\r\nremembered, was situated at the confluence of the Caroni and the\r\nOrinoco and was destroyed by the Dutch in 1579. The second, now known\r\nas Los Castillos--formerly Guayana la Vieja--was founded by Antonio de\r\nBerrio in 1591, and is famous in the history of this part of Venezuela\r\nfor its vigorous resistance to Sir Walter Raleigh, whom Spanish writers\r\ndesignate as the \"great pirate Gualtero Reali.\" As the inhabitants\r\nfound the first name of their city inconveniently long they called\r\nit Angostura--the Narrows--from the contraction of the river at this\r\npoint. The name was so appropriate that it is a pity it could not have\r\nbeen retained. In 1819, however, Congress gave it the name of Ciudad\r\nBolivar, in honor of Simon Bolivar, the Liberator of South America.\r\n\r\nAs our steamer neared the steep bank in front of the city our\r\nattention was arrested by a large, dark, granitic mass--La Piedra\r\ndel Medio--looming up in the middle of the river. Like the celebrated\r\nNileometer at Cairo, this rock, which may appropriately be called an\r\nOrinocometer, serves as a gauge of the annual rise of the flood. As\r\nwe passed it, we could see distinctly the height to which the waters\r\nhad risen the preceding year.\r\n\r\nIf ever the long-talked-of railroad from Caracas to Ciudad Bolivar\r\nshall be constructed, this rock, almost midway between the latter\r\ncity and Soledad, a small town on the opposite side of the river,\r\nwill serve as an invaluable pier for the bridge that is planned to\r\nspan the Orinoco at this point. Until, however, the country shall have\r\na more stable government than it has now, and until foreign capital\r\nshall have more confidence in the future of the republic than it has\r\nat present, it is quite safe to say that there will be neither bridge\r\nnor railroad, although both are very much needed to develop the vast\r\nresources of this section of Venezuela.\r\n\r\nIn its location and surroundings, Ciudad Bolivar possesses all the\r\nessential elements of a beautiful and prosperous metropolis. It\r\ncontrols the trade of the immense Orinoco basin, and the amount\r\nof business transacted here should, under favorable conditions,\r\nbe many times what it is at present. But, at the time of our visit,\r\neverything was in a state of abandonment that was sad to behold. The\r\nstreets, parks and public buildings, which could easily be made the\r\nmost attractive features of the city, were in a neglected condition,\r\nand the number of vacant houses in certain sections, some crumbling\r\ninto ruins, showed the inevitable effects of protracted misrule and\r\nperiodic turmoil.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked one of the prominent merchants of the city the\r\nreason for the deplorable state referred to, he replied:--\"No\r\nhay dinero. Hay tantas revoluciones.\" (\"There is no money. There\r\nare so many revolutions.\") And when I sought a reason for the\r\nbusiness lethargy everywhere manifested, a similar reply was\r\nforthcoming. \"Somos pobres, estamos arruinados. Hay tantas guerras\r\ny el gobierno es malísimo.\"--(\"We are poor, ruined. There have been\r\nso many wars and the government is very bad.\") Merchants, tradesmen,\r\nday-laborers, professional men--all, except government employees,\r\nwho were interested in retaining their positions as long as possible,\r\nhad the same pitiful story to relate.\r\n\r\nOppressive taxes, exorbitant prices for many of the necessaries\r\nof life, intolerable monopolies, controlled by leading government\r\nofficials or their favorites, had reduced the majority of the\r\npopulation to a condition bordering on despair. No encouragement\r\nwas given to foreign capital for the exploitation and development\r\nof the immense natural resources of the country. On the contrary,\r\nforeigners were looked upon with suspicion, while Castro and his\r\nhenchmen were openly antagonistic to them. Nor was it only in Ciudad\r\nBolivar and in other parts of the Orinoco valley that this lamentable\r\ncondition of things obtained. We found the same business depression,\r\nthe same hopeless outlook in Caracas, Valencia, Puerto Cabello,\r\nand other commercial centres of the republic. Small wonder, then,\r\nwas it that the discouraged, downtrodden people were longing and\r\npraying for a change in the administration.\r\n\r\nThe long desired change came at last, and in a way that no one\r\ncould have foreseen. The dramatic downfall of Castro suddenly and\r\nunexpectedly opened the way to an amelioration of conditions that had\r\nbecome intolerable, while the accession of Gomez to power has inspired\r\nall patriotic and peace-loving Venezuelans with the hope that their\r\nlong distracted country is about to enter upon a new era--an era\r\nof social progress and business prosperity--an era of amity with\r\nother nations accompanied by a spirit of comity which was so long\r\nconspicuous by its absence.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the comparatively large number of vessels that come to\r\nthis place, there is no wharf, and people here say that the great rise\r\nand fall of the river make it impossible to construct one. Fortunately,\r\nit is not a prime necessity, as the water, even in the dry season,\r\nis so deep that the largest vessels can approach so near the bank that\r\nboth freight and passengers can be discharged by an ordinary gangplank.\r\n\r\nOur steamer, like all the others there, was moored head and stern by\r\ncables leading to the venerable Ceiba trees that lined la Calle del\r\nCoco high above us. The inclination of the bank, where merchandise\r\nis landed, amounts in places to almost 45°, and yet no machinery of\r\nany kind is used for transferring even the heaviest kinds of freight\r\nfrom the vessel to the top of the acclivity. All is carried on the\r\nshoulders of men, usually mestizos and negroes.\r\n\r\nWe spent a week in and around Ciudad Bolivar, and, during this\r\ntime, we had ample opportunities to study the manners and customs\r\nof its people. The population of the city is not more than twelve\r\nor thirteen thousand--a small number for the entrepot of the immense\r\nOrinoco basin. Under less untoward conditions it would be many times\r\nas great. [92]\r\n\r\nTo this place are brought the products of the forests and plains of the\r\nupper Orinoco and its numerous tributaries. Among the most important\r\narticles of export are hides, rubber--especially the coarser variety\r\nknown as balata--cacao, coffee, and tobacco from Zamora, pelts of\r\nthe jaguar and other wild animals, tonka beans, copaiba and feathers.\r\n\r\nThe last item is amazing, when one considers what a slaughter of\r\nthe feathered tribe it implies. We met a Frenchman here who was just\r\npacking for shipment to Paris several hundred thousand egrets, the\r\nresult of a three-years' hunt in the forests and plains of the Orinoco\r\nbasin. But he was not the only one engaged in this wholesale slaughter\r\nof birds. There were many others, and their work of despoiling the\r\ntropics of their most attractive ornaments extends to all the vast\r\nregions on both sides of the equator.\r\n\r\nThe small egret--Ardea candidissima--which supplies the most valuable\r\nplumes, and the large egret--Ardea garzetta--which produces a coarser\r\nfeather, are the principal victims. As only a few drooping plumes from\r\nthe backs of the birds are taken, one can readily see what a terrific\r\nslaughter is required to meet the demands of the markets of the world.\r\n\r\nThe worst feature about the business is that the birds are killed\r\nduring the mating and breeding season. Already the result is manifest\r\nin the rapidly diminishing numbers of egrets that frequent the\r\ngarceros--the name given to the places where they nest and rear\r\ntheir young.\r\n\r\n\"The beauty of a few feathers on their backs,\" writes one who, if not a\r\nmisogynist, is evidently in sympathy with the aims and purposes of our\r\nAudubon society, \"will be the cause of their extinction. The love of\r\nadornment common to most animals is the source of their troubles. The\r\ngraceful plumes which they doubtless admire in each other have\r\nappealed to the vanity of the most destructive of all animals. They\r\nare doomed, because the women of civilized countries continue to have\r\nthe same fondness for feathers and ornaments characteristic of savage\r\ntribes.\" [93]\r\n\r\nThe houses of Ciudad Bolivar, built on a hill of dark, almost\r\nbare hornblende-schist, are in marked contrast with those of the\r\nPort-of-Spain. In Trinidad's capital each residence--usually frame--is\r\nprovided with numerous doors, and jalousied windows, and surrounded by\r\ngardens, with a profusion of the most beautiful tropical flowers and\r\ntrees. Here, on the contrary, the houses, generally only one story\r\nhigh, have but one door, with all the external windows crossed by\r\nheavy iron bars, not unlike those of our jails. [94]\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not peculiar to Ciudad Bolivar, but obtains\r\nthroughout Latin America, as it obtains in all the parts of Spain\r\nformerly occupied by the Moors. Yet these windows, which are in\r\nthemselves so forbidding, are in the cool of the evening the most\r\nattractive parts of the house. Here bevies of bright, well-dressed\r\nseñoritas, who, during the heat of the day remain secluded in their\r\nrooms or some shady corner of the patio, congregate to enjoy the fresh\r\nair that is wafted to them on the wings of the trade-winds, to listen\r\nto the daily gossip and to exchange confidences with those of their\r\ncompanions who may have called to spend the evening. Here and there\r\none will observe some philandering caballero, dressed as faultlessly\r\nas Beau Brummel, exchanging vows with some languishing Dulcinea behind\r\nthe bars. So absorbed are they in each other that they are totally\r\noblivious of all else in the world, and utterly unconscious of the\r\nattention they attract from the passers-by. For the time being they\r\nthemselves are the world and for them everything else is nonexistent.\r\n\r\nWe were sitting one evening in the beautiful plaza of Ciudad Bolivar,\r\nlistening to the music of the military band which plays here several\r\ntimes a week. The élite of the city were there. Beautiful, dark-eyed\r\nseñoritas, adorned with their graceful mantillas, were promenading with\r\ntheir fathers and mothers, and gay young cavaliers were following at a\r\ndiscreet distance, á la Española. The tropical trees and flowers, which\r\ngave to the plaza the aspect of a botanical garden, were beautifully\r\nilluminated, and, without any effort of the imagination, one could\r\neasily imagine one's self in fairyland. Hard by, a young lady from\r\nTrinidad, on whose finger was a sparkling solitaire, was recounting,\r\nin a more audible tone than she imagined, the pleasures of her voyage\r\nup the Orinoco. In the glow of her enthusiasm she declared to her\r\nconfidant, \"I am going to come to the Orinoco during my honeymoon. Don\r\nEsteban\"--evidently her fiancé--\"will just have to bring me here. I\r\ncannot imagine a more delightful trip anywhere.\"\r\n\r\nThis young lady, who had traveled extensively, in this inadvertent\r\npublication of her secret but expresses the impression that would\r\nbe reiterated, I fancy, by the majority of her sex under the same\r\ncircumstances. The Orinoco is, indeed, beautiful, and a sail on its\r\nplacid waters, if not \"the most delightful excursion one could take,\"\r\nas Miss Trinidad declared, is certainly one of the most delightful.\r\n\r\nThe day before we were to return to the Port-of-Spain, while chatting\r\nwith a friend on the upper deck of our steamer--which we had made our\r\nhotel, because the lodging houses of the city were so poor--we saw a\r\nsmall vessel coming down stream under a full head of steam. On inquiry\r\nwe found it to be a boat from Orocué, a small town in Colombia, on\r\nthe river Meta. We immediately called upon the captain of the craft,\r\nand, as a result of our interview, determined to accompany him on\r\nhis return trip to this distant point.\r\n\r\nWhen we left Trinidad, we had no intention of going further up the\r\nriver than Ciudad Bolivar, but we had enjoyed everything so much,\r\nthat now that an occasion thus so unexpectedly presented itself,\r\nwe rejoiced that we should have an opportunity of seeing more of the\r\ngreat Orinoco, and of sailing on the waters of its great tributary,\r\nthe historic Meta.\r\n\r\nDreams of the past began at once to flit before us as possible\r\nrealities in the near future. If we once got to Orocué, what was to\r\nprevent us from going further up the river--as far as its waters\r\nwere navigable? Then by crossing the llanos of eastern Colombia,\r\nand the Cordilleras of the Andes we would be in far-famed Bogotá,\r\nthe Athens of South America.\r\n\r\nWe had had, it is true, visions of this trip, but rather as something\r\ngreatly to be desired than as even a remote possibility. And now,\r\nin a few moments--after a brief conversation with the captain of the\r\nboat that had just moored alongside our own, the journey was decided\r\non, and nothing remained but to make the necessary preparations.\r\n\r\nAs, however, the steamer would not be ready to go to Orocué for about\r\ntwo weeks, we concluded to return to the Port-of-Spain and come back\r\nthe following week. This would give us an opportunity of studying\r\nmore in detail several interesting features of the lower Orinoco\r\nthat we had only gotten a glimpse of during the upward trip, and\r\nof seeing by daylight parts of the river that we had before passed\r\nduring the night. We would also be able to spend a few more days in\r\nthe beautiful island of Trinidad, and feast our eyes on its thousand\r\nbeauties which greet one at every turn.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, providential for us that we returned to Trinidad\r\nas we did, for while there--was it chance or was it our usual good\r\nfortune?--we found, what above all else we needed in this juncture--a\r\ngood, brave, enthusiastic companion for the long and arduous trip\r\nbefore us. Our compagnon de voyage, who would fondly affect the ways\r\nand dress of a dapper young caballero, and whom, therefore, we shall\r\ncall C.--caballero--was a professor of languages. He had traveled\r\nextensively, was interested in the Spanish language and literature and\r\nthe peoples we were about to visit. He was, like ourselves, fond of\r\nadventure, and was not averse to its being accompanied by an element\r\nof danger. This only gave additional zest to what were else rather\r\ntame and prosaic. Our plans were soon made, and, before the steamer\r\nwas ready to return to Ciudad Bolivar, we were fully equipped with\r\neverything necessary for our long trip across the continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nIN MID-ORINOQUIA\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last we were ready to start on our long journey up the Orinoco\r\nand the Meta, and then across the llanos of Eastern Colombia, and\r\nthe Cordilleras to far-off Bogotá. For several days the swarthy\r\nstevedores of Ciudad Bolivar had been busy in transferring to our\r\nlittle steamer the freight that had here been accumulating for her\r\nduring the preceding six months.\r\n\r\nFor several days, too, our friends and acquaintances had been\r\nendeavoring to dissuade us from what one and all pronounced a rash and\r\ndangerous undertaking. All meant well, but all were prophets of ill. No\r\none, we were assured, had ever gone to Bogotá by the route we purposed\r\ntaking, [95] and we were solemnly warned time and again that we were\r\nsurely risking our health if not exposing our lives. Everything, it\r\nwas averred, was against the successful termination of our journey,\r\nand it would be a miracle if we ever reached Bogotá alive.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, there were the steaming, miasmatic exhalations in the\r\nOrinoco and Meta valleys, from which they were never free, and the\r\never present danger of yellow fever and other malignant diseases. Even\r\npeople who were thoroughly acclimated incurred the greatest risk in\r\ntraveling through this pestiferous, germ-laden atmosphere. How much\r\nmore then should we, who had so recently come from the chilly north,\r\nbe exposed, if we still persisted in our foolhardy venture? And then,\r\nif we fell sick, as we surely must, we should be in a trackless\r\nwilderness, among savages, and far away from medical aid of any kind.\r\n\r\nThen there was the torrid climate to take into account. By reason\r\nof the intense heat, it would be impossible to travel by day. We\r\nshould then perforce be obliged to travel by night. And this implied\r\nnew dangers--dangers of straying from a poorly defined trail,\r\nor of falling into ravines, or quagmires, and dangers from wild\r\nanimals of all kinds, with which the forests and plains were always\r\ninfested. There was the jaguar, always prowling about, seeking whom\r\nhe might devour; the labairi and boaquira, serpents whose envenomed\r\nfangs bring certain death to their victims, and the dread boa that\r\nwas pictured as hanging in untold numbers from the branches of the\r\ntrees in the forests through which we should pass.\r\n\r\nA torrid climate, a reeky, malarial atmosphere, a region infested\r\nwith venomous serpents--all this was bad enough, but this was far\r\nfrom being the sum total of the pests and plagues we should encounter.\r\n\r\nThere was that ever-present pest--whose name is not legion, but\r\nbillion--on which travelers in South America have exhausted their\r\nsupply of adjectives in the vain attempt adequately to express\r\ntheir sentiments. I refer to what the Spaniard has so aptly called\r\nthe plaga--the plague--the cloud of mosquitoes of many species that\r\nconstantly torment the traveler, and give him no rest night or day. We\r\nhad read what various writers on the equinoctial regions had to say\r\nof the murderous onslaughts of the mosquito from the time of the\r\nearly missionaries down to our own, and such reading was far from\r\ncalculated to reassure one who was about to form a more intimate\r\nacquaintance of the plaga in question. [96]\r\n\r\nIn a work written on the Orinoco in 1822, Mr. J. H. Robertson,\r\nreferring to this matter, declares that \"the biting, blistering,\r\nand intolerable itching\" which is produced by clouds of mosquitoes\r\nis \"indeed enough to make a man mad.\" He says that they made the\r\npassengers--blacks as well as others, that were on the boat with him,\r\n\"almost roar with agony,\" and that in the morning the \"whole body\r\nexhibited one mass of small blisters from millions of bites we had\r\nreceived during the night.\" [97]\r\n\r\nIn a more recent book, by another Englishman, it is stated\r\nthat the Orinoco is the \"paradise of mosquitoes, and the hell\r\nof travelers. There, insects of unusual size, and speckled in an\r\nominous and snake-like manner, issued from the bush in millions and\r\nassailed every square inch of the exposed skin.... Moreover, they\r\nstung through the boots, coat and waistcoat, and drew blood wherever\r\nthey penetrated.\" [98]\r\n\r\nOn looking over these works again, we found that the miseries referred\r\nto were endured chiefly in the delta of the Orinoco, and not so much\r\nin the river above. Yet, strange to say, our experience, so far at\r\nleast, was the very contrary of all this, although we had passed\r\nthrough the delta three times. On none of these occasions had we\r\never been molested by a single mosquito or had we ever thought of\r\nusing a mosquito net. As a matter of fact, nobody ever used such a\r\nprotection against insects, as there was no call for it. Our natural\r\ninference was that the reports about this plaga of the Orinoco were\r\nmuch exaggerated, and we had reason to suspect that the same was true\r\nabout the terrific heat against which we had so repeatedly been warned.\r\n\r\nWe had been twice in La Guaira, which Humboldt declared to be one\r\nof the hottest places on earth, and had not suffered so much from\r\nthe elevated temperature there as we had frequently suffered from\r\nthe sweltering heat that so often oppresses one in New York and\r\nWashington. We remembered, too, that another German writer had\r\ncharacterized Ciudad Bolivar, on account of the intensity of the\r\nheat prevailing there, as \"the exit of hell, as La Guaira is its\r\nentrance.\" And yet during our sojourn of nearly two weeks in the\r\nOrinoco city, we never experienced the slightest discomfort from the\r\ntemperature, nor did the thermometer ever rise within ten degrees of\r\nthe temperature often registered in some of our North Atlantic coast\r\ncities during the months of July and August.\r\n\r\nThe truth was, we were beginning to grow quite sceptical about the much\r\nvaunted dangers of equatorial travel. From our experience in traveling\r\nin other lands, we had learned how prone the majority of those who do\r\nnot travel are to exaggerate--unconsciously, perhaps--dangers with\r\nwhich they have no personal acquaintance, and how inclined certain\r\ntravelers are to magnify slight discomforts and trifling occurrences\r\ninto dangerous and trying adventures, especially when their imaginary\r\ndeeds of prowess are performed in countries rarely visited, and,\r\ntherefore, beyond the control of a truthful recorder. [99]\r\n\r\nThe little heed we gave to all the dire predictions that had been so\r\nfreely volunteered and our persistence in going forward on our journey,\r\nas we had planned it, evidently led one of our friends to suspect our\r\nscepticism, and he accordingly resorted to what he honestly believed\r\nto be conclusive evidence of the futility of our purpose and the\r\ndanger of our undertaking. This was an article that had recently\r\nbeen published in an English magazine which had just reached Ciudad\r\nBolivar. The article was entitled, Adventures on the Orinoco, and\r\ncontained the following paragraph:--\r\n\r\n\"For many reasons the Orinoco is one of the most dangerous rivers\r\nin the world. Not only are there countless physical dangers in\r\nthe shape of sunken rocks, wrecks and tree trunks, huge sand banks,\r\never-changing channels and bewildering currents, but also many living,\r\nthough often hidden, perils in the form of man, beast or reptile. The\r\nhigher one ascends, and the farther one penetrates beyond the Maipures\r\nrapids into the heart of the Alto Orinoco, the wilder the scene,\r\nand the more perilous the river. Sparsely populated as is the vast\r\nregion above and immediately below the rapids, it is often the home\r\nof anarchy and misrule, and always a domain where the passions of\r\nmen know not the restraints of law, and civilization is still a dream.\"\r\n\r\nTo clinch his argument, our friend assured us that the Meta\r\nregion--whither we were bound--was far worse than that of the Upper\r\nOrinoco. The banks of the Meta were always infested by hordes of\r\nsavage Guahibos, the terror of eastern Colombia. Hiding in the dense\r\nunderbrush that skirts the river, the first indication of their\r\npresence would be a shower of well-directed, poisoned arrows against\r\nthe daring intruder into their jealously guarded domains. Only a\r\nfew months before, a steamer like ours had been attacked near the\r\nmouth of the Meta by several hundred Indians and outlaws, and we\r\nwere exposed to a similar assault from the same quarter, unless we\r\nwould listen to reason, and desist from our hazardous and reckless\r\nenterprise. \"Besides,\" he added finally, \"it is by no means certain\r\nthat your boat will be permitted to reach its destination. As you\r\nknow, the government is now engaged in quelling the revolution led by\r\none Peñalosa. Only a few days ago a large steamer was dispatched to\r\nSan Fernando, laden with arms and ammunition, and orders have been\r\nissued for your boat to call at Caicara and Urbana and be subject\r\nto the orders of the army officers there awaiting instructions from\r\nthe scene of war. If the steamer shall be needed by the government,\r\nas now seems more than probable, you will be left wherever the\r\nboat happens to be commandeered, and then you will have no means of\r\nreturning hither except in a dugout, if you are fortunate enough to\r\nfind one. To continue your course up the river in an Indian canoe,\r\nat this season of the year, at the beginning of the rainy season,\r\nis, of course, impossible.\"\r\n\r\nWe were not frightened by the thought of meeting the Indians. We had\r\nmet them before in many places, and had never found them so dangerous\r\nas depicted. The thought, however, of being put ashore, in case the\r\ngovernment should need our boat, and of being compelled to make our way\r\nback to Ciudad Bolivar in an Indian dugout was something that caused\r\nus to ponder, but not to hesitate. We had been in similar quandaries\r\nbefore, and, relying on our good luck, which has never failed us in\r\nour wanderings, we determined to take our chances. We had faith in our\r\nstar, and we instinctively felt, in spite of the untoward outlook,\r\nthat we should in due course arrive safe and sound at Orocué. We\r\nrecalled and were encouraged by Minerva's words to Ulysses:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                       tharsaleos gar anêr en pasin ameinôn\r\n    ergoisin telethei, ei kai pothen allothen elthoi. [100]\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, long after the hour scheduled for our departure from Ciudad\r\nBolivar, our boat slipped her moorings, and she was soon out in\r\nmid-river with her prow directed toward the setting sun. It was the\r\nlast week in April and the rainy season had already set in--much\r\nearlier than usual. The river had been rising rapidly for several\r\ndays, and we, therefore, had no reason to apprehend danger on the\r\nscore of shallow water. The usual time for the opening of navigation\r\nto the Upper Meta was anticipated by more than a month. This was a\r\nfavorable omen to begin with. By starting thus in advance of the usual\r\ntime we should be able to reach the river Magdalena before its high\r\nwaters would begin to subside. This was of prime importance to us,\r\nas it would enable us to escape those long and embarrassing delays\r\nthat are so frequently occasioned in this river during the dry season.\r\n\r\nThe word season has been frequently used in these pages, but, strictly\r\nspeaking, there are in the tropics no such things as seasons as we\r\nknow them in higher latitudes. In the equatorial regions it is always\r\nsummer and verdure and bloom are perennial. For the sake of convenience\r\nthe natives speak of two seasons, the rainy season, known as winter,\r\nand the dry season which is called summer. The winter season in the\r\nvalleys of the Orinoco and the Meta begins about the first of May and\r\nlasts until October. The remaining months, constituting the winter\r\nand a part of the spring of regions farther north, is known as summer.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Raleigh's account of the seasons in these parts is so\r\npertinent and so accurate in the main that I give it in his own\r\nwords. \"The winter and the summer,\" he writes, \"as touching cold and\r\nheate differ not, neither do the trees euer, senciblie lose the leaues,\r\nbut haue alwaies fruite either ripe or green at one time: But their\r\nwinter onelie consisteth of terrible raynes, and ouerflowings of the\r\nriuers, with many great storms and gusts, thunder, and lightnings,\r\nof which we had our fill, ere we returned.\" [101]\r\n\r\nOur boat was a double-deck stern-wheeler of very light draft--about\r\ntwo feet--and capable of carrying about fifty tons. Her chief cargo was\r\nsalt, groceries and dry-goods, most of which was destined for Orocué.\r\n\r\nOutside of the crew there were but few passengers--not more than\r\neight or ten all told. Among the most congenial were a Colombian\r\nfrom Bogotá, and a young German, who was traveling in the interest\r\nof a large commercial house in Ciudad Bolivar. The crew was a motley\r\none. The majority of them were Venezuelan mestizos. Besides these,\r\nthere were three or four West Indian negroes, and six or seven\r\nfull-blooded Indians from the Upper Meta. The latter had come down\r\nthe river only a few days previously and were now returning with us\r\nto their homes. They had been engaged to perform some menial services\r\naboard, for which they received a trifling compensation. They all\r\nbelonged to the ferocious tribe of Guahibos, about whom we had heard\r\nsuch frightful stories, but these particular members of the tribe we\r\nfound to be very quiet and harmless. One of them spoke Spanish fairly\r\nwell, and through him we were able to learn much about the manners and\r\ncustoms of his tribe. He was quite intelligent and took pleasure in\r\ntelling us about the mode of life and occupations of his people. Later\r\non, especially in Orocué, where we spent ten days, we were able to\r\nverify his statements. All his companions aboard, although below the\r\naverage height, were broad-shouldered, well-formed, and possessed of\r\nextraordinary strength and endurance. Judging from the work we saw them\r\ndo, we were not surprised to learn that they are considered among the\r\nbest warriors among the savage tribes in this part of South America.\r\n\r\nThe first place of any special interest on the Orinoco above Ciudad\r\nBolivar is what is known as La Puerta del Infierno--The Gate of\r\nHell. It is nothing more than a contraction of the river where the\r\ncurrent is unusually strong, and where, on account of the large rocks\r\nin the river bed, there are numerous eddies and whirlpools. From\r\nwhat we had been told, the passage at this point was more difficult\r\nand dangerous than shooting the rapids of the St. Lawrence, and the\r\nscenery was represented as grand beyond description. The scenery was\r\nwild and interesting, but far from sublime or awe-inspiring. The\r\ncurrent, it is true, was quite rapid, and our little craft made\r\nbut slow progress through the surging, seething waters, but there\r\nwas never any danger. For small sloops or schooners, and especially\r\nfor curiaras, or dugouts, the passage would doubtless be difficult\r\nand somewhat perilous. It is, however, important that the pilot and\r\nhelmsman should exercise considerable care so as to avoid striking the\r\nmassive rocks with which the bed of the river is so thickly studded.\r\n\r\nConsidering the fertility of the soil, and the splendid grazing lands\r\non the north bank of the Orinoco, one is surprised at the sparseness\r\nof the population. It is only at long intervals that one sees any\r\nsigns of human habitations, and then they are of the most primitive\r\ncharacter. Mapire and Las Bonitas are two straggling villages whose\r\ninhabitants are chiefly engaged in stock-raising. The latter place\r\nwas also at one time the centre of the tonka bean industry, but most\r\nof this trade has been transferred to Ciudad Bolivar.\r\n\r\nOf the people of Las Bonitas, the noted explorer Crevaux writes as\r\nfollows: \"Every man here has a cabin, a mandolin, a hammock, a gun,\r\na wife and the fever. These constitute all his wants.\" [102]\r\n\r\nNear the confluence of the Apure with the Orinoco is the town\r\nof Caicara, with a population of six or seven hundred souls. It\r\nis something of a distributing centre for this section of the\r\ncountry. Besides stock-raising and agriculture, which receive\r\nconsiderable attention here, there is quite a trade carried on with\r\nthe Indians of the interior, who bring into the town certain much\r\nvalued articles of commerce. Among these are hammocks, made from the\r\nleaf of the moriche palm, and ropes made from the fibres of a palm\r\ncalled by the natives chichique--attalea funifera--which are highly\r\nprized for their strength, durability, and above all, on account\r\nof their being less affected by water and moisture than ropes made\r\nfrom other materials. Large quantities of sarrapia or tonka beans are\r\nbrought here from the neighboring forests. They are much esteemed as\r\nan ingredient of certain perfumes and for flavoring tobacco.\r\n\r\nThe town has a splendid location, and under a stable and enterprising\r\ngovernment would be the centre of a large inland trade. Towering about\r\na hundred and fifty feet above the town is a hill of gneissic granite,\r\non the summit of which are the ruins of a Capuchin monastery, which\r\nhas been abandoned since the War of Independence.\r\n\r\nOur party was here augmented by a Venezuelan hide and cattle\r\nmerchant. He was a sociable fellow, and reminded us very much of a\r\nColorado or New Mexican cowboy. He left us at Urbana, the last town\r\nof any importance, between Caicara and Orocué.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Urbana, a town of about the same size and importance as\r\nCaicara, shortly after six o'clock in the evening, and were surprised\r\nthat there was no one at the landing place to meet us. At every other\r\nplace at which we had stopped, every man, woman and child was out to\r\nsee us. It is only five or six times a year that a steamer calls at\r\nthis place, and then only during the rainy season, when the river is\r\nhigh. The place was as silent as the grave, and seemed absolutely\r\ndeserted. There was not even a dog bark to break the oppressive\r\nstillness, and not a single light was to be seen in house or street. On\r\nenquiry we were informed that everybody had retired for the night. The\r\nsun had just set only a few minutes before, but like the domestic fowl\r\nin the back yard, all the denizens of the town had sought rest with\r\nthe approach of darkness, and, under ordinary circumstances, would\r\nnot have been seen before dawn the next day. This custom impressed us\r\nat first as being very extraordinary, but we afterwards learned that\r\nit is not unusual in small interior South American towns. In fact,\r\nwe soon found ourselves imitating the example of the natives. Shortly\r\nafter sunset--there is scarcely any twilight in this latitude--we\r\nsought our berth or our hammock, and rarely awoke before the caroling\r\nof the birds announced the break of another day. Of course, we often\r\nhad a special reason for retiring as early as we did. A lighted lamp,\r\nespecially on the Orinoco and the Meta, became at once the centre\r\nof attraction for a cloud of insects of all kinds--some of which\r\nemitted a most offensive odor. But aside from this we soon became\r\nquite accustomed to early slumbers. The ever warm climate seems to\r\npredispose to sleep, and, even after a good night's rest, one would\r\nwelcome an hour's siesta after luncheon.\r\n\r\nAfter the steamer whistle had blown several times, and set all the\r\ndogs in town to barking, the male population was aroused and came\r\nstraggling one by one to where we were moored. We were in need of a\r\nnew supply of provisions, as what we had brought from Ciudad Bolivar\r\nwas almost exhausted. After making the round of the town, our steward\r\nwas able, but not without difficulty, to get some eggs, chickens, and\r\na novilla--heifer. This would last us a few days, at the expiration\r\nof which we hoped to find a new supply further up the river.\r\n\r\nMuch, however, as we were concerned about our commissariat, our\r\ninterest was just then centered in the result of a confidential\r\ninterview in progress between the captain and an army officer, who was\r\nto decide whether we should be permitted to proceed on our journey,\r\nor whether our boat should be appropriated for use in the campaign\r\nagainst the revolutionists, who were said to be heading towards the\r\nllanos of the Apure. This contingency had, like the sword of Damocles,\r\nbeen hanging over us ever since we left Ciudad Bolivar. Only a few\r\ndays before, we had met a steamer returning from San Fernando de\r\nApure, whither it had been dispatched with arms and ammunition,\r\nand there were grave reasons, so we were informed, for believing\r\nthat we should be obliged to disembark at Urbana. If we could only\r\nreach Orocué, we had every reasonable hope of making the remainder\r\nof our transcontinental journey without any special difficulty or\r\ndanger. If, however, the steamer were now required for military\r\nservice, we should be obliged to remain in Urbana for an indefinite\r\nperiod, and perhaps--the thought was almost maddening--be forced to\r\nabandon entirely an enterprise on which we had so set our hearts.\r\n\r\nThe suspense, which did not last more than a half-hour--although it\r\nseemed a whole day--was finally relieved by the joyful announcement\r\nthat we should be permitted to continue our journey to Orocué. No\r\none who lives in a country like ours can realize what good news\r\nthis was to all of us. In the United States, if we miss a train,\r\nwe can get another a few hours later. There, on the contrary, far\r\noff in the wilderness, where the means of communication are so rare,\r\nthe permission to proceed was like the commutation of a sentence for\r\na long term of imprisonment into the granting of immediate liberty.\r\n\r\nAfter this happy decision had been conveyed to us, we wished to start\r\nwithout a moment's delay. Hitherto, thanks to the bright moonlight\r\nwith which we had been favored, we had been able to travel night\r\nand day. Now, for the first time, the sky became clouded, and we\r\nwere obliged, as a precautionary measure, to remain where we were,\r\nuntil the clouds disappeared. To attempt to navigate the river in\r\nthese parts, where the channel is ever changing, where there are so\r\nmany sand bars, and so many floating trees and obstructions of all\r\nkinds, would be extremely dangerous, and might mean the wrecking of\r\nour vessel when we least expected it. Fortunately, the clouds soon\r\npassed by, and we were again on our way rejoicing, and rejoicing as\r\nonly those can realize who have been placed in circumstances similar\r\nto ours at that critical juncture.\r\n\r\nThe scenery along the Orinoco between Ciudad Bolivar and Urbana is\r\nquite different from that of the delta. There we have one of Nature's\r\nhothouses on an immense scale, with a luxuriance of vegetation that\r\nis not surpassed in any part of the known world. Further up the river\r\nthere is less variety and richness, and the trees are smaller and\r\nfewer in number. One soon observes, also, a marked contrast between\r\nthe vegetation on the right as compared with that on the left bank. On\r\nthe right bank the forest land still continues, while on the left\r\nbank, for the greater part of the distance, we have the llanos or\r\nplains--for many reasons so celebrated in Venezuelan annals. On both\r\nsides the land is comparatively low and flat, although here and there,\r\nespecially on the right bank, there are highlands, and occasionally,\r\nwhen the forest fringing the river permits it, one can see hills and\r\nmountains towards the south.\r\n\r\nThe part of Venezuela south of the Orinoco--known as Venezuelan\r\nGuiana--is still practically an unknown land. Humboldt, Michelena y\r\nRojas, Schomburgk, and others, it is true, have explored portions of\r\nthe upper Orinoco and some of the tributaries, but the impenetrable\r\nforest lands through which these rivers pass are still quite\r\nunknown. [103] As to the territory north of the Orinoco and the\r\nArauca it has been quite well known since the times of the early\r\nmission period of Venezuela. Much of it, indeed, was explored by\r\nthe conquistadores.\r\n\r\nThe llanos extend southward from the mountain range bordering the\r\nCaribbean to the Orinoco and its great tributary, the Meta. They have\r\nan area more than four times as great as that of the state of New\r\nYork and are, in many respects, the most valuable lands of this part\r\nof tropical America. And strange as it may appear, they are the most\r\nneglected and most undeveloped. Their population and products are less\r\nthan they were in the days of the early missionaries, and, from present\r\nindications, there is little probability that there shall soon be any\r\nchange for the better. Everywhere are immense savannas, in which are\r\nnumerous clumps of trees and groves, swamps and lagoons, all teeming\r\nwith multitudinous forms of animal life. Here--especially along the\r\nApure--bird-life is particularly conspicuous. It is here that occur\r\nthe most extensive garceros in Venezuela, if not in South America,\r\nand it is here that the annual slaughter of the egret is greatest.\r\n\r\nTens of thousands of square miles of the llanos are inundated during\r\nthe rainy season. Then certain parts of the country present the\r\nappearance of immense inland seas. The rivers overflow their banks,\r\nand the floods rise almost to the tree tops of the nearly submerged\r\nforest. The landscape then is not unlike what it must have been during\r\nthe Carboniferous Period--immense stretches of dense, luxuriant\r\nwoodlands in a vast fresh-water sea. It is then that it seems \"an\r\nunfinished country, the mountains not yet having lent enough material\r\nto the llanos to keep them out of water during the entire year.\"\r\n\r\nFor centuries past the llanos have been famous for their immense\r\nherds of cattle and horses. It is said that Gen. Crespo, one of the\r\npresidents of Venezuela, had no fewer than two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand cattle [104] on his hatos--ranches--and we were told of an\r\nold bachelor who now has a hato that counts a hundred thousand head\r\nof cattle, not to speak of an immense number of horses.\r\n\r\nDuring the War of Independence the wild horses and cattle were in some\r\nparts \"so numerous as literally to render it necessary for a party of\r\ncavalry to precede an army on the march, for the purpose of clearing\r\nthe way for the infantry and guns.\" [105] And only a few decades ago,\r\nwe were assured, the number of cattle was so great that they were\r\nslaughtered for their hides alone. During recent years, however,\r\nowing to the number of revolutions, and the little encouragement\r\nafforded by the government to stock raisers, the herds on the llanos\r\nhave greatly dwindled in size and number. [106]\r\n\r\nUnder favorable conditions they could with ease greatly be multiplied,\r\nand be made to contribute materially to the world's beef supply. The\r\nunlimited pampas, with their rich, succulent grasses, ten to twelve\r\nfeet high, are capable of supporting millions of cattle, and there\r\nis no reason why they should not be made available for the European\r\nand North American markets at much lower prices than the beef that is\r\nshipped from Argentina and Australia. Specially constructed cattle\r\nboats, of light draft, could be made to ply the Orinoco, the Apure,\r\nthe Arauca and the Meta at all seasons of the year. Under a settled\r\nand progressive government the grazing industry should be the chief\r\nsource of revenue of the Venezuelan republic. But, as conditions\r\nnow are, cattle raising is in a most deplorable state. When we asked\r\nthe Llaneros--people of the plains--along the Orinoco and the Meta\r\nwhy they did not have larger herds on their magnificent savannas,\r\nthey invariably replied: \"What is the use? We get a large herd, and\r\nthen there is a revolution. The army comes along and appropriates\r\nour cattle, and we never get a penny for them.\"\r\n\r\nDuring our trip up the Orinoco we tried at a conuco--small farm--to\r\npurchase some chickens, but were told by the proprietor that, although\r\nhe usually had large numbers for sale, he did not then have a single\r\none left. \"I heard yesterday that the revolutionists were coming this\r\nway\"--he had heard of the Peñalosa outbreak--\"and I at once killed all\r\nmy chickens and gave my family and friends a great chicken feast. If\r\nthe soldiers had come they would have taken all and would not have\r\ngiven me anything for them.\"\r\n\r\nThere are no better horsemen in the world than the Llaneros of\r\nVenezuela and Colombia. They have often been called the Cossacks of\r\nSouth America, and the name is not undeserved. In daring feats of\r\nhorsemanship their only rivals are the cowboys of our western plains,\r\nand the intrepid Gauchos of the pampas of Argentina.\r\n\r\nAnd no one has a greater love for horses than has the Llanero. Like\r\nthe Arab, he would rather part with his most cherished possessions than\r\ndispose of a favorite steed. For one who has met this modern Centaur,\r\nor who is familiar with his mode of life, the reason is evident. As\r\nthe Llanero spends the greater part of his life on horseback, his\r\nfaithful charger is to him, as to the Arab, not only a companion,\r\nbut his dearest and most reliable friend. Hence one need not be\r\nsurprised to hear him exclaim in the words of a llano bard:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"Mi mujer y mi caballo\r\n        Se murieron a un tiempo;\r\n        Que mujer, ni que demonio,\r\n        Mi caballo es lo que siento.\" [107]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"All his actions and exertions,\" declares Páez, \"must be assisted by\r\nhis horse; for him the noblest effort of man is when, gliding swiftly\r\nover the boundless plains and bending over his spirited charger,\r\nhe overturns an enemy or masters a wild bull.\"\r\n\r\nLike the character described by Victor Hugo, \"He would not fight\r\nexcept on horseback. He forms but one person with his horse. He lives\r\non horseback; trades, buys and sells on horseback; eats, drinks,\r\nsleeps and dreams on horseback.\"\r\n\r\nGive the Llanero a horse, and the equipment of a lance and a gun, a\r\nponcho and a hammock, and he is independent. With these he is at home\r\nwherever the setting sun may happen to find him. The hammock serves\r\nhim for a bed, and the poncho for a protection against sun and rain,\r\nwhile with his lance and gun he can easily secure the food he may\r\nrequire. Having these things, he is happy, and although he may be\r\npoor in all other worldly goods, he is ever ready merrily to sing\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"Con mi lanza y mi caballo\r\n        No me import a la fortuna,\r\n        Alumbre o no alumbre el sol\r\n        Brille o no brille la luna.\" [108]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the Llaneros who during the war with Spain contributed so\r\nmuch towards achieving the independence of both Venezuela and New\r\nGranada. Under their leader, Páez, they allowed the Spanish army\r\nno peace day or night. Armed with their long lances, they seemed to\r\nbe ubiquitous and pursued their enemies with unrelenting fury. And\r\nthe novelty of their methods of warfare--an anticipation of those\r\nso successfully employed by the Boers in their recent war with\r\nEngland--were such as quite to disconcert those who rigidly adhered to\r\nthe tactics in vogue in Europe. On one occasion Páez dislodged a large\r\ndetachment of Spaniards by driving wild cattle against them, and then,\r\nburning the grass by which they were surrounded, utterly destroyed\r\nall of them. How like De Wett's methods in the Transvaal! [109]\r\n\r\nOn another occasion it was necessary for Bolivar's army to cross\r\nthe Apure, near San Fernando, in order to engage Morillo, whose\r\nheadquarters were then at Calabozo. But Bolivar had no boats, and the\r\nApure at this point was wide and deep. Besides, the Spanish flotilla\r\nwas guarding the river at the point opposite to which the patriot\r\nforces were marching. Bolivar was in despair. Turning to Páez, he said,\r\n\"I would give the world to have possession of the Spanish flotilla,\r\nfor without it I can never cross the river, and the troops are unable\r\nto march.\" \"It shall be yours in an hour,\" replied Páez. Selecting\r\nthree hundred of his Llanero lancers, all distinguished for strength\r\nand bravery, he said, pointing to the gun-boats, \"We must have these\r\nflecheras or die. Let those follow Tio [110] who please.\" And at the\r\nsame moment, spurring his horse, he dashed into the river and swam\r\ntowards the flotilla. The guard followed him with their lances in their\r\nhands, now encouraging their horses to bear up against the current\r\nby swimming by their sides and patting their necks, and shouting to\r\nscare away the crocodiles, of which there were hundreds in the river,\r\ntill they reached the boats, when mounting their horses, they sprang\r\nfrom their backs on board them, headed by their leader, and to the\r\nastonishment of those who beheld them from the shore, captured every\r\none of them. To English officers it may appear inconceivable that a\r\nbody of cavalry with no other arms than their lances, and no other\r\nmode of conveyance across a rapid river than their horses, should\r\nattack and take a fleet of gun-boats amidst shoals of alligators; but\r\nstrange as it may seem, it was actually accomplished, and there are\r\nmany officers now in England who can testify to the truth of it. [111]\r\n\r\nThe islands between Urbana and the cataracts of Atures have long\r\nbeen famous for the number of turtles that annually congregate on\r\nthem. During the dry season they come to these islands by hundreds\r\nof thousands, and deposit their eggs in the playas, or sand banks,\r\nwhich are here quite extensive. So great is their number, says Padre\r\nGumilla, that \"It would be as difficult to count the grains of sand\r\non the shores of the Orinoco as to count the immense numbers of\r\nturtles that inhabit its margins and waters. Were it not for the vast\r\nconsumption of turtles and their eggs, the river Orinoco, despite its\r\ngreat magnitude, would be unnavigable, for vessels would be impeded\r\nby the enormous multitude of the turtles.\" [112]\r\n\r\nHumboldt estimated the number which, in his time, annually deposited\r\ntheir eggs on the banks of the middle Orinoco to be nearly a\r\nmillion. Owing to the abandonment of the system of collecting the\r\neggs, that prevailed in the time of the missionaries, the number of\r\nturtles is not now so great as formerly. The amount of oil, however,\r\nthat is still prepared from turtle eggs, is sufficient to constitute\r\nquite an important article of commerce. The time of the Cosecha--egg\r\nharvest--always brings together a large crowd of Indians of various\r\ntribes, besides a number of pulperos--small traders--from Urbana and\r\nCiudad Bolivar.\r\n\r\nTo our great disappointment, we arrived a few days too late for the\r\nharvest. We were able to see no more than a few belated turtles here\r\nand there and the abandoned palm-leaf huts that served to protect\r\nthe Indians from the sun during their temporary residence on these\r\nsand banks which have been the favorite resorts of countless turtles\r\nfrom time immemorial. Our steward was fortunate enough to get a large\r\nfine turtle, weighing fully fifty pounds, and we had turtle steak\r\nand turtle soup that would delight the most confirmed epicure. Our\r\nchef, we may add in this connection, took pride in his work, and his\r\nskill and attention contributed not a little to the pleasure of our\r\nfortnight's voyage on the little steamer which he served so well.\r\n\r\nA matter of ever-increasing astonishment to us was the continued great\r\nwidth of the Orinoco, after we had passed such immense tributaries\r\nas the Caroni, the Caura, the Apure, and the Arauca. Near Urbana,\r\nsix hundred miles from its mouth, it has a breadth of more than three\r\nmiles. This peculiar feature of the great river has attracted the\r\nattention of travelers from the earliest times.\r\n\r\nPadre Gilli, a learned missionary, who spent more than eighteen years\r\nin the Orinoco region, thus writes of the great river in his informing\r\nSaggio de Storia Americana, \"One cannot understand how the external\r\nappearance of the Orinoco remains practically uniform, except near\r\nits source, whether the waters of other rivers are or are not added\r\nto it.\" [113] Depons tells us that the inhabitants attribute to the\r\nwaters of the Orinoco \"many medical virtues, and affirm that they\r\npossess the power of dispelling wens and such like tumors.\" [114] As\r\nfor ourselves, we made no experiments in this direction. We found the\r\nwater so muddy from the delta to the Meta, that if a tumbler full of it\r\nwere set aside for a while, the bottom of the glass became covered with\r\nquite a thick layer of yellow sediment. We did not find it to possess\r\nthe offensive, disgusting odor, due to dead crocodiles, turtles and\r\nmanatees of which many travelers have complained, but we did take good\r\ncare never to drink any of it without having it carefully filtered.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Ciudad Bolivar we had a limited supply of ice in a small\r\nrefrigerator. This was a real luxury while it lasted. At first we\r\nthought it would be difficult to become accustomed to drinking the warm\r\nwater of the river--it had a temperature of 82° F.--but we soon became\r\nquite used to it, and rarely, if ever, thought of the absence of ice.\r\n\r\nWe had spent nearly two months in Venezuela and were about to enter\r\nthe neighboring republic of Colombia. During that period we had\r\nvisited most of the chief cities of the coast and of the interior,\r\nand had come into contact with all classes of people. We had talked\r\nwith them about matters religious, educational, social, economic,\r\npolitical, and only rarely did they manifest any disinclination to\r\nexpress their honest opinions about men and things. Apart from a\r\ncertain class of professional revolutionists--who have everything to\r\ngain and nothing to lose from internecine strife--we found that the\r\ngreat majority of the population is, in spite of what has been said to\r\nthe contrary, peace-loving and thoroughly sick of the turmoil of which\r\nthey have so long been the helpless victims. The better element--old\r\nVenezuelan families of Spanish descent--which should be the ruling\r\nelement, but which is too often kept in the background by ambitious\r\nadventurers and unscrupulous spoilsmen, have lofty ideals for their\r\ncountry, and long to see it become the home of peace and industry,\r\nof progress and culture.\r\n\r\nFor few, if for any of the countries of South America, has Nature\r\ndone more than for Venezuela.\r\n\r\nShe has in the first place the dominating advantage of location. She\r\nis nearer to Europe and the United States than any of the other South\r\nAmerican republics, and should, under a strong and stable government,\r\nenjoy corresponding trade advantages. From her numerous ports on\r\nthe Caribbean sea, as well as from points on the Orinoco and its\r\naffluents, freight can be transferred in a few days to our ports\r\non the Gulf and Atlantic coast, while from La Guaira to Cadiz the\r\ndistance is but little greater than it is from New York to London.\r\n\r\nAnd what a great commercial future there is for this at present\r\nhapless and neglected country when it shall be blessed by wise and\r\nprogressive rulers! It has soil of marvelous fertility and possesses\r\nmineral deposits of all kinds and of untold value. It has tens of\r\nthousands of square miles of the best grazing land in the world,\r\ncapable of supporting millions of cattle. In the lowlands all the\r\nproductions of the tropics are found and their annual yield could\r\nbe enormously increased. In the plateaus of the mountain chains\r\nare produced the fruits and cereals of the temperate zone--of the\r\nbest quality and in surprising abundance. Then there are the rare\r\nand beautiful woods of its interminable virgin forests; sources of\r\nwealth yet untouched and all but unknown, except to the few who have\r\nexplored this land of marvelous natural resources.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of Nature's gifts to Venezuela. But the extent of her\r\nbounty is as astonishing as its variety. How few are there who have\r\nan adequate conception of the extent of this country? It is a land\r\nthat is scarcely known to the general reader except in connection\r\nwith one of its periodic revolutions. And yet it has an area almost\r\nseven times as great as that of Great Britain and nearly ten times\r\nas great as that of the whole of New England. In extent of territory\r\nit equals France, Germany and Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands,\r\nIreland and Switzerland all combined.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, incredible as it may appear, its total population, including\r\nIndians--savage as well as civilized--is less than that of New\r\nYork City. If the population of Venezuela were as dense as that\r\nof Belgium the country would count three hundred and fifty-eight\r\nmillion inhabitants.\r\n\r\nSparse as is the population, it is rather a matter of surprise that\r\nthe number of inhabitants is so great rather than that it is so\r\nsmall. During a period of seventy years there have been no fewer than\r\nseventy-six revolutions. During sixty of these years the country has\r\nseen two armies almost continually in the field. The poor soldiers,\r\nmere puppets of soulless adventurers, rarely knew what they were\r\nfighting for. Against their will, they were torn from their homes\r\nand families to enable ambitious leaders to get control of the\r\ngovernment. The death-rate has been appalling--at times greater by far\r\nthan the birth-rate. Some of the revolutions, it is estimated, have\r\ncaused the loss of more than a hundred thousand lives. For this reason,\r\nthere has been a decrease in the population during the last fifty years\r\ninstead of an increase. Indeed, it may be questioned whether there\r\nare as many inhabitants in the country to-day as there were before the\r\nwar with Spain, or even at the time it was first visited by Europeans.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to name another country, except possibly Haiti,\r\nwhere, in proportion to the population, war has wrought greater\r\nravages and counted more victims. A country that should be a land of\r\npeace and plenty has for generations been an armed camp of contending\r\nfactions, in which the worst elements have come to the front and in\r\nwhich justice and innocence and respectability have been trampled under\r\nfoot. With all this were the usual concomitants of such a condition of\r\naffairs--atrocities that the pen would fail to describe, deaths from\r\nfamine and pestilence, deaths from the machete and from imprisonment\r\nin dark and foul dungeons.\r\n\r\nLike northern Italy, after the death of Frederick II, Venezuela,\r\nin the words of Dante, has been for nearly a century\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              \"Full\r\n        Of tyrants, and the veriest peasant lad\r\n        Becomes Marcellus in the strife of parties.\" [115]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd there was the consequent stagnation of business and paralysis of\r\nindustry of every kind, and the destruction of property on a scale\r\nthat seems incredible. Such has been the fate of Venezuela since\r\nthe time of Bolivar, whom its people hail as the Liberator, as the\r\nWashington of South America.\r\n\r\nBut pitiful as has been the country's lot, unfortunate as it is to-day,\r\nthe future is not without hope. Only one thing is necessary to change\r\nthe present lamentable condition of affairs, and convert Venezuela into\r\na great and happy country. That one thing is a man--a ruler of strong\r\narm and stout heart, who is a patriot in deed as well as in name;\r\na president who, forgetful of self, will devote himself entirely to\r\nthe development of the country's resources and to the happiness of\r\nhis people; a statesman, who will be intelligent enough and forceful\r\nenough to bring order out of chaos, and give to a long-suffering\r\npeople those blessings of civilization which, for generations past,\r\nthey have known only by name. [116]\r\n\r\nThe task is difficult, very difficult, but it is not impossible. It\r\nis only a few decades ago since Mexico was as turbulent a country\r\nand as noted for pronunciamentos and revolutions as Venezuela is\r\nto-day. Lawlessness was rampant, credit was gone, commerce languished\r\nand the only railroad was a short one extending from Vera Cruz to the\r\nnational capital. Within a single generation this has been all changed,\r\nand through the efforts of one man--Porfirio Diaz. Under his wise and\r\nbeneficent guidance, Mexico has emerged from that state of confusion\r\nand anarchy from which she had so long suffered, and now occupies\r\nan honored position among the nations of the world. Give Venezuela\r\na statesman and a patriot of the stamp of Garcia Moreno or of Diaz,\r\nor of our own Roosevelt, and she, too, from being a comparative waste,\r\nwill be made to bloom as the rose, and, from being a byword among the\r\npeoples of the earth, will be enabled to attain to that commercial\r\nand economic eminence which is hers by nature and manifest destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nEL RIO META\r\n\r\n\r\n                            \"Yendo de la manera que refiero\r\n                            Habiendo muchos dias navegado,\r\n                            Dieron en la gran boca del estero\r\n                            De Meta sumamente deseado:\r\n                            Alegrose cualquiera compañero,\r\n                            Pensando ser concluso su cuidado,\r\n                            Pues aunque de poblado no ven cosa,\r\n                            La tierra se muestra mas lustrosa.\"\r\n\r\n                                        --Juan de Castellanos. [117]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Having traveled many days in the manner above described, we finally\r\nreached the mouth of the much desired Meta. Every one rejoiced,\r\nthinking their gravest solicitudes were at an end. And although no\r\nhuman habitations were visible, nevertheless the land was of a bright\r\nand cheerful aspect.\"\r\n\r\nThus, in sonorous octava rima, does the illustrious historiographer of\r\nTunja [118] give expression to the joy which Alonso de Herrera and his\r\ncompanions experienced on their arrival at what they fondly hoped was\r\nthe goal of their long and daring expedition. It was now more than a\r\nyear since they had left the mouth of the Orinoco. Before starting on\r\ntheir adventurous journey, they had to construct flat-bottomed boats\r\nand make other preparations indispensable for a voyage so replete\r\nwith danger and of such uncertain duration.\r\n\r\nHerrera was the second of the conquistadores to reach the Meta by\r\nthe Orinoco. He was drawn thither by the reports of vast amounts of\r\ngold existing in the province of the Meta. But the reports proved\r\nto be as misleading in his case as they had been in that of so many\r\nother valiant leaders of expeditions in search of another Mexico or\r\nPeru. He had scarcely reached what he was led to believe was the land\r\nof gold and precious stones when, in a fight with Indians, his life\r\nwas cut short by a poisoned arrow.\r\n\r\nUnlike Herrera, we were glad of our arrival at the Meta, not because we\r\nwere in hopes of finding treasure in its neighborhood, but because we\r\nwere at last sure that our boat would not be commandeered for military\r\npurposes. True, we had been told at Urbana that there was nothing to\r\napprehend on this score, but we were not entirely satisfied with the\r\nassurances given. When, however, we had entered the Meta, we were in\r\nColombian territory and away from Venezuelan telegraphs and dispatch\r\nboats. After this we had no further anxiety, for we had every reason to\r\nbelieve that we should arrive in due course at our destination--Orocué.\r\n\r\nAlthough Herrera's voyage to the Meta took place as early as 1535, he\r\nwas not the first Spaniard to explore this part of South America. Diego\r\nde Ordaz, a captain under Cortes in Mexico, had preceded him to this\r\nregion by four years. Instead of continuing his journey up the Meta,\r\nas he had been advised by his Indian guides, who assured him that\r\ntoward the west he would find an abundance of gold, he endeavored\r\nto go towards the south on the Orinoco. He found his plans thwarted\r\nby the great rapids he encountered--probably those of Atures or\r\nMaipures--and was compelled to return without having accomplished\r\nanything more than making a general reconnoissance of the country\r\nthrough which he had passed.\r\n\r\nI refer especially to the expedition of Diego de Ordaz because it was\r\nthe first of those famous expeditions made on the great rivers of the\r\nNew World by the conquistadores. He anticipated Orellana's marvelous\r\nvoyage down the Amazon by nearly ten years.\r\n\r\nI have also another reason--a personal one--for alluding to\r\nit. Twenty-five years before my arrival at the juncture of the Orinoco\r\nand the Meta I had made the ascent of Popocatepetl and explored the\r\nsame crater from which, more than three and a half centuries before,\r\nDiego de Ordaz, to the great amazement of the Indians, had taken out\r\nsulphur for the manufacture of gunpowder. When scaling this lofty\r\nvolcano, I had frequently thought of the courage and endurance of this\r\ndauntless Spaniard in accomplishing a task which was then far more\r\ndifficult than it is now. According to Herrera it was then in action,\r\nand the smoke and flames rendered the ascent next to impossible. To\r\nthe Indians the crater was the mouth of hell in which tyrants had to\r\nbe purified before they could enter the abode of the blest.\r\n\r\nBut difficult and hazardous as was the ascent of Popocatepetl, the\r\nvoyage up the Orinoco was, in the days of Ordaz, far more so. Not\r\nso to-day, when the trip can be made in a steamer with comparative\r\nease and comfort. But it did seem strange--passing strange--that\r\nwe two should have visited two such unlikely places and so widely\r\nseparated from each other in time and space. It was almost like having\r\na rendezvous with an old friend. I confess that I not only thought\r\nof Ordaz, but imagined that I felt his presence.\r\n\r\nThe great conquistador should have been permitted not only to wear\r\na burning volcano on his armorial bearings--as was allowed him\r\nby Charles V--but he should also have been granted the privilege\r\nof having depicted on his coat of arms one of the great rapids of\r\nthe Orinoco--La Puerta del Infierno--for instance, which he had so\r\nsuccessfully passed. His achievements have been eclipsed by many of\r\nhis contemporaries, but in enterprise and daring he is second to none.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, we were glad--very glad--to reach the Meta, but I\r\npersonally felt a pang of regret on leaving the Orinoco. Nothing would\r\nhave pleased me more than to have continued on the waters of this\r\ngreat river until we should have reached the wonderful Cassiquiare,\r\nwhich connects the Orinoco with the great Rio Negro and with the\r\nstill greater Amazon. I consoled myself with the thought that\r\npossibly I might be able to make this journey later on, and then\r\nprobably extend it through the Madeira, Mamoré, Pilcomayo and Parana\r\nto Buenos Ayres. This had long been a fond dream of mine. Will it\r\never be realized? In the language of one of my Spanish companions,\r\nDios verá--God will see--for it is not impossible.\r\n\r\nI say it is not impossible, because a part of the journey--from the\r\nOrinoco to the Amazon--has often been made and is still frequently\r\nmade every year by traders, missionaries and others. And contrary to\r\nwhat is often asserted, it is not an undertaking of any particular\r\ndifficulty or danger. The same may be said of the journey from the\r\nAmazon to the Parana.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that the first to make the journey between\r\nthe Amazon and the Orinoco, by way of the Cassiquiare, were Lópe de\r\nAguirre, the traitor, and his companions, who went from Peru to the\r\nnorthern coast of Venezuela in 1561. The first white man to pass from\r\nthe Orinoco to the Rio Negro by the Cassiquiare was the missionary,\r\nPadre Román. He made the round trip from his mission near the mouth\r\nof the Meta to the Rio Negro in about eight months, and at a time\r\nwhen some of his associates--Padre Gumilla among the number--were\r\nendeavoring to prove that there was no connection between the Orinoco\r\nand the Amazon, and that, consequently, a journey from one to the\r\nother by boat was impossible. [119]\r\n\r\nAfter Padre Román's time the journey between the Amazon, the Orinoco\r\nand vice versa was a very ordinary occurrence for missionaries\r\nand traders. It was made in 1756 by the Spanish commission sent to\r\nsettle the boundary line between Brazil and Venezuela, by Humboldt\r\nand Bonpland, Michelena y Rojas and numerous other explorers who have\r\nleft us accounts of their travels.\r\n\r\nSince the missions have been suppressed the Indian population between\r\nUrbana and San Fernando de Atabapo has greatly diminished and, as\r\na result, the traveler at times finds great difficulty in securing\r\nboats and rowers. In Humboldt's time the trip was comparatively\r\neasy. There were flourishing missions along the entire course of his\r\ntravels--through New Andalusia and Barcelona, through the llanos of\r\nVenezuela, along the Orinoco from Angostura to Urbana and from Urbana\r\nto the Brazilian frontier on the Rio Negro.\r\n\r\nNow all this is changed. If he could return to the scene of his\r\nfamous explorations he would not be able to locate even the site\r\nof many of the missions where he was so kindly entertained and of\r\nwhose hospitality he writes in terms of such unstinted praise. From\r\nCiudad Bolivar to San Carlos on the Rio Negro--a distance of nearly a\r\nthousand miles--he would not find more than one or two at most. Even\r\nSan Fernando de Atabapo, that in Humboldt's time was the capital of\r\na province and an important missionary centre, is to-day without a\r\npastor. A priest from Ciudad Bolivar goes to this distant place--more\r\nthan seven hundred miles away--once a year to look after the spiritual\r\nwelfare of the few inhabitants that still remain there. The other\r\nmissions, of which the illustrious savant gives us such interesting\r\naccounts, have long since disappeared, and the places they occupied\r\nare now covered with a dark, impenetrable forest growth. Most of these\r\nwere suppressed at the time of the War of Independence, or died out\r\nduring the countless revolutions that have since desolated the country.\r\n\r\nIn the kindly and hospitable padres in charge of these missions,\r\nHumboldt always found counselors and friends, and in some of his\r\nlongest and most difficult journeys they also proved to be his best\r\nand most intelligent guides. It was through them, too, that he was\r\nable always to obtain food, boats and boatmen--three essentials that\r\nthe traveler of to-day often finds it extremely difficult to procure.\r\n\r\nShortly before entering the Meta we passed through the Raudal de\r\nCariben, a swift and foaming cataract, which rushes between immense\r\nmasses of black granite that stand like sentinels on both sides of\r\nthe river to warn the navigator against the perils of further advance.\r\n\r\nThe forms of the rocks are bizarre in the extreme. Some of them are\r\ncolumnar in structure and resemble the sombre pillars of a Hindoo\r\ntemple. Others are more fantastic in shape and would easily pass\r\nfor a Sardinian noraghe in ruins. From one point of view the rocks\r\npresent the appearance of a dismantled fortress with its bastions,\r\nparapets and embrasures; its glacis, scarps and counter-scarps.\r\n\r\nBut the most singular spectacle of all is a formation on the right\r\nbank of the river that seemed, for all the world, to be a petrified\r\nbattleship--just such a man of war as might have been fashioned by the\r\nhammer of Thor and used by a race of Titans. The celebrated Garden of\r\nthe Gods in Colorado does not exhibit more grotesque or diversified\r\nrock formations than does the Raudal of Cariben and it is entirely\r\ndevoid of that wonderful setting given the Orinoco by the luxuriant\r\ntropical forest and a cataract that resembles in many respects the\r\nrapids above the Falls of Niagara.\r\n\r\nOne is not surprised to learn that the Indians have woven many legends\r\nabout this cataract, which is almost as picturesque as are those\r\nof Atures and Maipures further up the river. And still less is one\r\nsurprised to read of the accounts given by the early missionaries\r\nof the difficulties and perils attending the passage of these\r\nrapids. For small craft, especially canoes, it is necessary to keep\r\nthem near the shore and punt them, or pull them along by ropes. With\r\nour stern-wheeler we never felt that there was any danger, but our\r\nprogress was exceedingly slow. At times we were actually at a stand\r\nstill and once or twice it looked as if we were going to be carried\r\ndown stream, so great was the force of the current. But finally,\r\nafter a long and determined struggle, we passed the cataract in\r\nsafety. To be frank, we all experienced a feeling of relief when we\r\nsaw that all the reefs and remolinos--whirlpools--were behind us,\r\nand that we were again once more in placid and safe water.\r\n\r\n\"Este raudal es muy maluco,\" [120]--this cataract is very bad--said\r\nour pilot to us after the strain was over. \"It is much more difficult\r\nto steer a boat through it than through La Puerto del Infierno,\r\nnear Ciudad Bolivar.\" Fortunately for all concerned, he knew his\r\nbusiness well and was as conscientious as he was skillful. He had\r\nbeen navigating the Orinoco and the Meta for nearly twenty years\r\nand was thoroughly familiar with every feature and peculiarity of\r\nboth of them. He had never had an accident and was justly proud\r\nof his record. He had the eye of a hawk and could judge of the\r\nrelative depths of the water by differences of color that were quite\r\nimperceptible to the ordinary observer. Only once, during our entire\r\njourney, did we graze a sandbar, and that was only for a moment. But\r\nit was quite sufficient to make a young Ethiopian among our crew\r\nthink that his last day had arrived, and that we were surely going\r\nto the bottom. Greatly frightened, he turned to us and remarked,\r\n\"It am very unwholesome to travel in dis ribber. Dat am certain.\"\r\n\r\nIt was at the mouth of the Meta, according to certain alarmists whom we\r\nhad met in Ciudad Bolivar, that we should be exposed to grave danger\r\nfrom savages. A band of murderous Guahibos, led by a certain sambo\r\n[121]--a refugee from the llanos of Venezuela--had for some time,\r\nwe were assured, been stationed at this point, where they attacked\r\nevery vessel that passed by, and where they had already robbed and\r\nkilled a large number of people who had ventured too near the outlaw's\r\nlair. The first intimation of their presence, we were told, would be\r\na shower of poisoned arrows from the dense underbrush where the enemy\r\nwould be concealed. But this report, like so many others regarding\r\nthe dangers of our journey, proved to be unfounded. There was not\r\na Guahibo, much less a sambo leader to be seen anywhere. Everything\r\nwas as quiet as on the proverbial Potomac.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Meta, Padre Gilli says: \"Its width is greater than that\r\nof a dozen Tibers, and in the summer season, when the wind is high,\r\nthe waves become very large.\" [122] Far from being an exaggeration, as\r\nmight appear to the reader, this statement is rather an underestimate\r\nof the reality, at least as regards its breadth. In places it is fully\r\ntwo miles wide--almost as broad as the Orinoco near the delta. And\r\nthis is not because of the shallowness of the river. According to\r\nHumboldt, its mean depth near its mouth is thirty-six feet, and it\r\nsometimes attains to more than twice this depth.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief affluents of the Meta from the north is the river\r\nCasanare. We were much interested in this on account of its historical\r\nassociations. It was down this river that Don Antonio Berrio, the\r\nson-in-law of the famous adelantado, Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada,\r\ncame on his celebrated expedition from Bogotá to Trinidad. He was the\r\nfirst white man to undertake this long journey, and, considering the\r\ndifficulties of travel at that time, through an unknown land, and often\r\nthrough the territory of hostile savages, his finally attaining his\r\ndestination was, indeed, a wonderful achievement, comparable, in some\r\nrespects, with that of Orellana down the Amazon a few decades before.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the Casanare river was the favorite route of the\r\nmissionaries who went from Bogotá to evangelize the various tribes\r\nwho dwelt in the valley of the Meta and in the valleys of many of its\r\nchief tributaries. Indeed, for a long time some of the most flourishing\r\nmissions in New Granada were in the country through which we are now\r\npassing. But after the religious orders in charge of the missions were\r\nwithdrawn or suppressed, the Indians returned to their native wilds,\r\nand gradually reverted to their original savage condition.\r\n\r\nMuch as we tried, we could not discover even a vestige of any of the\r\nformer missions on the Meta. And not only have the former villages and\r\ntowns disappeared, but even the Indian tribes who, at one time, were\r\nso numerous on both sides of the river, seem to have vanished also. We\r\nsailed an entire week on the Meta without seeing or hearing a single\r\nhuman being. In some cases the Indians have, for greater security,\r\nretired into the depths of the forest. In others, war and disease have\r\ndone their work and whole tribes, as in other parts of South America,\r\nhave been exterminated. The names of the mission villages and towns\r\nalong the Meta still figure on the maps, but the traveler is unable to\r\nfind the slightest trace of even the sites on which they were located.\r\n\r\nAbout the least favorable place in the world for cultivating literature\r\nwould, one would think, be in a rude hut in an Indian village on the\r\nMeta. And yet, strange as it may seem, one of the most interesting\r\nand valuable works that have ever been written on the missions of\r\nSouth America, on the manners, customs, and languages of the various\r\nIndian tribes of the plains and forests of Colombia, was produced on\r\nthe banks of the Meta.\r\n\r\nIts author was the zealous and scholarly Padre Juan Rivero, who\r\nspent sixteen years as a missionary in this part of the New World. He\r\nwrote many works on doctrinal subjects in their own language for the\r\nbenefit of the Indians. Besides this he gave to the world what are\r\nprobably the most useful grammars in existence of several of the more\r\nimportant languages and dialects spoken by the various tribes among\r\nwhom he labored with such marked success.\r\n\r\nThe work, however, to which I specially refer, is his Historia de las\r\nMisiones de los Llanos de Casanare y los Rios Orinoco y Meta. [123] It\r\nhas been the basis of many other works on the same subject--Gumilla's\r\nEl Orinoco Ilustrado for example--but, notwithstanding the numerous\r\nbooks that have been written since then on the Indians of the\r\nOrinoco and its tributaries, Rivero's is still facile princeps,\r\nand must always be consulted by one who desires accurate knowledge\r\nregarding the condition, character, rivalries and wars of the divers\r\nsavage tribes to whom he preached the gospel of peace and brotherly\r\nlove. Besides this, he gives us exact information concerning the\r\ngeography of the country through which he passed and affords us\r\nentertaining accounts of its fauna and flora. He supplies us, too,\r\nwith rare and curious data of great scientific value to the historian\r\nand ethnologist, and gives us the benefit of his unique experience as\r\nto the best means of civilizing and Christianizing the savage hordes\r\nthat in his day--1720 to 1736--wandered over the plains and through\r\nthe woodlands of northern South America.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed in consequence of the recognized importance of his work,\r\nas a contribution to the solution of certain social and economical\r\ndifficulties, that confronted the Colombian government some decades\r\nago, that it was finally published in 1883, after lying in the dust\r\nin manuscript for nearly a hundred and fifty years.\r\n\r\nFor several years some of the Indians of eastern Colombia had given\r\ngreat trouble to the whites in the more distant settlements. Robberies\r\nand massacres and atrocities were becoming daily more frequent and\r\nthe numerous savage hordes threatened to extend their incursions\r\ntoward the villages and towns of the interior. The inhabitants were\r\nin consternation and called upon the government to devise immediate\r\nmeans for their safety and protection. The authorities were willing to\r\ndo anything in their power but did not know what steps to take. They\r\nhad to deal with a foe about whose character, numbers and home they\r\nwere almost entirely ignorant.\r\n\r\nIt was then that someone, by a happy inspiration, suggested calling\r\nin as adviser one who knew more about the Indians than any of the\r\nofficials of the government, one who had long lived among them and had\r\nwon their confidence and affection, one, consequently, who would be\r\nbetter able to counsel in the emergency that confronted the government\r\nthan any one else that could be named.\r\n\r\nThe adviser and expert was one who had been dead nearly a century\r\nand a half--the sainted missionary Padre Juan Rivero. He could not\r\ntestify orally, but his great manuscript work on the Indians was in the\r\narchives of Bogotá, and it was decided to print it at once, and in this\r\nwise give the public the benefit of the great missionary's advice and\r\nutilize his knowledge of a wild and untractable race that had already\r\nbecome a serious menace to the peace and prosperity of the country.\r\n\r\nWhen published, the book was found to be so modern in many of the views\r\nexpressed, so well adapted to supply information then sorely needed,\r\nthat it appeared to be written expressly to meet recent difficulties\r\nand throw light on questions that modern legislators and political\r\neconomists had been discussing, but without sufficient knowledge or\r\nthe necessary data. Both the data and the knowledge were furnished\r\nby Padre Rivero of happy memory.\r\n\r\nIn the preface to his work the author tells us of the difficulties\r\nunder which he labored in its production. \"The banks of the Meta,\"\r\nhe writes, \"have been the workshop in which this work has been\r\nforged. Here the inconvenience of the house in which I live, the\r\nconcourse of Indians with their importunate demands, the visits of\r\nthe heathen Chiricoas, who are the most noisy chatterers conceivable,\r\nand various other disturbances, which would require time to recount,\r\nhave been the retirement which I have enjoyed, and the quiet which\r\nhas been allowed me for such an undertaking.\" [124]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Indians who inhabited the llanos and the banks of\r\nsuch rivers as the Casanare and the Meta, he declares they were as\r\nnumerous as the sands of the seashore and the stars of heaven. During\r\nmore than three weeks spent in the valley of the Meta, we saw but one\r\nsmall encampment of wild Indians--Indios bravos--about midway between\r\nCariben and Orocué. They greeted us in a friendly manner and seemed\r\nto be a very harmless people. They were Guahibos, those merciless\r\nsavages who, we were assured, would be lying in ambush awaiting our\r\narrival, prepared to assail us with a shower of poisoned arrows,\r\npreparatory to serving us up at one of their cannibalistic feasts.\r\n\r\nAs to the monkeys, skipping from tree to tree along the Meta, and\r\nexciting the admiration of the traveler by their antics and grimaces,\r\nhe avers that their number is an embarrassment to the arrows directed\r\nagainst them. Yet, although we were daily on the lookout for these\r\ninteresting animals, as well as for others popularly supposed to exist\r\nin countless numbers along the rivers and in the forests of Venezuela\r\nand Colombia, we never got a glimpse of even a single specimen of\r\nany of the quadrumanous tribes. [125]\r\n\r\nPadre Rivero was probably the first to give an account of that curious\r\ncustom--the Couvade--which prevailed among the Indian tribes with\r\nwhom he was acquainted. As is known, this extraordinary custom has,\r\nat one time or another, obtained in all quarters of the globe--in\r\nAsia, Africa, in Europe as well as in North and South America. Marco\r\nPolo found evidence of it during his travels in the Orient. It is,\r\nhowever, in South America that it is most prevalent and where the\r\nprescriptions connected with it are most scrupulously observed. And\r\nit was the early missionaries who have furnished us with the most\r\ninteresting data regarding this widespread custom, and which, according\r\nto recent travelers, is still as prevalent in certain parts of South\r\nAmerica as it was generations ago.\r\n\r\n\"It is a ridiculous thing,\" says Rivero, \"of which I am about to\r\nspeak, but it is nevertheless a reality. It is this. When a woman\r\ngives birth to a child, it is the husband that is to receive the\r\ncare and attention given on such occasions and not the miserable\r\nwoman. Scarcely is the child born, when the husband, with the behavior\r\nof one who has escaped from a grave mischance, goes to bed complaining\r\nas if he were ill. The wife then bestows on him the most tender care,\r\nas if on this the welfare of the home depended. As a reason for these\r\nsuperstitious practices and ridiculous ceremonies, they assert that,\r\nif during this time they should go walking, they would trample on\r\nthe head of the infant; if they should chop wood, they would cleave\r\nthe child's head; if they should shoot birds in the mountain, they\r\nwould infallibly shoot the newly born. And so is it with other foolish\r\nthings of a similar character which they firmly believe.\" [126]\r\n\r\nThe time during which the father must keep to his bed, or hammock,\r\nvaries from a few days to several weeks. In some tribes it is longer\r\nthan in others. During this season and even for months afterwards\r\nsome articles of food are quite tabooed. He must then abstain from\r\ncertain kinds of birds or fish, \"firmly believing that this would\r\ninjure the child's stomach, and that it would participate in the\r\nnatural faults of the animals on which the father had fed. If, for\r\nexample, the father ate turtle, the child would be deaf and have\r\nno brains, like this animal; if he ate manatee, the child would\r\nhave little round eyes like this creature.\" Again, if he eats the\r\nflesh of a waterhaas--Capybara--a large rodent with very protruding\r\nteeth--the teeth of the child will grow like those of this animal;\r\nor if he eats the flesh of the spotted labba, the child's skin will\r\nbecome spotted. Among some tribes the father is forbidden to bathe,\r\nto smoke, or to use snuff, or even to scratch himself with his finger\r\nnails. In their place he must employ \"for this purpose a splinter,\r\nspecially provided, from the mid-rib of a cokerite palm.\"\r\n\r\nDobrizhoffer, a noted missionary in Paraguay, in his very interesting\r\nHistory of the Abipones, is even more explicit about this superstitious\r\npractice. \"No sooner,\" he says, \"do you hear that the wife has borne\r\na child, than you will see the Abipone husband lying in bed, huddled\r\nup with mats and skins, lest some rude breath of air should touch\r\nhim, fasting, kept in private, and for a number of days abstaining\r\nreligiously from certain viands. You would swear it was he who had had\r\nthe child.... They are fully persuaded that the sobriety and quiet of\r\nthe father is effectual for the well-being of the new-born offspring\r\nand even necessary.... And they believe, too, that the father's\r\ncarelessness influences the new-born offspring, from a natural bond and\r\nsympathy between both. Hence if the child comes to a premature end,\r\nits death is attributed by the women to the father's intemperance,\r\nthis or that cause being assigned. Among these would be that he did\r\nnot abstain from meat, that he had loaded his stomach with waterhog,\r\nthat he had swum across the river when the air was chilly, that he\r\nhad neglected to shave off his long eye-brows, that he had devoured\r\nunderground honey, stamping on the bees with his feet, that he had\r\nridden till he was tired and sweated. With ravings like this the crowd\r\nof women accuse the father with impunity of causing the child's death\r\nand are accustomed to pour curses on the unoffending husband.\" [127]\r\n\r\nThe whole subject of the couvade opens up many interesting questions\r\nfor the ethnologist, and its careful study may be productive of much\r\nvaluable information regarding the early races of mankind. For the\r\nstudent of linguistics and folklore, there is still among the little\r\nknown tribes of Eastern Colombia a broad and rich field for research\r\nconcerning the languages, customs and traditions of these people,\r\nand the works of the early missionaries are replete with the most\r\nprecious data respecting them. [128]\r\n\r\nAs we quietly sailed up the broad forest-clad Meta, we could not help\r\nharking back to the distant past, when, ever and anon, along its banks\r\nwere to be seen the smiling homes and villages of happy Indians under\r\nthe watchful eye and protecting arm of their \"father priest,\" and\r\ncomparing it with the present desolate and deserted land that for days\r\nat a time does not exhibit the slightest trace of a human habitation.\r\n\r\nThen, in the beautiful language of Colombia's great lyric poet,\r\nD. José Joaquin Ortíz, \"One clime and one region was not sufficient\r\nfor the ardor that inflamed the breasts of the holy disciples of\r\nChrist. They will go to enkindle the pure flame of love in the breast\r\nof the savage, at the same time teaching him the arts of peace in\r\nthe immense solitudes which are fertilized by the Arauca, and the\r\nMeta and the Casanare and the torrential Upia. They will scale the\r\never-precipitous throne of the deafening storm, and will finally hear\r\nthe canticle sounding in praise of the redeeming cross, in as many\r\ntongues and by as many tribes as people my native land from the West\r\nto the East.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, too, was to be seen one of those charming gatherings so\r\nbeautifully pictured by our own Longfellow in \"The Children of the\r\nLord's Supper\"--\"Thus all the children of the Mission hasten, at the\r\nsound of the bell, to gather about the cross, which is raised on high,\r\nand to approach near the venerable man who with his silver locks towers\r\nabove so many infantile heads. Oh, neither Plato nor Socrates, famous\r\nin the annals of knowledge, after long years of continuous vigils,\r\never knew what these poor, ingenuous children learnt from the tremulous\r\nlips of the old man at the foot of a tree-trunk in the forest.\" [129]\r\n\r\nMuch, however, as we were disposed to linger on the glories of the\r\npast, and to regret the absence of what, in days gone by, possessed\r\nsuch an intense human interest, we were not insensible to the marvelous\r\nnatural beauties of river and forest that defiled before our admiring\r\ngaze from morning until night.\r\n\r\nAt one time it is a colossal Bombax ceiba [130] that claims our\r\nattention. This tree is remarkable alike for the height it often\r\nattains and for the wonderful expanse of its branches. To support\r\nsuch a giant of the forest, Nature has made a special provision. It\r\nis supplied by large buttresses, from six to twelve inches thick and\r\nfrom ten to twenty feet above the ground, which project like rays\r\nfrom all sides of its lofty trunk. Were it not for these peculiar\r\nstays the tree would be uprooted by the first violent wind to which\r\nit might be exposed.\r\n\r\nAt another time it is a huge fig tree that we admire, or a tall\r\nand graceful Candelero, so named from its resemblance to an ornate\r\ncandlestick. In both cases we observe the same peculiar, buttressed\r\nroots that are so characteristic of the ceiba and some other giants\r\nof the forest.\r\n\r\nBut more wonderful far than the ceiba is a tree called by the natives\r\nby the expressive name of Matapalo--Tree-Killer. It is a species\r\nof fig tree, known to naturalists as the Ficus dendroica. It is at\r\nfirst but a feeble, climbing shrub, sometimes resembling a vine, but\r\nit soon spreads itself over the tree on which it has fastened itself\r\nand eventually encloses it in a tubular mass. It is a veritable boa\r\nconstrictor of the vegetable world, for it sooner or later crushes\r\nthe life out of its victim.\r\n\r\n\"After the incarcerated trunk has been stifled and destroyed,\r\nthe grotesque form of the parasite, tubular, corkscrew-like, or\r\notherwise fantastically contorted, and frequently admitting the\r\nlight through interstices like loopholes in a turret, continues to\r\nmaintain an independent existence among the straight-stemmed trees\r\nof the forest--the image of an eccentric genius in the midst of a\r\ngroup of sedate citizens.\" [131]\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable tree seen in the tropics is the cow tree, the\r\npalo de vaca, or arbol de leche--the milk tree of the natives. Its\r\nsap resembles milk in taste and appearance, and is extensively used\r\nas an aliment, especially by the negroes and mestizos. In referring\r\nto this strange specimen of plant life, Humboldt remarks: \"Amidst\r\nthe great number of curious phenomena which I have observed in the\r\ncourse of my travels, I confess there are few that have made so\r\npowerful an impression on me as the aspect of the cow tree.... It is\r\nnot here the solemn shades of forests, the majestic course of rivers,\r\nthe mountain wrapped in eternal snow, that excite our emotion. A few\r\ndrops of vegetable juice recall to our minds all the powerfulness and\r\nthe fecundity of nature. On the barren flank of a rock grows a tree\r\nwith coriaceous and dry leaves. Its large woody roots can scarcely\r\npenetrate into the stone. For several months of the year not a single\r\nshower moistens its foliage. Its branches appear dead and dried; but\r\nwhen the trunk is pierced there flows from it a sweet and nourishing\r\nmilk. It is at the rising of the sun that this vegetable fountain is\r\nmost abundant. The negroes and natives are then seen hastening from\r\nall quarters, furnished with large bowls to receive the milk, which\r\ngrows yellow and thickens at the surface. Some empty the bowls under\r\nthe tree itself, others carry the juice home to their children.\" [132]\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the Orinoco we made no attempt to travel at night. The\r\never-changing bed of the river, the sand banks, the large trunks\r\nof trees that were hurried along by the current, eddies and rapids\r\nand rocks and islands unnumerable, made sailing at night quite\r\nimpossible. For this reason, at nightfall we sometimes moored at the\r\nriver's bank, attaching our boat by a rope to the nearest tree, but,\r\nmore frequently, in order to escape mosquitoes and other insects,\r\nwe dropped anchor in mid-river.\r\n\r\nThe night was always tranquil, and we were never disturbed by any of\r\nthose noises--the howling of monkeys and the cries of jaguars--which,\r\nin tropical forests, are usually supposed to be so pronounced a\r\nfeature. Nor were we ever troubled by mosquitoes during our entire trip\r\nof two weeks from Ciudad Bolivar. And never did we deem it necessary to\r\ntake the precaution of putting up our mosquiteros--mosquito nets--to\r\nprotect ourselves from the plaga--plague--which we had been assured\r\nwould be a nightly visitant during our entire journey.\r\n\r\nWe had been told, too, that the intense heat of the atmosphere would\r\nbe another cause of continual suffering--day and night. But we did not\r\nfind it so. At no time did the thermometer rise higher than 86° F.,\r\nand it frequently sank as low as 66° F., when we were glad to put on\r\nwraps of some kind. We observed that a variation of a few degrees was\r\nmore appreciable than the same variation in our northern latitudes. A\r\ndrop of two or three degrees below 70° F. produced a greater sensation\r\nof cold than a fall to 50° would produce in New York.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, one need not remain long in the tropics before\r\nhe becomes affected by very slight changes of temperature. And another\r\nfact is soon impressed on the observer, which is that the heat in the\r\ntropics is not so much greater than that in more northern latitudes,\r\nas measured by the thermometer. It is the almost uniform temperature,\r\nday and night, the whole year through, that eventually becomes so\r\ndepressing and so difficult to endure.\r\n\r\nAt no time, either on the Orinoco or the Meta, did we ever\r\nsee the thermometer rise within fifteen degrees of the intense\r\nheat one frequently experiences during the summer in New York and\r\nWashington. The nights, although usually warm, were never unpleasant. A\r\nsheet was generally sufficient covering, but we sometimes found it\r\nnecessary to use a blanket. Only once were we annoyed--and that for\r\nbut a short time--by insects, and that was because we moored near\r\nthe bank under large, overhanging trees, which seemed to be alive\r\nwith certain bugs of a very noxious odor.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice during each day it was necessary to stop to take on\r\nwood, which was usually ready and piled up on the bank. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, the owner would demand more than the captain was willing\r\nto give, and that meant that the crew was then obliged to go into\r\nthe forest and cut fuel sufficient to take us to the next wood-pile\r\nfurther up the river. Fortunately, we were not often obliged to cut\r\nthe wood ourselves. Each time we did so meant an extra delay of three\r\nor four hours.\r\n\r\nBesides stopping for wood, it was at times necessary to call\r\nfor provisions, fruits, chickens, eggs, and a certain queso á\r\nmano--hand-made cheese--of which the Llaneros are very fond and which\r\nwe found very palatable.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion our supply of beef became exhausted, and it was\r\nnecessary to stop--about noon--at a hato along the river to get a\r\nheifer for our next meal. Unfortunately, the owner of the ranch was\r\nnot at home. He was out among his herds several miles distant. Our\r\nsteward, nothing disconcerted, started in search of him, but before\r\nhe had found the proprietor of the herd, and had gotten the desired\r\nnovilla--heifer--on board, it was dark. There was then nothing to do\r\nbut tie our boat up near the house in which we had spent most of the\r\nafternoon, and wait until the following morning before continuing\r\nour journey.\r\n\r\nAt first, it would appear that such delays would prove very annoying,\r\nbut this was very far from being the case. On the contrary, it was\r\nmost interesting, as it gave us an opportunity of getting acquainted\r\nwith the people, and of familiarizing ourselves with their mode of life\r\nand occupations, and enjoying many interesting conversations with them\r\nabout matters in which they were most concerned. We always found them\r\nvery hospitable and very entertaining. They always gave us a cordial\r\nwelcome to their humble home, and rarely allowed us to depart without\r\ngiving us something from their simple store. Sometimes it was a brace\r\nof chickens, at other times a basket of fruit, a calabash of eggs,\r\nor generous piece of queso á mano--which was made by the mistress of\r\nthe house herself.\r\n\r\nHere we were among people who lived the simple life, and appeared all\r\nthe happier for it. We saw no evidences of suffering anywhere. The\r\nonly thing that seemed to concern them was the instability of the\r\ngovernment. True, Colombia had been in the enjoyment of peace for\r\nseveral years past, but every now and then some gossip-monger would\r\ncirculate reports about another uprising in some part of the country,\r\nand about the imminent danger to which the men were exposed of being\r\ndrafted into the army, and of being torn away from their families,\r\nto whom they are devotedly attached.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, while the crew was cutting wood, we were able to make\r\na collection of orchids, of which there are along the Meta many\r\nwonderfully beautiful species. At one time our deck was a veritable\r\nbower of all kinds of orchids of the most brilliant colors and of the\r\nstrangest imaginable forms. Some of them possessed a most delicate\r\nfragrance, while others emitted a delightful perfume that spread over\r\nthe greater part of our deck.\r\n\r\nLinnæus knew only about a dozen exotic orchids, and expressed it as\r\nhis opinion that when the world was fully explored by botanists,\r\nit might probably yield a hundred species all told. How surprised\r\nhe would be if he could now return to the world and find that the\r\nspecies of this curious plant are actually counted by thousands! To\r\nEnglish horticulturists alone some thousands of species are known. Even\r\nsome of the many genera of this extensive order contain hundreds of\r\nspecies. Of odontoglossums there are more than a hundred species\r\ncatalogued. Of oncidiums more than two hundred and fifty species\r\nhave been described. Of dendrobiums between three and four hundred\r\nspecies are known, while the genus Habenaria counts more than four\r\nhundred species. Then there are the countless hybrids--and their\r\nnumber is rapidly increasing--that, during the last few years, have\r\nbeen produced in the conservatories of Europe and America.\r\n\r\nOrchids are found in all parts of the world; in the marshes and groves\r\nof the lowlands and in the lofty plateaus of mountain ranges. But it\r\nis in the warm and humid regions of the equator that they occur in\r\nthe greatest variety and profusion. Twenty years ago the number of\r\nspecies known in Venezuela alone exceeded six hundred. In Colombia the\r\nnumber is probably greater. It is here, too, that some of the choicest\r\nspecimens have their habitat. From this country tens of thousands\r\nof plants are shipped annually to the florists of Europe and the\r\nUnited States. As an illustration of the extent of this industry it\r\nsuffices to state that a single firm has under cultivation no fewer\r\nthan one hundred thousand Odontoglossums, for of this species alone\r\nhundreds of thousands of plants are marketed annually. Other species\r\nare scarcely less popular. To supply the ever-increasing demand for\r\nthem, there is now a small army of men continually engaged in the\r\ntropical forests in the work of collecting and preparing them for\r\nshipment. We met several of them in both Venezuela and Colombia.\r\n\r\nIn the forests along the Meta we could within a small area easily\r\nhave collected more orchids than were known to Linnæus. They were\r\neverywhere--in the forks of trees, on their branches, on decaying\r\ntrunks, on the lianas stretching from one tree to another, and, forming\r\nwith the flowering epiphytes [133] with which they were laden, the most\r\nbeautiful tapestry, beside which the most exquisite Gobelin masterpiece\r\nwould pale into insignificance. In other places they grew on bare,\r\nprecipitous rocks, where they were quite inaccessible, on prickly\r\ncactus plants, near beautiful cascades, or clumps of arborescent\r\nferns. We found them flourishing near the ocean shore and near the\r\nlimits of perpetual snow on the crests of the Cordilleras.\r\n\r\nEverywhere they were attractive and worthy of study--some on account\r\nof their bizarre forms, mimicking insects and butterflies, others on\r\naccount of their delicate fragrance, and others still on account of\r\ntheir gorgeous colors, which fairly rival those of the rainbow.\r\n\r\nThe odors of orchids are almost as diverse as their colors and\r\nforms. While most of them have an agreeable scent, there are some\r\nthat have an unbearably fetid odor. Some emit a faint and delicate\r\nperfume; others possess a fragrance which, although delicious, is\r\nalmost overpowering. In some the fragrance is perceptible only in the\r\nmorning, in others solely in the evening. Some have a scent like that\r\nof violets, others like that of musk or noyeau, and others again like\r\nthat of angelica or cinnamon. More wonderful still, \"some species,\"\r\nwe are told, \"give out different scents at different times, such as\r\nDendrobium nobile, which smells like grass in the evening, like honey\r\nat noon, and has in the morning a faint odor of primroses.\" [134]\r\n\r\nIt was a fortnight, almost to the hour, since we had left Ciudad\r\nBolivar, when, one bright day, as the sun was approaching the zenith,\r\nour captain, pointing to a tongue of land in the river ahead of us,\r\nsaid, in a cheerful tone of voice, \"A la vueltá esta Orocué.\" Orocué\r\nis beyond that point.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was. In a few minutes more we had the town in full\r\nview. We had finished another stage of our journey and that, too,\r\nwithout an untoward incident of any kind whatsoever. The entire\r\nvoyage had been made with comfort and pleasure, and we actually\r\nregretted to leave the boat on which we had spent so many delightful\r\nand happy hours. It was indeed an experience of a lifetime, one of\r\nenchanting panoramas, such as can be witnessed only along the great\r\nwater courses of the equator. The flora, the fauna, the people, the\r\nlands, so rich in romance and so celebrated for the achievements\r\nof the conquistadores--those of the cross as well as those of the\r\nworld--all fascinated us and enchained our interest during every moment\r\nof our wakeful hours. Yes, it was a memorable, never-to-be-forgotten\r\nexperience, one of those experiences that necessarily exalt the lover\r\nof Nature and bring him near to Nature's God.\r\n\r\nAll the inhabitants in Orocué--men, women and children--were gathered\r\non the bank to witness the arrival of our little steamer. So rarely\r\ndoes anything larger than a small sailboat come here that the\r\narrival of a steamboat is regarded as an event of paramount interest\r\nand importance. Most grateful to us, for it was so unexpected,\r\nwas the welcome accorded us by a number of the leading citizens\r\nof the town. They had been advised by telegraph of our coming,\r\nand had prepared most comfortable quarters for our reception and\r\nentertainment. Escorting us to our temporary home--which was not\r\nonly well furnished but a model of neatness--we were told, with true\r\nCastilian politeness, accompanied by an air of simplicity and sincerity\r\nthat made us feel at home from the first moment, \"Aquí están Uds. en\r\nsu casa. Estamos todos á sus órdenes.\" \"Here you are in your own home\r\nand we are all at your disposition.\" The keys of the house were then\r\nhanded us, and with them we were accorded the freedom and hospitality\r\nof generous, never-to-be forgotten Orocué.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nAPPROACHING THE ANDES\r\n\r\n\r\n                            \"Aqui la selva secular, ornada\r\n                            De festones de variada enredadera\r\n                            De bellos y vivísimos colores,\r\n                            Y la extensa pradera\r\n                            De fraganciosas flores alfombrada,\r\n                            Forman el templo augusto que levanta\r\n                            La creacion a Dios, á quien ofrece\r\n                            Deliciosos perfumes por incienso,\r\n                            Y por ofrenda el fruto delicado\r\n                            Que el estival calor ha sazonado.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Here the forest secular, decked with festoons of divers climbers,\r\nof beautiful and brilliant colors, and the broad meads carpeted with\r\nfragrant flowers, form an august temple, which creation raises to God,\r\nto whom it offers delicious perfumes for incense, and, as an oblation,\r\nbrings the delicate fruit matured by the summer's sun.\"\r\n\r\nIn these words of the Bolivian poet, D. Manuel José Cortés, might\r\naptly be described the extensive forests and plains of which Orocué\r\nis the centre. Everywhere is that same exuberance of vegetation and\r\nprofusion of vari-colored bloom that are so characteristic of the\r\nbasin of the Meta. While lost in silent admiration of the countless\r\nfloral beauties that on every side met our delightful gaze, we could\r\nbut compare the scene to a ruined Eden,\r\n\r\n\r\n                  \"Where the first sinful pair\r\n        For consolation might have weeping trod,\r\n        When banished from the garden of their God.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the garden adjoining our house were citrus trees laden with\r\ngolden fruit, bananas of many varieties and a large mango tree, whose\r\nbranches were bending under the weight of its richly tinted, luscious\r\ndrupes. Near by was a noble old ceiba, while but a short distance away\r\nwas a tall Jacaranda--of the trumpet-flower family--literally enveloped\r\nin a reddish-violet mantle of papilionaceous flowers, and filling the\r\nair round about with perfume not unlike that of the orange blossom or\r\nthe jasmine. Everywhere we went some new floral display was awaiting\r\nus. All along our path we found an unending variety of laurels and\r\nmyrtles; trees and shrubs and herbs of the Rubiaciæ family. There\r\nwere splendid representatives of the genera Cassia and Mimosa, and\r\nclumps of the ever-present moriche, together with other species of\r\npalm equally attractive and majestic. Frequently these were joined\r\nby delicate festoons of liana, many of which were weighted down with\r\norchids and epiphytes of the rarest beauty and fragrance.\r\n\r\nOrocué is the capital of the district of that name in the National\r\nTerritory of the Meta, and the seat of a prefecture. It is located on\r\nthe left bank of the Meta, on an eminence about thirty feet above the\r\nsurface of the river, and sufficiently high to guarantee it against\r\ninundations during the rainy season. Being less than five degrees from\r\nthe equator, the climate is warm but, during our stay, it was never\r\nuncomfortable, and at no time did the thermometer ever rise above\r\n82° F. The population is about six hundred. The place is healthful,\r\nand malignant fevers are rare. The streets are wide, and some of the\r\nhouses are well-built and comfortable. Most of them are constructed of\r\nbamboo plastered over with clay. The roof is thatched with the broad\r\nleaves of the moriche palm or preferably with those of the palma de\r\ncobija, also known as the palma de sombrero--hat palm. This is what\r\nscientists call Copernicia [135] tectorum, and is preferred to any\r\nother leaf because it is not readily inflammable. Such a roof lasts\r\nten or twelve years, and is impervious to water. During our sojourn in\r\nOrocué it rained regularly for several hours every day and, although\r\nthe downpour at times was very heavy, never once did we observe a\r\nsingle drop of water to pass through the roof. Everything in our\r\nrooms remained as dry as if the roofs had been made of tile or slate.\r\n\r\nMany of these bamboo-palm houses are constructed without the use of\r\na single nail. Studs and cross beams, laths and rafters, are tied\r\ntogether and held firmly in place by bejucos, those wonderful natural\r\ncords and cables which are found in such profusion in every tropical\r\nforest, and which, in the hands of the natives, serves such an endless\r\nvariety of purposes.\r\n\r\nSome years ago the town possessed what the inhabitants considered a\r\nlarge and beautiful church. It was constructed of the same materials as\r\nthe other buildings of the town and occupied a conspicuous position on\r\nthe plaza. In consequence of recent revolutions and other disturbances,\r\nit had been greatly neglected, and, at the time of our visit, was\r\nrapidly falling into ruins. The people had not had a pastor for some\r\nyears, but were hoping to have one soon. They, however, received every\r\nfew months the ministrations of a priest from a neighboring mission,\r\nand longed for the time when they could have a resident pastor and\r\nsee their church restored to its pristine condition.\r\n\r\nThere was a small school for boys, attended by about twenty young\r\nmestizos, but none for girls. There was a movement on foot to secure\r\nthe services of some nuns to teach the girls, and the mothers of\r\nthe children awaited their arrival with the greatest impatience. The\r\nmonjas--nuns--have a wonderful influence over the children, and young\r\nand old are thoroughly devoted to them.\r\n\r\nOrocué has an aduana, or customhouse, and is the centre of a\r\nflourishing grazing district, in which there are numerous hatos and\r\nfundaciones, [136] containing from two to twenty thousand head of\r\ncattle. Cattle, hides and rubber, together with the coffee, which\r\nis brought from the foothills of the Andes, constitute the principal\r\narticles of export. [137]\r\n\r\nThe neighboring Indians manufacture large and beautiful hammocks from\r\nthe leaves of the Cumare and other palms and bring them here and\r\nexchange them for anything that may strike their fancy. Although I\r\nhad brought a German hammock with me, I procured one of these Indian\r\nchinchorros, and found it during the remainder of my journey in South\r\nAmerica the best investment I could have made. Nothing contributed\r\nmore to my comfort when I desired a siesta, and when I wished to\r\nescape the filth and insect pests to which, in my wanderings, I was\r\nso frequently exposed.\r\n\r\nOf the many objects brought to Orocué for barter by the Indians few\r\nhad greater interest for us than the weapons employed by them in the\r\nchase and in war. Among these the chief ones were their poisoned\r\narrows and blowguns. A friend made us a present of some of them,\r\nbut owing to the inconvenience of transporting them, we were unable,\r\nmuch to our regret, to take them with us.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the mystery connected with the virulent poison,\r\nknown as curare, urari woorali, etc., with which the Indians poison\r\ntheir arrows, remained unsolved, notwithstanding the efforts of\r\nmen of science to determine its source and composition. Early\r\ntravelers gave the most fantastic accounts of its composition and\r\nmanufacture. According to them it was a concoction more uncanny than\r\nthat prepared from\r\n\r\n\r\n           \"Eye of newt and toe of frog,\r\n            Wool of bat and tongue of dog.\r\n            Adder's fork and blind worm's sting,\r\n            Lizard's leg and owlet's wing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed, so carefully did the Indians engaged in its manufacture\r\nguard the secret of its preparation that it was not until a few\r\ndecades ago that the true character of this deadly compound was first\r\nunderstood. Boussingault suspected but did not prove the existence of\r\nstrychnine in curare. [138] Humboldt was probably the first to suspect\r\nits true nature. [139] It is now known that neither snake's teeth nor\r\nstinging ants form its active principle, as was formerly supposed,\r\nbut that its venomous properties are due to the presence of curarine,\r\na bitter crystalline alkaloid obtained from the plant Strychnos\r\ntoxifera, or other plants of this genus, found throughout equatorial\r\nAmerica. Its virulence is manifested only when it is administered\r\nthrough the skin. It then paralyzes the motor nerves, and, if the\r\npoison be sufficiently strong, it produces death by suffocation.\r\n\r\nThe Indians in Orocué, as everywhere else along the Meta and Orinoco,\r\nwere a subject of never-ending study for us. Most of the inhabitants\r\nof Orocué are Indians or mestizos, and it would be difficult to find\r\nanywhere a gentler or more peaceful people. The town was founded by the\r\nSalivas Indians, whose nasal language the early missionaries found so\r\ndifficult to master, but whose gentle nature and amiable disposition\r\nwere ever the subject of the highest eulogies. Remnants of this tribe\r\nare still found in this territory, as are also representatives of\r\nthe Piapocas, Tunebos, Yaruros, Cuivas, and the once powerful yet\r\nfriendly Achaguas.\r\n\r\nThe tribe, however, that counts the greatest numbers, is the\r\nGuahibos, whom certain imaginative travelers would have us believe\r\nare as fierce as pumas or jaguars. The truth is, however, that,\r\nalthough some of them are more or less nomadic in their habits, and\r\ndecline to live with the racionales--whites--they are, as a rule,\r\npeaceful and industrious. Sr. Jorge Brisson, an engineer for the\r\nColombian government, who a few years ago thoroughly explored this\r\ncountry--the Casanare--speaks of them as being muy agricultores y\r\nmuy trabajadores--hard-working tillers of the soil.\r\n\r\nThat they are peaceful and harmless is evidenced by the fact that the\r\nowners of the scattered conucos along the Meta are rarely, if ever,\r\ndisturbed by these much maligned Indians. In many of the isolated\r\nhabitations, which we visited on our way up the river, we found only\r\nwomen and children. The men were occupied elsewhere, and were sometimes\r\nabsent for weeks at a time. This, certainly, would not be the case\r\nif the Guahibos were the cruel, relentless savages they are so often\r\nrepresented to be. Not once in our journeyings up the Meta and its\r\naffluents did we hear of any atrocities committed by these Indians,\r\nor even of any complaints against them, although we took particular\r\npains to inform ourselves about the matter. All the reports about\r\ntheir robberies and murders were confined to those we had heard a\r\nthousand miles down the river and from people who probably never saw\r\na Guahibo in their lives, and who would not recognize one if they\r\nwere to see one.\r\n\r\nIt is true that now and then a cow or a calf may disappear from some\r\nof the Conucos and fundaciones and that their disappearance is always\r\ncredited to the Indians. Even if this suspicion were verified, an\r\noccasional theft of this kind--all the circumstances considered--should\r\nnot be so surprising. We do not need to go beyond the boundaries\r\nof our own country to find cases of cattle stealing. And the poor\r\nIndian, often cheated and wronged, may, without being a casuist,\r\neasily persuade himself that he is justified in seeking occult\r\ncompensation. This is often his only safe method of making reprisals\r\nfor damage done him in person and property, and he would be more than\r\nhuman, if he did not occasionally resort to it if he thought he could\r\ndo so with impunity.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is,\" says Brisson, \"the poor creatures have heretofore been\r\nvery badly treated by those who claim to be civilized, and flee in\r\nterror when they see a white man. The question now is not to civilize\r\nthem but to win their confidence. The problem would easily be solved\r\nif this delicate task were confided to the missionary priests. They\r\nwould bring it to a successful issue much sooner than could government\r\nofficialdom.\" [140]\r\n\r\nContrary to what is often imagined, the Indians who visit the\r\nsettlements along the Meta and the Orinoco are always decently if\r\nbut scantily clad. In their forest homes, however, their raiment\r\nusually consists of a simple lap-cloth. On occasions of feasting\r\nor public rejoicing they make an addition to their toilet. This\r\nconsists in painting their bodies with various dyes, but chiefly\r\nwith the yellowish-red annatto, which is obtained from the pulp of\r\nthe fruit of the arnotto tree, Bixa Orellana. They frequently cover\r\ntheir persons with the most fantastic designs. Indeed, it is only\r\nwhen thus decorated that the true children of the forest consider\r\nthemselves properly dressed. They would be ashamed to appear before\r\nstrangers otherwise. [141]\r\n\r\n\"Tigers and serpents,\" observes Mr. Brisson, \"are bug-bears of the\r\nsame family as Indios bravos\"--savages. It is certain that the\r\ntiger--jaguar--is fond of heifers and calves. But herdsmen will\r\ntell you, that in order to get rid of one, it is at times necessary\r\nto follow him for a fortnight before being able to find and kill\r\nhim. This is sufficient to prove that the tiger is never the first\r\nto attack a man in the llanos of Casanare, where it has food in\r\nabundance. \"Serpents are met with only casually.\" [142]\r\n\r\nI was glad to find one writer, who is so familiar with the country\r\nas is Sr. Brisson, to speak thus of the wild beasts most dreaded and\r\nof the still more dreaded Indios bravos, for it harmonized perfectly\r\nwith my own experience.\r\n\r\nWe were one day talking with our host in Orocué about the stories\r\ntold by travelers and writers regarding the jaguars of the South\r\nAmerican forests. He smiled, and said, \"I have lived in this country\r\nthirty-five years. I have several hatos in various parts of the\r\ncountry, which I visit frequently. In doing this I am obliged to\r\ntravel much through the forests and plains. I have often journeyed\r\nup and down the Orinoco, and the Meta from Trinidad to Bogotá, and,\r\nbelieve me, during all these years, I have never seen but one jaguar\r\nand that was in passing.\" How different his experience from that of\r\nthose who, after a short excursion into the interior of South America,\r\nwhere they rarely leave the beaten track used for centuries, have,\r\nnevertheless, such wonderful adventures to relate; such miraculous\r\nescapes from savage beasts and more savage Indians!\r\n\r\nOur host was a Venezuelan of Spanish descent, and a splendid type of\r\nthe old Spanish school. He had spent a part of his youth in Germany,\r\nand was a man of education and refinement. He was untiring in his\r\ndelicate attentions to us during our sojourn in Orocué, and made\r\nus quite forget that we were so far from home and what we so often\r\nfancy are the indispensable necessities of civilization. He had\r\nbeen eminently successful in business. Besides owning the largest\r\nbusiness house in Orocué--which is a distributing point for the great\r\nCasanare territory--he is the proprietor of several of the largest\r\nhatos in the country and counted his cattle by tens of thousands. In\r\naddition to all this, he has various other interests that yield him\r\na handsome income. He enjoys the reputation of being a millionaire,\r\nand the reputation is apparently justified.\r\n\r\nHow he could content himself to live in this isolated quarter of the\r\nworld--\"six months from everywhere,\" as one of his clerks expressed\r\nit--when he could enjoy all that money could command in the capitals\r\nof the Old or the New World, was a mystery to us, and yet he seemed to\r\nbe perfectly happy here, and to have no desire to live elsewhere. Was\r\nit the ever dominant feeling that \"There is no place like home,\"\r\nthat made him prefer Orocué to Paris or London? Quien sabe?\r\n\r\nThe only Europeans living here were three Germans. Two of them had\r\narrived but a few months before our visit, while the third had\r\nbeen here for nearly twenty years. This latter was also as much\r\nattached to Orocué as was our host. The year before he had visited\r\nhis family and friends in Hamburg and Berlin. \"But,\" he said, \"I had\r\nheimweh--got homesick--for Orocué, and came back much sooner than I\r\nintended. The noise and bustle and hurry and high-pressure of Europe\r\nwere quite unendurable, and I was more than delighted when I got back\r\nto dear old Orocué.\" He, too, had realized that there is no place\r\nlike home. And he, also, like our host, was educated and cultured;\r\nwas interested in science and literature and passionately fond of\r\nmusic. He had several musical instruments in his house--among others\r\na piano--on all of which he was a skillful performer.\r\n\r\n\"What wonderful men these Germans are!\" I said to myself, when I saw\r\nthese three men in the prime of life burying themselves away off\r\nhere in the wilderness, so far away from friends and country. But\r\nthis is not an unique instance of young Germans going to distant\r\nlands to engage in business and to contribute thereby towards that\r\nwonderful development of trade and influence for which the Vaterland\r\nis becoming so famous. In every part of Venezuela which we visited,\r\nwe found it the same. The greatest and most successful business houses\r\nare in the hands of Germans.\r\n\r\nIn all parts of South America you will find Germans, and find them,\r\ntoo, successful in their enterprises, and often getting more than\r\ntheir share of the trade of this vast continent. But they deserve\r\nsuccess, for they have earned it, and know how to make sacrifices\r\nwhen they are necessary to attain it, or to reach the goal for which\r\nthey are striving--to become the dominating commercial power of South\r\nAmerica. If the United States would display but a tithe of the energy\r\nand enterprise exhibited by Germany, it would not now occupy in the\r\nsouthern continent the humiliating position it does among the great\r\nmercantile nations of the world, and among our friends of the great\r\nLatin American republics. It is not too late to retrieve our loss,\r\nbut, to do so, we must change our policy and our methods of doing\r\nbusiness, and conduct them along the lines recommended by such alert\r\nand far-seeing statesmen as Blaine, Root and Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nAfter a delightful week spent in Orocué we were ready to start\r\nfor Barrigon or Puerto Nuevo on the Rio Humea, an affluent of the\r\nMeta. To go there by a bongo [143] during the rapidly rising water,\r\nwould require from fifteen to twenty days. It would be necessary\r\nto pole it--or pull it along by ropes in certain places--the entire\r\ndistance. Besides this, owing to its limited quarters, such a boat\r\nwould be extremely uncomfortable. Fortunately for us, and thanks\r\nto the kind offices of our host, we were able to have the use of a\r\nfine and commodious petroleum launch, which would convey us to our\r\ndestination in a week.\r\n\r\nIt was with genuine regret that we said Adios to the good people\r\nof Orocué and to the kind friends who had made our sojourn there so\r\npleasant and profitable. They were all at the landing to see us off,\r\nand speed the parting guests with the touching words, Vayan Uds. Con\r\nDios--May you go with God. To these fervent words of farewell came\r\nfrom our little crew the cordial response, Y con la Virgen, and with\r\nthe Virgin Mother.\r\n\r\nOur captain was a bright and courteous and most obliging young\r\nColombian from Bogotá. The pilot was a Venezuelan half-breed from the\r\ntown of Barcelona. This \"son of Barcelona,\" as he described himself,\r\nhad fled from his native country, on account of the continued\r\nrevolutions, to seek peace in Orocué. The cook was also a mestizo,\r\nwhile his assistant was a strong, broad-shouldered Guahibo, who,\r\nfar from being an unfeeling savage, was one of the kindest and most\r\nthoughtful persons one could meet. He was ever ready to serve us\r\nand was never more happy than when he observed that his delicate\r\nattentions were fully appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe launch's commissariat consisted of a liberal supply of\r\ntasajo--salt, dried beef--cassava bread, coffee, panela [144] and\r\nvarious kinds of fruit. Anticipating our needs at this part of our\r\njourney we had, before leaving the Port-of-Spain, laid in a supply of\r\nclaret and canned goods of various kinds. Aside from the butter and\r\ncondensed cream and some of the fruit preserves, the canned goods were\r\na disappointment. Although they were guaranteed to be fresh from the\r\nfactory, they were unfit for use. What we really enjoyed more than\r\nanything else, and always found fresh and wholesome, was our supply\r\nof coffee, sugar and crackers. For our café in the morning nothing\r\nmore was desired.\r\n\r\nCoffee was always served on the launch, when we were\r\nready to start on the day's journey, which was usually at\r\nsunrise. Desayuno--breakfast--we took at about ten o'clock. For this\r\nwe always landed, as it was more convenient and more agreeable to\r\ndo our cooking on shore than aboard. It was, indeed, quite romantic\r\nto have one's breakfast served under a broad-spreading ceiba, or in\r\nthe midst of a clump of stately palms, or in the shade of a group of\r\ngraceful bamboos. And not the least picturesque feature about it was\r\nAntonio--our ever-active and obliging Guahibo.\r\n\r\nWhenever possible, we stopped for desayuno and comida--dinner--at a hut\r\nor cottage on the river's bank. We ordinarily passed several of them in\r\nthe course of the day, for the banks of the upper Meta count many more\r\ninhabitants than does the lower part of the river. Usually there was\r\nonly a single cottage, but occasionally we passed a caserio consisting\r\nof five or six cottages. But whatever the number they were always of\r\nthe simplest construction possible. Sometimes the house was nothing\r\nmore than a palm-thatched shed, composed solely of a roof, with eaves\r\nextending almost to the ground, resting on short supports. Sometimes\r\nthe owners of these humble habitations were Indians, sometimes\r\nmestizos. But whether Indians or mestizos, we were cordially received\r\nand invited to make ourselves comfortable in the best hammock in their\r\npossession. With them the hamaca is the one indispensable article\r\nof furniture in every dwelling, even the poorest. It takes the place\r\nof our rocking-chair, sofa and bed. According to the Colombian poet,\r\nMadrid, the hammock was invented by the Indians--\r\n\r\n\r\n                            \"Gente\r\n            Dulce, benigna y mansa,\"\r\n\r\n\r\n--a race suave, gentle and benign--and even when all else fails them\r\nthey have their hammock to comfort them in misfortune, banishing\r\ntheir trouble in its oblivious embrace. The poet, like many others,\r\nevidently shares the Indian's fondness for the hammock, as the best\r\nverses he ever wrote was his poem La Hamaca. [145]\r\n\r\nThere were several reasons for stopping at one of these native huts\r\nwhen we could conveniently do so. We were thus enabled to get fresh\r\nfruit, eggs and chickens, and have them cooked as well. We had no\r\ncomplaint to make of our own cooks, but we soon discovered that the\r\nIndian and mestizo women were far better. I shall never forget our\r\nsurprise and pleasure at the manner in which a young Indian woman\r\nprepared for us roast chicken, and that, too, in a remarkably short\r\ntime. I never tasted a more tender or better flavored fowl in the\r\nbest restaurants of New York or Paris. And she had no stove or oven\r\nin which to roast it. Her sole utensil was a wooden spit over a\r\nfew coals surrounded by three stones about seven or eight inches in\r\ndiameter. And all was as clean as it was enjoyable.\r\n\r\nAll the furniture of the house is as primitive as the fireplace on\r\nwhich the meals are cooked. Often the only utensils of metal are a\r\npot, or kettle, and a machete, which takes the place of a knife in\r\ncutting. When the hammock is not used one sits on the ground or on a\r\nlog that serves as a bench. Occasionally we were offered the carapace\r\nof a large turtle in lieu of a chair. When the hammock is not used,\r\nan ox hide, or a rush mat, or a large palm leaf serves as a bed. Often\r\nthe poor people sleep on the bare ground.\r\n\r\nAside from the single metal kettle above mentioned, all other\r\nculinary utensils are made from the fruit of the calabash tree. It\r\nis the species known to botanists as Crescentia Cujete and is\r\ncalled by the natives totumo. The fruit is used at various stages\r\nof its growth according as it is employed for making small or large\r\nutensils. The younger and smaller fruits are fashioned into spoons,\r\nthose of medium size serve for drinking vessels, while the largest\r\nfull-grown fruits--often eight inches in diameter--are used for dishes\r\nand platters. [146] They also furnish a kind of musical instrument\r\nresembling the castanet. But marvelous to relate, they are also\r\nemployed for lanterns of a most original kind. After the shell is\r\npierced with a large number of small holes it is filled with those\r\nwonderful Cocuios--fireflies--that are found in such numbers in the\r\ntropics. Such a lantern seen at a distance is not unlike the familiar\r\nChinese lantern, and, considering the nature of the illuminant,\r\ngives a surprising amount of light.\r\n\r\nA house, such as the one just described, is the lodging place of\r\nthe dogs, and poultry, and not infrequently of the pigs also. The\r\npoultry roost upon the crosspieces immediately under the roof. The\r\nother animals occupy their own corner, and no one seems to be molested\r\nby their presence. Benzoni, in speaking of the habits of the Indians\r\nhe saw, remarks in his quaint fashion: \"They all sleep together like\r\nfowls, some on the ground and some suspended in the air.\" [147]\r\n\r\nEvery house is surrounded by a number of fruit trees. Among these the\r\nplatano and the banana are the most conspicuous, and are never wanting,\r\nfor they supply a large part of the food of the inhabitants of the\r\ntropics. Equally important are maize and yuca. [148] The latter is\r\nused for making bread. In certain parts of the tropics no other kind\r\nof bread is obtainable. To me it has a very insipid taste, somewhat\r\nlike that of bran or cellulose. Schomburgk considered that it had a\r\ndeleterious effect on the stomach, but there are few, I think, that\r\nshare his view. Certain it is, that its use as food is universal in\r\nthe tropics, and it is one of the three plants--yuca, maize and the\r\nplatano--that one is always sure to find in every conuco--even that of\r\nthe poorest Indian. These three articles are his staff of life. The\r\nnatives also eat fish and flesh of various kinds, it is true, but as\r\nthe three plant products named are quite sufficient to sustain life,\r\nand as they require little care after they are once planted, many\r\npeople make little or no effort to secure other kinds of food. They\r\nare content with little and seem to enjoy the living of the simple\r\nlife fully as much as some of our friends in the North enjoy talking\r\nand writing about it.\r\n\r\nOften, too, where one would least expect it, one will find beautiful\r\nflower gardens around the most unpretentious habitations. Of the\r\nflowers that we in the North are most familiar with--not to mention\r\ncountless peculiarly tropical species--those we most frequently\r\nobserved were roses, jasmines, dahlias, pinks, violets, dracenas,\r\ngladioli and gardenias. The large rose bushes, or rather rose\r\ntrees--they are so huge--one sometimes sees in the hot, dry climate\r\nof the tropics are truly remarkable. They sometimes attain a height of\r\ntwenty feet, and one may count on a single bush as many as a thousand\r\nbuds. From such a bush one may pluck a hundred beautiful roses every\r\nday in the year without any apparent diminution in the number on the\r\nparent stem.\r\n\r\nWhile journeying up the Orinoco and Meta, we several times tried our\r\nluck at fishing, but our efforts were always attended with the most\r\nignominious failures. Outside of a few minnows we caught absolutely\r\nnothing. One of our crew once caught a fish about two feet long\r\nresembling a pickerel and this was the only time that we ever tasted\r\nfresh fish all the time we were on the river.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the hook sunk into the water than the bait was\r\ntaken. There was a momentary nibble, and presto! the bait had\r\ndisappeared. On investigation we found that we had to deal with\r\nthe terrible Caribe--that voracious little fish about which so many\r\nextraordinary stories are related. In crossing rivers the natives\r\ndread the attacks of this serrasalmonine marauder more than they do the\r\ngymnotus, the stingray or the cayman. They have very sharp, trenchant\r\nteeth, usually swim in schools, and, when attracted by blood, will\r\nattack men and the larger animals without hesitation. And so fierce\r\nand rapid is their combined action that their attack usually means\r\ndeath to the victim.\r\n\r\nWe had often heard and read of their snapping fishhooks in twain but\r\nhad classed this statement among the stories of the monkey-bridge\r\nclass--stories that entertained us during our early school days, and\r\nwhich, I doubt not, still perform the same function for the rising\r\ngeneration in certain parts of the world.\r\n\r\nBut, while pondering our ill success with rod and line, we discovered\r\none evening, after vainly trying for an hour to get at least one\r\nspecimen of the finny tribe--and exhausting all our bait in the\r\nattempt--that our hook--a good-sized one, too--was snapped in two\r\nas neatly as if it had been cut by a pair of pliers. We examined the\r\npart of the hook that remained attached to the line and we found that\r\nit was actually cut, not broken on account of defective material.\r\n\r\nOn further inquiry, I found that several men of science who had\r\nvisited these parts, and had, presumably, investigated the matter, had\r\npositively stated that the Caribe was capable of severing fishhooks\r\nwith the greatest ease. Thus Mr. H. M. Myers does not hesitate to\r\naffirm that the Caribe is \"able to sever ordinary hooks as if they\r\nwere but slender threads,\" [149] and Dr. Carl Sachs declares that\r\n\"even thick steel fishhooks do not withstand their teeth.\" [150]\r\n\r\nBoth in the Orinoco and in the Meta we saw quite a number of\r\nporpoises--toninas, the Spaniards call them--quite as large and as\r\nplayful as any we ever saw in the ocean. The natives say they are the\r\nfriends of man, and defend him from caymans when he happens to be in\r\nthe river. [151] One thing is certain and that is that caymans and\r\ncrocodiles both quickly make their escape when the porpoise appears. It\r\nis probably, because the sluggish and indolent caymans, ferocious\r\nas they are by nature, have an instinctive dread of the noisy and\r\nimpetuous evolutions of these delphinine cetaceans, especially when\r\nthey move in schools.\r\n\r\nWe were often surprised by the large flocks of ducks, of many\r\ndifferent species, which we saw along the Meta. They seemed to be\r\nmost numerous near sunset when, occasionally, they flew across the\r\nriver by thousands. So great, indeed, was their number at times that\r\nwe could compare them only with the immense flocks of pigeons that,\r\nduring our boyhood days, used to darken the sky during their season\r\nof migration. Many of these ducks, as articles of food, compare\r\nfavorably with our mallard and canvasback. Truth to tell, the only\r\ntime we regretted not having a shotgun with us was when we saw these\r\nclouds of edible birds passing over our heads within easy reach. This\r\nwas particularly the case when our food supply was running short, or\r\nwhen we desired a change of diet, or something different from carne\r\nfrita--fried beef that has been salted and dried--and sancocho. [152]\r\n\r\nAmong the singing birds peculiar to the tropics are two that deserve\r\nspecial mention. There are the campanero or bellbird, and the flautero\r\nor flute bird.\r\n\r\nOf the bellbird, Waterson writes as follows: \"He is about the size of\r\na jay. His plumage is white as snow. On his forehead rises a spiral\r\ntube nearly three inches long. It is jet black, dotted all over\r\nwith small white feathers. It has a communication with the palate,\r\nand when filled with air, looks like a spire; when empty it becomes\r\npendulous. His note is loud and clear, like the sound of a bell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"With many of the feathered race, he pays the common tribute of a\r\nmorning and an evening song; and even when the meridian sun has shut\r\nin silence the mouths of the whole of animated nature, the campanero\r\nstill cheers the forest. You hear his toll, and then a pause for a\r\nminute, then another toll, and then a pause again, and then a toll,\r\nand again a pause. Then he is silent for six or eight minutes and\r\nthen another toll, and so on. Acteon would stop in mid-chase, Maria\r\nwould defer her evening song and Orpheus himself would drop his lute\r\nand listen to him; so sweet, so novel, and romantic is the toll of\r\nthe pretty snow-white campanero.\" [153]\r\n\r\nSo closely indeed does the note of the campanero resemble the\r\nsound of a bell that the traveler can easily fancy that there is a\r\nchapel in the depths of the forest, and that the faithful are being\r\ncalled to prayer. The bellbird has a near relative in the herrero,\r\nor blacksmith bird, whose note is like that produced when an anvil\r\nis struck by a hammer.\r\n\r\nThe flautero, or flute bird, is quite small and of a grayish color. Its\r\nnotes are surprisingly sweet and mellow, and closely resemble those\r\nof a sweet-toned flute, whence its name. One who hears this feathered\r\nsongster for the first time would easily believe that he is listening\r\nto a skillful flute player, and not to the song of a tiny bird. The\r\nrefrain of its song is fairly well expressed in the following notes:\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for us, we were often obliged to listen to sounds that\r\nwere not so agreeable as those of the flautero or campanero. These\r\nwere the raucous, discordant, never-ending noises produced by frogs\r\nand toads. In Orocué they always began their cacophonous serenade\r\nat nightfall, and kept it up uninterruptedly until the following\r\nmorning. I could then realize that Padre Rivero had good cause for\r\nregarding them as among the greatest nuisances with which he had\r\nto contend. Their confused, strident notes--base, tenor, contralto,\r\nsoprano--kept up the entire night were, he assures us, enough to split\r\none's head. Some of these amphibians we heard at Orocué were on the\r\nopposite side of the river from us, more than half a mile distant. They\r\nwere in very truth what Lowell has so well characterized as\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"Old croakers, deacons of the mire,\r\n        That led the deep batrachian choir.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wonderful depth and fertility of the dark, loamy soil in the valley\r\nof the Meta was ever a source of wonder to us. Along the river banks\r\nit usually formed a layer of four or five feet, and not infrequently\r\nseven or eight feet. And the vegetation was everywhere an evidence of\r\nthis fertility. At Platanales, a conuco at which we spent a night, we\r\nsaw a grove of several acres of the largest and most prolific bananas\r\nand plantains we had ever encountered anywhere. At another conuco,\r\nfarther up the river, where we stopped for breakfast, we saw several\r\nacres of corn that was rapidly maturing. And what corn! Never did\r\nI in Kansas or Nebraska see such ample stalks or so large ears and\r\ngrains. It was a revelation to us, and exhibited in a most striking\r\nmanner the wonderful, future possibilities of this marvelously fertile,\r\nyet unknown land.\r\n\r\nNear every dwelling, however humble, along the Meta, we observed\r\na large cross made of tastefully and often artistically plaited\r\npalm leaves. The material was yet quite fresh and the crosses had\r\nevidently been erected only a few days before we passed by. In design\r\nand workmanship they reminded us of those seen in parts of Italy on\r\nPalm Sunday. On inquiry, we found that they had been erected on the\r\nthird of May, the feast of the Invention of the Holy Cross.\r\n\r\n\"Why is this cross placed here?\" I asked of an Indian woman, while she\r\nwas preparing our desayuno. \"Para que no nos pegue el chubasco,\"--in\r\norder that the chubasco--wind squall--may not strike us, she replied\r\nwithout hesitation. I asked many others at divers places the same\r\nquestion and invariably received a similar reply.\r\n\r\nThese poor people were not able to erect the beautiful shrines one\r\nso frequently sees in the Catholic countries of Europe, and so their\r\nsimple faith found expression in these palm-leaf crosses, on which\r\nthey had evidently put their best and most careful work, of which\r\nthey often seemed justly proud.\r\n\r\nOn passing by a particularly large and beautiful cross of this kind my\r\nmind reverted to a shrine near the lighthouse of Savona, an ancient\r\ntown near Genoa. Here there is a statue of the Madonna, twelve feet\r\nhigh, under which are inscribed two Sapphic verses, expressing in\r\nrhythmic numbers the same idea that was uppermost in the mind of\r\nthe good Indian woman when she braided and placed in position this\r\nsymbol of redemption. The verses were composed by Gabriello Chiabrera,\r\n\"the prince of Italian lyric poets,\" who was a native of Savona. They\r\nare remarkable in that they are both \"good Latin and choice Italian,\"\r\nand have the same meaning in both languages. They read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"In mare irato, in subita procella,\r\n        Invoco te, nostra benigna stella.\" [154]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only place of any importance between Orocué and Barrigón is\r\nCabuyaro, a small town of about two hundred inhabitants. It cherishes\r\nthe hope of becoming the eastern terminus of the long-projected\r\nrailroad from Bogotá to the Meta. This would no doubt be a good\r\nterminal point, as the town is favorably located, and the river is\r\nsufficiently deep to permit the passage of good-sized vessels. As at\r\nthe other towns we passed, the steamer may moor within a few feet of\r\nthe river's bank.\r\n\r\nCabuyaro, however, is not the only place ambitious to become the\r\nterminus of the Bogotá Eastern railroad. It has several rivals,\r\nsome of which are little more at present than rude huts in the\r\nwilderness. Among these is Barrigón, which also rejoices in the\r\nhigh-sounding name of Puerto Nuevo. It has, certainly, an advantage\r\nover Cabuyaro in that it is much nearer the capital. When this\r\nrailway, which has been in contemplation for many years, shall have\r\nbeen completed, it will be possible to go from Bogotá to the Meta in\r\nten hours. At present it takes six days to make the trip, and a very\r\ntrying and tiresome one it is.\r\n\r\nWhile our cooks were preparing comida--dinner--we visited the town. As\r\nwe were passing a neat-looking house on the plaza, next to the church,\r\na woman standing at the door, surrounded by her family, observing\r\nthat we were strangers, insisted on our partaking of the hospitality\r\nof her home. She gave orders at once to have dinner prepared for us,\r\nand was deeply disappointed when she learned that our captain had made\r\narrangements for us to dine elsewhere. She then said: \"You must do us\r\nthe honor of taking at least a cup of coffee in our humble home. We\r\ncannot let you depart without something.\" Before she had finished\r\nspeaking, one of her daughters, a bright, modest girl of about sixteen,\r\nhad started to boil the water, and in a short time we were served\r\nwith as good coffee as we had ever tasted anywhere during our journey.\r\n\r\nThe kindness and simplicity of these good people were admirable. They\r\nwere much interested in our journey, and could not understand what\r\ncould induce us to undertake such a long trip. They were most eager\r\nto hear about our own country, and showed an intelligent interest\r\nin persons and things that quite surprised us. Soon a number of\r\ntheir neighbors called and each one was duly presented to the\r\nviajeros--travelers--and served also with a cup of the aromatic\r\nbeverage which our hostess knew so well how to prepare. Although we\r\nhad become accustomed to the generous hospitality of the good people\r\nwe had everywhere met along the Meta, the cordial reception given us\r\nby the people of Cabuyaro during our short stay among them impressed\r\nus in a special manner, and made us feel that it is particularly\r\namong primitive peoples, among those in the depth of the forest, or\r\nin the solitude of the desert, that hospitality is not only regarded\r\nas a duty but is also esteemed a pleasure.\r\n\r\nHow often, when partaking of the simple fare of our kindly hosts\r\nin tropical America, were we forced to compare their never-failing\r\nhospitality with that of the Greeks of Homeric times! Then nothing was\r\ntoo good for the honored guest, for he might be a god in disguise,\r\nor, if not a god, he was at least a friend of the gods. Like the\r\nearly Christians, who treated their guests as if they might be angels\r\nwho had come upon them unawares, our Meta hosts always gave us the\r\nbest at their disposition, and expressed their regret that they were\r\nunable to do more. Their home was ours as long as we chose to remain,\r\nand their every act showed that they were pleased to be honored--as\r\nthey expressed it--by the strangers' visit. [155]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Orocué, we had telegraphed to Villavicencio to have\r\nsaddle and pack mules ready for us on our arrival in Barrigón, which,\r\nas planned, was to be the morning after our arrival at Cabuyaro. As,\r\nhowever, we had been delayed a day by trouble with the engine,\r\nand loss of our anchor, we could not hope to reach our destination\r\nwithout traveling all night. Fortunately, there was a full moon and\r\na cloudless night. And our crew, the captain notably, were ready and\r\nwilling, regardless of their own comfort, to do anything in their\r\npower to enable us to reach Barrigón at the appointed time.\r\n\r\nNever shall I forget our last night on the Meta. C. and I were\r\nsitting on the prow of our launch, which was moving merrily along\r\nthe broad river--as broad as ever, apparently--which, under the\r\nbright rays of the moon, shone like molten silver. There was no\r\nmurky vapor to obscure the fair face of the queen of night, or dim\r\nher glowing form. Surrounded by the myriad stars of heaven, she\r\nreigned supreme. Then, more truly than ever before in our lives,\r\ncould we say with Saint Augustine, that we saw \"the moon and stars\r\nsolace the night.\" [156]\r\n\r\nThe air was balmy and impregnated with sweetest perfumes and rarest\r\nbalsamic odors, wafted from the dark, impervious forest walls that rose\r\nin silent majesty on either shore. The sleeping mimosas that had folded\r\ntheir leaves for the night, the ethereal jambos, figs, and laurels,\r\nthe dark crowns of the jaca and the manga, the slender shafts of bamboo\r\ntufts, the dim crests of the palm, trellised vines and liana festoons,\r\ndefiled before us in rapid succession, and, in the shades of night,\r\nassumed the most fantastic shapes and magic combinations.\r\n\r\nAs we glided along the glassy stretches of the river there was nothing\r\nto mar the perfect stillness that pervaded the scene, except the\r\nmuffled pulsations of our engine, too feeble to wake an echo from the\r\nneighboring banks. The time, the place, the freshness of earth and\r\nthe splendor of heaven lent themselves to reverie, and stirred the\r\nfancy to unwonted activity. Frequently on the Orinoco we had amused\r\nourselves by watching the odd and whimsical shapes assumed by the\r\nclouds, especially before or after a chubasco, or at the time the sun\r\nwas dropping below the horizon. Then the imagination, quickened to\r\naction, would discover, in the rapidly changing clouds, animal forms\r\nvarying from the bear and the eagle to the griffin and the dragon.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was now. At one time we could see, in a curiously arranged\r\nclump of trees and vines, the ruins of a Rhenish castle, at another\r\nthe shattered towers and merloned walls of an enchanted palace. Now\r\nit was a rustic chapel by the wayside, and a moment later, as we\r\npeered into the darkness of the inner wold, and noted the huge dark\r\ntree trunks, it was the massive pillars of a Hindoo shrine. Here it\r\nwas a Druid trysting-place, there a mermaid's grot and there again\r\na dryad's bower or the home of a fairy queen. That Titania was not\r\nfar distant was evidenced by the swarms of fairies--matter-of-fact\r\nscientific men would doubtless call them Pyropheri--fireflies--that,\r\nlike a thousand stars, flitted through the bloom and the foliage,\r\nilluming with their soft radiance the favorite haunt of fairyland.\r\n\r\nHow we enjoyed the mystery of these vast solitudes! How exquisite the\r\never-changing chiaroscuro; the wondrous play of light and shade; the\r\nwarmth, depth and softness of the noble pictures that, at every turn,\r\nravished our delighted gaze! How it all elevated the soul and enjoined\r\nrecollection of spirit! The impression was in an eminent degree like\r\nthat experienced beneath the sombre arches of a Gothic cathedral. And\r\nwhy not? Were we not beneath the starry vault of heaven, in the depth\r\nof the dark, majestic tropical forest, in the most inspiring temple\r\nof the Most High?\r\n\r\nWhen in Orocué, we were told that, on a bright, clear day, the\r\nAndes were visible from that place. But owing to the clouds and\r\nthe mists and the forests that had constantly obstructed our view,\r\nwe had not yet gotten even a glimpse of this world-famed chain of\r\nmountains. Of course, we had seen one of its spurs in the coast\r\nrange of Venezuela. But this range was not the Cordillera of our\r\nboyhood dreams. We longed to see that massive chain that extends in\r\nunbroken continuity from Panama to Patagonia. And day by day, as we\r\nmoved westward, our wistful eyes were ever peering through broken\r\nforest or over grass-covered glade, to catch the first view of La\r\nCordillera de los Andes.\r\n\r\nWhile silently sitting on the prow of our launch admiring the\r\ncountless, ever-changing beauties of that marvelous moonlight\r\nnight--our last on the Meta,--giving free rein to our fancy, and\r\nshifting our course as the meandering river demanded, behold! Suddenly\r\nlike a vision, the Andes stood before us in all their majesty and\r\nglory, looming up to the very heavens. So instant was the apparition\r\nthat, for a while, we were quite speechless from admiration and\r\nawe. \"The Andes!\" one of us ejaculated, and we were then completely\r\nunder their magic spell. So agreeable was our surprise and so great our\r\nemotion that for a time it was impossible to find words to express our\r\nfeelings of delight and wonder. We realized, as probably never before,\r\nwhat a feeble instrument language is for conveying one's innermost\r\nthoughts, and how inadequate to express what deeply stirs the soul.\r\n\r\nOur adjectives and exclamations were little more than the Indian's\r\ngrunt, and less devotional than the Moslem's phrase, \"Allah is\r\ngreat!\" Coming from the cold and tame nature of the North to that of\r\nthe glorious and marvelous equator, we were like Plato's men, bred in\r\ncavern twilight, and then suddenly exposed to the bright effulgence\r\nof the noonday sun. We saw things wonderful and unspeakable, but all\r\nour superlatives were inarticulate and feeble, matched with the scene\r\nbefore us.\r\n\r\n\"But what are those lights on the mountain summit, a little to the\r\nleft?\" inquired C., finally breaking the long-sustained silence. On\r\nthe very crest of the Cordilleras and extending for a considerable\r\ndistance, was a large number of brilliant lights, like so many electric\r\narcs. It was as if the long rows of arc lamps that illumine the Bay\r\nof Naples, as one sees them from an incoming steamer, were raised\r\nskyward far above the cone of Vesuvius; or as if the resplendent\r\n\"White Way\" of New York were lifted into cloudland.\r\n\r\nAt first we thought it was a forest fire, but it was so different\r\nfrom the unsteady, yellowish-red flame of burning trees and\r\nvegetation. We had seen such fires along the Orinoco and Meta--as\r\nwell as elsewhere--and were quite familiar with their appearance. It\r\ncould not be due to volcanic action, for there were no volcanoes in\r\nthat direction, unless of extremely recent origin. Besides, the lights\r\nbefore us were quite different from the fitful reflections that molten\r\nlava produces from swirling masses of vapor. Might they not actually be\r\nthe electric lights of Bogotá or of some other city of the Sierras? No,\r\nfor Bogotá was on the west slope of the mountain range, and there was\r\nno town of any size on the eastern declivity. Still less could the\r\nlights be due to reflection from the sun, for it had set hours before.\r\n\r\nWhat then was this \"midnight gloom still blossoming into fire\"? Our\r\ncuriosity was excited to a high degree, but the apparition seemed to\r\ndefy all attempts at explanation. We thought of the gleaming light\r\nseen by Robert Bruce from the turrets of Brodick Castle, in the isle\r\nof Arran, before his landing in Carrick.\r\n\r\nWe recalled a similar phenomenon, observed by Humboldt on the Cerro\r\ndel Cuchivano in Venezuela, in which he thought the luminous display\r\nobserved might be due to the burning of hydrogen and other inflammable\r\ngases. [157]\r\n\r\nThe Indians who live among or near the mountains, relate many wonderful\r\nstories about strange lights that are occasionally seen on or in the\r\nvicinity of the loftier peaks. \"It is a curious thing,\" writes Im\r\nThurn, regarding a phenomenon of this kind, seen in the mountains of\r\nBritish Guiana, \"that, as I have seen, there actually is an appearance,\r\nas of fire, to be seen sometimes up in these mountains, nor was I\r\never able to form any theory as to its cause.\" [158]\r\n\r\nSir Martin Conway records a more remarkable case of this\r\ncharacter. \"Long after the sun had set and darkness had come on,\r\nIllampu glowed red like fire, and all the people in town saw it. Such a\r\nsight none had ever beheld. In great terror they ran to the church and\r\nthe bells were rung. They thought the end of the world had come.\" [159]\r\n\r\nMy own conclusion regarding the luminous phenomena, that occupied our\r\nattention for at least an hour, during the night to which I refer, is\r\nthat they were of electric origin. The mountain in front of us seemed\r\nto be a vast condenser from which the electricity was escaping by a\r\nsilent glow or brush-discharge on an immense scale. The color and the\r\nsteadiness of the lights, as well as their durability, were evidence\r\nof this. They were probably of the same nature as the corposant of\r\nSt. Elmo's fire, sometimes seen on the spars or yards of a ship. [160]\r\n\r\nWe slept little that last night on the Meta. Earth and sky were so\r\nbeautiful, and there was so much to engage our attention that it was\r\na late hour before we sought repose.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning we left the Meta and entered the Humea, passing\r\nthe Rio Negro on our left. In Europe or America these two affluents\r\nof the Meta would be considered good-sized rivers. Both of them are\r\nnavigable for some distance, but like hundreds of other rivers in\r\nSouth America, are practically unknown, except to those who live in\r\ntheir immediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nAbout nine o'clock our pilot blew a loud, prolonged blast on his\r\nconch which served him for a horn or call-instrument, and, looking\r\nahead of us, we saw gathered on the banks the entire population\r\nof Barrigón--a negro woman, her three daughters and a young man,\r\nlikewise a negro. We expected, of course, to see also our mules and\r\nour arrieros--muleteers--but they were nowhere visible. They evidently\r\nhad not arrived. To describe our disappointment and dismay would be\r\nimpossible. We felt as if we were about to be marooned, or left in\r\na penal colony. What did it all mean?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE LLANOS OF COLOMBIA\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sooner had our launch reached the landing place, than we bounded\r\nashore, eager for information about our mules and their drivers. We\r\nasked the sable matron who, with her equally sable daughters, waited at\r\nthe brink to greet us, if the mules had come. She replied laconically,\r\n\"No, Señor.\" \"Have you heard anything about them?\" \"No, Señor.\" \"Is\r\nthere anyone here,\" and I glanced at the swarthy youth hard by,\r\n\"that would be willing, if well rewarded, to go forward and hasten\r\nthe arrival of men and mules?\" \"No, Señor.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done? We could not continue our journey alone and\r\nafoot, even if we were disposed to leave our baggage behind us. And\r\nit soon became evident that it would not be safe to remain long at\r\nBarrigón. There was but one rude hut there, and that was surrounded\r\nby mud and pools of water covered by \"Spawn, weeds and filth and\r\nleprous-scum\"--certainly not a very inviting place to abide any length\r\nof time.\r\n\r\nBesides, the family had nothing to eat, at least they said they had\r\nnot, except a few platanos, and these they required for their own\r\nuse. We had almost exhausted the supply we had brought from Trinidad,\r\nand the little that was still left, we intended for our three-days\r\ntrip to Villavicencio. We were not sure that we could get anything\r\non the way, and we did not wish to run any risk of being without food\r\nwhere it might be most needed.\r\n\r\nSomething had to be done, and that quickly, if we did not wish to\r\nexpose ourselves to the pangs of hunger and the danger of fever in\r\nthat filthy, miasmatic hole. In the dry season, we might return to\r\nCabuyaro, where we could secure horses or mules, and go thence to\r\nour next objective point, Villavicencio. During the rainy season,\r\nhowever, this was impossible. We had been told the night before, that\r\nseveral of the caños and rivers between Cabuyaro and Villavicencio\r\nwere quite impassable, as there were neither bridges nor ferries,\r\nand that the currents were so swift that it was quite out of the\r\nquestion for man or beast to cross them by swimming.\r\n\r\nWe were certainly in a quandary, if not in a very serious\r\npredicament. It was useless to go backwards, unless we wished to\r\nreturn to Orocué, and thence to Trinidad. Even if we returned to\r\nOrocué, we could not get a steamer down the river for several months,\r\nand to make the long trip to Ciudad Bolivar in a bongo was not to be\r\nthought of. We were confronted by the first really grave difficulty\r\nof our journey, and when we considered all the circumstances, it was\r\nenough to depress the stoutest heart.\r\n\r\n\"But why had not our men and mules arrived,\" we asked ourselves\r\ntime and again? Our telegram ordering them had been received and\r\nsatisfactorily answered. Just before leaving Orocué we had sent a\r\nsecond telegram advising our vaqueano--guide--when he should meet\r\nus but we had not awaited a reply, taking it for granted that there\r\nwould be no hitch in our plans. It now occurred that we had acted\r\nunwisely in not waiting for a response to our second telegram, so as\r\nto be sure that it had been received and was properly understood.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph line to Orocué had only recently been put up--just a few\r\nweeks before our arrival there--and had never been in satisfactory\r\nworking order. In fact, owing to a break in the wire, which lasted\r\na fortnight, we had not been able to get into communication with\r\nVillavicencio--the place whence our mules were to come--until a few\r\ndays before we started for Barrigón. Might there not have been another\r\ninterruption in the line after we sent our second message? And did\r\nthis message ever reach its destination? It is true that a week had\r\nelapsed since our departure from Orocué, and, if the line had been\r\nsevered, it might have been repaired.\r\n\r\nBut then again this was far from certain. The wire passed through\r\ndense and interminable forests--where there were no roads of any\r\nkind--and it might require several days to reach the break after it was\r\nlocated. And then after our vaqueano got our telegram it would require\r\nthree days for him to go from Villavicencio to Barrigón, supposing\r\nthat he had the mules and saddles in readiness. If they were not ready\r\nthere would be another delay in starting. Altogether the outlook was\r\nfar from reassuring. Our animals and men might arrive at any hour,\r\nand then again we might be obliged to wait for them for weeks.\r\n\r\nWhile occupied in these far from comforting reflections, we remembered\r\nthat the mail from Bogotá to Orocué was due. The men who would bring\r\nit would also bring a certain amount of freight for various points on\r\nthe Meta. Here, then, was a ray of hope. If our own men and animals\r\nshould fail us, we might be able to prevail on the mail carriers\r\nto give us the necessary means of transportation for ourselves and\r\nbaggage. This consideration tended to relieve somewhat the suspense\r\nwhich was the most unpleasant feature of our hapless situation. We\r\nresolved, accordingly, to take a more optimistic view of things,\r\nand to trust to our star which, so far, had ever been in the ascendant.\r\n\r\nWhat had greatly contributed to the gloominess of the outlook on\r\nour arrival at Barrigón was the thought that we should be obliged\r\nto leave our launch--where we were so comfortable--for the dismal,\r\nsteaming pest-hole on the river's bank. We did not for a moment think\r\nof asking for shelter in the filthy shack occupied by the negro\r\nfamily. That would be tantamount to courting paludismo--malarial\r\nfever--in its worst form. Fortunately, we had a good tent with us,\r\nand in this we could be shielded from sun and rain, and, at the same\r\ntime, escape some of the unsanitary features that rendered this spot\r\nso forbidding and dangerous. It was really the first place that we\r\nhad yet visited from which we instinctively shrank and from which we\r\nwished to depart at the earliest possible moment.\r\n\r\nWhile thus preoccupied and devising ways and means for rendering our\r\nenforced detention at this spot as endurable as circumstances would\r\npermit, our captain, God bless him! observing our distress, came\r\nto us, and with a kindness and courtesy we can never forget, said,\r\n\"No se preocupen, Señores, la lancha quedará aquí hasta que vengan\r\nlas bestias.\" Do not worry, gentlemen, the launch will remain here\r\nuntil the arrival of your animals.\r\n\r\nWhat a relief this kind and considerate act was--performed when\r\nand where it counted for so much to us--only those can realize who\r\nhave been placed in similar situations. Everything was now as well\r\nprovided for as might be, except food. Where that was to come from\r\nwas a mystery, as we did not wish to draw on the very limited supply\r\nwe had brought with us.\r\n\r\nOur first meal consisted of plátanos--some boiled and some fried--with\r\na cup of black coffee. I had never eaten a dozen bananas in any form\r\nbefore coming to South America, but I gradually became accustomed to\r\nthem, although I never relished them. Here, however, there was nothing\r\nelse in sight, except two or three ducks that were quacking about the\r\ngreen, miasmatic pools that surrounded the negro shanty. We endeavored\r\nto purchase these, but, although we offered the old dame several times\r\nwhat they were worth, she would not part with them. No African ever\r\nheld on more tenaciously to his fetish or rabbit-foot than did this\r\nswart Ethiopian hag of Puerto Nuevo to her prized webfeet.\r\n\r\nFor our dinner we fared better. Fortunately and quite unexpectedly,\r\nsomeone succeeded in landing a large and delicious fish, which was\r\nquite sufficient to furnish a meal for ourselves and crew. A new\r\nsource of food-supply was now indicated, but try as we would, it was\r\nimpossible to catch another fish--large or small. The impetuous current\r\nof the muddy river was decidedly adverse to our rising piscatorial\r\nhopes. But we determined not to worry on account of our lack of success\r\nas anglers. \"Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.\" Providence,\r\nwe were sure, would provide for the morrow. Probably our men and\r\nmules would arrive. If not, the mail carriers would undoubtedly come,\r\nand then no Deus ex machina would be necessary to extricate us from\r\nour embarrassing situation.\r\n\r\nA dreary day passed and a more dreary night. What with the suspense\r\nand the lack of proper food, and the confinement to a disagreeable\r\nspot in the impenetrable forest, our position was such as not to\r\nencourage slumber by night or rapturous admiration of tropical flora\r\nduring the day. Nevertheless, we still instinctively felt that relief\r\nwould not be long in coming.\r\n\r\nThe second morning we had our usual desayuno of black coffee and\r\nplátanos. And to our amazement, there was added to this simple fare\r\na fine roast chicken. Where did it come from? We had seen no chickens\r\nanywhere about the premises, and could not have been more surprised if\r\nit had dropped from the blue sky. I asked the captain, and he quietly\r\nreplied with a smile, \"Un poco de diplomacia. Nada mas.\" A little\r\ndiplomacy. Nothing more. Ever considerate about our comfort and needs,\r\nhe had instituted a search for provisions, and learned that the la\r\nvieja--the old woman, as he called her--had some chickens concealed\r\nnot far from the house, and, whether by persuasion or threats, he\r\nwould not say, he induced her to part with one of them, and intimated\r\nthat the same diplomacy he had employed in getting the first, would, if\r\nnecessary, avail in securing others. The outlook was still brightening,\r\nand we now felt more than ever that our deliverance was near.\r\n\r\nShortly after midday, while we were taking our usual siesta in the\r\nlaunch, we were suddenly startled by an unearthly noise. All the dogs\r\nand whelps of the place and all the \"curs of low degree\"--and there\r\nwere many of them--began to bark at once. And then in the forest\r\nnear by there was such shouting and screaming on the part of men\r\nand boys, accompanied by the neighing of horses and the braying of\r\nmules, that it seemed that a troop of guerrillas was bearing down\r\nupon us. Never before had we heard anything like it, except possibly\r\na Sioux or Navajo war whoop. They seemed to desire to frighten us\r\nto death before attacking us vi et armis. But no music could have\r\nbeen more grateful to our ears than were those discordant notes\r\nemitted by man and beast. We knew at once what it all meant, and,\r\nalmost before we could reach the top of the bank, our animals and\r\nmen were all gathered in the small free space in front of the cabin,\r\nand with them were the bearers of the Bogotá mail. There were about\r\nthirty mules and horses, and more than a dozen men.\r\n\r\nWe had telegraphed for mules only, as we did not think we should be\r\nable to get horses, but to our delight we found that we were to have\r\ntwo good saddle horses for our personal use, besides the mules destined\r\nfor our baggage. As, however, both men and animals needed rest, after\r\ntheir long tiresome trip from Villavicencio, it was deemed best to\r\ndefer our departure until the following morning. The animals were\r\nthen turned loose to browse on whatever they could find to appease\r\nhunger, and their masters were soon ensconced in their hammocks,\r\nslung wherever they could find a suitable place for them.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged with our vaqueano that we should all be ready\r\nfor our journey across the llanos de madrugada--at early dawn--the\r\nfollowing morning. We had a long day's ride before us, as the nearest\r\nstopping place, where we could hope to find food and shelter, was\r\nat a place called Barrancas, where was the house of the owner of a\r\nlarge hato--cattle farm.\r\n\r\nBright and early, then, the next morning, our peons and vaqueano\r\nwere busy saddling our horses and packing our baggage on the backs\r\nof the mules. The mail bongo from Orocué--which had left that place\r\nten days before we did--arrived a few hours before our departure,\r\nand all mail matter was hurriedly put on the backs of other mules by\r\nthose in charge of the mail destined for Bogotá and intervening points.\r\n\r\nIt was not without a pang that we bade farewell to our devoted crew,\r\nwho had done so much to render our voyage on the Meta and Humea as\r\npleasant as it was memorable. From the ever-courteous and thoughtful\r\ncaptain to our good-natured and obliging Guahibo, we were always the\r\nrecipients of delicate attentions of every kind. We might travel far\r\nbefore again meeting with men so kind and so sympathetic as were those\r\nfour whom it was our good fortune to meet in an isolated village of\r\nfar-off Colombia. \"God bless you all!\" we said in parting. \"Nothing\r\nis too good for you.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the first hour after starting we had to struggle through what\r\nthe natives call the montaña. It had nothing mountainous about it,\r\nas the name would seem to indicate, but was a dark, nearly impervious\r\nwood almost on a level with the waters of the Humea. In the dry season,\r\nI doubt not, the path through this forest would present no difficulty,\r\nbut during the rainy season it was next to impassable. Everywhere there\r\nwas deep, sticky mud and deeper pools and dirty stagnant water. Often\r\nour horses sank to the saddle-girths in the tenacious slime, and\r\nit was only by the greatest effort that they were able to extricate\r\nthemselves. At times, where the mud and water were unusually deep,\r\nwe were forced, for short stretches, to make our way through the\r\npathless forest. Then every step was impeded by branches and lianas\r\nand progress was next to impossible. Finally, with great difficulty\r\nfor the animals and not a little danger to ourselves, we succeeded in\r\neffecting our exit from this terrible montaña, and, before we were\r\naware of it, we found ourselves on high and dry ground on the edge\r\nof a beautiful, smiling prairie of apparently limitless extent.\r\n\r\nWhat a relief it was to get once more into the open--into the broad\r\nllanos of Colombia--where we could have an unimpeded view for miles\r\nin every direction. We had been in the depths of the forest so long,\r\ngetting only occasional glimpses of the llanos on our way up the\r\nriver, that we felt like a prisoner given his liberty after a long\r\nterm of confinement. Not that we had not enjoyed the forests while\r\nwe were in them. Far from it. We had enjoyed every moment of the\r\ntime spent in studying their richness and beauty. But now that we\r\nhad reached the llanos, to which we had so long looked forward, and\r\nwere no longer confined to the limited quarters of our launch; now\r\nthat we were on our willing steeds and could move as we chose in any\r\ndirection and as far afield as fancy might suggest, we experienced a\r\nsense of freedom and agility that surprised ourselves. We felt as if\r\nwe had suddenly been transferred to another world, so different was\r\nour new environment from that in which we had spent so many weeks.\r\n\r\nNever did the earth seem so green or the sky so blue, or the sun so\r\nbright; never did the face of nature appear so ravishingly beautiful as\r\non that glorious May morning near the picturesque Humea. And away to\r\nthe west, partly veiled by haze and cloud, loomed up higher than ever\r\nthose vast mountains of majesty and mystery that seemed to overhang\r\nthe world. Yes, we were slowly but surely approaching the Andes,\r\nand in a few days more, Deo volente, we should be scaling its dizzy\r\nheights and exulting in the splendid panoramas that would be presented\r\nto our enchanted gaze.\r\n\r\nThe landscape before us was indeed beautiful, entrancing as a vision,\r\nfair as the Happy Valley of Rasselas. Exulting in a new sense of\r\nfreedom, and stirred by many overmastering emotions, we could but\r\nexclaim with Byron,\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      \"Beautiful!\r\n        How beautiful is all this beautiful world!\r\n        How glorious in its action and itself!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI have called the part of the llanos we were then entering a prairie,\r\nbut it was far more beautiful than any of our plains known by that\r\nname. It was more like the palm-besprent delta of the Nile than the\r\ntame and almost treeless reaches of land which characterize so much of\r\nour western prairies. Here and there were coppices of graceful shrubs\r\nmade melodious by feathered songsters whose notes were new to us,\r\nbut everywhere, at no greater distance from one another, were our\r\nold friends that had accompanied us all the way from the mouth of\r\nthe Orinoco--the ever-attractive moriche palms.\r\n\r\nWe saw also several other species of palm that excited our interest,\r\nbut none more so than the strange corneto palm. Like various\r\nspecies of the Oenocarpus and Iriartea, it is remarkable for its\r\nadventitious or secondary roots, which, springing from the trunk in\r\nlarge numbers, lift it above the ground, and give it the appearance\r\nof a large column supported on a cone of smaller columns inclined to\r\nit obliquely. These roots vary from a fraction of an inch to several\r\ninches in diameter. They have at times a length of from six to ten feet\r\nand embrace a space of ground from five to eight feet in diameter. They\r\nare frequently covered by vines and parasites so as to form a natural\r\nbower which is used as a retreat by wild animals. Even the Indians\r\nhave recourse to these fantastic arbors as a place of refuge during\r\nrain storms.\r\n\r\nHere, as in the land of the Aruacs, the moriche palm is not only\r\na thing of beauty, but, for the Indians, a source of comfort and\r\njoy. This and other palms, notably a kind of date palm, and the\r\nCumana, which bears a fruit similar to the wild olive, supply the\r\nIndians, during certain months of the year, with all the food they\r\nconsume. Speaking of the palm, Padre Rivero declares it to be \"the\r\nearthly paradise of the Guahibos and Chiricoas. It is their delight,\r\ntheir general larder, their all. It is the subject matter of their\r\nthoughts and conversations. About it they dream, and without it life\r\nwould possess no joy for them.\" [161]\r\n\r\nLike the cocoa palm, \"By the Indian Sea, on the isles of balm,\"\r\nof which Whittier so sweetly sings, the palm on the Meta and its\r\naffluents, as well as on the lower Orinoco, is for the child of\r\nthe forest\r\n\r\n\r\n                          \"A gift divine,\r\n        Wherein all uses of man combine,--\r\n        House and raiment and food and wine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen contemplating the bountiful provisions of Nature in favor of\r\nthe inhabitants of the tropics, as evinced in various species of\r\nfood-producing palms, we are forcibly reminded of the statement\r\nof Linnæus that the first home of our race was somewhere in the\r\ntropics. \"Man,\" says this illustrious botanist, \"dwells naturally\r\nwithin the tropics, and lives on food furnished by the palm tree;\r\nhe exists in other parts of the world and subsists on flesh and\r\ncereals.\" [162]\r\n\r\nThe llanos in places are quite level, and intersected by numerous\r\ncaños and streams. Some of them are so large that they could easily\r\nbe converted into navigable canals for small craft. In other places\r\nthe plains are undulating and are ideal grazing lands during the\r\nrainy season. There is always an abundance of water, even in the\r\ndryest summer, and the numerous groves and clumps of trees suffice\r\nto furnish shade at all times for the largest herds.\r\n\r\nWe had not proceeded far when we met a large herd of cattle in care\r\nof herdsmen quietly reposing beneath some umbrageous moriche palm or\r\nsinging some favorite Llanero song. Contrary to what we expected,\r\nthe cattle were not so wild as those we had seen in Venezuela and,\r\nalthough we passed within a few yards of them, they barely noticed\r\nus. They were quite as tame as any one would find in the pasture\r\nlands of an Illinois farm.\r\n\r\nBut what a fine breed of cattle they were and in what splendid\r\ncondition! They were as fat, sleek and large as any we had ever seen\r\non the plains of Texas or Nebraska, and would, I am sure, command as\r\nhigh prices in the stockyards of Chicago.\r\n\r\nWe were deeply impressed with the future possibilities of the\r\nVenezuelan grazing lands, but we are now convinced that even a greater\r\nfuture awaits the llanos of Colombia when properly exploited. To\r\nextend the Cucuta railway so as to place Casanare and Villavicencio\r\nin connection with Lake Maracaibo would be a far less difficult and\r\ncostly undertaking than many other railroad enterprises in South\r\nAmerica that have been carried to a successful issue, and that, too,\r\nwhen the traffic hoped for was far less than it would be in this\r\ninstance. Such an extension, which would not need to be more than two\r\nor three hundred miles in length, would put the Colombian llanos in\r\ndirect communication with the chief ports of the United States and\r\nEurope. By using fast steamers, freight could then be carried from the\r\nheart of the llanos to Mobile or New York in a week. What an immense\r\ndevelopment of the cattle industry this would at once effect is beyond\r\ncalculation. It would be a greater source of revenue to the Republic\r\nof Colombia than all its mines combined.\r\n\r\nAt the first blush this project may appear Utopian to those who are\r\nunfamiliar with the country or who have never given thought to the\r\nfeasibility of the enterprise. Colombia, to most people in the United\r\nStates, is little better known than the territory of the Congo. Even\r\nto the Colombians themselves, the llanos--la parte oriental, as they\r\ncall it--is a terra incognita. Outside of the Llaneros--cattle men--who\r\nhave interests there, it is rarely visited by any one connected with\r\nthe administration of the government. To reach the llanos from Bogotá\r\nmeans a long and tiresome journey across the eastern Cordilleras,\r\nand few are willing to undertake such a trip out of curiosity or\r\nfor the purpose of informing themselves about the resources of this\r\ndistant and neglected part of their country.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, far away as they may seem, the llanos are not half so distant\r\nfrom the United States as England is, and, with the steamship and\r\nrailway facilities above indicated, they could be brought as near to\r\nNew York in time as is London at the present.\r\n\r\nProbably a more economical way of reaching the llanos would be by the\r\nOrinoco and the Meta. During the rainy season, as we have seen, boats\r\nof light draft, but of considerable tonnage, can safely traverse these\r\nrivers as far as Cabuyaro or Barrigón. A few hundred tons of dynamite\r\njudiciously applied would effect a wonderful change for the better in\r\nthe beds of the two rivers named, and would render navigation quite\r\nsafe for the whole, or at least a greater part of the year.\r\n\r\nWhen we note the magnitude of the beef trade between Australia and the\r\nArgentine and the different ports of Europe, we are amazed to observe\r\nthat so little has been attempted towards developing a similar but\r\na more profitable trade with regions that are comparatively at our\r\ndoors. If these fertile and favored lands, instead of belonging to a\r\ncountry long known, and looked at askance by capitalists and business\r\nmen, were a new discovery, there would be as great a rush towards them\r\non the part of colonists as there has frequently been to those Indian\r\nlands that have, from time to time, been opened to white settlers in\r\nOklahoma and elsewhere in the West.\r\n\r\nNow that our people are beginning to realize that the cattle in the\r\nUnited States are not increasing in proportion to the demands of its\r\nrapidly-growing population, they may be induced to turn their eyes\r\ntowards the vast plains of our two sister republics of Colombia and\r\nVenezuela, where there is, all the year round, abundant pasturage\r\nof the richest kind for millions of cattle. There are vast fortunes\r\nawaiting those who are willing to venture into these long-neglected\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nAccording to the reports of our Bureau of Animal Industry, the\r\nUnited States has been for some years past suffering from fever\r\nticks and other plagues an annual loss of more than sixty million\r\ndollars. This fact, coupled with the increasing demand for beef,\r\nrenders it imperative to seek for an adequate supply elsewhere. The\r\ncheapest and best place in which to secure this extra supply is,\r\nme judice, in the marvelous llanos so near our own country, which\r\nshould, in the manner indicated above, be brought much nearer than\r\nthey are at present.\r\n\r\nI know that people will hesitate about investing in countries whose\r\ngovernments are as unstable as those of the two nations mentioned,\r\nand where foreign investors have found so little encouragement\r\nand sympathy. There is, however, reason to believe that the age\r\nof revolutions is coming to an end, and that it will, in the\r\nnear future, be succeeded by the reign of law. Peace congresses,\r\narbitration agreements, the spread of education, and the construction\r\nof railroads have produced splendid results in other parts of the\r\nworld, where progress had long been unsatisfactory, and who will say\r\nthat we may not hope to see the same beneficent results realized in\r\nVenezuela and Colombia? If all else fail, it is quite certain that\r\nour government will know how to safeguard the rights of those of\r\nits citizens who may have interests in these countries about whose\r\nvalidity there can be no question. Now that all are so desirous of\r\nseeing improved commercial relations established between the United\r\nStates and the various countries of Latin America, it would seem to\r\nbe a matter of prime importance not any longer to ignore the golden\r\nopportunities that in the regions bordering the Caribbean have so\r\nlong eluded American energy and enterprise.\r\n\r\nIt was about four o'clock in the afternoon when we arrived\r\nat Barrancas. We found here a good-sized house with an open\r\nshed--enramada--near by. This latter structure is used as a shelter\r\nfor farming implements, harness, saddles, etc., and as a place where\r\npeons and herdsmen may swing their hammocks and sleep during the\r\nnight. The house, to our surprise, had a tile roof, the first we had\r\nseen since leaving Ciudad Bolivar.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of the hato, whose home and family were in Bogotá,\r\nreceived us cordially and did everything in his power to make us\r\ncomfortable. He also gave us his own room, which had a board floor,\r\nanother novelty to us. We were soon provided with a frugal repast,\r\nafter which we were entertained by our host's experiences on the\r\nllanos. He was one of eighteen children of the same mother. He and\r\nhis eleven brothers own a number of ranches and have many thousand\r\ncattle in different parts of the republic.\r\n\r\n\"During the last war,\" he said, \"the soldiers appropriated a\r\nthousand of our steers.\" \"Did you put in a claim to the government for\r\ndamages?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" he replied, \"but it did no good. I never got\r\na centavo and never expect to. If I had been a foreigner, especially\r\nif I had been an American, I should have received compensation for my\r\nloss. The government always pays foreign claims when just, but the\r\ncitizens of the country must be satisfied with promises. It always\r\npromises to reimburse us for any losses sustained during revolutions\r\nbut the fact is that we never get anything more substantial than\r\npromises.\"\r\n\r\nThe labor problem was as serious with him as with a Kansas farmer\r\nduring harvest time. \"Es muy dificil conseguir brazos aquí,\"--it\r\nis very difficult to secure laborers here--he told me in a tone of\r\nsadness. \"So many men lost their lives during the last war, that the\r\ncountry is now suffering for a lack of working men.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, notwithstanding his losses and his troubles, our host was a\r\nthoroughly loyal Colombian. He loved to talk about his country, its\r\nmarvelous resources, and the great future in store for it. He spent\r\nmost of the year in the capital, coming to Barrancas only for a few\r\nweeks at a time, and that only when business demanded his personal\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\nI was curious to learn from him, a Llanero, and therefore an expert\r\nhorseman, the shortest possible time in which the trip could be\r\nmade to Bogotá from Barrigón. Some books I had read stated that the\r\ndistance from the head of navigation on the Meta--and we had reached\r\nthat point--to Bogotá was only twenty miles, while certain Venezuelans\r\nI had met had assured me that the trip could be made in two days. His\r\nanswer was conclusive. \"The shortest possible time without a relay of\r\nhorses,\" he said, \"is four days. To attempt to cover the distance in\r\nless time would be fatal to the horse. I never try to reach Bogotá from\r\nhere in less than four days, and even this means hard riding.\" [163]\r\n\r\n\"But what brings you up the Orinoco and the Meta at this season of\r\nthe year,\" he enquired. \"You are certainly the first Americans to come\r\nhere--rio arriba--up the river. Others may have come to the llanos from\r\nthe capital, but, if they did, I am not aware of it. And why did you\r\nselect the rainy season for your journey? Why did you not wait until\r\nsummer, when it is dry, and when the roads are in better condition?\" We\r\nthen explained to him that no boats ascended the Meta during the summer\r\nseason and that we were thus forced to come during the winter. Strange\r\nas it may appear, this had never occurred to him. And yet he was an\r\nintelligent man and well informed about his country and presumably\r\nabout the means of communication with the countries adjacent.\r\n\r\nThe Colombian Llanero is a most interesting character. He is\r\nabsolutely unique among his countrymen. The only people with whom\r\nhe can be compared are the inhabitants of the Apure plains and the\r\nGauchos of the Argentine pampas. Like these he regards as \"fortunate\r\nthe man who has received from heaven the means of safeguarding life\r\nand property--a good horse and a good lance.\" [164] Having these two\r\nessentials of defense and offense, he is happy and independent.\r\n\r\nThis is readily understood from his manner of life, which is quite\r\nakin to that of the Arabian nomad. The desert in which he lives and\r\nhis eternal struggle against a physical environment that is as savage\r\nas it is grandiose; his occupation as a herdsman and his roving life\r\nin the boundless plain, have given the Llanero a character that is\r\nas original as it is interesting.\r\n\r\nAs a son of the desert, he is a lover of music and poetry, and\r\nwill spend an entire night or several consecutive nights dancing,\r\nplaying his rude guitar, scarcely larger than the hand that twangs it,\r\nor a huge banjo, and singing verses either of his own composition,\r\nor those of some other poet of the plains. For strange as it may\r\nappear, poets abound in the llanos as scarcely anywhere else. They\r\nmay be unable to read or write but they are nevertheless able to\r\nproduce songs--tonos or trovas llaneras--that are frequently marked\r\nby rare beauty and depth of feeling. Considering their limitations,\r\ntheir faculty for versification is often really remarkable, and it\r\nis not unusual to find among them a singer that will improvise with\r\nas much facility as an Italian improvisatore.\r\n\r\nThe Llaneros have a poetry of their own which they never abandon. They\r\ncompose what they sing and sing what they compose. And, although they\r\ncannot as yet point to one of their poets who has had the advantages\r\nof education and culture, they can, nevertheless, point with pride\r\nto many of their number who have produced metrical compositions of\r\nmarked excellence and power of expression. The pity is that so far we\r\nhave no anthology of these poets of the plains. There is certainly\r\na rich field here for research awaiting some lover of the fresh and\r\nthe novel in literature and it is to be hoped that some one may soon\r\nexplore a domain that is so promising in results.\r\n\r\nTheir favorite compositions are ballads or rhymed romances, called\r\ngalerones, which are sung as recitatives. They closely resemble the\r\npopular rhymed romances of Spain, and refer generally to deeds of\r\nprowess performed by their own heroes in their constant struggles\r\nwith the wild and unsubdued nature in which their life is cast. In\r\nthese galerones valor and not love is the protagonist. Love, in the\r\nmetrical compositions of the plains, is always a secondary character.\r\n\r\nTwo stanzas from a poem entitled En Los Llanos--On the Plains--will\r\nexhibit the character of these poems, and show, at the same time,\r\nthat the Llanero has a keen eye for the beautiful and sublime in\r\nnature and that his heart is open to the sweetest sentiment and the\r\ndeepest piety and reverence.\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Lejos, muy lejos del hogar querido\r\n        Paréceme que estoy en un desierto,\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Far, far away from my hearth,\" he laments, \"meseems I am in a\r\ndesert.\" And he gives his reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Cuando entre vivo rosicler la aurora\r\n        Muestra la fresca faz en el Oriente\r\n        En vano busco a mi gentil señora,\r\n        En vano á la hija que mi alma adora,\r\n        Para besarlas ambas en la frente.\" [165]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Llanero a view of the beauty and grandeur of his surroundings\r\nis a call to prayer, as is evinced by the following lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"O que prodigios! que beldad! El hombre\r\n        Debil se siente y pobre en su presencia.\r\n        No hay nada aqui que el corazón no asombre,\r\n        En todo escrito está de Dios el nombre,\r\n        Todo pregona aquí su Omnipotencia.\" [166]\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore daylight next morning, the vaqueano knocked at our door,\r\nannouncing that it was time to rise, as we had another long ride before\r\nus and must start early. Coffee was soon ready for us and also a roast\r\nchicken. The latter, however, was prepared in such a way that we did\r\nnot relish it. Then it was, indeed, that we missed our Indian cooks\r\nof the Meta. We asked for some milk for our coffee, but although\r\nsurrounded by large herds of cattle, there was not a drop of milk\r\nin the house. When we expressed surprise at this, the cook replied:\r\n\"We never milk the cows here. We leave the milk for the calves.\"\r\n\r\nI had often had a similar experience in the large ranches of the\r\ntrans-Missouri region and was not, therefore, specially surprised at\r\nthe answer. However, a little persuasion induced one of the peons\r\nto secure us a calabash of milk, although his task was not an easy\r\none. The cows, unaccustomed to being milked, refuse to stand still,\r\nand in this instance, the peon had to tie one of them to a tree. Even\r\nthen, he was obliged to call in the aid of an assistant before he\r\ncould get the milk we craved.\r\n\r\nOn the cattle farms of Venezuela, where the cows are quite wild, it\r\nis necessary to throw a noose around the horns of the animal to be\r\nmilked, and for one of the dairymen to hold it secure by a long pole,\r\nwhile another does the milking in the usual way. Our peon, fortunately,\r\nwas not obliged to resort to such a drastic, time-consuming method.\r\n\r\nAlthough it had rained heavily the greater part of the night, there\r\nwas no indication that the downpour would soon cease. On the contrary,\r\nit looked as if it were to continue raining all day. Fortunately,\r\nwe were provided with good waterproof ponchos, and were prepared for\r\nany aguacero--heavy shower--that Jupiter Pluvius might choose to send\r\nfrom the heavy, lowering clouds that, pall-like, overcast the sky.\r\n\r\nBefore we left Orocué, at the suggestion of the prefect of the place,\r\nwe had telegraphed to Villavicencio for a couple of bayetones--a\r\nspecial kind of poncho--and these our vaqueano had delivered to us\r\nat Barrigón.\r\n\r\nTo the inhabitants, especially the Indians of South America, and more\r\nparticularly those living in the Cordilleras, the poncho is what a\r\nmantle was to an Irishman in the days of the poet Spenser. \"When it\r\nrayneth it is his pent howse; when it blowes it is his tent; when\r\nit freezeth, it is his tabernacle. In sommer he can weare it loose,\r\nin winter he can weare it close; at all times he can use it, never\r\nheavy, never cumbersome.\" In a word, this \"weede is theyr howse,\r\ntheyr bedd, and theyr garment.\" [167]\r\n\r\nThe poncho or bayeton, [168] usually made of wool, in fully\r\nsix feet square with a hole in the centre to admit the head. Our\r\nbayetones--called \"nabby-tonys\" by C.--were really double ponchos,\r\nmade by sewing together two blankets, one red, the other blue. When the\r\nweather is damp and cloudy, the blue side is exposed, whereas it is the\r\nred that is kept outside when the sun is shining. The wearers of this\r\nuseful garment have learned by experience that these two colors are\r\ndifferently acted upon by heat and light and they accordingly adjust\r\nit so as to secure the maximum of comfort. The manta is a lighter\r\ncovering made of white linen and is sometimes highly embroidered. It\r\nis used when the sun's rays are more intense, because it reflects\r\nthe solar rays better than the red woolen garment. It is, however,\r\nrather an ornament than a necessity, and its use is confined almost\r\nentirely to the better classes.\r\n\r\nProvided with a poncho, a hammock and a many-pocketed saddle--which\r\nare almost as indispensable as his horse--the Llanero is always at\r\nhome. The two former, he carries in a bundle behind his saddle, where\r\nthey are always ready for him at a moment's notice. In camping out\r\nhe slings his hammock in any convenient place, and, if it be in the\r\nopen, the poncho is, by means of a rope, held over it in such wise\r\nthat he can defy the most violent storm of the tropics, and sleep as\r\nsoundly and be as well protected from the rain as if he were under\r\nhis own roof-tree.\r\n\r\nOur trail was one of the numerous cattle paths that intersect the\r\nllanos in every direction. The one we followed was a narrow ditch\r\nfilled with from one to two feet of water. Our vaqueano, who was\r\nin the lead, trotted along as if we were following a dry path, and\r\nwe had to keep up with him or be lost. It was then that we realized\r\nthe impossibility of traveling over these extensive plains without a\r\nguide, especially on a cloudy day during the rainy season. As well\r\nmight one try to cross the ocean without a compass as attempt to\r\nmake one's way over the llanos without a vaqueano. There was so many\r\ncaños--those natural channels, like deep ditches, connecting streams\r\nand rivers--and morasses to cross that were quite impassable except\r\nin certain places known only to the Llaneros, who are thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the country, that a stranger traveling alone would soon\r\nfind progress quite impeded.\r\n\r\nTo attempt to reach one's destination by relying on the oral directions\r\nof a Llanero would be quite hopeless. They would, probably, be worded\r\nsomewhat as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Continue your course over the savanna--arriba, arriba--up, up, until\r\nyou reach that bunch of cattle you see yonder. You see them, don't\r\nyou?\" queries the Llanero. They are some cows and young bullocks,\r\nlost in the distance. Not having an Indian's keenness of vision you\r\ndiscern absolutely nothing, and yet, unwilling to admit the fact,\r\nyou declare that you distinguish them perfectly. Your informant\r\nthen vouchsafes further information which, if you carefully heed and\r\nare able to follow, will without fail, conduct you to your desired\r\ngoal. \"Then,\" he continues, \"go to a clump of algarroba trees, but\r\nleave that aside and veer towards a group of palms which you will see\r\nfrom there. When you reach the palm group, coast along the foothills,\r\nacross the Caño del Cayman, for that is the name of the caño, until\r\nyou come to the Caño del Tigre. Next, you come to a copse of bamboos,\r\nand then after that to the Caño de Chaparro Negro. Near it you will\r\nfind the Paso del Caño. Cross it and you will come to a morichal at\r\nyour left, but leave it behind, and continue a little to the right\r\nfor half an hour, and you will see the place you are looking for.\"\r\n\r\nYears ago I had received similar directions from an old woman in the\r\nmountains of Conamara, but there, all I had to do was to keep on the\r\nroad, and stop at the place I was seeking when I reached it. In the\r\nllanos, where there are no roads, outside the hundreds of cattle paths\r\nextending in every direction, it would be natural for the traveler,\r\ndepending on directions like the above, promptly to lose himself.\r\n\r\nFortunately, we had a good vaqueano, one who knew every cowpath and\r\ncaño and clump of trees between Barrigón and Villavicencio, and we\r\nfelt thoroughly at ease under his guidance. At times, it is true,\r\nwe found it somewhat difficult to keep up with him. He seemed to\r\nhave reserved the speediest animal for himself, or he knew better\r\nhow to keep up a sustained trot than we did. But, be that as it may,\r\nwe managed never to permit him to vanish from sight.\r\n\r\nAs we were riding over the plains we observed a large number\r\nof vultures--Gallinazos--on a tree near our path. Hard by was\r\nthe carcass of an ox, that had just died, on which a single king\r\nvulture--Sarcoramphus Papa--like the one we fancied that preyed on\r\nthe liver of Tityus--was making his morning repast. The Gallinazos\r\nappear to stand in awe of the king vulture, and were patiently waiting\r\ntill he was satiated before making any attempt to appease their own\r\nvoracious appetites. The two species are never seen to feed on the\r\nsame carcass together. We saw several other such vulture banquets on\r\nour way, but never did we see so many of these scavengers congregated\r\naround the same carrion.\r\n\r\nAfter six hours of hard riding, most of the time in a heavy rain, we\r\nreached Los Pavitos. It consisted of a small bamboo hut and a number\r\nof sheds. Here we dismounted for our midday meal, which consisted of\r\na few boiled eggs, and a cup of café à la llanera--that is, coffee\r\nwithout milk or sweetening of any kind--sin dulce--as the natives\r\nphrase it--and some crackers that we had in an improvised haversack.\r\n\r\nThe family living in the hut consisted of three persons--man, wife\r\nand their little daughter, a sweet child of about four years of\r\nage. Both mother and child were neatly dressed, and had a genteel\r\nappearance that was in marked contrast with their surroundings. The\r\nchild wore a tidy pink dress, tastefully ornamented, and seemed as\r\nif she had just come from the class-room of a convent school. The\r\nfamily impressed us as having seen better days, and had evidently\r\nnot lived always so far away from their fellows.\r\n\r\nNear the house stood a large calabash tree, bearing the largest fruit\r\nof the kind we had yet observed. Some of the specimens of this tree\r\nlooked not unlike green pumpkins, and were fully from ten to twelve\r\ninches in diameter. It is well named the crockery tree, because,\r\nin the tropics, it supplies to a great extent the kitchen utensils\r\nwhich are elsewhere made from clay.\r\n\r\nWithin a few steps of the tree mentioned was a broad, murmuring\r\nstream--shaded on both sides by large, overhanging trees--of pure\r\ncrystal water. It was the first time in many weeks that we had seen\r\nclear, flowing water, and then was brought home to us, as never before,\r\nthe truth of old Captain John Hawkins' expressive words that there\r\nis nothing \"so toothsome as running water.\" While on the Orinoco and\r\nthe Meta, we always had with us large earthenware filters, for it was\r\nnot safe to drink the muddy waters of these rivers, often containing\r\nmore or less decaying animal matter.\r\n\r\nThe last thing we did before leaving our launch was to fill our canteen\r\nwith filtered water. But more than a day had elapsed since then, and\r\nour supply was exhausted. We accordingly proceeded to replenish our\r\ncanteen with water from the neighboring stream, but, as soon as the\r\nlady of the house saw what we were about, she begged us to permit her\r\nto render us this little service. \"I know where the water is best,\"\r\nsaid she, and, taking the canteen, she waded out almost to the middle\r\nof the stream and in a few moments returned with a new supply of\r\nwater fresh from the Andes.\r\n\r\nAs we prepared to leave, mother and child--the father was sick abed\r\nwith malaria--both expressed their regret that we could not remain\r\nlonger. \"We feel greatly honored,\" the good woman said, \"by your visit,\r\nand, if you ever come this way again, you must be sure to come to\r\nLos Pavitos. Dios guarde á VV. y feliz viaje.\" May God protect you\r\nand may you have a happy journey.\r\n\r\nSuch were the parting words of this gentle soul in the wilderness,\r\nwords of tenderest charity and sweetest benediction. For hours\r\nafterwards her touching accents seemed like music in our ears, and\r\nthe image of her lovely child, her darling niñita, nestling by her\r\nside, with her little hands waving us a fond adieu, was before our\r\neyes long after we had left the llanos far behind us.\r\n\r\nWhat was it in these gentle creatures, whom we saw for only a few\r\nmoments, that appealed to us so strongly? Was it that secret bond of\r\nsympathy--highly intensified by circumstances and environment--that\r\nmakes all the world akin? Was it the same sentiment that touched the\r\nartistic soul of Raphael, when, on passing through an Italian village,\r\nhe saw the mother and child whom he has immortalized in his Madonna\r\ndella Sedia. Or were we just then in the mood that impelled Goethe\r\nto indite his soul-subduing ballad Der Wanderer? Perhaps. Let the\r\nreader judge from the following stanza:--\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Farewell!\r\n        O Nature, guide me on my way!\r\n        The wandering stranger guide,\r\n\r\n       \"To a sheltering place,\r\n        From north winds safe!\r\n\r\n       \"And when I come\r\n        Home to my cot\r\n        At evening,\r\n        Illumined by the setting sun,\r\n        Let me a woman see like this,\r\n        Her infant in her arms!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Los Pavitos, we still had a three-hours ride ahead of\r\nus before reaching Las Palmas, where we purposed stopping for the\r\nnight. Fortunately, it had ceased raining and our trail was now in\r\na much better condition than it had been since leaving Barrancas.\r\n\r\nIt contributed much to our comfort, too, that we were able to\r\ncomplete our day's journey under sun-proof clouds. So far we had\r\nnot suffered the slightest inconvenience from the exaggerated heat\r\nof the plains. Some of our Ciudad Bolivar friends had told us that\r\nthe heat of the llanos was so intense that it would be necessary,\r\nif we would avoid sunstroke, to travel by night. As a matter of fact,\r\nthe temperature was never above 80° F. During the greater part of the\r\ntime it was several degrees below this figure. Besides, to attempt\r\nto cross the llanos in the rainy season, during the pitch-dark nights\r\nthat usually prevail, would be like trying to find one's way through\r\na Cimmerian bog. Not even the most experienced vaqueano would venture\r\non such a foolhardy journey.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Las Palmas just as the rays of the setting sun were\r\nbeginning to throw a veil of crimson and purple over the distant\r\nsummits of the Cordilleras. Here we met with the same cordial\r\nreception as elsewhere on the llanos. As, however, there was not room\r\nenough in the small choza and enramada for our entire party, we had\r\nrecourse to our portable tent, which we always had with us for such\r\nemergencies. When we enquired of our host what he could offer us for\r\ncomida, he sadly replied he had nothing but bananas, which were at\r\nour disposition. There were no eggs or chickens, and, although there\r\nwere herds of cattle all around us, it was quite impossible to get\r\na draught of milk. The cows would not permit anyone to milk them.\r\n\r\nWe then remembered that we yet had in our haversack a small tin box,\r\nstill unopened, of sliced Chicago bacon. This, with some crackers,\r\nwas all that was left of the little store of provisions that we had\r\nbrought with us. It was not without grave misgivings that we proceeded\r\nto open this remnant of our food-supply. We had, on several former\r\noccasions, found that our canned goods were unfit for use, and what\r\nif the contents of this last box should be spoiled? It meant that we\r\nshould be reduced to extremely short rations until we should reach\r\nVillavicencio, and there was no certainty when that would be. We had\r\nstill another montaña to pass, many rivers and caños to cross, and,\r\nabove all, the terrible Ocoa, which, on account of the floods that had\r\nbeen overflowing its banks during the past week, our vaqueano said,\r\nmight delay us for several days.\r\n\r\nBut the good God, who takes care of the birds of the air and clothes\r\nthe lily of the field, had not forgotten us. We found the contents\r\nof the box as fresh and wholesome as when first enclosed in the\r\nfar-off metropolis on Lake Michigan, and very pleasant was it, as the\r\nreader can imagine, for us, who had so long fared on chicken, eggs\r\nand bananas, to have a change in our aliment, in the form of sweet,\r\nnutty, breakfast bacon and that, too, from the glorious land of the\r\nStars and Stripes.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning we were again in the saddle. Before bidding\r\nus adieu our kindly host expressed his regret that he was unable to\r\ngive us better entertainment. He wished us to understand that it was\r\nthrough lack of means and not of good will. \"Dispense la mala posada,\"\r\nexcuse our poor lodging house, he said--and his wife and daughter,\r\na fair young girl just entering her teens, re-echoed his apologies\r\nand in accents that left no doubt as to their sincerity.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the night at Las Palmas, there was a\r\ngenuine tropical aguacero--the heaviest downpour that we had yet\r\nwitnessed. When we started from there the next morning it was\r\nstill raining heavily, and with no indication that there was to\r\nbe a change until late in the day, if then. Now, more than ever,\r\nwe congratulated ourselves on having secured our bayetones just when\r\nthey were so much needed. They were all they had been represented to\r\nbe and more. Although we had already spent many hours in continuous\r\nrainfalls, not a drop of moisture had yet reached our persons,\r\nand we had remained as dry as if we had traveled under a cloudless\r\nsky. The raincoats we had brought with us, although guaranteed to be\r\nthe best waterproofs made, would never have served the purpose that\r\nour bayetones answered so admirably.\r\n\r\nAfter about an hour's ride, we entered a montaña similar to the one\r\nnear Barrigón, but greater in extent. The mud was not so deep, but\r\nthere were more caños and streams to cross. Some of them were quite\r\ndeep, and in a few instances, the current was so strong that our\r\nhorses had difficulty in keeping themselves on their feet. Several\r\ntimes we turned to our vaqueano to enquire if a particularly large\r\nstream was the much-dreaded Ocoa. \"No, Señores,\" he always replied;\r\n\"El Ocoa es más grande\"--the Ocoa is larger.\r\n\r\nWe noticed that he was quite pensive and apparently as much preoccupied\r\nabout the Ocoa as we were ourselves. He then informed us that he\r\nhad learned at Las Palmas that the Ocoa had been impassable for\r\nseveral days past, and he feared we should be detained there for some\r\ntime. Just then we came to the largest and widest torrent that we had\r\nyet met. We effected the passage of this with the greatest difficulty,\r\nand not without considerable risk to both mount and rider. After we\r\nhad safely gotten across I turned again to our guide and said: \"That is\r\nsurely the Ocoa, is it not?\" \"No, Señor, el Ocoa es todavia más grande\r\ny más bravo.\" No, Sir, the Ocoa is still larger and more turbulent.\r\n\r\nFinally, after we had been about three hours in the montaña, the rain\r\ncontinuing all the while without cessation; after we had narrowly\r\nescaped being mired several times, or being carried away by several of\r\nthe impetuous water courses that obstructed our path--there were by\r\nactual count more than thirty of them; after a long struggle against\r\nthe dread that was so greatly depressing our vaqueano, and trying to\r\ntake an optimistic view of our situation, we had our attention directed\r\nto a loud roaring noise immediately in front of us. We knew at once\r\nwhat that meant, and did not need the information then volunteered\r\nby our guide, \"He aquí el Ocoa, Señores.\" That is the Ocoa, Sir.\r\n\r\nA few minutes more and we were on its banks. Swollen to an unusual\r\nheight by the recent heavy rainfalls in the Andes, it was now a\r\nraging, roaring mountain torrent that had attained the magnitude of a\r\ntumultuous river which swept everything before it. It must have been\r\nsuch a torrent that the poet Schiller had before his mind's eye when\r\nhe wrote The Diver, of which the following stanza is a part:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"And it seethes and roars, it welters and boils,\r\n        As when water is showered upon fire;\r\n        And skyward the spray agonizingly toils\r\n        And flood over flood sweeps higher and higher,\r\n        Upheaving, downrolling, tumultuously,\r\n        As though the abyss would bring forth a young sea.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nC., who had never witnessed in Trinidad such exhibitions of storm and\r\nflood, was in despair. Our peons, finding their worst forebodings an\r\nactuality, were distressed and disconsolate. If they could but reach\r\nthe other side of the river, they would be almost in sight of their\r\nhomes from which they had been absent for more than a week.\r\n\r\n\"How long shall we be obliged to wait before we can cross?\" someone\r\ntimorously inquired. \"If it does not rain any more,\" the reply came,\r\n\"we may get over to-morrow evening. If there is another aguacero in\r\nthe mountains, Dios sabe,\"--God knows--\"how long we may be detained\r\nhere.\" Just then, one of the peons who claimed superior knowledge\r\nabout the behavior of such rios bravos as the one before us, gave\r\nit as his candid opinion, that, even if there were no further rain,\r\nit would be quite impossible to effect a passage inside of three days.\r\n\r\nTo one unfamiliar with the suddenness with which mountain streams\r\nbecome raging torrents, [169] and the quickness with which they\r\nsubside, these declarations of opinion were depressing enough. I\r\nhad, however, spent many years among the Rocky and Sierra Madre\r\nmountains, and had often had occasion to study the modus operandi of\r\nthe cloud-bursts that are there of so frequent occurrence. Besides\r\nthis, while our peons were disputing among themselves as to what was\r\nbest to be done in our embarrassing situation, I had been carefully\r\nobserving the height of the water line and found, to my great delight,\r\nthat it was gradually becoming lower. After making a few measurements,\r\nI found that, if there were no further rainfall, we should be able\r\nto cross to the other side before sundown.\r\n\r\nAs it was now long past noon, and we had had nothing to eat since\r\nearly morning, it was suggested that we take a little luncheon, while\r\nwaiting for the river to become fordable. Suiting the action to the\r\nword, a fire was started, our kit of kitchen utensils was drawn from\r\nits sack, and in a short time we had a large cup of fragrant, black\r\ncoffee, and the remnant of our breakfast bacon fried in a manner\r\nto do credit to a New York chef. We still had a few soda crackers,\r\nand these, together with the coffee and bacon, furnished us with a\r\nrepast that left nothing to be desired.\r\n\r\nHaving no doubt about our ability to reach Villavicencio before\r\nnightfall, we gave all the remaining eatables to our vaqueano and\r\npeons. They thankfully partook of the coffee and crackers, but a mere\r\ntaste of the bacon quite satisfied them. They had evidently never\r\neaten any before and, far from relishing it, found it positively\r\ndistasteful. They had yet to acquire a taste for bacon as others\r\nacquire a taste for snails and frogs' legs. They still had with them\r\na few platanos--their staff of life--which they roasted, and with\r\nthese and the crackers and coffee we gave them they fared even better\r\nthan usual.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon was finished, it was found that the river had fallen\r\nenough to justify an attempt to cross it. Great caution, however,\r\nwas necessary to prevent any possible mishap. First, the largest and\r\nstrongest mule in the drove was relieved of his burden and forced\r\nto cross the river alone. He examined it very suspiciously and at\r\nfirst hesitated about entering the water. But he was so belabored\r\nwith sticks and clubs that the poor beast had no alternative. After\r\nhe had started towards the other side the peons all kept up such an\r\nunearthly yell that he was afraid to venture back. After a terrific\r\nstruggle he succeeded in reaching the opposite bank.\r\n\r\nThe current was evidently still too strong to warrant another\r\nexperiment of this kind. So we waited about a half an hour, when a\r\nsecond mule--a smaller one--was driven into the water. He had barely\r\nreached the middle of the river when he was lifted off his feet,\r\nand carried some distance down stream. It looked, for a few moments,\r\nas if he was going to be lost, but, by vigorous exertion, he got on\r\nhis feet again, and stood in mid-river breasting the full force of the\r\ncurrent and looking piteously towards his masters for assistance. But\r\nthey merely jeered at him vociferously and asked him if he wished to\r\nreturn to Barrigón.\r\n\r\nSeeing no help forthcoming, the terrified brute made a supreme\r\neffort and succeeded in getting back to the bank from which he\r\nhad started. There he stood for a while panting heavily, after the\r\nstrenuous efforts he had made, but all the while looking wistfully\r\nat his companion on the opposite bank of the Ocoa. After he was\r\nsomewhat rested, and before any one realized what he was about to do,\r\nthe mule was again in the water, making, of his own accord, a second\r\nattempt to reach the other side of the river, where his companion\r\nwas awaiting him. After battling with the current for some minutes,\r\nhe was successful in his venture, for which he received the unstinted\r\napplause of his masters. No sooner had he emerged from the water than\r\nhe gave a long, loud bray of victory which awoke the echoes in the\r\nwoods for miles around. The whole performance was so comical that it\r\nprovoked roars of laughter from our entire party. As an illustration\r\nof mule-headedness in a good cause, in face of apparently insuperable\r\ndifficulties, it was superb.\r\n\r\nHaving proved the fordableness of the river by mules, the peons\r\ndetermined to match their own strength against the still-impetuous\r\ncurrent. Accordingly, one of their number, a giant in strength, taking\r\nthe end of a hundred-foot lariat between his teeth, carefully entered\r\nthe water, and, after successfully buffeting the angry billows,\r\nlanded on the opposite bank, whence the two mules had watched his\r\nstruggles with apparent interest and sympathy.\r\n\r\nNow that the lariat was firmly stretched between the two banks, and\r\nthat the river was still falling, it was a matter of only a short\r\ntime to transfer the remaining mules and the baggage to the other side.\r\n\r\nThe jurungos [170]--a Llanero epithet for strangers--were the last to\r\ncross. Elevating our feet as much as possible, to avoid getting wet,\r\nwe were soon in mid-stream. The motion of the water in one direction\r\nwhile our horses were struggling in the other, had a tendency to\r\ninduce vertigo, but as we had to be on the alert every instant, in\r\norder to preclude all danger of miscarriage, we soon found ourselves\r\nhappily landed, with the dread Ocoa at last in our rear.\r\n\r\nIt was now only a short ride to Villavicencio, over comparatively\r\ndry and slightly rising ground. Ere the sun had dropped behind the\r\nAndes we had alighted before our lodging house near the plaza on the\r\nmain street of the town. Our host, who was awaiting us at the door,\r\ngave us a most cordial greeting, but seemed to be much surprised\r\nand embarrassed. He then explained that he had misunderstood the\r\ntelegram that he had received from Orocué announcing our arrival and\r\nrequesting him to have piezas--rooms--reserved for us. \"I inferred\r\nfrom the telegram,\" he said, \"that you were Colombians and never,\r\nfor an instant, dreamed that I should have the honor of entertaining\r\nforeigners. Had I known whom I was to have as my guests, I should\r\nhave made more elaborate preparations for your reception. As it is,\r\nI can offer you only an unfurnished room. It is the best I have,\r\nand I trust you will excuse my not making better provisions for your\r\ncomfort during your sojourn in our midst. We have no hotels here,\r\nand our people, when traveling, are accustomed to lodge with their\r\nfriends, or take an apartment like the one reserved for you.\"\r\n\r\nThe good man's explanation was quite unnecessary, as we were more\r\nthan satisfied with our room. It was large and airy, and, although\r\ndevoid of furniture of every kind, it had a clean board floor, and\r\nthat was a great deal for travelers, who, like ourselves, had been\r\nroughing it on the Meta and the llanos.\r\n\r\nHe was much relieved when he saw how easy it was to satisfy his guests,\r\nand without more ado, he proceeded to order dinner for us without\r\ndelay. While dinner was preparing we had our dufflebags brought\r\ninto our apartment, and, in a very short time, our camp chairs were\r\nunfolded and our cots and bedding arranged for the night. A table\r\nwas next brought in from an adjoining house, and soon a young Indian\r\nmaid arrived to make the necessary preparations for our evening\r\nrepast. Our meals, it had been arranged, were to be served from a\r\nrestaurant a few doors away. The señora in charge, and her daughter,\r\nwho belonged to an old Colombian family, now in reduced circumstances,\r\nleft nothing undone to insure the most satisfactory service possible.\r\n\r\nA bountiful dinner, such as we had not had since leaving Orocué,\r\nwas soon on the table. There were meats, vegetables and various\r\nkinds of fruits and, what we found specially agreeable, good wheaten\r\nbread. Besides all these viands, there was an additional and unexpected\r\nluxury in the form of a quart bottle of generous old Bordeaux. It\r\ngoes without saying that we showed due appreciation of the señora's\r\nculinary skill. Never did the dishes of a Parisian restaurateur seem\r\nmore inviting. Now came to us with special force the old saying that\r\n\"appetite is the best sauce,\" and that for travelers like ourselves,\r\n\"Il vaut mieux découvrir un nouveau plat qu' un nouveau planète,\"\r\nit is better to discover a new dish than a new planet.\r\n\r\nAs we had resolved to remain a few days in Villavicencio before\r\nessaying the trip across the Cordilleras, we felt a sense of relief,\r\nby anticipation, in the thought that we should not, before daybreak\r\nthe following morning, be obliged to hearken, as hitherto, to the\r\nusual announcement of our vaqueano, \"Vamonos, Señores--Gentlemen,\r\nit is time to start.\"\r\n\r\nAs we were both quite fatigued, we did not delay long in seeking\r\nrepose on our ever-restful cots. And it was but a very short time\r\nbefore at least one of the travelers was in the land of dreams. And\r\none of the visions that appeared to him was that of a little child\r\nin a pink frock, standing beside her mother under a totuma tree,\r\nnear a crystal stream in the llanos, waving her tiny hand and lisping\r\na sweet Adiosito to two strangers from beyond the sea, whose course\r\nwas towards the western sky, where the giant Andes stood to salute\r\nthe approaching lord of day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE CORDILLERA OF THE ANDES\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"To sit on rocks, to muse o'er flood and fall,\r\n        To slowly trace the forest's shady scene,\r\n        Where things that own not man's dominion dwell,\r\n        And mortal feet hath ne'er, or rarely been;\r\n        To climb the trackless mountain all unseen.\r\n\r\n       \"This is not solitude; 'tis but to hold\r\n        Converse with Nature's charms, and see her stores unrolled.\"\r\n\r\n                                                            --Byron.\r\n\r\n\r\nVillavicencio, the capital of the National Territory of the Meta,\r\nis situated at the very foot of the Andes, and is an attractive town\r\nof about three thousand inhabitants, many of whom are Indians. Its\r\naltitude above sea level, according to our barometer, is slightly less\r\nthan fifteen hundred feet. It is a little more than ninety-three miles\r\nfrom Bogotá and has an average annual temperature of 83° F. During our\r\nsojourn in the place the thermometer never rose above 76° F. in the\r\nshade, and it was occasionally several degrees below this point. And,\r\nalthough little more than seventy-five miles north of the equator,\r\nit was so cool at night that we always used our blankets.\r\n\r\nA handsome church is located on one side of the spacious green\r\nplaza. Not far distant is a well-conducted convent school in charge\r\nof nuns recently expatriated from France, in consequence of the laws\r\nenacted against religious orders. The people are never tired sounding\r\nthe praises of these good sisters and telling the visitor of the\r\nwonders they have accomplished in behalf of their children. Here,\r\nas elsewhere, \"The stone which the builders rejected; the same shall\r\nbecome the head of the corner.\"\r\n\r\nVillavicencio, like Cabuyaro, and other places in the llanos, is\r\neagerly looking forward to the day when it shall be connected by rail\r\nwith the national capital and the Meta. For nearly a century and a\r\nhalf a commercial route connecting Bogotá with the Meta and the Orinoco\r\nhas been talked of but nothing has been done to make it a reality.\r\n\r\nIn 1783 the archbishop of Sante Fe, Monsignor Cabellero y Gongora,\r\nthen viceroy of New Granada, caused a map to be made of the course of\r\nthe Meta and the Orinoco to the Atlantic, with a view of developing\r\ncommerce by that route, but the all-powerful opposition of Santa Marta\r\nand Cartagena nullified his efforts. Several times since that date\r\nthe project has been resumed but each time it had to be abandoned\r\nin favor of the Magdalena, owing to the pressure brought to bear on\r\nthe government by the merchants of Cartagena and Santa Marta. There\r\nis no doubt that the route via the Meta and the Orinoco would, in\r\nsome respects, possess many advantages over that of the Magdalena,\r\naside from developing much country now practically neglected.\r\n\r\nUnlike Venezuela, Colombia favors free navigation of her rivers\r\nby all nations, and would welcome foreign craft on the Meta as she\r\ndoes on the Magdalena. Venezuela, however, favors monopolies, and,\r\nclaiming absolute control of the Orinoco, has closed the Meta and the\r\nother affluents of the Orinoco to all steamers except those belonging\r\nto the one company which has a monopoly of the trade of the Orinoco\r\nand all its tributaries. How detrimental such a monopoly is, not only\r\nto Colombia but to Venezuela as well, can be seen at a glance. Some\r\nof the greatest resources of both countries are left undeveloped and\r\nprogress in any direction is quite impossible.\r\n\r\nThis matter was taken up at the International Congress of Mexico in\r\n1901, in connection with a plan to render navigation possible through\r\nthe interior of the continent of South America from the Orinoco to\r\nthe River Plate, but so far nothing has been accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the eastern portion of Colombia is still isolated\r\nfrom the rest of the world, and will remain so until Venezuela shall\r\nrecognize the fatuity of its short-sighted policy, or until the great\r\ncommercial nations shall demand that the navigation of the Orinoco\r\nand its tributaries, like that of the Amazon and its affluents, be\r\nfree to all vessels, no matter under what flag they may sail. And as\r\nsoon as commerce shall awaken to the fact that an immense field of\r\nuntold riches is closed to her activities in the forests and plains\r\nof the Orinoco basin--and that must be ere long--a demand will be\r\nmade not only in the interests of South America but also in that of\r\nthe entire civilized world.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of how Colombia has been made to suffer by the\r\narbitrary policy of Venezuela regarding waterways, of which both\r\nthe sister republics should be beneficiaries, a single instance\r\nwill suffice.\r\n\r\nShortly before our arrival in Villavicencio, a company was formed\r\nto supply electricity to the city. As there are no roads between\r\nBogotá and Villavicencio, which would permit the transportation of\r\nthe necessary machinery, the only way available for the introduction\r\nof such heavy freight was by the Orinoco and the Meta. It was\r\naccordingly planned to have the dynamos and other requisites brought\r\nby this route, but, when all was ready for shipment, the projectors\r\nof the enterprise learned that the Venezuelan government--that is,\r\nPresident Castro--would refuse to grant the necessary permission for\r\nthe transportation of the merchandise in question. The idea, then,\r\nof lighting the city by electricity had to be abandoned, and the\r\ncapital of the Meta territory is, as a consequence, forced to remain\r\ncontent with tallow candles and kerosene lamps.\r\n\r\nThe people of Villavicencio, as elsewhere in Colombia, we found\r\nto be extremely courteous and hospitable. They were eager to hear\r\nabout America, and in turn were quite willing to afford all possible\r\ninformation about their own country, and especially about the llanos\r\nand Llaneros. We soon became acquainted with all the leading officials\r\nand business men, and recall with pleasure the many delicate attentions\r\nthey showed us while in their midst. We were invited to visit their\r\ncountry estates and to examine some new industries--yet in their\r\ninfancy--which gave promise of a bright future.\r\n\r\nOne of these was the rubber industry. Not content with the trees\r\nthat grow spontaneously in the forests in this part of the country,\r\na certain general--one of many we met here--conceived the idea of\r\ncultivating the rubber tree and had, accordingly, during the preceding\r\nyear, set out no fewer than a half million small trees, and had it in\r\npurpose to plant many times this number in the near future. He said\r\nall that he had already planted were doing well, and he had no doubt\r\nabout the success of the enterprise. He was most sanguine about the\r\nfuture of eastern Colombia, and expressed it as his belief that in\r\na few years Colombia would be as favorably known for her rubber as\r\nshe is now for her cacao, coffee and tobacco.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why the scientific cultivation of the rubber tree\r\nshould not be attended with as good results in Colombia as have so\r\nsignalized its culture in Ceylon and the Malay Peninsula. In view of\r\nthe destructive system of treating the rubber trees in Brazil and other\r\nparts of South America in collecting the latex, and the increasing\r\ndemand for rubber in our various rapidly expanding industries, it\r\nwould seem that the rubber plantations, like the one above mentioned,\r\nare sure to yield their owners a handsome profit.\r\n\r\nNothing better illustrates what may be expected in this direction\r\nthan the experiment made a few decades ago in India with the cinchona\r\ntree. Previously to the introduction of this tree into India, where\r\nthere are now many extensive plantations under cultivation, the sole\r\nsource of supply of Peruvian bark was from the tropical slopes of the\r\nAndes. Now, in consequence of the vigorous competition with India,\r\nthe cinchona industry in the Andean regions is only a fraction of\r\nwhat it formerly was, and, unless something can be done to arrest its\r\nrapid decline, it will soon have lost its importance as an article\r\nof export from the Cordilleras.\r\n\r\nWe spent three days in Villavicencio and enjoyed every hour of the\r\nstay among its kindly people. We had thus an opportunity of securing\r\nmuch needed repose, and of preparing ourselves for our arduous trip\r\nacross the cloud-reaching Andes. We might have continued, without\r\ninterruption, our journey from the plains to Bogotá, but it would have\r\nbeen highly imprudent to make the attempt. A sudden change from the\r\nlowlands to Andean heights, and from the heat of the llanos to the\r\nfrigid blasts of the paramos, is something of which the native has an\r\ninstinctive dread. He accordingly makes his journey by slow stages,\r\nso as to become acclimated on the way. In driving cattle from the\r\nllanos to Bogotá several weeks are deemed necessary, as otherwise\r\nmany of them would expire on the road. They appear to be much more\r\naffected than man by rapid changes of altitude and temperature.\r\n\r\nWe had been warned time and again by well-meaning persons about the\r\nrisk we incurred by so soon attempting to cross the Cordilleras, after\r\nspending so much time in the lowlands of the Orinoco and the Meta. \"You\r\nshould,\" we were told, \"spend several weeks on the road, stopping a\r\nfew days at each posada on the way. Only in this wise can you become\r\nacclimated, and render your system proof against the certain dangers\r\nof violent changes of temperature and altitude. As you approach the\r\nsummit of the Andes you will see the sides of the trail strewn with\r\nthe bleached bones of cattle and horses that have succumbed to the\r\ncold and the rare atmosphere of this elevated region. More than this,\r\nyou will see hundreds of crosses by the wayside marking the spots\r\nwhere over-venturesome travelers were emparamados--frozen--by the\r\narctic cold of the paramos, and where they found their last resting\r\nplace. And so strong is the wind on the cumbre--the summit--of the\r\nmountain range that people are sometimes blown into the yawning chasm\r\nthat adjoins the dreadful pass.\"\r\n\r\nTo confirm their statements they reminded us of the fearful losses\r\nin men and animals sustained by Bolivar when he led his army from\r\nthe plains of Varinas to the lofty plateau of Cundinamarca; how\r\nhundreds of men and horses perished from the intense cold on the\r\nelevated pass through which they vainly tried to force their way,\r\nand how the entire army was exposed to extermination by the combined\r\naction of arctic cold and hurricane blasts.\r\n\r\nWe made no reply to these well-meant warnings, but we could not help\r\nrecalling similar words of caution before we started on our journey\r\nup the Orinoco and the Meta. Then the dangers to be apprehended were\r\nfrom the climate--from intense heat and a pestiferous atmosphere;\r\nfrom wild animals and wilder men. Now it was danger of an opposite\r\nkind--danger from cold, of being frozen, or of contracting pneumonia,\r\nwhich in those great altitudes is certain death.\r\n\r\nAside from a few uncomfortable nights--which, with a little care, might\r\nhave been obviated--caused by the active zancudo and the coloradito--we\r\nhad escaped all the predicted dangers of the lowlands, and we now felt\r\nreasonably sure that we should be equally fortunate in eluding those\r\nthat were said to await us in the regions of everlasting snow. We\r\nwere better equipped for making the trip than the poor, ill-clad\r\nnatives from the llanos, and we could regulate our vesture to suit the\r\ntemperature. Snow and frost had then no terrors for us, and as we had\r\nbeen accustomed to sudden changes of altitude, without experiencing\r\nany evil effects, we felt we had nothing whatever to apprehend.\r\n\r\nOn the third morning after our arrival in Villavicencio we were\r\nready to start for Bogotá, and expected to make the journey of\r\nninety-three miles in three days. We had secured mules that were\r\nused to mountain travel. Those that we had in crossing the llanos\r\nwould never have answered our purpose. Our vaqueano and peons were\r\nserranos--mountaineers--thoroughly familiar with the route we were\r\nto take. They all seemed to be good, reliable young men, and we felt\r\nthat the last stage of our journey, before reaching Bogotá, would be\r\nquite as enjoyable as any that we had already completed.\r\n\r\nAfter many cordial expressions of good wishes on the part of the\r\ncrowd assembled to witness our departure, and repeated exclamations\r\non all sides of \"Felíz viaje!\"--a happy journey--and \"Dios les guarde\r\ná VV!\"--God protect you--we said our last adios to all and turned\r\ntoward the Andes. \"Vamos con Dios,\" ejaculated our vaqueano. \"Y con\r\nla Virgen,\" was the response of the peons and the bystanders.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment we left the door of our temporary lodging, our road was\r\nup grade. As we passed along the street that terminates at the foot of\r\nthe mountain, it seemed that all the women and children of the place\r\nwere at the doors to get a last view of the jurungos--foreigners--whose\r\narrival from the eastern sea by the great river had been commented\r\non as a more than ordinary event.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we had passed the last house of the city, there was a sudden\r\nmarked increase in the grade of our trail, and we then felt, for the\r\nfirst time, that we were in sober earnest beginning the actual ascent\r\nof the Andes. In two hours we had reached Buena Vista, a lovely spot,\r\neleven hundred and forty feet above Villavicencio.\r\n\r\nWe had frequently been told in Orocué and elsewhere that we should\r\nhave a beautiful view of the llanos from Buena Vista, and that we\r\nwould do well to tarry there for a while to enjoy the panorama that\r\nwould be visible from this elevated spur of the mountain.\r\n\r\nWhen a South American--especially one familiar with the\r\nmountains--speaks in terms of praise of any particular bit of scenery,\r\none may be sure that he does not exaggerate. He is so accustomed to\r\nsplendid exhibitions of tropical beauty and mountain grandeur that\r\nhe passes unnoticed what we of the North should describe as superb,\r\nmagnificent, glorious. Such scenes are to him as common as the\r\ngorgeousness of the setting sun and the sublimity of the starlit\r\nheavens are to us and fail to move him for the same reason that\r\nthe splendors of sun and sky rarely affect us as they would if but\r\noccasionally visible. They are everyday objects and the pleasure they\r\nshould afford palls accordingly.\r\n\r\nWe were not disappointed in our anticipations regarding the view\r\nfrom Buena Vista. On the contrary, it far exceeded anything we had\r\nimagined. The sky, with the exception of a few fleecy clouds flitting\r\nathwart it, was clear and the sun was almost in the zenith. Far below\r\nus, and extending away--north, east, south--towards the dim and distant\r\nhorizon, were the llanos, every feature of which was brought out in\r\nbright relief by the brilliant noonday sun.\r\n\r\nIn the foreground was the montaña through which we had passed just\r\nbefore reaching Villavicencio. Farther afield was a limitless sea\r\nof verdure, interspersed with groups of trees, which offered their\r\ngrateful shade to the countless herds that reposed beneath their\r\nwide-spreading branches. In every direction the green savannas\r\nwere intersected by caños and rivers which looked like streams of\r\nmolten silver. It was, indeed, a panorama of surpassing beauty and\r\nloveliness--of its kind unique in the wide world. It was the boundless\r\nplain in eternal converse with the heavens above. It was the abode\r\nof liberty, and the trysting-place of life--life palpitating in the\r\nsunshine and beneath the emerald borders of the sliver-like water\r\ncourses that were all hastening with their tribute from the Andes\r\nto the Meta, which, far off in the southeast, seemed like a line of\r\nunion between earth and sky.\r\n\r\nWe have nothing in our country that can bear comparison with the\r\nmatchless picture seen from Buena Vista. The view of the delta of the\r\nNile--just before harvest time, with its numberless canals and water\r\ncourses--from the summit of Cheops, contains some of the elements of\r\nsoft tropical beauty so conspicuous in the Buena Vista landscape;\r\nbut it lacks the variety, the sweep, the coloring, the harmonious\r\neffects of light and shade, the immensity, and above all the wondrous\r\nsetting afforded the latter prospect by the Titanic Cordilleras.\r\n\r\nBut the measureless expanse of grassy plain that lies before us is\r\nbut an insignificant fraction of the llanos. They extend from the\r\nsouthern slopes of the Coast Range of Venezuela to the base of the\r\nParime uplands and the Rio Guaviare; from the Andes to the delta\r\nof the Orinoco. They are thus almost conterminous with the Orinoco\r\nbasin. They, indeed, constitute one of the three immense districts\r\ninto which the whole of South America is divided. The other two are\r\nthe Selvas of Brazil and the Pampas of Argentina, separated from\r\neach other and from the llanos of the north, by low transverse ridges\r\nrunning east and west from the Atlantic to the Cordilleras.\r\n\r\nTo geologists these vast lowlands have a special interest, as they\r\nwere at one time the bed of an inland sea more extensive far than the\r\npresent Mediterranean. Even now, during the rainy season, certain parts\r\nof this immense expanse are covered by fresh water lakes thousands\r\nof square miles in extent. A subsidence of a few hundred feet would\r\nagain bring the whole of this illimitable territory down below sea\r\nlevel and cause again the formation of the great tropical sea that\r\nexisted in prehistoric times.\r\n\r\nTo the student of history a special interest attaches to the llanos\r\nof western Venezuela and eastern Colombia. It was across these plains\r\nand swamps, under the most trying difficulties, that Bolivar led his\r\nhalf-clad, half-famished army, during his memorable march across the\r\nCordilleras, before achieving the independence of New Granada in the\r\nfamous battle of Boyacá.\r\n\r\nBut great as was the feat accomplished by Bolivar in traversing\r\nthe llanos, great as were the difficulties he had to contend with,\r\nthey pale into insignificance when compared with the hardships and\r\nachievements of the early descubridores--explorers--of these then\r\nunknown wilds. Bolivar and his men traveled through a country that had\r\nbeen long settled, and were among friends and compatriots. The early\r\nexplorers and conquistadores were, on the contrary, in an unknown land,\r\namong murderous, relentless savages armed with poisoned arrows. They\r\nwere in a region where it was often impossible to procure food, and\r\nwhere several times starvation was imminent. For months at a time\r\nthey wandered through dark, tangled forests, cutting a road as they\r\nwent, lured on by the hope of fame and fortune. Then they had to feel\r\ntheir way through deep and treacherous morasses, in which they had\r\nto confront even greater dangers than in the obscure woodlands. But\r\nnotwithstanding dangers and difficulties of every kind, they kept\r\nmoving forward through woods and swamps, across rivers and mountains,\r\never in pursuit of gold and precious stones, and of the fabulous\r\nriches of the Meta and the treasure city of Manoa.\r\n\r\nAmong these famous descubridores was the German, George Hohermuth,\r\nwhom the Spaniards called Jorge de Spira. Starting from Coró,\r\non the Caribbean, with three hundred and sixty-one men and eighty\r\nhorses, he directed his course southwards, where, he was assured,\r\nwere inexhaustible treasures of every kind. Crossing the llanos of\r\nVenezuela and New Granada, he must have passed near the present site\r\nof Buena Vista.\r\n\r\nDuring our journey we certainly crossed his line of march, which in\r\nthis latitude was probably near the base of the Cordilleras. Spurred\r\non by an ever-receding ignis fatuus, he continued his march until\r\nhe reached the Japura, an affluent of the Amazon, and but a short\r\ndistance from the equator. During this frightful journey he crossed\r\nthe Arauca, the Apure, the Meta, the Guaviare and other broad and deep\r\nrivers. Of the countless difficulties he encountered in his long and\r\npainful march, no one who is unfamiliar with the character of forest\r\nand plain in the tropics, particularly during the rainy season, can\r\nhave the faintest conception. They far transcend anything experienced\r\nby Stanley, or Mungo Park, or any other African explorer. After more\r\nthan three years of unheard-of sufferings, he finally returned to\r\nCoró with but a small fraction of the brave men that had originally\r\nformed part of his expedition.\r\n\r\nHohermuth was followed by Philip von Hutten, in 1541, on a similar\r\nexpedition, who traveled over almost the same ground as his\r\npredecessor. He, too, must have passed near where Buena Vista now\r\nstands. His undertaking was quite as fruitless as that of Hohermuth\r\nand his losses were greater. He spent more than four years in the\r\nllanos and Cordilleras and, before he could return to his starting\r\npoint, he died at the hands of an assassin.\r\n\r\nMore remarkable still, in some respects, was the expedition of\r\nNicholas Federmann, who, like Hohermuth and Von Hutten, was in the\r\nservice of the Welsers, concessionaires of a large German colony\r\nnear Lake Maracaibo. Crossing the llanos, and the numerous rivers\r\nthat flow through them, he eventually found himself on the banks\r\nof the Meta. Thence he proceeded west and crossed the Cordilleras,\r\nnot, however, without numerous victims--both men and horses--from the\r\nintense cold on the mountain summits. He finally reached the fertile\r\nplain of Bogotá, where occurred that famous and unexpected meeting\r\nof Belalcazar, who had come with another expedition from Quito, and\r\nGonzalo Jimenez de Quesada who, a short time previously, had arrived\r\nwith a third expedition from Santa Marta.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to know what was Federmann's itinerary after\r\nleaving the banks of the Meta, and the exact spot where he crossed the\r\nCordilleras. This we can only conjecture, as there is no record of it,\r\nbut we loved to think, while crossing the Andes on our way to Bogotá,\r\nthat we were still following the conquistadores, and that ours was\r\nthe same route that had been taken by Federmann and his brave men\r\nmore than three and a half centuries before. [171]\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Buena Vista, we were exposed to a heavy tropical downpour\r\nthat lasted the greater part of the day. Fortunately the rain did not\r\naffect us in the slightest. Our bayetones and waterproof boots kept\r\nus perfectly dry and, as the rain was not chilly, we rather enjoyed\r\nthe experience.\r\n\r\nOur path during the greater part of the day lay through forests and\r\nalong rivers and over mountain torrents. At times it was high up on the\r\nmountain side, thousands of feet above the water courses surging and\r\nfoaming at its base. Again it was along the edge of a dizzy precipice,\r\nwhere a single false step of our mule would have meant instant death\r\nto its rider.\r\n\r\nWhat gave us grave concern at first was the fact that our mules always\r\npersisted in keeping on the side of the track next to the ravine,\r\nno matter how deep or threatening it might be. We tried, until we\r\nwere exhausted, to keep them on the opposite side of the trail, but\r\nit was useless. They seemed bent on courting danger, and on seeing\r\nhow near they could keep to the verge of the chasm without plunging\r\ninto its abysmal depths.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for our peace of mind, we did not then know the Andean\r\nmule as well as we do now. Had we understood him as well at the\r\nbeginning of our journey as we did at the end, we should have given him\r\na free rein, and thereby spared ourselves many nerve-racking moments\r\nand many futile efforts to correct his persistent aberrations. Why\r\na mule prefers to walk on the brink of a precipice, whenever it has\r\nan opportunity of doing so, rather than keep to what we humans should\r\nconsider the safer side of the path, is a mystery I do not profess to\r\nfathom. I simply state the fact. I leave its explanation to experts\r\nin mule psychology.\r\n\r\nThe country through which we passed was fairly well populated, and we\r\nwere never long out of sight of a habitation of some kind. Sometimes\r\nthe dwellings were of stone, but more frequently they were of bamboo\r\ndaubed with clay and thatched with palm leaf. The people, usually\r\nIndians or half-breeds, were in humble circumstances but we never\r\nsaw any evidences of actual want or suffering. \"Nunca se muere de\r\nhambre aqui\"--No one ever dies of hunger here--an Indian woman once\r\ninformed us, when we made inquiry about the subject. If one should\r\nhappen to have nothing to eat, his friends and neighbors supply him\r\nwith food. They are ever willing to assist one another, and we were\r\noften surprised to see how ready they were to share their limited\r\nstore with others, whether in want or not.\r\n\r\nA more friendly people we never met than the good people who dwell\r\non the eastern slopes of the Colombian Cordilleras. They always\r\nhave a kindly greeting for every one they meet. No one, not even the\r\nyoungest child, will pass you on the road without a cordial \"Buenos\r\ndias,\" \"Buenas tardes,\" or \"Buenas noches\"--Good day, Good evening,\r\nor Good night--as the case may be. These cheering salutations, that\r\nwere always forthcoming, whether we met one or a score, young or old,\r\nmade us forget that we were in a foreign land, far from home and\r\nfriends, and quite reconciled us to any little discomforts we might\r\nexperience along our steep and rugged path. Here among these simple,\r\nunspoiled people the brotherhood of man is not an empty rhetorical\r\nphrase, or a vain poetical figment, but a living, every-day reality.\r\n\r\nHow often during our journeyings in the savannas and highlands of\r\nColombia did we not recall the beautiful couplet of Castellanos\r\nregarding the primitive inhabitants of New Granada!--\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"Gente llana, fiel, modesta, clara,\r\n        Leal, humilde, sana y obediente.\" [172]\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are the same to-day, especially when removed from the baleful\r\ninfluence of those who, instead of aiding them, would drag them down\r\nto the lowest depths of degradation and servitude.\r\n\r\nBut obliging and honest as we always found these people to be,\r\nthey, nevertheless, invariably failed us in one particular. We could\r\nnever, except occasionally by accident, get from them a correct or\r\nsatisfactory answer about the distance from one place to another.\r\n\r\nNever shall we forget our experience during our first day's journey\r\nin the Cordilleras. Our objective point was San Miguel, where we were\r\ntold we should find a good lodging house--one of the best on the road,\r\nwe were assured--and, as the distance was great, it was necessary to\r\nmake extra good time in order to arrive there before nightfall. The\r\nheavy, long-continued rains had made our trail extremely heavy, and\r\nin places almost impassable. The hours passed and we found ourselves\r\nadvancing much more slowly than was desirable. The lowering clouds\r\nwere massing on the mountain slopes, and the rain began to fall in\r\ntorrents. It then began to dawn upon us that we might not be able\r\nto reach our destination in the limited time yet remaining of the\r\nfast-departing day.\r\n\r\nFurther progress along our dangerous path in the impenetrable gloom,\r\nthat would immediately follow sunset, we knew to be impossible. We\r\nknew or thought we knew, about how far we were still from San Miguel,\r\nbut we wished to be certain about the distance.\r\n\r\nIt was now about four o'clock in the afternoon, and it was imperative\r\nfor us to reach our posada by six o'clock, if we were to arrive there\r\nat all that day. We accordingly inquired of one of the many peons we\r\nmet, who were returning to their homes from their day's labor in the\r\nfields, how far it was to San Miguel. \"Tres leguas, Señores\"--three\r\nleagues, Sirs--was the answer to our question.\r\n\r\nThis was disheartening. Our mules were now exhausted, and could not\r\npossibly make three leagues in two hours over the terrific track we\r\nwere traveling. But there was nothing to do but push on. At the end\r\nof an hour we asked the same question of another peon. \"Quatro leguas,\r\nSeñores\"--four leagues, Sirs, was the reply. This answer was confirmed\r\nby several other peons, whom we also questioned. Matters were becoming\r\nserious, but we continued on in silence, hoping against hope.\r\n\r\nAbout a half hour later we again renewed our query. \"Una legua,\r\nSeñores\"--one league, Sirs--said a bright boy, who was driving a\r\nheavily-laden donkey. It was now dusk, and as dusk in the tropics\r\nlasts but a few minutes, we knew that we should soon be enveloped in\r\ntotal darkness.\r\n\r\nA little further on, a woman, with a child in her arms, informed us\r\nthat San Miguel was \"cerca\"--near. This was too ambiguous for us, as it\r\nmight mean one league or several leagues. Asking her how near it was,\r\nshe replied muy cerca--very near. This was still unsatisfactory. She\r\nthen assured us that it was \"cerquita,\" \"cerquitita\"--diminutives\r\nof cerca-- [173] meaning that the place was extremely near, only a\r\nfew steps farther. \"Dando la vuelta de la esquina\"--around the corner\r\nthere--she said, \"is San Miguel, the second house you come to.\" Peering\r\ninto the darkness before us, we could barely discern what appeared a\r\nprojection from the mountain side. We had to be satisfied with this\r\nanswer as, try as we would, we could elicit nothing more definite\r\nfrom our informant.\r\n\r\nThe darkness was now so dense that we were unable to see even as far\r\nas our mules' ears. There was then nothing to be done but to give our\r\nanimals the rein and trust them to carry us to our destination. As\r\nif guided by a peculiar instinct, they carefully picked their way\r\nthrough the mud, but we thought they should never get around that\r\ncorner towards which we had been directed.\r\n\r\nWe were now quite exhausted, as we had eaten nothing since morning, and\r\nlonged for a place of shelter, where we could find repose. Only once\r\nbefore, in all my travels, did it seem to take so long to get around\r\na mountain spur. Years ago, in the mountains of the Peloponnesus,\r\nI had a similar experience, but then the road was good and the moon\r\nwas shining. Here there was only a wretched, dangerous trail, and it\r\nwas pitch dark.\r\n\r\nAt the long last, we saw a light glimmering in a hut by the\r\nroadside. This was something. The next house, which was said to be\r\nbard by, should be the long-desired San Miguel.\r\n\r\nTo reassure ourselves, we asked a woman who was standing at the door\r\nof the cot, where was San Miguel. She did not know. She had never\r\nbeard of such a place. It might be at the other side of the mountain,\r\nor we might already have passed it; she could not tell.\r\n\r\n\"But is there not a posada near here,\" I queried, \"or a place where\r\nwe can remain over night?\" \"Oh! yes,\" the woman replied, \"there is a\r\nvery good posada just across the road--that large building right in\r\nfront of you. You are looking for la Señora Filomena's house. That is\r\nwhat we call it here.\" And so it was. A few rods away was San Miguel,\r\nat last. Only the tired, famished traveler in a strange land can\r\nrealize how glad we were that the day's journey was finally at an end.\r\n\r\nWe spent a very uncomfortable night at San Miguel, and were glad\r\nwhen we found ourselves, early the following morning, again in the\r\nsaddle, bound for Caqueza, the capital of a district near the summit\r\nof the Cordilleras. \"We must make better time than yesterday,\" I\r\nsaid, on starting, to our vaqueano. \"Si, Señor.\" \"We shall arrive\r\nat Caqueza by four o'clock, shall we not?\" \"Es imposible, Señor. It\r\nis impossible, Sir.\" \"Well, then, we shall arrive by five, shall we\r\nnot?\" \"No se puede, Señor. It cannot be done, Sir.\" \"At all events,\r\nwe must reach Caqueza before dark.\" \"Tal vez, no--Probably not,\"\r\nwas his final reply, and we had to let it go at that.\r\n\r\nThe scenery along our route between San Miguel and Caqueza was much\r\nlike that which we had so much admired during the preceding day. The\r\ncountry was, however, much more thickly populated and we met many\r\nmore people on the way. There was always that same cordial greeting,\r\nthat had before touched us so deeply, and the same disposition to\r\noblige us in any way possible.\r\n\r\nAt one place on the roadside, we saw a young couple, neither more\r\nthan eighteen years of age, erecting a little bamboo cot. They were\r\nevidently just entering upon house-keeping, and seemed to be very\r\nhappy. The labor involved in the construction of their future home\r\nwas little and the expense was nothing. All would be in readiness\r\nfor occupancy in a day or two after work begun. Then their little\r\nplot of ground, planted with maize, yuca, plantains and bananas,\r\ntogether with a few domestic animals, would supply them with all the\r\nfood required and enable them to enjoy an idyllic existence far away\r\nfrom the maddening crowd, and quite removed from\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The weariness, the fever, and the fret\r\n    Here, where men sit and hear each other groan.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was evidently some such Arcadian scene that was before Tennyson's\r\nvision when he, in Locksley Hall, penned the beautiful lines,\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Ah, for some retreat,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Slides the bird o'er lustrous woodland, swings the trailer from\r\n    the crag--\"\r\n\r\n    \"Droops the heavy-blossomed bower, hangs the heavy-fruited tree--\"\r\n\r\n\r\nand where are\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Breaths of tropic shade and palms in cluster, knots of Paradise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther on we met another young couple, radiant with the glow of\r\nyouth and present happiness, carrying all their household goods with\r\nthem. These were few and simple. The man carried a machete, and a few\r\nrush mats; the woman a few simple culinary utensils consisting mainly\r\nof a metal pot and a few calabash cups and dishes. They were evidently\r\nlooking for a site for a home, and probably, a few hours later had,\r\nlike the first couple we saw, their simple habitation well under way.\r\n\r\nOf these good people one can repeat what Peter Martyr said of the\r\naborigines shortly after the discovery of America:\r\n\r\n\"A fewe thinges contente them, hauinge no delite in suche superfluites,\r\nfor the which in other places men take infinite paynes and commit\r\nmanie vnlawfull actes, yet are neuer satisfied, whereas many haue\r\nto muche, and none inowgh. But emonge these simple sowles, a fewe\r\nclothes serue the naked; weightes and measures are not needefull to\r\nsuch as cannot kyll of crafte and deceyte and haue not the vse of\r\npestiferous monye, the seede of unnumerable myscheues. So that if we\r\nshall not be ashamed to confesse the truthe, they seeme to lyue in that\r\ngoulden worlde of the whiche owlde wryters speak so much; wherin men\r\nlyued simplye and innocentlye without inforcement of lawes, without\r\nquarrellinge. Iudges and libelles, contente onely to satisfie nature,\r\nwithout further vexation for knowledge of thinges to come.\" [174]\r\n\r\nLater on in the day we came across more home-builders, but of\r\nquite a different kind from those above mentioned. Toward noon, we\r\nnoticed some distance ahead of us, what appeared to be a greenish\r\nblack ribbon, extended along our path. It was about a foot wide and\r\nseveral hundred feet long. We could not imagine what it could be\r\nuntil we were within a few yards of it. It proved to be an army of\r\nants on a foraging expedition. There were millions, if not billions\r\nof them. Those on one side were carrying pieces of leaves about\r\nthe size of a sixpence. They formed the green part of the ribbon\r\nthat we had seen from a distance. Those on the other side, moving\r\nin an opposite direction, constituted the black part. They were all\r\nengaged in getting material for thatching their curious dome-like\r\nhomes, which are often of extraordinary dimensions. Sometimes they\r\nare fully thirty or forty feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nWe regretted that time did not permit us to examine the length of\r\ntheir line of march, from their marvelous dwellings to the trees\r\nthey were stripping for roofing material. They have been known to go\r\na mile or more for material suited to their purpose and to deprive\r\nscores of trees of all their leaves in a single day.\r\n\r\nTo one unfamiliar with the tropics, the depredations committed by\r\nthese destructive insects appear incredible. Of an unknown number of\r\nspecies, they are among the greatest enemies of man in the equatorial\r\nregions. They spare nothing. Gardens and orchards, coffee and sugar,\r\ncassava and banana plantations disappear as quickly before them as\r\nbefore blight or frost.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the sixteenth century, according to Herrera,\r\n[175] their numbers in Española and Puerto Rico were so great and\r\ntheir devastations so extensive and irresistible, that they threatened\r\nto depopulate the islands. Various parts of South America have also\r\nat different times suffered from the same plague--rivaling the seven\r\nplagues of Egypt in the distress and destruction which marked their\r\npath. Had we not had here, and elsewhere in the tropics, ocular\r\nevidence of their prodigious numbers, and been witnesses of the\r\nmagnitude of the works due to their united efforts, we should have\r\nclassed the accounts left us by the early chroniclers of the extent\r\nof the ravages of the ant plague among works of fiction rather than\r\nrecords of authentic history. [176]\r\n\r\nThe scenery along the mountain ascent was an ever-changing panorama\r\nof rarest beauty and sublimity, such as no pen could describe or\r\nbrush portray. It exhibited all the tropical luxuriance of the\r\nllanos together with the wild picturesqueness characteristic of\r\nAlpine heights.\r\n\r\nAt times we wended our way along the banks of a noiseless river,\r\nwhich, in solitary grandeur, was sweeping through verdant meads and\r\nbeneath arcades of sylvan green, carrying its vivifying waves to the\r\nbroad, expectant plains below. The placid scene, dotted with human\r\nhabitations, and variegated by bright pastures, the home of contented\r\nflocks and herds, offered to the enchanted gaze, in a single picture,\r\nall the fabled beauties of the glens of Tempe and the dales of Arcady.\r\n\r\nAs we mounted higher up on our way, our route was along the verge of\r\ndeep, headlong torrents mantled in the shade of overhanging bamboos, or\r\nobscured by the jutting crags and huge beetling rocks of the earthquake\r\nrift mountain. Ever and anon, our ears caught the muffled but incessant\r\nroar of thunderous waterfalls, which plunged from dizzy precipices high\r\nabove our heads, both to the right and to the left of our upward path.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the deafening notes of these tumultuous floods, which\r\nawakened a thousand echoes in the sombre caves and yawning gulfs of\r\nthe countless windings and abrupt breaks of the mountain ravines,\r\ndied away, before we found ourselves in presence of some murmuring\r\ncascade that might well have adorned the grove around the grotto\r\nof Calypso. In the gleaming crystal basin at its foot, embowered in\r\nvernal bloom and eternal verdure, which diffused an aromatic breath\r\nover the passer-by, was tremulously reflected the plumed crown of the\r\npalm tree under which the weary traveler sought a moment's rest for his\r\nweary frame. At every turn in our steep and devious path, our eyes were\r\ndelighted by some wild, struggling brook, that fretted its way through\r\na labyrinthine gorge, pranked with verdurous gloom, or charmed by some\r\nwanton rivulet leaping over rocks or forming limpid pools, canopied\r\nwith foliage and flowers of rarest fragrance and brightest hue, that\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Forever gaze on their own drooping eyes,\r\n        Reflected in the crystal calm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not an exaggeration to say, that in our journey from the\r\nfoot to the summit of the Andes, we passed in rapid review some\r\nof earth's grandest and most entrancing prospects. Sometimes I was\r\nreminded of the mountains and valleys of the Alps, at others of the\r\npeaks and cañones of the Rocky Mountains. Some cataracts recalled the\r\nwaterfalls seen leaping from the lofty precipices of Alaska; others,\r\nthose that add such a charm to the manifold wonders of the Yosemite\r\nand the Yellowstone.\r\n\r\nBut the Andean views can always claim a superiority over all northern\r\nscenes of a similar character, in the marvelous setting afforded by\r\nthe ever-verdant and exuberant vegetation of the tropics. How often\r\ndid we not wish, during this memorable trip, that we could command\r\nthe brush of a Turner or a Poussin or a Claude Lorrain, in order to\r\nbring home with us copies of some of those wonderful pictures that\r\nNature exhibited to our admiring gaze in her great art gallery of\r\nthe Oriental Cordilleras!\r\n\r\nThe higher we ascended above the lowlands the less dense became\r\nthe forests and the less luxuriant the vegetation. At times there\r\nwere extended reaches of land that were quite treeless; at others\r\nthe surface of the soil was covered with scrubby growths that were\r\nin marked contrast with the splendid sylvan exhibitions to which we\r\nhad been so long accustomed. But although the giants of the forest\r\nwere no longer visible, there was little diminution of the splendor\r\nof the floral display along our path. In one place, particularly,\r\nwe were surprised beyond measure to find the whole side of a mountain\r\nspur covered with a glorious mantle of immaculately white lilies. The\r\nscene was not unlike one of the large lily fields of Bermuda, that\r\nsupply our Easter altars with their choicest decorations.\r\n\r\nWe were greatly delighted to find in the tropics representatives of the\r\nfeathered tribe that we were familiar with in the far North. Large\r\nflocks of them annually leave North America and Europe to spend\r\nthe winter season in South America and as regularly return to their\r\nnorthern homes the following summer. Some of them come from far-off\r\nAlaska and extend their flight as far south as Tierra del Fuego. Others\r\nspend the summer in southeast Siberia and then, on the approach of\r\nwinter, migrate by way of North America to South Brazil. Among the\r\nmost numerous of these marvelous birds of passage are certain species\r\nof sandpipers, plovers and lapwings. The bobolink, known along the\r\nChesapeake as the reedbird, and dreaded as the ricebird in the rice\r\nfields of the South, extends its migrations as far into South America\r\nas southeastern Brazil. Many of our familiar warblers and sparrows\r\nare to be seen during the winter months in Venezuela and Colombia,\r\nwhile certain cliff and barn swallows penetrate as far south as\r\nParaguay. On the Orinoco and the Meta, we recognized many species of\r\nducks that were familiar to us in the United States, among which were\r\nthe pin-tail, bald-pate, golden-eye and blue-winged teal.\r\n\r\n\"The plovers, sandpipers and kindred species,\" writes Knowlton, \"take\r\nmigratory journeys often of extraordinary length. Thus the American\r\ngolden plover, Charadrius dominicus, breeds in arctic America, some\r\nventuring a thousand miles north of the Arctic Circle, and migrates\r\nthrough the entire length of North and South America to its winter\r\nhome in Patagonia, and, curiously, its spring and fall routes are\r\ndifferent. After feasting on the crowberry in Labrador, they seek the\r\ncoast of Nova Scotia, where they strike out to sea, taking a direct\r\ncourse for the easternmost islands of the West Indies, and thence to\r\nthe northeastern coast of South America. In spring not one returns\r\nby this route, but in March they appear in Guatemala and Texas. April\r\nfinds their long lines trailing the prairies of the Mississippi Valley;\r\nthe first of May sees them crossing our northern boundary, and by the\r\nfirst week in June they appear in their breeding grounds in the frozen\r\nnorth. The little sanderling, just mentioned, is almost cosmopolitan\r\nin distribution, breeding in the arctic and sub-arctic regions and\r\nmigrating in the New World to Chile and Patagonia, a distance of\r\neight thousand miles, and in the Old World along the shore of Europe,\r\nAsia and Africa. The Bartramian sandpiper, Bartramia longicauda, nests\r\nfrom eastern North America to Nova Scotia and Alaska, and goes south\r\nin winter to southern South America. The solitary sandpiper, Totanus\r\nsolitarius, breeds mainly to the north of the United States, and\r\nwinters as far south as Brazil and Peru. The buff-breasted sandpiper,\r\nTryngites subruficollis, rears its young in the Yukon district of\r\nAlaska and from the interior of British Colombia to the Arctic coast,\r\nand journeys in winter well into South America. The turnstone, Arenaria\r\ninterpres, a little shore bird, about the size of the song thrush of\r\nEurope, is also cosmopolitan, breeding in high northern latitudes and\r\nat other times of the year found along the coasts of Europe, Asia,\r\nAfrica, North America, South America to the Straits of Magellan,\r\nAustralia and the Atlantic and Pacific islands. It is one of the\r\nspecies mentioned as making the wonderful flight from the islands in\r\nBering Sea to the Hawaiian Islands.\" [177]\r\n\r\nBy what miraculous instinct are they guided in these semi-annual\r\nmigrations across half the globe? Who bids them, asks Pope,\r\n\r\n\r\n                                \"Columbus-like, explore\r\n        Heavens not their own, and worlds unknown before?\r\n        Who calls the council, states the certain day.\r\n        Who forms the phalanx, and who points the way?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHave they a special \"sense of direction,\" or is their \"homing\" faculty\r\nor power of orientation, something that is tantamount to a sixth sense?\r\n\r\nWe now know far more about the migrations of birds than was known\r\nonly a few decades ago. We are able to locate many of them during the\r\nvarious seasons of the year, and are quite certain that they never,\r\nas an ingenious writer of the early seventeenth century maintained,\r\nspend the winter in the moon, where they have no occasion for food;\r\nbut we have yet much to learn regarding the causes of their periodic\r\nmigrations, and the nature of that instinct that enables them to pass,\r\nwith unerring precision, from the arctic to the antarctic regions,\r\nand from the Old World to the New. We are accumulating daily new\r\nfacts regarding the distant flights of the birds of passage, but,\r\nnotwithstanding the many theories, some of them more fantastic\r\nthan scientific, that have been advanced to explain the cause of\r\nthe migrations of birds; why such migrations were undertaken in the\r\nbeginning, why they are still continued, and how birds are able to\r\nfind their way, during their marvelous flights from the arctic to the\r\nantarctic--we are still in the dark about many questions connected\r\nwith those mysterious migrations, which have excited the interest\r\nof even the most casual observer since the prophet Jeremiah wrote:\r\n\"The stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed time; and the turtle and\r\nthe crane, and the swallows observe the time of their coming.\" [178]\r\n\r\nAlmost before we were aware of it, the sun had begun to paint the crest\r\nof the Andes with bright vermeil and soft purple, and we were still\r\nfar from Caqueza--the goal of our day's journey. With the exception\r\nof the half-hour we had tarried for luncheon at an attractive posada,\r\ncalled Media Luna, we had been in the saddle all day, and had pushed\r\nforwards as rapidly as the strength of our animals would permit. We\r\nhad left our vaqueano and peons in the rear early in the day, and it\r\nwas not at all likely that they would be able to reach Caqueza before\r\nthe following forenoon.\r\n\r\nAfter a delightful, sunshiny day, the sky, towards sunset, suddenly\r\nbecame overcast with dark, threatening clouds, and presently it\r\nbegan to rain. One thing, however, was in our favor, and that was the\r\ntrail. It was in a far better condition than that of the preceding\r\nday, but it lay along the breast of a precipitous mountain slope,\r\nat the foot of which, within ear-shot, coursed an impetuous mountain\r\ntorrent. The greater part of the way was quite safe, and we could\r\ntrust our mules, even in the dark, to keep to the path. But here and\r\nthere were treacherous places--loose ground, and landslides caused\r\nby recent rains--which rendered traveling, even in the daytime,\r\nsufficiently difficult. In the darkness, that was every moment becoming\r\nmore dense, locomotion was positively dangerous. There was no house\r\non the way in which we could find shelter for the night. Our tent,\r\nwith our other baggage, was in the hands of our dilatory peons. The\r\nonly alternatives, then, were pressing on to Caqueza, despite darkness\r\nand danger, or standing still in our trail, where there was not even\r\na shrub to temper the ever-increasing downpour. We elected to trust\r\nour lives again to our mules, as we had done the previous night. This\r\nseemed to be the lesser of the two evils that confronted us.\r\n\r\nWe then recalled the hesitating answer that our vaqueano had,\r\nin the morning, given to our query about reaching Caqueza before\r\nnightfall. His \"Tal vez, no\"--perhaps not, was a gentle prognostic\r\nthat it was impossible, at least for the baggage mules. As a matter\r\nof fact, they did not arrive until towards noon the next day. Their\r\nmules had given out, and the vaqueano and peons had to make shift to\r\nspend the night as best they could under an inclement sky.\r\n\r\nThe last objects of interest that we descried in the deepening\r\ngloom were a number of peasant cots perched high upon the mountain\r\nsides--much like so many cottages in the higher Alps--and the junction\r\nof two rivers--the Rio Blanco and the Rio Negro. The rivers specially\r\nattracted our attention, as the color of the waters of the one, the\r\nBlanco--white--was in such marked contrast with the waters of the\r\nother, the Negro or black river. The one owed its color to the white\r\nclay soil through which it passed. The other was rendered black--like\r\nthe well-known bog-tinctured, \"black waters\" of Ireland--by the\r\npresence of organic material. Even long after the waters of the\r\ntwo tributaries had entered their common channel, they kept quite\r\nseparate--the black flowing along one bank and the white along the\r\nbank opposite.\r\n\r\nIt would take too long to enumerate the many difficulties we\r\nencountered, during our long ride in the darkness, before we finally\r\narrived at Caqueza. Suffice to say that it was several long hours after\r\nnightfall, and that we were both quite exhausted, both by hunger and\r\nfatigue. We never felt time to pass so slowly, as during the last hour\r\nof the day's journey, when there was danger in every step forward from\r\nthe ever-threatening ravine, along the edge of which our path lay,\r\nand we were quite ready to exclaim with Shelley,\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"How like death-worms the wingless moments crawl.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the posada where we purposed spending the night, which was\r\nrecommended as the best in town, we found sufficient to appease the\r\npangs of hunger, but we were soon made to realize that we had another\r\nsleepless night before us. In San Miguel our quarters were damp and our\r\nblankets wet, owing to some carelessness on the part of our peons. In\r\nCaqueza the rooms assigned us--and particularly the beds--could best\r\nbe described by a single word--insectiferous. They were a veritable\r\ninsectarium that served no scientific or economic purpose. It is but\r\njust, however, to record that this was our first experience of the kind\r\nduring our journey thus far in the tropics. Under the circumstances,\r\nthere was nothing left for us to do except resignedly to exclaim\r\nwith the pious native--Sea por Dios--may it be received by God in\r\natonement for sin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nIN CLOUDLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"Knowest thou the track that o'er the mountain goes,\r\n        Where the mule threads its way through mist and snows,\r\n        Where dwell in caves the dragon's ancient brood,\r\n        Topples the crag, and o'er it roars the flood,\r\n        Knowest thou it well?\r\n                            O come with me!\r\n        There lies our road--oh, father, let us flee.\"\r\n\r\n                                                        --Mignon.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur plan, on leaving Villavicencio, was to reach Bogotá in three\r\ndays. This we could easily have accomplished, had there not been a\r\nmistake in the telegram ordering horses to be in readiness for us\r\non our arrival at Caqueza. The morning after arriving there, when we\r\ninquired for our mounts, we were surprised to learn that we were not\r\nexpected until a day later, and that it would not be possible for us\r\nto get animals until the following morning.\r\n\r\n\"Travelers usually take three days to make the trip from Villavicencio\r\nto Caqueza,\" said Sr. N., who was to furnish the horses, \"and I\r\ndid not think you would attempt to make such an arduous journey\r\nin two days. However, everything will be ready early to-morrow\r\nmorning. Besides a day's rest here, preparatory to crossing the paramo,\r\nwill do you no harm. Most people coming up from the llanos consider\r\nit necessary.\"\r\n\r\nNot desiring to remain longer in the insectarium, in which we had spent\r\nso wretched a night, we removed to an asistencia--boarding house--in\r\nanother part of the town. Here we found clean and comfortable quarters\r\nand had reason to congratulate ourselves on our involuntary detention\r\nin this interesting town. We were both quite jaded from the long ride\r\nof the previous day, and really needed some repose more than we at\r\nfirst realized.\r\n\r\n\"But why did we not,\" it may be asked, \"continue our journey through to\r\nBogotá on our mules? Are they not the best and surest-footed animals\r\nin the steep mountain trails?\"\r\n\r\nThe reply is best given in the words of our host at Villavicencio,\r\nSr. N.: \"It would never do for such distinguished travelers\r\nas you are--personas tan amables y tan honorables--to enter the\r\nnational capital on such lowly animals as mules. Only common people\r\ndo this. Custom here makes it de rigueur for people of the better\r\nclasses to travel on horseback. More than this. Our people usually\r\nsend word ahead to have a carriage meet them in the suburbs of Bogotá,\r\nas they do not care to enter the city even on horseback. Permit me\r\nto order a carriage to meet you at Santa Cruz, some distance this\r\nside of the capital.\"\r\n\r\nWe thanked him for his kind offer, but replied that, while we should\r\nbe glad to defer to the custom of the country, by exchanging our\r\nmules for horses, we should forego the usual formality of entering\r\nthe city in a carriage. We were simple, plain travelers and wished\r\nto remain such till the end of our journey.\r\n\r\nCaqueza, fully twenty-five miles from Bogotá, is the capital of a\r\ndistrict of the same name and, in location, is not unlike that of\r\nmany of the higher mountain towns of Colombia or Switzerland. It is\r\nsurrounded on all sides by beautiful mountain ridges and is about\r\nfive thousand and six hundred feet above sea level. The temperature\r\nat seven o'clock p. m., the day before our departure, was 72° F.,\r\nbut at no time during the day was it much higher. In temperature,\r\nelevation and the beauty of the surrounding mountains it is much\r\nlike Caracas, and when the long-projected railroad from Bogotá to\r\nthe llanos shall have been completed, it will become a commercial\r\ncentre of considerable importance. The climate is salubrious and as\r\nequable as that of Bermuda, and the town, counting about two thousand\r\ninhabitants, is just such a place as the traveler from the lowlands\r\nwould delight to tarry in, if he were always master of his own time.\r\n\r\nEarly the second morning after our arrival in Caqueza, we had\r\nbidden adieu to this interesting town and its hospitable people\r\nand were on our way to the crest of the Andes. Just outside of the\r\ntown we crossed the Rio Caqueza, over what looked like the Devil's\r\nBridge in ruins. Fortunately, we had grown quite accustomed to\r\nsuch shaky structures, although, in the beginning, we approached\r\nthem with the greatest misgivings. Near San Miguel, for instance,\r\nwe had to cross a raging torrent, in a dark, deep ravine, over what\r\nwas but the semblance of a bridge, that threatened every moment to\r\ncollapse. It was in reality nothing more than three logs laid side\r\nby side and covered with loose twigs and earth. It had no railings\r\nor balustrades at the sides, and the abutments at the two ends had\r\nbecome so loosened by the heavy rains that it seemed every moment on\r\nthe verge of tottering into the abyss below. Even our mules balked\r\nat the treacherous structure. However, after taking a good look at\r\nthe tumultuous Rio Negro, that was coursing through the wild gorge\r\nbeneath, and stretching their long ears toward the opposite bank,\r\nas if to determine thereby what chance there was of a successful\r\npassage, they finally ventured on the bridge, but it was with fear\r\nand trembling. And how light was their step and how they actually\r\nfelt their way until they reached terra firma! From that moment the\r\nmuch-abused mule rose high in our estimation. He may be obstinate, but\r\nhe instinctively avoids danger. And when he concludes to go forward,\r\nyou may be sure that the danger is more apparent then real. Subsequent\r\nexperience only confirmed us in the impression that we then formed\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nFrom the time we crossed the Rio Caqueza, our path was ever upward\r\ntowards cloudland. La cumbre--the summit--of the Andes, where we were\r\nto cross it, is about midway between Caqueza and Bogotá, and is nearly\r\na mile higher than the makeshift of a bridge over the Rio Caqueza.\r\n\r\nWe had left Caqueza only a few miles behind us when we found a large\r\nnumber of market women--young and old--on the road. They were mostly\r\nIndians, all carrying heavy burdens from seventy-five to a hundred\r\npounds, and, to our surprise, they were all en route to Bogotá. I\r\ndo not think we met one going to Caqueza. They were loaded down\r\nwith chickens, eggs, fruits and all kinds of garden produce for the\r\nBogotá market.\r\n\r\nBut think of carrying such burdens more than twenty miles, and that,\r\ntoo, over the lofty Cordilleras! And think, too, of the slight pittance\r\nthat was often to reward the expenditure of such energy! Nevertheless,\r\nall of these poor people seemed to be quite happy. They were constantly\r\nchatting and singing, as they trudged along the rough, stony path, and\r\nrarely stopped to rest. They were clad in a rough, dark-colored tunic,\r\nsomething like the peplum or chiton of the ancient Greeks. Most of them\r\nwere barefooted, although we saw some who wore alpargatas, a kind of\r\nsandal made from the fibres of the aloe, which flourishes everywhere\r\nin the uplands of Colombia. As in Mexico, so also here, this plant has\r\nfrom time immemorial furnished the natives many articles of daily use.\r\n\r\nWhat specially attracted our attention was the number of chickens\r\nand eggs these humble folks carried with them to the market. When\r\nwe observed this and noted the number of cattle, horses and other\r\ndomestic animals we had seen along our route, and the variety of\r\nfruits and vegetables that were under cultivation, we could not but\r\nrecall what Herrera has to say about the absence of these and other\r\nthings in pre-Colombian times.\r\n\r\n\"In the other hemisphere\" (America), he writes, \"there were no\r\ndogs, asses, sheep, goats, swine, cats, horses, mules, camels, nor\r\nelephants. They had no oranges, lemons, pomegranates, figs, quinces,\r\nmelons, vines, nor olives, nor sugar, wheat nor rice. They knew not\r\nthe use of iron, knew nothing of firearms, printing or learning. Their\r\nnavigation extended not beyond their sight; their government and\r\npolitics were barbarous. Their mountains and vast woods were not\r\nhabitable. An Indian of good natural parts being asked what was\r\nthe best they had got by the Spaniards, answered: The hen's eggs,\r\nas being laid new every day; the hen herself must be either boiled or\r\nroasted, and does not always prove tender, while the egg is good every\r\nway. Then he added: The horse and artificial light, because the first\r\ncarries men with ease and bears his burdens, and by means of the latter\r\n(the Indians having learned to make wax and tallow candles and oil),\r\nthey lived some part of the night! and this he thought to be the most\r\nvaluable acquisition from the white people.\" [179]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the arrival of the Spaniards in South America, there\r\nwere no domestic animals except the llama, the alpaca, the guinea\r\npig and the alco, and these were found only within the limits of the\r\nempire of the Incas.\r\n\r\nThere was a time, however, long anterior to the advent of\r\nEuropeans--during the Pleistocene epoch--when horses [180] and the\r\nlarger members of the camel tribe roamed over the vast plains of South\r\nAmerica, notably in the parts now known as Argentina and Southern\r\nBrazil. It was at this period, too, that flourished in the same\r\nregions those gigantic creatures, now extinct, known as the mylodon,\r\nthe ground sloth, the glyptodont, the mastodon, the toxodont and\r\npeculiar sabre-toothed tigers, vast quantities of whose remains have\r\nbeen found and carefully stored away in our museums. Not far toward\r\nthe west of us, at the Campo de los Gigantes [181] in the Savanna of\r\nBogotá--not to speak of those found in the bluffs along the valley\r\nof the Zulia--abundant fossil remains have been discovered of horses,\r\ntaxodonts, glyptodons, and megatheriums. It is, indeed, a remarkable\r\nfact that the South American continent, which has enriched the Old\r\nWorld with so many valuable medicinal and economic plants, has not\r\ngiven to it a single useful animal.\r\n\r\nAfter traveling some hours we reached Chipaque, an interesting mountain\r\ntown fully half a mile higher above sea level than Caqueza. Our\r\nattention was attracted by an unusually large and beautiful stone\r\nchurch, which was then undergoing repairs. A great bell, imported\r\nfrom Europe, had just been put in one of the towers. It was the gift\r\nof Gen. Reyes, then president of the republic, and the good people\r\nwere not only proud of their bell but were loud in their praises of\r\nthe generous donor.\r\n\r\nBut where did the money come from for the erection of such a noble\r\nstructure? The people all seemed very poor, and quite unable to\r\nkeep such an edifice in repair after its completion, not to speak of\r\nsupplying the means for building it. We frequently found ourselves\r\nasking this same question in other parts of South America, when\r\ncontemplating the large and beautiful ecclesiastical structures that\r\nare often met with where one should least expect to find them. The\r\nbuilders of them evidently belonged to those ages of faith that have\r\nbequeathed to us those marvels of architecture--the great cathedrals\r\nof Europe.\r\n\r\nSomething that always afforded us great comfort, and that was rarely\r\nfar away, after we left Villavicencio, was the telegraph line. For\r\nweeks we had been far away from it, and, in case of need, it could\r\nnot have been reached. It was then that we really felt that we were\r\nindeed a long way off from home and friends. To communicate with\r\nthem by letter would then have required the best part of a year,\r\nfor there was no regular postal service to which we could have had\r\nrecourse. With the friendly and willing telegraph ever near, it\r\nwas quite different. By its means we could, in a few hours at most,\r\nconvey a message to the most distant parts of the world.\r\n\r\nWhen leaving any given place in the morning our whole party--peons\r\nwith baggage, mules included--would be together. But it was not long\r\nuntil we were far in advance of the vaqueano and peons, whom we would\r\nnot again see until evening or, as it sometimes happened, until the\r\nfollowing morning. There was rarely any danger of losing our path,\r\nfor the simple reason that there was, as a rule, only a single path\r\nfrom one place to another. We had, therefore, nothing to do but to\r\nkeep to the trail. Occasionally, however, we would come to a point\r\nwhere it was necessary to choose between two diverging trails. Then\r\nit was that the telegraph line was an invaluable guide. We followed\r\nthe trail which it paralleled, and in so doing we never went astray.\r\n\r\nIt was now several months since we had received a letter from\r\nhome. We had not even seen a newspaper of any kind, and were,\r\nconsequently, in utter ignorance of what was occurring in the great\r\nand busy world we had left behind us. But strange as it may seem,\r\nthe traveler in Nature's wilds seems soon to grow indifferent to\r\nthe world's doings. Even those who at home consider the morning and\r\nevening papers indispensable necessities, seem to forget that there\r\nare such things. Nay, they even experience a sense of relief that\r\nthey have gotten beyond the reach of post and telegraph, and that,\r\nfor once in their lives, they can call their time their own. Indeed,\r\nthe absence of the daily paper, with its countless dispatches, far\r\nfrom being a privation, soon impressed us as a positive blessing.\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed a sense of freedom--the freedom of the child of the\r\nforest--we had never known before. We were beginning to see how easy\r\nit was to dispense with many things that are so often regarded as\r\nessentials to pleasure and comfort. If we had been unavoidably detained\r\nat some Indian encampment for a few months or found it necessary\r\nto tarry a year or so in one of the little bamboo cottages on the\r\neastern slope of the Andes, we should not have regarded it as an\r\nunmixed evil. Even as I pen these lines, I have a vivid recollection\r\nof a score of tiny cots along the Rio Negro and the Rio Caqueza, near\r\na purling brook or a musical cascade, shaded by palms and surrounded\r\nby smiling citrus trees, where it would be a delight to live and\r\ncommune with Nature at her best.\r\n\r\nI can fully sympathize with Waterton's longing for the wild and\r\nhis love of tropical life. Every lover of nature, who has spent\r\nsome time in the heart of the equatorial forests, is affected in\r\nthe same way. The wanderlust and abenteuergeist--the love of travel\r\nand adventure--grows on one, it seems, in the wilds of South America\r\nmore than elsewhere. Is it because the conquistadores and other early\r\nexplorers have impregnated the atmosphere with their spirit, or because\r\nthe environment of itself has the power of inoculating the visitor from\r\nthe north with the microbe of a life-long wanderleben? Dicant Paduani.\r\n\r\nRecording his impressions of travel in Andean highlands a writer in the\r\nearly part of the last century says: \"A sense of extreme loneliness\r\nand remoteness from the world seizes on his,\" the traveler's mind,\r\n\"and is heightened by the dead silence that prevails; not a sound\r\nbeing heard but the scream of the condor, and the monotonous murmur\r\nof the distant waterfalls.\" [182]\r\n\r\nThis, undoubtedly, like many similar impressions, is a question\r\nof temperament. As for ourselves we never, for a single moment,\r\nexperienced anything even approaching a feeling of loneliness or\r\nremoteness from the world. Probably, like Scipio Africanus, we are\r\namong those who never felt less alone than when alone. Far from\r\nfeeling lonely while crossing the Cordilleras, we congratulated\r\nourselves that we were far away from the beaten track of personally\r\nconducted tourists.\r\n\r\nWe could not help comparing the splendid panoramas around us\r\nwith the noted show places of Switzerland. In the Andes it was the\r\nforest primeval, or the humble cot, or the picturesque village of the\r\nunspoiled and simple people of eastern Colombia, where a foreigner is\r\nrarely seen, but where he is always sure of a cordial welcome. There\r\nwere here no tourist resorts, no palatial hotels or restaurants,\r\nno sumptuous chalets or villas--seats of opulence and luxury--but\r\nNature alone in all her beauty and sublimity, as she came forth from\r\nthe hands of her Creator. We were far away from the land of inclined\r\nrailroads, leading to every peak, and from macadamized thoroughfares,\r\nalong which reckless drivers and wild chauffeurs are constantly\r\nclaiming the right of way, regardless of the safety or convenience\r\nof the ordinary wayfarer.\r\n\r\nThe uplands of the Andes should be the last places in the world\r\nwhere the thoughtful mind should experience a sense of loneliness,\r\nor be oppressed with tedium or listlessness. There, if anywhere, such\r\na thing as ennui should be impossible. There is so much to excite the\r\nimagination, and so much to gratify every sense, so much to exhilarate\r\nthe weary spirits and to elevate the mind, that one feels oneself\r\nin a kind of mountain elysium, where every moment spent is one of\r\nunalloyed delight.\r\n\r\nNever shall we forget the morning preceding our first crossing of\r\nthe Cordilleras. The weather was ideal--neither hot nor cold--and\r\nthe scenery at every turn was magnificent beyond compare. While the\r\nvegetation was quite different in character from that of the lowlands,\r\nit was, nevertheless, equally attractive and fragrant. Our route at\r\ntimes lay through a narrow defile with wild beetling steeps on both\r\nsides of us. Ever and anon we passed by natural bowers, sculptured in\r\nthe solid rock and entwined with odorous plants and flowers, that might\r\nwell serve as trysting places of fays and elves, or be the favorite\r\nresorts of Titania and Oberon. Farther on our way we descried a dark\r\nand romantic chasm which we could fancy might, under a waning moon,\r\nbe haunted \"by a woman waiting for her demon lover.\" And higher up\r\non a lofty peak, tinged with the roseate hues of quivering sunlight,\r\nC.'s fancy told us was the home of that race of Oreads\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"That haunt the hill-tops nearest the sun.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Small wonder,\" said C, \"that the lively fancy of the Indian\r\nshould have peopled these romantic spots with the creatures of his\r\nimagination, and that he should have woven legends about objects\r\nand phenomena that had specially attracted his notice. Even we, who\r\nsee these things for the first time, find ourselves under the spell\r\nof the genius loci. Considering the beautiful arbors here formed\r\nby tree and vine and flower, the fantastic shapes assumed by rock\r\nand mountain spur, the mysterious natural phenomena that frequently\r\nobtrude themselves on his attention, and his proneness to refer to\r\nsupernatural agency everything that his untutored mind is unable to\r\nexplain, it would be a greater wonder if such legends did not exist,\r\nand if the numerous physical features, that have so often excited\r\nour interest, were left unpeopled by creatures of the Indian's fancy.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indian of Colombia may know nothing of our elves and fairies;\r\nsylphs, undines and salamanders; gnomes, kobolds and hobgoblins,\r\nbut his fertile imagination has, nevertheless, found similar beings\r\nto people plain and forest and mountain peak. Now, as in the days of\r\ntheir pre-Colombian ancestors, the Indian loves to regard stones and\r\nrocks and trees of peculiar form or extraordinary size as the abode of\r\ncertain spirits, or as being in some way identified with them. Like\r\nthe Scandinavians of old, they see their deceased ancestors in the\r\ndense clouds that veil the neighboring hill tops. And like the peasant\r\nin the Hartz mountains, who has a superstitious dread of the spectre\r\nof the Brocken, they quail before a similar apparition frequently\r\nseen in the summits of the Cordilleras. They venerate the rainbow,\r\nand see in volcanoes the abode of beings of power and destruction.\r\n\r\nTo them, as to peoples of other parts of the world, the owl is a bird\r\nof ill omen. One of them, called from its cry ya acabo, ya acabo--it is\r\nfinished, it is finished--is, when heard fluttering around the house,\r\nregarded as a harbinger of death. Another, the pavita, is considered\r\nas the spirit of some departed relative who, like the Irish banshee,\r\nwould warn his kindred against death or some imminent calamity.\r\n\r\nThe Llaneros, fearless as they are in most respects, entertain the\r\ngreatest dread of espantos, ghosts or apparitions. The bola de fuego,\r\nor the light of Aguirre, the Tyrant, is one of these ghosts. It is\r\nin reality nothing more than a kind of ignis fatuus, produced by\r\nthe decomposition of organic matter, but to their minds, ignorant\r\nof the true nature of such gaseous exhalations, it is the soul of\r\nthe infamous traitor, Lope de Aguirre, who, in punishment for his\r\natrocities, has been condemned to wander through the broad forests\r\nand savannas that were the witnesses of his blood-stained crimes.\r\n\r\nIn their duendes, if they have not the analogues of pucks and brownies,\r\nthey certainly possess a shrewd and knavish sprite, somewhat like\r\nthe English Robin Good-Fellow. Among the Llaneros he is noted for the\r\nmischievous pranks he plays in the corrals, when occupied by horses\r\nand cattle, and, if one is to credit the stories of those who live\r\non the plains, these particular duendes give the owners of live stock\r\na world of trouble.\r\n\r\nThe Serranos--mountaineers--have even more wonderful stories to tell\r\nthan the inhabitants of the llanos. The most remarkable of them are\r\nconnected with certain caves, which are so numerous in the Eastern\r\nAndes, and certain lakes in which, the Serrano assures one, are\r\noccasionally observed phenomena of an extraordinary character.\r\n\r\nThey are firmly convinced, for instance, of a certain witch or\r\nmalignant sorceress, called Mancarita, who carries away lonely\r\ntravelers, or those who may have lost their way in the mountains. And\r\nthey rehearse the tale of an Indian who concealed a bag of silver\r\nunder a certain water fall near a well-known lake. This is guarded by\r\na serpent or a dragon, but if one will, on St. John's day, travel in a\r\nstate of complete nudity, the paramo of Novagote from one end to the\r\nother, he will be able to get possession of the hidden treasure. In\r\nall these legends, and there are many of them, the Indian has as\r\nmuch faith as have the children of the North in the fairy stories\r\nthey hear in the nursery.\r\n\r\nThen there is that \"strange, harrowing, long-drawn cry, human in\r\nits tones,\" alleged sometimes to be audible in the depths of the\r\ntropical forests, for which no satisfactory explanation has as yet\r\nbeen given. The Indians say it is \"The Cry of a Lost Soul.\" The poet\r\nWhittier refers to it in the following verses:--\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"In that black forest where, when day is done,\r\n\r\n        A cry as of the pained heart of the wood,\r\n        The long, despairing moan of solitude\r\n        And darkness and the absence of all good,\r\n        Startles the traveller with a sound so drear,\r\n        So full of hopeless agony and fear,\r\n        His heart stands still, and listens with his ear.\r\n        The guide, as if he heard a death-bell toll,\r\n        Crosses himself, and whispers, 'A Lost Soul.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of their stories, however, seem to have some foundation in\r\nfact. Almost every paramero--inhabitant of the paramo--has a story\r\nto tell about seeing lightning or hearing thunder issue from certain\r\nlakes or wells as he was passing by on a clear night when there was\r\nnot the slightest indication of rain or storm. At such times the\r\nwaters of the lake may become violently agitated without any apparent\r\ncause. One's vaqueano, on being asked the reason of such a phenomenon,\r\nsimply replies, \"Está brava la laguna,\" or \"Truena la laguna--the\r\nlake is disturbed, or thunders.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indian's answer explains nothing, but the phenomenon seems to lend\r\nitself to an explanation which is as simple as it is natural. If we\r\nsuppose these lakes, as we well may, to be in the craters of extinct\r\nvolcanoes, in the bottoms of which, owing to slight earth tremors,\r\nrents are made in the rocks that permit the escape of imprisoned\r\ngases, the mystery is at least partially solved. The escape of gas,\r\nin large quantity under great pressure, would account for the violent\r\nagitation of the water. If these gases should become ignited by the\r\naction of the electricity with which, as we have learned, the summits\r\nof the mountains are often very highly charged, we should have in\r\nthe flash of the ignited gas what the Indian takes to be lightning,\r\nand in the resulting explosion what he thinks is thunder.\r\n\r\nI suggest this view merely as a tentative one, and hope that the\r\nphenomena in question, like those referred to in chapter nine regarding\r\nthe luminous displays in the mountain summits, may eventually receive\r\nan explanation that men of science will accept as conclusive. But\r\nwhile awaiting the final word of empirical science regarding these,\r\nand similar mysterious manifestations of nature, we may, with the\r\nsimple Indian, give free rein to our fancy and people the cascades\r\nand lakes, caverns, forests and colossal rock masses with all kinds\r\nof preternatural beings and invest them with the most extraordinary\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nTo be frank, we were not sorry to get away from the atmosphere of\r\nscience, and find a land where the legends and traditions of the\r\npeople were akin to those that were the delight of our childhood. For,\r\nmuch as we love science, we have never been willing to renounce the\r\npleasure of indulging our imagination, as we did in years long gone by,\r\nwhen the fairy tale and the myth so captivated our youthful mind. We\r\nconfess it freely, we were glad to be among the simple, primitive\r\npeople of the Andes, and were deeply interested in their peculiar\r\nfolklore. It afforded us, in another form, the pleasure we derived\r\nfrom our first acquaintance with the creations of Homer, Hesiod and\r\nOvid; and with such productions as the Niebelungen Lied, Sakuntala,\r\nthe Knights of the Round Table and Cid Campeador. All the science,\r\nhistory and philosophy in the world could not diminish the pleasure\r\nwe still find in these creations of fancy. We cherish them as much,\r\nif not more, to-day, as we did when they first became a part of\r\nour intellectual life. For this reason, if for no other, the reader\r\nwill conceive our unalloyed delight in being beyond the reach of the\r\nreports of physical and psychological laboratories, wherein nothing is\r\nadmitted that has not the imprimatur of Baconian science or Comtian\r\nphilosophy, both of which lay an absolute interdict on all the most\r\ncharming creations of poetry and romance.\r\n\r\nThe vista towards the east, as we finally drew near the cumbre--the\r\nlong desired summit of the Andes--was beautiful in the extreme. Below\r\nus, to the right and to the left, were a succession of mountain ridges,\r\nsome still forest-covered, while others exhibited the smiling gardens,\r\nverdant pastures and humble dwellings of the inhabitants. Here and\r\nthere was a picturesque little village of white-washed stone houses\r\nin place of the bamboo dwellings of the llanos and foothills. On all\r\nsides were multitudinous streams and torrents, that had their birth in\r\nthe snow fields and ice pinnacles of the highest points of Sumapaz,\r\nand which were vying with one another in their long race for the\r\nbroad emerald plains of Casanare and San Martin.\r\n\r\nAbove was the clear sapphire-blue sky, save where it was flecked by\r\nfantastic fleeces of glimmering clouds that floated voluptuously among\r\nthe lofty peaks of the Cordilleras, and mantled them, in passing, with\r\ntheir quivering vapors. Then, as if by enchantment, all was changed\r\nwith a suddenness that was positively startling. We had reached the\r\nlimit of the alisios--trade winds--for the Andes form a rampart which\r\nthey never pass. Here they are forced to part with the last drop of\r\nthe moisture that they have brought from the distant Atlantic. But,\r\non the occasion of our passage, they seemed determined to make one last\r\ndesperate effort to cross the rock-ribbed barrier. As if marshaled by\r\nÆolus himself, the bright, white, cumulous clouds, those fair flocks of\r\nthe west wind, were in a moment transformed into dark, ominous nimbi.\r\n\r\n\"Terrible, strange, sublime and beauteous shapes,\" which, gathering\r\ntheir forces, dashed with the fury of the hurricane against the\r\nadamantine crest of the Cordilleras. The tempest lasted but a few\r\nminutes, and then all was as bright and serene as before, and, if\r\nanything, more radiantly beautiful.\r\n\r\nHere, in a region empyreal, far away from the noise and turmoil of\r\nour marts of commerce, we breathed an air of purity, and experienced\r\na sense of freedom that are unknown in the dank, foul and malarial\r\natmosphere in which so many struggling millions pass the greater part\r\nof their wretched lives. But above all, what most impresses one in\r\nthese ethereal heights is the sense of the proximity of God. We could\r\nalmost fancy some one breathing into our ear the words of Tennyson:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Speak to Him thou, for He hears, and Spirit can meet--\r\n    Closer is He than breathing, and nearer than hands and feet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTraveling from the foothills to the summit of the Cordilleras is like\r\ngoing from the equator to the arctic circle. One has every variety of\r\nclimate peculiar to the torrid, temperate and frigid zones, and the\r\nfauna and flora vary with the altitude as they change with the climate.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the Andean regions have long recognized three\r\ndistinct climates, known as those of the tierra caliente--hot land;\r\nthe tierra fría--cold land; and the paramo. Men of science have, for\r\nthe sake of convenience, added a third climate, that of the tierra\r\ntemplada, or temperate land. The altitudes at which these climates\r\nare found vary with the latitude and with certain meteorological\r\nconditions, but in Colombia and near the equator they are quite fixed\r\nand accepted as fair approximations to the truth.\r\n\r\nTierra caliente embraces a zone extending from sea level to a line\r\none thousand meters higher up. It is pre-eminently the land of palms,\r\nceibas and milk trees; of totumos and tamarinds, of the vanilla and\r\nipecacuanha; the algarroba and white cedar; the sarrapia--Dipteryx\r\nodorata--and the poisonous curare--strychnos toxifera--from which\r\nthe Indians make the deadly compound that renders their arrows such\r\ncertain messengers of death. It is also the favorite zone for many\r\ntropical fruits such as plantains, bananas, mameys, nisperos, mangos,\r\nzapotes, oranges, lemons, pineapples, and scores of others found only\r\nin the lowlands of the equinoctial regions.\r\n\r\nThe upper limits of the tierra caliente are indicated by the\r\ndisappearance of the cacao tree and certain plants that do not flourish\r\nat an altitude beyond one thousand meters above sea level. The tierra\r\ncaliente and the tierra templada are connected by such well-known\r\nplants and trees as sensitive mimosas, bamboos, cinchonas and tree\r\nferns, although these representatives of the vegetable world do not\r\nattain their full importance until higher altitudes are reached.\r\n\r\nThe tierra templada comprises a zone extending from one thousand\r\nto twenty-four hundred meters above sea level. It is in the lower\r\npart of this zone that the bamboo, the most delicate and graceful\r\nof tropical plants, attains its greatest development and gives its\r\ngreatest charm to the landscape.\r\n\r\nThe numerous plants, shrubs and trees of the bean and myrtle families\r\nare seen at their best in the lower half of the tierra templada. It is\r\nhere, too, that one meets with the largest and most beautiful specimens\r\nof tree ferns. So gigantic, indeed, are they that at a distance they\r\nare easily mistaken for a moriche palm. Only in the islands of the\r\nPacific have I ever seen anything to compare with them in size and\r\nluxuriant loveliness.\r\n\r\nIn this zone the cultivation of coffee replaces that of cacao in\r\nthe zone below. I have never seen larger or finer berries anywhere\r\nthan we found on the shrubs grown on the eastern declivity of the\r\nCordilleras near San Miguel. And yet, strange to relate, only a\r\nshort distance from this spot, we found it impossible to get a cup\r\nof coffee, although we asked for it at several places. There was\r\nchocolate and chicha in abundance, but no coffee, where it would be,\r\none would think, the most common beverage. Its absence here reminded\r\nus of the difficulty we found in getting a calabash of milk on the\r\ngreat cattle farms of the llanos.\r\n\r\nAt twelve hundred meters above sea level the palm family begins to\r\nlose its importance, although graceful representatives continue to\r\ncharm the traveler until he reaches much higher altitudes. But one\r\nis, in a measure, reconciled to the disappearance of palms, that\r\nso delighted one in the lowlands, by the marvelous display made on\r\nall sides by countless species of the convolvulus and gesnerwort\r\nfamilies. Nothing can exceed their exuberance, or their gay and\r\nbrilliant flowers, as they mantle the shrubbery by the wayside or\r\npeep out from under the forest trees along one's path.\r\n\r\nThe flora comprehended in the zone extending from eighteen to\r\ntwenty-four hundred meters above the sea is in reality transitional in\r\nits nature, and partakes of the character of both that of the tierra\r\ntemplada and the tierra fría. The various species of cinchona render\r\nthis zone notable, for it is here and in the tierra fría that was\r\nformerly obtained most of the quinine of commerce.\r\n\r\nTierra fría extends from twenty-four hundred to three thousand meters\r\nabove sea level. Its vegetation, as would be expected, is entirely\r\ndifferent from that of the hot plains and temperate valleys of the\r\nlowlands. One no longer sees the elegant forms of the plantain and\r\nthe bamboo, nor the majestic palm and ceiba, nor the graceful and\r\nflexible bejucos and creepers of hotter climes. But, notwithstanding\r\nthe absence of all these charming representatives of Flora, it cannot\r\nbe said of the vegetation of tierra fría that it is either poor or\r\ndevoid of importance. Its dark hardy foliage, may, if you will, give\r\nit the impress of solemnity and melancholy, but the herbs, shrubs\r\nand trees are remarkable, not only for the number of their species,\r\nbut also for the beauty of their inflorescence and the variety and\r\nimportance of their products. Here flourish the noble red cedar and\r\nthe white caoutchouc tree that supplies to commerce the highly valued\r\nrubber known as the Virgen del Para.\r\n\r\nThe products of our northern lands, such as wheat, barley and potatoes,\r\nand such fruits--all of foreign origin--as the peach, pear, cherry\r\nand apple, together with a number of valuable garden vegetables,\r\nare cultivated in this zone, and with marked success.\r\n\r\nThe most important, and in some respects the most remarkable plant of\r\nthe tropics is Indian corn--zea mais. It is cultivated in all the zones\r\nfrom the hot plains of tierra caliente to the upper regions of tierra\r\nfría and constitutes, in one form or another, the chief food-supply of\r\nthe inhabitants. There is, however, a striking difference in the time\r\nrequired for the plant to reach maturity at the different altitudes. In\r\nthe hot climates it is often ready for the harvest in two months\r\nafter planting--when several crops a year are obtainable--whereas in\r\nthe cold uplands it requires nearly a year to mature.\r\n\r\nAll the land between the tierra fría and the region of perpetual snow\r\nis called the paramo. It corresponds to the puna of Peru, Bolivia\r\nand Northern Chili. In some parts of Colombia the paramos are bleak,\r\ntreeless plains, often enveloped in dark, cold fogs, or swept by keen\r\nblasts of almost arctic severity. In other parts, they are covered\r\nby a hardy Alpine vegetation, together with grasses and mosses of\r\ndifferent species. The most interesting growths are strange-looking\r\nferns and the woolly Frailejon--Espeletia grandiflora--which Sievers\r\nwell designates as the character-plant of the paramos. The name,\r\nFrailejon, signifies a big monk, and was given the plant by the\r\ninhabitants on account of the fancied resemblance of its felt-like\r\ncovering to a monk's hood. It is usually from six to eight feet high,\r\nbut it frequently attains a much greater altitude. It is one of those\r\nodd forms of vegetation that once seen are never forgotten.\r\n\r\nNo mere account, however, of the wonderful changes witnessed in\r\npassing from lower to higher altitudes can give any idea of the\r\neffect produced on the traveler. Every hour--yea, every minute--on\r\nhis upward journey, he is greeted by new forms of vegetable life\r\nand must needs at the same time bid farewell to others that may not\r\naccompany him beyond their own proper zones. But, although Flora's\r\nchildren are ever changing, they are always beautiful and it would\r\nbe difficult for the botanist to say where they challenge the most\r\nadmiration--in the hot plains of the Orinoco and the Meta or high up\r\non the cheerless and inhospitable paramo.\r\n\r\nWhat we found most astonishing in our three-days journey from the\r\nllanos to the crest of the Cordilleras was the extraordinary number and\r\ndiversity of forms of plant life. While we, in our northern woodlands,\r\ndo well if we can find a score of different species of trees in the\r\nspace of a square mile, we may, within the same limits in a tropical\r\nforest, count species by the hundred. Every few rods, on our way from\r\nVillavicencio to the cumbre of the Andes, we noted the appearance\r\nof some new species of plant, shrub or tree; some strange vine or\r\nepiphyte; some fruit or blossom which we had not observed before.\r\n\r\nGreat as were the physical and meteorological changes observable\r\nbetween the tierra caliente and the paramo, those of the vegetable\r\nworld were still greater. At times, during our rapid ascent from\r\nlower to higher altitudes, from llanos to paramo, the changes in\r\nspecies were so rapid and kaleidoscopic, the transitions so sudden\r\nand unexpected, that our brains were in a whirl and we had to give\r\nup in despair the attempt to keep anything approaching a record of\r\nthe order of sequence of the countless vegetable forms encountered\r\nalong our path. Considering solely the successive changes in flora\r\nand temperature, our experience in climbing the Cordilleras was like\r\nthat which would result from a three-days journey overland from the\r\nsultry valley of the Amazon to the gold-bearing strands of the Yukon\r\nor to the distant shores of the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nIt was a little after midday when we finally reached the paramo of\r\nChipaque--that dread paramo of which we had so frequently heard so\r\nmany and so extraordinary tales. It was, we had been told, a place\r\nof eternal frost and snow, and of blasts so tempestuous that both\r\nmen and animals were sometimes picked up bodily and hurled into a\r\nyawning gorge near the dizzy height which we were obliged to pass. We\r\nsoon discovered, however, that most of the stories we had heard of\r\nthis and similar paramos, had but little foundation in fact, or were\r\ngreatly exaggerated. [183]\r\n\r\nTo begin with, we found neither frost nor snow. As a matter of\r\nfact, snow rarely falls in this paramo. All about us there was an\r\nabundance of vegetation that little comported with the region of\r\narctic temperature. We found there a number of peasants' huts and a\r\nlarge drove of cattle, that were on their way from the llanos to the\r\nBogatá market. It took them more than two weeks to make a journey\r\nthat we had made in three days. But both the cattle and their\r\ndrivers--vaqueros--were more sensitive to cold than we were. For\r\nthis reason, they had to proceed slowly to accustom themselves to\r\nthe lower temperature and the higher altitude. The peasants living\r\non the paramo, although lightly clad, did not seem to be affected\r\nby the cold. The vaqueros, however, who had come from the lowlands,\r\nseemed to suffer greatly. But no wonder. They made no provision for so\r\ngreat a change of climate. They wore the same light garments--probably\r\nthey had nothing else--in crossing the Cordilleras, that they had\r\nused in the ever-heated llanos. It was not strange, then, that they\r\nshould give exaggerated accounts of the cold of the paramo or of the\r\nsuffering it induces. It would be surprising if it were otherwise.\r\n\r\nIt requires less than half an hour to cross the paramo--so limited is\r\nit in area--and reach the Boquerón [184]--the name given the short\r\nartificial cut, only a few rods in length--through the crest of the\r\nAndes. At this highest point our thermometer registered 48° F., and\r\nthe aneroid, a fine compensated instrument, indicated an altitude of\r\nten thousand five hundred and sixty feet. This is but little higher\r\nthan Leadville, Colo., and considerably lower than some of the railway\r\npasses over the Rocky Mountains. The temperature, owing to the light\r\natmosphere, was so mild, that we did not even think of throwing our\r\nponchos over our shoulders, as a protection from the cold that the\r\npoor Llanero felt so keenly.\r\n\r\nAs we were passing through the Boquerón we were joined by a young\r\nhacendado who had a cattle farm in the neighborhood. After a friendly\r\ngreeting he remarked, \"Está sumamente fría\"--It is extremely cold. And\r\nthen, thinking we were too lightly clad, he said almost pleadingly,\r\n\"Cubranse con sus bayetones, otramente se saca una pulmonia.\" Put on\r\nyour bayetones, otherwise you will get pneumonia. Then he related\r\nhow, the preceding year, he had crossed this pass in a snow storm,\r\ncontracted pneumonia, was confined to his bed for months, and barely\r\nescaped a premature death.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus addressing us, a number of Llaneros passed by\r\non their way from Bogotá to their homes in the warm plains near\r\nVillavicencio. In addition to the usual covering for the head they\r\nhad their ears and face protected by a kind of kerchief and seemed to\r\nsuffer more from the cold than our hardy northerners would in a Dakota\r\nblizzard. Poor fellows! We pitied them. They were shivering, their\r\nteeth were chattering and they were evidently in great distress. But\r\nthe reason was manifest at a glance. Aside from their head gear, they\r\nhad nothing on except a pair of short trousers of flimsy material and\r\na light poncho. They were barefooted, and, to judge from their wan and\r\npinched features, they were suffering from hunger as well as from cold.\r\n\r\nWe had now discovered the origin of the reports so generally accepted\r\nas true in the llanos, regarding the intense cold of the paramos\r\nand of the various Andean passes. Those poor, shivering, ill-clad,\r\nhalf-famished peons explained all. The same causes evidently\r\noperated in occasioning the great mortality suffered by Bolivar's\r\narmy when it passed, in 1819, from the llanos of the Apure to the\r\naltiplanicies--high tablelands--of New Granada. [185]\r\n\r\nThe paramo of Pisva, through which the Republican army invaded the\r\nenemy's country, is less than thirteen thousand [186] feet above sea\r\nlevel, and the passage, therefore, of the Cordilleras, at this point,\r\nwas not in itself the difficult undertaking it is so often represented\r\nto have been. The frightful loss of life, usually attributed to the\r\nintense cold of Pisva Pass, was, in reality, due to the fact that\r\nBolivar's followers were not properly prepared for the campaign in\r\nwhich they were engaged. They were half-naked and half-starved and\r\nthe wonder is that the hapless army did not suffer far greater losses\r\nthan those actually recorded.\r\n\r\n\"The army endured many sufferings in the passage of the paramo,\"\r\nwrites Vergara y Velasco, \"but it is a grave error to compare\r\nthem with those incurred in the passage of the Alps by Hannibal\r\nand Napoleon or in the passage of the Chilean Andes by San Martin,\r\nfor in Pisva there is no snow, neither is the altitude so great as\r\nthat of many frequented places in our Cordilleras. The expedition,\r\nwithout having the romance of the others, nevertheless equals them\r\nin results and for the same reason--the ineptitude of the enemy.\" [187]\r\n\r\nThe first thing that attracted our attention, on reaching the western\r\nend of the Boquerón, was the large number of flowers, of divers\r\nspecies, that bedecked both sides of our path. They constituted a\r\ncarpet of the most brilliant hues that, with a lovely green boscage,\r\nextended to the very summit of the mountain crest. In form and beauty\r\nthey were not unlike the charming blooms that gladden our forests\r\nand meadows in May and June. There was this difference, however,\r\nthat the number of species in a given space was far greater than is\r\never found in the same space in our northern climes. Does this close\r\njuxtaposition of so many species in the tropics contribute to the\r\nmore rapid formation of varieties and new species than is possible in\r\nhigher latitudes, where species are fewer and more widely separated\r\nfrom one another? It would seem so.\r\n\r\nWe shall never forget the panorama that burst upon our vision as we\r\nmade our exit from the Boquerón. It was in such marked contrast with\r\nthe view which we had so much admired on the eastern side. On the east\r\nside all was verdure, bloom, and grateful shrubbery, with occasional\r\nclumps of trees. On the western declivity, with the exception of a\r\nnarrow reach, already mentioned, near the mountain crest, all was as\r\ntreeless and as bare and arid as the sandy plains of Nevada or Arizona.\r\n\r\nBut the entire western slope and distant plateau was bathed in bright\r\nsunshine. Not a single cloud flecked the azure canopy above us, and not\r\na single sound, except the muffled footsteps of our horses, disturbed\r\nthe quiet and serenity of our exalted outlook. We were standing on\r\nthe crest of the Eastern Cordillera--the range to which the people\r\nof the country have long given the poetical name of Suma Paz--Supreme\r\nPeace. [188] Owing to its proximity to the capital, where it is always\r\nin view, it doubtless impressed the popular fancy more than did the\r\nmore distant, although loftier and more imposing, snow-capped masses of\r\nRuiz and Tolima. Seen from Bogotá, this beautiful range, when tinged\r\nwith the golden crimson rays of the setting sun, might well appear\r\nas an Olympus, the abode of the gods in the enjoyment of eternal peace.\r\n\r\nThere are some geographers who contend that the Cordillera of Suma\r\nPaz is the continuation of the principal chain of the Andes, but, as\r\nit terminates in the adjoining Republic of Venezuela, it seems more\r\nreasonable to maintain that the Western Cordillera is entitled to this\r\ndistinction. It is the western range, which, after passing through\r\nthe Isthmus of Panama, reappears as the Sierra Madre of Mexico and\r\nas the Rocky Mountains of North America, and continues its course,\r\nalmost without interruption, to Bering's Strait.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, the Sierra de Suma Paz which separates the two great\r\nhydrographic basins of the Orinoco and the Magdalena. We saw tiny\r\nrivulets, almost at the instant of their birth, and only a few spans\r\nfrom one another, beginning simultaneously their long journey to the\r\nbroad Magdalena to the west and to the mighty Orinoco in the distant\r\neast. Some were to visit the lands which we had already traversed,\r\nothers were to pass through a country that still lay before us,\r\nbut which we hoped to explore in the very near future.\r\n\r\nAlthough Suma Paz had long been one of the objective points of our\r\nperegrinations, we could not leave it without mingled feelings of\r\nregret and sadness. It stood between us and many delightful scenes\r\nand marked the passing of many delightful days that could never\r\nreturn. There was also, of course, a feeling of relief experienced, for\r\nwe had happily completed the most arduous part of our journey and that,\r\ntoo, without encountering a single one of the many difficulties and\r\ndangers that had been predicted when in Trinidad and Ciudad Bolivar\r\nwe announced our intention of going to Bogotá over the route whose\r\nlast lap we were completing.\r\n\r\nFrom the spot where we halted to pluck a few flowers at the mouth\r\nof the Boquerón, as a souvenir of our first passage of the Andes, we\r\ncould almost catch a glimpse towards the northwest, of the churches and\r\npublic edifices of Colombia's capital. There was one of the celebrated\r\ncamping-grounds of some of the most noted of the Conquistadores and\r\nthither we would hasten with the minimum of delay. We loved to think\r\nthat Federmann had crossed the Cordilleras just where we did. It is\r\ncertain that, if he did not cross them at this point, it was not\r\nfar distant from it. [189] All the way from Villavicencio we felt\r\nthat we were following in his footsteps, as we had been following in\r\nthe footsteps of other conquistadores from the time we had trod the\r\nromantic soil of Tierra Florida. We had, near the foothills of the\r\nCordilleras, in the neighborhood of Buena Vista, crossed the path of\r\nHernan Pérez de Quesada, who almost made the circuit of New Granada\r\nin his memorable quest of El Dorado, and we were likely to cross it\r\nagain before reaching Bogotá, for on his return from his expedition,\r\nhe, as well as Federmann, must have entered the city near where we\r\ndid ourselves.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving our posada at Caqueza we asked a certain Colombian\r\ngeneral how long it took to make the trip to Bogotá. His reply was,\r\n\"Cinco horas sin mujeres\"--Five hours without women. To our surprise\r\nthe women present made no protest against this unchivalrous reflection\r\non their horsemanship. Probably, not being accustomed to riding, they\r\nfelt that his statement was true, and that it was unwise to call it in\r\nquestion. Had some of our dashing American horsewomen been present,\r\nit is most likely that the implied challenge would have provoked a\r\nspirited retort.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the women present may have thought, we subsequently had\r\nreason to believe that the man was wrong, but for a reason different\r\nfrom the one he had given. After leaving Caqueza we had pushed forward\r\ntowards the Boquerón as rapidly as our horses--and they were good\r\nanimals--could make their way over the terrible path up the mountain,\r\nand it took us more than five hours to reach that point. Judging from\r\nour experience it would have required an extraordinary strong and\r\nspirited horse to carry a man, over such a road as we had to traverse,\r\nto Bogatá in five hours even sin mujeres.\r\n\r\nOur path, during the first few miles down the western declivity\r\nof the Suma Paz, was quite as bad as it had been anywhere on the\r\neastern slope. After, however, we had reached the plateau, about\r\nfifteen hundred feet below the Boquerón, the road became much\r\nbetter and our mounts could make far better time than was before\r\npossible. Notwithstanding the energy expended in crossing the crest of\r\nthe Andes, they were still in fine fettle, and it was only necessary to\r\ngive them a loose rein to have them break into a lively gallop, which\r\nthey seemed to be able to keep up indefinitely with but little effort.\r\n\r\nThere was not much of interest to note on this part of the way except,\r\nperhaps, some remarkable effects of erosion near the road a short\r\ndistance from the capital. The hard, compact earth was here carved\r\nby the action of rain and running water into the same fantastic\r\nforms, often resembling dolmens and cromlechs, that characterize\r\nthe Badlands of South Dakota. We regretted that we were unable to\r\ntake some photographs of them, as a number of the formations were of\r\nspecial geological importance.\r\n\r\nThe first indication of our near approach to Bogatá was a two-wheeled\r\ncart, drawn by a yoke of oxen, which we passed near the suburbs of the\r\ncity. It was the first wheeled vehicle we had seen since leaving Ciudad\r\nBolivar. Further on we were startled--and, I may add, delighted--by\r\nthe piercing sound of a locomotive whistle. It came from an engine\r\non one of the short railroads that centre in Bogotá.\r\n\r\nAt last we were getting back--I will not say to civilization--but\r\nto where the material evidences of civilisation were more numerous\r\nthan they had been anywhere on our journey since we had taken our\r\ndeparture from the Port-of-Spain. As we got still nearer the city, we\r\nmet a cavalcade of horsemen who were out for their evening ride. It was\r\nhere that we saw, for the first time in Colombia, a thoroughfare worthy\r\nof the name. Our bonny steeds, trusty and true, seemed to appreciate\r\nthe improvement in the road as much as we did ourselves. And, as if\r\nput on their mettle by the curveting steeds we had just passed, they,\r\nlike the fleet mules of Nausicaa, \"gathered up their nimble feet,\"\r\nand almost before we realized it we were in the streets of Bogotá.\r\n\r\nIt was then a matter of only a few minutes to our hotel, where we\r\nfound comforts and conveniences to which we had long been strangers. It\r\nwas just eight hours since we had left our modest posada in Caqueza,\r\nwith its simple fare and hard board cot, and now we suddenly found\r\nourselves installed in richly furnished apartments, with brilliant\r\nelectric lights and an excellent cuisine. The sudden change in our\r\nenvironment seemed like an incident in the Arabian Nights rather than\r\na reality in which we were personally concerned.\r\n\r\n\"How were you ever able to make such a trip?\" queried a German\r\ntraveler, shortly after our arrival. I had made all arrangements to go\r\nwith a friend from Bogotá to Ciudad Bolivar, but after all was ready,\r\nI was dissuaded by my friends from undertaking a journey on which I\r\nhad so long set my heart. They assured me that the trip would be so\r\ndifficult and beset with so many dangers of all kinds that I would\r\nrun the risk of losing health, and even life, if I persisted in my\r\npurpose. Only at the last moment, when they told me that the roads\r\nwere absolutely impassable at this season of the year, did I give up\r\na project that I had so long cherished. How I envy you. But it is too\r\nlate now for me to reconsider my plans, as I must return to Germany in\r\na few days, and with the knowledge that, against my better judgment,\r\nI was forced to forego the most interesting part of my itinerary.\"\r\n\r\nYes, we had indeed been fortunate in our wanderings. In the expressive\r\nlanguage of a West Indian negro servant, whom we had for a while in\r\nVenezuela, we had always been \"good-lucky, never bad-lucky.\" We had\r\nno adventures to record and never once felt that we were in presence\r\nof danger. We never carried weapons of any kind and at no time was\r\nthere any need for them. During our entire journey, through plains\r\nand among mountains, we felt quite as safe as if we had been taking a\r\npromenade down Broadway or Fifth Avenue, New York. Roughing it agreed\r\nwith us perfectly and, far from suffering from exposure or fatigue,\r\nwe found ourselves in the enjoyment of better health at the completion\r\nof our journey than at the beginning. Despite all predictions to the\r\ncontrary, we had escaped all\r\n\r\n\r\n                        \"The ministers of pain, and fear,\r\n        And disappointment, and mistrust and hate,\r\n        And clinging crime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nand had reached Colombia's capital, ready, after a few days' rest,\r\nto enter upon even a longer and a more arduous journey than the one\r\nthat we had just so happily terminated.\r\n\r\n\"But did you not fear sickness on your way?\" asked another German,\r\nwho had gone over some of the ground we had just traversed, and\r\nwho seemed to entertain anything but pleasant recollections of his\r\nexperience. \"When I traveled in the interior, far away from doctors\r\nand medical assistance of every kind, I was continually haunted\r\nby the thought of contracting fever or some other dread tropical\r\ndisease. What would you have done if you had been stricken with\r\nthe vomito or berriberri or the bubonic plague?\" Modesty forbade us\r\nreplying to this question by saying that \"The Lord takes care of his\r\nown,\" so we answered in the words of Lucan,\r\n\r\n\r\n                                    \"Capit omnia tellus\r\n        Quae genuit; coelo tegitur qui non hubet urnam.\" [190]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE ATHENS OF SOUTH AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of August, 1538, Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada, the\r\nconqueror of Cundinmarca, and his followers, after one of the most\r\nremarkable campaigns ever conducted in the New World, assembled on\r\nthe present site of Bogatá. Here Quesada dismounted from his charger,\r\nand plucking up some grass by the roots, he announced that he took\r\npossession of that land in the name of the Emperor Charles V. Having\r\nremounted his steed, he drew his sword, and challenged any one to\r\noppose this formal declaration, which, he declared, he was prepared\r\nto defend at all hazards. As no one appeared to contest his action,\r\nhe sheathed his sword, and directed the army notary to make an official\r\nrecord of what had just been accomplished.\r\n\r\nBogotá was then but a rude village, or, rather, a camp, of a dozen\r\nhastily constructed huts which barely sufficed to shelter the intrepid\r\nsons of Spain. Besides these twelve huts--erected in memory of the\r\ntwelve apostles--there had also been constructed a small wooden,\r\nthatch-covered church, on the very site occupied by the present\r\nimposing cathedral of Colombia's fair capital. The first mass was\r\nsaid in this church the sixth day of August, a few days after the\r\nceremony of occupation just mentioned--and this is regarded as the\r\nlegal date of the foundation of Bogotá. It was then that the work\r\nof the conquest was technically considered as finished. The work of\r\ncolonization was to follow without delay.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Quesada gave to the future city the name of Santa\r\nFé. [191] Being from Granada, he named the country he had discovered\r\nand conquered Nuevo Reino de Granada--the New Kingdom of Granada--an\r\nappellation it retained until after the War of Independence, when it\r\nreceived the name it now bears.\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, a striking similarity between the elevated plateau,\r\nwatered by the Funza, and the charming vega of Granada, fertilized by\r\nthe romantic Genil. To one looking towards the west, from a spur of\r\nthe mountain at the foot of which Bogotá is situated, as Granada is\r\nlocated at the foot of its hills, the ridge of Suba is seen towards\r\nthe northwest, just as the sierra of Elvira is seen with respect to\r\nthe old Moorish capital. And so it is with the relative positions\r\nof Santa Fé en la Vega and the pueblo of Fontibon. The illusion is\r\ncomplete, and the similarity between these two famous places in Spain\r\nand Colombia must have impressed themselves on the receptive mind of\r\nthe illustrious conquistador with peculiar force. Even the heights of\r\nSuacha, in aspect and position, recall the famous hill which is known\r\nas the Suspiro del Moro from the lament of Boabdil, the last king of\r\nGranada, whose tears evoked from his mother, the intrepid Sultana,\r\nAyxa la Horra, the caustic words, \"Bien hace en llorar como mujer lo\r\nque como hombre no supo defender.\" [192]\r\n\r\nSanta Fé, also known as Santa Fé de Bogotá, was for a long period\r\nthe capital of the Viceroyalty of New Granada. After the War of\r\nIndependence the name was changed to Bogotá--from Bacatá--the name\r\nof the old Chibcha capital, where the zipa, the most powerful of the\r\nIndian caciques, at the arrival of the Spaniards, had his official\r\nresidence. The city is nearly two miles in length and of varying\r\nbreadth. Its present population is nearly one hundred and twenty-five\r\nthousand. It is situated on a western spur of the great Cordillera\r\nof Suma Paz at an elevation, according to Reiss and Stübel, of eight\r\nthousand six hundred and sixteen feet above sea level--more than half\r\na mile higher than the summit of Mt. Washington, the highest point\r\nin New England.\r\n\r\nThe mean annual temperature is 60° F., but, owing to the rarity of the\r\natmosphere, and to its being shielded from the wind by the mountains\r\nat whose base it is situated, it seems to be higher than this. During\r\ncertain seasons of the year one may experience a penetrating cold,\r\nas long as one remains in the shade, but when one passes into the\r\nsunshine it becomes almost uncomfortably warm. During the rainy season,\r\nthe newcomer feels the cold very keenly, but, after a short residence\r\nin the city, one becomes acclimated and then fancies that he is in\r\nthe enjoyment of perpetual spring.\r\n\r\nWe were in Bogotá in the early part of June, during which time\r\nit rained every day. Coming directly from the tierra caliente, we\r\nsuffered considerably, especially at night, from the low temperature\r\nand the dampness that prevailed. We were, however, informed by the\r\nnatives that the season was unusually severe, and that such bad\r\nweather as we encountered was quite unusual: Velasco y Vergara --a\r\nColombian--tells that it rains the greater part of the year, and that\r\nthe sky is almost always covered by clouds. [193] For this reason,\r\nthe houses suffer from humidity, and rheumatism and kindred complaints\r\nare very prevalent. Otherwise the climate is considered salubrious.\r\n\r\nBogotá--called by the aborigines Bacatá--is a city in a state of\r\ntransition. It has lost, almost entirely, the mediæval, monastic,\r\nmozarabic aspect that characterized it while it was the tranquil\r\ncourt of the viceroys. But, great as has been the change that it\r\nhas undergone during the last few decades, it preserves much of the\r\nquaintness of colonial times. Indeed, it is not difficult, in certain\r\nparts of the city, to fancy oneself carried back to a typical Spanish\r\ntown of the time of Charles V or Philip II. As a whole, however,\r\nthe Bogotá of to-day does not differ materially in appearance from a\r\ncity of the same size in Spain or Mexico. All Latin-American cities\r\nare similar in their leading features, and when you have seen one\r\nyou have seen all.\r\n\r\nThe city is adorned by a number of broad and beautiful streets and\r\nseveral plazas and parks. Aside from a few government buildings,\r\nthe edifices that attract most attention are the monasteries and\r\nchurches. The cathedral is a noble building and compares favorably\r\nwith any similar structure in South America. The interior had just\r\nbeen artistically painted and gilded, at the time of our visit, and\r\nit reminded us somewhat of the exquisite finish of St. John Lateran,\r\nin Rome. An object of interest to the traveler, within these sacred\r\nprecincts, is the tomb of the illustrious conquistador, Gonzalo\r\nJimenez de Quesada.\r\n\r\nThe residences of the people are usually two stories high, with a\r\nbalcony on the second story facing the street. All of the older houses,\r\nas well as many of the modern ones, are of the well-known Moorish\r\nstyle of architecture, with a single large entrance--porton--and a\r\npatio--courtyard--or two, on which the rooms open. This style of\r\nbuilding is well adapted to tropical climates. It is comfortable\r\nand secures the maximum of privacy. It is in reality, as well as in\r\nfiction, the owner's castle.\r\n\r\nWe were surprised to see the number of foreign flowers grown in these\r\npatios. One would naturally expect to find representatives of the\r\nrich and beautiful Colombian flora, but the ladies of Bogotá seem\r\nto prefer the exotic blooms of the temperate zone. We found roses,\r\ncamellias, pinks and geraniums in abundance, but rarely any of those\r\nfloral beauties that had so frequently excited our admiration on\r\nthe way from the llanos to the capital. Our hotel, however, was a\r\nnotable exception to this rule. Here we were delighted with a veritable\r\nexhibition of orchids of many species and of the most wonderful forms\r\nand colors. Among them were some truly splendid specimens of oncidiums,\r\ncattleyas and odontoglossums. It was then we thought of some of our\r\norchid-loving friends of New York, who would have fairly reveled in\r\nsuch marvels of Flora's kingdom.\r\n\r\nAs nearly all the streets are paved with cobblestones, driving is\r\nanything but a pleasure. As a matter of fact, the only passable\r\ndrive in the city is the one that leads to the charming little\r\nsuburb of Chapinero. This is one of the show places of Bogotá, and\r\nits houses are in marked contrast with those found in the older part\r\nof the city. Most of them are entirely different in style from the\r\nenclosed Moorish structures of which mention has been made. Here one\r\nis introduced to cozy Swiss chalets in the midst of delightful flower\r\ngardens and picturesque French chateaux, that carry one back to the\r\nSeine and the Loire.\r\n\r\nAside from the churches and monasteries, many of which have been\r\nconverted into government offices, there were two buildings that\r\npossessed a special interest for us. One of these was the old Colegio\r\ndel Rosario--now known as the School of Philosophy and Letters--founded\r\nin 1553, nearly a hundred years before the University of Harvard. This\r\ninstitution has long been fondly spoken of by the people of Bogotá\r\nas the country's special glory--la gloria de la patria. The other\r\nbuilding was the astronomical observatory--the first intertropical\r\nstructure of the kind--erected in 1803. After the observatory of Quito,\r\nit is said to be the highest in the world.\r\n\r\nSome of the streets and houses have been recently lighted by\r\nelectricity, but as yet horses or mules are used as the motive power\r\nfor the few street cars that traverse the principal thoroughfares. It\r\nwere easy to count the number of private carriages in the city. The\r\nonly ones we saw were those of the archbishop and the president of\r\nthe republic. Indeed, so rough are the streets that most people prefer\r\nwalking to using cabs, except in cases of necessity.\r\n\r\nThe first two objects to arrest our attention, as we approached Bogotá\r\nfrom the south, were the chapels of Guadalupe and Monserrate, the\r\nformer nearly twenty-two hundred feet above the city, and the latter\r\nabout two hundred feet lower. Perched high upon the flanks of two\r\npicturesque mountain peaks, they are conspicuous objects from all parts\r\nof the Savanna. Both of these sanctuaries are reached by a foot path,\r\nbut, as yet, no attempt has been made to connect them with the city by\r\na carriage road. Owing to the altitude above sea level of these places,\r\na pilgrimage to them is quite a task--especially to the newcomer,\r\nwho is unaccustomed to the rare atmosphere of the locality. But the\r\nmagnificent view afforded one from either of these elevated shrines\r\nwell repays all the effort required to reach them. It is, in some\r\nrespects, the most beautiful to be found in the whole of Colombia. And\r\nthen, there are besides certain historical features connected with\r\nthe panorama spread out before one that make it doubly interesting.\r\n\r\nStanding in front of the church of Guadalupe, we have before us the\r\nbeautiful Savanna of Bogotá [194]--a fertile plain, nine hundred square\r\nkilometers in area. Humboldt, whose opinion has been adopted by many\r\nsubsequent writers, regarded this level stretch of land as the bottom\r\nof a lake that formerly existed here, but recent investigators have\r\ncalled this view in question. Strangely enough, the Chibcha Indians,\r\nat the time of the conquest, had a tradition that the Savanna was\r\nat one time occupied by a lake, but that Bochica, child of the sun,\r\ndrained its waters by giving them an exit through the celebrated falls\r\nof Tequendama. [195] The general appearance of the plain, as well as\r\ncertain geological features, seemed to confirm this tradition, and\r\nit was not until quite recently that any one ventured to express a\r\ndoubt about the tradition, or the long-accepted opinion of the great\r\nGerman savant.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, when the Savanna is covered by a mist, as often\r\nhappens, the observer from Monserrate or Guadalupe does indeed seem\r\nto be looking down upon a vast lake. The hills, which here and there\r\nrise above the fog, look like islands and strengthen the illusion. But\r\nthis effect is all dissipated as soon as the sun makes his appearance\r\nabove the crest of Suma Paz. One then has before him one of the\r\nmost lovely panoramas in the world. The wide verdant expanse is\r\nintersected with rivers and streams, all tributaries of the Funza,\r\nand dotted with towns and hamlets and haciendas, lakes and lakelets,\r\nlarge herds of cattle, flocks of sheep, troops of horses, mules and\r\nburros. All this is enclosed by lofty ramparts of gneiss and granite,\r\nwhich shield the inhabitants of city and plain from the tempestuous\r\nmoisture-laden winds that would otherwise often sweep over the Savanna\r\nwith the fury of a Kansas cyclone.\r\n\r\nAside from the Eucalyptus and Humboldt oak--Quercus Humboldtii--there\r\nare no large trees in the Savanna of Bogotá. The Eucalyptus, however,\r\nis everywhere visible, in the streets and in the gardens of the\r\ncapital, along the thoroughfares of the country and around every house,\r\nhowever humble, and quinta, as far as the eye can reach. These trees\r\nwere introduced from Australia only a few decades ago, and now one\r\nfinds them in all parts of the republic. We saw them all along our\r\nroute from the llanos to Bogatá. The people, especially those living\r\non the eastern slopes of the Oriental Andes, are firmly convinced that\r\ntheir presence wards off paludismo--malaria--and, as a consequence,\r\nthey are considered as indispensable around the house as the plantain\r\nor calabash tree. [196]\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more delightful than a stroll along the Rio San\r\nFrancisco, which flows between Monserrate and Guadalupe and thence\r\nthrough the city of Bogotá. The scenery is thoroughly Alpine in\r\ncharacter and, at times, picturesque beyond description. As one\r\nfollows the narrow path, always near the musical, crystal waters of the\r\nimpetuous stream, one is delighted at every step by the appearance of\r\nsome new flower of brightest hue, or some strange shrub of richest\r\nfoliage. The ground is fairly carpeted with anemones, hepaticæ,\r\ngentians, valerians, geraniums, campanulæ, lupines and buttercups. Like\r\nsimilar plants on the Alps, and on the heights of our Rockies, their\r\nstems are very short and they seem like so many rosettes attached to\r\nthe earth, or the rocks that rise up on both sides of our narrow path.\r\n\r\nOne sees well illustrated here the dividing line between the flora\r\nof the paramo and that of the tierra fría. The plants of the latter\r\ncreep up timidly from the Savanna until a certain point, and then,\r\nas if afraid to venture further into the region of frost, halt on\r\nthe lower edge of the paramo. In a similar manner the plants of the\r\nhigher altitudes cautiously descend to the upper belt of the tierra\r\nfría and there come to a standstill. They meet on a common zone in\r\nlimited numbers, but this zone is often extremely narrow. One of\r\nthe agreeable surprises to the traveler in the Andes is to note the\r\nsudden and extraordinary changes in the character of the vegetation\r\nas he ascends or descends the mountain near the line of demarcation\r\nbetween two zones.\r\n\r\nThe plateau of Guadalupe is the home of two remarkable tree ferns. One\r\nof these is the Cyathea patens, from ten to twelve feet high, with a\r\nbeautiful, umbrella-shaped crown. The other is the Dicksonia gigantea,\r\nwhich, according to the naturalist, Karsten, is probably the most\r\nvigorous and luxuriant tree fern in South America. Its massive,\r\ncolumnar trunk bears forty and more dark-green fronds, from three\r\nto four feet wide and from six to seven in length. To get a close\r\nview of even one of these noble cryptogams fully repays one for the\r\narduous climb up to its favorite habitat.\r\n\r\nAny city in the United States or Europe, having in its immediate\r\nvicinity such attractions as has Bogotá, would immediately put them\r\nwithin easy reach of the public. Thus both Monserrate and Guadalupe\r\nwould, without delay, be connected with the city by a funicular\r\nrailway, and near by would be a number of restaurants and pleasure\r\nresorts.\r\n\r\nAn electric railway would also be constructed to the great water\r\nfalls of Tequendama--the largest in Colombia and among the most\r\ncelebrated in South America. Although only thirty-six feet wide,\r\nthe main fall is three times the height of Niagara Falls. [197]\r\nBut the volume of water carried over the precipice of Tequendama is\r\nincomparably less than that which plunges into the colossal whirlpool\r\nof Niagara. In appearance it somewhat resembles Vernal Falls in the\r\nYosemite Valley, or the lower fall of the Yellowstone. What, however,\r\ngives to the Colombian cataract a beauty all its own is its setting of\r\nluxuriant tropical vegetation. In this respect our northern waterfalls,\r\nhowever attractive they may be in other respects, cannot be compared\r\nwith Tequendama.\r\n\r\nIncredible as it may seem, but few Colombians have ever seen the falls\r\nof Tequendama. Although the people of Bogotá love to talk about them,\r\nas among the greatest wonders of their country, it is rarely that one\r\nis found who has actually visited them. And yet they are not more than\r\ntwelve miles from the capital. Even the peons living on the plains\r\nonly a few miles from the cataract can give the traveler little or\r\nno information as to the best way to reach them. How different this\r\nwould all be if the place were easy of access, and if the visitor,\r\non arriving there, could find the creature comforts to be obtained\r\nin similar places in the United States and Europe!\r\n\r\nI have alluded to the interesting historical associations connected\r\nwith the city and plateau of Bogotá. It will suffice to speak of but\r\none of them; but this one is so remarkable that it is like a chapter\r\ntaken from the Arabian Nights. I refer to the meeting of the three\r\ndistinguished conquistadores, Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada, Nicholas\r\nFedermann and Sebastian de Belalcazar.\r\n\r\nQuesada had left Santa Marta in 1536, having under his command,\r\naccording to Oviedo, eight hundred men and one hundred horses. He\r\nwent part of the way by land and part by the Rio Grande, now known\r\nas the Magdalena. After reaching the Opon, he followed that river as\r\nfar as it was navigable, and eventually made his way to the plateau\r\nof Bogotá--the land of the Chibchas.\r\n\r\nHis march was, in some respects, the most difficult and remarkable\r\nin the annals of the conquest. He had to contend against relentless\r\nsavages, dismal swamps and almost impenetrable forests, where he had\r\nto cut his way through the tangled vines and bushes, and where it\r\nwas often impossible to make more than a league a day. His men were\r\ndecimated by disease and starvation. When he at last arrived at the\r\nValle de Alcazares, near the present site of Bogotá, he could count\r\nbut one hundred infantry and sixty cavalry. But with this handful\r\nof men he had conquered the Chibcha nation, numbering, according to\r\nthe old chroniclers, one million people and having twenty thousand\r\nsoldiers in the field.\r\n\r\nScarcely, however, was his campaign against the aborigines successfully\r\nterminated, when information was conveyed him of a new danger in the\r\nperson of a German competitor, who had just arrived from the llanos.\r\n\r\nFive years previously, Federmann, in the service of the Welsers,\r\nhad left Coro in Venezuela, with four hundred well-armed and\r\nwell-provisioned men. After wandering over trackless plains and\r\nthrough dark and almost impenetrable forests, enduring frightful\r\nhardships of all kinds, he finally got word of the Chibchas and of\r\ntheir treasures of gold and precious stones. He forthwith changed his\r\nroute and crossed the Eastern Cordilleras, where the traveler André\r\nassures us it is now absolutely impossible to pass. [198]\r\n\r\nThus, almost before Quesada was aware that Federmann was in the\r\ncountry, he was constrained by policy to receive him and his one\r\nhundred ragged and famished followers--these were all that remained of\r\nhis gallant band--as his guests. The Spanish conquistador knew that\r\nthe German leader would put in a claim for a part of the territory\r\nthat they had both been exploring, and which, until then, each of them\r\nhad regarded as his own by right of conquest. He was then naturally\r\neager to effect a settlement with his competitor on the best terms\r\npossible, and get him out of the country with the least possible\r\ndelay. Federmann agreed to renounce all his claims in consideration\r\nof his receiving himself the sum of ten thousand pesos, and of having\r\nhis soldiers enjoy all the rights of discoverers and conquistadores\r\naccorded to those of Quesada.\r\n\r\nScarcely, however, had these negotiations been happily terminated,\r\nwhen another and a more formidable rival appeared on the scene,\r\non his way from the distant South. This was Sebastian de Belalcazar,\r\n[199] the famous lieutenant of Francisco Pizarro. He was then governor\r\nof Quito and the conqueror of much of the territory now included in\r\nEcuador and Southern Colombia. Hearing casually of El Dorado and of\r\nthe marvelous riches this ruler was reputed to possess, the Spanish\r\nchieftain lost no time in organizing an expedition to the country of\r\ngold and emeralds, of fertile plains and delightful valleys. Setting\r\nout with the assurance of an early and easy victory, and of soon\r\nbecoming the possessors of untold wealth and all the enjoyment that\r\nwealth could command, the soldiers, in quest of El Dorado, exclaimed\r\nwith unrestrained enthusiasm:\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Nuestros sean su oro y sus placeres,\r\n        Gocemos de ese campo y ese sol.\" [200]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut anticipation is not fruition. This the Spaniards soon learned\r\nto their sorrow. Like Quesada and Federmann and their followers,\r\nBelalcazar and his men had to endure frightful hardships during\r\nthe long and painful march of many months from Quito to the\r\nplateau of Bogotá. According to Castellanos, who wrote while many\r\nof these adventurers were still living, and who had received from\r\nthem directly an account of their privations and sufferings and the\r\ncountless obstacles that at times rendered progress almost impossible,\r\ntheir journey was made through mountains and districts that were\r\ninaccessible and uninhabitable, through gloomy forests and dense,\r\ntangled underbrush; through inhospitable lands and dismal swamps,\r\nwhere there was neither food nor shelter for man or beast. [201]\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary and accidental meeting of the three conquistadores,\r\ncoming from so great distances, from three different points of the\r\ncompass, is one of the most interesting episodes in the history of\r\nthe conquest. It was a critical moment for the Europeans. If they\r\nhad failed to agree, and had turned their arms against one another,\r\nthose who would have escaped alive would have been at the mercy of\r\nthe Indians, who would at once have rallied their forces to repel\r\nthe invaders. But, fortunately, wise councils prevailed and a clash\r\nwas averted.\r\n\r\n\"While the clergy and the religious,\" writes Acosta, \"were going\r\nto and from the different camps endeavoring to prevent a rupture,\r\nthe three parties of Spaniards, coming from points so distant, and\r\nnow occupying the three apices of a triangle, whose sides measured\r\nthree or four leagues, presented a singular spectacle. Those from\r\nPeru were clad in scarlet cloth and silk, and wore steel helmets and\r\ncostly plumes. Those from Santa Marta had cloaks, linens and caps\r\nmade by the Indians. Those, however, from Venezuela, like refugees\r\nfrom Robinson Crusoe's island, were covered with the skins of bears,\r\nleopards, tigers and deer. Having journeyed more than thirteen hundred\r\nleagues through uninhabited lands, they had experienced the most\r\ncruel hardships. They arrived poor, naked, and reduced to one-fourth\r\nof their original number.\r\n\r\n\"The three chiefs,\" continues Acosta, \"were among the most\r\ndistinguished men who ever came to America. Belalcazar, son of\r\na woodman of Extremadura, attained by his talents and valor the\r\nreputation of being one of the most celebrated conquistadores of\r\nSouth America and was endowed in a degree far above the other two\r\nwith political tact and observing genius. As soon as he became\r\naware of the agreement entered into between Quesada and Federmann,\r\nhe nobly waived his rights, and declined to accept the sum which\r\nQuesada offered him. He stipulated only that his soldiers should\r\nnot be prevented from returning to Peru, when they might desire to\r\ndo so, or when Pizarro should demand them, and that Captain Juan\r\nCabrera should return to found a town in Neiva, a territory which,\r\nalong with Timana, was to be under the government of Popayan, which\r\nit was his intention to solicit from the Emperor. In the meantime he\r\nagreed to accompany Quesada to Spain.\" [202]\r\n\r\nThe three went to Spain together, as had been arranged, each of them\r\nconfident of receiving from the Spanish monarch a reward commensurate\r\nwith his labors and services to the crown. Each one aspired to the\r\ngovernorship of New Granada and used all his influence to secure the\r\ncoveted prize.\r\n\r\nThe net result of their efforts was a sad experience of the vanity\r\nof human wishes. All were disappointed in their expectations. The\r\nguerdon all so eagerly strove for was awarded to another, who had\r\ntaken no part in the conquest that had rendered the three aspirants\r\nto royal favor so famous.\r\n\r\nOnly Belalcazar received any recognition whatever. He was made\r\nadelantado of Popayan and the surrounding territory. As for Quesada\r\nand Federmann, they fell into disfavor. The latter soon disappeared\r\nfrom public view entirely, but long afterwards, Quesada was able\r\nto return to the land where he had won so many laurels. And it was\r\nfitting that, after his death, his remains should repose in the noble\r\ncathedral that adorns the capital of which he was the founder. [203]\r\n\r\nIn adventure and achievement, the three conquistadores above mentioned\r\ntake rank with Cortes, Pizarro and Orellana. Given a Homer, their\r\nwanderings and deeds would afford themes for three Odysseys of\r\nintense and abiding interest. Given even an Ercilla, we should have\r\na literary monument, which, in romantic episode and dramatic effect,\r\nwould eclipse the Araucana, the nearest approach to an epic that\r\nSouth America has yet produced.\r\n\r\nThe Bogotános have long claimed for their city the distinction of\r\nbeing the Athens of South America. And considering its past and present\r\nculture, and the attention which the arts, the sciences and literature\r\nhave always received there since the foundation of the capital, few,\r\nI think, will be disposed to impugn the justness of this claim.\r\n\r\nBogotá's first man of letters was none other than the licentiate\r\nGonzalo Jimenez de Quesada himself--a man who could wield the pen\r\nwith as much skill as the sword. Indeed, the detailed knowledge that\r\nwe have of many features of his memorable campaigns we owe to his\r\nfertile pen. He is really the first and, in some respects, the most\r\nimportant chronicler of the events in which he took so conspicuous a\r\npart. How unlike, in this respect, is he not, to Pizarro and Almagro,\r\nwho were unable to sign their own names?\r\n\r\nAmong the other early writers of New Granada was Padre Juan de\r\nCastellanos, the poet-historiographer, who has been so frequently\r\nquoted in the preceding chapters. The extent of his work may be\r\ngauged by the fact that it contains one hundred and fifty thousand\r\nhendecasyllabic verses--more than ten times as many as are in the\r\nDivina Commedia--and more than are found in any other metrical work,\r\nexcept the Hindu epic known as the Mahabharata, which contains no\r\nfewer than one hundred and ten thousand couplets.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that in Colombia, as in Spain, Portugal\r\nand Mexico, the nun in the cloister has found time to devote to\r\nliterature as well as to contemplation and works of charity. Among\r\nthese successful imitators of St. Theresa, whose works, both in prose\r\nand verse, have long been the admiration of the literary world, may be\r\nmentioned Sor Francisca Josefa de la Concepcion, of Tunga. Although\r\nshe wrote in prose, she, by her purity of language and delicacy of\r\nsentiment, is entitled to rank with such distinguished ornaments of\r\nthe cloister as Sor Junana Ines de la Cruz, of Mexico; Sor Maria de\r\nCeo, of Portugal; Sor Gregoria de Santa Teresa, of Seville; and Sor\r\nAna de San Jeronimo, of Granada, Spain. [204]\r\n\r\nThe names of the poets and prose writers of Colombia, that have\r\nachieved distinction, make a long list. Many of them enjoy an\r\ninternational reputation, and their productions compare favorably with\r\nthe best efforts of the writers of the mother country--Spain. [205]\r\n\r\nIn science, too, Colombia counts many sons who have contributed\r\ngreatly to our knowledge of nature. It suffices to recall the names\r\nof such savants as Francisco Antonio Zea, Francisco José de Caldas\r\nand the illustrious Mutis, whom Humboldt called \"the patriarch of the\r\nbotanists of the New World,\" and whose name Linnæeus declared to be\r\nimmortal--\"nomen immortale quod nulla aetas unquam delebit.\"\r\n\r\nThere were at one time no fewer than twenty-three colleges in New\r\nGranada. The first of these was founded in 1554, for the education of\r\nthe Indians. The following year another one was established for the\r\nbenefit of Spanish orphans and mestizos. In one of the colleges was\r\na special chair for the study of the Muisca language. The Royal and\r\nPontifical University began its existence in 1627, thirteen years\r\nbefore the foundation of Harvard College. In 1653 the Archbishop\r\nD. Fr. Cristobal de Torres founded the celebrated College del Rosario,\r\nwhich, by reason of its munificent endowment, was able to render such\r\nsplendid service to the cause of education, and was long recognized\r\nas the leading institution of learning in New Granada.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Viceroyalty of Santa Fe was behind Mexico [206] and\r\nLima in the introduction of the printing press, it claims the honor\r\nof establishing the first astronomical observatory in America, as\r\nMexico was the first to have a botanical garden, a school of mines,\r\nand a school of medicine. It was also among the first, if not the\r\nvery first, of the capitals of the New World to open a public library.\r\n\r\nThe number of public and private libraries now existing in the city\r\nof Bogotá contribute greatly towards justifying its claim to being\r\nthe chief centre of South American culture. Another evidence of the\r\nintellectual atmosphere that obtains there is the number of secondhand\r\nbook stores. In browsing among these storehouses of old and precious\r\ntomes I quite forgot, for the time being, that I was so far from the\r\nbusy world of action, and could easily fancy myself among the book\r\nshops of Florence, Leipsic or Paris. Indeed, some of the most prized\r\nvolumes in my Latin-American library I picked up on the book stalls\r\nof Bogotá.\r\n\r\nMr. R. B. Cunninghame Graham, in his preface to Sr. Triana's work,\r\nDown the Orinoco in a Canoe, says the capital of Colombia \"is in a\r\nway a kind of Chibcha Athens. There all men write, and poets rave and\r\nmadden through the land, and only wholesome necessary revolutions\r\nkeep their number down.\" Again, he declares: \"Bogotá to-day is,\r\nwithout doubt, the greatest literary centre south of Panama. Putting\r\naside the flood of titubating verse which, like a mental dysentery,\r\nafflicts all members of the Spanish-speaking race, in Bogotá more\r\nserious literary work is done during a month than in the rest of the\r\nrepublics in a year.\" [207]\r\n\r\nMr. W. L. Scruggs, sometime American minister to Bogotá, writes in\r\nthe same sense. \"Most of the educated classes,\" he says, \"have,\r\nor think they have, the literary faculty. They are particularly\r\nfond of writing what they call poetry, and of making post-prandial\r\nspeeches. The average collegian will write poetry [208] by the yard\r\nor speak impromptu by the hour. He never shows the least embarrassment\r\nbefore an audience, and is rarely at a loss for a word. The adjectives\r\nand adverbs flow in sluices of unbroken rhythm, and the supply of\r\neuphonious words and hyperbolic phrases seems inexhaustible. He always\r\ngesticulates vehemently, and somehow it seems to become him well;\r\nfor no matter how little there may be in what he says, somebody is\r\nsure to applaud and encourage him.\"\r\n\r\nIn Colombia there seem to be as many \"doctors,\" that is, men who have\r\nthe degree of Doctor of Laws, as there are generals in Venezuela. Most\r\nof them are politicians, or contributors to the various newspapers\r\nof the country, or \"professors\"--there are no pedagogues--in the\r\nnumerous educational institutions of the Republic.\r\n\r\nThe number of newspapers published in Bogotá is surprising--more than\r\nthere are in Boston or Philadelphia. Of course, their circulation is\r\nextremely limited. They are mostly partisan organs--an independent\r\npaper being unknown--or literary journals remarkable, the majority\r\nof them, for long poems, verbose editorials and translations of the\r\nlatest French novels.\r\n\r\nOn the way down from the chapel of Guadalupe, near the opening of the\r\ngorge between the peaks of Monserrate and Guadalupe, one passes what\r\nwas once the Quinta Bolivar, a gift to the Liberator by one of his\r\nwealthy admirers. It is now the property of a thrifty Antioquenian,\r\nwho has converted it into a tannery. As we pass along the north side\r\nof San Carlos' palace, which contains the office of the ministry\r\nof foreign affairs, we observe the historic window from which, as a\r\nmemorial tablet informs us, Bolivar escaped assassination, Sept. 25th,\r\n1828. In the centre of the principal plaza, called the Plaza Bolivar,\r\nis a bronze statue of the Liberator by Tenerani, a pupil of Canova.\r\n\r\nEverywhere in Colombia, as in Venezuela, we are reminded of Bolivar\r\nand find monuments to his memory. In Ciudad Bolivar and in Valencia\r\nand elsewhere there are statues of him. In Caracas there are several,\r\namong them a large equestrian statue which is a replica of one in Lima.\r\n\r\nBut the people, in their desire to honor their hero, have not been\r\nsatisfied with statues alone. Coins bear his name and image, towns and\r\nstates are named after him. More than this, his name has been given\r\nto one of the South American republics--Bolivia--a republic, formerly\r\na part of Peru--Upper Peru--which owes its very existence to him.\r\n\r\nBut who was Simon Bolivar, one will ask, and what has he done to\r\nachieve such distinction and to command recognition in such diverse\r\nways and in regions so widely separated?\r\n\r\nHis admirers say that he was the Washington of South America--the one\r\nwho secured the independence of the Spanish colonies, after three\r\ncenturies of misrule and oppression. According to them, he was one\r\nof the world's greatest geniuses in military science, a genius in\r\nstate-craft, a genius in everything required to make a great and\r\nsuccessful leader of men.\r\n\r\nSr. Miguel Tejera does not hesitate to characterize him as one who was\r\n\"Bold and fortunate as Alexander, a patriot like Hannibal, brave and\r\nclement like Cæsar, a great captain and a profound statesman like\r\nNapoleon, honorable as Washington, a sublime poet and a versatile\r\norator, such was Bolivar, who united in his own mind all the vast\r\nmultiplicity of the elements of genius. His glory will shine in\r\nthe heaven of history, not as a meteor that passes, and is lost\r\nin the bosom of space, but as a heavenly body, whose radiance is\r\never-increasing.\" [209]\r\n\r\nEven more extravagant are the claims made for his hero by Don Felipe\r\nLarazabel in his bulky two-tome Vida de Bolivar.\r\n\r\n\"A noble and sublime spirit, humane, just, liberal, Bolivar was one of\r\nthe most gifted men the world has ever known; so perfect and unique\r\nthat in goodness he was like Titus, in his fortune and achievements\r\nlike Trapan, in urbanity like Marcus Aurelius, in valor like Cæsar,\r\nin learning and eloquence like Augustus....\r\n\r\n\"He was a poet like Homer, a legislator like Plato, a soldier like\r\nBonaparte.... He taught Soublett and Heres diplomacy, Santander\r\nadministration, Gual politics, Marshal Sucre military art.\r\n\r\n\"Like Charlemagne, but in a higher degree, he possessed the\r\nart of doing great things with ease and difficult things with\r\npromptness. Whoever conceived plans so vast? Whoever carried them to a\r\nmore successful issue? A quick and unerring glance; a rapid intuition\r\nof things and times; a prodigious spontaneity in improvising gigantic\r\nplans; the science of war reduced to the calculation of minutes,\r\nan extraordinary vigor of conception, and a creative spirit, fertile\r\nand inexhaustible, ... such was Bolivar.\r\n\r\n\"'Deus ille fuit, Deus, inclyte Memmi.' He was a god, illustrious\r\nMemmius, he was a god.\" [210]\r\n\r\nCol. G. Hippisley, who served under Bolivar in the War of Independence,\r\ndoes not give such a flattering estimate of the Liberator. \"Bolivar,\"\r\nhe writes, \"would willingly ape the great man. He aspires to be\r\na second Bonaparte in South America, without possessing a single\r\ntalent for the duties of the field or the cabinet.... He has\r\nneither talents nor abilities for a general, and especially for\r\na commander-in-chief.... Tactics, movements and manoeuvre are as\r\nunknown to him as to the lowest of his troops. All idea of regularity,\r\nsystem or the common routine of an army, or even a regiment, he is\r\ntotally unacquainted with. Hence arise all the disasters he meets, the\r\ndefeats he suffers and his constant obligations to retreat whenever\r\nopposed to the foe. The victory, which he gains to-day, however\r\ndearly purchased ... is lost to-morrow by some failure or palpable\r\nneglect on his part. Thus it is that Paez was heard to tell Bolivar,\r\nafter the action at Villa del Cura, that he would move off his own\r\ntroops, and act no more with him in command; adding, 'I have never\r\nlost a battle wherein I acted by myself, or in a separate command;\r\nand I have always been defeated when acting in connection with you\r\nor under your orders.'\" [211]\r\n\r\nGen. Holstein, who was the Liberator's chief-of-staff and who was,\r\ntherefore, in a position to have intimate knowledge of the man, is\r\neven more pronounced in his strictures on the character and capacity\r\nof the commander-in-chief of the patriot forces.\r\n\r\n\"The dominant traits in the character of General Bolivar are\r\nambition, vanity, thirst for absolute, undivided power and profound\r\ndissimulation.... Many of his generals have done far more than he has\r\nto free the country from the Spaniards.... The brightest deeds of all\r\nthese generals were performed in the absence of Bolivar. Abroad they\r\nwere attributed to his military skill and heroism, while, in fact,\r\nhe was a fugitive a thousand miles from the scenes of their bravery,\r\nand never dreaming of their success.... General Bolivar, moreover, has\r\nnever made a charge of cavalry nor with the bayonet; on the contrary,\r\nhe has ever been careful to keep himself out of danger.\" [212]\r\n\r\nElsewhere in his work, Holstein claims to \"prove that Bolivar, the\r\nRepublic of Colombia and its chieftains, are indebted to strangers\r\nand their powerful support for their existence, if not as a free,\r\nat least as an independent people.\" There were, according to some\r\nestimates, fully ten thousand European soldiers in the republican\r\narmy, and among the officers were Englishmen, Germans, Irishmen, Poles\r\nand Frenchmen. It was, according to Holstein, the Irish legion that\r\ngained the great battle of Carabobo, which secured the independence of\r\nVenezuela. [213] It was the British legion, declares the same writer,\r\nthat won the decisive victory of Boyacá, which broke the power of\r\nthe Spaniards in New Granada. Sucre, the victorious general in the\r\nbattle of Pichincha, which liberated Ecuador, was also the victor\r\nin the battles of Junin and Ayacucho--the Waterloo of colonial rule\r\nin South America--which gave freedom to Peru. Bolivar had the honor\r\nof gaining both victories, although he was ill during the battle of\r\nAyacucho, and a hundred miles from the field of action during the\r\nstruggle on the plateau of Junin.\r\n\r\nIn view of all this, Holstein does not hesitate to declare that Bolivar\r\nrules \"with more power and absoluteness than does the autocrat of\r\nRussia or the Sultan of Constantinople,\" and that, compared with George\r\nWashington, Simon Bolivar was but a Liliputian. Sr. Riva Aguero, the\r\nfirst president of Peru, goes farther and assures us that the terrible\r\ncharacterization, given by Apollocorus, of Philip of Macedon, father of\r\nAlexander the Great, is but a true portrait of the Liberator Bolivar.\r\n\r\nThese estimates of Bolivar, so different from those of Tejera and\r\nLarrazabel and many of Bolivar's other biographers--remind one of\r\nwhat Montesquieu says about the contradictory accounts which partisan\r\nwriters have given us regarding certain potentates of antiquity. As\r\ninstances he cites Alexander, who is described as the veriest poltroon\r\nby Herodian, and extolled as a paragon of valor by Lampridius; and\r\nGratian, who by his admirers is lauded to the skies and by Philostorgus\r\ncompared to Nero.\r\n\r\n\"But, how is it possible, the question naturally arises, that General\r\nBolivar should have liberated his country, and preserved to himself\r\nthe supreme power, without superior talent?\"\r\n\r\n\"If by liberating his country,\" replies Gen. Holstein, in answer to\r\nhis own question, \"it be meant that he has given his country a free\r\ngovernment, I answer that he has not done so. If it be meant that\r\nhe has driven out the Spaniards, I answer that he has done little\r\ntowards this; far less certainly than the meanest of his subordinate\r\nchieftains. To the question, How can he have retained his power without\r\nsuperior talent? I answer, in the first place, that the reputation\r\nof superior talent goes a great way.... The stupid management of\r\nthe Spanish authorities has facilitated all the operations of the\r\npatriots. The grievous faults of Bolivar and some of his generals\r\nhave been exceeded by those of his adversaries. It is not strange,\r\ntherefore, that Bolivar should have been able to do all he has done\r\nwith very limited talents.\" [214]\r\n\r\nSuch a marked divergence of views respecting the character of Bolivar\r\nand the position he should occupy among the great chieftains of\r\nhistory admits of an explanation, but such an explanation would of\r\nitself require a volume. It is safe to say, however, that no reliable\r\nbiography of the Liberator has yet appeared, and that, when it does\r\nappear, it is most likely that Bolivar will occupy a position much\r\nbelow that claimed for him by some of his over-enthusiastic eulogists\r\nand above that assigned to him by those who have manifested less\r\nadmiration for his policy and achievements.\r\n\r\nTo write a definitive biography of Bolivar will not be an easy\r\ntask. It will require a man of broad sympathies; one entirely free\r\nfrom all national antipathy and religious bias; one with a judicial\r\nmind, who can sift and weigh evidence without prejudice, and render\r\na verdict strictly in accordance with the facts in the case. Most,\r\nif not all, who have hitherto written about Bolivar, have exhibited\r\na partisan spirit and allowed themselves to be swayed by political\r\nand other considerations, which have so greatly detracted from the\r\nvalue of their work that it cannot be accepted as authentic history.\r\n\r\nTo do full justice to the subject in all its bearings will require\r\nimpartial judgment, ripe and varied scholarship, and above all, a keen\r\nand comprehensive historic sense. The writer will have to discuss\r\nthe relation of Spain to her colonies, and consider various social,\r\npolitical, racial, economical and religious questions that are as\r\ndifficult as they are complicated and conflicting. He must have an\r\nintimate and accurate knowledge of the character and aspirations of the\r\ndifferent peoples with whom Bolivar and his lieutenants had to deal. He\r\nmust be familiar with the history and traditions of the various South\r\nAmerican presidencies and viceroyalties and captaincies-general, and\r\ntake note of the passions and prejudices and jealousies that have been\r\nthe cause of so many sanguinary revolutions and have contributed so\r\nmuch to retard intellectual progress and material advancement. Only\r\nwhen such an one appears, and completes the colossal task, shall we\r\nhave a definitive life of Simon Bolivar, and an authentic record of\r\nthe War of Independence.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this chapter some reference seems necessary to what\r\ncannot escape even the most casual student of South American history,\r\nbut what, to the observant traveler, seems to be a matter of special\r\nmoment. I refer to Bolivar's policy of dividing and weakening Peru,\r\nand to his uniting under one flag the three northern countries of\r\nthe continent. The separation of Upper Peru--Bolivia--from Lower Peru\r\nseems, in the light of events since the change, to have been a fatal\r\nmistake and detrimental to the best interests of Bolivia as well as\r\nto those of Peru.\r\n\r\nI think, however, he exhibited unusual wisdom and foresight in\r\ncombining in one republic--Gran Colombia--the provinces of Quito,\r\nNew Granada and Venezuela. I know Gen. Mitre has denounced the idea\r\nas an absurdity--como un absurdo-- [215] but, if this distinguished\r\nwriter had had an opportunity to study actual conditions, as they\r\npresent themselves to the traveler to-day, and to consult the wishes\r\nand welfare of the large mass of the people at present dwelling\r\nwithin the confines of Greater Colombia, I think he would have been\r\ndisposed to accept Bolivar's plan for a great nation, extending from\r\nthe Atlantic to the Pacific, as the best for all concerned.\r\n\r\nHad the destiny of Colombia, after the union, been entrusted to the\r\ndirection of wise and unselfish patriots, as was the infant Republic\r\nof the United States of North America, one may well believe that the\r\nhistory of this part of South America, during the last three-quarters\r\nof a century, would have been quite different from what it has been,\r\nand that it would have been spared those countless internecine wars\r\nthat have deluged the country in blood and rendered civilization,\r\nin its higher sense, impossible.\r\n\r\nThe geographical features of the country, and the diverse interests\r\nof its different sections, were, pace Mitre, no more opposed to\r\nthe formation of a great and stable republic on the Caribbean than\r\nthey were in that vast commonwealth to the north of the Gulf of\r\nMexico, where the Stars and Stripes have so long been the symbol of\r\npeace, prosperity and national greatness. The people in the southern\r\ncontinent, were not, it is true, so well prepared for a democratic form\r\nof government as were their brethren in the north, but if, instead\r\nof being cursed with selfish and destructive militarism, they could\r\nhave enjoyed the blessings of competent and far-seeing statesmanship,\r\nit is safe to affirm that the Great Colombia, as Bolivar conceived\r\nit, would, ere this, have developed into a flourishing and powerful\r\nrepublic--worthy of taking a place among the great nations of the\r\nworld. [216]\r\n\r\nBut, sad to relate, Bolivar's creation was short-lived. After a\r\nprecarious existence of only eleven years, disintegration took place,\r\nand the Liberator, fallen into disfavor and condemned to exile,\r\nwas forced to be a witness of the collapse of the structure that had\r\ncost him so much labor, and which he had fondly hoped would be his\r\ngreatest and most enduring monument.\r\n\r\nShortly before his death at the hacienda of San Pedro, near Santa\r\nMarta, where he perished alone,\r\n\r\n\"Maligned and doubted and denied, a broken-hearted man,\" he wrote\r\nto General Flores, of Ecuador, a letter in which occur the following\r\nremarkable statements:--\r\n\r\n\"I have been in power--yo he mandado--for nearly twenty years, from\r\nwhich I have gathered only a few definite results:--\r\n\r\n\"1. America for us is ungovernable.\r\n\r\n\"2. He who dedicates his services to a revolution plows the sea.\r\n\r\n\"3. The only thing that can be done in America is to emigrate.\r\n\r\n\"4. This country will inevitably fall into the hands of the unbridled\r\nrabble, and little by little become a prey to petty tyrants of all\r\ncolors and races.\r\n\r\n\"5. Devoured as we shall be by all possible crimes and ruined by\r\nour own ferociousness, Europeans will not deem it worth while to\r\nconquer us.\r\n\r\n\"6. If it were possible for any part of the world to return to a\r\nstate of primitive chaos, that would be the last stage of Spanish\r\nAmerica.\" [217]\r\n\r\nWas the Liberator gifted with a seer's vision when he penned these\r\nprophetic words? It would seem so, for even if he had open before\r\nhim the scroll in which has been recorded the chief events of the\r\nhistory of South America during the past three-quarters of a century,\r\nhe could scarcely have spoken with greater truth and precision. Certain\r\nit is, as Mitre well observes, that none of his designs or ideals have\r\nsurvived him. His political work died with him and all his fond dreams\r\nof a vast Andean Empire vanished like mist before the rising sun.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to account for the turmoil and anarchy\r\nwhich have so long devastated one of the most fertile quarters of\r\nthe globe. Considering its immense natural resources and its many\r\nadvantages of climate and geographical position, it should be one of\r\nthe most prosperous regions of the earth, and its inhabitants among the\r\nhappiest and most advanced in culture and the arts of peace. Let it\r\nsuffice to reproduce the following paragraph from the work, already\r\ncited, of Sr. Perez Triana:--\r\n\r\n\"As to the topsy-turviness of things Spanish and Spanish-American,\r\nthe story is told that Santiago, the patron saint of Spain, being\r\nadmitted into the presence of God, asked and obtained for the\r\nland of Spain and for its people all sorts of blessings; marvelous\r\nfertility for the soil, natural wealth of all kinds in the mountains\r\nand the forests, abundance of fish in the rivers and of birds in the\r\nair; courage, sobriety, and all the manly virtues for men; beauty,\r\ngrace and loveliness for the women. All this was granted, but on the\r\npoint of leaving, the saint, it is said, asked from God that he would\r\nalso grant Spain a good government. The request was denied, as then,\r\nit is said, the Lord remarked, the angels would abandon heaven and\r\nflock to Spain. The story has lost none of its point.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE MUISCA TRAIL\r\n\r\n\r\nOur sojourn in Bogotá was much briefer than we could have wished it to\r\nbe. Its intellectual atmosphere impressed us deeply, and the culture\r\nand refinement of its people charmed us beyond expression. During our\r\njourney, we had visited many places in which we would have desired\r\nto tarry longer, had it been possible, but so far no place had so\r\ncompletely captivated us as Colombia's famous metropolis--no place\r\nfrom which we were so loath to depart.\r\n\r\n\"What a pity,\" we said, \"that Colombia and Colombians are not better\r\nknown in our own country! It would be better for them and better for\r\nus.\" With special truth can one reiterate of the inhabitants of this\r\nlittle-known republic what Senator Root has said of the people of\r\nSouth America in general:--\r\n\r\n\"Two-thirds of the suspicion, the dislike, the distrust, with which our\r\ncountry was regarded by the people of South America, was the result\r\nof the arrogant and contemptuous bearing of Americans, of people of\r\nthe United States, for those gentle, polite, sensitive, imaginative,\r\ndelightful people.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senator, as President Roosevelt's representative, did much,\r\nduring his visit to our sister continent, to remove misunderstandings\r\nand establish more cordial relations between the United States and\r\nLatin America. And the Bureau of American Republics is contributing\r\nmuch towards completing and extending his work. It is, therefore,\r\nto be hoped, that soon \"the suspicion, the dislike, the distrust\"\r\nwill be eliminated forever and succeeded by an era of mutual respect\r\nand indissoluble friendship.\r\n\r\nOur luggage--small in amount, be it said--was conveyed from our\r\nhotel to the depot, a few blocks distant, by a good-natured\r\nChibcha Indian. He asked for his service the sum of forty\r\ndollars, which, to his great delight, was paid promptly and without\r\nquestion. \"Muchisimas gracias, mi amo. Que Vd vaya bien!\" Many thanks,\r\nmy master. Farewell! were his parting words, as he passed out of the\r\nstation with his hat in his hand and a smile lighting up his face.\r\n\r\n\"Forty dollars for carrying a little luggage a few squares! Why,\r\nthat,\" one would say, \"was down-right robbery.\" Not at all, when\r\nyou are accustomed to paying such prices, and we had become quite\r\naccustomed to them, ever since we had entered Colombian territory. As\r\na matter of fact, we found the peon's bill very moderate.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, however, it must be confessed that we were surprised\r\nat some of the bills presented us for payment. The first one was for\r\nthe washing of some linen in a town on the Meta. The work was done\r\nby an Indian woman, for which a charge was made of two hundred and\r\nforty-five dollars. This bill, large as it was, did not frighten us\r\nas much as one that Mark Twain tells of in his Innocents Abroad, when\r\nduring his visit to the Azores, one of his traveling companions was\r\ncharged some thousands of milreis for a modest repast. We should have\r\npaid it without comment, but found that the articles in question had\r\nbeen washed only and not ironed. When we remarked upon this apparent\r\nforgetfulness or neglect, the tawny laundress informed us that it\r\nwas not the custom there for the same person to do both washing and\r\nironing, and referred us to a neighbor of hers as one quite competent\r\nto complete the work she had begun. Unfortunately, as it had been\r\nraining continuously for several days, and our laundress had no way\r\nof drying the things she had washed, except in the sun--which had\r\nobstinately refused to appear--and as we were obliged to take our\r\ndeparture without delay, the wearing apparel aforesaid was neither\r\nironed nor dried.\r\n\r\nBut the washer-woman's bill, which seems exorbitant, requires an\r\nexplanation. It was all a mere matter of the rate of exchange, which,\r\nin Colombia, during the time of our visit, was ten thousand. That\r\nmeans that the peso--dollar--had a value of just one centavo--one\r\ncent. Some years ago the rate of exchange was much higher. Now,\r\nhowever, there is a well-founded hope, that the financial condition\r\nof the country will soon be on a more satisfactory basis, and that\r\nbefore many years elapse, it can be put on a gold basis. The present\r\nlegal tender of the country is paper currency and gold coin. Outside\r\nof the large cities one never sees anything but paper money. I have\r\nknown the peons in several cases to refuse coin because they thought it\r\nwas counterfeit--so long is it since gold coin has been in circulation.\r\n\r\nThe present financial condition of the republic is a striking\r\ncommentary on the havoc wrought by the numerous revolutions that have\r\ndevastated the country and ruined its credit. One of the most difficult\r\nof the many difficult tasks that confront the administration is that of\r\nrestoring the nation's credit, and of getting the rate of exchange back\r\nto par. It is, however, making a noble effort, and all well-wishers\r\nof Colombia trust its endeavors will be crowned with success.\r\n\r\nAs one may imagine, it is necessary for the traveler to carry with\r\nhim quite a bulky package of bills in order to live in even the\r\nmost modest fashion. A mule or a cart was not, however, required\r\nto transport our funds, as Hazard, in his work on Haiti, says was\r\nindispensable in that ill-fated land, where a hundred dollars in\r\ngold was exchanged for several sacks of bills--huge bags--not unlike\r\nbundles of rags or waste paper.\r\n\r\nTo us it was always interesting to hear the peons talk of their fortune\r\nof hundreds or thousands of dollars. It seemed to give the poor\r\nfellows special satisfaction to deal in large figures and to speak\r\nof large sums, as if they were all rising millionaires. The monetary\r\ncrisis had this redeeming feature, if no other, that it afforded the\r\nbeggar in the street the pleasure of seeing dollars in his alms where,\r\nbefore the revolution, he would have found only so many cents. The\r\nsturdy market women we saw on the way from Caqueza to Bogotá talked\r\nin a most happy way of their prospects of realizing forty dollars a\r\npiece for their chickens and fifteen dollars a dozen for their eggs,\r\nwhile their husbands were rejoicing in the thought that they would\r\nreceive a thousand dollars for a heifer and two thousand or more\r\nfor a milch-cow. They never used the words \"cents\"; it was always\r\n\"pesos\"--dollars. Happy people, who find such delight in names and\r\nappearances!\r\n\r\nThere are but few railroads in Colombia, and their total mileage\r\nat the time of our visit was less than five hundred miles. Many\r\nroads are projected and have been for decades past, but the numerous\r\nrevolutions have prevented their construction. The one from Bogotá to\r\nFacatativá, our first objective point on the way to the Magdalena, is\r\nonly twenty-five miles in length. There is, however, a well-grounded\r\nhope that this can at an early day be connected with the line that is\r\nbuilding from Girardot. [218] When this shall have been accomplished\r\nit will be possible to reach Bogotá without the long overland ride on\r\nhorse- or mule-back that has been necessary since the time of Quesada.\r\n\r\nBut far from regretting the lack of a through train to the Magdalena,\r\nwe were rather glad that we were obliged to have recourse to a\r\nless expeditious mode of locomotion. It required more time, it\r\nis true, to make the trip, and was more fatiguing, but it gave us\r\nan opportunity of seeing the country to greater advantage and of\r\ngetting better acquainted with its people. Indeed, the journey down\r\nthe Cordillera from Bogotá to Honda was but the proper complement of\r\nthat from the llanos up to the Sabana that lies at the foot of the\r\nnation's capital. It gave us an opportunity of comparing conditions\r\non the eastern slope of the Oriental Andes with those prevailing on\r\nthe western, and we have always considered ourselves fortunate in\r\nhaving been able to explore from the saddle the interesting country\r\nthat lies between the Meta and the Magdalena. As I now think, it was,\r\nin many respects, the most delightful and instructive part of our\r\nwanderings in South America.\r\n\r\nThe track and rolling-stock of the Sabana railway are, as might\r\nbe expected, of the most primitive kind. The roadbed has received\r\nlittle attention, and the cars and engine are scarcely fit for\r\nservice. But all this can be condoned when one is familiar with the\r\nuntoward conditions that, for so many years, have militated against\r\nimprovements of all kinds. The transportation of the rails, cars and\r\nlocomotives from Cambao, on the Magdalena, to the plateau, when the\r\ncart road between the two points was little better than a bridle-path,\r\nwas in itself a Herculean task, and as we journeyed to Honda, it never\r\nceased to excite our wonder. Great improvements, however, are promised\r\nas soon as connection shall be made with the branch, now approaching\r\ncompletion, from Girardot. Then the transportation of heavy freight\r\nwill be a trifling task in comparison with what it has been hitherto.\r\n\r\nThe Sabana of Bogotá resembles somewhat the plain of Caracas except\r\nthat it is far more extensive than the Venezuelan plateau. Both\r\nhave been regarded as the beds of lakes that have long since\r\ndisappeared. Whatever may be said about the existence of a lake in the\r\nvale of Caracas, it seems now quite certain that there never was any\r\ngreat body of water, such as has so long been imagined, occupying the\r\nregion now known as the Sabana de Bogotá. [219] Recent investigations\r\nappear to have decided this much-debated question against Humboldt\r\nand those who accepted his views regarding this matter.\r\n\r\nWe were much interested in the haciendas through which the\r\ntrain passed, as well as in the homes of their owners and in\r\nthe picturesque villages along the road. There were broad acres\r\ndevoted to the cultivation of wheat, barley, maize and potatoes,\r\nand extensive pastures, over which roamed large flocks of sheep\r\nand herds of cattle. These cattle, so we fancied, were the lineal\r\ndescendants of those brought to Española by Columbus at the time of\r\nhis second voyage. And the swine we saw--there could be little doubt\r\nabout it--could claim, as their ancestors, those which Belalcazar had\r\nbrought with him from Quito, as the hens, that cackled and clucked as\r\nwe sped by, were the offspring of those carefully guarded by Federmann\r\nduring his famous expedition from Coro to Santa Fe de Bogotá. [220]\r\n\r\nAside from the Humboldt oak, with its majestic crown of ever-green\r\nfoliage, and the ubiquitous Eucalyptus, there are no trees of\r\nany magnitude in the Sabana. Its flora, however, is particularly\r\nrich in shrubs and plants. Among them were the beautiful passion\r\nflower, Passiflora Antioquensis, blossoming the year round, and\r\na peculiar species of blackberry--Rubus Bogotensis--ever clothed\r\nwith a vari-colored mantle of snow-white bloom and ripening fruit,\r\nrealizing Shelley's idea of the millennium, where\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Fruits are ever ripe, and flowers ever fair.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meadows are carpeted with various species of clover and succulent\r\ngrasses, and, along the hedges and walls, one finds an endless variety\r\nof fuchsias, verbenas, mallows, asters, buttercups, lupines, lilies,\r\nlobelias, irises, morning-glories and passion flowers. The last two\r\nplants and certain varieties of roses are great favorites in the\r\ngarden and around the house, as are also violets, pinks, jasmines and\r\nheliotropes. We observed several habitations, some of them the humble\r\ncots of poor Chibchas, that were almost concealed in magnificent\r\nbowers of climbing clematis, passion flowers and morning-glories.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern slope of Suma Paz, we frequently had occasion to admire\r\nthe wealth and brilliancy of bloom around some of the homes which we\r\npassed, or when we enjoyed the hospitality of their courteous inmates,\r\nbut nowhere did we see more beautiful floral exhibits than greeted\r\nus on the Sabana de Bogotá.\r\n\r\nMuch, however, as we were interested in the fauna and flora of\r\nthis region, and the people who now inhabit it, we found our minds\r\nconstantly reverting to pre-Colombian times, and picturing to ourselves\r\nthe condition of this plain and its inhabitants at the period of the\r\narrival of the conquistadores.\r\n\r\nWhen Quesada and his intrepid followers reached this beautiful\r\nplateau, they found it inhabited by a tribe of Indians to whom they\r\ngave the name Muiscas, because they frequently heard them pronounce\r\nthis word, or Moscas, a Spanish word, similar in sound, signifying\r\nflies, because they said these Indians were as numerous as flies. [221]\r\n\r\nThey occupied the tablelands in the central part of New Granada. The\r\nterritory under the jurisdiction of their zipas--chiefs--was elliptical\r\nin form and equaled in area the kingdom of the Netherlands. They\r\nnumbered about one million inhabitants, and, according to the early\r\nchroniclers, they counted no fewer than a hundred and thirty thousand\r\nwarriors. The number of fighting men was doubtless far below this\r\nfigure. It seems certain, however, that at the date of the arrival\r\nof the Spaniards they were in the apogee of their power, and were\r\nmaking progress towards a condition of culture approaching that of\r\nthe Aztecs and Incas.\r\n\r\nThe dominions of the last zipas of Bacatá extended from Simijaca\r\nto Pasca and from Zipacon to the llanos. Although united by ties\r\nof language and beliefs, customs and laws, similar in character and\r\nrevealing a common origin, they formed an aggregation of small states,\r\ngenerally independent, rather than a compact and well-organized\r\ncommonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe Chibchas, or Muiscas, were preëminently an agricultural\r\npeople. They had no domestic animals, except the dog--not even the\r\nllama. Their chief articles of food were maize, potatoes [222] and\r\nquinoa, which the natives of Colombia have long since discarded for\r\nrice. Besides these staples they had many other vegetables peculiar to\r\nthe country and a great variety of luscious and wholesome fruits. They\r\nalso had game in abundance.\r\n\r\nThey cultivated cotton, from which they made their clothing, the\r\nmaterial of which often exhibited various colored designs. In this\r\nrespect they were far in advance of the surrounding tribes, who had\r\nno more to cover them than have the wildest children of the tropical\r\nforest to-day.\r\n\r\nTheir houses were of wood, with thatched roofs not unlike many\r\nof those we saw along our route from the llanos to the Magdalena\r\nvalley. When the Spaniards arrived they had just begun to use stone\r\nin the erection of a few of their buildings, presumably temples,\r\nwhich apparently were never completed.\r\n\r\nAs might be surmised, their commerce was limited. They bartered to\r\nsome extent with the neighboring tribes, especially those west of\r\nthe Magdalena. From these they obtained gold in exchange for salt,\r\nemeralds and textile fabrics. With the Chimus of Peru, they were the\r\nfirst to use gold as a medium of exchange. Their currency consisted not\r\nof stamped coins, but of disks of the precious metal without any kind\r\nof marking. They had a limited intercourse with the people of Quito\r\nand had some slight knowledge of the great Inca kingdom farther south.\r\n\r\nRegarding the culture of the Chibchas, we can say what the Marquis de\r\nNadaillac says of the people in general--\"We know very little.\" [223]\r\nBut we know enough to be warranted in affirming that many erroneous\r\nnotions have long prevailed concerning them, and that the claims\r\nthat have been made for them as a civilized people have been greatly\r\nexaggerated.\r\n\r\nAccording to Duquesne--to whose fanciful theories the great Humboldt\r\nunfortunately gave his support--and to the school that for a century\r\nmade Duquesne's views their own, the Chibchas were acquainted with\r\nthe use of the quipus, and had a system of numbers and hieroglyphics\r\nand a complicated calendar. Their priests were represented as the\r\ndepositaries of astrological and chronological science, and as experts\r\nin astronomical and meteorological observations. The people were\r\nlauded for their advanced knowledge of architecture and praised for\r\ntheir courts of justice. In the temple of Sogamuxi, they would have\r\nus believe, were preserved the national annals and the chronicles of\r\ntheir civilization. Their general material progress and intellectual\r\nstatus was commented on as something quite comparable with the best\r\nthat obtained in Mexico or Cuzco.\r\n\r\nWe have but two sources of information respecting the much-debated\r\nquestion of Chibcha culture. These are a comparative study of the early\r\nchronicles--no one or two of them will suffice--and an examination\r\nof the few stone monuments the Chibchas have left us, together with\r\ntheir pictographs, ceramic ware and objects of gold and copper found\r\nin their places of sepulture. The chronicles that we must rely on are\r\nthose left us by Quesada, Castellanos, Padre Simon and Piedrahita,\r\nall of which have already been quoted, together with those left us\r\nby Padre Bernardo Lugo, Juan Rodriguez Fresle, a son of one of the\r\nconquistadores, and Fray Alonso de Zamora, of Bogotá.\r\n\r\nAs a result of a critical study of these chronicles and monuments, the\r\ndistinguished Colombian writer, Don Vicente Restrepo, has demonstrated\r\nthat most of the claims that have been made for Chibcha culture are\r\nutterly devoid of foundation in fact. His conclusions, which can be\r\ngiven in a few words, are:--\r\n\r\n\"The Chibchas had no stone buildings and their knowledge of\r\narchitecture was therefore limited to the erection of the simplest\r\nstructures of wood.\r\n\r\n\"They had no quipus, like that of the Incas, no alphabet,\r\nand no writing of any kind, either figurative, symbolic or\r\nideographic. Neither had they any chronology or archives.\r\n\r\n\"The petroglyphs and pictographs found in limited [224] numbers in\r\nvarious parts of the country, far from recording the migrations and\r\nhunts of the aborigines and the cataclysms which they are supposed to\r\nhave witnessed, are nothing more than rude geometrical designs and\r\nfantastic figures which are repeated in the most confused manner,\r\naccording to the infantile caprice of the one who carved or painted\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nConcluding his discussion of these meaningless figures, which certain\r\nwriters have so long insisted were true hieroglyphics, awaiting\r\nsome Champollion or Rawlinson to decipher, Sr. Restrepo does not\r\nhesitate to assert that the rude \"attempts at drawing these ill-formed\r\nfigures of animals, and these pothooks, similar to those traced by\r\nan inexperienced child, can reveal nothing to historic science. They\r\nnever exhibit that order and sequence which are the certain index\r\nof genuine writing. They never reproduce even the simplest scenes\r\nof Indian life, such for example as a religious ceremony, the chase,\r\nor warriors fighting.\r\n\r\n\"Mute by reason of their origin, and condemned to eternal silence by\r\nthe unconscious hand that traced them, the magic wand of science will\r\nnever be able to make them speak.\" [225]\r\n\r\nIf we accept the classification and definitions of the various grades\r\nof culture, as given by Morgan in his great work on Ancient Society,\r\n[226] as many profound thinkers do, we shall be forced to conclude\r\nnot only that the Chibchas were not civilized, but that they had not\r\neven reached the upper status of barbarism.\r\n\r\nCivilization implies the existence of a phonetic alphabet or, at least,\r\nof hieroglyphics akin to those of the Egyptians, and the use of these\r\nin the production of written records. The Chibchas, as we have seen,\r\nhad neither an alphabet nor written records of any kind.\r\n\r\nNeither had they any knowledge of the process of smelting iron ore. As\r\nthe use of iron is the chief characteristic of the third, or upper,\r\nperiod of barbarism, the Chibchas, according to Morgan, should be\r\nconsidered as representatives of the middle status of barbarism,\r\nlike the Zuñis and the Mayas, or like the lake-dwellers of ancient\r\nSwitzerland, or the early Britons before they learned the use of iron\r\nfrom their more advanced neighbors in Gaul. [227]\r\n\r\nIt took us two hours to make the run from Bogotá to Facatativá, the\r\nwestern terminus of the Sabana railway. Here we took luncheon. For\r\na place that has so long been the centre of traffic between the\r\ncapital and the Magdalena, the town has no reason to boast of its\r\nrestaurants or hotels. They are about as poor in every way as could\r\nwell be imagined. A town in Italy or Switzerland, frequented by so\r\nmany travelers as Facatativá, would have not one but several hostelries\r\nwhere its patrons would have every convenience and comfort. Let us hope\r\nthat Colombia will soon witness an improvement in this respect, not\r\nonly in this place but all along the chief lines of travel. It is much\r\nneeded, and along no route more than that connecting Bogotá with Honda.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the conquest, Facatativá was a Muisca stronghold,\r\nand what are said to be the ruins of an old Indian fortress are still\r\nshown to the curious visitor. One may also see some rocks on which are\r\ncarved certain figures long supposed to be Chibcha hieroglyphics. We\r\nhave already learned what value is to be ascribed to these and similar\r\ninscriptions in other parts of the country.\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon we prepared to start for Chimbe, where we intended to\r\npass the night. We had telegraphed the day before to our arriero to\r\nhave in readiness the necessary saddle and sumpter mules. They were\r\nwaiting for us on our arrival and we were much gratified to find\r\nthat both animals and peons were all that could be desired. Those\r\nwho have traveled in the Andes know how important it is to have good\r\nmules and servants, and how much it adds to the comfort and pleasure\r\nof one's journey.\r\n\r\nFrom the time we had left our launch on the Meta, we had been\r\nsingularly fortunate in always having good animals and honest, reliable\r\nmen to take care of them and attend to our wants on the way. To our\r\ndevoted and watchful muleteers and their assistants we owed much of\r\nthe enjoyment that was ours during our wanderings over mountain and\r\nplain, and we shall always hold their obliging disposition and prompt\r\nservice in grateful remembrance.\r\n\r\nIt affords me special pleasure to render them this tribute, as they\r\nare often, I have reason to believe, much misunderstood, especially\r\nby people who are not familiar with their language, and frequently\r\nheld responsible for delays and contretemps of which they are in no\r\nwise responsible. Judging by our own experience, the arieros and\r\npeons of South America are, as a class, far better than they are\r\nusually represented and are deserving of more recognition and better\r\ntreatment than is usually accorded them by those who require their\r\nhumble but often too poorly recompensed services.\r\n\r\nThe saddle generally used in the mountains closely resembles the\r\nMcClellan saddle and is called a galápago. For obvious reasons an\r\nEnglish hunting saddle--silla--could not be used where the roads are\r\nconstantly leading up and down steep mountains--bergauf, bergab, as\r\na German traveler phrases it--and where even on a cavalry saddle it\r\nis at times extremely difficult for one to retain one's position. [228]\r\n\r\nThe saddle is usually covered by a pellon or shabrack, made either\r\nof sheepskin, or horsehair dyed black and neatly braided at the\r\nends. Attached to the saddle are several bags or pockets--bolsas. These\r\nare of the greatest convenience for carrying many things necessary on\r\nlong journeys. In them the natives stow away cheese, cakes of maize,\r\npapelon, and the never-forgotten supply of aguardiente, without which\r\na journey of any length is considered impossible.\r\n\r\nThe stirrups are curiosities. They are usually of brass or bronze in\r\nthe shape of a shoe, but frequently they are in the form of the basket\r\nhilt of a claymore. The stirrups of one of the saddles I used were\r\ncuriously embossed, and as large as a good-sized bell. But whatever\r\ntheir design, they are admirably adapted for service in the mountains\r\nwhere the paths are so narrow that one is frequently exposed, without\r\nsuch protection, to having one's feet crushed when his mule approaches\r\ntoo near the rocky wall that flanks one side of the road. The danger\r\nis especially great when one meets a herd of cattle or a caravan\r\nof pack-mules. Then the rider suddenly finds his mule crushing him\r\nagainst the steep rocks on one side of the path, to avoid being thrown\r\nover a precipice which is yawning beneath him on the other side along\r\nwhich the approaching animals pick their way with a skill that is\r\nmarvelous. We often had reason to be thankful that our feet were\r\nprotected by these fantastic and cumbersome estribos--stirrups--as\r\notherwise we should have suffered serious bodily injury. Like the\r\nleather hoods of wooden stirrups, such estribos also keep the feet dry.\r\n\r\nThe riding equipment, however, of a Colombian horseman is not complete\r\nwithout huge brass or bronze rowel-spurs--espuelas--and a pair of\r\nzamoros--bag-trousers--often made of leather or goatskin. They are\r\nnot unlike the chaparejos [229] of a New Mexican cowboy, and serve\r\nas a protection against rain and mud, and the thorns of the shrubs\r\nand brush along the wayside.\r\n\r\nFrom Facatativá to El Alto del Roble, some miles to the west, the\r\nroad slightly rises. At the latter point, nearly five hundred feet\r\nabove Bogotá, one has a glorious view of the Sabana, of the chain of\r\nSuma Paz, and of the Central Cordillera away beyond the Magdalena.\r\n\r\nFrom El Roble--the oak--so named from the number of ever-green oaks\r\nseen there, the descent towards Chimbe is marked by quite a steep\r\ngrade. A good carretera, or carriage road, extends from Factativá to\r\nAgua Larga, and this much-needed highway is to be prolonged as far\r\nas the Magdalena. The present plan is to construct the road in such\r\nwise that traction cars can be used on it for the transportation of\r\nboth freight and passengers, and at the time of our passage the road,\r\nunder the direction of English engineers, was being pushed forward\r\ntowards completion with a display of energy that augured well for\r\nultimate success.\r\n\r\nOnly a few minutes after we began our descent on the western declivity\r\nof El Roble we observed a change in the temperature. We were passing\r\nfrom the tierra fría to the tierra templada, and a thermometer was\r\nscarcely necessary to indicate our rate of progress towards lower\r\naltitudes. Aside from the marked change in the atmosphere, there was\r\na corresponding one in the flora.\r\n\r\nNear the summit of El Roble we were gratified in finding large\r\npatches of strawberries. They were sweet reminders of home, as they\r\nwere of the same species as our own fragrant Fragaria. These slender\r\nmountain runners did not, however, bear the large fruits afforded\r\nby our Illinois or Florida plants, but rather the small scarlet,\r\nbut richly flavored, berries one meets in an uncultivated state in\r\nItaly and Russia.\r\n\r\nFurther on our way we came across another reminder of our own\r\ncountry. This time it appeared in the form of long, dark-gray tufts\r\nand festoons of that curious epiphyte--Tillandsia usneoides--popularly\r\nknown in the Gulf States as Spanish moss and in Jamaica as old man's\r\nbeard. The natives in Colombia call it barba de palo--tree-beard--a\r\nmuch more picturesque epithet than any of those mentioned, and another\r\none of countless instances of the wonderful faculty the Indian has of\r\ngiving expressive names to the objects that specially strike his fancy.\r\n\r\nAs we reached a still lower level, our attention was arrested by\r\nthe beauty and luxuriance of the palms and tree ferns that graced\r\nour path. The fern trees were as remarkable for their size as for\r\nthe delicacy of their plume-like fronds. The trunks of some of them\r\nwere twelve to fifteen feet high and the leaves of their wondrous\r\ncrowns--like veritable leaves of emerald gauze--were at times as long\r\nas the trunk was high. Gazing at these bizarre forms of vegetable\r\nlife, with their dark, rough, leaf-scarred trunks, so unlike those of\r\nsurrounding trees, we could easily imagine ourselves in a forest of\r\nthose giant paleozoic Sigillariæ and Lepidodendrons that contributed\r\nso largely towards the formation of the lower coal measures.\r\n\r\nWe never made any attempt to enumerate the divers species of palms that\r\nwere ever in view from the paramo to the ocean. But wherever we saw\r\nthem, whether on the elevated Andean plateau or in the humid valleys\r\nof the Orinoco and the Magdalena, they were for us, as they were for\r\nLinnæus, \"the princes of the vegetable world.\" Decked with a mantle of\r\neternal youth, with smooth, straight trunks like the marble shafts of\r\nAthens or Palmyra, they were not only the glory of forest and savanna,\r\nbut they were also for us, as for Martius, a symbol of immortality.\r\n\r\nAt Agua Larga our road bifurcated, the new and better branch veering\r\noff to the right at a slight angle, and the old one continuing with\r\na similar turn to the left. Although a bright young señorita, who\r\nhappened to be near the parting of the ways, declared that the old\r\nroad was the one that led to Chimbe, our objective point, we chose the\r\nnew one, and for the first time since we had left the Meta, we went\r\nastray. We did not discover our error until we had gone several miles,\r\nwhen an old man, who was repairing his humble cot by the wayside,\r\ncorroborated the señorita's information.\r\n\r\nThere was then nothing left for us but to retrace our steps. The\r\nmistake was quite a blow to the topographical instinct of one of our\r\nparty, who had, during our long trip, particularly prided himself on\r\nthe unerring indications of his organ of locality, which rendered,\r\nhe said, the assistance of a guide superfluous. At the same time,\r\nit was quite trying to the patience of all of us, as we were tired,\r\nhungry, and wished to arrive at Chimbe before sundown. It was now\r\nquite evident that we could not possibly reach our destination before\r\nnightfall. We then realized to our sorrow the truth of Balboa's words,\r\nwhen writing to the King of Spain--\"Llega el hombre hasta donde puede\r\ny no hasta donde quiere\"--One goes as far as one can and not as far\r\nas one wishes to go. And, recalling what the señorita had told us,\r\nwe had likewise a forcible reminder of the verity of Sancho Panza's\r\nsaying: \"Though a woman's counsel isn't worth much, he that despises\r\nit is no wiser than he should be.\"\r\n\r\nAfter getting back to the bifurcation of the road, we found that the\r\nolder branch, which we should have taken, was little better than a\r\nrough, rocky stairway, the steps of which had been rendered extremely\r\nslippery by a heavy rainfall a few hours before. C., our dashing\r\nand debonair cavalier, was still suffering from the effects of this\r\ndownpour, for having lost his waterproof sombrero, specially designed\r\nfor travel in the tropics, he had nothing left but a light straw hat,\r\nwhich afforded the head no more protection than a sieve.\r\n\r\nTruth to tell, he was suspected of intentionally discarding his\r\nwaterproof headgear, as, in his estimation, it did not comport with\r\nthe dignity of a caballero who would trace his lineage back to one\r\nof the noblest grandees of Spain, and who, during his journey from\r\nTrinidad, had been the recipient of special attention from young\r\nand old as well. He seemed to be the special favorite of well-to-do\r\nmatrons, particularly in the towns and cities in which our sojourn\r\nwas somewhat protracted. Was it that they would fain have seen in\r\nthe handsome young traveler a prospective son-in-law? Not being a\r\nmind reader, I must leave the question unanswered. As a veracious\r\nnarrator of occurrences by the way I can only state facts and let\r\nthe reader draw his own conclusions.\r\n\r\nBut what a road it was, that now lay between us and Chimbe! To us, in\r\nthe declining rays of the setting sun, it appeared like a cobblestone\r\ntrack after it had passed through a dozen earthquakes and had then been\r\nset at an angle of forty-five degrees with the horizon. [230] Even\r\nour mules, which were usually prepared for any kind of a path where\r\nthey could find a foothold, frequently balked at the more difficult\r\nsections of this much-neglected highway. Comparing the part we were\r\nnow traversing with the more improved road we had left at Agua Larga,\r\nwe could not but recall the words of an Irish engineer, regarding\r\ncertain highland roads, as recorded in Scott's A Legend of Montrose:--\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Had you but seen those roads before they were made,\r\n    You would have held up your hands and blessed General Wade.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet this was the camino real, the royal highway from the Magdalena\r\nto the national capital. President Reyes was doubtless right when he\r\npublicly stated, some years ago, that it was now in a worse condition\r\nthan it was before the War of Independence.\r\n\r\nBut it was also, and this afforded us some compensation for our\r\ndiscomfort, the Muisca trail--the same that the subjects of the\r\nZipa of Bacatá and those of the Caciques of Hunsa and Sugamuxi made\r\nuse of during their bartering expeditions to the tribes beyond the\r\nMagdalena. Along this trail they, for generations, carried their stores\r\nof salt, textile fabrics and emeralds, and brought back, in exchange\r\nfor them, from the placers of what is now known as Antioquia, those\r\ntreasures of gold that so excited the cupidity of the conquistadores,\r\nand which, by many of them, were considered as an adequate reward\r\nfor all the hardships they had endured to secure their possession.\r\n\r\nFinally, after a long, tiresome breakneck ride over that \"royal\"\r\nbut infinitely rugged road--\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Arduus, obliquus, caligine densus opaca,--\" [231]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Chimbe where, fortunately, we found an appetizing repast,\r\nand what we were then willing to consider clean and comfortable beds,\r\nawaiting us.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning, after a refreshing sleep, we were again in\r\nthe saddle and on our way to Guaduas, where we purposed spending\r\nthe night. After a brisk ride of a few hours through a picturesque\r\ncountry, we reached the town of Villeta, situated in a charming and\r\nfertile valley. Here we had a hasty breakfast and were then on our\r\nway up the prolonged and precipitous slopes of Cune and Petaquero.\r\n\r\nThe Muisca trail, like the path we followed from the llanos to the\r\nSabana de Bogotá, was to us an interesting example of the manner in\r\nwhich the Indians traced out their roads. Having neither blasting\r\npowder nor dynamite, they were perforce obliged to go around the\r\nrocks that were in their way. But in spite of this, owing to their\r\nthorough familiarity with the country, they always succeeded in\r\nfinding the shortest routes from one point to another. They made\r\nit a rule, however, never to get far away from a water supply, and,\r\nfor this reason, their roads nearly always kept close to the water\r\ncourses of the regions through which they passed. The conquistadores,\r\nwho had to be always on the alert against the Indians, and who took\r\nevery precaution against surprise and ambuscade, avoided swamps and\r\nlowlands, and kept rather to the commanding ridges of the country\r\non their line of march. As a consequence, the best roads in Colombia\r\nto-day are those traced out by the old Muisca traders and by Quesada in\r\nthe north and Robledo, Almaguer and Belalcazar in the west and south.\r\n\r\nOn our way to Guaduas from Chimbe, we observed a number of small\r\nplantations of sugar cane, and near by there was usually a trapiche,\r\na primitive contrivance for extracting the juice from the cane. It\r\nconsisted of a thatched shed under which was a cumbersome, creaking\r\nmachine consisting essentially of three vertical cylinders of wood\r\nwhich were kept in motion by a span of mules or a yoke of oxen driven\r\nby a boy. The cane was fed into the machine by a couple of women,\r\nand the juice was received into a wooden trough. From this it was\r\ntransferred into a boiler, if panela--crude sugar--was desired. More\r\nfrequently, however, it was conveyed to a still, in order to be\r\nconverted into aguardiente, a crude distillate, rich in alcohol,\r\nof which the natives, the country over, consume large quantities.\r\n\r\nBut fond as the inhabitants are of aguardiente, and guarapo, the\r\nfermented juice of the sugar cane, or a mixture of sugar and water\r\nwhich has undergone fermentation, the most popular drink, especially\r\namong the poorer classes, is chicha. This is to the greater part\r\nof South America what pulque is to Mexico and beer to Germany--the\r\nnational beverage. It has been so from time immemorial. Chicha was as\r\nmuch esteemed by the Muiscas, before the arrival of the Spaniards,\r\nas it is to-day; for then, as now, no festivity or celebration was\r\nconsidered complete without a liberal supply of this enlivening\r\npotation.\r\n\r\nPadre Rivero, referring to the love of drink, especially of chicha,\r\namong the Indians, says, \"Drink is their life, their glory, and the\r\nacme of their happiness.\" The earlier historians have much to say\r\nof the frightful orgies, as the result of over-indulgence in chicha,\r\nthat obtained among all classes on the occasions of national festivals,\r\nor the celebration of a victory over an enemy. It is said to be used to\r\nexcess to-day, as much as in former times, but of this I cannot speak\r\nfrom personal observation. All the way from Villavicencio to Honda,\r\nwe saw countless estancos and estanquitos--licensed bars--of the type\r\nof our lowest dram shops, where chicha is the principal drink sold;\r\nbut, although we saw many people, men and women, congregated about\r\nthese places, we never saw a single case of drunkenness or any serious\r\ndisturbance of any kind. This was not because no one had been drinking\r\nwhile we were present. All had been imbibing more or less freely, but\r\nthey seemed so accustomed to the use of their favorite beverages that\r\nthey were no more affected by them than are the people of France and\r\nItaly by the drinking of the wines of their respective countries. [232]\r\n\r\nFrom what, the reader will ask, and how, is chicha prepared? It is\r\nmade from Indian corn and by an extremely simple process. It is,\r\nindeed, the same method as was employed before the conquest.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the grains of maize are moistened by water and allowed\r\nto sprout, just as barley is treated in the manufacture of beer. After\r\nthis the product is dried and roasted in a large earthen jar. Then by\r\nmeans of a piedra de molar--a kind of crude mortar--like the metate,\r\nwhich the Mexican uses for reducing maize to meal, the grains are\r\nground, and then put into hot water and allowed to ferment. As a result\r\nof germination and the action of hot water, the starch of the maize\r\nis converted into sugar. This, by fermentation, is next changed into\r\nalcohol, which gives to chicha its intoxicating property. This is less\r\nnoxious than that which is produced by boiling the maize and adding to\r\nthe chicha thus obtained a certain amount of panela, or molasses. [233]\r\n\r\nWhen properly prepared, it is an agreeable and wholesome drink,\r\nnot unlike cider or light beer. I have frequently seen it used at\r\nmeals by the best families--people who would never think of serving\r\nat their table a harmful or intoxicating beverage. Bürger, I know,\r\ncondemns it, because he asserts it is rich in fusel oil, and because,\r\nhe maintains, it has a brutalizing effect on those who use it as a\r\nbeverage. Not having seen a reliable chemical analysis of chicha,\r\nI am not prepared to accept his view of the subject. The same writer,\r\nit may be remarked, decries cassava bread, because, he will have it,\r\nit is composed for the most part of cellulose.\r\n\r\nOn our way from Villeta to Guaduas, we were obliged to pass two\r\nlofty mountain crests, El Alto del Trigo and El Alto del Raizal. It\r\nwas then again for the hundredth time that we admired the sagacity\r\nof the mule, and the importance of having one that is familiar with\r\nservice in the mountains. If the camel deserves the epithet--\"ship of\r\nthe desert,\" the mule is entitled to being considered the aeroplane\r\nof the mountains. For the way he scales the highest peaks, almost\r\nrivaling the condor in the altitudes he is capable of attaining,\r\nand the manner in which he, with perfect security, glides along\r\nthe narrow, dizzy paths of the precipitous mountain slopes, is a\r\nmatter of ever-increasing wonder. We never, I confess, became quite\r\nreconciled to the habit all mules have of keeping on the side of the\r\npath next to the precipice--except when they meet animals coming from\r\nthe opposite direction, when they instinctively crowd closely to the\r\nover-hanging mountain--but we soon learned that the mule had as much\r\ncare for his safety as we had for our own, and then the danger, we at\r\nfirst so much dreaded, became more apparent than real. It is curious,\r\nbut a fact, that a mule left to himself will almost always follow in\r\nthe footsteps made by his predecessor, and no persuasion can induce\r\nhim to deviate from the beaten path. So regular and so constant is\r\nhis pace that one could almost determine in advance the number of\r\nsteps he will make from one point to another.\r\n\r\nHe rarely stumbles and still more rarely does he fall. And no matter\r\nhow deep may be the chasm along whose brink he carefully feels his\r\nway, he never suffers from vertigo nor makes a false step. Certain\r\ntravelers tell us blood-curdling stories about their mules losing\r\ntheir balance and plunging headlong into dark, deep ravines, but\r\nduring all my travels among the Andes, I never heard of such a thing\r\nand, from what I know of the supreme carefulness of the mule when\r\nin dangerous places, such an accident seems most unlikely. If he is\r\noverloaded, he files a protest by lying down and refusing to rise until\r\nrelieved of a part of his burden. Occasionally, too, when he reaches\r\na suitable level spot, he may take it into his head to have a roll,\r\nand he incontinently proceeds to gratify this inclination before his\r\nrider is aware of his intention.\r\n\r\nI recall particularly how disconcerted and disgusted C. was on one\r\noccasion, when his mule, on arriving at a specially dusty place in\r\nthe road, lay down without giving the slightest notice of his purpose\r\nand proceeded to take a roll, before his rider was able to extricate\r\nhimself from his uncomfortable position. For a proud caballero who,\r\nwhen he happened to be the cynosure of a group of admiring señoritas\r\nand faded dames of quality, would fain pose as a scion of Castilian\r\nnobility, this was an indignity that merited condign punishment. The\r\nconsequence was that whenever, thereafter, C. noticed a suspicious\r\nmovement in his mount, he forthwith proceeded to ply him with a tough,\r\npliable rod from a coffee bush, which had the effect of distracting, at\r\nleast temporarily, the mule's attention to matters of greater moment.\r\n\r\nAmong the many objects that were to us a source of constant wonder\r\nand delight in the tropics were the butterflies. We met them in\r\ncountless species in the most unexpected places, especially during\r\nour journeyings in the lower altitudes. Here we found them of the most\r\nbrilliant hues and of every color of the spectrum. In some districts,\r\nas for instance between the Nevada de Santa Marta and the sea, there\r\nare at times clouds of them, and their number is then comparable only\r\nwith the millions of medusæ that people certain parts of the ocean. At\r\ntimes owing to their prodigious numbers and their gorgeous colors,\r\none could, without a great stretch of the imagination, fancy one's\r\nself gazing at fluttering bits of a shattered rainbow. The largest\r\nand most beautiful is the Morpho Cypris, having an expanse of wing of\r\nfully six inches, a bright cobalt-blue above, and ocellated underneath.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hettner, [234] the people around Muso, where the\r\ncelebrated emerald mines are located, will have it that there is a\r\nmysterious relationship between the mineral emeralds buried in the\r\nearth and \"animal emeralds\" that flit through the air. How like the\r\nfancy of the aborigines of Trinidad--that the glittering colibris\r\nformerly occurring in such numbers in that island were the souls of\r\ndeparted Indians!\r\n\r\nQuite rivaling the butterflies in splendor and adornment are the\r\nbeauteous humming birds that are met with from ocean level to mountain\r\nsummit. Poets and naturalists have essayed in vain to portray their\r\nmarvelous richness of coloring and their magic evolutions as they dart\r\nfrom flower to flower, or balance themselves above some bright fragrant\r\ncorolla while drawing from it its precious nectar. As well might the\r\npainter try to transfer to canvas the glories of the setting sun as\r\nto copy the iridescent hues of such glowing mites of the feathered\r\ntribe as the Ruby Throat or the Fiery Topaz. Truly, they as well as\r\nthe noted paradiseines of New Guinea should come under the expressive\r\ndesignation of birds of Paradise. [235]\r\n\r\nAfter a hard day's ride we reached Guaduas just as the sun had dropped\r\nbehind the mountain to the west. Guaduas in Spanish signifies bamboos,\r\nand the town was given this name on account of the large number of\r\nthese giant, tree-like grasses that formerly grew in and about the\r\nplace. Even now numerous clumps of bamboo may be seen here, especially\r\nalong the many water courses which intersect the delightful valley\r\nin which the town is located.\r\n\r\nIt is really remarkable for how many purposes the bamboo is used in\r\nthe equatorial regions. It is employed in building houses, bridges,\r\nrafts, fences, for making planks, beams, rafters, bedsteads, benches,\r\ntables, buckets and small vessels for holding molasses, aguardiente\r\nand other fluids, and for various other domestic utensils too numerous\r\nto mention. Indeed, to the poorer classes of the Colombian Andes, it\r\nis almost as useful as is the banana plant to the native of Uganda,\r\nwho contrives to get from it everything he uses except meat and iron.\r\n\r\nIn the plaza of the town there is a monument erected to the patriotic\r\nheroine, Policarpa Salavarrieta, who was shot in Bogotá during\r\nthe War of Independence, by order of the viceroy, for the part\r\nshe took in assisting those who were fighting against the mother\r\ncountry. Throughout Colombia her memory is held in benediction, and\r\nthe story of her tragic death has been a favorite theme for poet and\r\nhistorian as well.\r\n\r\nOur first view of Guaduas, in its charming setting of perennial\r\nverdure, illumined by the crimson glow of the setting sun, was a\r\npicture of surpassing charm. It bodied forth all the tranquillity,\r\nverdancy and loveliness which Humboldt found in Ibague than which\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Nil quietius, nil muscosius, nil amoenius.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spell was broken, however, when we entered the town. We then\r\nfound to our regret that it was another of so many instances where\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Distance lends enchantment to the view.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSo favorably situated and with so agreeable a climate, it could\r\neasily be made one of the most delightful places of residence in the\r\nrepublic. Let us hope that this is what it shall be in the approaching\r\ndawn of a new era.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Bogotá, we had been told by a noted English traveler\r\nto be on the lookout for a remarkable view towards the west, from the\r\nsummit of El Alto del Sargento. \"Be sure not to miss it,\" he said, \"for\r\nfrom that point you will behold one of the most magnificent panoramas\r\nin the world.\" We were at first inclined to regard this statement as\r\nthe usual exaggeration of the tourist, but were, nevertheless, eager\r\nto contemplate a prospect so famed for beauty and sublimity. [236]\r\n\r\nIn order to reach the crest of the mountain, before the clouds\r\ngathered about El Sargento, which usually occurs about midday, we\r\nmade an early start from our posada, where we had found commodious\r\nand fairly comfortable quarters, and were soon on our way up the\r\nlast of the Serranias--mountain ridges--that separated us from the\r\nMagdalena valley.\r\n\r\nIt was about eleven o'clock when we arrived at the summit of El\r\nSargento. We had just rounded a tree-covered eminence, that concealed\r\nthe view towards the west, when all of a sudden, there burst upon\r\nour vision, what was, to me at least, the most superb spectacle I\r\nhad ever contemplated. C. and I instinctively stood still in silent\r\nrapture. As the picture appeared to us, it surpassed by far all\r\nthat had been said in its praise. Not even half the truth had been\r\ntold. Our emotion was too great for words, and, as we paused in mute\r\nadmiration, one of us at least recalled a similar experience enjoyed\r\nby three other travelers in the Guadarrama mountains of Spain. It is\r\nthus recorded in Longfellow's The Spanish Student: [237]\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Victorian. This is the highest point.\r\n               Here let us rest.\r\n        See, Preciosa, see how all about us,\r\n        Kneeling, like hooded friars, the misty mountains\r\n        Receive the benediction of the sun.\r\n        O glorious sight!\r\n\r\n        Preciosa. Most beautiful indeed!\r\n\r\n        Hypolito. Most wonderful!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foreground beneath our feet, was the wooded slope of\r\nEl Sargento. In the distance, near the mountain's base, were the\r\npicturesque towns of San Juan and Ambalema. Further on, like an immense\r\nopalescent band, was the meandering Magdalena. Beyond it were the\r\nbroad plains of Mariquita, which extended as far as the foothills of\r\nthe Central Cordillera. Over and above these, veiled in an azure haze,\r\nand piercing the clouds, were the snow-crowned mass of Ruiz and the\r\nMesa de Herveo, and slightly to the left, but towering above all the\r\nneighboring peaks, was Tolima, the giant of the Colombian Andes. [238]\r\n\r\nBut it was not merely the physical features just mentioned, that\r\nproduced the admirable picture that held us spellbound. It was the\r\nmarvelous combination of light and shade, the position of the sun in\r\nthe heavens, and the strange optical illusions caused by the bright and\r\nfleecy clouds that constantly swept over the landscape. These factors\r\ngave rise to an ever-changing perspective, and at times, exaggerated\r\ndistances and magnitudes in the most extraordinary manner. Each\r\nchange developed a new picture and each one was, if possible, more\r\nbeautiful than that which it replaced. It seemed as if the genius\r\nof the Andes wished to give us, as we were leaving his domain,\r\na series of dissolving views on a stupendous scale. View succeeded\r\nview with kaleidoscopic rapidity, all distinguished by color-schemes\r\nof supreme delicacy and splendor. At one time we caught a glimpse\r\nof a cloud-grouping that recalled Raphael's Disputa. Perhaps in his\r\nUmbrian home Nature had gladdened the great artist's soul with a\r\nsimilar view. Perhaps he had caught it from some lofty peak of the\r\nApennines while gazing at the apparition of the morning sun from\r\nbeneath the blue waters of the Adriatic.\r\n\r\nWho can tell? What we do know is that he has reproduced in the\r\nexquisite creations of his transcendent genius just such cloud-effects\r\nas rejoiced our vision on that memorable day when we bade adieu to\r\nthe Eastern Cordilleras. Never before had mountain scenery occasioned\r\nus keener delight. Only once before had it been my privilege to\r\ncontemplate a vista at all approaching the one that unfolded itself\r\nbefore us in the picturesque valley of the Magdalena. That was long\r\nyears ago, as I stood on the summit of Mt. Parnassus. It was a balmy\r\nmorning in summer. \"Rosy-fingered dawn\" was just making her appearance\r\nbeyond the plain where Troy once stood, and was hastening to gladden\r\nby her smile the islands of the Ægean and the one-time famous land\r\nof Hellas. Then I beheld, spread out before me, the greater part of\r\nGreece, together with the countless islands that engirdle it. It was\r\na panorama which I then thought was unequaled in the wide world. But\r\nbeautiful, sublime, glorious as it undoubtedly was, it has since\r\nyielded the palm to the unrivaled vista that greeted us from the\r\nsummit of El Sargento.\r\n\r\n\"How Turner and Ruskin,\" we exclaimed, \"would have reveled in\r\nsuch scenic splendor! How it would have delighted the heart of\r\nClaude Lorrain, the painter of idyllic scenes and the master of\r\naerial perspective! What ecstatic joy would not Gaspard and Nicholas\r\nPoussin, Ruysdael and Corot, have experienced in the presence of such\r\nexuberant vegetation, such sparkling streams and fleece-like clouds,\r\nsuch grandiose mountains with their spotless mantles of eternal snow!\"\r\n\r\nAnd how such a spot as El Sargento would have appealed to the esthetic\r\nsoul of St. Benedict or to such lovers of wild nature as St. Bruno,\r\nor St. Francis, the poverello of Assisi! Had they found such a place,\r\nit would undoubtedly have been chosen as a site for a temple, like\r\nour Lady of the Angels, or a monastic retreat like that of Monte\r\nCasino or the Grande Chartreuse. [239]\r\n\r\nWe were still under the spell of the matchless pictures engraved on our\r\nmemories long after we had started on our way down the mountain. Before\r\nwe had realized it, we had passed from the tierra templada to the\r\ntierra caliente. We were again in the dense and luxuriant forests of\r\nthe lowlands--in a region of perpetual summer, like unto that which\r\nwe had left behind us in the valleys of the Meta and the Orinoco. We\r\nhad left the habitat of the coffee plant and the oak and were now in\r\nthe territory of the cacao and the tolu tree, the vanilla vine and\r\nthe moriche palm. Far above and behind us, on lofty mountain peaks\r\nwhere sunbeams \"glide apace with shadows in their train,\" were the\r\nfavorite haunts of the fleet and sporting Oreades. Our path was now\r\nthrough a dense, gloomy forest where Silence and Twilight,\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  \"Twin sisters keep\r\n        Their noonday watch, and sail among the shades,\r\n        Like vaporous shapes half seen.\" [240]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in such a sombre forest as this, we fancied, where, under\r\nthe influence of a fertile soil, perpetual warmth and humidity, the\r\nteeming earth, in later geologic time, fed the countless monsters that\r\ndepended on her bounty. It was amid such surroundings that they were\r\nwont to hold high carnival, or engage in that struggle for existence\r\nwhich resulted in the survival of the fittest, until finally all were\r\nswept away by some fatal agency of which we know so little. Had we\r\nseen a megatherium or a mylodon or a megalonyx crossing our path,\r\nor observed a mastodon pushing his bulky form through the dense\r\nunderbrush; had we seen a screaming pterodactyl passing over our heads,\r\nor beheld a giant iguanodon floundering in the morass by the wayside,\r\nor browsing on the succulent crowns of the Mauritia flexuosa, we\r\nshould have regarded it all as in perfect keeping with our environment.\r\n\r\nOur reveries were suddenly disturbed by the soft, dulcet notes of the\r\ntiple. Only a short distance ahead of us, reclining against a mango\r\ntree, was an amorous young mestizo, who was fondly gazing on his dusky\r\nquerida, while thrumming his instrument. She, during the serenade [241]\r\nof her ardent suitor, sat on the door-sill of a bamboo dwelling with\r\na palm-thatched roof, having seemingly no thought beyond satisfying\r\nthe cravings of two little nude, paunchy, bananniverous urchins,\r\napparently her brother and sister--Pablo and Julia by name--who, like\r\nebony statuettes, were standing at her knee and clamoring for another\r\nbanana from a bunch suspended from a rafter above the cabin door.\r\n\r\nFarther on was another cabin, from which issued coarser notes of\r\nshouts and laughter. It was a chicheria, and the chicha there served\r\nwas evidently the cause of the good nature and general merriment that\r\nprevailed. We then discovered that we were on the outskirts of a small\r\npueblo, just across the river from the goal of our day's journey. Our\r\nlong, yet delightful ride across the oriental Andes was at an\r\nend. Crossing a steel suspension bridge, the noblest structure of the\r\nkind in the republic--which here spans Colombia's great waterway--we\r\nwere in Honda, the head of navigation for the lower Magdalena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE VALLEY OF THE MAGDALENA\r\n\r\n\r\n               \"Salud, Salud, majestuoso rio!...\r\n                Al contemplar tu frente coronada\r\n                De los hijos mas viejos de la tierra,\r\n                Lleno solo de ti, siento mi alma\r\n                Arrastrada en la espuma de tus olas,\r\n                Que entre profundos remolinos braman,\r\n                De aquel gran ser que el infinito abraza.\" [242]\r\n\r\n                                            --Manuel M. Madiedo.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile in Guaduas we met a Scotch engineer, who was superintendent\r\nof a gold mine in the mountains west of Honda. Desiring to know the\r\ntruth about the excessive temperature of this place, about which we\r\nhad heard so many reports, we asked him if it was really true that\r\nthe heat in Honda was as intense as represented.\r\n\r\n\"You will,\" he said, \"find it the hottest place you have ever\r\nvisited. It is certainly the most torrid place I know, and I have\r\nbeen something of a globe-trotter in my time. Hades, if I have\r\ncaught the meaning of the word, as used in the Revised Version, is\r\nquite temperate in comparison with it. Business frequently calls me\r\nto Bogotá, and, on my way thither, I must necessarily pass through\r\nHonda, but I never stop there longer than is absolutely necessary,\r\nand I always try to avoid being there in the daytime. If I must stop\r\nthere for a few hours, I time my journey so as to arrive there at\r\nnight, and make it a point to leave before morning. Hot? I think it\r\nis the hottest and most suffocating spot on earth. It has always been\r\na mystery to me how people can live there at all. I know of nothing\r\nto compare it with except one of the burning pits of Dante's Inferno.\"\r\n\r\nHad we not learned by long experience how to discount such statements,\r\nthe prospect of spending some days in a town with such a reputation\r\nfor grilling the stranger within its gates, would have been anything\r\nbut inviting. But we had heard similar reports about the llanos\r\nand the valley of the Orinoco, and had found, on arriving in these\r\nregions, that the temperature said to prevail there had been greatly\r\nexaggerated. The same we found to be true of Honda. During our\r\nsojourn there, our thermometer never registered more than 86° F. in\r\nthe shade. Of course, around midday it was uncomfortable in the sun,\r\nbut I have been in many places in the United States where I suffered\r\nmore from the heat than I did in Honda.\r\n\r\nThe town is about seven hundred feet above sea level and counts nearly\r\nfour thousand inhabitants. It is separated into two parts by the river\r\nGuali, which here enters the Magdalena. Being the centre of traffic\r\nfor Bogotá, the upper Magdalena, and the mining district round about\r\nMariquita, it is a place of considerable importance. As soon, however,\r\nas the Colombian National Railway, now nearing completion, shall\r\nhave connected Girardot with Bogotá, Honda will lose the commercial\r\nsupremacy it has maintained for nearly three centuries. There will\r\nthen be little reason for a town in this place, and it will lapse\r\ninto a straggling village similar to many others along the river.\r\n\r\nAnd the Muisca Trail, over which we had so delightful a ride, will\r\nbe no longer needed, and will soon disappear in the dense and rank\r\nvegetation through which it passes. Then, too, will disappear those\r\nlong and picturesque mule-trains, that so often crowded us to the\r\nroadside on our way from Bogotá, and which have been almost the sole\r\nmeans employed for the transportation of freight and passengers since\r\nthe capital was founded by Quesada nearly four centuries ago. We shall\r\nalways congratulate ourselves that we were able to make the trip\r\non mule-back rather than by a railway train. We can thus feel that\r\nwe have, to a great extent, seen the country as it was in colonial\r\ntimes--before its character was modified by the innovations of modern\r\nprogress and the introduction of modern inventions.\r\n\r\nIn 1805 Honda was visited by a terrific earthquake, from the effects\r\nof which it has never recovered. Everywhere are evidences of the\r\nfrightful cataclysm. Some of the largest and most important structures\r\nare still in ruins. Nor has any attempt ever been made to restore\r\ncertain quarters of the town to their prior condition.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days' halt at Honda, we were ready to continue our\r\njourney towards the Caribbean. The rapids of the Magdalena make\r\nit impracticable for steamers to ascend the river as far as the\r\ntown. For this reason, it is necessary to go by rail to La Dorada,\r\neighteen miles northwards. But, although the distance is so short,\r\nit takes two hours for the train to make the run. The road, however,\r\npasses through a picturesque country and time passes pleasantly\r\nand quickly. Before one realizes it, one is at La Dorada, where the\r\ntransfer is made to the steamer bound for Barranquilla.\r\n\r\nThere are several lines of steamboats plying between La Dorada and\r\nBarranquilla and intermediate points. But all the boats, which are\r\nstern-wheelers, are quite small. The largest of them will not carry\r\nmore than four hundred tons. Usually the tonnage is much less--not more\r\nthan one or two hundred tons. [243] Our boat, which was recommended as\r\nthe best and the most comfortable on the river, was one of the largest\r\nand newest, but, if it was the best, it is difficult to conceive what\r\nthe others must have been.\r\n\r\nA glance was sufficient to convince us that the craft on the\r\nMagdalena are in every way inferior to those on the Orinoco and its\r\naffluents. The Venezuelan boats are larger, and with incomparably\r\nbetter equipment and appointments. They are clean, well kept, and the\r\nservice is good. Their cabins are commodious and well ventilated. They\r\nare, besides, provided with all necessary furniture and the berths\r\nare as comfortable as could be desired.\r\n\r\nBut how different is it on the Magdalena boats! In the cabins, in\r\nplace of berths with neat bedding, there is a bare cot, usually of\r\nquestionable cleanliness. Each passenger is supposed to supply his\r\nown bedding. As to lavatories and bathrooms, those that we saw were\r\nfilthy beyond description. Our stewards were half-dressed, barefooted,\r\nslovenly, unwashed negro boys, who seemed to have been picked up on\r\nthe streets at random, just before the boat left its moorings. The\r\ncuisine and service were in keeping with everything else, and left very\r\nmuch room for improvement. The natives, having nothing better, seemed\r\nto be satisfied with the conditions that obtained. The foreigners,\r\nhowever, and there were representatives of several nationalities\r\naboard, could never become reconciled to the lack of so many things\r\nessential to comfortable traveling, and were always glad when their\r\nriver experiences were at an end.\r\n\r\nFor ourselves, who had been roughing it so long, the trip down the\r\nriver was not so trying as it was for many others. We were, besides,\r\nbetter prepared for such a journey than the other passengers. We had\r\nour camping outfits with us, together with clean bedding, which had\r\nreceived the attention of the laundress before we left Bogotá. We\r\nhad, besides, good cumare hammocks, and mosquito nets, so that we had\r\nnothing to apprehend from filth, vermin or insects. Thus equipped,\r\nwe really enjoyed our voyage on the Magdalena, but we were probably\r\nthe only ones who did.\r\n\r\nAfter we had gotten fairly started down stream, and could contemplate\r\nat our leisure the rich tropical vegetation that fringed both\r\nbanks, our minds reverted to the first trip made down this river\r\nby Europeans. The travelers were the celebrated conquistadores,\r\nof whom mention has already been made, viz., Quesada, Belalcazar\r\nand Federmann. They embarked with a number of soldiers at Guataqui,\r\na short distance above Honda. But they had scarcely started on their\r\ndownward course, before they encountered the rapids at the mouth of\r\nthe Guali. They were then obliged to unload their two brigantines and\r\ncanoes and transport their contents to the lower part of the cataract,\r\nwhence, after reloading, they were able to proceed again on their\r\nlong journey to Cartagena.\r\n\r\nIt was while passing this point that Quesada learned from his Indian\r\nboatmen of the existence of gold in the valley of the Guali. In\r\nconsequence of this information, the town of Marquita was founded\r\nwithout delay, and has ever since been a mining centre of considerable\r\nimportance. It was in this place that Quesada died after his return\r\nfrom Spain. From here his remains were transferred to the Cathedral\r\nof Bogotá, where they still repose.\r\n\r\nAccording to Padre Simon, Quesada and his companions were frequently,\r\nduring their journey down the river, attacked by Indians, \"who\r\ncame out to salute them and speed their way with a shower of\r\npoisoned arrows.\" \"With the help of God,\" he continues, \"joined to\r\neternal vigilance, their own valor and a liberal supply of powder\r\nand firearms with which the soldiers of Belalcazar were provided,\r\nthey were able finally to arrive at Cartagena, and give the first\r\ninformation regarding the great campaign in which Quesada and his\r\nfollowers had achieved such signal success.\" [244]\r\n\r\nThe Magdalena, like many other water courses in South America, was at\r\nfirst known as the Rio Grande--the great river. It was subsequently\r\ngiven the name it now bears in honor of St. Mary Magdalene. [245]\r\nAt times it is comparatively narrow and deep. Then navigation is easy\r\nand without danger. At other times,\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Shallow, disreputable, vast\r\n        It spreads across the western plains.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThen progress is difficult, and the boat may run into a sand bar\r\nat any moment. And if the river should then be falling, it may be\r\nimpossible to get the craft free until the water rises. Only a short\r\ntime before our trip one of the steamers had been held in a sand bank\r\nfor forty days. As it was not near any place where provisions could\r\nbe obtained, the passengers suffered greatly from hunger, not to\r\nspeak of the suspense and enforced detention on an uncomfortable boat.\r\n\r\nOwing to the shallowness of the river, the boat was, during the first\r\npart of the voyage, always tied up for the night at the first tree\r\nor stump that might be found on the bank at sunset. The following\r\nmorning we were supposed to resume our journey at daybreak, but,\r\nas the firemen did not begin to get up steam before that time,\r\nit was usually an hour after sunrise before we were under way. We\r\nstopped at every village and warehouse along the river, sometimes\r\nto deliver the mail, often consisting of only a single letter or\r\npackage, or to take on a passenger. Two or three times a day, also,\r\nwe halted to take on wood to supply the furnace with fuel, for here,\r\nas on the Meta, coal is not used. Fortunately, we were never obliged,\r\nas on the Meta, to delay until the wood could be cut. Large wood piles\r\nare found every few miles all along the river. They usually belong to\r\na negro, who has a hut or shed near by, together with a small garden\r\nand a few domestic animals which supply him and his family with food\r\nin their sequestered home.\r\n\r\nWe stopped at several large warehouses, many of them constructed\r\nof corrugated iron from the United States. This seems strange\r\nin a land where timber is so abundant. But there are no sawmills\r\nin the Magdalena valley. South of Barranquilla--where but little\r\nlumber is produced--imported lumber would be more expensive and less\r\ndurable than iron. At these places the chief articles of merchandise\r\nare coffee, cacao, hides and vegetable ivory. This last product,\r\nalso called ivory nuts, is the fruit of a species of palm known\r\nas Phytelephas macrocarpa, [246] and constitutes, in this part of\r\nColombia, an important article of commerce. For many things it is\r\na good substitute for elephant ivory, which it rivals in whiteness,\r\nbeauty and solidity, and collecting it for shipment gives occupation\r\nto quite a number of the poor inhabitants of the Magdalena valley.\r\n\r\nWe usually went ashore at the different landing places to see the\r\npeople and familiarize ourselves with their mode of life. It was\r\ngenerally as simple and primitive as possible--almost as primitive,\r\nin some instances, as we conceive it to have been in the Quaternary\r\nperiod or in the days of the Troglodytes. Often their dwellings were\r\nlittle more than palm-thatched sheds--barely sufficient to shield their\r\noccupants from sun and rain. A tulpa, consisting of three stones,\r\nserved them in lieu of a stove, and on this they broiled the fish\r\ncaught in the river, or prepared their arepas--corn cakes--or their\r\nsancocho, a kind of ragout, as popular in some parts of Colombia as\r\nit is in Venezuela.\r\n\r\nWe were surprised to see in the houses and shops along the Magdalena\r\nvalley--what we had often observed in various parts of Colombia and\r\nVenezuela--the large number of illustrated circulars of Spanish,\r\nEnglish and French proprietary medicines. The insides of certain\r\nhouses were sometimes quite plastered over with them. But what was\r\nmore surprising was the number of lithographs we saw of the German\r\nEmperor. Sometimes he was represented alone, at others he was depicted\r\nas surrounded by the members of his family. In several places we saw\r\npictures not only of the emperor and his family, but also those of his\r\nfather and grandfather and Bismarck. And the remarkable thing about it\r\nwas that, in some cases, there were no Germans living within hundreds\r\nof miles of where we came across these pictures. Had some enthusiastic\r\nTeuton tried to start a propaganda in favor of the Vaterland by\r\ndistributing broadcast these engravings of the imperial family? I\r\nknow not, but, judging solely from the number of their pictures we\r\ncame across in Venezuela and Colombia, one would be led to suppose\r\nthat the Hohenzollern rulers are the most popular of potentates,\r\nat least in this part of South America.\r\n\r\nWhile stopping to take on some rubber at a certain small village, we\r\nhad a remarkable illustration of the rapidity with which the bed of\r\nthe river is sometimes changed, even when the water is comparatively\r\nlow. We had scarcely reached the landing place when there was a\r\nterrific crash, occasioned by the falling in of a large section of the\r\nbank on which the village was built. Soon afterwards another section\r\ngave way, and then a third and a fourth. The whole bank seemed to be\r\nundermined by the river, and, although the warehouse was fully fifty\r\nfeet away from the water when we arrived, so much of the bank had been\r\ncarried away in less than half an hour, that not only the contents of\r\nthe building, but also the building itself had to be hurriedly removed\r\nin order that it and the merchandise stored within might not be borne\r\naway by the resistless current. As the structure was of light bamboo,\r\nand put together with a view to such an emergency, the transfer\r\nwas not a difficult task. When we started to continue our course,\r\nit looked as if the eroding action of the river would necessitate\r\nthe changing of the site of the entire village before nightfall.\r\n\r\nSuch changes in the course of the river are not uncommon. They are\r\ngoing on all the time in some part or other of the valley. One may\r\nfrequently see immense masses of earth suddenly detached, which are a\r\nserious menace to the champans [247]--large covered flat-boats--and\r\nother small craft that happen to pass by at the time. Sometimes the\r\ngiants of the forest are thus wrested from their footholds, and may be\r\nseen drifting down stream together with masses of vegetation attached\r\nto them. At times, too, masses of earth, like floating islets, are\r\nvisible, and may travel a long distance down stream before their\r\ncourse is arrested by an island or a sand bar.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily the changes in the river bed are gradual and occasion\r\nlittle danger to life or property. Sometimes, however, during the\r\nrainy season, and when the flood is unusually high, widespread\r\ndevastation is the result. Whole villages are swept away by the\r\ndeluge; and towns, that were before important commercial centres,\r\nare suddenly isolated and left far from the navigable part of the\r\nriver. Places that before were favorably situated are, after the flood,\r\nfound to be in the midst of pestiferous morasses. Such has been the\r\nfate of many places along the waterways of Colombia, but more notably\r\nin the great island of Mompos, near the confluence of the Cauca and\r\nthe Magdalena. Here several places that were at one time centres of\r\nindustrial and agricultural activity, have long since either ceased\r\nto exist or lost entirely their pristine importance.\r\n\r\nThe town of Mompos is probably the most remarkable example of this\r\nkind. Founded in 1539 by Alonso de Heredia, it is one of the oldest\r\ntowns in the republic, and was for generations the most important\r\ncommercial centre between Cartagena and Honda. But owing to a\r\ndisplacement of the main channel of the river, and the filling in\r\nof the branch of the river on which the town was built, it is now\r\npractically deprived of its former means of communication with the\r\nrest of the country, and is rapidly verging towards extinction.\r\n\r\nThe Magdalena, as a commercial highway, has been much neglected. As\r\na consequence, no one can calculate when leaving Honda, how long it\r\nwill take him to reach Barranquilla. It may require five or six days,\r\nor it may demand twice that much time. All depends on the shifting\r\nbed of the river, or the blocking of the channel by sand bars and\r\naccumulations of floating timber. By reason of these obstructions and\r\nthe ever-varying depth of the main channel, navigation is usually\r\nimpossible at night, except below the island of Mompos, where the\r\nvolume of water is swelled by the tribute of the mighty Cauca.\r\n\r\nIf the Magdalena were under the supervision of a corps of competent\r\nengineers, having at their disposal the necessary dredges and other\r\nappliances for keeping the main channel in prime condition, a properly\r\nconstructed boat would easily make the trip from Honda to the mouth\r\nof the river in two days, and traverse the same course up stream in\r\nthree days at most. It is really a pity to see such a splendid water\r\ncourse so neglected. If cared for as it should be, it could easily be\r\nrendered an artery for inland commerce of the first importance. As it\r\nis, transportation, as now carried on, is always slow and uncertain,\r\nand never free from danger and disaster.\r\n\r\nAs a serviceable means of communication with the outside world we\r\nwere constantly contrasting the Magdalena with the Meta. From our\r\nobservations, we should consider the Meta, from its junction with the\r\nOrinoco to Cabuyaro or even to the mouth of the Humea, as a safer\r\nwaterway than the Magdalena. Only twice did our boat graze a sand\r\nbank in the Meta, but it continued its course without a moment's\r\nstoppage. In the Magdalena, however, we frequently ran into sand\r\nbars, or shallow water, and, on several occasions, had difficulty\r\nin extricating and floating our craft. Once we were delayed for some\r\ntime, and began to fear that, owing to the falling water, we should\r\nbe stranded for weeks, as other boats had been not long before.\r\n\r\nWhen peace shall have been firmly established in Colombia, and its\r\nfinances shall have been placed on a satisfactory basis, the patriotic\r\nand far-seeing statesmen of the republic, will, I am convinced, see\r\nthe necessity of carrying out the plan of the former Archbishop and\r\nViceroy of New Granada--Don Antonio Caballero y Gongora--and connecting\r\nBogotá with Europe by means of the Meta and the Orinoco. It will not be\r\na difficult feat of engineering to build a railroad from the capital\r\nto a suitable point on the Meta, and the length of such a road need\r\nnot exceed one hundred and fifty miles at most. This will bring Bogatá\r\nwithin eight or ten hours of the head waters of navigation, and develop\r\nthe most valuable and most productive grazing section of the country.\r\n\r\nThe highest point the road need reach in crossing the Eastern\r\nCordilleras will be less than that of several passes in Colorado,\r\nwhere the Rocky Mountains are scaled by the iron-horse with a long\r\ntrain of cargo behind him. The pass of Chipaque, by which we entered\r\nthe altiplanicies of Bogotá, is several thousand feet lower than\r\nthe heights crossed by the railways leading from the waters of the\r\nPacific to Lake Titicaca, and to Argentina by way of Cumbre Pass,\r\nand is nearly a mile lower than the point where the Galera tunnel\r\npierces the Cordillera on the way from Lima to Oroya. [248]\r\n\r\nWhat Colombia really needs is the betterment of both its great\r\nwaterways--the Meta for the eastern and the Magdalena for the western\r\npart of the republic. Until they shall both have been put in such\r\ncondition as to be navigable during the entire year, it will be\r\nimpossible fully to develop the marvelous resources of this extensive\r\ncountry. River traffic will always remain cheaper than traffic by rail,\r\nand, on account of many physical difficulties, it is highly improbable\r\nthat certain valuable sections of territory will ever be tapped by\r\nrailroads. When, however, these two main arteries of commerce shall\r\nhave received the attention they deserve and shall have been put in\r\ncommunication with the rich grazing, mining and agricultural regions\r\nby the various lines of railway that are contemplated or in course of\r\nconstruction, Colombia will at once take a position among the richest\r\nand most flourishing republics of South America. Only those who have\r\ntraveled through it can fully realize its wonderful natural riches,\r\nor form an adequate conception of its vast extent. Sufficient to state\r\nthat its area is more than ten times as great as the state of New York,\r\nor as great as that of France, Germany and the British Isles combined.\r\n\r\nAs to the great Pan-American line which has been projected to connect\r\nNew York with Buenos Ayres, that is talked of in Colombia as well\r\nas in the United States. But when one contemplates the enormous\r\nengineering difficulties to be encountered in the construction of\r\nthe section extending from Costa Rica to the frontier of Ecuador,\r\none is compelled to regard the project as a much more arduous\r\nundertaking than some of its enthusiastic promoters would have us\r\nbelieve. Railway communication will soon be complete from Buenos\r\nAyres to Central Peru, and, judging by work now being accomplished\r\nin Ecuador, steel rails will soon span the country from the northern\r\nto the southern boundaries of this republic. But with all this work\r\ncompleted, the most difficult part of the colossal enterprise will\r\nstill remain untouched. Even should the road eventually be completed,\r\nas is possible, it is still doubtful whether long stretches of it\r\nwould ever pay even a nominal interest on the investment.\r\n\r\nThe part of the Magdalena valley between Honda and the island of\r\nMompos is but sparsely inhabited. Most of the inhabitants are Indians,\r\nmestizos, or negroes, the descendants of former slaves. [249] On\r\naccount of the heat and malaria that always prevail in the lowlands,\r\nbut few white men are found here, and their sojourn, as a rule, is only\r\ntemporary. But near the confluence of the Cauca and the Magdalena, and\r\nthence to the Caribbean, there are rich and extensive esteros--grazing\r\nlands--covered with succulent Para and Guinea grasses, several feet\r\nhigh. In these broad plains, there are no fewer than half a million\r\ncattle, not to speak of large numbers of horses, mules and other\r\ndomestic animals. Some of the cattle we saw reminded us of the fat,\r\nsleek animals we had seen on the llanos watered by the Rio Negro and\r\nthe Humea. Under more favorable conditions the number could greatly\r\nbe increased.\r\n\r\nThe scenery along the Magdalena is much like that along the Meta\r\nand the Orinoco, except that along the western river one sees more\r\nof the mountains, especially in the southern part. The vegetation is\r\nsimilar in character and quite as varied and exuberant. On both sides\r\nof the river trees and bushes are so massed together as to form an\r\nimpenetrable wall. Everywhere there is a veritable maze of creeping\r\nplants, of bromelias, bignonias, passifloras. And everywhere, too,\r\nare lianas--aptly named monkey-ladders--which bind tree to tree and\r\nbranch to branch. Usually they are single, like ropes--whence their\r\nname bush ropes--but often they are twined together like strands in a\r\ncable. Frequently they are seen descending from the topmost part of a\r\ntree to the ground, where they forthwith strike root and present the\r\nappearance of the stays and shrouds of a ship's main mast. And where\r\nthere is air and sunshine, these lianas, which often form bights\r\nlike ropes, are loaded with epiphytes of all kinds, and decorated\r\nwith the rarest and most beautiful orchids. Indeed, the regions on\r\nboth sides of the Magdalena have long been favorite resorts for the\r\norchid hunters in the employ of the florists and merchant princes\r\nof the United States and Europe. From here these bizarre vegetable\r\nforms are shipped by thousands. One enthusiastic English collector\r\ntells us how he secured, as the result of two months' work about ten\r\nthousand plants of the highly prized Odontoglossum. But to obtain\r\nthese orchids he was obliged to fell some four thousand trees.\r\n\r\n\"The most magnificent sight,\" he writes, \"for even the most stoical\r\nobserver, is the immense clumps of Cattleya Mendelii, each new bulb\r\nbearing four or five of its gorgeous rose-colored flowers, many of them\r\ngrowing in the full sun, or with very little shade, and possessing a\r\nglowing color which is very difficult to get in the stuffy hothouses\r\nwhere the plants are cultivated. Some of these plants, considering\r\ntheir size and the slowness of growth, must have taken many years to\r\ndevelop, for I have taken plants from the trees with five hundred\r\nbulbs, and as many as one hundred spikes of flowers, which, to a\r\nlover of orchids, is a sight worth traveling from Europe to see.\" [250]\r\n\r\nIt is when contemplating the marvelous variety and luxuriance of\r\nintertropical flora--of which one in our northern climes can have no\r\nadequate conception--that one is tempted to exclaim with Wordsworth:--\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"It is my faith, that every flower\r\n        Enjoys the air it breathes.\" [251]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd if the extraordinary claims which Professors Wagner, France and\r\nG. H. Darwin make for plants be true, viz., that they have minds\r\nand are conscious of their existence, that they feel pain and have\r\nmemories, then, indeed, should we be disposed to regard the exuberant\r\nand wondrously developed plants of the equatorial world as occupying\r\nthe highest plane in the evolutionary process of vegetable life.\r\n\r\nPassing the embouchure of the Opon, on the right bank of the Magdalena,\r\nevoked, in a special manner, memories of Quesada and his valiant\r\nband. It was here they left the Magdalena during that memorable\r\nexpedition that made them the undisputed masters of the country\r\nnow known as Colombia. More than eight months had passed since\r\nthey had started from Santa Marta on their career of discovery and\r\nconquest. The difficulties they had to encounter and the sufferings\r\nthey had to endure were extreme. Mosquitoes, wasps, ants and other\r\ninsects; reptiles and jaguars gave them no rest, day or night. Certain\r\nkinds of worms, the old chroniclers tell us, buried themselves in the\r\nflesh of the exhausted and half-famished men and caused them untold\r\nagony. Indians everywhere laid ambush for them, and assailed them with\r\npoisoned arrows from every point of vantage. Even the elements seemed\r\nto conspire against them. There was a continual downpour of rain,\r\nso that it was impossible to light a fire for any purpose. Their\r\narms were almost destroyed by rust, and they were left without a\r\nsingle dry charge of powder. Their provisions became exhausted and\r\nstarvation stared them in the face. To preserve life they devoured\r\ntheir sword scabbards and every article of leather they had with\r\nthem. There was incessant thunder, unchanging gloom, eternal horror,\r\nand other features of the pit infernal. Their course was through dense\r\nunderbrush and pestiferous swamps and up precipitous acclivities,\r\nwhither they had to drag their weakened horses by long lianas that\r\nserved the purpose of ropes. [252]\r\n\r\nFinally, after the most heroic efforts, they came to a place where\r\nthey found provisions--a veritable land of promise for the suffering\r\nbut intrepid Spaniards. They had left behind them the inhospitable\r\nsierras of the Opon, and were on the verge of the fertile plateau\r\nof Cundinamarca, that constituted the home of the Muiscas. Here\r\nthey found maize, potatoes, [253] yucas, beans, tomatoes and, as\r\nPadre Simon phrases it, \"a thousand other chucherias--titbits--of\r\nthe aborigines.\" Well could they, in the language of Castellanos,\r\nexclaim, with thanksgiving:\r\n\r\n\"A good land! A good land! A land which puts an end to our suffering,\r\na land of gold, a land of plenty. A land for a home, a land of\r\nbenediction, bright and serene.\"\r\n\r\nIt was then that the enthusiastic soldiers, whose courage would often\r\nhave faltered, had it not been for the determination and perseverance\r\nof their invincible leader, gathered around Quesada to congratulate\r\nhim on the successful issue of his great undertaking, and to assure\r\nhim of their undying loyalty in any future enterprise in which he\r\nmight require their services.\r\n\r\nAnd well they might render the noble licentiate the meed of praise he\r\nso well deserved, for had it not been for him, the expedition would\r\nhave been a failure, and they would undoubtedly have perished before\r\nthey could have returned to Santa Marta, as had so many of their\r\ncompanions, who had turned back before the ascent of the Cordillera\r\nwas begun. To some of his officers who, in view of the unheard-of\r\ndifficulties they had to encounter, recommended that the expedition\r\nbe abandoned, he replied that he would regard as a personal enemy any\r\none who, in future, would make such a pusillanimous proposal and one\r\nso foreign to Spanish valor.\r\n\r\nAll in all, he was one of the bravest and most humane of the\r\nconquistadores, and successfully performed a task before which a less\r\nvalorous commander would have given up in despair. His achievements\r\nobscure by their brilliancy and daring those of Amadis and Roldan and\r\nare in no wise inferior to those of any of the conquistadores. They\r\nmay truthfully, in the words of Bacon, written anent a performance\r\nof Sir Richard Grenville, be styled as \"memorable beyond credit,\r\nand to the height of some heroical fable.\"\r\n\r\nQuesada has taken his place in Valhalla among the greatest of the\r\nworld's heroes, and his memory will endure as long as splendid deeds of\r\nprowess shall stir the souls of men. Of him and his gallant companions\r\none can say what Peter Martyr wrote of their countrymen in general:--\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore, the Spanyardes in these owre dayes and theyr noble\r\nenterpryses, doo not gyue place eyther to the factes of Saturnus,\r\nor Hercules, or any other of the ancient princes of famous memorie,\r\nwhich were canonized amonge the goddes cauled Heroes for theyr\r\nsearchinge of newe landes, and regions, and bringinge the same to\r\nbetter culture and ciuilitie.\" [254]\r\n\r\nLower down the Magdalena, on the left bank of the river, we\r\napproached the scene of the exploits of another of the distinguished\r\nconquistadores--Pedro de Heredia, the founder of Cartagena. After he\r\nhad reduced to submission the Indians who had been victorious over\r\nOjeda, he started towards the Magdalena, where he collected such\r\nimmense treasures of gold that when it was divided, each soldier\r\nreceived no less than 6,000 ducats. This was the equivalent of\r\n$48,000 in gold at the present valuation of this metal, and was the\r\nlargest apportionment of spoil, at least, so far as private soldiers\r\nwere concerned, made during the conquest. [255] He afterwards made\r\na similar expedition to the territories drained by the San Jorge and\r\nthe Nechi, affluents of the Cauca, in search of the rich veins whence\r\nthe Indians extracted their gold. He did not find the objects of his\r\nquest, but came across several rich cemeteries, in which the dead had\r\nbeen interred with their jewels, and a sanctuary with idols adorned\r\nwith plates of gold. From these he secured treasures to the amount\r\nof more than $3,000,000 of our money. [256]\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, the method Heredia resorted to of securing\r\ngold, the rifling of the huacas--burial places--of the aborigines,\r\nhas been continued until the present day. There are still men in\r\nColombia, notably in Antioquia--huaqueros, they are called--who gain\r\na livelihood by searching for huacas and extracting from them the\r\ngold and emeralds they frequently contain.\r\n\r\nThe year before our trip there appeared in an English magazine,\r\nthe following paragraph in an article purporting to give a picture\r\nof the Magdalena valley and its life:--\r\n\r\n\"Anchored in the forest at midnight, the traveler hears the deep\r\ngrowl of the jaguar, the sharp squeal of the wild cat, the howl of\r\nthe howler monkey, the long moan of the sloth, and the last scream\r\nof the wild pig, pierced by the claws of some patient but ferocious\r\nanimal ambushed during the past hour, with many other sounds of life,\r\nterror and conflict that fall strangely on the European ear, and,\r\nif he waits and watches until the dawn, he may see the alligator\r\ndragging his ugly bulk out of the water, crowds of turtles trailing on\r\nthe sands, the deer and the tapir coming down to drink, thousands of\r\nwhite cranes on the branches nearest to their prey, thousands of gray\r\nones already wading leg-deep, and many more thousands of other birds\r\nclouding the dim horizon, all waiting for the light ere they begin\r\ntheir work of life and slaughter.... With the alligators in shoals at\r\nthe bottom of the river, and the millions of birds above its surface,\r\none wonders how any fish are left, yet the river is always literally\r\nteeming with fish, as though conscious of the demands it has to meet.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough we were always on the alert, so as to miss nothing of\r\ninterest, especially anything that concerned the animal life of\r\nthe tropics, we must confess that in all our experience we never\r\nheard growls, squeals, howls, moans, screams, or other sounds of\r\nterror and conflict, either along the Magdalena or anywhere else in\r\nSouth America. And we spent nearly a year in the country, and often\r\ntraveled weeks at a time in the wild virgin forest, far away from human\r\nhabitations of every kind. Nor did we ever perceive any of the animals\r\nthat certain tourists would lead one to believe can be seen in such\r\nnumbers everywhere, even from the deck of a passing steamer. Nowhere\r\nalong the Orinoco, the Meta, the Magdalena, or elsewhere, did we ever\r\ncatch even a glimpse of a jaguar or a puma, a manati or a sloth, a\r\nwild cat or a wild pig. More than this, not once, during our entire\r\ntrip through Venezuela and Colombia, through forests and plains, did\r\nwe ever see a single monkey, except two or three that were kept as\r\npets by the natives. This may seem an incredible statement. I would\r\nhave believed such an experience as ours to be absolutely impossible,\r\nespecially in view of what writers and travelers in South America\r\nhave told us regarding the immense number of wild animals of all\r\nkinds everywhere visible in equatorial wilds. But I am stating a fact\r\nthat I am quite unable to reconcile with the contrary experiences of\r\nothers who, according to their own admission, have seen but little,\r\ncompared with what we saw, of the lands through which we passed. I\r\nhave seen more large game on the plains of New Mexico and Wyoming,\r\nfrom the window of a Pullman car, in a single trip to and from the\r\nPacific coast, than I ever saw in the wilds of South America during\r\nnearly a twelvemonth.\r\n\r\nNor did we ever see along the Magdalena, or anywhere else, the\r\n\"thousands of white cranes on branches,\" nor the \"thousands of gray\r\nones wading leg-deep,\" nor the \"many more thousands clouding the\r\ndim horizon,\" of which the writer of the above-mentioned article\r\nprofesses to have been the fortunate spectator. We rarely saw more\r\nthan a few dozen cranes at a time--never a hundred, and I have reason\r\nto believe we enjoyed very favorable opportunities, at least during\r\na portion of our long journey, for seeing what was to be seen. At no\r\ntime did we ever observe as many birds in the air at one time as I\r\nhave frequently seen in the United States. I feel safe in asserting\r\npositively that the number of wild pigeons I have frequently noted\r\nin a single flock in the United States, would more than equal that\r\nof all the birds combined that we saw while in the tropics.\r\n\r\nMr. F. Lorraine Petre evidently had an experience somewhat similar to\r\nours. In his recent work on Colombia, he tells us frankly that one\r\nsees little of animal life on the Magdalena, that \"of the mammalia\r\none sees and hears little.... Of the jaguars, the pumas, the sloths,\r\nthe peccaries, the deer, the tapirs, and other animals, dangerous\r\nor harmless, we saw or heard as little as we did of the bears which\r\ninhabit the hills beyond. It is surprising that, tied up, as we often\r\nwere, right against the forest, we should not have heard the night\r\ncall of the carnivora, or the sharp bark of the frightened deer,\r\nbut truth compels us to admit that we did not, and, moreover, that\r\nthe cry of even the howling monkey did not salute us.\" [257]\r\n\r\nThe number of birds observed along the Magdalena was not greater\r\nthan I have frequently seen in the valleys of the Missouri or the\r\nColumbia. Most of these were parrots and macaws. Always noisy and\r\nrestless, always flying and climbing about, except when eating fruit or\r\ncracking nuts, one is at times tempted to describe them as feathered\r\nrelatives of the monkey. The parrots are sometimes seen in flocks,\r\nand their piercing cries are at times almost deafening. They are a\r\nsociable bird and are usually seen in considerable numbers. The macaws\r\nare remarkable for always flying in pairs, and for their brilliant\r\ncolors. Their body is flaming scarlet, their wings are tinged with\r\nvarious shades of red, yellow, green and blue, while their tail is\r\nbright blue and scarlet. They, too, like parrots, are very vociferous,\r\nand, although they may occasionally be found in large numbers, they\r\nalways fly two and two.\r\n\r\nThe large animals most frequently seen along the Magdalena, as along\r\nother tropical rivers, are those horrid monsters, \"ambiguous between\r\nsea and land,\" the cayman and \"the scaly crocodile.\" But even they\r\nare not so numerous as certain travelers would have us believe. The\r\nlargest number we ever saw at one time was fifteen. They were sunning\r\nthemselves on a playa--sand bank--below the island of Mompos. On\r\nthe Orinoco and the Meta we never beheld more than eight at any one\r\ntime--unless we were to count a number of little ones, just hatched,\r\nwhich Luisito, our colored boy, caught one day while we were taking\r\non wood on the lower Meta. [258]\r\n\r\nThe early Spaniards called all these saurians by the general name of\r\nlagartos--lizards. The English afterwards spoke of a single animal as\r\na lagarto, whence the present name alligator. Modern writers speak\r\nof them indiscriminately as alligators or crocodiles. As a matter\r\nof fact, several species of both alligators and crocodiles are\r\nfound in the equatorial regions. But, notwithstanding all that has\r\nhitherto been written about them, their distinction and definition,\r\ntheir classification still remains a matter of difficulty. Some\r\nspecimens have been found whose classification is so perplexing that\r\nnaturalists are still undecided whether to regard them as crocodiles\r\nor alligators. In this respect they are much like Shakespeare's two\r\nlovers, \"Two distincts, division none.\"\r\n\r\nThe name cayman is employed in Venezuela and Colombia to designate any\r\nof these saurians. Following the classification adopted in the British\r\nMuseum the cayman is distinct from both alligator and crocodile. More\r\nthan this. According to the British system of classification, there\r\nare no alligators at all in South America, while, in the waters of\r\nColombia and Venezuela, there are two species of crocodile and three\r\nspecies of cayman.\r\n\r\nProbably more fabulous accounts have obtained about crocodiles than\r\nabout any other animal. In spite of the old saying to the contrary,\r\nthey never shed tears. And notwithstanding the fact that the ancient\r\nEgyptians gave the crocodile divine honors, because, being tongueless,\r\nit was made in hieroglyphical writing, a symbol of the Divinity,\r\nit is now known that the tongue of this erstwhile god is quite\r\nlarge, except at the tip. Similarly, all the stories that have so\r\nlong been current about the impenetrability of the animal's hide,\r\nare quite without foundation. How often have we not been told that\r\nit is impossible to kill a crocodile, with even the best Winchester,\r\nunless the ball enter the eye or strike under the soft, fleshy parts\r\nof the front legs? Their plated skin is easily pierced by an ordinary\r\nrifle or revolver, and a mortal wound ensues whenever a vital part\r\nis penetrated.\r\n\r\nNot less erroneous are the ideas that so widely prevail regarding the\r\nferocity of the crocodile and the cayman. On the contrary, they are,\r\nin their native state, very timid animals, and rarely exhibit hostility\r\ntowards man, except when cornered. Then, like most other animals,\r\nthey will fight with great fierceness. They make for the water as\r\nsoon as they see one approach them, and it is often far from easy\r\nto get near them. We often saw the natives enter rivers frequented\r\nby crocodiles and caymans, something they surely would not have done\r\nif the danger were as great as ordinarily imagined. In Venezuela the\r\nIndian or mestizo has a much greater dread of the ray or carib fish\r\nthan of the cayman. [259]\r\n\r\nSome attempts have been made, both on the Orinoco and the Magdalena,\r\nto secure the hides of crocodiles and caymans for commercial purposes,\r\nbut the expense of preparing them for the market proved to be so\r\ngreat that the work had to be abandoned. [260]\r\n\r\nThe early explorers of the New World had many stories to tell about\r\nthe cayman and the crocodile, and many of them have apparently\r\nsurvived among the natives until the present day. But there were\r\nmany other animals that made even a greater impression on them. It\r\nwill suffice to reproduce Peter Martyr's quaint account of two of\r\nthese representatives of the American fauna. The first is the tapir,\r\nof which he writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"But there is especially one beast engendered here, in which nature\r\nhath endeuoured to shew her cunnyng. This beaste is as bygge as an oxe,\r\narmed with a longe snoute lyke an elephant, and yet no elephant. Of\r\nthe colour of an oxe and yet noo oxe. With the houfe of a horse,\r\nand yet noo horse. With eares also much lyke vnto an elephant, but\r\nnot soo open nor soo much hangying downe: yet much wyder then the\r\neares of any other beaste.\" [261]\r\n\r\nThe other animal that excited the wonder of Martyr and his\r\ncontemporaries was the sloth, of which he says:-- \"Emonge these trees\r\nis fownde that monstrous beaste with a snowte lyke a foxe, a tayle\r\nlyke a marmasette, eares lyke a batte, handes lyke a man, and feete\r\nlyke an ape, bearing her whelpes abowte with her in an owtwarde bellye\r\nmuch lyke vnto a greate bagge or purse. The dead carkas of this beaste,\r\nyou sawe with me, and turned it ouer and ouer with yowre owne handes,\r\nmarueylynge at that newe belly and wonderful prouision of nature. They\r\nsay it is knownen by experience, that shee neuer letteth her whelpes\r\ngoo owte of that purse, except it be eyther to play, or to sucke,\r\nvntyl suche tyme that they bee able to gette theyr lyuing by them\r\nselues.\" [262]\r\n\r\nThe part of the valley below the confluence of the Cauca and the\r\nMagdalena was quite different from that above. The country contained\r\nmore inhabitants, and the dense forests that had hitherto bordered\r\nthe river gave place to broad savannas, on which grazed thousands of\r\ncattle, so buried in the Para and Guinea grasses, that frequently we\r\ncould discern only their horns. Along the river banks were the estates\r\nof well-to-do haciendados--some of them foreigners--and the villages,\r\nthat before were extremely rare, became more numerous. The aspect of\r\nthe country was less wild than that through which we had just passed,\r\nand betokened a certain measure of prosperity, at least so far as\r\nthe grazing interests were concerned.\r\n\r\nWe could now travel day and night, for the river was so deep that\r\nsand bars were no longer to be apprehended. And then we had the most\r\ndelightful moonlight nights. The air was balmy and laden with an\r\nexquisite fragrance,\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Mild as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes,\"\r\n\r\n\r\na constant invitation to repose and dolce far niente. The surpassing\r\nloveliness of the scene, the magic stillness of the vast solitude\r\nthrough which we were so peacefully gliding, the broad expanse of\r\none of the world's great rivers, the weird silhouettes cast by the\r\npassing palms on the moonlit waters--all these things contributed\r\ntowards rendering our last night on the river a fitting finale to\r\nthe others--all of which were in the highest degree enjoyable. Seated\r\non the forward deck of our steamer, we could exclaim in the words of\r\nthe choric song of Tennyson's Lotos-Eaters:--\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"How sweet it were, hearing the downward stream,\r\n        With half-shut eyes ever to seem\r\n        Falling asleep in a half-dream!\r\n\r\n        Resting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following morning--our last day on the Magdalena--found us at\r\nCalamar. Here some of our fellow-passengers disembarked to take the\r\ntrain to Cartagena, sixty-five miles to the westward. From Calamar\r\nto Barranquilla, the chief northern terminus of river navigation,\r\nis sixty-six miles. This distance we expected to make in a few hours,\r\nbut for reasons presently to be given, we were unexpectedly delayed\r\nwithin sight of Barranquilla, the goal that marked the completion of\r\nanother important stage in our journey.\r\n\r\nOur last day on the Magdalena was a bright balmy one in June. We spent\r\nthe entire time on the forward part of the upper deck, fanned by the\r\ndelightful breezes that were wafted from the Caribbean. The river here\r\nhas about the same width as has the Mississippi at New Orleans, but\r\nthe scenery is far more attractive. It flows through a broad, level,\r\ngrass-covered savanna, which extends beyond the limits of vision, and\r\nwhich is dotted here and there with small villages and flourishing\r\nhaciendas. Some of the houses near the river banks have a most cozy\r\nappearance. They are almost embowered in a mass of flowers of every\r\nhue, and surrounded by lofty palms whose lovely emerald coronals were\r\neach a picture of rarest beauty.\r\n\r\n\"These princes of the vegetable world\" always had a peculiar\r\nfascination for us, no matter where we saw them. And during our long\r\njourney from the delta of the Orinoco they were never absent from view\r\neven for a single hour. When one species disappeared it was replaced\r\nby another, and thus they followed us from the Atlantic wave to the\r\nlofty crest of Suma Paz. The ocean-loving cocoa gave place to the\r\nmoriche, and this was in turn succeeded by the corneto of the llanos\r\nand the wax palm of the Sierras. [263]\r\n\r\nIt is quite impossible for the inhabitants of our northern climes\r\nto have anything approaching an adequate conception of the grace\r\nand beauty and surpassing loveliness of the omnipresent palms of\r\nthe equatorial world. Away from heat and sunshine, they are quite\r\ndevoid of the luxuriance and stateliness that characterize them in the\r\ntropics. In Europe, for instance, there is but a single palm that is\r\nindigenous--the Chamærops humilis. The date palm was introduced from\r\nthe East. In the tropics, however, about eleven hundred species of\r\npalms are known, and there is reason to believe that, when this part\r\nof the world shall have been thoroughly explored, many new species\r\nshall be discovered.\r\n\r\nThe habits as well as the habitats of palms were a source of unfailing\r\ninterest to us. Some are solitary and are rarely found forming groups\r\nwith other trees of their species. Others, like the date palm, are\r\nquite gregarious and often form extensive clumps. Others still are\r\nsaid to be \"social,\" because they occupy extensive tracts almost to\r\nthe entire exclusion of other kinds of trees. Various species of\r\nMauritia, Attalea, Cocoa and Copernicia are social palms, and the\r\npalmares--palm groves--formed by them constitute the most attractive\r\nfeatures of tropical landscapes.\r\n\r\nWe once saw near the river's bank a grove of this kind composed of\r\npalms of unusual height and beauty. It had been selected as the last\r\nresting place of the denizens of a neighboring village, and was,\r\nto our mind, the most beautiful cemetery in the world. Could we have\r\nour choice, we should prefer, by far, to repose under one of those\r\nnoble frond-bearing shafts to being shelved away in the costliest\r\nmarble vault of Père Lachaise.\r\n\r\nCertain palms affect the open savanna, others seek the solitudes of the\r\nforest, while still others are most frequently found midway between\r\nthese two--that is, on the belt of land that separates forest from\r\nplain. Some palms, like the cocoa, seem to require an atmosphere that\r\nis slightly saline, and thrive best near the ocean's shore. Others\r\napparently attain their greatest development in marshes and lowlands,\r\nwhile others again demand the arid plain or the lofty mountain plateau.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their noble appearance and their aspect of perennial youth,\r\npalms, as a rule, are short-lived. None of them ever attain the age of\r\nthe venerable patriarchs of our northern forests. According to Martius,\r\nthe span of a palm's life never exceeds that of a few generations\r\nof men. The areca catechu runs its course in forty or fifty years,\r\nthe cocoa attains an age of one hundred or one hundred and twenty\r\nyears at most, while the date palm, which probably lives the longest,\r\nusually rounds out its existence within the period of two centuries.\r\n\r\nSome palms, like the Metroxylon, for instance, never survive\r\nfructification. It fruits but once, and then, as Martius so graphically\r\nexpresses it, \"nobilis arbor mox riget, perit et cadit\"--the noble\r\ntree presently withers, perishes and falls. But, continues the same\r\nwriter, \"there is pleasure and solace in the thought that palms\r\nnever die without yielding fruit, thereby insuring the continuance\r\nof the species.\" And then, as is his wont when opportunity offers,\r\nhe takes occasion from this circumstance to moralize as follows:\r\n\"To labor, to flourish, to fructify is granted not only to the palm\r\nbut to man also.\" [264]\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing pages I have mentioned some of the countless uses\r\nmade of palms, especially by the inhabitants of the tropics. It would,\r\nhowever, require a large volume to enumerate all the purposes for\r\nwhich they are employed. It can, however, safely be asserted that\r\nno family in the great vegetable kingdom more completely meets the\r\nnecessities of millions of people than does that of the noble and\r\never-beautiful Palmaceæ.\r\n\r\nLike Martius, we always found in the contemplation of the palm a source\r\nof special joy and peace. To him the palm was what literature was to\r\nCicero, a consolation in trial and affliction, and the delight and\r\ninspiration of maturer years. In the palm we always found something\r\nto elevate the mind, something that fascinated us and stirred our\r\nemotions in a manner that often surprised us. For us, as for myriads\r\nof others who have lived and struggled and attained the goal of the\r\nheart's desire, the palm was the emblem of victory, of a higher and\r\nbetter life beyond the tomb, of a happy, glorious immortality.\r\n\r\nAs we gazed in silent delight at the broad expanse of the\r\ngreen-carpeted savanna, adorned with the graceful, columnar shafts and\r\nfeathery fronds of the ever-beautiful, ever-majestic palm, we could\r\neasily fancy ourselves in the valley of the Euphrates or in the plains\r\nof Babylon, as described by Herodotus and Xenophon. And, without any\r\neffort of the imagination, we could descry, in a palm-shaded village\r\nin the vista before us, Jericho, as Moses saw it, when the Land of\r\nPromise was a land of palms, as well as a land of milk and honey, and\r\nwhen Judea was so prolific in palms that one of its representatives\r\nwas chosen as the symbol of the country. [265] We dreamed of Zenobia's\r\nfair capital, Palmyra--the city of Palms--of the land of the Nile,\r\nwhere Isis and Osiris carried palms as the symbol of their fecund\r\npower. We recalled the enthusiastic words of the ancient poets--Hebrew\r\nand Greek--in praise of the gracefulness and magnificence of the palm,\r\nand the plaintive elegy of Abdul Rhaman, first calif of Cordoba,\r\nwho, exiled from Damascus, his home, thus addresses the date palm,\r\nthat reminds him of the land of his birth: \"Thou, also, beautiful\r\npalm, art here a stranger. The sweet zephyr of Algaraba descends and\r\ncaresses thy beauty. Thou growest in this fertile soil and raisest\r\nthy crown to the skies. What bitter tears thou would'st shed, if,\r\nlike me, thou hadst feeling!\" [266]\r\n\r\nWhile thus musing on the glories of the past and contemplating the\r\nsplendors of the present, which were passing in rapid succession\r\nbefore our enchanted vision, we instinctively repeated the words of\r\nthe reverent poet-naturalist, Martius, who, contemplating the marvels\r\nof the tropical palm-world, expressed the depth of his emotion by\r\nthe two words, Sursum corda--hearts heavenward!\r\n\r\nJust then our reveries were suddenly and unexpectedly interrupted.\r\n\r\nWe had, early in the day, been congratulating ourselves on making\r\nour voyage down the river without delay and without accident. We\r\nwere now within sight of Barranquilla and expected to land in\r\nless than an hour. We were in the full enjoyment of one of those\r\ndelightful day-dreams that we always loved to indulge in, whenever\r\nFlora displayed before us, as she did then, her choicest treasures,\r\nwhen suddenly, without premonition of any kind, there was a violent\r\nlurch of the boat, a creaking and a crushing noise abaft, a quick\r\nstoppage of the engine, all of which indicated that something unusual,\r\nif not serious, had befallen our ill-fated craft. A hasty examination\r\nshowed that the steamer had collided with a sunken tree, and that\r\nseveral of the float-boards of the stern-wheel had been loosened,\r\nor partially wrenched from their places. After considerable delay\r\nthe boatmen were able so to repair the damage that we were able to\r\ncontinue on our journey, although at a reduced speed.\r\n\r\nVery shortly afterwards there was a second and a much severer\r\ncrash. We had encountered another hidden tree. This time several\r\nof the float-boards were carried away from the wheel entirely, and\r\nthe wheel itself was so racked that repair, while on the river,\r\nwas quite impossible. Fortunately, as we were going down stream,\r\nwe were able to float to the entrance of the canal that leads to the\r\ndocks of Barranquilla. Here a crowd of stevedores from the town soon\r\ncongregated. These men, mostly negroes, agreed, after some parleying,\r\nto haul the boat to the landing place. They, accordingly, took hold\r\nof a long rope, which was thrown ashore, and soon the disabled steamer\r\nwas being conveyed to her moorings in the same fashion as a canal boat\r\nis drawn along by mules in tandem. We reached the wharf the fifth day\r\n[267] after leaving Honda, just as the sun was setting, and when the\r\ncustoms officers were about to close their office for the night. They,\r\nhowever, kindly allowed us to disembark and we were soon on our way\r\nto a hotel.\r\n\r\n\"How fortunate,\" C. exclaimed, \"that this accident did not occur\r\nmidway up the river!\" Such a mishap would have entailed much suffering\r\nand might have delayed our arrival at Barranquilla, for days, if not\r\nfor weeks. And considering our happy escape from the detentions and\r\ndisasters from which so many others had suffered, and the peculiar\r\nepisode that characterized our last hours on the Magdalena, we were\r\nforcibly reminded of the words of Dante:--\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Let not the people be too swift to judge.\r\n\r\n                                    For I have seen\r\n        A bark, that all her way across the sea\r\n        Ran straight and speedy, perish at the last\r\n        E'en in the haven's mouth.\" [268]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nIN THE TRACK OF PLATE-FLEETS AND BUCCANEERS\r\n\r\n\r\n                \"O'er the glad waters of the dark blue sea,\r\n                Our thoughts are boundless and our souls as free,\r\n                Far as the breeze can bear, the billows foam,\r\n                Survey our empire and behold our home!\r\n                These are our realms, no limits to their sway,\r\n                Our flag the sceptre all who meet obey.\r\n                Ours the wild life in tumult still to range\r\n                From toil to rest, and joy in every change.\"\r\n\r\n                                            --Byron, The Corsair.\r\n\r\n\r\nBarranquilla, a city of about sixty-five thousand inhabitants,\r\nis notable for being the chief port of entry of Colombia. It is\r\nestimated that two-thirds of the commerce of the republic converges\r\nat this point. To us, coming from the interior of the country, where\r\ncomparatively little business is transacted, the place seemed to be a\r\nmarvel of activity and business enterprise. It counts a large number\r\nof important business houses, the chief of which are controlled\r\nby foreigners. It is provided with tram-ways, electric lights,\r\ntelephones, a good water supply and, in many respects, reminds one\r\nof our progressive cities on the Gulf Coast. Many of the private\r\nresidences, especially in the more elevated quarters of the city,\r\nare models of comfort and good taste. The average annual temperature\r\nis 80° F., but the refreshing breezes from the Caribbean make it seem\r\nless. At no time during our sojourn of more than a week in the city,\r\nhad we reason to complain of the excessive heat of which so much has\r\nbeen said and written.\r\n\r\nAlthough Barranquilla was founded in 1629, it is only within the\r\nlast third of a century that it has come to the front as the leading\r\nentrepot of the republic. Before this time, Cartagena and Santa Marta\r\nwere Colombia's principal ports and busiest marts. This change in\r\nthe relative importance of these three ports was effected by the\r\nconstruction of a great pier at Savanilla and connecting it with\r\nBarranquilla by rail. After this both Cartagena and Santa Marta\r\nrapidly dwindled in importance as distributing centres, while the\r\ngrowth of Barranquilla was correspondingly rapid. Were it not for the\r\nbanana industry, controlled by the United Fruit Company, an American\r\ncorporation, Santa Marta's trade would now be little more than nominal.\r\n\r\nBut why, it will be asked, do not ocean vessels dock at Barranquilla\r\ninstead of unloading so far away from the city? The usual answer given,\r\nand in a way the correct one, is that the Magdalena is not deep enough\r\nto permit the passage of so large vessels. We saw one venturesome\r\nocean liner stranded near the mouth of the river on a sand bar, where\r\nit had been washed and pounded for nearly two years. Many attempts had\r\nbeen made to float her but without success, and it seemed as if she\r\nwas destined to remain a captive of the treacherous shoal that had\r\nso long held her in its unyielding grasp. The real reason, however,\r\nfor not having the landing place where it should be--in the city\r\nitself--is the lack of the capital that would be required to dredge\r\nthe river, and enlarge the canal, and keep them both in a condition\r\nthat would insure the safe passage of vessels of heavy draft. Given\r\nan engineer like James B. Eades, of Mississippi jetties fame, and\r\nthe necessary capital, the improvement would soon be effected.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Bogotá we had planned to reach Barranquilla in time\r\nto take an English steamer from Savanilla--Puerto Colombia--to\r\nColon. We then flattered ourselves that, after reaching the mouth of\r\nthe Magdalena, we should have no difficulty in making connection for\r\nany part of the world, and that delay in continuing our journey was\r\nthe last thing to be apprehended.\r\n\r\nBut alas and alack! Where we least expected it, we were doomed to\r\ndisappointment. We had crossed the continent without a single failure\r\nto connect, as we had anticipated, except at Barrigón, where we were\r\ndetained a day, and had not experienced a single disagreeable delay,\r\nand now, when we had reached the world lines of travel, we were\r\ninformed that the steamer we had intended to take had been laid up\r\nfor repairs, and that we should be obliged to wait a week before\r\nanother would arrive.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to do but resign ourselves to the\r\ninevitable. Barranquilla is not a place where a traveler would\r\ncare to remain long as a matter of choice, but we managed to make\r\nourselves comfortable. The time passed more quickly and pleasantly\r\nthan we anticipated, but, just as we began to make preparations for our\r\ndeparture, we found ourselves the victims of a new disappointment. The\r\nsteamer that we were to take was forbidden to land at Savanilla, in\r\nconsequence of having stopped at Trinidad, which was then reported\r\nto be infected by the bubonic plague.\r\n\r\n\"Truly,\" we said, \"we are getting into the region of mañana--delay and\r\ndisappointment--just at the moment when we thought we were leaving it.\"\r\n\r\nWe had been so fortunate thus far, and that too in lands where, we had\r\nbeen assured, everything would be against us and where the best-laid\r\nplans would be frustrated, that we were ill prepared for delay where\r\nit was least expected. Happily for us, however, a steamer, having\r\na clean bill of health, but belonging to another line, was due in a\r\nfew days, and this we determined to take, for we did not know when we\r\nshould be able to get another one. When once the plague appears in the\r\nWest Indies, or on the mainland bordering the Caribbean, quarantine\r\nregulations are strictly enforced, and the luckless traveler may find\r\nhimself a prisoner for weeks, and even months, in a place that is\r\npractically destitute of the commonest comforts and conveniences of\r\nlife. Then, indeed, his lot--especially if he is not familiar with\r\nthe language of the country--is far from enviable. I have met with\r\nmany people who, under such untoward conditions, had to endure the\r\ngreatest privations and sufferings.\r\n\r\nBy the greatest good fortune, it seemed to us, we finally got aboard a\r\ngood, comfortable vessel. It was not, however, bound for our objective\r\npoint--Colon--but for Puerto Limon, in Costa Rica. This, although we\r\ndid not know it at the time, was a blessing in disguise. Had we gone\r\ndirectly to Colon, we should have been obliged to spend some time in\r\nquarantine. By going to Costa Rica, we escaped this and were able,\r\nduring a week, to combine utile dulci--study with pleasure--under\r\nthe most favorable and delightful circumstances.\r\n\r\nFrom Puerto Colombia we went directly to Cartagena--a city that,\r\nin some respects, possessed a greater interest for us than any we\r\nhad hitherto visited in South America. We entered this famous harbor,\r\nlarge enough to hold all the navies of the world, early in the morning,\r\njust as the sun was beginning to impart a subdued roseate glow to\r\nthe tiled roofs of the loftier buildings of the once flourishing\r\nmetropolis of New Granada.\r\n\r\nThe picture of Cartagena, as it first presented itself to our view,\r\nwas one of rarest loveliness. As we then saw it, it was not unlike\r\nVenice as seen from Il Lido or from the deck of a steamer arriving\r\nfrom Trieste. From another point as we advanced into the placid bay,\r\nwe discerned in it a resemblance to Alexandria, as viewed from the\r\nMediterranean. As Venice has been called the Queen of the Adriatic,\r\nso also, and justly, did the beauteous city of Pedro de Heredia long\r\nbear the proud title of Reina de las Indias y Reina de los Mares,\r\nQueen of the Indies and Queen of the Seas.\r\n\r\nOne of the first cities built on Tierra Firme, it was also, for a\r\nlong period, one of the most important places in the New World. Its\r\nfortifications and the massive walls that girdle it have long been\r\ncelebrated. Even now these are the features that have the greatest\r\nattraction for the visitor. Stupendous is the only word that adequately\r\ncharacterizes them. Their immensity impresses one like the pyramids of\r\nGhizeh, and this impression is fully confirmed when one learns their\r\ncost and the number of men engaged in their construction. It is said\r\nthat from thirty to one hundred thousand men were employed on this\r\ntitanic undertaking, and that it cost no less than fifty-nine million\r\ndollars--a fabulous sum for that period. This reminds one of what\r\nhistorians relate regarding the building of the pyramid of Cheops,\r\nthe greatest and most enduring of human monuments, as the walls of\r\nCartagena are the grandest and most imposing evidence of Spanish power\r\nin the western hemisphere. So great was the draft made on the royal\r\nexchequer by the construction of these massive walls that Philip II,\r\nso the story runs, one day seized a field glass and looking in the\r\ndirection of Cartagena, murmured with disenchanted irony: \"Can one\r\nsee those walls? They must be very high, for the price paid?\"\r\n\r\nNo wonder that Charles V was always in need of money, and that,\r\nto secure it, he was forced to mortgage a large tract of land in\r\nVenezuela to the Welsers, the German bankers of Augsburg. No wonder\r\nthat Philip II, despite the stream of gold and silver that flowed into\r\nhis coffers from his vast possessions beyond the sea, was, during the\r\nsecond half of his reign, forced to see his royal signature dishonored\r\nby bankers who refused him further credit!\r\n\r\nCartagena in Colombia was named after Cartagena in Spain, as the\r\nSpanish city, founded by Hasdrubal as an outpost to serve in future\r\nPunic campaigns, was named from the celebrated Tyrian emporium that\r\nwas so long the rival of Rome. And when the sons of the Caribbean\r\nCarthage sailed up the Cauca to establish new colonies and extend the\r\nsphere of Spanish influence and enterprise, they commemorated their\r\ntriumph, and exhibited their loyalty to the land of their birth,\r\nby founding still another Carthage--the Cartago of the Upper Cauca.\r\n\r\nAnd what an eventful story is that of the Caribbean Cartagena! What\r\nchanges has she not witnessed! What fortunes of war has she not\r\nexperienced! What disasters has she not suffered! Like her African\r\nprototype, whose very strength caused her rival on the Tiber to\r\ndecree her downfall, Cartagena seemed to be singled out for attack\r\nby all the enemies of Spain for long generations. Her cyclopean\r\nwalls, that seemed to render her impregnable, did not save her. Time\r\nand again she was assaulted by pirates and buccaneers, who levied\r\nheavy tributes and carried off booty of inestimable value. Drake,\r\nMorgan, Pointis [269] and Vernon attacked and ravaged her in turn,\r\nbut unlike the Carthage of the hapless Dido, she still survives. And\r\nnotwithstanding the four long sieges she sustained and the vicissitudes\r\nthrough which she passed during the protracted War of Independence,\r\nwhen she was hailed as La Ciudad Heroica--The heroic city--her walls,\r\nafter three and a half centuries, are still in a marvelous state of\r\npreservation and evoke the admiration of all who behold them.\r\n\r\nEverywhere within the city, which during colonial times enjoyed\r\nthe monopoly of commerce with Spain, are evidences of departed\r\ngrandeur. Churches, and palaces and monastic institutions, beautiful\r\nand grandiose, still retain much of the glamour of days long past. In\r\nthe charming plazas, shaded by graceful palms and adorned with\r\nrichest tropical verdure and bloom; along the narrow streets flanked\r\nby spacious edifices and ornamented with multi-colored balconies\r\nand curiously grated windows, one feels always under the spell of\r\na proud and romantic past, of an age of chivalry of which only the\r\nmemory remains. The architecture of many of the buildings, erstwhile\r\nhomes of wealth and culture and refinement, is Moorish in character\r\nand carried us back to many happy days spent in fair Andalusia in\r\nits once noble capitals, Granada and Seville.\r\n\r\nStrolling along the grass-grown pavements of Cartagena, we note in the\r\nformer flourishing metropolis what Wordsworth observed in Bruge's town,\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \"Many a street\r\n        Whence busy life has fled.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we also discern unmistakable signs of an awakening to a new\r\nlife, and of the dawn of a new era of prosperity and mercantile\r\ngreatness. Notwithstanding the venerable years in which she is at\r\npresent arrayed, we can, without being horoscopists, safely presage\r\nthat the benignant stars are sure to bring\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"What fate denies to man,--a second spring.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo enjoy the best view of Cartagena, one must ascend an eminence to\r\nthe east of the city called La Popa, from its fancied resemblance to\r\nthe lofty stern of a fifteenth century ship. There, seated under an\r\numbrageous cocoa palm, fully five hundred feet above the beautiful\r\niris-blue bay that washes the walls that encircle the city, one has\r\nbefore him one of the most charming panoramas in the world; one which\r\nduring more than three centuries, was the witness of some of the most\r\nstirring events in history. In the broad, steep harbor, protected\r\non all sides by frowning fortresses, the Spanish plate-fleets long\r\nfound refuge from corsairs and sea rovers. It was here, when pirates\r\nand buccaneers made it unsafe to transport treasure by the Pacific,\r\nthat gold and silver were brought from Bolivia to Peru, Ecuador and\r\nNew Granada by way of the Andean plateau and the Cauca and Magdalena\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nOne is stupefied when one considers what an expenditure of energy\r\nthis implied. Think of transporting gold and silver ingots a distance\r\nof more than two thousand miles, over the arid deserts of Bolivia and\r\nPeru, and across the chilly punas and paramos of the lofty Cordilleras;\r\nof securing it against loss in passing along dizzy ravines, across\r\nfurious torrents, through the almost impenetrable forests of New\r\nGranada, often infested by hostile Indians. And remember, that, for\r\na part of this long distance, these heavy burdens had to be carried\r\nby human beings, for no other means of transportation were available.\r\n\r\nAnd when one considers the amount of the treasure thus transported\r\nfrom points as distant as the flanks of Potosi and the auriferous\r\ndeposits of the distant Pilcomayo, the wonder grows apace. According\r\nto the estimates of reliable historians, the amount of gold and silver\r\nimported into Spain from her American possessions from 1502 to 1775 was\r\nno less than the colossal sum of ten billion dollars. [270] Nearly two\r\nbillions of this treasure were taken from the famous silver mines of\r\nPotosi alone. The greater part of the bullion from Peru was shipped\r\nby the South Sea to Panama and Nombre de Dios and thence carried to\r\nSpain in carefully guarded plate-fleets. But after the pirates and\r\nbuccaneers became active along the western coast of South America,\r\nthe ingots of the precious metals, yielded by the mines between\r\nChile and the Caribbean were transported overland and deposited in\r\ncarefully guarded galleons awaiting them in the harbor of the Queen\r\nof the Indies.\r\n\r\nBut even then the treasure was not safe. It was, indeed, much more\r\nexposed on the way from Cartagena to Palos and Cadiz than it had\r\nbeen from the time it had been dispatched from the smelter until its\r\narrival at the great stronghold on the Caribbean. For then, suddenly\r\nand without warning, like a flock of vultures that had scented carrion\r\nfrom afar, there gathered from all points of the compass English\r\nbuccaneers, French filibusters, and Dutch freebooters and harassed\r\nthe galleons until they succumbed. So successful did these daring sea\r\nrobbers eventually become that no galleon dared to venture alone on\r\nthe waters of the Indian seas, and only strongly guarded plate-fleets\r\ncould hope to escape capture by their alert and venturesome enemies,\r\nwho swarmed over the Caribbean from the Lesser Antilles to Yucatan,\r\nand terrorized the coast of the Spanish Main from one end to the other.\r\n\r\nOne loves to conjecture what might have been if Charles V or Philip\r\nII had been endowed with the genius of a Napoleon or a Cæsar. Masters\r\nof the greater part of Europe, and undisputed sovereigns of the major\r\nportion of the Western Hemisphere, with untold wealth continually\r\npouring into their treasury, then was the time--the only time,\r\nprobably, in the history of the modern world--to realize Dante's fond\r\ndream of a universal monarchy. But neither Charles nor Philip had the\r\ngenius required, and the one opportunity, that ever presented itself,\r\nof making Spanish possessions coextensive with the world's surface,\r\nwas lost and lost forever.\r\n\r\nThe sun was rapidly approaching the western horizon when we took our\r\ndeparture from the beautiful and picturesque harbor of the Queen of\r\nthe Seas. In a short time the coast of what was once known as Castilla\r\ndel Oro--Golden Castile--had disappeared from our view and the prow of\r\nour vessel was directed towards the historic land of Costa Rica--the\r\nRich Coast--discovered by Columbus during his fourth voyage.\r\n\r\nThe night following our visit to Cartagena was an ideal one, a\r\nnight for wakeful dreams and the sweet delights of reverie. There was\r\nscarcely a ripple on the waters, and the stars of the firmament seemed\r\nto shine with an unwonted effulgence. All was peace and tranquillity,\r\nand everything seemed to proclaim the joy of living.\r\n\r\nHow different was old Benzoni's experience in these same waters and\r\nduring the same season of the year! \"In consequence of contrary winds,\"\r\nhe tells us, \"we remained there seventy-two days, and in all this time\r\nwe did not see four hours of sunshine. Almost constantly and especially\r\nat night, there was so much heavy rain, and thunder and lightning,\r\nthat it seemed as if both heaven and earth would be destroyed.\" [271]\r\n\r\nThe experience of Columbus was even more terrifying. In a letter to\r\nFerdinand and Isabella, giving an account of his fourth voyage, the\r\ngreat navigator informs them that, so great was the force of wind\r\nand current, he was able to advance only seventy leagues in sixty\r\ndays. During this time, there was no \"cessation of the tempest,\r\nwhich was one continuation of rain, thunder and lightning; indeed,\r\nit seemed as if it were the end of the world.... Eighty-eight days\r\ndid this fearful tempest continue, during which I was at sea, and saw\r\nneither sun nor stars.\" [272] The name Cape Gracias á Dios--Thanks\r\nbe to God--which he gave to the easternmost point of Nicaragua and\r\nHonduras, still remains to attest his gratitude for his miraculous\r\nescape from what for many long weeks seemed certain destruction.\r\n\r\nIt was our good fortune, during all our cruising in the Caribbean,\r\nto enjoy the most delightful weather, but we never appreciated it\r\nso much as we did during our voyage from Cartagena to Puerto Limon,\r\nand more especially during the first night after our departure from\r\nthe Colombian coast. We were then sailing in waters that had been\r\nrendered famous by the achievements of some of the most remarkable men\r\nnamed in the annals of early American discovery and conquest, where\r\nevery green island and silent bay, every barren rock and sandy key,\r\nhas its legend, and where, at every turn, one breathes an atmosphere\r\nof romance and wonderland.\r\n\r\nAt one time we were following in the wake of the illustrious Admiral\r\nof the Ocean; at another we were in the track of Amerigo Vespucci\r\nand Juan de la Cosa, that brave Biscayan pilot who was regarded by\r\nhis companions as an oracle of the sea. Rodrigo de Bastidas, Alonso\r\nde Ojeda and Diego de Nicuesa passed this way, as did Vasco Nuñez de\r\nBalboa, the discoverer of the Great South Sea, who, his countrymen\r\ndeclared, never knew when he was beaten, and who, according to Fiske,\r\nwas \"by far the most attractive figure among the Spanish adventurers\r\nof that time.\" [273] The Pizarros and Almagro sailed these waters,\r\nbefore embarking at Panama on that marvelous expedition which resulted\r\nin the conquest of Peru. And so did Orellana, the discoverer of the\r\nAmazon, and Belalcazar, the noted conquistador and rival of Quesada\r\nand Federmann. And then, too, there was Gonzalez Davila, the explorer\r\nof Nicaragua, and Hernando Cortes, the conqueror of Mexico.\r\n\r\nAnd last, but the best and noblest of them all, was the gentle and\r\nindefatigable Las Casas, the protector of the aborigines and the\r\nApostle of the Indies, whose memory is still held in benediction in all\r\nLatin America. His voluminous writings, making more than ten thousand\r\npages octavo, much of which is devoted to the defense of the Indians,\r\nconstitute a monument which will endure as long as men shall love truth\r\nand justice. But his greatest monument--one that is absolutely unique\r\nin the history of civilization--is his former diocese of Chiapa, which\r\nis just northwest of the land towards which we are sailing. When he\r\nwent to take possession of it, it was occupied by savage warriors who\r\nhad successfully resisted all attempts made by the Spaniards to subdue\r\nthem. It was considered tantamount to certain death to enter their\r\njealously-guarded territory. But Las Casas, armed only with the image\r\nof the Crucified and the gospel of peace, soon had these wild children\r\nof the forest prostrate at his feet, begging him to remain with them\r\nas their father and friend. So successful was his work among them that\r\nthe land which, before his arrival, had been known as La Provincia\r\nde Guerra--The Province of War--was thereafter called La Provincia de\r\nVera Paz--The Province of True Peace--a name it bears to the present\r\nday. And more remarkable still, this particular part of Guatemala is\r\nsaid to have a denser Indian population, in proportion to its area,\r\nthan any other part of Latin America. Truly, this is a monument worthy\r\nof the name, and one that would have appealed most strongly to the\r\nloving heart of the courageous protector of the Indians. [274]\r\n\r\nBut discoverers and explorers, conquistadores and apostles, were\r\nnot the only men who have rendered this part of the world forever\r\nmemorable. There were others, but many of them were of a vastly\r\ndifferent type. I refer to the pirates and Buccaneers, who so long\r\nspread terror in these parts and ultimately destroyed the commercial\r\nsupremacy of Spain in the New World, and contributed so materially\r\nto the final extinction of her sovereign power. Many of them have\r\nwritten their names large on the scroll of history and often in\r\ncharacters of blood. Many of them were pirates of the worst type,\r\nwho flew at every flag they saw, who recognized no right but might,\r\nand whose sole object was indiscriminate robbery on both sea and\r\nland. These outlaws, however, have no interest for us now.\r\n\r\nBesides these unscrupulous and sanguinary pirates, there was another\r\nclass of men whom their friends and countrymen insist on grouping\r\nin a class by themselves. The majority of these were Englishmen, of\r\nwhom the most distinguished representatives, along the Spanish Main,\r\nwere Raleigh, Hawkins and Drake. When these men did not act under\r\nsecret commissions from their government, they relied on its tacit\r\nconnivance in all the depredations for which they are so notorious. In\r\nthe light of international law, as we now understand it, they were\r\nas much pirates as those who attacked the ships of all nations, and\r\nas such they have always been regarded by Spanish writers. All three\r\nof the men just mentioned made their raids on Spanish possessions\r\nwhile England was at peace with Spain. Thus the two nations were at\r\npeace when Drake sacked Panama in 1586, as they were at peace when\r\nRaleigh attacked Trinidad in 1595. These sea rovers lived up to the\r\nold forecastle phrase, \"No peace beyond the line\" [275] and recognized,\r\nat least in the Spanish territory in the New World, no law of nations\r\nexcept that\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"They should take who have the power,\r\n        And they should keep who can.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The case,\" as old Fuller quaintly puts it in his Holy and Profane\r\nState, \"was clear in sea-divinity; and few are such infidels as not\r\nto believe doctrines which make for their own profit.\"\r\n\r\nSo far as England acquiesced in, or connived at what the Spaniards\r\nalways denounced as downright piracy, it was doubtless ever with\r\nthe view of weakening the menacing power of the dominant Spanish\r\nempire. She was also actuated by \"an aggressive determination\r\nto break down the barriers with which Spanish policy sought to\r\nenclose the New World and to shut out the way to the Indies.\" In this\r\ndetermination England had the sympathy of France and often its active\r\ncoöperation. For a similar reason Dutch sea rovers swarmed over the\r\nCaribbean Sea. All were aware of the magnitude of the struggle in\r\nwhich they were engaged, and realized that their existence as nations\r\ndepended on their crippling their common enemy by striking at the\r\nsources of his power in the Western Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nMuch might be said of the reckless audacity, brilliant achievements\r\nand skillful seamanship of these privateers or pirates--whatever one\r\nchooses to call them--that read more like fable or romance than sober\r\nchronicles of authentic fact, but space does not permit. Besides,\r\nwe are more interested in another class of sea rovers of a later\r\ndate, whose names and exploits are inseparably connected with the\r\nWest Indies and the great South Sea. I refer to the Buccaneers, or,\r\nas they called themselves, the Brethren of the Coast.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of these extraordinary adventurers is derived mainly from\r\nthemselves. Of English Buccaneers the most interesting narratives have\r\nbeen left us by Sharp, Cowley, Ringrose and Dampier. The Frenchman,\r\nRavenau de Lussan, has also left us a record of value. The most popular\r\nwork, however, and the one that gives us the truest insight into\r\nthe manners and customs of the Brethren of the Coast, and recounts\r\nwith the greatest detail their deeds of daring and cruelty, is that\r\ngiven to the world by the Dutchman Esquemeling. It was entitled De\r\nAmericaensche Zee Rovers and was, on its appearance, immediately\r\ntranslated into the principal languages of Europe. The fact that\r\nEsquemeling was with the Buccaneers for five years, and was with them,\r\ntoo, on many of their most important expeditions, gave him unusual\r\nopportunities for collecting facts at first hand and studying the\r\nmethods of procedure of his reckless and often brutal associates.\r\n\r\nBy the Spaniards, the Brethren of the Coast have always been regarded\r\nas pirates--for the same reason as Raleigh, Drake and Hawkins and\r\ntheir associates were regarded as pirates--because they conducted their\r\nlawless operations when England and Spain were at peace. But there was\r\nthe same difference between Buccaneers and ordinary pirates as there\r\nwas between the corsairs just mentioned and ordinary pirates. The\r\nlatter attacked vessels of every nation, while the Buccaneers, like\r\nDrake and his compatriots, confined themselves to preying on Spanish\r\nshipping and sacking Spanish towns and strongholds.\r\n\r\nSome became Buccaneers because they had a grievance, real or\r\nimaginary, against the Spaniards, others because they chafed under\r\nthe monopolizing policy of the Spanish government, and wished to\r\nsecure a part of the ever-increasing trade with the New World, while\r\nothers still joined the ranks of the Brethren because they relished\r\nthe life of excitement and adventure it held forth, or because they\r\nfound it the easiest means of gaining a livelihood.\r\n\r\nEsquemeling was among the last of these classes. After being twice\r\nsold as a slave, he finally obtained his liberty when, to use his own\r\nwords, \"Though like Adam when he was first created, that is, naked and\r\ndestitute of all human necessaries, not knowing how to get my living,\r\nI determined to enter into the Order of the Pyrates or Robbers at\r\nSea.\" [276]\r\n\r\nThe cradle of the extraordinary \"Order of Pyrates,\" of which\r\nEsquemeling was to be the most distinguished chronicler, was Tortuga,\r\na small, rocky island off the northwest corner of Haiti. It was visited\r\nby Columbus during his first voyage, and, from the number of turtles\r\nfound there, was called Tortuga--the Spanish for turtle--the name\r\nit still retains. But small as it was, it was destined to become\r\n\"the common refuge of all sorts of wickedness, and the seminary,\r\nas it were of pyrates and thieves.\" [277]\r\n\r\nThe name Buccaneer is derived from \"bucan,\" a Carib word signifying a\r\nwooden gridiron on which meat is smoked. Originally, the term Buccaneer\r\nwas applied to the French settlers of Española, whose chief occupation\r\nwas to hunt wild cattle and hogs, which roamed over the island in large\r\nnumbers, and cure their flesh by bucaning it, that is smoking it on a\r\nbucan. [278] When they were driven from their business of bucaning by\r\nthe Spaniards, they took refuge in Tortuga, where they were soon joined\r\nby many English adventurers. Here they combined to make war on Spain\r\nin her American colonies, and for more than a half century they carried\r\nterror and destruction to every part of the Caribbean archipelago.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding their change of occupation, their old name\r\nof Buccaneer clung to them, and, as such, they are still known\r\nin history. Like the bold Vikings of the North, who were so long\r\nthe scourge of western and southern Europe, the Buccaneers were the\r\nscourge of Spanish America from Tortuga to Panama and from California\r\nto Patagonia. They warred against but one enemy--the one that had\r\nharassed and driven them from their peaceful avocation of bucaning,\r\nor had persecuted and oppressed their brethren in the peaceful pursuit\r\nof commerce, when the lands of their birth, or the countries to which\r\nthey owed allegiance, were unable or unwilling to protect them.\r\n\r\nLike the archpirate Drake, as the Spaniards called him, \"They swept\r\nthe sea of every passing victualler, and added the captured cargoes\r\nto the stores of game and fish it was their delight to catch. At\r\nintervals along the coast and amongst the wilderness of islands,\r\nmagazines were hidden, and into these were poured the stores that had\r\nbeen destined for the great plate-fleets. The shark-like pinnaces would\r\nsuddenly appear in the midst of the trade-route no one knew whence,\r\nand laden with food, as suddenly disappear no one knew whither.\"\r\n\r\nCompared with the Spaniards, they were usually in a small minority. But\r\nin their case, as in so many similar ones, it was not numbers, but\r\ntheir skill and courage, that gave them possession of rich galleons\r\nand placed the well-guarded plate-fleets at their mercy. At times the\r\nBuccaneers had only simple canoes--mere dugouts--but these, according\r\nto Esquemeling, were so fleet that they might well be called \"Neptune's\r\npost-horses.\" In these they went out to sea for a distance of eighty\r\nleagues and attacked heavily-armed men of war, and, before the Spanish\r\ncrew had time to realize what the daring sea rovers were after,\r\ntheir vessel was in the possession of their irresistible foe. [279]\r\n\r\nThey were strangers to fear, and no undertaking was too arduous,\r\nif the booty promised was sufficiently great. Danger and difficulty\r\nseemed only to whet their appetite for gold and fan their passions\r\nto a blaze. Their endurance of hunger and thirst and fatigue was as\r\nremarkable as their hardihood was phenomenal. They were loyal to one\r\nanother and divided the spoils they secured in strict accordance with\r\nthe agreement they had entered into beforehand. \"Locks and bolts were\r\nprohibited, as such things were regarded as impeaching the honor of\r\ntheir vocation.\"\r\n\r\nThey were religious after their own fashion. Thus it was forbidden\r\nto hunt or cure meat on Sunday. Before going on a cruise, they\r\nwent to church to ask a blessing on their undertaking, and, after a\r\nsuccessful raid, they returned to the house of God to sing a hymn of\r\nthanksgiving. We are told of a French captain who shot a filibuster\r\nfor irreverence in church during divine service, and we also read\r\nof Captain Hawkins once throwing dice overboard when he found them\r\nbeing used on the Lord's day. [280]\r\n\r\nHow all this reminds one of the conduct of that pitiless old slaver,\r\nJohn Hawkins, who frequently enjoined on his crew to \"serve God daily,\"\r\nand who, after escaping a heavy gale on his way from Africa to the West\r\nIndies, whither he was bound with a shipload of kidnapped negroes,\r\nsanctimoniously writes, \"The Almighty God, who never suffereth His\r\nelect to perish, sent us the ordinary breeze.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the Buccaneers frequently came into possession of immense\r\nsums of money, they would forthwith proceed to squander it in all\r\nkinds of dissipation and debauchery. \"Such of these pyrates,\" writes\r\nEsquemeling, \"will spend two or three thousand pieces of eight in a\r\nnight, not leaving themselves a good shirt to wear in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nAt first, the Buccaneers confined themselves to depredations on\r\nsea, but their unexpected successes on water soon emboldened them\r\nto attack the largest and richest towns on the Spanish Main. When\r\nthese were once in their power, they exacted from their inhabitants\r\na heavy tribute, and if it was not paid without delay, the hapless\r\npeople, regardless of age or sex, were subjected to the most cruel\r\nand unheard-of tortures. Puerto Principe, Maracaibo, Porto Bello,\r\nPanama and other places were captured in turn, and some of them, when\r\nsufficient ransom was not obtained, were burned to the ground. And so\r\ngreat and so hideous were the atrocities committed in some of these\r\nplaces that even Esquemeling has not the heart to do more than allude\r\nto them. They equaled, if they did not surpass, anything recorded of\r\nthe pirates of Barbary or Malabar, and showed what fiends incarnate\r\nmen can become when carried away by insatiate greed or the spirit of\r\nrapine and carnage.\r\n\r\nThe two Buccaneer leaders who most distinguished themselves for\r\ntheir diabolical ferocity and viciousness were L'Olonnois and\r\nMorgan. \"L'Olonnois,\" says Burney, \"was possessed with an ambition\r\nto make himself renowned for being terrible. At one time, it is\r\nsaid, he put the whole crew of a Spanish ship, ninety men, to death,\r\nperforming himself the office of executioner, by beheading them. He\r\ncaused the crews of four others vessels to be thrown into the sea;\r\nand more than once, in his frenzies, he tore out the hearts of his\r\nvictims and devoured them.\" [281]\r\n\r\nThis \"infernal wretch,\" as Esquemeling calls him, \"full of horrid,\r\nexecrable and enormous deeds, and debtor to so much innocent blood,\r\ndied by cruel and butcherly hands,\" for the Indians of Darien, having\r\ntaken him prisoner, \"tore him in pieces alive, throwing his body,\r\nlimb by limb, into the fire, and his ashes into the air, that no trace\r\nor memory might remain of such an infamous, inhuman creature.\" [282]\r\n\r\nOf Henry Morgan, who sacked Maracaibo and pillaged and burnt Panama,\r\nthe same authority declares he \"may deservedly be called the second\r\nL'Olonnois, not being unlike or inferior to him, either in achievements\r\nagainst the Spaniards or robberies of many innocent people.\" [283]\r\n\r\nHe did not, however, share the fate of L'Olonnois. Having found favor\r\nwith King Charles II, he was knighted and made deputy governor of\r\nJamaica, when he turned against his former associates, many of whom he\r\nhanged, while he delivered others up to their enemies, the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nFrom the time the Buccaneers made Tortuga a base of operations until\r\nthe Peace of Ryswick, in 1697, when they were finally suppressed, was\r\nmore than half a century. From this little island they spread over\r\nthe entire Caribbean sea and had places of rendezvous in Jamaica,\r\nSanta Catalina, the sequestered coves of the Gulf of Darien and in\r\nmany secret places along the Spanish Main. Their distinctive mark\r\nduring all this time, from which they never deviated, as it had been\r\nthe distinctive mark of pirates and privateers of England, France and\r\nHolland during nearly a century and a half before, was their incessant\r\nand relentless war against Spain; their determination to break her\r\npower and destroy that trade monopoly which she was so determined\r\nto retain.\r\n\r\nSo numerous and powerful did they eventually become that some of\r\ntheir leaders, notably Mansvelt and Morgan, dreamed of establishing\r\nan independent state. They had selected the small island of Santa\r\nCatalina--now known as Old Providence--just a short distance north\r\nof the course along which we are now sailing--as a starting point\r\nand, had they undertaken this project while the French and English\r\nBuccaneers were still united, they might have been successful. [284]\r\n\r\nTo us of the twentieth century, with our ideas of law and order,\r\nit seems strange that the pirates and Buccaneers of the West India\r\nislands and the Main should have been able to continue their nefarious\r\noperations for so long a period, and that they were so numerous. But,\r\nwhen we remember how they were countenanced and abetted by their\r\nrespective governments, how they were provided with letters of marque\r\nand reprisal, how they were openly assisted by the English [285]\r\nand French governors of the West Indies, how they were assisted\r\neven by their own sovereigns, [286] the wonder ceases. Considering\r\nthe love of adventure that distinguished this period of the world's\r\nhistory, and the princely fortunes that rewarded the successful raids\r\nof the daring sea rovers, it is surprising that the number was not\r\ngreater. If the same conditions now obtained, it is safe to say that\r\nthe seas would swarm with similar adventurers. It is interesting to\r\nsurmise what would now be the condition of the Western Hemisphere if\r\nthe Buccaneers, instead of confining themselves to capturing treasure\r\nships and sacking towns, had, like the bold Vikings, their antitypes,\r\nset out to conquer and colonize.\r\n\r\nWhatever else may be said of the Buccaneers, there can be no doubt\r\nthat it is to them that England owes her proud title of Mistress\r\nof the Seas. They gave birth to her great navy, and developed that\r\ngreat merchant marine whose flags are to-day seen in every port of\r\nthe world. They distinguished themselves in the destruction of the\r\nSpanish Armada, and closely followed Magellan in circumnavigating\r\nthe globe. They had a hand in the formation of the East India Company\r\nand were \"Britain's sword and shield for the defence of her nascent\r\ncolonies.\"\r\n\r\nOf the occupation of the Buccaneers one can assert what James Jeffrey\r\nRoche writes of that of the filibusters of the middle of the last\r\ncentury--that it \"is no longer open to private individuals. The\r\ngreat powers have monopolized the business, conducting it as such and\r\nstripping it of its last poor remnant of romance, without investing\r\nit with a scrap of improved morality.\" [287]\r\n\r\nAnd one can also say of them, what Byron writes of his Corsair,\r\nthat they left a\r\n\r\n\r\n                            \"Name to other climes\r\n        Linked with one virtue and a thousand crimes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE RICH COAST\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"But oh! the free and wild magnificence\r\n              Of Nature in her lavish hours doth steal,\r\n            In admiration silent and intense,\r\n              The soul of him who hath a soul to feel.\r\n\r\n            \"The river moving on its ceaseless way,\r\n              The verdant reach of meadows fair and green,\r\n              And the blue hills that bound the sylvan scene,--\r\n            These speak of grandeur, that defies decay,--\r\n            Proclaim the eternal architect on high,\r\n            Who stamps on all his works his own eternity.\"\r\n\r\n                                                    --Longfellow.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe afternoon preceding our arrival at Puerto Limon, the captain of\r\nour steamer called our attention to a wonderful mirage due south of\r\nus. High above the water--apparently midway between the sea and the\r\nsky--was suspended one of the islands of the Caribbean that stand off\r\nfrom the Panama coast. So far away was it from our course that, had\r\nit not been for the peculiar atmospheric conditions then prevailing,\r\nit would have been quite invisible, even with the aid of the most\r\npowerful glass. A beautiful, fantastic shape it exhibited as, seen\r\nthrough the trembling and shimmering air, it seemed to float in the\r\nhazy atmosphere. At first it was of a pearly-gray tint, then of a\r\nfustian-brown, and finally, as it became more distinct in outline,\r\nit shaded into a dark olive green. The apparition lasted for nearly\r\nan hour, when it gradually disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"The Vanishing Island of St. Brendan,\" exclaimed a young Celt who had\r\nbeen admiring the scene. And then he read for us what John Sparke,\r\na companion of Hawkins in the voyage of 1564, writes:\r\n\r\n\"Certaine flitting ilands, which haue beene oftentimes seene, and when\r\nmen approched neere them they vanished, ... and therefore it should\r\nseeme hee is not yet borne to whom God hath appoynted the finding of\r\nthem.\" [288]\r\n\r\nThe flitting islands that Sparke refers to were, it is true, supposed\r\nby him to be in the neighborhood of the Azores. But their location\r\nwas uncertain, at least the one named after the seafaring Irish\r\nmonk, for divers positions have been assigned it by cosmographers\r\nand mediæval writers. Among other peculiarities possessed by this\r\nisland was that it had an apparent motion towards the west--a motion\r\nthat was quite sufficient to have carried it at the beginning of the\r\ntwentieth century to the westernmost part of the Caribbean.\r\n\r\n\"In this motion westward,\" said C.--as our representative of classical\r\nlore--\"the Island of St. Brendan would have but followed the example\r\nset by the Elysian Fields and the Isles of the Blessed. Pindar and\r\nHesiod placed them in the Western Ocean, but much farther west than\r\nHomer had located his Elysium. As the years rolled by, the Fortunate\r\nIslands and the Gardens of the Hesperides, for these were but synonyms\r\nof the Isles of the Blessed, were also found, like St. Brendan's,\r\nto have moved towards the region of the setting sun. Subsequently,\r\nbirth was given to legends respecting a Transatlantic Eden and a\r\nMexican Elysium somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico or among the beauteous\r\nisles of the Caribbean Archipelago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true, very true,\" said one of our party, a good-natured German\r\nprivat-docent, who was perched hard by on what seemed to be the first\r\nreclining chair ever devised. It was a cumbersome structure about\r\nfour feet high, apparently modeled after one of those lofty bedsteads\r\nonce the vogue in certain parts of the Vaterland, and vastly different\r\nfrom the modern reclining chair so popular with ocean travelers, and\r\nso rickety that it threatened every moment to collapse and deposit\r\nits portly occupant--for he was a man of weight, physically as well as\r\nintellectually--on the hard floor of the hurricane deck. \"You are quite\r\nright, Sr. C. The Isles of the Blessed, like the Island of St. Brendan,\r\nare quite as ubiquitous and elusory as is the Terrestrial Paradise\r\ndescribed in Genesis. For learned men who have written about it have\r\nlocated it, at one time or another, in almost every part of the earth's\r\nsurface. Some maintain it was somewhere in the valley of Mesopotamia,\r\nothers that it was east of the Ganges, or near the head waters of\r\nthe Nile. Columbus imagined it was nigh the source of the Orinoco,\r\nwhile an American author--a Bostonian, I believe--some decades ago\r\npublished a work in which he endeavoured to prove that the seat of\r\nParadise was the North Pole. As for myself, I have never ventured\r\nto formulate a theory on any of these interesting subjects. They are\r\nout of my line. Davus sum non OEdipus.\"\r\n\r\nJust then there was a crash. Like the \"wonderful one-hoss shay,\"\r\nthe tottering old chair had collapsed and the docent lay sprawling\r\nunder the ruins.\r\n\r\n\"Caramba, donnerwetter!\" These two exclamations, so dear to the\r\nSpaniard and the German, when they wish to express surprise and\r\ndisgust, were emitted with an explosive violence that left no one\r\npresent in doubt as to what thoughts were uppermost in the mind of our\r\nfriend as he was endeavoring to extricate himself from the entangling\r\nframe. With the aid of some of the bystanders he finally regained\r\nhis feet, but he manifested no desire to continue the conversation\r\nso suddenly interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"Carajo, donnerblitz!\"--two expressions even more vigorous than\r\nthe preceding--constituted the finale to the performance that\r\nafforded amusement to all except the leading character, who disliked\r\nexceedingly the undignified position in which he had momentarily been\r\nplaced. Fortunately, the last call for dinner had been given just a\r\nfew moments previously, and we accordingly adjourned to the dining\r\nsaloon, where other matters absorbed the attention of the unlucky\r\ndocent as well as the spectators of his ungainly tumble.\r\n\r\nThe morning following the little episode just referred to, we were in\r\nsight of Costa Rica [289]--that rich coast--discovered by Columbus\r\nduring his eventful fourth voyage. The wooded lowlands, bordering\r\nthe sea, are clothed in a mantle of rich tropical verdure. A short\r\ndistance behind them arise the escarpments of the Central American\r\nCordillera, that is the scene of the activity of such noted volcanoes\r\nas Poas, Irazu and Turialba. Owing to the proximity of the Sierra\r\nto the sea, it appears much higher than it really is, and, when the\r\nweather is clear, it presents a picture of rare magnificence. This is\r\nparticularly the case when it is seen at sunrise, the time it first\r\nmet our view. Then we had before us the violet expanse of the summer\r\nsea canopied by the splendid azure vault of heaven, while before us\r\nstood up in all its majesty the gentian blue peak of the Cordillera\r\nthat gradually melted into crimson and then into gold.\r\n\r\nOwing to the reports that had been received at Limon regarding the\r\nplague at Trinidad, and the fear that it might already have reached the\r\nSpanish Main, none of the passengers were allowed to land until they\r\nhad passed, on the part of the health officers, an examination of more\r\nthan usual strictness. Fortunately, we had provided ourselves with a\r\nhealth certificate before leaving Barranquilla and were permitted to\r\nland after but little delay. Those, however, who could not exhibit\r\nsuch a document were at once ordered off to quarantine. Everyone,\r\nhowever, had to be vaccinated, unless one could produce evidence\r\nthat he had been vaccinated only a short time before. As very few\r\ncould present such evidence, the great majority had to submit--many\r\nof them much against their will--to being inoculated with the virus\r\nthat is supposed to render one immune against smallpox.\r\n\r\nWhile these operations were going on, we had an opportunity of getting\r\na good view of the coast in front of us. It had a special interest\r\nfor us, for it was the favored land along which Columbus sailed in\r\nhis last voyage in 1502. Here, before us, there is reason to believe,\r\nwas the land of Cariari, and, just a stone's throw from our steamer\r\nwas the charming island of Quiribri, which, on account of its beauty\r\nand the lovely trees with which it was adorned--palms and bananas and\r\nplatanos--the Admiral called El Huerto--the orchard. To-day it is known\r\nas the island of Uvita, and is used for quarantine. As we gazed on\r\nthis exquisite spot, provided with cozy cottages nestling among clumps\r\nof stately palms, and decked with beauteous flowers of every hue, we\r\nalmost regretted that we could not spend a few days there. Had we been\r\nsent there with the others we should certainly not have complained.\r\n\r\nSo fascinating was this place that Columbus anchored here between the\r\nisland and the mainland to give his crew an opportunity to refresh\r\nthemselves after their arduous voyage. And so fragrant were the\r\ngroves on the mainland that their perfumes were wafted out to the\r\nships. This, we have noted, was also the experience of the early\r\nexplorers of Florida.\r\n\r\nWhile here, Columbus held frequent converse with the Indians, whom he\r\nfound intelligent and well disposed. They brought him gifts of cotton,\r\ncloth and gold and evidently were inclined to enter into friendly\r\nrelations with their strange visitors. In his letter to Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella, referring to this land, he writes: \"There I saw a tomb in\r\nthe mountain side as large as a house, and sculptured. [290] This is\r\nremarkable as being the only passage in all the Admiral's writings\r\nwhich could warrant us in concluding that he ever set foot on the\r\nmainland of the New World.\r\n\r\nUntil the middle of the last century Port Limon was but a\r\nsmall rancheria--it did not deserve the name of village--of poor\r\nfishermen. Now it is the chief port of the republic and a flourishing\r\ntown of 6,000 inhabitants. Its present importance and prosperity\r\nare due to the completion of the railroad from this point to the\r\ncapital, San José, and to the fact that it is the principal centre\r\nof the rapidly-increasing banana industry controlled by the United\r\nFruit Company.\r\n\r\nThe place is quite modern in appearance, and were it not for its\r\nexuberant tropical vegetation, might easily pass for one of our\r\nenterprising Gulf Coast towns. It boasts of all modern improvements,\r\nhas good sanitation, broad streets, comfortable homes and a delightful\r\npark that, for wealth and variety of tree and shrub and flower,\r\nlooks like a well-kept botanic garden. While the white race is\r\nwell represented, the majority of the population is made up of West\r\nIndian negroes.\r\n\r\nDuring our travels among the Antilles and on the Spanish Main, we\r\nfrequently had occasion to note the importance of the banana and\r\nthe platano as articles of food, but it was not until our arrival in\r\nLimon that we had an opportunity of observing the extent to which the\r\ncultivation and shipment of these fruits have been carried. Here are\r\ntwo long iron piers at which one will occasionally find as many as\r\nsix or eight large steamers being freighted at the same time with\r\nthe golden fruit of Costa Rica, preparatory to distribution among\r\nthe leading ports along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts.\r\n\r\nThe culture of the banana in Costa Rica on an extensive scale is of\r\nrecent date. In 1880 but three hundred and sixty bunches were sent to\r\nthe United States. Now the amount shipped from Limon alone averages\r\nmore than a million bunches a month. During the year 1908 the number\r\nof bunches that left Port Limon aggregated more than thirteen million,\r\nand the amount shipped is rapidly increasing. In addition to the daily\r\nshipments made to the United States weekly cargoes are forwarded to\r\nFrance and England.\r\n\r\nBut great as are the proportions which the banana trade has already\r\nassumed, it is safe to say that it is as yet but in its infancy. What\r\nin most parts of our country and Europe has hitherto been practically\r\nunknown, or been regarded as a luxury beyond the reach of the poor,\r\nis now rapidly finding its way among all classes and at such prices\r\nthat even those of the most limited means can have it on their tables.\r\n\r\nThat which first impresses the visitor from the North is the large\r\nnumber of species of the Musa and the extraordinary number of uses made\r\nof them. Already fully forty species have been described and nearly a\r\nhundred varieties. Most of these bear fruit which is as agreeable as it\r\nis nutritious, and which is often of a flavor of the utmost delicacy.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made in a previous chapter to the extensive\r\nand varied use made of bananas and platanos by the peoples of tropical\r\nclimes, but even they have still much to learn regarding the food\r\nvalue of their great staple. Recent investigations have revealed the\r\nfact that the fruit of the Musa is henceforth to be regarded not only\r\nas one of the most wholesome and nutritious of foods, but also as one\r\nof the most important means of subsistence for the world's rapidly\r\nincreasing population. Even now it is felt that the supply of flesh\r\nmeat and cereals is rapidly becoming less than the demand, and too\r\nexpensive for the poor, and thoughtful men have already set to work\r\nto devise ways and means to meet the emergency. And one of the means\r\nsuggested is a more extensive cultivation of platanos and bananas,\r\nas well as a more general use of their manifold products.\r\n\r\nHumboldt long ago pointed out the great economic value of the banana\r\nand the platano as sources of food supply. [291] But he did not have\r\nthe data we now possess for arriving at just conclusions. As the\r\nresult of numerous experiments it is now known that bananas afford\r\nper acre one and a third times as much food as maize produces, two\r\nand a third times as much as oats, three times as much as buckwheat,\r\npotatoes and wheat; and four times as much as rye. Then the labor\r\ninvolved in the cultivation of the banana is far less than that\r\ndemanded for our northern crops. No skill is required, and unlike\r\nmany of our northern fruit-bearing trees, the banana and the platano\r\nare entirely exempt from insect pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nChemical analysis discloses the curious fact that bananas and\r\npotatoes are practically identical in composition. As compared with\r\nthe principal vegetables and fruits consumed in the United States and\r\nEurope, the food value of the banana and the platano stands in the\r\nratio of five to four in favor of the latter. Comparing banana flour,\r\na new product of this remarkable fruit, with the flour made from sago,\r\nwheat and maize, it is found that the nutritive value of all four is\r\nabout equal--the banana product being slightly in the lead.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of recent researches the commercial products obtained\r\nfrom the banana and platano have been greatly increased, while some\r\nof them are vastly different from anything that people who have been\r\nliving on them for thousands of years have ever dreamed. Among these\r\nare meal in the starchy state for making superior kinds of bread and\r\nporridge, flakes and meal in a dextrinous condition for the preparation\r\nof nourishing soups and puddings, sauces and fritters. [292] In dried\r\nslices it is used in the manufacture of beer and alcohol. Bananas are\r\nalso employed in making marmalades, for the manufacture of glucose\r\nand syrups for confectionery, and, dried entire without the peel,\r\nthey are put up in boxes like figs. Dried and roasted they afford\r\na nutritious beverage that is said to be a valuable substitute for\r\ncoffee and chocolate. Even the stems and leaves of the banana are\r\nput to use, for from them are manufactured paper and cordage.\r\n\r\nThese facts open up a splendid vista as to the future food\r\npossibilities of the tropics. They demonstrate also the wisdom of\r\ngiving more thought to this neglected part of the world, for it is\r\nto tropical America that the teeming millions of coming generations\r\nwill be obliged to look for much of their sustenance. Our northern\r\nclimes will be unable to meet the demands that will eventually be\r\nmade on them.\r\n\r\nBefore we boarded the train at Limon for San José, the capital of\r\nthe little republic, a young German, who had visited the lowlands\r\nthrough which the railway passes, said that we would there see the\r\nmost remarkable exhibition of vegetable growth in the world. \"It is,\"\r\nhe declared, \"the Urwelt\"--the primeval forest--\"in all its luxuriance\r\nand glory.\"\r\n\r\nAs he had never seen any tropical scenery outside of Costa Rica, and\r\nvery little of that, we, who had just come from the exuberant forest\r\nregions of the Magdalena and the Orinoco, were disposed to give little\r\nheed to his statement. Compared with Germany, the floral display of\r\nCosta Rica was doubtless something really marvelous in the estimation\r\nof our untraveled Teutonic friend, but it could not compare, we said\r\nto ourselves, with the wonders of plant life on which we had been\r\nfeasting our eyes during our journey among the Antilles and through\r\nthe Northern part of South America.\r\n\r\nOur conclusion, however, as we very soon discovered, was quite\r\nunwarranted. The vegetation of the lowlands and of the foothills\r\nof the Costa Rican Cordillera, as we noted on our way to San José,\r\nwas really something wonderful. It was the Urwelt in very truth, and\r\nexhibited a wealth of plant and tree, foliage and bloom such as must\r\nhave characterized the foreworld during its richest period. For miles\r\nupon miles along this picturesque railway, we reveled in the glories of\r\nthe virgin forest at its best--a dense, complicated mass of verdure,\r\na tousled, world-old jungle, surmounted by giants of the forest,\r\nloaded down with festoons of countless creepers and bound together\r\nby innumerable cable-like lianas, each of the richest hues. At one\r\ntime we were passing through valleys of enchantment, valleys pervaded\r\nby a languorous haze of lilac and indigo, like the smoke of incense,\r\nvalleys rendered musical by scores of hidden streams and tumultuous\r\ntorrents bridged over by an entanglement of green fathoms in depth. At\r\nanother we were winding around rugged crags and inaccessible peaks,\r\nnot bald and barren, as in our temperate climes, but covered to their\r\nvery summits with a tapestry of leaf and flower of the most vivid\r\ntropical tints, that at times resembled a cascade of palpitating\r\ncolor, of emerald foliage and glowing bloom. Here it was the crimson\r\nbouganvilla, there lovely aroides with spathes of delicate purple or\r\nimmaculate white, while hard by, fanned into motion by the trickery\r\nof the shifting breeze, were the slender tufts of the bamboo or the\r\ntenuous fronds of the ever-graceful fern tree. On all sides was a\r\nparade of foliage and blossom, a bravery of color to be found only\r\nin the tropics and then only in its most favored regions.\r\n\r\nThe astonishing variety and richness of the flora of Costa Rica is due\r\nto the fact that it is the connecting link between the floras of the\r\ntwo great continents of the North and the South. Besides exhibiting\r\nspecies peculiar to itself, it presents an infinitude of others\r\nfound in North and South America. Those, however, of South America\r\npredominate, the reason being that Costa Rica was connected with the\r\nsouthern continent long before it was united with that to the north.\r\n\r\nIt is a hundred and three miles from Limon to San José by rail. The\r\nroad, a narrow-gauge one, was constructed by an American, Mr. Minor\r\nC. Keith, and compares favorably with our narrow-gauge roads in\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. Many difficulties were encountered in laying\r\nthe track, some of which, especially those caused by landslides\r\nand the overflowing rivers, seemed at times insuperable. The most\r\nserious impediments, however, were due to the steaming, sweltering,\r\nputrid, fever-laden swamps between the coast and the foothills of the\r\nCordillera. So great was the mortality among the workmen on account\r\nof pernicious fevers that it is stated that this section of the line\r\ncost a human life for every tie that was laid. Like the valley of\r\nthe lower Magdalena, this part of Costa Rica is habitable only by\r\nnegroes. The white men who are called there by business make their\r\nsojourn as brief as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is along this route that are found the best and most extensive\r\nplatanales--banana plantations--of the country and, as a consequence,\r\nthere are many settlements and villages all along the railroad. And\r\nwhat banana plants are seen here! In height they resemble trees\r\nrather than plants. We saw some that were thirty-five feet high,\r\nbending under golden clusters of fruit weighing at times nearly\r\na hundred pounds. While sailing along the Orinoco and the Meta we\r\nthought that the platanales we saw on their banks were unrivaled\r\nfor magnitude of plants and wealth of fruitage, but they were fully\r\nequaled if not surpassed by those of Costa Rica.\r\n\r\nMost of the labor connected with the cultivation and shipment of\r\nbananas is performed by negroes from Jamaica and other West Indian\r\nislands. One sees their little frame houses, or shacks, scattered\r\nall along the road in the banana region, and their occupants have the\r\nsame jovial, happy-go-lucky disposition that characterizes the negro\r\nthe world over. Crowds of them, old and young, are always assembled\r\nat the station on the arrival of every train--attracted thither by\r\napparently the same reason that causes their brethren of the North\r\nin the cotton belt to flock to the depot when they hear the whistle\r\nof the locomotive--childlike curiosity and a desire to get the latest\r\nnews at the earliest possible moment.\r\n\r\nQuite a number of the female portion had sliced piñas--pineapples--for\r\nsale, but they asked as much for a single slice as a whole piña would\r\ncost in our markets, while for an entire pineapple they expected four\r\nor five times the price of this fruit in New York, and that in the land\r\nof the piña. They demanded extravagant prices because, I suppose, they\r\ntook it for granted that those who were able to travel in a Pullman\r\ncar, as our party did, would not, if the fruit was really wanted,\r\nbegrudge paying the amount asked, however exorbitant. But high as\r\nthe price was, the fruit was worth it and far more. It was the most\r\nluscious and fragrant fruit we had ever tasted, and incomparably\r\nexcelled the best that ever reaches our markets. It was so soft and\r\njuicy that it could be eaten with a spoon, and contained all the\r\nfabled virtues of nectar and ambrosia combined.\r\n\r\nIncredible as it may seem, where there were train loads of bananas\r\nat every siding, we were unable to get even a sample of edible fruit\r\nanywhere between Limon and San José, although we asked for it at every\r\nstopping place. All that was destined for shipment was unripe, and,\r\nwhile there were several other kinds of fruits for sale, there was\r\nnot a single ripe banana.\r\n\r\nThe negroes we saw along the railroad, as well as those observed in\r\nLimon, were a constant study for us, especially when congregated in\r\nlarge numbers in halls or churches. Like the negroes of Martinique\r\nthey are, in the words of Lafcadio Hearn, \"A population fantastic,\r\nastonishing--a population of the Arabian Nights.\" [293] They exhibit\r\nthe whole gamut of skin tints from the milk-white of the albino to\r\nthe coal-black of the Nubian.\r\n\r\nSome of the women are remarkable for beauty of form and delicacy\r\nof features. Lissome, statuesque, and of graceful bearing, they are\r\nJuliets in ebony, who exhibit the classic proportions of \"ox-eyed\"\r\nJuno or of the Venus of Milo. As simple as children, they, like their\r\nsisters in the Antilles, are as talkative as parrots and their laugh\r\nis as hearty as it is spontaneous.\r\n\r\nBut it is the dress of the Costa Rican negress that arrests attention,\r\nespecially when she is seen in public gatherings of any kind. Then\r\nthe design and color of her attire is bizarre in the extreme. She\r\nselects by preference the most flaunting and garish colors, and,\r\nwhen she appears in her Sunday costume, one would declare that she\r\nhad tried to combine the hues of tropical birds, and to mimic the\r\ngorgeousness of the blue-red-yellow macaw.\r\n\r\nThe description given by Sir F. Treves of the dress of the negress\r\nof Martinique, sums up in a few words the salient features of the\r\nSunday costume of her sister in Costa Rica. \"The headdress,\" he writes,\r\n\"is very picturesque. It consists of a 'madras,' an ample handkerchief\r\nwound about the head turban fashion, and finished by a projecting end,\r\nwhich stands up like the eagle's feather in an Indian's hair. The color\r\nof the madras will be usually a canary yellow striped with black. The\r\nhues of the dress are bewildering. Here are a skirt of roses and a\r\nfoulard of sky-blue, a gown of scarlet and yellow with a terra-cotta\r\nscarf across the breast, a dress of white striped with orange below a\r\nfoulard of green, a frock of primrose spotted with red and completed\r\nby a scarf of mazarine blue. Add to this the necklace of gold beads,\r\nthe heavy bracelets, the great earrings, and the 'trembling pins'\r\nthat fix the madras, and then realize over all, the white light of\r\na tropical moon.\" [294]\r\n\r\nThe two places along our route in which we were specially interested\r\nwere the village of Matina, in the fertile valley watered by the river\r\nof that name, and Cartago, which was founded by the Spaniards in 1563,\r\nand was, during colonial times, the capital of the country.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the eighteenth century Matina was a port of some\r\nimportance and the centre of the largest and best cacaotales--cacao\r\nhaciendas--in Costa Rica, but owing to the frequent incursions\r\nof pirates and Mosquito Indians, this fertile territory had to be\r\nevacuated. There was also another reason for abandoning it and that was\r\nthe hot, enervating, pernicious atmosphere, and the torrential rains,\r\nwhich were the causes of malaria and malignant fevers from which the\r\ndistrict was never exempt. So bad was the reputation of the Matina\r\nvalley in this respect that people, as the Costa Rican writer, Don\r\nRicardo F. Guardia, informs us in his Cuentos Ticos, \"used to confess\r\nand make their wills when they went to Matina, to the famous Matina\r\nwhich inspires fear in men and madness in mules, [295] as they used\r\nto say in those days when men were braver and mules better.\"--\r\n\r\nCartago--how often this Carthaginian name recurs in this part of the\r\nworld!--is a delightful place nearly a mile above sea level, with\r\na population of about seven thousand souls. It was founded in 1562\r\nby Juan Vazquez de Coronado, the real conqueror of Costa Rica. It\r\nhas a very salubrious climate with a mean annual temperature of 66°\r\nF. In 1841 it was almost entirely destroyed by an earthquake caused\r\nby a violent eruption of the volcano of Irazu, at the foot of which\r\nthe town is situated. It is noted as the seat of the Central American\r\nCourt of Justice, which was inaugurated here as one of the results\r\nof the Peace Congress held in Washington in 1907. In consequence of\r\nthe establishment of this tribunal here, the town has been called\r\nthe \"Hague of the New World.\" Mr. Andrew Carnegie has contributed\r\n$100,000 for the erection of a suitable edifice in which to hold the\r\nsessions of the court. The site selected for it is the most beautiful\r\nin the city, and the structure, on which work was begun without delay,\r\npromises to be the most attractive feature of Cartago.\r\n\r\nCosta Rica is justly celebrated for its coffee. In the London market it\r\nhas long been a favorite brand and always commands a high price. It\r\nhas a delicious aroma scarcely inferior to that of the best Java\r\nor Mocha berries. We preferred it to any we had found elsewhere in\r\nour tropical wanderings. The haciendas devoted to the cultivation of\r\ncoffee--especially those in the vicinity of Cartago and San José--are\r\nkept in splendid condition, and the trees are of exceptional vigor\r\nand productiveness.\r\n\r\nNext to bananas, coffee constitutes the most important export of\r\nthe republic. It was introduced from Havana about a century ago, and\r\none may yet see in Cartago the centenarian trees that supplied the\r\nseeds for the plantations of Costa Rica and other parts of Central\r\nAmerica. The value of the coffee and bananas annually exported from\r\nthe republic is much greater than that of all the other commodities\r\ncombined. Indeed, these two staples are to the commerce of Costa\r\nRica what tobacco and sugar are to Cuba. Columbus and his followers\r\nsearched these countries for gold and spices, but they found but little\r\nof either. If they could return now to these favored lands they would\r\ndiscover that their real treasures, more precious far than gold mines\r\nand groves of spice trees, lay in the indigenous banana and tobacco\r\nplants, and in the two exotic growths, coffee and sugar cane.\r\n\r\nThe schedule time of the train from Limon to San José, although only\r\none hundred and three miles, is about seven hours. This is due to\r\nthe numerous stops made and to the heavy grades up the flanks of\r\nthe Cordillera.\r\n\r\nOur arrival at the capital was signalized by a genuine tropical\r\ndownpour, such as we had not seen elsewhere during our journey. For\r\na while it seemed to justify the Spanish expression--llover á\r\ncántaros--to rain bucketfuls. But the aguacero--the name given these\r\nshort, heavy rainfalls--was of short duration. It was but one of those\r\ndaily afternoon showers that characterize the plateau during the winter\r\nseason--invierno, our summer--which extends from the month of May\r\nuntil the end of November. The dry or summer season--verano--lasts from\r\nDecember until May and is distinguished by absence of rain. The verano\r\nis the season of the northeast trade winds, which lose their humidity\r\nin crossing the Atlantic Cordillera. The monsoon, which comes from the\r\nsouthwest during the winter, does not encounter on the Pacific side\r\nmountains of sufficient height to condense the vapor with which it is\r\ncharged. Thus it still contains, on its arrival at the central plateau,\r\nenough moisture to produce the heavy precipitation just noted. [296]\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding these daily aguaceros, one can always count\r\non sunshiny mornings, except during October, which is the wettest\r\nmonth of the year. It scarcely ever rains before two o'clock P. M.,\r\nand rarely after five o'clock in the evening.\r\n\r\nWe were quite charmed with San José and its hospitable and cultured\r\npeople. In many respects we thought it the most delightful city we had\r\nseen in Latin America--especially for a protracted sojourn. Situated in\r\nthe smiling valley of the Abra, it is reputed to be the most beautiful\r\ncity in Central America, while it is the second in extent and the\r\nthird in population, having about thirty thousand souls. Its altitude\r\nis nearly four thousand and seven hundred feet above the level of the\r\nsea, and it has a mean annual temperature of 70° F. Foreign residents\r\ndeclare that the climate during the dry season is ideal.\r\n\r\nThe city counts a number of beautiful churches and public buildings,\r\nbut the greatest surprise for us was its superb Teatro Nacional. In\r\nsome of its leading features it is modeled after the Grand Opera\r\nHouse in Paris, and is really a gem of architecture. It cost nearly\r\n$1,000,000 in gold, and was paid for by an extra tax on coffee. We have\r\nnothing in the United States to compare with it in beauty and artistic\r\nfinish, especially in the decoration of its sumptuous foyer. In the\r\nNew World it is surpassed only by the Teatro Municipal of Rio de\r\nJaneiro and the Teatro Colon of Buenos Aires.\r\n\r\nThere are many attractive parks adorned with tastefully arranged\r\nflowers and trees and monuments that would be a credit to\r\nany capital. The monument that appealed most strongly to us was\r\nlocated in the Parque Nacional, and commemorates the campaign of\r\n1856 against the Filibusters led by that daring adventurer from the\r\nUnited States, William Walker. It is also dedicated to the fraternity\r\nof the five Central American republics made one in defense of their\r\nindependence. Let us hope that this is a symbol of the birth in the\r\nnear future of a new federation of the Central American republics,\r\nsimilar to the one that was established shortly after they had\r\nachieved their independence under the name of the Republic of Central\r\nAmerica. Such a republic would have fifty per cent more territory than\r\nthe whole of Great Britain, and, considering all the natural resources\r\nit possesses, it would, under a stable and progressive government,\r\nsoon take an honorable place among the nations of the world.\r\n\r\nWe visited a number of coffee plantations, as well as orchards and\r\ngardens, in the vicinity of San José, and were surprised at the\r\nvariety and luxuriance of every species of vegetable growth.\r\n\r\nBut it is to the city market that one must go--especially on Sundays\r\nand dies de fiesta--holidays--if one would have an adequate conception\r\nof the floral and pomonic riches of this favored land.\r\n\r\nHere we could easily imagine that we had before us every blossom that\r\nblows. Exposed for sale at a nominal price are the most gorgeous of\r\nflowers still fresh with the morning dew; roses of every size and\r\ncolor; orchids of the most fantastic forms and of dazzling beauty,\r\nto possess which a New York belle, would, if necessary, pawn a\r\nfavorite jewel.\r\n\r\nAnd here one beholds in lavish abundance citrous fruits of every\r\nspecies, bananas of untold varieties, and scores of other fruits\r\nequally common here but scarcely known except by name in our northern\r\nlatitudes. At every turn we see booths filled with guavas, mameys and\r\nmangoes; zapotes, avocados and chirimoyas; papayas, pomegranates and\r\nsapodillas; anonas, bread-fruit, mangosteens, and others too numerous\r\nto mention, that are prized by the natives for the preparation of\r\ndulces--sweets--and preserves.\r\n\r\nThe avocado, also called avocado pear, on account of its shape,\r\nis the fruit of the beautiful tree called by botanists Persea\r\ngratissima, after Perseus, the son of Jupiter and Danæ. The English\r\nin the Caribbean Islands name this delicious fruit alligator pear,\r\nor midshipman's butter. It, indeed, somewhat resembles butter in\r\nappearance, and, to a certain extent, replaces butter on the table\r\nin the tropics, where real butter is difficult to procure and more\r\ndifficult to keep. Of late years it has been introduced into the\r\nNorth as a salad, and promises, as soon as it becomes generally known,\r\nto be one of the most popular of tropical fruits.\r\n\r\nSpeaking for myself, I prefer it to any other, except possibly the\r\npiña--pineapple. But one must taste the fresh, ripe pineapple of the\r\ntropics to know its full lusciousness. It is incomparably more juicy\r\nand fragrant than anything our Northern markets offer. Old Benzoni\r\nsays of it, \"It smells well and tastes better,\" and declares it to be\r\n\"one of the most relishing fruits in the world.\" Sir Walter Raleigh\r\nwas right when he called it \"the prince of fruits.\" King James thought\r\nso highly of it that he remarked that \"it was a fruit too delicious\r\nfor a subject to taste of.\" The poet Thomson doubtless entertained\r\na similar view when he penned the following lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Witness, thou best Anana! thou the pride\r\n        Of vegetable life, beyond whate'er\r\n        The poets imagined in the golden age:\r\n        Quick let me strip thee of thy tufty coat,\r\n        Spread thy ambrosial stores and feast with Jove.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut delicious as is the pineapple it is, in the estimation of\r\nmany, surpassed by the chirimoya. This fruit is likened by Paez to\r\n\"lumps of flavored cream ready to be frozen, suspended from the\r\nbranches of some fairy tree amidst the most overpowering perfume\r\nof its flowers.\" Clements R. Markham was so enthusiastic about it\r\nthat he declared that \"He who has not tasted the chirimoya fruit\r\nhas yet to learn what fruit is.\" \"The pineapple, the mangosteen,\r\nand the chirimoya,\" Dr. Seeman writes, \"are considered the finest\r\nfruits in the world. I have tasted them in those localities in which\r\nthey are supposed to attain their highest perfection--the pineapple\r\nin Guayaquil, the mangosteen in the Indian Archipelago, and the\r\nchirimoya on the slope of the Andes, and if I were called upon to act\r\nthe part of Paris, I would, without hesitation, assign the apple to the\r\nchirimoya. Its taste, indeed, surpasses that of every other fruit, and\r\nHaenke was quite right when he called it the masterpiece of nature.\"\r\n\r\nA fruit that always appealed to us was the papaya, or pawpaw. It grows\r\nin clusters on a tree about twenty feet high. In taste and appearance\r\nit closely resembles a good-sized muskmelon. It is surprising to see\r\nsuch large fruits growing on so small a tree. It flowers and fruits\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\nThe fruits, however, that are the mainstay for the greatest number\r\nof people in the tropics, are, as has already been stated, the banana\r\nand the plantain. The former is known to botanists as Musa sapientum,\r\nbecause sages have reposed beneath its shade and eaten its fruit. The\r\nlatter is called Musa paradisiaca, on account of a certain tradition\r\nthat it was the forbidden fruit in Paradise. [297] Both the banana\r\nand the plantain number almost as many varieties as the apple. The\r\nbananas are smaller than the plantains. The former range from one\r\nto six inches in length, while some varieties of the latter attain a\r\nlength of fifteen inches. They are eaten raw, boiled and roasted and\r\nas preserves. A few trees will supply a whole family with the means\r\nof subsistence during the entire year.\r\n\r\nThe banana and plantain are just the kinds of plants that specially\r\nappeal to the natives of the equatorial regions, for they give at\r\nall seasons a never-failing abundance of nutritious food, and that,\r\ntoo, without any more labor and care than are entailed by clearing\r\nthe ground and placing them in the ever-productive soil. [298]\r\nSir Charles Dilke, however, regards these food producers in quite a\r\ndifferent light. In his estimation, the banana is the curse of the\r\ntropics. Their very abundance, and the little care they require,\r\nconstitute, according to him, a bar to progress and to civilization\r\nof the highest kind in the tropics, for the reason that all true\r\ncivilization necessarily presupposes labor and effort. It is for this\r\nreason that the highest faculties of man are most conspicuous in the\r\ntemperate zone, where there is a constant struggle for existence.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Barranquilla we met a gentleman who had just completed\r\na tour of all Latin America and he declared that San José was the\r\nmost beautiful city he had seen in all his travels.\r\n\r\nAt the time we gave little credence to what seemed a very exaggerated\r\nimpression, but after we were able to judge for ourselves, we were\r\nforced to admit that Costa Rica's fair capital is, indeed, a most\r\ndelightful place.\r\n\r\nIn a charming, secluded vale near the city, where stood the country\r\nseat of a wealthy merchant of the capital, was a particularly romantic\r\nspot. The only places I could recall that could fairly compare with it\r\nwere certain upland valleys in the larger islands of the equatorial\r\nPacific. Hidden away in the luxuriant tropical forest, alongside a\r\nbroad mountain torrent, where fruit and flower and foliage vied with\r\none another in delicacy of fragrance and richness of hue, it required\r\nbut little strain of fancy to imagine that we were gazing upon the\r\nwonders of the enchanted isle of Armida and Rinaldo; for here,\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Mild was the air, the skies were clear as glass,\r\n        The trees no whirlwind felt nor tempest's smart,\r\n        But ere the fruit drop off, the blossom comes;\r\n        This springs that falls, that ripeneth and thus blooms.\" [299]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst gazing in silent rapture at the incomparable beauty of the\r\nscene before us, and carried away by the matchless exhibitions\r\nof Flora and Pomona, we were suddenly transported on the wings of\r\nmemory back to the beautiful plaza of Ciudad Bolivar, where, some\r\nmonths before, we had heard a happy, enthusiastic fiancée declare\r\nthat she considered the lower Orinoco, aboard a yacht or a steamer,\r\nan ideal place to spend one's honeymoon. With no claim to the power\r\nof mind-reading, or to the spirit of prophecy, we assert, without\r\nfear of erring, that if she had the opportunity of choosing between\r\nthe Orinoco valley and this beauty spot near San José, as a place to\r\nspend her honeymoon--her luna de miel, as the Spaniards phrase it--it\r\nwould not be to the Orinoco that Don Esteban would take his bride,\r\nbut to this Edenic spot on the charming Costa Rican plateau.\r\n\r\nCosta Rica, despite what has often been said to the contrary, has, for\r\nthe past half century, been practically free from those fratricidal\r\nrevolutions that have so characterized the other Central American\r\nrepublics. There have, it is true, been occasional pronunciamientos\r\nand periods of excitement about the time of some of the presidential\r\nelections, but none of those devastating insurrections that have so\r\nlong been the curse of her less-fortunate neighbors.\r\n\r\nCosta Rica points with pride, and well she may, to the fact that she\r\nhas more school teachers than soldiers. Everywhere one finds schools\r\nfor both sexes, admirably appointed and conducted, and constant\r\nefforts are being made to have them compare favorably with similar\r\ninstitutions in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe original Spanish inhabitants of the central plateau were of\r\nsturdy Galician stock, and their descendants still exhibit the thrift,\r\nindustry and enterprise of their ancestors. One meets many families\r\nof pure Spanish blood, but the majority are evidently mestizos--the\r\nresult of the intermarriage of Spaniards with the aborigines. The\r\nnumber of pure-blooded Indians is comparatively small--only about three\r\nthousand out of a total population of a third of a million. There are\r\nfew negroes seen outside of the low coast lands, where they constitute\r\nthe majority of the inhabitants. We were, indeed, greatly impressed\r\nto note the sudden transition from the black to the white race as\r\nwe ascended the Cordillera. In San José the number of negroes is\r\nastonishingly small, while the complexions of the whites, compared\r\nwith that of the majority of the people living in the Andean lands\r\nwe had recently visited, is unusually clear and ruddy.\r\n\r\n\"How fair and delicate are the features of the Josefinas!\" [300]\r\nexclaimed C., as we took our first promenade in the broad and well-kept\r\nstreets of San José. And with the eye of a connoisseur, he continued,\r\n\"How tastefully dressed they are!\"\r\n\r\nHe was right. The number of beautiful, Madonna-like types one meets\r\nwith is surprising. This impression is probably enhanced in some\r\ndegree by the beautifully embroidered pañolones--large Chinese\r\nsilk shawls--which they know so well how to display to the best\r\nadvantage. When to the tasteful costume and delicate features one\r\nadds the culture and refinement that often distinguish the Josefina,\r\none can easily realize that she but continues the best traditions for\r\nbeauty and grace of mind and heart that have so long distinguished\r\nher sisters in the land of Isabella of Castile.\r\n\r\nAfter a delightful week spent in San José we prepared to return to\r\nLimon. We then experienced, probably more than at any other place in\r\nour long journey,--what all travelers more or less dread in their\r\nperegrinations--the pang of leaving places that have especially\r\nappealed to one and of saying farewell to newly-formed friends\r\nalmost as soon as one has learned to know their goodness of heart\r\nand nobility of character. To me, I confess, this has always been\r\nthe greatest drawback of traveling and is something I have never been\r\nable to outgrow.\r\n\r\nArmed with a certificate from our consul stating that we had spent\r\nin San José the time required of passengers coming from quarantined\r\nports, by the health regulations of Panama, we took our place in a\r\ncomfortable parlor car, and were soon on our way towards the Caribbean\r\ncoast, but not before we had taken \"a last, long, lingering look,\"\r\nat beautiful, hospitable, fascinating San José.\r\n\r\nAs the train slowly moved eastwards towards Cartago, our attention\r\nwas directed for the hundredth time to the rich cafetales--coffee\r\nplantations--that covered the fertile acres on both sides of the\r\nroad. Here and there we noted one of those cumbersome ox-carts\r\nwith solid wooden wheels drawn by a yoke of oxen in charge of an\r\nodd-looking boyero. These are rapidly giving way to more modern means\r\nof transportation, but the lover of the bizarre and the picturesque\r\nwill regret their disappearance.\r\n\r\n\"Observe,\" said a Josefino, having some pretensions to physiognomy,\r\n\"the peculiar features of that boyero on his way to the market. I will\r\nwager anything that that man is a firm believer in ceguas and cadejos\r\nand lloronas; that he dreams of botijas, even in the daytime, and that\r\nhe has greater fear of hermanos than any of your countrymen have of\r\nghosts.\" He then proceeded to explain the meaning of these terms.\r\n\r\n\"A cegua,\" he continued, \"is a monster somewhat like the sirens\r\nof old, that assumes the form of a beautiful woman and leads men\r\nastray. A cadejos is a fantastic animal, black and hairy, resembling\r\nan enormous dog which has resounding hoofs instead of paws. A llorona\r\nis a frightful phantom that is sometimes heard moaning in the mountains\r\nin such wise as to strike terror into the passer-by. [301] Botija--the\r\nSpanish for a large earthen jar--is the name given in Costa Rica to\r\na buried treasure. The country people believe that, if one having\r\nburied money dies in debt, his ghost--hermano--will haunt the place\r\nin great distress until the treasure is found and the debt is paid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could have the assistance of a few such hermanos,\" interposed\r\nC. laughingly. \"If I had, I should have several thousand dollars more\r\nto my credit than I have now. Unfortunately, in my country we have\r\nnot such aids in bringing our debtors to book.\"\r\n\r\nOn our way down the Cordillera, while crossing one of the numerous\r\niron bridges that span the Reventazon and other mountain rivers and\r\ntorrents, our Josefino friend pointed to a pier of masonry standing\r\nalone about forty feet to one side of the bridge. \"That pier,\"\r\nhe said, \"was formerly under the bridge, but in consequence of a\r\npeculiar landslide or earthquake, it was transported, together with\r\na part of the bed of the stream, to the spot where it now stands.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then he told us of the opposition of the boyeros to the\r\nconstruction of the railroad. They, like ill-advised people in other\r\nparts of the world, feared that it would ruin their occupation and\r\nreduce them and their families to starvation. The government and\r\nrailway company cleverly overcame this opposition by employing the\r\nboyeros to haul the material used in the construction of the road.\r\n\r\nThen, too, there were wiseacres in Costa Rica, as there were in our\r\nRocky Mountain region when there was question of undertaking some\r\nof the remarkable engineering feats that characterize several of our\r\ntranscontinental railroads, who declared that the projectors of the\r\nroad from Limon to San José were essaying the impossible. \"General\r\nGuardia\"--the dictator under whose rule the road was begun--they\r\ndeclared \"is trying to build a railroad to Port Limon, where the\r\nbirds themselves can scarcely go with wings.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, aside from the landslides which occur in all mountainous\r\ncountries, and the miasmatic climate, there were but few great\r\ndifficulties encountered. From an engineering standpoint the\r\nconstruction of the road offered far less difficult problems than\r\nmany of the railroads in Colorado, Peru and Ecuador. The curves are\r\nnot so sharp and the grades are less, while the altitude attained is\r\nless than half of that reached by several Rocky Mountain roads and\r\nless than one-third of the height of the celebrated Andean railway\r\nwhich connects Oroya with Lima.\r\n\r\nOur first care on arriving at Limon was to have the health officer\r\nof that place countersign the certificate we had received from our\r\nconsul in San José. We then boarded our steamer and were ready to\r\nstart for Panama.\r\n\r\nThe weather was again in our favor, and we had a most delightful sail\r\nto Colon, and needless to say, we enjoyed every moment of it. We\r\nenjoyed it particularly on account of its interesting historical\r\nassociations, and the romantic legends that have been woven about\r\nevery isle and inlet and headland along the coast.\r\n\r\nThat, however, which appealed most strongly to us was the land of\r\nVeragua, near the dividing line between Costa Rica and Panama. It\r\nwas here that Columbus imagined he had found the Golden Chersonese,\r\nthe land whence came the gold used in the construction of Solomon's\r\ntemple. In the letter to his sovereigns, dispatched from Jamaica,\r\nhe contends \"that these mines of the Aurea are identical with those\r\nof Veragua.\" [302]\r\n\r\nIt was here, too, near the mouth of the river Belen, that the first\r\nsettlement on the continent of the New World was located. Although\r\nit had soon to be abandoned, it was begun with a view of permanent\r\noccupancy, and as such is deserving of special notice. A suitable\r\nmemorial should indicate this spot, as one should also mark the site\r\nof Isabella, the first settlement in the New World.\r\n\r\nIt was while on the coast of Veragua that Columbus heard of the\r\ngreat ocean now known as the Pacific. [303] He was not, however,\r\npermitted to add its discovery to the long list of his marvelous\r\nachievements. That honor was reserved for Vasco Nuñez de Balboa.\r\n\r\nAbout nine o'clock the morning following our departure from Limon we\r\ndropped anchor in the harbor of Colon. The sea was so tranquil that\r\nthere was scarcely a ripple on its placid waters. It was certainly\r\nin marked contrast with the condition in which Columbus once found\r\nit in these parts; for he assures us, in the oft-quoted letter to\r\nFerdinand and Isabella, that \"never was sea so high, so terrific,\r\nand so covered with foam.\" It seemed like a \"sea of blood, seething\r\nlike a cauldron on a mighty fire.\" So continual, indeed, were the\r\nshifting winds, and so terrific were the storms, that the coast from\r\nVeragua to Colon which we had found washed by so calm a sea was by\r\nColumbus and his companions named La Costa de los Contrastes.\r\n\r\nImmediately on our arrival our vessel was boarded by the health\r\nofficers of the port. Those who could not produce a satisfactory\r\nhealth certificate--and many could not--were sent to quarantine. Many\r\nof our party, however, did not require any, as they did not purpose\r\nlanding at Colon. Some of them were bound for Jamaica and for points\r\nmore distant. Among them was C., my brave and resolute companion\r\nacross the Andes, the loyal and generous young cavalier who, if\r\nhe had not been of superior mold, would more than once have lost\r\nhis heart during the course of our long journey. I would fain have\r\nenjoyed his companionship longer while following the conquistadores\r\nin lands farther south; but it was not to be. To him, and to other\r\nfriends, I had regretfully to pronounce the words of parting that\r\nhad so frequently been addressed to us by the kindly and hospitable\r\npeople we had met all along our route--Que Uds. vayan bien, y con la\r\nVirgen!--A happy journey and with the Virgin Mother!\r\n\r\nAs I left our good ship and the friends it bore to divers destinations\r\nand stepped ashore alone, a stranger in a strange land, I felt, I must\r\nconfess, not unlike Dante when he suddenly found himself deprived of\r\nthe companionship of Virgil, who had been his friend and guide during\r\nhis arduous journey down through the fearsome pits of Hell and up the\r\nprecipitous ledges of the mountain of Purgatory. But this impression,\r\nstrong though it was, could not long remain dominant. What had in\r\nthe beginning of my journey been but \"a consummation devoutly to be\r\nwished,\" had during our wanderings in tropical lands crystallized into\r\na determination to make the desire a reality. The happy termination\r\nof our voyage up the Orinoco and down the Magdalena was conclusive\r\nevidence that travel, even through the least frequented parts of\r\nSouth America, was far from being as difficult as it has long been\r\ndepicted. The moment, then, that I stepped from the gang plank that\r\nconnected our steamer with Panaman soil, the Rubicon was crossed, and\r\nI had resolved, coûte que coûte,--alone, if necessary,--to realize\r\nthe long-cherished dream of my youth,--to visit the famed lands of\r\nthe Incas and explore the fertile valleys under the equator. If my\r\nexperience in the llanos and among the Cordilleras had not made\r\nme \"fit to mount up to the stars,\" as Dante was when he left the\r\nTerrestrial Paradise, it had at least renewed me \"even as new trees\r\nwith new foliage,\" and I was ready to undertake a longer and more\r\ndifficult journey than the one just completed and eager to follow\r\nthe conquistadores along the Andes and down the Amazon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nPARTIAL LIST OF THE WORKS CITED IN THIS VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcosta, Padre José de.

I\r\nhave labored in the court of the Kings of Castile, going and coming\r\nfrom the Indies to Castile and from Castile to the Indies many times\r\nfor about fifty years--i. e., from the year 1540, for the love of God\r\nalone and through compassion seeing those great multitudes of rational\r\nmen perish, who originally were approachable, humble, meek and simple,\r\nand well fitted to receive the Catholic faith and practice all manner\r\nof Christian virtues.\" Fabié, op. cit., Tom.

The same writer informs us that the sailors\r\nof Pedro Alonzo Niño, on leaving Curiana to return to Spain, \"had\r\nthree score and XVI poundes weight (after VIII vnces to the pownde)\r\nof perles, which they bought for exchange of owre thynges, amountinge\r\nto the value of fyve shyllinges.\"\r\n\r\n[46] Of these gems of the ocean, \"tears by Naiads wept,\" one could then\r\nrepeat, as well as now, the words of Pliny, \"The richest merchandise\r\nof all, and the most soveraigne comoditie throughout the whole world,\r\nare these perles.\"--Naturalis Historia, Lib.

It is slightly larger\r\nthan the Ceylonese gem, and is occasionally of excellent quality.\r\n\r\nAbout three hundred and fifty boats, each manned by five or six men,\r\nare now engaged in the pearl fishery of Venezuela. Most of them are\r\nfrom the ports of Cumana, Juan Griego and Carupano.\r\n\r\nThe reader who is interested in the pearls of Margarita and of the\r\nPearl Coast, may consult with profit the very elaborate work, The\r\nBook of the Pearl, by George F.

This heat lasted eight days;\r\non the first day the weather was fine, but on the seven other days it\r\nrained and was cloudy, yet we found no alleviation of our distress;\r\nso that I certainly believe that if the sun had shone, as on the first\r\nday, we should not have been able to escape in anyway.\"--Writings of\r\nChristopher Columbus, ut sup., pp. 113, 114, and Irving's Life and\r\nVoyages of Christopher Columbus, Chap.

Writing to his friend, Lorenzo de Medici, giving him an\r\naccount of his second voyage, he declares \"In the fields flourish so\r\nmany sweet flowers and herbs, and the fruits are so delicious in their\r\nfragrance, that I fancied myself near the terrestrial paradise,\" and\r\nagain, \"If there is a terrestrial paradise in the world it cannot be\r\nfar from this region.\"--The Life and Voyages of Americus Vespucius,\r\npp. 197 and 214, by C. Edwards Lester and Andrew Foster, New York,\r\n1846.\r\n\r\n[60] The curious reader will be interested in learning that Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh, as well as Columbus and Vespucius, speculated about\r\nthe probable site of Paradise. In his History of the World he devotes\r\na long chapter to the subject, and several pages to the discussion\r\n\"Of their Opinion which make paradise as high as the moon; and of\r\nothers which make it higher than the middle region of the air,\"\r\nChap.

Commenting on\r\nRaleigh's opinion, just quoted, he writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"During our eight years' wandering among the tribes of Guiana,\r\nwho inhabit the vast regions from the coast of the Atlantic to the\r\ninterior, between the Cassiquiare and the upper Trombetas, we have met\r\nwith many an Indian female who in figure and comeliness might have\r\nvied with some of our European beauties. Although they are rather\r\nsmall in size, their feet and hands are generally exquisite, their\r\nankles well turned, and their waists, left to nature and not forced\r\ninto artificial shape by modern inventions, resemble the beau ideal\r\nof classical sculpture.\"--The Discoverie of Guiana, ut sup., p. 41.\r\n\r\n[65] The reader, I am sure, will be interested in the following\r\nparagraph from Peter Martyr on the plantain.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the fruit of the Cassia tree (as he calls the plantain),\r\nhe, in Michael Lok's translation, says,--\r\n\r\n\"The Egyptian common people babble that this is the apple of our first\r\ncreated Father Adam, whereby hee ouerthrewe all mankinde. The straunge\r\nand farraine Marchantes of vnprofitable Spices, perfumes, Arabian\r\nYseminating odours, and woorthlesse precious stones trading those\r\nCountries for gaine, call those fruites the Muses.

It is also named El Traga\r\nVenado--Deer Swallower--while in British Guiana it is known as the\r\nCamoudi. Mr. Waterton, speaking of it, says, \"The Camoudi snake has\r\nbeen killed from thirty to forty feet long; though not venomous, his\r\nsize renders him destructive to the passing animals. The Spaniards in\r\nthe Oroonoque positively affirm that he grows to the length of seventy\r\nor eighty feet, and that he will destroy the strongest and largest\r\nbull. His name seems to confirm this; there he is called 'matatoro,'\r\nwhich literally means 'bull-killer.' Thus be may be ranked among\r\nthe deadly snakes; for it comes nearly to the same thing in the end,\r\nwhether the victim dies by poison from the fangs, which corrupts his\r\nblood, and makes it stink horribly, or whether his body be crushed\r\nto mummy, and swallowed by this hideous beast.\"--Wanderings in South\r\nAmerica, First Journey.\r\n\r\n[67] Neue Reisen, p. 698, Berlin.

These\r\nare the habitations of the Guarons (Titivitas and Waraweties of\r\nRaleigh), which are suspended from the trunks of trees. These tribes\r\nhang up mats in the air, which they fill with earth, and kindle,\r\non a layer of moist clay, the fire necessary for their household\r\nwants. They had owed their liberty and their political independence\r\nfor ages to the quaking and swampy soil, which they pass over in\r\nthe time of drought, and on which they alone know how to walk in\r\nsecurity to their solitude in the delta of the Orinoco; to their\r\nabode on the trees, where religious enthusiasm will probably never\r\nlead any American stylites.

They were what are now known as crocodiles and\r\ncaymans, the former of which, according to Schomburgk, are seldom more\r\nthan six to eight feet long, while the latter are said sometimes to\r\nattain a length of twenty-five feet. We saw several of them every day\r\nbut their number was far from being as great as is usually represented.\r\n\r\nOf the armadillo, which is prized as a delicacy in Guiana, Raleigh says\r\n\"it seemeth to be barred ouer with small plates like to a Renocero with\r\na white horne growing in his hinder parts, as big as a great hunting\r\nhorne which they vse to winde in steed of a trumpet.\" Op. cit., p. 74.\r\n\r\n[84] According to Sr. F. Michelenena y Rojas, Exploracion Oficial,\r\np. 54, the palm for physical superiority and intelligence is to be\r\nawarded to the Caribs. He says the Carib race is without doubt ... the\r\nmost beautiful, the most robust and the most intelligent of all those\r\nin Venezuela. Not only this; he seems inclined to consider them the\r\nsuperiors of all the Indians in South America. Vespucci speaks, too,\r\nof them as \"magnae sapientiae viri\"--men of superior intelligence--as\r\nwell as men of superior strength and valor.\r\n\r\n[85] Raleigh gives the following graphic description of the wife of\r\nan Indian chief whom he met during his voyage to this region:--\r\n\r\n\"In all my life I haue seldome seene a better fauored woman: She\r\nwas of good stature, with blacke eies, fat of body, of an excellent\r\ncountenance, hir haire almost as long as hir selfe, tied vp againe in\r\npretie knots, and it seemed she stood not in that aw of hir husband, as\r\nthe rest, for she spake and discourst, and dranke among the gentlemen\r\nand captaines, and was very pleasant, knowing hir owne comelines,\r\nand taking great pride therein. I haue seene a Lady in England so\r\nlike hir, as but for the difference of colour I would haue sworne\r\nmight haue beene the same.\" Op. cit., p. 66.\r\n\r\n[86] Peter Martyr says of them:--\"Edaces humanarum carnium novi\r\nhelluones anthropophagi, Caribes alias Canibales appellati.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all that has been said on the subject since the\r\ndiscovery of America, it is still a moot question with many serious\r\ninvestigators whether the Caribs of Tierra Firme were ever cannibals,\r\nas is so generally believed. That the Caribs of certain of the West\r\nIndian islands were addicted to anthropophagy there can, it seems,\r\nbe little doubt. The concurrent testimony of the earlier writers,\r\nincluding Peter Martyr and Cardinal Bembo and others, have apparently\r\nplaced the matter beyond controversy. It was the cruelties and\r\nanthropophagous habits of the Caribs, as reported to Spain, that\r\nprovoked the law which was promulgated in 1504 in virtue of which every\r\nIndian, who could be proved to be of Carib origin, might be enslaved\r\nby the Spaniards. This law, however, although designed by its framers\r\nto eliminate a practice that was a disgrace to humanity, opened the\r\ndoor to evils almost as great--if not greater in some instances--as\r\nthose it was expected to suppress. Selfish, soulless colonists had but\r\nto circulate the report that certain Indians, whom they coveted for\r\nslaves, were cannibals, in order to justify themselves before the law\r\nfor tearing them from their homes and keeping them in servitude. Thus\r\nit happened that, shortly after the promulgation of the law aforesaid,\r\nthe Caribs of the Mainland, as well as those of the West Indies,\r\nwere classed as cannibals. They were accordingly hunted like wild\r\nbeasts, and countless thousands of them--the same innocent, gentle,\r\ninoffensive creatures that so strongly appealed to Columbus--were sold\r\ninto slavery and met with a cruel death in the mines of Española. So\r\nsuccessful were the atrocious slave-dealers of the time in fixing the\r\nstigma of cannibal on the Indians of the Mainland that Herrera felt\r\nauthorized to declare that there was in every pueblo of Venezuela a\r\nslaughter house in which human flesh could be obtained--en cada Pueblo\r\nhavia Caneceria publica de carne humana (Dec. VIII, Lib. II, Cap. XIX).\r\n\r\nDirect and specific as is this charge, it is quite safe to assert\r\nthat it is utterly devoid of foundation in fact. The most charitable\r\nconstruction we can put on Herrera's statements is that he was misled\r\nby the false reports of those whose interest it was to have it believed\r\nthat the Caribs of Venezuela, as well as those of the West Indies,\r\nindulged in the horrid practice of devouring their enemies. Humboldt\r\nwas among the first to raise his voice in defense of the Indians of the\r\nMainland and to assert that it was only the Caribs of the West Indies\r\nthat had \"rendered the names cannibals, Caribbees and anthropophagi,\r\nsynonymous.\" (Personal Narrative, Vol. II, p. 414.)\r\n\r\nA recent Venezuelan writer, Tavera-Acosta, declares that it is \"an\r\nincontrovertible fact that so far the anthropophagy of which they\r\nhave been accused by their ferocious and ignorant executioners has\r\nnever been proved\" against the Caribs. Their sole crime was that\r\nthey took arms against their ruthless invaders in defense of their\r\nhomes, and relying on their numbers and conscious superiority over\r\nother tribes endeavored by all possible means to preserve their\r\nindependence. (Anales de Guayana, p. 320, Ciudad Bolivar, 1905.)\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the Indians, during the period\r\nof the conquest and subsequently, were the victims of gross\r\nmisrepresentations and had in consequence to endure untold hardships\r\nand miseries. Not content with denouncing them as cannibals, their\r\nrelentless persecutors--Dutch, Germans, English, French and Portuguese,\r\nas well as Spaniards--insisted on regarding them as mere animals--like\r\na species of chimpanzee or orang-outang--that had no souls and no\r\nrights any one was bound to respect. It required the bull--Sublimis\r\nDeus--of Pope Paul III to define the status of the hapless Indians,\r\nto make it clear that they are not \"dumb brutes created for our\r\nservice,\" but that they \"are truly men\"; that \"they are by no means\r\nto be deprived of their liberty or the possession of their property\";\r\nthat they are not \"to be in any way enslaved\"; and that \"should the\r\ncontrary happen, it shall be null and of no effect.\"\r\n\r\nWhat has been said of the cannibalism of the South American\r\nIndian in times past may with even greater truth be iterated of it\r\nto-day. In spite of what has been written to the contrary, even by so\r\ndistinguished an explorer as Rafael Reyes--ex-president of Colombia--it\r\nmay well be doubted if there is a single tribe in South America that\r\ncan justly be accused of cannibalism. Some of them, owing to their\r\nmiserable social condition, or because they have for generations\r\npast been the victims of the injustice and cruelty of the whites,\r\nmay be ferocious and vindictive, but, that even the worst of them are\r\ncannibals, is yet to be proved.

Here truly, in the language of Pliny, flowers are the joy\r\nof trees, and they vie with one another in the brilliance of their\r\ncolors, and in the exuberance of their growth.\r\n\r\n[95] Sr. Pérez Triana, the son of a former president of Colombia,\r\nwas in 1893 obliged to flee from his country, and as the seaports\r\nwere watched he and his companions were forced to escape by way of the\r\nMeta and the Orinoco. He tells us in his charming book, De Bogotá al\r\nAtlantico, p. 3, of the dread inspired by the thought of \"lo incierto\r\ndel viaje, que emprendiamos hacia regiones desconocidas, acaso nunca\r\nholladas par la planta del hombre civilizado,\" \"the uncertainty of\r\nthe journey we were undertaking to unknown regions, probably never\r\ntrod by the foot of civilized man.\"--Segunda Edición, Madrid, 1905.\r\n\r\nMr. Cunninghame Graham, in his introduction to this book, remarks\r\nthat \"The voyage in itself was memorable because, since the first\r\nconquerors went down the river with the faith that in their case,\r\nif rightly used, might have smoothed out all the mountain ranges in\r\nthe world, no one, except a stray adventurer, or india-rubber trader,\r\nhas followed in their footsteps,\" p. 13, English edition, London, 1902.\r\n\r\nAnother Colombian, Sr. Modesto Garces, had made the same journey eight\r\nyears before, a record of which he has given us in his little work,\r\nUn viaje á Venezuela, Bogotá, 1890. But neither he nor Sir Pérez\r\nTriana saw the lower Meta, for they left this river a short distance\r\nabove Orocué, and voyaged to the Orinoco by way of the Vichada.\r\n\r\nThree years subsequently to Pérez Triana's trip the same journey,\r\nwith slight modifications, was made by a German naturalist,\r\nDr. Otto Bürger. He has given us a record of it in his Reisen eines\r\nNaturforschers im Tropischen America, Leipzig, 1900.\r\n\r\nSo far as I am aware, no writer has made the journey up the river\r\nfrom Ciudad Bolivar to Bogotá. In a certain limited sense it was,\r\ntherefore, probably true that we were the first to undertake the\r\njourney described in the following pages.\r\n\r\n[96] The plaga, as understood by the natives, has special reference to\r\nthe insects known to them as mosquitoes, zancudos and jejenes. What\r\nthey call mosquitoes we call gnats. The zancudo is our mosquito. The\r\njejen is a small fly whose bite is quite as painful as that of the\r\nzancudo. Sometimes the term zancudo is applied to all these pests\r\nindiscriminately.\r\n\r\nBesides these insects, that are often the cause of much suffering to\r\nthe traveler in low woodlands, there are others that are sometimes\r\nincluded under the general designation of the plaga. These are\r\na very small red insect known as the coloradito, and the nigua,\r\nor jigger--pulex penetrans--which, on account of the misery they\r\noccasion, are often more dreaded than serpents or the wild beasts of\r\nthe forest. They usually bury themselves under the toe nails, where\r\nthey lay their eggs. If not immediately removed they cause painful and\r\noften dangerous sores. It is related of Sir Robert Schomburgk that\r\na negress once extracted from his feet no fewer than eighty-three\r\njiggers at one sitting.\r\n\r\nThe coloradito, called by the French bête-rouge, and in some places\r\nknown as the red tick, is almost invisible to the naked eye. It is\r\nfound everywhere in the equatorial lowlands, especially during the\r\nrainy season. Its bite causes an intolerable itching, and when one\r\nhas been exposed to the combined attacks of many of these microscopic\r\ninsects, the result is as painful as the burning produced by the\r\npoisoned tunic of Nessus. Schomburgk, in describing his personal\r\nexperience, declares that \"the bite of this insect drives by day\r\nthe perspiration of anguish from every pore, and at night makes\r\none's hammock resemble the gridiron on which St. Lawrence was\r\nroasted.\" Simson informs us that the intense irritation produced by\r\nthe bites of the bête-rouge at times drove him almost to the verge of\r\nmadness. \"Notwithstanding every effort of self-control,\" he writes,\r\n\"to bear the itching sensation, I have many times awoke in the\r\nnight to find myself sitting up in the bed, and literally tearing\r\nthe skin off my legs, where most of the insects collect, with my\r\nnails.\" Mosquitoes and the zancudos are bad enough, but, as a pest,\r\nthe coloradito is far worse. Truth to tell, our greatest suffering\r\nin the tropics came from the coloradito, but it was in great measure\r\ndue to our lack of precaution. Had we exercised more care we should\r\nhave avoided many painful hours. The best way to allay the pain is\r\nto rub the part affected with rum or lemon juice.\r\n\r\nPadre Gumilla assures us that leaving the Gulf of Paria and\r\nentering the Orinoco, or any of the tropical rivers, is tantamount\r\nto engaging in a fierce and continued warfare, day and night, with\r\ncountless insects of all kinds. Of certain mosquitoes, he tells us,\r\ntheir sharp, uninterrupted noise is more to be dreaded than their\r\npiercing proboscis.\r\n\r\nSo trying and difficult did Raleigh consider a voyage up the Orinoco\r\nthat he declared it a task \"fitter for boies,\" than for men of mature\r\nyears, although, when he visited Guiana, he was nearly three lustra\r\nyounger than was the author of the present work when he made the\r\njourney herein described.\r\n\r\n[97] Journal of an Expedition 1400 miles up the Orinoco and 300 up\r\nthe Arauca, pp. 62 and 66, London, 1822.\r\n\r\n[98] Adventures Amidst the Equatorial Forests and Rivers of South\r\nAmerica, p. 63, by Villiers Stuart, London, 1891.\r\n\r\nAccepting as true these and similar exaggerated statements made by\r\ntravelers from the time of Gumilla to our own regarding the insect\r\npests of tropical America, the reader will no doubt be inclined to\r\nagree with Sydney Smith that it is better for one to become reconciled\r\nto the trials of our northern climate than to expose oneself to\r\nthe still greater trials in the lands bordering the equator. In\r\na characteristic article in the Edinburgh Review on Waterton's\r\nWanderings, the genial humorist has the following paragraph:--\r\n\r\n\"Insects are the curse of tropical climates. The bête-rouge lays the\r\nfoundation of a tremendous ulcer. In a moment you are covered with\r\nticks. Chigoes bury themselves in your flesh, and hatch a large colony\r\nof young chigoes in a few hours. They will not live together, but every\r\nchigoe sets up a separate ulcer, and has his own private portion of\r\npus. Flies get entry into your mouth, into your eyes, into your nose;\r\nyou eat flies, drink flies, and breathe flies. Lizards, cockroaches,\r\nand snakes, get into the bed; ants eat up the books; scorpions sting\r\nyou on the foot. Everything bites, stings, or bruises; every second\r\nof your existence you are wounded by some piece of animal life that\r\nnobody has ever seen before, except Swammerdam and Meriam. An insect\r\nwith eleven legs is swimming in your teacup, a nondescript with nine\r\nwings is struggling in the small beer, or a caterpillar with several\r\ndozen eyes in his belly is hastening over your bread and butter! All\r\nnature is alive, and seems to be gathering all her entomological hosts\r\nto eat you up, as you are standing, out of your coat, waistcoat, and\r\nbreeches. Such are the tropics. All this reconciles us to our dews,\r\nfogs, vapours, and drizzle--to our apothecaries rushing about with\r\ngargles and tinctures--to our old, British, constitutional coughs,\r\nsore throats, and swelled faces.\"\r\n\r\n[99] \"In a region,\" says Humboldt, \"where travelling is so uncommon,\r\npeople seem to feel a pleasure in exaggerating to strangers the\r\ndifficulties arising from the climate, the wild animals and the\r\nIndians.\" Op. cit., Vol. I, p. 361.\r\n\r\n[100]  \"More bold a man is, he prevails the more,\r\n        Though man nor place he ever saw before.\"\r\n\r\n                        --The Odyssey, Book VII, vv. 50, 51.\r\n\r\n[101] Op. cit., p. 87.\r\n\r\n[102] Voyages dans l'Amérique du Sud, p. 578, Paris, 1883.\r\n\r\nMajor Stanley Patterson, writing in the Royal Geographical Journal,\r\nVol. XIII, No. 1, p. 40, 1899, of the Venezuelans living on the\r\nOrinoco, declares that \"All are avaricious, thriftless, independent,\r\nfaithless, untruthful, lazy, capable of hard work, quick-tempered,\r\nvindictive, changeful and full of laughter. If there are clouds\r\nthese children of the sun see them not; nothing is really serious to\r\nthem.\" Certain of his adjectives may apply to some of the inhabitants\r\nbut they surely cannot truthfully be applied to all of them. We found\r\nmany good people among them and retain the pleasantest recollections\r\nof their kindness and hospitality.\r\n\r\n[103] As to the flora of the forests of Venezuelan Guiana one can\r\ntruthfully say what Richard Schomburgk affirms of the flora of British\r\nGuiana. In his Reisen in British Guiana, Vol. II, p. 216, speaking\r\nof the plants in the country around Roraima, he writes as follows:\r\n\"Not only the orchids, but the shrubs and low trees were unknown to\r\nme. Every shrub, herb and tree was new to me, if not as to the family,\r\nyet as to the species. I stood on the border of an unknown plant-zone,\r\nfull of wondrous forms which lay as if by magic before me.... Every\r\nstep revealed something new.\"\r\n\r\nAs an evidence of the variety of plant life in this part of the world,\r\nit suffices to state that Bonpland, the companion of Humboldt in\r\nhis memorable journey to South America, discovered no fewer than\r\nsix hundred species of new plants on his way to the Cassiquiare,\r\nand that, too, in spite of the fact that his investigations were\r\nnecessarily confined entirely to the banks of the river along which\r\nhe passed. There are still many large tracts in Venezuela and Colombia\r\nthat have never been visited by the botanist.\r\n\r\n[104] S.

The number of cattle dispersed throughout the\r\nlength and breadth of this wide extent of prairie land was computed\r\nto be about a hundred thousand head, and at one time, ten thousand\r\nhorses; but what with the peste, revolutionary exactions, and skin\r\nhunters, comparatively very few of the former and none of the latter\r\nhave been left.\" Pp. 202, 203, New York, 1864.\r\n\r\n[107]  \"My wife and my valued horse\r\n          Died both at the same time.\r\n        To the devil with my wife,\r\n          For my horse do I repine.\"\r\n\r\n[108] \"With my lance and horse, I care not for fortune, and it matters\r\nnot whether the sun shines or the moon gives light.\"\r\n\r\n[109] For valuable information regarding the llanos and their\r\ninhabitants, the Llaneros, the reader may consult, besides Páez,\r\nalready quoted, Aus den Llanos, von Carl Sachs, Leipzig, 1879, and\r\nVom Tropischen Tieflande zum Ewigen Schnee, von Anton Goering, Leipzig.\r\n\r\n[110] Uncle, a name by which Páez was frequently addressed by the\r\nLlaneros.\r\n\r\n[111] Recollections of a Service of Three Years during the War of\r\nExtermination in the Republics of Venezuela and Colombia, pp. 176,\r\n178, London, 1728.\r\n\r\n[112] El Orinoco Ilustrado, Cap.

The constitution of Venezuela is modeled after\r\nthat of the United States, and the laws are largely based on the best\r\nlegislation of other countries. But this is not sufficient. Of this\r\nunhappy country, and especially of its rulers, one may exclaim in\r\nthe words of the great Florentine poet:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                              \"Laws indeed there are,\r\n        But who is he observes them? None.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring our wanderings through this country, which Nature has so highly\r\nfavored, we often thought that the interests of the people and of\r\nhumanity would be subserved by adopting a method of government that,\r\nfor a while, was deemed necessary in Florence. To quell sedition\r\nand dissension and break up the factions that had so long made law\r\nand order impossible, rulers were brought in from outside--men who\r\nhad no affiliations with either the Bianchi or the Neri, Guelphs or\r\nGhibellines, and who could, therefore, be counted upon to execute\r\nthe laws with strict impartiality, regardless of family or party.\r\n\r\nUnless those responsible for the government of the country shall soon\r\ngive evidence of being able to guarantee peace and tranquillity and\r\ngive the people an opportunity of developing the resources of the\r\ncountry--something in which the whole civilized world is becoming\r\ndaily more interested--the time may come when the great powers will\r\nfind it necessary, in the interests of international expediency,\r\nto appoint some one who may be counted upon to keep the peace, and\r\nfoster the commercial and social development that is so greatly needed\r\nand is so essential to national progress and prosperity.\r\n\r\n[117] Juan de Castellanos, Varones Ilustres de Indias, Primera Parte,\r\nElegia, XI, Canto II.\r\n\r\n[118] Castellanos was for a while a soldier and afterwards\r\nan ecclesiastic, enjoying a benefice in the town of Tunja, New\r\nGranada. Like Pope, he had an extraordinary faculty for versification,\r\nand, like him, \"He spoke in numbers for the numbers came.\" This\r\ndoes not, however, detract from his authority as a historian. Having\r\ntaken an active part in many of the campaigns, which he describes,\r\nand, knowing intimately many of the earlier conquerors of that vast\r\nterritory now known as the Republic of Colombia, few writers were\r\nbetter qualified than he to record the events so graphically depicted\r\nin his Elegias, or to portray the characters of those conquistadores\r\nwho figure so prominently among his Varones Ilustres de Indias. The\r\nfirst part of his work was published in 1589. The second and third\r\nparts were published in 1850 by Rivadeneyra in the Biblioteca de\r\nAutores Españoles. The fourth part, discovered only a few years\r\nago, was issued by D. Antonio Paz y Melia in 1887 under the title of\r\nHistoria del Nuevo Reino de Granada. In his introduction to this work,\r\nSr. Melia gives an able résumé of all that is known or conjectured\r\nregarding Castellanos.

Both were continually called upon to act as causarum\r\nexaminatores--arbitrators--and to settle difficulties that were ever\r\narising among the flocks entrusted to their care. St. Augustine, the\r\ngreat bishop of Hippo, refers frequently to \"the burdensome character\r\nof this kind of work, and the distraction from higher activities which\r\nit involved\"--\"Quantum attinet ad meum commodum,\" he writes in his\r\nDe Opere Monachorum, XXIX, 37, \"multo mallem per singulos dies certis\r\nhoris, quantum in bene moderatis monasteriis constitutum est, aliquid\r\nmanibus operari, et ceteras horas habere ad legendum et orandum, aut\r\naliquid de divinis litteris agendum liberas, quam tumultuosissimas\r\nperplexitates caussarum alienarum pati de negotiis secularibus vel\r\njudicando dirimendis vel interveniendo præcidendis.\"\r\n\r\n[125] Every reader is familiar with the story that has long been in\r\ncirculation regarding monkey bridges, and, in his youth, was, no doubt,\r\nentertained by pictures of such imaginary bridges. It is quite safe to\r\nsay that no one ever saw such bridges in any part of South America or\r\nelsewhere. And yet the tale regarding their existence has had currency\r\nsince the time of Acosta, who visited the New World in 1570. \"Going\r\nfrom Nombre de Dios to Panamá,\" he writes, \"I did see in Capira one\r\nof these monkies leape from one tree to an other, which was on the\r\nother side of a river, making me much to wonder. They leape where they\r\nlist, winding their tailes about a braunch to shake it; and when they\r\nwill leape further than they can at once, they use a pretty devise,\r\ntying themselves by the tailes one of another, and by this means make\r\nas it were a chaine of many; then doe they launch themselves foorth,\r\nand the first holpen by the force of the rest takes holde where hee\r\nlist, and so hangs to a bough and helps all the rest, till they be\r\ngotten up.\" Historia Natural y Moral de las Indias, Bk. IV, Chap. 39,\r\nGrimston's Translation, London, 1604.\r\n\r\nThe fable about the monkey bridge belongs to the same class as\r\nthose that obtain in certain parts of South America regarding the\r\n\"great devil,\" or \"man of the woods,\" a near relative of Waterton's\r\n\"Nondescript.\"\r\n\r\nKingsley, in the following passage from Westward Ho!, referring to some\r\nof the things seen and heard by Amyas Leigh and his companions during\r\ntheir voyage up the Meta, paints a picture that is doubtless before\r\nthe mind's eye of most people when they think of the forest-fringed\r\nbanks of this river, but which is about as far from the reality as\r\ncould well be imagined. \"The long processions of monkeys,\" he writes,\r\n\"who kept pace with them along the tree tops and proclaimed their\r\nwonder in every imaginable whistle, and grunt and howl, had ceased\r\nto move their laughter, as much as the roar of the jaguar and the\r\nrustle of the boa had ceased to move their fear.\" Chap. XXIII.\r\n\r\n[126] Op. cit., p. 347.\r\n\r\n[127] Historia de Abiponibus, Vol. II, p. 231 et seq., Vienna,\r\n1784. \"Attention has recently been called to a group of peasant\r\nsuperstitions that have made their appearance in Germany, which are\r\nclosely analogous in principle to the couvade, though relating not to\r\nthe actual parents of the child but to the god-parents. It is believed\r\nthat the habits and proceedings of the god-father and god-mother affect\r\nthe child's life and character. Particularly, the god-father at the\r\nchristening must not think of disease or madness lest this come upon\r\nthe child; he must not look round on the way to the church lest the\r\nchild should grow up an idle stare-about; nor must he carry a knife\r\nabout him for fear of making the child a suicide; the god-mother must\r\nput on a clean shift to go to the baptism or the baby will grow up\r\nuntidy,\" etc., etc. See E. B. Tylor's Researches into the Early History\r\nof Mankind and the Development of Civilization, p. 304, Boston, 1878.\r\n\r\nFor further information on La Couvade, the reader is referred to\r\nBrett's Indian Tribes of Guiana, p. 355; Max Muller's Chips from a\r\nGerman Workshop, Vol. II, p. 281; Spix and Martius's Travels in Brazil,\r\nVol. II, p. 247; Du Tertre's Histoire Générale des Antilles habitées\r\npar les Francais, Vol. II, p. 371; Gilli's Saggio di Storia Americana,\r\nVol. II, p. 133; Tschudi's Peru, Vol. II, p. 235; Tylor's Researches\r\ninto the Early History of Mankind and the Development of Civilization,\r\np. 293, et seq; and Lafitau's Moeurs des Sauvages Americains, Vol. I,\r\np. 259.\r\n\r\n[128] One of the peculiarities of some savages is the decided objection\r\nthey manifest to having their photographs or portraits taken. They\r\nimagine that they lose somewhat of their own life by having their\r\nlikeness transferred to paper or other material. And the more\r\nperfect their likeness the greater, they fancy, is the loss which\r\nthey personally sustain. Having had some experience with the Indians\r\nof North America regarding this matter, I was not surprised to find\r\nthat there are in South America certain Indians who entertain similar\r\nnotions regarding the danger of having their pictures taken. Some, to\r\navoid having their photographs taken, will at once avert their faces;\r\nothers will run away to escape the impending danger. Cf. On the Origin\r\nof Civilization and the Primitive Condition of Man, by Lord Avebury,\r\nLondon, 1902, and The Indians of North America, Letter 15, by George\r\nCatlin, Edinburgh, 1903.\r\n\r\n[129] For the benefit of those who are familiar with Spanish I give\r\nthis touching quotation in the original. It is quite impossible\r\nto reproduce in a translation the verse and rhythm of the sonorous\r\nCastilian of the poet.\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Así de la Mision todos los niños\r\n        Corren en torno de la cruz que arranca\r\n        Enhiesta al aire y cercan al anciano,\r\n        Que entre tantas cabezas infantiles\r\n        Descuella allí con su cabeza blanca.\r\n        Oh! ni Platon, ni Socrates, famosos\r\n        En los anales del saber, supieron\r\n        Tras largos años de velar continuo\r\n        Lo que estos pobres niños, candorosos,\r\n        De los tremulos labios del anciano,\r\n        Al pié del leño rústico aprendieron.\"\r\n\r\n                         --From his ode Los Colonos.\r\n\r\n[130] Known in the West Indies as the god-tree and greatly venerated\r\nby the native negroes.

He\r\nsays: \"Inter arbores quae sponte hic passim nascuntur, memorantur a\r\nscriptoribus Hispanis quaedam quae lacteum quemdam liquorem fundunt,\r\nqui durus admodum evadit instar gummi, et suavem odorem de se\r\nfundit; aliae quae liquorem quemdam edunt, instar lactis coagulati,\r\nqui in cibis ab ipsis usurpatur sine noxa.\"--Descriptio Indiarum\r\nOccidentalium, Lib. XVIII.\r\n\r\n[133] In Venezuela and Colombia the word parasita--parasite--is usually\r\nemployed to designate all orchids, no matter what may be the species\r\nor genus. This is a mistake. Orchids are not parasites which, like the\r\ndodder or mistletoe, obtain their nourishment from the plant or tree\r\non which they grow. They are epiphytes, that get their nourishment\r\nfrom the surrounding atmosphere, and use the branches and trunks\r\nof trees merely as supports or resting-places. The Old World genus\r\nAërides is especially remarkable in this respect. One of the species,\r\nAërides odoratum, \"has this wonderful property, that, when brought\r\nfrom the woods, where it grows, into a house, and suspended in the\r\nair, it will grow, flourish and flower for many years without any\r\nnourishment, either from the earth or from water.\" For this reason\r\nthe orchid is appropriately called Flos aëris, or Air Flower.\r\n\r\n[134] Orchids: Their Culture and Management, p. 20, by W. Watson and\r\nH. J. Chapman, London, 1903.\r\n\r\nPeter Martyr must have had some of these orchids in mind when he\r\nwrote the following sentence as translated by Michael Lok:--\"Smooth\r\nand pleasinge words might be spoken of the sweete odors and perfumes\r\nof these countries, which we purposely omit because they make rather\r\nfor the effeminatinge of mens minds than for the maintanance of good\r\nbehavior.\" Dec. IV, Cap. 4, p. 161.\r\n\r\nFor colored figures and descriptions of the rare and beautiful\r\norchidaceous plants found in Venezuela and Colombia, the reader is\r\nreferred to The Orchid Album, 12 vols., conducted by Messrs. Warner,\r\nWilliams, Moore and Fitch, London.\r\n\r\n[135] Named after the astronomer Copernicus.\r\n\r\n[136] In eastern Colombia, if a cattle farm contains more than\r\na thousand head of cattle it is called a hato; if it counts less\r\nthan this number it is known as fundacion. A plantation in the hilly\r\ncountry is called a hacienda, in the plains a conuco, and if it have\r\na sugar-mill, it is named a trapiche.\r\n\r\n[137] The steamer on which we had come to Orocué, took, on her\r\nreturn to Ciudad Bolivar, among other articles of freight, nearly\r\nthree tons of orchids, of many species, collected from divers parts\r\nof Colombia. They were intended for certain New York florists, and\r\nwere shipped directly to their greenhouses in New Jersey. They were\r\ngathered by one of the many orchid collectors that are constantly\r\nengaged in tropical America in making collections for florists in\r\nthe United States and Europe.\r\n\r\nSometimes they come across new species of rarest beauty. This\r\nmeans a treasure-trove for the lucky finder. Not long before our\r\nvisit to Colombia a truly magnificent specimen had been discovered\r\nby one of these collectors. It was sold in London for a thousand\r\npounds sterling. And we heard of others that fetched prices quite\r\nas extravagant as any that were ever paid for tulip-bulbs during\r\nthe period of the tulipomania in Holland in the early part of the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\n[138] Viajes Cientificos á los Andes Ecuatoriales, p. 29, Paris, 1849.\r\n\r\n[139] Personal Narrative, up. sup., Vol. II, p. 438 et seq.\r\n\r\n[140] Casanare, p. 11, Bogotá, 1896.\r\n\r\n[141] Writing of the juice of the arnotto berries, \"that die a most\r\nperfect crimson and carnation,\" Sir Walter Raleigh declares, \"And for\r\npainting, al France, Italy or the east Indies yield none such.

They are sometimes large enough to hold from twenty to\r\ntwenty five persons. Usually, however, their capacity is limited\r\nto five or six persons. The curiara is smaller than the bongo or\r\nfalca. The bongo is generally provided with a covering in the centre\r\ncalled a toldo or carroza. This is made of lattice-work with palm\r\nleaves to shelter the traveler from the sun and rain. It is steered\r\nand urged backwards and forwards by a man standing at the stern, who\r\nuses a kind of oar--canalete--very much as a Venetian gondolier handles\r\nhis oar for steering and propelling his gondola. When the current does\r\nnot permit the use of oars those standing near the prow urge the boat\r\nforward by poles called palancas. The boatmen are called bogas and the\r\nropes with which they sometimes pull their canoes forward are called\r\nsogas. The bongo, especially when the river is high, is a very slow\r\nmeans of locomotion. And owing to the very limited space of the toldo,\r\neven in the largest canoes, traveling in a bongo is, at best, very\r\nconfining and uncomfortable. A journey any distance in one of these\r\nlong, narrow, crank dug-outs--more unstable than a shell--is a trying\r\nexperience, and one that all travelers in equatorial America avoid\r\nwhenever possible. The treacherous craft is liable to capsize when\r\none least expects it. Even a skilled Oxford or Harvard sculler would\r\nat times have great difficulty in keeping his balance in one of them.\r\n\r\n[144] Also called papelon--cane-syrup boiled down, without being\r\nclarified, and cast into molds.

It expresses, at the same time, the opinion of it\r\nentertained by all travelers in tropical countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Mi hamaca ea un tesoro,\r\n        Es mi mejor alhaja;\r\n        Á la ciudad, al campo,\r\n        Siempre ella me acompaña.\r\n        Oh prodigio de industria!\r\n        Cuando no encuentro casa,\r\n        La cuelgo de los troncos,\r\n        Y allí esta mi posada.\r\n        'Salud, salud doe veces\r\n        Al que invento la hamaca!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMention is made of hammocks by Vespucci and Alonso de Ojeda as early as\r\n1498. They are made on hand-looms from the fibres of various species\r\nof palm and bromelia or from cotton thread. In their manufacture\r\nthe Indian women often display considerable skill and taste. This is\r\nparticularly true of the hammocks made in the regions of the upper Rio\r\nNegro, which are beautifully decorated with the feathers of parrots,\r\ntoucans and other birds of brilliant plumage.\r\n\r\n\"The hammock,\" as Schomburgk well observes, \"is the most indispensable\r\narticle in the Indian's house, or for an Indian's journey. On his\r\ntravels it is carried folded up and slung round his neck; the greatest\r\nprecaution is used to prevent its getting wet. Where a halt is made,\r\nbe it of ever so short a duration, the first object sought for is a\r\nconvenient tree from which he can suspend it. It is a compliment paid\r\nto the stranger, if the host takes the hammock from him on entering\r\nthe house and slings it for his guest, and it is the duty of the\r\nwife to do this service for her husband. The common hammocks of the\r\nIndians are generally open, that is, not closely woven, and colored\r\nred with roucou or arnotto.\" Op. cit., p. 66.\r\n\r\n[146] Peter Martyr, writing of the West Indies, informs us that \"In\r\nall these Ilandes is a certeyne kynde of trees as bygge as elmes,\r\nwhiche beare gourdes in the steade of fruites. These they vse only\r\nfor drinkynge pottes, and to fetch water in, but not for meate, for\r\nthe inner substance of them is sowrer then gaule, and the barke as\r\nharde as any shelle.\" Eden, op. cit., p. 76.\r\n\r\n[147] \"Tutti dormono insieme come i polli, chi in terra, chi in aria\r\nsospeso.\"--Historia del Mondo Novo, In Venetia, 1565.\r\n\r\n[148] Often misspelled yucca, which is the name of a genus of plants\r\nbelonging to the lily family.

Perhaps 300 yards. Poor innocent,\r\nignorant reader! unconscious of what Nature has done in the forests\r\nof Cayenne, and measuring the force of tropical intonation by the\r\nsounds of a Scotch duck! The campanero may be heard three miles!--this\r\nsingle little bird being more powerful than the belfry of a cathedral,\r\nringing for a new dean--just appointed on account of shabby politics,\r\nsmall understanding, and good family!\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible to contradict a gentleman who has been in the\r\nforests of Cayenne; but we are determined, as soon as a campanero is\r\nbrought to England, to make him toll in a public place, and have the\r\ndistance measured.\"\r\n\r\n[154]  \"In angry sea, in sudden storm,\r\n        I thee invoke, our star benign.\"\r\n\r\n[155] Compare the reception of Ulysses by Eumæus, in the fourteenth\r\nbook of the Odyssey, where the old servant of the wandering hero is\r\nmade to say to his unknown master:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                            \"Guest!

Geo. E. Church had arrived\r\nindependently at a similar conclusion to my own. \"The Andes,\" writes\r\nCol.

Schomburgk\r\ninforms us that during his exploration of Guiana it was for weeks\r\nhis chief sustenance.\r\n\r\n[163] It is surprising what erroneous notions have been and are\r\nstill entertained regarding the distance of Bogotá from the head of\r\nnavigation on the eastern side of the Andes. Many recent writers place\r\nthe distance at twenty miles. Michelena y Rojas, in his Exploración\r\nOficial, p. 293, makes it but four leagues. Schomburgk, in an article\r\nin the Journal of the Geographical Society, Vol. X, p. 278, assures us\r\nthat by way of the Meta there is uninterrupted navigation to within\r\neight miles of Sante Fe de Bogotá! The fact is that the nearest\r\npoint to Bogotá to which vessels of even light draught may ascend\r\nby the Meta is Barrigón, more than one hundred and fifty miles from\r\nColombia's capital. Small flat boats and canoes may, through some of\r\nthe affluents of the Meta, approach considerably nearer. During the\r\nrainy season they may even reach the foothills of the Andes at the\r\nbase of which Villavicencio stands. But from here, the nearest point\r\nto the capital which even the smallest craft can reach to Bogotá,\r\nthe distance is still ninety-three miles at the lowest estimate. To\r\nnavigate the Rio Negro, as Rojas and others imagine can be done,\r\nfrom the llanos to Caquesa--thirty-seven hundred feet higher than the\r\nplains--would be no more possible than it would be to row or sail\r\nup an Alpine torrent. From Caquesa to Bogotá is not four leagues,\r\nas Michelena estimates, but full twenty-five miles.\r\n\r\n[164]  \"Dichoso aquel que alcanza\r\n        Como rico don del Cielo,\r\n        Para defender su suelo\r\n        Buen caballo y buena lanza.\"\r\n\r\n[165] \"When roseate Aurora shows her fresh face in the East, in vain I\r\nseek my gentle spouse, in vain I look for the daughter my soul adores,\r\nto imprint a kiss on their brows.\"\r\n\r\n[166] \"O what prodigies!

Multitudes\r\nof small crosses are fixed in the rocks by pious hands, in memory of\r\nformer travelers, who have died here; and along the path are strewed\r\nfragments of saddlery, trunks and various articles that have been\r\nabandoned, and resemble the traces of a routed army.\" Vol. III, p. 165.\r\n\r\n[186] The Guia de la Republica de Colombia, p. 301, por M.

Personally, I prefer to think the name\r\nis Spanish. For this particular range it is a most appropriate epithet.\r\n\r\n[189] Padre Simon says that Federmann, after crossing the Cordillera,\r\ntarried for a while in the province of Pasca. Castellanos declares\r\nit was in the pueblo of Pasca, a small town a short distance south\r\nof our route. According to Vergara y Velasco, the adventurous\r\nGerman conquistador entered \"the Sabana of Bogatá by way of Pasca\r\nand Usme.\" Usme is a village that is on the road along which we\r\npassed. Col. Joaquin Acosta tells us the Cordillera was crossed in\r\nthe broadest and most rugged part, \"where even to-day the most daring\r\nhunters scarcely ever venture. Neither before nor since Federmann\r\nhave horses scaled the craggy crests of Pascote and crossed the\r\nheights of Suma Paz and descended thence to Pasca in the valley of\r\nFusagasuga.\" Oviedo informs us that it required twenty-two days to\r\ncross the paramos, which was so extremely cold that sixteen horses\r\nwere frozen to death. But whether Federmann crossed Suma Paz where we\r\ndid or, as some think, at a point farther south, it is reasonable to\r\nsuppose that his route from Villavicencio to Bogatá was practically\r\nthe same as our own.\r\n\r\n[190]                       \"Earth receives againe,\r\n        Whatever she brought forth, and they obtaine\r\n        Heaven's couverture, that have no urnes at all.\"\r\n\r\n                --Lucan's Pharsalia, Lib.

Suddenly there appeared among\r\nthem an old man, who came from the plains situate on the east of\r\nthe Cordillera of Chingasa; and who appeared to be of a race unlike\r\nthat of the natives, having a long and bushy beard. He was known by\r\nthree distinct appellations, Bochica, Nemquetheba, and Zuhe. This\r\nold man, like Manco-Capac, instructed men how to clothe themselves,\r\nbuild huts, till the ground, and form themselves into communities. He\r\nbrought with him a woman, to whom also tradition gives three names,\r\nChia, Yubecayguaya, and Huythaca. This woman, extremely beautiful,\r\nand no less malignant, thwarted every enterprise of her husband for\r\nthe happiness of mankind. By her skill in magic, she swelled the\r\nriver of Funza, and inundated the valley of Bogatá. The greater part\r\nof the inhabitants perished in this deluge; a few only found refuge\r\non the summits of the neighbouring mountains. The old man, in anger\r\ndrove the beautiful Huythaca far from the Earth, and she became the\r\nMoon, which began from that epoch to enlighten our planet during the\r\nnight. Bochica, moved with compassion for those who were dispersed over\r\nthe mountains, broke with his powerful arm the rocks that enclosed\r\nthe valley, on the side of Canoas and Tequendama. By this outlet he\r\ndrained the waters of the lake of Bogotá; he built towns, introduced\r\nthe worship of the Sun, named two chiefs, between whom he divided the\r\ncivil and ecclesiastical authority, and then withdrew himself, under\r\nthe name of Idacanzas, into the holy valley of Iraca, near Tunja,\r\nwhere he lived in the exercise of the most austere penitence for\r\nthe space of two thousand years.\"--Vues de Cordillères et Monuments\r\ndes Peuples Indigènes de l'Amérique, par Al. de Humboldt, Paris,\r\n1810. Compare Piedrahita's Historia General de las Conquistas del\r\nNuevo Reino de Granada, Cap. III, Bogotá, 1881. Piedrahita, following\r\nother authors, was of the opinion that Bochica was no other than the\r\nApostle Bartholomew, who, according to a widespread legend, preached\r\nthe gospel in this part of the world.\r\n\r\n[196] \"Why do you plant these eucalyptus trees around your houses?\" I\r\nasked of a peon one day. \"Para evitar la fiebre, Sumerced,\" to prevent\r\nfever, your honor. The \"Sumerced,\" in this reply, is only one of many\r\nindications of deference on the part of the common people in their\r\nintercourse with strangers, or with those whom they regard as their\r\nsuperiors. It is an echo of the courtly language employed in the days\r\nof the viceroyalty.\r\n\r\n[197] The height of the falls, according to Humboldt's measurements,\r\nis one hundred and seventy metres. Before his visit they were supposed\r\nto be much higher. Piedrahita calls them one of the wonders of the\r\nworld and declares that their height is half a league. Around the top\r\nof the falls are seen oak, elm and cinchona trees; at the bottom are\r\nfound palms, bananas and sugar-cane. Colombans always refer to these\r\nfacts when they wish to impress the stranger with the extraordinary\r\nheight of Tequendama, as compared with that of other great falls.

La Araucana, the so-called epic\r\npoem of Ercilla, pronounced an Iliad by Voltaire and considered by\r\nSismondi a mere newspaper in rhyme, is a case in point. Nowhere,\r\nin this long work of forty-two thousand verses, \"has the aspect\r\nof volcanoes covered with eternal snow, of torrid sylvan valleys,\r\nand of arms of the sea extending far into the land, been productive\r\nof any descriptions that may be regarded as graphical.\" It exhibits,\r\nit is true, a certain animation in describing the heroic struggle of\r\nthe brave Araucanians for their homes and liberty, but, aside from\r\nthis, the higher elements of poetry--especially of epic poetry--are\r\nentirely lacking.\r\n\r\nThe same observation can be made with still greater truth of the\r\nArauco Domado, of Padre Oña; of the Argentina, of Barco Centenera;\r\nthe Cortés Valeroso, and the Mejicana, of Laso de la Vega; and\r\nthe oft-quoted Elegias de Varones Ilustres de Indias, of Juan de\r\nCastellanos. All of these, with the exception of the last-mentioned\r\nwork, have long since been buried in almost complete oblivion. The\r\ninfluence of the Italian school is everywhere manifest in these\r\nproductions--an influence which, while it may have contributed to\r\npurity, correctness and elegance of expression, was quite destructive\r\nof the vigor, freshness and originality so characteristic of the great\r\nmasters of Spanish verse.

Muisca is a Chibcha word signifying person.\r\n\r\n[222] The Chibchas, like many people living on the Andean plateaus\r\nto-day, derived their chief sustenance from potatoes and maize, both\r\nof which are indigenous to South America. Oviedo speaks of the potato\r\nas their principal aliment, as it was always served with whatever\r\nelse they ate. According to Castellanos, it was a favorite article\r\nof diet with the conquistadores, as well as with the Indians.\r\n\r\nMaize afforded them meat and drink, for out of it they made bread\r\nand their highly-prized beverage, chicha, which is still so popular\r\namong their descendants. Of the paramount importance of this article\r\nof food among the aborigines of the New World, John Fiske, in his\r\nvaluable work, The Discovery of America, writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Maize or Indian corn has played a most important part in the history\r\nof the New World, as regards both the red men and the white men. It\r\ncould be planted without clearing or ploughing the soil. It was only\r\nnecessary to girdle the trees with a stone hatchet, so as to destroy\r\ntheir leaves, and let in the sunshine. A few scratches and digs were\r\nmade in the ground with a stone digger, and the seed once dropped in\r\ntook care of itself. The ears could hang for weeks after ripening,\r\nand could be picked off without meddling with the stalk; there was\r\nno need of threshing or winnowing. None of the Old World cereals can\r\nbe cultivated without much more industry and intelligence.\" Vol. 1,\r\npp. 27, 28. M. Alphonse de Candolle, in his learned work, Origin of\r\nCultivated Plants, seems to regard Colombia as the original home of\r\nmaize, while he inclines to the opinion that Chile was the point of\r\ndeparture of the potato--Solanum tuberosum.\r\n\r\n[223] Prehistoric America, p. 460, London, 1885.\r\n\r\n[224] It is saying more than the facts will warrant to assert, as\r\ndoes Ameghino, that \"En Nueva Granada las inscripciones geroglificas\r\nse encuentran a cada paso\"--that hieroglyphic inscriptions are found\r\neverywhere.

They\r\nwill tell you frankly that the inhabitants of certain parts of the\r\ncountry are addicted to intoxication, or, as one of them expresses it,\r\nthat they are \"muy amigos de embriagarse\"--fond of getting drunk. And\r\nno one, I think, will deny that the prevalence of the drink habit\r\nis one of the country's greatest curses. A good old padre, learned\r\nand patriotic, wrote a book some decades ago, in which he contended\r\nthat Colombia, by reason of its favored geographical position and its\r\nwonderful natural resources, should rank among the richest and most\r\nprosperous countries of the New World. And it would be, he insisted,\r\nwere it not for three drawbacks. These, in his estimation, were\r\nborracheria, holgozaneria and politiqueria, to-wit, drunkenness,\r\nindolence, and the habit, so universally prevalent, of its people\r\ndabbling in questionable politics. We have no equivalent in English for\r\nthe expressive word, politiqueria, although we should have frequent use\r\nfor it if it existed. It means, literally, the methods and occupation\r\nof a politicaster--an individual who is as much of a drawback to the\r\nbest interests of our own country as is the politicastro to Colombia.\r\n\r\nTo the great amount of chicha sold in these estancos, usually kept\r\nby women, is undoubtedly traceable the origin of the saying, Toda\r\nchichera muere rica--Every chicha vender dies rich.\r\n\r\n[233] According to Franz Keller and other travelers in South America,\r\nthe Indian women in certain parts of the continent prepare chicha by\r\nmasticating the maize, just as some of the Polynesians prepare kava and\r\ncertain other of their favorite beverages by mastication. They claim\r\nthat when thus prepared it has a far more agreeable flavor than when\r\nprepared artificialmente, that is, by the method above described. See\r\nThe Amazon and Madeira Rivers, p. 164 et seq., London, 1874.\r\n\r\nSpix and Martius' Travels in Brazil, Vol. II, p. 232, London, 1824,\r\nsay, \"It is remarkable that this mode of preparing a fermented liquor\r\nout of maize, mandioca flour or bananas, is found among the various\r\nIndian tribes of America, and seems peculiar to this race.\"\r\n\r\nSir Robert Schomburgk, referring to the intoxicating drink, paiwori,\r\nmade from cassava bread, writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"The women, who prepare the beverage, assemble around a large jar or\r\nother earthen vessel, and having moistened their mouths with fresh\r\nwater, they commence chewing the bread, collecting in the vessel the\r\nmoisture which accumulates in the mouth. This is afterwards put into\r\na trough, called canaua, or in large jars, in which a quantity of\r\nthe charred bread has been broken up, over which boiling water is\r\npoured; and it is then kneaded, and portions which are not of an\r\neven consistency are again carried to the mouth, ground with the\r\nteeth, and returned into the earthen pot. The process is repeated\r\nseveral times, from the idea that it conduces to the strength of\r\nthe beverage. The second day fermentation begins, and on the third\r\nthe liquor is considered fit for use. We have seen a whole village,\r\nyoung and old, men and women, occupied in this disgusting process when\r\nit was contemplated to celebrate our unexpected arrival among them;\r\notherwise, for common use, the females alone employ themselves ex\r\nofficio with the preparation. Their teeth suffer so much from this\r\noccupation that a female has seldom a good tooth after she is thirty\r\nyears old.... The taste of the paiwori is very refreshing after\r\ngreat fatigue, and not unpleasant to the taste; if offered as the\r\ncup of welcome by the Indian, it would be a great offense to refuse\r\nit.\"--The Discovery of Guiana, ut sup., pp. 64, 65.\r\n\r\n[234] Reisen in den Columbianischen Anden, Leipzig, 1888.\r\n\r\n[235] The usual name given the humming bird by the people of Venezuela\r\nand Colombia is colibri. It is also known as the pajarito-mosca--little\r\nbird fly--or pica-flor--flower-nibbler. But the most beautiful and\r\nmost picturesque names are those in use by the Indians, who seem\r\nto have a particular faculty for inventing appropriate epithets\r\nfor whatever specially strikes their fancy. By them humming birds\r\nare called \"The rays of the sun,\" \"The tresses of the day-star\" and\r\n\"Living sunbeams.\" The poet Bailey has incorporated the last of these\r\nnames in the couplet,\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Bright Humming-bird of gem-like plumeletage,\r\n        By western Indians Living Sunbeam named,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAudubon was but imitating the children of the forest when he called\r\nhumming birds \"Glittering fragments of the rainbow.\"\r\n\r\n[236] Even the Colombian writer, Vergara y Velasco, who, like South\r\nAmericans generally, is slow to grow enthusiastic over natural scenery,\r\nrefers to the view from El Sargento as a \"Sitio pintoresco si los\r\nhay\"--a picturesque place if there be any.\r\n\r\n[237] Act III, Scene VI.\r\n\r\n[238] According to Karl Fauehaber, the explorer of the Quindio\r\nCordillera, Tolima has an altitude of 20,995 feet.\r\n\r\n[239] \"With Francis of Assisi and his Hymn to the Sun,\" we are\r\ninformed by a recent writer, \"the love of wild nature became more\r\narticulate.\" As an illustration of the effect of Nature-love on\r\nsensitive souls, we are told that the poet Gay, after visiting the\r\nGrande Chartreuse, declared that if he had lived in St. Bruno's day,\r\nhe would have been one of his disciples. \"It was,\" he said, \"one of\r\nthe most solemn, the most romantic and the most astonishing scenes\r\nI ever beheld.\"\r\n\r\n[240] Shelley's Alastor, or The Spirit of Solitude.\r\n\r\n[241] The negroes of Colombia are often of a highly poetical nature,\r\nand, like those of our Southern states, are passionately fond of\r\nmusic, singing and dancing. Their voices are often marvelously elastic,\r\nexpansive and harmonious. Their favorite air and dance is the bambuco,\r\nof African origin, to which Jorge Isaacs refers in his charming Caucan\r\nnovel, Maria, and of which Vergara y Vergara in his valuable Historia\r\nde la Literatura en Nueva Granada (Parte primera, p. 513, Bogotá,\r\n1867) gives us so glowing an account. It is the latter writer that\r\nassures us that if a negro were to play a marimba in the forests of\r\nthe South Coast, he could be certain that wild beasts and serpents\r\nwould listen to him in silent ecstasy.\r\n\r\n[242] \"Hail, hail, majestic river!... Contemplating thee, adorned\r\nby the eldest of Earth's sons; full only of thee, I feel my soul\r\ncarried on by the foam of thy waves, which in deep whirlpools roar,\r\nabsorbed in the giant works of that Being which embraces the infinite.\"\r\n\r\n[243] The reader will be surprised to learn that the aggregate\r\ncapacity of all the boats--champans included--at present plying on\r\nthe Magdalena--proudly named by the people the Danube of Colombia--is\r\nnot more than eleven thousand tons, about half the tonnage of one of\r\nour great transatlantic steamers.\r\n\r\n[244] Op. cit., 3a Noticia, Cap. IX.\r\n\r\n[245] The first mention, apparently, of the Magdalena, as distinguished\r\nfrom the Rio Grande, occurs in Benzoni's work, already cited.\r\n\r\n[246] Called by the natives Cabeza de Negro--Negro-head--from the\r\nglobular form of the spathe enclosing the nuts.\r\n\r\n[247] The introduction of the steamboat on the Magdalena will soon\r\nsuppress the rude yet picturesque craft known as the champan. With it\r\nwill disappear that interesting type of negro known as the boga. The\r\nboga is tall and robust, with the habits of a savage. He spends\r\nthe greater part of his time in the champan, and his life as a\r\npunter is a strenuous one and full of danger. He speaks a barbarous\r\njargon--currulao--composed of Spanish and of certain African and\r\nIndian dialects. His ideas of honor and honesty are not unlike\r\nthose of similar people in other parts of the world. One can safely\r\ntrust him with money and clothing, but, if the traveler have liquor\r\nof any kind with him, the boga will be sure to purloin it at the\r\nfirst opportunity. He is simple, frank, and brave. He sings during\r\ngood weather, even while struggling against the current or fighting\r\ncaymans, but he swears like a trooper during rain and thunder storms,\r\nespecially when the lightning strikes near him. For him death is\r\na very simple matter. A dead man to him is like a champan damaged\r\nbeyond repair--something to be carried away by the all-devouring river.\r\n\r\n[248] The exact altitudes of the points named are as follows:--Cumbre\r\nPass, between Chile and Argentina, 12,505 feet; Crucero Alto, between\r\nArequipa and Lake Titicaca, 14,666 feet; Galera Tunnel, 15,665 feet. At\r\nUrbina, on the recently-completed railroad between Guayaquil and Quito,\r\nthe height above sea level is 11,841 feet.\r\n\r\n[249] In Colombia, the white race, composed of the descendants of the\r\nconquistadores, most of whom have intermarried with the indigenous\r\ntribes, constitutes fifty per cent of the population. The negroes\r\ncompose thirty-five and the Indians fifteen per cent. In Venezuela\r\nthe descendants of Europeans are in the minority, while in Ecuador,\r\nPeru and Bolivia the indigenes make up nearly two-thirds of the\r\ninhabitants.

XXXIX, by Richard Spruce, London, 1908.\r\n\r\n[252] The route followed by Quesada from the Magdalena to the\r\nplateau of Bogotá has remained impassable for horses since the time\r\nof the conquest. To one familiar with the difficulties of the way,\r\nit seems impossible that so small a body of soldiers should ever\r\nhave been able to take sixty horses with them and bring them all,\r\nwith a single exception, in safety to the plains above. It may be\r\nsafely doubted if such a feat could be accomplished now. But \"there\r\nwere giants in those days.\"\r\n\r\n[253] The fact that the Spaniards found potatoes here on their arrival,\r\nand the further fact that there was never any communication, so far\r\nas known, between New Granada and Chile before the conquest, would\r\nseem to indicate that the Solanum tuberosum may have been, contrary\r\nto the opinion of Humboldt and De Candolle, indigenous to Colombia.\r\n\r\n[254] Op. cit., Dec. I, Book X.\r\n\r\n[255] Quesada's infantry received as their share of the spoil, which\r\nhad been secured, the equivalent of about $1,000. The cavalry received\r\ntwice this amount.\r\n\r\n[256] In the province of Sinu the amount of treasure in gold and jewels\r\nsecured in one day amounted to $300,000. Not without reason, then,\r\nwas this part of the New World designated by the early geographers,\r\nCastilla del Oro--Golden Castile.\r\n\r\n[257] The Republic of Colombia, p. 59, London, 1906.\r\n\r\nNothing is farther from my mind than to call in question the veracity\r\nof distinguished naturalists and travelers regarding any statements\r\nthey may have made concerning the vast numbers of animals and birds\r\nseen by them in the equinoctial regions of South America. But my\r\nexperience proves at least one thing and that is that one may travel\r\na long time in the very heart of the tropics, and see very little\r\nof its fauna, even in those parts in which it is generally supposed\r\nthat there are always representatives of many kinds and that, too,\r\nin great numbers.\r\n\r\n[258] The following sentence affords an interesting commentary on\r\nthe occasional rarity of certain animals which are usually supposed\r\nto be always visible in large numbers, especially in the Magdalena.\r\n\r\n\"I have read much of the number of alligators on the Magdalena, but\r\nhave not seen one.\"--The Journal of an Expedition Across Venezuela\r\nand Colombia, p. 264, 1906-7, by Hiram Bingham, New Haven. 1909.\r\n\r\nRaleigh says he saw in Guiana thousands of these \"vglie serpants\"\r\ncalled Lagartos.\r\n\r\n[259] Mr. R. L. Ditmars, Curator of Reptiles in the New York Zoological\r\nPark, in his interesting work, The Reptile Book, writes as follows of\r\nthe crocodile: \"The sight of a child will send a twelve-foot specimen\r\nrushing from its basking place for the water, and a man may even\r\nbathe in safety in rivers frequented by the species. The dangerous\r\n'man-eating' crocodiles inhabit India and Africa.\" P. 91.

According to\r\nthe Bulletin of the U. S. Fish Commission, XI, 1891, p. 343, it is\r\nestimated that 2,500,000 were killed in Florida between 1880 and 1894.\r\n\r\n[261] Dec.

For the Kings of Spain having on several occasions sent\r\ntheir ambassadors to the Kings of England and France to complain\r\nof the molestations and troubles those pyrates often caused on the\r\ncoasts of America, even in the calm of peace, it hath always been\r\nanswered that such men did not commit those acts of hostility and\r\npyracy as subjects to their Majesties, and therefore his Catholick\r\nMajesty might proceed against them as he should think fit. The King\r\nof France added that he had no fortress nor castle upon Hispaniola,\r\nneither did he receive a farthing of tribute from thence. And the\r\nKing of England adjoined that he had never given any commission to\r\nthose of Jamaica to commit hostilities against the subjects of his\r\nCatholick Majesty.\" Op. cit., p. 58, Vol. I.\r\n\r\n[277] Here, says Sir Frederick Treves, in his charming work. The Cradle\r\nof the Deep, \"In defiance of the ban of Spain, a strange company\r\nbegan to collect.... They came across the seas in obedience to no\r\ncall; in ones and twos they came. Frenchmen, British, and Dutch,\r\nand, led by some herding instinct, they foregathered at this wild\r\ntrysting-place. Some were mere dare-devil adventurers, others were wily\r\nseekers after fortune; the few were in flight from the grip of justice,\r\nthe many had roamed away from the old sober world in search of freedom.\r\n\r\n\"There was a common tie that banded them together, the call of the\r\nwild and the hate of Spain. They formed no colony, nor settlement, but\r\nsimply joined themselves together in a kind of jungle brotherhood. They\r\nfound a leader as a pack of wolves finds theirs, not by choosing one\r\nto lead but by following the one who led.\" P. 250, London, 1908.\r\n\r\n[278] For awhile the term Buccaneer was applied to the English,\r\nwho had nothing to do with the bucan, as well as to the French\r\nadventurers. Subsequently the French sea-rovers became known as\r\nflibustiers, the French sailors' pronunciation of the word freebooter,\r\nwhile the English corsairs appropriated the name Buccaneers. As their\r\noccupations were the same--making war on the Spaniard--the two terms\r\ncame eventually to be regarded as synonymous. All the freebooters,\r\nwhether English, French, or Dutch, as an indication of their being\r\nbanded against a common enemy, the Spaniards, assumed the name\r\nBrethren of the Coast. The members of this brotherhood must not be\r\nconfounded with such cutthroats as Kidd, Bonnet, Avery and Thatch,\r\nwho was known as Blackbeard and, for a while, terrorized the Atlantic\r\nCoast from the West Indies to New England.\r\n\r\n[279] Thus, the French Flibustier, Pierre le Grand, with only a small\r\nboat and a crew of but twenty-eight men, surprised and captured the\r\nship of the vice-admiral of the Spanish galleons as she was homeward\r\nbound with a rich cargo.\r\n\r\n[280] When John Watling, the successor of the deposed Captain Edmund\r\nCook, began his captaincy, he ordered all his crew to keep holy the\r\nSabbath day. \"With Edmund Cook down on the ballust in irons,\" writes\r\nMasefield, and William Cook talking of salvation in the galley, and\r\nold John Watling expounding the Gospel in the cabin, the galleon,\r\n'The most Holy Trinity,' must have seemed a foretaste of the New\r\nJerusalem. The fiddler ceased such prophane strophes as 'Abel Brown,'\r\n'The Red-haired Man's Wife,' and 'Valentinian.' He tuned his devout\r\nstrings to songs of Zion. Nay, the very boatswain could not pipe\r\nthe cutter up but to a phrase of the Psalms.\" (On the Spanish Main,\r\np. 263, London, 1906.)\r\n\r\n[281] History of the Buccaneers of America, Chap.

This was done\r\nto give the ruthless Buccaneer \"greater courage to attempt mighty\r\nthings.\" Op. cit., p. 147.\r\n\r\n[286] The Spaniards accused Queen Elizabeth of aiding Drake, and it is\r\nknown that she lent John Hawkins one of her ships. \"The great Queen,\"\r\nas Mowbray Morris observes, \"had a most convenient way of publically\r\ndeprecating the riotous acts of her subjects, when she found it\r\nexpedient to do so, and roundly encouraging them in private. She\r\nwas fond of money, too, and ... had found a share in these ventures\r\nuncommonly remunerative.

It appears for\r\nthe first time in an account of an expedition made by Martin Estete to\r\nthe river San Juan in 1529, twenty-seven years after the discovery of\r\nthe country by Columbus. It occurs subsequently in a document signed\r\nby the King of Spain, dated May 14, 1541. It is probable that the name\r\nwas given in consequence of the rich mines that had been discovered\r\nnear the town of Estrella, in Talamanca--from which it was inferred\r\nthat all the interior of the country was equally rich in the precious\r\nmetals--and not on account of the luxuriant vegetation that abounds,\r\nas is sometimes supposed.

The ratio of\r\nthe nutritive value of bananas and wheat is, according to Humboldt,\r\ntwenty-five to one in favor of bananas. Hence, he writes, \"a European,\r\nnewly arrived in the torrid zone is struck with nothing so much as\r\nthe extreme smallness of the spots under cultivation round a cabin\r\nwhich contains a numerous family of Indians.\"\r\n\r\n[292] Stanley, in In Darkest Africa, writes: \"If only the virtues\r\nof banana flour were publicly known, it is not to be doubted but it\r\nwould be largely consumed in Europe.

In Central America, Costaricans generally are known as\r\nTicos, while the people of Nicaragua are called Nicos or Pinolios,\r\nand those of Guatemala and Honduras Chopines and Guanacos respectively.\r\n\r\n[301] Compare this with the peculiar belief of the South American\r\nIndians, alluded to in Chap. IX, regarding the cry of a lost soul.\r\n\r\n[302] Veragua has a special interest for Americans, as \"the only\r\nthread of glory still held in the hands of the family of Columbus\"\r\nleads back to this narrow strip of territory on the western shores\r\nof the Caribbean. The present representative of this name in Spain\r\nis Don Cristobal Colon, Duke of Veragua. His full title is Duke of\r\nVeragua and Vega, Marquis of Jamaica, Admiral and High Steward of the\r\nIndies. The grandson of the discoverer of America, Don Luis Colon,\r\nwas the third Admiral and Viceroy of the Indies, the last of which\r\ntitles he relinquished for that of first Duke of Veragua and Vega.\r\n\r\n[303] \"Whatever he may have thought, or said he thought, when he\r\nwas at Cuba, on the second voyage; whatever he thought, or said he\r\nthought, when in a half-crazed condition in the island of Jamaica,\r\nhe now knew he really had discovered continental land, and that it\r\nwas separated from Catigara, or the land of the east, by a goodly\r\nstretch of another sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is pleasant to think that such a view is consistent with\r\nthe nautical, geographical and astronomical knowledge of the great\r\nDiscoverer.\"--Thatcher, Christopher Columbus, Vol. II. pp. 593 and 621.",
