It was a delusion, moreover, to which men of learning and\r\npiety lent themselves, and thus became the means of increasing it. The\r\nscene of this affair was the puritanical colony of New England, since\r\nbetter known as Massachusetts, the colonists of which appear to have\r\ncarried with them, in an exaggerated form, the superstitious feelings\r\nwith regard to witchcraft which then prevailed in the mother country. In\r\nthe spring of 1692 an alarm of witchcraft was raised in the family of\r\nthe minister of Salem, and some black servants were charged with the\r\nsupposed crime. Once started, the alarm spread rapidly, and in a very\r\nshort time a great number of people fell under suspicion, and many were\r\nthrown into prison on very frivolous grounds, supported, as such charges\r\nusually were, by very unworthy witnesses. The new governor of the\r\ncolony, Sir William Phipps, arrived from England in the middle of May,\r\nand he seems to have been carried away by the excitement, and authorized\r\njudicial prosecutions. The trials began at the commencement of June; and\r\nthe first victim, a woman named Bridget Bishop, was hanged. Governor\r\nPhipps, embarrassed by this extraordinary state of things, called in the\r\nassistance of the clergy of Boston.\r\n\r\nThere was at this time in Boston a distinguished family of puritanical\r\nministers of the name of Mather. Richard Mather, an English\r\nnon-conformist divine, had emigrated to America in 1636, and settled at\r\nDorchester, where, in 1639, he had a son born, who was named, in\r\naccordance with the peculiar nomenclature of the puritans, Increase\r\nMather. This son distinguished himself much by his acquirements as a\r\nscholar and a theologian, became established as a minister in Boston,\r\nand in 1685 was elected president of Harvard College. His son, born at\r\nBoston in 1663, and called from the name of his mother's family, Cotton\r\nMather, became more remarkable than his father for his scholarship,\r\ngained also a distinguished position in Harvard College, and was also,\r\nat the time of which we are speaking, a minister of the gospel in\r\nBoston. Cotton Mather had adopted all the most extreme notions of the\r\npuritanical party with regard to witchcraft, and he had recently had an\r\nopportunity of displaying them. In the summer of the year 1688, the\r\nchildren of a mason of Boston named John Goodwin were suddenly seized\r\nwith fits and strange afflictions, which were at once ascribed to\r\nwitchcraft, and an Irish washerwoman named Glover, employed by the\r\nfamily, was suspected of being the witch. Cotton Mather was called in\r\nto witness the sufferings of Goodwin's children; and he took home with\r\nhim one of them, a little girl, who had first displayed these symptoms,\r\nin order to examine her with more care. The result was, that the Irish\r\nwoman was brought to a trial, found guilty, and hanged; and Cotton\r\nMather published next year an account of the case, under the title of\r\n\"Late Memorable Providences, relating to Witchcraft and Possession,\"\r\nwhich displays a very extraordinary amount of credulity, and an equally\r\ngreat want of anything like sound judgment. This work, no doubt, spread\r\nthe alarm of witchcraft through the whole colony, and had some influence\r\non the events which followed. It may be supposed that the panic which\r\nhad now arisen in Salem was not likely to be appeased by the\r\ninterference of Cotton Mather and his father.\r\n\r\nThe execution of the washerwoman, Bridget Bishop, had greatly increased\r\nthe excitement; and people in a more respectable position began to be\r\naccused. On the 19th of July five more persons were executed, and five\r\nmore experienced the same fate on the 19th of August. Among the latter\r\nwas Mr. George Borroughs, a minister of the gospel, whose principal\r\ncrime appears to have been a disbelief in witchcraft itself. His fate\r\nexcited considerable sympathy, which, however, was checked by Cotton\r\nMather, who was present at the place of execution on horseback, and\r\naddressed the crowd, assuring them that Borroughs was an impostor. Many\r\npeople, however, had now become alarmed at the proceedings of the\r\nprosecutors, and among those executed with Borroughs was a man named\r\nJohn Willard, who had been employed to arrest the persons charged by\r\nthe accusers, and who had been accused himself, because, from\r\nconscientious motives, he refused to arrest any more. He attempted to\r\nsave himself by flight; but he was pursued and overtaken. Eight more of\r\nthe unfortunate victims of this delusion were hanged on the 22nd of\r\nSeptember, making in all nineteen who had thus suffered, besides one\r\nwho, in accordance with the old criminal law practice, had been pressed\r\nto death for refusing to plead. The excitement had indeed risen to such\r\na pitch that two dogs accused of witchcraft were put to death.\r\n\r\nA certain degree of reaction, however, appeared to be taking place, and\r\nthe magistrates who had conducted the proceedings began to be alarmed,\r\nand to have some doubts of the wisdom of their proceedings. Cotton\r\nMather was called upon by the governor to employ his pen in justifying\r\nwhat had been done; and the result was, the book which stands first in\r\nthe present volume, \"The Wonders of the Invisible World;\" in which the\r\nauthor gives an account of seven of the trials at Salem, compares the\r\ndoings of the witches in New England with those in other parts of the\r\nworld, and adds an elaborate dissertation on witchcraft in general. This\r\nbook was published at Boston, Massachusetts, in the month of October,\r\n1692. Other circumstances, however, contributed to throw discredit on\r\nthe proceedings of the court, though the witch mania was at the same\r\ntime spreading throughout the whole colony. In this same month of\r\nOctober, the wife of Mr. Hale, minister of Beverley, was accused,\r\nalthough no person of sense and respectability had the slightest doubt\r\nof her innocence; and her husband had been a zealous promoter of the\r\nprosecutions. This accusation brought a new light on the mind of Mr.\r\nHale, who became convinced of the injustice in which he had been made an\r\naccomplice; but the other ministers who took the lead in the proceedings\r\nwere less willing to believe in their own error; and equally convinced\r\nof the innocence of Mrs. Hale, they raised a question of conscience,\r\nwhether the devil could not assume the shape of an innocent and pious\r\nperson, as well as of a wicked person, for the purpose of afflicting his\r\nvictims. The assistance of Increase Mather, the president or principal\r\nof Harvard College, was now called in, and he published the book which\r\nis also reprinted in the present volume: \"A Further Account of the\r\nTryals of the New England Witches.... To which is added Cases of\r\nConscience concerning Witchcrafts and Evil Spirits personating Men.\" It\r\nwill be seen that the greater part of the \"Cases of Conscience\" is given\r\nto the discussion of the question just alluded to, which Increase Mather\r\nunhesitatingly decides in the affirmative. The scene of agitation was\r\nnow removed from Salem to Andover, where a great number of persons were\r\naccused of witchcraft and thrown into prison, until a justice of the\r\npeace named Bradstreet, to whom the accusers applied for warrants,\r\nrefused to grant any more. Hereupon they cried out upon Bradstreet, and\r\ndeclared that he had killed nine persons by means of witchcraft; and he\r\nwas so much alarmed that he fled from the place. The accusers aimed at\r\npeople in higher positions in society, until at last they had the\r\naudacity to cry out upon the lady of governor Phipps himself, and thus\r\nlost whatever countenance he had given to their proceedings out of\r\nrespect to the two Mathers. Other people of character, when they were\r\nattacked by the accusers, took energetic measures in self-defence. A\r\ngentleman of Boston, when \"cried out upon,\" obtained a writ of arrest\r\nagainst his accusers on a charge of defamation, and laid the damages at\r\na thousand pounds. The accusers themselves now took fright, and many who\r\nhad made confessions retracted them, while the accusations themselves\r\nfell into discredit. When governor Phipps was recalled in April, 1693,\r\nand left for England, the witchcraft agitation had nearly subsided, and\r\npeople in general had become convinced of their error and lamented it.\r\n\r\nBut Cotton Mather and his father persisted obstinately in the opinions\r\nthey had published, and looked upon the reactionary feeling as a triumph\r\nof Satan and his kingdom. In the course of the year they had an\r\nopportunity of reasserting their belief in the doings of the witches of\r\nSalem. A girl of Boston, named Margaret Rule, was seized with\r\nconvulsions, in the course of which she pretended to see the \"shapes\" or\r\nspectres of people exactly as they were alleged to have been seen by the\r\nwitch-accusers at Salem and Andover. This occurred on the 10th of\r\nSeptember, 1693; and she was immediately visited by Cotton Mather, who\r\nexamined her, and declared his conviction of the truth of her\r\nstatements. Had it depended only upon him, a new and no doubt equally\r\nbitter persecution of witches would have been raised in Boston; but an\r\ninfluential merchant of that town, named Robert Calef, took the matter\r\nup in a different spirit, and also examined Margaret Rule, and satisfied\r\nhimself that the whole was a delusion or imposture. Calef wrote a\r\nrational account of the events of these two years, 1692 and 1693,\r\nexposing the delusion, and controverting the opinions of the two Mathers\r\non the subject of witchcraft, which was published under the title of\r\n\"More Wonders of the Invisible World; or the Wonders of the Invisible\r\nworld displayed in five parts. An Account of the Sufferings of Margaret\r\nRule collected by Robert Calef, merchant of Boston in New England.\" The\r\npartisans of the Mathers displayed their hostility to this book by\r\npublicly burning it; and the Mathers themselves kept up the feeling so\r\nstrongly that years afterwards, when Samuel Mather, the son of Cotton,\r\nwrote his father's life, he says sneeringly of Calef: \"There was a\r\ncertain disbeliever in Witchcraft who wrote against this book\" (his\r\nfather's 'Wonders of the Invisible World'), \"but as the man is dead, his\r\nbook died long before him.\" Calef died in 1720.\r\n\r\nThe witchcraft delusion had, however, been sufficiently dispelled to\r\nprevent the recurrence of any other such persecutions; and those who\r\nstill insisted on their truth were restrained to the comparatively\r\nharmless publication and defence of their opinions. The people of Salem\r\nwere humbled and repentant. They deserted their minister, Mr. Paris,\r\nwith whom the persecution had begun, and were not satisfied until they\r\nhad driven him away from the place. Their remorse continued through\r\nseveral years, and most of the people concerned in the judicial\r\nproceedings proclaimed their regret. The jurors signed a paper\r\nexpressing their repentance, and pleading that they had laboured under a\r\ndelusion. What ought to have been considered still more conclusive,\r\nmany of those who had confessed themselves witches, and had been\r\ninstrumental in accusing others, retracted all they had said, and\r\nconfessed that they had acted under the influence of terror. Yet the\r\nvanity of superior intelligence and knowledge was so great in the two\r\nMathers that they resisted all conviction. In his _Magnalia_, an\r\necclesiastical history of New England, published in 1700, Cotton Mather\r\nrepeats his original view of the doings of Satan in Salem, showing no\r\nregret for the part he had taken in this affair, and making no\r\nretraction of any of his opinions. Still later, in 1723, he repeats them\r\nagain in the same strain in the chapter of the \"Remarkables\" of his\r\nfather entitled \"Troubles from the Invisible World.\" His father,\r\nIncrease Mather, had died in that same year at an advanced age, being in\r\nhis eighty-fifth year. Cotton Mather died on the 13th of February, 1728.\r\n\r\nWhatever we may think of the credulity of these two ecclesiastics, there\r\ncan be no ground for charging them with acting otherwise than\r\nconscientiously, and they had claims on the gratitude of their\r\ncountrymen sufficient to overbalance their error of judgment on this\r\noccasion. Their books relating to the terrible witchcraft delusion at\r\nSalem have now become very rare in the original editions, and their\r\ninterest, as remarkable monuments of the history of superstition, make\r\nthem well worthy of a reprint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE WONDERS OF THE INVISIBLE WORLD:--                           Page\r\n\r\n    The Author's Defence                                             3\r\n\r\n    Letter from Mr. _William Stoughton_                              6\r\n\r\n    Enchantments encountered                                         9\r\n\r\n    An Abstract of Mr. _Perkins's_ Way for the Discovery\r\n        of Witches                                                  30\r\n\r\n    The Sum of Mr. _Gaules_ Judgment about the Detection of\r\n        Witches                                                     33\r\n\r\n  A DISCOURSE ON THE WONDERS OF THE INVISIBLE WORLD                 38\r\n\r\n    An Hortatory and Necessary Address, to a Country now\r\n        Extraordinarily Alarum'd by the Wrath of the Devil          79\r\n\r\n    A Narrative of an Apparition which a Gentleman in Boston\r\n        had of his Brother, just then murthered in London          107\r\n\r\n    A Modern Instance of Witches discovered and condemned\r\n        in a Tryal, before that celebrated Judge, Sir Matthew\r\n        Hale                                                       111\r\n\r\n    The Tryal of _G.

From Several Scriptures                                   225\r\n\r\n      2. Because it is possible for the Devil, in the Shape of\r\n          Innocent Persons, to do other Mischiefs, proved by\r\n          many Instances                                           234\r\n\r\n      3. Because if Satan may not represent an Innocent Person\r\n          as afflicting others, it must be either because he\r\n          wants will or power to do this, or because God will\r\n          never permit him so to do it; either of which may\r\n          be affirmed                                              237\r\n\r\n      4. It is certain, both from Scripture and History, that\r\n          Magicians by their Inchantments and Hellish Conjurations\r\n          may cause a False Representation of Persons\r\n          and Things                                               243\r\n\r\n      5.

That of the bewitched Persons being recovered with a\r\n          Touch is various and fallible                            262\r\n\r\n      4. There are that question the Lawfulness of the Experiment  264\r\n\r\n      5. The Testimony of Bewitched or Possessed Persons is\r\n          no Evidence as to what they see concerning others,\r\n          and therefore not as to themselves                       266\r\n\r\n      6. Bewitched Persons have sometimes been struck down\r\n          with the Look of Dogs                                    267\r\n\r\n      7. If this were an Infallible Proof, there would be\r\n          difficulty in discovering Witches                        268\r\n\r\n      8. Nothing can be produced out of the Word of God to\r\n          shew, that this is any Proof of Witchcraft               268\r\n\r\n      9. Antipathies in Nature have Strange and Unaccountable\r\n          Effects                                                  268\r\n\r\n    The Third Case considered, Whether there are any Discoveries\r\n        of Witchcraft, which Jurors and Judges may\r\n        with a safe Conscience proceed upon to the Conviction\r\n        and Condemnation of the Persons under Suspicion?           269\r\n\r\n    Two things premised:--\r\n\r\n      1. That the Evidence in the Crime of Witchcraft ought\r\n          to be as clear as in any other Crimes of a Capital\r\n          Nature                                                   269\r\n\r\n      2. That there have been ways of Trying Witches long\r\n          used, which God never approved of. More particularly\r\n          that of casting the Suspected Party into the\r\n          Water, to try whether they will Sink or Swim.

A brief Discourse upon those _Temptations_ which are the more\r\n      ordinary Devices of Satan.\r\n\r\n\r\n  By _COTTON MATHER_.\r\n\r\n  Published by the Special Command of his EXCELLENCY the Govenour of the\r\n  Province of the _Massachusetts-Bay_ in _New-England_.\r\n\r\n  Printed first, at _Bostun_ in _New-England_; and Reprinted at _London_,\r\n  for _John Dunton_, at the _Raven_ in the _Poultry_. 1693.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR'S DEFENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Tis, as I remember, the Learned _Scribonius_, who reports, That one of\r\nhis Acquaintance, devoutly making his Prayers on the behalf of a Person\r\nmolested by _Evil Spirits_, received from those _Evil Spirits_ an\r\nhorrible Blow over the Face: And I may my self expect not few or small\r\nBuffetings from Evil Spirits, for the Endeavours wherewith I am now\r\ngoing to encounter them. I am far from insensible, that at this\r\nextraordinary Time of the _Devils coming down in great Wrath upon us_,\r\nthere are too many Tongues and Hearts thereby _set on fire of Hell_;\r\nthat the various Opinions about the Witchcrafts which of later time have\r\ntroubled us, are maintained by some with so much cloudy Fury, as if they\r\ncould never be sufficiently stated, unless written in the Liquor\r\nwherewith Witches use to write their Covenants; and that he who becomes\r\nan Author at such a time, had need be _fenced with Iron, and the Staff\r\nof a Spear_. The unaccountable Frowardness, Asperity, Untreatableness,\r\nand Inconsistency of many Persons, every Day gives a visible Exposition\r\nof that passage, _An evil spirit from the Lord came upon Saul;_ and\r\nIllustration of that Story, _There met him two possessed with Devils,\r\nexceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way._ To send abroad\r\na Book, among such Readers, were a very unadvised thing, if a Man had\r\nnot such Reasons to give, as I can bring, for such an Undertaking.\r\nBriefly, I hope it cannot be said, _They are all so:_ No, I hope the\r\nBody of this People, are yet in such a Temper, as to be capable of\r\napplying their Thoughts, to make a _Right Use_ of the stupendous and\r\nprodigious Things that are happening among us: And because I was\r\nconcern'd, when I saw that no abler Hand emitted any Essays to engage\r\nthe Minds of this People, in such holy, pious, fruitful Improvements, as\r\nGod would have to be made of his amazing Dispensations now upon us.\r\nTHEREFORE it is, that One of the Least among the Children of\r\n_New-England_, has here done, what is done. None, but _the Father, who\r\nsees in secret_, knows the Heart-breaking Exercises, wherewith I have\r\ncomposed what is now going to be exposed, lest I should in any one thing\r\nmiss of doing my designed Service for his Glory, and for his People; but\r\nI am now somewhat comfortably assured of his favourable acceptance; and,\r\n_I will not fear; what can a Satan do unto me!_\r\n\r\nHaving performed something of what God required, in labouring to suit\r\nhis Words unto his Works, at this Day among us, and therewithal handled\r\na Theme that has been sometimes counted not unworthy the Pen, even of a\r\nKing, it will easily be perceived, that some subordinate Ends have been\r\nconsidered in these Endeavours.\r\n\r\nI have indeed set myself to countermine the whole PLOT of the Devil,\r\nagainst _New-England_, in every Branch of it, as far as one of my\r\n_darkness_, can comprehend such a _Work of Darkness_. I may add, that I\r\nhave herein also aimed at the Information and Satisfaction of Good Men\r\nin another Country, a thousand Leagues off, where I have, it may be,\r\nmore, or however, more considerable Friends, than in my own: And I do\r\nwhat I can to have that Country, now, as well as always, in the best\r\nTerms with my own. But while I am doing these things, I have been driven\r\na little to do something likewise for myself; I mean, by taking off the\r\nfalse Reports, and hard Censures about my Opinion in these Matters, the\r\n_Parter's Portions_ which my _pursuit of Peace_ has procured me among\r\nthe _Keen_. My hitherto _unvaried Thoughts_ are here published; and I\r\nbelieve, they will be owned by most of the Ministers of God in these\r\nColonies; nor can amends be well made me, for the wrong done me, by\r\nother sorts of _Representations_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn fine: For the Dogmatical part of my Discourse, I want no Defence; for\r\nthe Historical part of it, I have a Very Great One; the\r\nLieutenant-Governour of _New-England_ having perused it, has done me the\r\nHonour of giving me a Shield, under the Umbrage whereof I now dare to\r\nwalk abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVEREND AND DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n_You very much gratify'd me, as well as put a kind Respect upon me, when\r\nyou put into my hands, your elaborate and most seasonable Discourse,\r\nentituled, +The Wonders of the Invisible World+. And having now perused\r\nso fruitful and happy a Composure, upon such a Subject, at this Juncture\r\nof Time; and considering the place that I hold in the Court of +Oyer+\r\nand +Terminer+, still labouring and proceeding in the Trial of the\r\nPersons accused and convicted for Witchcraft, I find that I am more\r\nnearly and highly concerned than as a meer ordinary Reader, to express\r\nmy Obligation and Thankfulness to you for so great Pains; and cannot but\r\nhold myself many ways bound, even to the utmost of what is proper for\r\nme, in my present publick Capacity, to declare my +singular Approbation+\r\nthereof. Such is your Design, most plainly expressed throughout the\r\nwhole; such your Zeal for God, your Enmity to Satan and his Kingdom,\r\nyour Faithfulness and Compassion to this poor People; such the Vigour,\r\nbut yet great Temper of your Spirit; such your Instruction and Counsel,\r\nyour +Care of Truth+, your Wisdom and Dexterity in allaying and\r\nmoderating that among us, which needs it; such your clear discerning of\r\nDivine Providences and Periods, now running on apace towards their\r\nGlorious Issues in the World; and finally, such your good News of +The\r\nShortness of the Devil's Time+, that all Good Men must needs desire, the\r\nmaking of this your Discourse publick to the World; and will greatly\r\nrejoyce, that the +Spirit of the Lord+ has thus enabled you to +lift up\r\na Standard+ against the Infernal Enemy, that hath been +coming in like a\r\nFlood upon us+. I do therefore make it my particular and earnest Request\r\nunto you, that as soon as may be, you will commit the same unto the\r\n+Press+ accordingly. I am,_\r\n\r\n                          Your assured Friend,\r\n\r\n                                 WILLIAM STOUGHTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nI live by _Neighbours_ that force me to produce these undeserved Lines.\r\nBut now, as when Mr. _Wilson_ beholding a great Muster of Souldiers, had\r\nit by a Gentleman then present, said unto him, _Sir, I'll tell you a\r\ngreat Thing: Here is a mighty Body of People; and there is not +Seven+\r\nof them all, but what loves Mr. +Wilson+._ That gracious Man presently\r\nand pleasantly reply'd: _Sir, I'll tell you as good a thing as that;\r\nhere is a mighty Body of People, and there is not so much as +One+ among\r\nthem all, but Mr. +Wilson+ loves him._ Somewhat so: 'Tis possible, that\r\namong this Body of People, there may be few that love the Writer of this\r\nBook; but give me leave to boast so far, there is not one among all this\r\nBody of People, whom this _Mather_ would not study to serve, as well as\r\nto love. With such a _Spirit of Love_, is the Book now before us\r\nwritten: I appeal to all _this World_; and if _this_ World will deny me\r\nthe Right of acknowledging so much, I appeal to the _other_, that it is\r\n_not written with an Evil Spirit_: for which cause I shall not wonder,\r\nif _Evil Spirits_ be exasperated by what is written, as the _Sadduces_\r\ndoubtless were with what was discoursed in the Days of our Saviour. I\r\nonly demand the _Justice_, that others _read_ it, with the same Spirit\r\nwherewith I _writ_ it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENCHANTMENTS ENCOUNTERED.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.\r\n\r\nIt was as long ago as the Year 1637, that a Faithful Minister of the\r\nChurch of _England_, whose Name was Mr. _Edward Symons_, did in a Sermon\r\nafterwards Printed, thus express himself; 'At _New-England_ now the Sun\r\nof Comfort begins to appear, and the glorious Day-Star to show it\r\nself;--_Sed Venient Annis Saeculae Seris_, there will come Times in after\r\nAges, when the _Clouds will over-shadow and darken the Sky there_. Many\r\nnow promise to themselves nothing but successive Happiness there, which\r\nfor a time through God's Mercy they may enjoy; and I pray God, they may\r\na long time; but in this World there is no Happiness perpetual.' An\r\n_Observation_, or I had almost said, an _Inspiration_, very dismally now\r\nverify'd upon us! It has been affirm'd by some who best knew\r\n_New-England_, That the World will do _New-England_ a great piece of\r\nInjustice, if it acknowledge not a measure of Religion, Loyalty,\r\nHonesty, and Industry, in the People there, beyond what is to be found\r\nwith any other People for the Number of them. When I did a few years\r\nago, publish a Book, which mentioned a few memorable Witchcrafts,\r\ncommitted in this country; the excellent _Baxter_, graced the Second\r\nEdition of that Book, with a kind Preface, wherein he sees cause to say,\r\n_If any are Scandalized, that +New-England+, a place of as serious\r\nPiety, as any I can hear of, under Heaven, should be troubled so much\r\nwith Witches; I think, 'tis no wonder: Where will the Devil show most\r\nMalice, but where he is hated, and hateth most:_ And I hope, the Country\r\nwill still deserve and answer the Charity so expressed by that Reverend\r\nMan of God. Whosoever travels over this Wilderness, will see it richly\r\nbespangled with Evangelical Churches, whose Pastors are holy, able, and\r\npainful Overseers of their Flocks, lively Preachers, and vertuous\r\nLivers; and such as in their several Neighbourly Associations, have had\r\ntheir Meetings whereat Ecclesiastical Matters of common Concernment are\r\nconsidered: _Churches_, whose Communicants have been seriously examined\r\nabout their Experiences of Regeneration, as well as about their\r\nKnowledge, and Belief, and blameless Conversation, before their\r\nadmission to the Sacred Communion; although others of less but hopeful\r\nAttainments in Christianity are not ordinarily deny'd Baptism for\r\nthemselves and theirs; Churches, which are shye of using any thing in\r\nthe Worship of God, for which they cannot see a Warrant of God; but with\r\nwhom yet the Names of _Congregational_, _Presbyterian_, _Episcopalian_,\r\nor _Antipaedobaptist_, are swallowed up in that of _Christian_; Persons\r\nof all those Perswasions being taken into our Fellowship, when visible\r\nGoodliness has recommended them: Churches, which usually do within\r\nthemselves manage their own Discipline, under the Conduct of their\r\nElders; but yet call in the help of _Synods_ upon Emergencies, or\r\nAggrievances: _Churches_, Lastly, wherein Multitudes are growing ripe\r\nfor Heaven every day; and as fast as these are taken off, others are\r\ndaily rising up. And by the Presence and Power of the Divine\r\nInstitutions thus maintained in the Country, We are still so happy, that\r\nI suppose there is no Land in the Universe more free from the\r\ndebauching, and the debasing Vices of Ungodliness. The Body of the\r\nPeople are hitherto so disposed, that _Swearing_, _Sabbath-breaking_,\r\n_Whoring_, _Drunkenness_, and the like, do not make a Gentleman, but a\r\nMonster, or a Goblin, in the vulgar Estimation. All this\r\nnotwithstanding, we must humbly confess to our God, that we are\r\nmiserably degenerated from the first Love of our Predecessors; however\r\nwe boast our selves a little, when Men would go to trample upon us, and\r\nwe venture to say, _Wherein soever any is bold (we speak foolishly) we\r\nare bold also._ The first Planters of these Colonies were a chosen\r\nGeneration of Men, who were first so pure, as to disrelish many things\r\nwhich they thought wanted Reformation elsewhere; and yet withal so\r\npeaceable, that they embraced a voluntary Exile in a squalid, horrid,\r\n_American_ Desart, rather than to live in Contentions with their\r\nBrethren. Those good Men imagined that they should leave their Posterity\r\nin a place, where they should never see the Inroads of Profanity, or\r\nSuperstition: And a famous Person returning hence, could in a Sermon\r\nbefore the Parliament, profess, _I have now been seven Years in a\r\nCountry, where I never Saw one Man drunk, or heard one Oath sworn, or\r\nbeheld one Beggar in the Streets all the while._ Such great Persons as\r\n_Budaeus_, and others, who mistook Sir _Thomas Moor's_ UTOPIA, for a\r\nCountry really existent, and stirr'd up some Divines charitably to\r\nundertake a Voyage thither, might now have certainly found a Truth in\r\ntheir Mistake; _New-England_ was a true _Utopia_. But, alas, the\r\nChildren and Servants of those old Planters must needs afford many,\r\ndegenerate Plants, and there is now risen up a Number of People,\r\notherwise inclined than our _Joshua's_, and the Elders that out-liv'd\r\nthem. Those two things our holy Progenitors, and our happy Advantages\r\nmake Omissions of Duty, and such Spiritual Disorders as the whole World\r\nabroad is overwhelmed with, to be as provoking in us, as the most\r\nflagitious Wickednesses committed in other places; and the Ministers of\r\nGod are accordingly severe in their Testimonies: But in short, those\r\nInterests of the Gospel, which were the Errand of our Fathers into these\r\nEnds of the Earth, have been too much neglected and postponed, and the\r\nAttainments of an handsome Education, have been too much undervalued, by\r\nMultitudes that have not fallen into Exorbitances of Wickedness; and\r\nsome, especially of our young Ones, when they have got abroad from under\r\nthe Restraints here laid upon them, have become extravagantly and\r\nabominably Vicious. Hence 'tis, that the Happiness of _New-England_ has\r\nbeen but for a time, as it was foretold, and not for a long time, as has\r\nbeen desir'd for us. A Variety of Calamity has long follow'd this\r\nPlantation; and we have all the Reason imaginable to ascribe it unto the\r\nRebuke of Heaven upon us for our manifold _Apostasies_; we make no\r\nright use of our Disasters: If we do not, _Remember whence we are\r\nfallen, and repent, and do the first Works._ But yet our Afflictions may\r\ncome under a further Consideration with us: There is a further Cause of\r\nour Afflictions, whose due must be given him.\r\n\r\n\r\nS. II. The _New-Englanders_ are a People of God settled in those, which\r\nwere once the _Devil's_ Territories; and it may easily be supposed that\r\nthe _Devil_ was exceedingly disturbed, when he perceived such a People\r\nhere accomplishing the Promise of old made unto our Blessed Jesus, _That\r\nHe should have the Utmost parts of the Earth for his Possession._ There\r\nwas not a greater Uproar among the _Ephesians_, when the Gospel was\r\nfirst brought among them, than there was among, _The Powers of the Air_\r\n(after whom those _Ephesians_ walked) when first the _Silver Trumpets_\r\nof the Gospel here made the _Joyful Sound_. The Devil thus Irritated,\r\nimmediately try'd all sorts of Methods to overturn this poor Plantation:\r\nand so much of the Church, as was _Fled into this Wilderness_,\r\nimmediately found, _The Serpent cast out of his Mouth a Flood for the\r\ncarrying of it away._ I believe, that never were more _Satanical\r\nDevices_ used for the Unsetling of any People under the Sun, than what\r\nhave been Employ'd for the Extirpation of the _Vine_ which God has here\r\n_Planted_, _Casting out the Heathen, and preparing a Room before it, and\r\ncausing it to take deep Root, and fill the Land, so that it sent its\r\nBoughs unto the +Atlantic+ Sea +Eastward+, and its Branches unto the\r\n+Connecticut+ River +Westward+, and the Hills were covered with the\r\nshadow thereof._ But, All those Attempts of Hell, have hitherto been\r\nAbortive, many an _Ebenezer_ has been Erected unto the Praise of God, by\r\nhis Poor People here; and, _Having obtained Help from God, we continue\r\nto this Day._ Wherefore the Devil is now making one Attempt more upon\r\nus; an Attempt more Difficult, more Surprizing, more snarl'd with\r\nunintelligible Circumstances than any that we have hitherto Encountred;\r\nan Attempt so _Critical_, that if we get well through, we shall soon\r\nEnjoy _Halcyon_ Days with all the _Vultures_ of Hell _Trodden under our\r\nFeet_. He has wanted his _Incarnate Legions_ to Persecute us, as the\r\nPeople of God have in the other Hemisphere been Persecuted: he has\r\ntherefore drawn forth his more _Spiritual_ ones to make an Attacque upon\r\nus. We have been advised by some Credible Christians yet alive, that a\r\nMalefactor, accused of _Witchcraft_ as well as _Murder_, and Executed in\r\nthis place more than Forty Years ago, did then give Notice of, _An\r\nHorrible PLOT against the Country by WITCHCRAFT, and a Foundation of\r\nWITCHCRAFT then laid, which if it were not seasonally discovered, would\r\nprobably Blow up, and pull down all the Churches in the Country._ And we\r\nhave now with Horror seen the _Discovery_ of such a _Witchcraft_! An\r\nArmy of _Devils_ is horribly broke in upon the place which is the\r\n_Center_, and after a sort, the _First-born_ of our _English_\r\nSettlements: and the Houses of the Good People there are fill'd with the\r\ndoleful Shrieks of their Children and Servants, Tormented by Invisible\r\nHands, with Tortures altogether preternatural. After the Mischiefs there\r\nEndeavoured, and since in part Conquered, the terrible Plague, of _Evil\r\nAngels_, hath made its Progress into some other places, where other\r\nPersons have been in like manner Diabolically handled. These our poor\r\nAfflicted Neighbours, quickly after they become _Infected_ and\r\n_Infested_ with these _Daemons_, arrive to a Capacity of Discerning those\r\nwhich they conceive the _Shapes_ of their Troublers; and notwithstanding\r\nthe Great and Just Suspicion, that the _Daemons_ might Impose the\r\n_Shapes_ of Innocent Persons in their _Spectral Exhibitions_ upon the\r\nSufferers, (which may perhaps prove no small part of the _Witch-Plot_ in\r\nthe issue) yet many of the Persons thus Represented, being Examined,\r\nseveral of them have been Convicted of a very Damnable _Witchcraft_:\r\nyea, more than One _Twenty_ have _Confessed_, that they have Signed unto\r\na _Book_, which the Devil show'd them, and Engaged in his Hellish Design\r\nof _Bewitching_, and _Ruining_ our Land. _We_ know not, at least _I_\r\nknow not, how far the _Delusions_ of Satan may be Interwoven into some\r\nCircumstances of the _Confessions_; but one would think, all the Rules\r\nof Understanding Humane Affairs are at an end, if after so many most\r\nVoluntary Harmonious _Confessions_, made by Intelligent Persons of all\r\nAges, in sundry Towns, at several Times, we must not Believe the _main\r\nstrokes_ wherein those _Confessions_ all agree: especially when we have\r\na thousand preternatural Things every day before our eyes, wherein the\r\n_Confessors_ do acknowledge their Concernment, and give Demonstration of\r\ntheir being so Concerned. If the Devils now can strike the minds of men\r\nwith any _Poisons_ of so fine a Composition and Operation, that Scores\r\nof Innocent People shall Unite, in _Confessions_ of a Crime, which we\r\nsee actually committed, it is a thing prodigious, beyond the Wonders of\r\nthe former Ages, and it threatens no less than a sort of a Dissolution\r\nupon the World. Now, by these _Confessions_ 'tis Agreed, _That_ the\r\nDevil has made a dreadful Knot of _Witches_ in the Country, and by the\r\nhelp of _Witches_ has dreadfully increased that Knot: _That_ these\r\n_Witches_ have driven a Trade of Commissioning their _Confederate\r\nSpirits_, to do all sorts of Mischiefs to the Neighbours, whereupon\r\nthere have ensued such Mischievous consequences upon the Bodies and\r\nEstates of the Neighbourhood, as could not otherwise be accounted for:\r\nyea, _That_ at prodigious _Witch-Meetings_, the Wretches have proceeded\r\nso far, as to Concert and Consult the Methods of Rooting out the\r\nChristian Religion from this Country, and setting up instead of it,\r\nperhaps a more gross _Diabolesm_, than ever the World saw before. And\r\nyet it will be a thing little short of _Miracle_, if in so _spread_ a\r\nBusiness as this, the Devil should not get in some of his Juggles, to\r\nconfound the Discovery of all the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nS. III. Doubtless, the Thoughts of many will receive a great Scandal\r\nagainst _New-England_, from the Number of Persons that have been\r\nAccused, or Suspected, for _Witchcraft_, in this Country: But it were\r\neasie to offer many things, that may Answer and Abate the Scandal. If\r\nthe Holy God should any where permit the Devils to hook two or three\r\nwicked _Scholars_ into _Witchcraft_, and then by their Assistance to\r\nRange with their _Poisonous Insinuations_ among Ignorant, Envious,\r\nDiscontented People, till they have cunningly decoy'd them into some\r\nsudden _Act_, whereby the Toyls of Hell shall be perhaps inextricably\r\ncast over them: what Country in the World would not afford _Witches_,\r\nnumerous to a Prodigy? Accordingly, The Kingdoms of _Sweden_, _Denmark_,\r\n_Scotland_, yea and _England_ it self, as well as the Province of\r\n_New-England_, have had their Storms of _Witchcrafts_ breaking upon\r\nthem, which have made most Lamentable Devastations: which also I wish,\r\nmay be _The Last_. And it is not uneasie to be imagined, That God has\r\nnot brought out all the _Witchcrafts_ in many other Lands with such a\r\nspeedy, dreadful, destroying _Jealousie_, as burns forth upon such _High\r\nTreasons_, committed here in _A Land of Uprightness_: Transgressors may\r\nmore quickly here than elsewhere become a Prey to the Vengeance of Him,\r\n_Who has Eyes like a Flame of Fire_, and, _who walks in the midst of the\r\nGolden Candlesticks_. Moreover, There are many parts of the World, who\r\nif they do upon this Occasion insult over this People of God, need only\r\nto be told the Story of what happen'd at _Loim_, in the Dutchy of\r\n_Gulic_, where a Popish Curate having ineffectually try'd many Charms to\r\nEject the Devil out of a Damsel there possessed, he passionately bid the\r\nDevil come out of her into himself; but the Devil answered him, _Quid\r\nmihi Opus, est eum tentare, quem Novissimo die, Jure Optimo, sum\r\npossessurus?_ That is, _What need I meddle with one whom I am sure to\r\nhave, and hold at the Last-day as my own for ever!_\r\n\r\nBut besides all this, give me leave to add, it is to be hoped, That\r\namong the Persons represented by the _Spectres_ which now afflict our\r\nNeighbours, there will be found _some_ that never explicitly contracted\r\nwith any of the _Evil Angels_. The Witches have not only intimated, but\r\nsome of them acknowledged, That they have plotted the Representations\r\nof _Innocent Persons_, to cover and shelter themselves in their\r\nWitchcrafts; now, altho' our good God has hitherto generally preserved\r\nus from the Abuse therein design'd by the Devils for us, yet who of us\r\ncan exactly state, _How far our God may for our Chastisement permit the\r\nDevil to proceed in such an Abuse?_ It was the Result of a Discourse,\r\nlately held at a Meeting of some very Pious and Learned Ministers among\r\nus, _That the Devils may sometimes have a permission to Represent an\r\nInnocent Person, as Tormenting such as are under Diabolical\r\nMolestations: But that such things are Rare and Extraordinary;\r\nespecially when such matters come before Civil Judicature._ The Opinion\r\nexpressed with so much Caution and Judgment, seems to be the prevailing\r\nSense of many others, who are men Eminently Cautious and Judicious; and\r\nhave both _Argument_ and _History_ to Countenance them in it. It is\r\n_Rare and Extraordinary_, for an Honest _Naboth_ to have his Life it\r\nself Sworn away by two _Children of Belial_, and yet no Infringement\r\nhereby made on the Rectoral Righteousness of our Eternal Soveraign,\r\nwhose _Judgments are a Great Deep_, and who _gives none Account of His\r\nmatters_. Thus, although the Appearance of Innocent Persons in _Spectral\r\nExhibitions_ afflicting the Neighbour-hood, be a thing _Rare and\r\nExtraordinary_; yet who can be sure, that the great _Belial_ of Hell\r\nmust needs be always _Yoked_ up from this piece of Mischief? The best\r\nman that ever lived has been called a _Witch_: and why may not this too\r\nusual and unhappy Symptom of A _Witch_, even a Spectral Representation,\r\nbefall a person that shall be none of the worst? Is it not possible? The\r\n_Laplanders_ will tell us 'tis possible: for Persons to be unwittingly\r\nattended with officious _Daemons_, bequeathed unto them, and impos'd upon\r\nthem, by Relations that have been _Witches_. _Quaery_, also, Whether at a\r\nTime, when the Devil with his Witches are engag'd in a War upon a\r\npeople, some certain steps of ours, in such a War, may not be follow'd\r\nwith our appearing so and so for a while among them in the Visions of\r\nour afflicted _Forlorns_! And, Who can certainly say, what other Degrees\r\nor Methods of sinning, besides that of a _Diabolical Compact_, may give\r\nthe Devils advantage to act in the Shape of them that have miscarried?\r\nBesides what may happen for a while, to try the _Patience_ of the\r\nVertuous. May not some that have been ready upon feeble grounds\r\nuncharitably to Censure and Reproach other people, be punished for it by\r\n_Spectres_ for a while exposing them to Censure and Reproach? And\r\nfurthermore, I pray, that it may be considered, Whether a World of\r\nMagical Tricks often used in the World, may not insensibly oblige\r\n_Devils_ to wait upon the Superstitious Users of them. A Witty Writer\r\nagainst _Sadducism_ has this Observation, That persons who never made\r\nany express Contract with _Apostate Spirits_, yet may Act strange Things\r\nby _Diabolick Aids_, which they procure by the use of those wicked\r\n_Forms_ and _Arts_, that the Devil first imparted unto his Confederates.\r\nAnd he adds, _We know not but the Laws of the Dark Kingdom may Enjoyn a\r\nparticular Attendance upon all those that practice their Mysteries,\r\nwhether they know them to be theirs or no._ Some of them that have been\r\ncry'd out upon as imploying _Evil Spirits_ to hurt our Land, have been\r\nknown to be most bloody _Fortune-Tellers_; and some of them have\r\nconfessed, That when they told _Fortunes_, they would pretend the Rules\r\nof _Chiromancy_ and the like Ignorant Sciences, but indeed they had no\r\nRule (they said) but this, _The things were then Darted into their\r\nminds._ _Darted!_ Ye Wretches; By whom, I pray? Surely by none but the\r\n_Devils_; who, tho' perhaps they did not exactly _Foreknow_ all the thus\r\nPredicted Contingencies; yet having once _Foretold_ them, they stood\r\nbound in Honour now to use their Interest, which alas, in _This World_,\r\nis very great, for the Accomplishment of their own Predictions. There\r\nare others, that have used most wicked _Sorceries_ to gratifie their\r\nunlawful Curiosities, or to prevent Inconveniencies in Man and Beast;\r\n_Sorceries_, which I will not _Name_, lest I should by Naming, _Teach_\r\nthem. Now, some _Devil_ is evermore Invited into the Service of the\r\nPerson that shall Practise these _Witchcrafts_; and if they have gone on\r\nImpenitently in these Communions with any _Devil_, the _Devil_ may\r\nperhaps become at last a _Familiar_ to them, and so assume their\r\n_Livery_, that they cannot shake him off in any way, but that One, which\r\nI would most heartily prescribe unto them, Namely, That of a deep and\r\nlong _Repentance_. Should these _Impieties_ have been committed in such\r\na place as _New-England_, for my part I should not wonder, if when\r\n_Devils_ are Exposing the _Grosser_ Witches among us, God permit them to\r\nbring in these _Lesser_ ones with the rest for their perpetual\r\nHumiliation. In the Issue therefore, may it not be found, that\r\n_New-England_ is not so stock'd with _Rattle Snakes_, as was imagined.\r\n\r\n\r\nS. IV. But I do not believe, that the progress of _Witchcraft_ among\r\nus, is all the Plot which the Devil is managing in the _Witchcraft_ now\r\nupon us. It is judged, That the Devil rais'd the Storm, whereof we read\r\nin the Eighth Chapter of _Matthew_, on purpose to over-set the little\r\nVessel wherein the Disciples of Our Lord were Embarqued with Him. And it\r\nmay be fear'd, that in the _Horrible Tempest_ which is now upon\r\nourselves, the design of the Devil is to sink that Happy Settlement of\r\nGovernment, wherewith Almighty God has graciously enclined Their\r\nMajesties to favour us. We are blessed with a GOVERNOUR, than whom no\r\nman can be more willing to serve Their Majesties, or this their\r\nProvince: He is continually venturing his _All_ to do it: and were not\r\nthe Interests of his Prince dearer to him than his own, he could not but\r\nsoon be weary of the _Helm_, whereat he sits. We are under the Influence\r\nof a LIEUTENANT GOVERNOUR, who not only by being admirably accomplished\r\nboth with Natural and Acquired Endowments, is fitted for the Service of\r\nTheir Majesties, but also with an unspotted Fidelity applies himself to\r\nthat Service. Our COUNCELLOURS are some of our most Eminent Persons, and\r\nas Loyal Subjects to the Crown, as hearty lovers of their Country. Our\r\nConstitution also is attended with singular Priviledges; All which\r\nThings are by the Devil exceedingly _Envy'd_ unto us; And the Devil will\r\ndoubtless take this occasion for the raising of such complaints and\r\nclamours, as may be of pernicious consequence unto some part of our\r\npresent Settlement, if he can so far _Impose_. But that which most of all\r\nThreatens us, in our present Circumstances, is the _Misunderstanding_,\r\nand so the _Animosity_, whereinto the _Witchcraft_ now Raging, has\r\nEnchanted us. The Embroiling, first, of our _Spirits_, and then of our\r\n_Affairs_, is evidently as considerable a Branch of the Hellish Intrigue\r\nwhich now vexes us as any one Thing whatsoever. The Devil has made us\r\nlike a _Troubled Sea_, and the _Mire_ and _Mud_ begins now also to\r\nheave up apace. Even Good and Wise Men suffer themselves to fall into\r\ntheir _Paroxysms_; and the Shake which the Devil is now giving us,\r\nfetches up the _Dirt_ which before lay still at the bottom of our\r\nsinful Hearts. If we allow the Mad Dogs of Hell to poyson us by biting\r\nus, we shall imagine that we see nothing but such things about us, and\r\nlike such things fly upon all that we see. Were it not for what is IN\r\nUS, for my part, I should not fear a thousand Legions of Devils: 'tis by\r\nour Quarrels that we spoil our Prayers; and if our humble, zealous, and\r\nunited Prayers are once hindred: Alas, the _Philistines_ of Hell have\r\ncut our Locks for us; they will then blind us, mock us, ruine us: In\r\ntruth, I cannot altogether blame it, if People are a little transported,\r\nwhen they conceive all the secular Interests of themselves and their\r\nFamilies at the Stake; and yet at the sight of these Heartburnings, I\r\ncannot forbear the Exclamation of the Sweet-spirited _Austin_, in his\r\nPacificatory Epistle to _Jerom_, on the Contest with _Ruffin_, _O misera\r\n& miseranda Conditio!_ O Condition, truly miserable! But what shall be\r\ndone to cure these Distractions? It is wonderfully necessary, that some\r\nhealing Attempts be made at this time: And I must needs confess (if I\r\nmay speak so much) like a _Nazianzen_, I am so desirous of a share in\r\nthem, that if, being thrown overboard, were needful to allay the\r\n_Storm_, I should think Dying, a Trifle to be undergone, for so great a\r\nBlessedness.\r\n\r\n\r\nS. V. I would most importunately in the first place, entreat every Man\r\nto maintain an holy Jealousie over his Soul at this time, and think; May\r\nnot the Devil make me, though ignorantly and unwillingly, to be an\r\nInstrument of doing something that he would have to be done? For my\r\npart, I freely own my Suspicion, lest something of Enchantment, have\r\nreach'd more Persons and Spirits among us, than we are well aware of.\r\nBut then, let us more generally agree to maintain a kind Opinion one of\r\nanother. That Charity without which, even our giving our Bodies to be\r\nburned would profit nothing, uses to proceed by this Rule; It is kind,\r\nit is not easily provok'd, it thinks no Evil, it believes all things,\r\nhopes all things. But if we disregard this Rule of Charity, we shall\r\nindeed give our Body Politick to be burned. I have heard it affirmed,\r\nThat in the late great Flood upon _Connecticut_, those Creatures which\r\ncould not but have quarrelled at another time, yet now being driven\r\ntogether very agreeably stood by one another. I am sure we shall be\r\nworse than _Brutes_ if we fly upon one another at a time when the Floods\r\nof Belial make us afraid. On the one side; [Alas, my Pen, must thou\r\nwrite the word, _Side_ in the Business?] There are very worthy Men, who\r\nhaving been call'd by God, when and where this Witchcraft first appeared\r\nupon the Stage to encounter it, are earnestly desirous to have it sifted\r\nunto the bottom of it. And I pray, which of us all that should live\r\nunder the continual Impressions of the Tortures, Outcries, and Havocks\r\nwhich Devils confessedly Commissioned by Witches make among their\r\ndistressed Neighbours, would not have a Biass that way beyond other Men?\r\nPersons this way disposed have been Men eminent for Wisdom and Vertue,\r\nand Men acted by a noble Principle of Conscience: Had not Conscience (of\r\nDuty to God) prevailed above other Considerations with them, they would\r\nnot for all they are worth in the World have medled in this Thorny\r\nbusiness. Have there been any disputed Methods used in discovering the\r\nWorks of Darkness? It may be none but what have had great Presedents in\r\nother parts of the World; which may, though not altogether justifie, yet\r\nmuch alleviate a Mistake in us if there should happen to be found any\r\nsuch mistake in so dark a Matter. They have done what they have done,\r\nwith multiplied Addresses to God for his Guidance, and have not been\r\ninsensible how much they have exposed themselves in what they have done.\r\nYea, they would gladly contrive and receive an expedient, how the\r\nshedding of Blood, might be spared, by the Recovery of Witches, not gone\r\nbeyond the Reach of Pardon. And after all, they invite all good Men, in\r\nTerms to this purpose, 'Being amazed at the Number and Quality of those\r\naccused of late, we do not know but Satan by his Wiles may have\r\nenwrapped some innocent Persons; and therefore should earnestly and\r\nhumbly desire the most Critical Enquiry upon the place, to find out the\r\nFalacy; that there may be none of the Servants of the Lord, with the\r\nWorshippers of _Baal_.' I may also add, That whereas, if once a Witch do\r\ningeniously confess among us, no more _Spectres_ do in their Shapes\r\nafter this, trouble the Vicinage; if any guilty Creatures will\r\naccordingly to so good purpose confess their Crime to any Minister of\r\nGod, and get out of the Snare of the Devil, as no Minister will discover\r\nsuch a Conscientious Confession, so I believe none in the Authority\r\nwill press him to discover it; but rejoyc'd in a Soul sav'd from Death.\r\nOn the other side [if I must again use the word _Side_, which yet I hope\r\nto live to blot out] there are very worthy Men, who are not a little\r\ndissatisfied at the Proceedings in the Prosecution of this Witchcraft.\r\nAnd why? Not because they would have any such abominable thing, defended\r\nfrom the Strokes of Impartial Justice. No, those Reverend Persons who\r\ngave in this Advice unto the Honourable Council; 'That Presumptions,\r\nwhereupon Persons may be Committed, and much more Convictions, whereupon\r\nPersons may be Condemned, as guilty of Witchcrafts, ought certainly to\r\nbe more considerable, than barely the Accused Persons being represented\r\nby a _Spectre_ unto the Afflicted; Nor are Alterations made in the\r\nSufferers, by a Look or Touch of the Accused, to be esteemed an\r\ninfallible Evidence of Guilt; but frequently liable to be abused by the\r\nDevils Legerdemains': I say, those very Men of God most conscientiously\r\nSubjoined this Article to that Advice,--'Nevertheless we cannot but\r\nhumbly recommend unto the Government, the speedy and vigorous\r\nProsecution of such as have rendred themselves Obnoxious; according to\r\nthe best Directions given in the Laws of God, and the wholsome Statutes\r\nof the _English_ Nation for the Detection of Witchcraft.' Only 'tis a\r\nmost commendable Cautiousness, in those gracious Men, to be very shye\r\nlest the Devil get so far into our Faith, as that for the sake of many\r\nTruths which we find he tells us, we come at length to believe any Lyes,\r\nwherewith he may abuse us: whereupon, what a Desolation of Names would\r\nsoon ensue, besides a thousand other pernicious Consequences? and lest\r\nthere should be any such Principles taken up, as when put into Practice\r\nmust unavoidably cause the _Righteous to perish with the Wicked_; or\r\nprocure the Bloodshed of any Persons, like the _Gibeonites_, whom some\r\nlearned Men suppose to be under a false Notion of Witches, by _Saul_\r\nexterminated.\r\n\r\nThey would have all due steps taken for the Extinction of Witches; but\r\nthey would fain have them to be sure ones; nor is it from any thing, but\r\nthe real and hearty goodness of such Men, that they are loth to surmise\r\nill of other Men, till there be the fullest Evidence for the surmises.\r\nAs for the Honourable Judges that have been hitherto in the Commission,\r\nthey are above my Consideration: wherefore I will only say thus much of\r\nthem, That such of them as I have the Honour of a Personal Acquaintance\r\nwith, are Men of an excellent Spirit; and as at first they went about\r\nthe work for which they were Commission'd, with a very great aversion,\r\nso they have still been under Heart-breaking Sollicitudes, how they\r\nmight therein best serve both God and Man? In fine, Have there been\r\nfaults on any side fallen into? Surely, they have at worst been but the\r\nfaults of a well-meaning Ignorance. On every side then, why should not\r\nwe endeavour with amicable Correspondencies, to help one another out of\r\nthe Snares wherein the Devil would involve us? To wrangle the Devil out\r\nof the Country, will be truly a New Experiment: Alas! we are not aware\r\nof the Devil, if we do not think, that he aims at inflaming us one\r\nagainst another; and shall we suffer our selves to be Devil-ridden? or\r\nby any unadvisableness contribute unto the Widening of our Breaches?\r\n\r\nTo say no more, there is a published and credible Relation; which\r\naffirms, That very lately in a part of _England_, where some of the\r\nNeighbourhood were quarrelling, a _Raven_ from the Top of a Tree very\r\narticulately and unaccountably cry'd out, _Read the Third of Colossians\r\nand the Fifteenth!_ Were I my self to chuse what sort of Bird I would be\r\ntransformed into, I would say, _O that I had wings like a Dove!_\r\nNevertheless, I will for once do the Office, which as it seems, Heaven\r\nsent that Raven upon; even to beg, _That the Peace of God may Rule in\r\nour Hearts._\r\n\r\n\r\nS. VI. 'Tis necessary that we unite in every thing: but there are\r\nespecially two Things wherein our Union must carry us along together. We\r\nare to unite in our Endeavours to deliver our distressed Neighbours,\r\nfrom the horrible Annoyances and Molestations with which a dreadful\r\nWitchcraft is now persecuting of them. To have an hand in any thing,\r\nthat may stifle or obstruct a Regular Detection of that Witchcraft, is\r\nwhat we may well with an holy fear avoid. Their Majesties good Subjects\r\nmust not every day be torn to pieces by horrid Witches, and those bloody\r\nFelons, be left wholly unprosecuted. The Witchcraft is a business that\r\nwill not be sham'd, without plunging us into sore Plagues, and of long\r\ncontinuance. But then we are to unite in such Methods for this\r\ndeliverance, as may be unquestionably safe, lest _the latter end be\r\nworse than the beginning_. And here, what shall I say? I will venture to\r\nsay thus much, That we are safe, when we make just as much use of all\r\nAdvice from the invisible World, as God sends it for. It is a safe\r\nPrinciple, That when God Almighty permits any Spirits from the unseen\r\nRegions, to visit us with surprizing Informations, there is then\r\nsomething to be enquired after; we are then to enquire of one another,\r\nWhat Cause there is for such things? The peculiar Government of God,\r\nover the unbodied Intelligences, is a sufficient Foundation for this\r\nPrinciple. When there has been a Murder committed, an Apparition of the\r\nslain Party accusing of any Man, altho' such Apparitions have oftner\r\nspoke true than false, is not enough to Convict the Man as guilty of\r\nthat Murder; but yet it is a sufficient occasion for Magistrates to make\r\na particular Enquiry, whether such a Man have afforded any ground for\r\nsuch an Accusation. Even so a Spectre exactly resembling such or such a\r\nPerson, when the Neighbourhood are tormented by such Spectres, may\r\nreasonably make Magistrates inquisitive whether the Person so\r\nrepresented have done or said any thing that may argue their confederacy\r\nwith Evil Spirits, altho' it may be defective enough in point of\r\nConviction; especially at a time, when 'tis possible, some over-powerful\r\nConjurer may have got the skill of thus exhibiting the Shapes of all\r\nsorts of Persons, on purpose to stop the Prosecution of the Wretches,\r\nwhom due Enquiries thus provoked, might have made obnoxious unto\r\nJustice.\r\n\r\n_Quaere_, Whether if God would have us to proceed any further than bare\r\n_Enquiry_, upon what Reports there may come against any Man, from the\r\nWorld of _Spirits_, he will not by his Providence at the same time have\r\nbrought into our hands, these more evident and sensible things,\r\nwhereupon a man is to be esteemed a Criminal. But I will venture to say\r\nthis further, that it will be safe to account the Names as well as the\r\nLives of our Neighbors; two considerable things to be brought under a\r\nJudicial Process, until it be found by Humane Observations that the\r\nPeace of Mankind is thereby disturbed. We are Humane Creatures, and we\r\nare safe while we say, they must be Humane Witnesses, who also have in\r\nthe particular Act of Seeing, or Hearing, which enables them to be\r\nWitnesses, had no more than Humane Assistances, that are to turn the\r\nScale when Laws are to be executed. And upon this Head I will further\r\nadd: A wise and a just Magistrate, may so far give way to a common\r\nStream of Dissatisfaction, as to forbear acting up to the heighth of his\r\nown Perswasion, about what may be judged convictive of a Crime, whose\r\nNature shall be so abstruse and obscure, as to raise much Disputation.\r\nTho' he may not do what he should leave undone, yet he may leave undone\r\nsomething that else he could do, when the Publick Safety makes an\r\n_Exigency_.\r\n\r\n\r\nS. VII. I was going to make one Venture more; that is, to offer some\r\nsafe Rules, for the finding out of the Witches, which are at this day\r\nour accursed Troublers: but this were a Venture too _Presumptuous_ and\r\n_Icarian_ for me to make; I leave that unto those Excellent and\r\nJudicious Persons, with whom I am not worthy to be numbred: All that I\r\nshall do, shall be to lay before my Readers, a brief _Synopsis_ of what\r\nhas been written on that Subject, by a Triumvirate of as Eminent Persons\r\nas have ever handled it. I will begin with,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ABSTRACT OF MR. PERKINS'S WAY FOR\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERY OF WITCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _There are +Presumptions+, which do at least probably and\r\nconjecturally note one to be a +Witch+. These give occasion to Examine,\r\nyet they are no sufficient Causes of Conviction._\r\n\r\nII. _If any Man or Woman be notoriously defamed for a +Witch+, this\r\nyields a strong Suspition. Yet the Judge ought carefully to look, that\r\nthe Report be made by +Men+ of Honesty and Credit._\r\n\r\nIII. _If a +Fellow-Witch+, or +Magician+, give Testimony of any Person\r\nto be a +Witch+; this indeed is not sufficient for Condemnation; but it\r\nis a fit Presumption to cause a strait Examination._\r\n\r\nIV. _If after Cursing there follow Death, or at least some mischief:\r\nfor +Witches+ are wont to practise their mischievous Facts, by Cursing\r\nand Banning: This also is a sufficient matter of Examination, tho' not\r\nof Conviction._\r\n\r\nV. _If after Enmity, Quarrelling, or Threatning, a present mischief does\r\nfollow; that also is a great Presumption._\r\n\r\nVI. _If the Party suspected be the Son or Daughter, the man-servant or\r\nmaid-servant, the Familiar Friend, near Neighbor, or old Companion, of a\r\nknown and convicted Witch; this may be likewise a Presumption; for\r\nWitchcraft is an Art that may be learned, and conveyed from man to\r\nman._\r\n\r\nVII. _Some add this for a Presumption: If the Party suspected be found\r\nto have the Devil's mark; for it is commonly thought, when the Devil\r\nmakes his Covenant with them, he alwaies leaves his mark behind them,\r\nwhereby he knows them for his own:--a mark whereof no evident Reason in\r\nNature can be given._\r\n\r\nVIII. _Lastly, If the party examined be Unconstant, or contrary to\r\nhimself, in his deliberate Answers, it argueth a Guilty Conscience,\r\nwhich stops the freedom of Utterance. And yet there are causes of\r\nAstonishment, which may befal the Good, as well as the Bad._\r\n\r\nIX. _But then there is a +Conviction+, discovering the +Witch+, which\r\nmust proceed from just and sufficient proofs, and not from bare\r\npresumptions._\r\n\r\nX. _Scratching of the suspected party, and Recovery thereupon, with\r\nseveral other such weak Proofs; as also, the fleeting of the suspected\r\nParty, thrown upon the Water; these Proofs are so far from being\r\nsufficient, that some of them are, after a sort, practices of\r\nWitchcraft._\r\n\r\nXI. _The Testimony of some Wizzard, tho' offering to shew the Witches\r\nFace in a Glass: This, I grant, may be a good Presumption, to cause a\r\nstrait Examination; but a sufficient Proof of Conviction it cannot be.\r\nIf the Devil tell the Grand Jury, that the person in question is a\r\nWitch, and offers withal to confirm the same by Oath, should the Inquest\r\nreceive his Oath or Accusation to condemn the man? Assuredly no. And\r\nyet, that is as much as the Testimony of another Wizzard, who only by\r\nthe Devil's help reveals the Witch._\r\n\r\nXII. _If a man, being dangerously sick, and like to dye, upon\r\nSuspicion, will take it on his Death, that such a one hath bewitched\r\nhim, it is an Allegation of the same nature, which may move the Judge to\r\nexamine the Party, but it is of no moment for Conviction._\r\n\r\nXIII. _Among the sufficient means of Conviction, the first is, the free\r\nand voluntary Confession of the Crime, made by the party suspected and\r\naccused, after Examination. I say not, that a bare confession is\r\nsufficient, but a Confession after due Examination, taken upon pregnant\r\npresumptions. What needs now more witness or further Enquiry?_\r\n\r\nXIV. _There is a second sufficient Conviction, by the Testimony of two\r\nWitnesses, of good and honest Report, avouching before the Magistrate,\r\nupon their own Knowledge, these two things: either that the party\r\naccused hath made a League with the Devil, or hath done some known\r\npractice of witchcraft. And, +all Arguments that do necessarily prove\r\neither of these+, being brought by two sufficient Witnesses, are of\r\nforce fully to convince the party suspected._\r\n\r\nXV. _If it can be proved, that the party suspected hath called upon the\r\n+Devil+, or desired his Help, this is a pregnant proof of a League\r\nformerly made between them._\r\n\r\nXVI. _If it can be proved, that the party hath entertained a Familiar\r\nSpirit, and had Conference with it, in the likeness of some visible\r\nCreatures; here is Evidence of witchcraft._\r\n\r\nXVII. _If the witnesses affirm upon Oath, that the suspected person hath\r\ndone any action or work which necessarily infers a Covenant made, as,\r\nthat he hath used Enchantments, divined things before they come to pass,\r\nand that peremptorily, raised Tempests, caused the Form of a dead man\r\nto appear; it proveth sufficiently, that he or she is a +Witch+._ This is\r\nthe Substance of Mr. _Perkins_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTake next the Sum of Mr. _Gaules_ Judgment about the Detection of\r\nWitches. '1. Some Tokens for the Trial of Witches, are altogether\r\nunwarrantable. Such are the old Paganish Sign, the Witches _Long Eyes_;\r\nthe Tradition of Witches not weeping; the casting of the Witch into the\r\nWater, with Thumbs and Toes ty'd a-cross. And many more such Marks,\r\nwhich if they are to know a Witch by, certainly 'tis no other Witch, but\r\nthe User of them. 2. There are some Tokens for the Trial of Witches,\r\nmore probable, and yet not so certain as to afford Conviction. Such are\r\nstrong and long Suspicion: Suspected Ancestors, some appearance of Fact,\r\nthe Corps bleeding upon the Witches touch, the Testimony of the Party\r\nbewitched, the supposed Witches unusual Bodily marks, the Witches usual\r\nCursing and Banning, the Witches lewd and naughty kind of Life. 3. Some\r\nSigns there are of a Witch, more certain and infallible. As, _firstly_,\r\nDeclining of Judicature, or faultering, faulty, unconstant, and contrary\r\nAnswers, upon judicial and deliberate examination. _Secondly_, When upon\r\ndue Enquiry into a person's Faith and Manners, there are found _all_ or\r\n_most_ of the Causes which produce Witchcraft, namely, _God_ forsaking,\r\n_Satan_ invading, particular _Sins_ disposing; and lastly, a compact\r\ncompleating all. _Thirdly_, The Witches free Confession, together with\r\nfull Evidence of the Fact. _Confession_ without _Fact_ may be a meer\r\nDelusion, and _Fact_ without _Confession_ may be a meer Accident.\r\n_4thly_, The semblable Gestures and Actions of suspected Witches, with\r\nthe comparable Expressions of Affections, which in all Witches have been\r\nobserv'd and found very much alike. _Fifthly_, The Testimony of the\r\nParty bewitched, whether pining or dying, together with the joynt Oaths\r\nof sufficient persons, that have seen certain prodigious Pranks or\r\nFeats, wrought by the Party accused. 4. Among the most unhappy\r\ncircumstances to convict a Witch, one is, a maligning and oppugning the\r\nWord, Work, and Worship of God, and by any extraordinary sign seeking to\r\nseduce any from it. See _Deut. 13.1, 2._, _Mat. 24.24._, _Act. 13.8, 10._,\r\n_2 Tim. 3.8._ Do but mark well the places, and for this very Property\r\n(of thus opposing and perverting) they are all there concluded arrant\r\nand absolute Witches. 5. It is not requisite, that so _palpable Evidence\r\nof Conviction_ should here come in, as in other more sensible matters;\r\n'tis enough, if there be but so much _circumstantial_ Proof or Evidence,\r\nas the Substance, Matter, and Nature of such an abstruse Mystery of\r\nIniquity will well admit. [_I suppose he means, that whereas in other\r\nCrimes we look for more direct proofs, in this there is a greater use of\r\nconsequential ones._] But I could heartily wish, that the Juries were\r\nempanell'd of the most eminent Physicians, Lawyers, and Divines that a\r\nCountry could afford. In the mean time 'tis not to be called a\r\nToleration, if Witches escape, where Conviction is wanting.' To this\r\npurpose our _Gaule_.\r\n\r\nI will transcribe a little from one Author more, 'tis the Judicious\r\n_Bernard_ of _Batcomb_, who in his _Guide to grand Jurymen_, after he\r\nhas mention'd several things that are shrewd Presumptions of a Witch,\r\nproceeds to such things as are the _Convictions_ of such an one. And he\r\nsays, '_A witch in league with the +Devil+ is convicted by these\r\nEvidences;_ I. By a witches _Mark_; which is upon the Baser sort of\r\nWitches; and this, by the Devils either Sucking or Touching of them.\r\n_Tertullian_ says, _It is the Devils custome to mark his._ And note,\r\nThat this mark is _Insensible_, and being prick'd it will not Bleed.\r\nSometimes, its like a _Teate_; sometimes but a _Blewish Spot_; sometimes\r\na _Red_ one; and sometimes the _flesh Sunk_: but the Witches do\r\nsometimes cover them. II. By the Witches _Words_. As when they have been\r\nheard calling on, speaking to, or Talking of their _Familiars_; or, when\r\nthey have been heard _Telling_ of _Hurt_ they have done to man or beast:\r\nOr when they have been heard _Threatning_ of such Hurt; Or if they have\r\nbeen heard Relating their _Transportations_. III. By the Witches\r\n_Deeds_. As when they have been _seen_ with their Spirits, or seen\r\nsecretly Feeding any of their _Imps_. Or, when there can be found their\r\nPictures, Poppets, and other Hellish Compositions. IV. By the Witches\r\n_Extasies_: With the Delight whereof, Witches are so taken, that they\r\nwill hardly conceal the same: Or, however at some time or other, they\r\nmay be found in them. V. By one or more _Fellow-Witches_, Confessing\r\ntheir own Witchcraft, and bearing Witness against others; if they can\r\nmake good the Truth of their Witness, and give sufficient proof of it.\r\nAs, that they have seen them with their Spirits or, that they have\r\nReceived Spirits from them; or that they can tell, when they used\r\nWitchery-Tricks to Do Harm; or, that they told them what Harm they had\r\ndone; or that they can show the mark upon them; or, that they have been\r\ntogether in their Meetings; and such like. VI. By some _Witness of God_\r\nHimself, happening upon the Execrable Curses of Witches upon themselves,\r\nPraying of God to show some Token, if they be Guilty. VII. By the\r\nWitches own _Confession_, of Giving their Souls to the Devil. It is no\r\nRare thing, for Witches to Confess.'\r\n\r\nThey are Considerable Things, which I have thus Recited; and yet it must\r\nbe with _Open Eyes_, kept upon _Open Rules_, that we are to follow these\r\nthings,\r\n\r\n_S._ 8. But _Juries_ are not the only Instruments to be imploy'd in such\r\na Work; all _Christians_ are to be concerned with daily and fervent\r\n_Prayers_, for the assisting of it. In the Days of _Athanasius_, the\r\nDevils were found unable to stand before, that Prayer, however then used\r\nperhaps with too much of Ceremony, _Let God Arise, Let his Enemies be\r\nScattered. Let them also that Hate Him, flee before Him._\r\n\r\nO that instead of letting our Hearts _Rise_ against one another, our\r\nPrayers might _Rise_ unto an high pitch of Importunity, for such a\r\n_Rising_ of the Lord! Especially, Let them that are _Suffering_ by\r\n_Witchcraft_, be sure to _stay_ and _pray_, and _Beseech the Lord\r\nthrice_, even as much as ever they can, before they complain of any\r\nNeighbour for afflicting them. Let them also that are _accused_ of\r\n_Witchcraft_, set themselves to _Fast_ and _Pray_, and so shake off the\r\n_Daemons_ that would like _Vipers_ fasten upon them; and get the _Waters\r\nof Jealousie_ made profitable to them.\r\n\r\nAnd Now, _O Thou Hope of +New-England+, and the Saviour thereof in the\r\nTime of Trouble; Do thou look mercifully down upon us, & Rescue us, out\r\nof the Trouble which at this time do's threaten to swallow us up. Let\r\nSatan be shortly bruised under our Feet, and Let the Covenanted Vassals\r\nof Satan, which have Traiterously brought him in upon us, be Gloriously\r\nConquered, by thy Powerful and Gracious Presence in the midst of us.\r\nAbhor us not, O God, but cleanse us, but heal us, but save us, for the\r\nsake of thy Glory. Enwrapped in our Salvations. By thy Spirit, Lift up a\r\nstandard against our infernal adversaries, Let us quickly find thee\r\nmaking of us glad, according to the Days wherein we have been afflicted.\r\nAccept of all our Endeavours to glorify thee, in the Fires that are upon\r\nus; and among the rest, Let these my poor and weak essays, composed with\r\nwhat Tears, what Cares, what Prayers, thou +only+ knowest, not want the\r\nAcceptance of the Lord._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DISCOURSE ON THE WONDERS OF\r\n\r\nTHE INVISIBLE WORLD.\r\n\r\n  UTTERED (IN PART) ON AUG. 4, 1692.\r\n\r\n  Ecclesiastical History has Reported it unto us, That a Renowned\r\n    Martyr at the Stake, seeing the Book of the REVELATION thrown\r\n    by his no less Profane than Bloody Persecutors, to be Burn'd in\r\n    the same Fire with himself, he cryed out, _O Beata Apocalypsis;\r\n    quam bene mecum agitur, qui tecum Comburar!_ BLESSED REVELATION!\r\n    said he, _How Blessed am I in this Fire, while I have Thee\r\n    to bear me Company._ As for our selves this Day, 'tis a Fire of sore\r\n    Affliction and Confusion, wherein we are Embroiled; but it is no\r\n    inconsiderable Advantage unto us, that we have the Company of\r\n    this Glorious and Sacred Book the REVELATION to assist us in our\r\n    Exercises. From that Book there is one Text, which I would\r\n    single out at this time to lay before you; 'tis that in\r\n\r\n  REVEL. XII. 12.\r\n\r\n  _Wo to the Inhabitants of the Earth, and of the Sea; for the Devil is\r\n    come down unto you, having great Wrath; because he knoweth, that\r\n    he hath but a short time._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Text is Like the Cloudy and Fiery Pillar, vouchsafed unto _Israel_,\r\nin the Wilderness of old; there is a very _dark side_ of it in the\r\nIntimation, that, _The Devil is come down having great Wrath;_ but it\r\nhas also a _bright side_, when it assures us, that, _He has but a short\r\ntime;_ Unto the Contemplation of _both_, I do this Day Invite you.\r\n\r\nWe have in our Hands a Letter from our Ascended Lord in Heaven, to\r\nAdvise us of his being still alive, and of his Purpose e're long, to\r\ngive us a Visit, wherein we shall see our Living _Redeemer_, _stand at\r\nthe latter day upon the Earth_. 'Tis the last Advice that we have had\r\nfrom Heaven, for now sixteen Hundred years; and the scope of it, is, to\r\nrepresent how the Lord Jesus Christ having begun to set up his Kingdom\r\nin the World, by the preaching of the Gospel, he would from time to time\r\nutterly break to pieces all Powers that should make Head against it,\r\nuntil, _The Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdomes of our Lord,\r\nand of his Christ, and he shall Reign for ever and ever._ 'Tis a\r\nCommentary on what had been written by _Daniel_, about, _The fourth\r\nMonarchy_; with some Touches upon, _The Fifth_; wherein, _The greatness\r\nof the Kingdom under the whole Heaven, shall be given to the people of\r\nthe Saints of the most High:_ And altho' it have, as 'tis expressed by\r\none of the Ancients, _Tot Sacramenta quot verba_, a Mystery in every\r\nSyllable, yet it is not altogether to be neglected with such a Despair,\r\nas that, _I cannot Read, for the Book is Sealed._ It is a REVELATION,\r\nand a singular, and notable _Blessing_ is pronounc'd upon them that\r\nhumbly study it.\r\n\r\nThe Divine Oracles, have with a most admirable Artifice and Carefulness,\r\ndrawn, as the very pious _Beverley_, has laboriously Evinced, an exact\r\nLINE OF TIME, from the first Sabbath at the _Creation_ of the World,\r\nunto the great Sabbatism at the _Restitution_ of all Things. In that\r\nfamous _Line of Time_, from the Decree for the Restoring of _Jerusalem_,\r\nafter the _Babylonish_ Captivity, there seem to remain a matter of _Two\r\nThousand and Three Hundred Years_, unto that _New Jerusalem_, whereto\r\nthe Church is to be advanced, when the Mystical _Babylon_ shall be\r\n_fallen_. At the Resurrection of our Lord, there were seventeen or\r\neighteen Hundred of those Years, yet upon the Line, to run unto, _The\r\nrest which remains for the People of God_; and this Remnant in the _Line\r\nof Time_, is here in our _Apocalypse_, variously Embossed, Adorned, and\r\nSignalized with such Distinguishing Events, if we mind them, will help\r\nus escape that Censure, _Can ye not Discern the Signs of the Times?_\r\n\r\nThe Apostle _John_, for the View of these Things, had laid before him,\r\nas I conceive, a _Book_, with leaves, or folds; which _Volumn_ was\r\nwritten both on the _Backside_, and on the _Inside_, and Roll'd up in a\r\nCylindriacal Form, under seven _Labels_, fastned with so many _Seals_.\r\nThe first _Seal_ being opened, and the first _Label_ removed, under the\r\nfirst _Label_ the Apostle saw what he saw, of a first _Rider_\r\nPourtray'd, and so on, till the last _Seal_ was broken up; each of the\r\nSculptures being enlarged with agreeable _Visions_ and _Voices_, to\r\nillustrate it. The Book being now Unrolled, there were _Trumpets_, with\r\nwonderful Concomitants, Exhibited successively on the Expanding\r\n_Backside_ of it. Whereupon the Book was _Eaten_, as it were to be\r\nHidden, from Interpretations; till afterwards, in the _Inside_ of it,\r\nthe Kingdom of Anti-christ came to be Exposed. Thus, the Judgments of\r\nGod on the _Roman Empire_, first unto the Downfal of _Paganism_, and\r\nthen, unto the Downfal of _Popery_, which is but Revived _Paganism_, are\r\nin these Displayes, with Lively Colours and Features made sensible unto\r\nus.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in the Twelfth Chapter of this Book, we have an August\r\nPreface, to the Description of that Horrid _Kingdom_, which our Lord\r\nChrist refused, but Antichrist accepted, from the Devils Hands; a\r\nKingdom, which for _Twelve Hundred and Sixty_ Years together, was to be\r\na continual oppression upon the People of God, and opposition unto his\r\nInterests; until the Arrival of that Illustrious Day, wherein, _The\r\nKingdom shall be the Lords, and he shall be Governour among the\r\nNations._ The Chapter is (as an Excellent Person calls it) an\r\n_Extravasated Account_ of the Circumstances, which befell the _Primitive\r\nChurch_, during the first Four or Five Hundred Years of Christianity: It\r\nshows us the Face of the Church, first in _Rome_ Heathenish, and then in\r\n_Rome_ Converted, before the _Man of Sin_ was yet come to _Mans Estate_.\r\nOur Text contains the Acclamations made upon the most Glorious\r\nRevolution that ever yet happened upon the Roman Empire; namely, That\r\nwherein the Travailing Church brought forth a Christian Emperour. This\r\nwas a most Eminent _Victory_ over the Devil, and _Resemblance_ of the\r\nState, wherein the World, ere long shall see, _The Kingdom of our God,\r\nand the Power of his Christ_. It is here noted,\r\n\r\nFirst, As a matter of _Triumph_. 'Tis said, _Rejoyce, ye Heavens, and ye\r\nthat dwell in them._ The Saints in both Worlds, took the Comfort of this\r\nRevolution; the Devout Ones that had outlived the late Persecutions,\r\nwere filled with Transporting Joys, when they saw the _Christian_\r\nbecome the _Imperial_ Religion, and when they saw Good Men come to give\r\nLaw unto the rest of Mankind; the Deceased Ones also, whose Blood had\r\nbeen Sacrificed in the Ten Persecutions, doubtless made the Light\r\nRegions to ring with _Hallelujahs_ unto God, when there were brought\r\nunto them, the Tidings of the Advances now given to the _Christian_\r\nReligion, for which they had suffered _Martyrdom_.\r\n\r\nSecondly, As a matter of _Horror_. 'Tis said, _Wo to the Inhabiters of\r\nthe Earth and of the Sea._ The _Earth_ still means the _False Church_,\r\nthe _Sea_ means the _Wide World_, in Prophetical Phrasaeology. There was\r\nyet left a vast party of Men that were Enemies to the Christian\r\nReligion, in the power of it; a vast party left for the Devil to work\r\nupon: Unto these is a _Wo_ denounced; and why so? 'Tis added, _For the\r\nDevil is come down unto you, having great Wrath, because he knows, that\r\nhe has but a short time._ These were, it seems, to have some desperate\r\nand peculiar Attempts of the Devil made upon them. In the mean time, we\r\nmay Entertain this for our Doctrine,\r\n\r\n_Great Wo proceeds from the Great WRATH, with which the DEVIL, towards\r\nthe end of his TIME, will make a DESCENT upon a miserable World._\r\n\r\nI have now Published a most awful and solemn Warning for our selves at\r\nthis day; which has four _Propositions_, comprehended in it.\r\n\r\n_Proposition I._ That there is a _Devil_, is a thing Doubted by none but\r\nsuch as are under the Influences of the _Devil_. For any to deny the\r\nBeing of a _Devil_ must be from an Ignorance or Profaneness, worse than\r\n_Diabolical_. _A Devil._ What is _that_? We have a Definition of the\r\nMonster, in _Eph. 6.12._ _A Spiritual Wickedness_, that is, _A wicked\r\nSpirit_. A Devil is a _Fallen Angel_, an Angel _Fallen_ from the Fear\r\nand Love of God, and from all Celestial Glories; but _Fallen_ to all\r\nmanner of Wretchedness and Cursedness. He was once in that Order of\r\nHeavenly Creatures, which God in the Beginning made _Ministering\r\nSpirits_, for his own peculiar Service and Honour, in the management of\r\nthe Universe; but we may now write that Epitaph upon him, _How art thou\r\nfallen from Heaven! thou hast said in thine Heart, I will Exalt my\r\nThrone above the Stars of God; but thou art brought down to Hell!_ A\r\nDevil is a _Spiritual_ and _Rational_ Substance, by his _Apostacy_ from\r\nGod, inclined unto all that is Vicious, and for that _Apostacy_ confined\r\nunto the Atmosphere of this Earth, _in Chains under Darkness, unto the\r\nJudgment of the Great Day_. This is a _Devil_; and the _Experience_ of\r\nMankind as well as the _Testimony_ of Scripture, does abundantly prove\r\nthe Existence of such a Devil.\r\n\r\nAbout this _Devil_, there are many things, whereof we may reasonably and\r\nprofitably be Inquisitive; such things, I mean, as are in our Bibles\r\nReveal'd unto us; according to which if we do not speak, on so _dark_ a\r\nSubject, but according to our own uncertain, and perhaps humoursome\r\nConjectures, _There is no Light in us._ I will carry you with me, but\r\nunto one Paragraph of the Bible, to be informed of three Things,\r\nrelating to the _Devil_; 'tis the Story of the _Gadaren Energumen_, in\r\nthe fifth Chapter of _Mark_.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, 'Tis to be granted; the _Devils_ are so many, that some\r\nThousands, can sometimes at once apply themselves to vex one Child of\r\nMan. It is said, in _Mark 5.15._ _He that was Possessed with the Devil,\r\nhad the Legion._ Dreadful to be spoken! A _Legion_ consisted of Twelve\r\nThousand Five Hundred People: And we see that in one Man or two, so many\r\n_Devils_ can be spared for a Garrison. As the Prophet cryed out,\r\n_Multitudes, Multitudes, in the Valley of Decision!_ So I say, _There\r\nare multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of Destruction, where the\r\nDevils are!_ When we speak of, _The Devil_, 'tis, _A name of Multitude_;\r\nit means not _One_ Individual Devil, so Potent and Scient, as perhaps a\r\n_Manichee_ would imagine; but it means a _Kind_, which a _Multitude_\r\nbelongs unto. Alas, the _Devils_, they swarm about us, like the _Frogs\r\nof Egypt_, in the most Retired of our Chambers. Are we at our _Boards_?\r\nThere will be Devils to Tempt us unto Sensuality: Are we in our _Beds_?\r\nThere will be Devils to Tempt us unto Carnality; Are we in our _Shops_?\r\nThere will be Devils to Tempt us into Dishonesty. Yea, Tho' we get into\r\nthe Church of God, there will be Devils to Haunt us in the very _Temple_\r\nit self, and there tempt us to manifold Misbehaviours. I am verily\r\nperswaded, That there are very few Humane Affairs whereinto some Devils\r\nare not Insinuated; There is not so much as a _Journey_ intended, but\r\n_Satan_ will have an hand in _hindering_ or _furthering_ of it.\r\n\r\nSecondly, 'Tis to be supposed, That there is a sort of Arbitrary, even\r\nMilitary _Government_, among the _Devils_. This is intimated, when in\r\n_Mar. 5.9._ _The unclean Spirit said, My Name is Legion:_ they are such\r\na Discipline as _Legions_ use to be. Hence we read about, _The Prince\r\nof the power of the Air_: Our _Air_ has a _power_? or an Army of Devils\r\nin the _High Places_ of it; and these Devils have a _Prince_ over them,\r\nwho is _King over the Children of Pride_. 'Tis probable, That the Devil,\r\nwho was the Ringleader of that mutinous and rebellious Crew, which first\r\nshook off the Authority of God, is now the General of those Hellish\r\nArmies; Our Lord, that Conquered him, has told us the Name of him; 'tis\r\n_Belzebub_; 'tis he that is _the Devil_, and the rest are _his Angels_,\r\nor his Souldiers. Think on vast Regiments of cruel and bloody _French\r\nDragoons_, with an _Intendant_ over them, overrunning a pillaged\r\nNeighbourhood, and you will think a little, what the Constitution among\r\nthe _Devils_ is.\r\n\r\nThirdly, 'tis to be supposed, that some _Devils_ are more peculiarly\r\n_Commission'd_, and perhaps _Qualify'd_, for some Countries, while\r\nothers are for others. This is intimated when in _Mar. 5.10._ The Devils\r\n_besought_ our Lord much, _that he would not send them away out of the\r\nCountrey_. Why was that? But in all probability, because _these Devils_\r\nwere more able to _do the works of the Devil_, in such a Countrey, than\r\nin another. It is not likely that every Devil does know every\r\n_Language_; or that every Devil can do every _Mischief_. 'Tis possible,\r\nthat the _Experience_, or, if I may call it so, the _Education_ of all\r\nDevils is not alike, and that there may be some difference in their\r\n_Abilities_. If one might make an Inference from what the Devils _do_,\r\nto what they _are_, One cannot forbear dreaming, that there are\r\n_degrees_ of Devils. Who can allow, that such Trifling _Daemons_, as that\r\nof _Mascon_, or those that once infested our _New berry_, are of so much\r\nGrandeur, as those _Daemons_, whose Games are mighty Kingdoms? Yea, 'tis\r\ncertain, that all Devils do not make a like Figure in the _Invisible\r\nWorld_. Nor does it look agreeably, That the _Daemons_, which were the\r\nFamiliars of such a Man as the old _Apollonius_, differ not from those\r\nbaser Goblins that chuse to Nest in the filthy and loathsom Rags of a\r\nbeastly Sorceress. Accordingly, why may not some Devils be more\r\naccomplished for what is to be done in such and such places, when others\r\nmust be _detach'd_ for other Territories? Each Devil, as he sees his\r\nadvantage, cries out, _Let me be in this Countrey, rather than another._\r\n\r\nBut _Enough_, if not _too much_, of these things.\r\n\r\n_Proposition II._ There is a Devilish _Wrath_ against _Mankind_, with\r\nwhich the _Devil_ is for _God's sake_ Inspired. The Devil is himself\r\nbroiling under the intollerable and interminable _Wrath_ of God; and a\r\nfiery _Wrath_ at God, is, that which the Devil is for that cause\r\nEnflamed. Methinks I see the posture of the Devils in _Isa. 8.21._ _They\r\nfret themselves, and Curse their God, and look upward._ The first and\r\nchief _Wrath_ of the Devil, is at the Almighty God himself; he knows,\r\n_The God that made him, will not have mercy on him, and the God that\r\nformed him, will shew him no favour;_ and so he can have no _Kindness_\r\nfor that God, who has no _Mercy_, nor _Favour_ for him. Hence 'tis, that\r\nhe cannot bear the _Name_ of God should be acknowledged in the World:\r\nEvery Acknowledgement paid unto _God_, is a fresh drop of the burning\r\nBrimstone falling upon the Devil; he does make his Insolent, tho\r\nImpotent Batteries, even upon the _Throne_ of God himself: and foolishly\r\naffects to have himself exalted unto that _Glorious High Throne_, by\r\nall people, as he sometimes is, by Execrable _Witches_. This horrible\r\nDragon does not only with his Tayl strike at the _Stars of God_, but at\r\nthe God himself, who made the _Stars_, being desirous to out-shine them\r\nall. God and the Devil are sworn Enemies to each other; the Terms\r\nbetween them, are those, in _Zech. 11.18._ _My Soul loathed them, and\r\ntheir Soul also abhorred me._ And from this Furious _wrath_, or\r\nDispleasure and Prejudice at God, proceeds the Devils _wrath_ at us, the\r\npoor Children of Men. Our doing the _Service_ of God, is one thing that\r\nexposes us to the _wrath_ of the Devil. We are the _High Priests_ of the\r\nWorld; when all Creatures are called upon, _Praise ye the Lord_, they\r\nbring to us those demanded _Praises_ of God, saying, _do you offer them\r\nfor us._ Hence 'tis, that the Devil has a Quarrel with us, as he had\r\nwith the _High-Priest_ in the Vision of Old. Our bearing the Image of\r\nGod is another thing that brings the _wrath_ of the Devil upon us. As a\r\n_Tyger_, thro his Hatred at man will tear the very Picture of him, if it\r\ncome in his way; such a _Tyger_ the Devil is; because God said of old,\r\n_Let us make Man in our Image_, the Devil is ever saying, _Let us pull\r\nthis man to pieces_. But the envious _Pride_ of the Devil, is one thing\r\nmore that gives an Edge unto his Furious _Wrath_ against us. The Apostle\r\nhas given us an hint, as if _Pride_ had been the _Condemnation of the\r\nDevil_. 'Tis not unlikely, that the Devil's _Affectation_ to be above\r\nthat Condition which he might learn that Mankind was to be preferr'd\r\nunto, might be the occasion of his taking up Arms against the _Immortal\r\nKing_. However, the Devil now sees _Man_ lying in the Bosom of God, but\r\n_himself_ damned in the bottom of Hell; and this enrages him\r\nexceedingly; _O_, says he, _I cannot bear it, that man should not be as\r\nmiserable as my self._\r\n\r\n_Proposition III._ The _Devil_, in the prosecution, and the execution of\r\nhis _wrath_ upon them, often gets a _Liberty_ to make a _Descent_ upon\r\nthe Children of men. When the Devil _does hurt_ unto us, he _comes down_\r\nunto us; for the Rendezvouze of the _Infernal Troops_, is indeed in the\r\n_supernal parts_ of our Air. But as 'tis said, _A sparrow of the Air\r\ndoes not fall down without the will of God;_ so I may say, _Not a Devil\r\nin the Air, can come down without the leave of God._ Of this we have a\r\nfamous Instance in that Arabian Prince, of whom the Devil was not able\r\nso much as to _Touch_ any thing, till the most high God gave him a\r\npermission, to _go down_. The Devil stands with all the Instruments of\r\ndeath, aiming at us, and begging of the Lord, as that King ask'd for the\r\nHood-wink'd _Syrians_ of old, _Shall I smite 'em, shall I smite 'em?_ He\r\ncannot strike a blow, till the Lord say, _Go down and smite_, but\r\nsometimes he _does_ obtain from the _high possessor of Heaven and\r\nEarth_, a License for the doing of it. The Devil sometimes does make\r\nmost rueful Havock among us; but still we may say to him, as our Lord\r\nsaid unto a great Servant of his, _Thou couldest have no power against\r\nme, except it were given thee from above._ The Devil is called in _1\r\nPet. 5.8._ _Your Adversary_. This is a Law-term; and it notes _An\r\nAdversary at Law_. The Devil cannot come at us, except in some sence\r\naccording to _Law_; but sometimes he does procure sad things to be\r\ninflicted, according to the _Law_ of the eternal King upon us. The Devil\r\nfirst _goes up_ as an _Accuser_ against us. He is therefore styled _The\r\nAccuser_; and it is on this account, that his proper Name does belong\r\nunto him. There is a Court somewhere kept; a Court of Spirits, where the\r\nDevil enters all sorts of Complaints against us all; he charges us with\r\nmanifold _sins_ against the Lord our God: _There_ he loads us with heavy\r\n_Imputations_ of Hypocrysie, Iniquity, Disobedience; whereupon he urges,\r\n_Lord, let 'em now have the death, which is their wages, paid unto 'em!_\r\nIf our _Advocate_ in the Heavens do not now take off his Libels; the\r\nDevil, then, with a Concession of God, _comes down_, as a _destroyer_\r\nupon us. Having first been an _Attorney_, to bespeak that the Judgments\r\nof Heaven may be ordered for us, he then also pleads, that he may be the\r\n_Executioner_ of those Judgments; and the God of Heaven sometimes after\r\na sort, signs a Warrant, for this _destroying Angel_, to do what has\r\nbeen _desired_ to be done for the _destroying of men_. But such a\r\n_permission_ from God, for the Devil to _come down_, and _break in_ upon\r\nmankind, oftentimes must be accompany'd with a _Commission_ from some\r\nwretches of mankind it self. Every man is, as 'tis hinted in _Gen. 4.9._\r\n_His brother's keeper_. We are to _keep_ one another from the Inroads of\r\nthe Devil, by mutual and cordial Wishes of prosperity to one another.\r\nWhen ungodly people give their _Consents_ in _witchcrafts_ diabolically\r\nperformed, for the Devil to annoy their Neighbours, he finds a breach\r\nmade in the Hedge about us, whereat he Rushes in upon us, with grievous\r\nmolestations. Yea, when the impious people, that never saw the Devil, do\r\nbut utter their _Curses_ against their Neighbours, those are so many\r\n_watch words_, whereby the Mastives of Hell are animated presently to\r\nfall upon us. 'Tis thus, that the Devil gets _leave_ to worry us.\r\n\r\n_Proposition IV._ Most horrible _woes_ come to be inflicted upon\r\nMankind, when the _Devil_ does in _great wrath_, make a _descent_ upon\r\nthem. The _Devil_ is a _Do-Evil_, and wholly set upon mischief. When our\r\nLord once was going to _Muzzel_ him, that he might not mischief others,\r\nhe cry'd out, _Art thou come to torment me?_ He is, it seems, himself\r\n_Tormented_, if he be but _Restrained_ from the tormenting of Men. If\r\nupon the sounding of the Three last _Apocalyptical Angels_, it was an\r\noutcry made in Heaven, _Wo, wo, wo, to the inhabitants of the Earth by\r\nreason of the voice of the Trumpet._ I am sure, a _descent_ made by the\r\nAngel of _death_, would give cause for the like Exclamation: _Wo to the\r\nworld, by reason of the wrath of the Devil!_ what a _woful_ plight,\r\nmankind would by the descent of the Devil be brought into, may be\r\ngathered from the _woful_ pains, and wounds, and hideous desolations\r\nwhich the Devil brings upon them, with whom he has with a _bodily\r\nPossession_ made a Seisure. You may both in Sacred and Profane History,\r\nread many a direful Account of the _woes_, which they that are possessed\r\nby the Devil, do undergo: And from thence conclude, _What must the\r\nChildren of Men hope from such a Devil!_ Moreover, the _Tyrannical\r\nCeremonies_, whereto the Devil uses to subjugate such _Woful_ Nations or\r\nOrders of Men, as are more Entirely under his Dominion, do declare what\r\n_woful_ Work the Devil would make where he comes. The very Devotions of\r\nthose forlorn _Pagans_, to whom the Devil is a Leader, are most bloody\r\n_Penances_; and what _Woes_ indeed must we expect from such a Devil of\r\na _Moloch_, as relishes no Sacrifices like those of Humane Heart-blood,\r\nand unto whom there is no Musick like the bitter, dying, doleful Groans,\r\nejaculated by the Roasting Children of Men.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the servile, abject, needy circumstances wherein the Devil\r\nkeeps the Slaves, that are under his more sensible Vassalage, do suggest\r\nunto us, how _woful_ the Devil would render all our Lives. We that live\r\nin a Province, which affords unto us all that may be necessary or\r\ncomfortable for us, found the Province fill'd with vast Herds of\r\nSalvages, that never saw so much as a _Knife_, or a _Nail_, or a\r\n_Board_, or a Grain of _Salt_, in all their Days. No better would the\r\nDevil have the World provided for. Nor should we, or any else, have one\r\nconvenient thing about us, but be as indigent as _usually_ our most\r\n_Ragged Witches_ are; if _the Devil's Malice_ were not over-ruled by a\r\n_compassionate God_, who _preserves Man and Beast_. Hence 'tis, that\r\n_the Devil_, even like a _Dragon_, keeping a Guard upon such _Fruits_ as\r\nwould _refresh_ a languishing World, has hindred Mankind for many Ages,\r\nfrom hitting those _useful Inventions_, which yet _were so obvious_ and\r\n_facil_, that it is every bodies wonder, they were no sooner hit upon.\r\nThe _bemisted World_, must jog on for thousands of Years, without the\r\nknowledg of _the Loadstone_, till a _Neapolitan_ stumbled upon it, about\r\n_three hundred years_ ago. Nor must the World be _blest_ with such a\r\n_matchless Engine_ of _Learning_ and _Vertue_, as that of _Printing_,\r\ntill about _the middle of the Fifteenth Century_. Nor could _One Old\r\nMan, all over the Face of the whole Earth_, have the _benefit_ of such a\r\n_Little_, tho most _needful_ thing, as a pair of _Spectacles_, till a\r\n_Dutch-Man_, a _little while_ ago accommodated us.\r\n\r\nIndeed, as the Devil does begrutch us all manner of _Good_, so he does\r\nannoy us with all manner of _Wo_, as often as he finds himself capable\r\nof doing it. But shall we mention some of the _special woes_ with which\r\nthe Devil does usually infest the World! Briefly then; _Plagues_ are\r\nsome of those _woes_ with which the Devil troubles us. It is said of the\r\n_Israelites_, in _1 Cor. 10.10._ _They were destroyed of the destroyer._\r\nThat is, they had the _Plague_ among them. 'Tis the _Destroyer_, or _the\r\nDevil_, that scatters _Plagues_ about the World. Pestilential and\r\nContagious Diseases, 'tis the Devil who does oftentimes invade us with\r\nthem. 'Tis no uneasy thing for the Devil to impregnate the Air about us,\r\nwith such Malignant _Salts_, as meeting with _the Salt_ of our\r\n_Microcosm_, shall immediately cast us into that Fermentation and\r\nPutrefaction, which will utterly dissolve all the Vital Tyes within us;\r\nEv'n as an _Aqua-Fortis_, made with a conjunction of _Nitre_ and\r\n_Vitriol_, Corrodes what it Seizes upon. And when the Devil has raised\r\nthose _Arsenical Fumes_, which become _Venemous Quivers_ full of\r\n_Terrible Arrows_, how easily can he shoot the deleterious _Miasms_ into\r\nthose Juices or Bowels of Mens Bodies, which will soon Enflame them with\r\na Mortal Fire! Hence come such _Plagues_, as that _Beesom of\r\nDestruction_, which within our memory swept away such a Throng of People\r\nfrom one _English_ City in one Visitation; And hence those Infectious\r\nFevers, which are but so many _Disguised Plagues_ among us, causing\r\nEpidemical Desolations. Again, _Wars_ are also some of those _Woes_,\r\nwith which the Devil causes our Trouble. It is said in _Rev. 12.17._\r\n_The Dragon was Wrath, and he went to make War;_ and there is in truth\r\nscarce any _War_, but what is of the _Dragon's_ kindling. The Devil is\r\nthat _Vulcan_, out of whose Forge come the instruments of our _Wars_,\r\nand it is he that finds us Employments for those Instruments. We read\r\nconcerning _Daemoniacks_, or People in whom the Devil was, that they\r\nwould cut and wound themselves; and so, when the Devil is in Men, he\r\nputs 'em upon dealing in that barbarous fashion with one another. _Wars_\r\ndo often furnish him with some Thousands of Souls in one Morning from\r\none Acre of Ground; and for the sake of such _Thyestaean_ Banquets, he\r\nwill push us upon as many _Wars_ as he can.\r\n\r\nOnce more, why may not _Storms_ be reckoned among those _Woes_, with\r\nwhich the Devil does disturb us? It is not improbable that _Natural\r\nStorms_ on the World are often of the Devils raising. We are told in\r\n_Job 1.11, 12, 19._ that the Devil made a _Storm_, which hurricano'd the\r\nHouse of _Job_, upon the Heads of them that were Feasting in it.\r\n_Paracelsus_ could have informed the Devil, if he had not been informed,\r\nas besure he was before, That if much _Aluminious_ matter, with _Salt\r\nPetre_ not throughly prepared, be mixed, they will send up a cloud of\r\nSmoke, which _will_ come down in Rain. But undoubtedly the _Devil_\r\nunderstands as _well_ the way to make a _Tempest_ as to turn the _Winds_\r\nat the _Solicitation_ of a _Laplander_; whence perhaps it is, that\r\nThunders are observed oftner to break upon _Churches_ than upon any\r\nother _Buildings_; and besides many a Man, yea many a Ship, yea, many a\r\nTown has miscarried, when the Devil has been permitted from above to\r\nmake an horrible Tempest. However that the Devil has raised many\r\n_Metaphorical Storms_ upon the Church, is a thing, than which there is\r\nnothing more notorious. It was said unto Believers in _Rev. 2.10._ _The\r\nDevil shall cast some of you into Prison._ The Devil was he that at\r\nfirst set _Cain upon Abel_ to butcher him, as the Apostle seems to\r\nsuggest, for his Faith in God, as a _Rewarder_. And in how many\r\n_Persecutions_, as well as _Heresies_ has the Devil been ever since\r\nEngaging all the Children of _Cain_! That Serpent the Devil has acted\r\nhis cursed Seed in unwearied endeavours to have them, _Of whom the World\r\nis not worthy_, treated as those who are _not worthy to live in the\r\nWorld_. By the impulse of the Devil, 'tis that first the old _Heathens_,\r\nand then the mad _Arians_ were _pricking Briars_ to the true Servants of\r\nGod; and that the _Papists_ that came after them, have out done them all\r\nfor Slaughters, upon those that have been _accounted as the Sheep for\r\nthe Slaughters_. The late _French_ Persecution is perhaps the horriblest\r\nthat ever was in the World: And as the Devil of _Mascon_ seems before to\r\nhave meant it in his out-cries upon _the Miseries preparing for the poor\r\nHugonots_! Thus it has been all acted by a singular Fury of the old\r\nDragon inspiring of his Emissaries.\r\n\r\nBut in reality, _Spiritual Woes_ are the _principal Woes_ among all\r\nthose that the Devil would have us undone withal. _Sins_ are the worst\r\nof _Woes_, and the Devil seeks nothing so much as to plunge us into\r\nSins. When men do commit a Crime for which they are to be Indicted, they\r\nare usually _mov'd by the Instigation of the Devil_. The Devil will put\r\n_ill men upon being worse_. Was it not he that said in _1 King. 22.22._\r\n_I will go forth, and be a lying Spirit in the Mouth of all the\r\nProphets?_ Even so the Devil becomes an _Unclean Spirit_, _a Drinking\r\nSpirit_, _a Swearing Spirit_, _a Worldly Spirit_, _a Passionate Spirit_,\r\n_a Revengeful Spirit_, and the like in the Hearts of those that are\r\nalready too much of such a Spirit; and thus they become improv'd in\r\nSinfulness. Yea, the Devil will put _good men upon doing ill_. Thus we\r\nread in _1 Chron. 21.1._ _Satan provoked David to number Israel._ And so\r\nthe _Devil provokes_ men that are Eminent in Holiness unto such things\r\nas may become eminently Pernicious; he _provokes_ them especially unto\r\n_Pride_, and unto many unsuitable Emulations. There are likewise most\r\nlamentable Impressions which the _Devil_ makes upon the _Souls of Men_\r\nby way of punishment upon them for their _Sins_. 'Tis thus when an\r\nOffended God puts the Souls of Men over into the Hands of that Officer\r\n_who has the power of Death, that is, the Devil_. It is the woful Misery\r\nof Unbelievers in _2 Cor. 4.4._ _The god of this World has blinded their\r\nminds._ And thus it may be said of those woful Wretches whom the _Devil_\r\nis a God unto, _the Devil so muffles them that they cannot see the\r\nthings of their peace._ And _the Devil so hardens them, that nothing\r\nwill awaken their cares about their Souls:_ How come so many to be\r\n_Seared_ in their Sins? 'Tis the Devil that with a red hot Iron fetcht\r\nfrom his Hell does _cauterise_ them. Thus 'tis, till perhaps at last\r\nthey come to have a _Wounded Conscience_ in them, and the Devil has\r\noften a share in their Torturing and confounding Anguishes. The _Devil_\r\nwho Terrified _Cain_, and _Saul_, and _Judas_ into Desperation, still\r\nbecomes a _King of Terrors_ to many Sinners, and frights them from\r\nlaying hold on the Mercy of God in the Lord Jesus Christ. In these\r\nregards, _Wo to us, when the Devil comes down upon us._\r\n\r\n_Proposition V._ Toward the _End_ of his _Time_ the _Descent_ of the\r\nDevil in _Wrath_ upon the World will produce more _woful Effects_, than\r\nwhat have been _in former Ages_. The dying Dragon, will bite more\r\ncruelly and sting more bloodily than ever he did before: The Death-pangs\r\nof the Devil will make him to be more of a _Devil_ than ever he was; and\r\nthe Furnace of this _Nebuchadnezzar_ will be heated _seven times_\r\nhotter, just before its putting out.\r\n\r\nWe are in the first place to apprehend that there is a time fixed and\r\nstated by God for the Devil to enjoy a dominion over our sinful and\r\ntherefore woful World. The _Devil_ once exclaimed in _Mat. 8.29._\r\n_Jesus, thou Son of God, art thou come hither to Torment us before our\r\nTime?_ It is plain, that until the second coming of our Lord the _Devil_\r\nmust have a time of plagueing the World, which he was afraid would have\r\nExpired at his first. The _Devil_ is _by the wrath of God the Prince of\r\nthis World_; and the time of his Reign is to continue until the time\r\nwhen our Lord himself shall _take to himself his great Power and Reign_.\r\nThen 'tis that the _Devil_ shall hear the Son of God swearing with loud\r\nThunders against him, _Thy time shall now be no more!_ Then shall the\r\n_Devil_ with his Angels receive their doom, which will be, _depart into\r\nthe everlasting Fire prepared for you._\r\n\r\nWe are also to apprehend, that in the _mean time_, the Devil can give a\r\nshrewd guess, when he draws near to the _End of his Time_. When he saw\r\nChristianity enthron'd among the _Romans_, it is here said, in our _Rev.\r\n12.12._ _He knows he hath but a short time._ And how does he _know_ it?\r\nWhy _Reason_ will make the Devil to _know_ that God won't suffer him to\r\nhave _the Everlasting Dominion_; and that when God has once begun to\r\nrescue the World out of his hands, he'll go through with it, until _the\r\nCaptives of the mighty shall be taken away and the prey of the terrible\r\nshall be delivered._ But the Devil will have _Scripture_ also, to make\r\nhim _know_, that when his Antichristian _Vicar_, the _seven-headed\r\nBeast_ on the _seven-hilled_ City, shall have spent his determined\r\nyears, he with his _Vicar_ must unavoidably go down into the _bottomless\r\nPit_. It is not improbable, that the Devil often hears the _Scripture_\r\nexpounded in our Congregations; yea that we never assemble without a\r\n_Satan_ among us. As there are some Divines, who do with more\r\nuncertainty conjecture, from a certain place in the Epistle to the\r\n_Ephesians_, That the Angels do sometimes come into our Churches, to\r\ngain some advantage from our Ministry. But be sure our _Demonstrable\r\nInterpretations_ may give Repeated Notices to the Devil, _That his time\r\nis almost out;_ and what the Preacher says unto the _Young Man_, _Know\r\nthou, that God will bring thee into Judgment!_ THAT may our Sermons tell\r\nunto the _Old Wretch_, _Know thou, that thy Judgment is at hand._\r\n\r\nBut we must now, likewise, apprehend, that in _such a time_, the _woes_\r\nof the World will be heightened, beyond what they were at _any time_ yet\r\nfrom the foundation of the World. Hence 'tis, that the Apostle has\r\nforewarned us, in _2 Tim. 3.1._ _this know, that in the last days,\r\nperillous times shall come._ Truly, when the Devil _knows_, that he is\r\ngot into his _Last days_, he will make _perillous times_ for us; the\r\ntimes will grow more full of _Devils_, and therefore more full of\r\n_Perils_, than ever they were before. Of this, if we would _know_, what\r\ncause is to be assigned; It is not only, because the Devil grows more\r\n_able_, and more _eager_ to vex the World; but also, and chiefly,\r\nbecause the World is more _worthy_ to be vexed by the Devil, than ever\r\nheretofore. The _Sins_ of men in this Generation, will be more _mighty\r\nSins_, than those of the former Ages; men will be more Accurate and\r\nExquisite and Refined in the arts of _Sinning_, than they use to be. And\r\nbesides, their own sins, the sins of all the former Ages will also lie\r\nupon the sinners of this generation. Do we ask why the _mischievous\r\npowers of darkness_ are to prevail more in our days, than they did in\r\nthose that are past and gone! 'Tis because that men by sinning over\r\nagain the sins of the former days, have a _Fellowship with all those\r\nunfruitful works of darkness_. As 'twas said in _Matth. 23.36._ _All\r\nthese things shall come upon this generation;_ so, the men of the last\r\nGeneration, will find themselves involved in the gulf of all that went\r\nbefore them. Of Sinners 'tis said, _They heap up wrath;_ and the sinners\r\nof the Last Generations do not only add unto the _heap_ of sin that has\r\nbeen pileing up ever since the Fall of man, but they Interest themselves\r\nin every sin of that enormous heap. There has been a _Cry_ of all former\r\nages going up to God, _That the Devil may come down!_ and the sinners of\r\nthe Last Generations, do sharpen and louden that _cry_, till the thing\r\ndo come to pass, as Destructively as Irremediably. From whence it\r\nfollows, that the Thrice Holy God, with his Holy Angels, will now after\r\na sort more _abandon_ the World, than in the former ages. The roaring\r\nImpieties of _the old World_, at last gave mankind such a distast in the\r\nHeart of the Just God, that he came to say, _It Repents me that I have\r\nmade such a Creature!_ And however, it may be but a witty Fancy, in a\r\nlate Learned Writer, that the _Earth_ before the Flood was nearer to the\r\nSun, than it is at this Day; and that Gods Hurling down the _Earth_ to a\r\nfurther distance from the _Sun_, were the cause of that Flood; yet we\r\nmay fitly enough say, that men perished by a _Rejection_ from the God of\r\nHeaven. Thus the enhanc'd Impieties of this _our World_, will Exasperate\r\nthe Displeasure of God, at such a rate, as that he will more _cast us\r\noff_, than heretofore; until at last, he do with a more than ordinary\r\nIndignation say, _Go Devils; do you take them, and make them beyond all\r\nformer measures miserable!_\r\n\r\nIf Lastly, We are inquisitive after Instances of those aggravated\r\n_woes_, with which the Devil will towards the _End_ of his _Time_\r\nassault us; let it be remembred, That all the Extremities which were\r\nforetold by the _Trumpets_ and _Vials_ in the Apocalyptick Schemes of\r\nthese things, to come upon the World, were the _woes_ to come from the\r\n_wrath_ of the Devil, upon the _shortning_ of his _Time_. The horrendous\r\ndesolations that have come upon mankind, by the Irruptions of the old\r\n_Barbarians_ upon the _Roman_ World, and then of the _Saracens_, and\r\nsince, of the _Turks_, were such _woes_ as men had never seen before.\r\nThe Infandous _Blindness_ and _Vileness_ which then came upon mankind,\r\nand the Monstrous _Croisadoes_ which thereupon carried the _Roman_ World\r\nby Millions together unto the Shambles; were also such _woes_ as had\r\nnever yet had a Parallel. And yet these were some of the things here\r\nintended, when it was said, _Wo! For the Devil is come down in great\r\nWrath, having but a short time._\r\n\r\nBut besides all these things, and besides the increase of _Plagues_ and\r\n_Wars_, and _Storms_, and _Internal Maladies_ now in our days, there are\r\nespecially two most extraordinary _Woes_, one would fear, will in these\r\ndays become very ordinary. One _Woe_ that may be look'd for is, A\r\nfrequent Repetition of _Earthquakes_, and this perhaps by the energy of\r\nthe Devil in the _Earth_. The Devil will be clap't up, as a Prisoner in\r\nor near the Bowels of the earth, when once that _Conflagration_ shall be\r\ndispatched, which will make, _The New Earth wherein shall dwell\r\nRighteousness;_ and that _Conflagration_ will doubtless be much\r\npromoted, by the Subterraneous _Fires_, which are a cause of the\r\n_Earthquakes_ in our Dayes. Accordingly, we read, _Great Earthquakes in\r\ndivers places_, enumerated among the Tokens of the _Time_ approaching,\r\nwhen the Devil shall have no longer _Time_. I suspect, That we shall now\r\nbe visited with more Usual and yet more Fatal _Earthquakes_, than were\r\nour Ancestors; in asmuch as the _Fires_ that are shortly to _Burn unto\r\nthe Lowest Hell, and set on Fire the Foundations of the Mountains_, will\r\nnow get more Head than they use to do; and it is not impossible, that\r\nthe Devil, who is ere long to be punished in those _Fires_, may\r\naforehand augment his Desert of it, by having an hand in using some of\r\nthose _Fires_, for our Detriment. Learned Men have made no scruple to\r\ncharge the Devil with it; _Deo permittente, Terrae motus causat._ The\r\nDevil surely, was a party in the _Earthquake_, whereby the Vengeance of\r\nGod, in one black Night sunk Twelve considerable Cities of _Asia_, in\r\nthe Reign of _Tiberious_. But there will be more such _Catastrophes_ in\r\nour Dayes; _Italy_ has lately been _Shaking_, till its _Earthquakes_\r\nhave brought Ruines at once upon more than thirty Towns; but it will\r\nwithin a little while, _shake_ again, and _shake_ till the Fire of God\r\nhave made an Entire _Etna_ of it. And behold, This very Morning, when I\r\nwas intending to utter among you such Things as these, we are cast into\r\nan _Heartquake_ by Tidings of an _Earthquake_ that has lately happened\r\nat _Jamaica_: an horrible _Earthquake_, whereby the _Tyrus_ of the\r\nEnglish _America_, was at once pull'd into the Jaws of the Gaping and\r\nGroaning Earth, and many Hundreds of the Inhabitants buried alive. The\r\nLord sanctifie so dismal a Dispensation of his Providence, unto all the\r\n_American_ Plantations! But be assured, my Neighbours, the _Earthquakes_\r\nare not over yet! We have not yet seen _the last_. And then, Another\r\n_Wo_ that may be Look'd for is, The Devils being now let Loose in\r\n_preternatural Operations_ more than formerly; and perhaps in\r\n_Possessions_ and _Obsessions_ that shall be very marvellous. You are\r\nnot Ignorant, That just before our Lords _First Coming_, there were most\r\nobservable Outrages committed by the Devil upon the Children of Men: And\r\nI am suspicious, That there will again be an unusual Range of the Devil\r\namong us, a little before the _Second Coming_ of our Lord, which will\r\nbe, to give the last stroke, in _Destroying the works of the Devil_. The\r\n_Evening Wolves_ will be much abroad, when we are near the _Evening_ of\r\nthe World. The Devil is going to be Dislodged of the _Air_, where his\r\npresent Quarters are; God will with flashes of hot _Lightning_ upon\r\nhim, cause him to _fall as Lightning_ from his Ancient Habitations: And\r\nthe _Raised Saints_ will there have a _New Heaven_, which We _expect\r\naccording to the Promise of God_. Now a little before this thing, you be\r\nlike to see the Devil more _sensible_ and _visibly_ Busy upon _Earth_\r\nperhaps, than ever he was before. You shall oftner hear about\r\n_Apparitions_ of the Devil, and about poor people strangely Bewitched,\r\n_Possessed_ and _Obsessed_, by Infernal Fiends. When our Lord is going\r\nto set up His Kingdom, in the most _sensible_ and _visible_ manner, that\r\never was, and in a manner answering _the Transfiguration_ in _the\r\nMount_, it is a Thousand to One, but _the Devil_ will in sundry _parts\r\nof the world_, assay _the like_ for Himself, with a most Apish\r\nImitation: and Men, at least in _some_ Corners of the World, and perhaps\r\nin _such_ as God may have some special Designs upon, will to their Cost,\r\nbe more Familiarized _with the World of Spirits_, than they had been\r\nformerly.\r\n\r\nSo that, in fine, if just before _the End_, when _the times of the Jews_\r\nwere to be finished, a man then ran about every where, crying, _Wo to\r\nthe Nation! Wo to the City! Wo to the Temple! Wo! Wo! Wo!_ Much more may\r\nthe descent of the Devil, just before his _End_, when also _the times of\r\nthe Gentiles_ will be finished, cause us to cry out, _Wo! Wo! Wo!\r\nbecause of the black things that threaten us!_\r\n\r\nBut it is now Time to make our Improvement of what has been said. And,\r\nfirst, we shall entertain our selves with a few _Corollaries_, deduced\r\nfrom what has been thus asserted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Corollary I._\r\n\r\nWhat cause have we to bless God, for our preservation from the _Devils\r\nwrath_, in this which may too reasonably be called the _Devils World_!\r\nWhile we are in _this present evil world_, We are continually surrounded\r\nwith swarms of those Devils, who make this _present world_, become so\r\n_evil_. What a wonder of Mercy is it, that no _Devil_ could ever yet\r\nmake a prey of us! We can set our foot no where but we shall tread in\r\nthe midst of most Hellish _Rattle-Snakes_; and one of those\r\n_Rattle-Snakes_ once thro' the mouth of a Man, on whom he had Seized,\r\nhissed out such a Truth as this, _If God would let me loose upon you, I\r\nshould find enough in the Best of you all, to make you all mine._ What\r\nshall I say? The _Wilderness_ thro' which we are passing to the\r\n_Promised Land_, is all over fill'd with _Fiery flying serpents_. But,\r\nblessed be God; None of them have hitherto so fastned upon us, as to\r\nconfound us utterly! All our way to Heaven, lies by the _Dens of Lions_,\r\nand the _Mounts of Leopards_; there are incredible Droves of Devils in\r\nour way. But have we safely got on our way thus far? O let us be\r\nthankful to our Eternal preserver for it. It is said in _Psal. 76.10._\r\n_Surely the wrath of Man shall praise thee, and the Remainder of wrath\r\nshalt thou restrain;_ But _surely_ it becomes us to praise God, in that\r\nwe have yet sustain'd no more Damage by the _wrath of the Devil_, and in\r\nthat he has restrain'd that Overwhelming _wrath_. We are poor,\r\nTravellers in a World, which is as well the Devils _Field_, as the\r\nDevils _Gaol_; a World in every Nook whereof, the Devil is encamped,\r\nwith _Bands of Robbers_, to pester all that have their _Face looking\r\nZion-ward_: And are we all this while preserved from the undoing Snares\r\nof the _Devil_? it is, _Thou, O keeper of Israel, that hast hitherto\r\nbeen our Keeper!_ And therefore, _Bless the Lord, O my soul, Bless his\r\nHoly Name, who has redeemed thy Life from the Destroyer!_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Corollary II._\r\n\r\nWe may see the rise of those multiply'd, magnify'd, and\r\nSingularly-stinged Afflictions, with which _aged_, or _dying_ Saints\r\nfrequently have their _Death_ Prefaced, and their _Age_ embittered. When\r\nthe Saints of God are going to leave the World, it is usually a more\r\n_Stormy World_ with them, than ever it was; and they find more _Vanity_,\r\nand more _Vexation_ in the world than ever they did before. It is true,\r\n_That many are the afflictions of the Righteous;_ but a little before\r\nthey bid adieu to all those many _Afflictions_, they often have greater,\r\nharder, Sorer, Loads thereof laid upon them, than they had yet endured.\r\nIt is true, _That thro' much Tribulation we must enter in the Kingdom of\r\nGod;_ but a little before our _Entrance_ thereinto, our _Tribulation_\r\nmay have some sharper accents of Sorrow, than ever were yet upon it. And\r\nwhat is the cause of this? It is indeed the _Faithfulness of our God\r\nunto us_, that we should find the _Earth_ more full of _Thorns_ and\r\n_Briars_ than ever, just before he fetches us from _Earth_ to _Heaven_;\r\nthat so we may go away the more willingly, the more easily, and with\r\nless Convulsion, at his calling for us. O there are _ugly Ties_, by\r\nwhich we are fastned unto this world; but God will by _Thorns and\r\nBriars_ tear those _Ties_ asunder. But, _is not the Hand of Joab here?_\r\nSure, There is the _wrath_ of the _Devil_ also in it. A little before we\r\nstep into Heaven, the _Devil_ thinks with himself, _My time to abuse\r\nthat Saint is now but short; what Mischief I am to do that Saint, must\r\nbe done quickly, if at all; he'l shortly be out of my Reach for ever._\r\nAnd for this cause he will now fly upon us with the Fiercest Efforts and\r\nFuries of his _Wrath_. It was allowed unto the _Serpent_, in _Gen. 2.15._\r\n_To Bruise the Heel_. Why, at the _Heel_, or at the _Close_, of our\r\nLives, the _Serpent_ will be nibbling, more than ever in our Lives\r\nbefore: and it is, _Because now he has but a short time._ He knows, That\r\nwe shall very shortly be, _Where the wicked cease from Troubling, and\r\nwhere the Weary are at Rest;_ wherefore that _Wicked_ one will now\r\n_Trouble_ us, more than ever he did, and we shall have so much\r\n_Disrest_, as will make us more _weary_ than ever we were, of things\r\nhere below.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Corollary III._\r\n\r\nWhat a Reasonable Thing then is it, that they whose _Time_ is but\r\n_short_, should make as great _Use_ of their _Time_, as ever they can!\r\npray, let us learn some _good_, even from the _wicked One_ himself. It\r\nhas been advised, _Be wise as Serpents:_ why, there is a piece of\r\n_Wisdom_, whereto that old _Serpent_, the Devil himself, may be our\r\nMoniter. When the Devil perceives his _Time_ is but _short_, it puts him\r\nupon _Great Wrath_. But how should it be with _us_, when we perceive\r\nthat our _Time_ is but _short_? why, it should put us upon _Great Work_.\r\nThe motive which makes the Devil to be more full of _wrath_; should make\r\nus more full of _warmth_, more full of _watch_, and more full of _All\r\nDiligence to make our Vocation, and Election sure_. Our _Pace_ in our\r\nJourney _Heaven-ward_, must be Quickened, if our _space_ for that\r\nJourney be shortned, even as _Israel_ went further the _two last_ years\r\nof their Journey _Canaan-ward_, than they did in 38 years before. The\r\nApostle brings this, as a _spur_ to the Devotions of Christians, in _1\r\nCor. 7.29._ _This I say, Brethren, the time is short._ Even so, I _say_\r\nthis; some things I lay before you, which I do only _think_, or _guess_,\r\nbut here is a thing which I venture to _say_ with all the freedom\r\nimaginable. You have now a _Time_ to _Get_ good, even a _Time_ to make\r\nsure of _Grace and Glory, and every good thing_, by true Repentance:\r\nBut, _This I say, the time is but short._ You have now _Time_ to _Do_\r\ngood, even to _serve out your generation_, as by the _Will_, so for the\r\n_Praise_ of God; but, _This I say, the time is but short._ And what I\r\nsay thus to _All_ People, I say to _Old_ People, with a peculiar\r\nVehemency: Sirs, It cannot be long before your _Time_ is out; there are\r\nbut a few sands left in the glass of your _Time_: And it is of all\r\nthings the saddest, for a man to say, _My Time is done, but my work\r\nundone!_ O then, _To work_ as fast as you can; and of Soul-work, and\r\nChurch-work, dispatch as much as ever you can. Say to all _Hindrances_,\r\nas the gracious _Jeremiah Burrows_ would sometimes to _Visitants_:\r\n_You'll excuse me if I ask you to be short with me, for my work is\r\ngreat, and my time is but short._ Methinks every _time_ we hear a Clock,\r\nor see a Watch, we have an admonition given us, that our _Time_ is upon\r\nthe _wing_, and it will all be gone within a little while. I remember I\r\nhave read of a famous man, who having a _Clock-watch_ long lying by him,\r\nout of Kilture in his Trunk, it unaccountably struck Eleven just before\r\nhe died. Why, there are many of you, for whom I am to do that office\r\nthis day: I am to tell you _You are come to your +Eleventh+ hour;_ there\r\nis no more than a _twelfth part_ at most, of your life yet behind. But\r\nif we neglect our business, till our _short Time_ shall be reduced into\r\n_none_, then, _woe to us, for the great wrath of God will send us down\r\nfrom whence there is no Redemption._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Corollary IV._\r\n\r\nHow welcome should a _Death in the Lord_ be unto them that belong not\r\nunto the Devil, but unto the Lord! While we are sojourning in this\r\nWorld, we are in what may upon too many accounts be called _The Devils\r\nCountry_: We are where the Devil may come upon us in _great wrath_\r\ncontinually. The day when God shall take us out of this World, will be,\r\n_The day when the Lord will deliver us from the hand of all our Enemies,\r\nand from the hand of Satan_. In such a day, why should not our song be\r\nthat of the Psalmist, _Blessed be my Rock, and let the God of my\r\nSalvation be exalted!_ While we are here, we are in _the valley of the\r\nshadow of death_; and what is it that makes it so? 'Tis because the\r\n_wild Beasts of Hell_ are lurking on every side of us, and every minute\r\nready to salley forth upon us. But our _Death_ will fetch us out of that\r\n_Valley_, and carry us where we shall be _for ever with the Lord_. We\r\nare now under the daily _Buffetings_ of the Devil, and he does molest us\r\nwith such _Fiery Darts_, as cause us even to cry out, _I am weary of my\r\nLife._ Yea, but are we as _willing to die_, as, _weary of Life_? Our\r\nDeath will then soon set us where we cannot be reach'd by the _Fist of\r\nWickedness_; and where the _Perfect cannot be shotten at_. It is said in\r\n_Rev. 14.13._ _Blessed are the Dead which die in the Lord, they rest\r\nfrom their labours._ But we may say, _Blessed are the Dead in the Lord,\r\ninasmuch as they rest from the Devils!_ Our _dying_ will be but our\r\n_taking wing_: When attended with a Convoy of winged Angels, we shall be\r\nconvey'd into that Heaven, from whence the Devil having been thrown he\r\nshall never more come thither after us. What if God should now say to\r\nus, as to _Moses_, _Go up and die!_ As long as we _go up_, when we\r\n_die_, let us receive the Message with a joyful Soul; we shall soon be\r\nthere, where the Devil can't _come down_ upon us. If the _God of our\r\nLife_ should now send that Order to us, which he gave to _Hezekiah_,\r\n_Set thy house in order, for thou shalt die, and not live;_ we need not\r\nbe cast into such deadly Agonies thereupon, as _Hezekiah_ was: We are\r\nbut going to that _House_, the Golden Doors whereof, cannot be entred by\r\nthe Devil that here did use to persecute us. Methinks I see the Departed\r\n_Spirit_ of a Believer, triumphantly carried thro' the Devils\r\n_Territories_, in such a stately and Fiery Chariot, as the\r\n_Spiritualizing Body of Elias_ had; methink I see the Devil, with whole\r\nFlocks of _Harpies_, grinning at this Child of God, but unable to fasten\r\nany of their griping Talons upon him: And then, upon the utmost edge of\r\nour _Atmosphaere_, methinks I overhear the holy Soul, with a most\r\nheavenly Gallantry, deriding the defeated Fiend, and saying, _Ah! Satan!\r\nReturn to thy Dungeons again; I am going where thou canst not come for\r\never!_ O 'tis a brave thing so to die! and especially so to die, _in our\r\ntime_. For, tho' when we call to mind, _That the Devils time is now but\r\nshort_, it may almost make us wish to _live_ unto the _end_ of it; and\r\nto say with the Psalmist, _Because the Lord will shortly appear in his\r\nGlory, to build up Zion. O my God! Take me not away in the midst of my\r\ndays._ Yet when we bear in mind, _that the Devils Wrath is now most\r\ngreat_, it would make one willing to be _out of the way_. Inasmuch as\r\nnow is the time for the doing of those things in the prospect whereof\r\n_Balaam_ long ago cry'd out _Who shall live when such things are done!_\r\nWe should not be inordinately loth to _die_ at such a time. In a word,\r\nthe _Times_ are so _bad_, that we may well count it, as _good_ a _time_\r\nto die in, as ever we saw.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Corollary V._\r\n\r\nGood News for the _Israel_ of God, and particularly for his _New-English\r\nIsrael_. If the Devils _Time_ were above a _thousand years ago_,\r\npronounced _short_, what may we suppose it now in _our_ Time? Surely we\r\nare not a _thousand years_ distant from those happy _thousand years_ of\r\nrest and peace, and [which is better] _Holiness_ reserved for the People\r\nof God in the latter days; and if we are not a _thousand years_ yet\r\nshort of that Golden Age, there is cause to think, that we are not an\r\n_hundred_. That the blessed _Thousand years_ are not yet begun, is\r\nabundantly clear from this, _We do not see the Devil bound;_ No, the\r\nDevil was never more let _loose_ than in our Days; and it is very much\r\nthat any should imagine otherwise: But the same thing that proves the\r\n_Thousand Years_ of prosperity for the Church of God, under the whole\r\nHeaven, to be not yet _begun_, does also prove, that it is not very _far\r\noff_; and that is the prodigious _wrath_ with which the Devil does in\r\nour days Persecute, yea, desolate the World. Let us cast our Eyes almost\r\nwhere we will, and we shall see the _Devils_ domineering at such a rate\r\nas may justly fill us with astonishment; it is questionable whether\r\n_Iniquity_ ever were so rampant, or whether _Calamity_ were ever so\r\npungent, as in this Lamentable _time_; We may truly say, _'Tis the Hour\r\nand the Power of Darkness._ But, tho the _wrath_ be so _great_, the\r\n_time_ is but _short_: when we are perplexed with the _wrath_ of the\r\nDevil, the _Word_ of our God at the same time unto us, is that in _Rom.\r\n16.20._ _The God of Peace shall bruise Satan under your feet Shortly._\r\nShortly, didst thou say, dearest Lord! O gladsome word! Amen, _Even so,\r\ncome Lord! Lord Jesus, come quickly! We shall never be rid of this\r\ntroublesome Devil, till thou do come to Chain him up!_\r\n\r\nBut because the people of God, would willingly be told _whereabouts_ we\r\nare, with reference to the _wrath and the time_ of the Devil, you shall\r\ngive me leave humbly to set before you a few _Conjectures_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The first Conjecture._\r\n\r\nThe Devils _Eldest Son_ seems to be towards the _End_ of his last\r\n_Half-time_; and if it be so, the Devils _Whole-time_, cannot but be\r\nvery near its _End_. It is a very scandalous thing that any\r\n_Protestant_, should be at a loss where to find _the Anti-Christ_. But,\r\nwe have a sufficient assurance, that the Duration of _Anti-Christ_, is\r\nto be but for a _Time_, and for _Times_, and for _Half a time_; that is\r\nfor _Twelve hundred and Sixty Years_. And indeed, those _Twelve Hundred\r\nand Sixty Years_, were the very Spott of _Time_ left for the _Devil_,\r\nand meant when 'tis here said, _He has but a short time._ Now, I should\r\nhave an _easie time_ of it, if I were never put upon an _Harder Task_,\r\nthan to produce what might render it extreamly probable, that Antichrist\r\nentred his last _Half-time_, or the last _Hundred_ and _Fourscore_ years\r\nof his Reign, _at_ or soon _after_ the celebrated _Reformation_ which\r\nbegan at the year 1517 in the former century. Indeed, it is very\r\nagreeable to see how Antichrist then lost _Half_ of his Empire; and how\r\nthat _half_ which then became _Reformed_, have been upon many accounts\r\nlittle more than _Half-reformed_. But by this computation, we must needs\r\nbe within a very few years of such a _Mortification_ to befal the See of\r\n_Rome_, as that Antichrist, who has lately been planting (what proves no\r\nmore lasting than) a _Tabernacle in the Glorious Holy Mountain between\r\nthe Seas_, must quickly, _Come to his End and none shall help him_. So\r\nthen, within a very little while, we shall see the Devil stript of the\r\ngrand, yea, the last, _Vehicle_, wherein he will be capable to abuse our\r\nWorld. The _Fires_, with which, _That Beast_ is to be consumed, will so\r\nsinge the Wings of the _Devil_ too, that he shall no more set the\r\nAffairs of _this_ world on _Fire_. Yea, they shall both go into the same\r\n_Fire_, to be _tormented for ever and ever_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Second Conjecture._\r\n\r\nThat which is, perhaps, the greatest Effect of the _Devils Wrath_, seems\r\nto be in a manner at an _end_: and this would make one hope that the\r\n_Devils time_ cannot be far from its _end_. It is in Persecution, that\r\nthe _wrath_ of the Devil uses to break forth, with its greatest fury.\r\nNow there want not probabilities, that the _last Persecution_ intended\r\nfor the Church of God, before the Advent of our Lord, has been upon it.\r\nWhen we see the _second Woe passing away_, we have a fair signal given\r\nunto us, _That the last slaughter of our Lord's Witnesses is over;_ and\r\nthen what Quickly follows? The next thing is, _The Kingdoms of this\r\nWorld, are become the Kingdoms of Our Lord, and of His Christ:_ and then\r\n_down_ goes the Kingdom of the Devil, so that he cannot any more _come\r\ndown_ upon us. Now, the Irrecoverable and Irretrievable Humiliations\r\nthat have lately befallen the _Turkish Power_, are but so many\r\nDeclarations of the _second Woe passing away_. And the dealings of God\r\nwith the _European_ parts of the world, at this day, do further\r\nstrengthen this our expectation. We _do_ see, _at this hour a great\r\nEarth-quake all Europe over_: and we _shall_ see, that this _great\r\nEarth-quake_, and these great Commotions, will but contribute unto the\r\nadvancement of our Lords hitherto-depressed Interests. 'Tis also to be\r\nremark'd that, a disposition to recognize the _Empire_ of God over the\r\n_Conscience_ of man, does now prevail more in the world than formerly;\r\nand God from on High more touches the Hearts of Princes and Rulers with\r\nan averseness to Persecution. 'Tis particularly the unspeakable\r\nhappiness of the English Nation, to be under the Influences of that\r\nexcellent Queen, who could say, _In as much as a man cannot make himself\r\nbelieve what he will, why should we Persecute men for not believing as\r\nwe do! I wish I could see all good men of one mind; but in the mean time\r\nI pray, let them however love one another._ Words worthy to be written\r\nin Letters of Gold! and by _us_ the more to be considered, because to\r\none of _Ours_ did that royal Person express Her self so excellently, so\r\nobligingly. When the late King _James_ published his Declaration for\r\n_Liberty of Conscience_, a worthy Divine in the Church of _England_,\r\nthen studying the _Revelation_, saw cause upon _Revelational_ Grounds,\r\nto declare himself in such words as these, _Whatsoever others may intend\r\nor design by this Liberty of Conscience, I cannot believe, that it will\r\never be recalled in +England+, as long as the World stands._ And you\r\nknow how miraculously the _Earth-quake_ which then immediately came upon\r\nthe Kingdom, has established that _Liberty_! But that which exceeds all\r\nthe tendencies this way, is, the dispensation of God at this Day,\r\ntowards the blessed _Vaudois_. Those renowned _Waldenses_, which were a\r\nsort of _Root_ unto all Protestant Churches, were never dissipated, by\r\nall the Persecutions of many Ages, till within these few years, the\r\n_French_ King and the Duke of _Savoy_ leagued for their dissipation. But\r\njust _Three years and a half after_ the _scattering_ of that holy\r\npeople, to the surprise of all the World, _Spirit of life from God_ is\r\ncome into them; and having with a thousand Miracles repossessed\r\nthemselves of their antient Seats, their hot _Persecutor_ is become\r\ntheir great _Protector_. Whereupon the reflection of the worthy person,\r\nthat writes the story is, _The Churches of +Piemont+, being the Root of\r\nthe Protestant Churches, they have been the first established; the\r\nChurches of other places, being but the Branches, shall be established\r\nin due time, God will deliver them speedily, He has already delivered\r\nthe Mother, and He will not long leave the Daughter behind: He will\r\nfinish what he has gloriously begun!_\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Third Conjecture._\r\n\r\nThere is a _little room_ for hope, that the _great wrath_ of the Devil,\r\nwill not prove the present ruine of our poor _New-England_ in\r\nparticular. I believe, there never was a poor Plantation, more pursued\r\nby the _wrath_ of the _Devil_, than our poor _New-England_; and that\r\nwhich makes our condition very much the more deplorable is, that the\r\n_wrath_ of the _great God_ Himself, at the same time also presses hard\r\nupon us. It was a rousing _alarm_ to the Devil, when a great Company of\r\nEnglish _Protestants_ and _Puritans_, came to erect Evangelical\r\nChurches, in a corner of the World, where he had reign'd without any\r\ncontroul for many Ages; and it is a vexing _Eye-sore_ to the Devil, that\r\nour Lord Christ should be known, and own'd, and preached in this\r\n_howling Wilderness_. Wherefor he has left no _Stone unturned_, that so\r\nhe might undermine his Plantation, and force us out of our Country.\r\n\r\nFirst, The Indian _Powawes_, used all their Sorceries to molest the\r\nfirst Planters here; but God said unto them, _Touch them not!_ Then,\r\n_Seducing Spirits_ came to _root_ in this Vineyard, but God so rated\r\nthem off, that they have not prevail'd much farther than the Edges of\r\nour Land. After this, we have had a continual _blast_ upon some of our\r\nprincipal Grain, annually diminishing a vast part of our _ordinary\r\nFood_. Herewithal, wasting _Sicknesses_, especially Burning and Mortal\r\nAgues, have Shot the Arrows of Death in at our Windows. Next, we have\r\nhad many Adversaries of our own Language, who have been perpetually\r\nassaying to deprive us of those _English Liberties_, in the\r\nencouragement whereof these Territories have been settled. As if this\r\nhad not been enough; The _Tawnies_ among whom we came, have watered our\r\nSoil with the Blood of many Hundreds of our Inhabitants. Desolating\r\n_Fires_ also have many times laid the chief Treasure of the whole\r\nProvince in Ashes. As for _Losses_ by Sea, _they_ have been multiply'd\r\nupon us: and particularly in the present _French War_, the whole English\r\nNation have observ'd that no part of the Nation has proportionably had\r\nso many Vessels taken, as our poor _New-England_. Besides all which, now\r\nat last the Devils are (if I may so speak) _in Person_ come down upon us\r\nwith such a _Wrath_, as is justly _much_, and will quickly be _more_,\r\nthe Astonishment of the World. Alas, I may sigh over _this_ Wilderness,\r\nas _Moses_ did over _his_, in _Psal. 90.7, 9._ _We are consumed by thine\r\nAnger, and by thy Wrath we are troubled: All our days are passed away in\r\nthy Wrath._ And I may add this unto it, _The Wrath of the Devil too has\r\nbeen troubling and spending of us, all our days._\r\n\r\nBut what will become of this poor _New-England_ after all? Shall we\r\nsink, expire, perish, before the _short time_ of the Devil shall be\r\nfinished? I must confess, That when I consider the lamentable\r\n_Unfruitfulness_ of men, among us, under as powerful and perspicuous\r\nDispensations of the Gospel, as are in the World; and when I consider\r\nthe declining state of the _Power of Godliness_ in our Churches, with\r\nthe most horrible Indisposition that perhaps ever was, to recover out of\r\nthis declension; I cannot but _Fear_ lest it comes to this, and lest an\r\n_Asiatic_ Removal of Candlesticks come upon us. But upon some other\r\nAccounts, I would fain _hope_ otherwise; and I will give _you_\r\ntherefore the opportunity to try what Inferences may be drawn from these\r\nprobable Prognostications.\r\n\r\nI say, _First_, That surely, _America's_ Fate, must at the long run\r\ninclude _New-Englands_ in it. What was the design of our God, in\r\nbringing over so many _Europaeans_ hither of later years? Of what use or\r\nstate will _America_ be, when the _Kingdom of God_ shall come? If it\r\nmust all be the Devils propriety, while the _saved Nations_ of the other\r\nHaemisphere shall be _Walking in the Light of the New Jerusalem_, Our\r\n_New-England_ has then, 'tis likely, done all that it was erected for.\r\nBut if God have a purpose to make here a seat for any of _those glorious\r\nthings which are spoken of thee, O thou City of God_; then even thou, _O\r\nNew-England_, art within a very little while of better days than ever\r\nyet have dawn'd upon thee.\r\n\r\nI say, _Secondly_, That tho' there be very _Threatning_ Symptoms on\r\n_America_, yet there are some _hopeful_ ones. I confess, when one thinks\r\nupon the crying Barbarities with which the most of those _Europaeans_\r\nthat have Peopled this New world, became the Masters of it; it looks but\r\n_Ominously_. When one also thinks how much the way of living in many\r\nparts of _America_, is utterly inconsistent with the very Essentials of\r\n_Christianity_; yea, how much Injury and Violence is therein done to\r\n_Humanity_ it self; it is enough to damp the Hopes of the most Sanguine\r\nComplexion. And the _Frown_ of Heaven which has hitherto been upon\r\nAttempts of better Gospellizing the Plantations, considered, will but\r\nincrease the _Damp_. Nevertheless, on the other side, what shall be said\r\nof all the _Promises_, That _our Lord Jesus Christ shall have the\r\nuttermost parts of the Earth for his Possession?_ and of all the\r\n_Prophecies_, That _All the ends of the Earth shall remember and turn\r\nunto the Lord?_ Or does it look _agreeably_, That such a rich quarter of\r\nthe World, equal in some regards to all the rest, should never be out of\r\nthe _Devils_ hands, from the first Inhabitation unto the last\r\nDissolution of it? No sure; why may not the _last_ be the _first_? and\r\nthe _Sun of Righteousness_ come to shine _brightest_, in Climates which\r\nit rose _latest_ upon!\r\n\r\nI say, _Thirdly_, That _as_ it fares with _Old England_, so it will be\r\nmost likely to fare with _New-England_. For which cause, by the way,\r\nthere may be more of the Divine Favour in the present Circumstances of\r\nour dependence on _England_, than we are well aware of. This is very\r\nsure, if matters _go ill_ with our _Mother_, her poor American\r\n_Daughter_ here, must feel it; nor could our former Happy Settlement\r\nhave hindred our sympathy in that Unhappiness. But if matters _go Well_\r\nin the Three Kingdoms; as long as God shall bless the English Nation,\r\nwith Rulers that shall encourage _Piety_, _Honesty_, _Industry_, in\r\ntheir Subjects, and that shall cast a Benign Aspect upon the Interests\r\nof our Glorious Gospel, _Abroad_ as well as at _Home_; so long,\r\n_New-England_ will at least keep its head above water: and so much the\r\nmore, for our comfortable Settlement in such a Form as we are now cast\r\ninto. Unless there should be any singular, destroying, _Topical\r\nPlagues_, whereby an offended God should at last make us _Rise_; But,\r\n_Alas, O Lord, what other Hive hast thou provided for us!_\r\n\r\nI say, _Fourthly_, That the _Elder England_ will certainly and speedily\r\nbe Visited with the _ancient loving kindness_ of God. When one sees, how\r\nstrangely the Curse of our _Joshua_, has fallen upon the Persons and\r\nHouses of them that have attempted the Rebuilding of the _Old_ Romish\r\n_Jericho_, which has there been so far demolished, they cannot but say,\r\nThat the _Reformation_ there, shall not only be maintained, but also\r\npursued, proceeded, perfected; and that God will shortly there have a\r\n_New Jerusalem_. Or, Let a Man in his thoughts run over but the series\r\nof amazing Providences towards the English Nation for the last _Thirty\r\nYears_: Let him reflect, how many _Plots_ for the ruine of the Nation,\r\nhave been strangely discovered? yea, how very unaccountably those very\r\n_Persons_, yea, I may also say, and those very _Methods_ which were\r\nintended for the tools of that ruine, have become the instruments or\r\noccasions of Deliverances? A man cannot but say upon these Reflections,\r\nas the Wife of _Manoah_ once prudently expressed her self, _If the Lord\r\nwere pleased to have Destroyed us, He would not have shew'd us all these\r\nthings._ Indeed, It is not unlikely, that the Enemies of the English\r\nNation, may yet provoke such a _Shake_ unto it, as may perhaps exceed\r\nany that has hitherto been undergone: the Lord prevent the Machinations\r\nof his Adversaries! But that _shake_ will usher in the most _glorious\r\nTimes_ that ever arose upon the English _Horizon_. As for the _French_\r\nCloud which hangs over _England_, tho' it be like to Rain showers of\r\n_Blood_ upon a Nation, where the _Blood_ of the Blessed Jesus has been\r\ntoo much treated as an _Unholy Thing_; yet I believe God will shortly\r\nscatter it: and my belief is grounded upon a bottom that will bear it.\r\nIf that overgrown _French Leviathan_ should accomplish any thing like a\r\nConquest of _England_, what could there be to hinder him from the\r\nUniversal Empire of the _West_? But the _Visions_ of the Western World,\r\nin the _Views_ both of _Daniel_ and of _John_, do assure us, that\r\nwhatever Monarch, shall while the _Papacy_ continues go to swallow up\r\nthe _Ten Kings_ which received _their Power_ upon the Fall of the\r\nWestern Empire, he must miscarry in the Attempt. The _French Phaetons_\r\nEpitaph seems written in that, _Sure Word of Prophecy_.\r\n\r\n[Since the making of this Conjecture, there are arriv'd unto us, the\r\nNews of a Victory obtain'd by the _English_ over the _French_, which\r\nfurther confirms our Conjecture; and causes us to sing, _Pharaohs\r\nChariots, and his Hosts, has the Lord cast down into the Sea; Thy\r\nright-hand has dashed in pieces the Enemy!_]\r\n\r\nNow, _In the Salvation of_ England, the Plantations cannot but\r\n_Rejoyce_, and _New-England_ also will _be Glad_.\r\n\r\nBut so much for our _Corollaries_, I hasten to the main thing designed\r\nfor your entertainment. And that is,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN HORTATORY AND NECESSARY ADDRESS,\r\n\r\nTO A COUNTRY NOW EXTRAORDINARILY ALARUM'D\r\n\r\nBY THE WRATH OF THE DEVIL.\r\n\r\nTIS THIS,\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now make a good and a right use of the prodigious _descent_ which\r\nthe _Devil_ in _Great Wrath_ is at this day making upon our Land. Upon\r\nthe Death of a Great Man once, an Orator call'd the Town together,\r\ncrying out, _Concurrite Cives, Dilapsa sunt vestra Moenia!_ that is,\r\n_Come together, Neighbours, your Town-Walls are fallen down!_ But such\r\nis the descent of the Devil at this day upon our selves, that I may\r\ntruly tell you, _The Walls of the whole World are broken down!_ The\r\nusual _Walls_ of defence about mankind have such a Gap made in them,\r\nthat the very _Devils_ are broke in upon us, to seduce the _Souls_,\r\ntorment the _Bodies_, sully the _Credits_, and consume the _Estates_ of\r\nour Neighbours, with Impressions both as _real_ and as _furious_, as if\r\nthe _Invisible_ World were becoming _Incarnate_, on purpose for the\r\nvexing of us. And what use ought now to be made of so tremendous a\r\ndispensation? We are engaged in a _Fast_ this day; but shall we try to\r\nfetch _Meat out of the Eater_, and make the _Lion_ to afford some _Hony_\r\nfor our _Souls_?\r\n\r\nThat the Devil is _come down unto us with great Wrath_, we find, we\r\nfeel, we now deplore. In many ways, for many years hath the Devil been\r\nassaying to Extirpate the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus here. _New-England_\r\nmay complain of the Devil, as in _Psal. 129.1, 2._ _Many a time have they\r\nafflicted me, from my Youth, may +New-England+ now say; many a time have\r\nthey afflicted me from my Youth; yet they have not prevailed against\r\nme._ But now there is a more than ordinary _affliction_, with which the\r\n_Devil_ is Galling of us: and such an one as is indeed Unparallelable.\r\nThe things confessed by _Witches_, and the things endured by _Others_,\r\nlaid together, amount unto this account of our _Affliction_. The\r\n_Devil_, Exhibiting himself ordinarily as a small _Black man_, has\r\ndecoy'd a fearful knot of proud, froward, ignorant, envious and\r\nmalicious creatures, to lift themselves in his horrid Service, by\r\nentring their Names in a _Book_ by him tendred unto them. These\r\n_Witches_, whereof above a Score have now _Confessed, and shown their\r\nDeeds_, and some are now tormented by the Devils, for _Confessing_, have\r\nmet in Hellish _Randezvouzes_, wherein the Confessors do say, they have\r\nhad their diabolical Sacraments, imitating the _Baptism_ and the\r\n_Supper_ of our Lord. In these hellish meetings, these Monsters have\r\nassociated themselves to do no less a thing than, _To destroy the\r\nKingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, in these parts of the World;_ and in\r\norder hereunto, First they each of them have their _Spectres_, or\r\nDevils, commission'd by them, & representing of them, to be the Engines\r\nof their Malice. By these wicked _Spectres_, they seize poor people\r\nabout the Country, with various & bloudy _Torments_; and of those\r\nevidently Preternatural torments there are some have dy'd. They have\r\nbewitched some, even so far as to make _Self-destroyers_: and others\r\nare in many Towns here and there languishing under their _Evil hands_.\r\nThe people thus afflicted, are miserably scratched and bitten, so that\r\nthe Marks are most visible to all the World, but the causes utterly\r\ninvisible; and the same Invisible Furies do most visibly stick Pins into\r\nthe bodies of the afflicted, and _scale_ them, and hideously distort,\r\nand disjoint all their members, besides a thousand other sorts of\r\nPlagues beyond these of any natural diseases which they give unto them.\r\nYea, they sometimes drag the poor people out of their chambers, and\r\ncarry them over Trees and Hills, for divers miles together. A large part\r\nof the persons tortured by these Diabolical _Spectres_, are horribly\r\ntempted by them, sometimes with fair promises, and sometimes with hard\r\nthreatnings, but always with felt miseries, to sign the _Devils Laws_ in\r\na Spectral Book laid before them; which two or three of these poor\r\nSufferers, being by their tiresome sufferings overcome to do, they have\r\nimmediately been released from all their miseries and they appear'd in\r\n_Spectre_ then to Torture those that were before their Fellow-Sufferers.\r\nThe _Witches_ which by their covenant with the Devil, are become Owners\r\nof _Spectres_, are oftentimes by their own _Spectres_ required and\r\ncompelled to give their consent, for the molestation of some, which they\r\nhad no mind otherwise to fall upon; and cruel depredations are then made\r\nupon the Vicinage. In the Prosecution of these Witchcrafts, among a\r\nthousand other unaccountable things, the _Spectres_ have an odd faculty\r\nof cloathing the most substantial and corporeal Instruments of Torture,\r\nwith Invisibility, while the wounds thereby given have been the most\r\npalpable things in the World; so that the Sufferers assaulted with\r\nInstruments of Iron, wholly unseen to the standers by, though, to their\r\ncost, seen by themselves, have, upon snatching, wrested the Instruments\r\nout of the _Spectres_ hands, and every one has then immediately not only\r\n_beheld_, but _handled_, an Iron Instrument taken by a Devil from a\r\nNeighbour. These wicked _Spectres_ have proceeded so far, as to steal\r\nseveral quantities of Mony from divers people, part of which Money, has,\r\nbefore sufficient Spectators, been dropt out of the Air into the Hands\r\nof the Sufferers, while the _Spectres_ have been urging them to\r\nsubscribe their _Covenant with Death_. In such extravagant ways have\r\nthese Wretches propounded, the _Dragooning_ of as many as they can, in\r\ntheir own Combination, and the _Destroying_ of others, with lingring,\r\nspreading, deadly diseases; till our Countrey should at last become too\r\nhot for us. Among the Ghastly Instances of the _success_ which those\r\nBloody Witches have had, we have seen even some of their own Children,\r\nso dedicated unto the Devil, that in their Infancy, it is found, the\r\n_Imps_ have sucked them, and rendred them Venemous to a Prodigy. We have\r\nalso seen the Devils first batteries upon the Town, where the first\r\nChurch of our Lord in this Colony was gathered, producing those\r\ndistractions, which have almost ruin'd the Town. We have seen likewise\r\nthe _Plague_ reaching afterwards into other Towns far and near, where\r\nthe Houses of good Men have the Devils filling of them with terrible\r\nVexations!\r\n\r\nThis is the Descent, which, it seems, the Devil has now made upon us.\r\nBut that which makes this Descent the more formidable, is; The\r\n_multitude_ and _quality_ of Persons accused of an interest in this\r\n_Witchcraft_, by the Efficacy of the _Spectres_ which take their Name\r\nand shape upon them; causing very many good and wise Men to fear, That\r\nmany _innocent_, yea, and some _vertuous_ persons, are by the Devils in\r\nthis matter, imposed upon; That the Devils have obtain'd the power, to\r\ntake on them the likeness of harmless people, and in that likeness to\r\nafflict other people, and be so abused by Praestigious _Daemons_, that\r\nupon their look or touch, the afflicted shall be odly affected.\r\nArguments from the _Providence of God_, on the one side, and from our\r\n_Charity_ towards _Man_ on the other side, have made this now to become\r\na most agitated Controversie among us. There is an _Agony_ produced in\r\nthe Minds of Men, lest the Devil should sham us with _Devices_, of\r\nperhaps a finer Thred, than was ever yet practised upon the World. The\r\nwhole business is become hereupon so _Snarled_, and the determination of\r\nthe Question one way or another, so _dismal_, that our Honourable Judges\r\nhave a Room for _Jehoshaphat's_ Exclamation, _We know not what to do!_\r\nThey have used, as Judges have heretofore done, the _Spectral\r\nEvidences_, to introduce their further Enquiries into the _Lives_ of the\r\npersons accused; and they have thereupon, by the wonderful Providence of\r\nGod, been so strengthened with _other evidences_, that some of the\r\n_Witch Gang_ have been fairly Executed. But what shall be done, as to\r\nthose against whom the _evidence_ is chiefly founded in the _dark\r\nworld_? Here they do solemnly demand our Addresses to the _Father of\r\nLights_, on their behalf. But in the mean time, the Devil improves the\r\n_Darkness_ of this Affair, to push us into a _Blind Mans Buffet_, and we\r\nare even ready to be _sinfully_, yea, hotly, and madly, mauling one\r\nanother in the _dark_.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of these things, every _considerate_ Man trembles at;\r\nand the more, because the frequent cheats of Passion, and Rumour, do\r\nprecipitate so many, that I wish I could say, The most were\r\n_considerate_.\r\n\r\nBut that which carries on the formidableness of our Trials, unto that\r\nwhich may be called, _A wrath unto the uttermost_, is this: It is not\r\nwithout the _wrath_ of the Almighty _God_ himself, that the _Devil_ is\r\npermitted thus to come down upon us in _wrath_. It was said, in _Isa.\r\n9.19._ _Through the wrath of the Lord of Hosts, the Land is darkned._\r\nOur Land is _darkned_ indeed; since the _Powers of Darkness_ are turned\r\nin upon us: 'tis a _dark time_, yea a black night indeed, now the\r\n_Ty-dogs_ of the Pit are abroad among us: but, _It is through the wrath\r\nof the Lord of Hosts!_ Inasmuch as the _Fire-brands_ of _Hell_ it self\r\nare used for the scorching of us, with cause enough may we cry out,\r\n_What means the heat of this anger?_ Blessed Lord! Are all the other\r\nInstruments of thy Vengeance, too good for the chastisement of such\r\ntransgressors as we are? Must the very _Devils_ be sent out of _Their\r\nown place_, to be our Troublers: Must we be lash'd with _Scorpions_,\r\nfetch'd from the _Place of Torment_? Must this _Wilderness_ be made a\r\nReceptacle for the _Dragons of the Wilderness_? If a _Lapland_ should\r\nnourish in it vast numbers, the successors of the old _Biarmi_, who can\r\nwith looks or words bewitch other people, or sell Winds to Marriners,\r\nand have their _Familiar Spirits_ which they bequeath to their Children\r\nwhen they die, and by their Enchanted Kettle-Drums can learn things done\r\na Thousand Leagues off; If a _Swedeland_ should afford a Village, where\r\nsome scores of Haggs, may not only have their Meetings with _Familiar\r\nSpirits_, but also by their Enchantments drag many scores of poor\r\nchildren out of their Bed-chambers, to be spoiled at those Meetings;\r\nThis, were not altogether a matter of so much wonder! But that\r\n_New-England_ should this way be harassed! They are not _Chaldeans_,\r\nthat _Bitter and Hasty Nation_, but they are, _Bitter and Burning\r\nDevils_; They are not _Swarthy Indians_, but they are _Sooty Devils_;\r\nthat are let loose upon us. Ah, Poor _New-England_! Must the plague of\r\n_Old Aegypt_ come upon thee? Whereof we read in _Psal. 78.49._ _He cast\r\nupon them the fierceness of his Anger, Wrath, and Indignation, and\r\nTrouble, by sending Evil Angels among them._ What, O what must next be\r\nlooked for? Must that which is there next mentioned, be next\r\nencountered? _He spared not their soul from death, but gave their life\r\nover to the Pestilence._ For my part, when I consider what _Melancthon_\r\nsays, in one of his Epistles, _That these Diabolical Spectacles are\r\noften Prodigies;_ and when I consider, how often people have been by\r\n_Spectres_ called upon, just before their Deaths; I am verily afraid,\r\nlest some wasting _Mortality_ be among the things, which this Plague is\r\nthe _Forerunner_ of. I pray God prevent it!\r\n\r\nBut now, _What shall we do?_\r\n\r\n_I._ Let the Devils _coming down_ in _great wrath_ upon us, cause us to\r\n_come down_ in _great grief_ before the Lord. We may truly and sadly\r\nsay, _We are brought very low!_ _Low_ indeed, when the Serpents of the\r\ndust, are crawling and coyling about us, and Insulting over us. May we\r\nnot say, _We are in the very belly of Hell_, when _Hell_ it self is\r\nfeeding upon us? But how _Low_ is that! O let us then most penitently\r\nlay our selves very _Low_ before the God of Heaven, who has thus Abased\r\nus. When a Truculent _Nero_, a _Devil_ of a Man, was turned in upon the\r\nWorld, it was said, in _1 Pet. 5.6._ _Humble your selves under the mighty\r\nhand of God._ How much more now ought we to _humble our selves_ under\r\nthat _Mighty Hand_ of that God who indeed has the _Devil_ in a _Chain_,\r\nbut has horribly lengthened out the _Chain_! When the old people of God\r\nheard any _Blasphemies_, tearing of his Ever-Blessed Name to pieces,\r\nthey were to _Rend their Cloaths_ at what they heard. I am sure that we\r\nhave cause to _Rend our Hearts_ this Day, when we see what an High\r\nTreason has been committed against the most high God, by the Witchcrafts\r\nin our Neighbourhood. We may say; and shall we not be _humbled_ when we\r\nsay it? _We have seen an horrible thing done in our Land!_ O 'tis a most\r\nhumbling thing, to think, that ever there should be such an abomination\r\namong us, as for a crue of humane race, to renounce their _Maker_, and\r\nto unite with the _Devil_, for the troubling of mankind, and for People\r\nto be, (as is by some confess'd) _Baptized_ by a _Fiend_ using this form\r\nupon them, _Thou art mine, and I have a full power over thee!_\r\nafterwards communicating in an Hellish _Bread_ and _Wine_, by that Fiend\r\nadministred unto them. It was said in _Deut. 18.10, 11, 12._ _There shall\r\nnot be found among you an Inchanter, or a Witch, or a Charmer, or a\r\nConsulter with Familiar Spirits, or a Wizzard, or a Necromancer; For all\r\nthat do these things are an Abomination to the Lord, and because of\r\nthese Abominations, the Lord thy God doth drive them out before thee._\r\nThat _New-England_ now should have these _Abominations_ in it, yea, that\r\nsome of no mean _Profession_, should be found guilty of them: Alas, what\r\n_Humiliations_ are we all hereby oblig'd unto? O 'tis a _Defiled Land_,\r\nwherein we live; Let us be humbled for these _Defiling Abominations_,\r\nlest we be driven out of our Land. It's a very _humbling_ thing to\r\nthink, what reproaches will be cast upon us, for this matter, among _The\r\nDaughters of the Philistines_. Indeed, enough might easily be said for\r\nthe vindication of _this_ Country from the _Singularity_ of this matter,\r\nby ripping up, what has been discovered in _others_. _Great Brittain_\r\nalone, and this also in our days of _Greatest Light_, has had that in\r\nit, which may divert the Calumnies of an ill-natured World, from\r\ncentring here. They are words of the Devout Bishop _Hall_, _Satans\r\nprevalency in this Age, is most clear in the marvellous Number of\r\nWitches, abounding in all places. Now Hundreds are discovered in one\r\nShire; and, if Fame Deceives us not, in a Village of Fourteen Houses in\r\nthe North, are found so many of this Damned Brood. Yea, and those of\r\nboth Sexes, who have Professed much Knowledge, Holiness, and Devotion,\r\nare drawn into this Damnable Practice._ I suppose the Doctor in the\r\nfirst of those Passages, may refer to what happened in the Year 1645.\r\nWhen so many Vassals of the Devil were Detected, that there were\r\n_Thirty_ try'd at one time, whereas about _fourteen_ were Hang'd, and an\r\nHundred more detained in the Prisons of _Suffolk_ and _Essex_. Among\r\nother things which many of these Acknowledged, one was, That they were\r\nto undergo certain _Punishments_, if they did not such and such _Hurts_,\r\nas were appointed them. And, among the rest that were then Executed,\r\nthere was an Old Parson, called _Lowis_, who confessed, That he had a\r\ncouple of _Imps_, whereof _one_ was always putting him upon the doing of\r\nMischief; Once particularly, that _Imp_ calling for his Consent so to\r\ndo, went immediately and Sunk a _Ship_, then under Sail. I pray, let not\r\n_New-England_ become of an Unsavoury and a Sulphurous Resentment in the\r\nOpinion of the World abroad, for the Doleful things which are now fallen\r\nout among us, while there are such _Histories_ of other places abroad in\r\nthe World. Nevertheless, I am sure that _we_, the People of\r\n_New-England_, have cause enough to _Humble_ our selves under our most\r\n_Humbling_ Circumstances. We must no more be _Haughty, because of the\r\nLords Holy Mountain among us_; No it becomes us rather to be, _Humble,\r\nbecause we have been such an Habitation of Unholy Devils_!\r\n\r\n_II._ Since the Devil is _come down in great wrath_ upon us, let not us\r\nin our _great wrath_ against one another provide a _Lodging_ for him. It\r\nwas a most wholesome caution, in _Eph. 4.26, 27._ _Let not the Sun go\r\ndown upon your wrath: Neither give place to the Devil._ The Devil is\r\ncome down to see what _Quarter_ he shall find among us: And if his\r\ncoming down, do now fill us with _wrath_ against one another, and if\r\nbetween the cause of the _Sufferers_ on one hand, and the cause of the\r\n_Suspected_ on t'other, we carry things to such extreams of _Passion_ as\r\nare now gaining upon us, the Devil will Bless himself, to find such a\r\nconvenient _Lodging_ as we shall therein afford unto him. And it may be\r\nthat the _wrath_ which we have had against one another has had more than\r\na little influence upon the coming down of the Devil in that _wrath_\r\nwhich now amazes us. Have not many of us been _Devils_ one unto another\r\nfor Slanderings, for Backbitings, for Animosities? For _this_, among\r\nother causes, perhaps, God has permitted the Devils to be worrying, as\r\nthey now are, among us. But it is high time to leave off all _Devilism_,\r\nwhen the _Devil_ himself is falling upon us: And it is _no time_ for us\r\nto be Censuring and Reviling one another, with a _Devilish wrath_, when\r\nthe _wrath_ of the _Devil_ is annoying of us. The way for us to out-wit\r\nthe Devil, in the _Wiles_ with which he now _Vexes_ us, would be for us\r\nto joyn as one man in our cries to God, for the Directing, and Issuing\r\nof this Thorny Business; but if we do not _Lift up_ our Hands to\r\nHeaven, _without Wrath_, we cannot then do it _without Doubt_, of\r\nspeeding in it. I am ashamed when I read French Authors giving this\r\nCharacter of Englishmen [_Ils se haissent Les uns les autres, & sont en\r\nDivision Continuelle._] _They hate one another, and are always\r\nQuarrelling one with another._ And I shall be much more ashamed, if it\r\nbecome the Character of _New-Englanders_; which is indeed what the Devil\r\nwould have. _Satan_ would make us _bruise_ one another, by breaking of\r\nthe _Peace_ among us; but O let us disappoint him. We read of a thing\r\nthat sometimes happens to the _Devil_, when he is foaming with his\r\n_Wrath_, in _Mar. 12.43._ _The unclean Spirit seeks rest, and finds none._\r\nBut we give _rest_ unto the Devil, by _wrath_ one against another. If we\r\nwould lay aside all fierceness, and keenness, in the disputes which the\r\nDevil has raised among us; and if we would use to one another none but\r\nthe _soft Answers, which turn away wrath_: I should hope that we might\r\nlight upon such Counsels, as would quickly Extricate us out of our\r\n_Labyrinths_. But the old _Incendiary_ of the world, is come from Hell,\r\nwith _Sparks_ of Hell-Fire flashing on every side of him; and we make\r\nour selves _Tynder_ to the Sparks. When the Emperour _Henry_ III. kept\r\nthe Feast of _Pentecost_, at the City _Mentz_, there arose a dissension\r\namong some of the people there, which came from words to blows, and at\r\nlast it passed on to the shedding of Blood. After the Tumult was over,\r\nwhen they came to that clause in their Devotions, _Thou hast made this\r\nday Glorious;_ the Devil to the unexpressible Terrour of that vast\r\nAssembly, made the Temple Ring with that Outcry _But I have made this\r\nDay Quarrelsome!_ We are truly come into a day, which by being well\r\nmanaged might be very _Glorious_, for the exterminating of those\r\n_Accursed things_, which have hitherto been the Clogs of our Prosperity;\r\nbut if we make this day _Quarrelsome_, thro' any _Raging Confidences_,\r\nAlas, O Lord, _my Flesh Trembles for Fear of thee, and I am afraid of\r\nthy Judgments._ _Erasmus_, among other Historians, tells us, that at a\r\nTown in _Germany_, a Witch or Devil, appeared on the Top of a Chimney,\r\nThreatning to set the Town on _Fire_: And at length, Scattering a Pot of\r\nAshes abroad, the Town was presently and horribly Burnt unto the Ground.\r\nMethinks, I see the _Spectres_, from the Top of the Chimneys to the\r\nNorthward, threatning to scatter _Fire_, about the Countrey; but let us\r\nquench that _Fire_, by the most amicable Correspondencies: Lest, as the\r\n_Spectres_, have, they say, already most Literally burnt some of our\r\nDwellings there do come forth a further _Fire_ from the _Brambles_ of\r\nHell, which may more terribly _Devour_ us. Let us not be like a\r\n_Troubled House_, altho' we are so much haunted by the _Devils_. Let our\r\n_Long suffering_ be a well-placed piece of _Armour_, about us, against\r\nthe _Fiery Darts_ of the wicked ones. History informs us, That so long\r\nago, as the year, 858, a certain Pestilent and Malignant sort of a\r\n_Daemon_, molested _Caumont_ in _Germany_ with all sorts of methods to\r\nstir up strife among the Citizens. He uttered Prophecies, he detected\r\nVillanies, he branded people with all kind of Infamies. He incensed the\r\nNeighbourhood against one Man particularly, as the cause of all the\r\nmischiefs: who yet proved himself innocent. He threw stones at the\r\nInhabitants, and at length burnt their Habitations, till the Commission\r\nof the _Daemon_ could go no further. I say, Let us be well aware lest\r\nsuch _Daemons_ do _Come hither also_.\r\n\r\n_III._ Inasmuch as the Devil is come down in _Great Wrath_, we had need\r\nLabour, with all the Care and Speed we can to Divert the _Great Wrath_\r\nof Heaven from coming at the same time upon us. The God of Heaven has\r\nwith long and loud Admonitions, been calling us to _a Reformation of our\r\nProvoking Evils_, as the only way to avoid that _Wrath_ of His, which\r\ndoes not only _Threaten_ but _Consume_ us. 'Tis because we have been\r\nDeaf to those _Calls_ that we are now by a provoked God, laid open to\r\nthe _Wrath_ of the Devil himself. It is said in _Pr. 16.17._ _When a mans\r\nways please the Lord, he maketh even his Enemies to be at peace with\r\nhim._ The Devil is our grand _Enemy_; and tho' we would not be at peace\r\n_with_ him, yet we would be at peace from him, that is, we would have\r\nhim unable to disquiet our _peace_. But inasmuch as the _wrath_ which we\r\nendure from this _Enemy_, will allow us no _peace_, we may be sure, _our\r\nways have not pleased the Lord._ It is because we have _broken the\r\nhedge_ of Gods _Precepts_, that the hedge of Gods _Providence_ is not so\r\nentire as it uses to be about us; but _Serpents_ are _biting_ of us. O\r\nlet us then set our selves to make our _peace_ with our God, whom we\r\nhave _displeased_ by our iniquities: and let us not imagine that we can\r\nencounter the _Wrath_ of the Devil, while there is the _Wrath_ of God\r\nAlmighty to set that Mastiff upon us. REFORMATION! REFORMATION! has been\r\nthe repeated _Cry_ of all the Judgments that have hitherto been upon us;\r\nbecause we have been as _deaf Adders_ thereunto, the _Adders_ of the\r\nInfernal Pit are now hissing about us. At length, as it was of old said,\r\n_Luke 16.30._ _If one went unto them from the dead, they will repent;_\r\neven so, there are some come unto us from the _Damned_. The great God\r\nhas loosed the Bars of the Pit, so that many _damned Spirits_ are come\r\nin among us, to make us _repent_ of our Misdemeanours. The means which\r\nthe Lord had formerly employ'd for our _awakening_, were such, that he\r\nmight well have said, _What could I have done more?_ and yet after all,\r\nhe has done _more_, in some regards, than was ever done for the\r\nawakening of any People in the World. The things now done to awaken our\r\nEnquiries after our _provoking Evils_, and our endeavours to Reform\r\nthose Evils, are most _extraordinary_ things; for which cause I would\r\nfreely speak it, if we now do not some _extraordinary_ things in\r\nreturning to God; we are the most _incurable_, and I wish it be not\r\nquickly said, the most _miserable_ People under the Sun. Believe me,\r\n'tis a time for all people to do something _extraordinary, in searching\r\nand trying of their ways, and in turning to the Lord_. It is at an\r\n_extraordinary_ rate of _Circumspection_ and _Spiritual mindedness_,\r\nthat we should all now maintain a _walk with God_. At such a time as\r\nthis ought _Magistrates_ to do something _extraordinary_ in promoting of\r\nwhat is laudable, and in restraining and chastising of _Evil Doers_. At\r\nsuch a time as this ought _Ministers_ to do something _extraordinary_ in\r\npulling the Souls of men out of the _Snares_ of the Devil, not only by\r\npublick Preaching, but by personal Visits and Counsels, _from house to\r\nhouse_. At such a time as this ought _Churches_ to do something\r\n_extraordinary_, in _renewing_ of their Covenants, and in _remembring_,\r\nand _reviving_ the Obligations of what they have renewed. Some admirable\r\nDesigns about the _Reformation_ of Manners, have lately been on foot in\r\nthe English Nation, in pursuance of the most excellent Admonitions which\r\nhave been given for it, by the Letters of Their Majesties. Besides the\r\nvigorous Agreements of the _Justices_ here and there in the Kingdom,\r\nassisted by godly Gentlemen and Informers, to Execute the _Laws_ upon\r\nprophane Offenders; there has been started a _Proposal_ for the\r\nwell-affected people in every Parish, to enter into orderly _Societies_,\r\nwhereof every Member shall bind himself, not only to _avoid_\r\nProphaneness in himself, but also according unto to their Place, to do\r\ntheir utmost in first _Reproving_; and, if it must be so, then\r\n_Exposing_, and so _Punishing_, as the Law directs, for others that\r\nshall be guilty. It has been observed, that the English Nation has had\r\nsome of its greatest Successes, upon some special and signal _Actions_\r\nthis way; and a discouragement given under Legal Proceedings of this\r\nkind, must needs be very exercising to the _Wise that observe these\r\nthings_. But, O why should not _New-England_ be the most forward part of\r\nthe English Nation in such _Reformations_? Methinks I hear the Lord from\r\nHeaven saying over us, _O that my People had hearkened unto me; then I\r\nshould soon have subdued the Devils, as well as their other Enemies!_\r\nThere have been some feeble Essays towards _Reformation_ of late in our\r\n_Churches_; but, I pray what comes of them? Do we stay till the _Storm_\r\nof his _Wrath_ be over? Nay, let us be doing what we can, as fast as we\r\ncan, to divert the _Storm_. The Devils having broke in upon our World,\r\nthere is great asking, _Who is it that has brought them in?_ And many\r\ndo by _Spectral_ Exhibitions come to be _cry'd out_ upon. I hope in Gods\r\ntime it will be found, that among those that are thus _cry'd out_ upon,\r\nthere are persons yet _Clear from the great Transgression_; but indeed,\r\nall the _Unreformed_ among us, may justly be _cry'd out_ upon, as having\r\ntoo much of an hand in letting of the Devils into our Borders; 'tis\r\n_our_ Worldliness, _our_ Formality, _our_ Sensuality, and _our_ Iniquity\r\nthat has help'd this letting of the Devils in. O let us then at last,\r\n_consider our ways_. 'Tis a strange passage recorded by Mr. _Clark_ in\r\nthe Life of his Father, That the People of his Parish, refusing to be\r\nReclaimed from their _Sabbath breaking_, by all the zealous Testimonies\r\nwhich that good Man bore against it; at last, on a night after the\r\npeople had retired home from a Revelling Prophanation of the _Lords\r\nDay_, there was heard a great Noise, with rattling of Chains up and down\r\nthe Town, and an horrid Scent of Brimstone fill'd the Neighbourhood.\r\nUpon which the _guilty Consciences_ of the Wretches told them, the Devil\r\nwas come to fetch them away; and it so terrifi'd them, that an Eminent\r\n_Reformation_ follow'd the Sermons which that Man of God Preached\r\nthereupon. Behold, Sinners, behold and _wonder_, lest you _perish_: the\r\nvery _Devils_ are walking about our Streets, with lengthened _Chains_,\r\nmaking a dreadful Noise in our Ears, and _Brimstone_ even without a\r\nMetaphor, is making an hellish and horrid stench in our Nostrils. I pray\r\nleave off all those things whereof your _guilty Consciences_ may now\r\naccuse you, lest these Devils do yet more direfully fall upon you.\r\n_Reformation_ is at this time our only _Preservation_.\r\n\r\n_IV._ When the Devil is come down in _great Wrath_, let every _great\r\nVice_ which may have a more particular tendency to make us a Prey unto\r\nthat _Wrath_, come into a due discredit with us. It is the general\r\nConcession of all men, who are not become too _Unreasonable_ for common\r\nConversation, that the Invitation of _Witchcrafts_ is the thing that has\r\nnow introduced the Devil into the midst of us. I say then, let not only\r\nall _Witchcrafts_ be duly abominated with us, but also let us be duly\r\nwatchful against all the _Steps_ leading thereunto. There are lesser\r\n_Sorceries_ which they say, are too frequent in our Land. As it was said\r\nin _2 King. 17.9._ _The Children of +Israel+ did secretly those things\r\nthat were not right, against the Lord their God._ So 'tis to be feared,\r\nthe Children of _New-England_ have _secretly_ done many things that have\r\nbeen pleasing to the Devil. They say, that in some Towns it has been an\r\nusual thing for People to cure Hurts with _Spells_, or to use detestable\r\nConjurations, with _Sieves_, _Keys_, and _Pease_, and _Nails_, and\r\n_Horse-shoes_, and I know not what other Implements, to learn the things\r\nfor which they have a forbidden, and an impious _Curiosity_. 'Tis in the\r\nDevils Name, that such things are done; and in Gods Name I do this day\r\ncharge them, as vile Impieties. By these Courses 'tis, that People play\r\nupon _The Hole of the Asp_, till that cruelly venemous _Asp_ has pull'd\r\nmany of them into the deep _Hole_ of _Witchcraft_ it self. It has been\r\nacknowledged by some who have sunk the deepest into this _horrible Pit_,\r\nthat they began at these little _Witchcrafts_; on which 'tis pity but\r\nthe Laws of the English Nation, whereby the incorrigible repetition of\r\nthose _Tricks_, is made _Felony_, were severely Executed. From the like\r\nsinful _Curiosity_ it is, that the Prognostications of _Judicial\r\nAstrology_, are so injudiciously regarded by multitudes among us; and\r\naltho' the Jugling _Astrologers_ do scarce ever hit right, except it be\r\nin such _Weighty Judgments_, forsooth, as that many _Old Men_ will die\r\nsuch a year, and that there will be many _Losses_ felt by some that\r\nventure to Sea, and that there will be much _Lying_ and _Cheating_ in\r\nthe World; yet their foolish Admirers will not be perswaded but that the\r\nInnocent _Stars_ have been concern'd in these Events. It is a disgrace\r\nto the English Nation, that the Pamphlets of such idle, futil, trifling\r\n_Stargazers_ are so much considered; and the Countenance hereby given to\r\na Study, wherein at last, all is done by _Impulse_, if any thing be done\r\nto any purpose at all, is not a little perillous to the Souls of Men. It\r\nis (_a Science_, I dare not call it, but) a _Juggle_, whereof the\r\nLearned _Hall_ well says, _It is presumptuous and unwarrantable, and\r\ncry'd ever down by Councils and Fathers, as unlawful, as that which lies\r\nin the mid-way between Magick and Imposture, and partakes not a little\r\nof both._ Men consult the Aspects of Planets, whose Northern or Southern\r\nmotions receive denominations from a _Caelestial Dragon_, till the\r\n_Infernal Dragon_ at length insinuate into them, with a _Poison_ of\r\n_Witchcraft_ that can't be cured. Has there not also been a world of\r\n_discontent_ in our Borders? 'Tis no wonder, that the _fiery Serpents_\r\nare so Stinging of us; We have been a most _Murmuring Generation_. It is\r\nnot Irrational, to ascribe the late Stupendious growth of _Witches_\r\namong us, partly to the bitter _discontents_, which Affliction and\r\nPoverty has fill'd us with: it is inconceivable, what advantage the\r\nDevil gains over men, by _discontent_. Moreover, the Sin of _Unbelief_\r\nmay be reckoned as perhaps the chief _Crime_ of our Land. We are told,\r\n_God swears in wrath, against them that believe not;_ and what follows\r\nthen but this, _That the Devil comes unto them in wrath?_ Never were the\r\noffers of the _Gospel_, more freely tendered, or more basely despised,\r\namong any People under the whole Cope of Heaven, than in this _N. E._\r\nSeems it at all marvellous unto us, that the _Devil_ should get such\r\nfooting in our Country? Why, 'tis because the _Saviour_ has been\r\nslighted here, perhaps more than any where. The Blessed Lord Jesus\r\nChrist has been profering to us, _Grace, and Glory, and every good\r\nthing_, and been alluring of us to Accept of Him, with such Terms as\r\nthese, _Undone Sinner, I am All; Art thou willing that I should be thy\r\nAll?_ But, as a proof of that Contempt which this Unbelief has cast upon\r\nthese proffers, I would seriously ask of the so many Hundreds above a\r\nThousand People within these Walls; which of you all, O how few of you,\r\ncan indeed say, _Christ is mine, and I am his, and he is the Beloved of\r\nmy Soul?_ I would only say thus much: When the precious and glorious\r\nJesus, is Entreating of us to Receive _Him_, in all His _Offices_, with\r\nall His _Benefits_; the Devil minds what Respect we pay unto that\r\nHeavenly Lord; if we _Refuse Him that speaks from Heaven_, then he that,\r\n_Comes from Hell_, does with a sort of claim set in, and cry out, _Lord,\r\nsince this Wretch is not willing that thou shouldst have him, I pray,\r\nlet me have him._ And thus, by the just vengeance of Heaven, the Devil\r\nbecomes a _Master_, a _Prince_, a _God_, unto the miserable Unbelievers:\r\nbut O what are many of them then hurried unto! All of these Evil\r\nThings, do I now set before you, as _Branded_ with the Mark of the Devil\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\n_V._ With _Great Regard_, with _Great Pity_, should we Lay to Heart the\r\nCondition of those, who are cast into Affliction, by the _Great Wrath_\r\nof the Devil. There is a Number of our Good Neighbours, and some of them\r\nvery particularly noted for Goodness and Vertue, of whom we may say,\r\n_Lord, They are vexed with Devils._ Their Tortures being primarily\r\nInflicted on their _Spirits_, may indeed cause the Impressions thereof\r\nupon their Bodies to be the less _Durable_, tho' rather the more\r\n_Sensible_: but they Endure Horrible Things, and many have been actually\r\nMurdered. Hard _Censures_ now bestow'd upon these poor Sufferers, cannot\r\nbut be very Displeasing unto our Lord, who, as He said, about some that\r\nhad been Butchered by a _Pilate_, in _Luc. 13.2, 3._ _Think ye that these\r\nwere Sinners above others, because they suffered such Things? I tell you\r\nNo, But except ye Repent, ye shall all likewise Perish:_ Even so, he now\r\nsays, _Think ye that they who now suffer by the Devil, have been greater\r\nSinners than their Neighbours?_ No, Do you Repent of your _own Sins_,\r\nLest the Devil come to fall foul of _you_, as he has done to _them_. And\r\nif this be so, How _Rash_ a thing would it be, if such of the poor\r\nSufferers, as carry it with a Becoming Piety, Seriousness, and\r\nHumiliation under their present Suffering, should be unjustly\r\n_Censured_; or have their very _Calamity_ imputed unto them as a\r\n_Crime_? It is an easie thing, for us to fall into the Fault of, _Adding\r\nAffliction to the Afflicted_, and of, _Talking to the Grief of those\r\nthat are already wounded_. Nor can it be wisdom to slight the Dangers of\r\nsuch a Fault. In the mean time, We have no Bowels in us, if we do not\r\nCompassionate the Distressed County of _Essex_, now crying to all these\r\nColonies, _Have pity on me, O ye my Friends, Have pity on me, for the\r\nHand of the Lord has Touched me, and the Wrath of the Devil has been\r\ntherewithal turned upon me._ But indeed, if an hearty _pity_ be due to\r\nany, I am sure, the Difficulties which attend our Honourable _Judges_,\r\ndo demand no Inconsiderable share in that _Pity_. What a Difficult, what\r\nan Arduous Task, have those Worthy Personages now upon their Hands? To\r\ncarry the _Knife_ so exactly, that on the one side, there may be no\r\nInnocent Blood Shed, by too unseeing a _Zeal for the Children of\r\nIsrael_; and that on the other side, there may be no Shelter given to\r\nthose Diabolical _Works of Darkness_, without the Removal whereof we\r\nnever shall have _Peace_; or to those _Furies_ whereof several have\r\nkill'd _more people_ perhaps than would serve to make a Village: _Hic\r\nLabor, Hoc Opus est!_ O what need have we, to be concerned, that the\r\nSins of our _Israel_, may not provoke the God of Heaven to leave his\r\n_Davids_, unto a wrong Step, in a matter of such Consequence, as is now\r\nbefore them! Our Disingenuous, Uncharitable, Unchristian Reproaching of\r\nsuch _Faithful Men_, after all, _The Prayers and Supplications, with\r\nstrong Crying and Tears_, with which we are daily plying the Throne of\r\nGrace, that they may be kept, from what _They Fear_, is none of the way\r\nfor our preventing of what _We Fear_. Nor all this while, ought our\r\n_Pity_ to forget such _Accused_ ones, as call for indeed our most\r\nCompassionate _Pity_, till there be fuller Evidences that they are less\r\nworthy of it. If _Satan_ have any where maliciously brought upon the\r\n_Stage_, those that have hitherto had a just and good stock of\r\nReputation, for their just and good Living, among us; If the _Evil One_\r\nhave obtained a permission to _Appear_, in the Figure of such as we have\r\ncause to think, have hitherto _Abstained_, even from the _Appearance of\r\nEvil_: It is in Truth, such an Invasion upon _Mankind_, as may well\r\nRaise an Horror in us all: But, O what Compassions are due to such as\r\nmay come under such Misrepresentations, of the _Great Accuser_! Who of\r\nus can say, what may be shewn in the _Glasses_ of the Great _Lying\r\nSpirit_? Altho' the _Usual Providence_ of God [we praise Him!] keeps us\r\nfrom such a Mishap; yet where have we an _Absolute Promise_, that we\r\nshall every one always be kept from it? As long as _Charity_ is bound to\r\nThink _no Evil_, it will not Hurt us that are _Private Persons_, to\r\nforbear the _Judgment_ which belongs not unto us. Let it rather be our\r\nWish, May the Lord help them to Learn the _Lessons_, for which they are\r\nnow put unto so hard a School.\r\n\r\n_VI._ With a _Great Zeal_, we should lay hold on the _Covenant_ of God,\r\nthat we may secure _Us_ and _Ours_, from the _Great Wrath_, with which\r\nthe Devil Rages. Let us come into the _Covenant of Grace_, and then we\r\nshall not be hook'd into a _Covenant with the Devil_, nor be altogether\r\nunfurnished with Armour, against the Wretches that are in that\r\n_Covenant_. The way to come under the Saving Influences of the _New\r\nCovenant_, is, to close with the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the\r\nAll-sufficient _Mediator_ of it: Let us therefore do, _that_, by\r\nResigning up our selves unto the Saving, Teaching, and Ruling Hands of\r\nthis Blessed _Mediator_. Then we shall be, what we read in _Jude 1._\r\n_Preserved in Christ Jesus_: That is, as the _Destroying Angel_, could\r\nnot meddle with such as had been distinguished, by the Blood of the\r\n_Passeover_ on their Houses: Thus the Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ,\r\nSprinkled on our Souls, will _Preserve_ us from the Devil. The _Birds of\r\nprey_ (and indeed the _Devils_ most literally in the shape of great\r\n_Birds_!) are flying about. Would we find a Covert from these\r\n_Vultures_? Let us then Hear our Lord Jesus from Heaven Clocquing unto\r\nus, _O that you would be gathered under my wings!_ Well; When this is\r\ndone, Then let us own the _Covenant_, which we are now come into, by\r\njoining our selves to a Particular _Church_, walking in the Order of the\r\nGospel; at the doing whereof, according to that _Covenant_ of God, We\r\ngive up Our selves unto the Lord, and in Him unto One Another. While\r\nothers have had their Names Entred in the _Devils Book_; let our Names\r\nbe found in the _Church Book_, and let us be _Written among the Living\r\nin Jerusalem_. By no means let, _Church work_ sink and fail in the midst\r\nof us; but let the Tragical Accidents which now happen, exceedingly\r\nQuicken that _work_. So many of the _Rising Generation_, utterly\r\nforgetting the Errand of our Fathers to build Churches in this\r\nWilderness, and so many of our _Cottages_ being allow'd to Live, where\r\nthey do not, and perhaps cannot, wait upon God with the Churches of His\r\nPeople; 'tis as likely as any one thing to procure the swarmings of\r\n_Witch crafts_ among us. But it becomes us, with a like Ardour, to bring\r\nour poor _Children_ with us, as we shall do, when we come our selves,\r\ninto the _Covenant_ of God. It would break an heart of Stone, to have\r\nseen, what I have lately seen; Even poor Children of several Ages, even\r\nfrom seven to twenty, more or less, _Confessing_ their Familiarity with\r\nDevils; but at the same time, in Doleful bitter Lamentations, that made\r\na little Pourtraiture of _Hell_ it self, Expostulating with their\r\nexecrable Parents, for _Devoting_ them to the Devil in their Infancy,\r\nand so _Entailing_ of Devillism upon them! Now, as the Psalmist could\r\nsay, _My Zeal hath consumed me, because my Enemies have forgotten thy\r\nwords:_ Even so, let the Nefarious wickedness of those that have\r\nExplicitly dedicated their Children to the Devil, even with Devilish\r\nSymbols, of such a Dedication, Provoke our _Zeal_ to have our Children,\r\nSincerely, Signally, and openly _Consecrated_ unto God; with an\r\n_Education_ afterwards assuring and confirming that Consecration.\r\n\r\n_VII._ Let our _Prayer_ go up with great Faith, against the Devil, that\r\ncomes down in great Wrath. Such is the Antipathy of the Devil to our\r\n_Prayer_, that he cannot bear to stay long where much of it is: Indeed\r\nit is _Diaboli Flagellum_, as well as, _Miseriae Remedium_; the Devil\r\nwill soon be Scourg'd out of the Lord's Temple, by a _Whip_, made and\r\nused, with the _effectual fervent Prayer of Righteous Men_. When the\r\nDevil by Afflicting of us, drives us to our Prayers, he is _The Fool\r\nmaking a Whip for his own Back_. Our Lord said of the Devil in _Matt.\r\n17.21._ _This Kind goes not out, but by Prayer and Fasting._ But,\r\n_Prayer and Fasting_ will soon make the Devil be gone. Here are _Charms_\r\nindeed! Sacred and Blessed _Charms_, which the Devil cannot stand\r\nbefore. A Promise of God, being well managed in the _Hands_ of them that\r\nare much upon their Knees, will so resist the Devil, that he will _Flee\r\nfrom us_. At every other Weapon the Devils will be too hard for us; the\r\n_Spiritual Wickednesses in High Places_, have manifestly the Upper hand\r\nof us; that _Old Serpent_ will be too old for us, too cunning, too\r\nsubtil; they will soon _out wit_ us, if we think to Encounter them with\r\nany _Wit_ of our own. But when we come to _Prayers_, Incessant and\r\nVehement _Prayers_ before the Lord, there we shall be too hard for them.\r\nWhen well-directed _Prayers_, that great Artillery of Heaven, are\r\nbrought into the Field, _There_ methinks I see, _There are these workers\r\nof Iniquity fallen, all of them!_ And who can tell, how much the most\r\n_Obscure Christian_ among you all, may do towards the Deliverance of our\r\nLand from the Molestations which the Devil is now giving to us. I have\r\nRead, That on a day of Prayer kept by some good People for and with a\r\nPossessed Person, the Devil at last flew out of the Window, and\r\nreferring to a Devout, plain, mean Woman then in the Room, he cry'd out,\r\n_O the Woman behind the Door! 'Tis that Woman that forces me away!_ Thus\r\nthe Devil that now troubles us, may be forced within a while to forsake\r\nus; and it shall be said, _He was driven away by the Prayers of some\r\nObscure and Retired Souls, which the World has taken but little notice\r\nof!_ The Great God is about a _Great Work_ at this day among us: Now,\r\nthere is extream Hazard, lest the Devil by Compulsion must submit to\r\nthat _Great Work_, may also by _Permission_, come to Confound that\r\n_Work_; both in the Detections of some, and in the Confessions of\r\nothers, whose Ungodly deeds may be brought forth, by a _Great Work_ of\r\nGod; there is great Hazard lest the Devil intertwist some of his\r\nDelusions. 'Tis PRAYER, I say, 'tis PRAYER, that must carry us well\r\nthrough the strange things that are now upon us. Only that Prayer must\r\nthen be the Prayer of Faith: O where is our Faith in him, Who _hath\r\nspoiled these Principalities and Powers, on his Cross, Triumphing over\r\nthem_!\r\n\r\n_VIII._ Lastly, Shake off, every Soul, shake off the _hard Yoak_ of the\r\nDevil. Where 'tis said, _The whole World lyes in Wickedness;_ 'tis by\r\nsome of the Ancients rendred, _The whole World lyes in the Devil._ The\r\nDevil is a Prince, yea, the Devil is a God unto all the Unregenerate;\r\nand alas, there is _A whole World of them_. Desolate Sinners, consider\r\nwhat an horrid Lord it is that you are Enslav'd unto; and Oh shake off\r\nyour Slavery to such a Lord. Instead of _him_, now make your Choice of\r\nthe Eternal God in Jesus Christ; Chuse him with a most unalterable\r\nResolution, and unto him say, with _Thomas_, _My Lord, and my God!_ Say\r\nwith the Church, _Lord, other Lords have had the Dominion over us, but\r\nnow thou alone shalt be our Lord for ever._ Then instead of your\r\nPerishing under the wrath of the Devils, God will fetch you to a place\r\namong those that fill up the Room of the Devils, left by their Fall from\r\nthe Ethereal Regions. It was a most awful Speech made by the Devil,\r\nPossessing a young Woman, at a Village in _Germany_, _By the command of\r\nGod, I am come to Torment the Body of this young Woman, tho I cannot\r\nhurt her Soul; and it is that I may warn Men, to take heed of sinning\r\nagainst God._ _Indeed_ (said he) _'tis very sore against my will that I\r\ndo it; but the command of God forces me to declare what I do; however I\r\nknow that at the Last Day, I shall have more Souls than God himself._\r\nSo spoke that horrible Devil! But O that none of our Souls may be found\r\namong the Prizes of the Devil, in the Day of God! O that what the Devil\r\nhas been forced to declare, of his Kingdom among us, may prejudice our\r\nHearts against him for ever!\r\n\r\nMy Text says, _The Devil is come down in great Wrath, for he has but a\r\nshort time._ Yea, but if you do not by a speedy and through Conversion\r\nto God, escape the Wrath of the Devil, you will your selves go down,\r\nwhere the Devil is to be, and you will there be sweltring under the\r\nDevils Wrath, not for a _short Time_, but, _World without end_; not for\r\na _Short Time_, but for _Infinite Millions of Ages_. The smoak of your\r\nTorment under that Wrath, will _Ascend for ever and ever_! Indeed, the\r\nDevil's time for his Wrath upon you in this World, can be but short, but\r\nhis time for you to do his Work, or, which is all one, to delay your\r\nturning to God, that is a _Long Time_. When the Devil was going to be\r\nDispossessed of a Man, he Roar'd out, _Am I to be Tormented before my\r\ntime?_ You will _Torment_ the Devil, if you Rescue your Souls out of his\r\nhands, by true Repentance: If once you begin to look that way, he'll Cry\r\nout, _O this is before my Time, I must have more Time, yet in the\r\nService of such a guilty Soul._ But, I beseech you, let us join thus to\r\ntorment the Devil, in an holy Revenge upon him, for all the Injuries\r\nwhich he has done unto us; let us tell him, _Satan, thy time with me is\r\nbut short, Nay, thy time with me shall be no more; I am unutterably\r\nsorry that it has been so much; Depart from me thou Evil-Doer, that\r\nwould'st have me to be an Evil Doer like thy self; I will now for ever\r\nkeep the Commandments of that God, in whom I Live and Move, and have my\r\nBeing!_ The Devil has plaid a fine Game for himself indeed, if by his\r\ntroubling of our Land, the Souls of many People should come to _think\r\nupon their ways, till even they turn their Feet into the Testimonies of\r\nthe Lord_. Now that the Devil may be thus outshot in his own Bow, is the\r\ndesire of all that love the Salvation of God among us, as well as of\r\nhim, who has thus Addressed you. _Amen._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving thus discoursed on the _Wonders of the Invisible World_, I shall\r\nnow, with God's help, go on to relate some Remarkable and Memorable\r\nInstances of _Wonders_ which that _World_ has given to ourselves. And\r\naltho the chief Entertainment which my Readers do expect, and shall\r\nreceive, will be a true History of what has occurred, respecting the\r\nWITCHCRAFTS wherewith we are at this day Persecuted; yet I shall choose\r\nto usher in the mention of those things, with\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NARRATIVE OF AN APPARITION WHICH\r\n\r\nA GENTLEMAN IN BOSTON, HAD OF HIS BROTHER,\r\n\r\nJUST THEN MURTHERED IN LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on the Second of _May_ in the Year 1687, that a most ingenious,\r\naccomplished and well-disposed Gentleman, Mr. _Joseph Beacon_, by Name,\r\nabout Five a Clock in the Morning, as he lay, whether Sleeping or Waking\r\nhe could not say, (but judged the latter of them) had a View of his\r\nBrother then at _London_, altho he was now himself at Our _Boston_,\r\ndistanced from him a thousand Leagues. This his Brother appear'd unto\r\nhim, in the Morning about Five a Clock at _Boston_, having on him a\r\n_Bengal_ Gown, which he usually wore, with a Napkin tyed about his Head;\r\nhis Countenance was very Pale, Gastly, Deadly, and he had a bloody Wound\r\non one side of his Fore-head. _Brother!_ says the Affrighted _Joseph_.\r\n_Brother!_ Answered the Apparition. Said _Joseph_, _What's the matter\r\nBrother? How came you here!_ The Apparition replied, _Brother, I have\r\nbeen most barbarously and injuriously Butchered, by a Debauched Drunken\r\nFellow, to whom I never did any wrong in my Life._ Whereupon he gave a\r\nparticular Description of the Murderer; adding, _Brother, This Fellow\r\nchanging his Name, is attempting to come over unto +New-England+, in\r\n+Foy+, or +Wild+; I would pray you on the first Arrival of either of\r\nthese, to get an Order from the Governor, to Seize the Person, whom I\r\nhave now described; and then do you Indict him for the Murder of me your\r\nBrother: I'll stand by you and prove the Indictment._ And so he\r\nVanished. Mr. _Beacon_ was extreamly astonished at what he had seen and\r\nhear'd; and the People of the Family not only observed an extraordinary\r\nAlteration upon him, for the Week following, but have also given me\r\nunder their Hands a full Testimony, that he then gave them an Account of\r\nthis Apparition.\r\n\r\nAll this while, Mr. _Beacon_ had no advice of any thing amiss attending\r\nhis Brother then in _England_; but about the latter end of _June_\r\nfollowing, he understood by the common ways of Communication, that the\r\n_April_ before, his Brother going in haste by Night to call a Coach for\r\na Lady, met a Fellow then in Drink, with his _Doxy_ in his Hand: Some\r\nway or other the Fellow thought himself Affronted with the hasty passage\r\nof this _Beacon_, and immediately ran into the Fire-side of a\r\nNeighbouring Tavern, from whence he fetch'd out a Fire-fork, wherewith\r\nhe grievously wounded _Beacon_ in the Skull; even in that very part\r\nwhere the Apparition show'd his Wound. Of this Wound he Languished until\r\nhe Dyed on the Second of _May_, about five of the Clock in the Morning\r\nat _London_. The Murderer it seems was endeavouring to Escape, as the\r\nApparition affirm'd, but the Friends of the Deceased _Beacon_, Seized\r\nhim; and Prosecuting him at Law, he found the help of such Friends as\r\nbrought him off without the loss of his Life; since which, there has no\r\nmore been heard of the Business.\r\n\r\nThis History I received of Mr. _Joseph Beacon_ himself; who a little\r\nbefore his own Pious and hopeful Death, which follow'd not long after,\r\ngave me the Story written and signed with his own Hand, and attested\r\nwith the Circumstances I have already mentioned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut I shall no longer detain my Reader, from his expected Entertainment,\r\nin a brief account of the Tryals which have passed upon some of the\r\nMalefactors lately Executed at _Salem_, for the _Witchcrafts_ whereof\r\nthey stood Convicted. For my own part, I was not present at any of them;\r\nnor ever had I any Personal prejudice at the Persons thus brought upon\r\nthe Stage; much less at the Surviving Relations of those Persons, with\r\nand for whom I would be as hearty a Mourner as any Man living in the\r\nWorld: _The Lord Comfort them!_ But having received a Command so to do,\r\nI can do no other than shortly relate the chief _Matters of Fact_, which\r\noccurr'd in the Tryals of some that were Executed, in an Abridgment\r\nCollected out of the _Court-Papers_, on this occasion put into my hands.\r\nYou are to take the _Truth_, just as it was; and the Truth will hurt no\r\ngood Man. There might have been more of these, if my Book would not\r\nthereby have swollen too big; and if some other worthy hands did not\r\nperhaps intend something further in these _Collections_; for which cause\r\nI have only singled out Four or Five, which may serve to illustrate the\r\nway of Dealing, wherein _Witchcrafts_ use to be concerned; and I report\r\nmatters not as an _Advocate_, but as an _Historian_.\r\n\r\nThey were some of the Gracious Words inserted in the Advice, which many\r\nof the Neighbouring Ministers, did this Summer humbly lay before our\r\nHonorable Judges, _We cannot but with all thankfulness, acknowledge the\r\nsuccess which the Merciful God has given unto the Sedulous and Assiduous\r\nendeavours of Our Honourable Rulers, to detect the abominable\r\nWitchcrafts which have been committed in the Country; Humbly Praying,\r\nthat the discovery of those mysterious and mischievous wickednesses, may\r\nbe Perfected._ If in the midst of the many Dissatisfactions among us,\r\nthe Publication of these Tryals, may promote such a Pious Thankfulness\r\nunto God, for Justice being so far executed among us, I shall Rejoice\r\nthat God is Glorified; and pray, that no wrong steps of ours may ever\r\nsully any of his Glorious Works. But we will begin with,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MODERN INSTANCE OF WITCHES,\r\n\r\nDISCOVERED AND CONDEMNED IN A TRYAL,\r\n\r\nBEFORE THAT CELEBRATED JUDGE,\r\n\r\nSIR MATTHEW HALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may cast some Light upon the Dark things now in _America_, if we just\r\ngive a glance upon the _like things_ lately happening in _Europe_. We\r\nmay see the _Witchcrafts_ here most exactly resemble the _Witchcrafts_\r\nthere; and we may learn what sort of Devils do trouble the World.\r\n\r\nThe Venerable _Baxter_ very truly says, _Judge +Hale+ was a Person, than\r\nwhom, no Man was more Backward to Condemn a Witch, without full\r\nEvidence._\r\n\r\nNow, one of the latest Printed Accounts about a _Tryal of Witches_, is\r\nof what was before him, and it ran on this wise. [Printed in the Year\r\n1682.] And it is here the rather mentioned, because it was a Tryal, much\r\nconsidered by the Judges of _New England_.\r\n\r\n_I._ _Rose Cullender_ and _Amy Duny_, were severally Indicted, for\r\nBewitching _Elizabeth Durent_, _Ann Durent_, _Jane Bocking_, _Susan\r\nChandler_, _William Durent_, _Elizabeth_ and _Deborah Pacy_. And the\r\nEvidence whereon they were Convicted, stood upon divers particular\r\nCircumstances.\r\n\r\n_II._ _Ann Durent_, _Susan Chandler_, and _Elizabeth Pacy_, when they\r\ncame into the Hall, to give Instructions for the drawing the Bills of\r\nIndictments, they fell into strange and violent Fits, so that they were\r\nunable to give in their Depositions, not only then, but also during the\r\nwhole Assizes. _William Durent_ being an Infant, his Mother Swore, That\r\n_Amy Duny_ looking after her Child one Day in her absence, did at her\r\nreturn confess, that she had _given suck to the Child_: (tho' she were\r\nan Old Woman:) Whereat, when _Durent_ expressed her displeasure, _Duny_\r\nwent away with Discontents and Menaces.\r\n\r\nThe Night after, the Child fell into strange and sad Fits, wherein it\r\ncontinued for Divers Weeks. One Doctor _Jacob_ advised her to hang up\r\nthe Childs Blanket, in the Chimney Corner all Day, and at Night, when\r\nshe went to put the Child into it, if she found any Thing in it then to\r\nthrow it without fear into the Fire. Accordingly, at Night, there fell a\r\ngreat Toad out of the Blanket, which ran up and down the Hearth. A Boy\r\ncatch't it, and held it in the Fire with the Tongs: where it made an\r\nhorrible Noise, and Flash'd like to Gun-Powder, with a report like that\r\nof a Pistol: Whereupon the Toad was no more to be seen. The next Day a\r\nKinswoman of _Duny's_, told the Deponent, that her Aunt was all\r\ngrievously scorch'd with the Fire, and the Deponent going to her House,\r\nfound her in such a Condition. _Duny_ told her, she might thank her for\r\nit; but she should live to see some of her Children Dead, and her self\r\nupon Crutches. But after the Burning of the Toad, this Child Recovered.\r\n\r\nThis Deponent further Testifi'd, That Her Daughter _Elizabeth_, being\r\nabout the Age of Ten Years, was taken in like manner, as her first Child\r\nwas, and in her Fits complained much of _Amy Duny_, and said, that she\r\ndid appear to Her, and afflict her in such manner as the former. One\r\nDay she found _Amy Duny_ in her House, and thrusting her out of Doors,\r\n_Duny_ said, _You need not be so Angry, your Child won't live long._ And\r\nwithin three Days the Child Died. The Deponent added, that she was Her\r\nself, not long after taken with such a Lameness, in both her Legs, that\r\nshe was forced to go upon Crutches; and she was now in Court upon them.\r\n[It was Remarkable, that immediately upon the Juries bringing in _Duny_\r\nGuilty, _Durent_ was restored unto the use of her Limbs, and went home\r\nwithout her Crutches.]\r\n\r\n_III._ As for _Elizabeth_ and _Deborah Pacy_, one Aged Eleven Years, the\r\nother Nine; the elder, being in Court, was made utterly senseless,\r\nduring all the time of the Trial: or at least speechless. By the\r\ndirection of the Judg, _Duny_ was privately brought to _Elizabeth Pacy_,\r\nand she touched her Hand: whereupon the Child, without so much as seeing\r\nher, suddenly leap'd up and flew upon the Prisoner; the younger was too\r\nill, to be brought unto the Assizes. But _Samuel Pacy_, their Father,\r\ntestifi'd, that his Daughter _Deborah_ was taken with a sudden Lameness;\r\nand upon the grumbling of _Amy Duny_, for being denied something, where\r\nthis Child was then sitting, the Child was taken with an extream pain in\r\nher stomach, like the pricking of Pins; and shrieking at a dreadful\r\nmanner, like a Whelp, rather than a Rational Creature. The Physicians\r\ncould not conjecture the cause of the Distemper; but _Amy Duny_ being a\r\nWoman of ill Fame, and the Child in Fits crying out of _Amy Duny_, as\r\naffrighting her with the Apparition of her Person, the Deponent\r\nsuspected her, and procured her to be set in the stocks. While she was\r\nthere, she said in the hearing of Two Witnesses, _Mr. +Pacy+ keeps a\r\ngreat stir about his Child, but let him stay till he has done as much by\r\nhis Children, as I have done by mine:_ And being Asked, What she had\r\ndone to her Children, she Answered, _She had been fain to open her\r\nChilds Mouth with a Tap to give it Victuals._ The Deponent added, that\r\nwithin Two Days, the Fits of his Daughters were such, that they could\r\nnot preserve either Life or Breath, without the help of a Tap. And that\r\nthe Children Cry'd out of _Amy Duny_, and of _Rose Cullender_, as\r\nafflicting them with their Apparitions.\r\n\r\n_IV._ The Fits of the Children were various. They would sometimes be\r\nLame on one side; sometimes on t'other. Sometimes very sore; sometimes\r\nrestored unto their Limbs, and then Deaf, or Blind, or Dumb, for a long\r\nwhile together. Upon the Recovery of their Speech, they would Cough\r\nextreamly; and with much Flegm, they would bring up Crooked Pins; and\r\none time, a Two-penny Nail, with a very broad Head. Commonly at the end\r\nof every Fit, they would cast up a Pin. When the Children Read, they\r\ncould not pronounce the Name of, _Lord_, or _Jesus_, or _Christ_, but\r\nwould fall into Fits; and say, Amy Duny _says_, _I must not use that\r\nName._ When they came to the Name of _Satan_, or _Devil_, they would\r\nclap their Fingers on the Book, crying out, _This bites, but it makes me\r\nspeak right well!_ The Children in their Fits would often Cry out,\r\n_There stands_ Amy Duny, or _Rose Cullender_; and they would afterwards\r\nrelate, _That these Witches appearing before them, threatned them, that\r\nif they told what they saw or heard, they would Torment them ten times\r\nmore than ever they did before._\r\n\r\n_V._ _Margaret Arnold_, the Sister of Mr. _Pacy_, Testifi'd unto the\r\nlike Sufferings being upon the Children, at her House, whither her\r\nBrother had Removed them. And that sometimes, the Children (_only_)\r\nwould see things like Mice, run about the House; and one of them\r\nsuddenly snap'd one with the Tongs, and threw it into the Fire, where it\r\nscreeched out like a Rat. At another time, a thing like a Bee, flew at\r\nthe Face of the younger Child; the Child fell into a Fit; and at last\r\nVomited up a _Two-penny Nail_, with a Broad Head; affirming, _That the\r\nBee brought this Nail, and forced it into her Mouth._ The Child would in\r\nlike manner be assaulted with Flies, which brought Crooked Pins, unto\r\nher, and made her first swallow them, and then Vomit them. She one Day\r\ncaught an Invisible _Mouse_, and throwing it into the Fire, it Flash'd\r\nlike to Gun-Powder. None besides the Child saw the _Mouse_, but every\r\none saw the _Flash_. She also declared, out of her Fits, that in them,\r\n_Amy Duny_ much tempted her to destroy her self.\r\n\r\n_VI._ As for _Ann Durent_, her Father Testified, That upon a Discontent\r\nof _Rose Cullender_, his Daughter was taken with much Illness in her\r\nStomach and great and sore Pains, like the Pricking of Pins: and then\r\nSwooning Fits, from which Recovering, she declared, _She had seen the\r\nApparition of +Rose Cullender+, Threatning to Torment her._ She likewise\r\nVomited up diverse Pins. The Maid was Present at Court, but when\r\n_Cullender_ look'd upon her, she fell into such Fits, as made her\r\nutterly unable to declare any thing.\r\n\r\n_Ann Baldwin_ deposed the same.\r\n\r\n_VII._ _Jane Bocking_, was too weak to be at the Assizes. But her Mother\r\nTestifi'd, that her Daughter having formerly been Afflicted with\r\nSwooning Fits, and Recovered of them; was now taken with a great Pain in\r\nher Stomach; and New Swooning Fits. That she took little Food, but every\r\nDay Vomited Crooked Pins. In her first Fits, she would Extend her Arms,\r\nand use Postures, as if she catched at something, and when her Clutched\r\nHands were forced open, they would find several Pins diversely Crooked,\r\nunaccountably lodged there. She would also maintain a Discourse with\r\nsome that were Invisibly present, when casting abroad her Arms, she\r\nwould often say, _I will not have it!_ but at last say, _Then I will\r\nhave it!_ and closing her Hand, which when they presently after opened,\r\na Lath-Nail was found in it. But her great Complaints were of being\r\nVisited by the shapes of _Amy Duny_, and _Rose Cullender_.\r\n\r\n_VIII._ As for _Susan Chandler_, her Mother Testified, That being at the\r\nsearch of _Rose Cullender_, they found on her Belly a thing like a Teat,\r\nof an Inch long; which the _said Rose_ ascribed to a strain. But near\r\nher Privy-parts, they found Three more, that were smaller than the\r\nformer. At the end of the long Teat, there was a little Hole, which\r\nappeared, as if newly Sucked; and upon straining it, a white Milky\r\nmatter issued out. The Deponent further said, That her Daughter being\r\none Day concerned at _Rose Cullenders_ taking her by the Hand, she fell\r\nvery sick, and at Night cry'd out, _That +Rose Cullender+ would come to\r\nBed unto her._ Her Fits grew violent, and in the Intervals of them, she\r\ndeclared, _That she saw +Rose Cullender+ in them, and once having of a\r\ngreat Dog with her._ She also Vomited up Crooked Pins; and when she was\r\nbrought into Court, she fell into her Fits. She Recovered her self in\r\nsome Time, and was asked by the Court, whether she was in a Condition to\r\ntake an Oath, and give Evidence. She said, she could; but having been\r\nSworn, she fell into her Fits again, and, _Burn her! Burn her!_ were all\r\nthe words that she could obtain power to speak. Her Father likewise gave\r\nthe same Testimony with her Mother; as to all but the Search.\r\n\r\n_IX._ Here was the Sum of the Evidence: Which Mr. Serjeant _Keeling_,\r\nthought not sufficient to Convict the Prisoners. For admitting the\r\nChildren were Bewitched, yet, said he, it can never be Apply'd unto the\r\nPrisoners, upon the Imagination only of the Parties Afflicted; inasmuch\r\nas no person whatsoever could then be in Safety.\r\n\r\nDr. _Brown_, a very Learned Person then present, gave his Opinion, that\r\nthese Persons were Bewitched. He added, That in _Denmark_, there had\r\nbeen lately a great Discovery of Witches; who used the very same way of\r\nAfflicting people, by Conveying Pins and Nails into them. His Opinion\r\nwas, that the Devil in Witchcrafts, did Work upon the Bodies of Men and\r\nWomen, upon a _Natural Foundation_; and that he did Extraordinarily\r\nafflict them, with such Distempers as their Bodies were most subject\r\nunto.\r\n\r\n_X._ The Experiment about the _Usefulness_, yea, or _Lawfulness_ whereof\r\nGood Men have sometimes disputed, was divers Times made, That tho' the\r\nAfflicted were utterly deprived of all sense in their Fits, yet upon the\r\n_Touch_ of the Accused, they would so screech out, and fly up, as not\r\nupon any other persons. And yet it was also found that once upon the\r\ntouch of an innocent person, the like effect follow'd, which put the\r\nwhole Court unto a stand: altho' a small Reason was at length attempted\r\nto be given for it.\r\n\r\n_XI._ However, to strengthen the Credit of what had been already\r\nproduced against the Prisoners, One _John Soam_ Testifi'd, That bringing\r\nhome his Hay in Three Carts, one of the Carts wrenched the Window of\r\n_Rose Cullenders_ House, whereupon she flew out, with violent\r\nThreatenings against the Deponent. The other Two Carts, passed by Twice,\r\nLoaded, that Day afterwards; but the Cart which touched _Cullenders_\r\nHouse, was Twice or Thrice that Day overturned. Having again Loaded it,\r\nas they brought it thro' the Gate which Leads out of the Field, the Cart\r\nstuck so fast in the Gates Head, that they could not possibly get it\r\nthro', but were forced to cut down the Post of the Gate, to make the\r\nCart pass thro', altho' they could not perceive that the Cart did of\r\neither side touch the Gate-Post. They afterwards, did with much\r\nDifficulty get it home to the Yard; but could not for their Lives get\r\nthe Cart near the place, where they should unload. They were fain to\r\nunload at a great Distance; and when they were Tired, the Noses of them\r\nthat came to Assist them, would burst forth a Bleeding; so they were\r\nfain to give over till next morning; and then they unloaded without any\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n_XII._ _Robert Sherringham_ also Testifi'd, That the Axle-Tree of his\r\nCart, happening in passing, to break some part of _Rose Cullenders_\r\nHouse, in her Anger at it, she vehemently threatned him, _His Horses\r\nshould suffer for it._ And within a short time, all his Four Horses\r\ndy'd; after which he sustained many other Losses in the sudden Dying of\r\nhis Cattle. He was also taken with a Lameness in his Limbs; and so vexed\r\nwith Lice of an extraordinary Number and Bigness, that no Art could\r\nhinder the Swarming of them, till he burnt up two Suits of Apparel.\r\n\r\n_XIII._ As for _Amy Duny_, 'twas Testifi'd by one _Richard Spencer_ that\r\nhe heard her say, _The Devil would not let her Rest; until she were\r\nRevenged on the Wife of +Cornelius Sandswel+._ And that _Sandswel_\r\ntestifi'd, that her Poultry dy'd suddenly, upon _Amy Dunys_ threatning\r\nof them; and that her Husbands Chimney fell, quickly after _Duny_ had\r\nspoken of such a disaster. And a Firkin of Fish could not be kept from\r\nfalling into the Water, upon suspicious words of _Duny's_.\r\n\r\n_XIV._ The Judg told the Jury, they were to inquire now, first, whether\r\nthese Children were Bewitched; and secondly, Whether the Prisoners at\r\nthe Bar were guilty of it. He made no doubt, there were such Creatures\r\nas Witches; for the Scriptures affirmed it; and the Wisdom of all\r\nNations had provided Laws against such persons. He pray'd the God of\r\nHeaven to direct their Hearts in the weighty thing they had in hand;\r\nfor, _To Condemn the Innocent, and let the Guilty go free, were both an\r\nAbomination to the Lord._\r\n\r\nThe Jury in half an hour brought them in _Guilty_ upon their several\r\nIndictments, which were Nineteen in Number.\r\n\r\nThe next Morning, the Children with their Parents, came to the Lodgings\r\nof the Lord Chief Justice, and were in as good health as ever in their\r\nLives; being Restored within half an Hour after the Witches were\r\nConvicted.\r\n\r\nThe Witches were Executed; and _Confessed_ nothing; which indeed will\r\nnot be wondred by them, who Consider and Entertain the Judgment of a\r\nJudicious Writer, _That the Unpardonable Sin, is most usually Committed\r\nby Professors of the Christian Religion, falling into Witchcraft._\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed unto several of the like Tryals among our selves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nTHE TRYAL OF G. B. AT A COURT OF\r\n\r\nOYER AND TERMINER,\r\n\r\nHELD IN SALEM, 1692.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlad should I have been, if I had never known the Name of this Man; or\r\nnever had this occasion to mention so much as the first Letters of his\r\nName. But the Government requiring some Account of his Trial to be\r\ninserted in this Book, it becomes me with all Obedience to submit unto\r\nthe Order.\r\n\r\nI. This _G. B._ Was Indicted for Witch-craft, and in the prosecution of\r\nthe Charge against him, he was Accused by five or six of the Bewitched,\r\nas the Author of their Miseries; he was Accused by Eight of the\r\nConfessing Witches, as being an head Actor at some of their Hellish\r\nRandezvouzes, and one who had the promise of being a King in Satan's\r\nKingdom, now going to be Erected: He was accused by Nine Persons for\r\nextraordinary Lifting, and such feats of Strength, as could not be done\r\nwithout a Diabolical Assistance. And for other such things he was\r\nAccused, until about thirty Testimonies were brought in against him; nor\r\nwere these judg'd the half of what might have been considered for his\r\nConviction: However they were enough to fix the Character of a Witch\r\nupon him according to the Rules of Reasoning, by the Judicious _Gaule_,\r\nin that Case directed.\r\n\r\nII. The Court being sensible, that the Testimonies of the Parties\r\nBewitched, use to have a Room among the _Suspicions_ or _Presumptions_,\r\nbrought in against one Indicted for Witch-craft; there were now heard\r\nthe Testimonies of several Persons, who were most notoriously Bewitched,\r\nand every day Tortured by Invisible Hands, and these now all charged the\r\nSpectres of _G. B._ to have a share in their Torments. At the Examination\r\nof this _G. B._ the Bewitched People were grievously harrassed with\r\nPreternatural Mischiefs, which could not possibly be Dissembled; and\r\nthey still ascribed it unto the endeavours of _G. B._ to Kill them. And\r\nnow upon the Tryal of one of the Bewitched Persons, testified, that in\r\nher Agonies, a little black Hair'd Man came to her, saying his Name was\r\n_B._ and bidding her set her hand to a Book which he shewed unto her;\r\nand bragging that he was a _Conjurer_, above the ordinary Rank of\r\nWitches; That he often Persecuted her with the offer of that Book,\r\nsaying, _She should be well, and need fear nobody, if she would but Sign\r\nit;_ But he inflicted cruel Pains and Hurts upon her, because of her\r\ndenying so to do. The Testimonies of the other Sufferers concurred with\r\nthese; and it was remarkable, that whereas _Biting_ was one of the ways\r\nwhich the Witches used for the vexing of the Sufferers; when they cry'd\r\nout of _G. B._ Biting them, the print of the Teeth would be seen on the\r\nFlesh of the Complainers, and just such a Set of Teeth as _G. B's_ would\r\nthen appear upon them, which could be distinguished from those of some\r\nother Mens. Others of them testified, That in their Torments, _G. B._\r\ntempted them to go unto a Sacrament, unto which they perceived him with\r\na Sound of Trumpet, Summoning of other Witches, who quickly after the\r\nSound, would come from all Quarters unto the Rendezvouz. One of them\r\nfalling into a kind of Trance, affirmed, that _G. B._ had carried her\r\naway into a very high Mountain, where he shewed her mighty and glorious\r\nKingdoms, and said, _He would give them all to her, if she would write\r\nin his Book;_ but she told him, _They were none of his to give;_ and\r\nrefused the Motions; enduring of much Misery for that refusal.\r\n\r\nIt cost the Court a wonderful deal of Trouble, to hear the Testimonies\r\nof the Sufferers; for when they were going to give in their Depositions,\r\nthey would for a long time be taken with Fits, that made them uncapable\r\nof saying any thing. The Chief Judg asked the Prisoner, who he thought\r\nhindred these Witnesses from giving their _Testimonies_? And he\r\nanswered, _He supposed it was the Devil._ That Honourable Person\r\nreplied, _How comes the Devil then to be so loath to have any Testimony\r\nborn against you?_ Which cast him into very great Confusion.\r\n\r\nIII. It has been a frequent thing for the Bewitched People to be\r\nentertained with Apparitions of _Ghosts_ of Murdered People, at the same\r\ntime that the _Spectres_ of the Witches trouble them. These Ghosts do\r\nalways affright the Beholders more than all the other spectral\r\nRepresentations; and when they exhibit themselves, they cry out, of\r\nbeing Murthered by the Witch-crafts or other Violences of the Persons\r\nwho are then in Spectre present. It is further considered, that once or\r\ntwice, these _Apparitions_ have been seen by others, at the very same\r\ntime they have shewn themselves to the Bewitched; and seldom have there\r\nbeen these _Apparitions_, but when something unusual or suspected, have\r\nattended the Death of the Party thus Appearing. Some that have been\r\naccused by these _Apparitions_ accosting of the Bewitched People, who\r\nhad never heard a word of any such Persons ever being in the World, have\r\nupon a fair Examination, freely and fully confessed the Murthers of\r\nthose very Persons, altho' these also did not know how the Apparitions\r\nhad complained of them. Accordingly several of the Bewitched, had given\r\nin their Testimony, that they had been troubled with the Apparitions of\r\ntwo Women, who said, that they were _G. B's_ two Wives, and that he had\r\nbeen the Death of them; and that the Magistrates must be told of it,\r\nbefore whom if _B._ upon his Tryal denied it, they did not know but that\r\nthey should appear again in Court. Now, _G. B._ had been Infamous for the\r\nBarbarous usage of his two late Wives, all the Country over. Moreover,\r\nit was testified, the Spectre of _G. B._ threatning of the Sufferers,\r\ntold them, he had Killed (besides others) Mrs. _Lawson_ and her Daughter\r\n_Ann_. And it was noted, that these were the Vertuous Wife and Daughter\r\nof one at whom this _G. B._ might have a prejudice for his being\r\nserviceable at _Salem Village_, from whence himself had in ill Terms\r\nremoved some Years before: And that when they dy'd, which was long\r\nsince, there were some odd Circumstances about them, which made some of\r\nthe Attendents there suspect something of Witch-craft, tho none Imagined\r\nfrom what Quarter it should come.\r\n\r\nWell, _G. B._ being now upon his Tryal, one of the Bewitched Persons was\r\ncast into Horror at the Ghost of _B's_ two Deceased Wives then appearing\r\nbefore him, and crying for _Vengeance_ against him. Hereupon several of\r\nthe Bewitched Persons were successively called in, who all not knowing\r\nwhat the former had seen and said, concurred in their Horror of the\r\nApparition, which they affirmed that he had before him. But he, tho much\r\nappalled, utterly deny'd that he discerned any thing of it; nor was it\r\nany part of his _Conviction_.\r\n\r\nIV. Judicious Writers have assigned it a great place in the Conviction\r\nof _Witches_, _when Persons are Impeached by other notorious Witches, to\r\nbe as ill as themselves; especially, if the Persons have been much noted\r\nfor neglecting the Worship of God_. Now, as there might have been\r\nTestimonies enough of _G. B's_ Antipathy to _Prayer_, and the other\r\nOrdinances of God, tho by his Profession, singularly Obliged thereunto;\r\nso, there now came in against the Prisoner, the Testimonies of several\r\nPersons, who confessed their own having been horrible _Witches_, and\r\never since their Confessions, had been themselves terribly Tortured by\r\nthe Devils and other Witches, even like the other Sufferers; and therein\r\nundergone the Pains of many _Deaths_ for their Confessions.\r\n\r\nThese now testified, that _G. B._ had been at Witch-meetings with them;\r\nand that he was the Person who had Seduc'd, and Compell'd them into the\r\nsnares of Witchcraft; That he promised them _Fine Cloaths_, for doing\r\nit; that he brought Poppets to them, and Thorns to stick into those\r\nPoppets, for the Afflicting of other People; and that he exhorted them\r\nwith the rest of the Crew, to Bewitch all _Salem Village_, but besure to\r\ndo it Gradually, if they would prevail in what they did.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Lancashire Witches_ were Condemn'd I don't remember that there\r\nwas any considerable further Evidence, than that of the Bewitched, and\r\nthan that of some that confessed. We see so much already against _G. B._\r\nBut this being indeed not enough, there were other things to render what\r\nhad been already produced _credible_.\r\n\r\nV. A famous Divine recites this among the Convictions of a Witch; _The\r\nTestimony of the party Bewitched, whether Pining or Dying; together with\r\nthe joint Oaths of sufficient Persons that have seen certain Prodigious\r\nPranks or Feats wrought by the Party Accused._ Now, God had been pleased\r\nso to leave this _G. B._ that he had ensnared himself by several\r\nInstances, which he had formerly given of a Preternatural Strength, and\r\nwhich were now produced against him. He was a very Puny Man, yet he had\r\noften done things beyond the strength of a Giant. A Gun of about seven\r\nfoot Barrel, and so heavy that strong Men could not steadily hold it out\r\nwith both hands; there were several Testimonies, given in by Persons of\r\nCredit and Honor, that he made nothing of taking up such a Gun behind\r\nthe Lock, with but one hand, and holding it out like a Pistol, at\r\nArms-end. _G. B._ in his Vindication, was so foolish as to say, That\r\n_an +Indian+ was there, and held it out at the same time:_ Whereas none\r\nof the Spectators ever saw any such _Indian_; but they supposed, the\r\n_Black Man_, (as the Witches call the Devil; and they generally say he\r\nresembles an _Indian_) might give him that Assistance. There was\r\nEvidence likewise brought in, that he made nothing of taking up whole\r\nBarrels fill'd with _Malasses_ or _Cider_, in very disadvantageous\r\nPostures, and Carrying of them through the difficultest Places out of a\r\nCanoo to the Shore.\r\n\r\nYea, there were two Testimonies, that _G. B._ with only putting the Fore\r\nFinger of his Right hand into the Muzzle of an heavy Gun, a\r\nFowling-piece of about six or seven foot Barrel, did lift up the Gun,\r\nand hold it out at Arms-end; a Gun which the Deponents thought strong\r\nMen could not with both hands lift up, and hold out at the But-end, as\r\nis usual. Indeed, one of these Witnesses was over-perswaded by some\r\nPersons, to be out of the way upon _G. B's_ Tryal; but he came\r\nafterwards with Sorrow for his withdraw, and gave in his Testimony: Nor\r\nwere either of these Witnesses made use of as Evidences in the Trial.\r\n\r\nVI. There came in several Testimonies relating to the Domestick Affairs\r\nof _G. B._ which had a very hard Aspect upon him; and not only prov'd him\r\na very ill Man; but also confirmed the belief of the Character, which\r\nhad been already fastned on him.\r\n\r\n'Twas testified, that keeping his two Successive Wives in a strange kind\r\nof Slavery, he would when he came home from abroad, pretend to tell the\r\nTalk which any had with them; That he has brought them to the point of\r\nDeath, by his harsh Dealings with his Wives, and then made the People\r\nabout him, to promise that in case Death should happen, they would say\r\nnothing of it; That he used all means to make his Wives Write, Sign,\r\nSeal, and Swear a Covenant, never to reveal any of his Secrets; That his\r\nWives had privately complained unto the Neighbours about frightful\r\nApparitions of Evil Spirits, with which their House was sometimes\r\ninfested; and that many such things have been whispered among the\r\nNeighbourhood. There were also some other Testimonies relating to the\r\nDeath of People whereby the Consciences of an Impartial Jury were\r\nconvinced that _G. B._ had Bewitched the Persons mentioned in the\r\nComplaints. But I am forced to omit several passages, in this as well as\r\nin all the succeeding Tryals, because the Scribes who took notice of\r\nthem, have not supplyed me.\r\n\r\nVII. One Mr. _Ruck_, Brother-in-Law to this _G. B._ testified, that\r\n_G. B._ and himself, and his Sister, who was _G. B's_ Wife, going out for\r\ntwo or three Miles to gather Straw-berries, _Ruck_ with his Sister, the\r\nWife of _G. B._ Rode home very Softly, with _G. B._ on Foot in their\r\nCompany, _G. B._ stept aside a little into the Bushes; whereupon they\r\nhalted and Halloo'd for him. He not answering, they went away homewards,\r\nwith a quickened pace, without expectation of seeing him in a\r\nconsiderable while; and yet when they were got near home, to their\r\nAstonishment, they found him on foot with them, having a Basket of\r\nStraw-berries. _G. B._ immediately then fell to Chiding his Wife, on the\r\naccount of what she had been speaking to her Brother, of him, on the\r\nRoad: which when they wondred at, he said, _He knew their thoughts._\r\n_Ruck_ being startled at that, made some Reply, intimating, that the\r\nDevil himself did not know so far; but _G. B._ answered, _My God makes\r\nknown your Thoughts unto me._ The Prisoner now at the Bar had nothing to\r\nanswer, unto what was thus witnessed against him, that was worth\r\nconsidering. Only he said, _Ruck, and his Wife left a Man with him, when\r\nthey left him._ Which _Ruck_ now affirm'd to be false; and when the\r\nCourt asked _G. B._ _What the Man's Name was?_ his Countenance was much\r\naltered; nor could he say, who 'twas. But the Court began to think, that\r\nhe then step'd aside, only that by the assistance of the _Black Man_, he\r\nmight put on his _Invisibility_, and in that _Fascinating Mist_,\r\ngratifie his own Jealous Humour, to hear what they said of him. Which\r\ntrick of rendring themselves _Invisible_, our Witches do in their\r\nConfessions pretend, that they sometimes are Masters of; and it is the\r\nmore credible, because there is Demonstration, that they often render\r\nmany other things utterly _Invisible_.\r\n\r\nVIII. _Faltring, faulty, unconstant, and contrary Answers upon judicial\r\nand deliberate Examination_, are counted some unlucky Symptoms of Guilt,\r\nin all Crimes, especially in Witchcrafts. Now there never was a Prisoner\r\nmore eminent for them, than _G. B._ both at his Examination and on his\r\nTrial. His _Tergiversations_, _Contradictions_, and _Falshoods_, were\r\nvery sensible: he had little to say, but that he had heard some things\r\nthat he could not prove, Reflecting upon the Reputation of some of the\r\nWitnesses. Only he gave in a Paper to the Jury; wherein, altho' he had\r\nmany times before, granted, not only that there are _Witches_, but\r\nalso, that the present Sufferings of the Country are the effects of\r\n_horrible Witchcrafts_, yet he now goes to evince it, _That there\r\nneither are, nor ever were Witches, that having made a Compact with the\r\nDevil, can send a Devil to Torment other people at a distance._ This\r\nPaper was Transcribed out of _Ady_; which the Court presently knew, as\r\nsoon as they heard it. But he said, he had taken none of it out of any\r\nBook; for which, his Evasion afterwards, was, That a Gentleman gave him\r\nthe Discourse in a Manuscript, from whence he Transcribed it.\r\n\r\nIX. The Jury brought him in _Guilty_: But when he came to Die, he\r\nutterly deni'd the Fact, whereof he had been thus convicted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nTHE TRYAL OF BRIDGET BISHOP, ALIAS\r\n\r\nOLIVER, AT THE COURT OF OYER AND TERMINER,\r\n\r\nHELD AT SALEM, JUNE 2. 1692.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nShe was Indicted for Bewitching of several Persons in the Neighbourhood,\r\nthe Indictment being drawn up, according to the _Form_ in such Cases\r\nusual. And pleading, _Not Guilty_, there were brought in several\r\npersons, who had long undergone many kinds of Miseries, which were\r\npreternaturally inflicted, and generally ascribed unto an _horrible\r\nWitchcraft_. There was little occasion to prove the _Witchcraft_, it\r\nbeing evident and notorious to all beholders. Now to fix the\r\n_Witchcraft_ on the Prisoner at the Bar, the first thing used, was the\r\nTestimony of the _Bewitched_; whereof several testifi'd, That the\r\n_Shape_ of the Prisoner did oftentimes very grievously Pinch them, Choak\r\nthem, Bite them, and Afflict them; urging them to write their Names in a\r\n_Book_, which the said Spectre called, _Ours_. One of them did further\r\ntestifie, that it was the _Shape_ of this Prisoner, with another, which\r\none day took her from her Wheel, and carrying her to the Riverside,\r\nthreatned there to Drown her, if she did not Sign to the _Book_\r\nmentioned: which yet she refused. Others of them did also testifie, that\r\nthe said _Shape_ did in her Threats brag to them that she had been the\r\nDeath of sundry Persons, then by her named; that she had _Ridden_ a Man\r\nthen likewise named. Another testifi'd, the Apparition of _Ghosts_ unto\r\nthe Spectre of _Bishop_, crying out, _You Murdered us!_ About the Truth\r\nwhereof, there was in the Matter of Fact but too much suspicion.\r\n\r\nII. It was testifi'd, That at the Examination of the Prisoner before the\r\nMagistrates, the Bewitched were extreamly tortured. If she did but cast\r\nher Eyes on them, they were presently struck down; and this in such a\r\nmanner as there could be no Collusion in the Business. But upon the\r\nTouch of her Hand upon them, when they lay in their Swoons, they would\r\nimmediately Revive; and not upon the Touch of any ones else. Moreover,\r\nUpon some Special Actions of her Body, as the shaking of her Head, or\r\nthe turning of her Eyes, they presently and painfully fell into the like\r\npostures. And many of the like Accidents now fell out, while she was at\r\nthe Bar. One at the same time testifying, That she said, _She could not\r\nbe troubled to see the afflicted thus tormented._\r\n\r\nIII. There was Testimony likewise brought in, that a Man striking once\r\nat the place, where a bewitched person said, the _Shape_ of this\r\n_Bishop_ stood, the bewitched cried out, _That he had tore her Coat_, in\r\nthe place then particularly specifi'd; and the Woman's Coat was found to\r\nbe Torn in that very place.\r\n\r\nIV. One _Deliverance Hobbs_, who had confessed her being a Witch, was\r\nnow tormented by the Spectres, for her Confession. And she now\r\ntestifi'd, That this _Bishop_ tempted her to Sign the _Book_ again, and\r\nto deny what she had confess'd. She affirm'd, That it was the Shape of\r\nthis Prisoner, which whipped her with Iron Rods, to compel her\r\nthereunto. And she affirmed, that this _Bishop_ was at a General Meeting\r\nof the Witches, in a Field at _Salem_-Village, and there partook of a\r\nDiabolical Sacrament in Bread and Wine then administred.\r\n\r\nV. To render it further unquestionable, that the Prisoner at the Bar,\r\nwas the Person truly charged in THIS _Witchcraft_, there were produced\r\nmany Evidences of OTHER _Witchcrafts_, by her perpetrated. For Instance,\r\n_John Cook_ testifi'd, That about five or six Years ago, one Morning,\r\nabout Sun-Rise, he was in his Chamber assaulted by the _Shape_ of this\r\nPrisoner: which look'd on him, grinn'd at him, and very much hurt him\r\nwith a Blow on the side of the Head: and that on the same day, about\r\nNoon, the same _Shape_ walked in the Room where he was, and an Apple\r\nstrangely flew out of his Hand, into the Lap of his Mother, six or eight\r\nFoot from him.\r\n\r\nVI. _Samuel Gray_ testifi'd, That about fourteen Years ago, he wak'd on\r\na Night, and saw the Room where he lay full of Light; and that he then\r\nsaw plainly a Woman between the Cradle, and the Bed-side, which look'd\r\nupon him. He rose, and it vanished; tho' he found the Doors all fast.\r\nLooking out at the Entry-door, he saw the same Woman, in the same Garb\r\nagain; and said, _In God's Name, what do you come for?_ He went to Bed,\r\nand had the same Woman again assaulting him. The Child in the Cradle\r\ngave a great Screech, and the Woman disappeared. It was long before the\r\nChild could be quieted; and tho' it were a very likely thriving Child,\r\nyet from this time it pined away, and, after divers Months, died in a\r\nsad Condition. He knew not _Bishop_, nor her Name; but when he saw her\r\nafter this, he knew by her Countenance, and Apparel, and all\r\nCircumstances, that it was the Apparition of this _Bishop_, which had\r\nthus troubled him.\r\n\r\nVII. _John Bly_ and his Wife testifi'd, That he bought a Sow of _Edward\r\nBishop_, the Husband of the Prisoner; and was to pay the Price agreed,\r\nunto another person. This Prisoner being angry that she was thus hindred\r\nfrom fingring the Mony, quarrell'd with _Bly_. Soon after which, the Sow\r\nwas taken with strange Fits; Jumping, Leaping, and Knocking her Head\r\nagainst the Fence; she seem'd Blind and Deaf, and would neither Eat nor\r\nbe Suck'd. Whereupon a Neighbour said, she believed the Creature was\r\n_Over-looked_; and sundry other Circumstances concurred, which made the\r\nDeponents believe that _Bishop_ had bewitched it.\r\n\r\nVIII. _Richard Coman_ testifi'd, That eight Years ago, as he lay awake\r\nin his Bed, with a Light burning in the Room, he was annoy'd with the\r\nApparition of this _Bishop_, and of two more that were strangers to him,\r\nwho came and oppressed him so, that he could neither stir himself, nor\r\nwake any one else, and that he was the Night after, molested again in\r\nthe like manner; the said _Bishop_, taking him by the Throat, and\r\npulling him almost out of the Bed. His Kinsman offered for this cause to\r\nlodge with him; and that Night, as they were awake, discoursing\r\ntogether, this _Coman_ was once more visited by the Guests which had\r\nformerly been so troublesom; his Kinsman being at the same time struck\r\nspeechless, and unable to move Hand or Foot. He had laid his Sword by\r\nhim, which these unhappy Spectres did strive much to wrest from him;\r\nonly he held too fast for them. He then grew able to call the People of\r\nhis House; but altho' they heard him, yet they had not power to speak or\r\nstir; until at last, one of the People crying out, _What's the matter?_\r\nThe Spectres all vanished.\r\n\r\nIX. _Samuel Shattock_ testify'd, That in the Year, 1680, this _Bridget\r\nBishop_, often came to his House upon such frivolous and foolish\r\nErrands, that they suspected she came indeed with a purpose of mischief.\r\nPresently, whereupon, his eldest Child, which was of as promising Health\r\nand Sense, as any Child of its Age, began to droop exceedingly; and the\r\noftner that _Bishop_ came to the House, the worse grew the Child. As the\r\nChild would be standing at the Door, he would be thrown and bruised\r\nagainst the Stones, by an invisible Hand, and in like sort knock his\r\nFace against the sides of the House, and bruise it after a miserable\r\nmanner. Afterwards this _Bishop_ would bring him things to Dye, whereof\r\nhe could not imagin any use; and when she paid him a piece of Mony, the\r\nPurse and Mony were unaccountably conveyed out of a lock'd Box, and\r\nnever seen any more. The Child was immediately, hereupon, taken with\r\nterrible Fits, whereof his Friends thought he would have dyed: Indeed he\r\ndid almost nothing but Cry and Sleep for several Months together; and at\r\nlength his Understanding was utterly taken away. Among other Symptoms of\r\nan Inchantment upon him, one was, That there was a Board in the Garden,\r\nwhereon he would walk; and all the Invitations in the World could never\r\nfetch him off. About 17 or 18 years after, there came a Stranger to\r\n_Shattock's_ House, who seeing the Child, said, _This poor Child is\r\nBewitched; and you have a Neighbour living not far off, who is a Witch._\r\nHe added, _Your Neighbour has had a falling out with your Wife; and she\r\nsaid, in her Heart, your Wife is a proud Woman, and she would bring down\r\nher Pride in this Child._ He then remembred, that _Bishop_ had parted\r\nfrom his Wife in muttering and menacing Terms, a little before the Child\r\nwas taken Ill. The abovesaid Stranger would needs carry the bewitched\r\nBoy with him, to _Bishop's_ House, on pretence of buying a pot of Cyder.\r\nThe Woman entertained him in furious manner; and flew also upon the Boy,\r\nscratching his Face till the Blood came; and saying, _Thou Rogue, what\r\ndost thou bring this Fellow here to plague me?_ Now it seems the Man had\r\nsaid, before he went, That he would fetch Blood of _her_. Ever after the\r\nBoy was follow'd with grievous Fits, which the Doctors themselves\r\ngenerally ascribed unto _Witchcraft_; and wherein he would be thrown\r\nstill into the _Fire_ or the _Water_, if he were not constantly look'd\r\nafter; and it was verily believed that _Bishop_ was the cause of it.\r\n\r\nX. _John Louder_ testify'd, That upon some little Controversy with\r\n_Bishop_ about her Fowls, going well to Bed, he did awake in the Night\r\nby Moonlight, and did see clearly the likeness of this Woman grievously\r\noppressing him; in which miserable condition she held him, unable to\r\nhelp himself, till near Day. He told _Bishop_ of this; but she deny'd\r\nit, and threatned him very much. Quickly after this, being at home on a\r\nLords day, with the doors shut about him, he saw a black Pig approach\r\nhim; at which, he going to kick, it vanished away. Immediately after,\r\nsitting down, he saw a black Thing jump in at the Window, and come and\r\nstand before him. The Body was like that of a Monkey, the Feet like a\r\nCocks, but the Face much like a Mans. He being so extreamly affrighted,\r\nthat he could not speak; this Monster spoke to him, and said, _I am a\r\nMessenger sent unto you, for I understand that you are in some Trouble\r\nof Mind, and if you will be ruled by me, you shall want for nothing in\r\nthis World._ Whereupon he endeavoured to clap his Hands upon it; but he\r\ncould feel no substance; and it jumped out of the Window again; but\r\nimmediately came in by the Porch, tho' the Doors were shut, and said,\r\n_You had better take my Counsel!_ He then struck at it with a Stick, but\r\nstruck only the Ground, and broke the Stick: The Arm with which he\r\nstruck was presently Disenabled, and it vanished away. He presently went\r\nout at the Back-door, and spied this _Bishop_, in her Orchard, going\r\ntoward her House; but he had not power to set one foot forward unto\r\nher. Whereupon, returning into the House, he was immediately accosted by\r\nthe Monster he had seen before; which Goblin was now going to fly at\r\nhim; whereat he cry'd out, _The whole Armour of God be between me and\r\nyou!_ So it sprang back, and flew over the Apple-tree; shaking many\r\nApples off the Tree, in its flying over. At its leap, it flung Dirt with\r\nits Feet against the Stomack of the Man; whereon he was then struck\r\nDumb, and so continued for three Days together. Upon the producing of\r\nthis Testimony, _Bishop_ deny'd that she knew this Deponent: Yet their\r\ntwo Orchards joined; and they had often had their little Quarrels for\r\nsome years together.\r\n\r\nXI. _William Stacy_ testify'd, That receiving Mony of this _Bishop_, for\r\nwork done by him; he was gone but a matter of three Rods from her, and\r\nlooking for his Mony, found it unaccountably gone from him. Some time\r\nafter, _Bishop_ asked him, whether her Father would grind her Grist for\r\nher? He demanded why? She reply'd, _Because Folks count me a Witch._ He\r\nanswered, _No question but he will grind it for you._ Being then gone\r\nabout six Rods from her, with a small Load in his Cart, suddenly the\r\nOff-wheel stump'd, and sunk down into an hole, upon plain Ground; so\r\nthat the Deponent was forced to get help for the recovering of the\r\nWheel: But stepping back to look for the hole, which might give him this\r\nDisaster, there was none at all to be found. Some time after, he was\r\nwaked in the Night; but it seem'd as light as day; and he perfectly saw\r\nthe shape of this _Bishop_ in the Room, troubling of him; but upon her\r\ngoing out, all was dark again. He charg'd _Bishop_ afterwards with it,\r\nand she deny'd it not; but was very angry. Quickly after, this Deponent\r\nhaving been threatned by _Bishop_, as he was in a dark Night going to\r\nthe Barn, he was very suddenly taken or lifted from the Ground, and\r\nthrown against a Stone-wall: After that, he was again hoisted up and\r\nthrown down a Bank, at the end of his House. After this again, passing\r\nby this _Bishop_, his Horse with a small Load, striving to draw, all his\r\nGears flew to pieces, and the Cart fell down; and this Deponent going\r\nthen to lift a Bag of Corn, of about two Bushels, could not budge it\r\nwith all his Might.\r\n\r\nMany other Pranks of this _Bishop's_ this Deponent was ready to testify.\r\nHe also testify'd, That he verily believ'd, the said _Bishop_ was the\r\nInstrument of his Daughter _Priscilla's_ Death; of which suspicion,\r\npregnant Reasons were assigned.\r\n\r\nXII. To crown all, _John Bly_ and _William Bly_ testify'd, That being\r\nemploy'd by _Bridget Bishop_, to help to take down the Cellar-wall of\r\nthe old House wherein she formerly lived, they did in holes of the said\r\nold Wall, find several _Poppets_, made up of Rags and Hogs-bristles,\r\nwith headless Pins in them, the Points being outward; whereof she could\r\ngive no Account unto the Court, that was reasonable or tolerable.\r\n\r\nXIII. One thing that made against the Prisoner was, her being evidently\r\nconvicted of _gross Lying_ in the Court, several times, while she was\r\nmaking her Plea; but besides this, a Jury of Women found a preternatural\r\nTeat upon her Body: But upon a second search, within 3 or 4 hours,\r\nthere was no such thing to be seen. There was also an Account of other\r\nPeople whom this Woman had Afflicted; and there might have been many\r\nmore, if they had been enquired for; but there was no need of them.\r\n\r\nXIV. There was one very strange thing more, with which the Court was\r\nnewly entertained. As this Woman was under a Guard, passing by the great\r\nand spacious Meeting-house of _Salem_, she gave a look towards the\r\nHouse: And immediately a _Daemon_ invisibly entring the Meeting-house,\r\ntore down a part of it; so that tho' there was no Person to be seen\r\nthere, yet the People, at the noise, running in, found a Board, which\r\nwas strongly fastned with several Nails, transported unto another\r\nquarter of the House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nTHE TRYAL OF SUSANNA MARTIN, AT THE\r\n\r\nCOURT OF OYER AND TERMINER, HELD BY ADJOURNMENT\r\n\r\nAT SALEM, JUNE 29. 1692.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n_Susanna Martin_, pleading _Not Guilty_ to the Indictment of\r\n_Witchcraft_, brought in against her, there were produced the Evidences\r\nof many Persons very sensibly and grievously Bewitched; who all\r\ncomplained of the Prisoner at the Bar, as the Person whom they believed\r\nthe cause of their Miseries. And now, as well as in the other Trials,\r\nthere was an extraordinary Endeavour by _Witchcrafts_, with Cruel and\r\nfrequent Fits, to hinder the poor Sufferers from giving in their\r\nComplaints, which the Court was forced with much Patience to obtain, by\r\nmuch waiting and watching for it.\r\n\r\nII. There was now also an account given of what passed at her first\r\nExamination before the Magistrates. The Cast of her _Eye_, then striking\r\nthe afflicted People to the Ground, whether they saw that Cast or no;\r\nthere were these among other Passages between the Magistrates and the\r\nExaminate.\r\n\r\n_Magistrate._ Pray, what ails these People?\r\n\r\n_Martin._ I don't know.\r\n\r\n_Magistrate._ But what do you think ails them?\r\n\r\n_Martin._ I don't desire to spend my Judgment upon it.\r\n\r\n_Magistrate._ Don't you think they are bewitch'd?\r\n\r\n_Martin._ No, I do not think they are.\r\n\r\n_Magistrate._ Tell us your Thoughts about them then.\r\n\r\n_Martin._ No, my thoughts are my own, when they are in, but when they\r\nare out they are anothers. Their Master.----\r\n\r\n_Magistrate._ Their Master? who do you think is their Master?\r\n\r\n_Martin._ If they be dealing in the Black Art, you may know as well as\r\nI.\r\n\r\n_Magistrate._ Well, what have you done towards this?\r\n\r\n_Martin._ Nothing at all.\r\n\r\n_Magistrate._ Why, 'tis you or your Appearance.\r\n\r\n_Martin._ I cannot help it.\r\n\r\n_Magistrate._ Is it not _your_ Master? How comes your Appearance to hurt\r\nthese?\r\n\r\n_Martin._ How do I know? He that appeared in the Shape of _Samuel_, a\r\nglorified Saint, may appear in any ones Shape.\r\n\r\nIt was then also noted in her, as in others like her, that if the\r\nAfflicted went to approach her, they were flung down to the Ground. And,\r\nwhen she was asked the reason of it, she said, _I cannot tell; it may\r\nbe, the Devil bears me more Malice than another._\r\n\r\nIII. The Court accounted themselves, alarum'd by these Things, to\r\nenquire further into the Conversation of the Prisoner; and see what\r\nthere might occur, to render these Accusations further credible.\r\nWhereupon, _John Allen_ of _Salisbury_, testify'd, That he refusing,\r\nbecause of the weakness of his Oxen, to Cart some Staves at the request\r\nof this _Martin_, she was displeased at it; and said, _It had been as\r\ngood that he had; for his Oxen should never do him much more Service._\r\nWhereupon, this Deponent said, _Dost thou threaten me, thou old Witch?\r\nI'l throw thee into the Brook:_ Which to avoid, she flew over the\r\nBridge, and escaped. But, as he was going home, one of his Oxen tired,\r\nso that he was forced to Unyoke him, that he might get him home. He then\r\nput his Oxen, with many more, upon _Salisbury_ Beach, where Cattle did\r\nuse to get _Flesh_. In a few days, all the Oxen upon the Beach were\r\nfound by their Tracks, to have run unto the Mouth of _Merrimack-River_,\r\nand not returned; but the next day they were found come ashore upon\r\n_Plum-Island_. They that sought them, used all imaginable gentleness,\r\nbut they would still run away with a violence, that seemed wholly\r\nDiabolical, till they came near the mouth of _Merrimack-River_; when\r\nthey ran right into the Sea, swimming as far as they could be seen. One\r\nof them then swam back again, with a swiftness, amazing to the\r\nBeholders, who stood ready to receive him, and help up his tired\r\nCarcass: But the Beast ran furiously up into the Island, and from\r\nthence, thorough the Marshes, up into _Newbury_ Town, and so up into the\r\nWoods; and there after a while found near _Amesbury_. So that, of\r\nfourteen good Oxen, there was only this saved: The rest were all cast\r\nup, some in one place, and some in another, Drowned.\r\n\r\nIV. _John Atkinson_ testifi'd, That he exchanged a Cow with a Son of\r\n_Susanna Martin's_, whereat she muttered, and was unwilling he should\r\nhave it. Going to receive this Cow, tho he Hamstring'd her, and Halter'd\r\nher, she, of a Tame Creature, grew so mad, that they could scarce get\r\nher along. She broke all the Ropes that were fastned unto her, and\r\nthough she were ty'd fast unto a Tree, yet she made her escape, and gave\r\nthem such further trouble, as they could ascribe to no cause but\r\nWitchcraft.\r\n\r\nV. _Bernard Peache_ testifi'd, That being in Bed, on the Lord's-day\r\nNight, he heard a scrabbling at the Window, whereat he then saw _Susanna\r\nMartin_ come in, and jump down upon the Floor. She took hold of this\r\nDeponent's Feet, and drawing his Body up into an Heap, she lay upon him\r\nnear Two Hours; in all which time he could neither speak nor stir. At\r\nlength, when he could begin to move, he laid hold on her Hand, and\r\npulling it up to his Mouth, he bit three of her Fingers, as he judged,\r\nunto the Bone. Whereupon she went from the Chamber, down the Stairs, out\r\nat the Door. This Deponent thereupon called unto the People of the\r\nHouse, to advise them of what passed; and he himself did follow her.\r\nThe People saw her not; but there being a Bucket at the Left-hand of the\r\nDoor, there was a drop of Blood found upon it; and several more drops of\r\nBlood upon the Snow newly fallen abroad: There was likewise the print of\r\nher 2 Feet just without the Threshold; but no more sign of any Footing\r\nfurther off.\r\n\r\nAt another time this Deponent was desired by the Prisoner, to come unto\r\nan Husking of Corn, at her House; and she said, _If he did not come, it\r\nwere better that he did!_ He went not; but the Night following, _Susanna\r\nMartin_, as he judged, and another came towards him. One of them said,\r\n_Here he is!_ but he having a Quarter-staff, made a Blow at them. The\r\nRoof of the Barn, broke his Blow; but following them to the Window, he\r\nmade another Blow at them, and struck them down; yet they got up, and\r\ngot out, and he saw no more of them.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, there was a Rumour about the Town, that _Martin_ had a\r\nBroken Head; but the Deponent could say nothing to that.\r\n\r\nThe said _Peache_ also testifi'd the Bewitching the Cattle to Death,\r\nupon Martin's Discontents.\r\n\r\nVI. _Robert Downer_ testified, That this Prisoner being some Years ago\r\nprosecuted at Court for a Witch, he then said unto her, _He believed she\r\nwas a Witch._ Whereat she being dissatisfied, said, _That some She-Devil\r\nwould shortly fetch him away!_ Which words were heard by others, as well\r\nas himself. The Night following, as he lay in his Bed, there came in at\r\nthe Window, the likeness of a _Cat_, which flew upon him, took fast hold\r\nof his Throat, lay on him a considerable while, and almost killed him.\r\nAt length he remembred what _Susanna Martin_ had threatned the Day\r\nbefore; and with much striving he cried out, _Avoid, thou She-Devil! In\r\nthe Name of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Avoid!_\r\nWhereupon it left him, leap'd on the Floor, and flew out at the Window.\r\n\r\nAnd there also came in several Testimonies, that before ever _Downer_\r\nspoke a word of this Accident, _Susanna Martin_ and her Family had\r\nrelated, _How this +Downer+ had been handled_!\r\n\r\nVII. _John Kembal_ testified, that _Susanna Martin_, upon a Causeless\r\nDisgust, had threatned him, about a certain Cow of his, _That she should\r\nnever do him any more Good:_ and it came to pass accordingly. For soon\r\nafter the Cow was found stark dead on the dry Ground, without any\r\nDistemper to be discerned upon her. Upon which he was followed with a\r\nstrange Death upon more of his Cattle, whereof he lost in one Spring to\r\nthe Value of Thirty Pounds. But the said _John Kembal_ had a further\r\nTestimony to give in against the Prisoner which was truly admirable.\r\n\r\nBeing desirous to furnish himself with a Dog, he applied himself to buy\r\none of this _Martin_, who had a Bitch with Whelps in her House. But she\r\nnot letting him have his choice, he said, he would supply himself then\r\nat one _Blezdels_. Having mark'd a Puppy, which he lik'd at _Blezdels_,\r\nhe met _George Martin_, the Husband of the Prisoner, going by, who asked\r\nhim, _Whether he would not have one of his Wife's Puppies?_ and he\r\nanswered, _No._ The same Day, one _Edmond Eliot_, being at _Martin's_\r\nHouse, heard _George Martin_ relate, where this _Kembal_ had been, and\r\nwhat he had said. Whereupon _Susanna Martin_ replied, _If I live,\r\nI'll give him Puppies enough!_ Within a few days after, this _Kembal_,\r\ncoming out of the Woods, there arose a little Black Cloud in the N. W.\r\nand _Kembal_ immediately felt a force upon him, which made him not able\r\nto avoid running upon the stumps of Trees, that were before him, albeit\r\nhe had a broad, plain Cart-way, before him; but tho' he had his Ax also\r\non his Shoulder to endanger him in his Falls, he could not forbear going\r\nout of his way to tumble over them. When he came below the Meeting\r\nHouse, there appeared unto him, a little thing like a _Puppy_, of a\r\nDarkish Colour; and it shot backwards and forwards between his Legs. He\r\nhad the Courage to use all possible Endeavours of Cutting it with his\r\nAx; but he could not Hit it: the Puppy gave a jump from him, and went,\r\nas to him it seem'd into the Ground. Going a little further, there\r\nappeared unto him a Black Puppy, somewhat bigger than the first, but as\r\nBlack as a Cole. Its Motions were quicker than those of his Ax; it flew\r\nat his Belly, and away; then at his Throat; so, over his Shoulder one\r\nway, and then over his Shoulder another way. His Heart now began to fail\r\nhim, and he thought the Dog would have tore his Throat out. But he\r\nrecovered himself, and called upon God in his Distress; and naming the\r\nName of JESUS CHRIST, it vanished away at once. The Deponent spoke not\r\none Word of these Accidents, for fear of affrighting his Wife. But the\r\nnext Morning, _Edmond Eliot_, going into _Martin's_ House, this Woman\r\nasked him where Kembal was? He replied, _At home, a Bed, for ought he\r\nknew._ She returned, _They say, he was frighted last Night._ Eliot\r\nasked, _With what?_ She answered, _With Puppies._ _Eliot_ asked, _Where\r\nshe heard of it, for he had heard nothing of it?_ She rejoined, _About\r\nthe Town._ Altho' _Kembal_ had mentioned the Matter to no Creature\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nVIII. _William Brown_ testifi'd, That Heaven having blessed him with a\r\nmost Pious and Prudent Wife, this Wife of his, one day met with _Susanna\r\nMartin_; but when she approach'd just unto her, _Martin_ vanished out of\r\nsight, and left her extreamly affrighted. After which time, the said\r\n_Martin_ often appear'd unto her, giving her no little trouble; and when\r\nshe did come, she was visited with Birds, that sorely peck'd and prick'd\r\nher; and sometimes, a Bunch, like a Pullet's Egg, would rise in her\r\nThroat, ready to choak her, till she cry'd out, _Witch, you shan't choak\r\nme!_ While this good Woman was in this extremity, the Church appointed a\r\nDay of Prayer, on her behalf; whereupon her Trouble ceas'd; she saw not\r\n_Martin_ as formerly; and the Church, instead of their Fast, gave Thanks\r\nfor her Deliverance. But a considerable while after, she being Summoned\r\nto give in some Evidence at the Court, against this _Martin_, quickly\r\nthereupon, this _Martin_ came behind her, while she was milking her Cow,\r\nand said unto her, _For thy defaming her at Court, I'll make thee the\r\nmiserablest Creature in the World._ Soon after which, she fell into a\r\nstrange kind of distemper, and became horribly frantick, and uncapable\r\nof any reasonable Action; the Physicians declaring, that her Distemper\r\nwas preternatural, and that some Devil had certainly bewitched her; and\r\nin that condition she now remained.\r\n\r\nIX. _Sarah Atkinson_ testify'd, That _Susanna Martin_ came from\r\n_Amesbury_ to their House at _Newbury_, in an extraordinary Season,\r\nwhen it was not fit for any to Travel. She came (as she said, unto\r\n_Atkinson_) all that long way on Foot. She brag'd and shew'd how dry she\r\nwas; nor could it be perceived that so much as the Soles of her Shoes\r\nwere wet. _Atkinson_ was amazed at it; and professed, that she should\r\nher self have been wet up to the knees, if she had then came so far; but\r\n_Martin_ reply'd, _She scorn'd to be Drabbled!_ It was noted, that this\r\nTestimony upon her Trial, cast her in a very singular Confusion.\r\n\r\nX. _John Pressy_ testify'd, That being one Evening very unaccountably\r\nBewildred, near a Field of _Martins_, and several times, as one under an\r\nEnchantment, returning to the place he had left, at length he saw a\r\nmarvellous Light, about the bigness of an Half-bushel, near two Rod, out\r\nof the way. He went, and struck at it with a Stick, and laid it on with\r\nall his might. He gave it near forty blows; and felt it a palpable\r\nsubstance. But going from it, his Heels were struck up, and he was laid\r\nwith his Back on the Ground, sliding, as he thought, into a Pit; from\r\nwhence he recover'd by taking hold on the Bush; altho' afterwards he\r\ncould find no such Pit in the place. Having, after his Recovery, gone\r\nfive or six Rod, he saw _Susanna Martin_ standing on his Left-hand, as\r\nthe Light had done before; but they changed no words with one another.\r\nHe could scarce find his House in his Return; but at length he got home\r\nextreamly affrighted. The next day, it was upon Enquiry understood, that\r\n_Martin_ was in a miserable condition by pains and hurts that were upon\r\nher.\r\n\r\nIt was further testify'd by this Deponent, That after he had given in\r\nsome Evidence against _Susanna Martin_, many years ago, she gave him\r\nfoul words about it; and said, _He should never prosper more;_\r\nparticularly, _That he should never have more than two Cows; that tho'\r\nhe was never so likely to have more, yet he should never have them._ And\r\nthat from that very day to this, namely for twenty years together, he\r\ncould never exceed that number; but some strange thing or other still\r\nprevented his having any more.\r\n\r\nXI. _Jervis Ring_ testify'd, That about seven years ago, he was\r\noftentimes and grievously oppressed in the Night, but saw not who\r\ntroubled him; until at last he Lying perfectly Awake, plainly saw\r\n_Susanna Martin_ approach him. She came to him, and forceably bit him by\r\nthe Finger; so that the Print of the bite is now, so long after, to be\r\nseen upon him.\r\n\r\nXII. But besides all of these Evidences, there was a most wonderful\r\nAccount of one _Joseph Ring_, produced on this occasion.\r\n\r\nThis Man has been strangely carried about by _Daemons_, from one\r\n_Witch-meeting_ to another, for near two years together; and for one\r\nquarter of this time, they have made him, and keep him Dumb, tho' he is\r\nnow again able to speak. There was one _T. H._ who having, as 'tis\r\njudged, a design of engaging this _Joseph Ring_ in a snare of Devillism,\r\ncontrived a while, to bring this _Ring_ two Shillings in Debt unto him.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, this poor Man would be visited with unknown shapes, and this\r\n_T. H._ sometimes among them; which would force him away with them, unto\r\nunknown Places, where he saw Meetings, Feastings, Dancings; and after\r\nhis return, wherein they hurried him along through the Air, he gave\r\nDemonstrations to the Neighbours, that he had indeed been so\r\ntransported. When he was brought unto these hellish Meetings, one of the\r\nfirst Things they still did unto him, was to give him a knock on the\r\nBack, whereupon he was ever as if bound with Chains, uncapable of\r\nstirring out of the place, till they should release him. He related,\r\nthat there often came to him a Man, who presented him a _Book_, whereto\r\nhe would have him set his Hand; promising to him, that he should then\r\nhave even what he would; and presenting him with all the delectable\r\nThings, Persons, and Places, that he could imagin. But he refusing to\r\nsubscribe, the business would end with dreadful Shapes, Noises and\r\nScreeches, which almost scared him out of his Wits. Once with the Book,\r\nthere was a Pen offered him, and an Ink-horn with Liquor in it, that\r\nseemed like Blood: But he never toucht it.\r\n\r\nThis Man did now affirm, That he saw the Prisoner at several of those\r\nhellish Randezvouzes.\r\n\r\nNote, this Woman was one of the most impudent, scurrilous, wicked\r\nCreatures in the World; and she did now throughout her whole Tryal,\r\ndiscover her self to be such an one. Yet when she was asked, what she\r\nhad to say for her self? Her chief Plea was, _That she had lead a most\r\nvirtuous and holy Life._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nTHE TRYAL OF ELIZABETH HOW, AT THE\r\n\r\nCOURT OF OYER AND TERMINER, HELD BY ADJOURNMENT\r\n\r\nAT SALEM, JUNE 30. 1692.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n_Elizabeth How_ pleading _Not Guilty_ to the Indictment of Witchcrafts,\r\nthen charged upon her; the Court, according to the usual Proceedings of\r\nthe Courts in _England_, in such Cases, began with hearing the\r\nDepositions of several afflicted People, who were grievously tortured by\r\nsensible and evident _Witchcrafts_, and all complained of the Prisoner,\r\nas the cause of their Trouble. It was also found that the Sufferers were\r\nnot able to bear her _Look_, as likewise, that in their greatest Swoons,\r\nthey distinguished her _Touch_ from other Peoples, being thereby raised\r\nout of them.\r\n\r\nAnd there was other Testimony of People to whom the shape of this _How_,\r\ngave trouble nine or ten years ago.\r\n\r\nII. It has been a most usual thing for the bewitched Persons, at the\r\nsame time that the _Spectres_, representing the _Witches_, troubled\r\nthem, to be visited with Apparitions of _Ghosts_, pretending to have\r\nbeen Murdered by the _Witches_ then represented. And sometimes the\r\nConfessions of the Witches afterwards acknowledged those very Murders,\r\nwhich these _Apparitions_ charged upon them; altho' they had never heard\r\nwhat Informations had been given by the Sufferers.\r\n\r\nThere were such Apparitions of Ghosts testified by some of the present\r\nSufferers; and the Ghosts affirmed, that this _How_ had Murdered them:\r\nWhich things were _fear'd_ but not _prov'd_.\r\n\r\nIII. This _How_ had made some Attempts of joyning to the Church at\r\n_Ipswich_, several years ago; but she was denyed an admission into that\r\nHoly Society, partly through a suspicion of Witchcraft, then urged\r\nagainst her. And there now came in Testimony, of preternatural\r\nMischiefs, presently befalling some that had been Instrumental to debar\r\nher from the Communion whereupon she was intruding.\r\n\r\nIV. There was a particular Deposition of _Joseph Stafford_, That his\r\nWife had conceived an extream Aversion to this _How_, on the Reports of\r\nher Witchcrafts: But _How_ one day, taking her by the Hand, and saying,\r\n_I believe you are not ignorant of the great Scandal that I lye under,\r\nby an evil Report raised upon me._ She immediately, unreasonably and\r\nunperswadeably, even like one Enchanted, began to take this Woman's\r\npart. _How_ being soon after propounded, as desiring an Admission to the\r\nTable of the Lord, some of the pious Brethren were unsatisfy'd about\r\nher. The Elders appointed a Meeting to hear Matters objected against\r\nher; and no Arguments in the World could hinder this Goodwife _Stafford_\r\nfrom going to the Lecture. She did indeed promise, with much ado, that\r\nshe would not go to the Church-meeting, yet she could not refrain going\r\nthither also. _How's_ Affairs there were so canvased, that she came off\r\nrather _Guilty_ than _Cleared_; nevertheless Goodwife _Stafford_ could\r\nnot forbear taking her by the Hand, and saying, _Tho' you are Condemned\r\nbefore Men, you are Justify'd before God._ She was quickly taken in a\r\nvery strange manner, Ranting, Raving, Raging and crying out, _Goody\r\n+How+ must come into the Church; she is a precious Saint; and tho' she\r\nbe condemned before Men, she is Justify'd before God._ So she continued\r\nfor the space of two or three Hours; and then fell into a Trance. But\r\ncoming to her self, she cry'd out, _Ha! I was mistaken;_ and afterwards\r\nagain repeated, _Ha! I was mistaken!_ Being asked by a stander by,\r\n_Wherein?_ she replyed, _I thought Goody +How+ had been a precious Saint\r\nof God, but now I see she is a Witch: She has bewitched me, and my\r\nChild, and we shall never be well, till there be a Testimony for her,\r\nthat she may be taken into the Church._ And _How_ said afterwards, that\r\nshe was very sorry to see _Stafford_ at the Church-meeting mentioned.\r\n_Stafford_, after this, declared herself to be afflicted by the Shape of\r\n_How_; and from that Shape she endured many Miseries.\r\n\r\nV. _John How_, Brother to the Husband of the Prisoner testified, that he\r\nrefusing to accompany the Prisoner unto her Examination, as was by her\r\ndesired, immediately some of his Cattle were Bewitched to Death, leaping\r\nthree or four foot high, turning about, speaking, falling, and dying at\r\nonce; and going to cut off an Ear, for an use, that might as well\r\nperhaps have been omitted, the Hand wherein he held his Knife was taken\r\nvery numb, and so it remained, and full of Pain, for several Days, being\r\nnot well at this very Time. And he suspected the Prisoner for the Author\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nVI. _Nehemiah Abbot_ testify'd, that unusual and mischievous Accidents\r\nwould befal his Cattle, whenever he had any Difference with this\r\nPrisoner. Once, particularly, she wished his Ox choaked; and within a\r\nlittle while that Ox was choaked with a Turnep in his Throat. At another\r\nTime, refusing to lend his Horse, at the Request of her Daughter, the\r\nHorse was in a preternatural manner abused. And several other odd things\r\nof that kind were testified.\r\n\r\nVII. There came in Testimony, that one Good-wife _Sherwin_, upon some\r\nDifference with _How_, was Bewitched; and that she dyed, charging this\r\n_How_ with having an Hand in her Death. And that other People had their\r\nBarrels of Drink unaccountably mischieved, spoil'd and spilt, upon their\r\ndispleasing of her.\r\n\r\nThe things in themselves were trivial, but there being such a Course of\r\nthem, it made them the more considered. Among others, _Martha Wood_,\r\ngave her Testimony, That a little after her Father had been employed in\r\ngathering an account of _How's_ Conversation, they once and again lost\r\ngreat Quantities of Drink out of their Vessels, in such a manner, as\r\nthey could ascribe to nothing but Witchcraft. As also, That _How_ giving\r\nher some Apples, when she had eaten of them, she was taken with a very\r\nstrange kind of Amaze, insomuch that she knew not what she said or did.\r\n\r\nVIII. There was likewise a Cluster of Depositions, That one _Isaac\r\nCummings_ refusing to lend his Mare unto the Husband of this _How_, the\r\nMare was within a Day or two taken in a strange condition: The Beast\r\nseemed much abused, being bruised as if she had been running over the\r\nRocks, and marked where the Bridle went, as if burnt with a red hot\r\nBridle. Moreover, one using a Pipe of Tobacco for the Cure of the\r\nBeast, a blue Flame issued out of her, took hold of her Hair, and not\r\nonly spread and burnt on her, but it also flew upwards towards the Roof\r\nof the Barn, and had like to have set the Barn on Fire: And the Mare\r\ndyed very suddenly.\r\n\r\nIX. _Timothy Pearley_ and his Wife, testifyd, Not only unaccountable\r\nMischiefs befel their Cattle, upon their having of Differences with this\r\nPrisoner: but also that they had a Daughter destroyed by Witchcrafts;\r\nwhich Daughter still charged _How_ as the Cause of her Affliction. And\r\nit was noted, that she would be struck down whenever _How_ were spoken\r\nof. She was often endeavoured to be thrown into the Fire, and into the\r\nWater, in her strange Fits: Tho' her Father had corrected her for\r\ncharging _How_ with bewitching her, yet (as was testified by others\r\nalso) she said, She was sure of it, and must dye standing to it.\r\nAccordingly she charged _How_ to the very Death; and said, _Tho' How\r\ncould afflict and torment her Body, yet she could not hurt her Soul:_\r\nAnd, _That the Truth of this matter would appear, when she should be\r\ndead and gone._\r\n\r\nX. _Francis Lane_ testified, That being hired by the Husband of this\r\n_How_ to get him a parcel of Posts and Rails, this _Lane_ hired _John\r\nPearly_ to assist him. This Prisoner then told _Lane_, That she believed\r\nthe Posts and Rails would not do, because _John Pearly_ helped him; but\r\nthat if he had got them alone, without _John Pearly's_ help, they might\r\nhave done well enough. When _James How_ came to receive his Posts and\r\nRails of _Lane_, _How_ taking them up by the Ends, they, tho' good and\r\nsound, yet unaccountably broke off, so that _Lane_ was forced to get\r\nthirty or forty more. And this Prisoner being informed of it, she said,\r\nShe told him so before, because _Pearly_ helped about them.\r\n\r\nXI. Afterwards there came in the Confessions of several other (penitent)\r\nWitches, which affirmed this _How_ to be one of those, who with them had\r\nbeen baptized by the Devil in the River, at _Newbury_-Falls: before\r\nwhich he made them there kneel down by the Brink of the River and\r\nworshiped him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL OF MARTHA CARRIER, AT THE\r\n\r\nCOURT OF OYER AND TERMINER, HELD BY ADJOURNMENT\r\n\r\nAT SALEM, AUGUST 2. 1692.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n_Martha Carrier_ was Indicted for the bewitching certain Persons,\r\naccording to the Form usual in such Cases, pleading _Not Guilty_, to her\r\nIndictment; there were first brought in a considerable number of the\r\nbewitched Persons; who not only made the Court sensible of an horrid\r\nWitchcraft committed upon them, but also deposed, That it was _Martha\r\nCarrier_, or her Shape, that grievously tormented them, by Biting,\r\nPricking, Pinching and Choaking of them. It was further deposed, That\r\nwhile this _Carrier_ was on her Examination, before the Magistrates, the\r\nPoor People were so tortured that every one expected their Death upon\r\nthe very spot, but that upon the binding of _Carrier_ they were eased.\r\nMoreover the Look of _Carrier_ then laid the Afflicted People for dead;\r\nand her Touch, if her Eye at the same time were off them, raised them\r\nagain: Which Things were also now seen upon her Tryal. And it was\r\ntestified, That upon the mention of some having their Necks twisted\r\nalmost round, by the Shape of this _Carrier_, she replyed, _Its no\r\nmatter though their Necks had been twisted quite off._\r\n\r\nII. Before the Trial of this Prisoner, several of her own Children had\r\nfrankly and fully confessed, not only that they were Witches themselves,\r\nbut that this their Mother had made them so. This Confession they made\r\nwith great Shews of Repentance, and with much Demonstration of Truth.\r\nThey related Place, Time, Occasion; they gave an account of Journeys,\r\nMeetings and Mischiefs by them performed, and were very credible in what\r\nthey said. Nevertheless, this Evidence was not produced against the\r\nPrisoner at the Bar, inasmuch as there was other Evidence enough to\r\nproceed upon.\r\n\r\nIII. _Benjamin Abbot_ gave his Testimony, That last March was a\r\ntwelvemonth, this _Carrier_ was very angry with him, upon laying out\r\nsome Land, near her Husband's: Her Expressions in this Anger, were,\r\n_That she would stick as close to +Abbot+ as the Bark stuck to the Tree;\r\nand that he should repent of it afore seven Years came to an End, so as\r\nDoctor +Prescot+ should never cure him._ These Words were heard by\r\nothers besides _Abbot_ himself; who also heard her say, _She would hold\r\nhis Nose as close to the Grindstone as ever it was held since his Name\r\nwas +Abbot+._ Presently after this, he was taken with a Swelling in his\r\nFoot, and then with a Pain in his Side, and exceedingly tormented. It\r\nbred into a Sore, which was launced by Doctor _Prescot_, and several\r\nGallons of Corruption ran out of it. For six Weeks it continued very\r\nbad, and then another Sore bred in the Groin, which was also lanced by\r\nDoctor _Prescot_. Another Sore then bred in his Groin, which was\r\nlikewise cut, and put him to very great Misery: He was brought unto\r\nDeath's Door, and so remained until _Carrier_ was taken, and carried\r\naway by the Constable, from which very Day he began to mend, and so grew\r\nbetter every Day, and is well ever since.\r\n\r\n_Sarah Abbot_ also, his Wife, testified, That her Husband was not only\r\nall this while Afflicted in his Body, but also that strange\r\nextraordinary and unaccountable Calamities befel his Cattel; their Death\r\nbeing such as they could guess at no Natural Reason for.\r\n\r\nIV. _Allin Toothaker_ testify'd, That _Richard_, the son of _Martha\r\nCarrier_, having some difference with him, pull'd him down by the Hair\r\nof the Head. When he Rose again, he was going to strike at _Richard\r\nCarrier_; but fell down flat on his Back to the ground, and had not\r\npower to stir hand or foot, until he told _Carrier_ he yielded; and then\r\nhe saw the shape of _Martha Carrier_, go off his breast.\r\n\r\nThis _Toothaker_, had Received a wound in the _Wars_; and he now\r\ntestify'd, that _Martha Carrier_ told him, _He should never be Cured._\r\nJust afore the Apprehending of _Carrier_, he could thrust a knitting\r\nNeedle into his wound, four inches deep; but presently after her being\r\nsiezed, he was throughly healed.\r\n\r\nHe further testify'd, that when _Carrier_ and he sometimes were at\r\nvariance, she would clap her hands at him, and say, _He should get\r\nnothing by it;_ whereupon he several times lost his Cattle, by strange\r\nDeaths, whereof no natural causes could be given.\r\n\r\nV. _John Rogger_ also testifyed, That upon the threatning words of this\r\nmalicious _Carrier_, his Cattle would be strangely bewitched; as was\r\nmore particularly then described.\r\n\r\nVI. _Samuel Preston_ testify'd, that about two years ago, having some\r\ndifference with _Martha Carrier_, he lost a _Cow_ in a strange\r\nPreternatural unusual manner; and about a month after this, the said\r\n_Carrier_, having again some difference with him, she told him; _He had\r\nlately lost a Cow, and it should not be long before he lost another;_\r\nwhich accordingly came to pass; for he had a thriving and well-kept\r\n_Cow_, which without any known cause quickly fell down and dy'd.\r\n\r\nVII. _Phebe Chandler_ testify'd, that about a Fortnight before the\r\napprehension of _Martha Carrier_, on a Lords-day, while the Psalm was\r\nsinging in the _Church_, this _Carrier_ then took her by the shoulder\r\nand shaking her, asked her, _where she lived_: she made her no Answer,\r\nalthough as _Carrier_, who lived next door to her Fathers House, could\r\nnot in reason but know who she was. Quickly after this, as she was at\r\nseveral times crossing the Fields, she heard a voice, that she took to\r\nbe _Martha Carriers_, and it seem'd as if it was over her head. The\r\nvoice told her, _she should within two or three days be poisoned._\r\nAccordingly, within such a little time, one half of her right hand,\r\nbecame greatly swollen, and very painful; as also part of her Face;\r\nwhereof she can give no account how it came. It continued very bad for\r\nsome dayes; and several times since, she has had a great pain in her\r\nbreast; and been so siezed on her leggs, that she has hardly been able\r\nto go. She added, that lately, going well to the House of God,\r\n_Richard_, the son of _Martha Carrier_, look'd very earnestly upon her,\r\nand immediately her hand, which had formerly been poisoned, as is\r\nabovesaid, began to pain her greatly, and she had a strange Burning at\r\nher stomach; but was then struck deaf, so that she could not hear any of\r\nthe prayer, or singing, till the two or three last words of the Psalm.\r\n\r\nVIII. One _Foster_, who confessed her own share in the Witchcraft for\r\nwhich the Prisoner stood indicted, affirm'd, that she had seen the\r\nprisoner at some of their _Witch-meetings_, and that it was this\r\n_Carrier_, who perswaded her to be a Witch. She confessed, that the\r\nDevil carry'd them on a pole, to a Witch-meeting; but the pole broke,\r\nand she hanging about _Carriers_ neck, they both fell down, and she then\r\nreceived an hurt by the Fall, whereof she was not at this very time\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nIX. One _Lacy_, who likewise confessed her share in this Witchcraft, now\r\ntestify'd, that she and the prisoner were once Bodily present at a\r\n_Witch-meeting_ in _Salem Village_; and that she knew the prisoner to be\r\na Witch, and to have been at a Diabolical sacrament, and that the\r\nprisoner was the undoing of her, and her Children, by enticing them into\r\nthe snare of the Devil.\r\n\r\nX. Another _Lacy_, who also confessed her share in this Witchcraft, now\r\ntestify'd, that the prisoner was at the _Witch-meeting_, in _Salem\r\nVillage_, where they had Bread and Wine Administred unto them.\r\n\r\nXI. In the time of this prisoners Trial, one _Susanna Sheldon_, in open\r\nCourt had her hands Unaccountably ty'd together with a Wheel-band, so\r\nfast that without cutting, it could not be loosed: It was done by a\r\n_Spectre_; and the Sufferer affirm'd, it was the _Prisoners_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Memorandum._ This Rampant Hag, _Martha Carrier_, was the person, of\r\nwhom the Confessions of the Witches, and of her own Children among the\r\nrest, agreed, That the Devil had promised her, she should be _Queen of\r\nHeb_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus far done the Service imposed upon me; I will further pursue\r\nit, by relating a few of those Matchless CURIOSITIES, with which the\r\n_Witchcraft_ now upon us, has entertained us. And I shall Report nothing\r\nbut with Good Authority, and what I would invite all my Readers to\r\nexamine, while 'tis yet Fresh and New, that if there be found any\r\nmistake, it may be as willingly _Retracted_, as it was unwillingly\r\n_Committed_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST CURIOSITIE.\r\n\r\nI. 'Tis very Remarkable to see what an Impious and Impudent _imitation_\r\nof Divine Things, is Apishly affected by the Devil, in several of those\r\nmatters, whereof the Confessions of our _Witches_, and the Afflictions\r\nof our _Sufferers_ have informed us.\r\n\r\nThat Reverend and Excellent Person, Mr. _John Higginson_, in my\r\nConversation with him, Once invited me to this Reflection; that the\r\nIndians which came from far to settle about _Mexico_, were in their\r\nProgress to that Settlement, under a Conduct of the _Devil_, very\r\nstrangely Emulating what the Blessed God gave to _Israel_ in the\r\nWilderness.\r\n\r\n_Acosta_, is our Author for it, that the Devil in their Idol\r\n_Vitzlipultzli_, governed that mighty Nation. 'He commanded them to\r\nleave their Country, promising to make them _Lords_ over all the\r\nProvinces possessed by _Six_ other Nations of Indians, and give them a\r\nLand abounding with all precious things. They went forth, carrying their\r\nIdol with them, in a Coffer of _Reeds_, supported by Four of their\r\nPrincipal _Priests_; with whom he still _Discoursed_ in secret,\r\nRevealing to them the Successes, and Accidents of their way. He advised\r\nthem, when to _March_, and where to _Stay_, and without his Commandment\r\nthey moved not. The first thing they did, where-ever they came, was to\r\nErect a _Tabernacle_, for their false god; which they set always in the\r\nmidst of their Camp, and they placed the _Ark_ upon an _Alter_. When\r\nthey, Tired with pains, talked of, _proceeding no further_ in their\r\nJourney, than a certain pleasant Stage, whereto they were arrived, this\r\nDevil in one Night, horribly kill'd them that had started this Talk, by\r\npulling out their Hearts. And so they passed on till they came to\r\n_Mexico_.'\r\n\r\nThe Devil which _then_ thus imitated what was in the Church of the _Old\r\nTestament_, now among _Us_ would Imitate the Affairs of the Church in\r\nthe _New_. The _Witches_ do say, that they form themselves much after\r\nthe manner of _Congregational Churches_; and that they have a _Baptism_\r\nand a _Supper_, and _Officers_ among them, abominably Resembling those\r\nof our Lord.\r\n\r\nBut there are many more of these Bloody _Imitations_, if the Confessions\r\nof the _Witches_ are to be Received; which I confess, ought to be but\r\nwith very much Caution.\r\n\r\nWhat is their stricking down with a fierce _Look_? What is their making\r\nof the Afflicted _Rise_, with a touch of their _Hand_? What is their\r\nTransportation thro' the _Air_? What is their Travelling _in Spirit_,\r\nwhile their Body is cast into a Trance? What is their causing of\r\n_Cattle_ to run mad and perish? What is their Entring their Names in a\r\n_Book_? What is their coming together from all parts, at the Sound of a\r\n_Trumpet_? What is their Appearing sometimes Cloathed with _Light_ or\r\n_Fire_ upon them? What is their Covering of themselves and their\r\nInstruments with _Invisibility_? But a Blasphemous Imitation of certain\r\nThings recorded about our Saviour or His Prophets, or the Saints in the\r\nKingdom of God.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SECOND CURIOSITIE.\r\n\r\nII. In all the _Witchcraft_ which now Grievously Vexes us, I know not\r\nwhether anything be more Unaccountable, than the Trick which the Witches\r\nhave to render themselves, and their Tools _Invisible_. _Witchcraft_\r\nseems to be the Skill of Applying the _Plastic Spirit_ of the World,\r\nunto some unlawful purposes, by means of a Confederacy with _Evil\r\nSpirits_. Yet one would wonder how the _Evil Spirits_ themselves can do\r\nsome things; especially at _Invisibilizing_ of the Grossest Bodies. I\r\ncan tell the Name of an Ancient Author, who pretends to show the _way_,\r\nhow a man may come to walk about _Invisible_, and I can tell the Name\r\nof another Ancient Author, who pretends to Explode that way. But I will\r\nnot speak too plainly Lest I should unawares Poison some of my\r\n_Readers_, as the pious _Hemingius_ did one of his _Pupils_, when he\r\nonly by way of Diversion recited a _Spell_, which, they had said, would\r\ncure _Agues_. This much I will say; The notion of procuring\r\n_Invisibility_, by any _Natural Expedient_, yet known, is, I Believe, a\r\nmeer PLINYISM; How far it may be obtained by a _Magical Sacrament_, is\r\nbest known to the Dangerous Knaves that have try'd it. But our _Witches_\r\ndo seem to have got the knack: and this is one of the Things, that make\r\nme think, _Witchcraft_ will not be fully understood, until the day when\r\nthere shall not be one Witch in the World.\r\n\r\nThere are certain people very _Dogmatical_ about these matters; but I'll\r\ngive them only these three Bones to pick.\r\n\r\nFirst, One of our bewitched people, was cruelly assaulted by a\r\n_Spectre_, that, she said, ran at her with a _spindle_: tho' no body\r\nelse in the Room, could see either the _Spectre_ or the _spindle_. At\r\nlast, in her miseries, giving a snatch at the _Spectre_, she pull'd the\r\n_spindle_ away, and it was no sooner got into her hand, but the other\r\npeople then present, beheld, that it was indeed a Real, Proper, Iron\r\n_spindle_, belonging they knew to whom; which when they lock'd up very\r\nsafe, it was nevertheless by _Demons_ unaccountably stole away, to do\r\nfurther mischief.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Another of our bewitched people, was haunted with a most\r\nabusive _Spectre_, which came to her, she said, with a _sheet_ about\r\nher. After she had undergone a deal of Teaze, from the Annoyance of the\r\n_Spectre_, she gave a violent snatch at the sheet, that was upon it;\r\nwherefrom she tore a corner, which in her hand immediately became\r\n_Visible_ to a Roomful of Spectators; a palpable Corner of a Sheet. Her\r\nFather, who was now holding her, catch'd that he might keep what his\r\nDaughter had so strangely siezed, but the unseen _Spectre_ had like to\r\nhave pull'd his hand off, by endeavouring to wrest it from him; however\r\nhe still held it, and I suppose has it, still to show; it being but a\r\nfew hours ago, namely about the beginning of this _October_, that this\r\nAccident happened; in the family of one _Pitman_, at _Manchester_.\r\n\r\nThirdly, A young man, delaying to procure Testimonials for his Parents,\r\nwho being under confinement on suspicion of _Witchcraft_, required him\r\nto do that service for them, was quickly pursued with odd\r\nInconveniences. But once above the Rest, an Officer going to put his\r\n_Brand_ on the Horns of some _Cows_, belonging to these people, which\r\ntho' he had siez'd for some of their debts, yet he was willing to leave\r\nin their possession, for the subsistance of the poor Family; this young\r\nman help'd in holding the Cows to be thus branded. The three first\r\n_Cows_ he held well enough; but when the hot Brand was clap'd upon the\r\nFourth, he _winc'd_ and _shrunk_ at such a Rate, as that he could hold\r\nthe Cow no longer. Being afterwards Examined about it, he confessed,\r\nthat at that very instant when the _Brand_ entered the _Cow's Horn_,\r\nexactly the like burning _Brand_ was clap'd upon his own Thigh; where he\r\nhas exposed the lasting marks of it, unto such as asked to see them.\r\n\r\nUnriddle these Things,--_Et Eris mihi magnus Apollo._\r\n\r\n\r\nA THIRD CURIOSITIE.\r\n\r\nIII. If a Drop of _Innocent Blood_ should be shed, in the Prosecution of\r\nthe _Witchcrafts_ among us, how unhappy are we! For which cause, I\r\ncannot express my self in better terms, than those of a most Worthy\r\nPerson, who lives near the present Center of these things. _The Mind of\r\n+God+ in these matters, is to be carefully lookt into, with due\r\nCircumspection, that Satan deceive us not with his Devices, who\r\ntransforms himself into an Angel of Light, and may pretend justice and\r\nyet intend mischief._ But on the other side, if the storm of Justice do\r\nnow fall only on the Heads of those guilty _Witches_ and _Wretches_\r\nwhich have defiled our Land, _How Happy!_\r\n\r\nThe Execution of some that have lately Dyed, has been immediately\r\nattended, with a strange Deliverance of some, that had lain for many\r\nyears, in a most sad Condition, under, they knew not whose _evil hands_.\r\nAs I am abundantly satisfy'd, That many of the Self-Murders committed\r\nhere, have been the effects of a Cruel and Bloody _Witchcraft_, letting\r\nfly _Demons_ upon the miserable _Seneca's_; thus, it has been admirable\r\nunto me to see, how a Devilish _Witchcraft_, sending Devils upon them,\r\nhas driven many poor people to _Despair_, and persecuted their minds,\r\nwith such Buzzes of _Atheism_ and _Blasphemy_, as has made them even run\r\n_distracted with Terrors_: And some long _Bow'd down_ under such a\r\n_spirit of Infirmity_, have been marvelously Recovered upon the death of\r\nthe Witches.\r\n\r\nOne _Whetford_ particularly ten years ago, challenging of _Bridget\r\nBishop_ (whose Trial you have had) with steeling of a Spoon, _Bishop_\r\nthreatned her very direfully: presently after this, was _Whetford_ in\r\nthe Night, and in her Bed, visited by _Bishop_, with one _Parker_, who\r\nmaking the Room light at their coming in, there discoursed of several\r\nmischiefs they would inflict upon her. At last they pull'd her out, and\r\ncarried her unto the Sea-side, there to _drown_, her; but she calling\r\nupon God, they left her, tho' not without Expressions of their Fury.\r\nFrom that very time, this poor _Whetford_ was utterly spoilt, and grew a\r\nTempted, Froward, Crazed sort of a Woman; a vexation to her self, and\r\nall about her; and many ways unreasonable. In this Distraction she lay,\r\ntill those women were Apprehended, by the Authority; _then_ she began to\r\nmend; and upon their Execution, was presently and perfectly Recovered,\r\nfrom the ten years madness that had been upon her.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FOURTH CURIOSITIE.\r\n\r\nIV. 'Tis a thousand pitties, that we should permit our Eyes, to be so\r\n_Blood-shot_ with passions, as to loose the sight of many wonderful\r\nthings, wherein the Wisdom and Justice of God, would be Glorify'd. Some\r\nof those things, are the frequent \\Apparitions\\ of Ghosts, whereby many\r\nOld \\Murders\\ among us, come to be considered. And, among many instances\r\nof this kind, I will single out one, which concerned a poor man, lately\r\n_Prest_ unto Death, because of his Refusing to _Plead_ for his Life. I\r\nshall make an Extract of a Letter, which was written to my Honourable\r\nFriend, _Samuel Sewal_, Esq.; by Mr. _Putman_, to this purpose;\r\n\r\n'The Last Night my Daughter _Ann_, was grievously Tormented by Witches,\r\nThreatning that she should be _Pressed_ to Death, before _Giles Cory_.\r\nBut thro' the Goodness of a Gracious God, she had at last a little\r\nRespite. Whereupon there appeared unto her (she said) a man in a Winding\r\nSheet, who told her that _Giles Cory_ had Murdered him, by _Pressing_\r\nhim to Death with his Feet; but that the Devil there appeared unto him,\r\nand Covenanted with him, and promised him, _He should not be Hanged._\r\nThe Apparition said, God Hardned his heart; that he should not hearken\r\nto the Advice of the Court, and so Dy an easy Death; because as it said,\r\n_It must be done to him as he has done to me._ The Apparition also said,\r\nThat _Giles Cory_, was carry'd to the Court for this, and that the Jury\r\nhad found the Murder, and that her Father knew the man, and the thing\r\nwas done before she was born. Now Sir, This is not a little strange to\r\nus; that no body should Remember these things, all the while that _Giles\r\nCory_ was in Prison, and so often before the Court. For all people now\r\nRemember very well, (and the Records of the Court also mention it,) That\r\nabout Seventeen Years ago, _Giles Cory_ kept a man in his House, that\r\nwas almost a Natural Fool: which Man Dy'd suddenly. A Jury was\r\nimpannel'd upon him, among whom was Dr. _Zorobbabel Endicot_; who found\r\nthe man bruised to Death, and having clodders of Blood about his Heart.\r\nThe Jury, whereof several are yet alive brought in the man Murdered; but\r\nas if some Enchantment had hindred the Prosecution of the Matter, the\r\nCourt Proceeded not against _Giles Cory_, tho' it cost him a great deal\r\nof Mony to get off.' Thus the Story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Reverend and Worthy Author, having at the Direction of His\r\nEXCELLENCY the Governour, so far Obliged the Publick, as to give some\r\nAccount of the Sufferings brought upon the Countrey by +Witchcraft+; and\r\nof the Tryals which have passed upon several Executed for the Same:_\r\n\r\n_Upon Perusal thereof, We find the Matters of Fact and Evidence, Truly\r\nreported. And a Prospect given, of the +Methods of Conviction+, used in\r\nthe Proceedings of the Court at +Salem+_\r\n\r\n  Boston Octob. 11.                   William Stoughton\r\n        1692.                         Samuel Sewall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut is _New-England_, the only Christian Countrey, that hath undergone\r\nsuch Diabolical Molestations? No, there are other Good people, that have\r\nin this way been harassed; but none in circumstances more like to\r\n_Ours_, than the people of God, in _Sweedland_. The story is a very\r\nFamous one; and it comes to Speak English by the Acute Pen of the\r\nExcellent and Renowned Dr. _Horneck_. I shall only single out a few of\r\nthe more Memorable passages therein Occurring; and where it agrees with\r\nwhat happened among ourselves, my Reader shall understand, by my\r\ninserting a Word of every such thing in \\Black Letter\\.\r\n\r\nI. It was in the Year 1669. and 1670. That at _Mohra_ in _Sweedland_,\r\nthe \\Devils\\ by the help of \\Witches\\, committed a most horrible outrage.\r\nAmong other Instances of Hellish Tyranny there exercised. One was, that\r\nHundreds of their Children, were usually in the Night fetcht from their\r\nLodgings, to a Diabolical Rendezvouz, at a place they called,\r\n_Blockula_, where the Monsters that so Spirited them, \\Tempted\\ them all\r\nmanner of Ways to \\Associate\\ with them. Yea, such was the perillous\r\nGrowth of this _Witchcraft_, that Persons of Quality began to send their\r\nChildren into other Countries to avoid it.\r\n\r\nII. The Inhabitants had earnestly sought God by \\Prayer\\; and \\Yet\\\r\ntheir Affliction \\Continued\\. Whereupon \\Judges\\ had a Special\r\n\\Commission\\ to find and root out the Hellish Crew; and the rather,\r\nbecause another County in the Kingdom, which had been so molested, was\r\ndelivered upon the Execution of the _Witches_.\r\n\r\nIII. The \\Examination\\, was begun with a Day of \\Humiliation\\; appointed\r\nby Authority. Whereupon the Commissioners \\Consulting\\, how they might\r\nresist such a Dangerous Flood, the \\Suffering Children\\, were first\r\nExamined; and tho' they were Questioned \\One\\ by \\One\\ apart, yet their\r\n\\Declarations All Agreed\\. The \\Witches\\ Accus'd in these Declarations,\r\nwere then Examined; and tho' at first they obstinately \\Denied\\, yet at\r\nlength many of them ingeniously \\Confessed\\ the Truth of what the\r\nchildren had said; owning with Tears, that the \\Devil\\, whom they call'd\r\n_Locyta_, had \\Stopt\\ their \\Mouths\\; but he being now \\Gone\\ from them,\r\nthey could \\No Longer Conceal\\ the Business. The things by them\r\n\\Acknowledged\\, most wonderfully \\Agreed\\ with what other Witches, in\r\nother places had confessed.\r\n\r\nIV. They confessed, that they did use to \\Call upon\\ the \\Devil\\, who\r\nthereupon would \\Carry\\ them away, over the Tops of Houses, to a Green\r\nMeadow, where they gave themselves unto him. Only one of them said,\r\nThat sometimes the _Devil_ only took away her \\Strength\\, leaving her\r\n\\Body\\ on the ground; but she went at other times in \\Body\\ too.\r\n\r\nV. Their manner was to come into the \\Chambers\\ of people, and fetch away\r\ntheir children upon Beasts, of the Devils providing: promising \\Fine\r\nCloaths\\ and other Fine Things unto them, to inveagle them. They said,\r\nthey never had power to do thus, till of late; but now the Devil did\r\n\\Plague\\ and \\Beat\\ them, if they did not gratifie him, in this piece of\r\nMischief. They said, they made use of all sorts of \\Instruments\\ in their\r\nJourneys! Of \\Men\\, of \\Beasts\\, of \\Posts\\; the _Men_ they commonly laid\r\nasleep at the place, whereto they rode them; and if the children\r\nmentioned the \\Names\\ of them that stole them away, they were miserably\r\n\\Scurged\\ for it, until some of them were killed. The \\Judges\\ found the\r\nmarks of the Lashes on some of them; but the Witches said, \\They would\r\nQuickly vanish\\. Moreover the Children would be in \\strange Fits\\, after\r\nthey were brought Home from these Transportations.\r\n\r\nVI. The \\First Thing\\, they said, they were to do at _Blockula_, was to\r\ngive themselves unto the Devil, and \\Vow\\ that they would serve him.\r\nHereupon, they \\cut their Fingers\\, and with \\Blood\\ writ their \\Names\\\r\nin his \\Book\\. And he also caused them to be \\Baptised\\ by such\r\n\\Priests\\, as he had, in this Horrid company. In \\some\\ of them, the\r\n\\Mark\\ of the \\cut Finger\\ was to be found; they said, that the Devil\r\ngave \\Meat\\ and \\Drink\\, as to _Them_, so to the Children they brought\r\nwith them: that afterwards their Custom was to _Dance_ before him; and\r\n_swear_ and _curse_ most horribly; they said, that the Devil show'd them\r\na great, Frightful, Cruel _Dragon_, telling them, \\If they confessed any\r\nThing\\, he would let loose that Great Devil upon them; they added, that\r\nthe Devil had a \\Church\\, and that when the \\Judges\\ were coming, he\r\ntold them, \\he would kill them all\\; and that some of them had\r\n\\Attempted to Murder the Judges\\, but \\could not\\.\r\n\r\nVII. Some of the \\Children\\, talked much of a \\White Angel\\, which did\r\nuse to \\Forbid\\ them, what the Devil had bid them to do, and \\Assure\\\r\nthem that these doings would \\Not last long\\; but that what had been\r\ndone was permitted for the wickedness of the People. This \\White Angel\\,\r\nwould sometimes rescue the Children, from \\Going in\\, with the Witches.\r\n\r\nVIII. The Witches confessed many mischiefs done by them, declaring with\r\nwhat kind of \\Enchanted Tools\\, they did their Mischiefs. They sought\r\nespecially to \\kill the Minister\\ of _Elfdale_, but could not. But some of\r\nthem said, that such as they wounded, would \\Be recovered\\, upon or before\r\ntheir Execution.\r\n\r\nIX. The \\Judges\\ would fain have seen them show some of their \\Tricks\\;\r\nbut they Unanimously declared, that, \\Since they had confessed\\, all,\r\nthey found all their \\Witchcraft\\ gone; and the Devil then Appeared very\r\nTerrible unto them, threatning with an \\Iron Fork\\, to thrust them into\r\na Burning Pit, if they persisted in their Confession.\r\n\r\nX. There were discovered no less than _threescore and ten_ Witches in\r\nOne Village, \\three and twenty\\ of which \\freely confessing\\ their Crimes,\r\nwere condemned to dy. The rest, (\\One\\ pretending she was with Child) were\r\nsent to _Fahluna_, where most of them were afterwards executed. Fifteen\r\nChildren, which confessed themselves engaged in this Witchery, dyed as\r\nthe rest. Six and Thirty of them between _nine_ and _sixteen_ years of\r\nAge, who had been less guilty, were forced to run the Gantlet, and be\r\nlashed on their hands once a Week, for a year together; twenty more who\r\nhad less inclination to these Infernal enterprises, were lashed with\r\nRods upon their Hands for three Sundays together, at the Church door;\r\nthe number of the seduced Children, was about three hundred. This\r\ncourse, together with \\Prayers\\, in all the Churches thro' the Kingdom,\r\nissued in the deliverance of the Country.\r\n\r\nXI. The most Accomplished Dr. _Horneck_ inserts a most wise caution, in\r\nhis preface to this Narrative, says he, _there is no Public Calamity,\r\nbut some ill people, will serve themselves of the sad providence, and\r\nmake use of it for their own ends; as +Thieves+ when an house or town is\r\non fire, will steal what they can._ And he mentions a Remarkable Story\r\nof a young Woman, at _Stockholm_, in the year 1676, Who accused her own\r\nMother of being a Witch; and swore positively, that she had carried her\r\naway in the Night; the poor Woman was burnt upon it: professing her\r\ninnocency to the last. But tho' she had been an Ill Woman, yet it\r\nafterwards prov'd that she was not _such_ an one; for her Daughter came\r\nto the Judges, with hideous Lamentations, Confessing, That she had\r\nwronged her Mother, out of a wicked spite against her; whereupon the\r\nJudges gave order for her Execution too.\r\n\r\nBut, so much of these things; And, now, _Lord, make these Labours of thy\r\nServant, Profitable to thy People._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTER OMITTED IN THE TRIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNineteen Witches have been Executed at _New-England_, one of them was a\r\nMinister, and two Ministers more are Accus'd. There is a hundred Witches\r\nmore in Prison, which broke Prison, and about two Hundred more are\r\nAccus'd, some Men of great Estates in _Boston_, have been accus'd for\r\n_Witchcraft_. Those Hundred now in Prison accus'd for Witches, were\r\nCommitted by fifty of themselves being _Witches_, some of _Boston_, but\r\nmost about _Salem_, and the Towns Adjacent. Mr. _Increase Mather_ has\r\nPublished a Book about _Witchcraft_, occasioned by the late Trials of\r\nWitches, which will be speedily printed in _London_ by _John Dunton_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVIL DISCOVERED.\r\n\r\n2 Cor. II. 11. _We are not Ignorant of His DEVICES._\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Blessed Saviour has blessed us, with a counsil, as Wholsome and as\r\nNeedful as any that can be given us, in _Math. 26.41._ _Watch and Pray,\r\nthat yee Enter not into Temptation._ As there is a Tempting _Flesh_, and\r\na Tempting _World_, which would seduce us from Our Obedience to the Laws\r\nof God, so there is a Busy _Devil_, who is by way of Eminency called,\r\n_The Tempter_; because by him, the Temptations of the _Flesh_ and the\r\n_World_ are managed.\r\n\r\nIt is not _One Devil_ alone, that has Cunning or Power enough to apply\r\nthe Multitudes of _Temptations_, whereby Mankind is daily diverted from\r\nthe Service of God; No, the _High Places_ of Our Air, are Swarming full\r\nof those _Wicked Spirits_, whose Temptations trouble us; they are so\r\nmany, that it seems no less than a _Legion_, or more than twelve\r\nthousands may be spared, for the Vexation of one miserable man. But\r\nbecause those Apostate Angels, are all _United_, under one Infernal\r\nMonarch, in the Designs of Mischief, 'tis in the Singular Number, that\r\nthey are spoken of. Now, the _Devil_, whose Malice and Envy, prompts him\r\nto do what he can, that we may be as unhappy as himself, do's ordinarily\r\nuse more _Fraud_, than _Force_, in his assaulting of us; he that\r\nassail'd our First Parents, in a _Serpent_, will still _Act Like a\r\nSerpent_, rather than a _Lion_, in prosecuting of his wicked purposes\r\nupon us, and for us to guard against the _Wiles_ of the _Wicked One_, is\r\none of the greatest cares, with which our God ha's charged us.\r\n\r\nWe are all of us liable to various _Temptations_ every day, whereby if\r\nwe are carried aside from the strait _Paths of Righteousness_, we get\r\nall sorts of wounds unto our selves. Of _Temptations_, I may say, as the\r\nWise Man said, of _Mortality_; _there is no discharge from that war._ The\r\n_Devils_ fell hard upon both _Adams_, nor may any among the Children of\r\nboth, imagine to be excused. The _Son_ of God Himself, had this _Dog_ of\r\nHell, barking at Him; and much more may the Children of _Men_, look to\r\nbe thus Visited; indeed, there is hardly any _Temptation_, but what is,\r\n_Common to Man_. When I was considering, how to spend one Hour in\r\nRaising a most Effectual and Profitable _Breast-work_, against the\r\ninroads of this Enemy, I perceived it would be done, by a short answer\r\nto this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE.\r\n\r\n_What are those Usual +Methods+ of +Temptation+, with which the Powers\r\nof Darkness do assault the Children of Men?_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Corinthians_, having upon the Apostles Direction, Excommunicated\r\none of their Society, who had married his Mother-in-law, & this, as it\r\nis thought, while his own Father was Living too; the Apostle encourages\r\nthem to Re-admit that man, upon his very deep and sharp _Repentance_. He\r\ngives divers Reasons of his propounding this unto them; whereof one is,\r\n_Lest Satan should get advantage of them_; for, had the man miscarried,\r\nunder any Rigour of the Sentence continued upon him, after his\r\n_Repentance_, 'tis well if the Church itself had not quickly fallen to\r\npieces thereupon; besure, the Success of the Gospel had been more than a\r\nlittle Incommoded. The Apostle upon this Occasion, intimates, That\r\n_Satan_ has his _Devices_; by which word are meant, Artifices or\r\nContrivances used for the _Deceiving_ of those that are Treated with\r\nthem well, But what shall _we do_ that we may come to this _Corinthian\r\nAttainment_, _We are not Ignorant of Satan's Devices?_ [_Non cuivis\r\nhomini Contingit!_]\r\n\r\nTruly, the Devil has _Mille Nocendi Artes_; and it will be impossible\r\nfor us, to run over all the _Stratagems_ and _Policies_ of our\r\nAdversary. I shall only attempt a few Observations upon the\r\n_Temptations_ of our Lord Jesus Christ: who was _Tempted in all things\r\nlike unto us, except in our Sins_. When we read the _Temptations_ of\r\nour Lord Jesus Christ, in the Fourth Chapter of _Matthew_ There, Thence,\r\nyou will understand, what was once counted so difficult; Even, _The way\r\nof a Serpent upon the Rock_. There are certain Ancient and Famous\r\n_Methods_ which the Devil in his _Temptations_, does mostly accustome\r\nhimself unto; which is not so much from any Barrenness, or Sluggishness\r\nin the Devil, but because he has had the Encouragement of a, _Probatum\r\nest_, upon those horrid Methods. How did the Devil assault the First\r\n_Adam_? It was with Temptations drawn from _Pleasure_, and _Profit_, and\r\n_Honour_, which, as the Apostle notes, in _1 Joh. 2.16._ are, _All that is\r\nin the World_. With the very same temptations it was, that he fell upon\r\nthe Second _Adam_ too. Now, in those _Temptations_, you will see the\r\nmore _Usual Methods_, whereby the _Devil_ would be Ensnaring of us; and\r\nI beseech you to attend unto the following Admonitions, as those\r\n_Warnings_ of God, which the Lives of your souls depend upon your taking\r\nof.\r\n\r\nThere were especially Three _Remarkable_ Assaults of _Temptations_,\r\nwhich the _Devil_ it seems, visibly made upon our Lord; after he had\r\nbeen more invisibly for Forty dayes together _Tempting_ of that Holy\r\nOne; and we may make a few distinct _Remarks_ upon them all.\r\n\r\n\r\nS. The first of our Lords three Temptations is thus related, in _Mat.\r\n4.3._ _He was an Hungry; and when the Tempter came to him, he said, If\r\nthou be the Son of God, Command that these Stones be made Bread._\r\n\r\nFrom whence, take these _Remarks_.\r\n\r\nI. The Devil will ordinarily make our _Conditions_, to be the\r\nAdvantages of his _Temptations_. When our Lord was _Hungry_, then\r\n_Bread! Bread!_ shall be all the Cry of his Temptation; the Devil puts\r\nhim upon a wrong step, for the getting of _Bread_. There is no\r\nCondition, but what has indeed some _Hunger_ accompanying of it; and the\r\nDevil marks what it is, that we are _Hungry_ for. One mans Condition\r\nmakes him _Hunger_ for Preferments, or Employments, another mans makes\r\nhim _Hunger_ for Cash or Land, or Trade; another mans makes him _Hunger_\r\nfor Merriments, or Diversions: And the Condition of every Afflicted Man,\r\nmakes him _Hunger_ with Impatience for Deliverance. Now the Devil will\r\nbe sure to suit his Perswasions with our _Conditions_. When he has our\r\n_Condition_ to speak with him, & for him, then thinks he, _I am sure\r\nthis man will now hearken to my Proposals!_ Hence, if men are in\r\n_Prosperity_, the Devil will tempt them to Forgetfulness of God; if they\r\nare in _Adversity_, he will tempt them to Murmuring at God; in all the\r\nexpressions of those impieties. Wise _Agur_ was aware of this; in _Prov.\r\n30.9._ says he, if a man be _Full_, he shall be tempted, _to deny God,\r\nand say, who is the Lord?_ if a man be Poor, he shall be tempted, _to\r\nsteal, and take the Name of God in vain._ The Devil will talk suitably;\r\nif you ponder your Conditions, you may expect you shall be tempted\r\nagreeably thereunto.\r\n\r\nII. The Devil does often manage his _temptations_, by urging of our\r\n_Necessities_. Our Lord, was thus by the Devil bawl'd upon; _You want\r\nBread, and you'll starve, if in my way you get it not._ The Devil will\r\nshow some forbidden thing unto us, and plead concerning it, as of\r\n_Bread_ we use to say, _it must be had._ _Necessity_ has a wonderful\r\ncompulsion in it. You may see what _Necessity_ will do, if you read in\r\n_Deut. 28.56._ _the tender and the delicate Woman among you, her eye shall\r\nbe evil towards the Children that she shall bear, for she shall eat them\r\nfor want of all things._ The Devil will perswade us that there is a\r\n_Necessity_ of our doing what he does propound unto us; and then tho'\r\nthe _Laws_ of God about us were so many _Walls_ of Stone, yet we shall\r\nbreak through them all. That little inconvenience, of our coming to beg\r\nour _Bread_, O what a fearful Representation does the Devil make of it!\r\nand when once the Devil scares us to think of a sinful thing, _it must\r\nbe done_, we soon come to think, _it may be done_. When the Devil has\r\nfrighted us into an Apprehension, that it is a _Needful_ thing which we\r\nare prompted unto, he presently Engages all the Faculties of our Souls,\r\nto prove, that it may be a _Lawful_ one; the Devil told _Esau_, _You'll\r\ndye if you don't sell your Birthright;_ the Devil told _Aaron_, _You'll\r\npull all the people about your ears, if you do not countenance their\r\nsuperstitions;_ and then they comply'd immediately. Yea, sometimes if\r\nthe Devil do but Feign a Necessity, he does thereby _Gain_ the Hearts of\r\nMen; he did but feign a Need, when he told _Saul_, _the Cattel must be\r\nspared, and the sacrifice must be precipitated_, & he does but feign a\r\nNeed, when he tells many a man, _if you do no servile work on the\r\n+Sabbath-day+, and if you don't Rob God of his evening, you'll never\r\nsubsist in the world._ All the denials of God, in the world, use to be\r\nfrom this Fallacy impos'd upon us. It never can be necessary for us to\r\nviolate any Negative Commandment in the Law of our God; where God says,\r\n_thou shalt not_, we cannot upon any pretence reply, I _must_. But the\r\nDevil will put a most formidable and astonishing face of necessity upon\r\nmany of those _Abominable things, which are hateful to the soul of God_.\r\nHe'll say nothing to us about, the one thing needful; but the petite and\r\nthe sorry _Need-nots_ of this world, he'll set off with most bloody\r\nColours of _Necessity_. He will not say, _'tis necessary for you to\r\nmaintain the Favour of your God, and secure the +welfare of your Soul+;_\r\nbut he'll say, _'tis necessary for you to keep in with your Neighbours;\r\nand that you and yours may have a good Living among them._\r\n\r\nIII. The Devil does insinuate his most Horrible _Temptations_, with\r\npretence, of much _Friendship_ and _Kindness_ for us. He seemed very\r\nunwilling that our Lord should want any thing that might be comfortable\r\nfor him; but, he was a _Devil_ still! The _Devil_ flatters our Mother\r\n_Eve_, as if he was desirous to make her more Happy than her Maker did;\r\nbut there was the _Devil_ in that flattery. _Sub Amici fallere\r\nNomen_,----to Salute men with profers to do all manner of Service for\r\nthem; and at the same time to Stab them as _Joab_ did _Abner_ of old;\r\nthis is just like the _Devil_, and the _Devil_ truly has many Children\r\nthat Imitate him in it. Some very Affectionate Things were spoken once\r\nunto our Lord; _Lord, be it far from thee, that thou shouldest suffer\r\nany Trouble!_ But our Lords Answer was, in _Mat. 16.23._ _Get thee behind\r\nme Satan._ The Devil will say to a man, _I would have thee to Consult\r\nthy own Interest, and I would have Trouble to be far from thee._ He\r\nspeaks these _Fair Things_, by the Mouths of our professed Friends unto\r\nus, as he did by the Tongue of a Speckled Snake unto our Deluded\r\nParents at the first. But all this while, 'tis a Direction that has been\r\nwisely given us; _When he speaks fair, Believe him not, for there are\r\nseven Abominations in his Heart._\r\n\r\nIV. Things in themselves _Allowable_ and _Convenient_, are oftentimes\r\nturned into sore _Temptations_ by the Devil. He press'd our Lord unto\r\nthe making of _Bread_; Why, that very thing was afterwards done by our\r\nLord, in the Miracles of the _Loaves_; and yet it is now a motion of the\r\n_Devil_, _Pray, make thy self a Little Bread._ The Devil will frequently\r\nput men by, from the doing of a _seasonable Duty_; but how? Truly by\r\nputting us upon another _Duty_, which may be at that juncture a most\r\n_Unseasonable_ Thing. It is said in _Eccl. 8.5._ _A Wise Mans heart\r\ndiscerns both Time and Judgment._ The _Ill-Timing_ of good Things, is\r\nOne of the chief Intregues, which the Devil has to Prosecute. The Devil\r\nhimself, will Egg us on to many a _Duty_; and why so? But because at\r\nthat very Time a more proper and Useful Duty, will have a _Supersedeas_\r\ngiven thereunto. And, thus there are many Things, whereof we can say,\r\nthough no more than this, yet so much as this, _They are Lawful ones_,\r\nby which Lawful Things----_Perimus Omnes._ Where shall we find that the\r\nDevil has laid our most fatal Snares? Truly, our Snares are on the\r\n_Bed_, where it is _Lawful_ for us to Sleep; at the _Board_, where it is\r\n_Lawful_ for us to Sit; in the _Cup_, where 'tis _Lawful_ to Drink; and\r\nin the _Shops_, where we have _Lawful_ Business to do. The _Devil_ will\r\ndecoy us, unto the utmost Edge of the _Liberty_ that is _Lawful_ for us;\r\nand then one Little push, hurries us into a Transgression against the\r\nLord. And the _Devil_ by Inviting us to a _Lawful_ thing, at a wrong\r\ntime for it, Layes us under further Entanglement of Guilt before God.\r\n'Tis _Lawful_ for People to use Recreations; but in the Evening of the\r\nLords Day, or the Morning of any Day, how Ensnaring are they! The\r\n_Devil_ then too commonly bears part in the Sport. If _Promiscuous\r\nDancing_ were Lawful; though almost all the Christian Churches in the\r\nWorld, have made a Scandal of it; yet for Persons to go presently from a\r\n_Sermon_ to a _Dance_, is to do a thing, which Doubtless the _Devil_\r\nmakes good Earnings of.\r\n\r\nV. To _distrust_ Gods Providence and Protection, is one of the worst\r\nthings, into which the Devil by his _Temptations_ would be hurrying of\r\nus. He would fain have driven our Lord unto a Suspicion of Gods care\r\nabout Him, said the Devil, _You may dy for lack of Bread, if you do not\r\nlook better after your self, than God is like to do for you._ It is an\r\nusual thing for Persons to dispair of Gods _Fatherly Care_ Concerning\r\nthem; they torture themselves with distracting and amazing Fears, that\r\nthey shall come to want before they dy; Yea, they even say with _Jonas_,\r\nin _Chap. 2.4._ _I am cast out of the sight of God;_ He wont look after\r\nme! But it is the Devil that is the Author of all such Melancholly\r\nSuggestions in the minds of men. It is a thought that often raises a\r\nFeaver in the Hearts of _Married_ Persons, when Charges grow upon them;\r\n_God will never be able in the way of my Calling, to feed and cloath all\r\nmy Little Folks._ It is a Thought with which _Aged_ persons are often\r\ntormented, _Tho' God has all my dayes hitherto supplied me, yet I shall\r\nbe pinched with Straits before I come to my Journeys end._ 'Tis a\r\nmalicious Devil that raises these _Evil surmisings_ in the hearts of\r\nMen. And sometimes a distemper of Body affords a Lodging for the Devil,\r\nfrom whence he shoots the cruel Bombs of such _Fiery Thoughts_ into the\r\nminds of many other persons. With such thoughts does the Devil choose to\r\npersecute us; because thereby we come to _Forfeit_ what we _Question_.\r\nWe _Question_ the Care of God, and so we _Forfeit_ it, until perhaps the\r\nDevil do utterly _drown us in Perdition_. Our God says, _Trust in the\r\nLord, and do good, and verily thou shall be fed._ But the Devil says,\r\n_don't you trust in God; be afraid that you shall not be fed;_ and thus\r\nhe hinders men from the _doing of Good_.\r\n\r\nVI. There is nothing more Frequent in the _Temptations_ of the Devil,\r\nthen for our _Adoption_ to be doubted, because of our _Affliction_. When\r\nour Lord was in his Penury, then says the Devil, _If thou be the Son of\r\nGod;_ he now makes an _If_, of it; _What? the Son of God, and not be\r\nable to Command a Bit of Bread!_ Thus, when we are in very Afflictive\r\nCircumstances, this will be the Devils Inference, _Thou art not a Child\r\nof God._ The Bible says in _Heb. 12.7._ _If you are Chastened, it is a\r\nshrow'd sign that you can't be Children._ Since he can't Rob us of our\r\n_Grace_, he would Rob us of our _Joy_; and therefore having Accused us\r\nunto God, he then Accuses God unto us. When _Israel_ was weak and faint\r\nin the Wilderness, then did _Amalek_ set upon them; just so does the\r\nDevil set upon the people of God, when their Losses, their Crosses,\r\ntheir Exercises have Enfeebled their Souls within them; and what says\r\nthe Devil? E'en the same that was mutter'd in the Ear of the Afflicted\r\n_Job_, _Is not this the Uprightness of thy Ways? Remember, I pray thee,\r\nwho ever perished, being Innocent? If thou wert a Child of God, He would\r\nnever follow thee, with such Testimonies of his Indignation._ This is\r\nthe _Logic_ of the Devil; and he thus interrupts that patience, and that\r\nChearfulness wherewith we should _suffer the will of God_.\r\n\r\nVII. To dispute the Divine Original and Authority of _Gods Word_, is not\r\nthe least of those _Temptations_ with which the Devil troubles us. God\r\nfrom Heaven, had newly said unto our Lord, _this is my Beloved Son_; but\r\nnow the Devil would have him to make a dispute of it, _If thou be the\r\nson of God._ The Devil durst not be so Impudent, and Brasen fac'd, as to\r\nbid men use _Pharaohs_ Language, _Who is the Lord, that I should obey\r\nhis voice?_ But he will whisper into our Ears, what he did unto our\r\nMother _Eve_ of old, _It is not the Lord that hath spoken what you call\r\nhis Word._ The Devil would have men say unto the _Scripture_, what they\r\nsaid unto the _Prophet_, in _Jer. 43.2._ _Thou speakest falsely; the Lord\r\nour God hath not sent thee to speak what thou sayst unto us;_ & he would\r\nfain have secret & cursed Misgivings in our hearts, _that things are not\r\naltogether so as the Scripture has represented them._ The Devil would\r\nwith all his heart make one huge Bonefire of all the Bibles in the\r\nworld; & he has got Millions of persecutors to _assist him in the\r\nsuppression of that miraculous book_. _It was the +devil+ once in the\r\ntongue of a Papist_, that cry'd out, _A plague on this bible; this 'tis\r\nthat does all our mischief._ But because he can't _Suppress_ this Book,\r\nhe sets himself, to _Disgrace_ it all that he can. Altho' the Scripture\r\ncarries its _own Evidence_ with it, and be all over, so pure, so great,\r\nso true, and so powerful, that it is impossible it should proceed from\r\nany but God alone; yet the Devil would gladly bring some Discredit upon\r\nit, as if it were but some _Humane Contrivance_; Of nothing, is the\r\nDevil more desirous, than this; That we should not count, _Christ_ so\r\nprecious, _Heaven_ so Glorious, _Hell_ so Dreadful, and _Sin_ so odious,\r\nas the Scripture has declared it.\r\n\r\n\r\nS. The Second of our Lords Three Temptations, is related after this\r\nmanner, in _Mat. 4.5, 6._ _Then the Devil taketh him up, into the Holy\r\nCity, and setteth him upon a Pinacle of the Temple; and saith unto him,\r\nif thou be the Son of God, cast thy self down; for it is written, He\r\nshall give his Angels charge concerning thee, and in their Hands, they\r\nshall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy Foot against a\r\nStone._\r\n\r\nFrom whence take these _Remarks_.\r\n\r\nI. The places of the greatest _Holiness_ will not secure us from\r\nAnnoyance by the _Temptations_ of the Devil, to the greatest wickedness.\r\nWhen our Lord was in the Holy City, the Devil fell upon him there.\r\nIndeed, there is now no proper _Holiness_ of _Places_ in our Days; the\r\nSigns and Means of Gods more special Presence are not under the Gospel,\r\nty'd unto any certain _places_: Nevertheless there are _places_, where\r\nwe use to enjoy much of God; and where, altho' God visit not the\r\n_Persons_ for the sake of the _Places_, yet he visits the _Places_ for\r\nthe sake of the _Persons_. But, I am to tell you that the Devil will\r\nvisit those _Places_ and best _Persons_ there. No _Place_, that I know\r\nof, has got such a _Spell_ upon it, as will always keep the Devil out.\r\nThe _Meeting-House_ wherein we Assemble for the Worship of God, is\r\nfill'd with many Holy People, and many Holy Concerns continually; but if\r\nour Eyes were so refined as the Servant of the Prophet had his of old, I\r\nsuppose we should now see a Throng of _Devils_ in this very place. The\r\nApostle has intimated, that Angels come in among us; there are Angels it\r\nseems that hark, how I _Preach_, and how you _Hear_, at this Hour. And\r\nour own sad Experience is enough to intimate, That the _Devils_ are\r\nlikewise Rendevouzing here. It is Reported, in _Job 1.5._ _When the Sons\r\nof God came to present themselves before the Lord, Satan came also among\r\nthem._ When we are in our Church-Assemblies, O how many _Devils_, do you\r\nimagine, croud in among us! There is a _Devil_ that rocks one to Sleep,\r\nthere is a _Devil_ that makes another to be thinking of, he scarce knows\r\nwhat himself; and there is a _Devil_, that makes another, to be pleasing\r\nhimself with wanton and wicked Speculations. It is also possible, that\r\nwe have our _Closets_, or our _Studies_, gloriously perfumed with\r\nDevotions every day; but alas, can we shut the Devil out of them? No,\r\nLet us go where we will, we shall still find a Devil nigh unto us. Only,\r\nwhen we come to Heaven, we shall be out of his reach for ever; _O thou\r\nfoul Devil; we are going where thou canst not come!_ He was hissed out\r\nof _Paradise_, and shall never enter it any more. Yea, more than so,\r\nwhen the _New Jerusalem_ comes down into the _High Places_ of our Air,\r\nfrom whence the Devil shall then be banished, there shall be no Devil\r\nwithin the Walls of that Holy City. _Amen, Even so Lord Jesus, Come\r\nquickly._\r\n\r\nII. Any other acknowledgments of the Lord Jesus Christ, will be\r\npermitted by the Temptations of the Devil, provided those\r\nAcknowledgments of him, which are _True_ and _Full_, may be thereby\r\nprevented. What was it, that the Devil hurried our Lord Jesus Christ\r\nunto the Top of the _Temple_ for? Surely it could not meerly be to find\r\n_Precipices_; any part of the Wilderness would have afforded _Them_. No,\r\nit was rather to have _Spectators_. And why so, Why, the carnal Jews had\r\nan Expectation among them; that _Elias_ was to fly from Heaven to the\r\nTemple; and the Devil seems willing, that our Lord should be cry'd up\r\nfor _Elias_, among the giddy multitude; or any thing in the World, tho\r\nnever so considerable otherwise, rather than to be received as the\r\nChrist of God. The Devil will allow his Followers to think very highly\r\nof the Lord Jesus Christ; O but he is very lothe to have them think,\r\n_All_. We read in _Col. 1.19._ _It has pleased the Father, that in Him\r\nthere should all Fullness dwell._ But it is pleasing to the Devil that\r\nwe deny something of the Immense _Fullness_, which is in our Lord. The\r\nDevil would confess to our Lord, _Thou art the Holy One of God!_ but\r\nthen he claps in, _Thou art Jesus of Nazareth;_ which was to conceal our\r\nLords being _Jesus of Bethlehem_, and so his being, _The True Messiah_.\r\nAll the _Heresies_, and all the Persecutions, that ever plagued the\r\nChurch of God, have still been, to strike at some _Glory_ of our Lord\r\nJesus Christ. A CHRIST Entirely Acknowledged, will save the Souls of\r\nthem that so Acknowledge Him; but, says the Devil, _Whatever tides I\r\nmust not give way to that._ As they say, the Devil makes Witches unable\r\nto utter all the _Lords Prayer_, or some such System of Religion,\r\nwithout some Deprevations of it; thus the Devil will consent that we may\r\nmake a very large Confession of the Lord Jesus Christ; only he will have\r\nus to deprave it, at least in some one Important Article. Some one\r\nHonour, some one Office, and some one _Ordinance_ of the Lord Jesus\r\nChrist, must be always left unacknowledged, by those that will do as the\r\nDevil would have them.\r\n\r\nIII. _High Stations_ in the Church of God, lay men open to violent and\r\npeculiar _Temptations_ of the Devil. When our Lord was upon the\r\n_Pinacle_, that is not the _Fane_, or _Spire_, but the _Battlements_ of\r\nthe _Temple_, there did the Devil pester him, with singular\r\nMolestations, and he therein seems to intend an Entanglement for the\r\nJews, as well as for our Lord. Believe me they that stand High, cannot\r\nstand safe. The Devil is a _Nimrod_, a mighty Hunter; and common or\r\nlittle Game, will not serve his Turn: he is a _Leviathan_, of whom we\r\nmay say, as in _Job. 41.34._ _He beholds all high things._ Men of high\r\nAttainments, and Men of high Employments, in the Church of God, must\r\nlook, like _Peter_ to be more _Sifted_, and like _Paul_, to be more\r\n_Buffeted_ than other Men. _Ferunt Summos Fulmina Montes._----The Devil\r\ncan raise a Storm, when God permitteth it, but as for those Men that\r\nstand near Heaven, the Devil will attack them with his most cruel storms\r\nof Thunder and Lightening. It was said, _let him that standeth take\r\nheed;_ but we may say, _They that stand most high, have cause to take\r\nmost heed._ The Devil is a _Goliah_; and when he finds a _Champion_,\r\nhe'l be sure most fiercely to Combate such a Man. He is for, _Killing\r\nmany Birds with one stone_; and he knows that he shall hinder a world\r\nof _Good_, and produce a world of _Ill_, if once he can bring a Man\r\nEminently Stationed into his Toyls. Hence 'tis that the _Ministers_ of\r\nGod, are more dogg'd by the Devil, than other persons are. Especially\r\nsuch _Ministers_, as more in the highest Orb of Serviceableness; and\r\nmost of all such _Ministers_ as have spent many years in Laudable\r\nEndeavours to be serviceable; Those Ministers are the _Stars_ of Heaven,\r\nat which the _Tayl_ of the _Dragon_, will give the most sweeping and\r\nmost stinging strokes; the Devil will find that for them, that shall\r\nmake them _Walk softly_ all their Days. These are the Men, that have\r\ncreepled, and vexed the Devil more than other Men; for which the Devil\r\nhas an old Quarrel with them. O Neighbours, little do you think, what\r\nblack Days of Mourning, and Fasting, and Praying before the Lord, a\r\nRaging Devil does fill the lives of such _Men of God_ withall.\r\n\r\nIV. The Devil will make a deceitful and unfaithful use of the\r\n_Scriptures_ to make his _Temptations_ forceable. When the Devil\r\nSolicited our Lord, unto an evil thing, he quoted the _Ninty First_\r\nPsalm unto him, tho' indeed he fallaciously clip'd it, and maim'd it, of\r\none clause very material in it. O never does the Devil make such\r\ndangerous Passes at us, as when he does wrest our _own Sword_ out of our\r\nHands, and push _That_ upon us. We have to defend us, that Weapon in\r\n_Eph. 6.16._ _The Sword of the Spirit, which, is the word of God_; but\r\nwhen the Devil has that very Weapon to fight us with, he makes terrible\r\nwork of it. When the Devil would poyson men with false _Doctrines_, he'l\r\nquote Scriptures for them; a _Quaker_ himself, will have the First\r\nChapter of _John_ always in his mouth. When the Devil would perswade men\r\nto vile _Actions_, he'l quote Scriptures for them; he'l encourage men to\r\ngo on in Sin, by showing them, where 'tis said, _The Lord is ready to\r\nPardon._ I say this, The one story of _Davids_ Fall, in the Scripture,\r\nhas been made by the Devil an Engine for the Damnation of many Millions.\r\nThe Devil will fright men from doing those things, that are, _the Things\r\nof their Peace_; but How? He'l turn a _Scripture_ into a _Scare-crow_\r\nfor them. The Devil will fright them from all constant Prayer to God, by\r\nquoting that Scripture, _The Sacrifice of the Wicked, is an Abomination\r\nto the Lord;_ the Devil will fright them from the Holy Supper of God, by\r\nquoting that Scripture, _He that Eats and Drinks unworthily, Eats and\r\nDrinks damnation to himself._ And thus the Devil will by some abused\r\nScripture, Terrifie the Children of God; the Scripture is written as we\r\nare told, _For our Comfort_; but it is quoted by the Devil, _for our\r\nterror_. How many Godly Souls have been cast into sinful Doubts and\r\nFears, by the Devils foolish glosses upon that Scripture, _He that\r\ndoubts is Damned;_ and that, _the fearful shall have their portion in\r\nthe burning Lake;_ The Devil sometimes has play'd the _Preacher_, but I\r\nsay, _Beware all silly Souls when such a fool is Preaching._\r\n\r\nV. Grievous and Pulling Hurries to _Self-Murder_ are none of the\r\nsmallest outrages, which the Devil in his _Temptations_ commits upon us.\r\nWhy, did the Devil say to our Lord, _Cast thy self down_, but in hopes\r\nthat our Lord would have broke his Bones, in the fall? The Devil is an\r\n_Old Murtherer_; and he loves to _Murder_ men; but no _Murder_ gives\r\nhim so much satisfaction, as that which at his instigation, men\r\nperpetrate upon themselves. We see that such as are _Bewitched_ and\r\n_Possessed_ by the Devil, do quickly lay violent hands upon themselves,\r\nif they be not watched continually, and we see that when persons have\r\nbegun that _Unnatural_ business of _killing themselves_, there is a\r\n_Preternatural_ Stupendious Prodigious Assistance, by the Devil given\r\nthereunto. When people are going to Harm themselves, we call upon them,\r\nlike those to the Jailor, in _Acts 16.28._ _Do thy self no harm!_ And we\r\nhave this Argument for it, _It is the Devil that is dragging of you to\r\nthis mischief; but will you believe, will you obey such an one as the\r\nDevil is?_ What was it that made _Judas_ to strangle himself? We read it\r\nwas when the _Devil was in him_. I suppose there are few\r\n_self-murderers_, but what are first very strangely fallen into the\r\nDevils hands; and possibly, 'tis by some Extraordinary _Discontent_,\r\nagainst God, or _back-sliding_ from him, that the Devil first entred\r\ninto those disturbed Souls. Indeed, some very great Saints of God, have\r\nsometimes had hideous Royls raised by the Devil in their minds; untill\r\nthey have e'en cry'd out with _Job_, _I choose strangling rather than\r\nLife;_ and sometimes the ill Humours or Vapours in the Bodies of such\r\nGood Men, do so harbour the Devil that they have this woful motion every\r\nday thence made unto them; _You must Kill your self! you must! you\r\nmust!_ But it is rarely any other than a _Saul_, an _Abimelek_, an\r\n_Achitophel_, or a _Judas_; rarely any other, than a very Reprobate,\r\nwhom the Devil can drive, while the man is _Compos Mentis_, to\r\nConsummate such a Villany. Yea, no Child of God, in his Right Senses\r\ncan go so far in this impiety, as to be left without all Time and Room\r\nfor true _Repentance_ of the Crime; 'tis _thus_ done, by none but those\r\nthat go to the Devil. A _self-murder_, acted by one that is upon other\r\naccounts a Reasonable man, is but such an attempt of Revenge upon the\r\nGod that made him, as none but one full of the Devil can be guilty of.\r\nIf any of you are Dragoon'd by the Devil, unto the murdering of your\r\nselves, my Advice to you is, _Disclose it_, _Reveal it_, _make it known\r\nimmediately_. One that Cut his own Throat among us, Expired crying out,\r\n_O that I had told! O that I had told._ You may spoil the Devil, if\r\nyou'l _Tell_ what he is a doing of.\r\n\r\nVI. Presumptuous and Unwarrantable _Trials_ of the Blessed God, are some\r\nof those things whereinto the Devil would fain hook us with his\r\n_Temptations_. This was that which the Devil would have brought our Lord\r\nunto, even, _A tempting of the Lord our God_. It is the charge of our\r\nGod upon us, in _Deut. 6.16._ _Thou shalt not Tempt the Lord thy God._\r\nBut that which the Devil _Tries_, is, to put us upon _Trying_ in a\r\nsinful way, whether God be such a God as indeed he is. 'Tis true as to\r\nthe ways of Obedience, our God says unto us, _Prove me, in those ways;\r\nTry, whether I won't be as good as my Word._ But then there are ways of\r\n_Presumption_, wherein the Devil would have us to trie, what a God it\r\nis, _With whom we have to do_. The Devil would have us to trie the\r\nPurpose of God, about our selves or others; but how? By going to the\r\n_Devil_ himself; by Consulting _Astrologers_, or _Fortune Tellers_; or\r\nperhaps by letting the Bible fall open, to see what is the first\r\nSentence we light upon. The Devil would have us trie the Mercy of God,\r\nbut how? By running into _Dangers_, which we have no call unto. He would\r\nhave us trie the Power of God; but how? By looking for good things,\r\nwithout the use of Means for the getting of them. He would have us trie\r\nthe Justice of God; but how? By venturing upon Sin in a _Corner_, with\r\nan Imagination that God will never bring us out. He would have us trie\r\nthe Promise of God; but how? By _Limiting_ the Lord, unto such or such a\r\nway of manifesting Himself, or else believing of nothing at all. He\r\nwould have us trie the Threatning of God; but how? By going on\r\nimpenitently in those things, for which the _Wrath of God comes upon the\r\nChildren of Disobedience_. Thus would the Devil have us to affront the\r\nMajesty of Heaven every day.\r\n\r\nVII. The _Temptations_ of the Devil, aim at puffing and bloating of us\r\nup, with _Pride_; as much perhaps as any one iniquity. The Devil would\r\nhave had Our Lord make a _Vain glorious_ Discovery of himself unto the\r\nWorld, by _Flying in the air_, so as no mortal can. _Hoc Ithacus\r\nvelit_--the Devil would have us to soar aloft, and not only to be above\r\nother men, but also to _know_ that we are so, _Pride_ is the Devils own\r\nsin; and he affects especially to be, _The King over the Children of\r\nPride_, it is a caution in _1 Tim. 3.6._ A Pastor must not be _A Novice_;\r\n_Lest being lifted up with Pride, He fall into the condemnation of the\r\nDevil._ (_Summo ac Pio cum Tremore Hunc Textum Legamus nos Ministri\r\nJuvenes!_) Accordingly, the Devil would have us to be inordinately taken\r\nand moved with what _Excellencies_ our God has bestowed upon us. If our\r\n_Estates_ rise, he would have us rise in our Spirits too. If we have\r\nbeen blessed with Beauty, with Breeding, with Honour, with Success, with\r\nAttire, with Spiritual Priviledges, or with Praise-worthy Performances;\r\nNow says the Devil, _Think thy self better than other Men._ Yea, the\r\nDevil would have us arrogate unto our selves, those _Excellencies_ which\r\nreally we never were owners of; and _Boast of a false Gift_. He would\r\nhave us moreover to Thirst after Applause among others that may see Our\r\n_Excellencies_! and be impatient if we are not accounted _some-body_. He\r\nwould have us furthermore, to aspire after such a _Figure_, as God has\r\nnever yet seen fitting for us; and croud into some _High Chair_ that\r\nbecomes us not. Thus would the Devil Elevate us into the _Air_, above\r\nour Neighbours; and why so? 'Tis that we may be punished with such\r\n_Falls_, as may make us cry out with _David_, _O my Bones are broken\r\nwith my Falls!_ The Devil can't endure to see men lying in the _Dust_;\r\nbecause there is no falling thence. He is a _Fallen Spirit_ himself, and\r\nit pleases him to see the _Falls_ of men.\r\n\r\n\r\nS. The Third of Our Lords Three Temptations, is related in such Terms as\r\nthese. _Matth. 4.8, 9._ _Again the Devil taketh him up, into an exceeding\r\nHigh Mountain, and sheweth him all the Kingdoms of the world, and the\r\nglory of them: and saith unto him, all these things will I give thee, if\r\nthou wilt fall down and Worship me._ From whence take these Remarks.\r\n\r\nI. The Devil in his _Temptations_ will set the Delight of this world\r\nbefore us; but he'll set a fair, and a false _Varnish_ upon those\r\nDelights. They were some unknown _Perspectives_, which the Devil had,\r\nboth for the Refracting of the _Medium_, and for the Magnifying of the\r\nObject, whereby he gave our Lord at once a prospect of the whole Roman\r\nEmpire; but what was it? It was the _World_, and the _Glory_ of it; he\r\nsays not a word of the _World_, and the _Trouble_ of it. No sure; not a\r\nword of that; the Devil will not have his Hook so barely expos'd unto\r\nus. The Devil sets off the Delights of Sin, which he offers unto us,\r\nwith a stretched and raised Rhetorick; but he will not own, _That in the\r\nmidst of our Laughter, our Heart shall be sorrowful;_ and _That the end\r\nof our Mirth shall be Heaviness._ There is but one Glass in the\r\nSpectacles, with which the Devil would have us to read, those passages\r\nin _Eccles. 11.9._ _Rejoyce, O young Man in thy youth, and let thy Heart\r\nchear thee in the Dayes of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy Heart,\r\nand in the sight of thine Eyes._ Thus far the Devil would have us to\r\nRead; and he'll make many a fine Comment upon it; he'll tell us, That if\r\nwe'll follow the Courses of the World, we shall swim in all the Delights\r\nof the World. But he is not willing you should Read out the next words;\r\n_But know thou, that for all these things God shall bring thee into\r\nJudgment._ O he's loth we should be aware of the dreadful Issues, and\r\nReckonings that our Worldly Delights will be attended with. He sets\r\nbefore us, _The Pleasures of Sin_; but he will not say, _These are but\r\nfor a Season._ He sets before us, _The sweet Waters of Stealth_; but he\r\nwill not say, _There is Death in the Pot._ He is a _Mountebank_, that\r\nwill bestow nothing but Romantic Praises upon all that he makes us the\r\nOffers of.\r\n\r\nII. There are most Hellish _Blasphemies_ often buzz'd by the\r\n_Temptations_ of the Devil, into the minds of the best Men alive. What a\r\nmost Execrable Thing was here laid before our Lord Himself: Even, To own\r\nthe _Devil as God_! a thing that can't be uttered, without unutterable\r\nHorror of Soul. The best man on earth, may have such _Fiery Darts_ from\r\nHell shot into his mind. One that was acted by the _Devil_, had the\r\nimpudence to propound this unto such a good man as _Job_, _Curse God_. And\r\nthe Devil pleases himself, by chusing the Hearts of good men, with his\r\nbase Injections, _That there is no God_, or, _That God is not a\r\nRighteous God_; and a thousand more such things, too Devilish to be\r\nmentioned. A good man is extreamly grieved at it, when he hears a\r\n_Blasphemy_ from the mouth of another man; said the Psalmist, in _Psal.\r\n44.15, 16._ _My Confusion is continually before me, for the voice of him\r\nthat Blasphemeth._ But much more when a good man finds a _Blasphemy_ in\r\nhis own Heart; O it throws him into most Fevourish Agonies of Soul. For\r\nthis cause, a mischievous Devil, will _Flie blow_ the Heart of such a\r\nman, with such Blasphemous Thoughts, as make him crie out, _Lord I am\r\ne'n weary of my life._ Yea, the Devil serves the man just as the\r\nMistress of _Joseph_ dealt with him; he importunes the man to think\r\nwickedly from Day to Day; and if the man refuse, he cries out at last,\r\n_Behold, what wicked thoughts this man has lodging in him._ Sayst thou\r\nso? _Satan!_ No, they are Baits of thy own; and at thy Door alone shall\r\nthey be laid for ever.\r\n\r\nIII. There is a sort of Witchcrafts in those things, whereto the\r\nTemptations of the Devil would inveigle us. To worship the Devil is\r\nWitchcraft, and under that notion was our Lord urged unto sin. We are\r\ntold in _1 Sam. 15.23._ _Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft:_ When\r\nthe Devil would have us to sin, he would have us to do the things which\r\nthe forlorn Witches use to do. Perhaps there are few persons, ever\r\nallured by the Devil unto an Explicit Covenant with himself. If any\r\namong ourselves be so, my councel is, that you hunt the Devil from you,\r\nwith such words as the Psalmist had, _Be gone, Depart from me, ye evil\r\nDoers, for I will keep the Commandments of my God._ But alas, the most\r\nof men, are by the Devil put upon doing the things that are Analogous to\r\nthe worst usages of Witches. The Devil says to the sinner, _Despise thy\r\nBaptism, and all the Bond of it, and all the Good of it._ The Devil says\r\nto the sinner, _Come, cast off the Authority of God, and refuse the\r\nSalvation of Christ for ever._ Yea, the Devil who is called, _The God of\r\nthis World_, would have us to take Him for Our God, and rather Hear Him,\r\nTrust Him, Serve Him, than the God that formed us.\r\n\r\nIV. The _Temptations_ of the Devil do Tug and Pull for nothing more,\r\nthan that the Rulers of the World may yield Homage unto him. Our Lord\r\nhas had this by his Father Engag'd unto him, _That he shall one day be\r\nGovernour of the Nations._ The Devil doe's extreamly dread the approach\r\nof that Illustrious time, when _The Kingdom of God shall come and his\r\nWill be done, as in Heaven, and on Earth._ For this cause it was that he\r\nwas desirous, Our Lord should rather have accepted of him, that Kingdom,\r\nwhich _Antichrist_ afterwards accepted of him, for the Establishment of\r\n_Devil-worship_, in the World. I may tell you, The Devil is mighty\r\nunwilling, that there should be one _Godly Magistrate_ upon the face of\r\nthe Earth. Such is the influence of _Government_, that the Devil will\r\nevery where stickle mightily, to have that siding with him. What\r\n_Rulers_ would the Devil have, to command all mankind, if he might have\r\nhis will? Even, such as are called in _Psal. 94.20._ _The throne of\r\niniquity, which frames mischief by a Law_; such as will promote Vice, by\r\nboth Connivance, and Example; and such as will oppress all that shall be\r\n_Holy, and Just, and Good_. All men have cause therefore to be jealous,\r\nwhat Use the Devil may make of them, with reference to the Affairs of\r\nGovernment; but Rulers may most of all think, that the Lord Jesus from\r\nHeaven calls upon them, _Satan has desired that he might Sift you, and\r\nhave you; O Look to it, what side you take._\r\n\r\nThus have you in the Temptations of our Lord, seen the principal of\r\nthose Devices, which the Devil has to Entrap our Souls. But what shall\r\nwe now do, that we may be fortified against those Devices? O that we\r\nmight be well furnished with the _Whole Armour of God_! But me thinks,\r\nthere were some things attending the Temptations of our Lord, which\r\nwould especially Recommend those few Hints unto us for our Guard.\r\n\r\nFirst, If you are not fond of Temptation, be not fond of Needless, or\r\nToo much Retirement. Where was it, that the Devil fell upon our Lord? it\r\nwas when he was Alone in the Wilderness. We should all have our Times to\r\nbe Alone every Day; and if the Devil go to scare us out of our\r\nChambers, with such a Bugbear, as that he'll appear to us, yet stay in\r\nspite of his teeth, stay to finish your Devotions; he Lyes, he dare not\r\nshew his head. But on the other-side by being too solitary, we may lay\r\nour selves too much open to the Devil; You know who says, _Wo to him\r\nthat is alone._\r\n\r\nSecondly, Let an _Oracle_ of God be your defence against a _Temptation_\r\nof _Hell_. How did our Lord silence the _Devil_? It was with an, _It is\r\nwritten!_ And _all_ his Three Citations were from that one Book of\r\n_Deuteronomy_. What a _full_ Armoury then have we, in _all_ the sacred\r\nPages that lie before us? Whatever the Words of the _Devil_ are, drown\r\nthem with the words of the _Great God_. Say, _It is Written_ The\r\n_Belshazzar_ of _Hell_ will Tremble and Withdraw, if you show these\r\n_Hand-Writings_ of the Lord.\r\n\r\nLastly, Since the Lord Jesus Christ has conquered all the _Temptations_\r\nof the Devil, Flie to that Lord, Crie to that Lord, that He would give\r\nyou a share in his Happy Victory. It was for Us that our Lord overcome\r\nthe Devil: and when he did but say, _Satan, Get hence_, away presently\r\nthe Tygre flew: Does the Devil molest Us? Then let us Repair to our\r\nLord, who says, _I know how to succour the Tempted._ Said the\r\n_Psalmist_, _Psal. 61.2._ _Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I._ A\r\nWoman in this Land being under the Possession of Devils, the Devils\r\nwithin her, audibly spoke of diverse Harms they would inflict upon her;\r\nbut still they made this answer, _Ah! She Runs to the Rock! She Runs to\r\nthe Rock!_ and that hindered all. O this _Running to the Rock_; 'tis\r\nthe best Preservation in the World; the _Vultures_ of _Hell_ cannot prey\r\nupon the _Doves_ in the _Clefts_ of that _Rock_. May our God now lead us\r\nthereunto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A FURTHER\r\n  ACCOUNT\r\n  OF THE\r\n  TRYALS\r\n  OF THE\r\n  \\New-England Witches\\.\r\n\r\n  WITH THE\r\n  OBSERVATIONS\r\n  Of a Person who was upon the Place several\r\n  Days when the suspected Witches were\r\n  first taken into Examination.\r\n\r\n  To which is added,\r\n\r\n  \\Cases of Conscience\\\r\n  Concerning Witchcrafts and Evil Spirits Personating\r\n  Men.\r\n\r\n  Written at the Request of the Ministers of _New-England_.\r\n\r\n  By _Increase Mather_, President of _Harvard_ Colledge.\r\n\r\n  \\Licensed and Entred according to Order.\\\r\n\r\n  _London_: Printed for \\J. Dunton\\, at the _Raven_ in the _Poultrey_.\r\n      1693. Of whom may be had the _Third Edition_ of Mr. _Cotton\r\n      Mather's First Account_ of the Tryals of the _New-England_\r\n      Witches, Printed on the same size with this _Last Account_, that\r\n      they may bind up together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A TRUE NARRATIVE of some Remarkable\r\n    Passages relating to sundry Persons afflicted\r\n    by _Witchcraft_ at _Salem_ Village in _New-England_,\r\n    which happened from the _19th._ of _March_\r\n    to the _5th._ of _April_, 1692.\r\n\r\nCOLLECTED BY DEODAT LAWSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Nineteenth day of _March_ last I went to _Salem_ Village, and\r\nlodged at _Nathaniel Ingersol's_ near to the Minister Mr. _P.'s_ House,\r\nand presently after I came into my Lodging, Capt. _Walcut's_ Daughter\r\n_Mary_ came to Lieut. _Ingersol's_ and spake to me; but suddenly after,\r\nas she stood by the Door, was bitten, so that she cried out of her\r\nWrist, and looking on it with a Candle, we saw apparently the marks of\r\nTeeth, both upper and lower set, on each side of her Wrist.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the Evening I went to give Mr. _P._ a Visit. When I\r\nwas there, his Kinswoman, _Abigail Williams_, (about 12 Years of Age)\r\nhad a grievous fit; she was at first hurried with violence to and fro in\r\nthe Room (though Mrs. _Ingersol_ endeavoured to hold her) sometimes\r\nmaking as if she would fly, stretching up her Arms as high as she could,\r\nand crying, _Whish, Whish, Whish_, several times; presently after she\r\nsaid, there was Goodw. _N._ and said, _Do you not see her? Why there she\r\nstands!_ And she said, Goodw. _N._ offered her THE BOOK, but she was\r\nresolved she would not take it, saying often, _I wont, I wont, I wont\r\ntake it, I do not know what Book it is: I am sure it is none of God's\r\nBook, it is the Devil's Book for ought I know._ After that, she ran to\r\nthe Fire, and begun to throw Fire-brands about the House, and run\r\nagainst the Back, as if she would run up Chimney, and, as they said, she\r\nhad attempted to go into the Fire in other Fits.\r\n\r\nOn Lords Day, the Twentieth of _March_, there were sundry of the\r\nafflicted Persons at Meeting, as Mrs. _Pope_, and Goodwife _Bibber_,\r\n_Abigail Williams_, _Mary Walcut_, _Mary Lewes_, and Doctor _Grigg's_\r\nMaid. There was also at Meeting, Goodwife _C._ (who was afterward\r\nExamined on suspicion of being a _Witch_:) They had several sore Fits in\r\nthe time of Publick Worship, which did something interrupt me in my\r\nfirst Prayer, being so unusual. After _Psalm_ was sung _Abigail\r\nWilliams_ said to me, _Now stand up, and name your Text!_ And after it\r\nwas read, she said, _It is a long Text._ In the beginning of Sermon,\r\nMrs. _Pope_, a Woman afflicted, said to me, _Now there is enough of\r\nthat._ And in the Afternoon, _Abigail Williams_, upon my referring to my\r\n_Doctrine_, said to me, _I know no Doctrine you had, If you did name\r\none, I have forgot it._\r\n\r\nIn Sermon time, when Goodwife _C._ was present in the Meeting-House,\r\n_Ab. W._ called out, _Look where Goodwife C. sits on the Beam suckling\r\nher Yellow Bird betwixt her fingers!_ _Ann Putman_, another Girle\r\nafflicted, said, _There was a Yellow Bird sat on my Hat as it hung on\r\nthe Pin in the Pulpit;_ but those that were by, restrained her from\r\nspeaking loud about it.\r\n\r\nOn _Monday_ the _21st._ of _March_, the Magistrates of _Salem_ appointed\r\nto come to Examination of Goodwife _C._ And about Twelve of the Clock\r\nthey went into the Meeting-House, which was thronged with Spectators.\r\nMr. _Noyes_ began with a very pertinent and pathetical _Prayer_; and\r\nGoodwife _C._ being called to answer to what was alledged against her,\r\nshe desired to go to _Prayer_, which was much wondred at, in the\r\npresence of so many hundred People: The Magistrates told her, they would\r\nnot admit it; they came not there to hear her Pray, but to Examine her,\r\nin what was Alledged against her. The Worshipful Mr. _Hathorne_ asked\r\nher, _Why she afflicted those Children?_ She said, she did not Afflict\r\nthem. He asked her, who did then? She said, _I do not know; How should I\r\nknow?_ The Number of the Afflicted Persons were about that time Ten,\r\n_viz._ Four Married Women, Mrs. _Pope_, Mrs. _Putman_, Goodwife\r\n_Bibber_, and an Ancient Woman, named _Goodall_; three Maids, _Mary\r\nWalcut_, _Mercy Lewes_, at _Thomas Putman's_, and a Maid at _Dr.\r\nGriggs's_; there were three Girls from 9 to 12 Years of Age, each of\r\nthem, or thereabouts, _viz._ _Elizabeth Parris_, _Abigail Williams_, and\r\n_Ann Putman_; these were most of them at Goodwife _C.'s_ Examination,\r\nand did vehemently Accuse her in the Assembly of Afflicting them, by\r\n_Biting_, _Pinching_, _Strangling_, _&c._ And that they in their Fits\r\nsee her Likeness coming to them, and bringing a _Book_ to them; she\r\nsaid, she had no _Book_; they affirmed, she had a _Yellow Bird_, that\r\nused to suck betwixt her Fingers, and being asked about it, if she had\r\nany _Familiar Spirit_, that attended her? she said, _She had no\r\nFamiliarity with any such thing._ She was a _Gospel Woman_: Which Title\r\nshe called her self by; and the Afflicted Persons told her, Ah! she was\r\n_A Gospel Witch_. _Ann Putman_ did there affirm, that one day when\r\nLieutenant _Fuller_ was at Prayer at her Father's House, she saw the\r\nshape of Goodwife _C._ and she thought Goodwife _N._ Praying at the same\r\ntime to the Devil; she was not sure it was Goodwife _N._ she thought it\r\nwas; but very sure she saw the shape of Goodwife _C._ The said _C._\r\nsaid, they were poor distracted Children, and no heed to be given to\r\nwhat they said. Mr. _Hathorne_ and Mr. _Noyes_ replyed, It was the\r\nJudgment of all that were present, they were _Bewitched_, and only she\r\nthe Accused Person said, they were _Distracted_. It was observed several\r\ntimes, that if she did but bite her under lip in time of Examination,\r\nthe Persons afflicted were bitten on their Arms and Wrists, and produced\r\nthe _Marks_ before the Magistrates, Ministers, and others. And being\r\nwatched for that, if she did but _Pinch_ her Fingers, or _Grasp_ one\r\nHand hard in another, they were Pinched, and produced the _Marks_ before\r\nthe Magistrates, and Spectators. After that, it was observed, that if\r\nshe did but lean her _Breast_ against the Seat in the Meeting-House,\r\n(being the _Bar_ at which she stood), they were afflicted. Particularly\r\nMrs. _Pope_ complained of grievous Torment in her _Bowels_, as if they\r\nwere torn out. She vehemently accused the said _C._ as the Instrument,\r\nand first threw her Muff at her; but that flying not home, she got off\r\nher _shoe_, and hit Goodwife _C._ on the Head with it. After these\r\nPostures were watched, if the said _C._ did but stir her Feet, they were\r\nafflicted in their _Feet_, and stamped fearfully. The afflicted Persons\r\nasked her, why she did not go to the Company of Witches which were\r\nbefore the Meeting-House Mustering? Did she not hear the _Drum_ beat?\r\nThey accused her of having Familiarity with the _Devil_, in the time of\r\nExamination, in the shape of a Black _Man_ whispering in her Ear; they\r\naffirmed, that her _Yellow Bird_ sucked betwixt her Fingers in the\r\nAssembly; and Order being given to see if there were any sign, the Girl\r\nthat saw it, said, it was too late now; she had removed a _Pin_, and put\r\nit on her _Head_; which was found _there_ sticking upright.\r\n\r\nThey told her, she had Covenanted with the _Devil_ for ten Years, six of\r\nthem were gone, and four more to come. She was required by the\r\nMagistrates to answer that Question in the Catechism, _How many persons\r\nbe there in the God-head?_ She answered it but oddly, yet was there no\r\ngreat thing to be gathered from it; she denied all that was charged upon\r\nher, and said, _They could not prove a Witch;_ she was that Afternoon\r\nCommitted to _Salem_ Prison; and after she was in Custody, she did not\r\nso appear to them, and afflict them as before.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday the _23d._ of _March_, I went to _Thomas Putman's_, on\r\npurpose to see his Wife: I found her lying on the Bed, having had a sore\r\nFit a little before; she spake to me, and said, she was glad to see me;\r\nher Husband and she both desired me to Pray with her while she was\r\nsensible; which I did, though the Apparition said, _I should not go to\r\nPrayer._ At the first beginning she attended; but after a little time,\r\nwas taken with a Fit; yet continued silent, and seemed to be _Asleep_:\r\nWhen Prayer was done, her Husband going to her, found her in a _Fit_; he\r\ntook her off the Bed, to set her on his Knees, but at first she was so\r\nstiff, she could not be bended; but she afterwards sat down, but quickly\r\nbegan to strive violently with her _Arms_ and _Leggs_; she then began to\r\nComplain of, and as it were to Converse Personally with, Goodwife _N._\r\nsaying, _Goodwife N. Be gone! Be gone! Be gone! are you not ashamed, a\r\nWoman of your Profession, to afflict a poor Creature so? What hurt did I\r\never do you in my life? You have but two Years to live, and then the\r\nDevil will torment your Soul; for this your Name is blotted out of God's\r\nBook, and it shall never be put in God's Book again; be gone for shame,\r\nare you not afraid of that which is coming upon you? I know, I know what\r\nwill make you afraid; the wrath of an Angry God, I am sure that will\r\nmake you afraid; be gone, do not torment me, I know what you would have_\r\n(we judged she meant, _her Soul_) _but it is out of your reach; it is\r\ncloathed with the white Robes of Christ's Righteousness._ After this,\r\nshe seemed to dispute with the Apparition about a particular _Text_ of\r\nScripture. The Apparition seemed to deny it; (the Womans Eyes being fast\r\nclosed all this time) she said, _She was sure there was such a Text_,\r\nand she would tell it; and then the Shape would be gone, for, said she,\r\n_I am sure you cannot stand before that Text!_ Then she was sorely\r\nAfflicted, her Mouth drawn on one side, and her Body strained for about\r\na Minute, and then said, _I will tell, I will tell; it is, it is, it\r\nis_, three or four times, and then was afflicted to hinder her from\r\ntelling, at last she broke forth, and said, _It is the third Chapter of\r\nthe Revelations._ I did something scruple the reading it, and did let my\r\nscruple appear, lest Satan should make any Superstitiously to improve\r\nthe Word of the Eternal God. However, tho' not versed in these things, I\r\njudged I might do it this once for an Experiment. I began to _read_, and\r\nbefore I had near read through the first Verse, she opened her Eyes, and\r\nwas well; this Fit continued near half an hour. Her Husband and the\r\nSpectators told me, she had often been so relieved by reading Texts that\r\nshe named, something pertinent to her Case; as _Isa. 40.1._ _Isa. 49.1._\r\n_Isa. 50.1._ and several others.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday the Twenty-Fourth of _March_, (being in course the\r\nLecture-Day at the Village,) Goodwife. _N._ was brought before the\r\nMagistrates Mr. _Hathorne_ and Mr. _Corwin_, about Ten of the Clock in\r\nthe Forenoon, to be Examined in the Meeting-House, the Reverend Mr.\r\n_Hale_ begun with Prayer, and the Warrant being read, she was required\r\nto give Answer, _Why she afflicted those persons?_ She pleaded her own\r\nInnocency with earnestness. _Thomas Putman's_ Wife, _Abigail Williams_,\r\nand _Thomas Putman's_ Daughter accused her that she appeared to them,\r\nand afflicted them in their Fits; but some of the others said, that they\r\nhad seen her, but knew not that ever she had hurt them; amongst which\r\nwas _Mary Walcut_, who was presently after she had so declared bitten,\r\nand cryed out of her in the Meeting-House, producing the _Marks_ of\r\n_Teeth_ on her wrist. It was so disposed, that I had not leisure to\r\nattend the whole time of Examination, but both Magistrates and Ministers\r\ntold me, that the things alledged by the afflicted, and defences made by\r\nher, were much after the same manner as the former was. And her motions\r\ndid produce like effects, as to _Biting_, _Pinching_, _Brusing_,\r\n_Tormenting_, at their _Breasts_, by her _Leaning_, and when bended\r\nback, were as if their Backs were broken. The afflicted Persons said,\r\nthe _Black Man_ whispered to her in the Assembly, and therefore she\r\ncould not hear what the Magistrates said unto her. They said also, that\r\nshe did then ride by the Meeting-House, behind the _Black Man_. _Thomas\r\nPutman's_ Wife had a grievous Fit in the time of Examination, to the\r\nvery great impairing of her strength, and wasting of her spirits,\r\ninsomuch as she could hardly move hand or foot when she was carried out.\r\nOthers also were there grievously afflicted, so that there was once such\r\na hideous scrietch and noise (which I heard as I walked at a little\r\ndistance from the Meeting-House) as did amaze me, and some that were\r\nwithin, told me the whole Assembly was struck with Consternation, and\r\nthey were afraid, that those that sate next to them were under the\r\nInfluence of _Witchcraft_. This Woman also was that day committed to\r\n_Salem_ Prison. The Magistrates and Ministers also did inform me, that\r\nthey apprehended a Child of _Sarah G._ and examined it, being between 4\r\nand 5 years of Age. And as to matter of Fact, they did unanimously\r\naffirm, that when this _Child_ did but cast its Eye upon the afflicted\r\nPersons, they were tormented; and they held her _Head_, and yet so many\r\nas her _Eye_ could fix upon were afflicted. Which they did several times\r\nmake careful Observation of: The afflicted complained, they had often\r\nbeen _Bitten_ by this Child, and produced the marks of _a small set of\r\nteeth_ accordingly; this was also committed to _Salem_ Prison, the Child\r\nlooked _hail, and well_ as other Children. I saw it at Lieut.\r\n_Ingersol's_. After the Commitment of Goodw. _N._ _Tho. Putman's_ Wife\r\nwas much better, and had no violent Fits at all from that _24th._ of\r\nMarch, to the _5th._ of _April_. Some others also said they had not seen\r\nher so frequently appear to them, to hurt them.\r\n\r\nOn the _25th._ of _March_ (as Capt. _Stephen Sewal_ of _Salem_ did\r\nafterwards inform me) _Eliz. Paris_ had sore Fits at his House, which\r\nmuch troubled _himself, and his Wife_, so as he told me they were almost\r\ndiscouraged. She related, that the great _Black Man_ came to her, and\r\ntold her, if she would be ruled by him, she should have whatsoever she\r\ndesired, and go to a _Golden City_. She relating this to Mrs. _Sewal_,\r\nshe told the Child, it was the _Devil_, and he was a _Lyar from the\r\nBeginning_, and bid her tell him so, if he came again: which she did\r\naccordingly, at the next coming to her, in her Fits.\r\n\r\nOn the _26th._ of _March_, Mr. _Hathorne_, Mr. _Corwin_, and Mr.\r\n_Higison_, were at the Prison-Keeper's House to Examine the Child, and\r\nit told them there, it had a little _Snake_ that used to suck on the\r\nlowest Joynt of its Fore-Finger; and when they enquired where, pointing\r\nto other places, it told them, not there, but _there_, pointing on the\r\nlowest Joint of the Fore-Finger, where they observed a deep Red Spot,\r\nabout the bigness of a _Flea-bite_; they asked who gave it that _Snake_?\r\nwhether the great Black Man? It said no, its Mother gave it.\r\n\r\nThe 31 of _March_ there was a _Publick Fast_ kept at _Salem_ on account\r\nof these Afflicted Persons. And _Abigail Williams_ said, that the\r\nWitches had a _Sacrament_ that day at an house in the Village, and that\r\nthey had _Red Bread_ and _Red Drink_. The first of _April_, _Mercy\r\nLewis_, _Thomas Putman's_ Maid, in her Fit, said, they did eat _Red\r\nBread_, like _Man's Flesh_, and would have had her eat some, but she\r\nwould not; but turned away her head, and spit at them, and said, _I will\r\nnot Eat, I will not Drink, it is Blood, &c._, she said, _That is not the\r\nBread of Life; that is not the Water of Life; Christ gives the Bread of\r\nLife; I will have none of it!_ The first of _April_ also _Mercy Lewis_\r\naforesaid saw in her Fit a _White Man_, and was with him in a glorious\r\nPlace, which had no _Candles_ nor _Sun_, yet was full of Light and\r\n_Brightness_; where was a great Multitude in White glittering Robes, and\r\nthey Sung the Song in the fifth of _Revelation_, the 9th verse, and the\r\n110 _Psalm_, and the 149 _Psalm_; and said with her self, _How long\r\nshall I stay here! let me be along with you:_ She was loth to leave this\r\nplace, and grieved that she could tarry no longer. This _white Man_ hath\r\nappeared several times to some of them, and given them notice how long\r\nit should be before they had another Fit, which was sometimes a day, or\r\nday and half, or more or less, it hath fallen out accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe 3d of _April_, the Lord's-day, being Sacrament-day, at the Village,\r\n_Goodw. C._ upon Mr. _Parris's_ naming his Text, _John 6.70._ _One of\r\nthem is a Devil_, the said _Goodw. C._ went immediately out of the\r\nMeeting-House, and flung the Door after her violently, to the amazement\r\nof the Congregation. She was afterwards seen by some in their Fits, who\r\nsaid, _O +Goodw. C.+ I did not think to see you here!_ (and being at\r\ntheir _Red bread and drink_) said to her, _Is this a time to receive the\r\nSacrament, you ran away on the Lord's-Day, and scorned to receive it in\r\nthe Meeting-House, and, Is this a time to receive it? I wonder at you!_\r\nThis is the sum of what I either saw my self, or did receive Information\r\nfrom persons of undoubted Reputation and Credit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS OF THINGS MORE THAN ORDINARY ABOUT THE\r\n\r\nAFFLICTED PERSONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. They are in their Fits tempted to be _Witches_, are shewed the List\r\nof the Names of others, and are tortured, because they will not yeild to\r\nSubscribe, or meddle with, or touch the BOOK, and are promised to have\r\npresent Belief if they would do it.\r\n\r\n2. They did in the Assembly mutually _Cure_ each other, even with a\r\n_Touch_ of their Hand, when Strangled, and otherwise Tortured; and would\r\nendeavour to get to their Afflicted, to relieve them.\r\n\r\n3. They did also foretel when anothers Fit was a-coming, and would say,\r\n_Look to her!_ she will have a Fit presently, which fell out\r\naccordingly, as many can bear witness, that heard and saw it.\r\n\r\n4. That at the same time, when the _Accused_ Person was present, the\r\n_Afflicted Persons_ saw her Likeness in other places of the\r\nMeeting-House, suckling her _Familiar_, sometimes in one place and\r\nposture, and sometimes in another.\r\n\r\n5. That their Motions in their Fits are _Preternatural_, both as to the\r\nmanner, which is so strange as a well person could not Screw their Body\r\ninto; and as to the violence also it is preternatural being much beyond\r\nthe Ordinary force of the same person when they are in their right mind.\r\n\r\n6. The _eyes_ of some of them in their fits are exceeding fast closed,\r\nand if you ask a question they can give no answer, and I do believe they\r\ncannot hear at that time, yet do they plainely converse with the\r\nAppearances, as if they did discourse with real persons.\r\n\r\n7. They are utterly pressed against any persons _Praying_ with them, and\r\ntold by the appearances, they shall not go to _Prayer_, so _Tho.\r\nPutman's_ wife was told, _I should not Pray;_ but she said, _I should:_\r\nand after I had done, reasoned with the _Appearance_, _Did not I say he\r\nshould go to Prayer._\r\n\r\n8. The forementioned _Mary W._ being a little better at ease, the\r\nAfflicted persons said, _she had signed the Book_; and that was the\r\nreason she was better. Told me by _Edward Putman_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS CONCERNING THE ACCUSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. For introduction to the discovery of those that afflicted them, It is\r\nreported Mr. _Parris's_ Indian Man, and Woman, made a Cake of _Rye\r\nMeal_, and the Childrens water, baked it in the Ashes, and gave it to a\r\nDog, since which they have discovered, and seen particular persons\r\nhurting of them.\r\n\r\n2. In Time of Examination, they seemed little affected, though all the\r\nSpectators were much grieved to see it.\r\n\r\n3. _Natural_ Actions in them produced _Preternatural_ actions in the\r\nAfflicted, so that they are their own _Image_ without any _Poppits_ of\r\nWax or otherwise.\r\n\r\n4. That they are accused to have a Company about 23 or 24 and they did\r\n_Muster in Armes_, as it seemed to the Afflicted Persons.\r\n\r\n5. Since they were confined, the Persons have not been so much Afflicted\r\nwith their appearing to them, _Biteing_ or _Pinching_ of them &c.\r\n\r\n6. They are reported by the Afflicted Persons to keep dayes of _Fast_\r\nand dayes of _Thanksgiving_, and _Sacraments_; Satan endeavours to\r\nTransforme himself to an _Angel of Light_, and to make his Kingdom and\r\nAdministrations to resemble those of our Lord Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n7. Satan Rages Principally amongst the Visible Subjects of Christ's\r\nKingdom and makes use (at least in appearance) of some of them to\r\nAfflict others; that _Christ's Kingdom, may be divided against it self_,\r\nand so be weakened.\r\n\r\n8. Several things used in _England_ at Tryal of Witches, to the Number\r\nof 14 or 15 which are wont to pass instead of, or in Concurrence with\r\n_Witnesses_, at least 6 or 7 of them are found in these accused: see\r\n_Keebles Statutes_.\r\n\r\n9. Some of the most solid Afflicted Persons do affirme the same things\r\nconcerning _seeing_ the accused _out_ of their Fitts as well as _in_\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n10. The Witches had a _Fast_, and told one of the Afflicted Girles, she\r\nmust not _Eat_, because it was _Fast Day_, she said, she _would_: they\r\ntold her they would _Choake_ her then; which when she did eat, was\r\nendeavoured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FURTHER ACCOUNT OF THE TRYALS OF\r\n\r\nTHE NEW-ENGLAND WITCHES, SENT IN A LETTER FROM\r\n\r\nTHENCE, TO A GENTLEMAN IN LONDON.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere were in _Salem_, _June 10, 1692_, about 40 persons that were\r\nafflicted with horrible torments by _Evil Spirits_, and the afflicted\r\nhave accused 60 or 70 as Witches, for that they have _Spectral\r\nappearances_ of them, tho the Persons are absent when they are\r\ntormented. When these Witches were Tryed, several of them confessed a\r\ncontract with the Devil, by signing his Book, and did express much\r\nsorrow for the same, declaring also thir _Confederate Witches_, and said\r\nthe Tempters of them desired 'em to sign the _Devils Book_, who\r\ntormented them till they did it. There were at the time of\r\n_Examination_, before many hundreds of Witnesses, strange Pranks play'd;\r\nsuch as the taking Pins out of the Clothes of the afflicted, and\r\nthrusting them into their flesh, many of which were taken out again by\r\nthe _Judges_ own hands. Thorns also in like kind were thrust into their\r\nflesh; the accusers were sometimes _struck dumb, deaf, blind_, and\r\nsometimes lay as if they were dead for a while, and all foreseen and\r\ndeclared by the afflicted just before it 'twas done. Of the afflicted\r\nthere were two Girls, about _12 or 13 years of age_, who saw all that\r\nwas done, and were therefore called the _Visionary Girls_; they would\r\nsay, _Now he, or she, or they, are going to bite or pinch the Indian_;\r\nand all there present in Court saw the visible marks on the _Indians_\r\narms; they would also cry out, _Now look, look, they are going to bind\r\nsuch an ones Legs_, and all present saw the same person spoken of, fall\r\nwith her Legs twisted in an extraordinary manner; Now say they, we shall\r\nall fall, and immediately 7 or 8 of the afflicted fell down, with\r\n_terrible shrieks and Out-crys_; at the time when one of the Witches was\r\n_sentenc'd, and pinnion'd_ with a Cord, at the same time was the\r\nafflicted _Indian_ Servant going home, (being about 2 or 3 miles out of\r\ntown,) and had both his Wrists at the same instant bound about with a\r\nlike Cord, in the same manner as she was when she was sentenc'd, but\r\nwith that violence, that the Cord entred into his flesh, not to be\r\nuntied, nor hardly cut----Many _Murders_ are suppos'd to be in this way\r\ncommitted; for these Girls, and others of the afflicted, say, _they see\r\nCoffins, and bodies in Shrowds_, rising up, and looking on the accused,\r\ncrying, _Vengeance, Vengeance on the Murderers_----Many other strange\r\nthings were transacted before the Court in the time of their\r\nExamination; and especially one thing which I had like to have forgot,\r\nwhich is this, One of the accus'd, whilst the rest were under\r\nExamination, was drawn up by a Rope to the Roof of the house where he\r\nwas, and would have been choak'd in all probability, had not the Rope\r\nbeen presently cut; the Rope hung at the Roof by some _invisible tye_,\r\nfor there was no hole where it went up; but after it was cut the\r\n_remainder_ of it was found in the Chamber just above, lying by the very\r\nplace where it hung down.\r\n\r\nIn _December 1692_, the Court sate again at _Salem_ in _New-England_,\r\nand cleared about 40 persons suspected for Witches, and Condemned three.\r\nThe Evidence against these three was the same as formerly, so the\r\nWarrant for their Execution was sent, and the _Graves digged_ for the\r\nsaid three, and for about five more that had been Condemned at _Salem_\r\nformerly, but were Repreived by the Governour.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of _February 1693_, the Court sate at _Charles-Town_\r\nwhere the Judge exprest himself to this effect.\r\n\r\n_That who it was that obstructed the Execution of Justice, or hindred\r\nthose good proceedings they had made, he knew not, but thereby the\r\nKingdom of Satan was advanc'd_, &c. _and the Lord have mercy on this\r\nCountry:_ and so declined coming any more into Court. In his absence\r\n_Mr. D----_ sate as Chief Judge 3 several days, in which time 5 or 6\r\nwere clear'd by Proclamation, and almost as many by Trial; so that all\r\nare acquitted.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable was an Old Woman named _Dayton_, of whom it was\r\nsaid, _If any in the World were a Witch, she was one, and had been so\r\naccounted 30 years._ I had the Curiosity to see her tried; she was a\r\ndecrepid Woman of about 80 years of age, and did not use many words in\r\nher own defence. She was accused by about 30 Witnesses; but the matter\r\nalledged against her was such as needed little apology, on her part not\r\none passionate word, or immoral action, or evil, was then objected\r\nagainst her for 20 years past, only strange accidents falling out, after\r\nsome Christian admonition given by her, as saying, _God would not\r\nprosper them, if they wrong'd the Widow._ Upon the whole, there was not\r\nproved against her any thing worthy of Reproof, or just admonition, much\r\nless so heinous a Charge.\r\n\r\nSo that by the _Goodness_ of God we are once more out of present danger\r\nof this _Hobgoblin Monster_; the standing Evidence used at _Salem_ were\r\ncalled, but did not appear.\r\n\r\nThere were others also at _Charles-town_ brought upon their _Tryals_,\r\nwho had formerly confess'd themselves to be Witches; but upon their\r\ntryals deny'd it, and were all clear'd; So that at present there is no\r\n_further prosecution of any_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CASES of CONSCIENCE\r\n  Concerning\r\n  Evil Spirits\r\n  Personating MEN;\r\n  WITCHCRAFTS,\r\n  Infallible Proofs of Guilt in such as are\r\n  Accused with that CRIME.\r\n\r\n  All Considered according to the Scriptures, History,\r\n  Experience, and the Judgment of many Learned\r\n  MEN.\r\n\r\n  By _Increase Mather_, President of _Harvard_ Colledge at _Cambridge_,\r\n  and Teacher of a Church at _Boston_ in _New England_.\r\n\r\n  PROV. xxii. xxi.\r\n\r\n  _----That thou mightest Answer the Words of Truth, to them\r\n  that send unto thee._\r\n\r\n  _Efficiunt Daemones, ut quae non sunt, sic tamen, quasi sint,\r\n    conspicienda hominibus exhibeant._ _Lactantius_ Lib. 2. _Instit._\r\n    Cap. 15. _Diabolus Consulitur, cum iis mediis utimur aliquid\r\n    Cognoscendi, quae a Diabolo sunt introducta._ _Ames Cas.

The awful hand of God now upon us, in letting loose of evil Angels\r\namong us to perpetrate such horrid Mischiefs, and suffering of Hell's\r\nInstruments to do such fearful things as have been scarce heard of; hath\r\nput serious persons into deep Musings, and upon curious Enquiries what\r\nis to be done for the detecting and defeating of this tremendous design\r\nof the grand Adversary: And, tho' all that fear God are agreed, +That no\r\nevil is to be done, that good may come of it+; yet hath the Devil\r\nobtained not a little of his design, in the divisions of Reuben, about\r\nthe application of this Rule._\r\n\r\n_That there are Devils and Witches, the Scripture asserts, and\r\nexperience confirms, That they are common enemies of Mankind, and set\r\nupon mischief, is not to be doubted: That the Devil can (by Divine\r\nPermission) and often doth vex men in Body and Estate, without the\r\nInstrumentality of Witches, is undeniable: That he often hath, and\r\ndelights to have the concurrence of Witches, and their consent in\r\nharming men, is consonant to his native Malice to Man, and too\r\nlamentably exemplified: That Witches, when detected and convinced, ought\r\nto be exterminated and cut off, we have God's warrant for, +Exod. 22.18.+\r\nOnly the same God who hath said, +thou shalt not suffer a Witch to\r\nlive+; hath also said, +at the Mouth of two Witnesses, or three\r\nWitnesses shall he that is worthy of Death, be put to Death: But at the\r\nMouth of one Witness, he shall not be put to Death+, +Deut. 17.6.+ Much\r\ndebate is made about what is sufficient Conviction, and some have (in\r\ntheir Zeal) supposed that a less clear evidence ought to pass in this\r\nthan in other Cases, supposing that else it will be hard (if possible)\r\nto bring such to condign Punishment, by reason of the close conveyances\r\nthat there are between the Devil and Witches; but this is a very\r\ndangerous and unjustifiable tenet. Men serve God in doing their Duty, he\r\nnever intended that all persons guilty of Capital Crimes should be\r\ndiscovered and punished by men in this Life, though they be never so\r\ncurious in searching after Iniquity. It is therefore exceeding necessary\r\nthat in such a day as this, men be informed what is Evidence and what is\r\nnot. It concerns men in point of Charity; for tho' the most shining\r\nProfessor may be secretly a most abominable Sinner, yet till he be\r\ndetected, our Charity is bound to Judge according to what appears: and\r\nnotwithstanding that a clear evidence must determine a case; yet\r\npresumptions must be weighed against presumptions, and Charity is not to\r\nbe forgone as long as it has the most preponderating on its side. And it\r\nis of no less necessity in point of Justice; there are not only\r\nTestimonies required by God, which are to be credited according to the\r\nRules given in his Word referring to witnesses: But there is also an\r\nEvidence supposed to be in the Testimony, which is throughly to be\r\nweighed, and if it do not infallibly prove the Crime against the person\r\naccused, it ought not to determine him guilty of it; for so a righteous\r\nMan may be Condemned unjustly. In the case of Witchcrafts we know that\r\nthe Devil is the immediate Agent in the Mischief done, the consent or\r\ncompact of the Witch is the thing to be Demonstrated._\r\n\r\n_Among many Arguments to evince this, that which is most under present\r\ndebate, is that which refers to something vulgarly called +Spectre\r\nEvidence+, and a certain sort of Ordeal or trial by the sight and touch.\r\nThe principal Plea to justifie the convictive Evidence in these, is\r\nfetcht from the Consideration of the Wisdom and Righteousness of God in\r\nGoverning the World, which they suppose would fail, if such things were\r\npermitted to befal an innocent person; but it is certain, that too\r\nresolute conclusions drawn from hence, are bold usurpations upon\r\nspotless +Sovereignty+: and tho' some things if suffered to be common,\r\nwould subvert this Government, and disband, yea ruine Humane Society;\r\nyet God doth sometimes suffer such things to evene, that we may thereby\r\nknow how much we are beholden to him, for that restraint which he lays\r\nupon the Infernal Spirits, who would else reduce a World into a Chaos.\r\nThat the Resolutions of such Cases as these is proper for the Servants\r\nof Christ in the Ministry cannot be denied; the seasonableness of doing\r\nit now, will be justified by the Consideration of the necessity there is\r\nat this time of a right Information of men's Judgments about these\r\nthings, and the danger of their being misinformed._\r\n\r\n_The Reverend, Learned, and Judicious Author of the ensuing Cases, is\r\ntoo well known to need our Commendation: All that we are concerned in,\r\nis to +assert our hearty Consent to, and Concurrence with the substance\r\nof what is contained in the following Discourse+: And, with our hearty\r\nRequest to God, that he would discover the depths of this Hellish\r\nDesign; direct in the whole management of this Affair; prevent the\r\ntaking any wrong steps in this dark way; and that he would in particular\r\nBless these faithful Endeavours of his Servant to that end, we Commend\r\nit and you to his Divine Benediction._\r\n\r\n  William Hubbard.\r\n  Samuel Phillips.\r\n  Charles Morton.\r\n  James Allen.\r\n  Michael Wigglesworth.\r\n  Samuel Whiting, _Sen._\r\n  Samuel Willard.\r\n  John Baily.\r\n  Jabez Fox.\r\n  Joseph Gerrish.\r\n  Samuel Angier.\r\n  John Wise.\r\n  Joseph Capen.\r\n  Nehemiah Walter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASES OF CONSCIENCE CONCERNING\r\n\r\nWITCHCRAFTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Case that I am desired to express my Judgment in, is this,\r\n_Whether it is not Possible for the Devil to impose on the imaginations\r\nof Persons Bewitched, and to cause them to Believe that an Innocent, yea\r\nthat a Pious person does torment them, when the Devil himself doth it;\r\nor whether Satan may not appear in the Shape of an Innocent and Pious,\r\nas well as of a Nocent and Wicked Person, to Afflict such as suffer by\r\nDiabolical Molestations?_\r\n\r\nThe Answer to the Question must be Affirmative; Let the following\r\nArguments be duely weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Argu. 1._ There are several Scriptures from which we may infer the\r\nPossibility of what is Affirmed.\r\n\r\n1. We find that the _Devil by the Instigation of the Witch at Endor\r\nappeared in the Likeness of the Prophet Samuel_. I am not ignorant that\r\nsome have asserted that, which, if it were proved, would evert this\r\nArgument, _viz._ that it was the true and not a delusive _Samuel_ which\r\nthe Witch brought to converse with _Saul_. Of this Opinion are some of\r\nthe Jewish Rabbies[1] and some Christian Doctors[2] and many late Popish\r\nAuthors[3] amongst whom _Cornel. a Lapide_ is most elaborate. But that\r\nit was a _Daemon_ representing _Samuel_ has been evinced by learned and\r\nOrthodox Writers: especially [4]_Peter Martyr_, [5]_Balduinus\r\n[6]Lavater_, and our incomparable _John Rainolde_. I shall not here\r\ninsist on the clearing of that, especially considering, that elsewhere I\r\nhave done it: only let me add, that the Witch said to _Saul_, _I see\r\nElohim_, i. e. _A God_; (for the whole Context shows, that a single\r\nPerson is intended) _Ascending out of the Earth_. _1 Sam. 28.13._ The\r\nDevil would be Worshipped as a God, and _Saul_ now, that he was become a\r\n_Necromancer_, must bow himself to him. Moreover, had it been the true\r\n_Samuel_ from Heaven reprehending _Saul_, there is great Reason to\r\nbelieve, that he would not only have reproved him for his sin, in not\r\nexecuting Judgment on the _Amalekites_; as in Ver. 18. But for his\r\nWickedness in consulting with Familiar Spirits: For which Sin it was in\r\nspecial that he died. _2 Chron. 10.13._ But in as much as there is not\r\none word to testify against that Abomination, we may conclude that it\r\nwas not real _Samuel_ that appeared to _Saul_: and if it were the Devil\r\nin his likeness, the Argument seems very strong, that if the Devil may\r\nappear in the form of a Saint in Glory, much more is it possible for him\r\nto put on the likeness of the most Pious and Innocent Saint on Earth.\r\nThere are, who acknowledge that a _Daemon_ may appear in the shape of a\r\nGodly Person, _But not as doing Evil_. Whereas the Devil in _Samuel's_\r\nlikeness told a pernicious Lye, when he said, _Thou hath disquieted me._\r\nIt was not in the Power of _Saul_, nor of all the Devils in Hell, to\r\ndisquiet a Soul in Heaven, where _Samuel_ had been for Two years before\r\nthis Apparition. Nor did the _Spectre_ speak true, when he said, _Thou\r\nand thy Sons shall be with me:_ Tho' _Saul_ himself at his Death went to\r\nbe with the Devil, his Son _Jonathan_ did not so. Besides, (which suits\r\nwith the matter in hand) the Devil in _Samuels_ shape confirmed\r\n_Necromancy_ and _Cursed Witchery_. He that can in the likeness of\r\nSaints encourage Witches to Familiarity with Hell, may possibly in the\r\nlikeness of a Saint afflict a Bewitched Person. But this we see from\r\nScripture, Satan may be permitted to do.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas it is objected, that the Devil may appear indeed in the form\r\nof Dead Persons, but that he cannot represent such as are living; The\r\ncontrary is manifest. No Question had _Saul_ said to the Witch, bring me\r\n_David_ who was then living, she could as easily have shown living\r\n_David_ as dead _Samuel_, as easily as that great Conjurer of whom\r\n[7]_Wierus_ speaks, brought the appearance of _Hector_ and _Achilles_,\r\nand after that of _David_ before the Emperour _Maximilian_.\r\n\r\nAnd that evil Angels have sometimes appeared in the likeness of living\r\nabsent persons, is a thing abundantly confirmed by History.\r\n\r\n[8]_Austin_ tells us of one that went for resolution in some intricate\r\nQuestions to a Philosopher, of whom he could get no Answer; but in the\r\nNight the Philosopher comes to him, and resolves all his Doubts. Not\r\nlong after, he demanded the reason why he could not answer him in the\r\nDay as well as in the Night; The Philosopher professed he was not with\r\nhim in the Night, only acknowledged that he dreamed of his having such\r\nconversation of his Friend, but he was all the time at home, and asleep.\r\n_Paulus_ and _Palladius_ did both of them profess to _Austin_, that one\r\nin his shape, had divers times, and in divers places appeared to them:\r\n[9]_Thyreus_ mentions several Apparitions of absent living persons,\r\nwhich happened in his time, and which he had the certain knowledge of. A\r\nMan that is in one place cannot (_Autoprosopos_) at the same time be in\r\nanother. It remains then that such _Spectres_ are Prodigious and\r\nSupernatural, and not without Diabolical Operation. It has been\r\nControverted among Learned Men, whether innocent Persons may not by the\r\nmalice and deluding Power of the Devil be represented as present amongst\r\nWitches at their dark Assemblies. The mentioned _Thyreus_ says, that the\r\nDevil may, and often does represent the forms of Innocent Persons out of\r\nthose Conventions, and that there is no Question to be made of it, but\r\nas to his natural Power and Art he is able to make their shapes appear\r\namongst his own Servants, but he supposeth the Providence of God will\r\nnot suffer such an Injury to be done to an Innocent Person. With him\r\n[10]_Delrio_, and _Spineus_ concur. But _Cumanus_ in his _Lucerna\r\nInquisitorum_ (a Book which I have not yet seen) defends the Affirmative\r\nin this Question. _Bins Fieldius_ in his Treatise, concerning the\r\nConfession of Witches, inclines to the Negative, only [11]he\r\nacknowledges _Dei extraordinaria Permissione posse Innocentes sic\r\nrepresentari._ And he that shall assert, that Great and Holy God never\r\ndid nor ever will permit the Devil thus far to abuse an Innocent Person,\r\naffirms more than he is able to prove. The story of _Germanus_ his\r\ndiscovering a Diabolical illusion of this nature, concerning a great\r\nnumber of Persons that seemed to be at a Feast when they were really at\r\nhome and asleep, is mentioned by many Authors. But the particulars\r\ninsisted on, do sufficiently evince the Truth of what we assert, _viz._\r\nThat the Devil may by Divine Permission appear in the shape of Innocent\r\nand Pious Persons. Nevertheless, It is evident from another Scripture,\r\n_viz._ that in _2 Cor. 11.14._ _For Satan himself is transformed into an\r\nAngel of Light._ He seems to be what he is not, and makes others seem to\r\nbe what they are not. He represents evil men as good, and good men as\r\nevil. The Angels of Heaven, (who are the Angels of Light) love Truth and\r\nRighteousness, the Devil will seem to do so too; and does therefore\r\nsometimes lay before men excellent good Principles and exhort them (as\r\nhe did _Theodore Maillit_) to practise many things, which by the Law of\r\nRighteousness they are obliged unto, and hereby he does more effectually\r\ndeceive. Is it not strange, that he has sometimes intimated to his most\r\ndevoted servants, that if they would have familiar Conversation with\r\nhim, they must be careful to keep themselves from enormous Sins, and\r\npray constantly for Divine Protection? But so has he transformed\r\nhimself into an Angel of Light, as [12]_Boissardus_ sheweth. He has\r\nfrequently appeared to Men pretending to be a good Angel, so to\r\n_Anatolius_ of old; and the late instances of [13]Dr. _Dee_ and _Kellet_\r\nare famously known. How many deluded _Enthusiasts_ both in former and\r\nlatter times have been imposed on by Satans appearing visibly to them,\r\npretending to be a good Angel. And moreover, he may be said to transform\r\nhimself into an _Angel of Light_, because of his appearing in the Form\r\nof _Holy Men_, who are the _Children of Light_, yea in the shape and\r\nhabit of Eminent Ministers of God. So did he appear to Mr. _Earl_ of\r\n_Colchester_ in the likeness of Mr. _Liddal_ an Holy Man of God, and to\r\nthe _Turkish Chaous_ Baptized at _London_, _Anno 1658._ pretending to be\r\nMr. _Dury_ an Excellent Minister of Christ. And how often has he\r\npretended to be the Apostle _Paul_ or _Peter_ or some other celebrated\r\nSaint? Ecclesiastical Histories abound with Instances of this nature.\r\nYea, sometimes he has transfigured himself into the Form of Christ. It\r\nis reported that he appeared to [14]St. _Martin_ Gloriously arrayed, as\r\nif he had been Christ. So likewise to [15]_Secundellus_, and to another\r\nSaint, who suspecting it was Satan, transforming himself into an _Angel\r\nof Light_ had this expression, _If I may see Christ in Heaven it is\r\nenough, I desire not to see him in this World_; whereupon the _Spectre_\r\nvanished. It has been related of _Luther_, that after he had been\r\nFasting and Praying in his Study, the Devil come pretending to be\r\nChrist, but _Luther_ saying, _away thou confounded Devil, I acknowledge\r\nno Christ but what is in my Bible_, nothing more was seen. Thus then the\r\nDevil is able (by Divine Permission) to Change himself into what form or\r\nfigure he pleaseth,\r\n\r\n    _Omnia transformat sese in miracula rerum._\r\n\r\nA Third Scripture to our purpose is that, in _Rev. 12.10._ where the\r\nDevil is called the _Accuser of the Brethren_. Such is the malice and\r\nimpudence of the Devil, as that he does accuse good Men, and that before\r\nGod, and that not only of such Faults as they really are guilty of, he\r\naccused _Joshua_ with his filthy Garments, when through his Indulgence\r\nsome of his Family had transgressed by unlawful Marriages, _Zach. 3.23._\r\nwith _Ezra. 10.18._ but also with such Crimes, as they are altogether\r\nfree from. He represented the Primitive Christians as the vilest of men,\r\nand as if at their Meetings they did commit the most nefandous Villanies\r\nthat ever were known; and that not only Innocent, but Eminently Pious\r\nPersons should thro' the malice of the Devil be accused with the Crime\r\nof Witchcraft, is no new thing. Such an Affliction did the Lord see meet\r\nto exercise the great _Athanasius_ with[16] only the Divine Providence\r\ndid wonderfully vindicate him from that as well as from some other foul\r\nAspersions. The _Waldenses_ (altho' the Scriptures call them _Saints_,\r\n_Rev. 13.7._) have been traduced by Satan and by the World as horrible\r\nWitches; so have others in other places, only because they have done\r\nextraordinary things by their Prayers: It is by many Authors related,\r\nthat a City in _France_ was molested with a Diabolical _Spectre_, which\r\nthe People were wont to call _Hugon_; near that place a number of\r\nProtestants were wont to meet to serve God, whence the Professors of the\r\ntrue reformed Religion were nic-named _Hugonots_, by the Papists, who\r\ndesigned to render them before the World, as the Servants and\r\nWorshippers of that _Daemon_, that went under the name of _Hugon_. And\r\nhow often have I read in Books written by Jesuits, that _Luther_ was a\r\nWizard, and that he did himself confess that he had familiarity with\r\nSatan! Most impudent Untruths! nor are these things to be wondered at,\r\nsince the Holy Son of God himself was reputed a _Magician_, and one that\r\nhad Familiarity with the greatest of Devils. The Blaspheming Pharisees\r\nsaid, _he casts out the Devils thro' the Prince of Devils_, _Matth. 9.34._\r\nThere is then not the best Saint on Earth (Man or Woman) that can assure\r\nthemselves that the Devil shall not cast such an Imputation upon them.\r\n_It is enough for the Disciple that he be as his Master, and the Servant\r\nas his Lord: If they have called the Master of the House Beelzebub, how\r\nmuch more them of his Household_, _Matth. 10.25._ It is not for men to\r\ndetermine how far the Holy God may permit the wicked one to proceed in\r\nhis Accusations. The sacred story of _Job_ giveth us to understand, that\r\nthe Lord whose ways are past finding out, does for wise and holy Ends\r\nsuffer Satan by immediate Operation, (and consequently by Witchcraft)\r\ngreatly to afflict innocent Persons, as in their Bodies and Estates, so\r\nin their Reputations. I shall mention but one Scripture more to confirm\r\nthe Truth in hand: It is that in _Eccles. 9.2, 3._ where it is said,\r\n_All things come alike to all, there is one event to the Righteous and\r\nto the Wicked, as is the Good, so is the Sinner, this is an evil amongst\r\nall things under the Sun, that there is one Event happeneth to all._ And\r\nin _Eccles. 7.15._ 'tis said, _There is a just man that perisheth in his\r\nRighteousness._\r\n\r\nFrom hence we infer, that there is no outward Affliction whatsoever but\r\nmay befal a good Man; now to be represented by Satan as a Tormentor of\r\nBewitched or Possessed Persons, is a sore Affliction to a good man. To\r\nbe tormented by Satan is a sore Affliction, yet nothing but what befel\r\n_Job_, and a Daughter of _Abraham_, whom we read of in the Gospel: To be\r\nrepresented by Satan as tormenting others, is an Affliction like the\r\nformer; the Lord may bring such extraordinary Temptations on his own\r\nChildren, to afflict and humble them, for some Sin they have been guilty\r\nof before him. A most wicked Person in St. _Ives_, got a Knife, and went\r\nwith it to a Ministers House, designing to stab him, but was\r\ndisappointed; afterwards Conscience being awakened, the Devil appears to\r\nthis Person in the Shape of that Minister, with a Knife in his hand\r\nexhorting to Self-murder: Was not here a Punishment suitable to the Sin\r\nwhich that Person had been guilty of? Perhaps some of those whom Satan\r\nhas represented as committing Witchcrafts, have been tampering with some\r\nfoolish and wicked Sorceries, tho' not to that degree, which is Criminal\r\nand Capital by the Laws both of God and Men; for this Satan may be\r\npermitted so to scourge them; or it may be, they have misrepresented and\r\nabused others, for which cause the Holy God may justly give Satan leave\r\nfalsely to represent them.\r\n\r\nHave we not known some that have bitterly censured all that have been\r\ncomplained of by bewitched Persons, saying it was impossible they should\r\nnot be guilty; soon upon which themselves or some near Relations of\r\ntheirs, have been to the lasting Infamy of their Families, accused after\r\nthe same manner, and Personated by the Devil! Such tremendous Rebukes on\r\na few, should make all men to be careful how they joyn with Satan in\r\nCondemning the Innocent.\r\n\r\n\r\nArg. 2. _Because it is possible for the Devil in the Shape of an\r\ninnocent Person to do other mischiefs._ As for those who acknowledge\r\nthat Satan may personate a pious Person, but not to do mischief, their\r\nOpinion has been confuted by more than a few unhappy Instances. Mr.\r\n_Clark_[17] speaks of a Man that had been an Atheist, or a Sadduce, not\r\nbelieving that there are any Devils or any (to us) invisible World; this\r\nMan was converted, but as a Punishment of his Infidelity, evil Angels\r\ndid often appear to him in the Shape of his most intimate Friends, and\r\nwould sometimes seduce him into great Inconveniences. It has been\r\nelsewhere, and but now noted, that a _Daemon_ in the shape of excellent\r\nMr. _Dury_ appeared to the _Turkish Chaos_, _Anno. 1658._ to disswade\r\nhim from prosecuting his desires of Baptism into the Name of Christ:\r\nAlso to Mr. _Earle_ in the likeness of his Friends, to discourage him\r\nfrom doing things lawful and good. A multitude of _Jews_ were once\r\ndeluded by a Person pretending to be _Moses_ from Heaven, and that if\r\nthey would follow him they should pass safe through the Sea (as did\r\ntheir Fathers of old through the Red Sea) whereby great numbers of them\r\nwere deceived and perished in the Waters. [18]Learned and judicious Men\r\nhave concluded that this _Moses Creensis_ was a _Daemon_, transforming\r\nhimself into _Moses_: And that the Devil has frequently appeared[19] in\r\nthe shape of famous Persons to the end that he might seduce Men into\r\nIdolatry, (a Sin equal to that of Witchcraft) no Man that has made it\r\nhis Concern to enquire into things of this nature can be ignorant. Many\r\nExamples of this kind are collected by Mr. _Bromhall_ in his _Treatise\r\nof Spectres, and the cunning Devil, to strengthen Men in their\r\nworshipping of Saints departed:_ And by Mr. _Bovet_ in his\r\n_Pandemonium_. It is credibly reported that the Devil in the likeness of\r\na faithful Minister (as St. _Ives_ before mentioned, near _Boston_ in\r\n_Lincolnshire_) came to one that was in trouble of Mind, telling her the\r\nlonger she lived, the worse it would be for her; and therefore advising\r\nher to Self-murder: An eminent Person still living had the account of\r\nthis Matter from Mr. _Cotton_ (the famous Teacher of both _Bostons_.) He\r\nwas well acquainted with that Minister, who related to him the whole\r\nStory, with all the Circumstances of it: For Mr. _Cotten_ was so\r\naffected with the Report, as to take a Journey on purpose to the Town\r\nwhere this happened, that so he might obtain a satisfactory account\r\nabout it, which he did. Some Authors say, that a _Daemon_ appeared in the\r\nform of _Sylvanus_ (_Hierom's_ Friend) attempting a dishonest thing, the\r\nDevil thereby designing to blast the Reputation of a famous Bishop. I\r\nhave in another Book mentioned that celebrated Instance concerning an\r\nhonest Citizen in _Zurick_ (the Metropolis of _Helvetia_) in whose shape\r\nthe Devil appeared, committing an abominable Fact (not fit to be named)\r\nvery early in the Morning, seen by the Prefect of the City, and his\r\nServant; they were amazed to behold a Man of good Esteem for his\r\nConversation, perpetrating a thing so vile and abominable; but going\r\nfrom the _Spectre_ in the Field, to the Citizen's House in the Town,\r\nthey found him at home, and in his Bed, nor had he been abroad that\r\nMorning, which convinced them, that what they saw was an Illusion of the\r\nDevil: This Passage is mentioned as a thing known and certain by\r\n_Lavater_ in his Treatise of _Spectres_,[20] who was a most learned and\r\njudicious Preacher in that City. Our _Juel_ saith of him, that he must\r\ningeniously confess, that he never understood _Solomon's Proverbs_ until\r\n_Lavater_ expounded them to him: That Book of his _De Spectris_ hath\r\nbeen published in _Latin_, High and Low _Dutch_, _French_, _Italian_.\r\nThe learned _Zanchy_[21] speaks highly of it, professing that he had\r\nread it both with Pleasure and Profit. _Voetius_[22] takes notice of\r\nthat passage which we have quoted out of _Lavater_ as a thing memorable.\r\n\r\nSome Popish Authors argue, That the Devil cannot personate an innocent\r\nMan as doing an act of Witchcraft, because then he might as well\r\nrepresent them as committing Theft, Murder, _&c._ And if so, there would\r\nbe no living in the World: But I turn the Argument against them, he may\r\n(as the mentioned Instances prove) personate honest Men as doing other\r\nEvils; and no solid Reason can be given why he may not as well personate\r\nthem under the Notion of Witches, as under the Notion of Thieves,\r\nMurderers, and Idolaters: As for the Objection, that then there would be\r\nno living in the World, we shall consider it under the next Argument.\r\n\r\n\r\nArg. 3. _If Satan may not represent one that is not a Covenant Servant\r\nof his, as afflicting those that are bewitched or possessed, then it is\r\neither because he wants Will, or Power to do this, or because God will\r\nnever permit him thus to do._ No man but a Sadduce doubts of the ill\r\nwill of Devils; nothing is more pleasing to the Malice of those wicked\r\nSpirits than to see Innocency wronged: And the Power of the Enemy is\r\nsuch, as that having once obtained a Divine Concession to use his Art,\r\nhe can do this and much more than this amounts unto: We know by\r\nScripture-Revelation, that the Sorcerers of _Egypt_ caused many untrue\r\nand delusive [23]Representations before _Pharaoh_ and his Servants.\r\n_Exod. 7.11, 22._ and _8.7._ And we read of the working of Satan in all\r\nPower and Signs, and lying Wonders. _2 Thess. 2.9._ His Heart is beyond\r\nwhat the wisest of Men may pretend unto: He has perfect skill in\r\nOpticks, and can therefore cause that to be visible to one, which is not\r\nso to another, and things also to appear far otherwise then they are: He\r\nhas likewise the Art of Limning in the Perfection of it, and knows what\r\nmay be done by Colours. It is an odd passage[24] which I find in the\r\n_Acta Eruditorum_, printed by _Lipsick_, that about Thirty-two Years\r\nago an indigent Merchant in _France_ was instructed by a _Daemon_, that\r\nwith Water of _Borax_ he might colour Taffities, so as to cause them to\r\nglister and look very gay: He searcheth into the Nature, Causes, and\r\nReasons of things, whereby he is able to produce wonderful effects. So\r\nthat if he does not form the Shape of an innocent Person as afflicting\r\nothers, it is not from want of either will or power. They that affirm,\r\nthat God never did, nor ever will permit him thus to do, alledge that it\r\nis inconsistent with the Righteousness and Providence of God, in\r\ngoverning Humane Affairs thus to suffer Men to be imposed on: It must be\r\nacknowledged[25] that the Divine Providence has taken care, that the\r\ngreatest part of Mankind shall not be left to unavoidable Deception, so\r\nas to be always abused by the mischievous Agents of Hell, in the Objects\r\nof plain Sence: But yet it is not for sinful and silly Mortals to\r\nprescribe Rules to the most High in his Government of the World, or to\r\ndirect him how far he may permit Satan to use his power: I am apt to\r\nthink that there are some amongst us, who if they had lived in _Job's_\r\ndays, and seen the Devil tormenting of him, and heard him complaining of\r\nbeing scared with Dreams, and terrified with Night-visions, they would\r\nhave joined with his uncharitable Friends in censuring him as a most\r\nguilty Person: But we should consider, that the most high God doth\r\nsometimes deal with Men in a way of absolute Sovereignty, performing the\r\nthing which is appointed for them, and many such things are with him: If\r\nhe does destroy the _perfect with the wicked, and laugh at the tryal of\r\nthe innocent_, (_Job 9.22, 23._) Who shall enter into his Councils! who\r\nhas given him a Charge over the Earth! or who has disposed the whole\r\nWorld! Men are not able to give an account of his ordinary Works, much\r\nless of his secret Counsels, and the dark Dispensations of his\r\nProvidence: They do but darken Counsel by Words without Knowledge when\r\nthey undertake it: If we are not able to see how this or that can stand\r\nwith the Righteousness of him that governs the World, shall we say that\r\nthe Almighty will pervert Judgment? or that he that governs the Earth\r\nhateth Right? Shall we condemn him that is most just? But whereas 'tis\r\nobjected; where is Providence? And how shall Men live on the Earth, if\r\nthe Devil may be permitted to use such Power? I demand, where was\r\nProvidence, when Satan had Power to cause Sons of _Belial_ to lye and\r\nswear away the Life of innocent _Naboth_, laying such Crimes to his\r\ncharge as he was never guilty of? And what an Hour of Darkness was it?\r\nHow far was the Power of Hell permitted to prevail, when Christ the Son\r\nof God was accused, condemned, and hanged for a Crime that he never was\r\nguilty of? That was the strangest Providence that has happened since the\r\nWorld began, and yet in the Issue the most glorious: We must therefore\r\ndistinguish between what does ordinarily come to pass by the Providence\r\nof God, and things which are extraordinary: It is not an usual thing for\r\na _Naboth_ to have his Life taken from him by false Accusations, or for\r\nan _Athanasius_ or a _Susanna_ to be charged, and perhaps brought before\r\nCourts of Judicature for Crimes of which they were altogether innocent.\r\n\r\nBut if we therefore conclude, that such a thing as this can never happen\r\nin the World, we shall offend against the Generation of the Just: It is\r\nnot ordinary for Devils to be permitted to reveal the secret Sins of\r\nMen; yet this has been done more than once or twice: Nor is it ordinary\r\nfor _Daemons_ to steal Money out of Mens Pockets, and Purses, or Wine and\r\nCyder out of their Cellars. Yet some such Instances have there been\r\namongst our selves. It is not usual for Providence to permit the Devil\r\nto come from Hell and to throw Fire on the tops of Houses, and to cause\r\na whole Town to be burnt to Ashes thereby; there would (it must be\r\nconfessed) be no living in the World, if evil Angels should be permitted\r\nto do thus when they had a mind to it; nevertheless, Authors worthy of\r\nCredit, tell us, that this has sometimes happened. Both _Erasmus_[26]\r\nand _Cardanus_ write that the Town of _Schiltach_ in _Germany_, was in\r\nthe Month of _April_, 1533. set on fire by a Devil, and burnt to the\r\nground in an Hour's space: 'Tis also reported by _Sigibert_, _Aventinus_\r\nand others, that some Cottages and Barns in a Town called _Bingus_ were\r\nfired by a wicked _Genius_; that spiteful _Daemon_ said it was for the\r\nImpieties of such a Man whom he named, that he was sent to molest them:\r\nThe poor Man to satisfie his Neighbours, who were ready to Stone him,\r\ncarried an hot Iron in his Hand, but receiving no hurt thereby, he was\r\njudged to be innocent. It is not ordinary for a Devil upon the dying\r\nCurse of a Servant, to have a Commission from Heaven to tear and torment\r\na bloody cruel Master; yet such a thing may possibly come to pass. There\r\nis a fearful Story to this purpose, in the account of the _Bucuneers_\r\nof _America_,[27] wherein my Author relates that a Servant, who was\r\n_Spirited_ or _Kidnapt_ (as they call it) into _America_, falling into\r\nthe Hands of a Tyrannical Master, he ran away from him, but being taken\r\nand brought back, the hard-hearted Tyrant lashed him on his naked Back,\r\nuntil his Body ran in an entire stream of Blood; to make the Torment of\r\nthis miserable Creature intolerable, he anointed his Wounds with Juice\r\nof Lemon mingled with Salt and Pepper, being ground small together, with\r\nwhich torture the miserable Wretch gave up the Ghost, with these dying\r\nWords, _I beseech the Almighty God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, that he\r\npermit a wicked Spirit, to make thee feel as many Torments before thy\r\nDeath, as thou hast caused me to feel before mine:_ Scarce four days\r\nwere past after this horrible Fact, when the Almighty Judge gave\r\nPermission to the Father of Wickedness to possess the Body of that cruel\r\nMaster, and to make him lacerate his own Flesh until he died, belike\r\nsurrendring his Ghost into the Hands of the infernal Spirit, who had\r\ntormented his Body: But of this Tragical Story enough.\r\n\r\nTo proceed, Is it not usual for Persons after their Death to appear unto\r\nthe Living: But it does not therefore follow, that the great God will\r\nnot suffer this to be: For both in former and latter Ages, Examples\r\nthereof have not been wanting: No longer since than the last Winter,\r\nthere was much discourse in _London_ concerning a Gentlewoman, unto whom\r\nher dead Son (and another whom she knew not) had appeared: Being then\r\nin _London_, I was willing to satisfie my self, by enquiring into the\r\nTruth of what was reported; and on _Febr. 23. 1691._ my Brother (who is\r\nnow a Pastor to a Congregation in that City) and I discoursed the\r\nGentlewoman spoken of; she told us, that a Son of hers, who had been a\r\nvery civil young Man, but more airy in his Temper than was pleasing to\r\nhis serious Mother, being dead, she was much concerned in her Thoughts\r\nabout his Condition in the other World; but a Fortnight after his Death\r\nhe appeared to her, saying, _Mother you are solicitous about my\r\nSpiritual Welfare; trouble your self no more, for I am happy_, and so\r\nvanished; should there be a continual Intercourse between the Visible\r\nand Invisible World, it would breed Confusion. But from thence to infer,\r\nthat the great Ruler of the Universe will never permit any thing of this\r\nnature to be, is an inconsequent Conclusion; it is not usual for Devils\r\nto be permitted to come and violently carry away persons through the\r\nAir, several miles from their Habitations: Nevertheless, this was done\r\nin _Sweedland_ about twenty Years ago, by means of a cursed Knot of\r\nWitches there. And a learned Physician now living, giveth an account of\r\nseveral Children, who by Diabolical Frauds were stollen from their\r\nParents, and others left in their room: And of two, that in the\r\nnight-time a Line was by invisible Hands put about their Necks, with\r\nwhich they had been strangled, but that some near them happily prevented\r\nit. _V. Germ. Ephem. Anno 1689._ pag. 51. 516.\r\n\r\nLet me further add here; It has very seldom been known, that Satan has\r\nPersonated innocent Men doing an ill thing, but Providence has found\r\nout some way for their Vindication; either they have been able to prove\r\nthat they were in another place when that Fact was done, or the like. So\r\nthat perhaps there never was an Instance of any innocent Person\r\nCondemned in any Court of Judicature on Earth, only through Satans\r\ndeluding and imposing on the Imaginations of Men, when nevertheless, the\r\nWitnesses, Juries, and Judges, were all to be excused from blame.\r\n\r\n\r\nArg. 4. _It is certain both from Scripture and History, that Magicians\r\nby their Inchantments and Hellish Conjurations, may cause a false\r\nRepresentation of Persons and Things._ An inchanted eye shall see such\r\nthings as others cannot discern; it is a thing too well known to be\r\ndenied, that some by rubbing their eyes with a bewitched Water, have\r\nimmediately thereupon seen that which others could not discern; and\r\nthere are Persons in the World, who have a strange _Spectral sight_. Mr.\r\n_Glanvil_[28] speaks of a Dutchman that could see Ghosts which others\r\ncould perceive nothing of. There are in _Spain_ a sort of men whom they\r\ncall _Zahurs_, these can see into the Bowels of the Earth; they are able\r\nto discover Minerals and hidden Treasures; nevertheless, they have their\r\nextraordinary sight only on _Tuesdays_ and _Fridays_, and not on the\r\nother days of the Week. _Delrio_ saith, that when he was at _Madrid_,\r\n_Anno Dom. 1575._ he saw some of these strange sighted Creatures. Mr.\r\n_George Sinclare_, in his Book Entituled, _Satans Invisible World\r\ndiscovered_,[29] has these Words, 'I am undoubtedly informed, that men\r\nand women in the High-lands can discern Fatality approaching others, by\r\nseeing them in the Waters or with Winding Sheets about them. And that\r\nothers can lecture in a Sheeps shoulder-bone a Death within the Parish\r\nseven or eight Days before it come. It is not improbable but that such\r\nPreternatural Knowledge comes first by a Compact with the Devil, and is\r\nderived downward by Succession to their Posterity: Many such I suppose\r\nare Innocent, and have this sight against their Will and Inclination.'\r\nThus Mr. _Sinclare_, I concur with his supposal, that such Knowledge is\r\noriginally from Satan, and perhaps the Effect of some old Inchantment.\r\nThere are some at this day in the World, that if they come into a House\r\nwhere one of the Family will die within a Fortnight, the smell of a dead\r\nCorpse offends them to such a degree, as that they cannot stay in that\r\nHouse. It is reported that near unto the Abby of St. _Maurice_ in\r\n_Burgundy_[30] there is a Fishpond in which are Fishes put according to\r\nthe number of the Monks of that place; if any one of them happened to be\r\nsick, there is a Fish seen to Float and Swim above Water half dead, and\r\nif the Monk shall die, the Fish a few days before dieth. In some parts\r\nin _Wales_ Death-lights or Corps Candles (as they call them) are seen in\r\nthe night time going from the House where some body will shortly die,\r\nand passing in to the Church-yard. Of this, my Honoured and never to be\r\nforgotten Friend Mr. _Richard Baxter_,[31] has given an Account in his\r\nBook about Witchcrafts lately Published: what to make of such things,\r\nexcept they be the effects of some old Inchantment, I know not; nor what\r\nNatural Reason to assign for that which I find amongst the Observations\r\nof the _Imperial Academy_ for the Year 1687, _viz._ That in an Orchard\r\nwhere are choice _Damascen_ Plumbs, the Master of the Family being sick\r\nof a _Quartan Ague_, whilst he continued very ill, four of his\r\nPlumb-trees instead of Damascens brought forth a vile sort of yellow\r\nPlumbs: but recovering Health, the next Year the Tree did (as formerly)\r\nbear Damascens again; but when after that he fell into a fatal Dropsie,\r\non those Trees were seen not Damascens, but another sort of Fruit. The\r\nsame Author[32] gives Instances of which he had the certain knowledge,\r\nconcerning Apple-trees and Pear-trees, that the Fruit of them would on a\r\nsudden wither as if they had been baked in an Oven, when the owners of\r\nthem were mortally sick. It is no less strange that in the Illustrious\r\nElectoral[33] House of _Brandenburg_ before the Death of some one of the\r\nFamily Feminine Spectres appeared: [34]and often in the Houses of Great\r\nmen, Voices and Visions from the Invisible World have been the\r\nHarbingers of Death. When any Heir in the Worshipful Family of the\r\n_Breertons_ in _Cheshire_ is near his Death, there are seen in a Pool\r\nadjoyning, Bodies of Trees swimming for certain days together, on which\r\nLearned _Cambden_[35] has this note, _These and such like things are\r\ndone either by the Holy Tutelar Angels of Men, or else by the Devils,\r\nwho by Gods Permission mightily shew their Power in this Inferiour\r\nWorld._ As for Mr. _Sinclare's_ Notion that some Persons may have a\r\n_second Sight_, (as 'tis termed) and yet be themselves Innocent, I am\r\nsatisfied that he judgeth right; for this is common amongst the\r\n_Laplanders_, who are horribly addicted to Magical Incantations: They\r\nbequeath their _Daemons_ to their Children as a Legacy, by whom they are\r\noften assisted (like Bewitched Persons as they are) to see and do things\r\nbeyond the Power of Nature. An Historian who deserves Credit,\r\nrelates,[36] that a certain _Laplander_ gave him a true and particular\r\nAccount of what had happened to him in his Journey to _Lapland_; and\r\nfurther complained to him with Tears, that things at great distance were\r\nrepresented to him, and how much he desired to be Delivered from that\r\nDiabolical Sight, but could not; this doubtless was caused by some\r\nInchantment. But to proceed to what I intend; the Eyes of Persons by\r\nreason of Inchanting Charms, may not only see what others do not, but be\r\nunder such power of Fascination, as that things which are not, shall\r\nappear to them as real: The Apostle speaks of _Bewitched Eyes_, _Gal.\r\n3.1._ and we know from Scripture, that the Imaginations of men have by\r\nInchantments been imposed upon; and Histories abound with very strange\r\nInstances of this Nature: The old Witch _Circe_ by an Inchanted Cup\r\ncaused _Ulysses_ his Companions to imagine themselves to be turned into\r\nSwine; and how many Witches have been themselves so bewitched by the\r\nDevil, as really to believe that they were transformed into Wolves, or\r\nDogs, or Cats. It is reported of _Simon Magus_,[37] that by his\r\nSorceries he would so impose on the Imaginations of People, as that they\r\nthought he had really changed himself into another sort of Creature.\r\n_Opollonius_ of _Tyana_ could out do _Simon_ with his Magick: The great\r\n_Bohemian_ Conjurer _Zyto_[38] by his Inchantments, caused certain\r\nPersons whom he had a mind to try his Art upon, to imagine that their\r\nHands were turned into the Feet of an Ox, or into the Hoofs of a Horse,\r\nso that they could not reach to the Dishes before them to take any thing\r\nthence; he sold Wisps of Straw to a Butcher who bought them for Swine;\r\nthat many such prestigious Pranks were played, by the unhappy _Faustus_,\r\nis attested by _Camerarius_, _Wyerus_, _Voetius_, _Lavater_, and\r\n_Lonicer_.\r\n\r\nThere is newly Published a Book (mentioned in the _Acta Eruditorum_)\r\nwherein the Author [39](_Wiechard Valvassor_) relates, that a _Venetian_\r\nJew instructed him (only he would not attend his Instructions) how to\r\nmake a Magical Glass which should represent any Person or thing\r\naccording as he should desire. If a Magician by an Inchanted Glass can\r\ndo this, he may as well by the help of a Daemon cause false _Idaeas_ of\r\nPersons and Things to be impressed on the Imaginations of bewitched\r\nPersons; the Blood and Spirits of a Man, that is bitten with a Mad-Dog,\r\nare so envenomed, as that strange Impressions are thereby made on his\r\nImagination: let him be brought into a Room where there is a\r\nLooking-Glass, and he will (if put upon it) not only say but swear that\r\nhe sees a Dog, tho' in truth there is no Dog it may be within 20 Miles\r\nof him; and is it not then possible for the Dogs of Hell to poyson the\r\nImaginations of miserable Creatures, so as that they shall believe and\r\nswear that such Persons hurt them as never did so? I have heard of an\r\nInchanted Pin, that has caused the Condemnation and Death of many scores\r\nof innocent Persons. There was a notorious _Witchfinder_ in _Scotland_,\r\nthat undertook by a Pin, to make an infallible Discovery of suspected\r\nPersons, whether they were Witches or not, if when the Pin was run an\r\nInch or two into the Body of the accused Party no Blood appeared, nor\r\nany sense of Pain, then he declared them to be Witches; by means hereof\r\nmy Author tells me no less then 300 persons were Condemned for Witches\r\nin that Kingdom. This Bloody Jugler after he had done enough in\r\n_Scotland_, came to the Town of _Berwick_ upon _Tweed_; an honest Man\r\nnow living in _New-England_ assureth me, that he saw the Man thrust a\r\ngreat Brass Pin two Inches into the Body of one, that some would in that\r\nway try whether there was Witchcraft in the Case or no: the accused\r\nParty was not in the least sensible of what was done, and therefore in\r\ndanger of receiving the Punishment justly due for Witchcraft; only it so\r\nhappened, that Collonel _Fenwick_ (that worthy Gentleman, who many years\r\nsince lived in _New-England_) was then the Military Governour in that\r\nTown; he sent for the Mayor and Magistrates advising them to be careful\r\nand cautious in their proceedings; for he told them, it might be an\r\nInchanted Pin, which the Witchfinder made use of: Whereupon the\r\nMagistrates of the place ordered that he should make his Experiment\r\nwith some other Pin as they should appoint: But that he would by no\r\nmeans be induced unto, which was a sufficient Discovery of the Knavery\r\nand Witchery of the Witchfinder. There is a strange Diabolical Energy\r\ngoeth along with _Incantations_. If _Balak_ had not known that he would\r\nnot have sent for _Balaam_, to see whether he could inchant the Children\r\nof _Israel_. The Scripture intimates that Inchantments will keep a\r\nSerpent from biting, _Eccles. 10.11._ A Witch in _Sweedland_ confessed,\r\nthat the Devil gave her a wooden Knife; and that if she did but touch\r\nany living thing with that Knife, it would die immediately: And that\r\nthere is a wonderful Power of the Devil attending things inchanted, we\r\nhave confirmed by a prodigious Instance in Major _Weir_, a _Scotch_ Man:\r\nThat wretched Man was a perfect Prodigy; a Man of great Parts; esteemed\r\na Saint, yet lived in secret Uncleanness with his own Sister for thirty\r\nfour Years together: After his wickedness was discovered, he did not\r\nseem to be troubled at any of his Crimes, excepting that he had caused a\r\npoor Woman to be publickly whipped, because she reported that she had\r\nseen him committing Bestiality; which thing was true, only the Woman\r\ncould not prove it. This horrid Creature, if he had his _Inchanted\r\nStaff_ in his Hand could pray to admiration, and do extraordinary\r\nthings, as is more amply related in the Postscript to Mr. _Sinclares_\r\nhis Book before mentioned: But if he had not his Inchanted Rod to lean\r\nupon, he could not transform himself into an Angel of Light: But by all\r\nthese things we may conclude, that it is not impossible, but that a\r\nguilty Conjurer, that so he may render himself the less suspected, may\r\nby his Magical Art and Inchantment, cause innocent Persons to be\r\nrepresented as afflicting those whom the Devil and himself are the\r\nTormentors of.\r\n\r\n\r\nArg. 5. _The Truth we affirm is so evident, as that many Learned and\r\nJudicious Men have freely subscribed unto it._\r\n\r\nThe memorable Relation of the Devils assuming the shape of an innocent\r\nCitizen in _Zurick_, is in the Judgment of that great Divine _Lud\r\nLavater_, of weighty Consideration: And he declares, that he does\r\ntherefore mention it, that so Judges might be cautelous in their\r\nProceedings in Cases of this nature, inasmuch as the Devil does often in\r\nthat way intangle innocent Persons, and bring them into great Troubles.\r\nHis Words are, [40]_Hanc Historiam ideo recito, ut Judices, in\r\nhujusmodi, Casibus cauti sint: Diabolus enim hac via saepe innocentibus\r\ninsidiatur._ He confirms what he saith by reciting a Passage out of\r\n_Alertus Granzius_, who writes that the Devil was seen in the shape of a\r\nNobleman to come out of the Empress's Chamber: But to clear her\r\nInnocency, she (according to the superstitious _Ordeals_ then in\r\nfashion) walked blindfold over a great many of glowing hot Irons without\r\ntouching any of them. _Voetius_ in his [41]Disputation of _Spectres_\r\nproposeth that Question, whether the Devil may not untruly personate a\r\nGodly Man, and answers in the Affirmative: And withal adds, that it is a\r\nsufficient Argument (_ad hominem_) to answer the Papists with their own\r\nHistories, which give Instances of Satan's appearing in the Figure of\r\nSaints, nay of Christ himself. And in his Discourse concerning the\r\n_Operations of Daemons_[42] he has the like _Problem_, whether the Devil\r\nmay not possibly put on the shape of a true Believer, a real Saint, not\r\nonly of such as are dead, but still living, and answers, _Quidni?_ Why\r\nnot? It is true Popish _Casuists_[43] do generally incline to the\r\nNegative in this Question: Nevertheless, the Instance of _Germanus_, who\r\nsaw a Company of honest People represented by the Devil, as if they had\r\nbeen feasting together, when they were really asleep in their Beds, does\r\na little puzzle them, so as that they are necessitated to take up with\r\nthis Conclusion, [44]_That by an extraordinary Permission of God,\r\ninnocent Persons may be represented by Satan in the Nocturnal\r\nConventicles of Witches:_ And if so, much more as afflicting bewitched\r\nPersons. _Delrio_ giveth an account of an innocent Monk, whose\r\nReputation was indangered by a _Daemon's_ appearing in his shape. He\r\nwrites more like a Divine than Jesuits use to do, when he saith that,\r\n[45]_It is not absolutely to be denied, but that the Devils may exhibite\r\nthe Forms of innocent Persons, if God permit it, who when he does permit\r\nit, usually by some Providence discovers the Fraud of the Devils, that\r\nso the Innocent may be vindicated, or if not, it is to bring them to\r\nrepentance for some Sin, or to try their Patience._ It is rare to see\r\nsuch Words dropping from the Pen of a Jesuit: As for Protestant Writers,\r\nI cannot call to mind one of any Note, that does deny the Possibility\r\nof the Affirmative, in the Question before us. Dr. _Henkelius_ has\r\nlately [46]published a learned and elaborate Discourse concerning the\r\nright Method of curing such as are obsessed with _Cacodaemons_, in which\r\nhe asserts, that _Satan may possibly assume the Form of innocent and\r\npious Persons, that so he might thereby destroy their Reputations, and\r\nexpose them to undue Punishments._ As for our _English_ Divines, there\r\nare not many greater _Casuists_ than Mr. _Perkins_; nor do I know any\r\none that has written on the Case of Witchcraft with more Judgment and\r\nClearness of Understanding: He has these Words,[47] \"If a Man being\r\ndangerously sick and like to die upon suspicion, will take it on his\r\ndeath, that such an one has bewitched him, it is an allegation which may\r\nmove the Judge to examine the Party, but it is of no moment for\r\nConviction.\" The like is asserted by [48]Mr. _Cooper_, Mr. _Bernard_,\r\n(once a famous Minister at _Batcomb_ in _Somerset_) his Book called _A\r\nGuide to Grand Jury-men in Cases of Witchcraft_, is a solid and wise\r\nTreatise. What his Judgment was in the Case now under debate, we may\r\nsee, _pag._ 209, 210. where his Words are these; \"An Apparation of the\r\nParty suspected, whom the Afflicted in their Fits seem to see, is a\r\ngreat suspicion; yet this is but a presumption, tho' a strong one,\r\nbecause these Apparitions are wrought by the Devil, who can represent to\r\nthe Phansie such as the Parties use to fear, in which his representation\r\nhe may well lye as in his other Witness: For if the Devil can represent\r\nto the Witch a seeming _Samuel_, saying, I see Gods ascending out of the\r\nEarth, to beguile _Saul_, may we not think he can represent a common\r\nordinary Person, Man or Woman unregenerate, tho' no Witch to the Phansie\r\nof vain Persons, to deceive them and others that will give Credit to the\r\nDevil.\" Thus Mr. _Bernard_.\r\n\r\nAs for the Judgment of the Elders in _New-England_, so far as I can\r\nlearn, they do generally concur with Mr. _Perkins_, and Mr. _Bernard_.\r\nThis I know, that at a Meeting of Ministers at _Cambridge_, _August 1.\r\n1692._ where were present seven elders besides the President of the\r\n_Colledge_, the Question then discoursed on, was, _Whether the Devil may\r\nnot sometimes have a Permission to represent an innocent Person as\r\ntormenting such as are under Diabolical Molestations?_ The Answer which\r\nthey all concurred in, was in these words, _viz._ _That the Devil may\r\nsometimes have a Permission to represent an innocent Person as\r\ntormenting such as are under Diabolical Molestations; but that such\r\nthings are rare and extraordinary, especially when such Matters come\r\nbefore Civil Judicatures:_ And that some of the most eminent Ministers\r\nin the Land, who were not at that Meeting are of the same Judgment, I am\r\nassured: And I am also sure, that in Cases of this nature the _Priest's\r\nLips should keep Knowledge, and they should seek the Law at his Mouth_,\r\n_Mal. 2.7._\r\n\r\n\r\nArg. 6. _Our own Experience has confirmed the Truth of what we affirm._\r\n\r\nI have in another Book given an account concerning _Elizabeth Knap_ of\r\n_Groton_, who complained that a Woman as eminent for Piety as any in\r\nthat Town, did appear to her, and afflict her: But afterwards she was\r\nsatisfied that that Person never did her any harm, but that the Devil\r\nabused them both. About two Years ago, a bewitched Person in\r\n_Chelmsford_ in her Fits, complained that a worthy good Man, a near\r\nRelation of hers did afflict her: So did she likewise complain of\r\nanother Person in that town of known integrity and Piety.\r\n\r\nI have my self known several of whom I ought to think that they are now\r\nin Heaven, considering that they were of good Conversation, and reputed\r\nPious by those that had the greatest Intimacy with them, of whom\r\nnevertheless, some complained that their Shapes appeared to them, and\r\nthreatned them: Nor is this answered by saying, we do not know but those\r\nPersons might be Witches: We are bound by the Rule of Charity to think\r\notherwise: And they that censure any, meerly because such a sad\r\nAffliction as their being falsly represented by Satan has befallen them,\r\ndo not do as they would be done by. I bless the Lord, it was never the\r\nportion allotted to me, nor to any Relation of mine to be thus abused:\r\nBut no Man knoweth what may happen to him, since _there be just Men unto\r\nwhom it happeneth according to the Work of the Wicked_, _Eccles. 8.14._\r\nBut what needs more to be said, since there is one amongst our selves\r\nwhom no Man that knows him, can think him to be a Wizzard, whom yet some\r\nbewitched Persons complained of, that they are in his Shape tormented:\r\nAnd the Devils have of late accused some eminent Persons.\r\n\r\nIt is an awful thing which the Lord has done to convince some amongst us\r\nof their Error: This then I declare and testifie, that to take away the\r\nLife of any one, meerly because a _Spectre_ or Devil, in a bewitched or\r\npossessed Person does accuse them, will bring the Guilt of innocent\r\nBlood on the Land, where such a thing shall be done: Mercy forbid that\r\nit should, (and I trust that as it has not it never will be so) in\r\n_New-England_. What does such an Evidence amount unto more than this:\r\nEither such an one did afflict such an one, or the Devil in his\r\nlikeness, or his Eyes were bewitched.\r\n\r\nThe things which have been mentioned make way for, and bring us unto the\r\nsecond Case, which is to come under our Consideration, _viz._\r\n\r\n_If one bewitched is struck down at the Look or cast of the Eye of\r\nanother, and after that recovered again by a Touch from the same Person,\r\nIs not this an infallible Proof, that the Person suspected and\r\ncomplained of is in League with the Devil?_\r\n\r\n_Answer;_ It must be owned that by such things as these Witchcrafts and\r\nWitches have been discovered more than once or twice: And that an ill\r\nFame, or other Circumstances attending the suspected Party, this may be\r\na Ground for Examination; but this alone does not afford sufficient\r\nMatter for Conviction: As _Spectres_ or _Devils_ appearing in the Shapes\r\nof Men that have been murdered, declaring that they were murdered by\r\nsuch Persons and in such a place, may give just occasion to the\r\nMagistrate for Enquiry into the Matter: One great Witch-Advocate[49]\r\nconfesseth, that by this means Murders have been brought to light; yet\r\nthat alone, if other Circumstances did not concur, would not by the Law\r\nof God take away the Life of any Man. If my Reader pleaseth, he shall\r\nhear what old Mr. _Bernard_ of _Batcomb_ saith to a Case not unlike to\r\nthis, and the former: His Words are these,[50] 'The naming of the\r\nsuspected in their Fits, and also where they have been, and what they\r\nhave done here or there, as Mr. _Throgmorton's_ Children could do, and\r\nthat often and ever found true; this is a great Presumption: yet is this\r\nbut a Presumption, because this is only the Devils Testimony, who can\r\nlie, and that more often than speak Truth. Christ would not allow his\r\nWitness of him in a point most true; nor St. _Paul_ in the due Praises\r\nof him and _Sylas_; his Witness then may not be received as sufficient\r\nin case of ones Life: He may accuse an Innocent, as I shewed before in\r\nMr. _Edmund's_ giving over his Practice to find Stollen Goods; and Satan\r\nwe read would accuse _Job_ to God himself to be an Hypocrite, and to be\r\nready to be a Blasphemer, and he is called the Accuser of the Brethren.\r\nAlbeit, I cannot deny but this has very often proved true, yet seeing\r\nthe Devil is such an one as you heard, Christian Men should not take his\r\nWitness, to give in Verdict upon Oath, and so swear that the Devil has\r\ntherein spoken the Truth; be it far from good men to confirm any Word of\r\nthe Devil by Oath, if it be not an evident Truth without the Devil's\r\nTestimony, who in speaking the Truth, has a lying Intent, and speaks\r\nsome Truths of things done, which may be found to be so, that he may\r\nwrap with them some pernicious Lye, which cannot be tried to be true,\r\nbut must rest upon his own testimony to ensnare the Blood of the\r\nInnocent.' Thus Mr. _Bernard_ resolved the Case above sixty Years ago;\r\nand truly in my Opinion like a Wise and Orthodox Divine, what he says,\r\nreacheth both this and the former Case. Dr. _Cotta_ (a Learned\r\nPhysician) in his Book, about _The Tryal of Witchcraft, shewing the true\r\nand right Method of the Discovery, with a Confutation of Erroneous ways_\r\n(which Book he dedicates to the Right Honourable Sir _Edward Cook_, Lord\r\nChief Justice of _England_,)[51] He discourses concerning _Exploration\r\nof Witches by the touch of the Witch curing the touched bewitched_, and\r\nsheweth the Fallibility and Vanity of that way of Tryal, tho' he had\r\noften seen Persons bewitched in that way immediately delivered from the\r\npresent Fit or Agony which was upon them: But he taketh it to be a\r\nDiabolical Miracle. He argueth thus,[52] 'No Man can doubt but that the\r\nVertue wherewith this touch was indued, is supernatural: If it be so,\r\nHow can man to whom nothing is simply possible that is not natural be\r\njustly reputed an Agent therein? If he cannot be esteemed in himself any\r\npossible or true Agent, then it remaineth that he can only be interested\r\ntherein as an Accessary in Consent, or as a Servant unto a Superior\r\nPower: If that Superior Power be the Devil, the least reasonable doubt,\r\nwhether the Devil alone, or with the Consent or Contract of the\r\nsuspected Person has produced that wonderful effect; with what Religion\r\nor Reason can any Man incline rather to credit the Devil's mouth in the\r\nBewitched, than to pity the Accused, and believe them against the\r\nsubtility of a deceitful Devil: If the Devil by Divine Permission may\r\ncause supernatural Concomitances and Consequences to attend the natural\r\nActions of Men without their allowance, as is manifest in possessed\r\nPersons, how is it reasonable and just that the Impositions of the Devil\r\nshould be imputed unto any Man: And (saith he) God forbid that the\r\nDevil's Signs and Wonders, nay his Truths should become any legal\r\nAllegations or Evidences in Law. We may therefore conclude it unjust,\r\nthat the forenamed miraculous Effect by the Devil wrought and imputed by\r\nthe Bewitched, should be esteemed an infallible mark against any Man, as\r\ntherefore convinced for that the Devil and the Bewitched have so\r\ndecyphered him!' Thus that Learned Man. But to the Case in hand, I have\r\nseveral things to offer.\r\n\r\n1. _It is possible that the Persons in Question may be possessed with\r\nCacodaemons:_ That bewitched Persons are many times really possessed with\r\nevil Spirits, is most certain. And as Mr. _Perkins_ observes, no Man can\r\nprove but that Witchcraft might be the Cause of many of those\r\nPossessions, which we read of in the Gospel: And that Devils have been\r\nimmitted into the Bodies of miserable Creatures by Magicians and\r\nWitches, Histories and Experience do abundantly testifie. _Hierom_[53]\r\nrelates concerning a certain Virgin, that a young Man, whose Amours she\r\ndespised, prevailed with a Magician to send an evil Spirit into her, by\r\nmeans whereof she was strangely besotted. 'Tis reported[54] of _Simon\r\nMagus_, that after he had used an Hellish Sacrifice, to be revenged of\r\nsome that had called him a great Witch, he caused infernal Spirits to\r\nenter into them. Many confessing Witches have acknowledged, that they\r\nwere the Cause of such and such Persons being possessed of evil Angels,\r\nas [55]_Thyraeus_ and others have observed: Now no Credit ought to be\r\ngiven to what _Daemons_ in such as are by them obsessed shall say. Our\r\nSaviour by his own unerring Example has taught us not to receive the\r\nDevil's Testimony in any thing. The Papists are justly condemned for\r\nbringing Diabolical Testimony to confirm the Principles of their\r\nReligion. _Peter Cotton_ the Jesuite[56] enquired of the Devil in a\r\npossessed Person, what was the clearest Scripture to prove Purgatory. At\r\nthe time when _Luther_ died, all the possessed People in the\r\n_Netherlands_ were quiet: The Devils in them, said the Reason was,\r\nbecause _Luther_[57] had been a great Friend of theirs, and they owed\r\nhim that respect as to go as far as _Germany_ to attend his Funeral.\r\nAnother time when there was a talk of some Ministers of the Reformed\r\nReligion, the Devils in the Obsessed laughed and said, they were not at\r\nall afraid of them, for the _Calvinists_ and they were very good\r\nFriends. The Jesuits insult with these Testimonies as if they were\r\nDivine Oracles: But the Father of Lyes is never to be believed: He will\r\nutter twenty great truths to make way for one lye: He will accuse twenty\r\nWitches, if he can but thereby bring one innocent Person into trouble:\r\nHe mixeth Truths with Lyes, that so those truths giving credit unto\r\nlyes, Men may believe both, and so be deceived: And whereas some say,\r\nthat the Persons in question are only bewitched and not possessed, let\r\nit be considered that possessed Persons are called _Energumens_ from\r\n#ERGOMAI# _Agitor_: They whose Bodies are preternaturally\r\nagitated, so as to be in danger of being thrown into the Fire, or into\r\nthe Water, though they may be bewitched, are undoubtedly possessed with\r\n_Daemons_, _Mark 9.22, 25._ Learned Men[58] give it as a most certain\r\nsign of Possession, when the afflicted Party can see and hear that which\r\nno one else can discern any thing of, and when they can discover\r\n[59]secret things, _Acts 6.16._ past, or future, [60]as a possessed\r\nPerson in _Germany_ foretold the War which broke out in the Year, 1546.\r\nAnd when the Limbs of miserable Creatures, are bent and disjointed so as\r\ncould not possible be without a Luxation of Joints, were it not done by\r\na preternatural Hand, and yet no hurt raised thereby that argueth\r\nPossession. Also, when Persons are by the Devil cast into Fits, in the\r\nwhich they speak of things, that afterwards they have no remembrance\r\nof,[61] or, if they are by cruel Devils tortured, so as to cause\r\nhorrendous Clamours in the distressed Sufferers, that's another sign of\r\nObsession by evil Spirits: If all these things concur in the Persons\r\nconcerning where the Question is, we may conclude them to be\r\n_Daemoniacks_: And if so, no _Juror_ can with a safe Conscience look on\r\nthe Testimony of such, as sufficient to take away the Life of any Man.\r\n\r\n2. _Falling down by the cast of an Eye proceeds not from a natural, but\r\nan arbitrary Cause;_[62] not from any Poyson in the Eye of the Witch,\r\nbut from the Agency of some _Daemon_: The opinion of Fascination by the\r\nEye is an old Fable, and (saith Mr. _Perkins_) as fond as old.\r\n_Pliny_[63] speaks of a People that killed folks by looking on them; and\r\nhe adds, that they had two Apples in each Eye: and _Tully_ writes of\r\nwomen who had two Apples in one Eye that always did mischief with their\r\nmeer looks; so _Ovid_, _Pupula duplex fulminat._ And _Plutarch_[64]\r\nwrites that some persons have such a Poyson in their Eyes, as that their\r\nFriends and Familiars are Fascinated thereby; nay he speaks of one that\r\nBewitched himself sick by looking on his own Face in a Glass: Others\r\nwrite of Fascination by a meer Prolation of Words; and for ought I know,\r\nthere may be as much Witchery in the Tongue as there is in the Eye.\r\n_Sennertus_[65] has discovered the Superstition of these Fancies; Sight\r\ndoes not proceed from an Emission of Rays from the Eye, but by a\r\nreception of the visible Species; and if it be (as Philosophers\r\nconclude) an innocent Action and not an Emission of optick Spirits, so\r\nthat sight as such, does receive something from the Object, and not act\r\nupon it, the Notion of Fascination by the Eye is unphilosophical: It is\r\ntrue, that sore Eyes will affect those that look upon them, _Dum\r\nspectant Oculi Laesos, Leduntur & ipsi_, for which a natural Reason is\r\neasily to be assigned; but if the Witches Eyes are thus infected with a\r\nnatural Contagion, Whence is it, that only Bewitched Persons are hurt\r\nthereby? If the vulgar Error concerning the _Basilisks_ killing with\r\nthe Look of his Poysonful Eye were a Truth, whatever person that\r\nSerpent cast his Eye upon would be poysoned. So if Witches had a\r\nphysical Venom in their Eyes, others as well as Fascinated Persons would\r\nbe sensible thereof; there is as much Truth in this fancy of Physical\r\nVenom in the Eye of a Witch, as there is in what _Pliny_[66] and others\r\nrelate concerning the _Thibians_, _viz._ that they have two Apples in\r\none Eye, and the Effigies of an Horse in the other Eye; and that they\r\nare a people that cannot be drowned.\r\n\r\n3. _As for that which concerns the Bewitched Persons being recovered out\r\nof their Agonies by the Touch of the suspected Party, it is various and\r\nfallible._\r\n\r\nFor sometimes the afflicted Person is made sick, (instead of being made\r\nwhole) by the Touch of the Accused; sometimes the Power of Imagination\r\nis such, as that the Touch of a Person innocent and not accused shall\r\nhave the same effect. It is related in the Account of the Tryals of\r\nWitches at _Bury_ in _Suffolk_ 1664, during the time[67] of the Tryal,\r\nthere were some Experiments made with the Persons afflicted, by bringing\r\nthe accused to touch them, and it was observed that by the least Touch\r\nof one of the supposed Witches, they that were in their Fits, to all\r\nmens Apprehension wholly deprived of all Sense and Understandings, would\r\nsuddenly shriek out and open their Hands.\r\n\r\nMr. Serjeant _Keeling_ did not think that sufficient to Convict the\r\nPrisoners, for admitting that the Children were in truth Bewitched, yet\r\n(saith he) it cannot be applyed to the Prisoners upon the Imagination\r\nonly of the Parties afflicted; for if that might be allowed, no Person\r\nwhatsoever can be in safety, for perhaps they might fancy another Person\r\nwho might altogether be innocent in such matters: To avoid this Scruple\r\nit was privately desired by the Judge, that some Gentlemen there in\r\nCourt would attend one of the distempered Persons in the farther part of\r\nthe Hall, whilst she was in her Fits, and then to send for one of the\r\nWitches to try what would happen, which they did accordingly. One of\r\nthem was conveyed from the Bar, and brought to the Afflicted Maid. They\r\nput an Apron before her Eyes, and then another person (not the Witch)\r\ntouched her, which produced the same effect, as the Touch of the Witch\r\ndid in the Court. Whereupon the Gentlemen returned much unsatisfied.\r\n_Bodin_[68] relates, that a Witch who was Tryed at _Nants_, was\r\ncommanded by the Judges to touch a Bewitched person, a thing often\r\npractised by the Judges of _Germany_ in the _Imperial Chamber_. The\r\nWitch was extreamly unwilling, but being Compelled by the Judges, she\r\ncryed out, _I am undone;_ and as soon as ever she touched the Afflicted\r\nperson, the Witch fell down dead, and the other recovered. That horrid\r\nWitch of _Salisbury_, _Ann Bodenham_[69] who had been Servant to the\r\nNotorious Conjurer Dr. _Lamb_, could not bear the sight of one that was\r\nBewitched by her. As soon as ever she saw the Afflicted Person, she ran\r\nabout shrieking, and crying, and roaring after an hideous manner, that\r\nthe Devil would tear her in pieces, if that person came near her. And\r\nwhilst the Witch was in such Torment, the Bewitched was at ease. By\r\nthese things we see, that the Laws and Customs of the Kingdom of\r\ndarkness, are not always and in all places the same.\r\n\r\nAnd it is good for men to concern themselves with them as little as may\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nI think there is weight in Dr. _Cotta's_[70] Argument, _viz._\r\n\r\n_That the Gift of healing the Sick and Possessed, was a special Grace\r\nand Favour of God, for the Confirmation of the Truth of the Gospel, but\r\nthat such a Gift should be annexed to the Touch of Wicked Witches, as an\r\ninfallible sign of their guilt, is not easie to be believed._ It is a\r\nthing well known, that if a person possessed by an Evil Spirit, is (as\r\noft it so happens) never so outragious whilst a good man is Praying with\r\nand for the Afflicted, let him lay his hand on them, and the Evil Spirit\r\nis quiet. I hope this is no evidence of any Covenant, or voluntary\r\nCommunion between the Good Man that is Praying and the Evil Spirit; no\r\nmore does the Case before us evince any such thing.\r\n\r\n4. _There are that Question the Lawfulness of the Experiment._ For if\r\nthis healing power in the Witch is not a Divine but a Diabolical Gift,\r\nit may be dangerous to meddle too much with it. If the Witch may be\r\nordered to touch afflicted Persons in order to their healing or recovery\r\nout of a sick Fit, why may not the Diseased Person be as well ordered to\r\ntouch the Witch for the same cause? And if to touch him, why not to\r\nscratch him and fetch Blood out of him, which is but an harder kind of\r\ntouch? But as for this Mr. _Perkins_ doubts not to call it a _Practice\r\nof Witchcraft_. It is not safe to meddle with any of the Devils\r\nSacraments or Institutions; _For my own part, I should be loath to say\r\nto a Man, that I knew or thought was a Witch, do you look on such a\r\nPerson, and see if you can Witch them into a Fit, and there is such an\r\nafflicted Person do you take them by the Hand, and see if you can Witch\r\nthem well again. If it is by vertue of some Contract with the Devil that\r\nwitches have Power to do such things, it is hard to conceive how they\r\ncan be bid to do them, without being too much concerned in that Hellish\r\nCovenant._ I take it to be (as elsewhere[71] I have expressed) a solid\r\nPrinciple, which the Learned _Sennertus_ insists on, _viz._ _That they\r\nwho force another to do that which he cannot possibly do, but by vertue\r\nof a Compact with the Devil, have themselves implicitely Communion with\r\nthe Diabolical Covenant._ The Devil is pleased and honoured when any of\r\nhis Institutions are made use of; this way of discovering Witches, is no\r\nbetter than that of putting the Urine of the afflicted Person into a\r\nBottle, that so the Witch may be tormented and discovered: The Vanity\r\nand Superstition of which practice I have formerly shewed, and testified\r\nagainst. _There was a Conjurer his name was +Edward Drake+[72] who\r\ntaught a Man to use that Experiment for the Relief of his afflicted\r\nDaughter, who found benefit thereby;_ But we ought not to practice\r\nWitchcraft to discover Witches, nor may we make use of a _White healing\r\nWitch_ (as they call them) to find out a _Black and Bloody one_. And how\r\ndid men first come to know that Witches would be discovered in such\r\nways as these, which have been mentioned? If Satan himself were the\r\nfirst Discoverer (as there is reason to believe) the experiment must\r\nneeds have deceit in it. See Dr. Willet on _Exod. 7._ _Quest. 9._ And\r\nsuch Experiments better become Pagans or Papists than Professors in\r\n_New-England_; whereas 'tis pleaded, that such things are practised by\r\nthe Judges of the Imperial Chamber, I reply, that those Judges (as\r\n_Bodin_ relates, _Lib. 3. Daemon. Cap. 6._) have required suspected\r\nWitches to pronounce over the afflicted persons, these words, _I bless\r\nthee in the Name of the Father, &c._ upon which they have immediately\r\nrecovered; but is the dark day come upon us, that such Superstitions as\r\nthese shall be practised in _New-England_: The Lord Jesus forbid it. See\r\n_Baldwin's_ Testimony against the Practice of the _Camera Imperialis_,\r\nCas. Consc. L. 3. c. 3. p. 634.\r\n\r\n5. _If the Testimony of a bewitched or possessed Person, is of validity\r\nas to what they see done to themselves, then it is so as to others, whom\r\nthey see afflicted no less than themselves:_ But what they affirm\r\nconcerning others, is not to be taken for Evidence. Whence had they this\r\nSupernatural Sight? It must needs be either from Heaven or from Hell: If\r\nfrom Heaven, (as _Elisha's_ Servant, and _Balaam's_ Ass could discern\r\nAngels) let their Testimony be received: But if they had this Knowledge\r\nfrom Hell, tho' there may possibly be truth in what they affirm, they\r\nare not legal Witnesses: For the Law of God allows of no Revelation from\r\nany other Spirit but himself, _Isa. 8.19._ It is a Sin against God to\r\nmake use of the Devil's help to know that which cannot be otherwise\r\nknown: And I testifie against it, as a great Transgression, which may\r\njustly provoke the Holy One of _Israel_, to let loose Devils on the\r\nwhole Land, _Luke 4.35._ See Mr. _Bernard's_ Guide to Juries in Cases of\r\nWitchcraft, p. 136, 137, 138. And _Brockmand_, _Theol. de Angelis_, p.\r\n227. Altho' the Devil's Accusations may be so far regarded as to cause\r\nan enquiry into the truth of things, _Job 1.11, 12. & 2.5, 6._ yet not\r\nso as to be an Evidence or Ground of Conviction: The Persons, concerning\r\nwhom the Question is, see things through Diabolical Mediums; on which\r\naccount their Evidence is not meer humane Testimony; and if it be in any\r\npart Diabolical, it is not to be owned as Authentick; for the Devil's\r\nTestimony ought not to be received neither in whole nor in part.\r\n\r\n6. I am told by credible Persons, who say it is certainly true, that a\r\nbewitched Person has complained that she was cast into Fits by the Look\r\nof a Dog; and that she was no more able to bear the sight of that Dog,\r\nthan of the Person whom she accused as bewitching her: And that\r\nthereupon the Dog was shot to death: This Dog was no Devil; for then\r\nthey could not have killed him. I suppose no one will say that Dogs are\r\nWitches: It remains then that the casting down with the Look is no\r\ninfallible sign of a Witch.\r\n\r\n7. It has always been said, that it is a difficult thing to find out\r\nWitches: But if the Representation of such a Person as afflicting, or\r\nthe Look or Touch be an infallible proof of the guilt of Witchcraft in\r\nthe Persons complained of, 'tis the easiest thing in the World to\r\ndiscover them; for it is done to our hand, and there needs no enquiry\r\ninto the Matter.\r\n\r\n8. _Let them say this is an infallible Proof, produce any Word out of\r\nthe Law of God which does in the least countenance that Assertion:_ The\r\nWord of God instructs Jurors and Judges to proceed upon clear humane\r\nTestimony, _Deut. 35.30._ But the Word no where giveth us the least\r\nIntimation, that every one is a Witch, at whose look the bewitched\r\nPerson shall fall into Fits; nor yet that any other means should be used\r\nfor the discovery of Witches, than what may be used for the finding out\r\nof Murderers, Adulterers, and other Criminals.\r\n\r\n9. Sometimes Antipathies in Nature have strange and unaccountable\r\nEffects. I have read of a Man that at the sight of his own Son, who was\r\nno Wizzard would fall into Fits. There are that find in their Natures an\r\naverseness to some Persons whom they never saw before, of which they can\r\ngive no better an account than he in _Martial_, concerning _Sabidius_.\r\n\r\n    _Non Amo te Sabidi, nec possum dicere quare._\r\n\r\nThat some Persons at the Sight of Bruit-Creatures, Cats, Spiders, _&c._\r\nnay, at the sight of Cheeses, Milk, Apples, will fall into Fits, is too\r\nwell known to be denied. _Pensingius_ in his Learned Discourse _De\r\nPulvere Sympathetico_, p. 128. saith, there was one in the City of\r\n_Groning_ that could not bear the sight of a Swine's Head: And that he\r\nknew another who was not able to look on the Picture thereof. _Amatus\r\nLusitanus_ speaks of one that at the sight of a Rose would swoon away:\r\nThis proveth that the falling into a Fit at the sight of another is not\r\nalways a sign of Witchcraft. It may proceed from Nature, and the Power\r\nof Imagination.\r\n\r\nTo conclude; Judicious _Casuists_[73] have determined, that to make use\r\nof those _Media_ to come to the Knowledge of any Matter, which have no\r\nsuch power in them by Nature, nor by Divine Institution is an Implicit\r\ngoing to the Devil to make a discovery: Now there is no natural Power in\r\nthe Look or Touch of a Person to bewitch another; nor is this by Divine\r\nInstitution the means whereby Witchcraft is discovered: Therefore it is\r\nan unwarrantable Practice.\r\n\r\nWe proceed now to the third Case proposed to Consideration; If the\r\nthings which have been mentioned are not infallible Proofs of Guilt in\r\nthe accused Party, it is then Queried, _Whether there are any\r\nDiscoveries of this Crime, which Jurors and Judges may with a safe\r\nConscience proceed upon to the Conviction and Condemnation of the\r\nPersons under Suspicion?_\r\n\r\nLet me here premise Two things,\r\n\r\n1. The Evidence in this Crime ought to be as clear as in any other\r\nCrimes of a Capital nature. The Word of God does no where intimate, that\r\na less clear Evidence, or that fewer or other Witnesses may be taken as\r\nsufficient to convict a Man of Sorcery, which would not be enough to\r\nconvict him were he charged with another evil worthy of Death, _Numb.\r\n35.30._ if we may not take the Oath of a distracted Person, or of a\r\npossessed Person in a Case of Murder, Theft, Felony of any sort, then\r\nneither may we do it in the Case of Witchcraft.\r\n\r\n2. Let me premise this also, that there have been ways of trying Witches\r\nlong used in many Nations, especially in the dark times of Paganism and\r\nPopery, which the righteous God never approved of. But which (as\r\njudicious Mr. _Perkins_ expresseth it in plain _English_) were invented\r\nby the Devil, that so innocent Persons might be condemned, and some\r\nnotorious Witches escape: Yea, many Superstitious and Magical\r\nexperiments have been used to try Witches by: Of this sort is that of\r\nscratching the Witch, or seething the Urine of the Bewitched Person, or\r\nmaking a Witch-cake with that Urine: And that tryal of putting their\r\nHands into scalding Water, to see if it will not hurt them: And that of\r\nsticking an Awl under the Seat of the suspected Party, yea, and that way\r\nof discovering Witches by tying their Hands and Feet, and casting them\r\non the Water, to try whether they will sink or swim: I did publickly\r\nbear my Testimony against this Superstition in a Book printed at\r\n_Boston_ eight Years past.\r\n\r\nI hear that of late some in a Neighbour Colony have been playing with\r\nthis Diabolical invention: It is to be lamented, that in such a _Land of\r\nUprightness_ as _New-England_ once was, a Practice which Protestant\r\nWriters generally condemn as sinful, and which the more sober and\r\nlearned Men amongst Papists themselves have not only judged unlawful,\r\nbut (to express it in their own terms) to be no less than a _Mortal\r\nSin_, should ever be heard of. Were it not that the coming of Christ to\r\njudge the Earth draweth near, I should think that such Practices are an\r\nunhappy Omen that the Devil and Pagans will get these dark Territories\r\ninto their Possession again: But that I may not be thought to have no\r\nreason for my calling the impleaded Experiment into Question, I have\r\nthese things further to alledge against it.\r\n\r\n1. It has been rejected long agone, by Christian Nations as a thing\r\nSuperstitious and Diabolical: In _Italy_ and _Spain_ it is wholly\r\ndisused; and [74]in the _Low-Countries_, and in _France_, where the\r\nJudges are Men of Learning. In some parts of _Germany_ old _Paganism_\r\nCustoms are observed more than in other Countries, nevertheless all the\r\n[75]_Academies_ throughout _Germany_ have disapproved of this way of\r\nPurgation.\r\n\r\n2. The Devil is in it, all Superstition is from him; and when Secret\r\nthings, or latent Crimes, are discovered by superstitious Practices,\r\nsome Compact and Communion with the Devil is the Cause of it, as\r\n_Austin_[76] has truly intimated; and so it is here; for if a Witch\r\ncannot be drowned, this must proceed either from some natural Cause,\r\nwhich it doth not, for it is against Nature for Humane Bodies, when\r\nHands and Feet are tied, not to sink under the Water: Besides, they that\r\nplead for this Superstition, say that if Witches happen to be condemned\r\nfor some other Crime and not for Witchcraft, they will not swim like a\r\nCork above Water, which Cause sheweth that the Cause of this Natation is\r\nnot _Physical_: And if not, then either it must proceed from a Divine\r\nMiracle to save a Witch from drowning; or lastly, it must be a\r\ndiabolical Wonder: This superstitious Experiment is commonly known by\r\nthe Name of, _The Vulgar Probation_, because it was never appointed by\r\nany lawful Authority, but from the Suggestion of the Devil taken up by\r\nthe rude Rabble: And some [77]learned Men are of Opinion, that the first\r\n_Explorator_ (_being a white Witch_) did explicitely covenant with the\r\nDevil, that he should discover latent Crimes in this way: And that it is\r\nby Virtue of that first Contract that the Devil goeth to work to keep\r\nhis Servants from sinking, when this Ceremony of his ordaining is used.\r\nMoreover, we know that _Diabolus est Dei Simia_, the Devil seeks to\r\nimitate Divine Miracles. We read in Ecclesiastical Story, that some of\r\nthe Martyrs when they were by Persecutors ordered to be drowned, prov'd\r\nto be immersible: This Miracle would the Devil imitate in causing\r\nWitches, who are his Martyrs, not to sink when they are cast into the\r\nWaters.\r\n\r\n3. This way of Purgation is of the same nature with the old _Ordeals_ of\r\nthe Pagans. If Men were accused with any Crime, to clear their\r\ninnocency, they were to take an hot Iron into their Hands, or to suffer\r\nscalding Water to be poured down their Throats, and if they received no\r\nhurt thereby they were acquitted. This was the Devil's Invention, and\r\nmany times (as the Devil would have it) they that submitted to these\r\nTryals suffered no inconvenience. Nevertheless, it is astonishing to\r\nthink what innocent Blood has been shed in the World by means of this\r\n_Satanical_ device. Witches have often (as [78]_Sprenger_ observes)\r\ndesired that they might stand or fall by this Tryal by hot Iron, and\r\nsometimes come off well: Indeed, this _Ordeal_ was used in other Cases,\r\nand not in Cases of Witchcraft only: And so was the _Vulgar\r\nProbation_ by casting into the Water practiced upon Persons accused[79]\r\nwith other Crimes as well as that of Witchcraft: How it came to be\r\nrestrained to that of Witchcraft I cannot tell; it is as supernatural\r\nfor a Body whose Hands and Feet are tied to swim above the Water, as it\r\nis for their Hands not to feel a red hot Iron. If the one of these\r\n_Ordeals_ is lawful to be used, then so is the other too: But as for the\r\nfiery _Ordeal_ it is rejected and exploded out of the World; for the\r\nsame reason then the tryal by Water should be so.\r\n\r\n4. It is a tempting of God when Men put the Innocency of their\r\nFellow-Creatures upon such tryals; to desire the Almighty to shew a\r\nMiracle to clear the Innocent, or to convict the Guilty is a most\r\npresumptuous tempting of him. Was it not a Miracle when _Peter_ was kept\r\nfrom sinking under the Water by the Omnipotency of Christ? As for Satan,\r\nwe know that his Ambition is to make his Servants believe that his Power\r\nis equal to God's, and that therefore he can preserve whom he pleaseth.\r\nI have read[80] of certain Magicians, who were seen walking on the\r\nWater: If then guilty Persons shall float on the Waters, either it is\r\nthe Devil that causes them to do so, (as no doubt it is) and what have\r\nMen to do to set the Devil on work; or else it is a Divine Miracle, like\r\nthat of _Peter's_ not sinking, or that of the Iron that swam at the Word\r\nof _Elisha_. And shall Men try whether God will work a Miracle to make a\r\ndiscovery? If a Crime cannot be found out but by Miracle, it is not for\r\nany Judge on Earth to usurp that Judgment which is reserved for the\r\nDivine Throne.\r\n\r\n5. This pretended Gift of Immersibility attending Witches, is a most\r\nfallible deceitful thing; for many a Witch has sunk under the Water.\r\n_Godelmannus_[81] giveth an account of six notorious and clearly\r\nconvicted Witches, that when they were brought to their _vulgar\r\nProbation_, sunk down under the Water like other Persons; _Althusius_\r\naffirms the like concerning others; in the _Bohemian_ History[82] it is\r\nrelated, that _Uratslaus_ the King of _Bohemia_, extirpated Witches out\r\nof his Kingdom, some of which he delivered to the Ax, others of them to\r\nthe Fire, and others of them he caused to be drowned: If Witches are\r\nimmersible, how came they to die by drowning in _Bohemia_? Besides, it\r\nhas sometimes been known that Persons who have floated on the Water when\r\nthe Hangman has made the Experiment on them, have sunk down like a\r\nStone, when others have made the tryal.\r\n\r\n6. The Reasons commonly alledged for this Superstition are of no moment:\r\nIt is said they hate the Water; whereas they have many times desired\r\nthat they might be cast on the Water in order to their purgation: It is\r\nalledged, that Water is used in _Baptism_, therefore Witches swim: A\r\nweak Phansie; all the Water in the World is not consecrated Water.\r\nCannot Witches eat Bread or drink Wine, notwithstanding those Elements\r\nare made use of in the Blessed Sacrament: But (say some) the Devils by\r\nsucking of them make them so light that the Water bears them; whereas\r\nsome Witches are twice as heavy as many an innocent Person: Well, but\r\nthen they are possessed with the Devil: Suppose so; Is the Devil afraid\r\nif they should sink, that he should be drowned with them? But why then\r\nwere the _Gadarens_ Hogs drowned when the Devil was in them.\r\n\r\nThese things being premised, I answer the Question affirmatively; _There\r\nare Proofs for the Conviction of Witches which Jurors may with a safe\r\nConscience proceed upon, so as to bring them in guilty._ The Scripture\r\nwhich saith, _Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live_, clearly implies,\r\nthat some in the World may be known and proved to be Witches: For until\r\nthey be so, they may and must be suffered to live. Moreover we find in\r\nScripture, that some have been convicted and executed for Witches: For\r\n_Saul cut off those that had familiar Spirits, and the Wizzards out of\r\nthe Land_, _1 Sam. 28.9._\r\n\r\nIt may be wondered that _Saul_ who did like him that said, _Flectere si\r\nnequeo Superos Acheronta Movebo_, should cause the Wizzards in the Land\r\nto be put to death. The _Jewish Rabbies_ say, the reason was, because\r\nthose Wizzards foretold that _David_ should be King. It is (as Mr.\r\n_Gaul_ observes[83]) the Opinion of some learned Protestants, that\r\n_Saul_ in his Zeal did over do: And that under the Pretext[84] of\r\nWitches he slew the _Gibeonites_, for which that Judgment followed, _2\r\nSam. 21.1._ _Neither_ (saith Mr. _Gaule_) _want we the storied Examples\r\nof God's Judgments upon those that defamed, prosecuted and executed them\r\nfor Witches, that indeed were none._ But we have in the Scripture the\r\nExample of a better Man than _Saul_ to encourage us to make enquiry\r\nafter Wizzards and Witches in order to their Conviction and Execution.\r\nThis did the rarest King that ever lived caused to be done, _viz._\r\n_Josiah_, _2 Kings 23.24._ _The Workers with familiar Spirits and the\r\nWizzards, that were spied in the Land of +Judah+, did +Josiah+ put away,\r\nthat he might perform the Words of the Law._ It seems there were some\r\nthat sought to hide those Workers of Iniquity, but that incomparable\r\nKing spied them out, and rid the Land and the World of them.\r\n\r\n_Q._ But then the Enquiry is, _What is sufficient Proof?_\r\n\r\n_A._ This Case has been with great Judgment answered by several Divines\r\nof our own, particularly by Mr. _Perkins_, and Mr. _Bernard_; also Mr.\r\n_John Gaul_ a worthy Minister at _Staughton_, in the County of\r\n_Huntington_, has published a very Judicious Discourse, called, _Select\r\nCases of Conscience touching Witches and Witchcrafts_, Printed at\r\n_London_ A.D. 1646. wherein he does with great Prudence and Evidence of\r\nScripture light handle this and other Cases: Such Jurors as can obtain\r\nthose Books, I would advise them to read, and seriously as in the fear\r\nof God to consider them, and so far as they keep to the Law and to the\r\nTestimony, and speak according to that Word, receive the Light which is\r\nin them. But the Books being now rare to be had, let me express my\r\nConcurrence with them in these two particulars.\r\n\r\n1. _That a free and voluntary Confession of the Crime made by the Person\r\nsuspected and accused after Examination, is a sufficient Ground of\r\nConviction._\r\n\r\nIndeed, If Persons are Distracted, or under the Power of _Phrenetick\r\nMelancholy_, that alters the Case; but the Jurors that examine them, and\r\ntheir Neighbours that know them, may easily determine that Case; or if\r\nConfession be extorted,[85] the Evidence is not so clear and convictive;\r\nbut if any Persons out of Remorse of Conscience, or from a Touch of God\r\nin their Spirits, confess and shew their Deeds, as the Converted\r\nMagicians in _Ephesus_ did, _Acts 19.18, 19._ nothing can be more clear.\r\nSuppose a Man to be suspected for Murder, or for committing a Rape, or\r\nthe like nefandous Wickedness, if he does freely confess the Accusation,\r\nthat's ground enough to Condemn him. The Scripture approveth of Judging\r\nthe wicked Servant out of his own Mouth, _Luke 19.22._ It is by some\r\nobjected, that Persons in Discontent may falsly accuse themselves. I\r\nsay, if they do so, and it cannot be proved that they are false Accusers\r\nof themselves, they ought to dye for their Wickedness, and their Blood\r\nwill be upon their own Heads; the Jury, the Judges, and the Land is\r\nClear: I have read a very sad and amazing, and yet a true Story to this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThere was in the Year 1649, in a Town called _Lauder_ in _Scotland_, a\r\ncertain woman accused and imprisoned on suspicion of Witchcraft, when\r\nothers in the same Prison with her were Convicted, and their Execution\r\nordered to be on the Monday following, she desired to speak with a\r\nMinister, to whom she declared freely that she was guilty of Witchcraft,\r\nacknowledging also many other Crimes committed by her, desiring that she\r\nmight die with the rest: She said particularly that she had Covenanted\r\nwith the Devil, and was become his Servant about twenty years before,\r\nand that he kissed her and gave her a Name, but that since he had never\r\nowned her. Several Ministers who were jealous that she accused herself\r\nuntruly, charged it on her Conscience, telling her that they doubted she\r\nwas under a Temptation of the Devil to destroy her own Body and Soul,\r\nand adjuring her in the Name of God to declare the Truth:\r\nNotwithstanding all this, she stifly adhered to what she had said, and\r\nwas on Monday morning Condemned, and ordered to be Executed that day.\r\nWhen she came to the place of Execution, she was silent until the\r\nPrayers were ended, then going to the Stake where she was to be Burnt,\r\nshe thus expressed herself, _All you that see me this day! Know ye that\r\nI am to die as a Witch, by my own Confession! and I free all Men,\r\nespecially the Ministers and Magistrates, from the guilt of my Blood, I\r\ntake it wholly on my self, and as I must make answer to the God of\r\nHeaven, I declare I am as free from Witchcraft as any Child, but being\r\naccused by a Malicious Woman, and Imprisoned under the Name of a Witch,\r\nmy Husband and Friends disowned me, and seeing no hope of ever being in\r\nCredit again, through the Temptation of the Devil, I made that\r\nConfession to destroy my own Life, being weary of it, and chusing rather\r\nto Die than to Live._ This her lamentable Speech did astonish all the\r\nSpectators, few of whom could restrain from Tears. The Truth of this\r\nRelation (saith my Author[86]) is certainly attested by a worthy Divine\r\nnow living, who was an Eye and an Ear-Witness of the whole matter; but\r\nthus did that miserable Creature suffer Death, and this was a just\r\nExecution. When the _Amalekite_ confessed that he killed _Saul_, whom he\r\nhad no legal Authority to meddle with, although 'tis probable that he\r\nbelyed himself, _David_ gave order for his Execution, and said to him,\r\n_Thy Blood be upon thy Head, for thy Mouth hath Testified against thee_,\r\n_2 Sam. 1.16._ But as for the Testimony of Confessing Witches against\r\nothers, the case is not so clear as against themselves, they are not\r\nsuch credible Witnesses, as in a Case of Life and Death is to be\r\ndesired: It is beyond dispute, that the Devil makes his Witches to dream\r\nstrange things of themselves and others which are not so. There was (as\r\nAuthors beyond Exception relate) in appearance a sumptuous Feast\r\nprepared, the Wine and Meat set forth in Vessels of Gold; a certain\r\nPerson whom an amorous young Man had fallen in Love with, was\r\nrepresented and supposed to be really there; but _Apollonius\r\nTyanaeus_[87] discovered the Witchery of the Business, and in an instant\r\nall vanished, and nothing but dirty Coals were to be seen: The like to\r\nthis is mentioned in the _Arausican_ Council. There were certain Women\r\nthat imagined they rode upon Beasts in the Night, and that they had\r\n_Diana_ and _Herodius_ in company with them, besides a Troop of other\r\nPersons; the Council giveth this Sentence on it; _Satanas qui se\r\ntransfigurat in Angelum Lucis, transformat se in diversarum personarum\r\nspecies, & mentem quam captivam tenet, in somnis deludit._ Satan\r\ntransforms himself into the likeness of divers Persons, and deludes the\r\nSouls that are his Captives with Dreams and Fancies; see Dr. _Willet_ on\r\n_1 Sam. 28._ _p. 165_. What Credit can be given to those that say they\r\ncan turn Men into Horses? If so, they can as well turn Horses into Men;\r\nbut all the Witches on Earth in Conjunction with all the Devils in\r\nHell, can never make or unmake a rational Soul, and then they cannot\r\ntransform a Bruit into a Man, nor a Man into a Bruit; so that this\r\nTransmutation is fantastical. The Devil may and often does impose on the\r\nImaginations of his Witches and Vassals, that they believe themselves to\r\nbe Converted into Beasts, and reverted into Men again; as\r\n_Nebuchadnezzar_ whilst under the Power of a Daemon really imagined\r\nhimself to be an Ox, and would lye out of Doors and eat Grass: The Devil\r\nhas inflicted on many a Man the Disease called _Lycanthropia_, from\r\nwhence they have made lamentable Complaints of their being Wolves: In a\r\nword, there is no more Reality in what many Witches confess of strange\r\nthings seen or done by them, whilst Satan had them in his full Power,\r\nthan there is in _Lucian's_ ridiculous Fable of his being Bewitched into\r\nan _Asse_, and what strange Feats he then played; so that what such\r\npersons relate concerning Persons and Things at Witch-meetings, ought\r\nnot to be received with too much Credulity.\r\n\r\nI could mention dismal Instances of Innocent Blood which has been shed\r\nby means of the Lies of some Confessing Witches; there is a very sad\r\nStory mentioned in the Preface to the Relation of the Witchcrafts in\r\n_Sweedland_, how that in the Year 1676, at _Stockholm_, a young Woman\r\naccused her own Mother (who had indeed been a very bad Woman, but not\r\nguilty of Witchcraft,) and Swore that she had carried her to the\r\nNocturnal Meetings of Witches, upon which the Mother was burnt to Death.\r\nSoon after the Daughter came crying and howling before the Judges in\r\nopen Court, declaring, that to be revenged on her Mother for an Offence\r\nreceived, she had falsely accused her with a Crime which she was not\r\nguilty of; for which she also was justly Executed. A most wicked Man in\r\n_France_ freely confessed himself to be a Magician, and accused many\r\nothers, whose Lives were thereupon taken from them; and a whole Province\r\nhad like to have been ruined thereby, but the Impostor was discovered:\r\nThe Confessing pretended Wizzard was burnt at _Paris_ in the year 1668.\r\nI shall only take notice further of an awful Example mentioned by A. B.\r\n_Spotswood_ in his History of _Scotland_, p. 449. His words are these,\r\n'This Summer (_viz._ Anno 1597.) there was a great business for the\r\nTryal of Witches, amongst others, one _Margaret Atkin_ being apprehended\r\non suspicion, and threatned with Torture, did confess herself Guilty;\r\nbeing examined touching her Associates in that Trade, she named a few,\r\nand perceiving her Delations find Credit, made offer to detect all of\r\nthat sort, and to purge the Country of them; so she might have her Life\r\ngranted: For the reason of her Knowledge, she said, _That they had a\r\nsecret mark all of that sort in their Eyes, whereby she could surely\r\ntell, how soon she looked upon any, whether they were Witches or not;_\r\nand in this she was so readily believed, that for the space of 3 or 4\r\nMonths she was carried from Town to Town to make Discoveries in that\r\nkind; many were brought in question by her Delations, especially at\r\n_Glasgow_, where _diverse Innocent Women, through the Credulity of the\r\nMinister Mr. +John Cowper+, were condemned and put to Death_; in the end\r\nshe was found to be a meer deceiver, and sent back to _Fife_, where she\r\nwas first apprehended: At her Tryal she affirmed all to be false that\r\nshe had confessed of herself or others, and persisted in this to her\r\nDeath, which made many fore-think their too great forwardness that way,\r\nand moved the King to recall his Commission given out against such\r\nPersons, discharging all Proceedings against them, except in case of a\r\nvoluntary Confession, till a solid Order should be taken by the Estates\r\ntouching the form that should be kept in their Tryal.' Thus that famous\r\nHistorian.\r\n\r\n2. _If two credible Persons shall affirm upon Oath that they have seen\r\nthe party accused speaking such words, or doing things which none but\r\nsuch as have Familiarity with the Devil ever did or can do, that's a\r\nsufficient Ground for Conviction._\r\n\r\nSome are ready to say, that Wizzards are not so unwise as to do such\r\nthings in the sight or hearing of others, but it is certain that they\r\nhave very often been known to do so: How often have they been seen by\r\nothers using Inchantments? Conjuring to raise Storms? And have been\r\nheard calling upon their Familiar Spirits? And have been known to use\r\nSpells and Charms? And to shew in a Glass or in a Shew-stone persons\r\nabsent? And to reveal Secrets which could not be discovered but by the\r\nDevil? And have not men been seen to do things which are above humane\r\nStrength, that no man living could do without Diabolical Assistances?\r\n_Claudia_ was seen by Witnesses enough, to draw a Ship which no humane\r\nStrength could move. _Tuccia_ a Vestal Virgin was seen to carry Water in\r\na Sieve: The Devil never assists men to do supernatural things\r\nundesired. When therefore such like things shall be testified against\r\nthe accused Party not by _Spectres_ which are Devils in the Shape of\r\nPersons either living or dead, but by real men or women who may be\r\ncredited; it is proof enough that such an one has that Conversation and\r\nCorrespondence with the Devil, as that he or she, whoever they be, ought\r\nto be exterminated from amongst men. This notwithstanding I will add; It\r\nwere better that ten suspected Witches should escape, than that one\r\ninnocent Person should be Condemned; that is an old saying, and true,\r\n_Prestat reum nocentem absolvi, quam ex prohibitis Indiciis & illegitima\r\nprobatione condemnari._ It is better that a Guilty Person should be\r\nAbsolved, than that he should without sufficient ground of Conviction be\r\ncondemned. I had rather judge a Witch to be an honest woman, than judge\r\nan honest woman as a Witch. The Word of God directs men not to proceed\r\nto the execution of the most capital offenders, until such time as upon\r\nsearching diligently, the matter is _found to be a Truth, and the thing\r\ncertain_, _Deut. 13.14, 15._\r\n\r\nAn Acquaintance[88] of mine at _London_, in his description of\r\n_New-England_ declares, that as to their Religion, the people there are\r\nlike Mr. _Perkins_; it is no dishonour to us, if that be found true: I\r\nam sorry that any amongst us begin to slight so great a Man, whom the\r\nmost Learned[89] in Foreign Lands, speak of with Admiration, on the\r\naccount of his polite and acute Judgment: It is a grave and good Advice\r\nwhich he giveth in his Discourse of Witchcrafts (Chap. 7. Sect. 2.)\r\nwherewith I conclude; 'I would therefore wish and advise all Jurors who\r\ngive the Verdict upon Life and Death in the Court of Assizes, to take\r\ngood heed, that as they be diligent in zeal of God's glory, and the good\r\nof his Church, in detecting of Witches, by all sufficient and lawful\r\nmeans, so likewise they would be careful what they do, and not to\r\ncondemn any party suspected upon bare Presumptions, without sound and\r\nsufficient Proofs that they be not guilty through their own Rashness of\r\nshedding Innocent Blood.'\r\n\r\n    _Boston, New-England, Octob. 3. 1692._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Design of the preceding _Dissertation_, is not to plead for\r\nWitchcrafts, or to appear as an Advocate for Witches: I have therefore\r\nwritten another Discourse, proving that there are such horrid Creatures\r\nas Witches in the World; and that they are to be extirpated and cut off\r\nfrom amongst the People of God, which I have Thoughts and Inclinations\r\nin due time to publish; and I am abundantly satisfied that there have\r\nbeen, and are still most cursed Witches in the Land. More than one or\r\ntwo of those now in Prison, have freely and credibly acknowledged their\r\nCommunion and Familiarity with the Spirits of Darkness; and have also\r\ndeclared unto me the Time and Occasion, with the particular\r\nCircumstances of their Hellish Obligations and Abominations.\r\n\r\nNor is there designed any Reflection on those worthy Persons who have\r\nbeen concerned in the late Proceedings at _Salem_: They are wise and\r\ngood Men, and have acted with all Fidelity according to their Light, and\r\nhave out of tenderness declined the doing of some things, which in our\r\nown Judgments they were satisfied about: Having therefore so arduous a\r\nCase before them, Pitty and Prayers rather than Censures are their due;\r\non which account I am glad that there is published to the World (by my\r\nSon) a _Breviate of the Tryals_ of some who were lately executed,\r\nwhereby I hope the thinking part of Mankind will be satisfied, that\r\nthere was more than that which is called _Spectre Evidence_ for the\r\nConviction of the Persons condemned. I was not myself present at any of\r\nthe Tryals, excepting one, _viz._ that of _George Burroughs_; had I been\r\none of his Judges, I could not have acquitted him: For several Persons\r\ndid upon Oath testifie, that they saw him do such things as no Man that\r\nhas not a Devil to be his Familiar could perform: And the Judges affirm,\r\nthat they have not convicted any one meerly on the account of what\r\n_Spectres_ have said, or of what has been represented to the Eyes or\r\nImaginations of the sick bewitched Persons. If what is here exposed to\r\npublick view, may be a means to prevent it for the future, I shall not\r\nrepent of my Labour in this Undertaking. I have been prevailed with so\r\nfar as I am able to discern the Truth in these dark Cases, to declare my\r\nSentiments, with the Arguments which are of weight with me, hoping that\r\nwhat is written may be of some use to discover the _Depths of Satan_;\r\nand to prevent innocent ones having their Lives endangered, or their\r\nReputations ruined, by being through the Subtility and Power of the\r\nDevils, in consideration with the Ignorance and Weakness of Men,\r\ninvolved amongst the Guilty. It becomes those of my Profession to be\r\nvery tender in Cases of Blood, and to imitate our Lord and Master, _Who\r\ncame not to destroy the Lives of Men, but to save them_.\r\n\r\nI likewise design in what I have written, to give my testimony against\r\nthese unjustifiable ways of discovering Witchcrafts, which some among us\r\nhave practised. I hear that of late there was a _Witch-cake_ made with\r\nthe Urine of bewitched Creatures, as one Ingredient by several Persons\r\nin a place, which has suffered much by the Attack of Hell upon it: This\r\nI take to be not only wicked Superstition, but great Folly: For tho' the\r\nDevil does sometimes operate with the _Experiments_, yet not always,\r\nespecially if a _Magical Faith_ be wanting. I shall here take occasion\r\nto recite some Passages in a Letter, which I received from that Eminent\r\npious and learned Man, Mr. _Samuel Cradock_; during my abode in\r\n_London_; the Letter bears date _Febr. 26. 1690_. Then take it in his\r\nown Words, which are these; 'We have at this present one in our next\r\nTown, who has a Son who has strange Fits, and such as they impute to\r\nWitchcraft: He come to consult with me about it, but before he came, he\r\nhad used a means which I should never had directed him unto, _viz._ He\r\ntook the Nails of his Son's Hands and Feet, and some of his Hair, and\r\nmixed them in Rye-Paste with his Water, and so set it all by the Fire\r\ntill it was consumed, and his Son (as he says) was well after, and free\r\nfrom his Fits for a whole Month, but then they came again, and _He tried\r\nthat means a second time, and then it would not do;_ He removed his Son\r\ninto _Cambridgeshire_ the next County, and then he was well, but as soon\r\nas he brought him home he was afflicted as before. The Boy says, He saw\r\na thing like a Mole following of him, which once spoke to him, and told\r\nhim he came to do the Office he was to do: I advised his Father to make\r\nuse of the Medicine prescribed by our Saviour, _viz._ Fasting and\r\nPrayer. Here have been others in this Town, that though they were under\r\n_Ill-handling_ as they call it: One Family had their Milk so affected,\r\nthat they could not possibly make any Cheese, but it hov'd and swelled,\r\nand was good for nothing: They are now rid of that trouble, but how they\r\ngot rid of it I do not know': Thus my Letter. By which it is evident\r\nthat Towns in _England_ as well as _New-England_ are molested with\r\n_Daemons_, only I wish that the Superstitions practiced in other places\r\nto get rid of such troublesome Guests had never been known, much less\r\nused amongst us or them.\r\n\r\nSome I hear have taken up a Notion, that the Book newly published by my\r\nSon, is contradictory to this of mine: 'Tis strange that such\r\nImaginations should enter into the Minds of Men: I perused and approved\r\nof that Book before it was printed; and nothing but my Relation to him\r\nhindred me from recommending it to the World: But my self and Son agreed\r\nunto the humble Advice which twelve Ministers concurringly presented\r\nbefore his Excellency and Council, respecting the present Difficulties,\r\nwhich let the World judge, whether there be anything in it dissentany\r\nfrom what is attested by either of us.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Words following:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Return of several Ministers consulted by his Excellency,\r\n    and the Honourable Council, upon the present Witchcrafts\r\n    in _Salem_ Village.\r\n\r\n                                        Boston, _June 15, 1692_.\r\n\r\nI. _The afflicted State of our poor Neighbours, that are now suffering\r\nby Molestations from the Invisible World, we apprehend so deplorable,\r\nthat we think their Condition calls for the utmost help of all Persons\r\nin their several Capacities._ II. _We cannot but with all Thankfulness\r\nacknowledge, the Success which the merciful God has given unto the\r\nsedulous and assiduous Endeavors of our honourable Rulers, to detect the\r\nabominable Witchcrafts which have been committed in the Country; humbly\r\npraying that the discovery of these mysterious and mischievous\r\nWickednesses, may be perfected._ III. _We judge that in the prosecution\r\nof these, and all such Witchcrafts, there is need of a very critical and\r\nexquisite Caution, lest by too much Credulity for things received only\r\nupon the Devil's Authority, there be a Door opened for a long Train of\r\nmiserable Consequences, and Satan get an advantage over us, for we\r\nshould not be ignorant of his Devices._ IV. _As in Complaints upon\r\nWitchcrafts, there may be Matters of Enquiry, which do not amount unto\r\nMatters of Presumption, and there may be Matters of Presumption which\r\nyet may not be reckoned Matters of +Conviction+; so 'tis necessary that\r\nall Proceedings thereabout be managed with an exceeding tenderness\r\ntowards those that may be complained of; especially if they have been\r\nPersons formerly of an unblemished Reputation._ V. _When the first\r\nEnquiry is made into the Circumstances of such as may lie under any just\r\nSuspicion of Witchcrafts, we could wish that there may be admitted as\r\nlittle as is possible, of such Noise, Company, and Openness, as may too\r\nhastily expose them that are examined: and that there may nothing be\r\nused as a Test, for the Trial of the suspected, the Lawfulness whereof\r\nmay be doubted among the People of God; but that the Directions given by\r\nsuch judicious Writers as +Perkins+ and +Bernard+, be consulted in such\r\na Case._ VI. _Presumptions whereupon Persons may be committed, and much\r\nmore Convictions, whereupon Persons may be condemned as guilty of\r\nWitchcrafts, ought certainly to be more considerable, than barely the\r\naccused Person being represented by a Spectre unto the Afflicted;\r\ninasmuch as 'tis an undoubted and a notorious thing, that a Daemon may,\r\nby God's Permission, appear even to ill purposes, in the Shape of an\r\ninnocent, yea, and a vertuous Man: Nor can we esteem Alterations made in\r\nthe Sufferers, by a Look or Touch of the Accused to be an infallible\r\nEvidence of Guilt; but frequently liable to be abused by the Devil's\r\nLegerdemains._ VII. _We know not, whether some remarkable Affronts given\r\nto the Devils, by our disbelieving of those Testimonies, whose whole\r\nforce and strength is from them alone, may not put a Period, unto the\r\nProgress of the dreadful Calamity begun upon us, in the Accusation of so\r\nmany Persons, whereof we hope, some are yet clear from the great\r\nTransgression laid unto their Charge._ VIII. _Nevertheless, We cannot\r\nbut humbly recommend unto the Government, the speedy and vigorous\r\nProsecution of such as have rendered themselves obnoxious, according to\r\nthe Direction given in the Laws of God, and the wholesome Statutes of\r\nthe +English+ Nation, for the Detection of Witchcrafts._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] R.

In the\r\noriginal, IV. and V. were out-of-line headers and I., II. and III. were\r\nin-line.\r\n\r\n--p. 80: Moenia had oe-ligature in original (Dilapsa sunt vestra\r\nMoenia!)\r\n\r\n--p. 97: oe to ae (Caelestial)\r\n\r\n--p. 100: We _Fear_ to _We Fear_\r\n\r\n--p. 138: II. to III. (Incorrect numbering of header corrected)\r\n\r\n--p. 135: Ground-sel to Ground (but struck only the Ground) It appears\r\nthat the \"-sel\" was mistakenly introduced during printing, as the word\r\n\"Counsel\" in the previous sentence was split over two lines and\r\nhyphenated (\"Coun-sel\".) However, this mistake is not unique to this\r\nreprint.\r\n\r\n--p. 170: Berecovered to Be recovered\r\n\r\n--p. 184: on to one (that rocks one to Sleep)\r\n\r\n--p. 193: The Sweet Waters of Stealth? to The Sweet Waters of Stealth;\r\n\r\n--p. 245: viz. to _viz._ (_viz._ That in an Orchard)\r\n\r\n--p. 247: missing period added after Lonicer\r\n\r\n--pp. 267-268: Although listed in the Table of Contents, Point 6\r\n(\"Bewitched Persons have sometimes been struck down with the Look of\r\nDogs\") was not numbered in the original, causing points 7 through 9 to\r\nbe numbered incorrectly. This was corrected.\r\n\r\n--p. 267: Brochmand to Brockmand\r\n\r\n--p. 273: extra \"the\" removed (so was the _Vulgar Probation_)\r\n\r\nTwo other problems were noted but left unchanged:\r\n\r\n--p. 99: The biblical citation _Luc. 13.2, 3._ refers to Luke 13.2, 3.\r\n\r\n--p. 268: Mather cites Deut. 35.30, but Deuteronomy only has 34\r\nChapters. The context suggests he may have meant Numbers 35.30.\r\n\r\n--Footnote [77]: _Delri. & Malderus._ to _Delrio & Malderus._\r\n\r\nAlso note that spelling--other than the corrections noted above--has\r\nbeen left as it appeared in the original copy of this book. This\r\nincludes many archaic spellings that appear only once, such as thir (p.\r\n214), doe's (p. 195), and ha's (p. 173).\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------",
