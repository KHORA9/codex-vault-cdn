The photographs of\r\nthe old oak panelling formerly in the Eton Chapel were obligingly\r\ncontributed by Mrs. Sheridan, in whose entrance hall at Frampton\r\nCourt, Dorset, this panelling now is.\r\n\r\nThe author also wishes to thank a number of old Etonians who have\r\nfurnished him with anecdotes and notes which have proved of much\r\nassistance. Chief among these must be mentioned his cousin, the\r\nRight Hon. Sir Algernon West, one of the few survivors of “Montem,”\r\nMr. Douglas Ainslie, and Mr. Vivian Bulkeley Johnson--some other\r\nobligations are acknowledged in the text. His debt to previous books\r\ndealing with Eton will be evident; and a number of the coloured plates\r\nare reproduced from the scarce work on Public Schools published by\r\nAckermann a little short of a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                      PAGE\r\n\r\n   1.

There is, indeed, a real\r\nsentimental pleasure in the thought that many of England’s greatest men\r\nlaid the foundations of brilliant and successful careers amidst these\r\nvenerable and picturesque surroundings. No other school can claim to\r\nhave sent forth such a cohort of distinguished figures to make their\r\nmark in the world; and of this fine pageant of boyhood not a few,\r\nwithout doubt, owed their success to the spirit of manly independence\r\nand splendid unconscious happiness which the genius of the place seems\r\nto have the gift of bestowing.\r\n\r\nNo other school exercises such an attraction over its old boys as Eton,\r\nwith many of whom the traditions of the place become almost a second\r\nreligion. “I hate Eton,” the writer once heard an individual who had\r\nbeen educated elsewhere frankly say, “for whenever I come across two\r\nor three old Etonians, and the subject is mentioned, they can talk of\r\nnothing else.”\r\n\r\nThe affection felt for the school is the greatest justification for\r\nits existence; an educational institution which can inspire those sent\r\nthere with a profound and lasting pride and belief in its superiority\r\nover all other schools, must of necessity possess some special and\r\nfine qualities not to be found elsewhere. The vast majority of boys\r\nexperience a vague feeling of sentimental regret when the time for\r\nleaving arrives--they have a keen sense of the break with a number of\r\nold and pleasant associations, soon to become things of the past--the\r\nschool yard and the venerable old buildings, so lovingly touched by the\r\nhand of Time, never seem so attractive as then, whilst the incomparable\r\nplaying fields, in their summer loveliness, acquire a peculiar and\r\nunique charm. As a gifted son of Eton, the late Mr. Mowbray Morris,\r\nhas so well said, “shaded by their immemorial brotherhood of elms,\r\nand kissed by the silver winding river, they will stand undimmed\r\nand unforgotten when the memory of many a more famous, many a more\r\nsplendid scene has passed away.”\r\n\r\n[SN: FOUNDATION]\r\n\r\nFor the true Etonian there is no such thing as a final parting from\r\nthese surroundings, the indefinable charm of which remains in his mind\r\nup to the last day of his life. Fitly enough, this love for Eton,\r\nhanded on from generation to generation, and affecting every kind of\r\ndisposition and character, has been most happily expressed by a poet\r\nwho was himself an Etonian--John Moultrie. May his lines continue to be\r\napplicable to the old school for many ages to come!\r\n\r\n    And through thy spacious courts, and o’er thy green\r\n    Irriguous meadows, swarming as of old,\r\n    A youthful generation still is seen,\r\n    Of birth, of mind, of humour manifold:\r\n    The grave, the gay, the timid, and the bold,\r\n    The noble nursling of the palace hall,\r\n    The merchant’s offspring, heir to wealth untold,\r\n    The pale-eyed youth, whom learning’s spells enthrall,\r\n  Within thy cloisters meet, and love thee, one and all.\r\n\r\nThe history of the College has been so ably written by Sir Henry\r\nMaxwell Lyte, that it would here be superfluous to do more than touch\r\nupon a few incidents of special interest.\r\n\r\nHenry VI., unlike the warlike Plantagenets from whom he sprang,\r\nwas essentially of studious disposition, and the foundation of a\r\ncollege--one of his favourite schemes, almost from boyhood--was a\r\nproject which he at once gratified on reaching years of discretion. In\r\n1441, when nineteen, he granted the original charter to “The King’s\r\nCollege of our Lady of Eton besides Wyndsor.”\r\n\r\nThis ancient constitution remained in force till the year 1869, when a\r\nnew governing body was introduced, which drew up new statutes two years\r\nlater. The last Fellow representing the old foundation, as instituted\r\nby Henry VI., was the late Bursar, the Rev. W. A. Carter, who died in\r\n1892.\r\n\r\nOn the completion of the arrangements for the institution of the\r\nCollege, the old parish church, standing in what is now the graveyard\r\nof the chapel, was pulled down, and a new edifice of “the hard stone of\r\nKent--the most substantial and the best abiding,” begun. Roger Keyes,\r\nbefore Warden of All Souls College, Oxford, was appointed master of\r\nthe works, receiving a patent of nobility and a grant of arms for his\r\nservices. At the same time the newly founded College was assigned a\r\ncoat of arms, three white lilies (typical of the Virgin and of the\r\nbright flowers of science) upon a field of sable being combined with\r\nthe fleur-de-lys of France and the leopard passant of England, to form\r\nthe design with which Etonians have been familiar for more than four\r\nhundred and fifty years.\r\n\r\nIn 1442 came the first Provost, William of Waynflete, from Winchester,\r\nbringing with him, no doubt, some scholars who formed the nucleus of\r\nthe new foundation. So much on the lines of the College on the banks of\r\nthe Itchen was Eton founded, though from the first various differences\r\nprevailed--the number of commoners in college (_commensales in\r\ncollegio_), for instance, was doubled, it being stipulated that they\r\nmust belong to families entitled to bear arms.\r\n\r\nThe connection between the two schools was close. An alliance, known as\r\nthe “Amicabilis Concordia,” pledging Eton and Winchester to a mutual\r\ndefence of each other’s rights and privileges, was instituted--a bond\r\nof friendship and amity which has never been broken up to the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\n[SN: ORIGINAL DESIGN]\r\n\r\nThe original design of Henry VI. had contemplated a huge nave for the\r\nchapel, which would have stretched right down what is now known as\r\nKeate’s Lane. This, however, was never completed, William of Waynflete\r\neventually finishing the building with the present ante-chapel, built\r\nof Headington stone, for which, it should be added, Bath stone was\r\nsubstituted some thirty-four years ago.\r\n\r\nThere exists a legend that in the reign of Edward IV. Eton only escaped\r\nsuppression owing to the intercession of Jane Shore. Though the story\r\nseems to rest upon no solid historical foundation, it is curious to\r\nnote that two portraits of this Royal favourite are preserved in the\r\nProvost’s Lodge.\r\n\r\nWhen Henry VII. escorted Philip of Castile “toward the seaside” on his\r\nreturn home in 1505, the two kings passed through Windsor--“all the\r\nchildren of Eaton standing along the barres of the Church yeard.”\r\n\r\nHenry VIII. paid a visit to the school in July 1510, and made a\r\nmonetary donation, as was customary in his day.\r\n\r\nThe College curriculum at that time seems to have been of a somewhat\r\nelementary kind: as late as 1530 no Greek was taught. Great stress was\r\nlaid upon prayers and devotion, as the following description left to us\r\nby William Malim, Headmaster in 1561, shows:--\r\n\r\n  “They come to schole at vj. of the clok in the mornyng. They say\r\n  Deus misereatur, with a colecte; at ix, they say De profundis and go\r\n  to brekefaste. Within a quarter of an howere cum ageyne, and tary\r\n  (till) xj. and then to dyner; at v. to soper, afore an antheme and De\r\n  profundis.\r\n\r\n  Two prepositores in every forme, whiche dothe give in a schrowe the\r\n  absentes namys at any lecture, and shewith when and at what tyme both\r\n  in the fore none for the tyme past and at v.\r\n\r\n  Also ij. prepositores in the body of the chirche, ij. in the gwere\r\n  for spekyng of Laten in the third forme and all other, every one a\r\n  custos, and in every howse a monytor.\r\n\r\n  When they goe home, ij. and ij. in order, a monitor to se that they\r\n  do soe tyll they come at there hostise dore. Also prevy monytores how\r\n  many the master wylle. Prepositores in the field whan they play, for\r\n  fyghtyng, rent clothes, blew eyes, or siche like.\r\n\r\n  Prepositores for yll kept hedys, unwasshid facys, fowle clothes,\r\n  and sich other. Yff there be iiij. or v. in a howse, monytores for\r\n  chydyng and for Laten spekyng.\r\n\r\n  When any dothe come newe, the master dothe inquire fro whens he\r\n  comyth, what frendys he hathe, whether there be any plage. No man\r\n  gothe owte off the schole nother home to his frendes without the\r\n  masteres lycence. Yff there be any dullard, the master gyvith his\r\n  frends warnyng, and puttyth hym away, that he sclander not the\r\n  schole.“\r\n\r\nLatin plays were acted during the long winter evenings. Several of\r\nthese were written by Nicholas Udall (Headmaster, 1534-1541), the\r\nauthor of _Ralph Roister Doister_, the first English comedy.\r\n\r\nFor almost two hundred years, from 1563, when William Malim resigned\r\n(owing, it is said, to his severity having caused some boys to run\r\naway), comparatively obscure men held the office of Headmaster, and\r\nwere overshadowed by Provosts who left their mark upon the school.\r\n\r\nHenry VIII. was one day much astonished when informed by Sir Thomas\r\nWyatt that he had discovered a living of a hundred a year which would\r\nbe more than enough for him. “We have no such thing in England,” said\r\nthe King. “Yes, Sir,” replied Sir Thomas, “the Provostship of Eton,\r\nwhere a man has his diet, his lodging, his horse-meat, his servants’\r\nwages, his riding charges, and £100 per annum.”\r\n\r\n[SN: ETONIAN MARTYRS]\r\n\r\nDuring the troublous days of the Reformation Eton appears to have\r\nundergone little change; but a number of old Etonians and Fellows went\r\nto the stake for Protestantism under Queen Mary.\r\n\r\nThe names of the Etonians who underwent martyrdom for the reformed\r\nfaith were JOHN FULLER, who became a scholar of King’s in 1527, and\r\nwas burnt to death on Jesus Green in Cambridge, April 2, 1556; ROBERT\r\nGLOVER, scholar of King’s in 1533, burnt to death at Coventry on\r\nSeptember 20, 1555; LAWRENCE SAUNDERS, scholar of King’s in 1538, burnt\r\nto death at Coventry on February 8, 1556; JOHN HULLIER, scholar of\r\nKing’s also, in 1588, burnt to death on Jesus Green, Cambridge, on\r\nApril 2, 1556. “Their faith was strong unto death and they sealed their\r\nbelief with their blood.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Dr. Henry Cole, appointed Provost in 1554, behaved\r\nin a disgraceful manner. Having advocated the Reformation, he became\r\nin Queen Mary’s reign a rigid Romanist, and was appointed by her to\r\npreach, before the execution of Cranmer, in St. Mary’s Church at\r\nOxford. He became Dean of St. Paul’s in 1556, and Vicar-General under\r\nCardinal Pole in 1557. Soon after the accession of Elizabeth he was\r\ndeprived of his Deanery, fined 500 marks, and imprisoned. Whether he\r\nwas formally deprived of the Provostship, or withdrew silently, does\r\nnot appear. He died in the Fleet in 1561.\r\n\r\nIn 1563 and 1570 Queen Elizabeth paid visits to the College, and a\r\nmemorial of her beneficence is still to be seen on a panel of the\r\nCollege hall.[1]\r\n\r\nAt that time the school seems to have been divided into seven forms;\r\nof these the first three were under the Lower Master--an arrangement\r\nwhich was only altered in 1868, when First and Second Forms ceased to\r\nexist and a Fourth Form was included as part of what now corresponds\r\nto Lower School. It is a curious coincidence that even in those early\r\ndays Fourth Form during part of the school hours were under the Lower\r\nMaster’s control.\r\n\r\n[SN: “FLOGGING DAY”]\r\n\r\nTheir two meals were dinner at eleven and supper at seven, bedtime\r\nbeing at eight. Friday, it is interesting to learn, was set aside as\r\n“flogging day.”\r\n\r\nAt a comparatively early period in the history of the school the\r\ntendency which within the last forty years abolished the First and\r\nSecond Forms seems to have been in existence, no First Form figuring in\r\nthe school list of 1678, in which its place is taken by the Bibler’s\r\nseat--the Bibler being a boy deputed to read a portion of Scripture in\r\nthe Hall during dinner.\r\n\r\nIn Queen Elizabeth’s day the praepostors or “prepositores,” as they\r\nwere then called, played a great part in the daily round of school\r\nlife. There were then two of them in every form who noted down\r\nabsentees and performed other duties such as the praepostors of the\r\nwriter’s own day (1879-83) were wont to perform.\r\n\r\nUp to quite recent years, it may be added, there was a praepostor to\r\nevery division of the school, the office being taken by each boy in\r\nturn, who marked the boys in at school and chapel, collected work from\r\nboys staying out, and the like. Now, however, the only division which\r\nretains a praepostor is the Headmaster’s.\r\n\r\nEton was also connected with the Virgin Queen by its Provost, Sir Henry\r\nSavile, who had instructed her in Greek. Sir Henry is said to have\r\nbeen stern in his theory and practice of discipline respecting the\r\nscholars. He preferred boys of steady habits and resolute industry to\r\nthe more showy but more flighty students. He looked on the sprightly\r\nwits, as they were termed, with dislike and distrust. According to\r\nhis judgment, irregularity in study was sure to be accompanied by\r\nirregularity in other things. He used to say, “Give me the plodding\r\nstudent. If I would look for wits, I would go to Newgate: there be the\r\nwits.”\r\n\r\nIt would seem that at this time the custom of inscribing the names of\r\nnoblemen at the head of their division--whether they deserved it or\r\nnot--still flourished. Youthful scions of aristocracy enjoyed many\r\nprivileges--young Lord Wriothesley, for instance, who was at Eton in\r\n1615, had a page to wait upon him at meals.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Savile died at Eton on February 19, 1621, and was buried in\r\nthe College Chapel. He was married, but left no family. An amusing\r\nanecdote is told of Lady Savile, who, like the wives of other\r\nhard-reading men, was jealous of her husband’s books. The date of the\r\nanecdote is the time when Savile was preparing his great edition of\r\nChrysostom. “This work,” we are told, “required such long and close\r\napplication that Sir Henry’s lady thought herself neglected, and coming\r\nto him one day into his study, she said, ‘Sir Henry, I would I were a\r\nbook too, and then you would a little more respect me.’ To which one\r\nstanding by replied, ‘You must then be an almanack, madam, that he\r\nmight change you every year,’ which answer, it is added, displeased\r\nher, as it is easy to believe.”\r\n\r\n[SN: SIR HENRY WOTTON]\r\n\r\nThe next man of note who became Provost was Sir Henry Wotton, who\r\nobtained the appointment in place of Lord Bacon, it being feared that\r\nthe debts of the latter might bring discredit upon the College. Wotton\r\nit was who built the still existing Lower School with its quaint\r\npillars.\r\n\r\nIzaak Walton speaks of this in the _Compleat Angler_:--“He (Wotton)\r\nwas a constant of all those youths in that school, in whom he found\r\neither a constant diligence or a genius that prompted them to learning;\r\nfor whose encouragement he was (besides many other things of necessity\r\nand beauty) at the charge of setting up in it two rows of pillars, on\r\nwhich he caused to be choicely drawn the pictures of divers of the\r\nmost famous Greek and Latin historians, poets and orators; persuading\r\nthem not to neglect rhetoric, because ‘Almighty God hath left mankind\r\naffections to be wrought upon.’”\r\n\r\nIzaak Walton and Sir Henry loved to fish together, and the spot where\r\nthe two friends indulged their love of angling is well known. It was\r\nabout a quarter of a mile below the College at a picturesque bend of\r\nthe river which, once an ancient fishery, is still known as Black Potts.\r\n\r\nHere the late Dr. Hornby had a riverside villa where he spent a good\r\ndeal of his time.\r\n\r\nSir Henry was a great observer of boyhood, as certain quaint\r\nobservations of his show:--\r\n\r\n  “When I mark in children much solitude and silence I like it not, nor\r\n  anything born before its time, as this must needs be in that sociable\r\n  and exposed life as they are for the most part. When either alone or\r\n  in company they sit still without doing of anything, I like it worse.\r\n  For surely all disposition to idleness and vacancie, even before they\r\n  grow habits, are dangerous; and there is commonly but little distance\r\n  in time between doing of nothing and doing of ill.”\r\n\r\nHe was besides a philosopher sagely writing:--\r\n\r\n  “The seeing that very place where I sate when a boy, occasioned me\r\n  to remember those very thoughts of my youth, which then possessed\r\n  me; sweet thoughts indeed, that promised my growing years numerous\r\n  pleasures without mixture of cares, and those to be enjoyed when\r\n  time (which I therefore thought slow-paced) had changed my youth\r\n  into manhood. But age and experience have taught me that those were\r\n  but empty hopes. And though my days have been many, and those mixed\r\n  with more pleasures than the sons of men do usually enjoy, yet I have\r\n  always found it true, as my Saviour did foretell, ‘_Sufficient for\r\n  the day is the evil thereof_.’ Nevertheless I saw there a succession\r\n  of boys using the same recreations, and questionless possessed with\r\n  the same thoughts. Thus one generation succeeds another, both in\r\n  their lives, recreations, hopes, fears, and deaths.”\r\n\r\nDuring the Provostship of Wotton the tranquillity of Eton life was\r\ndisturbed by troops being quartered in the town, whilst a number\r\nof French hostages had such a bad effect upon the boys, with whom\r\nthey mingled, and upon the Fellows, whom they introduced to improper\r\ncharacters, that De Foix, the French Ambassador, was entreated to\r\ninterfere.\r\n\r\n[SN: PROVOST ROUSE]\r\n\r\nSir Henry Wotton’s successor as Provost, Stewart by name, took up\r\narms for King Charles I. at Oxford, his example being followed by a\r\nnumber of loyal Etonians. With the triumph of the Commonwealth came a\r\nRoundhead Provost, Francis Rouse by name, who was afterwards Speaker\r\nof the Barebones Parliament and one of Cromwell’s peers. Eton did not\r\nfare badly under the Protector, but the spirit of loyalty to the king\r\nnevertheless seems to have continued dominant, and the “Restoration”\r\nwas welcomed with joy.\r\n\r\nFrancis Lord Rouse had been buried with great pomp in Lupton’s Chapel,\r\nbanners and escutcheons being set up to commemorate his memory, which\r\nis still kept green by the old elms he planted in the playing fields.\r\nAll such insignia, however, were destroyed when the king had come\r\ninto his own, and were torn down and thrown away as tokens of “damned\r\nbaseness and rebellion” by the Royalist Provost and Fellows. In 1767\r\nthe irons which had kept these picturesque memorials in place were\r\nstill to be seen, but all traces of them are now gone; probably they\r\nwere torn out at the “restoration” of 1846. To us of a later and more\r\nimpartial age, the insults heaped upon the memory of Provost Rouse seem\r\nto have been undeserved, and there certainly appears no justification\r\nfor his having been called an “illiterate old Jew.” On the other\r\nhand, the imagination cannot be otherwise than stirred by the name of\r\nProvost Allestree, who had fought for King Charles in the students’\r\ntroop at Oxford and at the risk of his life conducted a correspondence\r\nfor Charles II. His services to the Royalist cause would, nevertheless,\r\nin all probability not have been repaid had not Rochester introduced\r\nhim to the frivolous king. Rochester had made a bet that he would\r\nfind an uglier man than Lauderdale, and having come across Allestree,\r\nwho was exceedingly unattractive in face, introduced him to Charles\r\nin order to win the wager. Charles then recalled the devotion of the\r\nindividual with whom he was confronted, and with justice and good\r\njudgment made him Provost of Eton.\r\n\r\nAllestree, though he resided a good deal at Oxford, did his best to set\r\nEton in order, and, amongst other wise and useful acts, built Upper\r\nSchool. Owing, however, to defective construction, or to a fire, this\r\nhad to be entirely rebuilt by subscription a few years later, when it\r\nassumed the form which it still retains.\r\n\r\nProvost Allestree found the College in debt and difficulty, and the\r\nreputation of the school greatly decayed. He left an unencumbered\r\nand flourishing revenue, and restored the fame of Eton as a place of\r\nlearning to its natural eminence. Besides building Upper School at his\r\nown private expense, he also erected the apartments and cloister under\r\nit, occupying the whole western side of the great quadrangle. It was at\r\nthe instance of this Provost, it should be added, that the King passed\r\na grant under the broad seal that, for the future, five of the seven\r\nFellows should be such as had been educated at Eton School and were\r\nFellows of King’s College.\r\n\r\n[SN: A VISIT FROM PEPYS]\r\n\r\nIn February 1666, in a coach with four horses--“mighty fine”--Pepys and\r\nhis wife paid a visit to Windsor. After seeing the Castle, described\r\nby the famous diarist as “the most romantique castle that is in the\r\nworld,” they went on to Eton. Here Mrs. Pepys--rather ungallantly,\r\nperhaps--was left in the coach, whilst her husband, accompanied by\r\nHeadmaster Montague, explored the College and drank the College beer,\r\nboth of which he set down in his diary as being “very good.”\r\n\r\nBy this time the Oppidans had increased to such an extent that they\r\ngreatly outnumbered the Collegers. In 1614 there seem to have been only\r\nforty “Commensalls,” as the Oppidans were then called, although the\r\nmore familiar term had also long been in use; but after the Civil War\r\nthey ceased to board and lodge with the Collegers (the whole school\r\ndined in the College Hall as late as the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury), and gradually grew in number to such an extent that in the\r\nschool list of 1678, out of 207 boys, no fewer than 129 were Oppidans.\r\n\r\nZachary Cradock, Provost in 1680, it is said, owed his appointment to\r\na sermon on Providence, preached before Charles II., to whom he was\r\nchaplain.\r\n\r\nThe first Headmaster of Eton of whom any satisfactory account has\r\nsurvived, was John Newborough, described as “versed in men as well\r\nas in books, and admired and respected by old and young.” Newborough\r\nnumbered many who afterwards became celebrated amongst his pupils: Sir\r\nRobert Walpole and his brother Lord Walpole of Wolterton--ancestors\r\nof the present writer--Horace St. John, Townshend, and many other\r\nwell-known public men, profited by his tuition. Of Sir Robert,\r\nNewborough was specially fond, being rightly convinced that he would\r\nrise to eminence.\r\n\r\nSir Robert loved Eton, and probably one of the proudest moments of his\r\ncareer was a certain Thursday in Election Week, 1735, when, with a\r\nnumber of other old Etonians, he went with the Duke of Cumberland to\r\nhear the speeches in the College Hall, and heard a number of verses\r\nrecited, the great majority of which were in praise of himself. With\r\nDr. Bland, his old friend, who was then Provost, he appears to have\r\ndominated the whole ceremony. So much so was this the case that a\r\ndissatisfied Fellow wrote:--\r\n\r\n  ’Tis to be wished that these performances may be lost and forgott\r\n  that posterity may not see how abandoned this place was to flattery\r\n  when Dr. B---- was Provost, and when Sir Robert was First Minister.\r\n\r\nThe Eton authorities, no doubt, were very proud of Sir Robert, the\r\nfirst Etonian Prime Minister, and the first of a long series of\r\neminent Etonians who were to shed lustre upon the school.\r\n\r\n[SN: “SMOAKING”]\r\n\r\nSchool life in the seventeenth century was a totally different thing\r\nfrom what it is to-day; all sorts of queer usages and ideas prevailed.\r\nIn 1662, for instance, smoking was actually made compulsory for Eton\r\nboys. This was during the plague, when, according to one Tom Rogers,\r\nall the boys were obliged to “smoak” in the school every morning, and\r\nhe himself was never whipped so much in his life as he was one morning\r\nfor not “smoaking.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Eton in the Seventeenth Century, by Loggan. _Print lent\r\nby the Earl of Rosebery, K.G._]\r\n\r\nAs showing the school life of the period the following bill for\r\n“extras” is interesting.

So popular was this\r\nbrutal sport, that boys summoned home before the last day of the half\r\nwrote beseeching their parents to allow them to remain and see “ye ram”\r\ndie according to custom.\r\n\r\nThis ram-baiting appears to have taken its origin from a usage\r\nconnected with the Manor of Wrotham in Norfolk, given to the College\r\nby the founder. At Wrotham Manor during the harvest-home a ram was let\r\nloose and given to the tenants if they could catch him.\r\n\r\nFor many years later the brutal sport continued to flourish, a ram\r\nhunt in the playing fields being attended by the Duke of Cumberland on\r\nElection Saturday 1730, when he was nine years old. He struck the first\r\nblow, and is said to have returned to Windsor “very well pleased.”\r\n\r\nOur ancestors held curious views as to the education of the young,\r\nand seem to have seen no harm in children being familiarised with the\r\ngrossest forms of cruelty. Nevertheless the ram-hunting, after being\r\nmodified, disappeared before the close of the eighteenth century.\r\nFor some years, however, its recollection was maintained by a ram\r\npasty served at election time in the College hall. We may regard the\r\nindigestion which must almost certainly have followed upon indulgence\r\nin such a dish as a mild form of retribution for the tortures which\r\nsome of those present had formerly inflicted upon the poor rams.\r\n\r\nIn the early seventeenth century Shrove Tuesday was also marked by a\r\nbarbarous usage. On that day no work was done after 8 a.m., and, as\r\nin other parts of England, some live bird was tormented. The usual\r\npractice was for the College cook to get hold of a young crow and\r\nfasten it with a pancake to a door, when the boys would then worry it\r\nto death.\r\n\r\n[SN: THE FIRST DAME]\r\n\r\nNewborough, owing to failing health, resigned his headmastership in\r\n1711 and died the following year. He was succeeded by Dr. Snape, a\r\nself-made man, whose mother and afterwards his sister kept the earliest\r\nrecorded “Dames’” houses at Eton. On his resignation in 1720 the school\r\nhad reached a total of 400 boys, though some alleged that one of these\r\nwas a town boy whose name Snape had added to form a round sum.\r\n\r\nUnder his successor, Dr. Henry Bland, the numbers further increased to\r\n425, one of whom was a boy, always playing upon a cracked flute, who\r\nwas to be known to posterity as Dr. Arne.\r\n\r\nAfter the South Sea Bubble had wrought widespread ruin the school\r\nshrank again to 325. Bland only remained at Eton eight years. Sir\r\nRobert Walpole, who never forgot an Etonian schoolfellow, presented him\r\nwith the Deanery of Durham, besides offering him a bishopric, which was\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\nDr. William George then became Headmaster. He was a very good classical\r\nscholar, and some iambics of his so charmed Pope Benedict XIV. that he\r\ndeclared that had the writer been a Catholic he would have made him a\r\ncardinal; as it was he had a cardinal’s cap placed upon the manuscript.\r\nDr. George’s reign at Eton came to an end in 1743, when he was elected\r\nProvost of King’s.\r\n\r\nAt this period a very curious state of affairs prevailed at Eton\r\nin regard to the appointment of the teaching staff. The Headmaster\r\nwas free to choose his own assistants, whom he paid himself; but he\r\nreceived numerous fees and presents from each boy under him. On the\r\nother hand, the Lower Master--who maintained a sort of preparatory\r\nschool, to which came boys of very tender age--was able to sell his\r\nassistant masterships, like waiterships at a restaurant, as he left the\r\nfees and presents to his assistants.\r\n\r\nThis is shown by a quaint advertisement which appeared in the _London\r\nEvening Post_ of November 9, 1731:--\r\n\r\n  Whereas Mr. Franc. Goode, under-master of Eaton, does hereby signify\r\n  that there will be at Christmas next, or soon after, two vacancies in\r\n  his school--viz., as assistants to him and tutors to the young gents:\r\n  if any two gentlemen of either University (who have commenced the\r\n  degree of B.A. at least) shall think themselves duly qualified, and\r\n  are desirous of such an employment, let them enquire of John Potts,\r\n  Pickleman in Gracious Street, or at Mr. G.’s own house in Eaton\r\n  College, where they may purchase the same at a reasonable rate, and\r\n  on conditions fully to their own satisfaction.--F. GOODE. _N.B._--It\r\n  was erroneously reported that the last place was disposed of under\r\n  40s.\r\n\r\nAn assistant master, Dr. Cooke, succeeded Dr. George as Headmaster, but\r\nmanaged the school so badly that his tenure of office only lasted two\r\nyears, during which time the number of boys decreased, and Eton fell\r\ninto some disrepute. Cooke was a very unpopular man, dowered with a\r\n“gossip’s ear and a tatler’s pen,” and he seems to have possessed most\r\nof the worst faults of a schoolmaster and to have made many mistakes;\r\nthis, however, did not prevent him being given a fellowship when Dr.\r\nSumner, an able and active teacher, was put in his place. The efforts\r\nof the latter, however, were able to restore only a modified degree\r\nof prosperity to the school, which had fallen out of general favour\r\nowing to the misrule of his predecessor. A paragraph in the _Daily\r\nAdvertiser_ of August 11, 1747, shows this:--\r\n\r\n  King George II. visited the College and School of Eton, when on\r\n  short notice Master Slater of Bedford, Master Masham of Reading and\r\n  Master Williams of London spoke each a Latin speech (most probably\r\n  made by their masters) with which His Majesty seemed exceedingly\r\n  well pleased, and obtained for them a week’s holidays. To the young\r\n  orators five guineas each had been more acceptable.\r\n\r\n[SN: DR. BARNARD]\r\n\r\nIn 1754, however, the ancient fame of Eton began to revive owing to\r\nthe appointment of Dr. Barnard--_magnum et memorabile nomen_! He was\r\nmade Headmaster through the Townshend and Walpole interests, which were\r\nactive on his behalf. Under his vigorous rule the school flourished;\r\n522 boys, the highest number known up to that time, being on the list\r\non his promotion to the Provostship in 1756. Barnard had no patience\r\nwith fopperies in boys, and had occasional “difficulties” with the\r\nEton “swells” of his day on the point of dress.\r\n\r\nCharles James Fox gave him a good deal of trouble. His absence at\r\nSpa for a year sent him back to Eton a regular fop, and a very sound\r\nflogging appears to have done him but very little good.\r\n\r\nDr. Barnard also seems rather to have despised any tendency towards\r\nfine ways in his pupils. His old pupil, Christopher Anstey, alludes\r\nto this in his _Bath Guide_, in a portion of which a critical mother,\r\n“Mrs. Danglecub,” who has a son at school,\r\n\r\n  Wonders that parents to Eton should send\r\n  Five hundred great boobies their manners to mend,\r\n  When the master that’s left it (though no one objects\r\n  To his care of the boys in all other respects)\r\n  Was extremely remiss, for a sensible man,\r\n  In never contriving some elegant plan\r\n  For improving their persons, and showing them how\r\n  To hold up their heads, and to make a good bow,\r\n  When they’ve got such a charming long room for a ball,\r\n  Where the scholars might practise, and masters and all;\r\n  But, what is much worse, what no parent would chuse--\r\n  He burnt all their ruffles and cut off their queues;\r\n  So he quitted the school in the utmost disgrace,\r\n  And just such another’s come into his place.\r\n\r\n[SN: A REVOLT]\r\n\r\nThe “just such another” was Dr. Foster, who proved to be the very\r\nopposite of Barnard, and became highly unpopular, in great part owing\r\nto the considerable social disadvantage of his being the son of a\r\nWindsor tradesman. He was tactless and unfitted for his position,\r\nand the school did anything but prosper under his rule; indeed, the\r\nnumbers dropped to 250. Meanwhile, the boys got quite out of hand, and\r\nseveral rebellions occurred, amongst them the famous secession of more\r\nthan half the school--160 boys--to Maidenhead.\r\n\r\nOne of the ringleaders of the outbreak was Lord Harrington, a boy of\r\nmuch natural spirit. He was foremost amongst those who threw their\r\nbooks into the Thames and marched away. Like the rest of the rebels he\r\ntook an oath, or rather swore, he would be d----d if ever he returned\r\nto school again. When, therefore, he came to London to the old Lord\r\nHarrington’s and sent up his name, his father would only speak to him\r\nat the door, insisting on his immediate return to Eton. “Sir,” said\r\nthe son, “consider I shall be d----d if I do!” “And I,” answered the\r\nfather, “will be d----d if you don’t!” “Yes, my Lord,” replied the son,\r\n“but you will be d----d whether I do or no!”\r\n\r\nThe revolt seems to have completely broken the Headmaster’s spirit; the\r\nschool fell in numbers to 230, and in 1775 he made way for Dr. Davies,\r\nwho ruled Eton for twenty years. Unlike his predecessor, Davies was\r\nnot unpopular with the boys, but unfortunately he could not manage\r\nhis assistants, with whom he quarrelled, and then attempted to manage\r\nthe school alone. At that time Eton was largely composed of turbulent\r\nspirits, quick to see what glorious opportunities for riot lay at hand,\r\nand before long the unfortunate Davies was driven out of Upper School,\r\npelted with books, and reduced to such a condition of despair that he\r\nwas obliged to make terms with the other masters, who eventually did\r\nsucceed in establishing something like order. His subsequent period of\r\nrule was more peaceful.\r\n\r\nDuring the middle portion of the eighteenth century a number of still\r\nexisting Eton institutions flourished, though generally accompanied by\r\nquaint usages now obsolete. Referring, for instance, to “Tryals,” in\r\n1766, Thomas James, describing the school curriculum, says:--\r\n\r\n  If Boys gain their Removes with honour, we have a good custom of\r\n  rewarding each with a _Shilling_ (if higher in the school, 2/6d.),\r\n  which is given them by the Dames and placed to the Father’s account.\r\n\r\nThis custom, though in 1879 it had fallen into complete abeyance,\r\nwas still more or less extant twenty years earlier; for Mr. Brinsley\r\nRichards, in his most interesting recollections of his Eton days,\r\nmentions that, having gained promotion in Third Form by handing in\r\nthree consecutive copies of nonsense verses, in which there was no\r\nmistake, the Captain of Lower School claimed an old privilege, and\r\nasked that the Lower School might have a “play at four,” the question\r\nalso arising whether the writer of the verses was not entitled to\r\nreceive 2s. 6d., which he eventually got. As a matter of fact, had the\r\nprecedents been strictly followed, one shilling would have been the\r\nreward.\r\n\r\nIn the late eighteenth century, the holidays consisted of a month at\r\nChristmas, a fortnight at Easter, and the month of August. Then, as\r\nnow, the Eton boys enjoyed more half-holidays than were granted at\r\nother schools. In 1776, however, the usual curriculum was interrupted\r\nby a day of “fasting and penitence” on account of British disasters in\r\nAmerica, the colony beyond the seas, which, grown into a great country,\r\nhas since sent many of her sons to be educated at the old school.\r\n\r\nThe last Headmaster of the eighteenth century was Dr. Heath. During the\r\nearly part of his reign he raised the school to 489, but in the last\r\nyear the numbers had sunk to 357. It was a very lax time, and the boys\r\nwere allowed to do, and did do, many things which could hardly have\r\nbeen to the taste of a fond parent.\r\n\r\n[SN: SCHOOL MAGAZINES]\r\n\r\nIn 1786 seems to have been started the first school magazine--the\r\n_Microcosm_, the successors of which have been the _Miniature_ (1804),\r\nthe _Linger_ (edited by G. B. Maturin and W. G. Cookesley, for\r\ncollegers only, 1818), the _College Magazine_ (John Moultrie, 1818),\r\nthe _Etonian_ (Praed, 1820), the _Salt Bearer_ (1820), the _Eton\r\nMiscellany_ (1827), the _Oppidan_ (1828), the _Eton College Magazine_\r\n(1832), the _Kaleidoscope_ (1833), the _Eton Bureau_ (1842), the _Eton\r\nSchool Magazine_ (1848), the _Porticus Etonensis_ (1859), the _Eton\r\nObserver_ (1860), the _Phœnix_ (1861), and the still flourishing _Eton\r\nCollege Chronicle_ (1863).\r\n\r\nAt various periods since the last date ephemeral publications have\r\nintermittently appeared. These, however, are scarcely of sufficient\r\nimportance to require mention, the majority having enjoyed but a very\r\nbrief existence. The most recent of these journalistic efforts was the\r\n_Eton Illustrated Magazine_, two numbers of which made their appearance\r\nat the beginning of the present year (1911). Though a third was\r\nannounced, the magazine came to a premature end, owing, it was said, to\r\nthe censorship exercised by the authorities. According to an unwritten\r\nlaw, no reference must be made to the Eton Officers’ Training Corps,\r\nand owing to this and the suppression of skits and humorous paragraphs,\r\nit was decided to suspend publication.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the eighteenth century one of the most prominent\r\nEtonians was William Windham, in after-life a powerful politician, and\r\n“the darling of Norfolk.” At school he achieved distinction as a fine\r\nscholar, besides being “the best cricketer, the best leaper, swimmer,\r\nrower, and skater, the best fencer, the best boxer, the best runner,\r\nand the best horseman of his time.”\r\n\r\nThe owner of a splendid estate--Felbrigg Hall--Windham was the\r\nbeau-ideal of an English gentleman, whose merits were recognised alike\r\nby friend and foe.\r\n\r\nHeath was succeeded in the headmastership by Dr. Goodall, under whose\r\nmild and easy-going rule discipline continued to be lax. Owing,\r\nhowever, to the warm affection and patronage of George III., the\r\nschool continued to prosper, its numbers rising under Goodall to 511.\r\nOf fine appearance and courteous bearing, he is said to have looked\r\nevery inch an Eton Headmaster. Devoted to the school where, as a\r\nscholar and assistant master, he had passed most of his life, he was\r\nan ultra-Conservative in everything which appertained to it; under his\r\nrule no changes took place.\r\n\r\n[SN: DR. GOODALL]\r\n\r\nProbably this Headmaster never appeared to better advantage when, after\r\nthe glorious battle of Trafalgar, he publicly called up Horace Nelson,\r\nnephew of the immortal admiral, and in a kind and delicate manner\r\ninformed him of his heroic uncle’s death. Though the tears were visible\r\nin the boy’s eyes, Dr. Goodall’s well-chosen words soothed his grief,\r\nand there lurked on his countenance a smile of delight at the greatest\r\nvictory ever gained by this country in any naval engagement over a\r\ngallant foe.\r\n\r\n“There was a pleasant joyousness in Dr. Goodall,” said one of his\r\npupils, “which beamed and overflowed in his face; and it seemed an odd\r\ncaprice of fortune by which such a jovial spirit was invested with the\r\nsolemn dignity of a schoolmaster.” The blandness and good-nature which\r\nmade him universally popular both as Headmaster and as Provost, were\r\nan element of weakness when he had to cope with the turbulent spirits;\r\nand Eton discipline did not improve under his rule. His rich fund of\r\nanecdote, sprightly wit, and genial spirit made his society very much\r\nsought in days when those pleasant qualifications were highly valued,\r\nand he was a great personal favourite with the king. It was not so much\r\nthe fault of the individual as of the age, if he had a profound respect\r\nfor the peerage, and could see few defects of scholarship in his more\r\naristocratic pupils. Those were the days, it must be remembered,\r\nwhen the young peers, sons of peers, and baronets sat in the stalls\r\nin the College chapel, visibly elevated above their fellows. Then,\r\ntoo, it was not an uncommon thing for an Eton boy, whose friends were\r\nconnected with the Court, to hold a commission in the Guards and draw\r\nthe regular pay. Sometimes, if he obtained an appointment as one of the\r\nroyal pages, he was gazetted while yet a mere child. “I had the honour\r\nthis morning,” Goodall is reported to have said on one occasion, “of\r\nflogging a major in His Majesty’s service.”\r\n\r\nWith the death of this courteous pedagogue in 1840 old Eton may be said\r\nto have passed away; whilst he lived many alterations and reforms were\r\ndelayed, no change whatever being made during his term of office as\r\nProvost.\r\n\r\n[SN: A LAST FAREWELL]\r\n\r\nThough he has been blamed for not having made some improvement in the\r\nlot of the collegers, he appears to have enjoyed great popularity at\r\nEton, and to have been hospitable and benevolent. Glancing through a\r\ncopy of _Alumni Etonenses_, enriched with a number of manuscript notes,\r\nappended by the late Reverend George John Dupuis, Vice-Provost, the\r\nwriter came upon an enthusiastic tribute to the memory of Dr. Goodall,\r\nwho is described as eminent for his talents, his benevolence, and\r\ncharity. A somewhat touching eulogy, after a description of the old\r\nProvost’s funeral in the College chapel, concludes, “Farewell, kind and\r\ngood old man.”\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] See Chapter VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII OLD CUSTOMS AND WAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring George the Third’s reign Eton enjoyed a special share of royal\r\nfavour. Dr. Goodall, if he had been an easy-going Headmaster, was in\r\nmany respects an ideal Provost, who notoriously possessed many of the\r\nqualifications of a courtier; whilst Dr. Langford, Lower Master for\r\nmany years, was such a favourite with the King that the latter used\r\nto send for him to come down to Weymouth and preach. The sunshine of\r\nroyalty in which Etonians basked not unnaturally aroused some jealousy;\r\nand one critic--an old Westminster boy--declared that the vicinity of\r\nWindsor Castle was of no benefit to the discipline and good order of\r\nEton School.\r\n\r\n[SN: GEORGE III. AND THE BOYS]\r\n\r\nA constant patron of boys and masters, George III. hardly ever passed\r\nthe College without stopping to chat with some of them. He was very\r\nfond of stag-hunting, and as one of the favourite places for the deer\r\nto be thrown off was between Slough and Langley Broom, he very often\r\ncame through Eton; the appearance of the green-tilted cart about nine\r\no’clock was certain evidence that the King would pass some time before\r\neleven. It became a custom for the boys to wait for him seated on the\r\nwall in front of the school. He generally arrived, escorted by his\r\nattendants, the master of the hounds, and some of the neighbouring\r\ngentry, old Davis, the huntsman, with the stag-hounds, going on before.\r\nOccasionally the King’s beloved daughter, the Princess Amelia, whose\r\nearly death he so deeply deplored, came too.\r\n\r\nNear the wall, hat in hand, the Eton boys greeted their monarch, who\r\nalmost invariably stopped to ask various questions of those who had\r\nthe good fortune to attract his attention. These were mostly some of\r\nthe young nobility, with whose parents His Majesty was acquainted, and\r\nwhom, if once introduced to him, his peculiarly retentive memory never\r\nallowed him to forget.\r\n\r\nPicking out some boy he would jokingly say:\r\n\r\n“Well, well, when were you flogged last, eh--eh? Your master is very\r\nkind to you all, is he not? Have you had any rebellions lately, eh--eh?\r\nNaughty boys, you know, sometimes. Should you not like to have a\r\nholiday, if I hear a good character of you, eh--eh? Well, well, we will\r\nsee about it, but be good boys. Who is to have the Montem this year?”\r\n\r\nOn being told he would remark:\r\n\r\n“Lucky fellow, lucky fellow.”\r\n\r\nThe royal visit was a general topic of conversation during the day, and\r\nthough one of such frequent occurrence--nay, almost every week during\r\nthe hunting season--still was it always attended with delight, and the\r\nanticipation of something good to follow. It was highly amusing to hear\r\nthe various remarks made by some of the boys who happened not to have\r\nbeen present at the time of the royal cavalcade passing, and who, of\r\ncourse, were anxious to hear what had occurred.\r\n\r\n“Well, what did old George say? Did he say that he would ask for a\r\nholiday for us? By Jove, I hope that he will, for I want to ride\r\nSteven’s new chestnut to Egham.”\r\n\r\n“You be hanged,” a companion would retort; “I want to go to Langley to\r\nsee my aunt, who has promised to give me syllabubs, the first ‘_after\r\nfour_’ that I can go.”\r\n\r\nAnother perhaps wanted to have a drive to Virginia Water, a favourite\r\nexcursion with the boys. Such and the like expectations of holiday\r\nhappiness were as often anticipated, and frequently realised, by the\r\nride of kindly old George III. through the town of Eton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Eton College from Crown Corner._ _From an\r\neighteenth-century print lent by Walter Burns, Esq._]\r\n\r\nIn a regulation costume of knee-breeches and black silk stockings (any\r\nholes in the latter being concealed by ink) the Eton boys going up to\r\nthe Castle would stroll about the terrace, which, like the river, was\r\n“in bounds” though the approaches to it were not. There the King mixed\r\nfreely with them, asking any one he did not know by sight, “What’s\r\nyour name? Who’s your tutor? Who’s your dame?” And on receiving the\r\nanswer he would generally remark: “_Very_ good tutor, _very_ good dame.”\r\n\r\n[SN: MONTEM PARADE]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the picturesque “Montem,” the terrace was the scene\r\nof what was called “Montem parade,” in which the fantastic costumes of\r\nthe boys were conspicuous features. On one occasion George III. kept\r\nall the boys to supper at the Castle, taking care, however, to forget\r\nall about the masters, who were consequently annoyed. The old king more\r\nthan once interfered to prevent Eton boys from being punished, and\r\nactually gave one offender who had been expelled for poaching in the\r\nHome Park a commission in the Guards.\r\n\r\nWilliam the Fourth also took a great interest in Eton, as did Queen\r\nVictoria, who sometimes sent for privileged boys. On one occasion\r\nshe attended speeches, and all the school considered it a compliment\r\nwhen she invited Dr. Hawtrey to tea. In the earlier portion of her\r\nreign, whenever she passed through Eton she was loudly cheered by\r\nthe Etonians, and would check the speed of her carriage out of\r\nconsideration for those who ran beside it.\r\n\r\nThe memory of George III., as every one knows, is still preserved at\r\nEton by the celebration of his birthday--June 4th. What, however, every\r\none does not know is that the present costume of the Eton boys--black\r\njackets and tail coats--is in reality but a sort of perpetual mourning\r\nfor the old king.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the eighteenth century the costume of an Etonian\r\nconsisted of a blue coat, knee breeches, white waistcoat and ruffled\r\nshirt, but a few years later white ducks and pantaloons began to be\r\nworn by Oppidans, though the Collegers were compelled to adhere to the\r\nolder dress for some time longer.\r\n\r\nAfter 1820 the smaller boys wore jackets and black slip-knot\r\nties (handkerchiefs they were called at first), the bigger ones\r\nswallow-tailed dress-coats and spotless white ties. For a considerable\r\nperiod the latter had no collars, but stiff neckcloths about a yard\r\nlong, tied twice round. The first boy who started a single tie and\r\ncollar was one of the master’s sons, and at first the innovation was\r\nregarded with disfavour as much too free-and-easy. The masters kept a\r\nsharp eye upon the boys’ tails, any one attempting something like a\r\n“morning” coat being at once called to account and told by his tutor\r\nnot to “dress himself like a bargeman.” No objection, however, was made\r\nto an indulgence in studs, bunches of charms, and other jewellery; and\r\nmany boys decorated their coats with summer flowers, in the arrangement\r\nof which they showed some taste.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the nineteenth century morning coats took the\r\nplace of the swallow-tails. Since then, with the exception of a\r\ndiminution in the height of the top hat, which in the late fifties of\r\nthe last century was preposterous, the dress of an Etonian has remained\r\npretty well unchanged, though, of course, from time to time there\r\nhave been varying fashions as regards waistcoats. Thirty years ago the\r\nmost popular of these were those made of a sort of corduroy relieved\r\nby coloured silk. At present, I understand, some perturbation has been\r\ncaused amongst the upper boys by a report that the Headmaster proposes\r\nto prohibit every sort of fancy waistcoat; but it is to be hoped that\r\nsuch an interference with Etonian liberty will not be carried into\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n[SN: FADS]\r\n\r\nThe custom of swells wearing stick-up collars, instead of the turn-down\r\nones worn by their undistinguished schoolfellows, is now of some\r\nantiquity and appears likely to last.\r\n\r\nUp to about fifty or sixty years ago Eton boys never wore greatcoats\r\nat all. The famous Headmaster, Dr. Keate, was a warm supporter of this\r\nSpartan habit, which underwent only gradual modification as time went\r\non; for, even after greatcoats were allowed the boys very seldom wore\r\nthem, and never by any chance put them on unless they were sure that\r\nsome of the swells of the school had given them a lead. So strong is\r\nthe force of custom in this matter, that when a few years ago the\r\nHeadmaster issued a circular that every boy, no matter his place in the\r\nschool, was to wear a greatcoat whenever he liked, no notice whatever\r\nwas taken of it, the old state of affairs continuing to exist. Another\r\ncurious usage is that which ordains that no boy except a swell may\r\ncarry his umbrella rolled up, akin to which was the idea, prevalent\r\nthirty years ago, and very likely prevalent to-day, that turning up the\r\nbottom of the trousers must not be attempted by any but those occupying\r\na distinguished position in the school.\r\n\r\nBefore the era of steam, wonderful costumes were worn by Eton boys as\r\nthey started away for the holidays. On Election Monday the whole road\r\nfrom Barnes Pool Bridge to Weston’s Yard would be filled with a crowd\r\nof vehicles, whilst round the corner of the Slough Road, where the new\r\nschools now stand, just beyond Spier’s sock shop, a number of youths,\r\ngorgeously dressed in green coats with brass buttons, white breeches,\r\ntop-boots and spurs, would take horse and ride away to town, much to\r\nthe admiration of a crowd of lower boys. At Spier’s, at the corner\r\nopposite the entrance to Weston’s Yard, Collegers were in the habit of\r\nleaving their gowns when going out of bounds towards Slough. Shelley\r\nas an Eton boy was a great frequenter of this sock shop, where the\r\nexcellent brown bread and butter and a pretty girl, Martha--the Hebe of\r\nSpier’s--as he called her, made a great impression upon his youthful\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nFarther away down Datchet Lane on breaking-up day, sporting spirits\r\nwould find traps of various sorts waiting for them--tandems were\r\noccasionally driven by Eton boys during the school-time, fags being\r\ntaken out to act as tigers on surreptitious drives to Salt Hill or\r\nto Marsh’s Inn at Maidenhead, once a favourite place of resort on\r\naccount of the cock-pit there. On one of these outings in a curricle,\r\na horse bolted, and the driver, brutalized by terror, ordered his fag\r\nto jump on the horse’s back and saw at his bit. The foolhardy feat\r\nwas accomplished, and the horse stopped, but the small boy’s arms\r\nwere almost pulled out of their sockets, and one of them got badly\r\ndislocated. According to one account it was Mr. Gladstone, then an Eton\r\nboy, who tried to rectify the injury before a doctor arrived.\r\n\r\n[SN: TRADITIONS]\r\n\r\nThe old Eton traditions were essentially aristocratic in their nature,\r\nas was only natural considering that the vast majority of the boys\r\nsent to the school were of good birth. Whilst amongst themselves the\r\nboys were highly intolerant of all assumptions of superiority not\r\nbased upon the distinctions of good fellowship and physical prowess,\r\nthey were rather prone to regard the rest of the world with easy and\r\ngood-natured contempt; indeed they thought themselves the finest\r\nfellows in the world, and little was done by the authorities to dispel\r\nsuch an idea. According to a certain standpoint, this, no doubt, was\r\nmere snobbishness, the main object of a favourite form of modern\r\naltruism being to assume that the lowest is better than the highest,\r\nand give way to everybody no matter who. It is, however, to be hoped\r\nthat the latter spirit--the spirit of defeat, not of victory--will not\r\nbe allowed to annihilate that individualism and independence which has\r\never been held dear by those educated amidst Eton’s classic shades.\r\nIn former days, no doubt, somewhat extravagant respect was paid to\r\nrank; but it must be remembered that the aristocracy were at that time\r\nthe real leaders of the country, and titles not merely honorary labels\r\npurchased by “plebeian money bags,” through contributions to their\r\nparty war chests. For the most part they then carried with them real\r\nterritorial power.\r\n\r\nIn its main features, the Eton of our forefathers was a true democracy,\r\nthough one enclosed in an aristocratic frame. In spite of Socialists\r\nand sentimentalists “all men are born unequal,” and our ancestors were\r\nfully alive to the odious affectation of ignoring social distinctions\r\nwhich always have existed, and always must exist in every society.\r\n\r\n[SN: BADGE GIVING]\r\n\r\nThe position of noblemen, as they were called (this included the\r\neldest sons of Peers), at Eton, then, somewhat resembled that of the\r\ngentlemen commoners at the University. Like the latter, they had to pay\r\nfor their privileges, double fees being exacted from their parents’\r\npockets. The privileges in question, it should be added, hurt nobody.\r\nOn the festivals of St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. David, and, if in the\r\nschool-time, St. George, the Headmaster entertained Scotch, Irish,\r\nWelsh or English boys of high birth at breakfast, and on such days he\r\nand the Lower Master wore an appropriate “badge,” presented to them by\r\nthe boy who was highest in rank of the nation which was celebrating its\r\npatron saint. Not infrequently the boy’s tutor was presented with one\r\nof these badges, sometimes quite valuable gifts, costing five or six\r\npounds apiece. There was no fixed pattern, the design being always left\r\nto the boy’s own taste, or to that of his parents; care, however, was\r\ntaken to introduce the shamrock, thistle, or leek, according to the day\r\nwhich was to be celebrated.\r\n\r\nThe quaint old usage was formerly quite a feature of the school-time\r\nduring which it took place. As late as 1862 a London newspaper gave\r\nan account of its observance. In that year, on St. Patrick’s day,\r\nLord Langford, as the highest Irish nobleman who was an Eton boy at\r\nthe time, presented badges of St. Patrick, beautifully embroidered\r\nin silver, to the Headmaster, the Reverend E. Balston, and to the\r\nLower Master, the Reverend W. Carter, both of whom wore these badges\r\nthroughout the day. On the same date, according to ancient custom,\r\ntwenty-four noblemen and gentlemen, as they were termed--that is to\r\nsay, Eton boys--attended a great breakfast given by the Headmaster.\r\n\r\nWhy such an inoffensive and pretty custom was ever allowed to become\r\nobsolete it is difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nAccording to one account, the individual responsible for the\r\ndiscontinuance was the late Duke of Sutherland, who, when it came\r\nto the turn of his son, Lord Stafford, to present the badge,\r\ndiscouraged him from carrying out the old usage, which he branded\r\nas mere nonsense. Probably the cost of the badges contributed to the\r\ndiscontinuance of their presentation. It seems a pity that a fixed\r\npattern worth some trifling sum was not adopted in order to prevent\r\nextravagance.\r\n\r\nThough the badges seem still to have been given up to the middle\r\nsixties of the last century, by 1879--amongst the boys at least--all\r\ntradition of anything of the sort had died away. One who had been at\r\nEton about 1866 told the writer that he had a vague remembrance of\r\nhearing of the custom, but it had then ceased to be observed.\r\n\r\nIt should be added that Dr. Hawtrey, in his monument in the College\r\nChapel, is represented wearing the badge of Scotland and the motto\r\n_Nemo me impune lacessit_.\r\n\r\n[SN: PRIVATE TUTORS]\r\n\r\nTill about 1835, noblemen who came to Eton usually brought private\r\ntutors with them, and boarded at dames: they were not obliged to have\r\nschool tutors. The most distinguished of these private tutors would\r\nappear to have been John Moultrie, who in 1822 acted in this capacity\r\nto Lord Craven, who three years later presented him with the living of\r\nRugby. As a youthful Colleger Moultrie had shown considerable poetic\r\npower, and had he died at an early age speculation might have been busy\r\nas to the great poems which English literature had lost through his\r\ndeath. His early reputation rested chiefly on “My Brother’s Grave,” in\r\nthe style of Byron’s “Prisoner of Chillon,” first published in the\r\nCollege Magazine and then in the _Etonian_. Often reprinted since,\r\nit is probably the most widely read of his writings. He was a warm\r\nlover of Eton, and paid a fine tribute of affection to his old school\r\nin an introduction to an edition of Gray. Bringing private tutors to\r\nEton seems to have entailed considerably great cost, for the Duke of\r\nAtholl told William Evans that his expenses under this system were\r\n£1000 a year! Dr. Hawtrey, it was, who made the rule that every boy\r\nshould have a school tutor, after which the custom of bringing private\r\ntutors practically ceased. Even in the sixties, however, it survived\r\nin a modified way. Lord Blandford, Lord Lorne, his brother, Lord\r\nArchibald Campbell, and his cousin, Lord Ronald Leveson Gower, all had\r\nprivate tutors--the last three, indeed, lived with one in a house by\r\nthemselves. George Monckton, afterwards Lord Galway, who was at Eton\r\nabout the same time, also enjoyed the same dubious advantage.\r\n\r\n[SN: CHAPEL]\r\n\r\nAs has already been mentioned at page 28, up to about 1845, boys who\r\nwere noblemen, sons of peers or baronets, sat in the stalls (ruthlessly\r\ntorn down during the so-called “restoration” of 1845-47) at the west\r\nend of the chapel, near the Provost and Headmaster; and, according\r\nto custom, a newcomer distributed packets of almonds and raisins to\r\nhis companions in the other seats of honour. Originally, it would\r\nseem, this curious usage was limited to the Sixth Form boys, who also\r\nfollowed it when for the first time they took their places as such.\r\nConsiderable obscurity, however, surrounds the whole subject of “chapel\r\nsock,” as it was called; probably it was the continuance of some\r\nmedieval custom, the meaning of which had disappeared ages before. The\r\neating of almonds and raisins during divine worship seems very strange\r\nto those of a later generation; in former times, however, it must be\r\nremembered the chapel was sometimes used for other purposes besides\r\nthe celebration of services. The election of the College Fellows, for\r\ninstance, took place there, and sometimes some of the electors tucked\r\nthemselves up as well as they could and went to sleep. The general tone\r\nof the school up to about seventy years ago was not very religious, or,\r\nit is to be feared, very reverent; there was, indeed, too much chapel\r\nand too little devotion.\r\n\r\nTwo long collegiate services on Sundays and whole holidays, and one on\r\nevery half-holiday, made the boys tired of the whole thing. New boys\r\nsometimes did take prayer-books in with them the first Sunday, but\r\nnever ventured to defy public opinion to that extent a second time.\r\nSome of the Upper School were nearly nineteen years old, but amongst\r\nthem taking the sacrament was almost unheard of. The chaplain (or\r\n“Conduct” as he was called) often misconducted himself by gabbling and\r\nskipping--whilst the masters, perched in desks aloft, kept themselves\r\njust awake by watching boys whom they “spited.” The boys themselves\r\nhad their own resources wherewith “to palliate dullness, and give time\r\na shove.” Kneeling with head down, as if in deep devotion, many a one\r\nof them contrived to carve his initials on his seat without being\r\nobserved, and very few took the least interest in the service. As for\r\nthe interminable sermons, those they frankly disliked and despised, the\r\npreachers being generally prosy and sometimes incoherent. As a fellow\r\nof some originality said in one of his quaint discourses, the hearts\r\nof the boys were like gooseberry tarts without sugar, and the vast\r\nmajority took little trouble to conceal their dislike for chapel during\r\nthe “restoration,” when the school attended service in a temporary\r\nbuilding. The forms on which they sat there being somewhat flimsy,\r\nevery effort was made to smash as many as possible, in order that boys\r\nmight have an excuse for absenting themselves owing to lack of seats.\r\n\r\nMost of the congregation looked upon the enormously lengthy services\r\nas so much extra school and took no interest in the responses, for\r\nyears uttered by an old clerk named Gray, who was an Eton institution\r\ndating from 1809. With the lapse of years he had become somewhat\r\ndeaf, and consequently made occasional blunders which were a constant\r\nsource of amusement. Especially did his hearers delight in old Gray’s\r\nperformances on certain festivals, such as the service for the queen’s\r\naccession, when he generally canonized her twice in the same verse of\r\nthe Psalm. “And blessed be the name of Her Majesty for ever, and all\r\nthe earth shall be full of Her Majesty.”\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the service was not conducted in a very reverent or\r\nattractive manner, and the impression which it would have seemed to\r\nconvey was that every one, including the “Conduct,” was anxious to\r\nget through it as quickly as possible. A great day, however, was\r\nOak Apple day, when the picturesque old service in memory of the\r\nRestoration of Charles II. was duly gone through, all the boys sporting\r\noak leaves as a memento of the Merry Monarch of joyous memory. On\r\nall other occasions, however, the services proceeded with monotonous\r\nand unvarying regularity, which more or less still prevailed in the\r\nwriter’s Eton days thirty years ago, though at that time they had been\r\nconsiderably brightened and no irreverence prevailed.\r\n\r\nThe chapel bell always stopped five minutes before the hour, but the\r\nProvost and Fellows never made their appearance till just as the\r\nclock struck; it seemed to be the object of all the bigger boys in\r\nthe school to come in as nearly as possible at the same time as the\r\nCollege authorities did, yet without running it so fine as to cause\r\na disagreeable rush at the last moment. These loiterers, always the\r\n“swells” of the school, took their places just before the entry upon\r\ntheir heels of the Sixth Form boys, who always headed the procession,\r\nwhich was closed by the Provost. His entry was the signal for the\r\ncommencement of the service, and the “Conduct” or chaplain whose turn\r\nit was at once began. Everything was got through at a pretty good pace,\r\nthough after about 1840 no slovenliness was to be observed.\r\n\r\n[SN: A FATAL SQUIB]\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, of course, even in the days when irreverence was\r\ncommon, the boys were moved by some extraordinary service which\r\nimpressed the most unthinking minds. One of these occasions was the\r\nfuneral service of a boy named Grieve, son of the English physician to\r\nthe Czar of Russia, at the commencement of the nineteenth century. On\r\nthe 5th of November, then a day of much riot at Eton, poor Grieve had\r\nfilled his pockets with what proved to him the instruments of death,\r\nin order to enjoy the frolics of the evening, which were suddenly\r\nended when a young nobleman unluckily “squibbed,” as it was called,\r\nhis unfortunate friend. Some of the fireworks which were in his pocket\r\nimmediately ignited, which, communicating to the rest their deadly\r\nerrand, exploded, and literally tore off a portion of flesh from his\r\nbones. The poor fellow’s screams were dreadful, and he died in four\r\ndays’ time.\r\n\r\nThis sad affair threw a gloom over the school for a long time, and\r\ngames and sports were almost forgotten. When the day came for Grieve’s\r\nburial, its awe was strongly augmented by the solemnity with which the\r\nfuneral service (that most beautiful and sublime selection of prayers)\r\nwas read by the headmaster, Dr. Goodall; indeed, among the whole body\r\nof upwards of five hundred boys, not a dry eye was to be seen. One of\r\nthese has left on record how to his dying day he could never forget\r\nthe impression made on his mind, when, with a trembling anticipation\r\nof the approaching procession, he heard the first words, “I am the\r\nresurrection and the life,” and his poignant emotion as the funeral\r\nprocession slowly wound into the chapel and the sky-blue coffin[2]\r\nbroke upon his sight.\r\n\r\nAn old Eton Sunday institution was “prose,” held in Upper School, where\r\nthe Headmaster would read a few pithy moral sentences. As a rule it is\r\nto be feared these were pearls thrown before swine, and the swine-herd\r\nseemed to feel disgusted as he threw them. He then gave out the\r\nsubjects of exercises for the ensuing week, and informed the boys what\r\nwould be the amount of holidays in it.\r\n\r\nIn the old days a number of the Eton masters were not the earnest\r\nmen who are to be found in the school to-day. At a time when the\r\naristocracy possessed great power, it was not extraordinary that young\r\nnoblemen should have been treated with a great measure of leniency. A\r\ncertain tutor, for instance, behaved with great philosophy when one of\r\nhis pupils, belonging to a great family, rolled him down the hundred\r\nsteps, and reaped the reward by afterwards rising to a position of high\r\neminence in the Church. Not a few masters were shackled by hide-bound\r\nconservatism, whilst a certain type of eighteenth century pedagogue was\r\nquite unfitted to inculcate learning.\r\n\r\n  Lo! on a pile of dusty folios thron’d,\r\n  Her Janus brows with dog’s-ear’d fool’s-cap crown’d,\r\n  Fenc’d with a footstool, that no step should go\r\n  Too rashly near, nor crush her gouty toe,\r\n  Obese Tuition sits, and ever drips\r\n  An inky slaver from her bloated lips!\r\n  Unwholesome vapours round her presence shed,\r\n  Dim ev’ry eye, and muddle ev’ry head,\r\n  Stunt the young shoots, which smil’d with promise once,\r\n  And breathe a deeper dulness on the dunce.\r\n\r\nIt is not fair to criticise the old Eton masters too severely, but\r\nundoubtedly some were incompetent. They were quite content that matters\r\nshould proceed as they understood they had proceeded in the past,\r\nand thought it no part of their duty to attempt improvement in the\r\ntime-honoured curriculum which for generations had been in vogue at\r\n“Eton School.”\r\n\r\n[SN: A BABY OPPIDAN]\r\n\r\nIn the early twenties of the nineteenth century, boys who were mere\r\nchildren, hardly out of petticoats, were sent to Eton in order that\r\nthey might gradually work their way up and get to King’s. Oppidans also\r\nwere then very young, a child aged four and a half being admitted in\r\n1820. At that time a boy could rise to the top of the school merely\r\nby seniority, due importance not being attached to hard work and\r\nsound scholarship. The “trials” were then more or less nominal, but\r\nthe curious thing is, that in spite of all this Eton produced some\r\nvery fine classical scholars, while the vast majority of the boys\r\nwere better acquainted with Latin and Greek than their successors who\r\nwent to Eton when a more exacting curriculum came into force. In 1827\r\nthere were no examinations after the Fifth Form was reached, nor any\r\ndistinction attainable except that of being sent up “for good,” the\r\nreward for which then was a sovereign, and every third time, a book.\r\n\r\nWhen a master came across some peculiarly good set of verses he would\r\nsend them up to the Headmaster “for good”; in due course the writer\r\nwould be called up by the Head, who would compliment him and read\r\nout the lines to the assembled boys in Upper School. A guinea was\r\nafterwards given to the boy by his dame. Sending up “for good” seems\r\nnow on the increase, but in my own school-days one seldom heard of\r\nany one achieving such a distinction, whilst sending up “for play”\r\nwas rarer still. In the past, getting into Sixth Form did not change\r\nan Eton boy’s life nearly so much as it does to-day. True, he had his\r\nseat in the stalls in chapel, and came into church later than any one\r\nelse except the Provost and Fellows; in Upper School on certain public\r\noccasions, he had also the honour of making speeches. Beyond this,\r\nhowever, and the release from shirking the masters, his position was in\r\nno wise altered or improved.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago Eton in respect to school work somewhat resembled\r\nan oriental state in which the first symptoms of modernisation are\r\nbeginning to appear. In the main the old classical traditions\r\ncommanded a rigid adherence, boys with a totally insufficient knowledge\r\nof Greek being by a polite fiction supposed to be able to construe\r\nHomer with ease, whilst dunces who could not write a sentence in\r\ncorrect English were every week obliged to show up a copy of Latin\r\nverses. The wonder is how all this was ever done at all, but done it\r\nwas; and, considering the vast ignorance of the majority, who frankly\r\nregarded the whole thing with a sort of good-humoured contempt, done\r\nfairly well. Perhaps this was in no small degree owing to the fact that\r\nin almost every house there was some easy-going clever boy who, having\r\nreceived a good grounding at a private school, was able and ready to\r\nhelp his less gifted schoolfellows.\r\n\r\n[SN: MAP MAKING]\r\n\r\nOne of the great features of school work was the execution of a map\r\nonce every week, illustrating various countries as they were in\r\nclassical times. Occasionally boys with a turn for drawing would\r\ndecorate the margins of their maps with some fanciful device. As a\r\nrule, the masters extended a good-humoured toleration to this practice,\r\nwhich often bore some reference to current events. At the time when a\r\ncoming prize-fight was exciting great interest in sporting circles,\r\na boy decorated the top of his map with portraits of the two fistic\r\nheroes of the day. This, however, was little appreciated by his master.\r\nA more clever form of decoration was the picture of an eight-oar\r\nmanned by masters and steered by Dr. Keate which a clever pupil of the\r\nDoctor drew in the middle of the Mediterranean with _Gens inimica mihi\r\nTyrrhenum navigat aequor_ inscribed beneath the boat. All the maps were\r\nshown up on the same day, when “Map Morning,” as it was called, filled\r\nthe school yard.\r\n\r\nThe old system of sending mere children to Eton lasted up to about\r\nhalf a century ago. In 1857 boys went still there as young as nine\r\nor ten, nor was it uncommon to see children of seven or eight in the\r\nLower School. Many stayed at Eton till they were eighteen, after\r\nhaving worked their way up from the First Form to Doctor’s Division,\r\nat the rate of two removes a year--a process which, including three\r\nyears’ inevitable stoppage in Upper Fifth, required more than ten\r\nyears to accomplish. In the school list for Election, 1834, Lower\r\nSchool has shrunk to a very small number. The first part of it, Third\r\nForm, contains but three boys; the second division, seven. “Sense” and\r\n“Nonsense,” which come next, have but six between them; there is no one\r\nin Second Form, and in First Form only two.\r\n\r\nUp to the early ’sixties of the last century, certain divisions of\r\nThird Form retained some quaint old titles--the first sections being\r\ncalled Upper Greek, Lower Greek, “Sense” and “Nonsense.” Lower Remove,\r\nUpper and Lower Remove in the Second Form and First Form completed the\r\ntail-end of the school. “Sense” and “Nonsense,” it should be added,\r\nreceived their quaint titles because boys in the latter were doomed to\r\na sort of “poetical purgatory,” and only wrote “nonsense” verses; that\r\nis, Latin compositions which scanned as verse, but contained no ideas;\r\nin which respect the effusions in question resembled the productions of\r\nsome living bards.\r\n\r\n[SN: LOWER SCHOOL]\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. John Hawtrey was an Eton master, Lower School, somewhat\r\naltering its constitution, became larger again; the boys in it, mostly\r\nvery young, being all together in his house at the corner of Keate’s\r\nLane, where he kept what was practically a private school apart. His\r\nboys were not allowed the same amount of liberty as those in other\r\nhouses: they took breakfast and tea in common, and generally played\r\ntheir games in Mr. Hawtrey’s private field. On reaching the Upper\r\nSchool they usually went to other houses.\r\n\r\nThe curriculum of Lower School was entirely different from that\r\nfollowed by the Upper Forms. In “Nonsense” the boys, besides being\r\ntaught to write nonsense verses, grappled with intricacies of the old\r\n“Eton Latin Grammar.” After this they were promoted to “Sense,” when\r\nthe nonsense verses were discarded; Lower Greek and Upper Greek did\r\nvery elementary work.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. John Hawtrey had left Eton to set up a preparatory school\r\nat Aldin House, Slough, Lower School once more became small. In 1868,\r\njust previous to its abolition, it contained 69 boys. The school\r\nlist had then ceased to give the old terms, Upper Greek, “Sense,” and\r\n“Nonsense.” Shortly after First and Second Forms were abolished and\r\nFourth Form placed under control of the Lower Master, the Reverend\r\nFrancis Edward Durnford, so well known as “Judy” to several generations\r\nof Etonians. Third Form still continued to exist in the writer’s day\r\n(1879 to 1883); but it then seldom contained more than two or three\r\nboys. Since that time it has varied in number, sometimes amounting to\r\nten or a dozen, or, as at present (1911), eight. It is interesting to\r\nnote that there are now more than sixty assistant masters, as compared\r\nwith ten in 1834. In the same time the number of boys at Eton has more\r\nthan doubled.\r\n\r\n[SN: SHIRKING]\r\n\r\nUp to the end of the nineteenth century there was a glaring\r\ninconsistency in various unwritten regulations which ruled the Eton\r\nboy out of school. Certain ordinances were seemingly moulded upon an\r\nHibernian model, many things being forbidden in theory though allowed\r\nin practice. Up to 1860 everything beyond Barnes Pool Bridge was\r\nconsidered out of bounds, though the river and terrace of Windsor\r\nCastle were not. The boys, of course, went up town freely, most of\r\nthe shops they used being in the High Street beyond the bridge, and\r\nso the ridiculous custom of “shirking” grew up. When an Eton boy up\r\ntown perceived a master he would get behind a lamp-post or rush into a\r\nshop, the merest pretext of concealment from view being, as a rule,\r\nsufficient to prevent the “beak” from taking any notice of him, for\r\nit was not etiquette for masters to see boys, provided “shirking” was\r\nobserved. A number of extraordinary usages prevailed in connection with\r\nthe somewhat senseless custom. For instance, it was not the thing for a\r\nmaster to turn round to look out for a boy following behind--the whole\r\nsystem was ludicrous. One boy, seeing a master enter a confectioner’s\r\nshop, where he was eating an ice, escaped notice by shutting one eye\r\nand holding up the spoon in front of the other!\r\n\r\nAt one time Sixth Form boys had to be “shirked” like the masters, but\r\nthis seems to have been very laxly observed, “liberties,” that is to\r\nsay exemptions, being often granted.\r\n\r\nAnother great inconsistency was that though by the laws of the school,\r\nno Eton boy might enter the Christopher, there were very few Etonians\r\nwho were not thoroughly acquainted with the interior of the old town,\r\nwhere at one time Upper boys had regular dinners which were known to\r\nthe whole school.\r\n\r\n[SN: WINDSOR FAIR]\r\n\r\nThough “shirking” as a general rule ensured a boy’s immunity from\r\npunishment when out of bounds, it ceased to exercise its charm at\r\nWindsor Fair (abolished about 1871), which was strictly prohibited.\r\nNevertheless, the boys attended it in flocks, part of their amusement\r\nconsisting in dodging the masters.\r\n\r\nIt was highly characteristic of the old-fashioned Eton system, that\r\nthough the Fair was strictly forbidden, no efforts at all were made to\r\nprevent boys from going there, though they were often severely punished\r\nif caught. Not a few of the masters, however, almost openly tolerated\r\nsuch transgressions, and a few even made a point of giving their\r\npupils double pocket-money in Fair week. It must be remembered that\r\nat that time all the masters were old Etonians, having passed their\r\nlives between the school and King’s. Consequently they were generally\r\nimbued with the old traditions, and had never come across any external\r\ninfluences likely to alter a point of view adopted when they themselves\r\nwere being trained by masters of an old-fashioned Conservative type.\r\n\r\nAt the Fair a large quantity of pocket-money was expended at the\r\nvarious booths, the keepers of which, of course, at once recognised an\r\nEton boy, whom all the professional tricksters of the place looked upon\r\nas their surest game. Every device was put before him, and all sorts of\r\ntemptations held out to induce him to stop and have a trial, as they\r\ncalled it, of his luck. Cards, rings, coins, everything in fact was\r\nmade into an instrument for gaining a little money during this harvest\r\nof inexperience.\r\n\r\nThe rifle gallery, where they gave two shots for a penny, was a\r\nfavourite resort, and every stall which the boys passed, whatever\r\nwas the sort of trumpery with which it was filled, formed an excuse\r\nfor loitering to examine what there was. Dolls and knives and penny\r\ntrumpets and rattles, all required attention; boxes and brooches were\r\nhaggled over, and rings, and even rags, minutely inspected.\r\n\r\nThe Fair consisted of a number of booths stretching from the Town Hall\r\nto Castle Yard. There were the usual shows, and in the eighteenth\r\ncentury a bull bait on Bachelors’ Acre, the place of which, in\r\nlatter years, was taken by roulette. This game, of course, run by\r\ndoubtful characters, was highly attractive to certain venturesome\r\nEtonians--there was real danger in it, for a boy caught playing was\r\nturned down to a lower form as well as whipped.\r\n\r\nThough many boys were flogged for going to this October festival, it\r\nwas always a source of great delight to the school, for it gave rise to\r\nmany jokes.\r\n\r\nIt was a common practice for boys to purchase all sorts of mechanical\r\ntoys--jumping frogs and the like--there, and surreptitiously introduce\r\nthem upon some master’s desk. On one occasion, a perfect menagerie was\r\nsuccessfully planted on the table before Dr. Hawtrey’s very nose, and\r\nall the punishment the culprits received for their tomfoolery was his\r\nwithering remark, “Babies!”\r\n\r\nAs late as the beginning of the nineteenth century the old Windsor\r\nTheatre was often visited by Etonians. The gallery, indeed, seems\r\nto have been more or less reserved for their use. By the middle of\r\nthe century, however, the boys had long ceased to indulge in this\r\namusement, but up to the late seventies a considerable number\r\nfrequented Windsor races, at that time an open meeting.\r\n\r\nIn 1879, the writer’s first year at Eton, an idea prevailed that if\r\nwe could run there and back without missing Absence, such a visit\r\nwas not forbidden. Be this as it may, the writer, with a friend,\r\ndid run there and back, the only unpleasant consequence being the\r\nloss of some pocket-money. In the following year, besides the notice\r\nprohibiting boys from being on the Windsor bank of the river during\r\nthe races (which, nevertheless, did not prevent a considerable number\r\nfrom crossing over), drastic measures were taken by the authorities\r\nto prevent Etonians from going there on foot, which, owing to the\r\nvigilance of masters in Windsor, had to be abandoned altogether. It\r\nwas no unheard-of thing for a boy in those days to run to Ascot races\r\nand get back in time for Absence--then at six. This, of course, was\r\ncontrived by getting lifts on the way, and though some were caught\r\nand punished, quite a number indulged in what was to them an exciting\r\nadventure. Two or three got to the races by assuming a disguise, whilst\r\nothers were picked up and hidden in carriages and traps by obliging\r\nelder brothers or old Etonians. One boy--Bathurst by name--according to\r\ncurrent report, so tickled young Lady Savernake by his impersonation of\r\na nigger-minstrel that she gave him a £5 piece.\r\n\r\n[SN: PIG FAIR]\r\n\r\nIn Eton itself up to the ’thirties of the last century, every Ash\r\nWednesday there was held a Pig Fair, just outside Upper School; this,\r\nof course, led to great disorder--the boys delighting in letting the\r\npigs loose, and chasing them in all directions. At the last of these\r\nFairs in Keate’s time, a boy actually rode a pig from the gate of\r\nWeston’s Yard to the Christopher, at the identical moment when Keate\r\ncame out of Keate’s Lane on the way to chapel, his gown flying in the\r\nwind. Keate took little notice of this at the time, merely remarking,\r\n“Pigs will squeak, and boys will laugh; don’t do it again.”\r\n\r\nWhen Gladstone was a boy at Eton, considerable brutality existed in\r\nconnection with the Fair. The boys, according to old custom, hustling\r\nthe drovers and then cutting off the tails of the pigs. Gladstone\r\nboldly denounced such cruelty, and gave considerable offence by\r\ndeclaring that the boys who were foremost in this kind of butchery were\r\nthe first to quake at the consequences of detection. He dared them, if\r\nthey were proud of their work, to sport the trophies of it in their\r\nhats. On the following Ash Wednesday he found three newly amputated\r\npig-tails hung in a bunch on his door, with a paper inscribed:\r\n\r\n  “Quisquis amat porcos, porcis amabitur illis;\r\n    Cauda sit exemplum ter repetita tibi.”\r\n\r\nUnderneath these lines the future Prime Minister wrote a challenge to\r\nthe pig-torturers, inviting them to come forward and take a receipt\r\nfor their offering, which he would mark “in good round hand upon your\r\nfaces.” The pig-baiting, however, continued till Dr. Hawtrey did away\r\nwith the Fair.\r\n\r\nEven in the rough old times the life of the Oppidans was pleasant\r\nenough; a totally different state of affairs prevailing amongst them\r\nfrom that which flourished in Long Chamber, where small collegers were\r\nso roughly treated that many of them preferred to be Oppidans till such\r\ntime as they had attained a place in the school which would guarantee\r\nthem against being bullied.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Oppidans, indeed, there would seem never to have been any\r\nbullying at all, whilst their health and comfort was looked after\r\npretty much as it is to-day. Nevertheless, in old days, they had a\r\nfar greater knowledge of the stern facts of life than is at present\r\nthe case. Their rambles round the slums of Windsor--visits to the\r\nFair and contact with the rough and undesirable characters of the\r\nvicinity--taught them what human nature really is, while the fighting,\r\nwhich was then recognised, precluded all trace of namby-pambyism. In\r\nthose days Eton sent forth few sentimentalists into the great world,\r\nbut it undoubtedly furnished England with the very best type of officer\r\nto meet the enemy in the Peninsular and at Waterloo. It was an era when\r\nthe sickening cant of humanitarianism, born of luxury and weakness, had\r\nnot yet arisen to emasculate and enfeeble the British race.\r\n\r\n[SN: FAGGING]\r\n\r\nFagging at Eton seems never to have degenerated into brutality. In\r\nformer times, however, fags had to perform many services which sound\r\nstrange to modern ears. An Etonian, for instance, who had been fag\r\nto the future Wellington, it is said, used to declare that the chief\r\nservice he had to perform was that of bed-warmer, for the Fifth Form\r\nthen made the Lower boys lie for a time in their beds to take off the\r\nchill. This story, however, is probably legendary, fagging amongst\r\nthe Oppidans having generally been limited to getting breakfasts from\r\nsock shops, taking messages, and cooking. Fag-masters have seldom been\r\nanything but considerate, and the old joke of sending a green newcomer\r\n(after his first fortnight of immunity from fagging) to Layton’s, the\r\nconfectioner on Windsor Hill, for a pennyworth of pigeon milk, has\r\nprobably never been put into practice.\r\n\r\nAs long as a hundred years ago cases of bullying out of College\r\nwere sternly repressed by the boys themselves. At that time a great\r\nsensation was caused because a boy high in the Fifth Form flicked with\r\na wet towel the bare back of his fag, who complained after Absence\r\nto the captain of the school. The circumstances soon got wind, and\r\nnearly the whole school followed the captain to the bully’s dame’s,\r\nwhich was Raguineau’s. He was pulled out of his room, and most soundly\r\nhorsewhipped close by one of the large elms, to the delight of all.\r\n\r\nThough the accommodation was not uncomfortable, the boys’ rooms were\r\nthen, as a rule, smaller and less luxurious than is the case to-day,\r\nthe windows being often barred like those of a prison or a lunatic\r\nasylum. The furniture was all of the commonest wood, and consisted of a\r\ntable, two chairs (well carved by preceding generations), a bureau--a\r\nsort of _multum in parvo_ for books, clothes, and everything else--and\r\na large press which turned into a bed; this, small boys always regarded\r\nwith misgiving, it being a practice for raiding parties to shut the\r\noccupier up in it.\r\n\r\nIn 1825 some of the rooms were as small as five feet by six, some were\r\nnot carpeted, and a few of those on the ground floor were unpleasant\r\nowing to the contents of pails descending from the upper windows.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth of November the Lower boys revenged their wrongs by making\r\na bonfire of their Greek grammars in the school-yard; and later in the\r\nyear, when the snow came, they would industriously collect it in the\r\nhouse, in order that in the evening they might overwhelm some little\r\nfellow and his books with a pile of it.\r\n\r\nVery early rising was then the rule, and in winter boys got up by\r\ncandle-light. The Fourth Form had an infliction called “Long-morning.”\r\nThey had to be in school by half-past seven, but when the masters\r\noverslept themselves there was a “run”--_i.e._ no school. At the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century there was an earlier school still,\r\nat six o’clock.\r\n\r\n[SN: NICKNAMES]\r\n\r\nNicknames have always been popular at Eton, many of them enduring in\r\nafter-life. Thomas James, who in 1766 wrote an account of the school,\r\nwas nicknamed Mordecai and Pasteboard, whilst the three brothers Pott\r\nwere called Quart, Pint, and Gill.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the eighteenth century nicknames both for masters\r\nand boys were very common. Certain masters were then called Pernypopax\r\nDampier, Gronkey Graham, Pogy Roberts, Buck Ekins, Bantam Sumner,\r\nand Wigblock Prior. The following are some boys’ nicknames:--Bacchus\r\nBrowning (Earl Powis), Square Buckeridge, Tiger Clive, King Cole,\r\nMother and Hoppy Cotes, Damme Duer, Dapper Dubery, Baboon FitzHugh,\r\nChob and Chuff Hunter, Toby Liddell, Squashey Pollard, Codger Praed,\r\nHog Weston, Gobbo Young, and Woglog Calley.\r\n\r\nIn old days many Eton nicknames were superior, and often elegantly\r\nclassical. At one time a boy named M’Guire was well known in the\r\nschool, because, if prizes had been given for knock-knees he would have\r\ncarried off the first prize anywhere. Homer has a stock of phrases\r\nwith which he is apt to fill up his verse, just as lawyers use “common\r\nforms” for their prose. One of these, frequently occurring in the\r\ndescription of a hero, is _phaidima guia_ (beautiful limbs), and Paddy\r\nM’Guire bore the appropriate name of “Phaidima Guia.”\r\n\r\nA peculiarly happy nickname was Lapis Lazuli or Cornelius a lapide,\r\napplied to a boy (Newcastle scholar), in after-life well known to\r\nEtonians as the Rev. E. D. Stone. He recently contributed some most\r\ninteresting recollections of Eton to an attractive book written by Mr.\r\nChristopher Stone, his son.\r\n\r\nOne of the most apt nicknames ever bestowed on any boy was Verd\r\nAntique, applied to the eldest of five brothers Green, who were at Eton\r\nat the same time--the other four being known as Maximus, Major, Minor,\r\nand Minimus.\r\n\r\nSlang, though fairly prevalent then, in later years was of a different\r\nkind. It would appear that Eton boys did not then say “burry” for\r\n“bureau,” nor “brolly” for “umbrella,” whilst “footer” for “football”\r\nwas unknown. A favourite old Eton colloquialism, “con,” a word\r\nequivalent in its meaning to chum and pal, has now long died out,\r\nwhilst “pec” used for money was about obsolete thirty years ago.\r\n“Scug,” an untidy boy, and “scuggish,” bad form, words which were\r\nconstantly in the mouths of Etonians of two or three generations back,\r\nare now, I believe, much less used by Upper boys. “Sock,” a term\r\ndenoting all kinds of dainties, still exists, but masters are called\r\n“ushers” instead of “beaks.” “Gig,” an old piece of Eton slang which\r\ncomprehended all that was ridiculous, all that was to be laughed at and\r\nplagued, has long ceased to be used.\r\n\r\n[SN: DAMES AND TUTORS]\r\n\r\nA curious and old-fashioned word once in constant use amongst Eton\r\nboys, but now quite obsolete, was “brozier”--this indicated a boy who\r\nhad spent his pocket-money, and was without means of obtaining “sock.”\r\nBrozier was also used in connection with a disconcerting manœuvre\r\nsometimes executed by boys at the expense of a dame. When one of these\r\nladies had gained the reputation of not providing sufficient food at\r\nthe usual meals, and of keeping an ill-stocked larder, an organised\r\nattempt would be made to eat her “out of house and home”--as the supply\r\nof provisions became exhausted, more would be demanded in the most\r\npointed manner--this was known as “Brozier my dame.”\r\n\r\nOne of these ladies, possessed of great strength of mind and resource,\r\nbeing exposed to a determined attempt of this kind, turned the tide\r\njust as her boys--though nearly choked in the moment of victory--were\r\nwinning the battle. Whispering two words to her maid, the latter\r\ndisappeared only to return with an enormous cheese, as strong as it\r\nwas big. This the dame cut away liberally, saying with a smile, that\r\nit must not be spared, for there was another bigger one handy. The\r\nboys never tried a brozier with her again. This lady had a happy knack\r\nof managing her boys, and after getting them flogged relentlessly on\r\nslight provocation, would, in spite of themselves, laugh them out of\r\nall ill-humour.\r\n\r\nThe earliest “Tutor’s” house on record seems to have been kept by W. H.\r\nRoberts, a master who took a few pupils in 1760. When the eighteenth\r\ncentury had got fairly under way, the Oppidans were in all probability\r\ndistributed amongst “dames” and tutors in much the same way as has\r\nprevailed in recent times.\r\n\r\nOf late, however, a dame has come to be merely the technical name of a\r\nhouse-master who has no regular “division” or class in the school. They\r\nare often mathematical masters, or teachers of special subjects. In old\r\ndays many ladies used to keep boarding-houses for the boys, which of\r\ncourse gave rise to the name of “dame.” Miss Evans, who died in 1906,\r\nwas the last of these. She was universally respected and beloved, and\r\noccupied a unique position in Eton life,--her name will long survive.\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated dames of other days was Miss Angelo, a\r\npretty woman who, it is said, was made an Eton dame owing to the\r\ngood offices of George the Fourth when Prince of Wales. This lady’s\r\npony chaise and fur tippet were familiar to several generations of\r\nEtonians, among whom she bore the nickname of the Duchess of Eton.\r\nShe belonged to the famous family which furnished four generations of\r\nfencing-masters to the school.\r\n\r\n[SN: LEAVING BOOKS]\r\n\r\nOld Eton was full of peculiar customs--bad, good, and indifferent.\r\nAmongst the latter was the giving of Leaving-Books. Often a popular\r\nboy would go away from Eton with quite a fine little library of these,\r\nand towards the end of each school-time there was some rivalry and\r\nexcitement about these collections. Williams’ (the bookseller) shop\r\nbecame resplendent at such times, the books being all handsomely\r\nbound and mostly gilt, and varying in price from a guinea upwards.\r\nEventually, however, the gifts became absurdly numerous, and in 1868\r\nthe custom was abolished by Dr. Hornby--mainly, I believe, on the\r\nscore of economy. It might have been better, perhaps, to have limited\r\nthe price of the books, for these gifts were productive of kindly\r\nfeelings. The receiver always shook hands with the donor and requested\r\nhim to write his name in the book, and the collection formed a pleasant\r\nremembrance of Eton in after years, and a memorial of friendship with\r\nschoolfellows.\r\n\r\nEvery boy who gave a leaving-book had to be thanked and shaken hands\r\nwith. And in the last week of the Half boys came and wrote their names\r\nin their respective books “after two,” when those leaving Eton were\r\nexpected to be in their rooms, where various dainties were provided.\r\nAfter the names had been signed there was more shaking of hands.\r\n\r\nAnother old usage, now very rightly abolished, was “Leaving-Money.” In\r\nformer days an Oppidan, as he said good-bye to the Headmaster, would\r\nleave, in an envelope, a sum, the amount of which depended upon the\r\ngenerosity of his parents.\r\n\r\nThe recognised method for a boy to present this donation was to hold\r\nthe envelope inside his hat, which he would place for a moment on the\r\ntable, and so unostentatiously deposit his offering.\r\n\r\nThe position of a Headmaster receiving such gifts was rather awkward,\r\nand Dr. Hawtrey, a man of great delicacy and refinement of manner,\r\nused to ignore them as far as was possible. At the end of the Summer\r\nHalf, he would observe, “It’s rather warm, I think I’ll open the\r\nwindow,” and as he did so, the envelope was furtively laid upon the\r\ntable. When the next boy who was leaving was ushered in, the same\r\nprocess was gone through, except that the Doctor would observe, “Don’t\r\nyou think it’s rather cold? I think I’d better shut the window.”\r\n\r\n[SN: THE LONG GLASS]\r\n\r\nA distinctly bad old custom, which prevailed up to quite recent\r\ntimes, was the draining of the “Long Glass” at Tap--that curious Eton\r\ninstitution where the Upper part of the school are still allowed to\r\nobtain chops, steaks, bread and cheese, beer and cider. Though the long\r\nglass is still preserved, I believe it has not been used for many a\r\nlong year, a circumstance which can arouse nothing but gratification\r\namongst all sensible people.\r\n\r\nAt one time there was “Long-Glass” drinking once or twice a week during\r\nthe Summer Half. Nearly a yard long, and holding a quart, the glass\r\nin question somewhat resembles a coach-horn with a bulb instead of\r\nan opening at the large end. Aspirants to the honour of draining it\r\nattended in an upper room of Tap after two, each with a napkin tied\r\nround his neck. The object was to drain the glass without removing it\r\nfrom the lips, and without spilling any of its contents, which was\r\nextremely hard, for when the contents of the tubular portion of the\r\nglass had been sucked down, the beer in the globe would remain for a\r\nmoment as if congealed there; and if the glass was tilted up a little,\r\nand shaken, the beer would give a gurgle and suddenly splutter all over\r\nhis face and clothes. Only by holding the Long Glass at a certain angle\r\ncould a catastrophe be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe results of this rather disgusting practice were often to be clearly\r\ndiscerned on the coats and waistcoats of boys emerging from Tap, and it\r\nis to be hoped that, unlike some other old Eton customs which deserve\r\nrevival, it will remain merely a memory of a more intemperate age.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[2] It seems to have been an old custom for boys who died at Eton to be\r\nburied thus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII DR. KEATE--FLOGGING AND FIGHTING\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the eighteenth century the Eton boys had become somewhat\r\ndifficult to control. Heath and Goodall had both been Headmasters fond\r\nof comfort and ease, and in order to keep things from drifting into\r\na state of open disorder, ignored many infractions of discipline.\r\nIn consequence of this they both enjoyed a fair measure of personal\r\npopularity--the parents would seem to have known little about what was\r\ngoing on, for, in spite of the continued deterioration in discipline,\r\nthe numbers of the school continued to rise.\r\n\r\n[SN: DR. KEATE]\r\n\r\nWhen Keate became Headmaster in 1809, he found himself confronted by a\r\nsomewhat difficult situation. A man of unflinching character, he had at\r\nfirst to suffer for the weakness of his predecessors and, owing to his\r\nstern methods, incurred unpopularity which it took some time to efface.\r\n\r\nNo one who had ever come in contact with Keate ever forgot him, for his\r\nappearance was exceedingly striking. He was a small man, little more\r\nthan five feet high, short-necked, short-legged, thick-set, powerful,\r\nand very active, whilst within his small frame was concentrated the\r\npluck of ten battalions. His countenance resembled that of a bull-dog,\r\nand he also had something of that animal’s mouth. Indeed, it was\r\nsaid in the school that old Keate could pin and hold a bull with his\r\nteeth. His iron sway was to many a very unpleasant change, after the\r\nlong, mild reign of Dr. Goodall, whose temper, character, and conduct\r\ncorresponded precisely with his name, and under whom Keate had been\r\nmaster of the Lower School. He was at first, there can be little doubt,\r\ntoo severe; discipline, wholesome and necessary in moderation, being\r\ncarried by him to an excess; on one morning alone he is said to have\r\nflogged eighty boys. Flogging, indeed, may be said to have been the\r\nhead and front, or rather the head and tail, of his system. Like Dr.\r\nBusby, the famous Headmaster of Westminster School, he never spoilt the\r\nchild by sparing the rod. According to Dr. Johnson, Busby used to call\r\nthat instrument of correction his sieve, and declare that whoever did\r\nnot pass through it was no boy for him. Keate, although rigid, rough,\r\nand despotical, was on the whole not unjust, nor devoid of kindness,\r\na proof of which is that, after twenty-five years, he retired fairly\r\ntriumphant, applauded and respected by the vast majority of those with\r\nwhom he had come in contact. During one of the frequent visits which he\r\npaid to Eton after his retirement, his grim old face was seen looking\r\ndown on the boats in Boveney Lock, whereupon the crews stood up and\r\ncheered their old master with a will.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written of the curious appearance of the famous\r\nHeadmaster, who has been said to have worn a fancy dress partly\r\nresembling the costume of Napoleon and partly that of a widow woman.\r\nThis was a great exaggeration. It is true he wore a huge cocked hat;\r\nthis was not from eccentricity, but because he was a Conservative and\r\nrespected tradition--it had long been the custom for the Head- and\r\nLower-Masters at Eton to wear such a head-dress, and Keate merely\r\nretained it after it had become obsolete with the rest of the world.\r\n\r\n[SN: THE ROUGH OLD DAYS]\r\n\r\nAs a rule the famous Headmaster wore an angry look, whilst ever ready\r\nto explode into a rage, though occasionally flashes of unexpected\r\ngood-nature would temper his attitude of unwavering severity. This,\r\nhowever, was seldom, his command over his good temper being so complete\r\nthat he scarcely ever allowed it to appear. On the other hand he could\r\nnot be put out of humour, being always in the ill-humour which he\r\nthought fitting for a Headmaster. He had a fine voice, which he could\r\nmodulate with great skill; but he had also the power of quacking like\r\nan angry duck, and the latter was his almost invariable way of speaking\r\nto boys to inspire respect. His red shaggy eyebrows were so prominent\r\nthat he habitually used them as arms and hands for the purpose of\r\npointing out any object towards which he wished to direct attention.\r\nThe rest of his features were equally striking in their way, and highly\r\ncharacteristic of the man.\r\n\r\nDr. Keate was not devoid of sense of humour. On one occasion when he\r\nhad set a certain form an essay on “_Temere nil facias_,” one boy\r\nnamed Rashleigh failed to send in any work at all. The Doctor, who of\r\nall men was the last to be trifled with in such matters, sent for the\r\ndelinquent, and, glowering with ferocity, demanded the meaning of such\r\nconduct. The culprit, however, was quite undismayed and replied, “Sir,\r\nyou told me yourself not to do it.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” retorted Keate in tones of thunder.\r\n\r\n“Why, sir,” replied the boy, “in setting the theme you said, ‘Do\r\nnothing rashly,’ and I have obeyed you.” This display of ready wit, it\r\nis said, secured the offender’s pardon.\r\n\r\nWhen Keate assumed the Headmastership the whole public-school system\r\nhad remained behind the age, and many of the manners and customs of\r\nbarbarous times still continued at schools long after home life and\r\nmanners had become civilised. There is no reason to suppose that Dr.\r\nKeate was in any way of a brutal disposition or wanting in natural\r\naffections. He had to deal with a very difficult situation, and it is\r\ngreatly to his credit that he maintained the prestige and increased the\r\nnumbers of Eton in spite of almost insurmountable difficulties.\r\n\r\nWhen, for instance, it became clear to the boys that the easy-going\r\nstate of affairs which had prevailed under Dr. Goodall had come to an\r\nend, the school was thrown into a state of latent rebellion. One of\r\nthe first innovations imposed by Keate was to impose an “absence” the\r\nevening after what was then known as “long church.”\r\n\r\nThe first time this was put into force the whole school booed the\r\nHeadmaster as he opened his mouth, and it took him two hours to get\r\nthrough calling the “absence,” though various tutors did all they could\r\nto help him detect the boys who were the ringleaders of the disorder.\r\nAfter trying to discover the principal culprits and failing, Keate\r\nfinally determined to punish the last remove of the Upper Fifth and\r\nthe whole of the Lower Fifth (there was then no Middle Division), whom\r\nhe considered responsible for the outbreak, by making them attend a\r\nfive-o’clock “absence.” Some ninety boys absented themselves, or rather\r\nhid behind the trees in the playing fields where this “absence” was\r\ncalled, and purposely did not answer their names. The situation was\r\ngrave, and at first it seemed likely that all of these rebels would be\r\nexpelled; eventually, however, Keate determined to be more lenient and\r\nmerely announced that he would “flog the lot.”\r\n\r\n[SN: SWISHING WHOLESALE]\r\n\r\nWhen the first batch came up for punishment in the library a scene\r\nof riot took place, and as the first boy knelt down on the block a\r\nshower of eggs smashed round Keate; in fact, after three victims had\r\nsuffered, the Headmaster’s clothes had got into such a state owing\r\nto the unsavoury missiles hurled at him, that he had to go home and\r\nchange. On his return, however, he was seen to be accompanied by a\r\nnumber of assistant masters, and owing to their aid in keeping order\r\nhe had finished swishing the whole of the ninety boys by eight o’clock\r\nthat evening.\r\n\r\nThe masters must have had their work cut out to subdue the\r\ninsubordination of such turbulent boys. Though the number of these\r\nboys was close on 500--later, from 1821 to 1827, it varied between 528\r\nand 612--at no time were there more than nine assistants, including\r\nthe Lower Master. While some of the forms in the Lower School only had\r\ntwenty or thirty boys, certain divisions in the Upper School were of\r\nquite unwieldy size. In 1820 Dr. Keate’s own division had swelled to\r\n198. He then relieved himself by creating the Middle Division of the\r\nFifth, but he continued to keep about 100 boys under his own charge at\r\nthe end of Upper School, where much disorder prevailed.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of jokes and tricks were indulged in, and about 1810 it\r\nbecame a regular practice during the Winter Half to try and put out\r\nthe candles in the two great chandeliers. There had originally been\r\nthree of these, but according to tradition the third had been broken in\r\nthe great rebellion some thirty years before. On one occasion a huge\r\nstone that was shied at the chandelier went within an inch of Keate’s\r\nhead and cracked the panel behind him. Having somehow got to know the\r\nculprit, Keate let it be known that it was a boy at a certain dame’s,\r\nat the same time declaring that the only chance the boy had was to give\r\nhimself up and trust to his leniency; otherwise he would be expelled.\r\nThe boy was George Dallas, a straightforward fellow. He immediately\r\nwent to Keate, confessed, and solemnly assured the Doctor that he had\r\nnever intended to hurt him. Keate said he believed him, but of course\r\nDallas must know that the lightest punishment he deserved was a good\r\nflogging, and that flogging he got.\r\n\r\nA large part of the boys’ time seems to have been spent devising\r\ningenious forms of annoying Keate, who sat enthroned in a spacious\r\nelevated desk, enclosed on all sides, like a pew, with two doors, one\r\non each side. One fine morning he entered Upper School, and, going to\r\nhis desk, tried to open one door, and found it was fastened. He went\r\nround, grinning, growling, and snarling, to the other side; the door\r\nthere had been screwed up too. The desk was up to the breast of a tall\r\nman and as high as Keate’s head; nevertheless, laying his hand on the\r\ntop of it, he lightly vaulted in, the feat being saluted with loud\r\ncheers and a hearty laugh. This made the Doctor more angry than ever.\r\n“I will make some of you suffer,” he said, and he did; for the next\r\nday, to the general astonishment, he called up all the boys who had\r\nbeen concerned in the screwing up and soundly flogged them. The secret\r\nof this was that Cartland, Keate’s servant, suspecting that mischief\r\nwas afoot, secreting himself between the ceiling and roof of Upper\r\nSchool, had witnessed the whole screwing-up process through the rose\r\nfrom which hung a chandelier, and carefully noted down the names of the\r\nboys concerned.\r\n\r\nAnother time a huge mastiff was put under Keate’s seat, but the Doctor\r\nwas fiercer than the dog, which ran away, frightened at his angry gaze.\r\n\r\n[SN: THIS ISN’T A GIRLS’ SCHOOL]\r\n\r\nOne of the old school, Keate had no sympathy with innovations. Though\r\nhe himself is said to have always carried an umbrella in sunshine as\r\nwell as rain, he could not bear to see a boy with one. “Wet, sir? Don’t\r\ntalk to me of weather, sir,” he would say; “you must make the best of\r\nit. This isn’t a girls’ school.” By way of paying their Headmaster\r\nout for such a remark, a party of boys once made an expedition to the\r\nneighbouring village of Upton, took down a large board inscribed in\r\nsmart gilt letters “Seminary for Young Ladies,” and fixed it up over\r\nthe great west entrance into the school-yard, where it met the Doctor’s\r\nangry eyes in the morning.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his stern disposition and rough ways Keate was highly\r\nsensitive as to ridicule, and especially disliked attempts to\r\ncaricature his appearance.\r\n\r\nWhen the informer in the celebrated case of the Cato Street\r\nconspirators--an Italian image-man by trade, and a very clever\r\none--made his appearance at Eton one day with a tray full of plaster\r\nbusts of the well-known Doctor, cocked hat and all, Keate was very much\r\nannoyed to find that his likeness was selling like wildfire amongst\r\nthe boys. There seemed to be only one way of preventing the wholesale\r\npopularisation of his dumpy figure, so, buying up what was left of the\r\nItalian’s stock, he had the figures taken to his backyard and broken up.\r\n\r\nOne or two boys had the temerity to personate Keate. Lord Douro, son of\r\nthe Iron Duke, dressed in an exact copy of the Doctor’s robes and hat,\r\nactually painted the Headmaster’s door red one night, to the amazement\r\nof a few persons who saw him.\r\n\r\nIn some verse commemorating this feat, the watchmen were supposed to be\r\nsummoned before a conclave of masters the next morning to describe what\r\nthey had seen:--\r\n\r\n                  “We both last night\r\n  Saw him--the Doctor--in his own cocked-hat,\r\n  His bands, his breeches, and his bombasine,\r\n  Paint his own door-post red.” Then great the wrath,\r\n  And great the marvel of that conclave; all\r\n  Turned their cold eyes on him, their dreaded chief,\r\n  Convicted on such damning evidence\r\n  Of this irreverend deed.\r\n\r\nKeate never discovered the culprit till years after when, as a Canon of\r\nWindsor, he was entertaining Lord Douro at dinner. The latter, speaking\r\nof Eton days, alluded to the door-painting incident, and was about to\r\nmake a full confession when Keate became so red in the face that he\r\nthought it wiser to desist.\r\n\r\n[SN: AMATEUR FLOGGING]\r\n\r\nLord Abingdon was another Eton boy noted for his mimicry of Keate;\r\nindeed, dressed up in a cocked hat and gown made expressly for him,\r\nhis disguise was so perfect that he actually went round one night and\r\ncalled “Absence” at the different dames’ houses without being detected.\r\nYears later, after a dinner-party at his home in Oxfordshire, his\r\nLordship would dress up as Keate, and, birch in hand, enact a scene\r\nin the “library” for the edification of visitors. On one of these\r\noccasions he persuaded one of them to “go down” on a block, made in\r\nexact imitation of that at Eton, which stood in the room, whilst two\r\nothers “held him down,” and the story goes that the noble host pitched\r\ninto his guest with such hearty goodwill that, when allowed to get up,\r\nthe latter was so sore in more ways than one that he called for his\r\ncarriage and drove off in a great rage.\r\n\r\nThough boys mimicked and laughed at Keate behind his back, very few had\r\nthe courage to stand up to him face to face. One of the few, however,\r\nwho did so was Charles Fox Townshend, the founder of “Pop,” who,\r\n“staying out” on account of indisposition, refused to write out and\r\ntranslate the lessons of the day, in consequence of which he was in due\r\ncourse summoned to the awful presence of the redoubtable Headmaster. In\r\nthe well-known tones of thunder which made four generations of Etonians\r\ntremble, Keate demanded the meaning of such conduct. “Don’t speak so\r\nloud, Dr. Keate,” replied Townshend, “or you will make my head ache.\r\nIf I had felt fit to write out and translate the lesson I should have\r\ngone into school, but I did not feel well enough, so I stayed out.” The\r\nfamous Headmaster, it is said, was so dumbfoundered by the readiness of\r\nthe delinquent’s reply that he let him go without any punishment.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Keate does not seem to have been an ill-natured man,\r\nfor, in spite of his occasional fits of ferocity, he was held in\r\nconsiderable esteem by a large number of the boys. They bore him no\r\nill-will for the floggings he had caused them to undergo, and, when\r\nhe left Eton in 1834, presented him with a gift testifying their\r\nappreciation of his merits. This consisted of a silver reproduction of\r\nthe Warwick Vase, on the pedestal of which was inscribed--\r\n\r\n  PRESENTED\r\n  BY THE EXISTING MEMBERS OF ETON SCHOOL\r\n  TO THE REVD. JOHN KEATE, D.D.\r\n  ON HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE HEADMASTERSHIP\r\n  JULY 30, 1834,\r\n  AS A TESTIMONY OF THE HIGH SENSE THEY ENTERTAIN\r\n  OF HIS EXQUISITE TASTE AND ACCURATE SCHOLARSHIP\r\n  SO LONG AND SO SUCCESSFULLY DEVOTED\r\n  TO THEIR IMPROVEMENT\r\n  AND OF THE FIRM YET PARENTAL EXERCISE\r\n  OF HIS AUTHORITY\r\n  WHICH HAS CONCILIATED THE AFFECTION\r\n  WHILE IT HAS COMMANDED THE RESPECT OF\r\n  HIS SCHOLARS.\r\n\r\n[SN: AN AMUSING DINNER]\r\n\r\nKeate was in Paris soon after Waterloo, and there he met a number\r\nof old pupils to whom he had administered castigations. The latter\r\ndetermined to give their former pedagogue a dinner, which in due\r\ncourse took place at the Restaurant Beauvilliers, then one of the\r\nbest dining-places in Paris, the hosts being Lord Sunderland, Lord\r\nJames Stuart, and other scions of the aristocracy. The banquet was\r\na most jovial one, and Keate did full justice to its excellence,\r\ndrinking every kind of toast, and making a most suitable speech, which\r\nappropriately ended with “Floreat Etona.” After dinner a good deal of\r\nchaff began to fly around the table, and the guest of the evening was\r\ntold of many Eton happenings which he had never heard before. For the\r\nfirst time he learnt of how two of his masters had secretly contrived\r\nto go up to London every Saturday in order to dine with Arnold and\r\nKean at Drury Lane, surreptitious suppers at the “Christopher” were\r\ndescribed, whilst tales of tandem expeditions, fights with bargees, and\r\npoaching excursions in Windsor Park reached his somewhat astonished\r\nears. The old man, however, took everything in excellent part, merely\r\nremarking that all he had heard but inspired him with regrets that\r\nhe had not flogged the assembled company as much as they appeared to\r\nhave deserved. On leaving, he thanked his hosts in a few well-turned\r\nphrases, and, parting from them on excellent terms, went home amidst\r\nloud cheers.\r\n\r\nNo doubt he owed a good part of the popularity which, in spite of his\r\nsternness, he eventually obtained to the attractions of Mrs. Keate, who\r\nwas a very fascinating woman. In the year 1814, during a match with\r\nEpsom, the Eton champion, John Harding, scored 74--an extraordinary\r\nnumber in those days, when the bowling generally beat the bat. It\r\ncalled forth a poem from a clever Colleger (“Marshal” Stone), in which\r\nwere the following lines. The Doctor saw them and was vastly amused:--\r\n\r\n  No vulgar wood was the bat of might\r\n  That swung in the grasp of Harding wight;\r\n  No vulgar maker’s name it wore,\r\n  Nor vulgar was the name it bore.\r\n  It was a bat full fair to see,\r\n  And it drove the balls right lustily;\r\n  Without a flaw, without a speck,\r\n  Smoothe as fair Hebe’s ivory neck--\r\n  It was withal so light, so neat,\r\n  The Harding called it--Mrs. Keate.\r\n\r\nWhen the allied sovereigns were present at a fête in the gardens at\r\nFrogmore in 1815, the King of Prussia is said to have gone up and\r\nkissed Mrs. Keate, making the excuse of her remarkable likeness to his\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of stories have been told of Keate’s fondness for wielding\r\nthe birch. “Remember, boys,” he is once supposed to have said, “you are\r\nto be pure in heart, or I’ll flog you till you are.”\r\n\r\nHe certainly did castigate an enormous number of Etonians, amongst\r\nthem, it is said, half the Ministers, Secretaries, Bishops, Generals,\r\nand Dukes of the earlier portion of the nineteenth century; but,\r\nnevertheless, the boys in his own division were usually punished by\r\nhaving to write out impositions, and were not flogged except for some\r\nvery flagrant offence, such as intoxication.\r\n\r\nKeate, as Headmaster of Eton, it must be remembered, was chief\r\nexecutioner, and had to do justice when a boy was complained of by any\r\nassistant master.\r\n\r\nThe school had drifted into very slack ways, and Keate, who possessed\r\na very intimate knowledge of Eton, realised that leniency would merely\r\nmake matters worse. Consequently he rather favoured drastic measures,\r\nand in spite of adverse criticism his system had a good effect. It has\r\noften been urged that it failed because the boys at times openly defied\r\nhis authority. In the earlier days of his rule this was occasionally\r\nthe case, and gross insubordination prevailed, though it never reached\r\nsuch a point as it had attained in the days of Keate’s predecessors.\r\nOn the other hand, when the stern old Headmaster handed over the reins\r\nof power to Dr. Hawtrey, the school had become quite orderly and\r\ncontrolled.\r\n\r\n[SN: NAPOLEONIC METHODS]\r\n\r\nThough, as has already been said, not much given to flogging boys\r\nunder his immediate control, he was a firm believer in the efficacy\r\nof the birch for almost every kind of offence, and was quite ready\r\nto be a ruthless executioner in order to facilitate the work of his\r\nsubordinates.\r\n\r\nHis methods were entirely Napoleonic, and when flogging boys who\r\nhad committed some unusually heinous offence, by way of making\r\nan impression on their minds as well as their bodies, he used to\r\naccompany his infliction of punishment with a number of cutting remarks\r\npunctuated by strokes of the birch: “A disgrace to your friends”\r\n(swish, swish), “Ruin to your parents” (swish, swish, swish, swish),\r\n“You’ll come to the gallows at last!” and so forth.\r\n\r\nFlogging at Eton was once described by the _Edinburgh Review_ as “an\r\noperation performed on the naked back by the Headmaster himself, who is\r\nalways a gentleman, and sometimes a high dignitary of the Church.”\r\n\r\nThe Eton boys of the past took their floggings very lightly. One of\r\nthem having, it is said, been flogged by the Headmaster by mistake for\r\nanother boy, though he knew that he had done nothing to deserve his\r\ncastigation, made no attempt whatever to escape it. When, however,\r\nthe real culprit was discovered an investigation took place, and\r\nthe flogged one’s tutor then asked, “Why did you not explain to the\r\nHeadmaster that you had never been complained of?”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” was the reply, “I have been complained of so often that\r\nonce more or less didn’t seem to matter much; besides, I thought that\r\nvery likely some master I had forgotten about might have complained of\r\nme after all.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Headmaster’s Room, showing Swishing Block and Birches.]\r\n\r\nLike many others, Fielding, a typical Englishman of a long-past age,\r\nwas in after life proud of having been flogged. Alluding to Eton in his\r\nintroduction to the thirteenth book of _Tom Jones_ he says, “Thee in\r\nthy favourite fields, where the limpid, gently rolling Thames washes\r\nthy Etonian banks, in early youth I have worshipped. To thee, at thy\r\nbirchen altar, with true Spartan devotion, I have sacrificed my blood.”\r\n\r\n[SN: REFUSING TO GO DOWN]\r\n\r\nIn later times, however, a certain number of boys have shown an\r\ninvincible dislike of being birched, and some have actually preferred\r\nto undergo expulsion rather than kneel at the block. The 4th Marquis\r\nof Ailesbury (notorious for his follies) when a boy at Eton, having\r\nbeen complained of, ran away in order to avoid a punishment to which\r\nhe declared he would never submit. This, I believe, happened twice,\r\nafter which he was at last obliged to confront the Lower Master, who\r\nadministered a certain number of strokes. On rising from the block,\r\nhowever, the irrepressible culprit made use of such language that his\r\nsojourn at Eton was at once cut short. In most cases, however, fear\r\nof expulsion has generally made those summoned to the block submit. A\r\npeculiar case was that of a boy high up in the school, and a well-known\r\nswell at athletics, who, going up to Oxford in order to matriculate,\r\ninstead of returning to Eton directly the examination was over,\r\noutstayed his leave and remained for some days amusing himself with a\r\nChristchurch friend. As a consequent result, when he did return the\r\nvoice of a praepostor was heard inquiring “Is ---- in this division?\r\nHe is to stay.” The culprit, who considered himself a grown man, at\r\nfirst stoutly declared that nothing would induce him to undergo a\r\nflogging, and it required a good deal of persuasion to make him realise\r\nthat continued resistance would entail his going away from Eton without\r\na leaving book; that is to say, practical expulsion, which is liable\r\nto injure a boy’s prospects in after life. Eventually, concluding\r\nthat it would be best to submit, he duly paid the required visit to\r\nthe library, where Dr. Balston officiated in a most sympathetic but\r\nefficient manner.\r\n\r\nIn rougher days, scapegraces used to make a flogging the occasion\r\nfor all sorts of jokes. One boy, for instance, got a friend who had\r\nsome knowledge of art to paint a rough portrait of the Headmaster on\r\nthat portion of his body which has always been associated with the\r\npunishment of youth. When the Head was about to deliver his blows he\r\nwas at first considerably taken aback by being confronted by his own\r\nlikeness upon such an unconventional background. However, he rose to\r\nthe occasion, and, with the aid of a couple of birches, completely\r\nobliterated all trace of any portrait.\r\n\r\nIn the case of big boys there is some humiliation in being flogged. A\r\ncertain captain of the boats, who had indulged too freely in champagne,\r\na very tall and powerful young man, about to be flogged by Dr. Hawtrey,\r\nbegged hard that he should receive his punishment in private, and thus\r\nescape the degradation of being observed on the block by a large crowd\r\nof boys looking through the open door. The Headmaster, however, would\r\nnot hear of this for a moment, declaring that publicity was the chief\r\npart of the punishment.\r\n\r\n[SN: SABBATH CASTIGATION]\r\n\r\nWhen Election Saturday was in full swing, a certain number of boys made\r\na point of indulging in insubordination, thinking that so close to the\r\nend of the half they would escape punishment. Some of the masters,\r\nhowever, made a point of punishing irregularities at such a time with\r\nruthless determination, and never failed to complain of any boy whom\r\nthey found to be intoxicated on Election Saturday, with the result that\r\nfloggings on the Sunday (the boys then went home on the Monday) were\r\nnot infrequent.\r\n\r\nIn order to castigate such offenders. Dr. Goodford would be ready in\r\nhis room on Sunday, where he would sometimes attend at 10.30 at night,\r\nin order to flog boys going by an early train next day. Even those\r\nleaving Eton altogether had to submit, for otherwise they would have\r\nbeen ranked as being expelled. Mr. Brinsley Richards tells of a boy,\r\nnearly six feet high, and with a moustache, who debated in agony of\r\nmind whether he would take a swishing on the night before leaving the\r\nschool. He had actually got a commission in the cavalry; his uniforms\r\nwere ordered, and he was to join his regiment in ten days; but on\r\nElection Saturday night he got uproariously drunk, was seen by a strict\r\nmaster, and put in the bill. He duly surrendered to his fate, received\r\ntwelve cuts with “two birches,” and the following day took leave of\r\nDr. Goodford on the pleasantest terms possible.\r\n\r\nDr. Goodford seems to have taken a genial view of flogging; on the\r\nmorning of one St. Andrew’s Day he swished a Scotch boy who was coming\r\nto breakfast with him, and greeted him later on at that meal with a\r\ncheery “Here we are again!”\r\n\r\nAn amusing story used to be told of a boy just about to leave Eton\r\nwho, having refused to be flogged, on his arrival at home discovered,\r\nto his horror, that his refusal to bow to constituted authority would\r\nprevent him from being allowed to enter the career upon which he had\r\nset his heart. Hoping to put matters right, he at once set out for\r\nEton, only to find on his arrival there that the Headmaster had gone\r\nto Switzerland. The ingenious youth, determined to get flogged, then\r\nsomehow procured two birches and hurried off to Geneva, only to find\r\nthat the Head had gone on to Lucerne. To that city he too followed,\r\nbut, missing the pedagogue whom he sought, again had to continue his\r\npursuit, which eventually ended in the refectory of the Monastery\r\nof Mont St. Bernard, where he eventually persuaded the Doctor to\r\nadminister the sought-for flogging amidst a circle of edified monks.\r\nThe ordeal over, the Headmaster was presented with the leaving fee,\r\nwhich was then customary, in return handing the relieved youth a\r\nleaving book in the shape of a _Guide_ to the Alps, which happened to\r\nbe the only volume procurable.\r\n\r\n[SN: A SWISHING TRADITION]\r\n\r\nDuring the writer’s school days at Eton, though flogging was in full\r\nswing, the castigations administered by Dr. Hornby--and he speaks from\r\npersonal experience--were not severe. On the other hand the Lower\r\nMaster, the Rev. J. L. Joynes, tempered the severity of his floggings\r\naccording to the offence which they were intended to correct. On one\r\noccasion the writer remembers him laying with a will into a boy who is\r\nnow a distinguished officer. The latter, however, although he received\r\nsome thirty-two strokes, administered with two birches (the first one\r\nafter a time became useless owing to the force with which it was used),\r\nnever flinched in the least, though this “real flogging” must have\r\noccasioned considerable pain, very different from the mild sensation\r\nproduced by the usual ones--often little more than a disagreeable form.\r\nAt that time the tradition still prevailed that the wielder of the rod\r\nwhilst “swishing” was not allowed to lift his hand above his shoulder.\r\nThough, as far as the writer can remember, this rule was adhered to by\r\nthe executioner, he has since heard that the sole foundation for the\r\nidea was a curious underhand motion of the right arm peculiar to Dr.\r\nHawtrey which his successors seem to have copied.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time more or less public protests have been made against\r\nthe use of the birch, which has always been an object of detestation in\r\nthe eyes of sentimentalists and professional humanitarians.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 a long correspondence appeared in the _Times_ dealing with the\r\nquestion of flogging. This arose out of the case of a boy named Morgan\r\nThomas, whose father upheld him in not submitting to be flogged.\r\n\r\nA report that in future no Upper boys will be flogged, recently called\r\nforth some controversy in the newspapers, most old Etonians being,\r\nit would appear, of opinion that the abolition of the birch and the\r\nsubstitution of other punishments, including, I believe, caning, are\r\nto be deplored. The inevitable sentimentalist, however, was of course\r\nwell to the front, declaring that “birching, or even caning, is out\r\nof date, it being much better to bring boys up to do the right thing\r\nand to avoid doing the wrong thing from a sense of honour and pledge.”\r\nApparently this gentleman was under the impression that such a method\r\nof education was a new and entire innovation!\r\n\r\nIn future it appears that amongst Upper boys, flogging is to be\r\nsupplanted by something resembling the painful process once known\r\nas a “College hiding.” At the time when Oppidan Fourth Form boys\r\nused to delight in jeering at Tugs, a good many, being captured by\r\nCollegers, were dragged off and given a number of cuts with a cane--a\r\nfar more painful ordeal, it was said, than an ordinary swishing by the\r\nHeadmaster.\r\n\r\n[SN: ABDUCTING THE BLOCK]\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 12th May 1836 three old Etonians--Lord Waterford,\r\nLord Alford, and Mr. J. H. Jesse, who had been entertaining some boys\r\nto dinner at the Christopher after a boat race against Westminster,\r\nbeing in particularly high spirits, determined to have some fun before\r\ndriving back to town. Not being able to get into Upper School (where\r\nthe block was then kept) by the door, Mr. Jesse and Lord Waterford,\r\nat considerable risk, crept along the narrow stone ledge over the\r\ncolonnade, and, entering Upper School by an open window, forced the\r\nlock of the door from within, and carried their prize off in triumph,\r\nin spite of an attempt to stop them on the part of the College\r\nwatchman. The trophy, I believe, was never returned, and is still in\r\nexistence at Curraghmore.\r\n\r\nThough the abduction of the block was considered a capital joke, a more\r\nserious view was taken of another exploit afterwards perpetrated by Mr.\r\nJesse. During Ascot week of the following year he contrived to wrench\r\nthe sceptre from the hand of the statue of the founder in School Yard\r\nand get away with it. This aroused a very strong feeling of indignation\r\namongst boys as well as masters, and the emblem of sovereignty was, in\r\nconsequence, soon restored with an apology. This is the only time that\r\nthe bronze effigy of Henry VI., erected by Provost Godolphin in the\r\nearly years of the eighteenth century, has ever been molested.\r\n\r\nThe block in Lower School has also had its adventures. In or about 1863\r\na King’s scholar, Lewis by name, during some disturbance abstracted\r\nit--according to tradition to save it from being destroyed during\r\nsome disorder. Whatever may have been the truth of the matter, he kept\r\nit, and when, a short time later, he obtained a Postmastership at\r\nMerton, took it away to Oxford with the rest of his belongings. On his\r\ndeath this block passed into the possession of Dr. Lewis, who lived\r\nin Glamorganshire; and when this gentleman died, Mr. F. T. Bircham,\r\nobtaining it from his widow, handed it back to the Headmaster of Eton\r\non May 3, 1890.\r\n\r\nThe venerable, though somewhat gruesome relic in question is of some\r\nhistorical interest, for on it are carved a number of names, amongst\r\nthem Milman, Lonsdale, Routh, Wellesley, and H. Hall (1773). It is to\r\nbe hoped that, should Lower boys ever cease to need the discipline of\r\nthe birch, this relic of sterner days will be kept in Lower School,\r\nwith the old-world appearance of which it so well accords.\r\n\r\nThe present block, the one used in the library, was, I believe,\r\nabducted some three or four years ago, two boys having carried out\r\nthe extraordinary feat of climbing into Upper School through a window\r\nand smuggling out the awesome relic of torture, which they eventually\r\nsent to the authorities of the British Museum, who returned it to the\r\nauthorities of the school.\r\n\r\n[SN: THE OFFICIAL BIRCHMAKER]\r\n\r\nAn important functionary in connection with Eton castigations has\r\nalways been the Headmaster’s servant, rod-making being one of his\r\ntraditional functions. Under Keate the office was held by Cartland,\r\nopprobriously nicknamed “Sly” by Collegers, who abhorred him. In Dr.\r\nHawtrey’s day came Finmore, who, after the former’s death, continued in\r\noffice as servant to Dr. Goodford. Part of the duties of the office lay\r\nin seeing that there were always at least half a dozen new rods in the\r\ncupboard of the “library,” Dr. Goodford being apt to get very angry if\r\nan execution had to be adjourned for want of birches. A dozen new rods\r\nwere supposed to be at hand in the cupboard every morning, for there\r\nwas no calculating the number of floggings that might be inflicted in a\r\nday. Finmore used to make the rods at his own house, with the help of\r\nhis wife, and brought them to the library quietly after Lock Up, or in\r\nthe morning before early school. Sometimes, however, when the supply of\r\nrods ran short Finmore had to bring in fresh birches in the middle of\r\nthe day, which, for several reasons, was a somewhat hazardous task.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, after three o’clock school, when there were only three\r\nbirches available, six boys were up to be flogged. The Head flogged\r\nthree of the culprits and adjourned the others till six o’clock, at\r\nthe same time ordering the Sixth Form praepostor to be sure and tell\r\nFinmore that the cupboard must be replenished before six. Some Lower\r\nboys, however, getting wind of this, and hearing that Finmore was bound\r\nto come to the library between four and five, lay in wait for him,\r\nand in due course espied him hovering near the top of Keate’s Lane,\r\nempty-handed, but walking suspiciously near to a grocer’s cart making\r\nits way towards Weston’s Yard. Suddenly a shout was raised, and the\r\ncrowd of boys, scampering off, stopped the cart just as it was turning\r\ninto the yard, surrounded it yelling, and extracted from it six new\r\nbirches wrapped in a cloth. Finmore, breathless and almost choking with\r\nemotion, vainly tried to save his rods. Half a dozen boys, however,\r\nsoon ran off with one apiece, the unfortunate official being left to\r\nbewail his evil fate. In Dr. Hornby’s day the custodian of the birches\r\nwas White, a spruce, neatly-dressed figure whom many old Etonians will\r\nstill remember.\r\n\r\nHe it was who, in consideration of a fee of a guinea, saw that\r\nthe names of boys leaving Eton were cut in Upper School. For a\r\nconsideration he would also supply birches tied up with blue ribbon to\r\nany one desirous of carrying away such grim mementoes.\r\n\r\nWhilst the block, for Lower boys at least, remains one of the features\r\nof Eton, fighting, once a characteristic institution of the school, has\r\nlong disappeared, having seemingly fallen out of favour in the late\r\nfifties of the last century.\r\n\r\nIn the period preceding Waterloo the combats were fierce and frequent;\r\nthere was one nearly every day, and so determined were the Etonians of\r\nthat era that there is a case on record of two boys rising at six in\r\nthe morning to begin the conflict, and sparring away for three hours!\r\n\r\n[SN: “SIXPENNY CORNER”]\r\n\r\nWhilst the Oppidans, according to immemorial custom, settled their\r\ndifferences in “Sixpenny Corner,” the Collegers fought their battles\r\nin Long Chamber. An unwritten code decreed that when a King’s scholar\r\nwished to fight he must ask permission of the Captain of the school to\r\nbe allowed to do so after Lock Up, and this, as may be imagined, was\r\nnever refused. About nine o’clock a fairly spacious ring was formed\r\njust below the second fireplace, boys standing on bedsteads placed\r\naround, holding candles, which enabled the combatants to see one\r\nanother. It would appear that in the old fighting days the Collegers\r\nfought fewer battles than the Oppidans,--the fights of the former were\r\nusually short and sharp, the boys being so well acquainted with each\r\nother’s strength and powers, that after a round or two the fight was\r\ndiscontinued and the quarrel made up.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned encounters in “Sixpenny Corner,” which seem to have\r\nbeen conducted in a more or less formal style, were, of course, most\r\nfrequent in the days when the Prize Ring occupied a prominent place\r\namongst sports patronised by men of fashion.\r\n\r\nYoung Corinthians who had only just left school no doubt indoctrinated\r\nfriends still at Eton with enthusiasm for the knights of the fist, and\r\ncaused them to regard pugilism as a science worthy of attention.\r\n\r\nA curious piece of etiquette in connection with fighting was, that if a\r\nLower boy wanted to fight one in the Upper School, he could do so only\r\nafter having obtained leave from the Captain of the school.\r\n\r\nAt one time Eton battles were fought with hats on, which caused the\r\nWestminster boys to declare that, owing to the damage inflicted upon\r\nknuckles by the hat brims, most Etonian encounters were not of a\r\nserious kind.\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Form and Upper boys were expected to see that fair-play was\r\nenforced, and that when one combatant was clearly overmatched and\r\nplainly worsted, a reconciliation took place. Both were made to shake\r\nhands, and having vented their ill-feeling in a manly and honourable\r\nway, they were afterwards often found to be the best of friends.\r\n\r\nA great battle at the beginning of the nineteenth century was the fight\r\nbetween Calthorp and Forster.\r\n\r\n“Sixpenny Corner,” at the angle where the wall game now takes place,\r\nwas the traditional scene of battle, and here the great Duke of\r\nWellington, as little Arthur Wellesley, fought Bobus Smith, brother of\r\nSydney Smith, the fight, according to all accounts, ending in a draw.\r\n\r\nA redoubtable pugilist was Stratford de Redcliffe, who emerged victor\r\nfrom many a tough contest. Less successful was Shelley, who is said to\r\nhave received a severe thrashing from little Sir Thomas Styles. During\r\nanother fight the youthful poet attracted a good deal of attention\r\nby refusing to rest on the knee of his second, preferring to stride\r\nround the ring quoting Homer! No wonder the boys used to call him “mad\r\nShelley”! It must be remembered, however, that he was a constant butt\r\nfor a large portion of the school. “My belief,” said Dr. Hawtrey, “is\r\nthat what Shelley had to endure at Eton made him a perfect devil.”\r\n\r\n[SN: THRASHING A LIFEGUARDSMAN]\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the nineteenth century a gigantic boy named Wyvill\r\nbecame celebrated for his fistic powers. He once gave a Lifeguardsman\r\na severe thrashing in Windsor, and the soldier was so much upset that\r\nhe went to the Headmaster, Dr. Goodall, to complain of his mauling.\r\nThe latter, who hated to have to take notice of any Eton escapade,\r\nsaid, “My good fellow, how can you expect me to know what boy it was?”\r\n“Boy!” he answered with a country accent; “he is the biggest mun in the\r\ntuttens,” or two towns. And so Wyvill ever after went by the name of\r\n“the biggest mun in the tuttens.”\r\n\r\nWhen a challenge had been given and accepted, the details of the\r\nforthcoming fight were arranged by friends, after which the combatants\r\njust walked into the playing fields with their seconds, stripped off\r\ntheir jackets, and went to work, the boys forming a ring, no other\r\nformalities being observed--hardly even a sponge or a watch. When a\r\nminute was supposed to have elapsed, one got up from his second’s\r\nknee and said, “Come on.” A little hot blood flowed, and as soon as\r\neither felt he had enough he had only to say so. Drawn battles were\r\nnot common or popular, boys preferring to have matters brought to an\r\nissue. There was the most perfect fair-play, and if things were carried\r\nat all too far, interference was pretty sure to be at hand, though\r\nnot otherwise. When, during a fight, Keate just showed himself at the\r\ncorner of the playing fields, the hint was immediately taken.\r\n\r\nFights between Lower boys, it should be added, were deemed of small\r\naccount, but a battle between two well-known Uppers always attracted a\r\nlarge crowd.\r\n\r\nThe most tragic fight which ever took place at Eton was a fierce\r\nbattle between a small boy named Ashley Cooper and a big one named\r\nWood (afterwards Sir A. Wood). For three hours the unequal combat was\r\ncarried on, till, in the last round before Lock Up, the former fell\r\nsenseless and had to be carried to his tutor’s house, where, half an\r\nhour later, he expired. His death, however, seems to have been caused\r\nby a quantity of brandy given him by his elder brother, rather than by\r\nthe effects of the fight. Also, had medical attendance been procured,\r\nCooper’s life would probably have been saved. After, however, he had\r\nbeen carried senseless to his house, every effort was made to conceal\r\nthe state in which he was in, gloves being placed upon his hands so\r\nthat their dreadful condition might not be visible. The boy died the\r\nsame night.\r\n\r\nThe sequel of the encounter was a trial at Aylesbury, where, on March\r\n9, 1825, Charles Alexander Wood, seventeen years old, was charged\r\nbefore Mr. Justice Gazelee with the manslaughter of the Hon. Francis\r\nAshley Cooper, after a quarrel in the Eton playing fields. The fight,\r\nit was proved, had been conducted in the strictest accordance with the\r\nrules of the Prize Ring, which at that time still flourished. No less\r\nthan sixty rounds were shown to have been fought with the fiercest\r\ndetermination--the time occupied, two hours. Cooper, who was two years\r\nyounger than his antagonist, had been given nearly a pint of brandy to\r\nenable him to continue the struggle against a more powerful opponent.\r\nWood was, of course, acquitted; besides which, Cooper’s brother\r\nentirely exonerated him, taking all the blame on himself for having\r\nadministered the brandy.\r\n\r\n[SN: AN ILLEGIBLE INSCRIPTION]\r\n\r\nThis battle--the most serious schoolboy fight which ever took\r\nplace--probably had some effect in decreasing the popularity of fistic\r\nencounters. It certainly created a great sensation, being, according\r\nto some, commemorated by an inscription (now illegible) upon the white\r\nstone let into the wall at Sixpenny Corner. The late Mr. Brownlow\r\nNorth, Lord Kintore tells me, declared that he had been a second at the\r\nfight, and remembered the insertion of the stone as a memorial.\r\n\r\nThe Gasworks eventually superseded “Sixpenny” as a fistic arena, though\r\nthe time-honoured phrase, “Will you fight me in ‘Sixpenny’?” still\r\nremained the recognised form of challenge.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 fighting was already beginning to go out of fashion. In 1865,\r\nwhile the Public Schools Commissioners were sitting, they examined\r\na Lower boy touching fights, and asked him if he had any theory to\r\nexplain why regular stand-up fights had become so rare? The boy\r\nanswered, “Oh! I suppose it’s because the fellows funk each other.”\r\n\r\nThe real reason of the disappearance of fighting was that it came to\r\nbe thought bad form, and consequently no longer received any patronage\r\nfrom boys who were the swells of the school. Once it began to be\r\nconsidered “scuggish,” the fate of Eton pugilism was sealed, and though\r\ninformal encounters occasionally occur--there was a determined battle\r\nnear the railway arches in 1893--within the last forty years fighting\r\nhas become a thing of the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV “CADS,” AND THE “CHRISTOPHER”\r\n\r\n\r\nThough a century or so ago fights and floggings were ordinary incidents\r\nof school life, a large number of boys contrived to make time pass\r\nvery pleasantly indeed. At that time the sporting Etonian was quite a\r\nrecognised type.\r\n\r\nThe following sketch, from the _Sporting Magazine_, of Etonian ways\r\nin 1799, whilst, of course, a somewhat exaggerated caricature, was\r\nevidently based upon a very solid substratum of truth:--\r\n\r\n  _Sunday._--Not well--church a bore--headache increased by bell--sent\r\n  an excuse--up at ten--dressed by eleven--sipped tea in a back\r\n  room--read half a page of _Sporting Magazine_--d--d good--much\r\n  pleased with the Oxonian’s diary--walked to Castle--prayers with\r\n  Bluster--rowed the cut of Bluster’s coat--bad taylor--smoked a\r\n  Cockney, and his blue silks--kicked his wig in the kennel--teach the\r\n  dog good manners--came down to dinner--no appetite--Dame’s hash,\r\n  like shoe-leather--drank wine at the Christopher--bad port--waiter,\r\n  jawed--shoved him out--during evening church, finished Oxonian\r\n  diary--tight cock--wish I knew him--drank tea at Coker’s--bad\r\n  company--Spanker and self adjourned to Cloisters--good fun--returned\r\n  to Dame’s--sat with Pink--bad supper--four beer--rowed the\r\n  maids--picked teeth--went to bed.\r\n\r\n  _Monday._--Waked at eight--keep up pretence of headache--up\r\n  at ten--dressed by eleven--Smith’s burgamot, not so good as\r\n  usual--breakfast--at one, walked to billiards--no one there--beat the\r\n  marker.--Mem. Not go to Huddlestone’s again--came down--dinner better\r\n  than usual--new cook--dull evening--went to bed early.\r\n\r\n  _Tuesday._--Sham leave--hunted with King’s hounds--Steven’s blood\r\n  lame--d--d bore--forced to ride the grey--new boots--bad leather--cut\r\n  Webb for the future, and employ Atkins--Alderman S----y, wretched\r\n  quiz--his chesnut horse broke down--let him fall into a ditch--hat\r\n  and wig, both lost--looked like a bumble bee in a tar pot--good\r\n  hunt--hard riding--go along--keep moving.--Mem. Always row the\r\n  Alderman and not forget to cram Pink--came home tired--sandwiches and\r\n  wine at the White Hart--merry evening--got drunk--Dame jawed.\r\n\r\n  _Wednesday._--Whole school day--very dull--walked to Steven’s--Grey,\r\n  knocked up--pain in my side--evening, cards, etc.--much\r\n  better--betting in my favour--beat Dashall at cribbage--won nine\r\n  shillings--lucky dog--went to bed in good spirits.\r\n\r\nElaborate hoaxes were common at the commencement of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. A young Etonian acquired a good deal of notoriety by sending\r\nthe town-crier, whom he had fee’d for the purpose, to announce a\r\ngeneral illumination in honour of the battle of Vittoria. It created\r\nquite a sensation in both Windsor and Eton; and although no one knew\r\nfrom whence the orders came, G. R.’s and coloured lamps in abundance\r\nwere displayed in the windows of many of the houses. A meeting of the\r\nmagistrates was hastily summoned, and the hoax was discovered. The\r\nwriting gave a clue to the culprit, who in due course underwent the\r\npunishment usual in such cases.\r\n\r\n[SN: SPORTING BOYS]\r\n\r\nLicense which would be inconceivable at the present day\r\nprevailed--bull-baiting on Batchelor’s Acre and cock-fighting in\r\nBedford’s Yard being quite ordinary amusements. Small wonder that at\r\none time strong complaint was made as to the habits of the school.\r\nAscot Races were regularly attended by many of the older boys. Hunting\r\nand tandem-driving were not uncommon. Henry Matthews, author of the\r\n_Diary of an Invalid_, a very clever and eccentric boy, drove a tandem\r\nright through Eton and Windsor; a later rival, however, of Keate’s\r\nday, when James Clegg of Windsor provided sporting boys with horses\r\nand traps, drove one through the school-yard. Billiards continued to\r\nbe very popular, not only with the boys but with their Masters, who\r\nclaimed “first turn” at the tables.\r\n\r\nCopying the London bucks, Upper boys would sally out on dark nights\r\nand wrench bell-pulls and knockers from the dames’ houses, or make\r\nhay in the poultry-yard of old Pocock, the farmer at the corner of\r\n“Cut-throat” Lane, as Datchet Lane was then sometimes called.\r\n\r\nPoaching expeditions in Windsor Park were quite common. On one occasion\r\nyoung Lord Baltimore and a companion, when out after game, were pursued\r\nby a Master. The young Peer, however, escaped, but eventually gave\r\nhimself up in order to save his friend (who had refused to divulge his\r\nassociate’s name) from expulsion.\r\n\r\nGuns could then be hired for the purpose of shooting swallows and\r\nswifts on the Brocas bank, where a number of sporting “cads,” then\r\nknown as “Private Tutors,” assisted in all sorts of sprees, providing\r\ndogs, fishing-tackle, badgers, ferrets, rats, fighting dogs, horses,\r\nand even, it is said, bulls for baiting.\r\n\r\nEighty or ninety years ago a dozen or more of such men were constantly\r\nto be seen loitering in front of the College every morning, making\r\ntheir arrangements with their pupils, the Oppidans, for a day’s sport,\r\nto commence the moment school was over. At one time they used actually\r\nto occupy a seat on the low wall in front of the College, but Dr. Keate\r\ninterfered to expel the assemblage; nevertheless, they continued to\r\ncarry on their intercourse with the boys, and walked about watching\r\ntheir opportunity for communication.\r\n\r\nA number supplied cats for hunts upon the Brocas, while a number\r\norganised duck hunts, a duck being put into the river and hunted with\r\nconsiderable brutality. A few, however, escaped by diving and tiring\r\nthe dogs out.\r\n\r\nSome of these men were strange characters, who showed great\r\nrecklessness when times were bad, and would be ready to let boys have a\r\nshot at them at a distance of seventy-five yards or so, three shillings\r\na shot being the accepted price.\r\n\r\n[SN: “PICKY POWELL”]\r\n\r\nOthers would jump from the middle of Windsor Bridge for a\r\nconsideration. The stake-holder on such occasions was usually Jem\r\nPowell, known as “Picky” Powell, who about 1824 was celebrated in\r\nEton for his “quart of sovereigns,” it being his invariable practice\r\nwhen elated--for Jem, needless to say, was no teetotaller--to march up\r\nand down in front of his house with a silver-gilt tankard filled with\r\nhis savings, all in gold.\r\n\r\nThis Picky Powell would appear to be identical with the individual\r\nwho, years later, enjoyed a considerable reputation as having been\r\nprofessional bowler to the school. During the annual matches with\r\nHarrow at Lord’s, Picky usually made a point of having an informal\r\nsparring match with a well-known Harrow “cad,” Billy Warner by name,\r\nwho, like his bigger antagonist, was supposed to have been a notable\r\ncricketer in his youth. A favourite taunt of Picky’s which usually\r\ninaugurated hostilities was, “All the good I sees in ‘Arrow’ is that\r\nyou can see Eton from it if ye go up into the churchyard.”\r\n\r\nThe last appearance of Powell at Lord’s appears to have been in 1858,\r\nwhen, as usual, he croaked defiance at his hereditary foe. On this\r\noccasion, however, no sparring was permitted, but Picky reaped a rich\r\nharvest of silver, bestowed upon him by old Etonians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jack Hall, Fisherman of Eton. _Print lent by G.\r\nCulliford, Esq._]\r\n\r\nA well-known character of the past on the Brocas was Jack Hall,\r\nnicknamed “Foxy Hall,” by all accounts the most worthy of Eton\r\n“cads,” and celebrated as an expert angler. His portrait, taken from\r\nan old print, is here reproduced. Others were Joe Cannon, Fish,\r\n“Shampo Carter” (who taught swimming in 1824 with the Headmaster’s\r\npermission), Jack Garraway, and the Anti-Catholic Jim Miller,\r\nthe patriarch of “cads,” who signed a petition against Catholic\r\nEmancipation “upon principle.” “For,” he said, “when the d----d rogues\r\nburnt Cranmer and Ridley, they never paid for the fagots--unprincipled\r\nvarmints!” A great deal of license was accorded to these wall loungers,\r\nmost of whom were ready to abet the boys in every kind of mischief.\r\n\r\nOne of the most noted sporting “cads” was old Jimmy Flowers, whose\r\nspeciality was badger-baiting on the Brocas, his stock-in-trade\r\nconsisting of a badger in a sack and an old tub with one end knocked\r\nout. Dogs used to be put into the tub to fetch the badger out, the\r\ncharge being sixpence, unless the fight with the badger lasted very\r\nlong, when Old Jimmy used to exact a further fee. When the fun, if it\r\ncan be called fun, had lasted long enough, the badger, whose opinion\r\nof the proceedings it would have been interesting to have heard, was\r\nreplaced in the sack, and with a cheery “Good day, gentlemen, your dogs\r\nhave had good sport,” Jimmy would walk away.\r\n\r\nAnother well-known character in the beginning of the nineteenth century\r\nwas Old Matty Groves, who was much teased by the boys on account of\r\nhis rooted antipathy to clergymen, whom he used to denounce as the\r\n“black slugs” of the country. He it was who led the procession which\r\nevery seven years went round to beat the Eton boundary, and nailed up\r\na cross of old iron hoops on a venerable willow near the grounds of\r\nBlack Potts, where in after years Dr. Hornby had a retreat. Old Matty\r\nwas very unconventional in his ways, and had been known in flood-time,\r\nwhen the stream was running strong, to plunge into it in his clothes at\r\nBarnes Pool Bridge and swim across to his cottage.\r\n\r\n[SN: FLOODS]\r\n\r\nFloods have always been liable to occur at Eton, though, for the most\r\npart, they have generally subsided before becoming serious. In 1809,\r\nhowever, there was a tremendous one, which carried away six of the\r\ncentral arches of the old “Fifteen Arch” Bridge on the Slough Road that\r\nspans the stream which feeds Fellows’ Pond. For five days the only\r\ncommunication with some of the boarding-houses was by boats and carts,\r\nand the school had practically a week’s holiday. The boys lay in bed\r\ntill a late hour, and when they got up it was to play cards and get\r\ninto other mischief. Driving down Eton Street in carts, with the risk\r\nof getting spilt into the water, was one of their favourite amusements.\r\n\r\nTwo subsequent floods have been almost, if not quite, as serious--one\r\nin 1852, the year that the Duke of Wellington died, and one in 1894,\r\nwhen all the boys had to be sent home. Many of the Masters, however,\r\nremained behind, and spent their time in rescuing people in the\r\nsurrounding country and supplying them with food.\r\n\r\n[SN: SPANKIE]\r\n\r\nThough in 1829, owing to the adoption of stern measures, the “Private\r\nTutors” under whose auspices many a boy had shot his first moor-hen\r\nand laid his first eel-pot were expelled from the College precincts,\r\nthe “sock cads” continued to haunt the “wall” for many years later.\r\nThe most celebrated of these, of course, was the famous Spankie, who\r\nflourished about half a century ago. Spankie never failed to appear in\r\nthe playing fields during summer, whilst in winter he was more or less\r\nof a fixture at the wall. Of him was written, one summer’s day when the\r\ncricket was getting slow in Upper Club, the line, “Totaque tartiferis\r\nSpancheia fervet ahenis.” A ridiculous and unfounded school tradition\r\ndeclared that he was a son of a General le Marchant, and he was often\r\nplayfully apostrophised by that name.\r\n\r\nThe principal characteristics of this worthy, besides a rubicund\r\ncountenance, a long blue frock coat, and an old top hat (invariably\r\nworn on one side of his head), were extreme oiliness of manner,\r\ncombined with an unlimited amount of cheek. His wares, chiefly tartlets\r\nof all sorts, were contained in a sort of huge tin can supported on\r\nlegs. At the proper season he also sold pots of flowers.\r\n\r\nSpankie was imbued with a tremendous veneration for the aristocracy,\r\nand prided himself upon his acquaintance with the history of every\r\nnoble family in England. Rumour, indeed, declared that most of his\r\ntime out of sock-selling hours was devoted to studying the _Peerage_\r\nand the _Landed Gentry_, both of which works he was supposed to know\r\npretty well by heart. This, no doubt, was a schoolboy exaggeration,\r\nbut certain it was that Spankie had a curious and not inaccurate\r\nknowledge of the noble houses whose youthful scions furnished him\r\nwith a comfortable income. It was a way of his to address the sons of\r\ndistinguished people by their fathers’ names, whilst, it should be\r\nadded, often fleecing them in a merciless manner, for, sad to tell,\r\nhis methods were not above suspicion. A favourite trick was carefully\r\nto array a few very fine strawberries or cherries at the top of a\r\npottle after filling up the lower portion with very inferior fruit; as,\r\nhowever, he made a practice of giving liberal tick, little was ever\r\nsaid about this. He made quite a comfortable fortune out of the Eton\r\nboys, as was realised when it became known that he had contributed no\r\nless than £50 to the fund for building a new parish church in the High\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\nBy the lower members of the school Spankie was looked up to as a\r\nperfect oracle, for he seemed to know everything, could predict who\r\nwould be members of the Eleven or Eight, and tell the name and history\r\nof the latest comer, stringing on to it, if necessary, a list of all\r\nhis relations, with their various achievements. One of this celebrated\r\nsock cad’s chief peculiarities was that he could scarcely utter three\r\nconsecutive words without a “sir” coming at the end of them; and it was\r\nmarvellous how he could change them as easily as he did into “my lord”\r\nwhen any of the young aristocracy came up to him.\r\n\r\nIn addition to entertaining an unlimited respect for the British\r\naristocracy, Spankie nurtured a deep contempt for trade, as the small\r\nsons of rich manufacturers, especially when they had failed to meet\r\ntheir liabilities, frequently had reason to know. “Good morning,\r\nsar,” Spankie would say to a scion of some house not unconnected\r\nwith “cotton,” who might be rather backward in settling his debts.\r\n“Glad to see you back, sar. Bought some pocket-handkerchiefs at your\r\nestablishment in the vacation, sar; cheap enough, only six shillings a\r\ndozen; but I don’t find them wash well, sar.”\r\n\r\nAccording to some, Spankie made quite a comfortable little sum by\r\nsupplying the names of visitors to Eton to the London papers, whilst\r\nrumour also declared that on occasion the College authorities employed\r\nhim to trace and recapture runaways.\r\n\r\n[SN: SOCK CADS]\r\n\r\nOne of Spankie’s best-known predecessors was a sock cad named Charley\r\nPass, who was to be seen daily stationed at the wall near the gateway\r\nwith a curious tin apparatus containing pies, kept hot by a charcoal\r\nbrazier. He had a peculiar cry, somewhat resembling that of the long\r\nobsolete pieman. “Ham and Veal; Mutton Eel,” he would call out as the\r\nboys were emerging from school. Young Collegers who knew his ways would\r\ndrive him to fury by shouting “and dog--that’s what I want.” Trotman\r\nwith his barrow was also a familiar figure in the “forties.”\r\n\r\nAnother sock cad who had some pretensions to being a rival to Spankie\r\nwas a hook-nosed little man known as Levi, the Jew. Spankie and he\r\nconstantly indulged in verbal sparring, in which the Hebrew, who was a\r\nman of few words, as a rule got much the worst of it. On one occasion\r\nthis so infuriated Levi that a battle royal ensued. Goaded to frenzy\r\nby some taunt of Spankie’s, Levi challenged him to come on, and an\r\nanimated tussle ensued, speedily ended only by the appearance of one of\r\nthe Masters, who, separating the combatants, thoroughly frightened both\r\nby declaring that he had a good mind to see that the two of them should\r\nbe prevented from frequenting the neighbourhood of the wall. The idea\r\nof this thoroughly cowed even the irrepressible Spankie, and henceforth\r\nLevi and he lived at peace.\r\n\r\nA less assertive character than either of the two worthies mentioned\r\nabove was old Brion or Bryant, a white-headed sock cad whose invariable\r\ncostume was a grey coat. According to current report he had no less\r\nthan twenty-one children. His speciality lay in purveying small glasses\r\nof cherry jam dashed with cream at fourpence, which must have yielded\r\nhim a good profit.\r\n\r\nBryant outdid the other sock cads in owning a huge barrow, which every\r\nday was wheeled to the wall. A portly, good-natured man, he was not\r\nas astute as Spankie, and consequently was frequently imposed upon by\r\nhis young customers. Sometimes, however, he showed a keen aptitude for\r\nbusiness. When, for instance, a little boy complained that he had\r\ngiven him but a small pennyworth of preserve in his jam-bun, he would\r\nevince the amiability of his intentions by saying, “I was afraid it\r\nmight disagree with you, sir.”\r\n\r\nAnother well-known character in the sixties of the last century was an\r\nold lady known as “Missis,” who sat by the entrance to the school-yard\r\nselling apples, nuts, bullfinches, and dormice.\r\n\r\nDuring more recent years there have been no sock cads of such\r\nmarked individuality as those mentioned above, nor do they enjoy\r\nthe privileges which were accorded to their predecessors of a more\r\neasy-going age, their appearance at the wall being discouraged. Some,\r\nhowever, still ply their trade in the playing fields and at the\r\nbathing-places. The most original of the modern school was “Hoppie.”\r\nEvery portion of this worthy’s costume, according to his own account,\r\nhad belonged to some prominent old Etonian. During the summer half\r\nhe was a constant frequenter of “Upper Hope,” where perhaps he still\r\nparades “the Duke of Wellington’s coat” and “Lord Roberts’ trousers” as\r\nof yore.\r\n\r\nThirty years ago there were several individuals known as “Jobey”--a\r\nname taken from almost the last of the old Eton characters, “Jobey\r\nJoel,” who died not very long ago. He remembered the school when far\r\nmore latitude was allowed the boys, and had many a queer tale to tell\r\nof that vanished institution, the Christopher, now but a fading memory\r\nin the minds of a few.\r\n\r\n[SN: THE CHRISTOPHER]\r\n\r\nThe ancient hostelry in question would seem to have flourished as\r\nlong ago as the sixteenth century. The mention of a certain Nicholas\r\nWilliams lodging “ad signum Christoferi” occurs in the Eton Audit Book\r\nfor 1523. The old inn served as a refuge to the “ever memorable” Eton\r\nFellow, John Hales, who for his unwavering allegiance to the King was\r\ndeprived of his fellowship.\r\n\r\nIn later days the Christopher became a great social centre of local\r\nlife. All the coaches stopped at its door, and before Dr. Hawtrey\r\nabolished the Eton Market there was a weekly ordinary for farmers, and\r\noccasionally a hunt dinner, with noise enough to have driven the Muses\r\nback to Greece. Its rooms were in great request with parents come down\r\nto see their promising or unpromising offspring, whilst old Etonians\r\nrevisiting Eton made the old place their headquarters as a matter of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n“Lord! how great I used to think anybody just landed at the\r\nChristopher!” wrote Horace Walpole when he returned to his old school\r\nin 1746. The place recalled many memories of boyhood to his mind, and\r\nhe declared that he felt “just like Noah, with all sorts of queer feels\r\nabout him.”\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole had passed some happy days at Eton, where one of his\r\ngreatest friends was the studious and quiet Gray, who read Virgil for\r\namusement out of school. The writer of the famous letters had a great\r\naffection for Eton, and Cambridge, as he said, seemed a wilderness to\r\nhim as compared with the “dear scene” he had left. In after life the\r\nrecollection of his school-days was ever keen. When, for instance, he\r\nfirst saw a balloon he declared that he was at once reminded of an Eton\r\nfootball. Though fond of reading, like many other Eton boys, the writer\r\nof the famous letters showed little enthusiasm for the school work.\r\n\r\n  “I remember,” says he, “when I was at Eton, and Mr. Bland had set me\r\n  on an extraordinary task, I used sometimes to pique myself upon not\r\n  getting it, because it was not immediately my school business. What!\r\n  learn more than I was absolutely forced to learn! I felt the weight\r\n  of learning that, for I was a blockhead, and pushed above my parts.”\r\n\r\nSpending much of his time in the playing fields musing, he retained the\r\nrecollection all his life.\r\n\r\n  “No old maid’s gown,” said he, “though it had been tormented into all\r\n  the fashions from King James to King George, ever underwent so many\r\n  transformations as these poor plains have in my idea. At first I was\r\n  contented with tending a visionary flock and sighing some pastoral\r\n  name to the echo of the cascade under the bridge. As I got further\r\n  into Virgil and Clelia, I found myself transported from Arcadia to\r\n  the garden of Italy; and saw Windsor Castle in no other view than the\r\n  Capitoli immobile saxum.”\r\n\r\nIn Horace Walpole’s day Kendall, himself an old Etonian, presided over\r\nthe Christopher. Later came Garraway and Jack Knight.\r\n\r\nThe rattling of coach wheels over the cobblestones outside the old inn\r\nwas a never-failing source of excitement and interest to the boys. Most\r\nof them knew the drivers, whom they delighted to hail with volleys of\r\nchaff.\r\n\r\n[SN: STAGE COACHMEN]\r\n\r\nA famous Eton stage coachman was Jack Bowes of the “Original,” which\r\nstarted from the Bolt in Tun, Fleet Street, and called at Hatchett’s\r\nin Piccadilly. Often on his arrival at the Christopher, Bowes would be\r\nwelcomed with a brisk fusillade fired by boys from pea-shooters. He had\r\nbeen a soldier and seen a good deal of service, and was a most popular\r\ncharacter with all sorts of people, and especially with the relatives\r\nand fathers of Eton boys; for, like Moody, another Eton coachman, Bowes\r\nknew all that there was to be known about the College and its ways.\r\nHe was a kindly man, and reassured many a small boy fresh from home\r\nand nervous as to the ordeal awaiting him when he reached the great\r\npublic school. One idea which not a few new boys had firmly implanted\r\nupon their minds was that by way of initiation into the privilege of\r\nbecoming an Etonian they would be pitched off Windsor Bridge and made\r\nto struggle for their life. There was, of course, not the slightest\r\nfoundation for such an idea, which no doubt arose because in former\r\ndays it was no very uncommon thing for Etonians, anxious to show their\r\npowers as swimmers, to take a header from the Bridge into the Thames\r\nbeneath. Many indeed were experts at such feats.\r\n\r\nLess kindly than Bowes were some of the hangers-on who gained a\r\nlivelihood by lounging about the White Horse Cellar in Piccadilly,\r\nwhich was always a great rendezvous for all sorts of queer characters,\r\nitinerant orange-vendors and others, who flocked round the coaches\r\nhoping to make a more or less honest penny. Amongst these was one\r\nwell-known individual who gained a livelihood by doing odd jobs in the\r\nway of carrying parcels and helping with luggage. He was especially\r\nactive on days when the Eton boys were returning to school, and as\r\nhe took some little fellow’s trunk to hoist it on to the coach would\r\ncheerfully impart the information that “he had never seen such a fine\r\nload of birch as had gone down the day before.”\r\n\r\n“Bishop”--a particular kind of punch--and Bulstrode ale were the two\r\nbeverages for which the Christopher was famous. Garraway brought the\r\nlatter into fashion, and a huge amount of it was drunk, and though\r\nGarraway had only purchased a small stock of this famous old ale at the\r\nsale at Bulstrode, by some miraculous process it continued to be served\r\nout in plentiful quantities ever after. This became a standing joke\r\nagainst mine host of the Christopher, who afterwards made a speciality\r\nof an excellent tap, which he called the Queen’s, from some he had\r\npurchased at Windsor. This was sold in small quarts, at a shilling per\r\njug.\r\n\r\n[SN: THE OPPIDANS’ CLUB]\r\n\r\nThe old place was often quite full of undergraduates, young officers,\r\nand bucks come down to take a look at the school they had so recently\r\nleft, and some of these young men, especially those from Oxford (where\r\nformerly so many Etonians went on account of its being the headquarters\r\nof classical learning) formed what was known as the “Oppidans’ Club.”\r\nThe main object of this convivial association, which met in one of the\r\ncellars, next to consuming large quantities of port, was to sally out\r\nafter nightfall and abduct the shops’ signs--barbers’ poles and other\r\ninsignia of trade--from the houses in the High Street, afterwards\r\nbearing them back to the Christopher in triumph. The tradesmen bore\r\nthese eccentricities with considerable fortitude, for in the end they\r\nwere pretty sure not to suffer.\r\n\r\nRepresentations to the masters and authorities were scarcely necessary\r\nto redress such whimsical grievances, the injured parties being well\r\naware that they would receive due compensation. The next day the\r\nspoils and trophies were arranged in due form in the cellar at the\r\nold inn, which became well known by the name of “Oppidan’s Museum.”\r\nHere the merry wags were to be found in council, holding a court of\r\nclaims, to which all the shopkeepers who had suffered any loss were\r\nsuccessively summoned; and after pointing out from among the motley\r\ncollection the article they claimed, and the price it originally cost,\r\nthey were handsomely remunerated or the sign replaced. The good people\r\nof Eton generally chose the former, as it not only enabled them to\r\nsport a new sign, but to put a little profit upon the cost price of\r\nthe old one. The trophies thus acquired were then packed up in hampers\r\nand despatched to Oxford, where they were on similar occasions not\r\ninfrequently displayed or hung up in lieu of some well-known sign,\r\nsuch as the Mitre, etc., which had been removed during the night.\r\n\r\nSome Collegers once played a joke of this sort on Dr. Keate. A\r\nWindsor hatter, Jones by name, had outside his shop an immense tin\r\nthree-cornered cocked hat as a sign, the exact counterpart, except much\r\nlarger, of the one Keate wore. This was stolen one winter’s evening\r\nby a detachment of Collegers; they managed to send it to London, and\r\nthence, carefully packed, it was forwarded to Keate. Meanwhile, a\r\nletter was sent to Jones saying that the writer could give him some\r\ninkling of who was the thief, for that Dr. Keate had long been observed\r\nto eye this magnificent cocked hat with longing envy, and there was no\r\ndoubt if a search warrant was procured, it would be found in the house\r\nof the Headmaster.\r\n\r\nThe cellar in which met the so-called “Oppidans’ Club” was known\r\nas “the Estaminet.” The usual fare here was bread and cheese, beer\r\nand porter, and in its general features it seems to have been the\r\nprecursor of the present Tap. Lower boys had no share in its amenities.\r\nOn occasion, however, stronger potations were indulged in, and of\r\ncourse this was more especially the case when old Etonians from the\r\nUniversities were paying a visit to their old school.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OPPIDAN’S MUSEUM _or Eton Court of Claims at the\r\nChristopher_. _From a coloured print in the possession of the Rt.\r\nHonble. Lewis Harcourt, M.P._]\r\n\r\nNo doubt, these visitors had rather a demoralising effect upon the\r\nboys who stood by in admiration, envying the bucks who lounged over\r\nthe rails of the gallery and indulged in chaff with those below,\r\nwhilst they ogled any pretty girl who might chance to meet their roving\r\nglance, or chaffed any mischievous Etonians who hung about the old\r\nyard, occasionally pulling the bungs out of the casks which were ranged\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIn the old Christopher the assistant masters at one time had a room\r\nreserved for them in which they were wont to meet, whilst regular\r\nconvivial assemblies were sometimes organised there by Eton boys, one\r\nof the chief being on St. Andrew’s Day, when Colleger had met Oppidan\r\nat the wall.\r\n\r\n[SN: A RAID]\r\n\r\nIn its last years, when the famous hostelry began to be regarded as a\r\ngreat moral danger by the authorities, they began to make determined\r\nefforts to prevent boys from being within its doors, and one St.\r\nAndrew’s Day a raid was suddenly made. Just as the revelry had reached\r\nits height, Smut, otherwise known as Beelzebub, the head waiter,\r\nannounced the appearance of a party of masters. Great confusion ensued,\r\nand as an ominous creaking of boots was heard on the staircase, the\r\nlandlord’s daughter turned off the gas, and all was left in darkness.\r\nA stentorian voice was heard crying, “I require the landlord of this\r\nhouse to provide me with a light.” Meanwhile, one of the masters groped\r\nhis way to the door of the banqueting-room and held it so that no one\r\ncould pass. One of the raiding party, a master named Goodford, who\r\nafterwards became “Head,” greatly distinguished himself by embracing\r\nSmut, whom in the darkness he mistook for a boy trying to make his\r\nescape. However, he was rudely undeceived by a gruff voice grunting\r\nout, “Come, none of this nonsense!” At length a light was procured, and\r\nas the boys filed out, one by one, their names were entered in a “black\r\nlist.”\r\n\r\nThe curious thing is that little organised effort seems ever to have\r\nbeen made to prevent boys from being allowed to enter the old inn;\r\nraiding them when within its walls naturally did little good; in fact,\r\nit merely stimulated the spirit of adventure and made them go there\r\nmore. A cousin of the writer--well-known as master of the West Kent\r\nfoxhounds--describing Eton life under Hawtrey, could not help speaking\r\nwith glee of how he and a companion were the only boys out of twenty\r\nwho managed to escape during one of these raids, the perilous method\r\nadopted having been to climb down a waterpipe and then drop into the\r\nyard at the back.\r\n\r\nThe Christopher finally ended its career as a hostelry in 1842, owing\r\nto the Crown giving up the lease to the College. Its abolition had\r\nbeen constantly urged ever since Dr. Hawtrey had become Headmaster.\r\nA violent foe to the old inn and its enemy, he branded it as the\r\ngreatest evil in Eton life, and after it had been numbered with things\r\nof the past he was so pleased that, as a sort of thank-offering, he\r\nwanted it to be pulled down and a chapel of ease erected on the site.\r\nThis scheme, however, was not carried out, St. John’s Church being\r\nbuilt in the High Street instead and the Christopher turned into a\r\nboarding-house, the tap-room becoming a court of justice, where petty\r\nsessions were held.\r\n\r\nAnother part of the building was appropriated to the use of the Eton\r\nDebating Society, commonly called “Pop” (it is said, from “popina,”\r\nan eating-house), which celebrated its centenary in the present year.\r\nIts original domicile was over the small shop of Mrs. Hatton, the\r\nconfectioner, quarters very useful for gratifying a love of “sock.” It\r\nis said that at the Saturday four-o’clock meetings the proceedings were\r\noften delayed by the consumption of ices and cakes and the drinking of\r\ncherry brandy.\r\n\r\n[SN: WILLIAM JOHNSON]\r\n\r\nThe vestibule, where so many wild young bucks had kicked their heels,\r\nwas turned into a pupil room, in which for a time presided one of the\r\nmost gifted, if eccentric, Eton masters who ever existed, William\r\nJohnson (who afterwards changed his name to Cory), the author of\r\n_Ionica_ and of the Eton boating song. Highly unconventional in his\r\nways, he could never remain unmoved when he heard the sound of drums\r\noutside in the street, indicating that some regiment was passing\r\nthrough the College. Eton has given many a gallant officer to England,\r\nand, as the large number of memorials in the Chapel shows, the roll of\r\nEtonian soldiers is associated with numberless glorious memories. These\r\nstirred the imaginative mind of the clever master, and, keenly desirous\r\nthat the rising generation should imbibe a due portion of that martial\r\nardour which was the heritage of their school, he would lead his pupils\r\nout to the archway, and, pointing to the passing regiment, proudly\r\nexclaim, “Boys, the British army!”\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson was an Eton master from 1845 to 1872, during which\r\nperiod he showed all the qualifications of a gifted teacher, though\r\nat times betraying considerable eccentricity. He was much given to\r\nintrospection, and amused boys would often regale themselves with the\r\nsight of Billy Johnson, as they irreverently called him, standing wrapt\r\nin profound meditation all alone in the school-yard, totally oblivious\r\nof everything about him. He was very short-sighted, which gave rise to\r\nthe story that he had been seen furiously rushing down Windsor Hill,\r\nmaking futile grabs at a fleeing hen, which he believed to be his hat,\r\nblown off by the wind. In school, owing to this infirmity, he was\r\nunable to perceive what boys were doing, and the carving of names and\r\ncutting into desks and forms was carried on in perfect safety beneath\r\nhis very nose. Against positive disorder, however, he could well defend\r\nhimself, and his paradoxical utterances and epigrammatic sayings kept\r\neven the most turbulent spirits in check.\r\n\r\nHis powers of satire were generally recognised as being highly\r\nformidable, and masters as well as boys sometimes felt the keen thrust\r\nof his rapier. In a school book, _Nuces_, written by him for the use of\r\nthe lower forms, was to be found a sentence which Etonians universally\r\nagreed was a hit at a somewhat unpopular master, conspicuous for the\r\nlength of his flowing beard. This ran: “Formerly wise men used to grow\r\nbeards. Now other persons do so.”\r\n\r\n[SN: THE BOATING SONG]\r\n\r\nThough the poetical masterpiece of Mr. Johnson is the small volume\r\nentitled _Ionica_, which contains some beautiful verse, a more\r\ngenerally known composition of his is the Eton boating song, which\r\nhas been carried by old Etonians practically all over the world. An\r\ninteresting account of how this song came to be written is given by\r\nthe Reverend A. C. Ainger in his admirable work on _Eton in Prose and\r\nVerse_. It would seem to have been composed in the winter of 1863\r\nfor the 4th of June of that year. Some little time later the words\r\nwere printed in the third number of a periodical called the _Eton\r\nScrap-book_, of which Everard Primrose was one of the joint-editors.\r\nA copy of the words were sent in 1865 to a subaltern in the Rifle\r\nBrigade, Algernon Drummond by name, who was then with his battalion at\r\nNowshera, in India. This young officer, who, four or five years before,\r\nhad been one of Johnson’s pupils, was haunted by the words till the\r\ntune came to them, and eventually, owing to him, a number of officers\r\nwho had been at Eton made a practice of singing it nightly after mess.\r\nGradually guests learnt it, with the result that old Etonians in other\r\nregiments took to singing the song which recalled to them their old\r\nschool in distant England.\r\n\r\nThe composition of this boating song, it should be added, cost William\r\nJohnson much trouble and some sleepless nights; nevertheless, its\r\nfinal form contains some lines which are scarcely worthy of an author\r\nwho, in _Ionica_, has shown himself a true poet. It must, however, be\r\nremembered that the song, as we have it, was never intended for the\r\nwide publicity which it so speedily attained. No doubt its popularity\r\nhas been in a great measure caused by the charming tune to which it was\r\nset, whilst the whole-hearted and somewhat touching devotion to Eton\r\nexpressed in the words makes an irresistible appeal to all true sons of\r\nthe school, particularly to those who remember the days when, free from\r\ncare, they passed many a happy hour\r\n\r\n  Skirting past the rushes,\r\n    Ruffling o’er the weeds,\r\n  Where the lock stream gushes,\r\n    Where the cygnet feeds.\r\n\r\nThe fact that “the rushes” are now no more, having been entirely swept\r\naway by the great flood of 1894, will not cause Etonians of a later\r\ndate to sing the words less heartily, and many a generation yet to come\r\nwill probably continue to accord this boating song the appreciation\r\nwhich it first obtained nearly half a century ago.\r\n\r\nNo man, perhaps, ever expressed better the true Eton spirit than Mr.\r\nJohnson in some words he uttered a few months before his death. He was\r\na sufferer from heart disease, and realised that his end might at any\r\ntime occur. Declining a friend’s invitation, he said, “I think it\r\nunmannerly to drop down dead in another man’s grounds.”\r\n\r\nThe pupil room in which he sat has now ceased to serve that purpose;\r\nthe old structure of the Christopher, having undergone further changes,\r\nis now used merely to accommodate masters, and has ceased to be an\r\nEton house. The only external trace of the inn yard as it was, are\r\nsome of the old balustrades of the ancient gallery facing the site of\r\nthe livery stables which were swept away in 1901. Many will remember\r\nCharley Wise, the proprietor, who used to be such a familiar figure\r\nstanding under the archway thirty years ago.\r\n\r\n[SN: SHELLEY]\r\n\r\nThe original sign of the Christopher, it should be added, hangs at\r\nthe modern Christopher in the High Street. Shelley, when an Eton boy,\r\none night stole the great gilded bunch of grapes from this, and hung\r\nit in front of the Headmaster’s door, so that the astounded pedagogue\r\nran into it as he was hurrying into school in the morning. The whole\r\ncharacter of Shelley was a mass of contradictions, and he seems to have\r\nbeen far from happy at school, where he seldom joined in any sports;\r\naccording to some he never went on the river, but this is doubtful.\r\nThe young poet’s favourite ramble was Stoke Park and the picturesque\r\nchurchyard close by, rendered famous for all time by Gray’s _Elegy_, of\r\nwhich Shelley is said to have been very fond.\r\n\r\nAs was shown by the incident of the Christopher’s grapes, Shelley,\r\nthough as a rule of a meditative disposition, was on occasion given to\r\nplaying pranks. He once bought a large brass cannon at an auction in\r\nWindsor, and harnessed many Lower boys to draw it down into College.\r\nIt was captured by one of the tutors and kept till the holidays at\r\nHexter’s. He was fond of experimenting in science, and set fire to a\r\ntree in south meadow by laying a train of gunpowder to it; another\r\ntime, by means of an electrical machine, he flung his tutor against the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nThis tutor’s name was Bethell, and, according to all accounts, he was\r\na somewhat unattractive character. Amongst the boys he was known as\r\n“Vox et praeterea nihil” and “Botch” Bethell, because he was supposed\r\nalways to be making errors or botches in altering their verses. His\r\nfavourite phrase, which he used to alter as it might be for a long or\r\na short verse, was for the former “sibi vindicat ipse,” for the latter\r\n“vindicat ipse sibi,” in consequence of which an impudent boy in his\r\nhouse, being one day asked at meal-time what he would take, said, “Sir,\r\nI vindicate to myself a slice of mutton.” Towards the boys under his\r\ncharge Bethell was harsh, and sometimes even brutal. Meeting a Lower\r\nboy one day coming in with a bowl full of sausages covered by his hat\r\nto keep them warm, Bethell sternly inquired, “What have you got there?”\r\nThe boy, fearing trouble, whimpered, “Nothing, sir,” upon which Bethell\r\njerked up the bowl with his hand and sent hat and sausages flying into\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\nIn Shelley’s day, life at Eton had changed a good deal, compared with\r\nthat led some twenty years before, when Arthur Wellesley was a shy,\r\nretiring Lower boy, in whom neither masters nor schoolfellows saw any\r\ngerms of future greatness.\r\n\r\n[SN: THE GREAT DUKE]\r\n\r\nHe was about twelve years old when he went to Miss Naylor’s, and\r\nin spite of his shyness he is supposed to have taken part with his\r\ncompanions in several escapades. Traditions used to be current at Eton\r\nabout his shooting expeditions up the river at unpermitted seasons and\r\nhours; and during the middle of the last century a tree standing near\r\nthe site of his dame’s was known as “the Duke’s Tree,” because it was\r\nsaid that as a boy the old duke had been fond of climbing it. Arthur\r\nWellesley was not very long at Eton, but nevertheless in after life he\r\ncherished a great love for the school to which in due course he sent\r\nhis sons. One of his first acts on going down to visit them there was\r\nto take them to see the door at his old house where, when a boy, he had\r\ncut his own name. Though no great athlete himself, he fully appreciated\r\nthe manly character induced by games and sport, and Creasy declares\r\nthat not many years before his death he was passing by the playing\r\nfields, where numerous groups were happily busied at their games of\r\ncricket. Pointing to them, the old Field-Marshal said, “There grows the\r\nstuff that won Waterloo.”\r\n\r\nThe great Duke’s elder brother, Lord Mornington, afterwards Marquis of\r\nWellesley, had, as is well known, a fanatical love for Eton, where,\r\nby his express wish, he was buried, his own beautiful Latin lines[3]\r\nrecording the satisfaction with which he looked forward to resting\r\nthere. According to a request which he left behind him, six weeping\r\nwillows were planted in different parts of the playing fields, and a\r\nbench fixed at a particular spot which commanded his favourite view.\r\n\r\nAs an Eton boy he was a particularly fine elocutionist, as was shown\r\nby two recitations of his at Speeches on Election Monday 1778, before\r\na large number of royal visitors; in Strafford’s dying speech he drew\r\ntears from the audience. David Garrick, hearing of it, complimented the\r\nyouthful speaker on having done what he had never achieved, namely,\r\nmade the King weep. To which the clever Etonian returned the graceful\r\nanswer, “That is because you never spoke to him in the character of a\r\nfallen favourite.”\r\n\r\nIn many ways this brother of the Iron Duke may be considered the\r\ntype of the perfect Etonian, and, as far as classical learning went,\r\nscarcely any boy educated at the school ever equalled him. When Dr.\r\nGoodall, a contemporary at Eton of Lord Wellesley, was examined in 1818\r\nbefore the Education Committee of the House of Commons respecting the\r\nalleged passing over of Porson in giving promotions to King’s College,\r\nhe at once declared that the celebrated Greek scholar was not by any\r\nmeans at the head of the Etonians of his day; and on being asked by\r\nLord Brougham, the Chairman, to name his superior, he at once said,\r\n“Lord Wellesley.”\r\n\r\n[SN: A SUGGESTION]\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, there appears to be no record of where the young\r\nnobleman boarded. Presumably it was at Miss Naylor’s, where later came\r\nhis illustrious brother. A commemorative tablet should surely be set up\r\nnear the spot where those two great Etonians lived when Eton boys. The\r\nhouses where a number of other prominent men spent their school days\r\nare for the most part known, and several others might be honoured in\r\na similar manner, arousing a spirit of noble emulation and pride in a\r\nsplendid record of those who have deserved well of their country.\r\n\r\nA somewhat remarkable coincidence is that George Canning, Gladstone,\r\nand the late Lord Salisbury in turn boarded at the same house. In\r\nCanning’s time the dame was Mrs. Harrington, in Gladstone’s Mrs.\r\nShurey, whilst in Lord Robert Cecil’s day the Rev. G. Cookesley was in\r\ncontrol. Amongst modern politicians Lord Rosebery boarded at Vidal’s,\r\nMr. Balfour at Miss Evans’s, Lord Curzon at Mr. Oscar Browning’s, and\r\nMr. Lewis Harcourt at the Rev. A. C. Ainger’s. The room of the present\r\nColonial Secretary was celebrated as being the best decorated in Eton.\r\nThe writer has a vivid recollection of being impressed by the number of\r\nwell-arranged pictures which he saw when, as a small boy, he enjoyed\r\nthe honour of being asked to breakfast there. The whole place was full\r\nof evidences of the artistic taste which admittedly distinguished Mr.\r\nHarcourt as First Commissioner of Public Works.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[3] See Chapter VI.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Herbert Stockhore, the “Montem Poet,” going to Salt Hill\r\nin 1823.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV MONTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nThough even to-day a few old Etonians survive who took part in the last\r\nEton Montem, the memory and the recollection of the quaint glories of\r\nthis ancient and unique festival will soon have become totally obscured\r\nby the sordid dust of modern life.\r\n\r\nWhilst the lover of old customs may lament that the merry voices of\r\nMontem are drowned for ever, it is absolutely certain that even had\r\nthe famous triennial pageant been allowed to continue after 1844, its\r\ncelebration could never have been prolonged up to the present day in\r\nits ancient form; for, besides being utterly out of accord with modern\r\nideas and ways, the ceremony would have brought such crowds to Eton as\r\nto have rendered any procession to Salt Hill more or less impossible.\r\nTo some, however, it may be a matter for regret that no attempt was\r\nmade to perpetuate the memory of Montem by holding a modified festival\r\nin the playing fields.\r\n\r\nIt is all very well to denounce old customs as merely useless relics\r\nof a bygone age. The individual who carries such a view to an\r\nextreme is in reality even more unreasonable than he who delights in\r\ncontemplating the past alone. Both in their different ways are in the\r\nwrong: the fanatical worshipper of ancient ways being apt to lose\r\nsight of the improvements wrought by progress, whilst he who despises\r\nantiquity forgets that the state of society in which we live, and the\r\ninstitutions of the country itself, are all derived from preceding\r\nages. Do or think what we will, our ancestors are far more necessary to\r\nus than posterity.\r\n\r\nThe tumulus or mound, to which the whole school formerly marched in\r\nprocession at Whitsuntide once in every three years, stands in a field\r\njust off the Bath road in the hamlet known as Salt Hill. Supposed by\r\nsome to be an ancient barrow, it appears to have never been opened,\r\nthough a portion was sliced off in 1893 when some cottages were built\r\nclose by. It seems a pity that this hillock--the scene of so many\r\npicturesque gatherings in the past--should not have been preserved\r\nintact, and some memorial, inscribed with a brief account of the\r\nceremony of Montem, placed upon its summit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Montem of 1823. _From an old print._]\r\n\r\n[SN: THE PARSON AND HIS CLERK]\r\n\r\nThe exact origin of “Montem” is involved in considerable obscurity.\r\nPerhaps the most plausible explanation is that it arose in a similar\r\nmanner as the old Winchester custom of “going on Hills.” Another theory\r\nis that the festival was of feudal origin, the tenure of the College\r\nestates having been held by the payment of “salt-silver”--an ancient\r\nlegal term signifying money paid by tenants in certain manors in lieu\r\nof service of bringing their lord’s salt from the market. It may have\r\nalso been originally connected with the curious ceremony of electing\r\na “Boy-Bishop.” In a number of old Montem Lists, which the writer has\r\nbeen fortunate enough to acquire, the parson occupies a prominent place\r\nin the procession, coming immediately after the Captain and being\r\nfollowed by the clerk. Both ecclesiastical characters, it should be\r\nadded, were always personated by Collegers, and it was the custom for\r\nthem to indulge in gross buffoonery, the parson delivering a burlesque\r\nsermon on Salt Hill, down which he afterwards kicked the clerk. In 1778\r\nthis proceeding so scandalised Queen Charlotte, who was present, that\r\nshe begged it might never occur again, and henceforth both parson and\r\nclerk ceased to figure in the ceremony.\r\n\r\nAccording to some, the original date for celebrating Montem was\r\nDecember 6th, the very day dedicated to St. Nicholas, and usually\r\nchosen for the election of the “Boy-Bishop” in ancient times. Be\r\nthis as it may, in Elizabeth’s reign the procession took place\r\nabout the feast of the Conversion of St. Paul. Granted that it was\r\never celebrated on St. Nicholas’ Day, those who derive it from the\r\n“Boy-Bishop” have a coincidence of time in their favour, whence it\r\nis not unreasonable to suppose a connection between the triennial\r\nfestival at Eton and the ancient ecclesiastical mimicry of an episcopal\r\nelection. Another circumstance favourable to the same supposition is\r\nfound in a singular custom which formerly made part of the Montem\r\nfestival. The parson at one period, receiving a Prayer-book, used to\r\nread part of the Service to the crowd; which usage bore an obvious\r\nresemblance to the mimic services performed by the “Boy-Bishop” in the\r\ndistant past. Till 1759, when the date was changed to Whit-Tuesday,\r\nMontem was annual; it then became biennial, and finally after 1775\r\ntriennial.\r\n\r\nIn those days it had already assimilated some striking features of that\r\ncurious alliance of licensed mendicity, brigandage, and gaiety--the\r\nmodern charity bazaar. Of its ancient character as a semi-religious\r\nfestival nothing remained, and it had become a collection for the\r\nbenefit of the Captain of the Collegers who might have been fortunate\r\nenough to obtain a vacancy at King’s College, Cambridge.\r\n\r\n[SN: “MONTEM-SURE”]\r\n\r\nThe proceedings in College which heralded the approach of Montem were\r\ncharacteristic and peculiar. In former days it was the custom that\r\nany vacancy at King’s should be immediately announced at Eton by\r\nthe “resignation man,” generally the coachman of the Provost of that\r\nCollege, a delay of three weeks all but a day being allowed to the\r\nCaptain of the school in which he might make his preparations for\r\nleaving. If, however, this period of grace should chance to expire on\r\nthe very eve of Whitsun-Tuesday Montem-day, the right of being Captain\r\nwould lapse to the Colleger who was next on the list, so that the\r\ntwentieth day before Whitsun-Tuesday in that year was a very critical\r\nday for the Captain and second Colleger. Till midnight it could not\r\nbe known for certain who would be Captain. The boys called that night\r\n“Montem-Sure Night,” when wild excitement prevailed amongst the\r\nCollegers in Long Chamber, and as the last stroke of midnight sounded\r\nfrom the clock in Lupton’s Tower, some fifty-two stout oaken beds\r\nwould be let fall on to the floor with a thundering crash, numberless\r\nshutters would be slammed with furious energy, and “Montem-Sure,”\r\nshouted by many powerful young throats, would ring out all over Eton.\r\n\r\nWhoever was Captain of the school on the Whitsun-Tuesday in a Montem\r\nyear became _ipso facto_ Captain of Montem. But, as has before been\r\nsaid, the Captain of the school could not be known for certain till\r\nwithin twenty days of the eventful Whitsun-Tuesday.\r\n\r\nA King’s scholar could, if he succeeded in passing his “election\r\ntrials” every year at the end of July, remain at Eton a twelvemonth\r\nafter passing the last examination, provided he was not yet nineteen.\r\nIf by that time he had not gone to King’s College, Cambridge, he was\r\nsuperannuated, and had to leave Eton. At the examination at the end\r\nof every July those boys who had passed their eighteenth birthday\r\nwere placed in school order of merit, and were called from thence to\r\nCambridge at any time of the year, whenever, through death, marriage,\r\nor any cause, a vacancy occurred in the number of the seventy members\r\nof King’s College, in order to supply which King Henry VI. founded his\r\nschool at Eton of seventy scholars. Montem only happened every third\r\nyear, for which reason it was only possible that a boy who was born\r\nin such a year that he would have passed his eighteenth birthday on\r\nthe July previous to a Montem could ever become captain of Montem, and\r\nobtain the financial benefits accruing from the collection made at that\r\nfestival.\r\n\r\n[SN: “SALT! SALT”]\r\n\r\nWilliam Malim, the Headmaster, who wrote an account of Eton for the\r\nRoyal Commission who visited the school in 1561, thus described the\r\nMontem of his day:--\r\n\r\n  About the festival of the Conversion of Saint Paul, at nine o’clock\r\n  on a day chosen by the Master, in the accustomed manner in which they\r\n  go to collect nuts in September, the boys go ad montem. The hill is\r\n  a sacred spot according to the boyish religion of the Etonians; on\r\n  account of the beauty of the countryside, the delicious grass, the\r\n  cool shade of bowers, and the melodious chorus of birds, they make it\r\n  a holy shrine for Apollo and the Muses, celebrate it in songs, call\r\n  it Tempe, and extol it above Helicon. Here the novices or new boys,\r\n  who have not yet submitted to blows in the Eton ranks, manfully and\r\n  stoutly, for a whole year, are first seasoned with salt and then\r\n  separately described in little poems which must be as salted and\r\n  graceful as possible. Next, they make epigrams against the new boys,\r\n  one vying with another to surpass in all elegance of speech and in\r\n  witticisms. Whatever comes to the lips may be uttered freely so long\r\n  as it is in Latin, courteous, and free from scurrility. Finally they\r\n  wet their faces and cheeks with salt tears, and then at last they are\r\n  initiated in the rites of the veterans. Ovations follow, and little\r\n  triumphs, and they rejoice in good earnest, because their labours are\r\n  past, and because they are admitted to the society of such pleasant\r\n  comrades. These things finished they turn home at five o’clock and\r\n  after dinner play till eight.\r\n\r\nIn the days of Elizabeth, and during the turbulent time of the Civil\r\nWar, Montem seems to have assumed a more regular and ceremonious\r\nform. Only, however, at the beginning of the eighteenth century did\r\nit acquire those military characteristics which it retained with\r\nlittle modification till its abolition in 1847. Till the middle of the\r\neighteenth century (1759) it was held in the last week in January,\r\nbut at that date Whitsun-Tuesday was appointed as the great day. Dr.\r\nBarnard it was who altered the dresses and formed the boys into a\r\nregular collegiate regiment.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times the collectors, that is to say the boys who scoured\r\nthe roads for miles round Eton to collect contributions, carried\r\nlarge bags which actually contained salt, a pinch of which they gave\r\nto every contributor as a receipt. In the rough old times, when any\r\nboorish-looking countryman after having contributed a trifle asked for\r\nsalt, it used to be a favourite pleasantry to fill his mouth with it.\r\nThe last Montem at which salt was actually used seems to have been\r\nthat of 1793. The cry of “Salt! Salt!” lasted long after tickets had\r\ntaken the place of the condiment, and, indeed, endured to the end,\r\nembroidered bags being proffered to travellers along the roads, who, in\r\nreturn for contributions which varied from fifty pounds to sixpence,\r\nwere presented with little blue tickets inscribed with one of the Latin\r\nMontem mottoes. In the years preceding the abolition of the ceremony,\r\n_Mos pro Lege_ and _Pro More et Monte_ were used in alternate years.\r\nNot infrequently people who had never heard of the ancient custom were\r\nvery much astonished at being asked for salt. William the Third, it\r\nis said, soon after his accession, had his carriage stopped by Montem\r\nrunners on the Bath road, and his Dutch guards, being not unnaturally\r\nindignant at their monarch being waylaid in such unceremonious fashion,\r\nwere only prevented from cutting down the boys, whom they took for some\r\nkind of highwaymen, by the King himself, who good-naturedly gave the\r\nsalt-bearers a liberal contribution.\r\n\r\nIn 1706 Montem would seem to have evolved into something of the same\r\nform which it retained till its abolition, the organisation being of\r\na military kind. In that year Stephen Poyntz was captain, Berkeley\r\nSeymour lieutenant, Theophilus Thompson ensign, and Anthony Allen\r\nmarshal, or, as the Montem List always termed it, “mareschal.”\r\n\r\n[SN: THE MARCH TO SALT HILL]\r\n\r\nIn connection with the ceremony, Poyntz composed the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  Allen pandit iter, Poyntz instruit agmen,\r\n  Cogit iter Seymour Thompsonque insignia vibrat.\r\n\r\nI think I am right in saying that it has hitherto escaped notice that\r\nthe great Duke of Wellington took part in an “ad Montem.” An old list\r\nin my possession shows that at the Montem of June 5th, 1781, Mr.\r\nWesley, as he is termed, marched to Salt Hill as one of the attendants\r\nof an Upper boy named Lomax. An appended note adds, “His Grace’s first\r\nappearance in arms.” His sons, Lord Douro and Lord Charles Wellesley,\r\nmarched in the processions of 1820 and 1823.\r\n\r\nAt the Montem of 1826 Gladstone, in order evidently to express that\r\nsympathy for downtrodden nations for which he was so celebrated in\r\nafter life, went to Salt Hill in Greek costume wearing the fustanella\r\nand embroidered cap. This was Pickering’s Montem, and owing to\r\nGladstone and others repressing a good deal of wanton damage, the sum\r\nobtained for him was one of the largest on record.\r\n\r\nThe march to Salt Hill was, of course, always somewhat tumultuous, and\r\nmuch licence prevailed. As time went on efforts were made to purge the\r\nfête of its disorderly features, but up to the very end there was a\r\ngood deal of horseplay and rowdiness amongst the boys; indeed, at the\r\nlast Montem but one, in 1841, they did great damage to the inns at\r\nSalt Hill, whilst it was rare that the gardens of these hostelries\r\ncame unscathed through the eventful day, owing to the boys slashing\r\nthe plants and bushes with their swords. If the Captain of Montem\r\nhappened to be unpopular, much damage was often done, the boys being\r\nwell aware that on him would fall the burden of compensation, which\r\nhad to be paid out of the Montem money; and it is said that on one\r\noccasion an unfortunate Captain was actually out of pocket owing to the\r\ncompensation he had to pay.\r\n\r\nMontem commenced by a number of the senior boys taking post upon the\r\nbridges or other leading places of all the avenues around Windsor and\r\nEton soon after the dawn of day. These runners (or “servitors,” as\r\nthe Montem List calls them) were indefatigable in collecting salt or\r\nmoney from every one whom they came across, and for seven or eight\r\nmiles around Eton travellers were liable to be accosted. The runners\r\nwho worked in outlying districts generally drove in a gig, being\r\naccompanied by an attendant dressed in white--well able to protect the\r\nrunners against violence or robbery. The total of the sums collected\r\nwas afterwards given to the two salt-bearers--one Colleger and one\r\nOppidan--Upper boys who marched in the rear of the procession. In the\r\nearlier part of the day these functionaries remained in the precincts\r\nof College. The twelve runners were gorgeously attired in fancy dresses\r\nof various kinds, bright colours predominating; they wore plumed hats\r\nand buff boots, and carried silken bags strengthened with netting to\r\nhold the “salt”--that is the money which they obtained. Their peculiar\r\nbadges of office were painted staves emblazoned with mottoes at the\r\ntop, which in most cases consisted of short quotations from Virgil\r\nor Horace. “Quando ita majores” was a favourite one. Occasionally,\r\nhowever, the motto was modern, “Nullum jus sine sale,” for instance.\r\nContributors of “salt” received in return a small dated ticket\r\ninscribed _Pro More et Monte_ or _Mos pro Lege_. This, placed in a hat\r\nor pinned on to a coat, would pass any one free with all runners for\r\nthe rest of the day.\r\n\r\n[SN: MONTEM MORNING]\r\n\r\nNothing could have been prettier or more animated than the old\r\nschool-yard the morning of a Montem, filled as it was with the boys in\r\ntheir military uniforms of blue and red, or in fancy dresses, for the\r\nmost part of a rich and tasteful kind. Fantastically attired Turks,\r\nAlbanians, and Highlanders mingled with courtiers and pages of every\r\nage, an additional note of colour being furnished by the bright dresses\r\nof numerous female relatives and friends who had come down to Eton\r\nto see the show. In addition to the boys in uniform and fancy dress,\r\na considerable number of Lower School who followed at the end of the\r\nprocession wore the old Eton costume of blue jacket and white trousers,\r\nonly abandoned after the death of George III. Such boys carried long\r\nthin wands about five feet long, which after the ceremonial were,\r\naccording to immemorial usage, cut in two by the corporals with their\r\nswords. Occasionally, however, some of the “polemen,” as they were\r\ncalled, contrived to keep their wands intact to the end of the day--a\r\nrare and difficult feat.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the eighteenth century Montem was often attended\r\nby Royalty. The College flag, of rich crimson silk emblazoned with\r\nthe Eton arms and the motto _Mos pro Lege_ within a wreath of oak\r\nand laurel, would on the great day be displayed at one of the Long\r\nChamber windows early in the morning, and at eleven o’clock George\r\nIII. would generally appear with his family, and be received by the\r\nboys with a long-continued roar of huzzas. The King would then be met\r\nby the Headmaster at the entrance to the school-yard and conducted to\r\nan elaborate breakfast, after which the Royal party would move with\r\nthe procession towards Salt Hill, the principal scene of the day’s\r\ndisplay. A breakfast given by the Captain of Montem in the College Hall\r\ncontinued to be one of the features of the day right up to the last\r\ncelebration in 1844. In the _Illustrated London News_ of that year can\r\nbe seen, amongst other interesting pictures of the last Montem, a cut\r\nof this banquet. The unrestored Hall is filled with guests, the College\r\nflag being suspended above the High Table. After the feast general\r\nexhilaration prevailed. My cousin, Sir Algernon West--a survivor of the\r\nlast Montem, which he attended as a “poleman”--tells me that he has an\r\nunpleasant memory of a schoolfellow, who had partaken of the pleasures\r\nof the table too freely, prodding him with a sword.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Montem of 1841--The March round the School-Yard.\r\n_Engraved by C. G. Lewis after a drawing by W. Evans._ _Print lent by\r\nD. Jay, Esq._]\r\n\r\nThe procession always commenced in the Great Quadrangle at Eton, and\r\nproceeded through Eton to Slough, and round to Salt Hill, where the\r\nboys all passed before the King or Queen and ascended the Montem; here\r\nan oration was delivered, and the Grand Standard was displayed with\r\nmuch grace and activity by the Standard-bearer, selected from among the\r\nsenior boys.\r\n\r\nThere were two extraordinary salt-bearers appointed to attend the\r\nRoyalties; these salt-bearers were always attired in fanciful habits,\r\ngenerally costly and sometimes superb, and each carried an embroidered\r\nbag, which not only received the royal salt, but also whatever was\r\ncollected by the out-stationed runners.\r\n\r\nThe donation of the King or Queen, or, as it was called, “the royal\r\nsalt,” was always fifty guineas each; the Prince of Wales thirty\r\nguineas; all the other Princes and Princesses twenty guineas each.\r\n\r\n[SN: THE WINDMILL]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ceremony “ad Montem” was over the Royal Family returned\r\nto Windsor. The boys then dined in detachments--seniors separated\r\nfrom juniors--in the taverns at Salt Hill, the gardens at that place\r\nbeing laid out for such ladies and gentlemen as chose to take any\r\nrefreshment, whilst several bands of music played. The “Windmill\r\nInn,” the garden of which was on the other side of the road, was then\r\noften the scene of much riotous festivity, as was a rival house--the\r\n“Castle.” The abolition of Montem was, of course, a severe blow to both\r\nhostelries. About twenty-five years ago the “Windmill” was about to\r\nbe converted into a school when a fire broke out and the old building\r\nwas destroyed. A noticeable feature of the exterior had been some\r\nmagnificent wistaria, the stems of which were twisted into agonised\r\nshapes by the flames. The “Castle” actually did become a school. A\r\nlarge part of the original house was pulled down in 1887 and the rest\r\nof the place converted into a compact country residence. The “Windmill”\r\nwas known to many as “Botham’s,” from the name of its proprietor, who\r\nin the palmy days of Montem during the last century divided what was a\r\nprofitable monopoly with the host of the “Castle,” Partridge by name.\r\nThe latter’s charges were so high that Foote, after partaking of some\r\nrefreshment in his hostelry, once told him that he ought to change his\r\nname to Woodcock--“on account of the length of his bill.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ad Montem, 1838. _From a scarce coloured print in the\r\npossession of Messrs. & Robson Co., Coventry Street, W._]\r\n\r\n[SN: FINANCIAL RESULTS]\r\n\r\nAfter having dined at these inns all the boys returned in the same\r\norder of procession as in the morning, and, marching round the Great\r\nQuadrangle in Eton School, were dismissed. In the eighteenth century\r\nthe Captain would then go and pay his respects to the Royal Family\r\nat the Queen’s Lodge, Windsor, previous to his departure for King’s\r\nCollege, Cambridge; to defray which expense the produce of the Montem\r\nwas presented to him. Upon Whit-Tuesday in the year 1796 it amounted\r\nto over one thousand guineas. The sum, however, varied considerably\r\nin amount, its magnitude being in a great manner determined by his\r\npopularity or unpopularity in the school. In the latter case, as has\r\nbeen said, the result of the collection would sometimes be a good deal\r\ndiminished by damage done in the gardens of the inns at Salt Hill,\r\nwhere ill-disposed boys would destroy the shrubs and flowers with their\r\nswords in order to run up the bill. All the other expenses of the day\r\nwere paid for out of the Salt, and in the latter years of Montem the\r\ntotal collected generally amounted to something between a thousand and\r\neight hundred pounds; but when all disbursements had been made the\r\nCaptain was very lucky if he got three or four hundred pounds. A proof\r\nof this is that when Montem was discontinued in 1847, Dr. Hawtrey gave\r\nthe boy who would have been Captain two hundred pounds contributed by\r\nhimself and a few friends out of their own pockets as compensation.\r\nThis sum the Headmaster had ascertained was a fair equivalent for the\r\nnet amount usually pocketed by the Captain after all expenses had been\r\npaid. These outgoings, it must be remembered, were large, including as\r\nthey did a breakfast to the whole of the Fifth and Sixth Forms and a\r\ndinner to personal friends in the evening, in addition to which there\r\nwere numerous other disbursements which amounted to a considerable sum.\r\n\r\nIn an early account of Montem _circa_ 1560 there is a reference to the\r\nnew boys, termed “recentes,” being seasoned with salt, meaning probably\r\nthat they had to make some small monetary contribution; for up to the\r\nlast Montem celebration, by reason of a curious usage, the origin of\r\nwhich was unknown, boys who had come to Eton within the preceding year\r\nwere expected to pay the Captain a small sum called “recent-money.”\r\n\r\nAt the last celebrations of Montem the order of procession differed\r\nsomewhat from that observed in olden days. It was then headed by\r\nthe marshal, followed by six attendants; band; captain, followed by\r\neight attendants; sergeant-major, followed by two attendants; twelve\r\nsergeants, two and two, each followed by an attendant; colonel,\r\nfollowed by six attendants and four polemen; corporals, two and two,\r\nfollowed by two polemen apiece; second band; ensign with flag, followed\r\nby six attendants and four polemen; corporals, two and two, followed\r\nby one or two polemen apiece; lieutenant, followed by four attendants;\r\nsalt-bearers, runners, and stewards; and a poleman brought up the rear\r\nof the procession.\r\n\r\nThe flag was always solemnly waved in the school-yard before the\r\nprocession started, and on arriving at Salt Hill it was waved a second\r\ntime at the top of the mount, the boys all clustering round like a\r\nswarm of bees and cheering with great vigour. Great importance was\r\nalways attached to the waving of the College standard in a proper\r\nmanner, and for a long time previous to Montem day the Ensign practised\r\nfor hours in Long Chamber. The old traditional way of manipulating\r\nthe banner was as far as possible followed, the custom being to wave\r\nit round in every direction and conclude by one triumphant final\r\nflourish which was the grand climax of the whole celebration.\r\n\r\n[SN: AN ETON REGIMENT]\r\n\r\nA complete military organisation with regular uniforms was adopted\r\nby the school on Montem day, and Eton became a collegiate regiment.\r\nThe senior Colleger ranked as captain, the second salt-bearer as\r\nmarshal, the other Sixth-Form Collegers becoming ensign, lieutenant,\r\nsergeant-major, and steward; any other Sixth-Form Collegers not\r\nacting as runners were sergeants. The captain of the Oppidans was\r\nalways a salt-bearer by right, whilst the next to him on the school\r\nlist was colonel; the other Sixth-Form Oppidans ranked as sergeants.\r\nAll the Fifth-Form Oppidans were corporals and wore red tail-coats\r\nwith gilt buttons and white trousers. They had also crimson sashes\r\nround their waists, black leather sword-belts, and swords hanging by\r\ntheir sides. A cocked hat and plume of feathers exactly like that\r\nworn by field-officers completed this martial attire. The Fifth-Form\r\nCollegers’ dress was like that of the Fifth-Form Oppidans, insomuch\r\nas they donned sash, sword, cocked hat, and plume; but their coats\r\nwere blue instead of red, so that they resembled naval officers more\r\nthan military men. The coats of the Sixth Form, both Collegers and\r\nOppidans, had distinctive details of uniform denoting rank, which could\r\nbe at once distinguished from the various forms of epaulet and great\r\nor little prevalence of gilt. The steward wore the ordinary full dress\r\nof the period. The Lower boys who acted as polemen wore the old Eton\r\ncostume--blue coats with gilt buttons, white waistcoats and trousers,\r\nsilk stockings and pumps. The pages of the Sixth Form and others were\r\nattired in fancy dresses, often of a rich description. A feature of\r\nthe last Montem uniforms were the buttons. These bore the Eton arms,\r\nRoyal crown, and motto, _Mos pro Lege_, together with the date of the\r\nfoundation of the College.\r\n\r\nMontem coats were allowed to be worn after the great day was over, but\r\nthe boys suffered for this privilege, most masters generally selecting\r\nthem to construe in preference to their more soberly clad schoolmates.\r\nOne master, indeed, became so notorious for this that eventually his\r\nwhole division appeared in red coats, so as to prevent any particular\r\nboys from being singled out. The last Montem coat worn at Eton is said\r\nto have been observed in 1847.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule pretty good order seems to have been preserved\r\nin connection with Montem, and this is the more wonderful when one\r\nremembers that a large number of the boys wore real swords and indulged\r\nin liberal potations at the inns at Salt Hill. In 1796, it is true,\r\nsome disorder did occur near the historic mount, a large crowd surging\r\naround the carriage in which sat the Queen and the Princesses. George\r\nIII., however, soon put matters to rights by calling out to some of the\r\nworst offenders, “Surely you are not Etonians?” adding that he did not\r\nremember their faces, and felt sure Eton boys would be better behaved.\r\nThree years later, at the Montem of 1799, an Eton boy made a mistake\r\nof which he was afterwards much ashamed. As the procession was moving\r\nalong, a visitor on a spirited and fiery horse kept pressing closer to\r\nit than was pleasant, and one of the sergeants, a youth named Beckett,\r\nputting one hand significantly upon his sword-hilt and the other on\r\nthe rider’s knee, exclaimed in a bold manner, “I should recommend\r\nyou, my friend, not to let your horse tread upon Me.” In reply to\r\nthis the horseman merely smiled, bowed, and drew his horse away. It\r\nwas afterwards discovered that the stranger was the King of Hanover.\r\nAltogether Montem was a day of great enjoyment for those who were\r\npresent at it, much jollity and fun of the old English sort being one\r\nof its chief characteristics. Most of the visitors were well acquainted\r\nwith its traditions and entered thoroughly into its spirit. A favourite\r\njoke was to make a pretence of refusing to contribute whilst concealing\r\nthe little blue paper receipt previously received as quittance for salt\r\npaid.\r\n\r\n[SN: THE PLEASURES OF MONTEM]\r\n\r\n“I will not attempt to reason with you about the pleasures of\r\nMontem,” said an old Etonian, who was defending the old festival\r\nagainst the attacks of one of those hawk-eyed commercial gamblers\r\nwho, calling themselves “business men,” dominate the modern world;\r\n“but to an Etonian it is enough that it brought pure and ennobling\r\nrecollections--evoked associations of hope and happiness--and made\r\neven the wise feel that there was something better than wisdom, and\r\nthe rich something nobler than wealth. I like to think of the faces\r\nI saw round the old mount, recalling school friendships and generous\r\nrivalries. At the last Montem I attended, it is true I saw fifty\r\nfellows of whom I remember only the nicknames--not a few degenerated\r\ninto scheming M.P.’s, cunning lawyers, or speculators--but at Montem\r\none forgot all that. Leaving the plodding world of reality for one day,\r\nsuch men regained the dignity of Sixth-Form Etonians.”\r\n\r\nThe last celebration of Montem took place on Whitsun-Tuesday in\r\n1844, on which occasion some of its ancient features were altered.\r\nThe dinner, for instance, took place on Fellow’s Eyot, within the\r\nCollege precincts, instead of at Salt Hill, the boys having also\r\nto answer to their names in the playing fields. An ominous sign,\r\nwhich seemed to forebode that the ancient ceremony was soon to be\r\ndiscontinued for ever, was that in the last year of Montem the famous\r\ncry of “Montem Sure” was not heard to ring out of the Long Chamber\r\nwindows, no bedsteads crashed, and no shutters banged. Montem, it is\r\ntrue, still lived, but it seemed to be felt that its end was near.\r\nNevertheless, the procession took place according to immemorial usage,\r\nand the fancifully attired throng of boys, accompanied by a crowd of\r\ncarriages, foot and horse, wended its way to the classic mount where\r\nthe ceremonial which countless generations of Etonians had gone through\r\nwas duly performed. Prince Albert, for instance, was stopped on\r\nWindsor Bridge, and in compliance with a request for salt, gave £100.\r\nAt Salt Hill the bands played merrily, and the crowd of boys and old\r\nEtonians cheered as of yore when, for the last time on the summit of\r\nthe mount the Ensign waved the historic College banner, inscribed with\r\nthe quaint old motto, _Pro More et Monte_. Not a few, however, amongst\r\nthe throng gathered there had a presentiment that they were assisting\r\nat the obsequies of the time-honoured ceremony, and as they wended\r\ntheir way back to town felt that Montem was now to be numbered with the\r\nmany other old-world festivals which so-called progress was sweeping\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThese gloomy forebodings proved to be only too well founded. Montem,\r\nindeed, had become somewhat incongruous with the changed spirit which\r\nwas producing a purely utilitarian age. The facilities afforded by the\r\nthen newly constructed railway also flooded Eton and Slough with hordes\r\nof visitors, many of them highly undesirable, besides which the Press\r\nwas none too tender in the attitude which it adopted towards the old\r\nfestival.\r\n\r\n[SN: THE “HOLBORN MONTEM”]\r\n\r\nIn June 1844, for instance, _Punch_ published an amusing, if rather\r\nmalicious, illustrated attack upon the Eton festival, entitled “The\r\nHolborn Montem,” in which it pictured the effect which would be\r\nproduced were a number of London ragamuffins permitted to hold up\r\nfoot-passengers and omnibuses whilst making demands for salt. Dr.\r\nHawtrey, the Headmaster, was bitterly opposed to the continuance of\r\nthe old ceremony, and to him and to the Provost it owed its abolition.\r\nThe remainder of the College authorities were about equally divided in\r\ntheir opinions. When Provost Hodgson put the matter before them they\r\nvoted as follows:--\r\n\r\n  _For abolishing Montem._  _For preserving Montem._\r\n\r\n    Hodgson, Provost.               Plumtre.\r\n    Grover, Vice-Provost.           Carter.\r\n    Bethell.                        Dupuis.\r\n    Green.                          Wilder.\r\n\r\nQueen Victoria personally is known to have been opposed to the\r\nabolition; nevertheless she did not care to interfere, and in 1847\r\nit was announced that no celebration of Montem would take place, and\r\nthough many earnest representations were made by old Etonians to Dr.\r\nHawtrey, the decision to abolish Montem was maintained. Had the Provost\r\nbeen of the same type as Dr. Goodall, some semblance at least of the\r\nancient ceremony would have been preserved, but the post happened to\r\nbe held by Provost Hodgson, the friend of Byron, who, though a man\r\nof poetical turn of mind, was a great reformer. He made many changes\r\nin College, and abolished the horrors of Long Chamber, which is much\r\nto his credit. On the other hand, he was perhaps too thorough-going\r\nin doing away with the ancient festival of Montem, which might have\r\nbeen preserved in an altered form. _Per se_ it was, in many respects,\r\nindefensible, being full of absurdities; nevertheless it might have\r\nbeen continued in some reformed and improved shape.\r\n\r\nThe abolition was keenly resented by the boys, and on the Whit-Tuesday,\r\nwhen the ceremony should have taken place, the old red flag, which\r\nhad figured at many Montems, was hung out of one of the windows of\r\nUpper School as a signal of revolt, and something like a riot ensued.\r\nThis was, however, in the main confined to the Lower boys, who,\r\nafter smashing a few windows (for the repair of which their parents\r\nafterwards grumblingly paid), were soon reduced to order.\r\n\r\nNumbers of old Etonians sadly shook their heads when they heard\r\nthat Montem had become a thing of the past, but, as has been said,\r\nremonstrance and protest were alike unavailing to make the Eton\r\nauthorities realise that entire abolition was too drastic a measure.\r\n\r\n[SN: THE BONE FOR THE MARROW]\r\n\r\nThe truth is that at that period all over England old-fashioned\r\nmerrymaking was beginning to be checked by the chilling force of that\r\nutilitarian commercialism which has since dominated the country.\r\nThe modern spirit, ever prone to exchange happiness for success,\r\nwas already making its influence felt, whilst many, under the false\r\nimpression that romance, tradition, and fancy counted for nothing, were\r\nstraining every nerve to secure the bone whilst entirely failing to\r\nobtain its marrow.\r\n\r\nThe passing of Montem, besides causing some severe pangs of grief to\r\nmany an old Etonian, greatly perturbed a number of humbler folk, and\r\nits abolition was bitterly lamented by a host of tradesmen, cabmen,\r\nomnibus drivers, innkeepers, and the like. Numbers of people derived\r\neither pleasure or profit from the triennial celebration. The most\r\nsincere mourners were the cab and omnibus drivers, who bitterly\r\nregretted their lost harvest, and on the anniversary of the great\r\nfestival wore black crape upon their arms.\r\n\r\nAn interesting and curious exhibition of Montem relics and costumes,\r\nit may be mentioned, was shown at Eton in the Upper School during the\r\ncelebration of the 450th anniversary of the foundation of the College.\r\nOf the three great Eton festivals, Montem, Election Saturday, and the\r\n4th of June, the last and most modern of the three alone survives. The\r\nproceedings on Election Saturday, it should be added, were of a similar\r\nkind to those which still take place on the birthday of King George the\r\nThird--that is to say, the boats’ crews wore gala dresses and dined at\r\nSurly, after which there were fireworks, whilst the bells of Windsor\r\npealed and the crews cheered.\r\n\r\n[SN: MONTEM ODES]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of Montem a few words may not be out of\r\nplace as to a quaint character who was known to many generations of\r\nEtonians as the Montem poet. This was Herbert Stockhore, who, dressed\r\nin quaint attire in a donkey-cart, was a prominent feature at all\r\nMontem celebrations from 1784 to 1835, when he was ninety. Before\r\nbeing chosen Montem poet Stockhore was a Windsor bricklayer living in\r\na little house built by himself, which he called Mount Pleasant, in a\r\nlane leading from Windsor to the meadows.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of June good old George III. always presented Stockhore\r\nwith a present of gold, and George IV. continued the kindly practice.\r\nAt other times Stockhore subsisted entirely upon the bounty of the\r\nEtonians and the inhabitants of Windsor and Eton, who never failed\r\nto administer to his wants and liberally supply him with many little\r\ncomforts in return for his harmless pleasantries.\r\n\r\nStockhore had a time-honoured method of composing his odes well\r\ncalculated to ensure their favourable reception. The quality of his\r\nversification was, of course, very moderate. It may be judged from the\r\nfollowing, culled from the Montem Ode of 1826 (Pickering’s year):--\r\n\r\n    I, Herbert Stockhore, once more,\r\n    In spite of age and pains rheumatic,\r\n    Hop down to “Montem” with verses Attic,\r\n    To make the Muse as have done before.\r\n  For why should I lie a-bed groaning and bickering\r\n  When I ought to be up to sing Captain Pickering.\r\n\r\nA happier effort, perhaps, was his greeting to George III.:--\r\n\r\n  And now we’ll sing\r\n  God save the king,\r\n    And send him long to reign,\r\n  That he may come\r\n  To have some fun\r\n    At Montem once again.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, on account of his rhymes that Stockhore deserves to\r\nbe remembered, but on account of the fact that he was one of the last\r\nof those lowly-born characters who by their native wit, good-humour,\r\nand kindly eccentricity secured a unique place in the affections of\r\nmany far above them in rank, intellect, and wealth. The Board School\r\nhas now rendered all such humble types extinct.\r\n\r\n[SN: HERBERT STOCKHORE]\r\n\r\nStockhore had originally been a sailor, and some said also a soldier.\r\nAt any rate on “Montem” day he wore a fancy robe of various colours\r\nthrown over his old military coat, with trimmings of divers cotton\r\nribbons. An extemporised coronet, encircled with bay and crowned with\r\nfeathers, completed a costume which astounded visitors unaware of the\r\nbard’s identity. His eccentric though harmless habits rendered him a\r\npopular character with the Eton boys, and his recitation of a Montem\r\nOde was always warmly applauded, and owing to the sale of his doggerel\r\nand the contributions he received the old man led a fairly comfortable\r\nexistence. His way was first of all to set down upon paper the names of\r\nthose about to take part in “Montem” and other details furnished to him\r\nby some one in a position to know, after which he would compose a rough\r\njumble of rhyming lines. This was then submitted to some Colleger, who\r\nundertook its revision, and was printed for the author to vend, which\r\nhe did at a very remunerative price; it also formed an excuse for the\r\nextraction of coins from old friends and visitors to Eton. Stockhore,\r\nthough in his latter years, like his rhymes, much given to limping, was\r\nable to attend the Montem of 1835, at which time he had reached the\r\ngreat age of ninety.\r\n\r\nAt the next one, held in 1838, though still alive, being too feeble\r\nto go, he was represented at the great festival by a man named Ryder.\r\nThree years later, in 1841, Stockhore passed away, aged ninety-six\r\nyears. The boys then chose Edward Irvine by vote, but though he or\r\nsome other claimant was still hanging about Eton half a century ago,\r\nthe office really died with Stockhore, for his successors had no trace\r\nof the quaint and simple individuality which had been known to many\r\ngenerations of Etonians, one of whom, a few years before the famous\r\nMontem poet’s death, composed the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  Be Herbert Stockhore all my theme,\r\n    The laureate’s praises I indite;\r\n  He erst who sung in Montem’s praise,\r\n    And Thespis like, from out his cart\r\n  Recited his extempore lays\r\n    On Eton’s sons, in costume smart,\r\n  Who told of captains bold and grand,\r\n    Lieutenants, marshals, seeking salt;\r\n  Of colonels, majors, cap in hand,\r\n    Who bade e’en majesty to halt;\r\n  Told how the ensign nobly waved\r\n    The colours on the famous hill;\r\n  And names from dull oblivion saved,\r\n    Who ne’er the niche of fame can fill;\r\n  Who, like to Campbell, lends his name\r\n    To many a whim he ne’er did write;\r\n  When witty scholars, to their shame,\r\n    ’Gainst masters hurl a satire trite.\r\n  But fare thee well, Ad Montem’s bard,\r\n    Farewell, my mem’ry’s early friend;\r\n  May misery never press thee hard,\r\n    Ne’er may disease thy steps attend;\r\n  Be all thy wants by those supply’d,\r\n    Whom charity ne’er fail’d to move;\r\n  Etona’s motto, crest, and pride,\r\n    Is feeling, courage, friendship, love.\r\n  Poor harmless soul, thy merry stave\r\n    Shall live when nobler poets bend;\r\n  And when Atropos to the grave\r\n    Thy silvery locks of grey shall send,\r\n  Etona’s sons shall sing thy fame,\r\n    Ad Montem still thy verse resound,\r\n  Still live an ever-cherished name,\r\n    As long as salt and sock abound.\r\n\r\nThe “famous hill” alluded to in these verses now presents a most\r\nmelancholy appearance, its summit being vulgarised by a _châlet_ of\r\nmiserable design, whilst, as has been said, the glory of the Inns\r\nclose by has long departed. For some time after Montem days, however,\r\nthe Windmill (Botham’s) seems to have been an occasional resort of\r\nEtonians, for an interesting oak table (saved from the fire), which\r\nis now in the possession of the popular Master--Mr. Edward Littleton\r\nVaughan--has carved upon it the names of some seventy well-known\r\nEtonians, besides initials, and dates, mostly ranging from 1845\r\nto 1857. It would therefore seem that, contrary to tradition, the\r\nnames were not carved after Montem, but are rather those of boys who\r\nfrequented Botham’s, as their predecessors had frequented the old\r\nChristopher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI THE COLLEGE BUILDINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of the various changes which Eton has undergone, the old\r\nQuadrangle (till 1706 not paved but grass), which in old Montem days\r\nwas gay with a riot of high-spirited youth, has, on the whole, escaped\r\ndisfiguring alteration. The original intention of the founder was to\r\nhave a cloister in the Quadrangle; and a line of lead running beneath\r\nthe windows, together with some foundations discovered in 1876, lead\r\none to suppose that such a scheme was actually begun. On the whole, the\r\ngeneral aspect of the school-yard, which enthusiastic Etonians regard\r\nas a sort of “rose-red city half as old as time,” remains unaltered.\r\nNew, however, are the pinnacles of the Chapel and the Gothic window of\r\nthe Hall.\r\n\r\nWithin the last hundred years almost the only drastic changes have\r\nbeen those in its exterior, the western end of which was remodelled\r\nat the restoration of 1858, and the construction of a bow window for\r\nthe master residing in College, whose rooms are on the left-hand side\r\nof the Quadrangle, at the end of what was formerly the ancient Long\r\nChamber. Otherwise there is small evidence of change. The brickwork\r\nretains its old mellowed colouring, and the founder’s statue remains\r\nas grimy as ever, though perhaps a trifle less black than in the days\r\nwhen its sable hue convinced the small child of one of the College\r\nofficials that Henry VI. had been a black man. The infant in question,\r\nas a loyal son of Eton, had been taught to salute this statue (which,\r\naccording to old custom, should always be passed on the right-hand\r\nside) whenever he went through the school-yard. Out for an airing with\r\nits nurse in Windsor one day, the child, perceiving a private of one of\r\nthe West India Regiments, became convinced that it was Henry VI. in the\r\nflesh. Solemnly rising in its perambulator and reverently exclaiming\r\n“Founder,” the astounded soldier was accorded a salute which filled him\r\nwith amazement.\r\n\r\nThe feature of the Quadrangle, of course, is the fine tower of Provost\r\nLupton, under which at Election time, up to 1871, the Provost of Eton\r\nwas wont to greet the Provost of King’s with a kiss of peace, and the\r\nCaptain of the school to deliver his Latin Cloister Speech. The gates\r\nhere are closed on the death of a Provost, and not opened till his\r\nsuccessor is appointed. Carved above the window of Election Chamber,\r\nover the gateway, is a representation of the Assumption of the Virgin,\r\nto which in pre-Reformation days Collegers reverently raised their hats.\r\n\r\n[SN: THE GREEN YARD]\r\n\r\nPassing through this arch one reaches the cloisters, about which\r\nlinger so many old-world memories. Once known as the “tower cloister,”\r\nthis appellation seems in the eighteenth century to have been discarded\r\nfor that of “the Green Yard.” The railings here, of Sussex iron, were\r\nput up in 1724-25.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Cloisters of Eton College. _From a coloured print\r\ndated 1816._]\r\n\r\n[SN: CHANGES IN CLOISTERS]\r\n\r\nA good many alterations have recently been carried out in this part\r\nof the College, some of which have of necessity rather impaired its\r\nold-world charm.\r\n\r\nOn the cloister side of Lupton’s Tower a strengthening arch and support\r\nhave been built to guard against possible subsidence, some signs of\r\nwhich had begun to appear. In the cloisters also certain expedient\r\nchanges and renovations have also been made.\r\n\r\nDuring the middle of the eighteenth century an additional storey\r\nwas added to the cloister buildings, and, owing to the narrowness\r\nof the structure, communication between the new storey and the old\r\nwas eventually effected by affixing a staircase to the outside wall,\r\nin which a hole was made to give entrance to the staircase. This\r\nstaircase has now been entirely removed, and a new staircase between\r\nthe first and second floors fitted in two flights, each stretching the\r\nwhole breadth of the building. Election Hall now occupies practically\r\nthe whole of the space between Lupton’s Tower and the north side of\r\nschool-yard. Formerly there was a small room at the tower end, and a\r\npassage past this room communicating with Election Chamber on the\r\nlowest floor of the tower. This room is now part of Election Hall, most\r\nof the passage having disappeared, whilst the beautiful oak panelling\r\nhas been removed to the new staircase. The roof of Election Hall is\r\nnow higher than of yore, the increased size of the room and the bad\r\nstate of the roof having called for such an alteration. The room over\r\nElection Chamber has been converted into a sitting-room, and the\r\npartitions in it have been removed, so that it is now the same size as\r\nElection Chamber and looks out both ways. The clock remains unchanged.\r\nIn the remoter part of the house the passage has been widened, and the\r\nwalls have been stripped of the plaster and now show the old timber.\r\nA new door has also been made under the tower, giving access to a\r\nstaircase which leads straight up to the first floor.\r\n\r\nThe Provost’s Lodge has also undergone some change. The dining-room\r\nhere--the Magna Parlura--which contains portraits of various kings\r\nand provosts and occupies the centre of the Lodge, has undergone\r\nconsiderable renovation at certain periods, especially in the middle of\r\nthe last century, when it was decorated with considerable care by Dr.\r\nHawtrey. The ceiling was then painted and the panelling, reaching to\r\nthe top of the room, finished with a dado of deal, which has now been\r\nremoved, and the oak, which before was grained, scraped. The panelling\r\nhas also been lowered and now rests on the floor, the old timbers\r\nabove being visible. Two stone windows have been opened up in this\r\nroom, which had formerly been blocked by the Georgian staircase. At\r\nthe other end of the room an interesting discovery was made of another\r\nTudor door opening into the gallery just opposite the stairs. On each\r\nside of the door are Tudor windows with wooden frames. Most of the\r\ndoors opening into the gallery are of Tudor workmanship, but these are\r\nthe only two Tudor windows that have been discovered in the College.\r\nThe woodwork half-way down the staircase is of good Gothic workmanship,\r\nwhereas the staircase is of much later date. The servants’ hall, on the\r\nground floor, was formerly divided by partitions, but these have been\r\nremoved. The panelling here is of the seventeenth century, the panels\r\nlarge and tall in design. At one end of the room there is an alcove\r\nfaced with the original mirrors and containing a basin set in beautiful\r\ninlaid work of black and white marble. This, however, is covered up\r\nwith a wooden plate, which conceals the marble.\r\n\r\nAt the time of these alterations there was some talk of removing the\r\nrailings in the cloisters, which are of Sussex iron, and reviving an\r\ninner walk, traces of which have been discovered round the edge of the\r\ngrass. On the tower side the railings have already gone--the remainder,\r\nlet us hope, will be left untouched. A great feature of the cloisters\r\nis the old Cloister Pump, which, as in the days when a less luxurious\r\nrace of Collegers washed at its spout, continues to yield the best\r\nwater in Eton. This old pump is associated with the cry of “Cloister\r\nP!” at which the lowest boy present had to fetch a canful of the sacred\r\nwater, the cry which sent every fag in Long Chamber tearing down\r\nSixth-Form passage. Not very far away is the well-worn stone staircase\r\nup which so many generations of Collegers have made their way into the\r\nHall, which, in spite of renovation, still retains a certain amount of\r\ninterest for those fond of relics of another age.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of the existing structure dates from about 1450,\r\nand to some extent follows the design favoured by King Henry VI. The\r\nfounder’s original idea, however, was that a northern bay window should\r\nface the southern one. He also contemplated a porch with a tower over\r\nit. One must be thankful that at the restoration of 1858 the College\r\nauthorities did not attempt to carry out these plans.\r\n\r\nThe early architectural history of the Hall is somewhat puzzling.\r\nFor some undiscovered reason it was begun in stone and finished in\r\nbrick, whilst three large fireplaces were constructed but never used,\r\nbeing covered with panelling till the so-called restoration of the\r\nlast century. In 1721 some alterations were carried out according\r\nto the plan of a Mr. Rowland, but from that time till 1858 the Hall\r\nremained as it is shown in the illustration facing page 164. At that\r\ndate, however, the Rev. Mr. Wilder, the Fellow who had contributed so\r\nliberally to the modernisation of the interior of the College Chapel,\r\nturned his attention to the old building, which was restored at his\r\nexpense. It is to be regretted that a good deal of Renaissance work of\r\nhistorical interest then disappeared, retaining some features of the\r\noriginal design constructed in its place.\r\n\r\nFor some unexplained reason (apparently it was in fair repair) the old\r\nroof was destroyed, and a new one substituted. The simple three-light\r\nRenaissance west window, with a curious ornamented ledge beneath,\r\ngave way to an elaborate Gothic window, filled with stained glass\r\nrepresenting the very “apocryphal” story of Henry VII.’s Eton days.\r\nBeneath this was erected an elaborate screen of panelling, decorated\r\nwith the arms of successive provosts. The rest of the old panelling\r\nwas allowed to remain, though, owing to a very thorough process of\r\nrenovation, a great proportion of the present woodwork is modern. Along\r\nthe top of the panelling may still be seen a number of old nails. From\r\nthese, according to an old Eton custom, Collegers at Shrovetide used\r\nto hang scrolls of Bacchus verses which were suspended by coloured\r\nribbons. These Bacchus verses, written in praise or abuse of the jovial\r\ndeity, continued to be written in the earlier portion of the last\r\ncentury, though by that time their character had changed.\r\n\r\n[SN: BACCHUS VERSES]\r\n\r\nThe art of verse-writing was held in the highest esteem at Eton, and\r\nwas, together with accurate prosody, the road to distinction. False\r\nquantities were considered crimes. In the _Etonian_ Praed had some\r\nclever lines as to this in his poem, “The Eve of Battle”:--\r\n\r\n  And still in spite of all thy care,\r\n  False quantities will haunt thee there,\r\n  For thou wilt make amidst the throng\r\n  Or ζωή short or κλέος long.\r\n\r\nA copy of Bacchus verses composed by Porson on the subject of Cyrus\r\nexulting over captive Babylon is preserved in the library. Pepys noted\r\nthese Bacchus verses in 1666:--\r\n\r\n  To the Hall, and there find the boys’ verses, “De Peste,” it being\r\n  their custom to make verses at Shrovetide. I read several, and very\r\n  good they were, better, I think, than ever I made when I was a boy,\r\n  and in rolls as long, or longer, than the whole Hall by much. Here is\r\n  a picture of Venice hung up, and a monument made by Sir H. Wotton’s\r\n  giving it to the College.\r\n\r\nThis picture was moved many years ago, and now hangs in Election Hall.\r\nBeneath it is the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n  Henricus Wottonius post tres apud Venetos Legationes ordinarias in\r\n  Etonensis Collegii beato sinu senescens, eiusque cum suavissima inter\r\n  Se Sociosque concordia annos iam XII. Praefectus Hanc miram Vrbis\r\n  quasi natantis effigiem in aliquam sui memoriam iuxta Socialem Mensam\r\n  affixit, 1636.\r\n\r\nOn the picture itself may be seen the words, “Opus Odoardus Fialettus,\r\n1611.”\r\n\r\nNear the oriel window there still stands the iron reading-desk from\r\nwhich in old times a scholar used to read out passages of Holy Writ. In\r\nearly days he appears to have been known as “the Bibler.”\r\n\r\n[SN: BURNT TAPESTRY]\r\n\r\nBefore the restoration of the Hall two pieces of tapestry given by a\r\nFellow--Adam Robyns--in 1613 used to be hung beneath the west window\r\nat Election time. They represented the flight into Egypt and Christ\r\nteaching in the Temple. When the Hall had been restored and the\r\nornate modern panelling or screen set up where this tapestry used to\r\nhang, it was relegated to the bake-house. This was burnt in 1875, and\r\nthe tapestry, together with the green rugs given to the Collegers\r\nby the Duke of Cumberland in 1735, were utterly destroyed in the\r\nconflagration. These rugs or coverlets were edged with gold braid and\r\nembroidered with the College arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The College Hall before Restoration. _From an old\r\nprint._]\r\n\r\nUp to the period of the modern alterations the Hall was warmed by a\r\ncircular charcoal brazier standing beneath the louvre or opening in the\r\nroof. In 1858, however, the three large fireplaces discovered behind\r\nthe panelling were taken into use; they had never had chimneys before.\r\nHot-water pipes now also assist to warm the Hall.\r\n\r\nOn the walls hang some eighteen portraits, all of Collegers except two,\r\nrepresenting George III. and Sir Thomas Smith. The Rev. John Wilder,\r\nthe well-meaning Fellow who spent such large sums of money in altering\r\nand restoring Hall and Chapel, is commemorated by a brass in the\r\nsouth-west corner.\r\n\r\nOn the right in the Hall is a small table called the “Servitor’s Desk.”\r\nThe duty attached to the old office of Servitor consists in noting\r\ndown in a book the commons allowed for each day’s dinner according\r\nto the number actually dining in Hall. He counts by “messes” and\r\n“half-messes,” a mess consisting of four boys. It is the practice of\r\nmost Servitors to carve their name on the desk, and among the names\r\ncarved are those of A. C. Benson, author and poet, and J. K. Stephen.\r\n\r\nA few of the old customs are retained, the authorities still sitting at\r\nthe high table at the west end. The Sixth Form sit at the first table\r\non the left side, carving their own joint; one of them says Grace,\r\nshouting “Surgite! Benedicat Deus” at the beginning of the meal, and\r\n“Surgite! Benedicatur Deo” at the end, when the others reply, “Deo\r\nGratias.” On Sundays a Latin Grace is chanted. The fare of Collegers\r\nformerly consisted almost[4] exclusively of mutton, from which arose\r\nthe term “Tug-mutton,” and “Tug” applied to a King’s scholar.\r\n\r\n[SN: “HARPY-PIES”]\r\n\r\nWithin the last three decades three ancient usages have been abandoned.\r\nThe first of these was “Bever,” which was abolished in 1890. “Bever”\r\nconsisted in a modest collation of bread and salt and beer in “after\r\nfours” in the summer; Collegers might partake of this if they wished,\r\nand were allowed to invite guests. A second old usage which disappeared\r\nabout the same time was that of certain boys receiving a double\r\nallowance of bread. Though most of the old oak panelling of Hall was\r\nreplaced by new in 1858, amongst the old panels was one which for\r\nmore than three hundred years had proclaimed the privilege of the mess\r\nof four boys which dined nearest to the door on the north side of the\r\nHall, “Queen Elizabethe ad nos gave October x 2 loves in a mes 1596,”\r\nbeing roughly inscribed upon it. Commemorating the munificence of the\r\nvirgin Queen for more than three hundred years, two loaves, instead\r\nof the customary one loaf, were set before the four boys sitting near\r\nthe panel. This practice has now been ended. The third old custom was\r\nof a far less pleasant character, and its disappearance is not to be\r\ndeplored. Formerly, after the Collegers had dined, a number of old\r\nalmswomen were allowed to collect the remains, and in consequence the\r\nHall was at certain times thronged with a mass of old women thrusting\r\nchunks of bread and scraps of broken meat into bags. The whole thing\r\nwas a somewhat unseemly scramble. The boys were often not very well\r\ndisposed to the harpies, as they called the old ladies, and would\r\nwickedly make them what were known as “hag-traps” and “harpy-pies.”\r\nThe composition of these was a masterpiece of diabolical ingenuity.\r\nA large square piece of bread or quarter loaf having had its centre\r\nhollowed out by means of a hole in the side, the interior was cunningly\r\nfilled with an unsavoury mixture of mustard, pepper, cayenne, and\r\nwhatever else came to hand, after which the opening was cleverly closed\r\nso that the bread might present a totally unsuspicious appearance and\r\nthen left lying about amongst genuine loaves. Though the old ladies\r\nhad considerable experience of various disagreeable forms of College\r\nhumour, this wicked device always secured a certain amount of success.\r\nAt the present time the female pensioners are given a small monetary\r\nallowance in place of being allowed to enter the Hall.\r\n\r\n[SN: AN UNAPPRECIATED POET]\r\n\r\nThe Upper School occupies the whole of the west side of the\r\nschool-yard, with the exception of the space covered by the\r\nheadmaster’s room at the north end. It was originally built by\r\nProvost Allestree, but so faultily that it had to be rebuilt under\r\nhis successor, Provost Cradock, in 1694. Though by some attributed\r\nto him, the architect was probably not Sir Christopher Wren; yet the\r\nstyle adopted, very different from that of the other buildings in the\r\nschool-yard, is that associated with his name. Though now only rarely\r\nused, Upper School was formerly the principal class-room of Eton, and\r\nat the beginning of the nineteenth century no less than 400 boys were\r\ntaught there at the same time. The ground floor beneath is now occupied\r\nby rooms which in the last century were considered quite good enough to\r\naccommodate large “divisions,” but have now been turned into a “school\r\noffice,” a porter’s lodge, and store-rooms of various kinds. On the\r\nfloor above is the “Upper School” itself, approached at the south end\r\nby a fine staircase--a well-proportioned room, lined with oak panelling\r\nwhich has served for the recording of many Eton names, and adorned\r\nwith the busts of Etonians who have served their country. The first of\r\nthese busts was put up in 1840, when the Marquess Wellesley presented\r\nhis to the school--his brother, the Duke of Wellington, shortly\r\nafterwards following his example. Most of the great Etonians are here,\r\nincluding Shelley. It is said that when the idea of erecting the poet’s\r\nbust was first mooted, Dr. Hornby objected, saying that Shelley was a\r\nbad man, and he only wished he had been educated at Harrow. The memory\r\nof this poet--in former days, at least--was not held in any particular\r\nrespect by the vast majority of Etonians, most of whom held much the\r\nsame views about him as have been attributed to Dr. Hornby.\r\n\r\nSome thirty years ago, when the subject of the amenities of Eton was\r\nbeing discussed by a House Debating Society, an Upper boy--now a\r\nwell-known Peer--brought the debate to a close with a breezy speech.\r\nEton, he said, was in his opinion a very good place; all boys were\r\nhappy there, or ought to be. As far as he could make out, all boys\r\nalways had been happy there, and he had only heard of one who wasn’t,\r\nand that was “a boy called Shelley, who was a mad fool.” He then sat\r\ndown amidst applause.\r\n\r\nAn immense quantity of names are cut on the woodwork of Upper School.\r\nMost of these are those of boys who became famous in after life. The\r\nname of Charles James Fox, for instance, is to be seen beneath his\r\nbust. Gladstone’s may easily be recognised among a number of other\r\nnames of the same family by the fact that there was not sufficient room\r\nleft for the whole name, and consequently the last three letters are\r\ncut much smaller than the rest. Lord Roberts’s name is on the large\r\nsouth door, and Shelley’s under Lord Wellesley’s bust, to the right,\r\nand again high up, to the left, beneath his own bust. Gladstone’s name,\r\nit should be added, is on the upper right-hand panel of the door which\r\nstands to the left as you face the Headmaster’s desk in the Upper\r\nSchool. His sons have their names cut on the same door close by. This\r\ncarving was not done by Gladstone himself, but by Dr. Keate’s servant\r\nin requital for a fee. Originally boys, before leaving, cut their\r\nnames where they liked in Upper School. Later on, as in the writer’s\r\ntime, it was the custom on leaving to present the Headmaster’s servant\r\nwith a guinea to have this done. The present practice seems to be that\r\nfor half a guinea a specially appointed official cuts a boy’s name.\r\nClose to Upper School, on the top of the staircase leading to the\r\nHeadmaster’s room, may be seen the name Lord Dalmeny cut twice on the\r\nleft, opposite the door; the older is that of Lord Rosebery, the newer\r\nthat of his son.\r\n\r\n[SN: LOWER SCHOOL]\r\n\r\nThe original Eton schoolroom was the present Lower School, which\r\nhappily remains practically in its original state. The exact date of\r\nits erection is uncertain, but it would appear to have been built\r\nsomewhere about the end of the fourteenth century. According to an old\r\ntradition Lower School was once the College stables, and it was Sir\r\nHenry Wotton who, when Provost, fitted it up with pillars, on which he\r\nis supposed to have painted pictures of Greek and Roman authors for\r\nthe instruction of the boys. This quaint old room was formerly open\r\nfor its full length, and looked very picturesque with its double row\r\nof oaken pillars supporting the floor of the chamber above, and deeply\r\nrecessed windows, the oaken shutters, as well as the pillars, graven\r\nwith the names of former Etonians. For two centuries it was the only\r\nschoolroom. In recent times, for convenience of teaching, it has been\r\nturned into three rooms by means of deal partitions. These, however,\r\nbeing merely temporary erections, have not injured the ancient fabric\r\nof the room. Many generations of boys have amused themselves by poking\r\npens and knives into the deep chinks of the pillars and spearing out\r\nbits of paper that had been thrust in there by boys of bygone times.\r\nMr. Brinsley Richards has described how, as a boy at Eton, he extracted\r\nthe fragment of a play-bill, issued by a strolling troupe who performed\r\nat Windsor Fair in 1769. In the writer’s day many a boy, unconsciously\r\nimbued with that love of sending messages to posterity which is such a\r\ncharacteristic of youth, would write his name upon a scrap of paper and\r\npoke it deep into a hole or cranny.\r\n\r\nNumerous names carved on the shutters and pillars of this room are\r\nstriking links with the remote past. The names in question, it would\r\nappear, are in the vast majority of instances those of Collegers\r\nelected from Eton to King’s. They begin on the westernmost window on\r\nthe north side, the earliest name discoverable being that of Kemp,\r\n1577, somewhere about the middle of the shutter. On the first shutter\r\non the left-hand side of the third room is the mark of a name which\r\nhas been erased. This is supposed to have been that of Greenhall, who,\r\nleaving King’s College, became a highwayman and was captured, hanged,\r\nand dissected.\r\n\r\nSamuel Pepys, who visited Eton in 1666, was very pleased with Lower\r\nSchool. This favourable impression is recorded in his diary:--\r\n\r\n  All mighty fine. The School good, and the custom pretty of boys\r\n  cutting their names in the shuts of the window when they go to\r\n  Cambridge, by which many a one hath lived to see himself a Provost\r\n  and Fellow, that hath his name in the window standing.\r\n\r\nOver Lower School was the ancient “Long Chamber,” now turned into\r\nthe junior Collegers’ dormitory. It once extended the whole length\r\nof the school-yard, with the exception of the space occupied by the\r\nHeadmaster’s chamber at the west end, and that of the Lower Master at\r\nthe east. Its length was considerably lessened in 1844, and since that\r\ntime it has been divided by partitions into “stalls” or “cubicles,” so\r\nthat little of the original appearance of the interior remains.\r\n\r\nWhen Long Chamber was broken up into cubicles, old Plumtre, one of the\r\nFellows, preached a sermon on the text, “And Elisha said, Let every man\r\ntake unto himself a beam, for the place we have made is too strait for\r\nus.” Plumtre was a staunch old Tory, who hated the Reform Bill. For one\r\nwhole night he walked round and round the Eton cloisters, praying and\r\nwaiting for the expected news of its defeat.\r\n\r\n[SN: THE CHAPEL]\r\n\r\nThe Eton College Chapel was built in 1441, the foundation-stone being\r\nlaid by King Henry VI. in person on Passion Sunday of that year. It\r\nwas finished by Waynflete, who was Eton’s benefactor till his death\r\nin 1484. Owing no doubt to lack of means, the latter curtailed the\r\noriginal design, which provided for a nave 168 feet long stretching\r\ndown what is now Keate’s Lane and finished the building with the\r\nAnte-Chapel, which still remains. A wooden rood-loft was erected over\r\nthe chancel arch, with a crucifix between wooden figures of St. Mary\r\nand St. John, whilst stalls and frescoes, ordered to be wiped out\r\nin 1560, completed an interior which must have been beautiful and\r\npicturesque. Lupton’s Chapel, in which is Provost Lupton’s brass, was\r\nbuilt by him in 1515. Here is now the tablet giving the names of those\r\nwho fell in the South African War.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Reformation there was naturally a good deal of\r\niconoclastic destruction, and at the end of the seventeenth century\r\nthe Chapel had suffered severely from dilapidation and neglect. In\r\n1699-1700, under Provost Godolphin, however, a general remodelling\r\nof the Chapel had been undertaken, it would seem probable, under the\r\ndirection of Wren. In the course of the alterations the floor would\r\nappear to have been raised, whilst the walls were covered nearly up to\r\nthe windows with panelling of simple though good design. A classical\r\norgan-loft with fine decorative carving was at that time placed across\r\nthe choir near the second window from the west end.\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth century the interior of the Eton Chapel\r\nevoked nothing but praise, but with the mania for restoration which\r\ncharacterised the Victorian era, some desire for drastic alterations\r\nbegan to make itself felt. Whilst the general appearance of the\r\nChapel was dignified and stately, there were undoubtedly certain\r\ndisfigurements, the chief amongst them two great box-like pews at the\r\neast end, specially allotted to the male and female College servants.\r\nAn elaborate altar-piece of inlaid wood, entirely concealing the east\r\nend, though good of its kind, was somewhat heavy and out of place. Good\r\nor bad, however, all the woodwork was soon to disappear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Oak Panelling formerly in Eton Chapel, now in\r\nEntrance Hall of Frampton Court, Dorset.]\r\n\r\n[SN: “NOBS”]\r\n\r\nIn 1842, when the so-called Gothic revival first began to sweep\r\nover England, destroying much worthy to be preserved and creating\r\ncomparatively little of artistic merit, it was determined to restore\r\nthe Chapel. At first this was limited to tearing down the classical\r\naltar-piece, pews, and panelling at the east end and erecting\r\nponderous so-called Gothic altar rails, pulpit, and the like, all\r\nof stone. These, however, were discarded a few years later, when, in\r\n1847, a regular scheme of destruction and innovation was undertaken\r\nby Deeson, one of whose chief artistic crimes was tearing down the\r\nnoblemen’s stalls, then standing against the walls at the western end.\r\nUp to the so-called restoration of 1847, boys who were noblemen or\r\nbaronets used to occupy special seats of honour ranged along the Chapel\r\nwalls. When one of these privileged youths--known as “Nobs”--first\r\ntook his seat in one of these stalls he would, according to immemorial\r\ncustom, distribute amongst his neighbours small packets of almonds and\r\nraisins, called “Chapel sock,” which were eaten in the Chapel itself.\r\nThese seats, finely designed with carving at the top, were ruthlessly\r\ntorn down, whilst no exact record of their appearance was preserved. A\r\nconsiderable portion of the panelling, which formerly covered the east\r\nend, adorns the hall at Frampton Park, Dorchester, but the writer has\r\nbeen unable to trace the noblemen’s seats which were swept away to make\r\nroom for the present stalls.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of the College authorities in having discarded work\r\nof high artistic interest, probably designed by Wren, is much to be\r\ndeplored. The evidence as to Wren having designed the panelling is\r\nnot absolutely conclusive, but much leads one to think that he was\r\nconcerned in its design. The Mr. Banks, “surveyor,” whose name has\r\nbeen preserved as the designer of the costly woodwork, is probably\r\nidentical with Matthew Bankes, “master carpenter,” who, under Wren’s\r\ndirection, carried out the interior decoration and fitting of\r\nKensington Palace, Hampton Court, and other historical buildings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Carved and Decorated Organ Case formerly in Eton Chapel.\r\n_Specially photographed for this work with the kind permission of the\r\nVery Rev. Felix Couturier, Prior of the Dominican Monastery of St.\r\nThomas, Rugeley._]\r\n\r\n[SN: THE OLD ORGAN CASE]\r\n\r\nThe huge organ-loft, about twenty-five feet in depth, was approached\r\nby a flight of steps, which Provost Godolphin placed across the church\r\nwithin the choir. This loft or screen was a very fine piece of work,\r\nwith fluted columns of oak, two of which are preserved in the Victoria\r\nand Albert Museum, and elaborate carving, by Grinling Gibbons, much\r\nresembling the one which still remains at Trinity College, Cambridge.\r\nThe organ-case, which, curiously enough, has hitherto escaped all\r\ndetailed notice in books about Eton, was of oak, and consisted of four\r\ntowers and three flats of pipes--the pipe shades, lower frieze scrolls,\r\nside brackets and centre shield of arms being beautifully carved and\r\nwell designed, while characteristically English in style. Above was a\r\nscroll ending in a point, for the carving of which Bird (who executed\r\nmuch fine woodwork under the direction of Sir Christopher Wren) was\r\npaid £24 in 1703. The organ itself, built by either William Smith or\r\nFather Smith, was erected in 1700, and cost a large sum of money for\r\nthat day. This organ and its beautiful case is specially mentioned\r\nin _Organ-Cases and Organs of the Middle Ages and Renaissance_, the\r\nerudite and artistic work written and illustrated by the greatest\r\nEnglish authority on the subject, Mr. A. G. Hill, who speaks of the\r\nold Eton College organ as being perhaps the best of all similar organs\r\nstill remaining in England. It may be mentioned that the example\r\nformerly at Whitehall, and now in St. Peter’s Church at the Tower\r\nof London, much resembles it. After the Eton Chapel restoration of\r\n1844-1847 this old organ, with its beautiful case, was discarded in\r\norder to make way for a new one which was placed half-way up the choir\r\non the south side. No one seems to have thought the old organ worth\r\npreserving, and the case was eventually found by a member of the famous\r\norgan-building firm of Hill, lying about in bits in the yard of those\r\nwho had taken it down. Mr. Hill at once recognised the high artistic\r\nvalue of the magnificent woodwork, and, after the various portions of\r\nthe case had been fitted together, adapted it to a new organ, which\r\npassed into the possession of the late Mr. Josiah Spode, of Hawkesyard\r\nPark, Rugeley, who put it up in his hall. Mr. Spode left his property\r\nto his niece, with a proviso that at her death a certain portion should\r\nbe applied to founding a monastery. This lady, however, preferred to\r\ncarry out this wish during her own lifetime, and, expending a far\r\nlarger sum than was stipulated by the will, founded at Rugeley the\r\nDominican Monastery of St. Thomas, in the beautiful chapel of which\r\nthe old Eton organ-case was put up. In connection with its history it\r\nis curious to recall that this splendid specimen of Jacobean woodwork\r\nwas thrown out of the Eton Chapel because it was supposed to be “out\r\nof place” in a Gothic building. The Chapel at Rugeley is a singularly\r\nsuccessful example of modern Gothic at its best, and the organ-case\r\naccords perfectly with its surroundings. A feature of the old case,\r\nadorned with scrolls and carvings lovingly wrought by the hand of a\r\nmaster craftsman of a past age, is its heraldic embellishment, the\r\nornamentation including three shields bearing coats of arms. The large\r\ncentral one at the top shows the Royal arms of England, enriched by the\r\nlegend “Honi soit qui mal y pense.” The smaller left-hand shield in the\r\nhands of an angel at the bottom of the case bears the familiar arms of\r\nEton, whilst another on the right-hand side shows those of the sister\r\nfoundation of King’s.\r\n\r\nAfter the Eton authorities had cleared their Chapel of all the old\r\nJacobean woodwork, they turned their attention to the roof, it being\r\nat first proposed to construct a new one of stone. Happily, however,\r\nfear of the Chapel collapsing checked such a scheme, and the architect,\r\nDeeson, merely stripped the paint and plaster from the roof, whilst\r\nadding some pseudo-Gothic cusping.\r\n\r\n[SN: A RUTHLESS RESTORATION]\r\n\r\nThe interior of the Chapel as it appeared before 1700 in no wise\r\nresembled that which we at present see. Mural monuments abounded about\r\nthe chancel; these, after being concealed by the wainscoting put up in\r\n1700, were ruthlessly torn from their places by those responsible for\r\nthe restoration of 1847. Some of them are in the Ante-Chapel, others\r\nwere totally swept away. In the original Chapel there were probably\r\nonly benches at the east end, whilst low wooden stalls with miserere\r\nseats occupied the place of the present seats crowned by canopies. The\r\nonly remnants of the ancient woodwork appear to be some old wooden\r\nforms in the Ante-Chapel, on which boys now leave their hats. It is\r\nrecorded that in 1625 Thomas Weaver, a “Fellow,” gave “four strong\r\nforms to stand in the aisles of the Church for the townsmen to sit on.”\r\nThe seats in question, it should be added, seem originally to have been\r\nintended for the townspeople of Eton, who then attended the Chapel as\r\ntheir parish church.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Chapel before Restoration. _Engraved by D. Havell\r\nafter E. Mackenzie._]\r\n\r\nAbove the low stalls were paintings, and these in 1560 the College\r\nbarber was ordered to wash out; his account for the work (6s. 8d.) is\r\nstill extant. The barber, however, merely covered up the designs with\r\nwhite paint or whitewash, and when the fine old stalls were removed the\r\npaintings could be clearly seen upon the wall behind. In 1847, however,\r\nin order to produce a surface capable of showing up the canopies of\r\nthe new stalls then in course of erection, the workmen proceeded to\r\nscrape out all trace of the ancient designs, and they had already\r\nfinished this work of destruction at the top of the walls beneath the\r\nstring-courses when a Fellow of the College, chancing to stroll in to\r\ninspect the work, saved the rest, some of which still remains behind\r\nthe modern panelling, of which the Eton authorities have certainly\r\nvery little reason to be proud. After the discovery there was for a\r\ntime some idea of leaving the paintings exposed to view, or at least\r\ncontriving an arrangement of sliding panels. Provost Hodgson, however,\r\nobjected to them as being “superstitious,” and they were consequently\r\npermanently covered by the present panelling. The designs, which were\r\nfortunately sketched before being covered up, have been described\r\nas the finest of the kind ever discovered in England. They were in\r\nall probability the work of some Florentine artist of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. Each row of paintings was divided longitudinally into\r\nseventeen compartments, alternately wide and narrow. Concerning these\r\nSir Maxwell Lyte, in his excellent history of the College, writes:--\r\n\r\n  The former contained historical compositions, the latter single\r\n  figures of Saints represented as standing in canopied niches. Most\r\n  of these Saints may be identified by their emblems. Under each of\r\n  the large compartments there was a Latin inscription, explaining the\r\n  subject of the picture, and giving a reference to the book whence its\r\n  story was derived. The works most frequently quoted were the _Legenda\r\n  Sanctorum_ and Vincent of Beauvais’ _Speculum Historiale_, one of the\r\n  earliest productions of the printing-press, which had already gone\r\n  through three editions before 1479. According to a practice which\r\n  prevailed extensively in the fifteenth century, successive incidents\r\n  of a story were often represented as forming only one scene, the\r\n  same figure appearing two or three times in different combinations.\r\n  The whole series was intended to exemplify the gracious protection\r\n  afforded by the Blessed Virgin, the Patroness of the College, to\r\n  her votaries in all ages and countries. No less than six of the\r\n  compartments were occupied by scenes from the life of a mythical\r\n  Roman Empress.\r\n\r\n[SN: GROSS VANDALISM]\r\n\r\nFrom first to last the so-called restoration cost over £20,000,\r\n£5000 of which was contributed by Mr. Wilder. In reality it was no\r\nrestoration at all--merely a terrible act of vandalism, only exceeded\r\nin lack of taste by the alterations carried out at the sister college\r\nof Winchester some thirty years later, when all the priceless woodwork\r\nwas removed from the chapel. Within recent years this was sold for an\r\nenormous sum, and is now at Hursley Park, not many miles away from the\r\nCollege which it once adorned.\r\n\r\nBesides the tearing down of the fine old panelling and the partial\r\ndestruction of ancient frescoes, in all probability a quantity of other\r\ninteresting old work was destroyed at the orgy of iconoclasm in 1847.\r\nThe only object of those in power at Eton at that time seems to have\r\nbeen to destroy everything which recalled the past. They gloried in the\r\nhavoc they wrought within the Chapel, and in their “restoring fervour”\r\nactually went so far as to tear up the black and white marble pavement.\r\nIt is to be hoped that some day this may be replaced. Would that some\r\nportion of the fine old woodwork might be recovered and once again find\r\na place in the sacred edifice where for close upon a hundred and fifty\r\nyears it met the eyes of generations of Etonians!\r\n\r\nIn place of the stately old noblemen’s seats put up in 1700, Deeson\r\ndesigned seventy oak stalls with carved canopies of modern Gothic\r\ndesign. Each canopy seems to have cost £42, which, considering that the\r\nartistic value of the stalls is exactly nil, is a large sum. It would\r\nbe interesting to know what the value of the noblemen’s stalls which\r\nDeeson tore down would be at the present time!\r\n\r\nEntering the Chapel through the screen, the first of the canopied\r\nstalls on the right is that occupied by the Provost, that on the\r\nleft by the Vice-Provost. The second stall on the right was given by\r\nthe Fellows of King’s College, the third by Winchester College, and\r\nthe fourth by the President and Fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford,\r\nlike Eton connected with the memory of Waynflete. The Headmaster’s\r\nstall is the seventeenth on the right, distinguished by the words\r\n_Magister Informator_. Exactly opposite is the seat of the Lower master\r\n(_Ostiarius_), who, however, usually attends Lower Chapel. A number\r\nof the stalls given by Etonians or Etonian families have tablets with\r\ninscriptions. Next but two to the Lower master, for instance, is a\r\nstall given by the Cust family, of whom some eight generations have\r\nbeen educated at Eton. Beneath the seat is to be found the genealogy\r\nof all the Custs who have been at the school. The twenty-sixth stall\r\non either side are those of the chaplains (_Capellani Conductitii_),\r\nknown as “Conducts” at Eton. The last stall but one on the left was\r\ngiven by James Rattee, the contractor for the stalls, and the one\r\nopposite by Deeson, the architect, who no doubt thought that his\r\nimitation Gothic was vastly superior to the stately work which he\r\ntreated with such contempt.\r\n\r\n[SN: MACHINE-MADE GOTHIC]\r\n\r\nMost of the alterations in the Eton Chapel were lamentable in the\r\nextreme. Nevertheless they excited great admiration amongst many who\r\nhad sat there in its unrestored days. Apparently they were quite\r\nsatisfied that the fine old panelling, in all probability designed by\r\nWren, should be removed. One of these lovers of novelty wrote: “Those\r\nwho only know the Chapel in its present nobly restored state could\r\nwith difficulty go back to the simply glazed windows, bare walls,\r\nand cold cheerless aspect of the whole interior in former times.”[5]\r\nHow such a “noble restoration” (consisting in the destruction of\r\nevery vestige of ancient woodwork in order to substitute a quantity\r\nof machine-made-looking Gothic stalls and some poor cusping to the\r\nroof) can have moved any one to enthusiasm it is almost impossible to\r\nunderstand. Nor can the crudely coloured stained-glass windows be said\r\nto be a great improvement upon the old plain glass, which at least\r\ncaused no pain to the eye.\r\n\r\nThe true and artistic restoration would have been to have retained the\r\nold stalls against the western walls, while contriving a method by\r\nwhich portions of it could be temporarily removed in order to afford a\r\nview of the frescoes. The high box-like pews might have been modified,\r\nthe old woodwork being utilised to the utmost extent, or at least\r\npreserved for use in other parts of the College. If the position of\r\nthe stately old organ-loft opposite the second window of the west end\r\nwas found to be absolutely unsuited to modern requirements, together\r\nwith its wooden pilasters of admirable design, it might have been\r\nre-erected at the junction of the choir with the Ante-Chapel, the\r\nstalls being continued farther back. As for the magnificent organ-case,\r\nthere would have been no difficulty, as has been proved at Rugeley,\r\nabout furnishing it with a modern interior and new pipes. The roof\r\nshould have merely been freed from paint, etc., and not been adorned\r\nwith the meaningless cusping, which, never contemplated by its original\r\ndesigner, is so obviously out of place.\r\n\r\nThe present organ-screen, erected in 1882 by Mr. G. E. Street in memory\r\nof Etonians who fell in the Zulu, Afghan, and Boer wars of 1879, 1880,\r\nand 1881, cannot be called a masterpiece of architectural design,\r\nbut in certain other respects the interior of the Chapel has been\r\nsomewhat improved within recent years. An elaborately designed floor\r\nof black and white marble has been laid down at the east end. This,\r\ntogether with a handsome if not altogether appropriate altar, forms\r\npart of the memorial to the Etonians who fell in the South African War\r\n(1899-1902). As stated before, the names of those who died for their\r\ncountry in this deplorable contest are inscribed upon a roll of honour\r\nin Lupton Chapel.\r\n\r\nThe fine tapestry behind the altar, executed by the firm of William\r\nMorris from the designs of the late Sir Edward Burne-Jones, was\r\npresented by an art-loving Eton Master, Mr. H. E. Luxmoore, in 1895,\r\nwhilst the picture of Sir Galahad, hanging on the western wall, was\r\npresented by its painter, Watts.\r\n\r\nThe great stained-glass east window--a source of grumbling and\r\ndiscontent to several generations of Etonians, who were obliged to\r\ncontribute what was known as “window-money”--was executed by Willement\r\nbetween 1844 and 1849, being set up in bits as the contributions wrung\r\nfrom the boys increased. Within recent years the crude and violent\r\ntints of this costly example of the work of a bad period have been\r\nsoftened. The irregular curve of the external arch-mould over this\r\nwindow is said to be due to the circumstance that when the College\r\nChapel was built the stones of the Parish Church (which stood in the\r\npresent graveyard and was built in 1441) were used over again.\r\n\r\n[SN: A TRANSPARENT FAILURE]\r\n\r\nIf the great east window is now somewhat less of a “transparent\r\nfailure” than of yore, the other windows on the north and south sides\r\nof the Chapel remain specimens of bad design and colour. Those in\r\nthe Ante-Chapel, however, are less glaring. The two large windows by\r\nHardman on the north and south form the memorial to Etonians who fell\r\nin the Crimea; those at the west end are personal memorials. Below\r\nthese windows are a number of tablets commemorating Etonians of note.\r\nOn the floor of the Ante-Chapel is a fine slab to the memory of the\r\nlate Bishop Abraham. There is also a marble statue of the Founder, by\r\nDurham, and another of Provost Goodall, who in all probability would\r\nhave been appalled by the changes of 1847.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. John Wilder, whose munificence served to modernise the College\r\nChapel he had known all his life, is also here commemorated by a\r\ntablet. Besides giving £5000 to the restoration fund, he presented\r\nfourteen stained-glass windows in the choir, and decorated the reredos\r\nand east end as well as the new organ and case. Though his benefactions\r\nwere animated by a generous and unselfish spirit, it is much to be\r\nregretted that he did not devote his money to some better purpose.\r\n\r\n[SN: THE LOST FONT]\r\n\r\nIn the Ante-Chapel, behind a railing, is a font, placed there at\r\nthe time of the renovations sixty years ago. It was presented by\r\nsome Collegers as a memorial to C. J. Abraham. The last baptism for\r\nwhich it was used took place two or three years ago, when an Eton\r\nboy of fourteen or fifteen was christened in the Chapel. About to be\r\nconfirmed, it was discovered that he had never been baptized. In all\r\nprobability he was a foreigner. There stood previously at the same\r\nplace an older font, of which there is mention as early as 1479.\r\nLipscomb describes the earlier one as “a beautiful ancient font of\r\nwhite marble, of an octagon shape, elegantly carved in relief and\r\nsupported by a pedestal on a square plinth.” It would be interesting to\r\nknow what has become of this font. If not broken up, it has probably\r\nbeen sent away to some village church.\r\n\r\nIn the Ante-Chapel, before the Reformation, there existed four altars,\r\nthe chief of which, still marked by a row of niches, was in the\r\nsouth-eastern corner behind where now stands the statue of Provost\r\nGoodall. This was called the Altar of St. Catherine, or sometimes the\r\nAltar of Thomas Jourdelay, after a certain inhabitant of Eton who lies\r\nburied near it. Provost Bost (1477-1504) left a sum of money for an\r\nextra chaplain who should say Mass at this altar at least three times a\r\nweek for him and his relations. The altar in the north-eastern corner\r\nof the Ante-Chapel was dedicated to the Blessed Virgin. The remaining\r\ntwo were on either side of the entrance to the choir and were dedicated\r\nto St. Nicholas and St. Peter.\r\n\r\nOne of the few relics which the spirit of change has left intact in\r\nthis old Chapel is the lectern, which within recent years has once\r\nmore been taken into use. It dates from the fifteenth century, and\r\nescaped destruction by the Puritans in 1651, when the College paid\r\nsixpence for its removal. A considerable number of Etonians are\r\nfittingly commemorated in the Chapel, but the Marquis Wellesley, in\r\nall probability the greatest lover of Eton who ever lived, has his\r\nmemorial in the North Porch, where may be seen the Latin elegiacs which\r\nhe wrote as his own epitaph. The tablet on which they are inscribed was\r\nerected by his brother, the great Duke. A good rendering in English\r\nverse was made by Lord Derby:--\r\n\r\n  Long tost on Fortune’s waves, I come to rest,\r\n  Eton, once more on thy maternal breast.\r\n  On loftiest deeds to fix the aspiring gaze,\r\n  To seek the purer lights of ancient days,\r\n  To love the simple paths of manly truth,--\r\n  These were the lessons of my opening youth.\r\n  If on my later life some glory shine,\r\n  Some honours grace my name, the meed is thine.\r\n  My boyhood’s nurse, my aged dust receive,\r\n  And one last tear of kind remembrance give!\r\n\r\nLord Wellesley was deeply attached to his old school, and some of\r\nthe last productions of his pen were dedicated to Eton. Consequently\r\nit was only fitting that when he died, in testimony of the strong\r\naffection which he entertained towards the place where he received his\r\nfirst impressions of literary taste, and in accordance with his desire\r\nexpressed before his death, his body should be laid to rest beneath the\r\nCollege Chapel of Eton--that spot of earth which, through a long and\r\narduous life in many lands, was ever the nearest and dearest to his\r\nheart. The new Lower Chapel, built 1889-1891, also contains a memorial\r\nto Lord Wellesley in a stained-glass window, the gift of the late Mr.\r\nA. Montgomery, who was once his private secretary.\r\n\r\nTwo Eton Headmasters are commemorated by monuments on the right\r\ntowards the eastern end of the Chapel. These are Dr. Balston and Dr.\r\nHawtrey, the last person to be buried within the Chapel walls. On his\r\nbreast is a badge with the arms of Scotland and the motto _Nemo me\r\nimpune lacessit_ just showing. This badge recalls an old Eton usage[6]\r\nnow extinct. The most modern monument is a statue of Henry VI., put up\r\nover the north door to the memory of the late Mr. J. P. Carter, for\r\nmany years one of the Assistant Masters.\r\n\r\n[SN: PINNACLES--OLD AND NEW]\r\n\r\nIn 1876, owing to much of the Headington stone used by Waynflete\r\nhaving become decayed, the whole of the exterior of the Ante-Chapel\r\nwas entirely refaced.[7] This, with other restorations, of necessity\r\nimpaired a good deal of its ancient charm. On the whole the renovation\r\nwas carried out with care, but it is to be regretted that the old\r\npinnacles were then entirely removed and new ones (designed in a highly\r\nornate style of Gothic for which there is no authority[8]) erected\r\nunder the direction of Mr. Woodyer. The old pinnacles had last been\r\nrepaired in 1698-1699. A curious circumstance connected with them is\r\nthat during their removal fragments of the ancient reredos--destroyed\r\nin 1546-1548--were discovered to have been built into their fabric.\r\nWhatever may have been the demerits of the old pinnacles, one or two\r\nof them which had suffered least from the hands of time should have\r\nbeen allowed to remain in place, so that future generations might\r\nrealise the original design which modern taste, or lack of taste, has\r\nchosen to discard.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting architectural features of the College\r\nChapel is the ancient holy water stoup on the right-hand side of the\r\ndoor of the south porch. As may be seen in old prints, the service\r\nbell was formerly in a sort of dovecot (irreverently called by some a\r\nlarder) placed on the roof of the porch. Here also hung the knell bell,\r\nwhich, as long as the College Chapel remained the Eton Parish Church,\r\nwas tolled for all funerals. The service bell still in use, hanging in\r\nthe turret at the south-western angle, bears the inscription “Prayes Ye\r\nLord, 1637.”\r\n\r\nIn a niche on the west wall of the Ante-Chapel, facing the street, a\r\nstatue of William Waynflete was placed in 1893. This was subscribed for\r\nby some old Etonians connected with Sussex. The task of designing it\r\nwas entrusted to Sir Arthur Blomfield, who produced one of the very few\r\nbits of commendable modern work in Eton. Indeed, this little statue,\r\nbeneath an elaborate canopy, may be called the only real artistic\r\nimprovement carried out within the last seventy years, during which\r\ntime so much labour and money have been devoted to what in some cases\r\namounts to mere wanton destruction. Of the new quadrangle and Lower\r\nChapel, built by Sir Arthur Blomfield 1889-1891, little need here\r\nbe said. On the whole, the architect has done his work well, and no\r\ndoubt, under the mellowing influence of time, the Queen’s schools will\r\nassume something of that picturesque aspect which in some slight degree\r\nalready pertains to the New Schools completed by Mr. Woodyer in 1863.\r\n\r\n[SN: LOWER CHAPEL]\r\n\r\nA full account of the new Lower Chapel, its memorials and stained-glass\r\nwindows, is to be found in the admirable _Illustrated Guide to Eton\r\nCollege_ written by Mr. R. A. Austen Leigh, who in this and other\r\nworks has done much which should gain for him the thanks of all\r\nEtonians. Since the construction of the New Schools, Upper School,\r\nwhich tradition has connected with the name of Wren, is only used as a\r\nschoolroom for one division for the purposes of examination. Speeches,\r\nI believe, are now to take place in the new Memorial Hall, and the\r\nbusts of celebrated Etonians will no longer look down upon the visitors\r\nwho flock to Eton on the 4th of June. The old staircase, from the\r\ncolonnade to Upper School, is one of the most picturesque portions of\r\nthe College. Here it was that in old days boys promoted from Lower to\r\nUpper School were subjected to the ordeal of “booking,” being hit on\r\nthe head with books as they passed up the staircase.\r\n\r\nWithin the last fifty years the town of Eton has suffered severely from\r\na picturesque point of view owing to the demolition and alteration\r\nof many quaint old houses which formerly gave the place a charming\r\nold-world appearance. The “Old Sun,” which was pulled down not very\r\nlong ago, contained some fine arched oaken beams, and the laths were\r\nperpendicular and fastened with willow twigs. On the front wall used to\r\nbe a Sun Insurance plate of the eighteenth century, one of the earliest\r\nissued by that Company.\r\n\r\nIn that part of Eton given up to houses for boys, alterations have of\r\nnecessity been made in order to afford accommodation for increased\r\nnumbers. Some of the older houses have had extra stories added, whilst\r\nentirely new ones have also been built. Of these latter somewhat\r\n“barracky” erections it is perhaps best not to speak.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Eton Memorial, however, built for some unknown\r\nreason in the Renaissance style, the writer can only say that in his\r\nopinion a building less in keeping with the spirit of Eton it would\r\nhave been impossible to erect. Why the authorities should have selected\r\na design of this sort is difficult to understand. Surely some architect\r\nmight have been found to produce a building which would have harmonised\r\nwith the fine old brickwork which in the quadrangle and elsewhere\r\nproduces such a charming effect? To intrude a purely personal opinion,\r\nthose responsible for the maintenance of Eton School have within the\r\nlast seventy years committed three great artistic mistakes--the first,\r\nthe indiscriminating restoration of the College Chapel, entailing the\r\ndestruction of much admirable woodwork; the second, the renovation\r\nof the College Hall, in which it is admitted a number of interesting\r\nfeatures were obliterated; the third, the erection of the huge\r\nMemorial, the whole aspect and style of which is utterly out of keeping\r\nwith its surroundings.\r\n\r\nClosely associated with Eton is the adjoining Royal Borough of Windsor,\r\nin which past generations of Etonians played so many wild pranks.\r\nThe houses which formerly fringed the walls of the Castle have long\r\ndisappeared, and on the other side of the road few ancient buildings\r\nremain. The queer old theatre and gabled buildings near “Damnation\r\nCorner” have been demolished within comparatively recent years.\r\n“Damnation Corner,” it is curious to recall, received its name from the\r\nfact that in the old “shirking” days it was extremely difficult for an\r\nEton boy to avoid a master coming quickly round the corner.\r\n\r\n[SN: A MONSTROUS ROOF]\r\n\r\nDuring the last fifty years the whole appearance of Windsor Hill has\r\nbeen transformed, the hand of the restorer having not even spared the\r\nvenerable curfew tower--now for some forty-eight years disfigured by a\r\nroof so monstrous in its ugliness that it stands forth as a surpassing\r\nand convincing proof of our national lack of artistic taste.\r\n\r\n[SN: FUTILE PRATTLE]\r\n\r\nThe hideous top, totally inappropriate in style, was put up by Salvin\r\nin 1863, when the ancient bell tower of picturesque and suitable\r\nappearance was demolished. The operations carried out at that date\r\nwere, of course, dignified by the name of “restoration”; as a matter\r\nof fact the unwieldy addition to the tower had not a vestige of\r\narchæological authority. It is much to be hoped that some day the\r\nancient appearance of the tower will be restored, for the huge, ugly,\r\nand inappropriate slated roof constitutes an eyesore from almost every\r\npoint of vantage from which the Castle can be viewed. Within quite\r\nrecent years there could be seen, looming through an embrasure, the\r\nmuzzle of an old cannon, which, according to a local legend, had been\r\nplaced there by Cromwell in order to guard against any hostile move\r\nfrom the direction of Eton. During a recent visit to Windsor the writer\r\nwas quite unable to locate either cannon or embrasure; presumably both\r\nhave gone. This old curfew tower--the oldest part of the Castle, and\r\nsaid to have been built in the days of the Conqueror himself--has been\r\npeculiarly unfortunate. When Salvin constructed his abominable top he\r\nhad the decency to leave the rest of the external structure alone,\r\nand in the writer’s Eton days, thirty years ago, almost all the old\r\nstonework and quaint little windows, cunningly contrived for bowmen to\r\nshoot through, remained as they had been built. Since then there have\r\nbeen two or three reparations; no doubt the decay of the stone made\r\nsome renovations necessary. In the last of these, however, during\r\nwhich the whole of the exterior was refaced with an entirely different\r\nkind of stone, the original design of the tower, which, like all the\r\nwork of the Normans, was very simple, has been tampered with, the\r\nresult being that its ancient charm has been completely impaired. So is\r\nit that in this country, in spite of much meaningless gush and prattle\r\nof education and appreciation of art, almost every fine monument is\r\nby degrees vulgarised and destroyed. The curfew tower, it should be\r\nadded, was one of the few parts of the Castle left untouched by George\r\nIV. in the very comprehensive remodelling of the whole stately pile by\r\nWyattville.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] See page 204.\r\n\r\n[5] Mr. Tucker in _Eton of Old_.\r\n\r\n[6] See pages 38-40.\r\n\r\n[7] See page 5.\r\n\r\n[8] See _The Architectural History of the University of Cambridge and\r\nof the Colleges of Cambridge and Eton_, by the late Robert Willis,\r\nM.A., F.R.S., edited and brought up to date by the late John Willis\r\nClark, M.A., Cambridge, at the University Press, 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII COLLEGE\r\n\r\n\r\nTill the carrying out of the reforms initiated by Provost Hodgson in\r\n1844 the treatment of the King’s scholars constituted little short of\r\na public scandal, rendered the more iniquitous because College was\r\nthe original Eton, and the lack of consideration and comfort shown\r\nto boys on the Foundation was directly contrary to the wishes of the\r\nFounder. No wonder was it that the number of those in College often\r\nfell far short of the appointed seventy, sometimes sinking as low as\r\nthirty-eight. In one year there were but six candidates for forty\r\nvacancies. The prospective advantages which a Colleger might reasonably\r\nexpect at King’s College, Cambridge, were not enough to counterbalance\r\nthe discomfort and degradation of existence in the great dormitory\r\nknown as “Long Chamber,” besides which the expenses of a King’s scholar\r\nwere little less than those of the well-fed and comfortably housed\r\nOppidan, the cost of education on the Eton Foundation often falling\r\nnot very far short of a hundred a year--a most extravagant outlay\r\nconsidering that a Colleger was cared for no better than a charity boy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Colleger, 1816.]\r\n\r\n[SN: “THESE POOR BOYS”]\r\n\r\nGlancing over the records of the treatment meted out to those whom\r\nProvost Hodgson rightly termed “these poor boys,” one wonders that the\r\nmasters, who were perfectly acquainted with the state of affairs in\r\nCollege, made practically no protest. It must be remembered, however,\r\nthat at that time all of them without exception had been Collegers\r\nthemselves, and having come through the ordeal with comparative\r\nimmunity from harm, probably had some sort of idea that the hardships\r\nand discomforts of life in College produced hardy and successful men.\r\nWhat these hardships and discomforts were may be realised from the view\r\ntaken by an Insurance Company as to chances of life of any one who\r\nhad undergone them. In 1826 Dr. Okes, when applying for an insurance\r\npolicy, in reply to one of the questions put to him stated that “he had\r\nslept in Long Chamber for eight years,” on hearing which the chairman\r\nof the Board said, “We needn’t ask Mr. Okes any more questions.”\r\nExistence in the ill-kept and insanitary dormitory in question was\r\ncalculated to promote only the survival of the fittest, and those who\r\ngrew up to be healthy men might well be accounted “good lives.”\r\n\r\nWhilst, as has been said, little protest was ever raised at Eton itself\r\nagainst the deliberate misinterpretation of the statutes with respect\r\nto the scholars, public opinion gradually became aroused, and many\r\nold Etonians, notwithstanding the intense _esprit de corps_ which\r\nhas always been a characteristic of the school, joined in the chorus\r\nof unanimous reprobation which demanded reform. About 1834 the Eton\r\nauthorities were violating not only the spirit but the letter of the\r\nancient statutes.\r\n\r\n[SN: BROKEN STATUTES]\r\n\r\nThe statutes required that the fines and land-tax should be applied to\r\nthe common use (“ad communem utilitatem”), instead of which they were\r\nappropriated by the Provost and Fellows to their own use.\r\n\r\nThe statutes entitled the Fellows to £10 a year stipend, and 2s. a\r\nweek, or £5, 4s. a year, for commons, whereas they had increased their\r\nstipend to £50 a year, and received in lieu of commons on an average\r\n£550 a year each, or £10, 11s. 6d. per week instead of 2s.\r\n\r\nThe statutes entitled the Provost and seven Fellows to allowances\r\namounting in all to £200 per annum, but in practice they received\r\nnearly £7000.\r\n\r\nThe statutes required that the scholars should be supplied with dress\r\nand bedding; with all, in fact, “quae ad vestitum et lectisternia\r\neorundem aliaque iis necessaria pertinent.” Nevertheless, with the\r\nexception of a coarse gown, the scholars received nothing appertaining\r\nto dress from the funds of the College.\r\n\r\nThe statutes provided ample allowances for breakfast, dinner, and\r\nsupper, with the use of certain fisheries. In practice breakfast was\r\nomitted altogether, and for dinner the only kind of meat provided for\r\nthe scholars throughout the year was mutton, which even if good in\r\nquality was not sufficient in quantity.\r\n\r\nAccording to the statutes thirteen servitors were to wait upon the\r\nProvost, Fellows, and scholars in Hall, which arrangement had further\r\ndeveloped into the Lower boys waiting upon the Upper, who in their turn\r\nperformed the same menial offices for the Provost and his company on\r\nthe occasions of their dining in the College Hall.\r\n\r\nThe statutes required that each scholar should be instructed free under\r\nthe most strict oath to be taken by the Head and Lower Masters. In\r\ndirect defiance of this each scholar was charged £6, 6s., the amount\r\nhaving been gradually increased to that sum.\r\n\r\nThe statutes allowed each Fellow a separate apartment, but such\r\naccommodation had long ceased to be sufficient for them, and instead\r\nthey resided in spacious houses, free from taxes and the expense of\r\nrepair, with stables and coach-houses attached.\r\n\r\nThe statutes enjoined that one room should be provided for every three\r\nboys, free from any expense. In 1834 upwards of forty boys slept in\r\nLong Chamber, whilst those who were lodged in the two adjoining rooms\r\npaid a sum of money annually to the second master.\r\n\r\nThe statute that any scholar during a short illness should be\r\nmaintained at the College expense (if longer than a month, to receive\r\na sum of money) was entirely ignored.\r\n\r\nFinally, the statutes were required to be read to the scholars\r\nassembled in a body three times a year. This was never done; the\r\nscholars, moreover, were not allowed access to them.\r\n\r\nIt should also be added that the statute which forbade Fellows of the\r\nCollege to hold benefices had long been treated with utter contempt,\r\nthey holding them to any amount.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the Eton authorities had contented themselves with merely\r\nbreaking the statutes in the way of malversation of funds and the\r\nlike, no particular outcry would in all probability have arisen. It\r\nwas Long Chamber, and the state of affairs within its walls, which\r\nexcited such indignation amongst those who, denouncing it as a sort of\r\nBastille, clamoured for reform. Originally all the seventy scholars\r\nseem to have slept in the long dormitory above Lower School, but after\r\n1716 the number became limited to about fifty-two. In that year the\r\nLower Master, Thomas Carter, having given up his two rooms at the east\r\nend, eighteen Collegers were located in the rooms in question, being\r\nhenceforth known as Carter’s Chamber and Lower Chamber.\r\n\r\n[SN: LONG CHAMBER]\r\n\r\nLong Chamber, about 172 feet long and 15 feet high, was in winter\r\nwarmed, or rather not warmed, by two fire-places which were put in in\r\n1784; before that there were no fires at all. Along each wall was a\r\nrange of old oaken bedsteads which had been there for centuries, and\r\nbetween every bedstead a high desk, with a cupboard beneath, for each\r\nboy. The desk and cupboard, painted lead colour, contained all their\r\nbelongings. There was no system of lighting except candles, to hold\r\nwhich no provision was made. The leaf of a book torn off, doubled,\r\nand a hole cut in the centre, formed the only candlestick which the\r\nColleger had. If he wished to read in bed, the candle was removed\r\nfrom the pasteboard candlestick and stuck against the back of the old\r\nbedstead. Even if sleep overcame a boy reading in bed, and his candle\r\nburnt down to the wood, no harm came of it, the bedstead being well\r\nstriped with charcoal, an evidence of the incombustible nature of the\r\nold oak. [After Long Chamber had been done away with, some little\r\nmodels of these ancient bedsteads were made out of wood black with age.\r\nThe Rt. Hon. Lewis Harcourt’s Eton collection contains one.] All that\r\nhappened was that it would not be long before he would be awakened by\r\nthe unpleasant smell of the wood, or by a good tweak of the nose from\r\nhis next-door neighbour, who would be angry at the annoyance. In winter\r\nthe boys shivered with cold, most of the glass in the windows being\r\nusually broken.\r\n\r\nThere were but a very few chairs for the Sixth Form, and the barrack\r\nor prison (boys were locked into it at 6.30 in the evening), with the\r\nexception of a table with a basin for the highest boys, was totally\r\ndevoid of washstands, Collegers having to perform such ablutions\r\nas they might deem necessary at the old pump in the cloisters. The\r\nwalls and ceiling were full of the grime of ages, whilst the whole\r\nplace as a general rule was in a state of intolerable filth. Once a\r\nyear, however, some attempt was made to give Long Chamber a habitable\r\nappearance, and the time-honoured processes to which it was then\r\nsubjected were generally sufficiently successful in making visitors who\r\nsaw it believe that all was well enough. For a week before Election\r\nSaturday, which took place at the end of July, “rug-riding” was in full\r\nforce. A number of Lower boys were tied up in big rugs and dragged\r\nwith a rope by other fags up and down Long Chamber till the floor\r\nshone like a mirror; the spaces between the beds were also scrubbed\r\nto a corresponding glossiness. On the Thursday, waggon-loads of beech\r\nboughs, cut in the College woods at Hedgerley and Burnham, were brought\r\nin and the whole of Long Chamber decorated; the green rugs, edged\r\nwith gold and embroidered with the College arms, given by the Duke of\r\nCumberland in 1735, were then spread on the beds. A huge flag was hung\r\nfrom the Captain’s bed and the whole aspect of the room transformed.\r\nNevertheless the dirt remained beneath.\r\n\r\nExcept at Election time Long Chamber was not accessible to visitors,\r\nand the King of Prussia himself was refused admission in 1842, on the\r\nplea that that portion of the College was never shown.\r\n\r\n[SN: CARTER’S CHAMBER]\r\n\r\nThings in the two other rooms appropriated to the use of the King’s\r\nscholars were not much better, and an extraordinary state of affairs\r\nprevailed in Carter’s Chamber. Whenever the chimney there became at all\r\nfoul, the boys used to set fire to it, and, being very large, the roar\r\nit made when blazing was tremendous, generally much to the annoyance of\r\nthe Provost, part of whose lodge was close by. The fires in question\r\nwere made with large beechen logs, placed upon iron dogs, and the\r\nCollegers used to roast potatoes among the ashes. One of these logs\r\nevery Lower boy was compelled to saw up before he went to bed, with a\r\nsaw that had no edge. This was one of the most unpleasant features of a\r\nLower Colleger’s existence, for the thinnest logs were always chosen by\r\nthe biggest boys, leaving the heaviest for poor little fellows hardly\r\nstrong enough to lift them. Not infrequently would the latter dock\r\nthemselves of part of their rolls for breakfast in order to be able to\r\nbribe another stronger boy to saw up their portion for them.\r\n\r\nAs regards food, the old-time Colleger was disgracefully treated, no\r\nbreakfast at all being provided for him in College. Dinner in Hall\r\nconsisted entirely of mutton until about 1840, when Provost Hodgson\r\nadded roast and boiled beef, each one day in the week. Though the\r\nmutton is said to have been of excellent quality, the manner in which\r\nit was served made it often impossible for a young boy who had not\r\na robust appetite to get any dinner at all that he could eat. The\r\njoints were served in messes, a leg or a shoulder serving for eight\r\nboys, a loin or neck for six, the best joints going to the elder boys.\r\nThey were put upon the table, and the boys carved for themselves. The\r\ncaptain of the joint cut his own portion liberally from the best part,\r\nand passed it on to the next in seniority, who slashed away at it after\r\nhis own taste. A junior fared badly if the joint happened to be a loin\r\nor a shoulder and he had not appetite enough for the fat and bones. The\r\nknives and forks often ran short, and boys were occasionally obliged to\r\nbe content with the reversion of such adjuncts. On Sundays plum-pudding\r\nof a peculiar construction, by some considered very palatable, made of\r\nunchopped suet and unstoned raisins, made its appearance. Indifferent\r\nbeer was drunk by the Collegers out of painted tin mugs. On Founder’s\r\nDay and Election Saturday half a chicken and pressed greens was\r\nserved to every boy. Beyond this the fare provided, as has been said,\r\nconsisted entirely and solely of mutton. In connection with this,\r\nhowever, it is but fair to remember that not a few boys objected to the\r\nbeef which, at a yet earlier period, figured on the College menu. One\r\nof these, according to Sir Dudley Carleton, was the “dainty-mouthed”\r\nyoung Phil Lytton, son of Sir Rowland Lytton of Knebworth. Collegers\r\nwhose purses permitted were allowed to purchase more or less savoury\r\nmesses from the cook, one of whose most famed dishes was, for some\r\nunknown reason, known as “blue-pill.”\r\n\r\n[SN: COLLEGE SERVANTS]\r\n\r\nThree of the Lower boys waited upon Sixth Form in Hall, handing them\r\ntheir plates and pouring out their beer, one being specially detailed\r\nto hold back the long sleeves of the gown on the Upper boy who carved\r\nthe joint. This custom of “servitors,” as they were called, perhaps of\r\na too menial kind, was not unwisely abolished some thirty years ago,\r\nthe staff of College servants having been increased.\r\n\r\nMany of the old College servants were characters like the original\r\nWebber, who seems to have inaugurated the sock shop, which is now\r\nRowland’s, near Barnes Pool Bridge. Webber was College cook in the\r\nearly portion of the last century, in addition to which he manufactured\r\nthe birches then in much request. Owing probably to this, he incurred\r\na sort of curious unpopularity, a legend being started that he had run\r\naway from the battle of Waterloo, therefore the usual taunt of the\r\nCollegers, for whom he carved in the Hall, was, “Pass up to old Webber\r\nthat we want to see his Waterloo medal.” The story appears to have been\r\npurely mythical.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James Culliford, the last Chief Butler of College to\r\nwear the livery of Eton blue, standing by the College Pump. _Reproduced\r\nby permission of the Earl of Rosebery, K.G._]\r\n\r\nA great College functionary was the chief butler. The last man to\r\nhold this office was Mr. James Culliford, who died in 1901, aged\r\neighty-nine. The illustration facing page 202 shows him in the\r\ntraditional uniform of Eton blue which is now no longer worn, its use\r\nhaving been discontinued for no particular reason seemingly. The\r\nveteran in question also appears in the group of College servants, of\r\nwhom the sole survivor is the little boy, Mr. Culliford’s son, who for\r\nso many years has been known to Etonians as the manager of the famous\r\nEton tailor, Tom Brown. In this group (reproduced by the courtesy of\r\nMr. Culliford from a scarce old photograph in his possession) can also\r\nbe seen the last College constable, honest old Bott, who was such a\r\nwell-known figure in the days when, with a colleague (one of the same\r\ngroup), he was responsible for the due maintenance of law and order.\r\nIn his long coat of Eton blue, with the College arms embroidered upon\r\nhis sleeve, and glazed top-hat, Bott was a sight which inspired tramps\r\nand petty evil-doers of every sort with genuine awe, and the vast\r\nmajority of such folk took care to give him a wide berth. Bott had\r\ndone good service as a soldier, having, it was said, fought at Albuera\r\nand Waterloo, though according to some his military service had been\r\nconfined to serving during the American War. In any case, the fine old\r\nfellow was a typical Englishman of a robust age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Mr. J. Long (College Porter)\r\n  C. Westbrook (Cook)\r\n  J. Wagstaffe (Scullion)\r\n  H.

Culliford, Esq._]\r\n\r\n[SN: THREEPENNY DAY]\r\n\r\nOn certain days, owing to the observance of ancient custom, the\r\nColleger’s lot sustained some amelioration. On February 27th, for\r\ninstance, the Provost or his Deputy presented every Colleger, beginning\r\nwith the lowest, with a threepenny piece. The origin of this custom was\r\nthat Provost Bost (1477-1504) left a sum which gave each Colleger\r\ntwopence, and Provost Lupton (1504-1535) left them the extra penny.\r\nA doubtful tradition declared that a Colleger was entitled to half\r\na sheep, and that the College was merely giving him what was its\r\nequivalent in money during the Middle Ages. An impudent young Colleger\r\nwho had heard of this tradition, being offered his threepence by the\r\nBursar, Mr. Bethell, a man of very uncertain temper, once calmly\r\nsaid, “No, thank you, sir; I want my half sheep.” Bethell flew into\r\na passion, and exclaimed, “I’ll mention this matter to Dr. Hawtrey,\r\nand have you flogged,” and in due course Branwell--so the “Tug” was\r\nnamed--expiated his temerity at the block. Threepenny Day, I believe,\r\nis one of the very few old Eton customs which is still maintained.\r\n\r\nOccasionally protests would be made in order to secure some slight\r\nimprovement in the dinner. The execrable quality of the beer in\r\nparticular was several times brought to the notice of the Fellows, but\r\nbeyond one of their number coming into Hall and looking at the cans\r\nnothing was done.\r\n\r\nIn comparatively remote times a discussion took place amongst the\r\nauthorities on the question whether it was necessary for the Collegers\r\nto have their potatoes peeled or sent up in their skins. Two of the\r\nFellows, as it happened, though not related, bore the same name. One\r\nwas an advocate for the peeling system, declaring that the boys had\r\nbeen treated “like hogs”; the other opposed it as an unnecessary piece\r\nof refinement. In consequence they were afterwards distinguished by\r\nthe Collegers as “Hog R----” and “Peeli-po R----,” and the descendants\r\nof both families, who were at Eton for many generations, always bore\r\nthe hereditary nicknames of “Hogs” and “Peelipos.”\r\n\r\n[SN: “PUT INTO PLAY”]\r\n\r\nBesides the squalor and discomfort amidst which the Collegers lived\r\nthere was much horse-play and bullying, and for the most part small\r\nboys led a wretched life. Besides having to undergo various unpleasant\r\ninitiatory ceremonies, one of which consisted in swallowing an\r\nunsavoury mixture of salt and water, their life was rendered wretched\r\nby rough jokes. A bolster shaken down hard at one end could do a\r\nlot of damage, knocking over candles and ink-pots, or bringing the\r\nunsuspicious to the ground with a well-directed blow on the ankles from\r\nbehind. A “Jew,” as a new boy was called, was also apt to wake up in\r\nthe night to find a rope tied to his big toe, by which he was dragged\r\nfrom his bed. The only chance to escape such nocturnal visitations was\r\nto keep awake for some time, and, if he heard whispering, to creep out\r\nof bed and under that of a neighbour till he was safe from danger.\r\nSometimes he would be “put into play” till he was sore all over. This\r\nmost disagreeable ordeal was as follows. Around one of the large\r\nfire-places in Long Chamber two bedsteads were placed close together\r\non each side, and two at the end, forming an enclosure. The boy “put\r\ninto play” was placed in one corner, next to the captain, a certain\r\nnumber of the Upper boys being seated on the bedsteads. At a given\r\nsignal the captain started him with a hearty kick, which generally was\r\nsufficiently hard to propel him to the opposite side; from thence he\r\nwould be flung back quite as expeditiously. Bandied about like a human\r\nshuttlecock, bruises would soon begin to make him sore all over, but\r\nonly when it was evident that he was in severe pain would the boy be\r\nreleased and some shivering little spectator seized and made to take\r\nhis place.\r\n\r\nAnother cruel and brutal College practice which prevailed throughout\r\nthe fortnight before Election was tossing boys in a blanket. Sometimes\r\nan unpopular boy would be put in the blanket with a quantity of books,\r\nwhen he was certain to be most severely bruised. The custom was, after\r\nforcing the boy on to one of the small blankets, which was held all\r\nround by the bigger boys, to repeat this line:\r\n\r\n  Ibis ab excus_so_ missus ad astra Sa-_go_.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the syllable _so_ a little shake was given, but at the\r\nlast _go_ he was sent quivering to the ceiling. A boy named Rowland\r\nWilliams was severely injured in one of these tossings. Hurled up to\r\nthe ceiling, in his descent he fell sideways on to a bedpost and was\r\ncompletely scalped. Only by a most fortunate chance did he escape\r\ndeath, sustaining concussion of the brain. His scalp, which hung down\r\nhis neck, was sewn on again, and by great good fortune he completely\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nA less dangerous though highly unpleasant ordeal to which new Collegers\r\nwere subjected was the ceremony known as “Pricking for Sheriff.” The\r\nboy was laid across the lap of the chief executioner, face downwards,\r\nand into a very tightened and thin surface of small-clothes the\r\nassistant executioners ran pins, warning the victim that if he screamed\r\nlouder than his predecessor he would be elected Sheriff and fined a bag\r\nof walnuts.\r\n\r\nAt this time the relations between Collegers and Oppidans were not\r\nvery cordial, the Lower boys amongst the latter in particular often\r\nrendering themselves peculiarly objectionable to the King’s scholars,\r\nat whom they were wont to jeer. Sometimes some especially aggressive\r\nlittle Oppidan would be caught and taken into Long Chamber, and either\r\nsoundly thrashed or caned, or else subjected to the blanket-tossing\r\nprocess which has just been mentioned. When this was the case the\r\nvictim for some time after had good reason to remember his half an\r\nhour passed amidst the “Tugs”--which term in those days was far more\r\nopprobrious than is at present the case.\r\n\r\n[SN: THE GOWN]\r\n\r\nThe exact origin of the word “Tug” has never been cleared up. The most\r\npopular explanation has always been that it is derived from the Latin\r\nword _toga_, a gown, and referred to the black gowns they wore, and\r\nstill wear, in school. It should here be added that up to 1864 this\r\nindispensable appurtenance of a King’s scholar was made of cloth and\r\nvery heavy. In that year, however, the light material at present in\r\nuse was introduced, while the length of the gown was somewhat reduced.\r\nThe old-fashioned gowns contained pockets, which were often receptacles\r\nfor viands and dainties to be smuggled into Long Chamber. A parody of\r\nGray’s _Ode on Eton College_, written by a King’s scholar in 1798,\r\nalludes to this:--\r\n\r\n  I know my gown when first it flowed\r\n  An awkward majesty bestowed,\r\n    When waving fresh each woolly wing\r\n  That worn-out elbows serve to hide,\r\n  Or else to hold unknown, unspied,\r\n    A loaf or pudding in.\r\n\r\nAs far as the writer has been able to ascertain, the top-hat, or\r\nin earlier times its predecessor, the cocked or three-cornered\r\none, has always been the head-dress worn by Collegers, though in\r\nan illustration[9] representing the Iron Duke being cheered in the\r\nquadrangle in the middle of the forties of the last century, the King’s\r\nscholars are shown wearing or waving mortar-boards. These, it would\r\nappear, existed only in the imagination of the artist.\r\n\r\nThe allusion to worn-out elbows in the ditty given above is significant\r\nas to the poverty-stricken appearance of the Collegers, most of whom\r\nwere then very sorrily dressed. Almost without exception they were boys\r\nwhose parents had but small means. As a matter of fact College was\r\nnever intended to be an educational refuge for rich or high-born boys,\r\nand, as a highly competent critic has remarked, “A young aristocrat\r\nin a serge gown is an anomaly not contemplated by the statutes of the\r\nroyal founder.”\r\n\r\nBefore the reforms made in College in 1845 most of the King’s scholars,\r\nit must be confessed, were more of the class intended by Henry VI. than\r\nhas since been the case. In latter years many Collegers have belonged\r\nto well-to-do or even rich families, whereas the Foundation was\r\nspecially intended for poor boys. In the early part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury a certain proportion of those in College were the sons of\r\nEton or Windsor doctors or solicitors, royal servants, or successful\r\ntradesmen. Besides these there were sons of Eton masters and boys of\r\nimpoverished country squires. The former class of boys, however, were\r\nin some way made to feel that they were not the equals of the sons\r\nof gentlemen, and subjected to petty humiliations which did their\r\nschoolfellows small honour.\r\n\r\nBesides being exposed to physical violence, small boys, especially if\r\nthey were clever, were sometimes made to do work for stupid big ones.\r\nA certain lazy lout, however, was once well served out by his victim.\r\nIn difficulties as to the composition of a set of verses, the bully one\r\nday got hold of a smaller schoolmate, and under the threat of a severe\r\nlicking got him to do the verses for him. When, however, the bully came\r\nto showing up the lines which he had not done, and which he had not\r\neven troubled to read, they were found to be so grossly indecent and\r\noutrageous in tone that the master who looked at them at once declared\r\nthe writer should be flogged. At first the bully did not dare admit\r\nthat they were not of his own making, but eventually at the block he\r\nadmitted the fraud, with the result that the boy who had played him the\r\ntrick was also punished. It is to be hoped, however, that the bully\r\nreceived the more severe thrashing of the two.\r\n\r\nWhen the celebrated Porson was a Colleger, one of his contemporaries\r\nwas Charles Simeon, known as “Snowball” Simeon, the ugliest boy in\r\nCollege, who afterwards became an earnest Evangelical preacher. In\r\nafter life he looked back upon the doings in Long Chamber and its\r\nlawless rowdyism with horror, and once told a friend that he would be\r\ntempted even to murder his own son sooner than let him see in College\r\nthe sights he had seen.\r\n\r\n[SN: A RUNAWAY]\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances it is not surprising that small Collegers,\r\nif they were sensitive boys, occasionally made determined attempts\r\nto run away. One did so more than thirteen times, and became so\r\nwell known on the road that he was almost sure to be stopped before\r\nhe got far. Nevertheless he once got up to town in a very curious\r\nmanner. He slunk early, before morning school, into the yard of the\r\nChristopher; the London coach was standing outside, and no one by, so\r\nhe was able unobserved to creep into the boot, trusting to luck, which\r\nbefriended him, for there chanced to be that morning no passengers, and\r\nconsequently no luggage to be stowed away. The runaway was therefore\r\ndriven without disturbance in his uneasy berth, which he only vacated\r\non the arrival of the coach at the White Horse cellars in Piccadilly.\r\n\r\nThe general tone in College was somewhat rough and irreverent, as may\r\nbe judged from the following. Every Sunday morning at nine o’clock the\r\nCollegers assembled in Lower School for prayers, the headmaster sitting\r\nin the desk, and a praepostor standing up repeating the Confession\r\nand a prayer or two out of the Winchester Prayer-Book. All joined in\r\nthe 100th Psalm, which sometimes, more especially towards the end of\r\nthe Half, was made the occasion of a not very seemly demonstration.\r\nDuring the last Sunday the order went round that every one was to\r\nsing his loudest, and on one occasion the noise was so terrific that\r\nit could almost be heard in the playing fields. Keate, who was at\r\nthat time in the desk, did not, however, take any notice of this\r\nirreverent outburst. He had been a youthful Colleger himself, and\r\nprobably considered that the whole thing was merely a too enthusiastic\r\nperformance of an old Eton tradition, which in his eyes excused a good\r\ndeal.\r\n\r\nIn school work the Collegers then, as now, easily maintained an almost\r\nunchallenged supremacy. Almost without exception the sons of poor\r\nparents, accurately grounded and imbued with the idea that education\r\nwas a real preparation for life, they knew that they would have to make\r\ntheir way in the world by their own exertions, for which reason to be\r\n“a sap” in College was quite an ordinary thing. Besides this, sixty or\r\nseventy years ago the very traditional customs which excluded a King’s\r\nscholar from comparatively expensive amusements, such as the boats, and\r\nmade him a member of a separate football and cricket club, served to\r\nprotect a boy from drifting into various forms of fashionable idleness.\r\n\r\nAt one time few boys went into College who had not previously been\r\nOppidans, and, till Provost Hodgson’s reforms made it possible for\r\nevery boy to have a separate cubicle room, Collegers used to have rooms\r\ndown town or in their tutor’s houses, where they could escape from fag\r\nmasters and the disorder of Long Chamber. In such rooms they could\r\nwork, wash, and eat in peace.\r\n\r\n[SN: TRONE’S]\r\n\r\nUp to 1864 King’s scholars had to wear their gowns out of school,\r\nthough they abandoned them before passing over Barnes Pool Bridge. A\r\nsock shop in the High Street called Trone’s was almost exclusively\r\nfrequented by King’s scholars because they were allowed to leave their\r\ngowns there when going into Windsor. Oppidans never frequented it, and,\r\ncuriously enough, as showing the persistence of traditional usage,\r\nyears later, when the shop had changed owners, though no one could give\r\nany particular reason, it was supposed to be “scuggish” to pass its\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\nWhilst Long Chamber could never have been called an abode of bliss, it\r\nhad its pleasures, one of the chief of which was the rat-hunting, in\r\nwhich Porson is said to have taken so much delight. If the Colleges\r\nlacked food they never lacked game in the shape of rats, which fairly\r\nswarmed about the ancient dormitory. Some of these animals which defied\r\ncapture became well known to the boys, who in a sort of way felt a\r\nrespect for one veteran--an immense, perfectly gray old rat, which was\r\nsupposed to be the ghost of King Henry VI., or at any rate to have been\r\nin being from the very first foundation of the College.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of food was constantly being smuggled in. According to\r\ntradition, a sow was once captured and stowed away on the leads till\r\nshe had farrowed and provided roast sucking-pig in abundance. Hares\r\nand other game surreptitiously caught in Windsor Park furnished many a\r\nhearty feast. The Collegers were anything but particular, and on one\r\noccasion, it is said, actually roasted and ate an unfortunate swan\r\nwhich they had lured to its doom.\r\n\r\nA great College institution was Fire-place--a supper held before a\r\nroaring blaze, carefully set going by Lower boys in one of the two huge\r\ngrates in Long Chamber, under the eyes of the captain of the room, who\r\nenjoyed the privilege of granting an extension of revelling time (known\r\nas a half-holiday) beyond the hour of ten, when boys were expected to\r\nbe in bed. Five bedsteads were run out in two parallel rows around\r\nthe Upper Fire-place, one facing the cheerful glow, and an impromptu\r\nsupper took place, the boys consuming such provisions as they had been\r\nable to smuggle in. A certain amount of these were obtained from the\r\nChristopher “on tick,” whilst a common dish was a grill made of scrag\r\nends of mutton and bones purloined from Hall. Songs followed this\r\nsupper, the proceedings, which terminated at eleven, being enlivened by\r\nCollege songs roared in chorus. These were chiefly of a Bacchanalian\r\nor nautical order; some also dealt with poaching. A favourite song was\r\n“The fine old Eton Colleger--one of the Olden Time.” The last verse of\r\nthis ran:--\r\n\r\n  Now times are changed, and we are changed, and Keate has passed away,\r\n  Still College hearts and College hands maintain old Eton’s sway;\r\n  And though our chamber is not filled as it was filled of yore,\r\n  We still will beat the Oppidans at bat and foot and oar,\r\n            Like the fine old Eton Collegers,\r\n            Those of the olden time.\r\n\r\n[SN: JOHNNY BEAR]\r\n\r\nNot infrequently very palatable viands were obtained by the Upper boys\r\nand real banquets held, the pleasures of which were enhanced by the\r\npotations which “Johnny Bear” brought from the Christopher and pushed\r\nthrough the bars of Lower Chamber, the usual receiving-room of all\r\nsmuggled goods, on the ground floor and adjoining the school-yard. The\r\nLower boy whose turn it was to watch for Johnny’s arrival had pretty\r\ngood cause to remember such visits on cold nights.\r\n\r\nThe Headmaster’s servant, it should be added, was entrusted with the\r\nduty of seeing that no Colleger got out at night. Strict fidelity\r\nto this duty made him highly unpopular, for he would never consent\r\nto be bribed. Principal and only locker-up and gaoler to the boys,\r\nbirch collector, and rod distributor, he was generally known by the\r\nmythological appellation of Cerberus.\r\n\r\nLife in Long Chamber, like most unpleasant ordeals, had its\r\nalleviations. Once a year, for instance, there was an impromptu\r\nmasquerade, concluded by a march round, for which Jobey Joel, an Eton\r\ncharacter who survived till a few years ago, supplied the music, and,\r\nextraordinary as it may seem, theatricals flourished unchecked. Such\r\nperformances dated back to the early eighteenth century, since which\r\ntime they had been given with the full knowledge of the authorities.\r\nIn 1762, it is true, Dr. Barnard, who was then Headmaster, had tried\r\nto stop them, bursting in upon a representation of _Cato_, and, much\r\nto his disgust, finding that a long wig which he tore from one of the\r\nactor’s heads belonged to the Vice-Provost; but no drastic measures\r\nwere taken, and theatricals continued to take place as before. Out\r\nof Long Chamber, however, the drama was tabooed. Both Drs. Keate and\r\nHawtrey connived at the performances in Long Chamber, the latter\r\nespecially ignoring all theatrical preparations even when they were\r\nright under his nose. Favourite pieces were _A Midsummer Night’s\r\nDream_, _High Life below Stairs_, and _Orlando Furioso_. For the\r\npurposes of this last play, Anson--a powerful Colleger--once actually\r\nsmuggled a donkey into College, where it was stabled and fed till\r\nbrought out to carry Bombastes. The last play ever given in Long\r\nChamber was _A Night in China_, written by a Colleger named King, and\r\nplayed in 1845. After this, however, some Collegers, amongst whom was\r\nFrank Tarver, afterwards well known to several generations of Etonians\r\nas French Master, indulged in theatricals at the back of Turnock’s\r\ntailor’s shop in the town.\r\n\r\n[SN: MR. BOURCHIER’S ETON DAYS]\r\n\r\nEton has furnished some capital recruits to the London stage--Charles\r\nKean, the brothers Hawtrey, Mr. Willie Elliot, and others, including\r\nthat excellent actor, Mr. Arthur Bourchier, who even as an Eton boy\r\nwas celebrated for his dramatic zeal. About 1882, with Bogle Smith,\r\nCollet, Gilmor, and a few more, he organised the “Eton Strollers,” the\r\nprologue for whose first play was written by the Hon. Arthur Bligh, a\r\nboy of considerable literary and poetic taste, who, in collaboration\r\nwith Bourchier, wrote a drama which was sent to Irving for production.\r\n“Do these boys play cricket?” inquired the great actor when he received\r\nthe manuscript; as a matter of fact both were very fair cricketers,\r\nBourchier being a good wicket-keep.\r\n\r\nMr. Bourchier’s first theatrical _entrepreneur_ was Lord Kenyon, in\r\nwhose room at Cameron’s he made his _début_ in _Uncle’s Will_, in which\r\nhe acted with Johnson and Berkeley-Levett. When Mr. Cameron, who was\r\nnot sympathetic to theatricals, left Eton, Bourchier went to the Rev.\r\nT. Dalton’s, where his aspirations received far greater encouragement;\r\nindeed his Housemaster became imbued with such enthusiasm for\r\ntheatricals that a colleague once chaffingly inquired of him, “Is it\r\ntrue that young Bourchier is going to bring you out on the Music Hall\r\nstage?” Regular performances were now given in Pupil Room, for which a\r\nsmall charge--generally a penny a seat--was made, the proceeds going to\r\nthe Eton Mission, for the benefit of which the whole company, including\r\nMr. Dalton (who gave a humorous recitation), gave an entertainment at\r\nHackney Wick.\r\n\r\nThe exigences of the drama, however, occasionally clashed with\r\ndiscipline. When, for instance, in _Still Waters Run Deep_, after the\r\nlines, “Do you smoke?” “Yes, I’ll have a cigar,” two of the actors lit\r\nup, Mr. Dalton from his place amongst the audience shouted out, “No,\r\nyou don’t,” and was only appeased by an examination of the cigars,\r\nwhich proved to be dummies. On another occasion when a careless or\r\nmischievous Lower boy had manufactured snow for the duel scene in the\r\n_Corsican Brothers_ by tearing up a pile of “extra-works” which had\r\nbeen lying on Mr. Dalton’s desk for correction, the latter became so\r\nscandalised at seeing the duellists enveloped in a “cloud of equations”\r\nthat, after ejaculating, “One minute! This performance now ceases,” he\r\nset actors and audience to the uncongenial task of putting the pieces\r\ntogether. The most ambitious effort of the company was an elaborate\r\nperformance of _The Merchant of Venice_, in which Reggie Lucas (see\r\nChapter X.) took part.\r\n\r\nBourchier was celebrated for his imitations of Masters, about the\r\nmost amusing of which was an impersonation of a certain squeaky-voiced\r\ntutor after he had been cut over by an imaginary cricket ball. As luck\r\nwould have it, the latter, whilst playing in an eleven of Masters\r\nagainst boys, one of whom was Bourchier, did happen to sustain a\r\npainful injury, with the result that he proceeded to give an almost\r\nexact reproduction of himself as portrayed by his imitator, who could\r\nnot help being convulsed with laughter as he led the sufferer off the\r\nground. Later on, the victim, who, of course, had no idea of the real\r\ncause of this merriment, said to a colleague, “What hurt me more than\r\nthe pain was the brutality of the boy Bourchier.”\r\n\r\n[SN: “UNDER THE CLOCK”]\r\n\r\nIn course of time Bourchier formed his imitations into a sketch,\r\nentitled _Under the Clock_, which depicted a number of Eton Masters\r\nat Lord’s, and before he left the late Mr. R. A. H. Mitchell arranged\r\nthat this should be heard by the individuals concerned, whom he posted\r\nbehind trees in Poet’s Walk whilst the author gave his performance\r\nclose by. They were all very much amused, and when it was over came\r\nforward to congratulate the youthful aspirant to dramatic fame, whom\r\nthey shook warmly by the hand and wished him all success in his future\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nTo return to the story of College--the pleasures as well as the trials\r\nof Long Chamber came to an end in 1845, for in September of that year\r\nthe new buildings were opened and the old days of College became mere\r\nmemories of an obsolete age. The discomforts and hardships of Long\r\nChamber were then forgotten by most of the boys who had slept there. In\r\nspite of the far better conditions they chafed at the lack of freedom\r\nand the end of “Fire-place” with its suppers and choruses. The Chamber\r\nitself, though not pulled down, was entirely remodelled, cubicles for\r\na limited number of boys being constructed and the whole place made\r\nhabitable and clean.\r\n\r\nElection Saturday, the glories of which have now departed for ever, was\r\na great day not only for those in College, whom it more immediately\r\nconcerned, but for the whole school. At two o’clock the Provost of\r\nKing’s College, Cambridge, attended by two examiners called “Posers,”\r\ndrove into Weston’s Yard. The arrival of his yellow coach, drawn by\r\nfour smoking horses, always produced great excitement. Meeting the\r\nProvost of Eton, a kiss of peace was exchanged (abandoned in Dr.\r\nHawtrey’s days for a handshake). A speech was then made in Latin by\r\nthe captain of the school under the archway of Lupton’s Tower, its\r\nmain purport being the offering of congratulations to the Provost\r\non his arrival at the College. The rest of the programme was much\r\nthe same as that still gone through on the 4th of June--speeches in\r\nthe Upper School at eleven, banquet of dons in the College Hall at\r\ntwo, processions of the boats in the evening to Surly Hall, with\r\nfireworks off the Eyot on the return, and finally, sock suppers in\r\nall the houses. The fun on Election Saturday, however, was always\r\nmore fast and furious than on the 4th of June, because the school was\r\nto break up on the following Monday, and the boys who were going to\r\nleave looked upon themselves as already emancipated. For this reason\r\nturbulent spirits did not scruple to commit all sorts of extravagances,\r\nbeing pretty sure that just preceding the holidays they would escape\r\nunpunished.\r\n\r\n[SN: THE POSERS]\r\n\r\nOn the Tuesday and Wednesday following, candidates for College were\r\nexamined, as well as scholars seeking election to King’s. The “Posers,”\r\nor examining chaplains, were terrific gentlemen in the eyes of the\r\nboys; whilst examination took place, Election-chamber was to most an\r\nawful room, then rendered somewhat weird and uncanny by the light\r\nfiltering through an immense red curtain, let down at the large oriel\r\nwindow, which imparted a sort of devilish appearance to the “Posers.”\r\n\r\nA very quaint old usage existed in connection with these “Posers,”\r\neach of them being attended by a Colleger, who waited upon him in Hall\r\nand elsewhere if required, for which the boy--quaintly called the\r\n“Poser’s child”--received a fee of a guinea, selection for the office\r\nby the Headmaster being regarded as being a sort of minor honour.\r\nThe existence of this curious custom, which of course died a natural\r\ndeath with the “Posers” themselves, has generally, I think, escaped\r\nmention in books dealing with Eton. It was brought to my notice by my\r\nold tutor, Mr. H. W. Mozley (Newcastle Scholar, 1860), who in this and\r\nother ways has given me valuable information which I here acknowledge;\r\nhe himself had been “Poser’s child” in 1859.\r\n\r\nThe days following Election Saturday were always particularly\r\ndepressing and gloomy, and the poor King’s scholars had a melancholy\r\ntime. The gentlemen, as the tradespeople had the impertinence to call\r\nthe Oppidans, went home on the Monday, whilst Collegers had to wait\r\nuntil the Thursday. All the shops were shut up, and scarcely any one\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nCollegers, like Oppidans, then remained at Eton longer than at\r\npresent--as late as 1874 there was a King’s Scholar, Tuck by name,\r\nwho was said to have been nine years at the school. In the days when\r\nsuch a close connection existed between Eton and King’s, a Colleger\r\nleaving to go to Cambridge used to go through the old form known as\r\n“Ripping.” This was performed at the Provost’s Lodge. The two folds of\r\nthe Colleger’s serge gown were sewn together in front, and the Provost\r\n“ripped” them asunder, pronouncing some Latin formula, after which he\r\ncongratulated the embryo scholar of King’s, and gave him good advice\r\nas to his future career. The gown, it must be remembered, was then an\r\nessential part of the Colleger’s equipment out of as well as in school.\r\nAlthough the rule was not strictly adhered to, they were even supposed\r\nto wear their gowns whilst playing games.\r\n\r\n[SN: ETON’S DIVORCE FROM KINGS]\r\n\r\nAll the picturesque features of Election disappeared in the sixties,\r\nwhen new statutes were substituted for those of the Founder, and\r\nthe relations between King’s College, Cambridge, and Eton entirely\r\nchanged. In 1861 William Austen Leigh and Felix Cobbold were elected to\r\nKing’s. With them ended the ancient succession of Eton scholars after\r\nit had continued, with few if any interruptions, under the statutes of\r\nHenry VI., for the period of four hundred and nineteen years, William\r\nHatecliffe (1443), afterwards Secretary to King Edward IV., and Felix\r\nThornley Cobbold (1862) being the first and last scholars. The right\r\nof the latter to a scholarship at King’s was, it should be added,\r\ndisputed, as was that of William Austen Leigh, the Provost and Fellows\r\nof the Cambridge College urging that the new statutes were already\r\nin operation. This question, which never ought to have been raised,\r\ninasmuch as the names of these boys were on the indenture before the\r\nexistence of the new statutes, was submitted to legal opinion and then\r\nto the “Visitor.” It was eventually justly decided that the two Eton\r\nscholars were entitled to scholarships at King’s College, with all\r\ntheir rights, emoluments, and consequences, and with this terminated\r\nthe ancient and sisterly connection between the two Foundations.\r\n\r\nThe new statutes provided that four scholarships at King’s should be\r\nannually offered for competition to the scholars of Eton, tenable for\r\nsix years, value £80 per annum, with tuition, rooms, and commons free.\r\nThe injury done to the interests of Eton by the new arrangements was\r\nvery great, for four scholarships per annum did not amount to the\r\naverage of the old succession, which ranged from four and a half to\r\nfive, while the difference between a scholarship of six years’ tenure\r\nand one which led to a Fellowship that might be held for life was so\r\ngreat as to be difficult to calculate. The remarkable features in these\r\niniquitous changes were the earnestness with which they were pressed\r\nby King’s, which seemingly was anxious to rid itself of its connection\r\nwith Eton--that is, as far as it could--and the weakness of Eton and\r\nits dereliction of duty to itself and its scholars in acquiescing in\r\nthem without any attempt to obtain any mitigation or revision which\r\nmight certainly have been effected. Henry Norris Churton, the first\r\nColleger to be affected by the new state of affairs, declined to accept\r\nthe scholarship at King’s to which he was elected in July, but Richard\r\nDurnford, elected in the same month, did accept, and thus became the\r\nfirst Eton scholar who went to King’s under the new statutes.\r\n\r\nA few years later--in 1871--the repeal of the entire code of statutes\r\nwhich had regulated Eton since the 21st December, 1443, did a good\r\ndeal more towards nullifying the wishes of Henry VI. The old statutes\r\nlaid down that there should be seventy _poor_ scholars--an important\r\nclause which the new ones abolished. At present, directly contrary\r\nto the Founder’s intention, there is nothing to prevent the son of a\r\nmulti-millionaire from competing for an Eton scholarship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sixth-Form Bench. _Lithograph lent by the Earl of\r\nRosebery, K.G._]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[9] This appeared in the _Illustrated London News_ during the forties\r\nof the last century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII SCHOOL WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst Eton has occasionally produced some very fine scholars--the\r\nMarquis Wellesley was a case in point--it cannot be said that the\r\ntraditions of the school are very favourable to learning, which to a\r\nlarge proportion of Etonians has seemed of less importance than the\r\nacquisition of worldly wisdom. More than a hundred years ago De Quincey\r\nnoted the peculiar tone which prevailed amongst Eton boys, who showed\r\na premature knowledge of the world far exceeding that possessed by the\r\nscholars at any other school. The graceful self-possession of the boys\r\nattracted his attention, but he thought them lacking in self-restraint.\r\nSuch an accusation, however, could not justly be made in more modern\r\ndays, when a sort of genial unconcern has come to be regarded as one of\r\nthe principal characteristics of the typical Etonian, who, preferring\r\nanecdote to argument, is profoundly convinced that amongst human\r\ninstitutions his school stands easily first.\r\n\r\nWith respect to most modern criticisms which have been levelled against\r\nthe system of education, it must be remembered that in their efforts\r\nto teach, the masters are handicapped by one or two fundamental\r\ndifficulties not easy to surmount.\r\n\r\nEton, in a much larger proportion than any other school, has contained,\r\nand does contain, the children of rich parents, boys of good birth\r\nand large expectations, most of whom realise very early in life that\r\nthere is no absolute necessity for them to work; consequently something\r\nlike a leaven of indolence permeates the school, the tone of which\r\nit is, perhaps unjustly, said has of late years been impaired by an\r\nincreasing number of sons of millionaire parvenus, who are allowed\r\nextravagant sums by parents anxious to forward the social success\r\nof their offspring by any kind of means. Such parents for the most\r\npart have no real wish that their boys should be educated at all,\r\nand send them to Eton simply to form friendships and to be turned\r\ninto gentlemen; or perhaps merely because Eton enjoys the reputation\r\nof being a fashionable school. Be this as it may, the number of\r\nrich boys sprung from the commercial, or rather financial, classes\r\nhas undoubtedly increased, whilst foreigners now flock to Eton in\r\never-swelling numbers. As a result tales, probably untrue, have been\r\ncirculated of wealthy boys achieving a spurious popularity owing to\r\ntheir pockets being constantly replenished from home, whilst, according\r\nto one incredible rumour, the sons of certain rich speculators, imbued\r\nwith an hereditary faculty for money-making, have, on occasions, not\r\nhesitated to loan portions of their abundant funds at an extravagant\r\nrate of interest. The writer, be it understood, does not for a moment\r\nsay that such a state of affairs really exists, but the fact remains\r\nthat such things have been whispered, of course with no increase to\r\nthe prestige of the school. It is not healthy for boys to be allowed\r\nunlimited pocket-money, and men of moderate means--belonging to what\r\nmay be called “old Eton families”--do not care to expose their sons\r\nto the contamination of mingling with schoolmates of alien blood\r\nwhose sole claim to consideration lies in their parent’s enormous\r\nwealth. In addition to this, quite a number of foreign boys are sent\r\nto be educated at Eton, which has occasionally not proved altogether\r\nadvantageous to the best interests of the school.\r\n\r\n[SN: MODERN ETON]\r\n\r\nModern Eton as it is to-day may be said to have originated from the\r\nrecommendations of the Public School Commission, which began its work\r\nin 1861, at which time a wind of change was blowing about old places\r\nin England, with the result that many a weather-worn relic went down\r\nbefore it. As a result of the labours of this body, the charm of the\r\nschool’s celestial quiet was broken, some of the evidence taken having\r\nrevealed an unsatisfactory state of affairs which seemed to call for\r\ndrastic change. It was, for instance, conclusively shown that the\r\nmasters had more on their hands than they could do, and some did not\r\nmake any scruple about complaining. “We are enormously overworked,”\r\nsaid one. “There is no time,” said another, “for society, for meeting\r\neach other, for relaxation, and no time, I may say, for private\r\nreading, and I consider that prejudicial to the school.” In fact, as\r\nMr. Commissioner Vaughan put it, it seemed a characteristic of the\r\nEton system that “the masters did too much for the boys, and the boys\r\ndid too little for themselves.” The real state of affairs at Eton at\r\nthat time was that an immense deal of work was got out of the masters,\r\nand little out of the boys. Since those days the number of masters has\r\nswelled to the very adequate number of sixty-five or more, exclusive\r\nof the Head and Lower Master, but the tutorial system, which has\r\nat various times aroused a good deal of adverse criticism, remains\r\nunchanged, and in all probability will continue to flourish as long as\r\nEton lasts.\r\n\r\n[SN: DEAD AND LIVING TONGUES]\r\n\r\nHalf a century ago it was urged that the main mistake in the Eton\r\nsystem lay in the retention of the dead languages as the staple of\r\nschool work, whilst the panacea put forward for the admitted ignorance\r\nof Young England was the adoption by the majority of boys of what is\r\nknown as a “special education.” With some justice it was urged that as\r\na boy when he goes out into the great world is unlikely to read much\r\nGreek, and even less likely to write much Latin verse, his school days\r\nhad much better be occupied in learning something which is practical\r\nand useful. Whilst the classics are still the main feature of the\r\nschool curriculum, a boy may now, on having reached a certain standard\r\n(usually attained about the age of 16-1/2), learn modern languages,\r\nscience, history, mathematics, or continue to study Greek and Latin,\r\naccording as he, or rather his parents, may decide. In addition to\r\nthis, the Army class provides an alternative course of study for those\r\nabout to enter upon a military career.\r\n\r\nAn entirely new feature is that a number of boys going to Eton now\r\nenter for the foundation examination, though without any idea of\r\nbecoming King’s scholars should they pass. In July 1910 three of the\r\nnineteen scholars who passed into Eton entered as “Oppidan scholars.”\r\n\r\nWith regard to the modern languages mentioned above, it is to be\r\nhoped that the old Eton method of teaching has been discarded. In the\r\npast the time set apart for French was too often merely a farcical\r\ninterlude, during which boys devoted all their energies to teasing the\r\nmaster! The old classical system would be preferable if anything of the\r\nsort survives, for, after all, even a slight knowledge of the classics\r\nis better than an imperfectly assimilated smattering of a modern\r\ntongue. In old days very thorough methods were adopted in connection\r\nwith Latin and Greek. One luckless lad in Keate’s division construed\r\n_Exegi_, I have eaten; _monumentum_, a monument; _perennius_, harder;\r\n_aere_, than brass. “Oh, you have, have you?” said the Doctor; “then\r\nyou’ll stay afterwards, and I’ll give you something to help digest\r\nit,” and he did. On the whole, educational authorities are still\r\nloth to exclude Latin and Greek. The Commission of fifty years ago,\r\nafter hearing much evidence, were of this opinion. The Commissioners\r\nreported:--\r\n\r\n  We believe that for the instruction of boys, especially when\r\n  collected in a large school, it is material that there should be\r\n  some one principal branch of study, invested with a recognised and,\r\n  if possible, a traditional importance, to which the principal weight\r\n  should be assigned and the largest share of time and attention given.\r\n  We believe that this is necessary in order to concentrate attention,\r\n  to stimulate industry, to supply to the whole school a common ground\r\n  of literary interest, and a common path of promotion.... We are of\r\n  opinion that the classical languages and literature should continue\r\n  to hold, as they do now, the principal place in public school\r\n  education.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly much to be said for Latin as an aid to the\r\nacquirement of “exact expression,” but Greek is another matter\r\naltogether. According to the writer’s own experience, the majority of\r\nboys never obtained any real grip upon that defunct tongue, besides\r\nwhich, for all but an infinitesimal number, in after life Greek, as Mr.\r\nAndrew Carnegie has somewhat bluntly put it, “is of no more use than\r\nChoctaw.”\r\n\r\nThe old Eton system was largely composed of paradoxical omissions,\r\nand by an extraordinary fiction boys were supposed to be thoroughly\r\nacquainted with subjects such as modern geography and arithmetic, of\r\nwhich, in reality, they knew nothing at all.\r\n\r\n[SN: MATHEMATICS]\r\n\r\nWithin comparatively recent years mathematics had no regular place in\r\nthe curriculum of the school. It is true that there was an “extra”\r\nmaster or two who was allowed to take those who liked to be taught and\r\ncharged, but he had no means of enforcing discipline, and, however\r\nirritated he might be, had no right to complain to the Headmaster. In\r\nMr. Gladstone’s Eton days Major Hexter, who kept a boarding-house,\r\nand was styled the writing-master, taught mathematics. Only the Lower\r\nboys, however, went to him, and when they were certified as proficient\r\nin long division the Major troubled them no more. When in 1836 the\r\nRev. Stephen Hawtrey came to the school as mathematical master he was\r\nonly allowed to give his lessons as “extras,” and to the first thirty\r\nboys in the school, because Major Hexter was supposed to have a vested\r\ninterest in the ignorance of the remainder. The whole thing ended in\r\nMr. Hawtrey paying the Major a pension of £200 a year, so that the\r\nlatter’s opposition to the teaching of Euclid and algebra might be\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nEven after he had obtained a more or less regular position, Mr. Stephen\r\nHawtrey’s lot was none too happy, and this most kindly man passed many\r\nirritating half-hours in the round theatrical-looking building which\r\nsome called the “Station House.” Those boys whose parents desired it\r\nwere entered on the books of this establishment, but the time spent\r\nthere was one rather of recreation than of study. Mischievous boys were\r\nconstantly turning off the gas or letting off squibs and crackers,\r\nespecially in November, which was a particularly merry season.\r\nBesides this, the unfortunate master did not receive much sympathy or\r\ncommiseration from his classical superiors, being in a measure regarded\r\nas an interloper and an enemy to versification.\r\n\r\nThe last writing-master as provided for by the ancient statutes was a\r\nMr. Harris, who always resented not being allowed to wear a cap and\r\ngown like the other masters. Highly tenacious of such privileges as\r\nhe could contrive to obtain, he was always well pleased when small\r\nboys touched their hats to him in the street, punctiliously returning\r\nsuch salutations with a grand sweep of the arm. A hater of steel pens,\r\none of his principal occupations was mending quills and trying their\r\nnibs on his thumb-nail. He had always a quill behind one of his ears,\r\noccasionally behind both; and, being a little absent-minded, would\r\nsometimes, to the general delight, sally forth from school with his\r\nhat on and a pair of fresh-mended quills sticking out underneath. Mr.\r\nHarris taught only Lower boys, but big ones, whose bad hand-writing had\r\nattracted attention, were sometimes sent to him to learn how to write\r\nproperly; this, needless to say, was looked upon as a great humiliation.\r\n\r\nThe old Eton system could not, of course, fit a boy for a commercial\r\nor business career--as a matter of fact it was never intended to do\r\nso. The modern system, on the other hand, makes something more than a\r\npretence of equipping Etonians for any profession they may select,\r\nthough, considering the traditions of the school, this is no easy task.\r\nThe old idea was that, exclusive of the Collegers, a number of whom\r\nwere always fine scholars, it did not much matter if the boys were\r\ntaught Sanscrit or Chinese, the main purpose of an Eton education being\r\nnot so much to inculcate what was vulgarly called “book-learning,” as\r\nto fit Etonians to take their place in the great world outside.\r\n\r\n[SN: “TARDY-BOOK”]\r\n\r\nOf late years, however, the authorities have made real progress in\r\ntheir efforts to convert “an Eton education” into more of a reality.\r\nThe facilities for study at Eton have always been good, and within\r\nrecent years much has been done to improve them, with, it would seem,\r\nsatisfactory results. White tickets have been invented as a final\r\nsupreme punishment when yellow tickets have failed to make a culprit\r\nrealise his own shortcomings, whilst the quaintly named “Tardy-book,”\r\nan institution of entirely modern origin, has been devised to strike\r\nterror into those who make a practice of being late for school.\r\n\r\nThe old haphazard methods which formerly prevailed have been discarded\r\nin favour of more business-like ways, the school office, which\r\nundertakes the distribution of much connected with the work of the\r\nschool, being a thoroughly workmanlike and efficient institution. In\r\nits early days, however, a few things somehow got mislaid, which,\r\nof course, furnished unscrupulous boys who had failed to do any\r\npunishment with the plausible excuse that their lines had got lost\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMuch less idleness seems now to prevail, the boys being certainly\r\nforced to work more than was the case in the writer’s day, when so many\r\nof them, it must be admitted, learnt very little indeed, contriving to\r\ngo through the school with a really surprising lack of mental effort.\r\nTo such as these the only real time of danger was Trials, when they\r\nwere absolutely obliged to make some attempt at working. Most idlers,\r\nhowever, took such an ordeal very lightly, occasionally supplementing\r\ntheir defective memories by various ingenious contrivances. An expert\r\nonce, it is said, equipped himself as follows: Right waistcoat pocket,\r\nGreek verbs; left waistcoat pocket, Latin verbs; breast pocket, crib to\r\nHorace; right tail pocket, crib to Virgil; left tail pocket, crib to\r\nHomer; finger-nails, important dates. His ingenuity, however, was all\r\nwasted, for he was plucked. The amount of application and intelligence\r\nneedful to take a good place in such examinations was formerly quite\r\nmoderate.\r\n\r\nCunning boys had all sorts of ways of avoiding work. Some could\r\ncalculate to a nicety when they were likely to be put on to construe,\r\nand learnt only a particular bit. One master for a long time made it a\r\npractice to call upon each boy in turn right through his division, with\r\nthe result that they confined themselves to learning only about a dozen\r\nlines or so apiece. At last, however, the trick was discovered, and one\r\nfatal morning the master caused consternation by putting on the first\r\nboy at the end instead of the beginning. A general collapse ensued, boy\r\nafter boy standing dumbfoundered and speechless, instead of rattling\r\noff his portion with glib proficiency.\r\n\r\n[SN: SUNDAY QUESTIONS]\r\n\r\nThirty or forty years ago, it may safely be affirmed, any boy of\r\nordinary intelligence who had received a good grounding at a private\r\nschool could manage to make his way up to the higher forms without\r\nonce “muffing Trials,” and yet not increase his stock of learning in\r\nthe very slightest degree. He lived, as it were, upon a capital of\r\nknowledge imbibed in the very different atmosphere of some hard-working\r\npreparatory school. The enthusiasm for learning which inspired many\r\na boy fresh from such modest seminaries was too often quickly cooled\r\nby the banks of the Thames. It was, indeed, admitted by not a few\r\nthat the longer a boy remained at Eton the more lazy he became. One\r\ncheeky lad, indeed, being lectured for idleness by his tutor, who at\r\nthe same time eulogised the industry of a comparatively new comer, was\r\nmet by the answer, “Well, sir, I have been here three years and he\r\nonly one.” The tone, at least amongst the majority of the Oppidans,\r\nwas not encouraging to enthusiasm of any kind, besides which the frank\r\nabsurdity of certain portions of the Eton curriculum was calculated\r\nmerely to depress a boy gifted with even average intelligence. Sunday\r\nquestions, for instance, instituted by Dr. Goodford about 1854, usually\r\nresembled nothing so much as a page of acrostics, the correct solution\r\nof which, whilst involving a vast amount of trouble, conduced to\r\nanything but a love of the Bible. As an aid to holy living, for which\r\npurpose, I believe, they were supposed to be devised, no more pitiful\r\nfailure ever existed, the sole effects produced being unmitigated\r\nboredom and much bad language. In modern days they may have been\r\nimproved, but in their original form these questions, a number of which\r\ndealt with the genealogies of Hebrew kings, were a most unstimulating\r\nexercise for the youthful brain.\r\n\r\nIn many other respects the school-work was idiotically useless and bad,\r\na great part of it having seemingly been devised to entail a maximum\r\nof drudgery with a minimum of useful information. Above all, it lacked\r\nelasticity, little or no effort being made to encourage a boy in any\r\nparticular subject for which he exhibited aptitude.\r\n\r\nSome features of the curriculum might have been modelled upon the\r\nancient Chinese system. What could have been more ridiculous than to\r\nmake boys who could scarcely construe a simple sentence attempt to\r\nturn out Latin verse? It would have been far better to teach greater\r\nEton--that is, the mass of more or less ignorant dunces--how to write\r\na good letter in their own language, or driven into their brains\r\nsome knowledge of modern geography, yet nothing of the sort was ever\r\nattempted.\r\n\r\nThe writing of Latin verse was one of the most time-honoured Eton\r\ntraditions which had to be undertaken by every boy who emerged from\r\nthe Lower Forms of the school, and every week a copy of verses was set\r\nby the masters who took the divisions of the Fifth Form. These verses\r\nhad to be done by the boys as best they could, being submitted for\r\ncorrection to the tutors, who got the verses into shape, eliminating\r\n“false quantities” and all other mistakes, in the course of which\r\noperation they themselves often composed a good deal of Latin poetry.\r\nThe revised copy was then returned to the boy, who wrote a “fair copy”\r\nout of school, and afterwards showed up both copies to the Division\r\nMaster. The strain on the tutors was at times great, and unscrupulous\r\nboys, with the additional help of a clever friend, would sometimes\r\ngo through the whole of their Eton career without in the least\r\nunderstanding anything at all about verse-writing.\r\n\r\n[SN: “TUGS” AND “SAPS”]\r\n\r\nSuch a state of affairs exerted a demoralising effect upon the minds\r\nof earnest, well-meaning boys, who gradually came to see that certain\r\nfeatures of their education were entirely futile. Besides this, owing\r\nto the general tone of the school, a large part of which regarded\r\nschool-work as being merely a sort of useless way of wasting time,\r\ntheir estimation of the value of effort of all kind lessened, whilst\r\nthe conviction was forced upon them that no particular _kudos_ was to\r\nbe gained by conscientious study, which they came to look upon as the\r\npeculiar appanage of “Tugs” and “Saps.”\r\n\r\nNo feat of learning on the part of a King’s scholar ever aroused the\r\nslightest surprise, it being generally assumed that “Tugs,” unlike\r\nthe rest of the school, having been born “Saps,” or always made to\r\nwork, could master every kind of learning with the greatest ease. The\r\nNewcastle Scholar, always a boy of high intellectual attainments,\r\nexcited no interest amongst the mass of the school--the majority\r\nindeed scarcely knew who had won it, and, if asked, would generally\r\nreply, “Oh, some Colleger or other.” No aspirations to gain Balliol\r\nscholarships or places in the class-lists disturbed the serenity of\r\nthe Oppidan’s mind. Such petty ambitions might excite the miserable\r\nrivalry of boys at other schools, vain mortals toiling in the lower\r\nworld of scholarship, “vying with and outrunning and outwitting one\r\nanother.” In such contests Eton could afford to look calmly on, secure\r\nin that “repose of character” which has for so many generations marked\r\nher students. There existed, indeed, a sort of tacit understanding that\r\nit was the business of the Collegers to do the intellectual work and\r\nto win the school and University honours, whilst the Oppidans were to\r\nprove victorious at Henley and, if possible, beat Harrow and Winchester\r\nat cricket. A great portion of the school, assuming a natural licence\r\nto be idle, had a deeply implanted conviction that reading was not in\r\ntheir line, and at heart believed it was rather a slow thing to do.\r\n\r\nThe general result of this unsatisfactory standard of course yielded\r\nbad results. Calmly secure in the conviction that to be in the eight\r\nor eleven was to have reached the highest pinnacle of boyish ambition,\r\nthose who excelled in athletics became naturally prone to undervalue\r\nintellectual effort and attainments.\r\n\r\n[SN: GAMES, NOT WORK]\r\n\r\nTo excel at games, not at work, was the ideal set before their\r\nyouthful eyes; no wonder that for one who persevered in conscientious\r\npreparation of his school-work ten succumbed and became content to sink\r\nlower and lower in Trials, till at last they just scraped through a few\r\nplaces from the bottom. Admiration for athletics indeed was carried to\r\nan almost absurd extreme. Whilst there can be no doubt that exercise\r\nand an indulgence in manly games and healthful forms of relaxation\r\nare excellent for schoolboys, they should be regarded from a sane\r\nand proper point of view, and not held up as the sole end and aim of\r\nhuman existence. Curiously enough, scarcely any great men have been\r\nkeen athletes during their youthful days, whilst a large proportion\r\nof those who have excelled in the cricket field or on the river have\r\nbeen utterly unheard of in after life, where capacity to propel a boat\r\nthrough the water at high speed or drive a cricket ball to the boundary\r\ncounts scarcely at all. An entire absorption in games to the exclusion\r\nof practically all other interests cannot be called a healthy feature\r\nof education. Loafing, every one agrees, is a slovenly and demoralising\r\nhabit, but fanatical interest in cricket, football, or the river is bad\r\nin another way, for though it may produce muscle, it may also, when\r\ncarried to an extreme, produce atrophy of the brain.\r\n\r\nIn the rough old days, though sporting pursuits, like fighting, were in\r\nhigh repute, games do not appear to have been taken very seriously at\r\nEton, where there was nothing approaching the modern spirit which makes\r\nheroes of the eight and the eleven. In the eighteenth century, though\r\ngames were played, not a few of the more clever boys would appear to\r\nhave viewed them with something of good-humoured contempt.\r\n\r\n  “I can’t say I’m sorry that I was never quite a schoolboy,” wrote\r\n  Horace Walpole; “an expedition against Bargemen, or a match at\r\n  cricket may be very pretty things to recollect; but, thank my stars,\r\n  I can remember things that are very near as pretty.”\r\n\r\n[SN: HOOPS]\r\n\r\nHis friend Gray, though in his famous ode he touched upon the school\r\ngames, expressed no particular enthusiasm for athletics:--\r\n\r\n  What idle progeny succeed\r\n  To chase the rolling circle’s speed.\r\n    Or urge the flying ball?\r\n\r\nGray, it should be added, originally wrote\r\n\r\n  To chase the hoop’s elusive speed,\r\n\r\nfor, extraordinary as it may appear to the modern Etonian, the hoop was\r\nformerly in high favour with Eton boys. Trundling a hoop has long been\r\nrecognised as one of the best forms of exercise; indeed, the writer has\r\nbeen told that the present Headmaster of Eton, in his day an athlete of\r\nhigh distinction, being once abroad where no games could be played,\r\nin order to keep himself fit purchased a hoop and took to trundling it\r\nwith great zest.\r\n\r\nAs late as the early part of the nineteenth century, during the October\r\nhalf, the majority of Lower School used to indulge in the somewhat\r\ninfantile delights of trundling a hoop with a stout stick. The Eton\r\nhoop was made differently from the ones still used by children, being\r\nformed out of a strong ash lathe with a remnant of bark upon its\r\nsurface. The inevitable collisions of hoops and their trundlers not\r\ninfrequently led to hostilities, and on several occasions regular\r\npitched battles occurred between Collegers and Oppidans. A famous\r\nencounter once took place at the end of the wall near the Chapel door,\r\nabout twenty boys being on each side, one Saturday after four, big\r\nboys in front, little ones behind. Thanks to their gowns, which they\r\nadroitly twisted round one arm, the Collegers had the best of the\r\nencounter, though the Oppidans were able to draw off without having\r\nbeen definitely beaten. The contest excited great interest, a crowd of\r\npeople watching the battle, and though the masters were fully aware of\r\nwhat was going on, no attempt was made to interfere. For some reason\r\nor other, however, there was no more hoop-trundling till the following\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _“Say Father Thames, for thou hast seen\r\n   Full many a sprightly race.\r\n   Disporting on thy margent green.\r\n   The paths of pleasure trace.”\r\n     GRAY’S ODE._\r\n\r\n_From a scarce print in the possession of the Earl of Rosebery, K.G._]\r\n\r\nIn long-past days another form of amusement, generally associated\r\nwith childhood--marbles--enjoyed an occasional popularity amongst\r\nLower boys, many of whom prided themselves on the variegated colours\r\ncontained in their collections, whilst for a time “Bandalore”--which,\r\nas “Diabolo,” quite recently enjoyed a great vogue all over\r\nEngland--quite captivated the school.\r\n\r\nPeg-tops were once in great favour, Weight, who kept a grocer’s shop\r\nand was known as “Old Tallow Weight,” doing a brisk business in such\r\ntops and the whip-cord necessary to spin them. The Rev. E. D. Stone\r\n(see page 61) says that in his day, under Hawtrey, backgammon and\r\nknuckle bones were popular in College.\r\n\r\nAbout 1770 the games[10] popular at Eton were “Cricket, Fives, Shirking\r\nWalls, Scrambling Walls, Bally-cally, Battledores, Pegtop, Peg in the\r\nring, Goals, Hopscotch, Heading, Conquering Lobs, Hoops, Marbles,\r\nTrap-ball, Steal-baggage, Puss in the corner, Cat-gallows, Kites,\r\nCloyster and Flyer gigs, Tops, Humming-Tops, Hunt the Hare, Hunt the\r\ndark lanthorn, Chuck, Sinks, Store-Caps, Hustle-cap.” Of football, it\r\nwill be observed, there is no mention; nevertheless it was played,\r\nthough not in very good repute. Fives, of course, was then played\r\nbetween the buttresses of the Chapel, the favourite time being before\r\neleven-o’clock school, when a ring of spectators would assemble to\r\nwatch good players. As every one knows, the pepper-box of the modern\r\nfives court takes its origin from the stone termination of the steps\r\nleading up to the Chapel door, which was copied in the first regular\r\nfives court built at Eton in 1847.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the old Eton authorities, whilst not disapproving\r\nof games, did not attach any very considerable importance to them. In\r\ntheory, indeed, boating on the Thames was forbidden, but in practice\r\neven Keate tolerated the joys of the river, though he made violent\r\nefforts to prevent any rowing before Easter, in order to prevent the\r\nboys from catching chills.\r\n\r\n[SN: HOCKEY]\r\n\r\nIn the ’forties of the last century foot races and the three-mile\r\nsteeplechase, with its almost impossible jumps and immersions, were a\r\nsource of considerable interest just before Easter. The winter games\r\nwere then football and hockey, the latter of which, however, only held\r\nits ground for a time, during which it was patronised by many of the\r\nswells. There was then a tradition, which still seems to exist, that\r\nit had been from time to time forbidden as dangerous; nevertheless it\r\nwas played for years without either injury or any reprimand. The sticks\r\nwere not rough, but smoothed and artificially bent, with blades about\r\na foot long. There were two clubs, called upper and lower hockey; but\r\nfootball gradually superseded it, and the game entirely disappeared\r\nabout the year 1853. With regard to the prohibition, a writer mentions\r\n(in 1832) hockey and football as the chief winter games at Eton, and\r\nsays that more came away “hobbling” from the latter than from the\r\nformer, but speaks further on of a boy having in his room “an illegal\r\nhockey-stick.” He observes that this fine old game had died out in\r\nEngland, except at Eton and Sandhurst, and adds quaintly: “It is one of\r\nthe most elegant and gentlemanly exercises, being susceptible of very\r\ngraceful attitudes, and requiring great speed of foot.”\r\n\r\nAs time went on, athletics began to exercise more and more influence,\r\ntill in the ’sixties they attained to much the same preponderant\r\nposition as they hold at Eton to-day. A few, however, viewed the\r\ngrowing worship of skilfully trained brute force with unconcealed\r\ndislike. In the early ’seventies of the last century a little magazine,\r\ncalled the _Adventurer_, contained an article signed E. G. R. called\r\n“Eton as it is,” which scathingly attacked the growing deification of\r\nmuscle rather than brain:--\r\n\r\n  “While in the world around us, for which we are here preparing\r\n  ourselves, a vast worship of intellect universally prevails, at Eton\r\n  it is the worship of the body which enslaves the whole community.\r\n  What, in our estimation, is mind, intellect, hard and successful\r\n  cultivation of the faculties? Nothing. What is cricket, rowing,\r\n  athletics, football? Everything. And our School is meanwhile being\r\n  degraded almost to the level of an Athletic Club.... Idleness holds\r\n  sway everywhere, and _such_ idleness! As a man who has never had\r\n  dealings with the Chinese can have but a faint idea of what swindling\r\n  is, so a man who has never been at Eton has but a poor conception of\r\n  what idleness is.”\r\n\r\n[SN: “POP”]\r\n\r\nThis protest was not, however, well received by the school, the\r\n_Adventurer_ being expelled from the rooms of “Pop,” which, curiously\r\nenough, on its foundation in 1811 by Charles Fox Townshend as a\r\npolitical and literary society, had only elected the captain of the\r\nboats in order to show that the members _had no prejudice_ against\r\nathletics.\r\n\r\nIts tone was distinctly Conservative. Fourteen years later, in Mr.\r\nGladstone’s day, only one member, a Colleger, was suspected of having\r\nLiberal tendencies. Originally “Pop” was located in the upper room of\r\nMother Hatton’s “sock shop.” In 1846, when the house, together with\r\nanother, was formed into Drury’s, “Pop” migrated to the yard of the old\r\nChristopher. The site of Drury’s is now covered by part of that huge\r\nand incongruous building--the “Memorial Hall.”\r\n\r\nThe early members of “Pop,” it is curious to find, were originally\r\nknown as the Literati, their first debate, held on February 9, 1811,\r\ndealing with the question of whether the passage of the Andes by\r\nPizarro or the passage of the Alps by Hannibal was the greater exploit.\r\nNo political event within fifty years was permitted as a subject for\r\ndebate. Mr. Gladstone, who was elected a member in 1825, made his\r\nmaiden speech before this Society, the subject being “Is the Education\r\nof the Poor on the whole Beneficial?”\r\n\r\nThe future Prime Minister took great pains to improve himself as an\r\norator, going, it is said, to rehearse his “Pop” speeches in Trotman’s\r\ngardens, on the site of which the old fives courts were afterwards\r\nbuilt. To the end of his days he continued to take great interest in\r\nthe “Eton Society.” His correspondence as to its records, in which\r\nevery speaker has written his speech, has been amusingly described by\r\nLord Rosebery, who on succeeding the great statesman in office one\r\nday received a letter in which the Grand Old Man expressed himself\r\nmuch distressed because during a recent visit to the rooms of “Pop” he\r\nhad seen a picture of a recent Derby winner over the chimney-piece. A\r\ngeneration, wrote Mr. Gladstone, which had such depraved tastes could\r\nnot, in his opinion, be fitted to have the custody of the invaluable\r\nrecords of the Eton Society, and he therefore begged Lord Rosebery to\r\naddress the authorities at Eton on the subject. The state of affairs\r\nof which Mr. Gladstone complained, did not cause the recipient of his\r\nappeal so much disquiet, for the Derby winner which hung over the “Pop”\r\nmantelpiece was Lord Rosebery’s own horse, Ladas, which won the great\r\nclassic race in 1894.\r\n\r\nLord Rosebery, who, even in his Eton days, was a most effective\r\ndebater, is another member of “Pop” who has risen to high distinction.\r\nRetaining a singularly keen interest in everything connected with his\r\nold school, he it was who made the most eloquent and witty speech at\r\nthe dinner in the Memorial Hall, where, on July 14, 1911, 400 Etonians,\r\nthe vast majority old members of “Pop,” met to commemorate the 100th\r\nanniversary of the Society’s foundation. In the aforesaid speech he\r\nvery happily described “Pop” as being a noble companionship like the\r\nGarter, not always given for merit, but a high companionship with\r\nillustrious tradition to which anybody might be proud to belong.\r\n\r\n[SN: ETON VICEROYS]\r\n\r\nThough athleticism has now in a great measure dominated the “Eton\r\nSociety,” it must be confessed, as another distinguished old Etonian,\r\nLord Curzon, said at the same dinner, that neither title, means, nor\r\nathletic distinction _per se_ ever enabled a man to get inside the\r\nwalls of “Pop.” There must be something else--he must be what the world\r\ncalls “a good sort,” and it is well that this happy state of affairs\r\nstill remains unchanged. On the same occasion Lord Curzon pointed out\r\nthat Eton had laid a vigorous hand on India, six out of the last seven\r\nViceroys having been old Eton boys, whilst that illustrious veteran\r\nLord Roberts was also an old Etonian.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the nineteenth century the importance of the\r\ncaptain of the boats has gradually grown, and at the present day his\r\npersonality dominates Eton. He occupies a unique position, being envied\r\nand admired by the Upper part of the school and regarded as a sort of\r\nsuperior being by Lower boys.\r\n\r\nWhen, about half a century ago, a Royal Commission was taking evidence\r\nas to the state of affairs prevailing at Eton, it was elicited in\r\nevidence that “the captains of the boats and the eleven were scarcely\r\never distinguished in scholarship or mathematics.” One master indeed\r\ndeclared that he had “not observed any boys, during a short experience,\r\ndistinguished both in intellect and athletic pursuits.” Young Lord\r\nBoringdon, himself one of the “eight” for two years, was “afraid\r\nthat the crews of the boats were generally distinguished for want of\r\nindustrious habits.” Cricket the Commission pronounced to have been\r\nfound “hardly compatible with high scholarship.” Although the Collegers\r\nformed the larger proportion of the oldest boys in the school, they\r\nwere seldom in the eleven, because they were unwilling to spare so much\r\ntime from the school work as was considered necessary for practice.\r\n\r\nIn my own Eton days, thirty years ago, the captain of the school--head\r\nof Sixth Form--was nobody at all in the eyes of the Oppidans. Few of\r\nthem indeed knew him by sight, and fewer still felt any curiosity to\r\ndo so. As far as I remember he enjoyed no particular privileges except\r\nthe right of presenting a new Headmaster with a birch tied up with\r\nribbon of Eton blue. The captain of the Oppidans held a slightly better\r\nposition, a sort of idea prevailing that there must have been something\r\nextraordinary about him or he would not have risen so high in the\r\nschool, Oppidans as a rule not being generally considered very clever\r\nor apt to work.\r\n\r\n[SN: “SWAGGERS”]\r\n\r\nNext to the captain of the boats in popular estimation came the\r\ncaptain of the eleven, who in his own circle commanded a good deal\r\nof attention, and of course stood infinitely higher than any boy\r\ndistinguished only for intellectual attainments. The members of the\r\neight and eleven followed after, together with a few other “swaggers,”\r\nwho on account of their prowess at football, rackets, running, fives,\r\nand sometimes even rifle shooting, were regarded with a certain degree\r\nof reverential awe.\r\n\r\nOf late years, however, a more satisfactory state of affairs has\r\nprevailed, not a few prominent athletes and oarsmen having shown\r\nconsiderable mental capacity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[10] This list is the one given in _Nugae Etonenses_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX ROWING AND GAMES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early history of Eton rowing is somewhat obscure, but it is\r\nperfectly clear that the Oppidans have always had control of all rowing\r\narrangements. In former times, indeed, Collegers only boated below\r\nBridge, and were rarely seen above; indeed if they did go up stream\r\nthey were more than likely to be molested by Oppidans, who claimed that\r\npart of the river as their own watery domain.\r\n\r\n[SN: THE BOATS]\r\n\r\nThough boating must have gone on at Eton ever since the foundation of\r\nthe College, there would appear to have been no attempt at a regular\r\norganisation till the middle of the eighteenth century. In 1762 there\r\nwere three long boats, the “Snake,” the “Piper’s Green,” and “My\r\nGuineas Lion.” Then, as now, a captain of the boats presided over the\r\ncrews. In the early days of Keate’s reign (1811-1814), however, there\r\nseem to have been six boats--one 10-oar (the “Monarch,” as now), three\r\n8-oars, and two 6-oars, later on changed to four 8-oars and one 6-oar.\r\nAt that time, as has been the case in later years, the “Monarch,”\r\nthough it stood first on the list, and took precedence of all the other\r\nboats, was by no means the best manned, being, as has been the case\r\nin later years, something of a refuge for swagger boys who might not\r\nbe exceptionally fine oars. For this reason, though it was scarcely\r\nregarded with contempt, yet it could never either be looked up to as\r\naffording a pattern for the other crews. A place in it, however, was a\r\ngood thing to be secured.\r\n\r\nIn 1829[11] the Upper boats were the “Monarch,” “Britannia,” and\r\n“Etonian”; the Lower, “Victory,” “Thetis,” “Defiance,” “St. George,”\r\nand “Dreadnought.” The “Thetis,” it should be added, replaced the\r\n“Hibernia,” which disappeared as the “Trafalgar” had done. In 1830,\r\nhowever, one of the Lower boats was called the “Nelson.” At that time,\r\nit should be added, the Lower boats were made up of Lower boys and\r\nFifth Form indiscriminately. The revival of the “Nelson” in 1830 was\r\ndue to a revolt of the Lower boys in a dame’s house against the Fifth\r\nForm, which ended in the former putting a boat on the river in order\r\nto escape compulsory cricket. The boats used were clinker built, and\r\neither gig or wherry fashion, the eights mostly of the former. They\r\nhad rowlocks, but not outriggers, and must have been heavy as compared\r\nwith modern clinker-built eights. The oars were of the old type, square\r\nloomed, with a button nailed on.\r\n\r\nThe original practice in the Lower boats was to employ watermen (known\r\nas “cads”) as strokes and steerers. Jack Haverley, for instance, who\r\nin 1861 became the head waterman employed by the school, steered the\r\n“Defiance” as late as 1830. Another old custom practised on great\r\noccasions was for each boat to have in it some visitor to Eton. When,\r\nas sometimes happened, the honoured guest chanced to be a demure\r\ngentleman in black, he looked singularly out of place amidst the gay\r\ncostumes of the crew. In old-fashioned times this “sitter,” as he\r\nwas called, sat in the centre of the boat to keep it steady, but in\r\nlater years he reclined in the stern, usually with a large hamper of\r\nchampagne in front of him, it being the custom for a sitter to make the\r\nboys a present of wine. In those far-distant days little check would\r\nseem to have been placed upon the boys indulging freely in alcohol.\r\nThe writer’s uncle, who as Lord Walpole steered the “Etonian” in 1830,\r\noften told of the glorious bowls of punch which he and his friends used\r\nto consume. From the account he gave, the Upper boys at least were then\r\nallowed in most respects to do pretty much as they liked.\r\n\r\n[SN: A TRICK]\r\n\r\nThe authorities did not in any way interfere with anything connected\r\nwith boating, of the very existence of which, however, according to\r\na curious convention, they were supposed to be unaware. Dr. Keate\r\nindeed carried the practice of ignoring rowing to such an extent\r\nthat when Eton beat Westminster at Maidenhead in 1831, he only heard\r\nof it because the news of the victory was forced upon him. Dr.\r\nHawtrey, however, did recognise boating as an authorised institution;\r\nnevertheless he did nothing to remove the absurd custom of regarding\r\nboys going to the river as being out of bounds. In Keate’s day, as has\r\nelsewhere been said, the river was really forbidden before Easter,\r\nowing to an idea that the cold, chilly weather would produce illness\r\namongst the boys. Some mischievous “wet bobs,” taking advantage of\r\nthis prohibition, in 1829 played an amusing trick on the masters. The\r\nweather just before Easter happened to be very bad, and “the water”\r\nin consequence was forbidden. Nevertheless, the boats went up until a\r\ngrand capture of rebellious spirits was meditated by the authorities.\r\nBy some means this purpose became known, and the wags masked and\r\ndressed up eight “cads” to represent Upper boys. They had not reached\r\nUpper Hope before the scheme began to take effect. “Foolish boys! I\r\nknow you all. Come ashore,” sounded from one bank. “Come here, or you\r\nall will be expelled,” re-echoed from the other. At last, after a great\r\ndeal of shouting and galloping, the masks were dropped and the joke\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n[SN: SURLY HALL]\r\n\r\nIn old days, on certain evenings chosen by the captain of the boats,\r\nthe Upper crews had regular feasts at Surly, known as “Duck and\r\nGreen Pea” nights, where there was much conviviality, the crews being\r\nusually elated on the return journey, on which it was the custom to\r\npull leisurely at first. As, however, they passed Boveney Church\r\n(there was then no lock) they drew in their oars, and the watermen who\r\npulled stroke were called on for songs, which they sang solo, the boys\r\njoining in the chorus. After the watermen were dispensed with, the same\r\ncustoms continued. This entertainment was kept up from Boveney to the\r\nRushes, and then the pulling was “Hard all!” for fear of being late for\r\nAbsence, or, as it was then called, for fear of being “out afresh.”\r\nIt was on the voyage up, however, that the rivalry between the boats\r\nmostly took place; but whenever they rowed “Hard all!” silence was\r\nkept, and each boat tried to make a race of it with the one in front or\r\nbehind. After the feast at Surly, songs were sung till the time when\r\n“Oars” was called, when the crews rushed off to their boats in order to\r\nget back before Lock-Up. The Lower boats, which only escorted the Upper\r\nones up to Easy Bridge above the Rushes, met them on their return and\r\ntook part in the procession down to the Bridge.\r\n\r\nThese “Duck and Green Pea” nights afterwards developed into the “Check”\r\nnights (supposed to be so called from the shirts of the rowers) which\r\nDr. Goodford abolished in 1860. “Check” nights took place on every\r\nalternate Saturday after the 4th of June, at the end of the summer\r\nhalf, and to the last the crews of the Upper boats maintained the\r\ntraditional fare of duck and green peas for which Surly Hall was\r\ncelebrated. The old place, which saw so many generations of Etonians\r\nswallow copious libations of champagne, though it long survived the\r\nabolition of “Check” nights, is now itself but a memory of the past,\r\nhaving been pulled down in 1902.\r\n\r\nIn former days, on such evenings as boat-racing had taken place,\r\nEton was very lively indeed, the crews on their way home stopping to\r\ndrink the winners’ healths at the Christopher, and then walking down\r\narm-in-arm until they reached the school, where a crowd had collected.\r\nAs in later times, the winners were “hoisted” and carried along by\r\nthe wall amidst cheers. Windsor Bridge was then the winning-post\r\nof all races, the starting-point as a rule, it would appear, the\r\nFirework Eyot, which in old maps figures as Cooper’s Ait. The races,\r\nit should be added, were always for money, a good part of which in all\r\nprobability was spent in drink.\r\n\r\nThe 4th of June and Election Saturday were celebrated by the Procession\r\nof Boats in gala dress and by fireworks from the Eyot. Previous to 1814\r\nall the rowers in each boat had a fancy dress appropriate to the boat.\r\nIn after years the crews wore blue jackets with anchors embroidered on\r\nthe outside arm, clad in which they pulled all the way up to Surly. In\r\n1828 checked shirts were introduced, and this fashion has continued\r\never since. On special days the boats had tillers fashioned as\r\nserpents, and garlanded with oak leaves, instead of the ordinary wooden\r\ntiller or the rudder lines and yokes which they used in the races. On\r\nthe 4th of June and on Election Saturday the crews donned a special\r\ncostume, the main features of which were a dark-blue jacket with brass\r\nbuttons, hanging loose in front in order to show the distinctive\r\npattern of the shirt, over which the silken handkerchief worn round the\r\nneck hung. Up to about 1828 the coxswains of boats on such great days\r\nwore fancy costumes, but after that date every coxswain was dressed\r\nas a naval officer, increasing in rank according to the precedence to\r\nwhich his boat was entitled, and this custom is still followed on the\r\n4th of June. A somewhat curious coincidence in connection with the\r\nboats is that Lord Rosebery, Lord St. Aldwyn, and Lord Coventry in\r\ntheir Eton days all rowed bow in the _Monarch_--the ten-oar which seems\r\nalways to have been one of the boats.\r\n\r\nThe great event for Eton oarsmen was formerly the annual race against\r\nWestminster, which in the early part of the nineteenth century excited\r\nthe greatest interest. The proceedings in connection with the selection\r\nof the eight which was to try conclusions with the London school\r\nprovoked much the same interest and enthusiasm as that now evoked with\r\nregard to the Eton crew to be sent to Henley. The series of contests\r\nwith Westminster seems to have commenced in 1829 with a race for £100\r\na side. A regular course of training was always undergone, and for a\r\nnumber of years the match was the great event of the summer half. As\r\ntime went on, however, it was discontinued, though revived in 1860 as\r\npart of certain concessions made by the then headmaster, Dr. Goodford,\r\nin consideration of the abolition of “Check” nights and “Oppidan\r\nDinner.”\r\n\r\n[SN: “OPPIDAN DINNER”]\r\n\r\n“Oppidan Dinner” was a survival of the eighteenth century, and\r\nseemingly originated at the old Christopher. In later days, however, it\r\nwas held at the White Hart at Windsor, the number of boys sitting down\r\nbeing usually about fifty, each of whom paid something like eighteen\r\nshillings a head, which charge included wine. The time for this dinner\r\nwas at the end of the summer half, and those who took part in it were\r\nmembers of the Upper boats’ eleven and Sixth Form and a few other Upper\r\nboys. The captain of the boats managed everything, and sat at the head\r\nof the long table in a room which stretched right through the inn,\r\none end looking out upon the castle. The dinner began at four in the\r\nafternoon, an adjournment to Eton taking place for six o’clock Absence,\r\nafter which, about 6.30, the boys returned to the White Hart for\r\nwhat was called “dessert,” though every one expected to drink rather\r\nthan to eat. The chief show on the table consisted of decanters and\r\nglasses, all of a very cheap sort, it being well understood that few\r\nwould survive the wholesale breakage which almost invariably followed\r\nthe annual feast. Toasts were then given, the captain of the boats\r\nrising first of all to propose “The Queen.” This was drunk standing,\r\namidst an accompaniment of cheers. “The Prince of Wales and the rest\r\nof the Royal Family” followed, after which the boys waited eagerly for\r\nthe toasts which had more immediate reference to their own particular\r\ninterests and the songs which formed part of the evening’s programme.\r\nThe proceedings invariably closed with “Floreat Etona,” the drinking of\r\nwhich was the signal for breaking up. This toast not unnaturally evoked\r\nwild enthusiasm, and at one time it was the custom for every one to\r\nfling their glasses down and dash them to pieces on the table. About\r\nhalf-past eight the diners returned to Eton in very hilarious mood,\r\nthe captain of the boats and other popular athletes being generally\r\nsubjected to a very enthusiastic “hoisting.”\r\n\r\n[SN: CHANGES]\r\n\r\nThe Eton authorities, though perfectly aware of this somewhat\r\nBacchanalian feast, never took any notice of it till it was abolished\r\nin 1860. As, however, old drinking customs decreased, it became clear\r\nthat Oppidan Dinner was destined to disappear, and its existence was\r\nthreatened years before it was done away with. It was notorious that\r\nas a result of this banquet a number of boys came to Absence in a very\r\nfuddled condition, and the headmaster, when calling over the names, had\r\nto keep his eyes well fixed on the list for fear of seeing behaviour of\r\nwhich he would have been obliged to take notice. At Lock-Up time things\r\nwere worse still, and of the reeling crowd who surged down the High\r\nStreet some occasionally became so violent that it took six or seven\r\nboys to get them to bed.\r\n\r\nThe last Oppidan Dinner of 1859, however, was by all accounts the most\r\nsober on record. Indeed an aged waiter at the White Hart was moved\r\nalmost to tears at the small amount which had been drunk. Those who\r\ntook part in it were of more serious disposition and mind than their\r\nrollicking predecessors of former days, and most people agreed that the\r\ndinner had become an anachronism. When, however, in the following year\r\nR. H. Blake-Humfrey, captain of the boats, in unison with the present\r\nProvost, Mr. Warre (who had then just come to Eton as a master),\r\nconcurred in its suppression, not a few were taken by surprise, whilst\r\nmany an old Etonian of the old school shook his head and murmured that\r\nEton was going to the dogs.\r\n\r\nIn return for the abolition of “Oppidan Dinner” and “Check” nights, it\r\nwas agreed that the eight should be allowed annually to row at Henley,\r\nwhilst “boating bills” were instituted so as to put aquatics on the\r\nsame footing as cricket with respect to exemptions from six o’clock\r\nAbsence. It was also laid down that, on days in the summer half when\r\nthere was no five o’clock school, the crews of two eight oars should\r\nbe excused from “Absence” on condition of their undertaking to row to\r\nwithin sight of Cookham Lock. The “strokes” of the two boats were made\r\nresponsible, on their words of honour, to see that the conditions\r\nwere fulfilled. In addition to this, the whole of the High Street, as\r\nfar as Windsor Bridge, was placed within bounds, so that boys going to\r\nthe “Brocas” or returning from it were no longer obliged to “shirk”\r\nwhen they met masters. Finally the annual boat race with Westminster\r\nwas to be revived. That very year a race was duly rowed between Eton\r\nand Westminster at Putney, in which Eton won very easily. There was,\r\nhowever, nothing extraordinary about this, for since the old days when\r\nEton and Westminster had been rival schools the former had greatly\r\nincreased in size. Westminster had in reality barely a chance, for it\r\nhad been only with considerable difficulty that an eight had been got\r\ntogether at all. Though some of the Westminster oars were good men,\r\nthe crews that rowed against Eton from 1860 to 1864 were entirely\r\noutmatched in weight and strength. In addition to which, in 1861 and\r\n1862 the Eton eight possessed a tower of strength in their captain\r\nand stroke, Mr. R. H. Blake-Humfrey, who, it should be added, has, in\r\nhis introduction to the _Eton Boating Book_, given such a clear and\r\nexcellent account of the early history of Eton rowing. The race between\r\nthe two schools did not take place in 1863; instead, the Westminster\r\nboys came down to Eton on Election Saturday and had supper with the\r\nEton crews in the meadow opposite Surly Hall. Rowing back to Windsor,\r\nthe visitors very nearly became involved in what might have been a\r\nserious catastrophe, for the cox of the Westminster eight, not being\r\nused to the river, steered the wrong side of the posts above Boveney\r\nLock, and but for the warning shout of the steerer of the Eton eight,\r\nthe Westminster boat would probably have gone over the Weir. The match\r\nof 1864, in which Eton won by 27 seconds, was the last occasion upon\r\nwhich the two eights met. Since then the schools have developed in\r\ndifferent directions, with the result that the old cordial relations\r\nare now in all probability for ever at an end.\r\n\r\nModern Eton has produced several famous oarsmen--notably Mr. S. D.\r\nMuttlebury, whose first triumph was winning the “Lower boy pulling”\r\nwith S. S. Sharpe in 1881. The present boating colours are the Eight,\r\nUpper Boat Choices, Upper Boats, Lower Boat Choices, Lower Boats,\r\nthe latter of which all adopted the old Defiance colour in 1885. For\r\nthis and other information I have to thank Mr. F. F. V. Scrulton, the\r\npresent captain of the boats.\r\n\r\n[SN: SWIMMING]\r\n\r\nSwimming has always been in great favour with Eton boys, but in old\r\ndays the authorities paid no attention to it, and no effort was made\r\nto check boys who could not swim from risking their lives. There\r\nappears, however, to have been some regular bathing-place as long ago\r\nas 1529, for it is chronicled that in that year a boy was drowned at\r\n“le watering place,” the site of which, however, is unknown. The first\r\nteacher apparently was a Frenchman named Champeau, nicknamed by the\r\nboys Slipgibbet, who about 1829 taught swimming with corks, which\r\nstate of affairs continued till all unauthorised teachers of natation\r\nwere swept away. Champeau, also playfully known as Shampoo, gave his\r\nlessons at the spot opposite to “Athens.” The old Frenchman must have\r\nbeen a competent teacher, for three miles was often accomplished by\r\nsome of his pupils, and headers off Windsor Bridge were not uncommon.\r\nNevertheless, fatal accidents intermittently occurred. In the early\r\npart of the nineteenth century a boy was drowned close to Boveney\r\nMeads, in the presence of many big schoolfellows, of whom not one could\r\ndive to bring up the body, though it could be plainly seen by those who\r\nstooped over the sides of the boats--fortunately at that time broad\r\nof beam, otherwise more boys would probably have perished. Sixty or\r\nseventy years earlier young Barnard (afterwards Dr. Barnard, Headmaster\r\nand Provost) had only escaped a watery grave owing to the successful\r\nefforts of his schoolfellow, Jacob Bryant, a delicate boy but a good\r\nswimmer. In later years Bryant became a scholar and philologist well in\r\nadvance of his age. The average of deaths from drowning was once, it is\r\nsaid, about one boy in three years. This bad state of affairs was ended\r\nin 1840 when George Augustus Selwyn, with William Evans, organised\r\nswimming and instituted the “passing” at “Cuckoo Weir,” which has now\r\nbecome one of the regular features of a “wet bob’s” career.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Collegers at one time bathed at the oak in the playing\r\nfields, the Lower at a spot not far away, which bore the significant\r\nname of “Deadman’s Hole.” Near by was the old wharf, done away with\r\nin 1840, where the Collegers used to keep their boats. In those days,\r\nhowever, they went but little on the river, preferring to concentrate\r\ntheir energies in preparing for the annual matches at cricket and\r\nfootball with the Oppidans. The rivalry was then very keen, and in\r\nwinter was even shown by fierce snowball fights, in which both sides\r\noften suffered severely. It may seem strange that seventy boys could\r\nface six hundred, but some of the biggest boys in the school were\r\nCollegers, as they were not superannuated until they were nineteen.\r\n\r\nAbout 1828 the annual matches, both at cricket and football, between\r\nthe Oppidans and Collegers were done away with. They were always the\r\nmost stoutly contested games of the year, and put both parties on their\r\nmettle far beyond the excitement of any other match. A good deal of\r\nbitterness was sometimes displayed, and now and then a smack on the\r\nhead or a designed “shin” were given and received; but, on the whole,\r\nthese matches did something to draw Oppidans and Collegers together,\r\nand their abolition is to be deplored, though, in the present age, the\r\ngreat excess of Oppidans would, it must be confessed, have rendered\r\ntheir continuance difficult.\r\n\r\n[SN: ST. ANDREW’S DAY]\r\n\r\nOf all the various contests which formerly took place between Collegers\r\nand Oppidans the annual match at the wall on St. Andrew’s Day alone\r\nsurvives, and has lost none of its interest, though the two elevens are\r\nchosen from seventy Collegers and from close on a thousand Oppidans. In\r\nreality the chances of victory are in a great degree equalised owing to\r\nthe fact that whilst the Collegers have every opportunity of playing\r\nthe game during the whole of the time--usually about six years--during\r\nwhich they remain at Eton, only a small number of Oppidans play at\r\nall till within two years of their leaving school. It would here be\r\nsuperfluous to enter upon any detailed description of the game. [SN:\r\nTHE “WALL”] Suffice it to say that it is played within a narrow strip\r\nof ground some twenty feet wide and close up against the old wall built\r\nin 1717, the goals being the tree with a white mark at the end towards\r\nSlough, and the door of Weston’s Yard at the Eton end. The origin of\r\nthis peculiar form of football is very obscure. Mr. E. C. Benthall,\r\nK.S., Keeper of the Wall in the present year, 1911, who has most\r\nobligingly furnished me with some interesting information, believes\r\nthat it originated from “passage football,” and doubts if it was ever\r\nplayed very seriously till about one hundred years ago, at which time\r\nit was an entirely different game from what it is now. In spite of its\r\nquaint terms, it would seem to be of no great antiquity, at least in\r\nanything like its present form. The wall itself dates from 1717, but\r\nabout the earliest record of any regular game there dates from the\r\nfirst decade of the nineteenth century, at which time any one who\r\nchose seems to have been allowed to play, with the result that there\r\nwere usually eighteen or twenty a side. It was then practically the\r\nonly form of football popular at Eton, though occasionally something\r\napproaching to the modern “Field Game” was played in the open. Till\r\n1841, however, such forms of relaxation were discouraged by the\r\nmasters. Nevertheless, on the piece of grass between the path and the\r\nriver in Lower Club the Collegers, up till about 1863, played a variety\r\nknown as “Lower College.” This was probably a link between the field\r\nand wall games, for it had “shies” and “goals.” In early days the wall\r\ngame was played on a much wider strip of ground than is at present the\r\ncase. The bully was not its essential feature, and the ball was often\r\nrun down the whole length of the wall. Sixty years or so ago matches of\r\nDames _v._ Tutors were occasionally played, and during one of these the\r\nball somehow was pitched right on the top of the wall, along which it\r\nran for some eight yards before coming to a dead standstill on the top.\r\n\r\nThe rules were then, of course, more elastic than those now in use, and\r\nsince they were drawn up in 1849 the game has undergone various minor\r\nchanges, including the curtailment of the space at the wall to its\r\npresent limits and the toleration (about 1851) of “furking” the ball\r\nback in calx.\r\n\r\nAt one time considerable savagery seems to have been displayed by the\r\nrival teams, in consequence of which Dr. Hawtrey once suspended all\r\nplay for three weeks, and in 1851 it was actually proposed to abolish\r\nthe annual match on St. Andrew’s Day on account of the ill-feeling\r\nwhich was said to be engendered between Oppidans and Collegers. Of late\r\nyears, however, the historic contest is remarkable for the good-humour\r\nshown by both sides. A quaint figure at the annual match from 1847\r\nup to 1888, the year before he fell ill, was old Powell, whose\r\nold-fashioned velveteen coat and high top-hat were survivals of another\r\nage. During his long superintendence of the wall he had seen many\r\ngenerations of Collegers and Oppidans contending for goals and shies.\r\nAfter ten years of confinement and suffering he died in 1899.\r\n\r\nThe wall game is as different from any other form of football as it is\r\npossible to imagine. To one unacquainted with its intricacies, nothing\r\ncan be more curious than the bully close up against the wall, and the\r\nefforts of those forming it to prevent kicks sending the ball out--that\r\nis to say, beyond the line marked as the limit within which play takes\r\nplace. The rules really amount to a sort of complicated creed, which\r\nhas been handed on from one generation of Collegers to another. A\r\ngood deal of the game is mystifying to a spectator unacquainted with\r\nits intricacies. A “calx bully,” for instance, is highly difficult to\r\nexplain, whilst the necessary preliminaries for a “shy” at goals are\r\noften, owing to the confusion of the struggle, visible only to the\r\numpire. The summit of a wall-player’s ambition is to throw a “goal,”\r\nwhich feat, in the annual St. Andrew’s Day match, has only been\r\naccomplished three times within the last hundred years--in every case\r\nby a Colleger. W. Marcon threw one in 1842, when College won by a goal\r\nand 19 shies, 17 of which were got by H. Phillott in rapid succession.\r\nH. J. Mordaunt, captain of the eleven in 1886, threw another in 1885,\r\nwhen he hit the door just at the bottom. [SN: A HISTORIC GOAL] The name\r\nof this fine athlete, the writer (who knew him at Eton) is informed, is\r\nstill a household word in College, where his goal is held in greater\r\nreverence than that scored in 1909. Mordaunt’s was an unaided effort,\r\nwhilst the latter seems to have been rather lucky. Nevertheless, Finlay\r\nand Creasy deserved the greatest credit for their presence of mind. In\r\n1858, it should be added, a throw by Hollingworth was disputed.\r\n\r\nThough of all pastimes the wall game is least adapted for summer,\r\ntime-honoured usage prescribed--and after a discontinuance for four\r\nyears now once again prescribes--that at six o’clock on the morning of\r\nAscension Day a mixed team of Collegers and Oppidans should meet at the\r\n“Wall.” The origin of this custom I have been unable to ascertain. Like\r\nthe game played on the last evening of last summer half, it probably\r\ntook its rise from boyish enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the wall game, the name of James Kenneth\r\nStephen--the gifted J. K. S., who in his prime was so unfortunately\r\nsnatched away by death--will never be forgotten. Captain of the College\r\nteam in 1876-1877, he was a great supporter of “noster ludus muralis,”\r\nas he has left on record in his “Quo Musa Tendis,” one stanza of which\r\nruns--\r\n\r\n  There’s another wall with a field beside it,\r\n    A wall not wholly unknown to fame,\r\n  For a game’s played there which most who’ve tried it\r\n    Declare is a truly noble game.\r\n\r\nCollege, it is pleasant to know, seems unlikely ever to forget this\r\ntrue son of Eton, for on the evening of St. Andrew’s Day each of the\r\nwall team in turn drinks “In piam memoriam, J. K. S.,” every raising of\r\nthe cup as it is passed around being followed by a cheer.\r\n\r\nA brilliant young contemporary of J. K. S. who played at the wall in\r\n1880 is happily still left to us. This is Mr. A. C. Benson, whose fine\r\nintellect and delightful achievements in the fields of literature have\r\nrendered his name well known to that greater public which joins with\r\nEtonians in admiration of his work.\r\n\r\nCollege may well be proud of having produced two such men as these.\r\n\r\nTill the middle of the fifties in the last century the wall game was\r\nalso played at the red brick wall in front of the boys’ entrance to the\r\nhouse which about 1790 was built overlooking the Timbralls. For nearly\r\na quarter of a century after play had ceased to take place there, the\r\ncalces marked in chalk could still be discerned. The field game is a\r\nrather modern institution. As has before been said, ordinary football\r\ndoes not seem to have been very popular amongst Etonians of a hundred\r\nyears ago, though in the last century it gradually rose in favour. A\r\ncurious character of other days was old Strugnal, who was celebrated\r\nfor tightening the bladder of a football by means of blowing through a\r\npiece of tobacco pipe placed in his mouth. On the whole, the annals of\r\nEton football, a primitive form of which in the eighteenth century was\r\nknown as “goals,” with the exception of some exciting house matches, do\r\nnot possess any great interest.\r\n\r\n[SN: CRICKET]\r\n\r\nCricket, unlike football, was popular at Eton over two hundred years\r\nago, having been played as early as 1706, and in high favour in\r\nHorace Walpole’s day. About the first great Etonian cricketer was the\r\neighth Lord Winchilsea, who afterwards became chief patron of the\r\nfamous Hambledon Club. At one time he made an attempt to introduce an\r\ninnovation by increasing the stumps to four, but the change was never\r\npopular, though in the match between the Gentlemen and Players in 1837,\r\nin order to equalise the contest, the latter undertook to defend four\r\nstumps instead of three. In 1751 three matches for £1500 were played\r\nbetween the Gentlemen of England and Eton College, Past and Present;\r\nthe former won the stakes, winning two out of the three matches. The\r\nplayers were dressed in silk jackets, trousers, and velvet caps. In\r\n1791 Lord Winchilsea made 54 runs in a contest between Old Etonians\r\n_versus_ the Gentlemen of England. This was played at old “Lord’s,”\r\nwhere Dorset Square now stands. In the same year the school beat the\r\nMaidenhead Club by four wickets. Keate was one of the seven Collegers\r\nplaying, and scored 0 and 4, while in the second innings Way “nipped\r\nhimself out” for 11. Five years later a match seems to have taken place\r\nagainst Westminster on Hounslow Heath, in defiance of the Headmaster’s\r\nstrict orders; it resulted in the defeat of Eton and the flogging of\r\nall the Eleven!\r\n\r\nIn those days there was a good deal of jollity in connection with the\r\ncricket in the playing fields, and the boys were allowed to do many\r\nthings which would be thought very reprehensible to-day. Up to about\r\n1827, for instance, a beer tent used to be allowed when cricket matches\r\nwere played. Two or three years later Eton cricket for some reason or\r\nother admittedly deteriorated, a disastrous state of affairs which\r\nwas thus explained by one of the “cads” who used to hover about the\r\nshooting fields: “Lord, sir, they never has won a match since the beer\r\ntent got the sack, and never will no more.” This tent, where “beer\r\nand baccy” were the order of the day before it gave offence to the\r\nhigher powers, was kept, at every match, by the veteran Jem Miller\r\nfor the accommodation of the “cads,” Broconalian Club, and other\r\nloungers, and loudly and lustily did they cheer the boys with their\r\nstentorian lungs. It was from this tent that one of the best bowlers\r\nand batters Eton ever produced--in after years a prominent divine at\r\nKing’s--was encouraged by the deafening shouts of “Goo it, my dear\r\nHarding; goo it, my dear boy,” when he scored 86 runs off his own bat\r\nagainst Messrs. Ward, Vigne, Tanner, and others of the Epsom Club. It\r\nwas on this memorable day, too, that he made a tremendous hit over the\r\nshooting-field trees, high in the air, of course, when a bargeman from\r\nthe tent, lost in amazement at the hit, thundered out, “There she goes\r\nfor Chessy [Chertsey] Church, by Jingo!” it being a prominent mark on\r\nthe river for the bargees.\r\n\r\n[SN: “WATER BOILS,” “MAKE TEA”]\r\n\r\nAccording to all accounts, cricket in those less strenuous days was\r\nnot taken any too seriously. Boys did not change their clothing to\r\nplay it, though they did so for football. Once during a match in Upper\r\nClub a fight was reported to be going on in the playing fields, and\r\nin a few minutes gentlemen, spectators, and cricketers not actually\r\nplaying scampered over Sheep’s Bridge, eager to witness the contest.\r\nFormerly tea in Upper Club was made by fags. The well-known cries of\r\n“Water boils!” “Make tea!” originated during this now obsolete state of\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThough all Bacchanalian gaiety had disappeared from the playing fields\r\nby the middle of the last century, a somewhat free-and-easy spirit\r\nstill prevailed, and on the occasion of school matches there was\r\nusually a good deal of fun, especially when Billy Boland--a celebrated\r\ncharacter and _bon vivant_ of the past, who was supposed to have been\r\nthe original of Fred Bayham in Thackeray’s novel of _The Newcomes_--was\r\npresent. He it was who once, after lunch during a cricket match between\r\nthe school and I Zingari, presented Dr. Hawtrey, the then headmaster,\r\nwith the Freedom of the Club in a deal box, and wound up a mock speech\r\nwith the toast: “Floreat Etona et vivat ‘Nitidissimus’ Hawtrey!” This\r\nwas peculiarly appropriate, for with his velvet-collared coat the\r\nDoctor was the smartest of men and wore the best-varnished boots in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n[SN: THE FIRST MATCH AT LORD’S]\r\n\r\nThe first regular match played by Eton against a public school appears\r\nto have taken place in 1799, when an Eton eleven met Westminster at\r\nold Lord’s. On this occasion Eton in their innings made only 47 runs.\r\nWestminster then went in and scored 13, when the stumps were drawn,\r\nwith five wickets to fall. The match was said to be “postponed,” but\r\nthere is no account to be found of its ever having been resumed. Next\r\nyear Eton had an easy victory, making a score of 213 in one innings,\r\nagainst Westminster’s 54 and 31. Curiously enough, the Collegers\r\nat that time constituted the strength of the eleven and made the\r\nbiggest scores. Benjamin Drury, afterwards an assistant master, Joseph\r\nThackeray, and Thomas Lloyd, elder brother of the bishop, were the\r\nbowlers. Poor Lloyd, who beat the Westminster innings off his own bat,\r\ndied after the holidays from the effects of a chill which he caught\r\nduring the match. This would seem to have been the last match with\r\nWestminster.\r\n\r\nThe first Eton and Harrow contest took place in 1805 at Lord’s, when\r\nEton won in a single innings. On this occasion Byron made 7 and 2 for\r\nthe beaten school. Eight of the winning eleven (among whom was Lord\r\nStratford de Redcliffe) were King’s scholars. After this no authentic\r\nrecord exists of any match till 1818, when Harrow beat Eton. Apparently\r\nthe whole thing was rather a fiasco; only two of the best Eton men\r\nwere present at Lord’s, the rest of the eleven being made up of such\r\nEtonians as could be collected on the ground. In the following year,\r\nhowever, Eton beat Harrow in one innings; in 1822 Harrow beat Eton. In\r\n1832 Eton scored a great triumph, beating Harrow and Winchester each\r\nin one innings. The match of 1841 was remarkable for the great innings\r\nof Emilius Bayley, who made 153, up to then the highest score ever\r\nachieved by any player in a public school match. Oddly enough, however,\r\nthat same year Eton was beaten hollow by Winchester. In 1846 Eton\r\nrepeated the great performance of 1832 and again vanquished Harrow and\r\nWinchester each in a single innings. One of the eleven on this occasion\r\nwas J. W. Chitty (in after life the Rt. Hon. Lord Justice Chitty), who\r\nplayed four years for Eton, in the last of which--1847--he was captain\r\nof the eleven.\r\n\r\nA great character well known to Eton cricketers of the forties was\r\nM’Niven minor, who, Mr. Coleridge declares, in his interesting\r\nrecollections, was in Sixth Form, the football team, and the eight,\r\nas well as in the eleven. Commonly called “Snivey,” this fine athlete\r\nseems to have been very notorious for his wild eccentricities and\r\noddities of dress, which, however, in nowise impaired a universal\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\nDuring the fifties of the last century Eton cricket was not in a\r\nvery flourishing state. The smart thing was to be in the boats, and\r\n“dry-bobs” were rather looked down upon till 1860, when a strenuous\r\neffort began to be made to end the long series of reverses which\r\nthe school had sustained in its annual matches against Harrow. The\r\nengagement of a professional cricketer and improvements in Upper Club\r\naroused great interest, and so much excitement was the result that\r\nwhen in that year Eton made rather a good fight at Lord’s, all sorts\r\nof absurd rumours were born of the indignation provoked by defeat. It\r\nwas said, for instance, that Daniel, the Harrow captain, was really a\r\nprofessional in disguise--this was because he wore whiskers and a straw\r\nhat!\r\n\r\n[SN: “POCKETS”]\r\n\r\nIn 1861, when the late Mr. R. A. H. Mitchell, who afterwards as a\r\nmaster did so much for Eton cricket, was captain, the match was\r\nunfinished, and only in the next year did Eton score its first victory\r\nagainst Harrow since 1850. The finish (like that of 1910) gave rise to\r\nmuch excitement, and feeling ran very high, both sides indulging in\r\nmerciless chaff. The report that the Harrow headmaster--Dr. Butler--had\r\nshortly before issued an order that all side-pockets were to be sewn\r\nup, with a view to prevent slouching, gave the Eton boys an opportunity\r\nof which they were not slow to take advantage, and accordingly the\r\nground resounded with yells of “Pockets” throughout the day. The hero\r\nof the day was A. S. Teape, whose bowling did so much to win the match,\r\nat the close of which he was accorded an enthusiastic ovation. A large\r\nproportion of the spectators were quite carried away by excitement, and\r\nseveral fights took place between members of the rival schools, whilst\r\ntwo well-known Eton and Harrow “cads,” both pretty well “sprung,”\r\nstarted a little mill on their own account, much to the amusement of\r\nthe onlookers. Probably the encounter was a prearranged affair, for\r\nthe old rascals took good care not to hurt each other, and reaped a\r\nconsiderable harvest by sending the hat round afterwards. One of the\r\nwinning team that year was Mr. Alfred Lubbock, the great Eton cricketer\r\nwho became captain in 1863, in which year he made the magnificent score\r\nof 174, not out, against Winchester. Every old Etonian should read\r\nthe book written by him some little time ago, one chapter of which\r\nwas contributed by his son, Mr. Robin Lubbock, K.S., a member of the\r\neleven of 1896-1897. A young man of high promise, he most unfortunately\r\nmet with an early death through a sad accident in the hunting-field.\r\nThe names of Lubbock, Lyttelton, and Studd will always be associated\r\nwith the history of Eton cricket. For six successive years--1861 to\r\n1866--there was always a Lubbock in the eleven, whilst three Lytteltons\r\n(one of whom was the present Headmaster) played at Lord’s in 1872, and\r\nthree Studds in 1877.\r\n\r\n[SN: A CURIOUS “RAG”]\r\n\r\nIn former days there was often much rowdiness after an Eton and Harrow\r\nmatch, which, for some unknown reason, seemed to send a certain amount\r\nof hot-blooded youngsters almost mad. In the early eighties of the last\r\ncentury the present writer witnessed a curious development of this\r\nspirit. Returning to Eton in the evening after the match was over,\r\nhe found himself in a railway carriage filled with a number of boys\r\nhe did not know, together with one old Etonian, apparently a newly\r\njoined subaltern of some cavalry regiment. For a little time after\r\nthe train had started the party more or less calmly discussed the\r\nmatch, but all of a sudden the old Etonian, who was in a most excited\r\nstate, began to smash up the carriage, tearing down the hat-racks and\r\nbreaking the windows, in which work of destruction he was cheerfully\r\nseconded by his companions, who eventually, when the train came to the\r\nbridge over the river near Windsor, threw most of the cushions and\r\nall the advertisement placards, which they had wrenched off, into\r\nthe river. The writer was the more struck by this scene on account of\r\nthe party not in any way suggesting that he should join in it; and as\r\na matter of fact, reading a paper and smoking (nearly every boy then\r\nsmoked when going to or leaving Eton), he sat undisturbed upon the\r\nonly cushion not thrown out of window. He was a very small boy at the\r\ntime, and the wreckers, who were big ones, treated him throughout with\r\ngreat courtesy. The damage, owing to the great crowd of boys returning\r\nto Eton, was apparently not discovered by the station officials on\r\nthe arrival of the train at Windsor, nor was anything heard of it\r\nafterwards by the school, though the writer has reason to believe\r\nthat some other carriages were also wrecked on the same train. In all\r\nprobability the authorities, aware of the impossibility of detecting\r\nthe offenders, preferred to let the whole matter rest. It was a curious\r\ninstance of the passion for destruction which occasionally takes\r\npossession of youth.\r\n\r\nThe first match between Eton and Winchester seems to have been played\r\nin 1826, when Winchester won. Afterwards, up to 1854, it was played\r\nat Lord’s. Success was pretty evenly divided till 1845, when a tie\r\nproduced great interest and excitement. In that year the late Provost,\r\nDr. Hornby, was a member of the Eton team. In old days the Winchester\r\nboys played in tall white beaver hats, but the Etonians wore straw. In\r\n1856 the match was played at Winchester, neither school being allowed\r\nto come to town, and since then the elevens have met on the Eton and\r\nWinchester ground alternately.\r\n\r\nSixpenny, which appears to have taken its name from the Sixpenny Club,\r\nfounded for Lower boys by G. J. Boudier, 1832-1838, captain of the\r\neleven, an Etonian who is said to once have thrashed a bargee three\r\ntimes his own size, was formerly a much-coveted Lower boy colour. It\r\nwas, however, done away with in 1898, but Upper Sixpenny is still an\r\nimportant cricket colour for Uppers who are also Juniors, as it is now\r\nthe first colour a young cricketer can obtain at Eton, where, if you\r\nonce get a name as a promising bat, bowler, or field, it is difficult\r\nto lose it, whereas if a boy does not start well, little attention is\r\nafterwards paid to him.\r\n\r\nA curious modern Eton cricket institution is “Second Upper Club,”\r\nnominally the second game in the school, but in reality consisting of\r\nUpper boys who are distinguished in the school, mostly in some other\r\nline than cricket, though a number of quite good players also belong. A\r\nfew years ago some of the games played by Second Upper Club degenerated\r\ninto huge “rags,” ending with an early adjournment to little Brown’s,\r\nwhence, after a huge tea had been partaken of, every one went off to\r\nbathe.\r\n\r\n[SN: AGAR’S PLOUGH]\r\n\r\nA feature of modern Eton is “Agar’s Plough,” just across Datchet Lane,\r\nwell laid out for the purposes of the school games. This large tract\r\nof land was saved from the speculative builder by purchase in 1895, and\r\nhere, eight years later, for the first time was played the Eton and\r\nWinchester match. As a cricket ground Agar’s Plough possesses several\r\nadvantages over the historic Upper Club, known in the distant past as\r\nthe Upper Shooting Fields. One of the chief gains is, of course, the\r\nabsence of big trees to confuse the light. Whether, however, Upper\r\nClub is discarded for school matches or not, it will always remain a\r\nhallowed spot in the recollection of old Etonians who as boys knew it\r\nin its summer glory. Full of picturesque associations and shaded by\r\nstately elms planted in the days of the Commonwealth, the beautiful old\r\nground has seen many a generation of Eton boys pass o’er its pleasant\r\nsward of green. Besides Agar’s Plough modern Eton possesses other\r\nfacilities for games undreamt of in less luxurious days. Amongst these\r\nare the new racquets courts near the gasworks which in 1902-3 took the\r\nplace of those down Keate’s Lane.\r\n\r\nAt the present day there is no tennis at Eton, but a tennis court\r\nappears to have existed between 1600 and 1603, though, curiously\r\nenough, its site has never been ascertained. Near the new racquets\r\ncourts thirty-eight new fives courts have been built since 1870.\r\n\r\nThe excellent game of fives, which has now attained a comparatively\r\nwidespread popularity, originated in the spaces between the Chapel\r\nbuttresses being utilised for play. The one next the flight of steps,\r\nwith its so-called pepper-box, is the model from which all modern\r\nfives courts are built. The first of these were constructed at Eton\r\nin Trotman’s gardens in 1847, and enjoyed great popularity in their\r\nearly days. Since, however, the number of fives courts has been largely\r\naugmented, the old courts seem to have fallen into great disrepute. In\r\nthe writer’s day, although such new courts as existed were naturally\r\nthe most in request, boys still ran to obtain one of the old ones. It\r\nwas a rule that no court could be considered taken unless there was\r\nsome one actually upon it, to claim it by the right of occupancy. The\r\nconsequence was that they always became the reward of the swift, or of\r\nthose who were let out of school earlier than the rest; keen struggles\r\nensued, and the stream of runners flying down Keate’s Lane day after\r\nday testified to the eagerness of spirit which could prompt boys to\r\nexhaust themselves merely to obtain the chance of getting a game. It\r\nwas then the custom for the boy first in a court to mark his right of\r\npossession by putting down his hat in it. The original fives court\r\nbetween the buttresses of the Chapel had been long unused, though there\r\nwas sometimes a knock-up between Lower boys waiting to go into school.\r\n\r\n[SN: COLOURS]\r\n\r\nColours at Eton, except those of the eleven and of the eight, which\r\nin some form or other probably existed as far back as the eighteenth\r\ncentury, are of modern origin. The parti-coloured scarlet and Eton blue\r\nshirt of the field only dates from 1860, and the dark blue and red of\r\nthe wall from 1861. A year later saw the birth of house colours. About\r\nthe same time a great craze for wearing colours on every possible\r\noccasion made itself felt. In old days boys had been supposed to shirk\r\nmasters when in change clothes, but now a tendency to run into an\r\nopposite extreme produced an agitation in favour of greater laxity\r\nregarding dress. The authorities, however, rightly deeming that Eton\r\nshould retain its old traditions as to tall hats and the like, stood\r\nfirm, every reasonable concession having long before that date been\r\ngranted. Only quite recently indeed have boys been allowed to answer\r\ntheir names at Absence in change clothes, an innovation which many an\r\nold Etonian, mindful of the ancient traditions of the school, must\r\nsurely deplore.\r\n\r\nThis chapter cannot be concluded without some reference to the Eton\r\nHunt, as the beagles have sometimes been facetiously called. The\r\npack in question would appear to have first been started about 1840\r\nunder the auspices of Anstruther-Thompson, in after life one of the\r\nbest-known and most popular Masters of Hounds in England. For some\r\nyears later its existence was rather precarious, at times resembling\r\nthat of a contemporary College pack which was once declared to consist\r\nof a single long-backed Scotch terrier. From the earliest days of the\r\nhunt, however, there appears to have been some attempt at a regular\r\norganisation. The whips, for instance, had E.C.H. on the buttons of\r\ntheir coats, which Dr. Hawtrey (Edward Craven), who of course knew of\r\nthe existence of the hunt, though he did not recognise it, interpreted\r\nas a delicate compliment to himself. At one time the Collegers and\r\nOppidans each had a separate pack of their own, but these were\r\namalgamated in 1866.\r\n\r\n[SN: HYSTERICAL SENTIMENT]\r\n\r\nDrag hunts were formerly rather popular with the followers of the\r\nEton beagles, and sometimes very good runs were enjoyed. One of the\r\n“cads” about the wall, known as Polly Green, an active fellow who used\r\nto go across country uncommonly well, afforded very good sport. At\r\nthat time the beagles had not been recognised by the authorities, and\r\nwere kept more or less secretly a good way out of bounds, in a small\r\nkennel at the corner of the Brocas near the river. Eventually, however,\r\nthe pack became known to every one, including the masters, who, with\r\ngreat good sense, far from discouraging it, gave it encouragement\r\nand approval, and thereby raised the character of the sport whilst\r\nincreasing its popularity in the school. In 1884 the mastership of Lord\r\nNewtown-Butler--now Major the Earl of Lanesborough--was particularly\r\nsuccessful, this gallant and popular Guardsman having ever been the\r\nincarnation of geniality and good-natured fun. There is no need to deal\r\nhere with the absurd agitation of so-called humanitarians for the\r\npack’s suppression. Suffice it to say that the greatest credit is due\r\nto the present Headmaster for having refused to listen to the voice of\r\nhysterical sentimentalism. May his successors be equally firm!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[11] Those interested in this period should not fail to read _Eton in\r\n1829-1830_, a translation of a boating diary written in Greek by Thomas\r\nSelwyn. The translator and editor, the present Provost of Eton, Dr.\r\nWarre, D.D., M.V.O., well known to several generations of Etonians as\r\nAssistant and Headmaster, did more than any one else to improve Eton\r\nrowing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX YESTERDAY AND TO-DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old type of Eton Masters and Fellows is now practically extinct,\r\nbut thirty or forty years ago quite a number of them were still\r\nflourishing. Not a few were quaint and eccentric figures both in their\r\nappearance and their ways. About the quaintest of all was the Rev. F.\r\nE. Durnford, universally known as “Judy,” who was Lower master from\r\n1864 to 1877. He has been aptly described as “a sort of Ancient Mariner\r\nin academic garb,” for he had a strange weather-beaten aspect, the\r\nresult, no doubt, of having for many years battled with successive\r\nhordes of impish Lower boys--“nahty, nahty boys,” as he called\r\nthem--much of whose time was occupied in giving the good old man all\r\nthe trouble they could. Mr. Durnford, though he could never master the\r\npronunciation of French, was somewhat fond of interlarding Gallicisms\r\nin his discourse, which, of course, never failed to arouse unbridled\r\nmerriment. He himself was perfectly aware of his imperfections as a\r\nlinguist, and would at times attempt to allay such outbursts by the\r\nsomewhat pathetic remark, “Ah, boys, it’s my misfortune, not my\r\nfault.” He was a very good-natured old man, whose main failing perhaps\r\nwas being inclined towards an excess of leniency, in which respect his\r\nsuccessor, the Rev. J. L. Joynes, erred far less.\r\n\r\n[SN: “OLD JIMMY”]\r\n\r\nThis pedagogue, though the most kindly of men, would stand no\r\nnonsense. Many will remember him in Lower School, with the picturesque\r\ninterior of which, full of old woodwork cut with the names of vanished\r\ngenerations, his personality accorded so well. He had rather a peculiar\r\nvoice, and pronounced words like “tutor” and “nuisance,” “tootor” and\r\n“noosance.” Rather a better preacher than most of his colleagues,\r\nhis sermons in “old Lower Chapel” were sometimes marked by a certain\r\noriginality which caused them to be listened to with interest and\r\nattention. In his school days “Jimmy Joynes,” or “old Jimmy,” as he was\r\naffectionately called, had been captain of the College team at the wall\r\nand a fine fives player, and as a master he continued to take great\r\ninterest in the latter game, giving a cup to be played for by the house\r\nover which he presided before becoming Lower Master. In the latter\r\ncapacity, though an extremely kind-hearted man, he could, as was well\r\nknown to the boys under his charge, be severe enough upon occasion, and\r\nthe writer well remembers seeing him administer what was considered a\r\ntremendous flogging to a delinquent, who afterwards had a distinguished\r\nmilitary career. This consisted of some thirty-two cuts laid on with\r\ntwo birches, to the great astonishment of a number of Lower boys\r\npresent at the execution. The victim, a boy of great pluck, was little\r\ndisturbed by this castigation, though it was very much more serious\r\nthan most of the many floggings he had suffered before. As a matter of\r\nfact, it was only the swishings of the Lower master which inflicted\r\nany real physical pain, the few strokes which the Head, Dr. Hornby,\r\nadministered being generally more in the nature of a formal reproof\r\nthan anything else--at least that was the experience of the present\r\nwriter, who well remembers that on retiring from the torture-chamber\r\nnext Upper School he reflected that if one was to be flogged at all,\r\nthe thing could not be conducted in a more pleasant and dignified way.\r\n\r\n[SN: DR. HORNBY]\r\n\r\nIn his relations with the boys Dr. Hornby was ever a great gentleman,\r\nas the following incident, which occurred during the writer’s Eton\r\ndays, will show. Two of the sons of a celebrated potentate were then\r\nat the school, and Queen Victoria took the warmest interest in them;\r\nthe eldest, in particular, was a great favourite of hers. One day,\r\nowing to some untruthfulness in connection with work, this young\r\nPrince was complained of, and though he might have got off by claiming\r\n“first fault” owing to forgetfulness, was soundly swished. At the\r\nsame time he received a severe, though kindly lecture, in which the\r\n“Head” pointed out how such behaviour would pain his parents and the\r\nQueen, were it ever to reach her ears. Curiously enough, that very\r\nevening Dr. Hornby happened to be dining at Windsor, and as usual his\r\nRoyal hostess did not fail to make particular inquiry as to how her\r\nprotégé was getting on. What was the surprise of the young Prince\r\nduring the following morning to find himself once again summoned to the\r\n“library,” and as he wended his way to the grim scene of correction,\r\nhe wondered what he could have done to be whipped again so soon. All\r\nunpleasant anticipations were, however, quickly dispelled. In those\r\ngently modulated tones which so many old Etonians will remember, Dr.\r\nHornby described how, on the previous evening, a certain great lady had\r\nasked after her favourite Eton boy, and desired to be informed as to\r\nhow he had been getting on in the school. “I told you yesterday,” Dr.\r\nHornby went on to say, “that one lie always leads to another, and I am\r\nsorry to say in the present instance this adage has not failed to hold\r\ngood, for,” added he, “I am ashamed to say that, instead of telling Her\r\nMajesty of the disgraceful behaviour for which but a few hours before\r\nI had been obliged to punish you, I said that you were getting on very\r\nwell. Under these circumstances I feel sure that you will do all you\r\ncan to give no further trouble, and so, by causing my words to come\r\ntrue, make amends for the falsehoods which we have both of us uttered.”\r\nThe kindly admonition made a considerable impression upon the culprit’s\r\nmind. Nevertheless, he could not help being amused when the next\r\nSunday, in Chapel, he heard the Doctor take as his text, “All men are\r\nliars.”\r\n\r\nIn appearance Dr. Hornby was the absolutely perfect type of an Eton\r\nHeadmaster. Immaculately dressed, and of fine presence, he possessed a\r\nnatural dignity which even impressed boys totally lacking in reverence\r\nfor all other institutions of the school. His voice, low and not\r\nunpleasant even when delivering a stem admonition, was essentially the\r\nvoice of an English gentleman of the fine old school. It was a real\r\npleasure to hear him call “Absence,” owing to the dignity which he\r\nimparted to this tedious duty. Curiously enough, this Headmaster, who\r\nin his latter years, at least, might have been called the incarnation\r\nof the best kind of Eton Conservatism, had on his appointment been\r\nregarded as a Radical. The first Oppidan, I believe, ever chosen\r\nHeadmaster, he had succeeded Dr. Balston in 1868, when the latter had\r\nrelinquished the post from disapproval of the various innovations and\r\nchanges which resulted from the recommendations of the Public School\r\nCommission, the labours of which extended over seven years.\r\n\r\nThe growing worship of athleticism was in some measure responsible\r\nfor the appointment of the new Headmaster, though Dr. Hornby, besides\r\nhaving been in the eleven, was also a fine scholar. When he first came\r\nto Eton the school, used to the patriarchal sway of his predecessor,\r\nwho had strictly followed the traditions of the past, were rather\r\ninclined to regard him as a dangerous reformer, but before long it was\r\nrealised that such Radical proclivities as the new Headmaster possessed\r\nwere not very likely seriously to impair the traditional round of Eton\r\nlife, and the school gradually subsided into a tranquil consciousness\r\nthat nothing outrageous would be perpetrated under the new “Head,” who\r\nlong before his retirement grew to be far more Conservative than some\r\nof his subordinates; indeed, during his tenure of the Headmastership,\r\nwhich lasted sixteen years, four Assistant Masters are said to have\r\nleft Eton owing to Dr. Hornby disapproving of some of their ideas. One\r\nof these exiles was young Mr. Joynes, whose socialistic tendencies\r\nobviously unfitted him for the post of an Eton master; another, Mr.\r\nOscar Browning, whose clever and genial personality is so well known to\r\nnumbers of old Etonians.\r\n\r\n[SN: DR. BALSTON]\r\n\r\nDr. Balston remained at Eton as Vice-Provost, and I remember that\r\nwe regarded him with a good deal of sympathy as having preferred to\r\nresign rather than to yield to meddling on the part of the governing\r\nbody, then still looked upon as rather a new-fangled affair. During\r\nhis short term of office he had refused to sanction any alterations\r\nat all. Possessed of an unlimited respect for old traditions and\r\nways, his conception of a Headmaster was that he should exercise a\r\nsort of dignified and patriarchal sway, whilst carrying out a solemn\r\ntrust to maintain things as they had always been. Whilst Head he had\r\nborne himself with unbending dignity, being almost never seen out of\r\nacademic dress, in which, it was said, he even went to bed. The same\r\nstory, I believe, had been current in the days when Dr. Goodford,\r\nfamiliarly known as “Old Goody,” ruled the school. Some indeed declared\r\nthat a gown and cassock were all he wore. As Provost, however, the\r\nlatter was seen about Eton in ordinary costume and invariably carrying\r\nan umbrella. A quaint, queer figure this survivor of a past era looked\r\nwith his hat at the back of his head and hands covered with unbuttoned\r\nblack gloves much too big for him.\r\n\r\nAt that time the old Fellows who were still alive used to preach the\r\nmost lengthy and incomprehensible sermons in Chapel, but in that line\r\nDr. Goodford easily held his own against all. Owing to a peculiar\r\nintonation, his mouth always seemed to be full of pebbles, and it was\r\npractically impossible to make out one sentence of the vast number\r\nwhich trickled from his lips. Nevertheless we rather liked the good old\r\nman, whose curious sing-song induced sleep rather than irritation. Dr.\r\nGoodford’s entry into Chapel with the aged verger, who on account of\r\nthe silver wand he bore was called the “Holy Poker,” was a thing which\r\nmany Etonians will recall to mind.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Assistant Masters of some thirty years ago, about the\r\nmost conspicuous figure, owing to a long flowing beard, was the Rev.\r\nC. C. James, for some reason or other known as “Stiggins.” He enjoyed\r\nno great measure of popularity out of his house, where, it should be\r\nadded, he fed his boys better than almost any other tutor or dame. At\r\none period of his career he had narrowly escaped being thrown over\r\nBarnes Pool Bridge by a riotous party of boys, and though no one seemed\r\nto know the exact reason of this, with later generations it undoubtedly\r\nled to his being regarded with a certain rather unjust suspicion.\r\n\r\n[SN: “BADGER HALE”]\r\n\r\nA far more sympathetic figure was the Rev. E. Hale, known to the boys\r\nas “Badger Hale,” probably on account of his hair bearing some remote\r\nresemblance to the coat of that animal. Besides being a cleric, Mr.\r\nHale was an officer of the Eton Volunteers. He was of great girth, and\r\nwhen in uniform presented a really stupendous appearance, in which the\r\nboys took great delight. At that time the Volunteers were perhaps not\r\ntaken so seriously as is the present Officers’ Training Corps, with its\r\nmore workman-like appearance and ways. Though there were occasional\r\nfield-days, the principal evolution of the 2nd Bucks was to march,\r\nheaded by its band, to the playing-fields. Founded in 1860, by the late\r\n’seventies it had abandoned a good deal of its splendours, blue worsted\r\ncord having taken the place of the original silver lace, whilst the\r\ncolours presented by Mrs. Goodford had ceased to be carried, the Eton\r\nVolunteers being at that time a rifle corps. Now, however, that it has\r\nbecome the Officers’ Training Corps, they have once more been taken\r\ninto use. The silver bugle given by Lady Carrington is presumably still\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\n[SN: DR. WARRE]\r\n\r\nThe chief support of the Corps has always been its present Honorary\r\nColonel, the Rev. E. Warre, now Provost of Eton, who for many years\r\ntook a most active part in striving to maintain its well-being\r\nand efficiency. Few have done so much for Eton as he; his whole\r\nlife, indeed, has been devoted to furthering the best interests of\r\nthe school. As an Assistant Master he was the avowed champion of\r\nstrenuousness and efficiency, whilst opposed to old ways and traditions\r\ntending towards a slack state of affairs. A strong and dominating\r\npersonality, he was intensely popular with the boys in his own house,\r\nbut a good part of the school regarded him with a certain amount of\r\nsuspicion as entertaining revolutionary ideas, which it was said were\r\nonly kept in check by the firmness of Dr. Hornby, who in the last days\r\nof his Headmastership was looked upon as the staunch defender and\r\nchampion of old Eton ways. In the minds of ultra-conservative Etonians\r\nDr. Hornby stood for Conservatism, as Dr. Warre did for change. Such\r\nan estimate was not altogether without foundation, for after Dr.\r\nWarre had succeeded to the supreme control of the school, a number\r\nof alterations, some of them, no doubt, quite necessary, were made.\r\nThe general feeling amongst Eton boys at that time was Tory in the\r\nextreme, and though we knew scarcely anything about him except that he\r\nhad flogged a good deal, I am sure that a great many of us would have\r\nbeen delighted to hear that Dr. Keate, having returned to life, had\r\nbeen entrusted with the task of reorganising the school with a view to\r\ngetting it back into the condition of the good old days.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the reforms made by Dr. Warre during his Headmastership\r\nseem to have produced satisfactory results. Most of them dealt with\r\nalterations in the scholastic curriculum of the school, all the old\r\ncustoms open to criticism, such as “Oppidan Dinner,” having long\r\ndisappeared. Without doubt, under his rule the boys were made to work\r\nharder than before, whilst its tone gained in manliness and vigour. At\r\nthe same time the traditional spirit of Eton remained unimpaired, and\r\nbefore his retirement Dr. Warre, like his predecessors, had come to be\r\nconsidered a bulwark of Eton Conservatism.\r\n\r\nThe Headmastership of the school would appear to have a sobering\r\ntendency upon even the most advanced reformer, who at the end of\r\nhis term of office has generally lost his enthusiasm for innovation\r\nand change. The present Headmaster is a case in point. When he came\r\nto Eton a few years ago many were full of gloomy forebodings as to\r\nthe reforms he was about to make. Mr. Lyttelton was known to hold a\r\nnumber of advanced views--rumour indeed declared that he would try\r\nand force vegetarianism upon the boys and would make them wear Jaeger\r\nunderclothing, for which material he was declared to have a marked\r\npartiality. On assuming office, however, he somewhat allayed these\r\nfears by giving an address in which he announced that he was not\r\ngoing to stop tap, interfere with clothing, or abolish the beagles,\r\nto which he had been declared hostile. As a matter of fact, nothing\r\ncould have been more loyal than his behaviour in this latter respect,\r\nfor, far from discouraging the Eton Hunt, he has defended it against\r\nthe ridiculous attacks of various faddists and cranks. It is, however,\r\nto be regretted that an agitator was two years ago allowed to address\r\nthe school on the subject of unemployment from the Chapel steps in the\r\nschool-yard. The vast majority of the parents of Eton boys do not wish\r\ntheir sons to be taught Socialism, and the school-yard, so closely\r\nconnected with the old traditions of Eton, is the very last place where\r\nany theories of this kind should be permitted to be aired. As a matter\r\nof fact, the address, which under no circumstances could have done\r\ngood, merely provoked giggling. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that\r\nin permitting such an innovation the Headmaster was merely animated by\r\nthat new spirit of philanthropy and altruism which seems to have found\r\na more useful form of expression in the Eton Mission, now, according to\r\nall accounts, doing excellent work in Hackney Wick.\r\n\r\n[SN: INCREASE OF INTERFERENCE]\r\n\r\nAll things considered, Mr. Lyttelton has been a more successful\r\nHeadmaster than many old Etonians expected, and has not made any\r\nviolent effort to interfere with the traditions of the school. Life\r\nat Eton, however, without doubt is now more strenuous than of yore.\r\nLeave has been greatly curtailed, having to be taken at an appointed\r\ntime. Besides this, of late a tendency seems to have arisen to exercise\r\nmore control over the boys in minor matters, as to which in former days\r\nthe authorities never thought of interfering. From time immemorial it\r\nhas been the privilege of members of “Pop” to sit on the low wall by\r\nthe trees, planted in 1753, especially on Sunday; a recent regulation\r\nforbids any boy, whether belonging to “Pop” or not, from sitting on the\r\nwall on Sunday. The reason for such a vexatious interference with an\r\nold Eton custom is difficult to divine. A more reasonable exercise of\r\ninfluence by the Headmaster has been his attempt to get the boys when\r\nin Chapel to abstain from keeping their hands in their pockets when\r\nstanding up during the service. Such a practice is not forbidden, but\r\nan address on the subject by Mr. Lyttelton is said to have produced a\r\ngreat effect.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the masters of to-day would appear to possess more\r\ninfluence with the boys than was the case in the past. Now, as then,\r\nthe most popular are those who are gentlemen--that is, using the\r\nword in its best and proper sense. At the present time, owing to the\r\nincreased worship of athletics, proficiency at games is a powerful\r\nfactor in a master’s popularity, and genial eccentricity is also apt to\r\ncause him to be liked; but fads, on the other hand, are not attractive\r\nto boys, which makes it all the more remarkable that the present\r\nHeadmaster--a professed vegetarian--should have attained a fair measure\r\nof success in presiding over the school. No doubt his fine record as an\r\nathlete has had a good deal to do with this.\r\n\r\nIn the ’seventies of the last century the attitude of Eton boys towards\r\nthe “Beaks” (they are, I understand, called Ushers now), whilst not\r\nactively hostile, was for the most part one of tolerant indifference. A\r\nfew of the masters, however, were on fairly intimate terms with certain\r\nof the Upper boys, but the majority of the school knew and cared little\r\nabout those responsible for its education. Respect for constituted\r\nauthority has never been a salient characteristic of Eton boys, and\r\namongst the junior members of the school at least “drawing the beaks”\r\nwas then considered quite a legitimate form of amusement. A previous\r\ngeneration, according to all accounts, found a never-failing source\r\nof delight in lawless doings of this sort, whilst even Sixth Form\r\noccasionally took advantage of the good-nature of Dr. Hawtrey, the most\r\nurbane Headmaster, it is said, who ever wielded a birch.\r\n\r\nLike his subordinates, he seems to have been not infrequently exposed\r\nto attempts at “drawing” by his division. These, however, he generally\r\ntreated with good-humoured contempt. During one eleven-o’clock school\r\nthey once all became suddenly absorbed in the contemplation of the rose\r\nfrom which was suspended one of the chandeliers of Upper School, and,\r\nnudging one another, indulged in mysterious whispers, which eventually\r\ncaused Hawtrey to look up and ask, “Why, whatever is the matter?”\r\n“First of April, sir,” was the reply, but the Headmaster remained\r\nunmoved, and merely murmuring, “Silly boys,” bade one of them proceed\r\nwith their construing.\r\n\r\n[SN: “SOMEONE MUST BE LAST”]\r\n\r\nDr. Hawtrey did not believe in forcing learning upon boys, and was\r\nnever unduly severe with laggards. “Somebody must be last,” was a\r\nfavourite consolatory remark of his when any derisive titter at the\r\nlast name in an examination met his ears. During his tenure of the\r\nHeadmastership there was much ease and freedom, for it was not in his\r\nnature to be a martinet.\r\n\r\nFull of good intentions and over-politeness to the boys, it was no\r\nwonder that this pedagogue, a veritable prince amongst schoolmasters,\r\nwas very popular in the school. Whatever a boy said he professed, if\r\npossible, to believe, and although his confidence was often misplaced,\r\nthis course had a salutary effect in fostering and cultivating a\r\ngentlemanly spirit. At the same time his very figure was a caution to\r\nevildoers, for he had a droop in his right shoulder which was supposed\r\nto have come from a frequent and vigorous use of the birch. Among the\r\nLower boys he was generally called “Plug,” from some peculiarity in\r\nhis countenance, but the swells, by way of refinement, reversed the\r\nname and used “Gulp” instead. The same kind of satirical humour led\r\nto their ungallantly christening his two old sisters “Elephantina” and\r\n“Rhinocerina.” These ladies had a sedan-chair in which they went to\r\nparties--one of the last sedan-chairs probably used. Dr. Hawtrey had\r\na great liking for velvet collars, fine clothes, perfumes, and gold\r\nchains; one of the school beliefs was that “Hawtrey stood up in £700,”\r\nthe stiff figure at which his boys assessed his studs, sleeve-links,\r\nwatch and chains, gold pencil and rings.\r\n\r\nBoys are wonderfully astute judges of whether a master will stand\r\nnonsense or not, and having discovered that a man cannot keep order,\r\nare apt to bring the art of ingenious torment to a high pitch of\r\nperfection. Old Etonians will recall the self-control and good-temper\r\nshown by certain masters who had not the knack of making their\r\nauthority felt. Their divisions indulged in every kind of disorder,\r\nsuch as breaking out into applause at some casual comment, and at a\r\nprearranged moment commencing to stamp and sometimes even to sing.\r\nThe keyholes of their class-rooms were filled with small pebbles or\r\nindia-rubber, whilst various substances were put amongst the papers\r\nupon their desk. The writer well remembers the astonished look on the\r\nface of a certain master when, crawling laboriously towards him upon\r\nhis desk, there appeared a poor ink-soaked tortoise, which, to the\r\nintense delight of the division, had at last accomplished the feat\r\nof climbing out of the ink-pot, where it had surreptitiously been\r\ndeposited just as school commenced.\r\n\r\n[SN: “NASCITUR NON FIT”]\r\n\r\nAnother master, who was very short sighted, was always having jokes\r\nplayed upon him just under his nose. On one occasion it was declared\r\nhe had continued to dip his pen in the open mouth of a particularly\r\ntorpid toad, substituted for his inkpot, till the reptile, irritated\r\nand aroused, jumped right in the middle of his face. Yet other masters,\r\nwithout being particularly severe, kept order without any difficulty\r\nat all, the boys instinctively realising that they would stand no\r\nnonsense. Of the perfect schoolmaster, indeed, as of the perfect poet,\r\nit may be said, “Nascitur non fit.”\r\n\r\nTo those men who by nature and disposition were unable to make their\r\nauthority felt, school hours must have often been a time of veritable\r\ntorment. Generally well-meaning men of gentle nature, when they did\r\npunish they almost invariably punished wrong or in an ineffectual\r\nmanner, their usual practice being either to set some tremendous\r\n“poena,” which they afterwards revoked, or settle upon the wrong boy,\r\nto whom in the end they were obliged to accord something very like\r\nan apology. In a few rare instances the perfectly legitimate loss of\r\ntemper by a master led to very grave consequences. Goaded to fury by a\r\nlong course of deliberate insubordination, some tortured tutor would\r\nat last turn upon a pupil and box his ears. Physical chastisement\r\nby a master in any form whatever was then strictly forbidden, the\r\ninfliction of corporal punishment being reserved for the Head and Lower\r\nMasters alone. The boys were perfectly aware of this, and instances\r\noccurred of grave consequences attending a well-deserved blow. One\r\nmaster, I believe, was more or less compelled to leave the school\r\nbecause he had hit a particularly impertinent boy with a book, and\r\nseveral instances of masters receiving reprimands occurred from time\r\nto time. By the irony of fate, the most unsuccessful masters were\r\nsometimes the cleverest men, who, however, had begun badly and obtained\r\na reputation which caused them to be tortured by successive generations\r\nof boys. Of one of these unfortunate pedagogues it was said that\r\nduring school hours the first rank of his division talked, the second\r\nwhistled, and the third sang.\r\n\r\n[SN: AN UNFORTUNATE MASTER]\r\n\r\nOne of the most ludicrous jokes ever perpetrated upon any Eton master\r\nwas played some ten years ago. At that time several new masters, not\r\nall of whom were Etonians, had been appointed, more or less, I believe,\r\nupon probation. One of these, who taught modern languages, though a\r\nclever man, was of too confiding and gentle a disposition to cope with\r\nthe boys, and during school hours a scene of great disorder became\r\nthe almost invariable rule. Paper darts flew all over the class-room,\r\nand every kind of queer noise was heard, though the poor man was\r\nalways unable to bring the offenders to book. Finally, on the 5th of\r\nNovember a regular pandemonium prevailed, fireworks being exploded\r\nin all directions, even under his very nose, with the result that he\r\nwas driven into a state of rage merging upon despair and determined\r\nto adopt stringent measures. On the next occasion, however, when the\r\nsame set of boys came to take their lesson in the language of Molière,\r\nwhat was his surprise to observe that, contrary to all his former\r\nEton experiences, the greatest decorum prevailed, his remarks and\r\ncomments being listened to in respectful silence, whilst occasionally\r\nsubdued murmurs of admiration greeted the expounding of some difficult\r\nsentence. At the end of that school it had been his intention to\r\naddress a few words to the boys referring to the scandalous scene of\r\nthe previous week, but in face of their changed attitude he felt that\r\nit would be churlish to show any undue severity, and merely spoke in a\r\ntone of surprised regret, adding that he was much pleased to observe\r\nsuch improved behaviour. Upon this a boy, who on previous occasions had\r\nbeen one of the worst offenders, stepping forward, enquired, “Sir, may\r\nI say a few words?” Permission being accorded, the youth made a stately\r\nlittle speech, in which he said that any outbursts of indiscipline were\r\ndeeply deplored by the whole division, for whom he had been deputed\r\nto speak. “They were merely,” added he, “playful ebullitions--proofs,\r\nhe might add, of the great popularity of a master whom they all\r\nrespected and loved. The fact was, his friends had been carried away by\r\nenthusiasm, which in future would be kept within due bounds, and now\r\nhe hoped the whole incident might be forgiven and forgotten. Meanwhile\r\nhe had been requested to crave a favour, the granting of which he felt\r\nsure no one acquainted with Eton tradition would care to refuse. It\r\nwas,” he continued, “an ancient custom of the school, when a master\r\nattained to an unusual degree of popularity, for his division to be\r\nallowed the honour of hoisting him, and that honour he and his friends\r\nnow sought from their beloved pedagogue.” The master, though rather\r\nsurprised, felt very much flattered and pleased at having, as he said\r\nin a neat little speech of reply, so quickly gained the confidence and\r\nlove of his young friends, and at the end of school was carried round\r\nthe new schools, finally being deposited upon the cannon which all\r\nEtonians know so well. As his delighted boys went off to their houses\r\nthey gave him a final cheer, which filled him with joy. On his way home\r\nhe met one of the older masters and told him of the demonstration,\r\nadding, “Oh, I do so adore your quaint customs!” The astounded old\r\nEtonian held his peace, but at the end of that half the newcomer had to\r\nbetake himself elsewhere, it being clear that the Eton boys were too\r\nmuch for him.\r\n\r\n[SN: ESCAPADES]\r\n\r\nThe old lawless spirit which had prompted so many poaching expeditions\r\nand illicit rambles in the eighteenth century still lingered in the\r\nwriter’s day, when six or seven boys established a regular club, where\r\nthey could smoke and play nap, in a room over a Windsor toy-shop. One\r\nof the chief organisers--now a Peer who has filled several important\r\npublic appointments--always took care to provide a rope-ladder by\r\nwhich the party might escape in the event of a raid. Some of the\r\nWindsor billiard-rooms were also occasionally frequented by a few\r\nolder boys, some of whom had a regular arrangement which ensured them\r\nthe exclusive use of the table on certain days of the week. As far as\r\nthe present writer’s experience went, no serious harm resulted from\r\nthese sternly prohibited escapades. Nevertheless, afternoons passed\r\nin the consumption of much tobacco and some alcohol did no good to\r\nhealth. The authorities, whenever any rumour of such breaches of the\r\nschool discipline reached their ears, did everything in their power\r\nto set matters right. The wonder was, considering how alert were some\r\nof the masters, that more of the culprits were not caught. The writer\r\nremembers three--one of whom was his friend Mr. Douglas Ainslie, now\r\na well-known poet and critic--who had a very narrow escape indeed. On\r\nsuch afternoons as they indulged in surreptitious visits to a certain\r\nhostelry, these boys used to get into their house after Lock-Up through\r\nthe room of a small fag, who received careful instructions to look out\r\nfor their return behind the drawn blind of his window, by which access\r\ncould be contrived from the street. The signal agreed upon was a pebble\r\nthrown gently at the glass. For a time this arrangement worked well\r\nenough, but one winter’s evening the party, on reaching their house,\r\nwere dismayed at obtaining no response. One of them--in after life a\r\ngallant officer of Highlanders who fell fighting at the head of his men\r\nin South Africa--by climbing up and breaking a pane of glass, managed\r\nto effect an entrance; his companions followed, and what was their\r\nsurprise on relighting the light, which had fallen over in the scuffle,\r\nto find, cowering in the corner of the room, a beautiful little girl,\r\nwho was fairly frightened to death! When at last reassured, this\r\nchild explained that she was the sister of the owner of the room, who\r\nhad gone out to borrow some tea-things from a friend. Needless to\r\nsay, under such circumstances, the Lower boy got no hiding for his\r\ndelinquency.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his traditional duties, a master, it seems, now has\r\nto mark in the boys in his class-room. Formerly this was done by a\r\npraepostor, one being attached to every division. His office dated\r\nfrom the foundation of the school, when he appears to have possessed\r\nconsiderable authority, being indeed a sort of monitor. In modern\r\ntimes, however, praepostors merely had to mark in all the boys in\r\nthe division to which they were attached under three heads, “Leave,”\r\n“Staying out,” and “ab horâ” or “Late.” After every school all the\r\npraepostors assembled in the colonnade and handed in their bills to\r\nthe Headmaster. As a rule the office of praepostor, undertaken by\r\nevery boy in turn, was popular, for such an official escaped most of\r\nthe school hours, was never put on to construe, and passed a good deal\r\nof his time chatting to boys reported sick, whom he had to go and\r\nsee. Some boys disliked it, however, and by arrangement passed the\r\npraepostor’s book on. The whole institution was a curious survival\r\nof a past age. Well does the present writer remember standing as\r\npraepostor by the side of Dr. Hornby calling Absence in the school-yard\r\nand thinking that the ancient office would not last very much longer.\r\nWithin recent years his forebodings have been justified, for at present\r\nbut one praepostor (of the Headmaster’s division) exists, the work of\r\nmarking in being undertaken by masters in school and the boys at the\r\nend of the benches in Chapel.\r\n\r\n[SN: ROOMS]\r\n\r\nThirty or forty years ago life in an Eton house remained much as it\r\nhad been in the eighteenth century, the boys, provided they did their\r\nwork, being left pretty much to themselves, though some housemasters\r\ninterfered to prevent boisterous sports, such as football in the\r\npassages. The rooms, though often very small, were, it must be said,\r\nnot uncomfortable, and quite a number of boys prided themselves upon\r\ntheir taste in decoration. Some even had pianos in their rooms, a\r\nprivilege which was highly valued and seldom abused. The furniture of\r\nthe rooms generally varied but little. For the most part it consisted\r\nof a shut-up bed, a “burry” (bureau) washstand, which also closed\r\nup, and sock cupboard. In this the owner kept his tea-things and such\r\ndelicacies as he could afford. A favourite form of decoration was a\r\nmantel-board covered, according to Victorian taste, with stamped plush\r\nand brass-headed nails. In the summer term there was some competition\r\nin the matter of fire-ornaments and flower-boxes. The former were\r\ngenerally appalling in their vulgarity, their main feature being a\r\nprofusion of extremely garish ornament, mostly tinsel and sham gold.\r\nAlmost every boy had a few pictures, generally of a sporting kind,\r\neven though he himself had never taken part in sport. The Eton print\r\nshops must have done a fine trade in oleographs and poorly reproduced\r\nrepresentations of famous runs and steeplechases. Some few brought\r\ncomparatively good pictures with them from home. The writer remembers\r\na set of Eton prints in a boy’s room which at the present day it would\r\nbe extremely difficult to procure at all. The books were, of course,\r\nmostly connected with work, a crib or two being generally hidden away\r\nin case of a raid. On the whole an Eton boy was extremely comfortable,\r\nfor he could have pretty well anything he or his parents could afford\r\nto pay for, while there was scarcely one who did not boast an arm-chair.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the long-suffering boys’ maids, as they were called,\r\ndid their work very well. As a rule, it should be added, they were\r\nmiddle-aged women, not remarkable for beauty. One housemaster,\r\nindeed--Mr. Walter Durnford, formerly a popular figure at Eton, and now\r\nVice-Provost of King’s--according to current report, used, with perfect\r\njustice, to pride himself upon the extreme ugliness of his maids. Be\r\nthis as it may, the boys of his house, which was next to the writer’s,\r\nwere often to be seen peering through their windows in order to catch a\r\nglimpse of one of our maids, of whose good looks we were quite justly\r\nproud.\r\n\r\n[SN: FAGGING]\r\n\r\nFagging, though probably more arduous than to-day, entailed little\r\nhardships on the smaller boys. Thirty years ago a fag’s duties\r\nconsisted in laying his fagmaster’s breakfast, procuring chops, steaks,\r\nkidneys, or sausages from a sock shop, making toast, and poaching eggs.\r\nHe had to attend at tea-time again, but then as a rule was not called\r\nupon to do anything in particular, his appearance at that hour being\r\nmore or less a matter of form. Besides this, a fag had to carry notes\r\nand render other similar services when required to do so, while obliged\r\nto answer to the call of “Lower boy” shouted by any one in Upper\r\nDivision. It should be added that the qualification as to place in the\r\nschool entitling boys to fag has gradually been heightened. Formerly\r\nthe whole of the Fifth Form could fag; but about three decades ago that\r\nprivilege was withdrawn from the Lower Division, and I believe the\r\nnumber of fagmasters has been further lessened since then. This was not\r\non account of the privilege of fagging having been abused, but merely\r\nbecause the number of Upper boys had grown too large in proportion\r\nwith those of the Lower. With the institution of breakfasts provided\r\nby housemasters and eaten by the boys all together, fagging has shrunk\r\nto a mere nothing. The most irksome part formerly was being obliged to\r\nanswer the call of “Lower boy,” when every one “fagable” was obliged\r\nto rush at headlong speed to the caller, the last to arrive being the\r\none who had to perform the particular service required. In College, I\r\nbelieve, “Here” was called instead of “Lower boy.” Also, at one time,\r\nit would appear that any boy able to call out “Finge” before the rest\r\ncould claim exemption from taking notice of the call. I must, however,\r\nadd that I never heard anything about this when I was at Eton. Another\r\nCollege shout was “Cloister P!” on hearing which the lowest boy within\r\ncall had to fetch a canful of excellent drinking water from the famous\r\nold pump in the Cloisters, at the spout of which, in a rougher age,\r\nmany generations of Collegers had performed their ablutions. Owing\r\nto the dearth of Lower boys in College for a long time past, it has\r\nbeen the custom that every newcomer, irrespective of his place in the\r\nschool, should fag for a year.\r\n\r\nIn the distant past cricket fagging existed, and must have pressed\r\nvery heavily upon small boys, who were liable to be waylaid by Fifth\r\nForm boys coming out of school. Cricket fagging then included bowling,\r\nand was an irksome infliction which was just as well done away with.\r\nAnother disagreeable form of fagging which has now long been extinct\r\nwas crib fagging, which consisted in a small boy being obliged to read\r\nout a crib to an assemblage of big ones. As a rule, on these occasions\r\nanother fag would be posted in the passage outside in order to give\r\ntime for the crib to be secreted should there be any chance of the\r\ntutor making his unwelcome appearance. Towing boats up to Surly was the\r\nmost severe form of fagging. This was abolished by Keate some eighty\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n[SN: NO BULLYING]\r\n\r\nIt is much to the credit of the Eton system that amongst the Oppidans\r\n(the state of affairs in old Long Chamber was different) there seems\r\nnever to have existed any bullying. During the investigations of the\r\nCommission in 1861 all the evidence tended to show that small boys\r\nunderwent no ill-treatment or persecution whatever. In the writer’s\r\nopinion this in a great measure accounts for the independent and\r\nbuoyant spirit which has ever been a characteristic of Etonians in\r\nafter life. Many sensitive boys educated at schools where bullying\r\nhas prevailed have felt the results of it in a tamed and often broken\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n[SN: “ORDERS”]\r\n\r\nOne of the peculiarities of Eton in old days was that unless a boy\r\nsupplemented his dietary by the purchase of provisions from the shops\r\nin the town he would often have to go hungry, and even thirty years ago\r\nin most of the houses the old Eton traditions as regards feeding were\r\nin full force. All the boys received was a loaf, pat of butter, and\r\npot of tea for breakfast. Luncheon they all had together with their\r\ndame in the large dining-room; this was a fairly substantial meal. Tea\r\ntaken in their own rooms exactly resembled breakfast, besides which\r\nthere was a very light supper in the dining-room, at which attendance\r\nwas optional. Almost without exception, of course, this somewhat meagre\r\nfare was supplemented by the boys themselves, who purchased appetising\r\ndishes from the sock shops at a reasonable price. An Eton custom at\r\nthat day, which probably still exists, was for the boys to have what\r\nwere called “orders” at one of these shops. This “order” consisted in\r\nan agreement with a shopkeeper to supply a boy with provisions to a\r\ncertain amount every day, the boy’s father or mother having previously\r\npaid a sum in advance. The arrangement was, of course, intended to\r\nprevent the boy from finding himself bereft of all luxuries after the\r\npocket-money given him when he left home had been exhausted; but, as\r\na matter of fact, in the case of the more extravagant boys it almost\r\ninvariably missed its mark, for, getting round the shopkeeper, they\r\nwould persuade him to allow the anticipation of their “order,” with the\r\nresult that whilst during the first fortnight of the half they revelled\r\nin every sort of delicacy, their breakfasts and teas during the\r\nremainder of the school time were unenlivened by any toothsome dishes.\r\nThe most popular sock shops were then Harry Webber’s (now Rowland’s)\r\nand “little Brown’s,” the door of which the writer, on a recent visit\r\nto Eton, found shut.\r\n\r\nThe system of “orders” extended to other things besides sock shops,\r\na dame or housemaster having the power of giving them for clothes or\r\nany other necessary. A boy applying for one of these signed permits\r\nwas supposed to be able to prove that he was really in want of the\r\narticle he wished to procure, and, the order being handed to him, was\r\nrecognised by a tradesman as a valid voucher that the sum for which it\r\nstood would be included in the boy’s bill at the end of the half. On\r\nthe whole this arrangement worked well, but occasionally unscrupulous\r\nboys, by arrangement with some not over particular tradesman, would\r\nobtain some other article which was really anything but a necessary.\r\n\r\nDames were sometimes easy about granting “orders,” and not a few boys\r\nprided themselves upon their adroitness in obtaining anything they\r\nliked, and some of them managed to run up comparatively large accounts\r\nwith their housemaster’s or dame’s permission. An even more extravagant\r\nand reckless kind of boy would contrive to persuade some tradesman\r\n(generally a London one who knew something about the circumstances of\r\nhis parents) to allow him to run up bills without any “order” at all,\r\nthe understanding being that these should be paid when the boy had left\r\nschool or came of age. One such case the writer well remembers, the\r\nperpetrator being a very dissipated youth celebrated throughout the\r\nschool for always being in trouble with the authorities. This boy was\r\na great dandy as regards dress, and it was currently reported that\r\nhe never wore the same pair of trousers twice. This, of course, was\r\nan exaggeration, but he certainly had a wonderful stock of clothes.\r\nOn leaving Eton he had accumulated debts to a considerable figure,\r\nand his after career was anything but a success, for after attempting\r\nvarious forms of occupation, including amateur newspaper reporting, he\r\nwas last heard of keeping a little store in South Africa. An account\r\nof the curious professions adopted by Eton boys would fill a volume.\r\nOn the whole, however, the majority do well, as, after all, is only to\r\nbe expected, considering that in the first instance their parents must\r\nhave been possessed of considerable funds in order to send them to Eton\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n[SN: IMPISH MISCHIEF]\r\n\r\nSome tutors, unable to keep order in their houses, were the victims\r\nof all sorts of unpleasant jokes. One of the most mischievous and\r\ndangerous of these was to stretch a string across a passage and then\r\nset to work to create such a noise as would be sure to attract the\r\ntutor’s attention, with the result that when he arrived upon the scene\r\nhe would be tripped up. Another diversion of a somewhat similar sort\r\nwas to pile a number of iron coal-scuttles just at the top of a flight\r\nof stairs, and, after creating a great din, kick them down upon the\r\nascending tutor, who would seldom be able to discover the organiser\r\nof the outrage. A more amusing trick was the following. A small Lower\r\nboy, having, with his own consent, been tied up in one of the huge\r\ndirty linen bags, was placed in the middle of a passage and told to\r\nkeep perfectly motionless till he felt a slight kick, when he was to\r\nrise at his assailant and hold on to his legs, calling out the name\r\nof some big boy well known to all. This being done, all the occupants\r\nof the passage would set to work to make sufficient noise to produce\r\ntheir tutor’s appearance, upon which complete silence would prevail.\r\nNine times out of ten the tutor, walking down the passage to ascertain\r\nthe reason of the disturbance, seeing the dirty linen bag, would try\r\nand kick it on one side, with the result that, rising at him, it\r\nwould clutch him by the leg and cause him to execute a multitude of\r\nundignified gyrations, to the delight of boys peeping through doors\r\njust ajar. When, finally, the small boy had been extricated from the\r\nbag, it was very difficult to punish him, for he would invariably\r\nplead that he had been tied up against his will, and in pinching his\r\nassailant’s legs had been merely acting in self-defence against some\r\none whom he had good reason to suspect was a persecuting schoolfellow.\r\n\r\nThrowing bits of coal out of the window at passers-by or shooting with\r\na catapult used to be favourite pastimes with boys of a past age.\r\nFierce battles were sometimes waged in the winter evenings between\r\nthe boys in adjacent houses, when they would bombard each other with\r\npea-shooters or squirts charged with ink or water. Occasionally this\r\nwarfare involved onlookers in the street below. The writer remembers a\r\ngreat disturbance caused by an angry policeman whose helmet and uniform\r\nhad been liberally bespattered with ink.\r\n\r\nSome of the houses contained broad and lengthy passages, on each\r\nside of which were ranged boys’ rooms, a favourite amusement for the\r\noccupants of which was standing by the open doors and awaiting the cry\r\nof “Slough; change here for Staines, Windsor, Datchet,” when every boy\r\nwould slam his door in turn down the passage with a view to produce the\r\neffect of a train about to start. Immediately after the completion of\r\nthis manœuvre the boys would at once fly to their “burries” (bureaus),\r\nat which they would be found hard at work when the infuriated tutor or\r\nhousemaster arrived to discover the cause of the disturbance. In some\r\ncases the unfortunate man would ignore the first performance of this\r\ningenious form of torture, but a second and louder slamming seldom\r\nfailed to bring him in hot haste from his private quarters. To punish\r\nfor this kind of thing was exceedingly difficult, for the boys were, of\r\ncourse, at liberty to shut their doors, and collusion was not easy to\r\nprove.\r\n\r\nA number of boys spent their time experimenting with electricity and\r\nchemicals, and the writer well remembers a friend having his face\r\nseverely injured by the explosion of some dangerous compound mixed\r\ntogether in a flower-box. On another occasion the same boy (now a\r\nwell-known sporting peer) occasioned a serious panic. Having inserted\r\nsome detonating composition amongst the bricks of the railway arches\r\nover which trains run into Windsor, he contrived to make it explode\r\njust before the Royal train bearing Queen Victoria passed. It was a\r\ntime when Ireland was in a very disturbed state, and there was much\r\ndread of some outrage. Consequently the Windsor and Eton police were\r\nconvinced that the explosion had a political origin, and every effort\r\nwas made by means of detectives to find the perpetrator. It was,\r\nhowever, never discovered that he was an Eton boy.\r\n\r\n[SN: HOAXING THE PRESS]\r\n\r\nAbout thirty years ago, Eton boys were seized with a craze for hoaxing\r\nthe London Press, and some extraordinary letters appeared in various\r\npapers. The most extraordinary of all was one bearing the signature\r\nof an Eton master which described the writer’s remarkable experiences\r\nin the country, where he had witnessed a conflict between a cow and a\r\npartridge, in which the cow, after a prolonged chase, had eventually\r\ncaptured and devoured the bird. The master eventually wrote an\r\nindignant denial, but he was never able to discover who had taken his\r\nname in vain.\r\n\r\nThe greatest practical joke ever played at Eton was the colossal\r\nhoax perpetrated in the early eighties of the last century upon the\r\nsomewhat ingenuous editor of a newly-started London magazine, who had\r\nbeen struck with the idea of increasing its attractions by publishing\r\nauthentic news of public-school life. Not unnaturally he began with\r\nEton, and, setting to work to secure contributors at that school,\r\nobtained some really astounding information, which afterwards went to\r\nthe making of an extremely scarce little book called _Eton as She is\r\nnot_. More recently an amusing account of the whole affair appeared in\r\nthe _Cornhill Magazine_ at the end of an excellent article on “College\r\nat Eton.” At first the editor’s correspondents merely furnished him\r\nwith accounts of local events, all of them pure invention; but,\r\nemboldened by success, they soon went on to describe some interesting\r\nold customs. The first was chronicled thus:--\r\n\r\n  A curious custom takes place here on certain days in College Dining\r\n  Hall, called “Passing the Green Stuff.” The second fellow at the big\r\n  fellows’ table suddenly says, “Pass me that Green Stuff,” referring\r\n  to a dish of mint placed on the table; then the fellow opposite him\r\n  stands up, and says “Surgite” (arise), on which all the other fellows\r\n  get up from their places and run the fellow who “broached” (_i.e._\r\n  asked for) the green stuff round the School Paddocks, shouting out\r\n  such military commands as “Quick march! Right turn!” etc. They then\r\n  return to dinner, when a “grace-cup” is partaken by all except him\r\n  who “broached” the green stuff.\r\n\r\n[SN: “SLUNCHING” THE PADDOCKS]\r\n\r\nIn the next number readers were informed that at Eton Prisoner’s Base\r\nis a great success, and the Paddock is almost always deserted for the\r\nCloisters. The following then appeared:--\r\n\r\n  Another curious custom at Eton is “Slunching the Paddocks.” On a\r\n  certain day all the Collegians and Oppidans are provided with a\r\n  coarse sort of pudding, which is put to the following use. After\r\n  dinner is over they all go to Weston’s and School Paddocks and throw\r\n  their pudding all over them. This is “Slunching the Paddocks,” the\r\n  pudding being called “Slunch.” It is supposed to be derived from the\r\n  fact that when Queen Elizabeth visited Eton College “she lunched”\r\n  (s’lunched) in College Hall, and the students sprinkled the paddocks\r\n  with dry rice in her honour.\r\n\r\nIn the number published on March 5, 1884, a purely imaginary list of\r\nthe officials of the various school departments was given. There were\r\nthe Captains of the “Broach” and the “Slunch,” the two College boats;\r\nthe Captain of Cricket Tassels, R. J. Lucas;[12] Captain of Fives\r\nTassels, Havager Boroughdale; Captain of the Musical Department, R.\r\nA. S. Berry-Young; Captain of the Curling Club, T. T. Vator; Captain\r\nof the Spelican Team, Tute Goodhart; Captain of Ushers, J. Goodwin;\r\nSteward of the Paddocks, H. Beecham Wolley; Choragus, C. Wofflington.\r\nThis was followed in the next number by the news that the Spelican team\r\nhad played their first match of the season on March 11 against the\r\nDorney Dubes. The Collegian Brigade, an admirable corps, which marched\r\nout as far as Brocas Hedges, was later on described as having met\r\nwith a catastrophe, for “a bull loose in Weston’s Paddock, which they\r\npassed through on the way, attacked the line, and a boy named Swage was\r\nknocked over and slightly bruised.”\r\n\r\nThis went on for six months, when the Editor wrote and expressed\r\na desire to come down to Eton and see the place for himself. He\r\nwas duly shown a hockey match between B. Wolley’s “Field Mice” and\r\nFlenderbatch’s “Jolly Boys,” the match being played with tassels on the\r\ncaps and all, which so impressed him that he returned to London and\r\nwrote an account of what he had seen, giving at the same time a new and\r\noriginal version of the School Song, addressed to “Pulcra Etona” and\r\npraying among other things that:\r\n\r\n  Slunna fluat,\r\n  Semper ruat\r\n     Capti fundamentum.\r\n\r\n“Slunna” is slunch, “capti fundamentum” is sound Latin for prisoner’s\r\nbase. In high good temper he added that “our Eton correspondence is\r\nsupplied by a gentleman who is a universal favourite in College, and\r\nthe Editor is pleased to state that he has received letters from\r\nEtonians all over the world, signifying their approval of his reports.”\r\nHe was disillusioned soon after, and no more space was devoted to Eton\r\nand the strange doings of its students.\r\n\r\nThough at that time something of the old-world spirit still lingered,\r\nthere survived few of the quaint “characters” who had once been fairly\r\nnumerous at Eton. The ever-gentle, suave, and urbane Giles of Williams’\r\n(afterwards Ingalton Drake’s, and now Spottiswoode’s) will, however,\r\nbe remembered by many. How this good-natured man managed to book the\r\norders at the beginning of a school-time and keep his temper is a\r\nmystery which will never be solved. He had, I remember, a red-headed\r\nassistant, who, though a shade more inclined to frivolity than Giles\r\n(who was scholastic gravity itself), seemed to have been born to serve\r\nout broad rule and derivation paper without being ever in the least\r\nperturbed by the chatter of crowds of Lower boys.\r\n\r\n[SN: SOLOMON]\r\n\r\nAnother grave-looking character of this period was Solomon, who all\r\nday long stood in a minute room at the back of Brown’s, the hosier,\r\nironing hats. Solomon’s appearance and demeanour did not accord ill\r\nwith his appellation. He was a white-headed old man who always wore a\r\npaper cap somewhat resembling the traditional head-dress of a French\r\ncook. Standing in his shirt-sleeves gently working his iron over\r\nthe nap of ill-used “toppers,” his favourite topic was the Turf, of\r\nwhich surely no more ardent votary ever lived. All day long he would\r\ndiscuss with the various boys who streamed into his little workroom the\r\nchances of the horses entered for the next classic race. Solomon was\r\nessentially an old-fashioned turfite in his ideas, and knew nothing of\r\nstarting-price jobs or other new-fangled manœuvres. He was, however,\r\nacquainted with the form of all the more prominent race-horses, and in\r\nhis conversation laid gentle stress upon the value of a judgment which\r\nno one wished to dispute. In spite of the old man’s ardent affection\r\nfor racing, I cannot help thinking that during his long life he had\r\nseldom seen any races run. On this subject, however, it was best\r\nto hold one’s peace. Though Solomon’s sanctum was the scene of such\r\neternal confabulations as to the great question of first, second,\r\nand third, I cannot remember that much betting arose from it. As far\r\nas my memory serves me, the majority of Solomon’s visitors remained\r\npurely academic in their patronage of racing. Perhaps this was owing\r\nto the fact that the Lower boys, of whom his ever-changing audience\r\nwas for the most part composed, had very little money, and preferred\r\nto spend what they had in substantial dainties rather than risk it in\r\nspeculations of a visionary kind. I do not recollect Solomon doing any\r\nserious betting for boys, but have a vague idea he occasionally put\r\nshillings on. I was therefore surprised when told some years ago that\r\nthe old man had been driven out of his place owing to the action of the\r\nCollege authorities, who objected to him as demoralising the boys by\r\nassisting them to bet. I can only hope that this report was untrue, for\r\nin my day, at least, his influence was quite harmless.\r\n\r\n[SN: BETTING]\r\n\r\nIn the sixties, I believe, there used to be a school Derby lottery\r\nevery year, the winner of which generally got about £25. The\r\narrangements for this seem to have been placed in the hands of a\r\nwell-known character about the “wall” named “Snip,” but he had died or\r\ndisappeared long before my day, and the only lottery I remember was a\r\ntiny private affair, the tickets of which cost sixpence or a shilling.\r\nIn connection with this subject it is said that of late years betting\r\namongst the boys has become a serious evil. If this is the case, the\r\nschool must have undergone a considerable change in its ideas within\r\nthe last quarter of a century. In the late seventies and early eighties\r\nthere was practically no betting at all amongst the boys, chiefly for\r\nthe reason just given, but also because there existed a widespread\r\nidea that any attempt at speculation would eventually lead to loss of\r\nmoney. A good many boys, no doubt, who had a love for the Turf looked\r\nforward to gratifying a taste for speculation in time to come, whilst\r\nothers told extravagant tales of Turf triumphs during the holidays, but\r\nfew took racing seriously, their interest being limited to flocking to\r\nthe post-office to hear the first news as to the winner of any great\r\nrace. A salient proof that at that date no real betting existed was\r\nthe sensation caused amongst us by the rumour, based on truth, that\r\na new boy (the son of the Maharajah Duleep Singh, whose arrival at\r\nEton created some sensation), on being spoken to by a member of the\r\neight in the school-yard, had offered to bet him a fiver against a\r\ncertain horse, which wager had been accepted. This was the largest\r\nwager we ever heard of as being made at Eton, and it was looked upon as\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the High Street, opposite to the establishment\r\nwhere Solomon ironed hats and gave forth his wisdom, a younger rival\r\nalso doctored battered “toppers.” As far as I can remember, he was a\r\nfar rougher individual than the racing sage, and possessed a tendency\r\ntowards familiarity which was not universally popular. He and Solomon\r\nboth resembled each other in one respect, which was their taste for\r\nplastering every available inch of their walls with cuts and paragraphs\r\nfrom cheap papers of a comic order.\r\n\r\nA curious character amongst the sock shopkeepers of that period was an\r\nold Italian confectioner, who owned rather a spacious shop with very\r\nlittle in it up the High Street, on the right-hand side going from Eton\r\ntowards Windsor Bridge. This worthy, who was always attired in a cook’s\r\ndress--white cap, apron, and all--made and sold most excellent ices,\r\nwhich procured him a fair amount of custom from the Eton boys in spite\r\nof the fact that his shop was considered rather “scuggish.” According\r\nto common report, the proprietor had once been employed at Windsor\r\nCastle, where his skill as an ice-maker had won the favour of Queen\r\nVictoria, with whom for a time he had become a particular favourite.\r\nOne day, however, the Queen had caught him administering a thundering\r\nthrashing to his wife, in consequence of which she had very rightly at\r\nonce turned him out of his post. This story, though resting upon no\r\ncredible evidence, was generally believed by Lower boys, and some of\r\nthem made a practice of infuriating the old man by hurling taunts at\r\nhim as they were going out of his shop. “What a pity, ‘Cally,’ you got\r\nkicked out of the Queen’s kitchen!” they would call out, and the little\r\nItalian never failed to fly into a great rage at their chaff. Indeed,\r\non more than one occasion he was said to have pursued boys into the\r\nstreet with a knife in his hand, but this in all probability was mere\r\nexaggeration. Nevertheless he had a violent temper, and for this reason\r\nwas constantly being drawn by mischievous boys.\r\n\r\n[SN: A POPULAR INSTITUTION]\r\n\r\nA more improving occupation than chaffing tradesmen was reading\r\nbooks and papers at Ingalton Drake’s, the bookseller, who afterwards\r\ntook over Williams’, where all the school books were sold. This\r\nestablishment, owing to the good nature of the proprietor, was\r\nconstantly thronged with a crowd of boys, who, seldom making any\r\npurchase, spent a good deal of time turning over the leaves of new\r\nbooks just fresh from London. The _Times_ could also be read there.\r\nAs a matter of fact, the boys were very careful not to hurt or dirty\r\nthe books they took up or touched, and I do not think the owner of\r\nthe establishment had reason to regret his kindliness, which was the\r\nmeans of many Etonians acquiring an insight into branches of knowledge\r\nwhich the school curriculum made no attempt to include. Many a pleasant\r\nand not uninstructive half-hour was passed here by boys to whom\r\ncut-and-dried lessons made no appeal.\r\n\r\n[SN: HOISTING]\r\n\r\nThe Eton traditions of three decades ago were not very many in number,\r\nmost of them being concerned with minor points of dress, things which\r\nwere to be done and were not to be done, and the like. Except hoisting,\r\nfew old usages survived, though, no doubt, the opinions of many\r\nlong-past generations still influenced the boys in their unwritten code\r\nof what was “scuggish” and what was not. Hoisting, I believe, still\r\nsurvives, though a very few years ago undue exuberance on the part of\r\nthe boys nearly caused its abolition. At that time (1904-1905) the\r\nwhole school would assemble along the wall on the evening of the School\r\nPulling, which always takes place after Lord’s, and await the arrival\r\nof the members of “Pop,” who from Tap would walk arm-in-arm across the\r\nwhole street to opposite their Club Room in the building of the old\r\nChristopher. They would then seize the winners of the School Pulling,\r\nand, according to traditional custom, run up and down along the wall\r\nwith them, the whole school shouting at the top of their voices. If the\r\neleven had won at Lord’s, or the eight at Henley, its members were also\r\nhoisted one by one. In the case of the School Pulling, the winners,\r\nafter being hoisted, were taken to some prominent upper window in one\r\nof the houses which all could see, and water solemnly poured over their\r\nheads, the jugs and crockery being eventually thrown out into the\r\nstreet. This latter generally occurred just before Lock-up, all the\r\nboys being still out in the street. The end was that “Pop” canes were\r\nproduced, arms linked, and everybody systematically driven into his\r\ntutor’s house. The ceremony of hoisting was not very popular with the\r\npublic, for, in consequence of the noise, passing carts and carriages\r\ngenerally went by a good deal quicker than the drivers wished, and\r\nhorses became alarmed, whilst no bicyclist was allowed to remain on\r\nhis bicycle, every one who passed being booed or cheered. Thirty years\r\nago the ceremony proceeded much in the same way, though there was more\r\nconsideration shown to the drivers of horses which looked likely to\r\nbecome alarmed by noise; also the crockery-smashing ceremonial did\r\nnot exist, and would have been resented had any attempt been made to\r\ninstitute it.\r\n\r\nLike another custom of modern origin, “Lock-up Parade,” this very\r\nundesirable addition to hoisting has now been forbidden. Lock-up\r\nParade, which did not exist in the writer’s Eton days, took place in\r\nthe Summer Half, just before the hour of Lock-up, when the boys walked\r\nbackwards and forwards within very narrow limits to the strains of\r\nmusicians stationed outside “Tap.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Eton College from the River. _From an old coloured\r\nprint._]\r\n\r\nTap is, if possible, more flourishing than ever, being, as of old,\r\ncrowded on summer evenings. At such a time whilst the wet bobs on their\r\nway home from the Brocas fill it to overflowing, a number of swagger\r\ndry bobs also put in an appearance. In addition to the traditional\r\nrefreshments procurable at Tap, chops, steaks, bread and cheese, beer\r\nand cider, coffee, chocolate, cakes, fruit, and other good things of\r\nthe same kind may now be got there, with the result that it is also\r\nmuch frequented after twelve, though, of course, not by Lower boys,\r\nwho are still excluded as of old. A modern Eton fashion is the giving\r\nof a breakfast under a tent in the garden of Tap during the summer\r\nterm. This is a very “swagger” affair, most of “Pop” putting in an\r\nappearance. A few years ago, when some of the members of the Eton\r\nSociety were more than usually vivacious in disposition, the return\r\nfrom Tap in the evening just before Lock-up was occasionally very\r\nnoisy, top-hats flying about in all directions, and passers-by finding\r\nit difficult to proceed on their way without being playfully held up.\r\nAt present, however, the summer evenings are once again peaceful as of\r\nyore--a happy state of affairs which should delight every true lover\r\nof Eton, for it is beneath the rays of a setting sun that the tranquil\r\ncharm of the old red-brick walls and weather-beaten buildings makes\r\nitself especially felt. [SN: SWINBURNE’S LINES] At this time of year\r\nis it, more than any other, that the crowning glory of the place--the\r\nplaying fields fringed by the silver winding Thames--present such a\r\nsuperb scene of placid beauty, whilst College close by whispers from\r\nits towers “the last enchantment of the Middle Age.” No wonder that, in\r\nspite of altered ways and habits, the spirit fostered by such stately\r\nsurroundings still remains alive--\r\n\r\n  Still the reaches of the river, still the light on field and hill,\r\n  Still the memories held aloft as lamps for hope’s young fire to fill,\r\n  Shine, and while the light of England lives shall shine for\r\n    England still.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that these lines, written by the last great Etonian\r\npoet to celebrate the 450th anniversary of the foundation, will be as\r\napplicable to the school five hundred years hence as they are to-day.\r\nMay those yet to come continue to bear the torch of Eton, handed down\r\nfrom distant generations, bravely aloft, whilst never ceasing to keep\r\nbefore their eyes the duty of delivering it to their successors, its\r\nflame bright and brilliant as of old.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[12] Captain of the eleven 1883-1884, Unionist member for Portsmouth\r\n1900-1906.
