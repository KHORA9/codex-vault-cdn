Footnotes have been\r\nmoved to the end of the chapter. Letters that are preceeded by a caret\r\n(^) are superscripted in the text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was invited to reprint in book-form the articles which had\r\nappeared in the _Genealogical Magazine_ under the titles of\r\n\"Shakespeare's Family\" and the \"Warwickshire Ardens,\" I carefully\r\ncorrected them, and expanded them where expansion could be made\r\ninteresting. Thus to the bald entries of Shakespeare's birth and burial\r\nI added a short life. Perhaps never before has anyone attempted to write\r\na life of the poet with so little allusion to his plays and poems. My\r\nreason is clear; it is only the genealogical details of certain\r\nWarwickshire families of which I now treat, and it is only as an\r\ninteresting Warwickshire gentleman that the poet is here included.\r\n\r\nMuch of the chaotic nonsense that has of late years been written to\r\ndisparage his character and contest his claims to our reverence and\r\nrespect are based on the assumption that he was a man of low origin and\r\nof mean occupation. I deny any relevance to arguments based on such an\r\nassumption, for genius is restricted to no class, and we have a Burns as\r\nwell as a Chaucer, a Keats as well as a Gower, yet I am glad that the\r\nresult of my studies tends to prove that it is but an unfounded\r\nassumption. By the Spear-side his family was at least respectable, and\r\nby the Spindle-side his pedigree can be traced straight back to Guy of\r\nWarwick and the good King Alfred. There is something in fallen fortune\r\nthat lends a subtler romance to the consciousness of a noble ancestry,\r\nand we may be sure this played no small part in the making of the poet.\r\n\r\nAll that bear his name gain a certain interest through him, and\r\ntherefore I have collected every notice I can find of the Shakespeares,\r\nthough we are all aware none can be his descendants, and that the family\r\nof his sister can alone now enter into the poet's pedigree with any\r\ndegree of certainty.\r\n\r\nThe time for romancing has gone by, and nothing more can be done\r\nconcerning the poet's life except through careful study and through\r\npatient research. All students must regret that their labours have such\r\ncomparatively meagre results. Though sharing in this regret, I have been\r\nable, besides adding minor details, to find at last a definite link of\r\nassociation between the Park Hall and the Wilmcote Ardens; and I have\r\nlocated a John Shakespeare in St. Clement's Danes, Strand, London, who\r\nis probably the poet's cousin. I have also somewhat cleared the ground\r\nby checking errors, such as those made by Halliwell-Phillipps,\r\nconcerning John Shakespeare, of Ingon, and Gilbert Shakespeare,\r\nHaberdasher, of London (see page 226). I hope that every contribution to\r\nour store of real knowledge may bring forward new suggestions and\r\nadditional facts.\r\n\r\nIn regard to his mother's family, I thought it important to clear the\r\nearlier connections. But it must not be forgotten that until modern\r\ntimes no Shakespeare but himself was connected with the Ardens. Yet,\r\nhaving commenced with the family, I may be pardoned for adding to their\r\nhistory before the sixteenth century the few notes I have gleaned\r\nconcerning the later branches.\r\n\r\nThe order I have preferred has been chronological, limited by the\r\nadvisability of completing the notices of a family in special\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nDisputed questions I have placed in chapters apart, as they would bulk\r\ntoo largely in a short biography to be proportionate. Hence the Coat of\r\nArms and the Arden Connections are treated as family matters, apart from\r\nJohn Shakespeare's special biography. I have done what I could to avoid\r\nmistakes, and neither time nor trouble has been spared. I owe thanks to\r\nmany who have helped me in my long-continued and careful researches, to\r\nthe officials of the British Museum and the Public Record Office, to the\r\nTown Council of Stratford-on-Avon and Mr. Savage, Secretary of the\r\nShakespeare Trust, to the Worshipful Company of the Haberdashers, for\r\nallowing me to study their records; to the late Earl of Warwick, for\r\nadmission to his Shakespeare Library, and to many clergymen who have\r\npermitted me to search their registers.\r\n\r\n                    CHARLOTTE CARMICHAEL STOPES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n                       PART I\r\n\r\nCHAPTER                                                 PAGE\r\n\r\n   I.

Writers in _Notes and Queries_ have formed it from Sigisbert,\r\nor from Jacques Pierre,[1] or from \"Haste-vibrans.\" Whatever it was at\r\nits initiation, it may safely be held to have been an intentionally\r\nsignificant appellation in later years. That it referred to feats of\r\narms may be argued from analogy. Italian heraldry[2] illustrates a name\r\nwith an exactly similar meaning and use in the Italian language, that of\r\nCrollalanza.\r\n\r\nEnglish authors use it as an example of their theories. Verstegan\r\nsays[3]: \"Breakspear, Shakespeare, and the like, have bin surnames\r\nimposed upon the first bearers of them for valour and feates of armes;\"\r\nand Camden[4] also notes: \"Some are named from that they carried, as\r\nPalmer ... Long-sword, Broadspear, and in some respects Shakespear.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"The Polydoron\"[5] it is stated that \"Names were first questionlesse\r\ngiven for distinction, facultie, consanguinity, desert, quality ... as\r\nArmestrong, Shakespeare, of high quality.\"\r\n\r\nThat it was so understood by his contemporaries we may learn from\r\nSpenser's allusion, evidently intended for him, seeing no other poet of\r\nhis time had an \"heroic name\"[6]:\r\n\r\n    \"And there, though last, not least is Aëtión;\r\n    A gentler shepherd[7] may nowhere be found,\r\n    Whose Muse, full of high thought's invention,\r\n    Doth like himself heroically sound.\"\r\n\r\nIf the parts of the name be significant, I take it that the correct\r\nspelling at any period is that of the contemporary spelling of the\r\nparts. Therefore, when spear was spelt \"spere,\" the cognomen should be\r\nspelt \"Shakespere\"; when spear was spelt \"speare,\" as it was in the\r\nsixteenth century, the name should be spelt \"Shakespeare.\" Other methods\r\nof spelling depended upon the taste or education of the writers, during\r\ntransition periods, when they seemed actually to _prefer_ varieties, as\r\none sometimes finds a proper name spelt in three different ways by the\r\nsame writer on the same page. \"Shakespeare\" was the contemporary form of\r\nthe name that the author himself passed in correcting the proofs of the\r\n\"first heirs of his invention\" in 1593 and 1594; and \"Shakespeare\" was\r\nthe Court spelling of the period, as may be seen by the first official\r\nrecord of the name. When Mary, Countess of Southampton, made out the\r\naccounts of the Treasurer of the Chamber after the death of her second\r\nhusband, Sir Thomas Heneage, in 1594, she wrote: \"To William Kempe,\r\nWilliam Shakespeare,[8] and Richard Burbage,\" etc.\r\n\r\nI know that Dr. Furnivall[9] wrote anathemas against those who dared to\r\nspell the name thus, while the poet wrote it otherwise. But a man's\r\nspelling of his own name counted very little then. He might have held\r\nromantically to the quainter spelling of the olden time as many others\r\ndid, such as \"Duddeley,\" \"Crumwell,\" \"Elmer.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Notes and Queries_, 2nd Series, ix. 459, x. 15, 86, 122; 7th\r\nSeries, iv. 66; 8th Series, vii. 295; 5th Series, ii. 2.\r\n\r\n[2] See Works of Goffredo di Crollalanza, Segretario-Archivista dell'\r\nAccademia Araldica Italiana, which were brought to my notice by Dr.\r\nRichard Garnett.\r\n\r\n[3] Verstegan's \"Restitution of Decayed Intelligence,\" ed. 1605, p. 254.\r\n\r\n[4] Camden's \"Remains,\" ed. 1605, p. 111.\r\n\r\n[5] Undated, but contemporary. _Notes and Queries_, 3rd Series, i. 266.\r\n\r\n[6] Spenser's \"Colin Clout's Come Home Again,\" 1595.\r\n\r\n[7] It was a fashion of the day to call all poets \"shepherds.\"\r\n\r\n[8] \"Declared Accounts of the Treasurer of the Chamber,\" Pipe Office,\r\n542 (1594).

Furnivall, in the _Journal\r\nof the Society of Archivists and Autograph Collectors_, No. I., June,\r\n1895.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE LOCALITIES OF EARLY SHAKESPEARES\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find the name occurs in widely scattered localities from very early\r\ntimes. Perhaps a resembling name ought to be noted \"in the hamlet of\r\nPruslbury, Gloucestershire,[10] where there were four tenants. This was\r\nat one time an escheat of the King, who gave it to his valet, Simon\r\n_Shakespeye_, who afterwards gave it to Constantia de Legh, who gave it\r\nto William Solar, the defendant.\" If this represents a 1260\r\n\"Shakespere,\" as there is every reason to believe it does, this is the\r\nearliest record of the name yet found. This belief is strengthened by\r\nthe discovery that a _Simon Sakesper_ was in the service of the Crown in\r\n1278, as herderer of the Forest of Essex,[11] in the Hundred of\r\nWauthorn, 7 Edward I. Between these two dates Mr. J. W. Rylands[12] has\r\nfound a Geoffrey Shakespeare on the jury in the Hundred of Brixton, co.\r\nSurrey, in 1268.[13]\r\n\r\nThe next[14] I have noted occurs in Kent in the thirteenth century,\r\nwhere a John Shakespeare appears in a judicial case, 1278-79, at\r\nFreyndon.\r\n\r\nThe fifth notice is in the north.[15] The Hospital of St. Nicholas,\r\nCarlisle, had from its foundation been endowed with a thrave of corn\r\nfrom every ploughland in Cumberland. These were withheld by the\r\nlandowners in the reign of Edward III., for some reason, and an inquiry\r\nwas instituted in 1357. The jury decided that the corn was due. It had\r\nbeen withheld for eight years by various persons, among whom was \"Henry\r\nShakespere, of the Parish of Kirkland,\" east of Penrith. This gives,\r\ntherefore, really an entry of this Shakespere's existence at that place\r\nas early as 1349, and an examination of Court Records may prove an\r\nearlier settlement of the family.\r\n\r\nThere was a transfer of lands in Penrith described as \"next the land of\r\nAllan Shakespeare,\" and amongst the witnesses was William\r\nShakespeare,[16] April, 21 Richard II., 1398.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Records of the Borough of Nottingham,\"[17] we find a John\r\nShakespere plaintiff against Richard de Cotgrave, spicer, for deceit in\r\nsale of dye-wood on November 8, 31 Edward III. (1357); Richard, the\r\nservant of Robert le Spondon, plaintiff against John Shakespere for\r\nassault. John proves himself in the right, and receives damages, October\r\n21, 1360.\r\n\r\nThe first appearance yet found of the name in Warwickshire is in 1359,\r\nwhen Thomas Sheppey and Henry Dilcock, Bailiffs of Coventry, account for\r\nthe property of Thomas Shakespere,[18] felon, who had left his goods and\r\nfled.\r\n\r\nHalliwell-Phillipps[19] notes as his earliest entry of the name a Thomas\r\nShakespere, of Youghal, 49 Edward III. (1375). A writer in _Notes and\r\nQueries_[20] gives a date two years later when \"Thomas Shakespere and\r\nRichard Portingale\" were appointed Comptrollers of the Customs in\r\nYoughal, 51 Edward III. (1377). This would imply that he was a highly\r\ntrustworthy man. Yet, by some turn of fortune's wheel, he may have been\r\nthe same man as the felon.\r\n\r\nIn Controlment Rolls, 2 Richard II. (June, 1377, to June, 1379), there\r\nis an entry of \"Walter Shakespere, formerly in gaol in Colchester\r\nCastle.\"[21] John Shakespeare was imprisoned in Colchester gaol as a\r\nperturbator of the King's peace, March 3rd, 4 Richard II., 1381.[22] At\r\nPontefract, Robert Schaksper, Couper, and Emma his wife are mentioned as\r\npaying poll-tax, 2 Rich. II.[23]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Norris,[24] working from original documents, notes that on\r\nNovember 24 (13 Richard II.), 1389, Adam Shakespere, who is described as\r\nson and heir of Adam of Oldediche, held lands within the manor of\r\nBaddesley Clinton by military service, and probably had only just then\r\nobtained them. Oldediche, or Woldich, now commonly called Old Ditch\r\nLane, lies within the parish of Temple Balsall, not far from the manor\r\nof Baddesley.\r\n\r\nThis closes the notices of the family that I have collected during the\r\nfourteenth century. The above-noted Adam Shakespere, the younger, died\r\nin 1414, leaving a widow, Alice, and a son and heir, John, then under\r\nage, who held lands until 20 Henry VI., 1441. It is not clear who\r\nsucceeded him, but probably two brothers, Ralph and Richard, who held\r\nlands in Baddesley, called Great Chedwyns, adjoining Wroxall. Mr. Norris\r\nsays that no further mention of the name appears in Baddesley, but one\r\nnotice of the property is given later. Ralph and Joanna, his wife, had\r\ntwo daughters--Elizabeth, married to Robert Huddespit, and Isolda,\r\nmarried to Robert Kakley. Elizabeth Huddespit, a widow, in 1506 held the\r\nlands which Adam Shakespeare held in 1389.\r\n\r\nThe family of Shakespeare appears in the \"Register of the Guild of\r\nKnowle,\"[1] a semi-religious society to which the best in the county\r\nbelonged:\r\n\r\n    1457.

Thomæ Schakspere, p aiaei.\r\n          Thomas Shakspere et Alicia uxor ejus de\r\n            Balsale.\r\n\r\nMr. Yeatman has studied the Court Rolls of this period. It is to be\r\nwished he had published his book in two volumes, one of facts and one of\r\nopinions. He says that the earliest record of the Court Rolls of\r\nWroxall[26] is one dated 5 Henry V. (1418). It is a grant by one\r\nElizabeth Shakspere to John Lone and William Prins of a messuage with\r\nthree crofts. (The same Rolls tell us that in 22 Henry VIII. Alice Love\r\nsurrendered to William Shakespeare and Agnes his wife a property\r\napparently the same.)\r\n\r\nIn 1485 John Hill, John Shakespeare and others, were enfeoffed in land\r\ncalled \"Harveys\" in Rowington, and John appears as witness in 1492 and\r\n1496.[27]\r\n\r\nThere were Shakesperes at Coventry and Meriden in the fifteenth century.\r\nJohn Dwale, merchant of Coventry, left legacies by will to Annes Lane\r\nand to Richard Shakespere, March 15, 1499.[28]\r\n\r\nAmong the \"foreign fines\" of the borough of Nottingham,[29] Robert\r\nShakespeyr paid eightpence for license to buy and sell in the borough in\r\n1414-15. The same Robert complains of John Fawkenor for non-payment of\r\nthe price of wood for making arrows. And French[30] tells us there was a\r\nThomas Shakespere, a man at arms, going to Ireland on August 27, 18\r\nEdward IV., 1479, with Lord Grey against the king's enemies.\r\n\r\nJohn Shakespere, a chapman in Doncaster,[31] paid on each order 12d.\r\nAmong the York wills, John Shakespere of Doncaster mentions his wife,\r\nJoan, 1458. In the same year Sir Thomas Chaworth leaves Margery\r\nShakesper six marks for her marriage.[32]\r\n\r\nIn 1448, William Shakspere, labourer, and Agnes, his wife, were legatees\r\nunder the will of Alice Langham, of Snailswell, Suffolk.[33]\r\n\r\nA family also belonged to London. Mr. Gollancz told me of a certain\r\n\"William Schakesper\" who was \"to be buried within the Hospital of St.\r\nJohn of Jerusalem, in England,\" in 1413.[34] On reference to the\r\noriginal, I found there was no allusion to profession, locality or\r\nfamily.

But it is only the first half of\r\nthe century that concerns us at present. There have been Shakespeares\r\nnoted in Warwick, Alcester, Berkswell, Snitterfield, Lapworth, Haseley,\r\nAscote, Rowington, Packwood, Beausal, Temple Grafton, Salford, Tamworth,\r\nBarston, Tachbrook, Haselor, Rugby, Budbrook, Wroxall, Norton-Lindsey,\r\nWolverton, Hampton-in-Arden, Hampton Lucy, and Knowle.[37]\r\n\r\nMost students, recognising Warwickshire as the ancestral home of the\r\npoet's family, exclude the town of Warwick from the field of their\r\nconsideration, and select the Shakespeares of Wroxall, partly because\r\nmore is known about them, and partly because what is known of them\r\nsuggests a higher social status than is granted the other branches. From\r\nthe \"Guild of Knowle Records\" we learn that in 1504 the fraternity was\r\nasked to \"pray for the soul of Isabella Shakespeare, formerly Prioress\r\nof Wroxall,\"[38] that the name of Alice Shakespere was entered, and\r\nprayers requested for the soul of Thomas Shakespere, of Ballishalle, in\r\n1511; and in the same year Christopher Shakespere and Isabella, his\r\nwife, of Packwood, Meriden, are mentioned. The name of \"Domina Jane\r\nShakspere\" appears late in 1526. She is often spoken of as another\r\nPrioress. Now, it is important to notice that Dugdale mentions neither\r\nof these ladies. He records that D. Isabella Asteley was appointed July\r\n30, 1431, and that D. Jocosa Brome, daughter of John Brome,[39]\r\nsucceeded her. She resigned in 1524, and died on June 21, 1528.\r\n\r\nAgnes Little was confirmed Prioress November 20, 1525, and at the\r\ndissolution of the house a pension of £7 10s. was granted her for life.\r\nThe rest of her fellow nuns were exposed to the wide world to seek their\r\nfortunes. Now Dugdale, with all his perfections, occasionally makes\r\nmistakes. He either mistook Asteley for Shakespeare, or another\r\nShakespeare prioress intervened between the two that he mentions. The\r\n\"Guild of Knowle Records\" give unimpeachable testimony as to the\r\nexistence and date of the Prioress, Isabella Shakespeare. In the edition\r\nof Dugdale's \"Warwickshire\" by Dr. W. Thomas, 1730, and the edition of\r\nhis \"Monasticon,\" published 1823, there is mentioned in a note that a\r\nlicense for electing to the office was granted Johanna Shakespere,\r\nSub-Prioress, September 5, 1525. So she might have had the empty title\r\nof Domina, without the usual pension allowed to the Prioress on\r\ndissolution.[40]\r\n\r\nAfter the name of Domina Johanna Shakspere in the Knowle Records occur\r\nthose of Richard Shakspere and Alice, his wife; William Shakespere and\r\nAgnes his wife; Johannes Shakespere and Johanna his wife, 1526; Richard\r\nWoodham and Agnes his wife, who was the sister of Richard. This Richard\r\nShakespere was probably the Bailiff[41] of the Priory, who shortly\r\nbefore the Dissolution collected the rents and held lands from the\r\nPriory. He, however, was replaced in his office by John Hall, who\r\nreceived a patent for it on January 4, 26 Henry VIII. Among the tenants\r\nof the dissolved Priory were mentioned[42] \"Richard Shakespeare,\"\r\n\"William Shakespeare,\" and \"land in the tenure of John Shakespeare,\r\ndemised to Alice Taylor, of Hanwell, in the county of Oxford.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Yeatman[43] transcribes a grant of land in Wroxall by the Prioress\r\nIsabella Shakespere to John Shakespere and Elene, his wife, in 23 Henry\r\nVII. (Richard Shakespere on the jury).[44] But there seems to be some\r\nerror in the date, as the \"Guild of Knowle Records\" distinctly state\r\nthat Isabella the Prioress was either dead in 19 Henry VII. or had\r\nretired from office.\r\n\r\nElena Cockes, widow, late wife of John Shakespere, and Antony, her son,\r\nappear about this land in a court held by Agnes Little, Prioress of\r\nWroxhall, April 21, 25 Henry VIII. William Shakespeare and Agnes were\r\nconcerned in it, Alice Lone, and many other connected names. A Richard\r\nShakespere was on the jury, and a Richard Shakespere was appointed\r\nAle-taster. The Subsidy Rolls do not give a John resident in Wroxall at\r\nany date, but in 14, 15, and 16 Henry VIII. John, senior, and John,\r\njunior, were resident in the adjoining village of Rowington, and in 34\r\nand 37 Henry VIII. there was one John Shakespeare there. In 16 Henry\r\nVIII.[45] there was a Richard Shakespere in Hampton Corley. The name\r\nalso occurs at Wroxall in that year and in Rowington in 34-5 Henry VIII.\r\nThere were also a Thomas and a Lawrence (mentioned as a cousin in a will\r\nof a John Shakespere, 1574), at Rowington at that time, and the name of\r\nWilliam appears repeatedly in Wroxall. A Robert Shakespere was presented\r\nfor non-suit. Rev. Joseph Hunter[46] gives a rental of Rowington 2\r\nEdward VI. Among the free tenants of Lowston End was John Shakespere; at\r\nMowsley End, Johanna Shakespere, a widow, who seems to have died 1557,\r\nas her will, though lost, is mentioned in the index at Worcester; a\r\nWilliam Shakespere and a Richard Shakespere are also mentioned. In 3\r\nElizabeth Thomas Shakespere held a messuage in Lowston. In Rowington End\r\nJohn Shakespere held a cottage called \"The Twycroft,\" and Richard\r\nShakespere a messuage in Church End at the same time. In the reign of\r\nEdward VI. a Richard Shakespere was on the jury for Hatton, a Court in\r\nthe Manor of Wroxall. The Wroxall Parish Registers begin too late to be\r\nof any use (1586). The Wroxall Court Rolls mention in 1523, Richard of\r\nHaseley; 1530-36, Richard and William; 1547, Ralph of Barston.\r\n\r\nRalph[47] Shakespere was on the jury for Berkswell November 11, 4 Edward\r\nVI. and 5 Edward VI. In 1560 Laurence was presented, because he\r\noverburdened the commons with his cattle. John is mentioned in a\r\ntransfer of property. Mr. J. W. Ryland gives us invaluable help in his\r\npublication of \"The Records of Rowington.\" John Shakespeer and Robert\r\nFulwood, gent., are mentioned as feoffees in the will of John Hill of\r\nRowington, September 23, 1502. John Shakespeare elder and younger are\r\nfrequently mentioned in the Charters of Rowington as feoffees or as\r\nwitnesses, and a John had a lease of the Harveys for twenty-one years in\r\n1554. A Joan Shakespeare, widow, and her son Thomas, lived at Lyannce in\r\nHatton in 1547. In the Rental of Rowington, 1560-1, there are mentioned\r\nThomas, William, John and Richard. Mr. Hunter mentions a Richard\r\nShakespeyre, at Mansfield, co. Notts, about 1509; a Peter, in 1545; and\r\na John at Derby, 36 Henry VIII. A Richard Shakespere was assessed at\r\nHampton Carlew 16 Henry VIII.; Richard Woodham and Richard Shakspere had\r\na farm at Haseley. The Haseley Registers begin in 1538, and are\r\ninteresting for the fact that they record on October 21, 1571, the death\r\nand burial of \"Domina Jane,\" formerly a nun of Wroxall, who would seem\r\nto have been the last sub-prioress, probably connected with Richard\r\nShakespere, the Bailiff. In 1558 a Roger Shakespere was buried--by some\r\nsupposed to be the old monk of Bordesley[48]--who received 100s.\r\nannuity.\r\n\r\nThe earliest Shakespeare will at Worcester, proved at _Stratford_, was\r\nthat of Thomas Shakespere, of Alcester, 1539, who left 20s. each to his\r\nfather and mother, Richard and Margaret. He had a wife Margaret and a\r\nson William.[49] Among other Worcester wills is that of Thomas\r\nShakespere of Warwick, shoemaker, May 20, 1557, who left his wife Agnes\r\nlands in Balsall for life; his daughter Jone, wife to Francis Ley, £4;\r\nto his sons Thomas and John 4 nobles each; and his son William was to be\r\nhis heir. Richard Shakysspere of Rowington, weaver, June 15, 1560, left\r\nhis property to his sons Richard and William. His brothers-in law John\r\nand William Reve were executors and Richard Shakespeare was a witness.\r\nIn 1561 this William Reve in his will left a sheep to Margaret\r\nShakspere, and in 1565 Robert Shakespeere of Rowington made his will.\r\n\r\nBut among all these Shakesperes we cannot certainly fix upon any one\r\nthat is directly connected with our Shakespeare. It seems _almost_\r\ncertain that John Shakespeare was son of Richard Shakespeare, of\r\nSnitterfield. And yet many doubt it on grounds worthy of consideration,\r\nwhich are treated later in the notice of John Shakespeare. Mr. Yeatman\r\nfound that an Alice Griffin, daughter of Edward, and sister of Francis\r\nGriffin of Braybrook, married a Shakespeare. He takes it for granted\r\nthat she married Richard of Wroxall, and that it was he who came to\r\nSnitterfield. We must beware of drawing definite conclusions, of making\r\nover-hasty generalizations. We only collect the bricks to help future\r\ninvestigators to build the edifice.\r\n\r\nThe Sir Thomas Schakespeir, Curate, of Essex, Bristol and London, who\r\ndied 1559, is treated later among the Essex Shakespeares.\r\n\r\nThere is one curious mention of the name which no student seems to have\r\nworked out. A certain Hugh Saunders, _alias Shakespere_,[50] of Merton\r\nCollege, Oxford, became Principal of St. Albans Hall in 1501. He was\r\nVicar of Meopham, in Kent, Rector of Mixbury, Canon of St. Paul's, and\r\nPrebendary of Ealdstreet, in 1508; and Rector of St. Mary's,\r\nWhitechapel, in 1512. He died 1537. Now, such an alias was common at the\r\ntime, when a man's mother was of higher social station than his father.\r\nWe may therefore, seeing he was somehow connected with Shakespeare,\r\nimagine Hugh Saunders' mother to have been a Shakespeare. He is styled\r\n\"vir literis et virtute percelebris.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36] \"George Shaksper complains against Agnes Marshall that she detains\r\ntwo rosaries,\" June 18, 1533.--\"Common Trained Soldiers in Nottingham,\"\r\nPeter Shakespear, etc., 1596-97.

Into the contest over\r\nthat application it is well to plunge at once, and thence work backwards\r\nand forwards. Four classes of writers wage war over the facts: the\r\nBaconians, like the late Mr. Donnelly, who deny everything; the\r\nRomanticists, who accept what is pleasant, and occasionally believe\r\nmanufactured tradition to suit their inclinations; the agnostic\r\nShakespeareans, like Halliwell-Phillipps, who really work, but believe\r\nonly what they can see and touch, if it accords with their opinions; and\r\nthe ingenuous workers who seek saving truth like the agnostics, but\r\nbring human influences and natural inferences to bear on dusty records.\r\nNow, Halliwell-Phillipps does not scruple to affirm that three\r\nheralds,[51] the worthy ex-bailiff of Stratford, and the noblest poet\r\nthe world has ever produced, were practically liars in this matter,\r\nbecause they make statements that do not harmonize with the limits of\r\nhis knowledge and the colour of his opinions. From his grave the poet\r\nprotests--\r\n\r\n    \"Good name in man or woman, dear my lord,\r\n    Is the immediate jewel of their souls.\r\n    Who steals my purse steals trash....\r\n    But he who filches from me my good name\r\n    Robs me of that, which not enriches him,\r\n    But leaves me poor indeed.\"\r\n\r\n    _Othello_, Act III., Scene 3.\r\n\r\nWe must therefore at least start inquiry with the supposition that these\r\nmen thought they spoke truth. There was no reason they should not have\r\ndone so. Sir John Ferne[52] writes: \"If any person be advanced into an\r\noffice or dignity of publique administration, be it eyther\r\nEcclesiasticall, Martiall or Civill ... the Herealde must not refuse to\r\ndevise to such a publique person, upon his instant request, and\r\nwillingness to bear the same without reproche, a Coate of Armes, and\r\nthenceforth to matriculate him with his intermarriages and issues\r\ndescending in the Register of the gentle and noble.... In the Civil or\r\nPolitical State divers Offices of dignitie and worship doe merite Coates\r\nof Armes to the possessours of the same offices, as ... Bailiffs of\r\nCities and ancient Boroughs or incorporated townes.\" John Shakespeare\r\nhad certainly been Bailiff of Stratford-on-Avon in 1568-9; the draft\r\nstates that he then applied for arms, and that the herald, Cooke, had\r\nsent him a \"pattern.\" Probably he did not conclude the negotiations\r\nthen, thinking the fees too heavy, or he might have delayed until he\r\nfound his opportunity lost, or he might have asked them for his year of\r\noffice alone. No doubt John Shakespeare was deeply impressed with the\r\ndignity of his wife's relatives, and wished, even then, to make himself\r\nand his family more worthy for her sake. The tradition of this draft, or\r\nthe sight of it, may have stimulated the heart of the good son to honour\r\nhis parents by having them enrolled among the _Armigeri_ of the county.\r\nJohn had appeared among the \"gentlemen\" of Warwickshire in a government\r\nlist of 1580.[53]\r\n\r\nThe Warwickshire Visitations occur in 1619, after the death of the poet,\r\nwithout male heirs, and are no help to us here. In the first 1596 draft\r\nthe claims are based on John's public office, on a grant to his\r\nantecessors by Henry VII. for special services on marriage with the\r\ndaughter and heir of a gentleman of worship (_i.e._, entitled to\r\narmorial bearings). Then a fuller draft was drawn out, also in 1596,\r\ncorrecting \"antecessors\" into \"grandfather.\" Halliwell-Phillipps only\r\nmentions one at that date, but Mr. Stephen Tucker,[54] Somerset Herald,\r\ngives facsimiles of both. Halliwell-Phillipps calls these ridiculous\r\nassertions, and asserts that both parties were descended from obscure\r\ncountry yeomen. The heralds state they were \"solicited,\" and \"on\r\ncredible report\" informed of the facts. We must not forget that all the\r\nfriends intimately associated either with the Ardens or the Shakespeares\r\n(with the exception of the Harts) were armigeri.\r\n\r\nNobody now knows anything of that earlier pattern, nor of the patents of\r\nthe gifts \"to the antecessors.\" But seeing, as I have seen, that sacks\r\nfull of old parchment deeds and bonds, reaching back to the fifteenth\r\ncentury, get cleared out of lawyers' offices, and sold for small sums to\r\nmake drumheads or book-bindings, and seeing that this process has been\r\ngoing on for 400 years, it does not seem to me surprising that some\r\ndeeds do get lost. Generally, it is those we most wish to have that\r\ndisappear. Lawyers do not, as a rule, concern themselves with historical\r\nfragments, but with the soundness of the present titles of their clients\r\nand their own modern duties. (I do think that historical and antiquarian\r\nsocieties should bestir themselves to have old deeds included among the\r\n\"ancient monuments of the country\" and entitled to some degree of\r\nprotection.)\r\n\r\nWe must also consider how illiterate the inhabitants of the country were\r\nin the reign of Henry VII., how the nation was bestrid by officials of\r\nthe Empson and Dudley type, and we have reason to believe that various\r\naccidents, intentional or otherwise, caused many an old grant to\r\ndisappear at that period.\r\n\r\nIt has struck me as possible that John Shakespeare may have intended\r\nancestors through the female line. The names of his mother and\r\ngrandmother are as yet unknown, and the supposition has never been\r\ndiscussed. But in support of John Shakespeare's claim, and in opposition\r\nto Halliwell-Phillipps's contradiction, we can prove there _were_\r\nShakespeares in direct service of the Crown, not merely as common\r\nsoldiers, though in 28 Henry VIII. (1537), Thomas, Richard, William and\r\nanother Richard were mentioned as among the King's forces.[55]\r\n\r\nBut one Roger Shakespeare was Yeoman of the Chamber to the King, and on\r\nJune 9, 1552, shared with his fellows, Abraham Longwel and Thomas Best,\r\na forfeit of £36 10s.[56] This post of Yeoman of the Chamber was one of\r\ngreat trust and dignity; it was the same as that held earlier by Robert\r\nArden, of Yoxall, the younger brother of Sir John Arden, and the\r\nelection to it suggested either inherited favour, Court interest, or\r\nsignal personal services. His ancestors might have been also the missing\r\nancestors of John Shakespeare. He himself may be the Roger who was\r\nburied in Haseley in 1558, supposed by some to have been the monk of\r\nBordesley. He may also have been the father of Thomas Shakespeare, the\r\nRoyal Messenger of 1575, noticed later.\r\n\r\nThis record proves nothing beyond the inexactitude of\r\nHalliwell-Phillipps's sweeping statements, but it gives us a hope that\r\nsomething else may somewhere else be found to fit into it and make a\r\nfact complete. One of the facts brought forward as a reason for the\r\ngrant of arms to John Shakespeare was \"that he hath maryed Mary daughter\r\nand one of the heires of Robert Arden in the same countie, Esquire.\"\r\n\"Gent\" was originally written, and was altered to \"Esquire.\"[57]\r\n\r\nSome have doubted that the grant ever really took place, but Gwillim, in\r\nhis \"Display of Heraldrie,\" 1660, notes, \"Or, on a bend Sable, a tilting\r\nSpear of the field, borne by the name of Shakespeare, granted by William\r\nDethick, Garter, to William Shakespear the renowned poet.\" Shakespeare's\r\ncrest, or cognizance, was a \"Falcon, his wings displayed, Argent,\r\nstanding on a wreath of his colours, supporting a speare, gold.\" His\r\nmotto was, \"Non Sans Droict.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said there were objections made to this pattern on the ground that\r\nit was too like the old Lord Mauley's.[58] Probably they were only notes\r\nof a discussion among the heralds, when it was decided that the spear\r\nmade a \"patible difference,\" and a résumé of the qualifications was\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nThis was answered on May 10, 1602, before Henry Lord Howard, Sir Robert\r\nSidney, and Sir Edward Dier, Chancellor of the Order of the Garter: \"The\r\nanswere of Garter and Clarencieux Kings of arms, to a libellous scrowle\r\nagainst certen arms supposed to be wrongfully given. Right Honorable,\r\nthe exceptions taken in the Scrowle of Arms exhibited, doo concerne\r\nthese armes granted, or the persons to whom they have been granted. In\r\nboth, right honourable, we hope to satisfy your Lordships.\" (They\r\nmention twenty-three cases.) \"Shakespere.--It may as well be said that\r\nHareley, who beareth gould, a bend between two cotizes sables, and all\r\nother that (bear) or and argent a bend sables, usurpe the coat of the\r\nLo.

Some writers consider that, following a custom of\r\nthe day, John Shakespeare treated as _his_ antecessors his wife's\r\nancestors. The word \"_great-grandfather_\" tends to exclude this notion,\r\nas may be seen later, but the word \"grandfather\" would imply, if this\r\nhad been intended, that Thomas Arden himself had had the grants. It has\r\nalways been supposed that Brooke, York Herald, had exhibited some\r\ncomplaint against this grant also, as he very possibly did.[60] He was\r\nseverely critical of the heraldic and genealogic matter in Camden's\r\n\"Britannia,\" and very bitter at the slighting way the author speaks of\r\nheralds. He wrote a book called \"The Discoveries of Certaine Errours in\r\nthe edition of 1594,\" which he seems to have begun at once, as on page\r\n14 he states, \"If the making of gentlemen heretofore hath been greatly\r\nmisliked by her Majestie in the Kinges of Armes; much more displeasing,\r\nI think, it will be to her, that you, _being no Officer of Armes_,\r\nshould erect, make and put down Earles and Barons at your pleasure.\" It\r\nmust have been peculiarly galling to him that by the influence of Sir\r\nFulke Greville, afterwards Lord Brooke, Camden was advanced over his\r\nhead to the dignity he himself desired. After being appointed, for\r\nform's sake, Richmond Herald for one day, Camden was made Clarenceux,\r\nOctober 23, 1597, between the first and second Shakespeare drafts. This\r\nprobably decided Brooke to publish his \"Pamphlet of Errors,\" which, as\r\nhe dedicated it to the Earl of Essex, \"Lord General of the Royal Forces\r\nin Ireland,\" must have appeared in 1599. He wrote another book against\r\nCamden, which was forbidden to be published.\r\n\r\nThe draft for the impalement is also heavily corrected, probably in\r\ncomparison and discussion. Of the Shakespeare shield a note adds: \"The\r\nperson to _whom it was granted_ hath borne magistracy in\r\nStratford-on-Avon, was Justice of the Peace, married the daughter and\r\nheir of Arderne, and was able to maintain that estate.\" The Heralds\r\nfirst tricked the arms of the Ardens of Park Hall, Ermine a fesse chequy\r\nor and az., but scratched them out, and substituted a shield bearing\r\nthree cross crosslets fitchée and a chief or, with a martlet for\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nI put forward several suggestions concerning this question in an article\r\nin the _Athenæum_.[61]\r\n\r\nThe critical strictures against the Shakespeare-Arden claim are best\r\nsummed up by Mr. Nichols:[62]\r\n\r\n1. That the relation of Mary Arden to the Ardens of Park Hall was\r\nimaginary and impossible, and those who assert it in error. 2. That the\r\nArdens were connected with nobility, while Robert Arden was a mere\r\n\"husbandman.\" 3. That the Heralds knew the claim was unfounded when they\r\nscratched out the arms of Arden of Park Hall, and replaced them by the\r\narms of the Ardens of Alvanley, of Cheshire. This was equally\r\nunjustifiable, but as the family lived further off, there was less\r\nlikelihood of complaint.\r\n\r\nNow we must work out the case step by step on the other side.\r\n\r\nRobert Arden, of Park Hall, spent his substance during the Wars of the\r\nRoses, and was finally brought to the block (30 Henry VI.,[63] 1452).\r\nHis son Walter was restored by Edward IV., but he would probably be\r\nencumbered by debts and \"waste\"; at least, he had but small portions to\r\nleave to his family when he made his will[64] (31 July, 17 Henry VII.,\r\n1502). Besides his heir, Sir John, Esquire of the Body to Henry VII., he\r\nhad a second son,[65] Thomas, to whom he leaves _ten_ marks annually; a\r\nthird son, Martin, who was to have the manor of Natford; if not, then\r\nMartin and his other sons--Robert, Henry, William--should each of them\r\nhave _five_ marks annually. This is an income too small even for younger\r\nsons to live on in those days, so it is to be supposed the father had\r\nalready either placed them, married them well, or otherwise provided for\r\nthem during his life. Among the witnesses to the will are \"Thomas Arden\r\nand John Charnells, Squires.\" Thomas, being the second son, might have\r\nhad something from his mother Eleanor, daughter and coheir of John\r\nHampden, of Great Hampden, county Bucks. This Thomas was alive in 1526,\r\nbecause Sir John Arden then willed that his brothers--Thomas, Martin,\r\nand Robert--should have their fees for life. Henry, and probably also\r\nWilliam, had meanwhile died, though a William seems to have been\r\nestablished at Hawnes, in Bedfordshire. Seeing that Sir John was the\r\nEsquire of the Body to Henry VII., it seems very probable that his\r\nbrother Robert was the Robert Arden, Yeoman of the Chamber, to whom\r\nHenry VII. granted three patents: First, on February 22, 17 Henry VII.,\r\nas Keeper of the Park at Altcar,[66] Lancashire; and second, as Bailiff\r\nof Codmore, Derby,[67] and Keeper of the Royal Park there; the third[68]\r\ngave him Yoxall for life, at a rental of £42--afterwards confirmed.\r\nIndeed, Leland in his \"Itinerary\" mentions the relationship,[69] and the\r\nadministration of Robert's goods proves it.\r\n\r\nMartin's family became connected with the Easts and the Gibbons, and his\r\nname and arms appear in the \"Visitations of Oxfordshire.\" Where\r\nmeanwhile was Thomas? There is no record of any Thomas Arden in\r\nWarwickshire or elsewhere, ever supposed to be the son of Walter Arden,\r\nsave the Thomas who, the year before Walter Arden's death, was living at\r\nWilmecote, in the parish of Aston Cantlowe, on soil formerly owned by\r\nthe Beauchamps. On May 16, 16 Henry VII., Mayowe transferred certain\r\nlands at Snitterfield to \"Robert Throckmorton, Armiger, Thomas Trussell\r\nof Billesley, Roger Reynolds of Henley-in-Arden, William Wood of\r\nWoodhouse, Thomas Arden of Wilmecote, and Robert Arden, the son of this\r\nThomas Arden.\" This list is worth noting. Thomas Trussell, of an old\r\nfamily, is identified by his residence.[70] He was Sheriff of the county\r\nin 23 Henry VII. No Throckmorton could take precedence of him save the\r\nRobert Throckmorton of Coughton, who was knighted six months later.[71]\r\n\r\nThese men were evidently acting as trustees for the young Robert Arden.\r\nJust in the same way this same Robert Throckmorton was appointed by\r\nThomas's elder brother, Sir John Arden of Park Hall, as trustee for his\r\nchildren, in association with John Kingsmel, Sergeant-at-Law, Sir\r\nRichard Empson, and Sir Richard Knightley.[72] That a man of the same\r\nname, at the same time, in the same county, retaining the same family\r\nfriends, in circumstances in every way suitable to the second son of\r\nWalter Arden, should be accepted for that man seems just and natural,\r\nespecially _when no other claimant has ever been brought forward_.\r\n\r\nBut we _know_ this Thomas Arden was Mary Arden's grandfather; this\r\nRobert was her father; this property, that tenanted afterwards by the\r\nShakespeares, and left by Robert's will to his family.\r\n\r\nAs the deed of conveyance of the premises at Snitterfield from Mayowe to\r\nArden has been often referred to, occasionally quoted, but never, so far\r\nas I know, printed _in extenso_, I should like to preserve the copy. It\r\nmay save trouble to future investigators, and help to clear up the\r\nconnection between the Shakespeares and the Ardens. It certainly\r\nstrengthens very much Mary Arden's claim to connection with the Ardens\r\nof Park Hall, and her descent from \"a gentleman of worship,\" a claim the\r\nheralds allowed.\r\n\r\n\"Sciant presentes et futuri quod ego Johannes Mayowe de Snytterfeld\r\ndedi, concessi, et hac presenti carta mea confirmavi, Roberto\r\nThrokmerton Armigero, Thome Trussell de Billesley, Rogero Reynoldes de\r\nHenley in Arden, Willelmo Wodde de Wodhouse, Thome Arderne de Wylmecote,\r\net Roberto Arderne filio eiusdem Thome Arderne, unum mesuagium cum suis\r\npertinenciis in Snytterfeld predicta, una cum omnibus et singulis terris\r\ntoftis, croftis, pratis, pascuis et pasturis eidem mesuagio spectantibus\r\nsive pertinentibus in villa et in campis de Snytterfeld predicta cum\r\nomnibus suis pertinenciis; quod quidem mesuagium predictum quondam fuit\r\nWillelmi Mayowe et postea Johannis Mayowe et situatum est inter terram\r\nJohannis Palmer ex parte una et quandam venellam ibidem vocatam\r\nMerellane ex parte altera in latitudine et extendit se in longitudine a\r\nvia Regia ibidem usque ad quendam Rivulum, secundum metas et divisas\r\nibidem factas.

And in the\r\nexamination of John Somerville,[74] Edward Arden's son-in-law (also of\r\nhigh descent), he stated \"that he had received no visitors of late, but\r\ncertain 'husbandmen,' near neighbours.\" The Arden \"husbandman\" of\r\nWilmecote in 1523 and 1546[75] paid the same amount to the subsidy as\r\nthe Arden Esquire of Yoxall[76] in 1590, when money was of less value.\r\n\r\nMr. Nichols' third assertion, that the heralds scratched out the arms of\r\nthe Ardens of Park Hall, because they _dared_ not quarter them with\r\nthose of the Shakespeares, shows that he omitted certain considerations.\r\nThat family was under attainder then.\r\n\r\nDrummond[77] exemplifies many arms of Arden, and traces them back to\r\ntheir derivation. He notices that the \"elder branch of the Ardens took\r\nthe arms of the old Earls of Warwick; the younger branches took the arms\r\nof the Beauchamps, with a difference. In this they followed the custom\r\nof the Earls of Warwick.\" The Ardens of Park Hall therefore bore ermine,\r\na fesse chequy, or, and az., arms derived from the old Earls of Warwick;\r\nand this was the pattern scratched out in John Shakespeare's quartering.\r\nBut the reason lay in no breach of connection, but in the fact that Mary\r\nArden was an heiress, not in the eldest line, but through a _second\r\nson_. A possible pattern for a younger son was three cross crosslets\r\nfitchée and a chief or. As such they were borne by the Ardens of\r\nAlvanley, with a crescent for difference. They were borne without the\r\ncrescent by Simon Arden of Longcroft,[78] the second son of the next\r\ngeneration, and full cousin of Mary Arden's father. It is true that\r\namong the tombs at Yoxall the fesse chequy appeared, but there is\r\nevident confusion in their use. Martin Arden of Euston was probably in\r\nthe wrong to assume when he did the arms of his elder brother; William\r\nArden of Hawnes, if the sixth son, county Bedford, bore the same arms as\r\nthose proposed for Mary Arden, and it is implied that Thomas, her\r\nfather, had borne them. In the Heralds' College is the draft:\r\n\"Shakespere impaled with the Aunceyent armes of the said Arden of\r\nWillingcote\" (volume marked R. 21 outside and G. XIII. inside).\r\n\r\nIf the three cross crosslets fitchée were the correct arms for Thomas\r\nArden as the second son of an Arden, who might bear ermine, a fesse\r\nchequy or, and az., the crescent would have been the correct difference,\r\nbut it had long been borne by the Ardens of Alvanley, in Cheshire, who\r\nbranched off from the Warwickshire family early in the thirteenth\r\ncentury. The heralds therefore differenced the crosslets with a martlet,\r\nusually, but by no means universally, the mark of cadency for a fourth\r\nson at that time.[79] Thus, Glover[80] enumerates among the arms of\r\nWarwickshire and Bedfordshire: \"Arden or Arderne gu., three cross\r\ncrosslets fitchée or; on a chief of the second a martlet of the first.\r\nCrest, a plume of feathers charged with a martlet or.\" If heraldry has\r\nanything, therefore, to say to this dispute, it is to support the claim\r\nof Thomas Arden to being a cadet of the Park Hall family, and thereby to\r\ninclude Mary Arden and her son in the descent from Ailwin, Guy of\r\nWarwick, and the Saxon King Athelstan. Camden and the other heralds were\r\nonly seeking correctness in their draft of the restitution of the\r\nArdens' arms. The hesitation as to exactitude among the varieties of\r\nArden arms was the cause of the notes. See \"The Booke of Differ.,\" 61;\r\nsee \"Knights of E.I.,\" folios 2, 28, etc., on the draft.\r\n\r\nIt has been considered strange that, after the application and even\r\nafter the grant (preserved in MS. \"Coll. of Arms,\" R. 21), no use\r\nthereof can be proved, though the heralds added to the former grant:\r\n\"and we have lykewise uppon an other escucheon impaled the same with the\r\nauncient arms of the said Arden of Wellyngcote, signifying thereby that\r\nit maye and shalbe lawfull, for the said John Shakespeare, gent., to\r\nbeare and use the same shields of arms, single or impaled, as aforesaid,\r\nduring his natural lyfe, and that it shalbe lawful for his children,\r\nissue, and posterity, to beare, use, quarter, and shewe the same with\r\ntheir dewe difference, in all lawfull warlyke faites and civill use\"\r\n(_Ibid._, G. XIII.).\r\n\r\nJohn Shakespeare did not live long after his application, dying in 1601.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the grant of the impaled Arden arms was completed before\r\nhis death, there is no record of his using them. Whether his son ever\r\nused the impalement we do not now know, but it does not appear on any of\r\nthe tombs or seals that have been preserved. But the Shakespeare arms\r\nhave been certainly used.\r\n\r\nWilliam Shakespeare was mercilessly satirized by his rivals, Ben Jonson\r\nand others,[81] about his coat of arms; but it was the recognition of\r\nhis descent that secured him so universally the attribute of \"gentle.\"\r\nAs Davies, addressing Shakespeare and Burbage in 1603, says:\r\n\r\n    \"And though the stage doth stain pure gentle blood,\r\n    Yet generous ye are in mind and mood.\"[82]\r\n\r\nWe must not forget there would be possible ill-feeling among the\r\nfamilies of the Arden sisters, when the youngest, whom they had probably\r\nalways pitied and looked down on, because of her comparatively\r\nunfortunate marriage, should have the audacity to think of using the\r\narms of their father, to which they had never aspired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD HOUSE AT WILMECOTE, BY SOME SUPPOSED TO BE ROBERT\r\nARDEN'S.\r\n\r\n_To face p. 35._]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[60] He tried in every way to prove Camden wrong, but his bitterness\r\nonly hurt himself.

I do not think she was a\r\nThrockmorton, but I think she was very probably a Trussell, which Mr.\r\nFrench also suggests. Joane was a Trussell name, and Billesley held some\r\nattraction to the family. We are not sure of anything about Thomas\r\nexcept the purchase of Snitterfield, the year before Sir Walter Arden's\r\ndeath, and his payment of the subsidies in 1526 and 1546. It is probable\r\nhe was the \"Thomas Arden, Squier,\" who witnessed the will of Sir Walter\r\nin 1502; it is _possible_ he was the Thomas Arden who witnessed the will\r\nof John Lench[83] of Birmingham in 1525, though it is more likely that\r\nthis latter Thomas was his nephew, the heir of Park Hall. Thomas of\r\nWilmecote is supposed to have died in 1546, but no will has been\r\ndiscovered. Probably he had handed over his property to his son in his\r\nlifetime. There is no trace of another child than Robert.\r\n\r\nRobert was probably under age when his father purchased Snitterfield,\r\nand hence the need of trustees in association with the purchase. On\r\nDecember 14 and 21, 1519, Robert Arden purchased another property in\r\nSnitterfield from Richard Rushby and Agnes his wife,[84] and he bought\r\nalso a tenement from John Palmer on October 1, 1529.[85] One of his\r\ntenants was Richard Shakespeare. He and his tenant were both presented\r\nfor non-suit of court in 30 Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nHe contributed to the subsidy in Wilmecote in 1526 and 1546. We know no\r\nmore of his first wife than we know of his mother. She might have been\r\neither a Trussel or a Palmer. But we know that he had seven[86]\r\ndaughters, who all bore Arden family names: _Agnes_, who married first\r\nJohn Hewyns, and secondly Thomas Stringer, by whom she had two sons,\r\nJohn and Arden Stringer; _Joan_, who married Edmund Lambert, of\r\nBarton-on-the-Heath, who had a son, John Lambert; _Katharine_, who\r\nmarried Thomas Edkyns of Wilmecote, who had a son, Thomas Edkyns the\r\nyounger; _Margaret_, who married first Alexander Webbe of Bearley (by\r\nwhom she had a son Robert), and secondly Edward Cornwall; _Joyce_, of\r\nwhom there is no record but in her father's settlement and will;[87]\r\n_Alice_, who was one of the co-executors of her father's will, but of\r\nwhom there is no further record; and _Mary_, the other executor, who\r\nmarried John Shakespeare. The exact dates of their birth are not known.\r\nRobert may be supposed to have been married about 1520, and it is\r\nprobable that Mary was born about 1535. It is _likely_ that she was of\r\nage when made executor in 1556, but not at all _necessary_.\r\n\r\nRobert Arden married again when his family had grown up--probably in\r\n1550--Agnes Webbe, who had been assessed as the widow of Hill of Bearley\r\non £7, in 37 Henry VIII., 1546. On July 17, 1550, Robert Arden made two\r\nsettlements of the Snitterfield estates, probably upon his marriage.[88]\r\nIn the first,[89] he devised estates at Snitterfield in trust to Adam\r\nPalmer and Hugh Porter, for the benefit, after the death of himself and\r\nhis wife, of his three married daughters--Agnes, Joan and Katharine. In\r\nthe second, a similar deed,[90] in favour of three other\r\ndaughters--Margaret (then married to Alexander Webbe of Bearley), Joyce\r\nand Alice. Mary is not mentioned, probably because the Asbies estate was\r\neven then devoted to her.\r\n\r\nRobert Arden, sick in body, but good and perfect of remembrance, made\r\nhis last will and testament[91] November 23, 1556, and he must have died\r\nshortly after. This will of itself answers the question as to his\r\nworldly position, and as to the meaning of the word \"husbandman\" in his\r\ncase. The wage of a working \"husbandman\" at the time was from 25s. to\r\n33s. a year.[92] His will discloses property on a level with many\r\n\"_gentlemen_\" of his time and his county. It gives a strong suggestion\r\nthat Mrs. Arden was not on the best of terms with her stepchildren.\r\nRobert bequeathed his soul \"to God and the blessed Lady Saint Mary, and\r\nall the holye company of heaven,\" and his body to be buried in the\r\nchurchyard of Saint John the Baptist at Aston Cantlowe. \"Also I\r\nbequeathe to my youngest daughter Marye all my land at Willincote\r\ncaulide Asbyes, and the crop upon the grownde sown and tythde as hitt is\r\n... and vi^li xiii^s iiii^d of money to be paid her or ere my goodes be\r\ndevided.

It is interesting to learn from the\r\ninventory the nature of the furniture, and the prices of the period.\r\nThere were eleven \"painted cloths\" in the various rooms, the substitutes\r\nfor ancient tapestry even in good homes.\r\n\r\nThe value of the goods, movable and unmovable, independently of the\r\nlanded property, was calculated to be £76 11s. 10d. This was a large sum\r\nfor the period. Probably even then the goods were worth much more, as\r\nthe prices entered are relatively low for the date. Certainly it is\r\nnecessary to multiply the value by ten to translate it into modern\r\nfigures, and that would give a good estimate for the saleable value of a\r\nhouseful of furniture now.\r\n\r\nAfter her sister's and her stepmother's legacies of £6 13s. 4d., after\r\nthe payment of 4d. to every family in the parish, and of 20s. to the\r\noverseers, all debts being paid, Alice was to have a third--that is, the\r\nthird that by old English law belonged to the dead. She would thus have\r\nat least £13 worth in kind, along with her interest in Snitterfield and\r\nwhat goods \"she had of her own.\" The others would have about £5 each. It\r\nmay be noted the widow was left no furniture or goods. She may have\r\nclaimed the widow's third, though the effect of her jointure was to\r\ndisturb the law of dower. She seems to have had furniture of her own.\r\nShe evidently stayed on in her husband's home, and apparently brought\r\nher own children there.\r\n\r\nMary Hill was married to John Fulwood, November 15, 1561, at Aston\r\nCantlow. Agnes Arden, widow, made her will in 1578. The opinion that\r\nthere was no great friendliness with her husband's family is\r\nstrengthened thereby, yet there was not the absolute estrangement some\r\nwriters have supposed. Halliwell-Phillipps states that she does not\r\nmention a member of her husband's family. She left legacies to the poor,\r\nto her godchildren, to her grandchildren, and the residue to her son and\r\nson-in-law in trust for their children. She left twelve pence to John\r\nLambert, her stepdaughter Joan's son, and twelve pence to each of her\r\nbrother Alexander Webbe's children, one of whom, at least, was the son\r\nof her stepdaughter Margaret. She left nothing to any of her\r\nstepdaughters, and nothing to any of the young Shakespeares. The\r\noverseers were Adam Palmer and George Gibbs; so she had been able to\r\nkeep friendly with her husband's friend. The witnesses were Thomas\r\nEdkins (a stepdaughter's husband), Richard Petyfere, and others. She was\r\nburied on December 29, 1580, and the inventory of her goods was taken\r\nJanuary 19, 1580-81. The low rate at which it is calculated is\r\nremarkable. \"Item 38 sheep £3; fivescore pigs £13 4s.,\" etc. The sum\r\ntotal was £45. The will was proved on March 31, 1581.\r\n\r\nThe friendliness between the Shakespeares and the other Arden families\r\nseems to have been unstable. Aunt Joan's husband, Edmund Lambert, of\r\nBarton-on-the-Heath, and their son John, through rather sharp practice\r\nfor cousinly customs, became owners of Asbies. There is a hazy suspicion\r\neven about the bonâ fides of the Edkins. Agnes had settled rather far\r\noff at the home of the Stringers, in Stockton, co. Salop. In February,\r\n1569, Thomas Stringer devised to Alexander Webbe his share of\r\nSnitterfield. John Shakespeare was one of the witnesses to the\r\nindenture. Alexander Webbe, it is true, made John Shakespeare, his\r\nbrother-in-law, the overseer of his will at his death in 1573.\r\n\r\nJoyce Arden and Alice Arden seem both to have died unmarried, without\r\nleaving a will. There is no further mention of Alice, the wealthier of\r\nthe two maiden sisters, resident at Aston Cantlow, neither has there\r\nhitherto been made any suggestion concerning Joyce, and her death does\r\nnot appear in the parish registers. Now, it was an exceedingly common\r\ncustom of the time for poorer single relatives to enter into the service\r\nof wealthier members of the family; for \"superfluous women\" even, who\r\nwere not poor, to go where they were wanted in other homes. Might she\r\nnot have gone in such a capacity to one of the houses of the Ardens of\r\nPark Hall? In Worcestershire, near Stourbridge, there is a parish called\r\nPedmore, and a hall of the same name, then inhabited by the Arden\r\nfamily. The registers there record the death of a \"Mistress Joyce Arden\"\r\nin 1557, to whose family there is no clue: and I cannot but think she\r\nwas Shakespeare's aunt, as the Joyce of Park Hall was married.\r\n\r\nThe Webbes[93] gradually bought up the reversionary shares of the other\r\nArden sisters in Snitterfield, and held the whole as tenants under Mrs.\r\nArden, widow. But the story of the Shakespeares' transfer is so\r\ncuriously mixed up with their other actions that they must be taken\r\ntogether, in order to get a contemporary view of the matter. We find\r\nthat John Shakespeare had apparently pinched himself in 1575 to purchase\r\ntwo houses in Stratford-on-Avon for £40, believed to be in Henley\r\nStreet[94]. By 1578, for some reasons not explained, he was excused his\r\nshare in municipal charges[95], and by a will of \"Roger Sadler\" Baker in\r\nthat year, we know that he was in debt to him, and under circumstances\r\nthat necessitated a security. \"Item of Edmund Lambert and ---- Cornish\r\nfor the debte of Mr. John Shakesper v^li[96].\" John Shakespeare\r\nmortgaged Asbies to Edmund Lambert for a loan of £40 on November 14,\r\n1578[97], the fine being levied Easter, 1579, the mortgagee treating the\r\nmatter as a purchase[98].\r\n\r\nThere is a curious complexity caused by a lease of the same property\r\nbeing apparently granted to George Gibbes, and a double fine\r\nlevied[99]--_i.e._, parties brought in who were strangers to the title;\r\nand a double fine appears to have been levied for technical purposes\r\nwhen the estate was entailed[100]. These other names were Thomas Webbe\r\nand Humphrey Hooper[101]. The mortgage loan was made repayable at\r\nMichaelmas, 1580, when the lease commenced to run, and things seemed to\r\nhave been made safe for the Shakespeares. Then they proceeded to sell a\r\nparcel[102] of the Snitterfield property to Robert Webbe for £40 on\r\nOctober 15, 1579. The description is worded loosely: \"John Shakespeare\r\nyeoman and Mary his wife ... all that theire moietye, parte and partes,\r\nbe yt more or lesse, of and in twoo messuages,\" etc. The indenture is\r\nlong[103], and written in English, and would seem to have been signed at\r\nWilmcote[104].\r\n\r\nA bond was drawn up on the 25th of the same month, carrying a penalty of\r\ntwenty marks against the Shakespeares if they infringed the above\r\nconditions, also signed in the presence of Nicholas Knolles, the Vicar\r\nof Auston or Alveston[105]. Another deed, the final concord,[106] is\r\ndrawn up in Latin: \"in curia domine Regine apud Westmonasterium a die\r\nPasche in quindecim dies anno regnorum Elizabethe ... vicesimo secundo\r\n... inter Robertum Webbe querentem et Johannem Shackspere et Mariam\r\nuxorem ejus, deforciantes _de sexta parte duarum partium duorum\r\nmessuagiorum_ ... idem Robertus dedit predictis Johannis et Marie\r\nquadraginta libras sterlingorum.\" On this sale Robert Webbe paid a fine\r\nof 6s. 8d. for licence of entry to the Sheriff of the County.[107]\r\n\r\nNow, this apparently second sale has puzzled many Shakespeareans, as\r\nwell as the \"fraction.\" Even Halliwell-Phillipps[108] supposes that\r\n\"John Shakespeare had some small interest in Snitterfield of his own,\"\r\nwhich he parted with for £4, and that \"Mary Shakespeare was entitled\r\nto a share through an earlier settlement.\" Others have thought, however,\r\nthat the first was but a draught deed of the indenture, the £4 the\r\nearnest money, and the \"final concord\" for £40 the conclusion of the\r\nwhole. This is supported by the absolute indefiniteness of the first as\r\nto part or parts in two messuages, and by the apparent definiteness of\r\nthe second. But the peculiar wording has further puzzled many writers.\r\nIn referring to Robert Arden's settlements, we find that one tenement is\r\nsettled upon three daughters, and the other tenement settled upon other\r\nthree daughters, Mary's name not being mentioned. How, then, was she\r\nempowered to sell any share? It could only be by inheritance or by gift\r\nfrom some of her other sisters. The course of events showed it was not\r\nof free gift. But Joyce and Alice had apparently vanished from the\r\nscene. If they left no will, their shares would be divisible into equal\r\nparts among their surviving sisters by common law, and through her\r\nfraction of their shares Mary Shakespeare could step in as part owner of\r\nSnitterfield. Now, it is quite possible that the first sale of 1579 was\r\nan indefinite sale of Mary's share of Joyce's portion; and it is\r\npossible that Alice died in that year, and increased the share of her\r\nsisters, so that the two portions were treated together in the deed of\r\n1580. Seeing that the two portions of the property had long been held\r\ntogether by the Webbes, it is quite natural to read \"the sixth part of\r\ntwo\" rather than \"the third of one,\" as each sister originally read her\r\nshare. Now, if Mary had lost both of her sisters, it is quite natural to\r\nread her share as \"the sixth part of two _parts_ or portions of two\r\ntenements.\" This has not yet been thus simply explained. But it is not\r\nstrictly correct; for while the share of the first sister would bring\r\nMary \"the sixth part of one part of two tenements,\" the death of the\r\nsecond sister should have secured her the _fifth part_ of one part of\r\ntwo tenements, plus the fraction already inherited by the second from\r\nthe first, or, more simply, the fifth part of two parts of two\r\ntenements. It was near enough, however, for all practical purposes, and\r\nRobert Webbe seems duly to have handed over the money to John\r\nShakespeare. Robert Webbe's eagerness to buy, and the Shakespeares' need\r\nof the money, seems to have determined the price. Forty pounds was a\r\nlarge sum for such a fraction of the whole. Robert Webbe's readiness may\r\nbe accounted for, because he was on the eve of marriage. There was a new\r\nsettlement[109] of estates at Snitterfield on the occasion of his\r\nmarriage to Mary, daughter of John Perkes, September 1, 23 Elizabeth,\r\nand an agreement between Edward Cornwall[110] (stepfather to Robert\r\nWebbe) and William Perkes, respecting an estate in Snitterfield, and a\r\nproviso against any claim from the Ardens.\r\n\r\nBut it was not from the Ardens that any difficulty arose. Before the\r\ndeath of Mrs. Agnes Arden, she was called to support her claim and that\r\nof all her stepdaughters, based on a supposition of entail, against the\r\ndescendants of the Mayowe who had sold his property to Thomas and Robert\r\nArden in 1501. Being described as old and infirm, a Commission was\r\ndirected to Bartholomew Hales, Lord of the Manor of Snitterfield, and\r\nNicholas Knolles, Vicar of Alveston, to take her deposition concerning\r\nit, in July, 1580.[111] She died in December of that year; and in 1582\r\nJohn Shakespeare,[112] and his brother Henry, and Adam Palmer, with\r\nothers, were called on to give evidence in the case between Thomas\r\nMayowe and Robert Webbe, before Sir Fulk Grevyle, Sir Thomas Lucy,\r\nHumphrey Peto, and William Clopton, Commissioners. Their depositions in\r\nsupport of the deed of transfer seem to have been sufficient, and we\r\nhear no more of Mayowe. The newly-married couple settled down on the\r\ninheritance of the Ardens, and the old home of the Shakespeares.\r\n\r\nConcerning Mary Arden's special inheritance at Asbies, there is a sadder\r\nstory to tell. Whether John Shakespeare could read or not, he was\r\ncertainly not a Latin scholar, and though not ignorant of many points of\r\ncommon law, was not up to all the technicalities used at times to\r\nconfuse the truth. It is evident that there had been some verbal\r\nagreement between him and Edmund Lambert on which he relied, but that\r\nthe written deed was all that John Lambert accepted.[113] On selling the\r\nmain portion of his wife's property at Snitterfield, John Shakespeare\r\nseems to have walked right off with the money to Edmund Lambert, of\r\nBarton-on-the-Heath, to redeem his mortgage, and reinstate himself as\r\nowner of Asbies, free to grant a lease or sale on his own terms. But\r\nthrough a quibble, which \"was not in the bond,\" Edmund Lambert refused\r\nto accept this until certain other debts were also paid. Thereby he\r\ngained the shelter of time, which \"was in the bond,\" and put Shakespeare\r\nat a legal disadvantage, though it is evident from the later papers that\r\na verbal agreement had taken place to extend the time, seeing that the\r\nmoney had been tendered. We may be sure that the property was worth more\r\nthan £40 in hard cash to either, and more, in romantic associations, to\r\nthe Shakespeares. For it was a part of Thomas Arden's original property.\r\nHow he came by it, no one is sure. French[114] suggests it might have\r\nbeen given him by the Beauchamps of Bergavenny, who had intermarried\r\nwith the Ardens, and had been more than once known to have been in\r\nfriendly relations. The guardian of Robert Arden, his grandfather, had\r\nbeen the Lady of Bergavenny, and Elizabeth Beauchamp was godmother to\r\nElizabeth Arden, daughter of Walter and sister of Thomas, whom we take\r\nto be the Thomas of Aston Cantlow.\r\n\r\nEdmund Lambert died in 1587, and his son John seems to have been\r\nthreatened by the Shakespeares with a law-suit for the recovery of\r\nAsbies, and proposed as a compromise to pay a further sum of £20,\r\nthereby securing Asbies as by purchase. To this, however, the consent,\r\nnot only of Mary, but of William, her heir, was necessary, and the poet\r\nis supposed to have come down to Stratford on the occasion to act with\r\nhis parents. But probably there was some other hitch: the £20 may have\r\nbeen held to be covered by the \"other debts,\" which already had done\r\nservice for Edmund Lambert; or the Shakespeares weighed their desire to\r\nhave back the land, which they probably then wished, with their growing\r\nfamily, to farm themselves. Nothing seems then to have been settled, and\r\nthey were too poor to risk the perils of a great law-suit. Doubtless,\r\nwith sad hearts and bitter retrospect, they regretted their unlucky\r\npurchases in 1575, which seemed to have pinched them so, and wished at\r\nleast they had been contented with the half, with the one tenement in\r\nHenley Street that formed part of their residence. For, had they only\r\nspent £20 then instead of £40, they could have repaid their hard-dealing\r\nrelative not only the smaller mortgage, but the \"other debts,\" out of\r\nthe £40 they received for Snitterfield from the more liberal Robert\r\nWebbe.\r\n\r\nFinding John Lambert even harder to deal with than his father, John\r\nShakespeare brought a Bill of Complaint against him in the Court of\r\nQueen's Bench,[115] 1589, by John Harborne, attorney, in which his wife\r\nand son are mentioned. Nothing seems then to have been done. On November\r\n24, 1597, backed by their son's influence and money, John and Mary\r\nShakespeare, plaintiffs, without associating their son's name, made a\r\nformal complaint to the Right Honourable Sir Thomas Egerton,[116]\r\nstating that Edmund Lambert was to hold it only until repaid the loan,\r\nthat the money had been duly tendered to him on the agreed date, that he\r\nhad refused it, and that his son John holds the land still, and makes\r\nsecret estates of the premises, the nature of which they cannot\r\ndescribe, as the papers have been withheld them; that their papers and\r\nevidences are open to the court. They add further that \"the sayde John\r\nLamberte ys of greate wealthe and abilitie, and well frended and allied\r\namongst gentlemen and freeholders of the county ... and your saide\r\noratores are of small wealthe and very fewe frendes and alyance in the\r\nsaid countie. They pray a writ of subpoena to be directed to John\r\nLambert to appear in the Court of Chancery.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Lambert, pointing out the uncertainty and insufficiency of the\r\nplaintiff's bill, also that the bill had _already been exhibited against\r\nhim_ in the same court, and he had fully answered it, asserts that the\r\narrangement was a deed of sale, with the conditional proviso that if\r\nJohn Shakespeare should pay £40 on the Feast of St. Michael the\r\nArchangel, 1580, to Edmund Lambert, in Barton-on-the-Heath, the bill of\r\nsale should be void. He did not pay the money on the day, and therefore\r\nhis father was legally seized of the estate.\r\n\r\nTo this John and Mary Shakespeare replied, and again explained that the\r\nmoney was tendered at the date, and that Edmund Lambert refused to\r\nreceive it unless other moneys also were paid, of which no condition had\r\nbeen fixed; that on the death of Edmund, John had stepped into\r\npossession, and refused to hear anything from them.[117] John Lambert\r\nhad another quibble, that John Shakespeare had exhibited two bills\r\nagainst him, one in his own name, and one associating his wife's. On\r\nJuly 5, 1598, July 10, 1598, and May 18, 1599, further steps were taken,\r\nbut still no decision was reached. Therefore, on June 27, 1599, a\r\ncommission was appointed to examine both parties. In the Index Trin.\r\nTerm, 41 Elizabeth, there is the entry \"Shackspeere contra Lambert,\" but\r\nthe page that contained further notice is lost.\r\n\r\nOn October 23, 1599, another entry of the case is recorded: \"Yf the\r\ndefendant show no cause for stay of publicacion by this day sevenight,\r\nthen publicacion ys granted\"; but nothing more has come to us. Probably\r\ndelay helped the more powerful, certainly possession proved nine-tenths\r\nof the law, and the expenses of legal action even then were\r\nparalyzing.[118] It is strange that the fate of Asbies as a property is\r\nunknown.

On November 26, 1557, he,\r\nalong with the executors of Robert Arden and Thomas Stringer, was\r\nreturned as indebted to the late Hugh Porter of Snitterfield. On\r\nSeptember 13 he prised the goods of Richard Maydes, and on June 1, 1560,\r\nof Henry Cole, of Snitterfield. He is believed to have been the father\r\nof John, Henry, and possibly of Thomas Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nJohn Shakespeare must have come to Stratford-on-Avon, probably from\r\nSnitterfield, some time before 1552, for in that year he is described as\r\na resident in Henley Street, and fined for a breach of the municipal\r\nsanitary regulations, along with Humphrey Reynolds and Adrian Quyney,\r\ntwelvepence a piece.[120] This relatively large sum implies that he must\r\nhave been even then a _substantial_ householder. The determination of\r\nthe house he then dwelt in becomes interesting in its bearing on the\r\ntradition as to the poet's birthplace. Nothing is recorded of John for\r\nthe next few years, but he seems to have prospered in business, trading\r\nin farmers' produce. In a law-suit of 1556, with Thomas Siche of Arscot,\r\nWorcester, he was styled a \"glover.\" In that year he bought from George\r\nTurner a freehold tenement in Greenhill Street, with garden and croft,\r\nwhich is not mentioned in any of his later transactions, and from Edward\r\nWest a freehold tenement and garden in Henley Street, the eastern half\r\nof the birthplace messuage. Each of these was held by the payment of\r\nsixpence a year to the lord of the manor and suit of court. Whether he\r\nhad previously lived in this eastern tenement, or in the western half,\r\nas a tenant has not been absolutely decided.\r\n\r\nHe was summoned on the Court of Record Jury this year, and was party to\r\nseveral small suits, in all of which he was successful. In 1557 he was\r\nelected ale-taster, and curiously enough he was amerced for not keeping\r\nhis gutters clean, in company with Francis Harbage, Chief Bailiff,\r\nAdrian Quyney, Mr. Hall, and Mr. Clopton. He is believed to have married\r\nMary Arden in 1557. The registers of Aston Cantlow, where it is likely\r\nthat Mary was married, do not begin so early. She was single at the time\r\nof her father's death in 1556, and on September 15, 1558, \"Jone[121]\r\nShakespeare, daughter to John Shakespeare, was christened at Stratford\r\nby Roger Divos, minister.\" In 1558 John Shakespeare was elected one of\r\nthe four Constables of the town,[122] and, in 1559, one of the affeerors\r\nor officers appointed to determine the imposition of small arbitrary\r\nfines. In 1561 he was elected one of the Chamberlains, as well as one of\r\nthe affeerors. He remained Chamberlain for two years, and apparently so\r\nwell did he discharge his financial duties in that office that he was\r\ncalled on to assist later Chamberlains in making up their accounts. It\r\nis generally supposed that he could not write, because in attesting\r\ndocuments he made his mark. But I am not sure that this habit is a\r\ncertain sign of his ignorance of the art. Camden himself chose a _mark_\r\nas a signature based on his horoscope. (See his letter to Ortelius,\r\nSept. 14, 1577.)\r\n\r\nIn 1561 Richard Shakespeare of Snitterfield died, and his goods were\r\nadministered by his son, \"John Shakespeare, _Agricola_, of\r\nSnitterfield,\" Feb. 10, 1561-62.[123] Many doubt that, even if he had\r\nany interest in Richard's property, such a description would have been\r\ngiven of the Chamberlain of Stratford-on-Avon. It must not be forgotten\r\nthat there had been a John Shakespeare presented and fined twelvepence\r\non October 1, 1561, in Snitterfield Court, but he may have been the\r\nStratford John. In the description of a neighbouring property in 1570,\r\nwe learn that there was a \"John Shakespeare of Ingon,\" a farm in the\r\nneighbourhood of Snitterfield; and John Shakespeare of Ingon was buried\r\nSeptember 25, 1589, according to Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps.[124] Hence\r\narose reasonable doubts of the identity of John of Stratford with John,\r\nthe heir of Richard Shakespeare of Snitterfield. Still, the evidence is\r\nmuch stronger in support of his identity than against it.\r\n\r\nOn December 2, 1562, the Stratford baptismal register records the\r\nchristening of \"Margaret, daughter of John Shakspere.\" At the making up\r\nof the Chamberlain's accounts for 1562-63 in January, 1563-64, the\r\nChamber was found in debt to John Shakespeare 25s. 8d., as if he had\r\nbeen the finance Chamberlain of the two. Both of his daughters were dead\r\nwhen, on April 26, he christened his firstborn son William. That summer\r\nthe plague raged in Stratford; the Council meetings were held in the\r\ngarden, to avoid infection, and collections were made among the\r\nburgesses for the relief of the poor, to each of which John Shakespeare\r\ncontributed.\r\n\r\nIn 1565 he was chosen alderman, and not only rendered the Chamberlain's\r\naccounts, but seems to have borne their financial liabilities, as in the\r\naccounts for the year is noted, \"Item, payd to Shakspeyr for a rest of\r\nold det £3, 2, 7-1/2,\" the sum which was really entered as a debt in\r\nfavour of the acting Chamberlains. The following year he again made up\r\nthe accounts for the Chamberlains, and the Chamber was found to be in\r\ndebt to him 6s. 8d., a sum that was not repaid until January, 1568.\r\n\r\nFrom the number of petty actions for debt in which he appeared, either\r\nas plaintiff or defendant, one would believe that the business men of\r\nStratford did not care to pay up until they were obliged to do so. In\r\n1566 there occurs an interesting suit, which shows that John Shakespeare\r\nwas even then acquainted with the Hathaways. In two actions against\r\nRichard Hathaway--one for £8, and one for £11--John Shakespeare had been\r\nsecurity, and his name was substituted in the later proceedings for that\r\nof the defendant.\r\n\r\nOn October 13, 1566, his son Gilbert was christened.\r\n\r\nIn 1567 he was assessed on goods to the value of £4[125] for the subsidy\r\n3s. 4d.; and in another entry on £3, 2s. 6d. This was not at all a small\r\nentry for a tradesman of the time. Everyone tried to make his estimate\r\nas small as possible, as men do to-day, when taxes depend on it. He was\r\nnominated that year, though not elected, to the post of High Bailiff, to\r\nwhich office, however, he was elected on September 4, 1568. In the\r\nprecepts that he issued he is styled \"Justice of the peace and Bailiff\r\nof the Town.\"[126] In the Chamberlain's accounts of January 26, 1568-69,\r\nthere is mentioned, \"Item to Mr. Balyf that now is 14/-,\" a sum not\r\nexplained or accounted for; and in 1570 the Chamberlains \"praye\r\nallowance of money delivered to Mr. Shaxpere at sundry times £6,\" during\r\ntheir year 1569-70, as if he had been doing work for the town.[127] On\r\nApril 15, 1569, another daughter Joan was christened; and on September\r\n28, 1571, his daughter Anna. After his year of office, John Shakespeare\r\nwas always called \"Master,\" a point to be remembered in determining the\r\nmeaning of various little records in a town where others of the name\r\ncame to reside. In 1571 he was elected Chief Alderman, and in 1572 he\r\nattained what may really be considered as his chief honour. \"At this\r\nHall yt is agreed by the asent and consent of the Aldermen and burgeses\r\naforesaid, that Mr. Adrian Queney now bailif and Mr. John Shakespeare,\r\nshall at Hilary term next ensuing deale in the affairs concerninge the\r\ncommen wealthe of the Borroughe according to their discrecions.\" This\r\nwas an important consideration to devolve on the shoulders of a man if\r\nhe could not read or write, and it very probably involved a visit to\r\nLondon.[128] In 1574, March 11, his son Richard was born; and in 1575 we\r\nfind the locality of his house in Henley Street determined by William\r\nWedgewood's sale, September 20, to Edward Willis for £44, of his two\r\ntenements \"betwyne the tenement of Richard Hornbee on the east part, and\r\nthe tenement of 'John Shakesper yeoman' on the weste part\"--the street\r\non the south, and the waste ground called Gilpittes on the north. This\r\nshows, therefore, that the east tenement of the birthplace was then in\r\nhis occupation, and that somehow he was entitled yeoman. But in October\r\nhe himself also bought two houses for £40 from Edmund and Emma Hall, the\r\nlocality not specified. One of these has been supposed by some to have\r\nbeen the birthplace, or perhaps both, seeing that later entries make\r\nJohn Shakespeare responsible to the lord of the manor for 13d. for his\r\nwestern tenement, and the garden or toft to the west of it, as against\r\nthe 6d. due for his eastern tenement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRESENT VIEW OF SHAKESPEARE'S BIRTHPLACE.\r\n\r\n_To face p. 55._]\r\n\r\nWe must then face the question, either John Shakespeare owned the\r\nbirthplace in 1552, and resided in it until he added the wool-shop in\r\n1556; or he rented the wool-shop in 1552, which he purchased in 1556; or\r\nhe rented the birthplace in 1552, which he purchased in 1575 from the\r\nHalls. Under whatever circumstances he secured these, both remained free\r\nto him during all his financial difficulties, and descended to his son.\r\nBut these uncertainties create the doubt that remains in the mind of\r\nsome, _Was the poet really born in the birthplace which tradition has\r\nassigned to him, or not?_ To me it seems that the balance of all\r\nconsiderations remains in favour of the birthplace. It is hard to\r\naccount for a purchase in 1575 (that evidently galled him) of any other\r\npremises save those in which he resided. Little is known of John\r\nShakespeare or his family during 1576 and 1577, but in 1578 begin the\r\nrecords of his temporary poverty, which I have noted under the account\r\nof his relations to his wife's relatives. For the Town Council,\r\ndoubtless in consideration of his past services, excused him paying 3s.\r\n4d., as his share of \"the furniture of the pikemen,\" etc.; and, along\r\nwith Mr. Robert Bratt (the poorest member of the Corporation), he was\r\nexcused the 4d. a week imposed on the aldermen for relief of the poor.\r\nThen came the mortgage of Asbies in 1578-79.[129] The following year he\r\nagain left unpaid his share of the levy for armour--3s. 4d.; and he\r\nbegan, probably through shamefacedness, not to show himself at the\r\nHalls, though the State Papers still enter him among the gentlemen and\r\nfreeholders of Warwickshire. But another influence began to affect his\r\ncircumstances prejudicially about this time, and that is, the evil\r\nfortunes of his brother Henry of Snitterfield. How his biographer, in\r\nthe \"Dictionary of National Biography,\" could call this brother \"_a\r\nprosperous farmer_,\" I know not.\r\n\r\nIn 1574 there had been a free fight, wherein blood was drawn, between\r\nhim and Edward Cornwall, who afterwards became the second husband of his\r\nbrother's sister-in-law, Margaret Webbe, _née_ Arden. In the year 1580\r\nthere was an extra long series of actions against him for debt; threats\r\nof excommunication for withholding tithes; fines for refusing to wear\r\nthe statute caps on Sunday; fines for not doing suit of court.\r\nAltogether he seems to have been a high-spirited fellow, who brought on\r\nhimself, through lack of prudence, much of his ill-luck, and who had the\r\nunfortunate knack of involving other people in his troubles.\r\n\r\nIn 1582 both brothers were summoned as witnesses in support of Robert\r\nWebbe against the Mayowe appeal.\r\n\r\nIn November of that year John's eldest son William, of whom no earlier\r\ndirect mention had been preserved, added to his embarrassments by a\r\npremature marriage, and in the following year John was made a\r\ngrandfather by the birth of Susanna Shakespeare. In 1584 the twins\r\nHamnet and Judith were added to his anxieties. About this time the\r\nStratford Records notice how a John Shakespeare was worried by suits\r\nbrought against him by John Brown, in whose favour a writ of distraint\r\nwas issued against Shakespeare in 1586. But the answer was returned that\r\n\"he had nothing whereon to distrain.\"\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons for believing that this John was not the\r\npoet's father. The prefix Mr. is not used in the entries; it is certain\r\nthat he retained his freeholds in Henley Street all his life, and if he\r\nhad \"no goods whereon to distrain,\" he could hardly have been received\r\nas sufficient bail at Coventry, on July 19 of that year, for Michael\r\nPrice, tinker, of Stratford-on-Avon, or as security for his brother\r\nHenry's debts. In 1586 he was removed from his office of alderman.[130]\r\n\r\nJust in the year of the death of Edmund Lambert, when the possession of\r\nmoney would have given him power to have renewed his efforts to regain\r\nAsbies, Henry Shakespeare became a defaulter, and Nicholas Lane, by\r\nThomas Trussell, his attorney, sued John Shakespeare in his place, 1587.\r\nWilliam Court was his attorney in a weary case, which must have led both\r\nsides into heavy costs, over the recovery of £22.[131]\r\n\r\nOn September 1, 1588, he paid a visit to John Lambert at\r\nBarton-on-the-Heath, in the vain hope of inducing him to surrender\r\nAsbies; instituted proceedings against those who owed him money in\r\nStratford, and, in 1589, against Lambert in the Queen's Bench at London,\r\nprobably acting in the latter case through William. From the inquisition\r\npost-mortem of the Earl of Warwick, in 1590, we know Mr. John\r\nShakespeare still owned the two houses in Henley Street.\r\n\r\nIn 1592 Mr. John Shakespeare appraised the goods of two important\r\nneighbours--of Ralph Shawe, wool-driver, July 23, and Henry Field,\r\ntanner, August 21. Thomas Trussell, the attorney, drew up the inventory,\r\nand denominated his associate as Mr. John Shaksper, _Senior_, for no\r\nclear reason, but possibly to distinguish him from the shoemaker John.\r\nThe attestation is witnessed only by a cross. During this year Sir\r\nThomas Lucy and others were drawing up the lists of Warwickshire\r\nrecusants[132] that had been \"heretofore presented.\" Among these they\r\nincluded several members of the sorely-oppressed family of the Ardens of\r\nPark Hall, and in Stratford-on-Avon \"Mr. John Shackspere\" and eight\r\nothers. Probably some friendly clerk, wishing to spare them fines,\r\nadded: \"it is sayd that these last nine coom not to Churche for feare of\r\nprocess for debte.\" But it is quite possible it might refer to John\r\nShakespeare the shoemaker, who, having been Master of the Shoemakers'\r\nCompany, _might_ have been called \"Mr.\"[133] In the earlier undated\r\ndraught from which this was taken the Commissioners state: \"wee suspect\r\ntheese nyne persons next ensuinge absent themselves for feare of\r\nprocesses, Mr. John Wheeler, John his son, Mr. John Shackespeere,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAway up in London in 1593 the tide was beginning to turn for the family\r\nthrough the efforts of the poet and the affection of the Earl of\r\nSouthampton.\r\n\r\nIn this year Richard Tyler sued a John Shakespeare for a debt, but it is\r\nnot at all certain it was not one of the others of the name. In a case\r\nbrought by Adrian Quyney and Thomas Barker against Philip Green,\r\nchandler, Henry Rogers, butcher, and John Shaxspere, in 1595, for a debt\r\nof £5, the absence of a trade after Shakespeare's name has made Mr.\r\nHalliwell-Phillipps suppose that he had retired by this date. A John\r\nShakespeare attested by a cross the marriage settlement of Robert\r\nFulwood and Elizabeth Hill in 1596, which represents probably the name\r\nof the poet's father. In 1597 he sold, to oblige his neighbour, George\r\nBadger, a narrow strip of land at the western side of his Henley Street\r\ngarden, 1-1/2 feet in breadth, but 86 feet in length. For this he\r\nreceived £2 10s., and his ground-rent was reduced from 13d. to 12d., the\r\nodd penny becoming Badger's responsibility. He also sold a plat, 17 feet\r\nsquare, in the garden, behind the wool-shop, to oblige his neighbour on\r\nthe other side, Edward Willis.\r\n\r\nThe application made for coat-armour, initiated in 1596, ostensibly by\r\nJohn Shakespeare, but really by William Shakespeare, as well as the\r\nLambert case, dragged on through the later years of the century.\r\n\r\nThat he had not lost credit with his fellow-townsmen may be seen by\r\nJohn's latest recorded piece of work.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1601 an action was brought by Sir Edward Greville[134] against\r\nthe Corporation respecting the toll-corn; and John Shakespeare, with\r\nAdrian Quyney and others, assisted to draw up suggestions for the use of\r\nthe counsel for the defendants. On September 8 of that year the funeral\r\nof the old burgess took place at Stratford-on-Avon, but there is no\r\ntrace now left of any sepulchral monument or memorial of any kind. No\r\nwill or inventory, or even inquisition post-mortem, has come down to us.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that the Henley Street houses were entailed upon\r\nhis eldest son, or that he may have bought up all rights during his\r\nfather's lifetime to such an extent that \"inheritance\" could hardly be\r\ntalked of. He seems to have indeed supported all the family, as there is\r\nno trace[135] of any of them, except Edmund the player, engaging in any\r\ntrade or profession. Whether his mother resided in Henley Street or at\r\nNew Place is not clear. There is nothing further known of her save the\r\nregister of her burial: \"September 9th, 1608, Mayry Shaxspere Wydowe.\"\r\n\r\nNo sepulchre or memorial of her has come down to our time. We only know\r\nthat somewhere in the consecrated ground by Stratford Church lies the\r\ndust of John Shakespeare and Mary Arden, the parents of the poet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHAKESPEARE'S BIRTH-HOUSE BEFORE THE RESTORATION IN\r\n1857.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[120] Stratford-on-Avon Chamberlain's Accounts, April 29, 6 Edward VI.\r\n\r\n[121] Stratford-on-Avon Baptismal Register.\r\n\r\n[122] All these references are from the Chamberlain's Accounts, and\r\naccounts of the Halls at Stratford-on-Avon.

His previous life must have been a stirring one, though we know\r\nonly too little about it. Still, certain inferences may be soundly based\r\non known facts. He must have been educated at the Stratford Grammar\r\nSchool, free to the sons of the burgesses, a high-class school for the\r\ntime. Its head-master had a salary then double that of the Master of\r\nEton. A taste for learning had certainly imbued William's spirit even in\r\nearly years, but he doubtless warmly shared in the difficulties of his\r\nfather's life, and knew the anxieties of debt, the oppression of the\r\nstrong hand--the \"cares of bread,\" as Mazzini calls it--and the\r\nsickening weariness of the law's uncertainty and delay. Most of his\r\nrelatives were farmers, and his actions show that he would gladly have\r\nfollowed the same course of life, with the relaxation of field sports,\r\nof course, if he could have attained his desire. But the genius within\r\nhim was to be welded by fiery trials, and he was driven on a course that\r\nseemed at discord with his nature, and yet led to its own fulfilment. In\r\nthe enthusiasm of a first love, he married early, not, it must\r\nemphatically be noted, over-early for the custom of the period, when the\r\nmeans of support were assured, but over-early, as it would then have\r\nbeen considered, solely from a financial standpoint. He had no assured\r\nmeans of support. His hope of securing his inheritance of Asbies was\r\nfading. He did not marry an heiress. Many vials of wrath have been\r\npoured on the devoted head of Anne Hathaway by those who do not consider\r\nall sides of the question. Harrowing pictures of the relations of young\r\nShakespeare and \"his aged wife\" are drawn, even by such writers as Dr.\r\nFurnivall. Now, it is a well-known fact that almost all very young men\r\nfancy girls older than themselves, and it is an artistic fact that a\r\nwoman under thirty does look younger, and not older, than a man of the\r\nsame age, if she has led a natural and simple life. It is much more than\r\nlikely that the well-grown, responsible eldest son of anxious John\r\nShakespeare looked quite as old as Anne Hathaway, seven years his\r\nsenior, especially if she was slight and fair and _delicate_, as there\r\nis every reason to believe she was. And the masterful spirit marks its\r\nown age when it goes forth to woo, and determines to win the first real\r\nfancy of his life. It must not be forgotten, in association with the\r\nsituation, that Richard Hathaway of Shottery (for whom John Shakespeare\r\nhad stood surety in 1566) had made his will on September 1, 1581, and\r\ndied between that time and July 9, 1582, when it was proved, leaving his\r\ndaughter Agnes, or Anne, the small but very common marriage portion of\r\n£6 13s. 4d. A break had come into her home life; doubtless she went off\r\nto visit some friends, and the young lover felt he could not live\r\nwithout his betrothed, and determined to clinch the matter.\r\n\r\nMuch unnecessarily unfavourable comment has been made on the peculiar\r\ncircumstances of the marriage. People forget the complexity of religious\r\nand social customs of the time, the binding force of betrothals, the\r\noppression of Catholics. In Robert Arden's settlement of July 17, 1550,\r\nhe speaks of his daughter Agnes as the _wife_ of Thomas Stringer, though\r\nshe did not marry him until October 15, 1550.[136] The perplexity is\r\nincreased by the entry of the marriage license of a William Shakespeare\r\nand Anne Whately of Templegrafton, the day previous to that of William\r\nShakespeare and Anne Hathaway of Stratford, November 28, 1582.[137] It\r\nall seems possible to explain. Travelling was inconvenient on November\r\nroads; Will set out for the license alone, as bridegrooms were often\r\nwont to do, when they could afford the expense of a special license. He\r\nmight give his own name, and that of his intended wife, at a temporary\r\naddress. The clerk made an error in the spelling, which might have been\r\ncorrected; but meanwhile discovered that Shakespeare was under age, was\r\nacting without his parents--that the bride was not in her own home, and\r\nthat no marriage settlement was in the air. No risk might be run by an\r\nofficial in such a case; the license was stayed; sureties must be found\r\nfor a penalty in case of error. So poor Will would have to find, in\r\npost-haste, the nearest friends he could find to trust him and his\r\nstory. And who so likely to ask as Fulk Sandells and John Richardson,\r\nfriends of the Hathaways--the one supervisor, and the other witness to\r\nthe will of Anne's father Richard? They might have been at Worcester\r\nmarket with him.\r\n\r\nThey were both \"good men\" in the financial sense, and their bond for £40\r\nwas accepted at the Bishop of Worcester's Registry in support of the\r\nassertion that there was no impediment against this marriage by ground\r\nof consanguinity or pre-contract. If this were all right, and if the\r\nbride's friends were willing, by which must have been intended her\r\nmother and brothers, then the marriage might be solemnized. It was\r\nclearly a question in which the woman's friends were the proper parties\r\nto summon. The bond of John Shakespeare would not then have been good\r\nfor £40, and the would-be bridegroom had nothing of his own. The place\r\nwhere they were married has not yet been discovered; it is quite\r\npossible to have been at \"a private mass,\" as was the case in another\r\nmarriage with a similar bond at the same registry.[138] But they were\r\nmarried somehow, and William probably brought home his fatherless bride\r\nto his father's house, and there her little portion of £6 13s. 4d. might\r\ngo the further. But a wife and a family of three children sorely\r\nhandicapped a penniless youth, not yet of age, bred to no trade, heir to\r\nno fortune, whose father was himself in trouble.\r\n\r\nThe after-date gossip of wild courses, deer-stealing, and combats with\r\nSir Thomas Lucy, are, I think, quite unfounded on fact. I have discussed\r\nthis fully in my article in the _Athenæum_[139] on \"Sir Thomas Lucy,\"\r\nand in my chapter on \"The Traditional Sir Thomas and the Real.\"[140] It\r\nis much more than likely Shakespeare was concerned in the religious\r\nturmoil of the times, was somewhat suspected, and was indignant at the\r\ncruel treatment of Edward Arden, head of the house, the first victim of\r\nthe Royal Commission[141] in 1583.\r\n\r\nEventually he went to London, probably with introductions to many people\r\nsupposed to be able and willing to help him. There were both Ardens and\r\nShakespeares in London, and many Warwickshire men, and they thought that\r\nsome place might be found even for him, the landless, unapprenticed,\r\nuntrained son of a straitened father. But there were so many in a\r\nsimilar case. It is evident he succeeded in nothing that he hoped or\r\nwished for. His own works prove that. He was unable to act the\r\ngentleman, but was determined to play the man. He may have dwelt with,\r\nand certainly frequently visited, his old Stratford friend Richard\r\nField, the apprentice, son-in-law, and successor of Vautrollier, the\r\ngreat printer. In his shop he learned not only much technical detail of\r\nhis art, but refreshed his education--or, rather, went through another\r\ncourse, reading with a new inspiration and a kindled enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nI have shown elsewhere how very much his mental development owed to\r\nbooks published by Vautrollier and Field,[142] sole publishers of many\r\nLatin works, including Ovid, of Puttenham's \"Art of Poetrie,\" of\r\nPlutarch's \"Lives,\" and many another book whose spirit has been\r\ntransfused into Shakespeare's works. We know that he had tried his hand\r\nat altering plays, at rewriting them, and making them popular; we know\r\nthat he had translated them upon the stage before 1592, because of\r\nGreene's notice then published by Chettle, of \"the upstart crow.\"[143]\r\nAnd he probably had written some. But his first firm step on the\r\nstaircase of fame was taken in the publication of his \"Venus and Adonis\"\r\nby his friend Richard Field in April, 1593, and his first grip of\r\nsuccess in his dedication thereof to the young Earl of Southampton. The\r\nkindness of his patron between 1593 and 1594 had ripened his admiration\r\ninto love; and the dedication of the \"Rape of Lucrece\" in the latter\r\nyear placed the relations of the two men clearly before the world. A\r\ncareful study of the two dedications leads to the conviction that the\r\n\"Sonnets\" could only have been addressed to the same[144] patron. A\r\nstudy of the poems and sonnets together shows much of the character,\r\ntraining, and culture of the author--love of nature, delight in open-air\r\nexercise and in the chase, sympathy with the Renaissance culture, and a\r\nmoral standard of no common order.\r\n\r\nIn his first poem he shows how preoccupation preserves Adonis from\r\ntemptation; in the second how the spiritual chastity of Lucrece is\r\ntriumphant over evil. The one poem completes the conception of the\r\nother, and both lead into the sonnets. In these the author explains much\r\nof his thought and circumstance--\r\n\r\n    \"Alas, 'tis true, I have gone here and there,\r\n    And made myself a motley to the view;\r\n    Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,\r\n    Made old offences of affections new.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,\r\n    The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,\r\n    That doth not better for my life provide\r\n    Than public means, which public manners breeds.\"[145]\r\n\r\nSouthampton did not only chide with Fortune, but took her place. Through\r\nhis stepfather, Sir Thomas Henneage, who had succeeded Sir Christopher\r\nHatton in 1589[146] as Vice-Chamberlain of the Royal Household, he was\r\nable to assist the players, and Shakespeare is for the first time\r\nrecorded as having played twice before the Queen, at Greenwich on St.\r\nStephen's Day, December 26, 1594, and on Innocents' Day, December 28 of\r\nthe same year.[147] On the latter day at night, amid the turmoil of the\r\nGray's Inn revels, Shakespeare's play of the \"Comedy of Errors\" was\r\nrepresented by his company, doubtless through the interest of the Earl\r\nof Southampton, then a student at Gray's Inn. At his coming of age in\r\nOctober, 1594, the young nobleman would be the better able to assist his\r\npoet. Tradition has reported that he gave Shakespeare a large sum of\r\nmoney, generally said to be £1,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GUILD CHAPEL, FROM THE SITE OF NEW PLACE.\r\n\r\n_To face p. 67._]\r\n\r\nHowever it was, the tide of Shakespeare's fortunes turned with his\r\nintroduction to the Earl of Southampton, and his exertions during the\r\nremaining years of the century began to tell in financial returns. It is\r\nsignificant that the first known use to which he put his money was the\r\napplication for the _coat of arms_. In that same year fortune gave him a\r\ncruel buffet in the death of his only son.[148] Nevertheless, he went on\r\nwith his purchase of the largest house in his native town; so that, if\r\nthe bride of his youth had waited long for a home of her own, he did\r\nwhat he could to make up for the delay by giving her the best he could\r\nfind.[149] That he was cautious in his investments was evident. He had\r\nseen too much suffering through rashness in money affairs not to benefit\r\nby the experience. Thereby he made clear his desire for the\r\nrehabilitation of himself and family in the place where he was born. By\r\n1598 we have irrefragable testimony to the position he had already\r\ntaken, alike in the world of letters as in the social life of Stratford.\r\nIn the autumn of that year appeared the perennial advertisement of\r\nMeres, the Professor of Rhetoric at Oxford, Master of Arts of both\r\nUniversities, who ranks him among the first of his day, as an epic and\r\nlyric poet, and as a writer of both tragedy and comedy. \"As the soule of\r\nEuphorbus was thought to live in Pythagoras, so the sweet wittie soul of\r\nOvid lives in mellifluous and honey-tongued Shakespeare.... As Plautus\r\nand Seneca are accounted the best for Comedy and Tragedy among the\r\nLatins, so Shakespeare ... among the English is the most excellent in\r\nboth kinds for the stage ... witness his 'Gentlemen of Verona,' his\r\n'Errors,' his 'Love's Labour's Lost,' his 'Love's Labour Wonne,' his\r\n'Midsummer Night's Dream,' and his 'Merchante of Venice'; for tragedy\r\nhis 'Richard II.,' 'Richard III.,' 'Henry IV.,' 'King John,' 'Titus\r\nAndronicus,' and 'Romeo and Juliet.'\"[150]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Quiney correspondence shows the estimation in\r\nwhich his fellow-townsmen held him--that he had money, that he wanted to\r\ninvest, and was already styled \"master.\" He was considering the policy\r\nof buying \"an odd yard land or other\" in Stratford, when Richard Quiney,\r\nwho was in the Metropolis, was urged by his brother-in-law, Abraham\r\nSturley, to induce Shakespeare to buy one of the tithe leases. \"By the\r\nfriends he can make therefore, we think it a fair mark for him to shoot\r\nat; it obtained, would advance him in deed, and would _do us much\r\ngood_.\" Richard Quiney was in the Metropolis at the end of 1598 on\r\naffairs of the town, trying to secure the grant of a new charter, and\r\nrelief from subsidy; but either on his own account, or the affairs of\r\nthe town, he applied to Shakespeare for a loan. As there are no letters\r\nof Shakespeare's extant, and this is the only one addressed to him, it\r\nis worth noting very specially. It could hardly have been sent, as it\r\nwas found among the Corporation Records. Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps\r\nsuggests that Shakespeare may have called to see Quiney before the\r\nletter was sent off, and given his reply verbally.\r\n\r\n\"Loveinge contreyman, I am bolde of yow, as of a ffrende, craveinge yowr\r\nhelpe with xxx^li uppon Mr. Bushells and my securytee, or Mr. Myttons\r\nwith me.

Shackespere deliver\r\nthees.\"[151]\r\n\r\nAnd Shakespeare then befriended the man whose son was to marry his\r\ndaughter. The reply seems to have been as prompt as satisfactory, for on\r\nthe very same day Quiney wrote to his brother-in-law Sturley, who\r\nreplied on November 4: \"Your letter of the 25th of October came to my\r\nhands, the last of the same at night per Greenway,[152] which imported\r\nthat our Countryman Mr. William Shakespeare would procure us money;\r\nwhich I will like of, as I shall hear when and where and how; and I pray\r\nlet not go that occasion, if it may sort to any indifferent conditions.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Shakespeare had at some time or other associated\r\nhimself with Burbage's company. Now, James Burbage, \"was the first\r\nbuilder of playhouses\" who had planned in 1576, and in spite of evil\r\nreport and professional rivalry, of municipal and royal restrictions,\r\nlegal and other expenses, had successfully carried on \"The Theatre\" in\r\nFinsbury Fields. In 1596 he had purchased the house in Blackfriars,\r\nagainst the use of which as a theatre was sent up to the Privy Council a\r\npetition, which Richard Field signed.[153] The Burbages let this house\r\nfor a time to a company of \"children,\" but eventually resumed it for\r\ntheir own use, and in it placed \"men-players, which were Hemings,\r\nCondell, Shakespeare,\" etc. On Burbage's death in 1597, there was a\r\ndispute about \"The Theater\" lease, and his sons transferred the\r\nmaterials to Southwark, and built the Globe in 1599. On the rearing of\r\nthe Globe at heavy cost, they joined to themselves \"those deserving men\r\nShakespeare, Hemings, Condell, Philips and others, partners in the\r\nProfits of what they call the House, but making the leases for\r\ntwenty-one years hath been the destruction of ourselves and others, for\r\nthey, dying at the expiration of three or four years of their lease, the\r\nsubsequent yeares became dissolved to strangers, as by marrying with\r\ntheire widdowes, and the like by their children.\" (See the papers\r\nconcerning the shares in the Globe, 1535: 1. Petition of Benfield,\r\nSwanston and Pollard to the Lord Chamberlain Pembroke (April). 2. A\r\nfurther petition. 3. The answer of Shank. 4. The answer of C. Burbage,\r\nWinifred, his brother's widow, and William his son. 5. Pembroke's\r\njudgment thereon (July 12). 6. Shanke's petition (August 7). 7.\r\nPembroke's final decision.)[154]\r\n\r\nBurbage, Shakespeare, Condell, Hemings had been housekeepers with four\r\nshares each. These originally died with the owner, but in later years\r\ncould be inherited. Shakespeare's income therefore arose from:\r\n\r\n1. Possibly some small sum allowed him by Richard Field and the\r\npublishers for various editions of his poems, as well as the liberality\r\nof the Earl of Southampton on their account.\r\n\r\n2. Direct payments by the proprietors for altering and writing plays.\r\nShares in their publication he never seems to have had.\r\n\r\n3. His share as a player of the money taken at the doors.\r\n\r\n4. His share as a partner in the house of the money taken in the\r\ngalleries, etc.\r\n\r\n5. His share of royal largesse in performances before the Queen, or\r\nsimilar gifts from noblemen.[155]\r\n\r\n6. His share of performances in various performing tours.\r\n\r\nAnd thence he acquired money enough to buy New Place; to appeal to the\r\nheralds for his father's coat of arms, and to pay the costs; to contest\r\nthe Lamberts' claim through successive applications for Asbies; and to\r\nbuy land and tithe leases. The death of his only son Hamnet did not\r\ndeter him in his earnest efforts to regain social position, and to\r\nrestore the fortunes of his family. An almost exact parallel may be\r\nfound in the efforts and aims of Sir Walter Scott. But Shakespeare,\r\nhaving borne the yoke in youth, had acquired the experience and prudence\r\nnecessary to steer himself past the dangers of speculation and the\r\nrashness of exceeding his assured income, which proved fatal to the less\r\nseverely-trained novelist.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1602, he purchased from the Combes for £320 about 107 acres of\r\nland near Stratford-on-Avon, of which, as he was not in the town, seisin\r\nwas granted to his brother Gilbert. On September 28, 1602, Walter Getley\r\ntransferred to him a cottage and garden situated in Chapel Lane,\r\nopposite the lower gardens of New Place, quite possibly intended for the\r\nuse of his brothers. It appears from the roll that he did not appear at\r\nthe Manorial Court in person,[156] then held at Rowington, there being a\r\nstipulation that the estate should remain in the hands of the lady of\r\nthe manor, the Countess of Warwick, until he appeared to complete the\r\ntransaction with the usual formalities. On completing these, he\r\nsurrendered the property to his own use for life, with remainder to his\r\ntwo daughters, a settlement rearranged afterwards in his will. It is\r\nmentioned as in his possession in a subsequent subsidy roll of the\r\ntown.[157]\r\n\r\nThe only time in which he touched politics and State affairs he was\r\nunfortunate. There is no doubt he must have trembled at the time of the\r\nEssex Conspiracy, not only for his friend Southampton's life, but even\r\nfor his own; for Philips, the manager of his company, was called before\r\nthe Privy Council to account for the performances of the obnoxious play\r\nof \"Richard II.\"\r\n\r\nThe danger passed. Probably the Privy Council thought it futile to\r\nattack the \"Puppets.\" Nevertheless, after fulfilling their engagements\r\nthey hastened from the Metropolis.[158] Some of his company went to play\r\nin Scotland, as far north as Aberdeen.[159] I am inclined to think\r\nShakespeare went with them. The scenery in \"Macbeth\"[160] suggests vivid\r\nvisual impressions, and the favour of James VI. must have been secured\r\n_before_ his accession to the throne of England, for almost the first\r\nact the King did on his arrival at the Metropolis, May 7, 1603, was to\r\nexecute a series of Acts that practically gave his company a monopoly.\r\n\r\n     \"Pat.

His later\r\npatron, the Earl of Pembroke, was recalled to Court favour. The King\r\nvisited him in his royal progress August 30 and 31, 1603, and held his\r\nCourt at Wilton, Winchester,[162] and Basing during most of October,\r\nNovember,[163] and December, during which time the players were summoned\r\non December 2. \"To John Hemyngs on 3rd December, for a play before the\r\nKing, by the King's men at Wilton, and for coming from Mortlake in\r\nSurrey, £30.\"[164]\r\n\r\nOn March 15, 1603-1604, the King's players were summoned to the\r\nTriumphant Royal Procession, received robes for the occasion, and took\r\nrank at Court[165] with the Grooms of the Chamber. Henceforth\r\nShakespeare's genius revelled in the opportunities fortune had made for\r\nhim, and in the taste he had himself educated. The world appreciated his\r\nwork the better \"that so did take Eliza and our James.\"[166] The snarls\r\nof envy witnessed his success; the eulogiums of admirers perpetuated his\r\nappreciation. On May 4, 1605, Augustine Phillips died, leaving by will\r\n\"to my fellow William Shakespeare a thirty-shilling piece in gold.\" In\r\nJuly of that year (July 24, 1605) Shakespeare completed his largest\r\npurchase, in buying for £440 the unexpired term of the moiety of the\r\ntithe-lease of Stratford, Old Stratford, Bishopton, and Welcombe.\r\n\r\nIn that year John Davenant took out the lease of the Crown Inn at\r\nOxford, where the following year his son William was born. Gossip,\r\nsupported, if not originated, by himself, suggests that William Davenant\r\nwas the son rather than the godson of Shakespeare, an unfounded slander\r\ndisposed of by Halliwell-Phillipps.\r\n\r\nOn June 5, 1607, Susanna Shakespeare married Dr. Hall. Elizabeth, their\r\nonly child, and the only grandchild Shakespeare saw, was born in\r\nFebruary, 1607-1608, and in September of that year John Shakespeare's\r\nwidow--Shakespeare's mother--died.\r\n\r\nIt is probable Shakespeare returned home to his mother's funeral, as he\r\nwas chief godfather on October 16 to the William Walker of Stratford to\r\nwhom he bequeathed 20s. in gold in 1616. In 1608 and 1609 Shakespeare\r\ninstituted a process for debt against John Addenbroke and his security\r\nHornebie. His attorney was his cousin, Thomas Greene, then residing,\r\nunder unknown conditions, at New Place. In the latter year he instituted\r\nmore important proceedings concerning the tithes. The papers of the\r\ncomplaint by Lane, Green, and Shakespeare to Lord Ellesmere in 1612,\r\nconcerning other lessees, give details of the income he derived\r\ntherefrom.[167]\r\n\r\nIn 1610 he purchased 20 acres of pasture-land from the Combes to add to\r\nhis freeholds. The concord of the fine is dated April 13, 1610, and, as\r\nit was acknowledged before the Commissioners, he is believed to have\r\nbeen in Stratford at the time. In a subscription list drawn up at\r\nStratford September 11, 1611, his name is the only one entered on the\r\nmargin, as if it were a later insertion, \"towards the charge of\r\nprosecuting the Bill in Parliament for the better repair of Highways.\" A\r\nParliament was then expected to meet, but it was not summoned till long\r\nafterwards. In 1612 Lane, Green, and Shakespeare filed a new bill of\r\ncomplaint concerning the tithes before Lord Ellesmere.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1613, he made a curious purchase of a tenement and yard, one\r\nor two hundred yards to the east of the Blackfriars Theatre. The lower\r\npart had long been in use as a haberdasher's shop. The vendor was Henry\r\nWalker, a musician, who had paid £100 for it in 1604, and who asked then\r\nthe price of £140. Shakespeare, however, at this raised price secured\r\nit, leaving £60 of it on mortgage. The date of the conveyance deed is\r\nMarch 10, 1613,[168] probably signed on the 11th, on which day it was\r\nenrolled in the Court of Chancery. Besides the witnesses to this\r\ndocument, there was present Henry Lawrence, the scrivener who had drawn\r\nit up, who unfortunately lent his seal to the poet, which still exists,\r\nbearing the initials \"H. L.\"\r\n\r\nShakespeare is believed to have written two plays a year while he was a\r\nshareholder. On June 29, 1613, the Globe Theatre was destroyed by fire\r\nwhile the history of Henry VIII. was being enacted. Burbage, Hemings,\r\nCondell, and the Fool were so long in leaving the theatre that the\r\nspectators feared for their safety. It is not known whether this fire\r\nwould prove a loss to him. In June of that year a malicious piece of\r\ngossip was circulating in Stratford against the good name of\r\nShakespeare's daughter, Susanna Hall. The rumour was traced to a man\r\ncalled Lane, who was summoned to appear before the Ecclesiastical Court\r\nat Worcester on July 15, 1613. He did not venture to appear, and he was\r\nduly excommunicated for perjury.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom for the Corporation then to make complimentary\r\nofferings of wine to those whom they wished to honour, and thus they\r\nhonoured an itinerant preacher, quartered at New Place, in the spring of\r\n1614, with a quart of sack and another of claret, and this has been\r\nsupposed to prove that the poet had turned Puritan. John Combe, one of\r\nthe chief men of the neighbourhood, died in July, 1614, leaving\r\nShakespeare £5. Shakespeare would probably never receive it. The will,\r\ndated January 28, 1612-13, was not proved till November, 1616. It is\r\nclear, however, that these men were friendly at that time, and that the\r\nmock elegy, attributed to Shakespeare, could not then have been written,\r\nor, if written, was only laughed at. The Globe Theatre was rebuilt at\r\ngreat cost that year. Chamberlain, writing to a lady in Venice, said: \"I\r\nhear much speech of this new playhouse, which is sayde to be the fayrest\r\nthat ever was in England\" (June 30, 1614).\r\n\r\nIn the same year, William Combe, the new Squire of Welcombe, attempted\r\nenclosure of some of the common fields, a design resisted by the\r\nCorporation. This scheme materially affected Shakespeare through his\r\ntithes, and much discussion has been waged over the true meaning of\r\nthe entries of his cousin, Thomas Green, the Town Clerk of\r\nStratford-on-Avon, and his attorney. Unfortunately, these are badly\r\nwritten, and the composition is dubious; but to my mind it seems clear\r\nthat Green meant to say that Mr. Shakespeare could not bear the\r\nenclosing of Welcombe.[169]\r\n\r\nIn the opening of 1615-16 Shakespeare found himself \"in perfect healthe\r\nand memorie--God be praised\"; and yet, for some reason, he wished to\r\nmake a new will, \"revoking all other wills,\" and his solicitor, Francis\r\nCollins of Warwick, drew up a draft. Halliwell-Phillipps thinks this was\r\ndone in January, and that it was intended to have been signed on the\r\n25th of that month. I own that the date, erased to be replaced by\r\n\"March,\" looks to me more like \"February.\" An important difference it\r\nwould be, because in January he might not have known that his daughter,\r\nJudith Shakespeare, aged 32, had made up her mind to marry Thomas\r\nQuiney, aged 28. By February 25 she had already done it. On February 10,\r\n1616, Thomas Quiney was married, at Stratford-on-Avon, to Judith\r\nShakespeare without a license, an irregularity for which both the\r\nparties were summoned to appear[170] before the Ecclesiastical Courts\r\nsome weeks afterwards, and threatened with excommunication, but probably\r\nthe fact of Shakespeare's illness and death would act as an excuse in\r\nhigh quarters.\r\n\r\nThough it seems to me that the will must have been drawn up before\r\nJudith's marriage, the possibility of such a change of state is clearly\r\nconsidered. There is no sign of indignation at the later date of the\r\nsigning of the will, and £300 was a large portion; and there are no\r\nalterations in his bequests to her, except a curious one. The first\r\nbequest was originally intended to have been in favour of \"_my sonne\r\nand_ daughter Judith,\" but the \"sonne\" was erased. Of course, this\r\npossibly arose from the scrivener intending to start with the Halls. But\r\nthe less important bequests came first. One hundred and fifty pounds was\r\nto be paid to Judith within a year, in two instalments, the £100 in\r\ndischarge of her marriage portion, and the £50 on her surrendering her\r\nshare in the copyhold tenement in Stratford-on-Avon (once Getley's) to\r\nher sister, Susanna Hall. Another £150[171] was to be paid Judith, or\r\nany of her heirs alive at the date of three years after the testator's\r\ndeath. If she had died without issue at that date, £100 thereof was to\r\ngo to Elizabeth Hall, and £50 to his sister Joan and her children. If\r\nJudith were alive, the stock was to be invested by the executors, and\r\nonly the interest paid her as long as she was married, unless her\r\nhusband had \"assured her in lands answerable to her portion.\"\r\n\r\nSister Joan was to have £20, the testator's wearing apparel, and a\r\nlife-rent in the Henley Street house, under the yearly payment of one\r\nshilling. Five pounds a piece were left to her sons. Elizabeth Hall was\r\nto have all the plate, except his broad silver-gilt bowl, which he left\r\nto Judith. Ten pounds he left to the poor, his sword to Mr. Thomas\r\nCombe, £5 to Thomas Russell, £13 6s. 8d. to Francis Collins. Rings of\r\nthe value of 26s. 8d. each were left to Hamnet Sadler, William Reynolds,\r\ngent., Antony Marsh, gent., Mr. John Marsh; and in interpolation \"to my\r\nfellows, John Heming, Richard Burbage, and Henry Condell,\" and to\r\nWilliam Walker, his godson, 20s. in gold.\r\n\r\nTo enable his daughter Susanna to perform all this, she received \"the\r\nCapital Messuage called New Place, wherein I now dwell, two messuages in\r\nHenley Street, and all my Barns, Stables, Orchards, Gardens, Lands,\r\nTenements and hereditaments whatsoever lying in Stratford-upon-Avon, Old\r\nStratford, Bishopton, and Welcombe, in the County of Warwick\"; and \"that\r\nMessuage in Blackfriars in London near the Wardrobe wherein one John\r\nRobinson now dwelleth.\"\r\n\r\nThe descent was to be to her sons if she had any, failing whom to the\r\nsons of his grand-daughter Elizabeth, failing whom to the sons of his\r\ndaughter Judith, failing whom \"to the right heires of me William\r\nShakespeare for ever.\"\r\n\r\nItem interpolated: \"I give unto my wife my second-best bed, with the\r\nfurniture.\"\r\n\r\nEverything else to his \"sonne-in-law John Hall, gent., and to his\r\ndaughter Susanna, his wife,\" whom he made executors.\r\n\r\nThomas Russell, Esq., and Francis Collins, gent., were to be overseers.\r\nThere were several witnesses. It was proved June 22, 1616, by John Hall,\r\nat Westminster, but the inventory is unfortunately lost.\r\n\r\nMuch discussion has taken place over Shakespeare's legacy to his wife.\r\nIt may very simply and naturally have arisen from some conversation in\r\nwhich a reference had been made to giving her \"the best bed.\" But that\r\nwas the visitor's couch. \"The second-best\" would have been her own, that\r\nwhich she had used through the years, and he wished her to feel that\r\nthat was not included in the \"residue.\" That was to be her very own. As\r\nto any provision for her, it must have taken the form of a settlement, a\r\njointure, or a dower. There is no trace of the first or second. But the\r\nEnglish law then assured a widow in a third of her husband's property\r\nfor life and the use of the capital messuage, if another was not\r\nprovided her. The absence of all special provision for Mrs. Shakespeare\r\nseems to have arisen from her husband's knowledge of this and his trust\r\nin the honour of Mr. John Hall, and the love of his daughters for their\r\nmother. It also supports my opinion of her extreme delicacy of\r\nconstitution. She was not to be overweighted by mournful\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\nThe indefiniteness of the residuary inheritance leaves room for surmise.\r\nA curious reference, not, it seems to me, hitherto sufficiently noted,\r\noccurs in the Burbage Case of 1635. Cuthbert, Winifred, the widow of\r\nRichard, and William his son, recite facts concerning their father\r\nJames, who was the first builder of playhouses. \"And to ourselves we\r\njoined those deserving men, _Shakspere_, Hemings, Condell, Phillips, and\r\nothers, _partners[172] in the profittes of that they call the House_;\r\nbut _makeing the leases for twenty-one yeares hath been the destruction\r\nof ourselves and others_, for _they dying at the expiration of three or\r\nfour yeares of their lease, the subsequent yeeres became dissolved to\r\nstrangers, as by marrying with their widdowes and the like by their\r\nchildren_.\"\r\n\r\nIf Shakespeare's \"lease\" had not then expired, which seems to me\r\nimplied, it would have been \"dissolved to a stranger\" in the person of\r\nDr. Hall.\r\n\r\nSome ready money would be required for the carrying out of the will.\r\nThree hundred pounds left to Judith, and £73 13s. 4d. in smaller\r\nbequests, would certainly run up to £400 by the payment of debts and\r\nfuneral expenses. The eagerness to leave all land to his own children is\r\nanother proof of Shakespeare's earnest desire to found a family.\r\n\r\nShakespeare did not immediately die after the signing of his will.\r\nProbably the devoted care of his wife and daughters and the skill of his\r\nson-in-law soothed his dying moments. But one cannot but have a lurking\r\nsuspicion of maltreatment through the crude medical notions of the time:\r\nof bleeding when there should have been feeding; of vile medicines when\r\nNature should have been supported and not undermined by art. At all\r\nevents, Dr. John Hall had not the happiness and honour to record the\r\nname of his illustrious father-in-law in his book of \"Cures.\"[173] This\r\nwas the one great failure of his life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHANCEL, TRINITY CHURCH.\r\n\r\n_To face p. 83._]\r\n\r\nThe April 23 on which Shakespeare closed his eyes completed his cycle of\r\nfifty-two years, according to ordinary reckoning. But strangely enough\r\nthere is entered on his tombstone \"Ætatis 53,\" and this suggests that he\r\nhad been born on April 22. No records of his funeral have come down to\r\nus, but it must have made a stir in his native place. He was a native of\r\nthe town, known to all in his youth, and loved by many. Yet, on the\r\nother hand, he had offended all the traditions of the borough. He had\r\ndescended from the safe levels of trade to the vagabond life of a\r\n\"common player,\" especially detested in Stratford-on-Avon (see notes);\r\nhe had made money somehow in the city, and had returned to spend it in\r\nhis native town, but he had never taken office, and had never been \"one\r\nof them.\" And at the end he was to be buried in the Chancel, the select\r\nspot for nobles and prelates and \"great men.\" Verily the tongues of the\r\ngossips of Stratford would wag on April 25, 1616. The authorship of the\r\ndoggerel lines on his tomb has been attributed to various people.\r\nProbably they were a part of the stock-in-trade of the stone-cutter,\r\nthat satisfied Shakespeare's widow as expressing a known wish of her\r\n\"dear departed.\" Rude as they are, they have fulfilled their end:\r\n\r\n    \"Good Frend, for Jesus' sake forbeare\r\n    To digg the dust encloased here;\r\n    Bleste be the man that spares thes stones,\r\n    And curst be he that moves my bones.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Shakespeare's friends had been planning a monument to be\r\nplaced on the northern wall of the Chancel. The bust is said to have\r\nbeen prepared from a death-mask, and to have been sculptured by one\r\nGerard Johnson, son and successor of the Amsterdam tomb-maker, whose\r\nplace of business lay between St. Saviour's Church and the Globe\r\nTheatre. He may be presumed to have frequently seen Shakespeare in his\r\nlifetime. The exact date of its erection is not known, but it would seem\r\nto have been some time before 1623, as Leonard Digges refers to it in\r\nhis poem prefixed to the First Folio, \"To the Memorie of the deceased\r\nAuthour, Maister W. Shakespeare\":\r\n\r\n    \"Shakespeare, at length thy pious fellowes give\r\n    The World thy Workes--thy Workes, by which outlive\r\n    Thy touche thy name must; when that stone is rent,\r\n    And Time dissolves thy Stratford monument,\r\n    Here we alive shall view thee still.\"\r\n\r\nCrude and inartistic as it is, the bust must have had some likeness in\r\nits earlier days to have satisfied critical eyes; but it has passed\r\nthrough so many vicissitudes, and suffered so much restoration, that the\r\nlikeness may have entirely vanished by this time. Nevertheless, it\r\nremains a witness to the affection of the surviving, and a witness,\r\nPuritans though they were, that it was on account of the power of _his\r\npen_ that he deserved special remembrance.\r\n\r\nUpon a mural tablet are other verses, which would seem not to have been\r\ncomposed by his own friends, as they speak of Shakespeare's lying\r\n\"within this monument.\" Whoever wrote them, the family accepted them,\r\nand the world has endorsed them:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWilliam Camden had finished his \"Britannia\" by 1617 (commenced in 1597),\r\nprinted in 1625. He says of Stratford Church: \"In the chancel lies\r\nWilliam Shakespeare, a native of this place, who has given ample proof\r\nof his genius and great abilities in the forty-eight plays he has left\r\nbehind him.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the First Folio, 1623, was _intended_ by his\r\n\"fellows\" at the Globe to stand as their monument to his memory, built\r\nof the plays that had become their private property by purchase. The\r\nverses that preface it, written by W. Basse, suggest that Shakespeare\r\nshould have been buried by Chaucer, Spenser, Beaumont, in the Poets'\r\nCorner of Westminster Abbey. But the author withdraws his wish.\r\n\r\n    \"Sleep, Brave Tragedian, Shakspere, sleep alone\r\n    Thy unmolested rest, unshared cave\r\n    Possess as Lord, not tenant to thy grave,\" etc.\r\n\r\nArchy's \"Banquet of Jests,\" printed in 1630, tells of one travelling\r\nthrough Stratford, \"a town most remarkable for the birth of famous\r\nWilliam Shakespeare.\" In the same year is said to have been written\r\nMilton's memorable epitaph (printed 1632), a noble testimony from the\r\nPuritan genius to the power of his play-acting brother:\r\n\r\n    \"What needs my Shakspere for his honoured bones,\r\n    The labour of an age in pilèd stones?\r\n    Or that his hallowed reliques should be hid\r\n    Under a star y-pointing pyramid?\r\n    Dear son of memory, great heir of fame,\r\n    What needst thou such weak witness of thy fame?\r\n    Thou, in our wonder and astonishment,\r\n    Hast built thyself a live-long monument,\" etc.\r\n\r\nBy 1651 had already been suggested an annual commemoration of his life\r\nin Samuel Sheppard's \"Epigram on Shakspere,\" verse 6:\r\n\r\n    \"Where thy honoured bones do lie,\r\n      As Statius once to Maro's urn,\r\n    Thither every year will I\r\n      Slowly tread and sadly turn.\"\r\n\r\nThe State Papers even show the appreciation of his age.[174] But I was\r\npleased to find that the first recorded _student_ of Shakespeare was a\r\nwoman. On January 21, 1638,[175] Madam Anne Merrick, in the country,\r\nwrote to a friend in London that she could not come to town, but \"must\r\ncontent herself with the study of Shakespeare and the 'History of\r\nWomen,'\" which seem to have constituted all her country library. The\r\nJudges of King Charles I. reproached him with the _study_ of\r\nShakespeare's Plays.[176]\r\n\r\nThese records also contain a bookseller's (Mr. Moseley's) account[177]\r\nfor books, probably provided to Lord Conway, among which are \"Ben\r\nJonson's poems, 6d., Beaumont's poems, 6d., Shakespeare's poems, 1/-,\"\r\netc.\r\n\r\nOther references to Shakespeare's works occur in the same records. But\r\nas this is not intended as a literary biography, I forbear to reproduce\r\nthem now.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[136] Bearley Registers.\r\n\r\n[137] Worcester Marriage Licenses.\r\n\r\n[138] Francis Throgmorton, son and heir of Sir John Throgmorton, of\r\nFeckenham, to Anne Sutton, alias Dudley, daughter of Sir Edward Sutton,\r\nJune 3, 1571.

He had three children: Susanna, and Hamnet\r\nand Judith, twins. The boy died young, in 1596, _before_ the grant of\r\narms was completed. Anne Hathaway is described as of Stratford in the\r\nmarriage bond, but so were Fulk Sandells and John Richardson, the\r\nbondsmen, known to be of Shottery. Indeed, the village lay within the\r\nparish of Stratford.\r\n\r\nGwillim mentions arms,[178] \"Sable, a bugle, or hunter's horn, garnished\r\nand furnished argent. This coat-armour is of very ancient erection in\r\nthe church of Rewardine, in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, and\r\npertained to the family of Hatheway of the same place.\" Again he says,\r\n\"Paleways of six, Argent and sable, on a bend Or, three pheons[179] of\r\nthe second, by the name of Hatheway.\"[180]\r\n\r\nThe Hathaways from whom Anne Shakespeare descended have not been proved\r\nto be of the Gloucestershire stock, nor is it absolutely certain to\r\nwhich of the three Shottery families she belonged. In the Warwickshire\r\nSurvey (Philip and Mary) it is stated that John Hathaway held part of a\r\nproperty at Shottery, called Hewlands, by copy of Court Roll dated April\r\n20, 1542. He was possibly the same as the archer of that name, mentioned\r\nin the Muster Roll 28 Henry VIII., and was probably father of the\r\nRichard befriended by John Shakespeare in 1566. The Stratford registers\r\nrecord the birth of Thomas, son of Richard Hathaway, April 12, 1569;\r\nJohn, February 3, 1574, and William, November 30, 1578. Anne Hathaway,\r\nwe know, from the words on her tombstone, must have been born before the\r\nregister commenced (1558). There is not another Agnes, or Anne, recorded\r\nthat could represent the legatee of Richard Hathaway's will of\r\nSeptember, 1581. To his eldest son, Bartholomew, he left the farm,[181]\r\nto be carried on with his mother; to his second and third sons, Thomas\r\nand John, he left £6 13s. 4d. each; to his fourth son, William, £10; to\r\nhis daughters, Agnes (or Anne) and Catherine, £6 13s. 4d., to be paid on\r\nthe day of their marriage; and to his youngest daughter, Margaret, £6\r\n13s. 4d. when she was seventeen. Witnessed by Sir William Gilbert, clerk\r\nand curate of Stratford.\r\n\r\nThe farm was not a freehold; Bartholomew did not become its owner until\r\n1610, when he purchased it from William Whitmore and John Randall.\r\nRichard Hathaway mentions in his will his \"shepherd, Thomas Whittington\r\nof Shottery.\" This man died in 1601, and by his will bequeathed to the\r\npoor \"Forty shillings that is in the hand of Anne Shaxspere, wife unto\r\nMr. Wyllyam Shaxspere, and is debt due to me.\" It was a common custom of\r\nthe days before savings-banks, for poor earners to deposit their savings\r\nin the charge of rich and trustworthy friends, and this little link\r\nseems to associate Anne Shakespeare doubly with that particular family\r\nof Hathaways.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANNE HATHAWAY'S COTTAGE.\r\n\r\n_To face p. 88._]\r\n\r\nShakespeare does not mention any of his wife's relatives in his will,\r\nbut that does not necessarily imply coldness of feeling. Dr. John Hall,\r\nhis son-in-law, was made overseer of Bartholomew Hathaway's will in\r\n1621, and in 1625 he was one of the trustees at the marriage of Isabel,\r\nhis granddaughter, the daughter of Richard Hathaway of Bridge Street. A\r\nRichard is mentioned in the registers as being baptized in 1559 (but it\r\nis not clear that he was the son of this Richard or of Bartholomew), who\r\nbecame a baker in Bridge Street, an important member of the Town\r\nCouncil, and Constable in 1605. He was elected High Bailiff of Stratford\r\nin 1526, and was styled \"gent.\" Many of the name are buried in Trinity\r\nChurch, Stratford.\r\n\r\nIn the rather remarkable testament of Thomas Nash,[182] first husband of\r\nShakespeare's only granddaughter, Elizabeth, he left £50 to Elizabeth\r\nHathaway, £50 to Thomas Hathaway, and £10 to Judith Hathaway. His wife\r\nalso remembered them, as will be afterwards shown. William Hathaway, of\r\nWeston-upon-Avon, in the county of Gloucester, yeoman, and Thomas\r\nHathaway, of Stratford-upon-Avon, joiner, were parties to the New Place\r\nsettlement of 1647.\r\n\r\nAll this shows that the Shakespeares were not ashamed of their mother's\r\nrelatives. We do not know anything about Anne Shakespeare after her\r\nhusband's death until we reach the record of her own, \"August 8th, 1623,\r\nMrs. Shakespeare.\"[183]\r\n\r\nTradition says that she earnestly desired to be buried in her husband's\r\ngrave. The survivors were not able to secure this, but they buried her\r\nas near him as they could. Her daughter Susanna's grief is recorded in\r\ntouching lines, probably Latinized by Dr. Hall, placed on her tombstone:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n     \"Thou, my mother, gave me life, thy breast and milk; alas!\r\n     for such great bounty to me I shall give thee a tomb. How\r\n     much rather I would entreat the good angel to move the\r\n     stone, so that thy figure might come forth, as did the body\r\n     of Christ; but my prayers avail nothing. Come quickly, O\r\n     Christ; so that my mother, closed in the tomb, may rise\r\n     again and seek the stars.\"[184]\r\n\r\nOf Anne Shakespeare's children we have already spoken. Susannah was born\r\nMay 26, 1583, Hamnet and Judith, February 2, 1584-85. Hamnet--surely the\r\nmodel of Shakespeare's sweet boys--had died on August 11, 1596. So the\r\nname Shakespeare had glorified was doomed to die with himself, and was\r\nnot to be borne by lesser men. His property the poet could and did\r\ndevise.\r\n\r\nMuch discussion has taken place concerning the poet's views of his\r\nyounger daughter and her marriage. I do not think these views at all\r\nsupported by his will. Three hundred pounds was a very large portion\r\nindeed at the time. It was demised to her doubtless before her marriage,\r\nbut it was not altered in relation to her after her marriage. It would\r\nbe hard indeed to believe that such a ceremony, even without a license,\r\ncould be performed in the gossipy town of Stratford without the news of\r\nit somehow reaching the father's ears, if there had been any attempt\r\nreally to deceive. There is no reason to imagine Shakespeare disapproved\r\nof the alliance. The young man came of an old Stratford family. It is\r\npossible, however, that the poet foresaw a certain degree of instability\r\nof character in the youth, and therefore wished to make his will act as\r\na marriage settlement that would secure his daughter from starvation.\r\nThe second half of his bequest might only be touched by her husband, if\r\nhe had settled on her land of equal value. This Thomas Quiney does not\r\nseem to have done.\r\n\r\nRichard Quiney had died 1601-2, and his widow Elizabeth kept a tavern,\r\nin which she was probably at one time assisted by her younger son\r\nThomas. In December, 1611, she conveyed a house to William Mountford for\r\n£131, and Judith Shakespeare was a subscribing witness. But neither she\r\nnor her future mother-in-law signed their names, nor even the customary\r\ncross, but a strangely-penned device of their own. Thomas Quiney lived\r\nin a small house in the High Street until after his marriage. It was\r\nprobably his wife's money that enabled him to lease the larger house on\r\nthe other side, called \"The Cage,\" and to start therein business as a\r\nvintner.\r\n\r\nAt first he was successful. He was made a burgess in 1617, and was\r\nChamberlain from 1621 to 1623. His accounts for the latter year are\r\nheaded by a French proverb, as to the happiness of those who become wise\r\nthrough the experience of others, that might have had an opposite\r\nmeaning to his contemporaries. It shows us that he could not only read\r\nand write English, but at least a little French. By 1630 he was involved\r\nin lawsuits, left the town council, and tried to dispose of the lease of\r\nhis house. In 1633 Dr. Hall and Thomas Nash acted as trustees for his\r\nestate. His fortunes seemed to have become worse and worse. In 1652 he\r\nwent to the Metropolis, where his elder brother Richard was a thriving\r\ngrocer in Bucklersbury, in company with Roger Sadler. Richard, in\r\nAugust, 1655,[185] made a will, in which he left, besides handsome\r\nprovision for his children--Richard, Adrian, Thomas, William and\r\nSarah--his brother Thomas £12 a year for life, and £5 for the expenses\r\nof his funeral, out of his messuages at Shottery. The Quiney coat of\r\narms is entered among those of the London burgesses at Guildhall,[186]\r\n\"Mr. Quiney of ye Red Lyon in Bucklersbury.\"\r\n\r\nThe family of Thomas Quiney and his wife Judith was not a large one. In\r\nthe year that the poet died they christened their eldest son, \"Shaksper,\r\nfilius Thomas Quyny gent.,\" November 23, 1616. But the child died in a\r\nfew months. On May 8, 1617, was buried \"Shakespere, filius Thomas Quyny,\r\ngent.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 9, 1617-18, \"Richard filius Thomas Quinee\" was baptized, and\r\non January 23, 1619-20, \"Thomas, filius Thomas Queeny.\" These lads may\r\nhave followed to the grave their grandmother, Mrs. Shakespeare, and\r\ntheir uncle, Dr. Hall; and they may have been present at the marriage of\r\ntheir cousin, Mrs. Elizabeth Hall, to Mr. Thomas Nash. But they died\r\nwithin a month of each other, probably of some infectious fever, the\r\nyounger first--\"Thomas filius Thomæ Quiney, Jan. 28th, 1638-9\";\r\n\"Richardus filius Tho. Quiney, Feb. 26th, 1638-9.\" There were no other\r\nchildren, and no prospect of more, and these early deaths affected the\r\ndevolution of the poet's property, as may hereafter be seen.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we know nothing concerning Dr. John Hall before his\r\nmarriage to the poet's elder daughter Susanna on June 5, 1607, he being\r\nthen thirty-two and she twenty-five. He cannot have been the son of Dr.\r\nJohn Hall, of Maidstone, Kent, whose translation of Lanfranc's\r\n\"Chirurgerie,\" with portrait of the translator, appeared in 1565. He\r\nwould have been an eminently suitable father, distinguished alike in his\r\nart and his character, author of \"The Court of Virtue,\" and many\r\nmetrical Bible translations; but he died in 1566, and the Stratford Dr.\r\nJohn Hall was born in 1575. Halliwell-Phillipps[187] suggests that he\r\nmay have been connected with the Halls of Acton, Middlesex, because he\r\nleft his only daughter his \"house and meadow at Acton.\" A John Hall was\r\nmarried in that parish, it is true, on September 19, 1574,[188] to\r\nMargaret Archer. But he had a daughter Elizabeth christened on June 5,\r\n1575, about the very date at which the Stratford \"John\" must have been\r\nborn. Any connection, therefore, must have been further off than filial,\r\nand the name is too common to be easily followed.\r\n\r\nThere were Halls in Worcester,[189] in Rowington, and in Coventry, and\r\nit may be remembered that a John Hall supplanted Richard Shakespeare as\r\nBailiff of the Priory of Wroxall during the last year of its existence.\r\nThere was a Richard Hall of Stratford in the list of the gentry 12 Henry\r\nVI., 1433. There was also a Richard Hall, gentleman,[190] of Idlicote,\r\nin the sixteenth century, who seems to have moved about a good deal, as\r\nthere is a record of \"Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Hall, Generosus,\r\nbapt. February 14th, 1560,\" at Idlicote, and of \"Maria filia Richardi\r\nHall, Generosus, March 17th, 1561,\" in Stratford. I have not traced any\r\nof the name of John christened in Idlicote or elsewhere at the date.\r\n\r\nThe Idlicote Halls were suspected recusants, as may be proved by the\r\nsearch made in their house when Edward Arden was dragged away from Park\r\nHall in 1583.[191] There was a \"Mr. Hall\" Alderman of Stratford 1558,\r\nand in 1575 Edmund Hall and Emma his wife sold two messuages to John\r\nShakespeare. Were they contemplating going abroad at the time? They are\r\nnot further referred to in Stratford records. In a manuscript of the\r\nBritish Museum a table is sketched of the Halls of Henwick in Hallow.\r\nJohn Hall of Henwick had a son Thomas, who married, first, Anne,\r\ndaughter of William Staple, and, second, a daughter of Hardwick. He had\r\nat least two sons, John, who married Margaret, daughter of William\r\nGrovelight, of London, and Edmund, who married Emma, daughter of\r\n----(?). John had Edward, Anne, Elizabeth, and Emma, and the descendants\r\nof Edmund are not entered.[192] Catholicism might have been a reason for\r\nrealizing their property and going abroad.\r\n\r\nNow, John Hall expressly calls himself a Master of Arts, though his name\r\nis not recorded in the Books of the English Universities. He would not\r\nhave done so had he not taken his degree. It possibly might have been in\r\nParis, and he might have followed it up with foreign study. This would\r\nquite accord with his appearance in Stratford after the death of\r\nElizabeth. A Warwickshire gentle origin[193] may somewhat account for\r\nthe degree of intimacy he seems to have had with the county families,\r\nboth Puritan and Catholic. His fame as a physician rapidly spread. He\r\nresided in a house in Old Town, on the way from the church to the\r\nchapel. His only daughter, Elizabeth, was baptized at Stratford on\r\nFebruary 21, 1607-8,[194] during her grandfather's (William\r\nShakespeare's) life. His name occurs in the town records in 1611,[195]\r\namong the supporters to a Highway Bill, and he leased from the\r\nCorporation a small stretch of wooded land on the outskirts of the town\r\nin 1612. He must have remained on friendly terms with his father-in-law,\r\nas he and his wife Susanna were left residuary legatees and executors of\r\nShakespeare's will, which he proved in June of that year, in the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury's Registry at London.\r\n\r\nHe shortly afterwards moved to New Place, beside his mother-in-law,\r\nwhere the vestry notes of February 3, 1617-1618, record him as resident.\r\nHe was elected a Burgess of Stratford in 1617, and again in 1623, but\r\nwas excused from taking office on account of his professional\r\nengagements. On April 22, 1626, Mr. Thomas Nash married his daughter,\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Hall. Hall gave the church a costly new pulpit, and in\r\n1628 was appointed a borough churchwarden, in 1629 a sidesman, and in\r\n1632 was compelled to become a burgess, and was soon after fined for\r\nnon-attendance at the council meetings.\r\n\r\nIn 1633 he was made the Vicar's churchwarden, and in that year the\r\nVicar, Thomas Wilson, induced him to join in a Chancery action against\r\nthe town. He was already in trouble with his fellow councillors, who in\r\nOctober of that year expelled him for his \"breach of orders, sundry\r\nother misdemeanours, and for his continual disturbance at our Halles.\"\r\nEvidently Dr. John had opinions of his own, and had the courage to\r\nexpress them. He was a deeply religious man, and, though he has been\r\nsupposed to have shown Puritan tendencies in later life, it was a\r\nPuritanism that did not eschew Catholicism. His was a religion of\r\nconstant reference to the Unseen. He was always a helper of those in\r\ntrouble for conscience' sake; and probably this was the reason he\r\nsupported the unpopular Vicar.\r\n\r\nShortly after, in 1635, there was a petition sent up from the\r\nCorporation of Stratford for their wives to have the pew in Stratford\r\nChurch occupied by Dr. Hall, his wife, and his son-in-law and his wife.\r\nEach family had a pew at each side of the church, while there was not\r\nroom for the burgesses' wives to sit or kneel in. It was true that the\r\nsaid Mr. Hall had been a great benefactor to the church, and the Bishop\r\nof the diocese had appointed him his pew; but his family were asked to\r\nchoose which of their large pews they preferred to keep, along with Mrs.\r\nWoodward and Mrs. Lane, so that they might allow the aldermen's wives to\r\nhave the other.\r\n\r\nJohn Hall died on November 25, 1635, and was buried next day in the\r\nchancel of the parish church, though he had already disposed of the\r\nlease of the tithes purchased by his father-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe burial register of the next day describes him as \"Medicus\r\nPeritissimus.\" By a nuncupative will, he left a house in London to his\r\nwife, a house in Acton and a meadow to his daughter Elizabeth, and his\r\nstudy of books to his son-in-law Thomas Nash. The manuscripts he would\r\nhave given to Mr. Boles had he been present, but Nash was to keep them\r\nand use them as he pleased. It is probable that Mr. Boles was Richard\r\nBoles, Rector of Whitnash, not far from Stratford--an eccentric person,\r\na writer of epitaphs, who had set up his own in his church while he yet\r\nlived.[196]\r\n\r\nOn the monumental slab of Dr. Hall is a shield of arms: \"Sable, three\r\ntalbots' heads erased or\" for Hall, impaling Shakespeare or on a bend\r\n\"sable, a spear of the first, the point steeled.\" \"Here lyeth ye Body of\r\nJohn Hall, gent: Hee marr: Susanna ye daughter and coheire of Will:\r\nShakespeare, gent., Hee deceased Nov^r 25, Anno 1635, aged 60.\r\n\r\n    \"Hallius sic situs est, medica celeberrimus arte\r\n      Expectans regni Gaudia læta Dei;\r\n    Dignus erat meritis qui nestora vinceret annis,\r\n      In terris omnes, sed capit æqua dies;\r\n    Ne tumulo quid desit adest fidessima conjux\r\n      Est vitæ comitem nunc quoq. mortis habet.\"[197]\r\n\r\nIt has been thought that this proves the epitaph was not written until\r\nafter Mrs. Hall's death. She may have wished the words set up, to\r\ndetermine her resting-place; or Mr. Boles may have helped Thomas Nash\r\nwith the Latin.\r\n\r\nAfter his death his son-in-law, Thomas Nash, came to reside at New\r\nPlace, and took the position of head of the family. Indeed, in one of\r\nhis letters he speaks of \"Mrs. Hall, my mother-in-law, who lives with\r\nme.\" But the house and everything in it, saving the study of books,\r\nbelonged to Mrs. Hall, of course.\r\n\r\nWe know nothing of the nature or the fate of the bulk of these\r\nmanuscripts, though many have longed to trace them. Possibly among them,\r\nthough it is not likely (being in bound volumes) were two notebooks of\r\nDr. John Hall's observations, from which James Cooke, a physician\r\nintroduced later to Mrs. Hall, translated the materials for a little\r\nbook entitled, \"Select Observations on English Bodies; or, Cures both\r\nEmpericall and Historicall Performed on very Eminent Persons in\r\nDesperate Diseases, first written in Latine by Mr. John Hall, Physician\r\nliving at Stratford-on-Avon in Warwickshire where he was very famous, as\r\nalso in the counties adjacent, as appears by these observations, drawn\r\nout of severall hundreds of his as choycest, now put into English for\r\ncommon benefit by James Cooke, practitioner in Physick and Surgery,\r\n1657.\" Cooke, in the introduction, relates the strange manner in which\r\nhe became possessed of them, Mrs. Hall not knowing they were in her\r\nhusband's handwriting, and, believing they were part of a poor scholar's\r\nmortgage, transferred them to him with other books. Cooke used the books\r\nas guides in his own practice, and then expanded the contractions,\r\ntranslated and published them, \"being acquainted with his apothecary.\"\r\nIt is no slight compliment to a physician to have his cures published\r\ntwenty-two years after his death, and to have them run through more than\r\none edition. Cooke mentions: \"Mr. John Hall had the happiness to lead\r\nthe way to that practice almost generally used now by the most knowing\r\nof mixing scorbutics to most remedies.\" It is to Cooke we owe\r\ninformation concerning Hall's education abroad; concerning the\r\nphysician, his relative, on terms of intimacy with Mrs. Hall, who\r\nintroduced him to New Place; and concerning the \"other book\" of Dr. John\r\nHall, also prepared for the press. We wonder what it contained.\r\n\r\nThe book published by Cooke records only _cures_. We are inclined to\r\necho, \"Where are they that were drowned?\" Doubtless Hall had attended\r\nhis father-in-law in his last illness, but his skill and affection were\r\nnot sufficient to save him. And because of this failure, we do not know\r\nthe symptoms shown by the poet after the traditional \"merrymaking with\r\nBen Jonson and Drayton,\" when later gossips say he \"drank too much.\" The\r\nearliest _dated_ cure is 1617. But is it too much to imagine that the\r\nundated illness of Drayton, recorded in \"Obs. XXII.,\" occurred at the\r\nsame time as the death of the poet? Was he at any later time ill in\r\nWarwickshire, and likely to be attended by Dr. John Hall? \"Mr. Drayton,\r\nan excellent poet, labouring of a Tertian, was cured by the following\r\ntreatment.\" Let us suppose it was April, 1616, and it may account for\r\nthe poet's illness, otherwise than by over-drinking.\r\n\r\nIn \"Obs. XIX.\" Hall mentions without date an illness of his wife, Mrs.\r\nHall. \"Obs. XXXVI.\" concerns his only daughter, and supports my opinion\r\nof a constitutional delicacy of Anne Hathaway and her family. It is not\r\ninsignificant that her grandchild should suffer from \"tortura oris,\" or\r\nconvulsions of the mouth, and ophthalmia. She was cured of one attack on\r\nJanuary 5, 1624. In the beginning of April she went to London, and on\r\nreturning on the 22nd of the same month, she took cold, and fell into\r\nthe same distemper, which affected the other side of her face. This\r\nsecond time, \"By the blessing of God, she was cured in sixteen days.\"\r\nBut on May 24 of the same year she was struck down with an erratic\r\nfever. Sometimes she was hot, by-and-by sweating, again cold, all in the\r\nspace of half an hour. Her father's treatment again healed her; \"the\r\nsymptoms remitted daily till she was well, thus was she delivered from\r\ndeath and deadly diseases, and was well for many years.\" Many other\r\nfamiliar names occur in this volume--\"Mrs. Queeny,\" Mrs. Smith, Mr.\r\nWilson, Mrs. Throgmorton, Mrs. Sheldon, Mrs. Greene, John Nason, the\r\nUnderhills, Mrs. Baker, Dr. Thornbery, Bishop of Worcester (aged\r\neighty-six on February 1, 1633), Mrs. Combe, Katherine Sturley, \"Mrs.\r\nGrace Court, wife to my apothecary.\" In \"Obs. LXIV.\" he speaks of\r\ntreating \"the only son of Mr. Holyoake, which framed the dictionary.\"\r\n\"Obs. LXXXII.,\" Book II., records the restoration from the gates of\r\ndeath of Mr. John Trapp, minister; and Obs. \"LX.,\" Book II., gives an\r\naccount of Hall's own dangerous illness in 1632, when his anxious wife\r\nsent for two physicians, who pulled him through; and he records his\r\nprayer to God on the occasion. We must not forget that this was the date\r\nof his quarrel with the Corporation.\r\n\r\nThe death of the young Quineys in 1638-39 affected the details of the\r\npoet's will; for it may be remembered the property was settled on\r\nSusanna Hall and her heirs male, failing whom, on the heirs male of\r\nElizabeth Hall, failing whom, on the heirs male of Judith, in default of\r\nsuch heirs male, on the right heirs of William Shakespeare for ever. The\r\nfailure in the heirs male of Judith therefore entitled Elizabeth Nash to\r\nthe full inheritance as heir-general, and within a few weeks after the\r\nunexpected death of her cousins, Susanna Hall, widow, joined with Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Nash, May 27, 1639, in making a new settlement of Shakespeare's\r\nentails on Mrs. Hall for life, after whom on Mr. and Mrs. Nash, and _the\r\nlonger liver of them_, after them, to the heirs of their body, and in\r\ndefault of such, to the heirs of the said Elizabeth. Should she die\r\nfirst without heirs, the property was secured to the _heirs and assignes\r\nof the said Thomas Nash_, a reversion certainly not fair to Joan Hart,\r\nthe poet's sister, and her children. Still, it all seemed too far off to\r\nconsider. To this document Mrs. Hall appended her signature and her\r\nseal, with the arms of Shakespeare impaled with those of Hall.\r\n\r\nThomas Nash seemed to have believed this fully settled everything on\r\nhimself, and that he was likely to outlive his mother-in-law and his\r\nwife, for on August 20, 1642, he executed, without his wife's sanction\r\nor knowledge, a mysterious will, that afterwards led to trouble.\r\n\r\nThe importance of New Place, the largest house in the town, and the\r\nliberality and loyalty of its owners, were curiously signalized in the\r\nfollowing year. Queen Henrietta Maria, in July, 1643, marched from\r\nNewark to Kineton by way of Stratford, where she was reinforced by\r\nPrince Rupert and 2,000 men. She held her court for three days[198] in\r\nShakespeare's house, probably accompanied by only her immediate personal\r\nattendants. On July 13, the Queen and Prince Rupert moved off to meet\r\nthe King in the vale of Kineton near Edgehill.[199]\r\n\r\nThomas Nash died on April 4, 1647, and was buried in the chancel beside\r\nShakespeare. \"Heere resteth ye body of Thomas Nashe Esq. He mar.\r\nElizabeth, the daug. and Heire of John Halle, gent. He died Aprill 4, A.\r\n1647. Aged 53.\r\n\r\n    \"Fata manent omnes, hunc non virtute carentem\r\n      ut neque divitiis, abstulit atra dies\r\n    Abstulit at referet lux ultima; siste, viator,\r\n      si peritura paras per male parta peris.\"\r\n\r\nThe coat of arms was double quarterly of four, First, 1 and 4 argent on\r\na chevron between three ravens' heads erased azure, a pellet between 4\r\ncross-crosslets sable, for Nash; 2 and 3 sable a buck's head caboshed\r\nargent attired or, between his horns a cross patée, and across his mouth\r\nan arrow, Bulstrode. Second, 1 and 4, for Hall, 2 and 3 Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nWhen the notable will was opened, and proved in the following June, the\r\nwidow declined to follow out its provisions as concerned her own\r\nproperty, which Thomas Nash had treated as if entirely his own. \"Item, I\r\ngive, dispose and bequeath, unto my Kinsman Edward Nash, and to his\r\nheires and assignes for ever, one messuage or tenement with the\r\nappurtenances comonly called or knowne by the name of The New Place ...\r\ntogether with all and singular howses, outhowses, barnes, stables,\r\norchards, gardens, etc, esteemed or enjoyed as thereto belonging ...\r\nalso fower yards of arable land meadowe and pasture ... in old\r\nStratford, and also one other tenement with the appurtenances in the\r\nparish of ---- London; called or known by the name of the Wardropp, and\r\nnow in the tenure of one ---- Dickes.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Nash had soldiers quartered on her at New Place during the very\r\nmonth of her husband's death, one of whom was implicated in the robbery\r\nof deer from the park of Sir Greville Verney on April 30, 1647. But she\r\ndid not fail in legal knowledge of what she ought to do under the\r\nunexpected provisions of her husband's will, of which she was left sole\r\nexecutrix and residuary legatee. She and her mother combined in levying\r\na fine on the property,[200] and reconveying it to the sole use of her\r\nmother and herself, and their heirs for ever. She was not yet\r\nthirty-nine years of age, and did not feel inclined even then to take it\r\nfor granted she would not marry again, even if Edward Nash agreed, as he\r\ncould be made to agree, that his inheritance could only come to him on\r\nher decease without issue.\r\n\r\nBut Edward Nash did not like her proceedings, and filed a Bill in\r\nChancery on February, 1647-48, against Elizabeth Nash, and other\r\nlegatees, to compel them to produce his uncle's will in court, and\r\nexecute its provisions. Mrs. Nash admitted its contents, but averred the\r\ntestator had no power to demise property which had belonged to her\r\ngrandfather, and had been left to herself. She explained that her mother\r\nwas still living, and that in conjunction they had levied the fine. She\r\nonly disputed that part of her husband's will concerning her own\r\nproperty, and mentioned her deeds and evidences. Her answer was taken by\r\ncommission, at Stratford, in April, 1648, and in June it was ordered\r\nthat the defendants should bring into court the will and other\r\nevidences, and the writ was personally served on Mrs. Nash.\r\n\r\nThe will of Thomas Nash was produced before the Examiners in Chancery in\r\nNovember, but Mrs. Nash defied all orders concerning the other\r\n\"evidences,\" as may be seen from the affidavit filed at the Six Clerks'\r\nOffice in December, 1649. She was brave in her determination that her\r\nown rights and her mother's should not be assailed, and she was perhaps\r\nprudent in her opinion that the fewer papers that were produced the\r\nshorter time would the suit last. No replication or decree is recorded.\r\nThe litigation apparently terminated in a compromise, doubtless hastened\r\nby Mrs. Nash's second marriage. Perhaps Edward Nash by this time\r\nrealized the injustice or the impracticability of his claim. The only\r\nfurther allusion to it occurs in Lady Barnard's will.[201] She directs\r\nher trustees to dispose of New Place with the proviso \"that my loving\r\ncousin, Edward Nash, Esq., shall have the first offer or refusal\r\nthereof, according to _my promise formerly made to him_.\"\r\n\r\nElizabeth Nash married Mr. John Barnard, of Abington, Northamptonshire,\r\nat Billesley, a village four miles from Stratford, June 5, 1649, where\r\nthe Trussels resided. Why did she go there to be married? A puzzling\r\nquestion indeed, which cannot be answered by the register, as it is\r\nlost. Whether her marriage weakened her mother's health, or whether the\r\nstate of her mother's health had hastened her marriage, we know not; but\r\na month later, on July 11, 1649, Mrs. Hall died, and, being buried\r\nbeside her husband on the 16th, _made his tomb complete_. The Latin\r\nscholars of the family were all gone, and it is not too much to suppose\r\nthat Elizabeth herself, Shakespeare's grandchild, composed her mother's\r\nepitaph:\r\n\r\n\"Here lyeth the body of Susanna, wife of John Hall, gent., the daughter\r\nof William Shakespeare, gent. She deceased the 11 day of July, Anno\r\n1649, aged 66.\r\n\r\n    \"Witty above her sex, but that's not all,\r\n    Wise to Salvation was good Mistress Hall,\r\n    Something of Shakespeare was in that, but this\r\n    Wholly of him with whom she's now in blisse.\r\n      Then, passenger, hast nere a tear\r\n        To weep with her that wept with all\r\n      That wept, yet set herself to chere\r\n        Them up with comforts cordiall?\r\n      Her love shall live, her mercy spread\r\n      When thou hast nere a tear to shed.\"\r\n\r\nA lozenge bore the arms of Hall and Shakespeare impaled. In the early\r\npart of last century these verses were erased to make space for the\r\nrecord of the death of one Richard Watts, who owned some of the tithes\r\nand had the right to be buried in the chancel. But they, fortunately,\r\nhad been preserved by Dugdale;[202] and in 1844 the Watts record was\r\nerased and Mrs. Hall's verses restored.\r\n\r\nHer death limited Shakespeare's descendants to two--Judith Quiney,\r\ndaughter, and Elizabeth Barnard, granddaughter. A fine was levied on New\r\nPlace in 1650, in which John Barnard and Henry Smith were made trustees\r\nto the settlement of 1647, instead of Richard Lane and William Smith. In\r\n1652 a new settlement was made, devising it to the use of John Barnard\r\nand his wife, and the longer liver of them, to the heirs of the body of\r\nElizabeth, failing whom to any persons she might name. In default of\r\nsuch nomination, the property was to go to the right heirs of the\r\nsurvivor. A fine was again levied on this settlement. Mr. John Barnard\r\nwas knighted by Charles II. in 1661. The Stratford Register of 1661-62\r\nrecords the death of Elizabeth's aunt, Judith, \"uxor Thomas Quiney,\r\ngent., Feb. 9th, 1661-2.\" The use of the word \"uxor\" is no certain proof\r\nthat he was alive at the time.\r\n\r\nJudith's death, at the age of seventy-seven, left Lady Elizabeth Barnard\r\nthe poet's sole survivor. She had no children by her second marriage,\r\nabout which we have no other detail. It has been surmised that it was\r\nnot a happy one. Sir John Barnard was a widower, and had already a\r\nfamily. There is no mention of this family in Lady Barnard's will, and a\r\nlimitation to the barest law and justice towards her husband, whom she\r\ndid not leave her executor. The will was drawn up on January 29,\r\n1669-70, and she died at Abington in February. \"Madam Elizabeth Bernard,\r\nwife of Sir John Bernard, Knight, was buried 17th Feb., 1669-70.\"[203]\r\nNo sepulchral monument was raised in memory of the granddaughter and\r\nheir of Shakespeare, but she probably lay in the same tomb as her\r\nhusband, who died in 1674. A memorial slab still remains to his memory\r\nin Abington Church, but the place of his burial is unknown, and the\r\nvault below this stone is used by another family.\r\n\r\nBy his death his wife's will[204] came into force, written while she was\r\nstill \"in perfect memory--blessed be God!--and mindful of mortality.\"\r\nShe recounted the settlement of April 18, 1653, to which the trustees\r\nwere Henry Smith, of Stratford, gent., and Job Dighton, of the Middle\r\nTemple, London, Esquire. Henry Smith, her surviving trustee, or his\r\nheirs, six months after the death of her husband, Sir John Barnard, was\r\nto sell New Place, giving the first offer to her loving cousin, Edward\r\nNash, and the money was to be used in legacies. Her cousin, Thomas\r\nWelles, of Carleton, in county Bedford, was to have £50 if he be alive,\r\nand if he be dead, her kinsman, Edward Bagley, citizen of London, was to\r\nreceive the amount. How she was connected with these men I have been\r\nunable to find out. \"Judith Hathaway, one of the daughters of my\r\nkinsman, Thomas Hathaway, late of Stratford,\" £5 a year or £40 in hand.\r\nUnto Joane, the wife of Edward Kent, another daughter of the said Thomas\r\nHathaway, £50, failing whom to her heir, _Edward Kent the younger_, at\r\nhis coming of age. To this same Edward Kent she left £30 for his\r\napprenticeship. To Rose, Elizabeth, and Susanna, three other \"daughters\r\nof my kinsman, Thomas Hathaway, £40 a piece.\" Henry Smith was to have £5\r\nfor his pains, and Edward Bagley to be residuary legatee. \"To my\r\nkinsman, Thomas Hart, the son of Thomas Hart, late of Stratford, all\r\nthat my other messuage or Inne commonly called the Maydenhead, with the\r\nnext house thereto adjoining, with the barne belonging to the same, now\r\nin the occupation of Michael Johnson; to Thomas Hart and his heirs,\r\nfailing whom to his brother George Hart and his heirs,\" failing whom to\r\nher own right heirs for ever. She made her \"loving kinsman Edward\r\nBagley\" executor, \"in witness of which I set my hand and seal.\" It may\r\nbe seen that she retained absolute power of the poet's purchases, but\r\njustly left his inheritance from his father John to his sister's\r\ndescendants. But she did no more than justice.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear how the connection is traced between her and her other\r\nlegatees, but it is very noticeable her preference for the Hathaway\r\nconnections to those of the Shakespeare side.\r\n\r\nEre she died the poet's Blackfriars tenement had been reduced to ashes\r\nin the Great Fire of 1666. What right in it or its site remained,\r\naccrued to Edward Bagley, \"citizen of London,\" her executor and\r\nresiduary legatee, who proved her will, March 4, 1669, though it is\r\nstated to have been sold in Shakespeare's Biography in the Dictionary.\r\n\r\nEdward Nash did not buy New Place, after all. It was bought by Sir\r\nEdward Walker, at one time Secretary of War to Charles I., and then\r\nGarter King-at-Arms. Halliwell-Phillipps states[205] it was sold by the\r\n\"surviving trustee,\" but Sir Edward Walker's own will[206] puts it a\r\nlittle differently. He left to his dear daughter Barbara, wife of Sir\r\nJohn Clopton, various bequests, among which appear \"A yarde land in\r\nStratford field I bought of _Mr. Hall_, of the value of £12 10s. by year\r\n... fyftly Land I bought of Sir John Clopton in the mannor of Clopton,\r\nof the yearely value of £10. Sixtly 4 yard land lying in Stratford and\r\nBishopton fields which I bought of _Mr. Bagley_, and a house called the\r\nNew Place, situated in the Towne of Stratford upon Avon, of the yearely\r\nvalue about fyfty fyve pounds ... my deare daughter and her husband Sir\r\nJohn Clopton, sole executors, 30th June, 1676.\" He died early the\r\nfollowing year, and his will was proved March 10, 1676-77.\r\n\r\nThus, the property Shakespeare had put together became dispersed shortly\r\nafter his family became extinct, and New Place came back to the heirs of\r\nthe Cloptons, from whom it was purchased. I had hoped we might find\r\nsomething from the will of Edward Bagley, but he died intestate,[207]\r\nand the administration mentions nothing of interest to Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore quite clear that the whole period covered by\r\nShakespeare's life and that of his descendants was 105 years, _i.e._,\r\nfrom 1564 to 1669, and that _no lineal descendants can survive_. Yet, as\r\nif in illustration of the methods of fabrication of tradition, when it\r\nis desired, I have heard of many of the name who boast a _lineal descent\r\nfrom the poet_; and of one even who boasts of having inherited not only\r\n_the Shakespeare's_ dinner-service, but his _teapot_! Yet that the\r\npresence of the name is a certain bar to the descent, as above shown, no\r\nsuch claimants seem to have taken the trouble to find out, as they\r\neasily might do. I am told that in Verona, by the tomb of Romeo and\r\nJuliet, a modern visitor has described himself as \"Shakespeare,\r\n_descendant_ of the poet who wrote the play.\" William Shakespeare's\r\npoems alone are his posterity.\r\n\r\nEven under another name they are not to be accepted.[208] In the\r\n_Cambridge Chronicle_ obituary, January 1, 1842, appears: \"Died on the\r\n28th ult. at Exning, Suffolk, aged 87, Mrs. Hammond, mother of Mr. Wm.\r\nHammond, of No. 8, Scots Yard, Cannon Street, London, Indigo Merchant.\r\nThe deceased was one of the few remaining descendants of Shakespeare.\"\r\nSo lately as June, 1857, there was recorded the death of William\r\nHammond, Esq., of London, \"one of the last lineal descendants of\r\nShakespeare.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Bigsby says that Colonel Gardner, descendant of the Barnards, had\r\nsome Shakespeare letters, and claimed descent from Lady Elizabeth\r\nBarnard.[209]\r\n\r\nA correspondent remembered to have seen when a boy the Shakespear Inn,\r\nLower Northgate Street, Gloucester, kept by an old gentleman named\r\nSmith. Outside the passage to the inn was a signboard, \"The Shakespear\r\nInn, by William Smith, descendant from and next of kin to that immortal\r\nbard.\"[210]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   JOHN SHAKESPEARE'S FAMILY.\r\n\r\n                          Richard Shakespeare, = wife uncertain,\r\n       farmer, of Snitterfield, held land from |\r\n       Robert Arden, Mary Arden's father.      |\r\n                                               |\r\n       -------------------------------------------------\r\n       |                  |                            |\r\n     Thomas.

But she had no\r\nchildren, as proved both by the registers and the wills. She was Sir\r\nJohn Barnard's second wife.\r\n\r\n[210] _Ibid._, 519. Smith really descended from the Harts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCOLLATERALS\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Shakespeare had other sons than William. There were three--Gilbert,\r\nRichard and Edmund. These all died comparatively young, and none of them\r\nwas married.\r\n\r\nEdmund, the youngest child of John and Mary Shakespeare, seems to have\r\nbeen the only one who followed his eldest brother to London. He also\r\nchose the stage as a profession, but we never hear of any success. From\r\nLondon registers we know that on August 12, 1607, in the parish of St.\r\nGiles', Cripplegate, was buried \"Edward, the base-born son of Edward\r\nShakespeare, Player,\" and that on December 31 of the same year was\r\nburied within the Church of St. Saviour's, Southwark,[211] \"Edmund\r\nShakespeare, Player,\" \"with a forenoon knell of the Great Bell.\"[212]\r\nThe poet paid every honour he could to his brother.\r\n\r\nGilbert, born two and a half years after William, seemed often to have\r\nbeen his practical helper and representative in Stratford-on-Avon. Some\r\nwriters have imagined that because the clerk added the word \"adolescens\"\r\nto the burial entry in 1611 of \"Gilbert Shakespeare,\"[213] that it could\r\nnot have been this Gilbert, but some other, probably a young son of his.\r\nBut there is no record of a marriage, of the birth of any child, of the\r\ndeath of his wife, or of his own death, if this entry be given another\r\ntranslation than the natural one. We may well imagine the clerk did not\r\nfully understand the meaning of the word. Shakespeare often satirizes\r\nthe ignorant use of learned terms at his time. There is no saying what\r\nhazy notions might have floated through the writer's brain of the age or\r\nposition of the defunct. He would be no worse than a Mrs. Malaprop if he\r\nintended \"adolescens\" to represent \"deeply regretted.\"\r\n\r\nOf the last surviving brother, Richard, born 1573, we know nothing,\r\nexcept that he died February 12, in the year 1612-13.[214]\r\n\r\nThe negative evidence of the registers is supported by the negative\r\nevidence of the Shakespeare wills; there is no mention of a Shakespeare\r\nin the wills of William Shakespeare (so anxious to perpetuate his family\r\nand his name) or in those of his descendants.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore hold it as proved that there are no collateral lines of\r\nShakespeares descending from the poet's brothers, and therefore none\r\nentitled to bear John Shakespeare's famous coat of arms without a new\r\ngrant. Yet we find some bearing the arms, and many claimants of such\r\ndescent. Sir Thomas Winnington asks if the Shaksperes of Fillongly are a\r\nbranch of the poet's family, as the well-known armorial bearings appear\r\non the tomb of George Shakespeare, who died there in 1690.[215]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Mr. Dyer wrote to Mr. Duncombe from Coningsby, November 24,\r\n1756: \"My wife's name was Ensor, whose grandmother was a Shakespeare,\r\ndescended from the brother of everybody's Shakespeare.\"[216] Such claims\r\nmay be explained by a natural error. Another John Shakespeare has often\r\nbeen mistaken for ours, and real pedigrees have been traced back to him.\r\n\r\nBut there _were_ collateral descents from Shakespeare's sister. The only\r\nperson who might have impaled the new Shakespeare arms, had he himself\r\nborne arms to make this possible, was William Hart, the hatter, who\r\nmarried Shakespeare's sister Joan, and who lived in Shakespeare's old\r\nhouse in Henley Street, and died a few days before the poet.[217] The\r\npedigree of the Harts is printed in French's \"Shakespeareana\r\nGenealogica,\"[218] and need not be repeated here. The Rev. Cornelius\r\nHallen[219] also gives a genealogical table of the various connections,\r\nand thus provides us with the collateral descent nearly up to date.\r\n\r\nThough the early members of this family seem to have been content with a\r\nvery modest position and very unromantic occupations, the later members\r\nhave become more ambitious.\r\n\r\nThe Harts thought of contesting the will of Lady Barnard, who, with her\r\nmother, Mrs. Hall, had cut off the entail, or rather altered, as they\r\nthought, the proviso of Shakespeare's will regarding his heirs. But, as\r\nshe left them the Henley Street house, and a contest for more would have\r\nbeen attended with certain expense and uncertain results, they on full\r\nconsideration let the matter drop.\r\n\r\nEven from this family sprang claimants for lineal descent. On a\r\ntombstone in Tewkesbury appears: \"In Memory of John Hart, the sixth\r\ndescendant from the poet Shakespeare, who died January 22, 1800, aged\r\n45,\" etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNITTERFIELD CHURCH.\r\n\r\n_To face p. 113_]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[211] Registers of St. Saviour's, Southwark.\r\n\r\n[212] Churchwardens' Accounts, St. Saviour's, Southwark.\r\n\r\n[213] Stratford-on-Avon Registers.\r\n\r\n[214] Stratford-on-Avon Registers.\r\n\r\n[215] _Notes and Queries_ December, 1865, Third Series, viii. 501.\r\n\r\n[216] _Ibid._, Sixth Series, xii. 424.\r\n\r\n[217] April 17, 1616.\r\n\r\n[218] P. 296.\r\n\r\n[219] See \"Descent of Hallen and Shakespeare.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nCOUSINS AND CONNECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is certain that Shakespeare had many cousins on the Arden side. A\r\nnotice of the Stringers, the Lamberts, the Edkins, and the Webbes has\r\nbeen already given. The Hart family, as has also been noticed, provided\r\na large number of relatives not of the name.\r\n\r\nOn the Shakespeare side the poet _may_ have had cousins, though we are\r\nnot able to prove their descent from records at present in hand. More\r\nthan one family claim to have descended from cousins, and presumably\r\nfrom Shakespeare's grandfather Richard. But we must not forget there\r\nwere other Richards at his time. The Richard of Wroxall, Mr. Yeatman\r\ninsists, must be the same as the Richard of Snitterfield, though it\r\nseems hardly possible, seeing we find the one officially associated with\r\nthe Priory of Wroxall 26 Henry VIII., 1535,[220] and the other presented\r\nfor non-suit of court at Snitterfield 20 and 22 Henry VIII.; for\r\ninfringing the rights of pasture there, October 1, 1535; and receiving a\r\nlegacy from a friend that suggested continued residence: \"Unto Richard\r\nShakespere of Snytfield my foure oxen which are now in his keeping\"\r\n(will of Thomas Atwode, _alias_ Tailor, of Stratford-on-Avon, 1543).\r\nThree successive Richards lived in Rowington. One, \"Richard Shakysspere,\r\nof Rowington, Weyver,\" died in 1560, and mentioned his sons William and\r\nRichard in his will drawn up the year before, on June 15, and proved on\r\nJune 30 (goods prised by John Shakspere and Richard Sanders). Another\r\nRichard of the same place made a will in 1591 and died in 1592, whose\r\nchildren were John, Roger, Thomas, William, and Dorothy Jenkes; his\r\nwife's name was Joan. There was also a grandson, Thomas, son of\r\nJohn.[221] Another Richard died in 1614,[222] whose eldest son was\r\nWilliam. But each of these Richards, from his family and connections,\r\ncan be proved to be a different man from the Richard of Snitterfield. We\r\nare reasonably sure that our John was the son of the latter, if he\r\nadministered his goods after his death in 1560-61[223]; and if so, we\r\nare sure that Henry also was his son, as Henry was the brother of John.\r\nThis is mentioned in the Declaration of 1587,[224] when Nicholas Lane\r\nproceeded against John as surety for his impecunious brother Henry.\r\nHenry was also summoned with John to appear as witness in the Mayowe and\r\nWebbe case, 23 Elizabeth. He had a wife called Margaret, whose death\r\nimmediately follows his own in the Register of Snitterfield;[225] but we\r\nare not sure that he had any children. \"Henry Sakspere was buryed the\r\n29th day of Dec., 1596.\" \"Margaret Sakspere, widow, being tymes the wyff\r\nof Henry Sakspere, was bured ix Feb., 1596.\" It is quite probable that\r\nwhen Robert Webbe married and settled in Snitterfield, or Edward\r\nCornwall came into power there, that Henry moved thence.[226] Just about\r\nthe time we find in the Registers of Hampton-on-Avon or Bishop Hampton,\r\n\"Lettyce, daughter of Henry Shakespeare of Ingon,[227] bapt. June 4th,\r\n1583.\" \"Jeames, son of Henry Shakespeare, bapt. Oct. 15th, 1585.\" Yet he\r\nappears as one of \"the pledges\" at the baptism of Henry Townsend, of\r\nSnitterfield, September 4, 1586. \"Jeames Shakespeare, of Ingon, buried\r\nOct. 25th, 1589,\"[228] is also mentioned by Malone. This is the correct\r\nreading of the \"Joannes\" mentioned by Halliwell-Phillipps as being\r\nburied in the same place so near the same date as September 25, 1589.\r\n\r\nA William Shakespeare appears once in Snitterfield as prising the goods\r\nof John Pardu in 1569; but we do not know his age and residence, and\r\nthere is no clue to any relationship with him.\r\n\r\nA William prised the goods of Robert Shakespeare of Wroxall, 1565, and\r\nthe goods of John Shaxper of Rowington, 1574.\r\n\r\nAn Anthony occurs among the billmen of Snitterfield in the muster book\r\nof 1569. John Shakespeare of Rowington, who held land at Wroxall 22\r\nHenry VIII., had a son Antonio, rather an unusual name. Tradition says\r\nthe poet had an uncle or grand-uncle, Antonio. But we must beware of\r\nusing tradition as a staff to lean upon. No Anthony appears in any\r\nfamily papers. An Antony Shaxspeare married Joane Whitrefe at Budbrook\r\n(in which parish is Hampton Corley), November 14, 1573; and in the\r\nRegister we find: \"Henrie Shackspere sonne of Shackspere and Joane his\r\nwife, baptized 24th March, 1575.\" \"Elizabeth, daughter to Antony\r\nShaksper of Hamton, baptized Feb. 10th, 1583,\" in the Stratford\r\nRegisters; and \"Henry, son of Antonio Shakespeare, buried June 18th,\r\n1583,\" in Clifford Chambers. This wandering makes his life rather\r\nconfusing to us.\r\n\r\nThomas Shakespeare _might_ have been an uncle. Thomas was presented as a\r\nregrator or forestaller of barley and wheat at Snitterfield Court, held\r\nApril, 1575. A Thomas, probably the same, appears in Stratford Records\r\nbetween 23 and 28 Elizabeth. He was sued for the price of malted barley\r\nin 23 Elizabeth. He had a son named John, baptized at Snitterfield March\r\n10, 1581-2. Of this child we know nothing further, but I make a\r\nsuggestion in a later chapter that may interest readers.\r\n\r\nThere was a Johanna Shakespeare,[229] whose burial record in\r\nSnitterfield, in 1595, makes no allusion to any male relative. She might\r\nhave been an aunt, a great-aunt, or even a grandmother of the poet, and\r\nthe widow of Richard. Similar entries of wives and widows have been\r\nfound in the neighbourhood. Joan was an important name in John\r\nShakespeare's eyes, and he gave the name to two of his daughters.\r\n\r\nRichard had probably a daughter who became Mrs. Green. A \"Thomas Green,\r\n_alias_ Shakespeare,\" was buried in Stratford-on-Avon, March 6, 1590. He\r\nwas probably the father of Thomas Green, solicitor, in whose \"Diary and\r\nCorrespondence\" we find allusions to his cousin Shakespeare: \"My cosen\r\nShakspeare has commyng yesterday to towne; I went to see him how he\r\ndid.\"[230] Jovis, Nov. 17.\r\n\r\nIt was he who conducted the Addenbrooke prosecution (1608), at which\r\ntime, we know not for what reason, he appears to have been living in\r\nShakespeare's home, New Place, in Stratford-on-Avon.\r\n\r\nThere might have been an indefinite number of cousins by marriage among\r\nthe Hathaways. I only mention this now in relation to one strange\r\nexample of the desire of association somehow with Shakespeare. In the\r\ncatalogue of the Shakespeare Library of Warwick Castle is the title of a\r\nbook written by a Hathaway clergyman of Tewkesbury, said to be \"a\r\ndescendant of Anne Hathaway,\" ignoring the fact that _Anne Hathaway_ was\r\n_Mrs. Shakespeare_. Yet he might after all have been a cousin twice\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[220] See \"Valor Ecclesiasticus,\" Warwickshire, at Dissolution, Henry\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n[221] Worcester wills.\r\n\r\n[222] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[223] Admin.

He was appointed Steward of the\r\nCourt of Record, Stratford-on-Avon, on September 7, 1603. There was no\r\nTown Clerk then, and the Steward did the duties until the Charter\r\ngranted to the town by James I., July 8, 1610, created the office of\r\nTown Clerk. He held part of the remainder of the tithes, the half of\r\nwhich were held by Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCONTEMPORARY WARWICKSHIRE SHAKESPEARES\r\n\r\n\r\nOutside the immediate family of the poet there were many contemporaries\r\nin Warwickshire, who may have been connected in some far-off degree.\r\n\r\nThere was the John Shakespeare, shoemaker, who came to Stratford about\r\n1580, probably as apprentice or journeyman of Roberts, the shoemaker, in\r\nwhose house he dwelt till 1594, and whose daughter Margery he\r\nmarried.[231] He became Member of the Company of Shoemakers and\r\nSaddlers, paying £3, in 1580, and Master of the Shoemakers' Company, and\r\nwas elected Ale-taster for the town in 1585. He paid 30s. for his\r\nfreedom January 19, 1585-86, and became Constable in the autumn of 1586.\r\nHis wife was buried on October 29, 1587, but he must shortly afterwards\r\nhave married again, as he had three children christened[232] in the\r\nparish church. On February 17, 1587, he was in receipt of Thomas Oken's\r\nmoney, and in 1588 became guardian to Thomas Roberts's sons. The poet's\r\nfather, after 1570, was always mentioned as Mr. John Shakespeare; this\r\nother appears simply as John, or John the Shoemaker, or Corvizer, or\r\nsome other epithet (see Records of Stratford-on-Avon). Hunter thinks\r\nthat he was the third son of Thomas Shakespeare, a shoemaker, of\r\nWarwick, who held land under the manor of Balsall, and mentioned in his\r\nwill, 1557, four children--William, Thomas, John and Joan, ux. Francis\r\nLey, mentioned in Warwick registers.\r\n\r\nThis John of Stratford seems to have left the town before 1595, as his\r\nhouse was inhabited by others then, and no further mention appears of\r\nhim in record or register.\r\n\r\nBeside John Shakespeare's _double_ of Stratford-on-Avon, there was a\r\nJohn Shakespeare of Clifford Chambers, a village a mile or two out of\r\nStratford, who has also been confused with him. He married there, on\r\nOctober 15, 1560, Julian Hobbyns, widow. He sued William Smith, of\r\nStratford, for debt, in 1572; and in the will of John Ashwell, of\r\nStratford, 1583, it is stated that \"John Shakespeare, of Clifford\r\nChambers, was in his debt.\" It is quite probable he was the John often\r\nin debt, who had \"no goods to seize,\" in Stratford-on-Avon, generally\r\nsupposed to be the poet's father.\r\n\r\nOther notices of the name, besides the Henry and Antonio\r\nabove-mentioned, appear in the Clifford Registers. Charles Malary and\r\nAlice Shakespeare were married in 1579. Katharine Morris, servant to\r\nJohn Shakespeare, was buried in 1587; Julian Shakespere buried July 22,\r\n1608; John Shakespere buried October 20, 1610. His will was proved at\r\nGloucester in 1611. These latter dates set the question of identity at\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nAn agricultural John was in occupation of Ingon in 1570.[233] I believe\r\nhim to be our John, the brother and surety of Henry. We must not forget\r\nthat as Ingon was so near Snitterfield, John of Ingon _may_ be the John\r\nShakespeare, _Agricola_, of Snitterfield, who administered Richard's\r\ngoods, and was fined, October 1, 1561, at the Snitterfield Court. And\r\nthere are many Johns of Rowington, fully entered in Mr. Rylands'\r\n\"Records of Rowington.\"\r\n\r\nJust as his father had _doubles_, so had William. There was a William\r\nShakespeare drowned in the Avon, and buried at St. Nicholas, Warwick,\r\nJuly 6, 1579.[234] The world would not have known what it had lost had\r\nthis fate overtaken \"our Will,\" but it makes us shiver now as we think\r\nof it, even as a past possibility. It has been thought that this youth\r\nwas the son of Thomas Shakespeare, shoemaker, of Warwick, and brother of\r\nJohn the shoemaker of Stratford. But he seems rather young for that\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\nAnother contemporary William seems to have been in a small way of\r\nbusiness as a farmers' agent, sometimes as a lender, and sometimes as a\r\nborrower. Among the Shakespeare manuscripts at Warwick Castle are\r\npreserved bonds for 2s. 6d. for a quarter of a year's use of £5 by\r\nWilliam Shakespeare in 1620, 1624, and 1626. Another of \"three quarters\r\nof oats to Will Shakespeare for a quarter's use of £5 due upon the 10th\r\nof May last, 1621,\" and some for the sale of malt.[235]\r\n\r\nIt has seemed to me much more than probable that this was the William\r\nwho sued Philip Rogers in the Court of Record at Stratford-on-Avon,[236]\r\nin 1604 for the price of a strike of malt sold and other money due. \"The\r\ndeclaration filed by William Shexspere\" in the Court has been accepted\r\nby Halliwell-Phillipps and all the Baconians as concerning the poet.\r\nBut, in the first place, any such declaration at that date would then\r\nhave designated our Shakespeare \"gent.\"; in the second, he would have\r\nemployed his cousin, Thomas Greene, as his attorney, and not William\r\nTetherton, and Thomas Greene would have spelt his name otherwise than it\r\nis written. In the third place, there is no corroborative testimony that\r\nthe poet ever sold malt, and there is concerning this contemporary\r\nWilliam.\r\n\r\nThe early registers of Rowington are lost, but we have shown from the\r\nwills that there were Shakespeares there bearing this Christian name.\r\nThe Richard of Rowington who died in 1561 mentions a son William in his\r\nwill. The second Richard of that place had a son William mentioned in\r\nthe will of 1591. The third Richard and his wife Elizabeth had four\r\nsons--William, Richard, Thomas, John, and a daughter Joan. William had\r\nworked as a labourer without wages on his father's property, with\r\nexpectation of succeeding to it. But some years before his father's\r\ndeath he went, with his father's permission, out to service, and married\r\na certain Mrs. Margery. His father was incensed against him, and left\r\nthe little property to his youngest son, John, November 13, 1613, proved\r\nin 1614.[237] Legal proceedings were commenced in 1614 at Worcester by\r\nWilliam about the property of his mother, Elizabeth. A Chancery suit\r\nbetween the brothers was instituted in the Star Chamber,[238] and the\r\ncase was heard at Warwick, in 1616, before four Commissioners, one of\r\nwhom was Francis Collins, gent., the overseer of the will of the poet.\r\nWilliam the plaintiff was then about forty years old. This is probably\r\nthe same man who felt injured by his family while supported by his\r\nwife's money in his lawsuits. The mark of a William Shakespeare is found\r\non a roll of the Customs of the Manor of Rowington, confirmed by the\r\njury in 1614. Was he the same? And if not, which of these was the\r\nWilliam Shakespeare whose name appears in the list of the trained\r\nsoldiers of Rowington,[239] taken before Sir Fulke Greville at Alcester,\r\nSeptember 23, 1605, erroneously by some believed to be the poet?[240]\r\n\r\nThere is preserved a petition of William Shaxsper, Richard Shuter, and\r\nothers of Rowington, co. Warwick, to the Committee for the Safety of\r\nCoventry and Warwick. About St. Andrew's Day they had some sea-coal\r\nwhich lay at Barford, near Warwick, which they had sold to Lady Lucy,\r\nbut the soldiers of the city finding fuel scarce, had burnt £5 10s.\r\nworth of it. They pray satisfaction for their coals. Underwritten by Mr.\r\nBasnet is an order to pay this sum, April, 1646.[241]\r\n\r\nA William Shakespeare, of Hatton, married Barbara Stiffe in 1589; styled\r\n\"gent.\" at baptism of his daughter _Susannah_, 1596. John Weale granted\r\nto Job Throgmorton the cottage in which William Shakespeare dwelt at\r\nHaseley, March 4, 1597.[242]\r\n\r\nIn the Star Chamber proceedings is the notice of a fine levied \"inter\r\nWillielmum Shackespeare et Georgium Shackespeare, quer. et Thomam\r\nSpencer, arm. Christopherum Flecknoe et Thomam Thompson deforc. de octo\r\nacris pasturæ cum pertinentiis in Claverdon, alias Claredon, 12 Jac. I.\r\n(1615).\"[243]\r\n\r\nI have collected these illustrations in order to show that the name\r\nWilliam was not by any means rare in the Shakespeare family, and to\r\naccount for some of the errors made concerning descents.\r\n\r\nIn 1589, also in the Star Chamber proceedings, we find there is a case\r\nbrought by \"Mary Ruswell against John Vale and Katharine his wife, and\r\nAylese Shackspire.\" This Alice Shakespeare was John Vale's mother-in-law\r\nand a widow. Is it not possible she might be the sister \"Alice\r\nShakespeare\" referred to in the Griffin will?\r\n\r\nIn most of the Warwickshire districts where the name is found in the\r\nearlier half of the sixteenth century it is found in the latter half,\r\nand also in the seventeenth century, though sometimes branches migrated\r\nto new neighbouring localities. It would be impossible to work out every\r\nfamily in detail in a work such as this.\r\n\r\nAnd yet some notices are necessary to complete the rapid survey. The\r\nShakespeares appear in two groups, one north and east of\r\nStratford-on-Avon, as at Ingon and Snitterfield. One family had settled\r\nat Tachbrook, nine miles north-east by east from Stratford. There was\r\nbaptized \"Roger, son of Robert Shakespeare, 21 April, 1557.\" Robert was\r\na weaver, and was probably son of Richard Shakespeare, of Haseley,\r\nweaver, in the reign of Henry VIII. He had also a son John, born 1574; a\r\ndaughter, Alice, buried 1559; another, Isabel, baptized 1560.\r\n\r\nRoger married Isabel Parkins in 1592, and Alice Higgins in 1595, and\r\nseems to have had a son, John, not in the register. But on April 22,\r\n1628, Elizabeth Shakespeare, the daughter of John and Christian his\r\nwife, was baptized, and on April 4, 1630, Judith Shakespeare, the\r\ndaughter of John and Christian Shakespeare. Later generations of the\r\nfamilies of Roger, John, and Walter are recorded there.[244]\r\n\r\nA few Shakespeares have been found in Alcester. But the older centre lay\r\nfurther north. By far the greatest number of names are found in the\r\nvillages to the west of a line drawn between Coventry and Warwick,\r\nincluding Meriden, Hampton-in-Arden, Berkswell, Knowle, Balsall,\r\nKenilworth, Packwood, Lapworth, Baddesley Clinton, Wroxall, Haseley,\r\nHatton, Rowington, and Budbrooke.\r\n\r\nThe early parish registers of Wroxall are lost, and only begin with\r\n1586.\r\n\r\n    On Dec. 9, 1588, Fraunces Shaxper ... was buried.\r\n    May 29, 1592, Nicholas Shaxper and Alice Edmunds m.\r\n    March 25, 1593, Peter, fil.

Christopher\r\nShakespere of Packwood, August 31, 1551, proved August 15, 1558,\r\nmentions a wife Isabel, and sons, Richard, William, Roger, Christopher,\r\nand John, and daughters Alice and Agnes; Elizabeth Shakspere of St.\r\nWerbergs, Derby, 1558; Roger Shakspere of Tachbrook, August 2, 1605;\r\nwife Alice and son John; William Shakespeare of Coventry, shoemaker,\r\nMarch 18, 1605-6; Administration of John Shakespeare's goods, 1606;\r\nThomas Shakespeare of Packington Parva, April 28, 1610, had a wife,\r\nPhillip, and sons, George (who was to have Coleshill lands), Thomas,\r\nAndrew, and a daughter, Alice Croft; Anne Shakespeare of Knowle's will,\r\n1743.\r\n\r\nThere has been a group entered in the Calendar in relation to the\r\nShakespeare and Ensor connection (Nichols's \"Herald and Genealogist,\"\r\nvol. ii., p. 297):\r\n\r\n    Thomas Shakespeare of Coventry, admin. 1693.\r\n    George Shakespeare of Fillongley, will 1700.\r\n    Sara Shakespeare of Pen,        admin. 1712.\r\n    Thomas Shakespeare of Arley,      \"    1720.\r\n    William Shakespear of Coventry,   \"    1724.\r\n    William Shakespear of Arley,      \"    1729.\r\n    George Shakespear of Coleshill,   \"    1734.\r\n    Anne Shakespeare of Coventry,     \"    1751.\r\n    George Shakespeare of Fillongley, \"    1754.\r\n    Mary Shakespeare of Aston,        \"    1768.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was an administration granted to Elizabeth Shakespeare, widow, of\r\nthe estate of Roger Shakespeare, of Chesset Wood, in the parish of\r\nHampton-in-Arden, April 15, 1597.\r\n\r\nJohn Shakespeare, of Knowle, Warwickshire, left to his eldest son,\r\nHenry, £5, and to each of his children £5--John, Elizabeth, Henry,\r\nThomas; to his granddaughter, daughter of John, £5; his property he left\r\nto his youngest son, John, 33 Charles II., September 30, 1681.[245] A\r\nWilliam Shakespeare,[246] of Knowle, is mentioned in 12 George II., as\r\n\"tenant to the precipe.\"\r\n\r\nThe will of Robert Shakespeare, of Wroxall, March 19, 1565, shows that\r\nhe had a son Nicolas, that another Nicolas owed him money, and that his\r\ngoods were prised by a William Shakespeare. John Shaksper, of Wroxall,\r\nlabourer, leaves his goods between his son Edward and his wife; mentions\r\nhis sister Alice, his brother Woodam's children, his cousin, Laurence\r\nShaxper, of Balsal, or Beausal, his brothers, William and Nicolas, and\r\nhis daughter, Alice Windmiles, December 15, 1574.\r\n\r\nWilliam Shakespeare, of Wroxall, husbandman, in his will, dated November\r\n17, 1609, left legacies to brothers and sisters not named.\r\n\r\nJohn Shakespere of Budbrooke, left his best suit to Nicolas Shakespeare;\r\nto his father-in-law, Thomas Burbidge, his best boots; to Mary\r\nShakespeare, two shillings; to Isabel Poole, late servant to Nicolas\r\nShakespeare, ten shillings. Anne Burbage, now the wife of William\r\nShotteswell, sole executrix, December 28, 1642.[247] He was buried\r\nDecember 30, 1642.[248]\r\n\r\nNicolas Shakespeare,[249] of Budbrooke,[250] being aged and weak, leaves\r\n£4 to the poor; £10 to his mother-in-law, Penelope Parkes; £40 to his\r\nbrother-in-law, Richard Parkes; £10 to his cousin, Richard Naso; £10 to\r\nWilliam Sattlewell, of Packwood. Residue to his dear wife Marie, sole\r\nexecutrix, October 23, 1655.\r\n\r\nJohn Shakespeare,[251] yeoman, of Lapworth, made his will October 30,\r\n1637; proved by his wife Dorothy 1638. He had no children, and his\r\nnephew, John Twycross, came in for most of his possessions. He left his\r\nbrother Christopher sixpence a week. Christopher's son John, and his two\r\ngrandsons, John and Thomas, had each twenty shillings. There was another\r\nbrother not named, whose three sons, Edward, William and Thomas, and\r\nthree daughters were to have £3 6s. 8d. each. Edward's two sons had also\r\nlegacies. The testator also mentions his sister, Catharine Shotteswell,\r\nCatharine, Elizabeth, Winifred, Humphrey, Thomas, and John Shakespeare.\r\nOverseers, John Fetherston, of Packwood, Esq., and John Shaxpere, of\r\nRingwood. Dorothy Shakespeare left no will. Letters of administration\r\nwere granted to her nephew, Antony Robbins, July 13, 1655.[252] In the\r\ntable of benefactions in Lapworth Church (near Knowle) it is recorded\r\nthat John Shakespeare and John Twycross gave each two shillings a year\r\nto the poor of Lapworth and Packwood. \"Humphrey Shakespeare gave twenty\r\nshillings to the poor of this parish, and the like to the poor of\r\nRowington, 1794.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Shakespeare, of Lapworth, fuller, February 21, 1655, desires to\r\nbe buried in Rowington. He leaves to his kinsman, Richard Shakespeare,\r\nof Kenilworth, his implements and £5; to his kinsman, Thomas\r\nShakespeare, of Lapworth, £5; to his kinsman and godson, Thomas\r\nShakespeare, of Rowington, £5; to his kinsman, Richard Shakespeare, £6\r\n13s. 4d.; to his kinswoman, Mary Shakespeare, £5; to his kinsman, John\r\nShakespeare, £5; to his brother William's son's daughter Elizabeth,\r\nsixpence, if demanded; to the poor of Rowington, forty shillings. The\r\nexecutrix was his kinswoman, Elizabeth Shakespeare, and the overseers,\r\nThomas Sly, of Lapworth, and his kinsman, Thomas Shakespeare, of\r\nWhittlygate in Rowington; proved May 18, 1658.[253]\r\n\r\nIt may be seen that Rowington was the central source of most of these\r\nShakespeares. Besides those already mentioned, we may note that there\r\nwas a case of John Shakesper _versus_ William Skinner, farmer, of the\r\nChurch of Rowington; an answer of William Skinner to the Bill of\r\nComplaint; a document relating to Thomas Shakespeare, of Rowington,\r\n1571, marked \"Skinner\"; and another concerning John Shakespeare. John\r\nShaxper of Rowington's will was drawn up in 1574.[254] He left his\r\nproperty called Madywattons, at Shrawley, to his son George, with\r\nremainder to his daughter Annis, and £20 to his son Thomas. He left\r\nlegacies to his brothers Nicolas and Thomas and his Aunt Ley, the\r\nmidwife. His wife's name was Eleanor. His goods were prised at £8 6s.\r\n8d. by Thomas and William Shaxper, among others. The will of Richard\r\nShakespere, of Rowington, November 13, 1613, which caused so much\r\nheartburning, showed that his son William had a son John, and that his\r\nson Richard had four sons (Thomas, William, Richard and John). Thomas\r\nand John's children are not mentioned. Another will[255] in the same\r\nyear of Thomas Shakespeare, of Mowsly and Rowington, October 13, 1613,\r\nmentions sons--John, Thomas and Richard; and daughters--Eleanor, Joan\r\nand Annis. John had two sons--William and John. John Shakespeare de le\r\nHill, Rowington, made his will January 20, 1652; his wife was Mary; his\r\nchildren, William, John, and Margaret Vernon.\r\n\r\nThe Shakespeares from the Register of Rowington, printed by Mr. Rylands,\r\nare given in the notes.\r\n\r\nIn 1593 Thomas Shakespeare and Florence, his wife, with her sister,\r\nAlice Grace, sued Thomas Grace[256] and John Harding for certain lands\r\nnot specified, settled by their father on them. Thomas Shackspeare, of\r\nRowington, was assessed for the subsidy of 1597.[257] Thomas Shaxper,\r\nsenior, of the same place, in 7 Jac. I., 1610. A survey of Crown lands\r\nin Warwickshire, 4 Jac. I., 1607, in the Land Revenue Office shows\r\nThomas, George, Richard and John as holding property there. A Thomas\r\nShakespeare was presented in 1632.[258]\r\n\r\nThomas Shakespeare, of Rowington, _temp._ John Pickering, Lord Keeper,\r\nand Maria, his wife, daughter and heir of William Mathews, deceased,\r\nfiled a bill in Chancery concerning various tenements in Hatton,\r\nShrawley, Rowington, Pinley and Clendon.[259] Hil., 16 Elizabeth, Hugo\r\nWalford, Quer., and Thomas Shakspere and Marie, his wife, defendants,\r\nconcerning cottage and 5 acres of land in Norton Curlew. Easter, 20\r\nJames I., Thomas Shakespere, Quer., and John Hall and Joyce, his wife,\r\ndefendants, of 12 acres of land in Rowington, which were sold to the\r\nsaid Thomas Shakespeare, 41 Elizabeth.[260] There was a license granted\r\nto a Thomas Shakespeare, aged twenty-three, to pass beyond the sea, June\r\n13, 1632, to the Low Countries, to serve as a soldier.[261] At a court\r\nof the Queen's Majesty, Henrietta Maria, Thomas Shakespere paid a fine\r\nof 6s. 8d. for admission to lands surrendered by himself, to himself and\r\nothers, 1647.\r\n\r\nAmong the manuscripts of the Free Library at Birmingham there remains a\r\nfine, 7 Charles I., between Adrian Shakspere, Quer., and Thomas Green\r\nand Anna, his wife, about land in old Fillongley; a bond for £40 of\r\nAdrian Shakespere, of Meriden, yeoman; and another fine, Easter, 26\r\nCharles II., between Thomas Brearley, gent., and Thomas Shakspeare,\r\ngent.\r\n\r\nThere were Shakespeares also still at Baddesley Clinton. In the Diary of\r\nHenry Ferrers of that place, we find him speak of \"napkins received from\r\nHenry Shakespeare, Nov. 4th, 1620\"; of \"Peeter Shakespeare, Nov. 5.\" \"I\r\now Shakespeare none, Nov. 6th.\" \"Henry Shakespeare sent his boy for a\r\nmark for his napkin. Nov. 12th, 1628-9.\" \"Shakespeare of Kingswood, Feb.\r\n4th.\" \"Shakespeare of Rowth(?), Feb. 18.\" \"John Shakespeare came hither\r\nabout his court.\"[262] This is the Henry Ferrers who wrote the Catalogue\r\nof all the Noblemen and Gentlemen resident in Warwick in 1577-78.[263]\r\n\r\nThere is a tombstone on the walls of Rowington Church:\r\n\r\n     \"In memory of John Shakespeare, of Baddesley Clinton, and\r\n     Mary his wife, who died, he, August 26, 1722, 61; she,\r\n     September 3, 1722, 56.\r\n\r\n     \"They were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their\r\n     deaths they were not divided.\"\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been a large number of Shakespeares in the town of\r\nWarwick.\r\n\r\nA John Shakespeare was assessed 1d. a week for relief of the poor, 1582,\r\nin Market Place Ward, and a Thomas Shakespeare at the same time in West\r\nStreet Ward.[264]\r\n\r\nIn the inquisitions post-mortem of Ambrose Dudley, Earl of Warwick, 32\r\nElizabeth, a Thomas Shackspere was one of the witnesses.\r\n\r\nA Thomas Shakespeare had a grant from Mr. Henry Ferrers of two\r\nmessuages, one orchard, four gardens, and four acres of pasture in\r\nWarwick for £80, Michaelmas, 39 Elizabeth, 1597.\r\n\r\nThere was a Thomas Shakespeare--probably the same--who married on June\r\n21, 1598, Elizabeth Letherbarrow, daughter of the Mayor of Coventry. He\r\nbecame Bailiff of Warwick November 1, 10 Jac. I., 1613. The only notice\r\nof the name in the \"Visitation of Warwickshire\" in 1619 is that of\r\n\"Thomas Shakespeere, gent., one of the principal Aldermen of Warwick.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not clear whether or not he was the son of Thomas Shakespeare, the\r\nshoemaker, who held land of the manor of Wroxall, and died in 1557,\r\nleaving William, Thomas, John, and Joan, ux. Francis Ley.[265]\r\n\r\nIn Birmingham Registers there was a William, 1637, and an Anne\r\nShakespeare of Knowle, 1743.\r\n\r\nMore might be said of the Shakespeares of Coventry and Fillongley. There\r\nis a tablet recording Shakespeare benefactions in Fillongley Church, and\r\nmany still bear the name among the neighbouring peasantry. But to\r\ncomplete the pedigrees of the Warwickshire families, we must follow them\r\nto other abodes.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[231] November 25, 1584, Stratford-on-Avon Register. Mr. R. B.

The\r\nadministration of the goods of Mary Shakespeare, Warwick, was granted\r\n1723.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nSHAKESPEARES IN OTHER COUNTIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Warwickshire Shakespeares overflowed into the surrounding counties.\r\nThere were Shakespeares in Stafford,[266] Worcester,[267]\r\nGloucester,[268] Northampton,[269] Leicester,[270] Berkshire[271] and\r\nOxford.\r\n\r\nThe three latter are worth noting. In 1597 there resided at Lutterworth,\r\nonly a few miles from Stratford, a Thomas Shakespeare, who was employed\r\nby William Glover, of Hillenden, in Northamptonshire, gent., as his\r\nagent to receive and give an acquittance for a considerable sum of\r\nmoney.[272] It is not clear whether it was this same person or a son who\r\nwas the Thomas Shakespeare, gent., of Staple Inn, Middlesex, who\r\npresented a certificate to some unnamed court, October 12, 1604,\r\naccounting for his non-appearance in a case.[273] John Perkyns was the\r\nplaintiff; Thomas Shakespere, William Perkyns, William Teery and others,\r\ndefendants. He had been summoned at the suit of Perkyns to appear, in\r\nthe Octaves of Trinity, but he had been required to be seventy miles out\r\nof London on the Saturday of the Octaves of Trinity in a Chancery Case.\r\nHe only rested on the Sabbath at home, started on the Monday, and\r\nappeared in court on Wednesday. The other defendants were allowed the\r\nexplanation; that it was denied to him seemed to be of malice. I cannot\r\nfind the decision. I searched the Lay Subsidies of Leicester,[3] in\r\nLutterworth and elsewhere, for this Shakespeare in vain; but I find that\r\nin 1594 a William Perkins paid in bond for Richard Perkins in Wigston\r\nParva.[274] A bond of Thomas Shakespeare, of Lutterworth, November 27,\r\n1606, to James Whitelocke for 26s. 8d., is mentioned in the Historical\r\nMSS. Com.[275] A letter addressed to the Mayor of Leicester by certain\r\nleading inhabitants of Lutterworth about the plague is signed first by\r\nThomas Shakespeare,[276] and Mr. French found in the Admission Books of\r\nStaple Inn,[277] \"Thomas Shakespeare, of Lutterworth, in Com. Leic.,\r\ngent., etc., 15th Feb., 5 Jac. I., 1607.\" Does the following entry refer\r\nto him or to Thomas Shakespere of Warwick? \"John, son of Thomas\r\nShakespeare, gent., baptized July 18th, 1619.\"[278]\r\n\r\nJohn Shakespear (1774-1858),[279] Orientalist, was born at Lount, near\r\nAshby, in Leicestershire, son of a small farmer there. He became\r\nProfessor of Hindustani, and gave £2,500 towards preserving the\r\nbirthplace at Stratford-on-Avon. He did not marry, and his property came\r\nto his nephew, Charles Bowles, who took the surname of \"Shakespeare.\"\r\n\r\nA William Shakespeare was convicted at Leicester Assizes of\r\nnight-poaching.[280]\r\n\r\nThe Oxford Shakespeares deserve fuller attention than they have yet\r\nreceived. The Saunders _alias_ Shakespeare, already mentioned,[281] was\r\npossibly a native of another county. But we find some in the shire,\r\ncontemporary with the poet. Among the \"Original Wills at Somerset House\r\nthere is one of Thomas Shackspeare, Innkeeper,\" in the suburbs of\r\nOxford. He wished to be buried in the Church of St. Giles, Oxford,\r\nbequeathed property to his four children--Robert, Ellen, Mary, and\r\nElizabeth, £10 each when they came of age--and left his wife Elizabeth\r\nresiduary legatee and sole executrix; overseers, Mr. Ralf Shillingworth\r\nand Henry Hedges. A remembrance was left to the preacher of his funeral\r\nsermon, and to his loving friend Mr. Harris, of Yarnton, and he \"set his\r\nhand and seale thereto,\" May 27, 1642;[282] witnesses, Thomas Champe and\r\nNathaniel Harris. It is curious that the seal used should represent a\r\nwinged heart bleeding, surmounted by a ducal coronet.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, a notice of this one family is preserved in _Notes and\r\nQueries_,[283] though it is not mentioned in the index. It was\r\ntranscribed from St. Mary Magdalene's, Oxford, by Dr. Macray while he\r\nwas yet curate. \"Thomas Shakspere, the sonne of Thomas Shaxspere, was\r\nbaptised the 19th day of August, 1628;\" Marie, April 15, 1630;\r\nElizabeth, June 29, 1632; \"Robert, the sone of Thomas Shaxspere,\r\nInkeeper, was baptized September the 24th, 1634.\" Among the burials\r\nappear, \"Thomas, the son of Thomas Shaxespere, was buried Nov. 4th,\r\n1642; Thomas Shaxsper, Inkeper, buried Nov. 11th, 1642; Ellinor Shaxsper\r\nwas buried May second, 1643.\" The earlier records of the Church are\r\nlost. It is a pity the other Oxford registers have not been thoroughly\r\nsearched for the name, or printed.\r\n\r\nA John Shakespeare,[284] of St. Mary's Hall, took the degree of B.A. in\r\n1666. The _Oxford Chronicle_[285] of April 20, 1765, mentions a Richard\r\nShakespeare as being committed to Coventry Gaol as a forger.\r\n\r\nSome of these Shakespeares gravitated towards London. In the will of\r\nLeonard Wilmot, of Clanfield, co. Oxon., gent., 1608, there is a bequest\r\nto \"Leonard Shackspire, my godson, servant to John Prince, of Abington,\r\nVintner, 5^li, and to John Shackspire, of Newnam, 5^li.\"[286] This John\r\nmay be father of Leonard, and may be the John referred to in the note.\r\n\"John Shakespeare, of Nuneham Courtney, co. Oxford, an old feeble man,\r\nhad been drinking in his house, 25th Nov., 1633.\"[287] A Leonard is\r\nmentioned in the register of Sunningwell, Berks, as being married to\r\nAlyce Parkes of Abingdon, September 12, 1614. This is probably the\r\nLeonard of Isleworth, Middlesex, vintner, who at an advanced age made\r\nhis will,[288] March 26, 1664. He left his wife Elizabeth two tenements\r\nin Isleworth for life, then to his son John and his heirs; to his son\r\nWilliam, 12d.; to his son Ralph, 12d.; to his daughter, Elizabeth King,\r\n£20 after his wife's death; to his son William's son William, 2s. 6d.;\r\nto his daughter Elizabeth, a feather bed; to his daughter Sara, 12d.; to\r\nhis daughter Robina, 12d.; if John died without heirs, the tenements to\r\ngo to his sons Ralph and William. His wife Elizabeth executrix; his\r\nfriend, Mr. William Dance, and his son-in-law, Robert Parsons,\r\noverseers. Was it a stepmother's influence that made him cut off his two\r\nsons with a shilling?[289]\r\n\r\nWorking for another purpose at a later date, I found Shakespeares in the\r\nlittle village of South Stoke in Oxfordshire. Among the baptisms are:\r\n\"John, April 8th, 1751; Mary, Oct. 22nd, 1752; Hannah, Sept. 29, 1754;\r\nElizabeth, Aug. 24th, 1756; Ann, July 6th, 1760, all children of Robert\r\nand Mary Shakespeare.\" \"Susanna, base-born daughter of Catharine\r\nShakespeare, Dec. 24th, 1784.\" \"Elizabeth, daughter of John Shakespeare,\r\nand Eleanor his wife, Nov. 12, 1786.\" Among the marriages are \"John Birt\r\nand Mary Shakespeare, 7th December, 1773.\" Among the burials are\r\n\"William, March 13th, 1768,\" and \"Robert, July 20th, 1786.\" In the same\r\nvolume are Richard and Thomas, sons of Richard Burbage, 1577 and 1579,\r\nwho both died in infancy, and there are many other Shakespearean names.\r\n\r\nIn counties still further from Warwickshire the name is also found, as\r\nwe may note in Hertfordshire, Derbyshire,[290] Hampshire, Surrey,\r\nBedfordshire. There was administration granted to Lucy Shakespear,\r\nwidow, of the goods of her deceased husband Thomas, of the town of\r\nHertford, October 10, 1626; and Luke Shakespear, of Layston, co. Herts,\r\nfishmonger, made his will[291] May 7, 1707. His wife was Joyce, and he\r\nhad a sister and two brothers not named.\r\n\r\nIn Layston[292] Churchyard there are the tombs of \"Mr. John Shakespeare,\r\nlate citizen and founder of London,\" 1732, and of \"Henry Mond\r\nShakespear, Citizen and Loriner of London,\" 1784.\r\n\r\nIn Portsmouth, 1662, William Shakespeare was contractor for the old Gun\r\nWharf. A public-house, called Shakespeare's Head, is supposed to have\r\nbeen the place where he paid his men.[293] On April 25, 1747, in St.\r\nGregory's by St. Paul's, were married \"John Shakespeare of Portsea, and\r\nMary Higginson of St. James', Westminster.\" Joseph Champ and Martha Ham,\r\nmarried at Portsmouth April 22, 1736, had John Shakespeare, of\r\nPortsmouth, as one of their bondsmen; and George Poate and Anne Loch,\r\nOctober 6, 1802, had Samuel Shakespeare one of their bondsmen.[294] The\r\nLondon Shakespeares seem to have had a residence in Hampshire also, for\r\n\"Mrs. Shakespeare, widow of Alderman Shakespeare, of London, died at\r\nBramdean, co. Hants, aged 80, in March, 1807.\"[295]\r\n\r\nAubrey speaks of the wife of John Shakespeare, of Worplesdowne, in\r\nSurrey, who made as good butter there as she ever did at Wroxall or\r\nBitteston. She was a North Wiltshire woman.[296] At Walton-upon-Thames,\r\nSurrey, tombstones remind us of Matthew Shakespeare and George\r\nShakespeare, who died August 8, 1775; also of John Shakespeare, of\r\nWeybridge, January 13, 1775; of William Shakespeare of this parish,\r\n1783; and of George Shakespeare, architect, Oxford Street, London,\r\n1797.[297]\r\n\r\nOn March 13, 1663, \"William Shakespeare of Faucat was buried, and on\r\nJuly 23, 1668, Ann Shackspere, daughter to Will Shackspear, was buried\r\nin Toddington, co. Beds.\"[298]\r\n\r\nThere were Shakespeares also in Essex. Mr. Veley collects a few\r\nparticulars regarding them from the unregistered wills of the\r\nArchdeaconry of Essex.[299] The oldest is that of Thomas Shakespeare,\r\npriest, August 26, 1557. He leaves legacies to \"8 priests of Jesus\r\nCommons, wherein I now dwell,\" to sing masses, and something to the\r\nmaintenance of Jesus Commons, and to poor people, to the sisters of\r\nSion, the fathers of Sheen, the observant friars of Greenwich, the\r\nBlack-Friars of St. Bartholomew, Smithfield, the nuns of King's Langley,\r\nand \"to the parryshe church of Seynt Mildryd in Bred Streete in London,\r\ntowards the byeing of a pyxt or monstrat to carry the blyssyd Sacrament,\r\nv^li. To my brother, Robert Shakespeare; my brother, Harry Wyllson; my\r\nbrother, John Cooke; my sister, Grace Starke; my sister, Jone\r\nShackspere: my sister, Cicely Richardson; to John Cooke, of Jesus\r\nCommons; to Mother Agnes, of the Commons, and Goodwyfe Blower.\" The\r\nstrange thing about this will is that it seems to have been made by the\r\nsame Sir Thomas Shakespeare, clerk, whom I enter among the\r\npre-Shakespearean London Shakespeares in August 22, 1559.[300] His will\r\nis preserved at Somerset House.[301]\r\n\r\nThe two years that intervened between the drafting of the two wills were\r\nyears of great import. Mary had died, Philip had vanished, and Elizabeth\r\nwas seated on the throne. Therefore it is not surprising that there are\r\nfewer priestly legacies in the later will, that it mentions also fewer\r\nrelatives, and no brother Robert. But there are still sisters, Thomasine\r\nCook, Grace Storeton, Jone Shackspere, and a relative, Anne Wilson; and\r\nthe legacy to the Church of St. Mildred's, Bread Street, London.[302]\r\nMr. Veley does not know of this later will, which is the one that was\r\nproved. He takes it for granted Thomas was an Essex man, though he lived\r\nin London. He probably was so.\r\n\r\nMr. Veley also mentions a Joseph Shakespeare of Havering, who made his\r\nwill 1640. He had a brother Samuel, of Hornchurch, whose widow Susan\r\nmade her will in 1678; a Samuel, of Romford, her son, who married\r\nJudith, had a daughter Ann, and died in 1707; a Thomas, of Hornchurch,\r\nalso son of Susan, who made his will in 1702; and a William, probably a\r\nthird brother, who married Susannah, was father to John of Rawreth, and\r\nmade his will March 2, 1723. John of Rawreth's goods were administered\r\nby his daughter Judith, wife of Asser Vassall, 1731. Mr. Veley also\r\nfinds a John and Elizabeth mentioned, but unfortunately does not print\r\nthe contents of these other wills.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted that there is a considerable gap between the date of the\r\npriest and his brother Robert and these later Shakespeares. I was glad\r\nto find among the administrations at Somerset House[303] the name of\r\n\"Alice Shakespeare, Widow, of Ginge Margretting, Essex, 1581.\" She might\r\nhave been the widow of this Robert, and might also have been, at an\r\nadvanced age, the sister Alice Shakespeare mentioned in the will of\r\nFrancis Griffin, of Braybrook, 37 Henry VIII., who, Mr. Yeatman insists,\r\nmust have been the poet's grandmother. Francis Griffin remembers another\r\nsister, _Agnes Crosmore_. The goods of this Alice Shakespeare were\r\nadministered by her sister, _Agnes Williams_, of Barking. I have made a\r\nprolonged search among the Subsidy Rolls of Essex to locate this family.\r\nNowhere have I found the spelling of the name so varied, from\r\nShakesphere to Shakespurr, Saxper, and even Shaksby and Shucksby.\r\nCross-references prove these to be intended for the same name.[304] In 3\r\nJac. I., in Foulness, Essex, a Nicholas Saxper; in Rochford,[305] 21\r\nJac. I., John Shuxbye, and in Stambridge Magna, 4 Car. I., both Shakesby\r\nand Shukesby. The Hearth Tax,[306] Essex, Car. II., mentions Samuel\r\nShexpere, and the Subsidy Rolls of 14 Car. II., Samuel Shaksper, of\r\nHarold's Wood Ward. In 1666[307] there appear in the Hundred of Witham\r\nThomas Shakesby and Edward Shakesby, a Samuel Shakespeare of the North\r\nEnd of Hornchurch, and a Samuel Shakespeare of Harold's Wood Ward.\r\n\r\nIn the Hundred of Chafford, William Shakespeare, gent., of Langdon\r\nHills, appears among the collectors of the subsidies. It is possible\r\nthere may have been many more of the name assessed; but some of the\r\nRolls are lost and many are decayed in various ways. I have searched\r\nseveral of the outlying registers without success, but others have found\r\nthe name in Romford, Barking, Hornchurch, Rawreth, and Rochester.\r\n\r\nIn the county where we find an early notice of the family the name\r\noccasionally appears. Mr. J. M. Cowper, Canterbury, tells us that\r\n\"Judith filia Leonardi Shakespeare was baptized Feb. 27, 1596-7, at\r\nWarehorne, Kent.\"[308] The name does not occur again. In Rucking, Kent,\r\nFebruary 24, 1599, John, son of Reginald Shakespear, was baptized, and\r\non May 30, 1600, Reginald Shakespeare was buried.[309]\r\n\r\nMr. W. J. Lightfoot, the transcriber, says that he is acquainted with\r\nseveral other neighbouring parishes, and that the name does _not_ occur\r\nin their registers--a statement which, curiously enough, Mr. French\r\nreproduces without the \"not.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Austin and Margaret Shakespeare, of Biddenden, Kent, widow, were\r\nmarried July 26, 1639.[310]\r\n\r\nIn the North, where the early Shakespeares were attached to land, they\r\nseem to have survived and spread, as may be seen from the directories of\r\nNorthern towns to-day.[311] Ireland, too, owns Shakespeares, possibly\r\ndescended from the Thomas of Youghal.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[266] _Notes and Queries_, Second Series, vi. 285; Third Series, viii.\r\n33. \"George, descendant of Humphrey,\" etc. Mr. Dickenson tells me there\r\nare many of the name in the parish of Bredon.\r\n\r\n[267] By fine levied Hil. 1655, Shakespere conveyed tenements in\r\nInckbarrow, Worcestershire, _Notes and Queries_, Second Series, vii.\r\n336.\r\n\r\n[268] There is the will of John Shakespeare, of Newington Bagpath, Cook,\r\namong the Gloucester Wills, Index Library, and in \"The Shakespeares of\r\nDursley,\" by John Henry Blount, we find James Shakespeare buried at\r\nBisley, March 13, 1570; Edward, son of John and Margery Shakespeare,\r\nbapt. at Beverston, September 19, 1619. Thomas Shakespeare, weaver, was\r\nmarried to Joan Turner at Dursley Church, March 3, 1677-78, and of their\r\nchildren, Edward was bapt. July 1, 1681; Mary, 1682; Thomas, 1685; and\r\nMary, 1691. John Shakespeare was a mason in Dursley from 1704 to 1739;\r\nand Thomas Shakespeare had a seat-place allotted him in 1739. Betty\r\nShakespeare received poor money from 1747 till 1754.

In the churchwardens' account[312] he was only\r\ncharged 2d. for the candles at his funeral, a common charge, but not for\r\ngreat people. He may have been the son of the fifteenth-century William,\r\nor of Peter of Southwark, and father or brother of Roger the royal\r\nyeoman.\r\n\r\nThe discovery that _Shakespeare_ lived in St. Helen's Parish,\r\nBishopsgate, has been claimed for an American, though Hunter mentioned\r\nin his \"Life of Shakespeare,\" 1845, that in the Subsidy Rolls of London\r\na William Shakespeare was assessed in 1597 in that district.[313]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORDEN'S MAP OF LONDON, 1593.\r\n\r\n_Between pp. 142, 143._]\r\n\r\nThe entry is: \"Affid. William Shakespeare on v^li goods,[314] assessed\r\nxiii iiii^d.\" The \"affid.\" affixed to it shows that the Shakespeare\r\nnamed tried to avoid payment on some grounds. It has surprised many, and\r\nsatisfied others as suitable, that the poet should have lived in this\r\nneighbourhood, near so many of his theatrical friends. But I do not\r\nthink it is certainly proved that it was our Shakespeare at all. Two\r\nreferences of Collier seem to locate him in Southwark in 1596, and in\r\n1609, near the site of the Globe Theatre. Several of the name lived near\r\nBishopsgate before and after his death.\r\n\r\nJohn Scatcliffe, of St. Botolph's, Aldersgate, cook, bachelor,\r\ntwenty-four, and Mary Shakespeare, of the same, spinster, twenty-four,\r\nat St. Botolph's, December 20, 1637;[315] in later years, Nathaniel[316]\r\nShaxspere and Elizabeth ----, widow, married August 18, 1663, in St.\r\nBotolph's, Bishopsgate; Henry Shakespeare, of St. Botolph's,\r\nBishopsgate, bachelor (twenty-five), and Elizabeth Hartwell, of same,\r\nspinster (twenty), her parents dead, with consent of her grandmother,\r\nElizabeth Gaye, of same, at St. Botolph's, March 26, 1663; William[317]\r\nWinch and Abigail Shaxpere, married September 30, 1680; Francis Hill and\r\nSaray Saxspere, September 28, 1682; John Shakespeare and Edith Murry,\r\nmarried at St. Botolph's, Bishopsgate, January 2, 1699; William\r\nShakespear and Anna Maria Carter, both of this parish, July 9, 1733.\r\n\r\nThere was a Matthew Shakespere who, on February 5, 1566-67, married\r\nIsabel Peele in Christ Church,[318] Newgate Street. She was probably\r\ndaughter of James Peele, Clerk of Christ's Hospital from 1562 to 1585,\r\nand sister of George Peele,[319] the dramatist, educated in the Grammar\r\nSchool there. They seem to have had a large family.[320] On January 18,\r\n1569, Johanne, daughter of Matthew Shakespere, was baptized, and buried\r\non February 11. On March --, 1574, Francis, son of Matthew Shakespere,\r\nbaptized; on August 27, 1578, Jane; on April 7, 1583, Thomas. There was\r\nalso a Humphrey entered as son of _Hugh_ Shakespeare, August 5, 1571.\r\nBut as among the burials there appears \"Humphrey, son of Matthew\r\nShackspere, Aug. 30, 1571,\" it would seem to be an error. Johanne,\r\ndaughter of Matthew Shackespere, was buried December 26, 1572, the\r\nsecond of the name; Jayne, on September 5, 1577, the first of the name.\r\nRobert, son of Matthew Shackspeare, was buried May 5, 1580. Besides\r\nthese were buried Francis Shakespeare, October 7, 1571, and Robert\r\nShakespeare, May 24, 1577. These might be grandfather and uncle of the\r\nfamily, which might have reckoned a William among its members.\r\n\r\nThere was a Thomas Shakespeare, royal messenger, in 1572, payments to\r\nwhom I have found in the State Papers.[321] And in \"Archæologia\" there\r\nis printed his request for payment, in 1577, for carrying letters from\r\nthe Privy Council to the Bishop of London at Fulham, the Bishop of York\r\nat Tower Hill, the Bishop of Chichester at Westminster, the Bishop of\r\nDurham in Aldersgate Street, and to the Bishop of Worcester in St.\r\nPaul's Churchyard.[322]\r\n\r\nMr. Hunter and many others supposed that at the time of the poet there\r\nwas only _one_ other of the name in London--John of St.\r\nMartin's-in-the-Fields.\r\n\r\nIn the churchwardens' accounts there were found notices of a John\r\nShakespeare about 1605. Mr. French thinks that he might be the John, son\r\nof Thomas, of Snitterfield.[323] I have worked through these books and\r\nthe registers, and have gleaned a good many scraps about him. He appears\r\nthere too early. John of Snitterfield was born in 1581-82. John of St.\r\nMartin's, on January 22, 1589, was married[324] to Dorothea Dodde,\r\ndaughter of the Vestry Clerk (her sister Jane had, the year before,\r\nmarried a Christopher Wren) of that parish; and on December 23, 1593, it\r\nis to be supposed he had a daughter, \"Maria Shakespeare,\" christened,\r\nmentioned there, as is customary in that register, without the name of\r\nher father.\r\n\r\nIn 1594 Mrs. Shakespeare's sister was staying with her, as among the\r\nburials is entered, \"Elizabeth Dod, from Shakespeares.\"\r\n\r\nJohn[325] Shakespeare, \"on the land side of the parish,\" in 1603,\r\ncontributed to the new casting of the bells five shillings, and in 1605\r\nwas one of the sidesmen. \"Paid to John Shakespeare, one of the sidesmen,\r\nthat he laid out at the registers office for putting in the Recusants\r\nBills 3s. 4d.\" In 1609 \"Dorithie Shakespeare\" was buried, and her\r\nexpenses brought in to the churchwardens 32s. 2d., relatively a large\r\nsum, as Sir Thomas Windebanck's funeral cost only 16s. In that same year\r\nJohn contributed also ten shillings to the repair of the church. On June\r\n20, 1613, the churchwardens \"received from John Shakespeare, by the\r\nhands of Edward Thickness, the sum of £10, given as a legacy by Mrs.\r\nDimbleby, deceased\" (which suggests that he was her executor), and in\r\n1617 they \"gave to John Shakespeare's daughter 7s. 6d.\"--a curious\r\nentry, which I cannot explain. She may have done some work for the\r\nchurchwardens, as they often employed women; it may have been a debt due\r\nher father, a present on her marriage, or an aid in sudden poverty. The\r\ndeath of a \"John Shakespeare, a man,\" is noted in 1646, in apparent\r\npoverty, as the funeral cost only 1s.--a different cost from that of\r\nMrs. Dorothy Shakespeare in 1608. I had thought it possible that this\r\nsum represented only a fee for a burial in another parish, but I find\r\nthat theory is untenable. Whether the John of 1646 was the same as the\r\nsidesman of 1605 or not, he was certainly buried in the parish. From the\r\nvestry books I found many notices of John Shakespeare as contributing to\r\nthe expenses of the poor, first on the \"waterside\" of the parish, and\r\nthen on the \"landside\"; and I believed, reasoning from a State Paper\r\nBill, that he was referred to in the entry, \"received for a pewe, from\r\nthe Princes' Bitmaker 30s., 1639-40.\" His name disappeared from the\r\nbooks long before 1646; and I fancied he had gone farther east to the\r\nparish of St. Clement's Danes, which joined that of St. Martin's at\r\nseveral points. \"Paid to William Wright for a stone engraved with\r\nletters on it, which is sett in the wall of the Earl of Salisbury at his\r\nhouse at Ivie Bridge to devide the two parishes of St. Martin's in the\r\nFields and St. Clement's Danes in that place.\" I gave up theorizing\r\nuntil I could see the registers of St. Clement's Danes, and from various\r\ncauses three years passed before I had an opportunity of clearing up the\r\npuzzle. These registers prove that in London, as in Stratford-on-Avon, I\r\nhad been confused by double entries, and that there was _another John\r\nShakespeare_. The St. Martin's John lost his wife Dorothy in 1608; the\r\nSt. Clement's John married his wife Mary in 1605. \"3rd Feb. 1604-5,\r\nJohne Shakspear and Mary Godtheridg.\" _He_ was the wealthy bitmaker to\r\nthe King, of whom I had discovered notices in the State Papers and wills\r\nthat turned my attention to St. Clement's Danes, a hitherto unsuspected\r\nlocality for Shakespeare finds. I thought at first that he might have\r\nbeen John the shoemaker who vanished from Stratford. But it was hardly\r\nlikely that he should have changed his trade from shoemaking to\r\nbitmaking, or that he would have been successful in it. The St.\r\nClement's John might have been a son of the St. Martin's John, but there\r\nis no christening of a John in that parish, or in any other London\r\nparish that I know. So here I thought I might justly theorize, and state\r\nmy opinion that he really was the John, son of Thomas, of Snitterfield,\r\nborn 1581-82, of whom is no record of further life or burial in his own\r\nneighbourhood. He would be of a suitable age, and there was in his case\r\na _reason_ for Court success.\r\n\r\nWilliam Shakespeare the poet had by this time made his mark, not only in\r\nliterature and the drama, but in Court influence and financial\r\npossibilities. His patron, the Earl of Southampton, was in favour with\r\nthe King. Supposing this John was Shakespeare's first cousin, as I\r\nbelieve he was, what more likely than that the poet, who had lost his\r\nonly son, would help, as far as he could, his nearest male relative? I\r\ntrust to find further proof of this some day, but I may state what I do\r\nknow about this St. Clement's John. He had a large family. The registers\r\nrecord in the baptizings: \"John Shaxbee sonne of John 28th Aug. 1605.\"\r\n\"Susan Shasper daughter of John 19th Feb. 1607.\" \"Jane Shakespeer the\r\ndaughter of John 16th July 1608.\" \"Anthony Shaksbye son of John 23rd\r\nJune 1610.\" \"Thomas Shackspeer son of John 30th June 1611.\" \"Ellyn\r\nShakspear the daughter of John 5th May 1614.\" \"Katharine Shakspeare\r\ndaughter of John 25th Aug. 1616.\" Now, to set against these we have the\r\nburials of: \"Anthony Shakesby the son of John 26th June 1610.\" \"Thomas\r\nShakspeer the son of John 1st July 1612.\" \"Susan Shakspere daughter of\r\nJohn 3rd Aug. 1612.\" \"Katharine Shakespeare d. of John 26th Aug. 1616.\"\r\nOf two of the remaining children, John and Ellen, we have further\r\ninformation; concerning the other, I believe we have an interesting\r\nerror, bearing on the credibility of parish clerks.\r\n\r\nAmong the burials appears that of \"_Jane Shackspeer, daughter of Willm,\r\n8. Aug. 1609_.\" Now, this might have been a daughter of the Bishopsgate\r\nWilliam, or of some country William up in London for a holiday. It might\r\neven have been a hitherto unknown daughter of the poet himself. But I\r\nbelieve that the clerk's mind was wandering when he wrote, and that he\r\nwas thinking of \"William\" when he should have written \"John,\" because\r\nJohn's family seem to have been delicate and have chiefly died young,\r\nand his daughter \"Jane\" would have been just about a year old at the\r\ntime. No other notice of \"William\" or of \"Jane\" appears in the register.\r\n\r\nThe phonetic varieties of the spelling of the name may have been\r\nnoticed, but it is as well I copied all such. Among the Bishop of\r\nLondon's marriage[326] licenses I find on \"May 28, 1631, John\r\nShackspeare of St. Clement's Danes, Bittmaker, Bachelor, 26, had a\r\nlicense to marry Margaret Edwards of St. Bride's Spinster, 28, at same\r\nParish Church.\"[327] The age of John Shackspear coincides with the age\r\nof John Shaxbee, which is the only resembling entry near the date, and\r\nthe trade and the parish are the same. He was duly married in St.\r\nBride's,[328] and soon afterwards christenings began in St. Clement's\r\nDanes. \"12th April 1632, John Shackspeare son of John Shackspeare\r\nJunior, and Margaret, ux.\" \"4th May 1633, Mary Shackespeare, daughter of\r\nJohn Shackespeare, and Margaret, ux.\" \"17th Aug. 1634, Mary Shackspeare,\r\ndaughter of John Shackespeare and Margaret, ux.\" \"3rd March 1635-6 John\r\nShakespear son of John and Margaret his wife.\" The reason for the\r\nrepeated names lies in the burials: \"John Shackspeare son of John 17th\r\nMay, 1632.\" \"Mary Shakespeare daughter of John 16th Julie 1633.\" \"Mary\r\nShakespeare, infant, 1st May 1635.\" The more important entry of the\r\nburial of their grandfather is fortunately clear--\"John Shackespeare,\r\nthe King's Bitmaker, 27th Jan. 1633.\"[329] The name of trade or\r\nprofession was but rarely mentioned in this parish, and in this case it\r\nfixes the State Paper entries. A large sum (£1,612 11s.) due to her\r\nhusband by the Crown was paid to a widow Mary after the death of her\r\nhusband, John Shackespeare,[330] His Majesty's bit-maker, 1638, for\r\nwares delivered to the royal stables, and she had already been paid £80.\r\n\"Warrant to pay to the Earl of Denbigh Master of the Wardrobe £1612, 11\r\n0, to be paid to Mary Shackspeare widow & executrix of John\r\nShackespeare, his Majesty's Bitmaker deceased, in regard of her present\r\nnecessities, in full of a debt of £1692, 11 for sundry parcels of wares\r\nby him delivered for his majesty's service in the Stables, as by a\r\ncertificate appeareth, whereof there has been already paid unto her £80.\r\nSubscribed by order of the Lord Treasurer procured Dec. 18th, 1637, and\r\npaid Jan. 21, 1637-8.\"\r\n\r\nFor some reason her daughter Ellen was made her heiress. Among the State\r\nPapers at Dublin Castle relating to settlements and explanations after\r\nthe Restoration there is a reference to this lady, and there was some\r\ndispute about what she was entitled to receive. \"It appears by an order\r\nof the Revenue side of the Exchequer[331] that Ellen, daughter and\r\nheiress of Mary Shakespeare, of ye Strand, widow, was married to John\r\nMilburne.\" In Mary Shakespeare's will, December 24, 1553, she left to\r\nher daughter, Ellen Milburne, £60; money to her grandchildren Milburne;\r\n£50 to her grandson, John Shakespeare, son of her son John; 10s. to her\r\nsister, Anne Brewer; 5s. to her daughter-in-law, Margaret Shakespeare;\r\n2s. 6d. to Sarah Richardson, her brother's daughter; and the same to\r\nMary Shakespeare, wife of Thomas Allon (proved March 2, 1654).[332]\r\n\r\nThe Mary Shakespeare of St. Martin's parish does not seem to have died\r\nthere. She may have been the Mary Shakespeare, wife of Thomas Allon, of\r\nthe above will, or the Mary Shakespeare who was buried in the Church of\r\nSt. Thomas Apostle,[333] November 14, 1644. There was a John\r\nShakespeare, who might have been one of those three now mentioned, or\r\nwho might have been a fourth of the name, not very far off, mentioned as\r\none of the defaulters by the Collectors of the Loan in the Hundred of\r\nEdmonton, and part of the Hundred of Ossulton, County Middlesex, in\r\n1627.[334]\r\n\r\nThere were Shakespeares further west and further east than the Strand.\r\nAdrian Shakespeare, of St. James's, within the liberty of Westminster,\r\nleft £550 on trust with his brothers-in-law, William Gregory and William\r\nFarron, for his daughter Elizabeth and an unborn child; his father,\r\nThomas Shakespeare, and all his brothers and sisters to have a guinea\r\napiece, residue to his wife Christian, November 26, 1714.[335] Perhaps\r\nhe descended from the William of 1539.\r\n\r\nAt St. George's, Hanover Square, William Fellows, widower, and Margaret\r\nShakespear, spinster, were married May 28, 1730;[336] at St. George's,\r\nHanover Square, William Guy and Rebekah Shakespeare, of St.\r\nMary-le-Bone, March 29, 1758;[337] at St. George's Chapel, Hyde Park\r\nCorner, William Shakespeare and Mary Waight, of St. Giles, Cripplegate,\r\nJuly 29, 1751;[338] James Barnet, of St. James's, Westminster, and\r\nElizabeth Shakespear, February 9, 1760.[339] A George Shakespeare, of\r\nWestminster, Arm., matriculated at Wadham College, June 10, 1785, aged\r\ntwenty-seven.[340]\r\n\r\nManasses Shakespeare, of St. Andrew's, Holborn, widower, and Mary\r\nGoodwin, spinster, of same, married at St. James's, Duke's Place, April\r\n27, 1710.[341]\r\n\r\nBenjamin Shakespear, of the parish of St. Christopher, painter, made his\r\nwill 1707, and bequeathed to his father, Benjamin Shakespear, of\r\nTamworth, in Warwickshire, his wearing apparel, and left a legacy to his\r\nmother Joyce, his wife Judith being sole executrix[342] (proved December\r\n4, 1714).\r\n\r\nIn the records of the Leather Sellers' Company is preserved the\r\napprenticeship of George, son of Thomas Shakespeare, of Arley, county\r\nWarwick,[343] October 12, 1693. George, son of William Shakespeare, also\r\nof Arley, was apprenticed 1732. Thomas Shakespeare, son of George,\r\ncitizen and leather-seller of London, was apprenticed to William\r\nJephson, vintner.[344]\r\n\r\nAn important branch of the family settled in the east. John Shackspeer,\r\nof Rope Walk, Upper Shadwell, appears in 1654. His father has still to\r\nbe found, but his posterity believe he descended from the poet's\r\ngrandfather. I had hoped to satisfy them through the St. Clement's Danes\r\nregisters. But his age at his marriage precludes this, for it gives the\r\nyear of his birth as 1619. The only John that I know to be born in that\r\nyear was John, son of Thomas Shakespeare, gent., baptized July 18, 1619,\r\nin St. Gregory by St. Paul's. I had taken him to be the son of Thomas,\r\nthe Staple Inn student and lawyer of Leicester, but I cannot prove it.\r\nOn June 14, 1654, John married Martha Seeley,[345] and had four sons and\r\nfour daughters, of whom survived Martha, Samuel, Benjamin, Mary, John\r\nand Jonathan. A trade token of his still exists.[346] Ropemaker\r\nShakespeare was summoned, with others, to appear before the Admiralty\r\nregarding a breach of contract for ropes, January 26, 1656-57.[347] John\r\nShakespear, son of John of Shadwell, ropemaker, was apprenticed to John\r\nGrange, of Upper Shadwell, chafer, 1663-64.[348] Jonathan, the youngest\r\nson, born February 6, 1670, succeeded his father, who died 1689. He\r\nmarried,[349] April 26, 1698, Elizabeth Shallet, of Clapham, aged\r\nnineteen, and had thirteen children. Samuel Wilton was apprenticed to\r\nJonathan Shakespeare, citizen and _broiderer_ of London, April 7, 1725.\r\nHe died 1735. The business of ropemaking was carried on by the eldest\r\nson, Arthur, born 1699, who died 1749, leaving the property and business\r\nto his youngest brother John, on condition he brought up his heir to\r\nropemaking. This John, twelfth child of Jonathan, born 1718, married,\r\n1745, Elizabeth, daughter of Colin Currie, and Anne, daughter of the\r\nHonourable John Campbell; and had eleven children. He became Ropemaker\r\nto the Board of Ordnance in succession to his brother Arthur, May 12,\r\n1749; Trustee of Middlesex Turnpike Roads 1751; Ranger of Waltham Forest\r\n1761; Deputy-Lieutenant for Middlesex 1763; alderman of the ward of\r\nAldgate 1767; sheriff 1768. He was originally of the Broiderers'\r\nCompany, as was his father, but was translated from that guild to the\r\nIronmongers', of which he became master 1769.[350] He died 1775. \"_The\r\nalderman used the same coat of arms as the poet, there being but the one\r\nknown._\" It is engraved in Noorthouck's \"History of London,\" ed. 1773.\r\n\r\nThe Shakespear tomb in Stepney Churchyard records his death, and that of\r\nBennet Shakespear, son of Jonathan, 1756, and Jonathan, son of Jonathan,\r\n1768, brothers of the alderman; also Mrs. Elizabeth Shakespeare, his\r\nwidow, February 15, 1807, aged eighty, at Bramdean, co. Hants; Arthur\r\nShakespear, eldest son of the alderman, M.P. for Richmond, in Yorkshire,\r\n1818, aged seventy; his wife Jane, 1805, aged fifty-five; Matthew John\r\nShakespeare, son of Arthur, April 2, 1844; and several children who died\r\nyoung. The sons of the Alderman John Shakespeare and Elizabeth his wife\r\nwere I. Arthur; II. John; III. David; IV. Samuel; V. Colin.\r\n\r\nI. Arthur, the M.P. for Richmond, married Jane, daughter of Sir Matthew\r\nRidley, and had two sons, Matthew John, and Arthur William. His wife\r\ndied in Pall Mall in February, 1805,[351] and he died June 12, 1818, in\r\nAlbemarle Street,[352] aged seventy. His son, Matthew John Shakespeare,\r\nwilled away the Shadwell property to his cousins, the children of Mary\r\nOliver, 1844. The rope-factory was destroyed by fire in the autumn of\r\n1860, but a street in the neighbourhood is still called Shakespeare's\r\nWalk.\r\n\r\nII. John. The second son of Alderman John was born May 6, 1749. He\r\nmarried, in 1782, Mary, daughter and heir of the Rev. William Davenport,\r\nof Bredon, co. Worcester, and of Lacock Abbey, co. Wilts, by his wife,\r\nMartha Talbot, of the old family famed by Shakespeare the poet.\r\n\r\nThe sons of John Shakespear and Mary Davenport, his first wife, were:\r\n(1) John Talbot; (2) William Oliver; (3) Henry Davenport; (4) Arthur.\r\n\r\n1. John Talbot Shakespear entered the East India Company's service, and\r\nhad four sons by Emily, eldest daughter of William Makepeace Thackeray:\r\n(1_a_) John Dowdeswell Shakespear, Lieutenant-Colonel of the Bengal\r\nArtillery, who married Margaret, only daughter of Joseph Hodgson, F.R.S.\r\nHe died without issue, April 6, 1867, aged sixty.[353] (2_a_) William\r\nMakepeace Shakespear, (3_a_) George Trant Shakespear, who both died\r\nunmarried. (4_a_) Sir Richmond Campbell Shakespear, 1812-61, \"youngest\r\nson of John Talbot Shakespear, of the Bengal Civil Service. He came to\r\nEngland with his cousin, William Makepeace Thackeray, for his education.\r\nHe served with distinction in India, was knighted in 1841, the only\r\noccasion on which he returned to England. His cousin, Thackeray, in the\r\n'Roundabout Papers' (Letts's Diary), paid a tribute to his chivalry and\r\nliberality. He married Marian Sophia Thompson in 1844, and died at\r\nIndore, October 28, 1861, leaving a family of three sons and six\r\ndaughters.\"[354] A memorial-stone is raised in memory of him in the\r\ncloister walls of Charterhouse Chapel.[355] Thackeray drew the portrait\r\nof Colonel Newcome from his elder brother, Colonel John Dowdeswell\r\nShakespeare. His eldest son, Richmond Shakespear, Captain H.M. 36th\r\nRegiment N.I., died in India, August 12, 1865. His daughter, Selina,\r\nmarried, in 1868, Lieutenant Ninian Lowis, Bengal Staff Corps.\r\n\r\nMr. John Talbot Shakespear had also four daughters--Emily, Augusta,\r\nCharlotte, Marianne.\r\n\r\n2. The second son of John Shakespear and Mary Davenport, William Oliver\r\nShakespear, was Judge of the Provincial Court of Appeal in the Madras\r\nPresidency. He married Charlotte Maxton, and had five sons and two\r\ndaughters, (1_b_) William, who died young; (2_b_) Henry, a Lieutenant in\r\nthe Royal Navy, who was shipwrecked in a frigate in the Indian Seas,\r\n1833; (3_b_) Charles Maxton Shakespear, Lieutenant-Colonel in the Madras\r\nArmy; (4_b_) Arthur Robert, who died in 1844; (5_b_) George Frederick\r\nShakespear, Lieutenant-Colonel Madras Staff Corps, who was married, and\r\nhad a son born in 1865.[356]\r\n\r\n3. The third son, Henry Davenport Shakespear, was member of the Supreme\r\nCourt of India. He married Louisa Muerson, and had three sons and seven\r\ndaughters. (1_c_) Henry John Childe Shakespear, Commandant of the\r\nNagpore Irregular Horse; (2_c_) Alexander Shakespear, a Judge in India;\r\n(3_c_) William Ross Shakespear, Madras Cavalry, who married Fanny\r\nIsabella, daughter of Sir Robert North Collie Hamilton, of Alveston, co.\r\nWarwick, 1854, and had two sons, William and Robert; he died in 1862.\r\nThe daughters of Henry Davenport Shakespear were Louisa, Harriet,\r\nAugusta, Jane, Agnes, Mary, Henrietta. He died in 1838.\r\n\r\n4. The fourth son of John Shakespear and Mary Davenport, Arthur\r\nShakespear, was Captain in the 10th Hussars, served as aide-de-camp to\r\nLord Combermore during the Peninsular War, and was Brigade-Major of the\r\nHussars at Waterloo. He married, April 19, 1818, Harriet Sophia,\r\ndaughter of Thomas Skip Dyott Bucknall, of Hampton Court. He died in\r\n1845, leaving six sons and two daughters, (1_d_) George Bucknall\r\nShakespear, Colonel Royal Artillery, who married Henrietta Panet. His\r\neldest son was Arthur Bucknall Shakespear. (2_d_) William Powlett\r\nShakespear[357] was a Lieutenant in the 2nd Bombay Fusiliers, and lost\r\nhis life at Samanghur in trying to save a wounded sepoy. (3_d_) Colonel\r\nJohn Talbot Shakespear, who married Emma Waterfield, and had a son,\r\nLeslie, born 1865. (4_d_) Lieutenant-Colonel John Davenport Shakespear,\r\nserved in the Crimean War. He married, in 1855, Louisa Caroline,\r\ndaughter of Robert Sayer, of Sibton Park, co. Suffolk, and had a son,\r\nArthur Franklin Charles Shakespear, 1864, and a daughter, Ida Nea. He\r\nclaimed descent from the poet's family in 1864.[358] (5_d_) Rev. Wyndham\r\nArthur Shakespear, fifth son of Arthur Shakespear, of Boxwell, co.\r\nGloucester, Arm. Exeter College, matriculated May 29, 1855, aged\r\nnineteen, B.A. from Litton Hall, 1860, and M.A. He has held various\r\ncuracies.[359] (6_d_) Robert Henry Shakespear, who married, in 1858,\r\nOctavia, daughter of Charles Fenwick, Consul-General for Denmark. He has\r\na son, Lionel Fairfax Shakespear. His elder daughter, Harriet Blanche,\r\nmarried, 1868, Lieutenant-Colonel James Edward Mayne, Deputy-Judge,\r\nMadras; the younger, Rosaline, married William Sim Murray, M.D.,\r\nsurgeon, 66th Foot, 1867.\r\n\r\nII. John Shakespeare's first wife, Mary Davenport, died in 1793; and he\r\nmarried, secondly, Charlotte, the daughter of ---- Fletcher, Esq., by\r\nwhom he had a son--\r\n\r\n5. Owen, who died unmarried, and two daughters, Georgiana and Henrietta\r\nMatilda. His second wife, Charlotte, died in 1815, and he died January\r\n16, 1825, and was buried at Lacock Abbey.\r\n\r\nIII. The alderman's third son, David, settled in Jamaica, and left a\r\nfamily, whose descendants still exist there. In 1867 the Hon. John\r\nShakespear, grandson of David, was a member of the Legislature and\r\nproprietor of Hodges-Penn, St. Elizabeth's parish.\r\n\r\nIV. I have been unable to find particulars of Samuel, the fourth son.\r\n\r\nV. Colin, the fifth son of the alderman, was in the East India Company's\r\nCivil Service, as collector at Saharapore. He married Harriet Dawson,\r\nand his daughter Harriet married William Woodcock, Esq.\r\n\r\nThe alderman's eldest daughter Sarah married Joseph Sage; his second\r\ndaughter, Anne, John Blagrove, of Cardiff Hall, Jamaica; his third,\r\nMartha, the Rev. John William Lloyd, of Aston Hall, co. Salop; his\r\nfourth, Mary, Laver Oliver, Esq., to whose children the rope-factory\r\ndescended.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the fortunes of the other branches, it is very\r\nclear that the chief modern Shakespeares have descended from the\r\nShadwell stock. John Shakespear, the second son of the Alderman, left a\r\nmemorandum declaring his belief that the family was derived from the\r\npoet's grandfather. There has as yet, however, been found no proof of\r\nany such connection, though it is perfectly possible that it existed. If\r\nRichard, of Snitterfield, was the father of John, Henry, and Thomas,\r\nthere were two possible lines of descent. Henry may have had children\r\nchristened at other places than Snitterfield, whose descent no one has\r\ntraced. Thomas had a son John, born in 1581-82, clearly too old to have\r\nbeen the first John of Shadwell. He _may_ have had a son of the proper\r\nage; but, as I have stated above, I have found no John of the right age,\r\nexcept John, son of Thomas.\r\n\r\nA Hannah[360] Shakespeare, born 1777, is mentioned in the pedigree of\r\nEsterby and Sootheran.\r\n\r\nHenry Shakespear, of London, was a broker Loriner, 1775, connected with\r\nHertford (see p. 137).\r\n\r\nOn June 29, 1794, was baptized Joshua,[361] son of Thomas and Ann\r\nShakespeare.\r\n\r\nA warm eulogy of the charity and virtues of William Shakespeare, Esq.,\r\nof Hart Street, Bloomsbury, who died in January, 1799, aged\r\nseventy-three, is given in the _Gentleman's Magazine_[362] of that date;\r\nand in May of the same year the death is noticed, in Paddington, of\r\nGeorge Shakespeare, Esq., son of the late George Shakespeare, Esq., of\r\nWalton-upon-Thames, and Pimlico, Middlesex.[363]\r\n\r\nM. L. Jeny, in _L'Intermédiaire_, March 25, 1889, states that \"he had\r\nread in _L'Abeille du Cher_ of Friday, November 18, 1836, that a poor\r\nold man of seventy-seven, named George Shakspeare, was found dying with\r\ncold and hunger in the middle of the frightful night of Wednesday\r\npreceding, in Clarence Street, London, and was taken to the Hospital,\r\nand died there. He was one of the poet's descendants.\"[364]\r\n\r\nSo late as November, 1880, there was a Mrs. Anne Shakespeare who died at\r\nBrighton, aged 102.[365]\r\n\r\nThere are several American branches of Shakespeares, some of them\r\nliterary, and two of the name are settled in Vancouver's Island.[366]\r\n\r\nAmong the list of authors[367] we find the names of Alexander\r\nShakespear, on the \"North-West Provinces of India,\" 1848; Edward\r\nShakespear, \"A Book of Divinity,\" 1740; and Sophia Shakespear, 1753, a\r\nbiography; Henry Shakespear, \"Province of Bengal,\" 1824, and \"Wild\r\nSports of India,\" 1860; H. W. Shakespear's \"Refutation of Mr. Tryon,\"\r\n1847; John Shakespear's Hindustani books; Emily Shakespeare's \"Tennyson\r\nBirthday Book,\" 1877; and Mrs. O. Shakespear, a novel, in 1895. Edward\r\nO. Shakespeare, of Washington, U.S.A., has a medical work on\r\n\"Inflammation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Russell French, from whose pages I have gleaned the bulk of the\r\nfacts concerning these modern Shakespeares, expatiates on the glories of\r\nthe later Shakespeare marriages. By the Currie alliance he traces back\r\ndescent to the royal Scottish families of the Bruces and the Stewarts;\r\nby the Talbot alliance he traces back their pedigree to Edward I.; by\r\nthe Davenport alliance he again connects them with the Ardens, through\r\nSir Thomas Leighton and the eighth Lord Zouch, who married Joan,\r\ndaughter of Sir John Denham, by his wife Joan, daughter and heir of Sir\r\nRichard Archer, who married Joan, the second daughter and coheir of\r\nGiles de Arden, grandson of Sir Robert de Arden, the descendant of\r\nTurchil; but these rather tend to glorify the modern branches than the\r\npoet's name.\r\n\r\nIt were to be desired that there were more concerted study of registers\r\nand other records concerning the name. Much more might thus be found,\r\nand much of the energy now dissipated in futile searches might be\r\nutilized in connecting the scattered links, because the study of\r\ngenealogy is the ancient form of the very modern inquiries into heredity\r\nwhich interest so many followers of Mr. Francis Galton. It is after all\r\nworth knowing who were the ancestors of William Shakespeare, what\r\nheroic, chivalric, poetic, philosophic strains went to form the nature\r\nof the perfect poet; and it is of mildly sentimental interest to us that\r\nwe should know whether any of his line is left on the earth. Of\r\nsentimental interest, I say, for rarely, if ever, does genius repeat\r\nitself, nor do different environing circumstances weld and mould genius\r\nin the same way. Its nature is very easy to kill, or dwarf, or distort,\r\nbut it is our excuse for being concerned with those who bear the\r\nhonoured name.\r\n\r\nIn the unsatisfactory inquiries relating to Shakespeare's ancestors I\r\nhave exhausted all that I can find concerning his father's family; but\r\nso much remains to be said concerning his mother's family, that in\r\nconsideration of the old proverb, \"like mother, like son,\" it has seemed\r\nto me worth incorporating into this volume some account of the Ardens.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[312] Churchwardens' Accounts of Thurston Amere and William Combes, from\r\nJune 8, 1538, to May 8, 1540, 48th week, 1st year.\r\n\r\n[313] _Notes and Queries_, Seventh Series, vii. 483, June 22, 1889.\r\nCompare Third Series, iii. 318; Third Series, viii. 418; Savage's\r\n\"Genealogical Dictionary of the First Settlers in New England,\" ii. 528;\r\nJohn Timbs' \"Curiosities of London,\" ed. 1855, p. 238, and ed. 1867, p.\r\n297; \"Annals of St. Helen's, Bishopsgate,\" 221, 322.\r\n\r\n[314] Subsidy Rolls, London, Ward of Billingsgate and others, 39 Eliz.,\r\n146/369, P.R.O.\r\n\r\n[315] Marriage Licenses, Faculty Office, Harl.

C. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew families in the country have a descent so nationally interesting as\r\nthat of the Ardens. Great Norman families who \"came in with the\r\nConqueror\" are numerous enough, but there are few that claim to be\r\n\"merely English,\" and have such a record to show. The fables that have\r\ngrown around the memory of the hero do not invalidate the pedigree.\r\nRohand was Earl of Warwick in the days of King Alfred and King Edward\r\nthe Elder, when the title was an official one, not necessarily\r\nhereditary, save of the King's will. Rohand was a great warrior, and was\r\nenriched with great possessions. He dwelt in the Royal Castle of\r\nWarwick,[368] said by Rous to have been founded by the British King\r\nCymbeline, enlarged by his son Guiderius, and repaired by Ethelfleda,\r\ndaughter of King Alfred, the Lady of Mercia. Rohand had one fair\r\ndaughter and heir, Phillis, or Felicia, who demanded great proofs of\r\nvalour in her suitors. She at last consented to marry the famous hero\r\nGuy, slayer of the Northern Dragon,[369] son of Siward, Baron of\r\nWallingford, whom the Welsh claim as British by descent. Dugdale[370]\r\nsays that in her right Guy became Earl of Warwick, though of course this\r\nwas only possible through the King's favour. Some difficulties are\r\nbrought forward by Mr. Pegge.[371] Some time after his marriage, says\r\nthe legend, Guy went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and on his\r\nreturn, in the third year of King Athelstan, 926, he found the kingdom\r\nin great peril from an invasion of the Danes. They were, however, secure\r\nin their faith in their champion, Colbrand the Giant, willing to leave\r\nthe issue to the result of a single contest between him and any of the\r\nKing's knights. King Athelstan's chief warriors were either dead or\r\nabroad, and he mourned in his spirit. A vision revealed to him that he\r\nmust welcome at the gate of Winchester an unknown pilgrim as the\r\ndefender of the country. The King obeyed the vision in faith,\r\nunwittingly welcomed Guy, and laid on him the responsibility of becoming\r\nthe national champion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WARWICK CASTLE.\r\n\r\n_To face p. 162._]\r\n\r\nFootsore, half-starved, and far from young, the pilgrim required rest\r\nbefore he dared prudently attack the Danish opponent. At the end of\r\nthree weeks, however, he triumphantly encountered the giant, and the\r\nDanes kept their promise and retired. The pilgrim, who refused to reveal\r\nhis name or receive any reward, also departed. He found that his son and\r\nheir, Raynborn, had been stolen away, and that his faithful servant\r\nHeraud was abroad in search of him. Affected by the strange religious\r\nnotions of the day, he returned to Warwick, not to gladden the heart of\r\nhis sorrowing spouse, but to receive charity at her hands among other\r\npoor men for three days, and then to retire to a hermitage at a cliff\r\nnear Warwick, since called Guy's Cliff. There he remained till his death\r\nin 929, in the seventieth year of his age.[372] He sent a herdsman with\r\nhis wedding-ring to tell his wife of his death, bidding her come to him\r\nand bury him properly, and she should shortly afterwards follow him. She\r\nfulfilled his wishes, set her house in order, left her paternal\r\ninheritance to her son Raynborn, and within a fortnight was laid beside\r\nher ascetic hero.\r\n\r\nHeraud succeeded in finding young Raynborn in Russia, to whom, on his\r\nreturn, the grateful King Athelstan gave his beautiful daughter Leonetta\r\nin marriage. He, too, seems to have been of a wandering disposition. He\r\ndied abroad, and lies buried in an island near the city of Venice. He\r\nleft a brave son, Wegeat, or Wigatus, at home to succeed him, who was\r\nnoted for his liberality to the Church, in which virtue, however, his\r\nson and successor, Huve,[373] or Uva,[374] seems to have exceeded him.\r\n\r\nHuve died about the beginning of the reign of King Edward the Martyr,\r\nand Wolgeat, his son, succeeded him. In early life[375] he enjoyed the\r\nspecial favour of King Ethelred, but was deprived, at least for a time,\r\nof his honours and possessions about 1006. It was probably during the\r\ndisorganized state of the earldom, in consequence of his \"evil courses,\"\r\nthat the Danes ravaged it so frequently. Wigod, or Wigotus, his son, a\r\npotent man and a great warrior, succeeded to the earldom, and enjoyed it\r\nduring the latter part of the reign of King Ethelred, and through the\r\nreigns of King Edmund and the Danish Kings. He married Ermenhild, the\r\nsister of the famous Leofric, Earl of Coventry and Leicester in the time\r\nof Edward the Confessor. His son, Ailwin, Earl of Warwick, was\r\ncontemporary with King Edward the Confessor and William the Conqueror.\r\nTurchil, son and heir[376] of Ailwin (Harleian MS., 853, says\r\n\"grandson\"), was Earl at the Conquest. His first wife was the Countess\r\nof Perche; his second, Leverunia, grand-daughter of Leofric. In the\r\nConqueror's Survey he is called _Vice-Comes_ rather than _Comes_, but\r\nthis seems to have arisen from the royal interest in the castle, and the\r\ndirect service he owed the King, though some authorities state that he\r\nwas under Leofric, Earl of Mercia. He fought with William against\r\nHarold, and was ostensibly left in full possession of all his lands,\r\nrights and privileges. He is called Turchil of Warwick by the Normans,\r\nbut Turchil of Eardene, or of the Woodland, by himself, being one of the\r\nfirst to adopt the Norman habit of local names. In Domesday Book, begun\r\nin the fourteenth year of the Conqueror, he is entered as in possession\r\nof forty-nine manors in Warwickshire, among which were Curdworth,\r\nCoughton, Rotley, Rodbourn, Compton (Winyate), Nuneaton. Warwick town\r\nand castle were recorded as belonging to the King. He had but a\r\nlife-interest, however, his son, Siward, receiving none of them as his\r\nheir, but by favour of the King.\r\n\r\nThe title of Earl of Warwick was given by William the Conqueror to Henry\r\nde Novoborgo, or Newburgh, younger son of Roger de Bellomont, Earl of\r\nMellent, and William Rufus added to the gift the whole of Turchil's\r\nlands, including even those given away by himself and his ancestors to\r\nthe Church. It was a hard lesson to friendly Saxon noblemen. A gloss of\r\njustice, or at least of consideration, was shown in the marriage of\r\nHenry de Novoborgo to Margaret, one of the daughters of Turchil, and\r\nsister of Siward de Arderne.[377]\r\n\r\nTurchil's sons were Siward de Ardena, Ralph of Hampton,[378] William,\r\nand Peter the Monk of Thorney, by his first wife, and Osbert by his\r\nsecond wife. Some of their lands were left to the Ardens by grace of the\r\nNovoborgos, who became their overlords. These lands were gradually\r\ndiminished by devotion to the Church, by the increase of the family, and\r\ndivision of the properties, though this was somewhat balanced by wealthy\r\nmarriages.\r\n\r\nSiward by his wife Cecilia had a large family: Hugh de Rotley[379]\r\n(dapifer or sewer to his kinsman William de Newburgh), Henry de Arden,\r\nJoseph, Richard, Osbert, Galfridus, a monk of Coventry, Cecilia,\r\nFelicia. Osbert, his stepbrother, was the father of Osbert, Philip,[380]\r\nPeter de Arden, and Amicia, who became the wife of Peter de Bracebridge,\r\nand the ancestress of the Bracebridges of Kingsbury, seat of the Mercian\r\nKings. Her brother Osbert had daughters only, Amabilia and Adeliza, who\r\nleft no children.\r\n\r\nThe main line was carried on by Henry de Arden, son of Siward, who\r\nmarried Oliva, and whose eldest son and heir was Thomas de Arden, of\r\nCurdworth (9 John). He had also William de Arden of Rodburn, Herbert,\r\nand Letitia. Thomas de Arden married Eustachia, widow of Savaricius de\r\nMalaleone, and had a son of his own name, Sir Thomas de Arden of Rotley\r\nand Spratton, who took part with Simon de Montfort and the rebellious\r\nBarons, 48 Henry III. This cost him dear. In 9 Edward I. he handed over,\r\neither in sale, lease, or trust, his lands in Curdworth to Hugh de\r\nVienna; to the Knights Templars the interest he had in Riton; in 15\r\nEdward I., to Nicholas de Eton the manor of Rotley, and to Thomas Arden\r\nde Hanwell and Rose his wife, Pedimore, Curdworth, Norhull, Winworth,\r\nEchenours, and Overton, and made a covenant with William de Beauchamp\r\nand Maud, his wife, of all his fees throughout England.\r\n\r\nIt is not probable that Turchil, the last Saxon Earl of Warwick, bore\r\nanything that might be strictly called armorial bearings. When the\r\nheiress of the Novoborgos married into their family, the Beauchamps\r\nadded to their own the Newburgh arms. But they used them in a peculiar\r\nway, as if they considered they were associated, not so much with the\r\nfamily as with the earldom. Only the eldest sons bore the Chevron\r\nchequy, the rest of the family bore the Beauchamp crosses crosslet. In\r\nsome such way the Ardens also seem to have made a similar distinction,\r\nthough in later times the meaning was occasionally forgotten, and the\r\nusage became confused.\r\n\r\nDrummond suggests that the Ardens might also have borne these arms to\r\nsuggest that they, too, had a claim to the earldom of Warwick. The arms\r\nThomas bore were Chequy or and azure, a chevron gules, which his\r\nancestors assumed to show they held their lands from the Earls of\r\nWarwick, whose Chevron was Ermine on the like field.[381]\r\n\r\nThe descendants of William of Rodburne,[382] the second son of Henry de\r\nArdern, were more fortunate than their cousins. Thomas de Draiton was\r\nthe elder, and William de Rodburne the younger. Thomas married Lucia (6\r\nJohn), and had Thomas de Arden of Hanwell, Sir Robert de Arderne de\r\nDraiton, and Ralph.[383] Thomas,[384] who bore as arms Ermine a fesse\r\nchequy, or and azure, as now borne, married Rose, daughter of Ralph de\r\nVernon, with whom he obtained the lordship of Hanwell. He was living in\r\n1287, and had a son, Thomas, who presented to the church of Holdenby,\r\n1334. This Thomas married Johanna de ---- (?), and had an only daughter,\r\nJoan, who married Sir John Swynford. Ralph married Alicia de Bellocampo.\r\n\r\nSir Robert de Arderne de Draiton married Nichola,[385] widow of William\r\nde Boutvilein. His son, Sir Giles, had a son, also Sir Giles. This\r\nlatter had an only daughter, Margaret, who married Ludovic Greville, and\r\ncarried Draiton into the possession of that Warwickshire family.\r\n\r\nRalph, son of Ralph, the second son of Thomas of Hanwell, married\r\nIsabella, daughter of Anselm de Bromwich, and lived at Pedmore,\r\nWarwickshire, 16 Edward II. In 17 Edward II. he was certified to be one\r\nof the principal esquires in the county. His son, Sir John, was knighted\r\n33 Edward III., and bore for his arms the same as his ancestor, Thomas\r\nof Hanwell: Ermine, a fesse chequy or and az. He had only one daughter\r\nand heir, Rose, who married Thomas Pakeson, afterwards an outlaw. To\r\nJohn succeeded in Curdworth his brother Henry, whose wife was Elena, the\r\nfirst to establish himself in Park Hall, which was confirmed to him by\r\nSir John de Botecourt, 47 Edward III., releasing him of all service,\r\nsave only of an annual red rose. He was devoted to Thomas de Beauchamp,\r\nthen Earl of Warwick, who granted him several other manors, also on\r\npayment of a red rose. In 4 Richard II. his niece, Rose, released to him\r\nher interest in Pedmore, Curdworth, Winworth, Sutton, and Norhull, of\r\nher father's inheritance. Sir Henry bore the fesse chequy or and az.,\r\nwith three crescents for difference,[386] before his brother's death\r\n(see Roll, Edward III., and arms in Lapworth Church). He left his son,\r\nSir Ralph, heir, who served under the Earl of Warwick at the siege of\r\nCalais.\r\n\r\nRalph settled on his mother, Elena, for life, the manors of Wapenham and\r\nSulgrave, in Northamptonshire, with remainder to his brothers Geoffrey\r\nand William. He married Sibilla (2 Henry V.), and left by her two sons,\r\nRobert and Peter.[387] Robert was from the age of eight years a ward of\r\nJoan Beauchamp, Lady of Bergavenny. He married Elizabeth, daughter and\r\nheir of Richard de Clodeshall; was in the King's service, was Sheriff of\r\nthe County, and Knight of the Shire. He sided with the Yorkists in the\r\nWars of the Roses, was taken, attainted of high treason by James, Earl\r\nof Wiltshire, and other judges appointed to try such cases, and was\r\ncondemned. He was executed on Saturday after the Feast of St. Laurence\r\nthe Martyr, 30 Henry VI. The custody of his lands was granted to Thomas\r\nLittleton, Serjeant-at-Law, Thomas Greswold and John Gamell, Esquires.\r\n\r\nTwo years after his death his son Walter obtained the King's precept to\r\nhis escheator to hand over the lands of his mother's inheritance to him,\r\nand shortly afterwards he secured his father's also. He married Eleanor,\r\ndaughter of John Hampden of Hampden, in Buckinghamshire, and appears in\r\nthe register of the Guild of Knowle, 1457, with his \"wife Alianore.\" He\r\nhad a large family, each of them in some special point interesting to\r\nthe genealogist, and therefore worthy of some attention and of careful\r\ndetail. It must not be forgotten that his father's attainder and the\r\nWars of the Roses had temporarily crippled the resources of the family.\r\n\r\nWalter Arden's will, July 31, 1502, is preserved at Somerset House,[388]\r\nan interesting will in many ways. His eldest son and heir was John,\r\nEsquire of the Body to Henry VII., who was to pay 20 marks for his\r\nfuneral. \"Item. I will that my sonne Thomas have during his lief x marc,\r\nwhich I have given him; and that my sonne Martyn have the manor of\r\nNafford during his lief, accordyng as I thereof made him astate yf it\r\ncanne be recorded, and yf not, thenne I will that the same Martyn and\r\nevery of my other sonnes, Robert, Henry and William have eche of them 5\r\nmarc by yere during eche of their lives, and that my feoffees of my\r\nlandes make eche of them a sufficient astate of londes & tenements to\r\nthe yerely value of 5 marc during every of their lives.\" He left his\r\nwife, Eleanor, executrix, Edward Belknap and John Bracebridge, Squiers,\r\nand John Boteler of Solihull, overseers, \"Richard Slystre, Vicar of\r\nAston, John Charnell[389] & Thomas Ardern,[390] Squiers, witnesses.\"\r\n\r\nDugdale seems to have read the will, and is interested in the mortuary\r\nbequest, but, curiously enough, supposes Martin to be older than Thomas.\r\nPerhaps this error arose from the testator's desire to settle Natford\r\nupon Martin. This does not seem to have been so settled. Martin had his\r\nfive marks, married an heiress, Margery East, settled at Euston, in\r\nOxfordshire, and appears in the Visitations there, associated with the\r\nEasts and the Gibbons. Robert was the Arden made Yeoman of the King's\r\nChamber, a presumption made definite by Leland's[391] remark that \"Arden\r\nof the Court was younger brother to Sir John Arden, of Park Hall.\" On\r\nFebruary 22,[392] 17 Henry VII., he received a Royal Patent as Keeper of\r\nthe Park at Altcar, Lancashire; another, as Bailiff of Codmore,[393]\r\nDerby, and Keeper of the Royal Park there; a third gave him Yoxall for\r\nlife,[394] apparently, however, for a payment of £42.\r\n\r\nA Robert Arden, who had been Escheator to the Crown for Nottingham and\r\nDerby under Henry VII., received a new patent 2 Henry VIII.[395] On June\r\n28, 7 Henry VIII., order to cancel five recognizances amounting to £200;\r\none made by Robert Arderne, of Holme, co. Notts, may concern the same\r\ngentleman.[396]\r\n\r\nHenry seems to have died young. William settled at Hawnes,[397] in\r\nBedfordshire, bore as arms three cross-crosslets fitchée or, on a chief\r\nof the second, a martlet for difference. He seems to have died before\r\nhis eldest brother. He married Elizabeth, daughter of John Francklin of\r\nThurley in County Bedford, and widow of George Thrale. His son Thomas\r\nmarried Anne, daughter of Richard Bowles of Wallington and widow of\r\nThomas Gonnel. His daughter Joan married John Moore; his daughter\r\nElizabeth married John Lee of Harlington.\r\n\r\nThomas certainly survived Sir John, Henry, and possibly also William.\r\nSir John married Alice d. of Richard Bracebridge of Kingsbury, and died\r\nin 1526. His will was drawn up on June 4 of that year.[398] After\r\nvarious bequests to churches, he left some special heirlooms to his son\r\nand heir, Thomas, to his son John an annuity from Natford of five marks\r\na year for life, with other land, and gifts to him, his wife, and _their\r\nheirs_. \"Item. I will that my brothers Thomas, Martin & Robert have\r\ntheir fees during their lives.\" That is, it may be remembered, ten marks\r\nfor Thomas, and five marks each for the other two. \"Item. I will that\r\nRauf Vale and Hugh Colyns[399] have their fees as they have had during\r\ntheir lives.\" Bequests of furniture were left to \"my daughter Geys\r\nBraylys,\" \"my daughter Katerine _Muklowe_,\"[400] \"my daughter Brown,\"\r\n\"my daughter Margaret Kambur,\" \"my sister Margaret Abell,\" \"my sister\r\nAlice Buklond,\" \"my son Thomas Bralis.\" To Joane Hewes, Agnes Abell,\r\nJohn Charnell, various remembrances, his son Thomas to be sole executor,\r\nSir John Willoughby overseer; witnesses, Martin Ardern, Robert Ardern,\r\nSymon Broke, clerk; John Charnell, John Croke, Rauf Vale. The will was\r\nproved June 27, 1526.\r\n\r\nWhere was Thomas, son of Walter, meanwhile? I have only been able to\r\nfind two of the name contemporary with the cadet of Park Hall. A Thomas\r\nArden of Saint Martin's Outwich, London, citizen and clothworker, on\r\nNovember 29, 1549, drew up a short will,[401] leaving his wife, Agnes,\r\nhis sole heir and executrix, proved January, 1549. I endeavoured to\r\nlearn if by chance he had come from Warwickshire, but the\r\napprentice-books of the company do not begin early enough. There was a\r\ncommercial family of Ardens in London, of whom he more probably was a\r\nmember. The possibility of his being a Warwickshire man I thought worthy\r\nof careful consideration, but have been able to bring no further facts\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nThere was also a Thomas Arden of Long Itchington mentioned in the\r\nSubsidy Lists, whose will is preserved at Lichfield.\r\n\r\nThe other Thomas Arden was settled at Wilmecote, in the parish of Aston\r\nCantlow, on lands formerly owned by the Beauchamps. There is no record\r\nhow he acquired them. Aston Cantlow[402] had been settled, with the\r\ncastle and Honour of Bergavenny, upon Sir William de Beauchamp, second\r\nson to Thomas, Earl of Warwick. He died 12 Henry IV., and Richard\r\nBeauchamp, Earl of Worcester, his son and heir, inherited all his lands.\r\nRichard's daughter and heir, Elizabeth, married Sir Edward Neville, a\r\nyounger son to Ralph, Earl of Westmorland, who was forthwith summoned to\r\nParliament as Lord Bergavenny. Dugdale gives us the arms depicted on the\r\nroof of the chancel of Aston Cantlow Church, three varieties: \"Gules, a\r\nfesse betwixt six cross-crosslets or\" (Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick);\r\n\"Argent 6 cross-crosslets fichée Sable, upon a chief Azure two mullets\r\nor\" (Clinton, Earl of Huntingdon); \"Argent, 3 cross-crosslets fichée\r\nSable upon a chief Azure a mullet and a Rose Or.\" But Dugdale does not\r\nknow the family this represents. Could it be a variety of the Ardens?\r\n\r\nThe Thomas Arden who resided here paid subsidy of 26s. 8d. on £10 land,\r\nbeing one of the largest landholders in the parish. He bought certain\r\nlands at Snitterfield on May 16, 16 Henry VII., associated with certain\r\ngentlemen whose names are suggestive, as I have shown on page 28. John\r\nMayowe transferred his property to Robert Throgmorton, Armiger,[403]\r\nafterwards knight, Thomas Trussell[404] of Billesley, Roger Reynolds of\r\nHenley in Arden, William Wood of Woodhouse, Thomas Arden of Wilmecote,\r\nand Robert Arden, the son of this Thomas Arden. We know that Robert\r\nThrogmorton was an intimate friend of the Ardens of Park Hall, and his\r\nassociation with Thomas of Wilmecote strengthens the supposition that\r\nthe latter was the son of Walter. We know that this Thomas was the\r\nfather of Robert Arden, who was the father of Mary, Shakespeare's\r\nmother, and her six sisters. It does not seem unlikely he bore arms, and\r\nwas the Esquire witness of Walter Arden's will, _who has never been\r\nlocated elsewhere_. If he bore arms, it is more than likely that, as a\r\nyounger son, they were derived from _the Beauchamps_, and might even\r\nhave been those found by Dugdale in the Aston Cantlow Church, where he\r\nwas buried. It is probable that Robert bore the cross-crosslets with a\r\ndifference, as did his contemporary, William Arden of Hawnes. We have at\r\nleast Glover's[405] testimony that among the arms of Warwickshire and\r\nBedfordshire are \"Arden or Arderne gu, three cross-crosslets fitchée or;\r\non a chief of the second a martlet of the first. Crest, a plume of\r\nfeathers charged with a martlet or.\" When, therefore, John Shakespeare\r\nmade application to impale the arms of his wife in his new coat, it\r\nmight seem natural that the fesse chequy, arms of the head of the house,\r\nshould be struck out, and those substituted more customary for a younger\r\nson, and probably borne by Thomas, his wife's grandfather, or by Robert\r\nArden, his wife's father.\r\n\r\nThomas Arden, the son of Sir John, succeeded to Park Hall and the other\r\nfamily estates in 1526. He married Mary, daughter of Sir Thomas Andrew\r\nof Charnelton, by whom he had a large family: William, the eldest;\r\nSimon, the second; George, the third, slain at Boulogne; Thomas, a\r\nstudent of law; and Edward. His daughter Jocosa, or Joyce, married\r\nRichard Cade, of London (see visitation of Hertfordshire, 1634);\r\nElizabeth married--Beaupré, Cicely married Henry Shirley, Mary married\r\nFrancis Waferer.\r\n\r\nWilliam, the eldest son, died before his father. Simon, the second son\r\nof Thomas of Park Hall, was a wonderful man, of whom there will be more\r\nto say elsewhere. He was elected Sheriff of the County in 1569,\r\nand bore, while in Warwickshire at least, the arms three\r\ncross-crosslets[406] and a chief or, without a difference. Shortly after\r\nthat time he purchased the property of Longcroft, in the Manor of\r\nYoxall, Staffordshire, and his descendants bear the fesse chequy, and\r\nare noted in another county history.\r\n\r\nThe will of William Arden does not seem to have been noted by the family\r\ngenealogists, probably because it was drawn up in London. The Calendar\r\nat Somerset House enters it as \"William Arden,[407] of St. Brigyde,\r\nLondon, and Saltley,[408] Warwickshire,\" 7 July, 36 Henry VIII. Its\r\ndetails shed much light on the fortunes of the family, especially in\r\nrelation to the other family wills. He had married Elizabeth, the\r\ndaughter of Edward Conway, of Arrow, and left two sons and eight\r\ndaughters. He desired to be buried in the \"Parish Church of Saint\r\nBrigyde in Fleet Street, within the suburbs of London,\" and left \"to my\r\nyoungest sonne, Francis Arden, all my purchased land, which I purchased\r\nof my grandfather's youngest son, John Arden, and another part lying\r\nwithin the Lordship of Saltley.[409] Item, I bequeath to him the lease I\r\nhave taken of my Lord Ferris for 31 years, which also lyeth within the\r\nLordship of Budbrooke, so that he come to his full age, and during his\r\nnonage, the profits thereof to be taken up by mine overseers to the use\r\nof my daughters. If it happen the said Francis to dye without lawful\r\nissue, then I will my eldest sonne and heire, Edward Arden, when he\r\ncometh to his full age, to enjoy the said purchased land and lease to\r\nhis heires. Item, I bequeath to the said Francis £6 13s. 4d., to be payd\r\nyearely during the term of his naturall life, by the hands of my eldest\r\nsonne, Edward Arden, when he cometh to his lands. Item, I give unto my\r\neight daughters, Anne,[410] Ursuley, Brigid, Barbara, Joyce, Jane,\r\nUrseley, and Fraunces Arden the whole rent that my ferme beareth me,\"\r\netc. \"I bequeath to my brother, Edward Arden, my black Satin cote.\" \"I\r\nbequeathe my long gowne eggyd with velvet to my father, Thomas Arden, in\r\nrecompense of the money which he lent me, whom I make the Overseer of\r\nthis my will, with my father-in-law, Edward Conway.\" Edward Arden, his\r\nson and heir, was to be sole executor. The witnesses were: Christopher\r\nDrey, Francis Waferer (his brother-in-law), and John Tayloure, Vicar of\r\nSt. Brigyde, and it was proved April 14, 1546, by John, afterwards Sir\r\nJohn Conway, uncle of the heir.\r\n\r\nWilliam's father, Thomas, died in 5 Elizabeth, 1563. I have not traced\r\nhis will. Edward, son of William, succeeded him. This Edward had been\r\nward to Sir George Throckmorton, of Coughton (though his grandfather was\r\nalive), and he married Mary, third daughter of Sir Robert Throckmorton.\r\nBrodesley,[411] Dudston, and Hybarnes were delivered to him 7 Elizabeth,\r\nand in 15 Elizabeth he was called upon to prove his title to Curdworth\r\nand to Berewood[412] Hall, which had been given by Hugh Arden to the\r\nCanons of Leicester (Henry II.), and after the Dissolution purchased by\r\nhis grandfather, Thomas, and uncle, Simon, for £272 10s., with a yearly\r\nrent of 30s. 4d., and settled on William, 37 Henry VIII. Various\r\npurchases of land are recorded in Coke's \"Entries.\"[413] He impaled the\r\npark of Minworth on the other side of the Tame, to add to that of his\r\nown Park Hall.[414]\r\n\r\nEdward seems to have been highly respected in his time, and was Sheriff\r\nof the County in 1575.[415] But he had offended Leicester[416] by\r\nrefusing to wear his livery (as many of the gentlemen of the county were\r\nproud to do) and by disapproving openly of his relations with the\r\nCountess of Essex before her husband's death. Leicester waited his time.\r\nEdward Arden's sons were Robert (who married Elizabeth, daughter of\r\nReginald Corbet, Justice of the Royal Pleas, about 1577), Thomas,\r\nFrancis. Of his daughters, Catherine married Sir Edward Devereux, of\r\nCastle Bromwich; Margaret, John Somerville, of Edreston; Muriel, William\r\nCharnells, of Snareston, Leicestershire; and Elizabeth, Simon\r\nShugborough, of Napton, co. Warwick.\r\n\r\nEdward Arden bore the family arms: Ermine, a fesse chequy or and azure.\r\nCrest: On a chapeau azure, turned up erm., a boar passant or. Motto:\r\n_Quo me cunque vocat patriam._\r\n\r\nHe appointed Edmund Lingard to Curdworth Church, 1573.\r\n\r\nEdward Arden was a temperate follower of the old faith; but his\r\nson-in-law, John Somerville, an excitable youth, seemed to chafe under\r\nthe increasing oppression of the Catholic Church and its adherents.[417]\r\nThe evil reports concerning the Queen and Leicester increased the\r\nfriction. Shut out from travel or active exercise, as all Catholics then\r\nwere by law, he studied and pondered, and his mind seemed to have given\r\nway in his sleepless attempts to reconcile faith and practice. He\r\nstarted off suddenly one morning before anyone was awake, attended only\r\nby one boy, who soon left him, terrified; and when he reached a little\r\ninn on the lonely road by Aynho on the Hill, he spoke frantically to all\r\nwho chose to hear that he was going to London to kill the Queen.[418]\r\nThen followed arrest, examination before Justice D'Oyley, a march to\r\nLondon with twelve guards,[419] examination in the Gatehouse,\r\nimprisonment in the Tower. Thereafter went forth the mandate to arrest\r\nEdward Arden, his wife, Francis Arden, of Pedmore, his brother,\r\nSomerville's wife and sister, and the priest, Hugh Hall. Sir John\r\nConway, his wife's grand-uncle, was also commanded up to London, and\r\nseems to have been confined for a time. Examinations, probably under\r\ntorture, followed fast on each other. John Somerville, Edward Arden, his\r\nwife and brother, and the priest, Hugh Hall, were tried, found guilty,\r\nand condemned to the traitor's death. Hugh Hall is said to have turned\r\nQueen's evidence, but I have found no proof of it. Somerville and Arden\r\nwere carried forth from the Tower on December 19, 1583, to Newgate, in\r\npreparation for their execution on the morrow; Somerville was found two\r\nhours afterwards strangled in his cell; Edward Arden suffered the full\r\npenalty of the law December 20, 1583.[420] Robert of Leicester had his\r\nrevenge. Mrs. Arden and Francis[421] seem to have suffered a term of\r\nimprisonment, and then to have been released.\r\n\r\nThis first noble victim of the tyrannical Royal Commission was praised\r\nby all the writers of his time, and pitied by all Europe. Burleigh lived\r\nto be ashamed of his part in his death; and in his \"Life\" one can still\r\nread in the index \"On the Case of Arden\" an explanation which has been\r\nexcised from the text.\r\n\r\nIt is more than probable that the active part that Sir Thomas Lucy took\r\nin his arrest told more on the fortunes and feelings of young\r\nShakespeare than the fabulous deer-stealing story. The touching tragedy,\r\nto which Froude has given but little attention or study, is given in\r\nfull detail in the State Papers. The _traitor's_ lands, of course, fell\r\nto the Queen, and were granted to Edward Darcy.[422] But Robert\r\nArden,[423] \"who was a prudent person\" (doubtless fortified by his\r\nbrother-in-law's interest, and his own knowledge of the law), by virtue\r\nof an entail executed on his marriage got back by degrees most of his\r\nfather's lands. He found, however, every tree in his parks had been cut\r\ndown by Darcy, who seems to have been a difficult person to deal with,\r\nas may be gathered from Simon Arden's petition (p. 185); this Robert\r\nlived to a great age, dying on February 27, 1635. His son and heir, Sir\r\nHenry, who had been born April, 1580, had predeceased him in 1616.[424]\r\nHe had married Dorothy, daughter of Basil Fielding, of Newnham, and had\r\none son, Robert, and four daughters. Robert seems to have been a\r\nbrilliant youth, but he died single at Oxford. In the Bodleian[425] are\r\nsome verses deploring his loss. His four sisters were his coheirs:\r\nElizabeth, wife of Sir William Pooley, of Boxsted, in Suffolk;\r\nGoditha,[426] wife of Herbert Price; Dorothy, wife of Hervey Bagot;\r\nAnne, wife of Sir Charles Adderley, of Lea.\r\n\r\nIn Worcestershire, near Stourbridge, there is a parish of Pedmore, and a\r\nhall of the name that seems at one time to have belonged to the Ardens,\r\nas well as the Pedmore Manor, near West Bromwich, Warwickshire. By the\r\nkindness of Mr. W. Wickham King, now resident there, I am told that\r\n\"Mistress Joyce Arden\" was buried there in 1557; Jane Ardern and Hugh\r\nHall were married in 1560; Alice Ardeney and Thomas Carter married 1578;\r\nwhile John Arden, son of Mr. Robert and Mistress Elizabeth, was\r\nchristened there in 1578. Frances Arden and Edward Wale married 1658;\r\nArthur buried 1668, and Judith Arden, widow, 1682. The arms in the\r\nchurch are those of the Park Hall Ardens, and \"Mr. Robert\" was the heir\r\nof Edward (p. 41 and notes).\r\n\r\nThe Pakingtons of Worcester quarter Ermine on a fesse componé or, and\r\naz. an annulet for Arden.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[368] Dugdale's \"Warwickshire,\" 372; Drummond's \"Noble British\r\nFamilies\"; \"Guy of Warwick,\" ed.

He\r\nwas much trusted by his father and nephew, and was elected Sheriff of\r\nWarwickshire in 1569, when he bore as arms three cross crosslets\r\nfitchée, and a chief or.[427] His first wife was Margaret; his second\r\nChristian,[428] widow of Thomas Bond, of Ward End. In a catalogue of all\r\nthe noblemen and gentlemen resident in Warwickshire, 1577-78, by Henry\r\nFerrers, of Baddesley, is mentioned Edward Arden, of Park Hall, and\r\nSimon Arden, of Saltley, his uncle;[429] and in the Subsidy for\r\nWarwickshire, 1581, he is mentioned as one of \"those collecting, and not\r\nassessed themselves.\"[430] During the first half of Elizabeth's reign he\r\npurchased Longcroft, in the parish of Yoxall, Staffordshire, a property\r\nthat had previously been in the family. In 18 Elizabeth (1576) he found\r\none light horse for the royal service there, and paid to the Subsidy of\r\n1590, 26s. 8d. for his lands at Yoxall, valued at £10.[431] He seems,\r\nhowever, to have got into trouble in his old age. The draft of a\r\npetition of his (_circa_ 1595-98) is preserved among the Longcroft\r\npapers,[432] which is well worthy of being transcribed:\r\n\r\n     \"_To the most honourable the Lord High Treasurer of\r\n     England._\r\n\r\n     \"The most humble petition of Simon Arden, of the age of 100\r\n     years or thereabouts, praying your good Lordship's aid in\r\n     his owld age against the great wrongs and oppressions\r\n     offered by Edward Darcie, Esquire, one of the grooms of her\r\n     Majestie's Privy Chamber.\r\n\r\n     \"As by the enclosed may plainlie apeare:\r\n\r\n        {The Pedigree.

And\r\n     after that the same was granted to the said Edward Darcie,\r\n     your Lordship did likewise very honorably apporcion how much\r\n     thereof should be yearely paid unto me by the said Edward\r\n     Darcie, and how much otherwise, according to which\r\n     aporcionment the said Edward Darcy paid his part thereof\r\n     unto me foure or five yeares, and about six yeares sithence\r\n     denyd so to do, urging me with seutes in the Court of\r\n     Requests, and in the Honourable Court of Exchequer Chamber,\r\n     and at the Common Law. Also for the space of vi yeares now\r\n     together seeking by this countenance to oppress me. The said\r\n     Robert Arden payeth unto me the porcion of the said annuity\r\n     apointed by your Lordship's order, or rather more thereof\r\n     than he was charged with by your order, and I have desired\r\n     but ye residew of Mr. Darcie. I have had judgment against\r\n     him in the Common _Place_, he hath removed the record into\r\n     the King's Bench by writ of Error; so yt by injunction out\r\n     of the Court of the Exchequer Chamber to entertain time and\r\n     delay me til death hath wholy interred my ancient bodie\r\n     already more than half in grave, knowing, _Mors solvit\r\n     omnia_, by my death my cause wil be remeadiless.\r\n\r\n     \"Be therefore so much, my good Lord, as to take my cause\r\n     into your own hands, and for God's sake to end it. I protest\r\n     mine adversary hath caused me to spend more then such an\r\n     annuity is worth to purchase. Age wold have ease, which is\r\n     expedicion in causes of suit and molestacion, and expedicion\r\n     in justice is the most Honour that may be; which is no small\r\n     part of your Honor's comendacion. Almighty God long preserve\r\n     you in all felicity, that this Realm of England may more and\r\n     more long take profit of your most wise and grave counsels.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps on his coming to Longcroft he found the old Arden arms there.\r\nBefore the grant to his grand-uncle Robert there had been Ardens in\r\nYoxall.[434] Certain it is that after that date they appear in Longcroft\r\nHall and in the parish church. The headship of the family fell to his\r\nheirs in 1643. Simon's son[435] Ambrose[436] married Mary Wedgewood\r\n1588, and died 1624. His son Humphrey[437] married Jane Rowbotham at\r\nMarchington, December 1, 1630. Of his family, Henry married Catherine\r\nHarper, but died without children, November 26, 1676; John, of Wisbeach,\r\nmarried Anne, and died without heirs, April 2, 1709, aged 84;[438]\r\nHumphrey, of Longcroft, who married the daughter of ---- Lassel, and\r\ndied January 31, 1705, aged 74. His daughters Elizabeth and Katharine\r\ndied unmarried. His son Henry married Anne Alcock, and died 1728, aged\r\n63. Humphrey's son and heir, John, was born 1693, and died 1734, aged\r\n40. He married, first, Anna Catherine Newton, and second, Anne, daughter\r\nof the Rev. John Spateman, Rector of Yoxall, 1730. He was High Sheriff\r\nof the County in 3 George II. His son, Henry Arden, of Longcroft,\r\nmarried Alethea, daughter of Robert Cotton, Esq., of Worcester, and died\r\nJune 22, 1782. The full pedigree is given, and the monuments at Yoxall\r\nare described in Shaw's \"Staffordshire,\" and in French's \"Shakespeareana\r\nGenealogica.\" Descendants still survive in this country and the\r\nColonies.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[427] Fuller's \"Worthies.\"\r\n\r\n[428] Administration of goods of Christian Arden, wife of Simon, 1563\r\n(Lichfield Wills).\r\n\r\n[429] Nich., \"Col.

John Arden and Agnes, his wife, of Longehychyngton.\r\n\r\n\"1504. Richard Arden and Margaret, his wife, and for the souls of John\r\nand Johanna, their parentes, of Longeychyngton.\r\n\r\n\"1506.

Alicia Arderne, and for the soul of William.\"\r\n\r\nOn turning to the Subsidy Rolls to find any further notice of the Ardens\r\nof Long Itchington, I found only the following: \"14 and 15 Hen. VIII.\r\nCo. Warr., Knighton Hundred, Bilton [the next parish to Long\r\nItchington].[439] Thomas Arderne, land, 4 marks, 2/6. Solks. Henry\r\nArderne in goods 40/- 4d.\" The latter is twice repeated.\r\n\r\nIn the same Guild Register appears as member:\r\n\r\n\"1496. Robert Arderne, Master of Arts, Rector of Lapworth.\"\r\n\r\nHe does not appear in the preserved pedigree, as Robert, the son of\r\nWalter, who died 1502, was in the King's service. The Warden and\r\nscholars of Merton College appointed Robert Ardern, Master of Arts, to\r\nthe Rectory of Lapworth, January 10, 1488. On the rood loft of the\r\nchurch are the arms of Sir Henry Arden:[440] Ermine, a fesse chequy, or\r\nand az., with a crescent for difference, arms, by some thought to be the\r\nparson's.\r\n\r\nHenry de Arden,[441] in the time of Henry II., had two sons: Thomas of\r\nCurdworth[3] and William de Rodbourn.[442] The descent of Thomas we have\r\nalready noticed, as well as the descent of Thomas Arden, of Drayton,\r\nelder son of William Arden de Rodbourn. The second son of William was\r\nanother William of Rodbourn, killed in 17 Henry III. He married Avisia,\r\ndaughter of Robert de Kyngeston, and had also a son, William of\r\nRodbourn, whose heir was William, who sold the manor in 1369.\r\n\r\nDugdale says that Little Grafton was called Arden's Grafton because it\r\nwas bought by William de Arden in 10 John. In 52 Henry III. William de\r\nArden was certified to hold it of the Earl of Warwick; but he\r\ntransferred it to Edward I. in exchange for Offord, near Aston Cantlowe,\r\nin the parish of Wootten Wawen.\r\n\r\nA seal used by William D'Arderne, clerk, of Offord, Warwickshire, is\r\npreserved in the British Museum,[443] appended to a deed in which he and\r\nJohn D'Arderne were concerned, 1366. It has a shield of arms, three\r\ncross-crosslets fitchée, on a chief a lion passant, on the border: \"S.\r\nNicholai de Ardena.\" I have not traced a Nicholas. But Nichola de Arden\r\npresented John de Arden to Cotesbrook Church, Northampton, May, 1361\r\n(see p. 195).\r\n\r\nAmong other charters in the same collection occur the seals of--\r\n\r\nThomas de Arderne, of Newton, co. Warwick, 1280-90, on a shield, a fesse\r\nchequy Ardern, \"Sigillum Secreti.\"[444]\r\n\r\nThomas de Arderne, Lord of Peddymore, co. Warwick, 1281, on a shield\r\nchequy, a chevron, \"Sig. Thome de Arderne.\"[445]\r\n\r\nThomas de Arderne, 1286, a shield chequy, a chevron, \"S. Thome de\r\nArderne.\"[446]\r\n\r\nWilliam de Ardena de Hamtune (_i.e._, Hampton in Arden, Warwickshire)\r\nused a seal with a pointed oval shield thereon, a lion rampant\r\ncontourné, _circa_1188-98.[447]\r\n\r\nDugdale says concerning Hampton in Ardern,[448] that it is not _quite_\r\ncertain that Ralph de Arderne was a son of Turchil.[449] He is mentioned\r\nin 5 Stephen and in 33 Henry II. as a Justice Itinerant. Hampton in\r\nArden was not altogether his own, but his son Robert purchased it for\r\n500 marks. Robert was a clergyman, Archdeacon of Lisiaux, in Normandy,\r\nand gave his estate here to his brothers Peter and Roger. Peter became a\r\nclerk also, and gave his share to Roger, whose sons were William de\r\nArdena, 5 Henry III.; Walter, a Clerk; Roger, a Clerk. William's\r\nchildren were: Hugo de Ardena, a Justice of Assize, 35 Henry III.;\r\nOliva, who married Robert le Megre; and Hawisia, who married Richard\r\nPeche. Hugh's sons were William and Richard. William sided with the\r\nMontforts, was pardoned, but was soon after slain by Richard de l'Isle.\r\nHe left no family; his brother Richard was an idiot; and his estates\r\nwent to the heirs of his aunts, John Peche and William le Megre[450]\r\n(Plea Rolls, Ed. I.).\r\n\r\nThere is so much confusion regarding the most distinguished of these\r\nearly Ardens, that I would like to examine his story more closely.\r\nDugdale, as I have already noted, is not absolutely certain that Ralph\r\nde Ardern, of Hampton, was a son of Turchil, but believes it\r\nsufficiently to put him in the pedigree. Yet he goes on to state that\r\nthis Ralph was a justice itinerant in various reigns. Now, it is not\r\nonly dates that make this impossible: Turchil had married, first, the\r\nCountess of Perche, and, second, Leverunia; and Ralph de Arderne, of\r\nHampton, is given as of the first family. But the mother of Ralph the\r\njustice was a De Bohun. I propose, therefore, tentatively, to consider\r\nthat the first Ralph de Hampton married a De Bohun, and hope to find the\r\nrecords true of an eldest son Ralph, brother of Robert, the Archdeacon\r\nof Lisiaux, of Peter the clerk, and of Roger of Hampton. This view is\r\nsupported by many facts, and it gives _time_. Ralph was at the height of\r\nhis power in 1188, the very date at which William de Ardene, of Hampton,\r\nthe son of Roger, draws up a deed and affixes his seal.[451] According\r\nto Dugdale, this should be his grandson. The name of Ralph's son and\r\nheir is Thomas, not Roger. It was very unusual for a noble family to\r\nbring up the eldest son to the Church, and yet the Archdeacon of Lisiaux\r\nis considered by Dugdale as the eldest son of Ralph, who gives up his\r\ninheritance to his brothers. But if we find a Ralph to be the eldest\r\nson, we can easily account for his giving up the Hampton in Arden home.\r\nHe had made his fortunes elsewhere. Ralph was in high favour with the\r\nKing,[452] Henry II., and had married Amabilia, daughter and coheir of\r\nRanulph de Glanville,[453] the great lawyer, author, statesman, soldier,\r\nand crusader, who, while Sheriff of York, had made prisoner William the\r\nLion of Scotland, and laid the King of England under an obligation.\r\nRalph's mother was a daughter of Savaric FitzCana, and sister of Ralph,\r\nGelduin, and Savaric FitzSavaric. Ralph FitzSavaric having died without\r\nheirs, on the death of his uncle Savaric, Franco, the son of Gelduin,\r\nlaid claim to his vast possessions in England and the fief of Bohun in\r\nNormandy. It is believed that Gelduin had married within the forbidden\r\ndegrees, without dispensation, and that this was the reason that Ralph\r\nde Arderne put forward his mother's claims. Henry II. decided in his\r\nfavour at a court at Caen in 1187. But on the accession of Richard I.,\r\nRalph fell into disgrace, ostensibly through some delay in rendering his\r\naccounts at Westminster while Sheriff of Hereford, and Henry's decision\r\nwas reversed 1189.[454] But it was evidently a doubtful question. Franco\r\ndied in 1194, and when his son and heir Engelger came of age, 1198,\r\nRalph de Arderne revived his claim, which was settled by a compromise.\r\nAfter the disturbances in Normandy, 1208, a new dispute arose between\r\nEngelger, the son of Franco FitzSavaric, and Thomas, the son of Ralph\r\nArden, which ended in a new compromise.\r\n\r\nThe offices held by Ralph were numerous. He was Sheriff of Hereford\r\n1184-89,[455] and also justice itinerant. He married a second wife in\r\n1194, Agnes de la Mara, heiress of the Barony of Holgate in Shropshire,\r\nafter which he regained royal favour. He received a gift from the King\r\nof land in Essex, for which he paid[456] £362 16s. 8d. He was made\r\ncustodian of the temporalities of Canterbury at the time of the troubles\r\nthere Bailiff of Pont-Audemar in Normandy, 1198; in 1202 attended King\r\nJohn at La Suse in Anjou; in 1203 was sent on an embassy to Otho, King\r\nof the Romans; in 1204 went to Flanders on the King's service. He was\r\nsaid to have acted as justice at Shrewsbury, 1208, but Foss[457]\r\nbelieves this was his grandson, and states that Coke says so. Ralph de\r\nArderne endowed the Priory of Butey, Sussex, founded by Ralph de\r\nGlanville, with half the town of Bawdsey. He founded the Priory of\r\nShulbrede, near Midhurst, and endowed it with half a knight's fee in\r\nLavington. His son Thomas was engaged in a lawsuit[458] with his aunt\r\nabout the partition of his grandfather Glanville's property. \"Thomas de\r\nArdern, et Radulphus filius Roberti ponunt loco suo Mag. Will. de Lecton\r\n_versus_ Will. de Auberville et Matilda uxorem ejus,\" etc. There is no\r\nmention of Thomas after 14 John, 1213. Lands in Hereford, Sussex, Essex,\r\nand Yorkshire were known to have belonged to him, and many scattered\r\nbranches in later periods may represent his descendants. I have not\r\nfound his arms; were they the same as William de Ardern of Hampton's,\r\nalready referred to?\r\n\r\nThough Shakespeareans are only concerned with the Ardens who remained in\r\ntheir own county, genealogists are interested in the fortunes of the\r\nwhole family. A volume would be necessary for a complete account, and at\r\npresent I only attempt to collect and preserve the scattered facts I\r\nhave found in various printed and manuscript authorities.\r\n\r\nIt is too often taken for granted that individuals do not belong to a\r\nfamily because their names do not appear in the pedigrees collected at\r\nthe Visitations. We know that the descendants of younger sons and\r\ndaughters are frequently omitted, and the sons and daughters themselves\r\noccasionally ignored. For instance, the Sir Robert Arden who was\r\nexecuted in the time of Henry VI., 1451, is stated[459] to have left\r\nseven children, but the name of his heir, Walter, is alone preserved.\r\nSuch omissions are more likely to have occurred in earlier times. The\r\nArdens frequently held land in more counties than one, and thus may\r\nappear in county histories as doubles; while their general use of common\r\nChristian names at other times makes it difficult to separate recorded\r\nincidents. Wills, inquisitions, and other records often strangely bring\r\ninto closer relationship individuals not known to be connected, and the\r\nsevere test of dates often separates those supposed to be near in blood.\r\n\r\nThe main line had estates in Northampton. Robert de Arden had a charter\r\nof free warren in Wapenham and Sudborough.[460] In 7 Henry IV. Wapenham\r\nwas assigned as dower to Elena, widow of Sir Henry de Arden, by Ralph\r\nhis son, with remainder to Geoffrey de Arden, his brother (see p. 170).\r\nAfter the death of Elena and Geoffrey it reverted to Ralph, and to\r\nRobert, his son, who in 20 Henry VI. received the King's pardon for\r\nalienating it without licence. The manor of Sulgrave[461] was sold by\r\nthe Traffords to Sir Henry Arden, and it remained in the family until\r\nSir Robert sold it in 20 Henry VI. Laurence Washington, Mayor of\r\nNorthampton 1538, had a grant of the dissolved priory of St. Andrews\r\nthere. On April 26, 1564, William Arderne of Sulgrave[462] left to his\r\nsister Mary all the portion his father, Richard Arden,[463] had left\r\nher, and all his own goods. He left a legacy to Robert,[464] son of\r\nLaurence Washington, and Laurence was the overseer of his will. There is\r\npreserved a bond by John Ardern, Laurence Washington, and others for\r\n£100, July 4, 1587.\r\n\r\nAn Adam de Arden, clerk, was incumbent of Croughton 1218. Another Adam\r\nwas Rector of Thornhagh and Bolewyck 1336 and of Barby 1361. Nichola de\r\nArden presented John de Arden to Cotesbrook Church, May, 1361.\r\nThomas de Arderne was incumbent of Laxton, July 9, 1310, and of\r\nClopton-on-the-Wold, 1325. Robert de Ardern, clerk, is mentioned August\r\n16, 1322. Thomas de Ardern, diac., was presented to Nether Heyford,\r\n1455. Eustachia de Ardern, patron of Holdenby, 1263, presented Ralph de\r\nArdern, and Thomas, son of Thomas Ardern, of Hanwell, recognised as\r\nco-patron Thomas Ardern, of Rotley.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[439] The will of Thomas Arden of Long Itchington was proved 1552, at\r\nLichfield.

But the next owner was Eustace de Arden,[465] son of\r\nAlexander and Agnes Arden, in the time of Henry II. The first Eustace,\r\nborn about 1140, was probably the Eustachius de Arderne who granted\r\nWatford Church to the Abbey of St. James. His son, also named\r\nEustace,[466] died in 1213. The dower of his widow Hawisia was in\r\nWatford and Silvesworth, and Ranulph III., Earl of Chester, became her\r\nsecurity that she would not marry again without license from the\r\nKing.[467] Her two sons were Eustace[468] and John de Arderne. Eustace\r\ndied in 4 Edward I., 1221, leaving a son Eustace. The line ended with\r\nfour daughters, coheiresses--Aveline, Mary, Jane, Elena, 1275. The arms\r\nof Eustace were: Gules, on a chief argent, a label azure.[469] I have\r\nwondered if the following entries concerned younger sons of this family:\r\n\"To Master William of Watford 50 marks for his expenses going as a\r\nmessenger to the King beyond the sea\";[470] and, \"Paid to William de\r\nWatford, Keeper of the Queen's palfreys.\"[471]\r\n\r\nJohn, the second son of the second Eustace and brother of the third,\r\nreceived either an original grant, or the confirmation of a grant, from\r\nthe Earl of Chester of the Manor of Aldford, in Cheshire. He was\r\nprobably the son-in-law of the Richard de Aldford who preceded him.[472]\r\nAs the Earl of Chester was Hawisia's surety, he may have been her son\r\nJohn's guardian. John afterwards granted part of this fee to Peter, the\r\nEarl's clerk, and another part to Pulton and Chester Abbey. On November\r\n28, 1213, he compounded with the King for his father's annual payment\r\nfor lands in Watford, and granted to Eustace, his brother, the lands he\r\nhad received there from his father. He executed this deed in Aldford,\r\nAugust, 1216. In that year he received, as a Knight of Ranulph, Earl of\r\nChester, then in the Holy Land, a grant of the lands of Geoffrey de\r\nSautemaris. Sir Walkelyn, his son, succeeded him in or before 1237-38.\r\nThrough his wife, Agnes de Orreby, he acquired Elford, in Staffordshire,\r\nwith Alvanley, Upton, and other manors in Cheshire. He was frequently at\r\nCourt, as his attestations to various charters prove, about 41 Henry\r\nIII. In 1264-65 he granted the Manor of Alvanley to his eldest son, Sir\r\nPeter, who succeeded to all the family estates on the death of his\r\nfather, about 1268. He bore arms based not on those of Eustace de\r\nWatford, or on those of the Earl of Chester, from whom he held land, but\r\non those of William de Beauchamp, who had succeeded to the Earldom of\r\nWarwick in 1257, as if to claim descent from the Warwickshire family.\r\nHis seal appears first in 17 Edward I. in a release to Sir John de\r\nOrreby of a debt due.[473] It bore a shield with three crosses crosslet\r\npattées, a chief Arderne, with the motto, \"Frange, lege tege.\" See also\r\nthe charters in the British Museum.[474] His son and heir by Margery,\r\nhis wife, was Sir John, who married Margaret, daughter of Griffin ap\r\nMadoc, Lord of Bromfield, of royal Welsh extraction.[475]\r\n\r\nSir John de Arderne at the tournament at Stepney, 2 Edward II., in the\r\nretinue of the Earl of Lancaster, bore \"Gules, 10 crosses crosslet, and\r\na chief or.\"[476]\r\n\r\nBut it is said that after his marriage the Arden arms were temporarily\r\nvaried to gules, crusule or, and a chief or.[477]\r\n\r\nIn 9 Edward II. he purchased part of Haselover from Geoffrey\r\nSalveyn.[478]\r\n\r\nIn that year the \"Nomina de Villarum\" gives the name of \"Sir Henry de\r\nArdena\" as Lord of Elford. John's name, however, is given in the list by\r\nthe Lieutenant of the Knights and men-at-arms of the county, 17 Edward\r\nII., 1324; and he was one of the Knights summoned to attend the great\r\ncouncil at Westminster, 17 Edward II. John and Margaret had two\r\nsons--John, who succeeded to Aldford, Alderley, Alvanley, and Elford, 19\r\nEdward III., and Peter, afterwards of Over Alderley. John married,\r\nfirst, Alice, daughter of Hugh de Venables, and had by her two sons,\r\nJohn and Peter, and a daughter Margaret. His second wife was Joane,\r\ndaughter and heiress of Sir Richard de Stokeport, by whom he had no\r\nissue; and his third wife was Ellen Wasteneys, by whom he had two sons,\r\nThomas and Walkelyn, born before marriage, and two daughters, Isabel,\r\nwife of Sir Hugh Wrottesley, and Maud, wife of Robert Leigh, of\r\nAdlington, and a son, born after marriage (about 1341), who evidently\r\ndied soon.\r\n\r\nThen occurred an extraordinary hitch in the history of primogeniture.\r\nHis eldest son, John, had died without issue before his father. Peter,\r\nthe second son, and natural heir of his brother and father, then aged\r\ntwenty-four, on his father's death found by the inquisition[479] that he\r\ndied possessed of \"no lands,\"[480] all his vast possessions being\r\nsettled on himself and his wife Ellen only for life, and secured by a\r\ndeed of gift, in reversion to Thomas, the elder illegitimate son of\r\nEllen Wasteneys. By an appeal, however, to the courts, based on the\r\nprevious settlement on his great-grandfather, Peter, the legitimate heir\r\nrecovered Alvanley. He married Cicely,[481] daughter and heiress of Adam\r\nde Bredbury, who inherited Hawarden from her father, and henceforward\r\nAlvanley and Hawarden were the chief seats of the Cheshire Ardens. It is\r\nevident, therefore, that the root-meaning of Hawarden, or Harden, has no\r\nrelation to the family name.\r\n\r\nThe favoured Thomas received Aldford, Etchells, and Nether Alderley,\r\nCheshire; and Elford, Staffordshire. He was knighted before 1359, and\r\ndied 1391. He married Katherine, daughter of Sir Richard Stafford,\r\nheiress of Clifton Campvile, Pipe, Haselover, and Statfold, and was\r\nburied in Elford Church, where his beautiful marble monument still\r\nremains. He is represented in full knightly armour, wearing a rich\r\ncollar, with the letters \"S.S.\" interwoven, his basinet bearing the\r\nwords \"The Nazarene.\" His wife lies by his side, richly robed, and also\r\nwearing a collar with \"S. S.\" His son and heir, John, born at Elford,\r\nMarch 12, 1369, was over twenty-one at his father's death,[482] 15\r\nRichard II. He married Margaret Pilkington, and died in 1408, leaving no\r\nmale heir.[483] A large monument in memory of him in Elford Church is\r\nalmost decayed.\r\n\r\nIn his inquisition, his nearest male relatives are stated to be Robert\r\nde Legh, of Adlington, aged forty, and Hugh de Wrottesley, aged eight.\r\nHis only daughter was Matilda, aged twelve, who was granted Alderley and\r\nEtchells only. She married Thomas de Stanley.[484] John's widow,\r\nMargaret, took for her second husband Sir Robert Babthorpe, and died\r\n1423. Her Inquisition Post Mortem is very interesting. She died seized\r\nof Nether Alderley only, which reverted to her daughter, Matilda\r\nStanley.\r\n\r\n\"The Prince of Wales as Earl of Chester _versus_ Margaret, formerly wife\r\nof John, son of Thomas de Arderne, to determine the right to the manors\r\nof Aldford, Alderdelegh, and Echells, the advowsons, and 10 marks a year\r\nfrom the manor of Upton, in Wyrehale. It mentions that Thomas and\r\nWalkelyn were illegitimate; but Walkelyn died _s.p._, and pleaded the\r\nsettlement\" (Chester Pleas, 10 Henry IV., m. 9, _Genealogist_, New\r\nSeries, vol. xv.).\r\n\r\nAnother Chester Plea Roll records the suit of Richard, son of John de\r\nRadcliff and Matilda his wife, against Isabella, formerly wife of John\r\nde Legh, Chivalier, for land in Modberlegh, which John de Ardene gave to\r\nJohn de Legh for his life, with remainder to John, son of John de Legh\r\nand Matilda, daughter of John de Ardene, and to the heirs of the bodies\r\nof John de Legh and Matilda (_Genealogist_, New Series, vol. xiii.).\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Arden and Sir John bore as arms the three crosses crosslet,\r\nand the chief or, the same as the legitimate family.\r\n\r\nHugh, the son of Peter Arden, of Alvanley and Hawarden, carried on the\r\nmain line, and had full possession of his estates by 1372. He married\r\ntwice--first, Agnes Hulme, by whom he had Peter and Ralph;[485] and\r\nsecond, Cicely de Hyde,[486] by whom he had John, who lived in the\r\nservice of the King. The seal of Peter, son of Hugh de Arderne, of\r\nMacclesfield, co. Chester, 1372,[487] is preserved in the British\r\nMuseum, and bears three crosses crosslet and a chief Arderne. Old and\r\ninfirm, Hugh was granted exemption from military service in 1408.\r\n\r\nCharles Arden, son of John, son of Peter, married Elizabeth Radcliffe in\r\nEdward III.'s time, and through her inheritance became owner of\r\nTimporley, and founded the Timporley branch of Ardens.\r\n\r\nThe pedigree of the family is given _in extenso_ in Drummond, Earwaker,\r\nOrmerod, and the Visitations of Cheshire, so that it is unnecessary to\r\nrepeat it here. Further intermarriages with the Hydes[488] are recorded.\r\nRalph Ardern, of Harden, led his tenantry against the Royalists, 1642,\r\nand died 1657. Sir John, head of the family, in 1660 was Sheriff of\r\nCheshire. One of his brothers was the Rev. James Arden, Dean of Chester,\r\n1691.\r\n\r\nJohn, who was Sheriff in 1760, married Sarah Pepper, who brought Pepper\r\nHall into the family. Their son, Richard Pepper Arden, Chief Justice of\r\nthe Common Pleas, was created Baron Alvanley[489] 1801. He had three\r\nsons, John, William, and Richard. The title became extinct 1857.[490]\r\nThe arms were the three crosses crosslet and a chief or; crest, a double\r\nrow of ostrich feathers out of a ducal coronet.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious will at Somerset House[491] (January 9, 1614) of\r\nThomas Arden, of Hornsey, gentleman, who seems to have been connected\r\nwith this family. After trifling legacies, he leaves his lease in\r\nCheshire of Melton Farm to his dear and well-beloved sister, Ann Ardern.\r\n\"Executors, my beloved sister Anne Arderen, ever faithful friend, and\r\nRichard Drape of Hornsey gent.\"--proved January 17, 1614. But another\r\nsimilar will of the same man was again proved, 1615, by Anne and another\r\nco-executor.\r\n\r\nIn Berry's \"Sussex Genealogies\" we find that George Ardern, son of\r\nGeorge Ardern, born in Chester, came to Chichester, married Catharine,\r\ndaughter and coheir of Robert Palmer, Esq., and had three sons--George,\r\nJohn, and Richard. Richard married Margaret, daughter of Thomas Green,\r\nand had three sons and a daughter--Thomas, George, Richard, and\r\nCatherine.\r\n\r\nAn important official Arden was John, who in the reign of Henry V. was\r\nClerk of the Works.[492] His patent was renewed under Henry VI., and\r\npayments are recorded to him for making the tomb of King Henry V.[493]\r\nin St. Peter's, Westminster, of Caen stone, £23 6s. 8d.; for repairs in\r\nthe Tower; in the palace of Westminster; and in the castle of\r\nWallingford. He was also Clerk of the Works at York, and in 22 Henry VI.\r\nwas made Baron of the Exchequer, and had various grants.\r\n\r\nFoss believes him to be the father of Sir Peter Arderne,[494] also in\r\nroyal service. In 18 Henry VI. he was deputy of William de la Pole, Earl\r\nof Suffolk, chief seneschal of the Duchy of Lancaster. He took the coif\r\nFebruary 14, 1443, and was made King's Serjeant and Chief Baron of the\r\nExchequer May 2, 1448. Dugdale does not mention him as a Judge of Common\r\nPleas, but he received his patent July 7, 26 Henry VI., and must have\r\nheld double office. In 1461 his patents were renewed, but in the\r\nfollowing year there was a new Chief Baron, though Sir Peter retained\r\nhis other offices. He had a tun of wine annually for life. His will[495]\r\nis so interesting from a literary point of view, as well as a\r\ngenealogical one, that it is worthy of fuller notice. He and his wife\r\nKatharine had founded a chantry in Netteswell, Essex, and a chapel in\r\nthe parish of Latton, Essex, where they resided. He left to these and\r\nmany other charitable purposes handsome legacies; and to his wife, Dame\r\nKatharine, he left his \"daily Primer,\" much plate and furniture, a\r\ncrucifix, the furniture of a chapel, his \"book of legends in English,\r\nand his English translation of 'Bonaventura de vita et passione\r\nChristi.'\" To his \"son, John Bohun,\" armour, and his book in English of\r\n\"Boys de Consolacione Philosophiæ, with the booke of Hunting therein.\"\r\nTo his daughter, Anne Bohun, furniture, and a French booke, \"Giles de\r\nReginum Principii.\" To his daughter, Elizabeth Skreene,[496] furniture\r\nand a mass-book. To his son, John Skreene, \"myne owne volume of old\r\nstatutes with the Register, and ye new Lawes therein; my newe statutes\r\nand a boke of termes of parchemyn, and a good boke compiled of Law with\r\na yallow leather covering, and a booke of law of termes of 2 Ed.

Other\r\nremembrances follow. His interest in the forest of Galtuce, in\r\nYorkshire, in the towns of Hoby and Esmeswold, to be sold to pay his\r\ndebts. His wife to have all the residue if she remain unmarried. The\r\nmanors of Monkhall and Enfield to his wife, reverting to his daughters;\r\nthe manor of Swale in Godilston to his wife, and to any heir she\r\nchooses. Executors: Dame Katherine Arden, his wife, and Master\r\nThomas[498] Ardern, his brother, and others, February 20, 1466, proved\r\nJuly 10, 1467. A rubbing of the sepulchral brass in memory of Sir Peter\r\nand his wife[499] at Latton is preserved in the British Museum. His arms\r\nwere: Or, three pellets azure on a chief gules, three lozenges\r\nargent.[500] Bobbingworth Hall, Ongar, Essex,[501] was conveyed to\r\nRichard Ardern 1423, and to Sir Peter Ardern 1446. In that year also\r\nGregory Wery released Latton Hall, Harlow Half Hundred, to Peter Ardern\r\nand his heirs for ever.[502] The will of the Guy Arden,[503] nephew of\r\nSir Peter, was drawn up July 24, 1498. He left legacies to the master,\r\nevery brother, and every servant of St. John's College, Cambridge; to\r\nSir Christopher Wright, Fellow of St. John's, his journal; to Mr. Bowes,\r\nof King's College, his great beads; to the Lady Prioress of Crabhouse,\r\n\"2 portuess of written hande and x^s, and to her convent 6^s 8^{d}.\" The\r\nresidue to Dr. William Robinson and Master John Basse, Bach. of Civill\r\nLawe.\r\n\r\nA curious group of wills seem to prove that the Alice Green who married\r\nJohn Holgrave, one of the Barons of the Exchequer, must have previously\r\nmarried an Arden,[504] and had children by him. Sir John Holgrave's will\r\nwas drawn up on August 6, 1486.[505] After church bequests, he leaves to\r\nhis son Thomas some plate, \"of the gift of Elizabeth Greene, my\r\nmother-in-law,\" forty marks to his son John, and fifty marks to his\r\ndaughter Elizabeth. \"To the brotherhood of the Clerkes of London, wher I\r\nam a brother, 13/4.\" To Katherine Coleyn, 100^{s}; to Alice Green,\r\n100^{s}; to _Richard Arden_, towards his learning, 10 marks, and one of\r\nhis best gowns; to Master Walter Ardern, parson of Cheyham, 100^{s}; the\r\nresidue to his wife Alice. Executors: Alice, his wife, Thomas Holgrave,\r\nhis son, Master Walter Arden, and Richard Ardern. If his sons and\r\ndaughters die without heirs, his estate to go to Richard Arden, his\r\nson-in-law, and Master Walter Arden. His wife Alice made her will in\r\n1487.[506] Her son Thomas was to have fifty marks, her son John £100,\r\nand her daughter Besse £100. \"Also to Richard, my son, 100 marc; to Mr.\r\nWat, my son, 100 marc; to Katerine, my daughter,[507] £40; to Elizabeth,\r\nmy daughter, 10 marc.\" \"_Cousin Alice Skreene_\"[508] was to have 10\r\nmarks also. There were gifts of plate to her sons Thomas and John and\r\ndaughter Besse, to Richard and Mr. Water, her sons, and her daughter\r\nKatharine. Executors: My son Mr. Walter Ardern, my son Richard Ardern,\r\nmy son Thomas Holgrave. Overseers: Master Litton and my daughter\r\nKatharine. Proved September 21, 1487.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned Master Walter Arden,[509] parson of Cheyham, Surrey,\r\nSeptember 13, 1482, left legacies to every household in his parish; and\r\n10 marks each to Richard, my brother, to Thomas, my brother, to John, my\r\nbrother, to Elizabeth Ardern, my sister, to Elizabeth Holgrave, my\r\nsister, to the daughters of my sister Collyns, and to various cousins.\r\nAlso to the daughters of Mr. Codyngton, and 10 marcs to poor scholars.\r\nTwenty shillings to reparation of St. Mary's, Cambridge. The residue to\r\nRichard Arden, my brother. Executors: John Deye, Sir John Norwood, and\r\nJohn Codyngton, the younger, with 10 marks each. Proved October 2, 1492.\r\n\r\nSeven years afterwards Richard Arden, of Bosham,[510] Sussex, and of\r\nBermondsey, left legacies to various churches, and to his brothers\r\nThomas and John Holgrave. Johane, his wife, sole heir and executor,[511]\r\nwith reversion to John Holgrave. Overseers: John of Lee, of Addyngton,\r\nRichard Culpepper, of Ardyns Lee, and John Chaloner, Huwild, 1499.\r\n\r\nThe name \"Collins\" makes one think there may be some connection with the\r\nfollowing: Walter Arden,[512] of Hampton, in Highworth, Wilts, makes his\r\nwill on April 1, 1540. He leaves to Thomas Ardern, the elder son of my\r\nbrother, Richard Arden, £40 and farm stock; to Johane Arden, my servant,\r\nsister to Thomas, £20; to Margaret Sewell, my daughter, £100 and all my\r\nlands; to Elizabeth Palmer, my sister's daughter, and to other\r\ngrandchildren, money gifts. My daughter Elizabeth sole executrix; Simon\r\nYate supervisor.\r\n\r\nThe goods of Edith Arden, Hampton Turvil, Wilts, were administered in\r\n1578, and those of Richard Arden, of Chilton, 1641.\r\n\r\nJohn Arden,[513] of Hampton Turville, Highworth, Wilts, yeoman, August\r\n16, 1585, leaves half his goods to his wife Amy as long as she is\r\nunmarried, reversion to Thomas Arden, his son; to Editha Collyns, £6\r\n13s. 4d.; to Agnes Collyns, 20s.; to Elizabeth Collyns, 20s.; to Walter\r\nArden, my godson, 10s.; to Elizabeth Arden, the daughter of my brother,\r\nHenry Arden, a sheep; to each of the children of my brother Richard a\r\nsheep. All the residue to my son, Thomas Arden, executor. Overseers,\r\nbrothers Thomas and Virgill Arden, who were also witnesses. Proved\r\nNovember 28, 1585.\r\n\r\nThe will was proved of Thomas Arden, of Hampton Turvill, Highworth,\r\nWilts, yeoman, February 3, 1621. His wife Agnes to live in the house in\r\nconvenient rooms and have £10 a year, payable out of the manor of\r\nWestthroppe, in the parish of Heynes; or, if she does not like her diet,\r\n£20 a year. He stands possessed for a terme of 1,000 years in the moitie\r\nand one-half part of one-fifth of the manor of Westthropp, to be given\r\nto eldest son, Thomas Arden, and heirs male; if no heirs, to John Arden,\r\nhis second son; then to Edward Arden, his third son; to Nicholas Arden,\r\nhis fourth son, each of which are to have £100. To Henry Arden, my son,\r\n£4 a year, and his dwelling in the house at Hampton and good usage\r\nthere, and if he does not like his treatment, to have £10 a year. To\r\nJohn, my son, my tenements in Birdlip, Gloucester; to Edward, my son, a\r\nhouse in Highworth and the Chantrey House. My kinsman, Thomas Arden, of\r\nFairford, Gloucester, oweth me £40. I give this to Agnes, my daughter,\r\nwife of Henry Gearinge. Thomas, his son, sole executor. His loving\r\nbrother, Thomas Stratton, and Henry Gearing, overseers.[514]\r\n\r\nThe Ardernes of Cottesford and Kirtlington, Oxford, bore the same arms\r\nas the Park Hall Ardens, with a mullet for difference;[515] but the\r\nrelationship is not given in the pedigree of the Visitation. It only\r\nstarts with Robert Arden of Cottesford, whose son William[516] married\r\nAgnes Stotesby of Evenley, and he had, first, Thomas, second, John,\r\nthird, William, fourth, George. His daughter Alice married Thomas Thorne\r\nof Northampton. Thomas predeceased his father and John succeeded, who\r\nmarried, first, Isabel Woodward, widow of Richard Swillington, who bore\r\nhim a son, Leonard, who became a priest, and Eleanor, married to Anthony\r\nYate. John married, second, Isabell, daughter of John Gifford, of\r\nTwyford, Bucks, by whom he had John Arden, of Cottesford (who married\r\nCatharine, daughter of John Cheyney, and whose son was John Arden),\r\nRichard, and Anthony, who married Margery, daughter and heir of Walter\r\nCoxe, of Kirtlington, through whom he acquired this property. Anthony's\r\nfamily consisted of John, Thomas,[517] Henry,[517] Alice, Margaret, and\r\nMary.\r\n\r\nThere were Indentures drawn up between Henry VIII. and \"John Arderne, of\r\nCotisford\" (see Cromwell's \"Remembrances,\" 1534).\r\n\r\nThe will of John Arden, of Cottesford, Oxfordshire, gentleman,[518]\r\nNovember 12, 1557, furnishes us with some particulars. He wished to be\r\nburied before the cross in Cottesford beside his father's tomb. To\r\nKatharine,[519] his wife, if she claimed no jointure, an annuity of £13\r\n6s. 8d. (to be paid by brother Richard Arden, in the lordship of\r\nWillaston), 300 marks, and the house they dwell in, with half the\r\nfurniture, etc. \"To every of the children of Roger Arndern, of Evynley,\r\nnow living, twenty shillings.\" To his cousin, Robert Thorne, to his\r\ncousin, Nicholas Thorne's wife, to his sister, Eleanor Yates, legacies.\r\n\"To John Ardern, son of Anthony Ardern,[520] my young brother,\"\r\ntenements, etc.; failing whom, they were to pass to Henry Ardern, third\r\nson of his said brother. To the wives of Richard and Anthony, his\r\nbrothers, four angels. To Richard, his brother, all his titles to\r\nCottesford and Willaston, and to Anthony, his younger brother, the title\r\nof his lease of Shelliswell. Residue to his brothers, the executors;\r\ndesiring Mr. Walter Wright, Doctor of the Civil Law and Archdeacon of\r\nOxfordshire, to be overseer. Witnesses, Nicholas Thorne, Walter Prior,\r\nand John Tench. \"Memor.: Laurence Pate, parson of Harwicke, had to hide\r\nthe will in his coffer till Arden's death.\"[521]\r\n\r\nRobert Arden, of Berwyck, writes to the Earl of Leicester about Mr.\r\nArden, of Cotesford, March 1, 1588.\r\n\r\nJohn Arden in 1595 prays some Court service. But in January, 1595-96, he\r\nhas been sent to the Marshalsea on suspicion of treason, when he was\r\nabout to marry. Nicholas Poutor, in October, 1601, promises to pay £100\r\nto John Ardern, of Kirtlington, in October, 1602.\r\n\r\nThese Ardens are evidently connected with those of Evenly in\r\nNorthamptonshire. Thomas Arden, of Evenly, died between 1520-26; Roger\r\nArden, of Evenly, 1537-40; William Arden, of Norton, 1548-61.[522] The\r\nInventory of the goods of John Arden, of Evenley, gent., was taken\r\nNovember 9, 1559. On the back of this is a settlement, dated 1576,\r\nbetween John and Thomas Arden, and others.[523]\r\n\r\nIt is not clear whether the Cottesford Ardens are in any way connected\r\nwith a family residing at Henley-on-Thames, co. Oxon. In a will of\r\nRobert Arden he left everything he had to his wife Margery, August 8,\r\n1493;[524] and on February 24, 1525, John Arderne, of Henley,[525] drew\r\nup a will leaving to his daughter Margery £6 13s. 4d.; and to his wife\r\nJohane all his lands and tenements, with remainder, first to his son and\r\nheir, Humphrey Arderne, after him to his son Robert, after him to his\r\nson John, after him to his son Edmund or their heirs. His wife Johane,\r\nexecutrix; James Hayles, overseer. Proved May 4, 1526.\r\n\r\nBeyond the more important habitats, we find Ardens in many English\r\ncounties. John Yate, the elder, of Bockland, Berks, gent., in his will,\r\nJanuary 12, 1578,[526] mentions his son-in-law, Mr. John Arderne, and\r\nAnthony Arderne, son of his daughter Bridget, deceased. John Daubeney,\r\nof Woolmeston, gent., April 6, 1625, mentions his brother-in-law, Guy\r\nArden, of West Chinnock.[527]\r\n\r\nThe State Papers mention this family.\r\n\r\nThe names of such of the guard under the Earl of Leicester \"as have been\r\nlately preferred to your excellency in Holland, and by whom:\r\n\r\n\"John Arden, by Mr. Thomas Dudley, January 12, 1585.\"\r\n\r\n\"The names of the Household, Flushing, July 21, 1585, Clerk Comptroller,\r\nThomas Arden.\"[528]\r\n\r\nJohn Arderne, will June 5, 1605; ob. s. p.

Mug, Blaxton, Arden and Gregory,\r\npopish priests, were driven out of Exeter, but received elsewhere, and\r\nfeasted in the streets with torch-light.\"--August 17, 1561.\r\n\r\nIn a search for Arden and other prisoners who had escaped, Popish relics\r\nwere found in the house of Francis Yeates, of Lyfford,[530] February 12,\r\n1587. \"The examination of John Arden,[531] gent., son of Laurence Arden,\r\nof Chichester, concerning an attempt made against the King of Spain, and\r\nhis dealings with Dr. Hall and other fugitives.

There is, indeed, the seal of a John Arderne,\r\nson and heir of Sir Adam de Arderne, of Lincolnshire, 1312, in the\r\nBritish Museum, bearing a shield[534] \"Ermine, on a bend three crosses\r\ncrosslet, depending from a tree of three small branches,\" who might have\r\nbeen the same person.\r\n\r\nRichard Arderne owned a messuage in Stanford, Lincoln, 27 Edward III.,\r\nInquis. P.M. As late as 1501 an Edmund Arden,[535] of St. Martin's,\r\nLincoln, left a gown to his brother Thomas, a gown to Pierce Arden, and\r\nother legacies. John Gedney married Mary, daughter of John Arden, of\r\nSibsey, co. Lincoln (Visitation, 1592). In the neighbourhood there was a\r\nnoted Robert de Arderne, of co. Norfolk, 1315, whose seal bears two\r\nshields side by side in fesse; Dext. ermine a fesse chequy Arden;\r\nSinist. on a fesse three garbs with cabalistic letters, explained in\r\n_Journ. Brit. Arch. Ass._, xl. 317.[536]\r\n\r\nNothing brilliant is recorded of the Ardens of Yorkshire. Sir ---- de\r\nArderne, bearing arms Arg. a lion ramp. az. debruized by a baston gu.,\r\nappears in Planché's Roll of Arms of Henry III.[537] John de Ardern, of\r\nYorkshire, is in the list of gentlemen of 43 Edward III. He is mentioned\r\nalso as witness for Haselden, of Goldyngton, 41 Edward III. Thomas\r\nArden, of Marton, near Bridlington, 1455, and Margaret, his wife, 1458,\r\nwere buried in Bridlington Priory.[538] William Ardern, of Belthorp, was\r\namong the gentlemen of 12 Henry VI.[539] John Arderne, of Kelingthorpe,\r\nsecured an exemption from serving on juries, April 1, 8 Henry VIII., at\r\nGreenwich.[540] There are many documents in the Record Office concerning\r\nthe sale of the lands of John Ardern, of Kelingthorpe,[541] York; and a\r\nreceipt from Thomas Perpoint, draper, London, of £516 paid him by John\r\nArden; also a release to Perpoint and John Arden by Thomas Hennage of\r\nthe Cardinal's household. To this Hennage, Arden grants the wardship of\r\nhis son Peter; and, if he should die, the wardship of Raffe; failing\r\nwhom, the wardship of John, his third son, 1533. His wife was Margery.\r\nSir Raff Ellerker married Jane, daughter of John Arden, Esq.\r\n(Visitation, Yorks, 1563). There is also noted the Inquis. P. M., of\r\nPeter Arden, of York, 22 Henry VIII.,[542] and William Arden's lease of\r\nYaresthorpe, Yorks. The priory of nuns at Arden, founded 1150, was\r\nsuppressed in 1536.[543]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWAN THEATRE (BY DR. GAIDERTY.)\r\n\r\n_To face p. 214._]\r\n\r\nThe Ardens appeared also early in Essex. At the Conqueror's Survey, Earl\r\nEustace of Boulogne owned Horndon-on-the-Hill,[544] but the next owners\r\nwere Ardernes, who built Ardern Hall. In 1122 Thomas Ardern and his son\r\nThomas gave to the monks of Bermondsey the tithe of the corn in their\r\nlordship of Horndon. Sir Ralph de Ardern, of Horndon, was Sheriff of\r\nEssex, 39 and 40 Henry III.[545] His seal bore on a shield a fesse\r\nchequy between two roundels.[546] Sir Thomas de Arderne, the son of\r\nRalph, used \"a seal, bearing two trumpets, mouthpieces in base, between\r\nnine crosses crosslet in fesse, three and three, in pale S. Thome de\r\nArderne.\"[547] John Lovetot, who died in 1295, held land of him in\r\nHorndon, by the service of one rose of yearly rent; and John de Arderne\r\ngranted lands in Rochford 33 Edward I.[548] The manor of Walkefares, in\r\nClavering, Essex, belonged to Walter Arden some time previous to\r\n1340.[549]\r\n\r\nThe property of Timothy Arden, Somerset, was administered 1631.[550]\r\n\r\nThere was an Inquisition Post Mortem of William de Arderne, of\r\nChelesworthy Manor, Devon, in 56 Henry III. (39). Another of Adam de\r\nArdern, 53 Henry III. (35), owner of Colverden, Walesworth, and Berton\r\njuxta Gloucester.\r\n\r\nIn 1 Edward VI. Inquisition Post Mortem of William Arden, Wig, the\r\nadministration of the goods of Richard Arden, of Worcester, was granted\r\nhis wife Margaret, 1636 (Admins., 1636-38, f. 116, Worcester).\r\n\r\nWilliam Arden, parson, of Wennington, in 1582, left small legacies to\r\nhis sister-in-law, Bridget Doulton, and all the rest to his two\r\ndaughters, Alice Arden, who married a Stevenson, and Margaret\r\nArden.[551]\r\n\r\nIn the Visitation of the Cheshire Ardens, it is stated that from Thomas,\r\nson of Ralph and brother of John, the Leicestershire Ardens are\r\ndescended.[552]\r\n\r\nIn the great \"History of Leicestershire,\" edited by Nichols, there are a\r\nfew notices of the name, and these chiefly of the Warwickshire Ardens,\r\nwho held property in the shire. Baldwin Freville owned certain lands at\r\nRatcliffe held by Roger de Ardern 1387.[553] Sir Robert of Park Hall was\r\nSheriff of Warwickshire and Leicestershire 16 Henry VI.\r\n\r\n\"Thomas Ferrars holds of the heirs of Roger Arden the third part of the\r\nfeod of Radcliffe, Leicestershire,\" 37 Henry VI., Inquis.

Can these be the same?\r\nCompare pp. 171, 172, 188 and notes.\r\n\r\nThere was an Inquisition Post Mortem on the property of Isabel Arden,\r\nIdeot, Bedfordshire, 10 Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nThe manor of Lyesnes, in Kent, was released to Thomas Ardern in 37 Henry\r\nVIII.[556] There are many notices of the Kent Ardens in Hasted's\r\n\"History of Kent.\" But perhaps public attention was drawn most to the\r\nmember of the family who was murdered.[557] The story is closely\r\nfollowed in the \"Tragedy of Arden of Feversham,\" by some attributed to\r\nShakespeare, though with little probability.\r\n\r\nBurke[558] gives many other branches; as, for instance, Arden of Sunbury\r\nPark, Middlesex, and Rickmansworth Park, Herts; arms: Ermine, two\r\nbarrulets compony or and azure, in chief three boars' heads erased of\r\nthe last, armed of the second, langued gu.\r\n\r\nArdens of East Burnham, Bucks, same arms. Arden of Blackden Hall, co.\r\nChester, Ermine, a fesse chequy or and az.; same crest as the Park Hall\r\narms, but with different motto.\r\n\r\nVarious Ardens drifted to London, but there seems to have been one\r\nbusiness family settled there from early times. Thomas of Plumstede left\r\nrents and a cellar, called Drynkwater Taverne, in the parish of St.\r\nMagnus, to John Arderne, fishmonger, September 26, 1361.[559] John\r\nHanhampsted left the reversion of tenements held for life by John\r\nArderne, Esquire, in the parish of St. Mary Aldermanchurch, May 4,\r\n1424.[560] An administration of goods of John Arderne, of St.\r\nSepulchre's, was granted February 15, 1508.[561]\r\n\r\nIn May, 1534, a pardon was granted John Appowell for abetting John Done,\r\na thief, who stole a gown and a piece of cloth belonging to Thomas\r\nArdrenne from the house of Thomas Chief, May, 1534.[562]\r\n\r\nThomas Arden, September 29, 1549, citizen and clothworker, left all his\r\ngoods to Agnes, his wife; will proved January 27, 1549.[563]\r\n\r\nRobert Arden, of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, vintner, and Agnes Mather\r\nof the same, were licensed to be married at any church in the\r\njurisdiction of Westminster, November 27, 1568.[564]\r\n\r\nA Robert Arden was assistant to the Clerk of the Accatory, 1577.[565]\r\n\r\nSeveral deliveries to him of Government victuals are noted in State\r\nPapers, 1594-97.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether or not he is the Robert Arden who writes a letter\r\nto the Government about the composition of ling and cod from the Iceland\r\nfisheries, landed in Essex, Suffolk, and Norfolk, September 14, 1593, a\r\nletter interesting as showing the relative trade of the towns at that\r\ndate.[566]\r\n\r\nAt St. Saviour's, Southwark, Robert Stillard and Bridget Arden were\r\nmarried August 21, 1618.[567]\r\n\r\nAmong marriage licenses[568] are those of Richard Bromfield and Jane\r\nArden, February 14, 1564; John Arden and Dorothy Hazard, of the city of\r\nWestminster, June 16, 1639;[569] Hugh Phillips, gent., of St.\r\nMargaret's, Westminster, and Elizabeth Arden, of same, November 17,\r\n1641;[570] Henry Arden, of Chelmsford, Essex, gent., widower, and Mary\r\nBoosie, of Writtle, spinster, at St. Magnus the Martyr, London, February\r\n22, 1664;[571] Thomas Arden, of the city of Westminster, Esq., to\r\nTheodosia Long, October 10, 1664; William Ardern, junior, gent., Bach.,\r\nof St. Martin's, Ludgate, and Mrs. Margaret Smith, of Great Wigborough,\r\nEssex, widow, to be married there, March 21, 1665-66;[572] John Arden,\r\nof St. James's, Westminster, widower, aged about fifty, and Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Wright, spinster, twenty-two, January 12, 1687-88.\r\n\r\nGabriel Josselyn, gent., of St. Michael, Bassinghall,[573] and\r\nElizabeth, daughter of ---- Arden of same, deceased, December 1, 1587.\r\n\r\nJohn Brown, of St. Olave's, Hart Street, London, haberdasher, and Anne\r\nArden, of St. Andrew's,[574] Holborn, widow of John Ardern, Fletcher,\r\nFebruary 10, 1595.\r\n\r\nThe will of Robert Arden, gent., Deptford, was proved 1579.[575]\r\n\r\nAn Alexander Arderne, of Deptford, wished to be buried in the churchyard\r\nbeside the hawthorn-tree; he had a wife, Elizabeth, a brother-in-law,\r\nWilliam Inson, and no children, February 26, 1639.[576] Administration\r\nof the goods of James Arden, London, was granted his wife Anne,[577]\r\n1639. Thomas le Barber, from Peter de Arderne, held tenements in the\r\nparish of St. Clements Danes.[578] Alicia Arderne, who was wife of\r\nRichard Hampton, left tenements in the parish of St. Mary in the Strand\r\nand in the parish of St. Clement's Danes, 1466.\r\n\r\nIt seems wiser to group a set of records not generally accessible to\r\nstudents, which, though preserved in London, concern the Ardens of many\r\nbranches--I mean a set of deeds, charters, and conveyances preserved\r\namong the Guildhall Records of London:\r\n\r\n    \"Johanna Arden, wife of Roger de Arden, tailor, 1295.

He says:\r\n\"The first recorded ancestor, Humphrey Arden, of Longcroft, co.\r\nStafford, died in 1705, and so far from being able to show descent from\r\nSiward, they are unable even to prove connection with the extinct family\r\nof Arden of Park Hall.\"\r\n\r\nHere Burke is clearly in the wrong. If they can prove their descent from\r\nHumphrey of Longcroft, they can through him claim descent from the\r\nArdens of Park Hall and from Siward, as can be seen from all pedigrees.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[533] Ashmolean MS., 829, iii., and 1434, i.; also Sententiæ, 1437, Art.\r\nxv., alluded to in Gerard's \"Herbal,\" 657.\r\n\r\n[534] Harl.

In both of these poems,\r\nprobably corrected by himself, his name is spelt _Shakespeare_. In 1594\r\nthe Countess married Sir Thomas Henneage, the Vice-Chamberlain of the\r\nHousehold, and that same year Shakespeare was invited to act at Court.\r\nSir Thomas died the following year, after a lingering illness, and his\r\nwidow had to superintend the making up of his official books, and check\r\nthe bills. And thus it happened that it was she who introduced the\r\n_first official record of Shakespeare's name_, and probably spelt it\r\ncorrectly, according to the contemporary usage.\r\n\r\nPage 5.--Mr. Nanson, the town clerk of Carlisle, has in his possession\r\nthe deed which concerns the Shakesperes of Penrith, 21 Richard II.\r\n\r\nPage 22.--Shakespeare's shield bore an ordinary _canting_ pattern, or\r\none that was based upon the supposed meaning of the name. But the use of\r\nthe falcon in the crest requires explanation. French says: \"The falcon\r\nwas one of the badges of Edward IV., father of Henry VII.'s Queen\r\nElizabeth. No person would venture to adopt this without special favour\"\r\n(\"Shakespeareana Genealogica,\" p. 523). There is something keenly\r\nsuggestive of expected objections in the motto, \"Non sanz droict.\" Some\r\nday, perhaps, it may be discovered why this crest and motto were\r\nassumed.\r\n\r\nPage 27.--Aston Cantlow, with the castle of Abergavenny, was settled on\r\nSir William de Beauchamp, second son of Thomas, Earl of Warwick, 12\r\nHenry IV. It descended to his son, Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Worcester,\r\nwhose daughter Elizabeth married Sir Edmund Neville, and brought it to\r\nhim (Dugdale's \"Warwickshire\").\r\n\r\nPage 27.--Another opinion of the derivation of Thomas Arden has been\r\ndiscussed. It has been supposed possible that he might have been\r\ndescended from Thomas Arden of Leicestershire, son of Ralph Arden of\r\nAlvanley, by his wife Catharine, daughter of Sir William Stanley, of\r\nHooton. This would account for the grant of the Cheshire arms, and would\r\nnot thrust him out of the Arden pedigree; but the theory is not\r\nsatisfactory on other grounds. One main objection is that there was no\r\nknown Thomas of suitable date in that family. But in the Park Hall\r\nfamily there was a Thomas known to be alive during the period between\r\n1502 and 1526, who has _never been traced_, if he did not go to Aston\r\nCantlow. Members of the Arden family accept him as the missing brother\r\nof Sir John, and believe that it was through a careless mistake of the\r\nheralds that the fesse chequy was struck out, and that the Shakespeares\r\nresented the substitution of another in place of the arms to which they\r\nhad a right, and never accepted the grant. During the discussion John\r\nShakespeare died.\r\n\r\nPage 27.--The pedigrees of those associated with the Ardens are worth\r\nnoting, and their wills might suggest connections.\r\n\r\nPage 32.--It would be interesting to find and group the Warwickshire\r\nArdens who bore the three cross-crosslets and the chief or, for it has\r\nnever been done.\r\n\r\nPage 35.--Thomas Arden was presented for owing suit of Court in 1526,\r\n1529, 1531. (See Portfolio 207, Court Rolls, No. 88.)\r\n\r\nPage 36.--Thomas and Robert Arden's purchase at Snitterfield had been\r\nwitnessed by John Wagstaff,[581] Richard Rushby, of Snitterfield,\r\nRichard Atkins, of Wilmecote, John Alcokkes, of Newenham. The overseers\r\nof Robert Arden's will were Adam Palmer,[582] of Wilmecote, Hugh\r\nPorter,[583] of Snitterfield, and John Skerlett, of Wilmecote; the\r\nwitnesses, Sir William Bouton Curett, Adam Palmer, John Scarlet, Thomas\r\nJenkes, William Pitt. Adam Palmer was overseer of Mrs. Agnes Arden's\r\nwill, in conjunction with George Gibbes, who had, later, the lease of\r\nAsbies from the Shakespeares at the time of its mortgage to Lambert.\r\n\r\nPage 45.--A Thomas Mayo had a seat in the Church of St. Nicholas,\r\nWarwick, 1595; an Elizabeth Mayo was buried there in 1596; and Henry\r\nMaio in 1601. (See Churchwarden's Accounts of St. Nicholas, Warwick,\r\nedited by Mr. Richard Savage.) The Webbes of Snitterfield appear among\r\nthe gentry of the country in 1580 (State Papers, Domestic Series, Eliz.,\r\nc. xxxvii. 68).\r\n\r\nPage 51.--It is difficult to imagine John Shakespeare making up the\r\nbills for the other Chamberlains, or conducting so many financial\r\nresponsibilities, if he was unable to read and write, as well as reckon\r\nwell--as Halliwell-Phillipps says he was.\r\n\r\nPage 52.--The goods of Richard Shakespeare were prised at £35 17s., and\r\nthe bond for their just administration entered into by John Shakespeare\r\nand Thomas Nicols, of £100, seems disproportionably large, unless there\r\nwere some unusually heavy responsibilities attached. John Shakespeare\r\nmay very well have been termed a farmer if he had been brought up as\r\none, and if he had been superintending his father's farm at the time of\r\nhis death. In the description of a neighbouring farm, Ingon is mentioned\r\nas \"now or late in the occupation of John Shaxspere or his assignes.\" It\r\nis quite possible that he was the responsible farmer, and that Henry his\r\nbrother was his \"assigne.\" Ingon, though in the parish of\r\nHampton-on-Avon, was very near Snitterfield.\r\n\r\nPage 56.--Henry Shakespeare probably quarrelled with Mr. Cornwall, the\r\nsecond husband of Margaret Arden, about the resettlement of Snitterfield\r\nfarm, and went to reside at Ingon, though taken in his brother's name.\r\nThe Court Rolls show that he was \"contumaceous\" in not paying tithes,\r\nMay 22, 1582, and was \"excommunicated.\" \"Of Henry Shaxper, for not\r\nlabouring with teems for the amending of the Queen's Highway, 2/6.\" \"Of\r\nHenry Shaxper for having a dich between Redd Hill and Burmans in decay\r\nfor want of repair, Oct. 22nd, 1596.\" Probably the man was ill and dying\r\nthen. He was buried two months later.\r\n\r\nPage 58.--The petition of the burgesses of Stratford-on-Avon for relief\r\nof burdens shows that the borough had fallen into decay through the\r\ndecline in the wool trade. From this general depression John Shakespeare\r\nprobably suffered.\r\n\r\nPage 61.--\"The Book of John Fisher of Warwick\" shows that the master of\r\nthe Grammar School there had a salary of £10 a year. Seeing that the\r\nmaster of Stratford-on-Avon Grammar School had £20 a year, it is\r\nprobable that the burgesses had a better selection of scholars as\r\ncandidates.\r\n\r\nPage 62.--It is too often forgotten that Anne Hathaway lost her father\r\nin the summer of 1582. It is probable that the betrothal would therefore\r\nbe a quiet one. It is also more than likely that she went to reside with\r\na friend or relative after her father's death, and that this caused the\r\nconfusion in the address in the marriage bond. The bridegroom in general\r\nonly required one guarantee for a bond of the kind; but Shakespeare\r\nbeing under age, the one became his representative, and the other\r\nguarantor for that representative.\r\n\r\nPage 67.--\"The Comedy of Errors\" was doubtless one of the plays\r\nperformed before the Queen at Christmas, 1594, seeing that it was ready\r\nto be put upon the boards at the Gray's Inn Revels on the spur of the\r\nmoment. I have discussed this at full in my paper, \"The Earliest\r\nOfficial Record of Shakespeare's Name,\" Berlin (a copy at the British\r\nMuseum); also in a long letter to the _Times_, January, 1895.\r\n\r\nPage 70.--James Burbage bought the part of a house in Blackfriars from\r\nSir William More, February 4, 1596, which he afterwards converted into a\r\ntheatre. Regarding the quarrel with Allen and \"the Theatre\" lease, see\r\nthe depositions in the case of Burbage _v._ Allen taken at Kelvedon, in\r\nEssex, August, 1600, reproduced in Halliwell-Phillips's \"Outlines,\" i.\r\n350. Further illustration of the earning proportions of players and\r\nproprietors may be learned from the article by Mr. James Greenstreet,\r\n\"The Whitefriars Theatre at the Time of Shakespeare\" (The New\r\nShakespearean Society's Transactions, 1888).\r\n\r\nPage 77.--In John Combe's will there is mentioned a field in Ingon Lane,\r\ncalled Parson's Close, or Shakespeare's Close. This may have been one of\r\nthe poet's minor purchases, or merely a name come down from Henry's\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nPage 78.--A petition was sent up to the Lord Chief Justice from the\r\nCorporation of Stratford-on-Avon, to restrain William Combe, Esq., son\r\nand heir of John Combe, March 27, 1616. He overthrew the Aldermen who\r\ncame peaceably to hinder his digging, whereof great tumult arose. In\r\nspite of orders to the contrary, he continued his enclosures, and\r\nanother petition was addressed to the Privy Council, describing \"Mr.\r\nCombe of so unbridled a disposition,\" etc. On February 14, 1618, a reply\r\ncame signed, \"Francis Verulam,\" \"Pembroke,\" \"Naunton,\" \"Fulke Greville\"\r\n(Wheler Collection, Stratford-on-Avon).\r\n\r\nPage 82.--From the town clerk's account of what took place at the Halls\r\nduring Shakespeare's lifetime, we are sure that his position must have\r\nbeen anomalous.\r\n\r\n\"The Halle, 17 Dec., 45 Eliz. Plays. At this Halle yt ys ordered that\r\nthere shalbe no plays or enterludes played in the Chamber, the Guild\r\nHalle, nor in any parte of the House or Courte, from hensforward, upon\r\npayne that whosoever of the Baylif, Aldermen, and burgisses of this\r\nboroughe shall give leave or licence thereunto shall forfeit for everie\r\noffence 10s.\r\n\r\n    \"7 Feb., 1611-12, 45 Eliz.\"\r\n\r\n\"...

Some change among the\r\nleases, or the termination of the connection with his family through the\r\ndeath of his widow, may have suggested this.\r\n\r\nPage 93.--A Robert Hall rented the old School House in\r\nStratford-on-Avon, and paved the Guild Hall, 1568. A Richard Hall was\r\nchurchwarden of St. Nicholas, Warwick, in 1552, who died in 1558, and\r\namong the churchwarden's accounts are notices of Richard Hall the\r\nyounger, Nicholas Hall, John, Alice, Simon and \"Eme Hall.\" \"Received of\r\nRic. Hawle the younger for the benevolence that Richard Hawle gave unto\r\nthe poor out of his lands in Church Street, World without end,\" 1566-67.\r\nRichard Hall was churchwarden in 1600 and in 1606 (Churchwarden's\r\nAccounts, St. Nicholas, Warwick, Mr. Richard Savage).\r\n\r\nPage 99.--Michael Drayton frequently visited Sir Henry Rainsford at the\r\nManor House, Clifford Chambers. This gentleman had married Anne Goodyere\r\nof Polesworth, whose parents were Drayton's patrons. She was the \"Idea\"\r\nof his sonnets. (See introduction to \"Michael Drayton,\" by Oliver Elton,\r\n1895.)\r\n\r\nPage 103.--Susanna Hall's signature appears on the settlements of 1639,\r\nand on that of 1647, in which her daughter joined.\r\n\r\nPage 104.--\"15th Dec., 1648.

It _may_ be they were\r\nconnections.\r\n\r\nPage 110.--Halliwell-Phillipps states that in the \"Coram Rege Roll of\r\n1597, Gilbert Shakespeare is named as one of those standing bail for a\r\nclockmaker of Stratford\"; and adds that he is described as \"Haberdasher\r\nof St. Bridget's Parish, London.\" Through the kind permission of the\r\nWorshipful Company of Haberdashers, I have been allowed to go through\r\ntheir books at leisure, and find that there is no trace of a Shakespeare\r\nanywhere, and in the sixteenth century, no trace even of a _Gilbert_,\r\nexcept \"Gilbert Shepherd,\" who took up his freedom in 1579. Neither is\r\nthere any trace of him in the registers of St. Bridget's or St. Bride's,\r\nnor in the Subsidy Rolls, but in both places appear Gilbert Shepherd. I\r\nam, therefore, forced to the conclusion that Halliwell-Phillipps misread\r\n\"Shepherd\" as \"Shakespeare.\" See my article in the _Athenæum_, Dec. 22,\r\n1900, \"John Shakespeare, of Ingon, and Gilbert of St. Bride's.\"\r\n\r\nPage 112.--William Hart, the hatter, died a week before his\r\nbrother-in-law, probably of the same epidemic. Joan Hart, his widow,\r\nsurvived till November 4, 1646. Their eldest son William was an actor.\r\n(See Royal Warrant, May 17, 1636; Halliwell-Phillipps, i. 129.) In\r\nWilliam Hewitt's \"Visits to Remarkable Places,\" 1839, he mentions\r\nStratford and a boy whom he had noticed from his likeness to the poet.\r\nHe turned out to be a descendant of his sister Joan Hart, and was called\r\nWilliam Shakespeare Smith (_Notes and Queries_, 5th Series, VIII. 475).\r\nProbably the same referred to on page 109.\r\n\r\nPage 116.--Thomas Shakespeare seemed to have been somewhat like Henry in\r\ncharacter. He was entered on the Court Roll at a rental of £4 in 1563.\r\n\"At the Court 31st March, 23 Eliz., he incurred a penalty of 4d. for not\r\nhaving and exercising bows; for not wearing cappes 4d.; for leaving his\r\nswine unringed in the fields 12d.\" He appears also as a juror several\r\ntimes in court.\r\n\r\nPage 121.--Mr. Rylands' \"Records of Rowington\" supply many details, as,\r\nfor instance:\r\n\r\n\"In 1576, a lease by feoffees, among whom was Thomas Shakespeare, was\r\ngranted Richard Shakespeare of Rowington, weaver of the 'Tyinges.'\"\r\n\r\nIn the same year a lease of \"the Harveys\" was granted to \"Elenor\r\nShakespeare, widow, of Rowington,\" 20 Feb., 18 Eliz.\r\n\r\nThe customary rent of Rowington, 1605, mentions \"Thomas Shakespeare, one\r\nclose, 2/; one tofte and 16 acres, 13/4; one messuage, etc., 10/4.\"\r\n\r\n     \"George Shakespeare, one cottage and 2 acres, 2/.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Richard Shakespere, one messuage, half a yd land (14\r\n     acres), 14/.\"\r\n\r\n     \"John Shakespeare, one cottage and one quarter yd land (9\r\n     acres), 6/8.\"\r\n\r\nThe Court Rolls, 1633, give:\r\n\r\n     \"Imprimis of Jane Shaxper for default of sute of court\r\n     fined, 4d.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Thomas Shaxper, vitler, for breaking assize of ale and\r\n     beer, 4d.\"\r\n\r\n     \"1634, Richard Shaxper, for encroaching on common, 2d.\"\r\n\r\n     \"1647, fine of admittance to land, Thomas Shaxper, 6/8.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Exchequer lay subsidies,\" Thomas in 1595, 1598, 1599,\r\n     \"assessed on goods valued £4,8/.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Lay subsidies 1668,\" Thomas, \"assessed on land, 30/ and\r\n     4/.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1674 John Shakespeare, in the name of the other tenants of Rowington,\r\nwas empowered to bring an action against enclosures.\r\n\r\nA grant of a fee of 20/ a year by will of Humphrey Shakespeare, 1794,\r\nwas payable out of premises in Kingswood.\r\n\r\nThis cottage was the subject of a lawsuit in which Jane Lord and John\r\nSlye _v._ Humphrey Shakespeare and one Culcup were at variance.

Mr.\r\nGutheridge was a dealer in leather there (see will of Joyce Hobday,\r\n1602); and John Milburn was a Rowington man (see the Records of\r\nRowington)--which two facts much increase the likelihood of John, of St.\r\nClement's Danes, being at least a Warwickshire man, if not the\r\nSnitterfield one.\r\n\r\nPage 151.--\"Edward Shakespear, Clare, A.B. 1728; A.M. 1736\"\r\n(\"Cantabrigensis Graduati\").\r\n\r\n\"Joh.

Sir\r\nThomas Arden, 9 Edward II., married Elizabeth, daughter of Roger\r\nSwinford; their son was Roger Arden, whose wife was unknown, but his\r\ndaughter and heir Beatrix married William Chamber.\r\n\r\nPage 171.--William _may_ have been the member of the Guild of Knowle for\r\nwhose sake masses were said in 1512. \"Alicia\" may have been his wife, or\r\nhis sister Alice before she married \"Buklond.\" But I confess I am\r\npuzzled with this William.\r\n\r\nPage 171.--The tombs of Walter and Eleanor are well preserved in\r\nErdington's Chantry of the Church of St. Peter and Paul, at Aston, near\r\nBirmingham. He died August 5, 1502.\r\n\r\nPage 173.--The Shropshire Visitation gives: \"William de Chettleton m.\r\nKatharine, d. of Sir John Ardern; Elizabeth, d. of Reginald Corbet of\r\nStoke, Justice of the Royal Pleas, m.

Warwick, husbandman, of a\r\nmessuage, lands, etc., in Wilmer, late in the tenure of Robert Wilmer,\r\ndeceased, was drawn up July 15, 23 Henry VIII., 1541.

It makes one extraordinary\r\nstatement: \"The younger house of the Ardens were Lords of _Upton in\r\nWarwickshire_, and grew to be surnamed Uptons. The heire generall of\r\nthem was married to one Fenne of Banburie, who, removing his dwelling to\r\nHungerford in Wiltshire, was there called by the name of Moeles, of whom\r\nthe Moeles, ancestors to the Lord Hungerford, seem to be descended.\" It\r\ngives the coat of arms as, Chequy or and azure, a chevron ermine.\r\n\r\nStow MS. 692 contains the arms of the gentry and the grants by Sir\r\nChristopher Barker, 1536-49. Among these are: \"Ardern goules, a cheff\r\nengrayled and three cross crosslets fitchée in gold. Ardern silver, a\r\nfesse chequy, gold and azur between three cressards gules. Arderne, Sir\r\nRobert, Ermine a fesse or and azur, Warwickshire.\" Among the grants is\r\none to William Arderne, of Struton, Oskellyswade, Bedford, Clerk of the\r\nMarket to the King's most honourable household. It omits the shield and\r\nonly gives, \"Crest a boar quarterly, gold and silver and Fleurs de luce,\r\ngoules.\" As the Park Hall Ardens had a boar on their crest, he may have\r\nclaimed connection.\r\n\r\nIn Dugdale's account of Clodshalle's Chantry, near Birmingham, he says\r\nit was founded by Walter de Clodshalle of Saltley, 4 Edward III. The\r\npatronage remained with the Clodshalles until Robert Arden's marriage to\r\nElizabeth Clodshalle. Robert Arden, arm., was patron in 1441, 1449,\r\n1455; Walter Ardern, arm., in 1468, 1469, 1489; John Ardern de Lee\r\nLodge, presented in 1510; and Nicholas Cotterell, of Yardley, co. Wig.,\r\nthrough concession of Thomas Ardern, 1537.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dugdale, Upton was possessed by the Ardens in Henry II.,\r\none Haraldus filius Gunfridi having made sale to Godfrey de Arden, a\r\nmonk of Coventry, and son to Siward de Arden, of certain lands for the\r\nMonastery. In Richard I., Thomas de Ardern granted certain lands there\r\nto the canons of St. Sepulchre's, Warwick. A family who _assumed_ their\r\nname from their residence there held it of the Ardens, but Thomas de\r\nArdern sold it to Guy de Gyllebrok, who passed it to Will. de Beauchamp,\r\nEarl of Warwick.\r\n\r\nPage 181.--Pedimore, Warwickshire, on the Ebroke, at the north of the\r\nTame, was the chief seat of the Ardens at one time, but was allowed to\r\ngo to ruin when the family settled at Park Hall on the south side of the\r\nriver. It was all levelled except its double moat by Dugdale's time.\r\n\r\nPedmore, Worcestershire, where \"Mistress Joyce Arden\" died in 1557, was\r\npart of the possessions of Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Clodeshalle,\r\nwhich she brought to Robert Arden, of Park Hall, 4 Henry VI., 1425. He\r\ndied, seized of Pedmore, Yardly and Stockton, Worcestershire, 3 Henry\r\nVI., 1453. There are entered as residents William Arden, 1455, John\r\nArden, 1468-83, Thomas Arden, 1530, Edward Arden. But in the State\r\nPapers Edward's brother Francis was entered as \"Francis Arden of\r\nPedmore,\" in 1583, at the time of the attainder, so it may have been\r\ngranted him as a second residence, or it may have been the ruinous old\r\nhome in Warwickshire he held. The registers here prove that Robert,\r\nEdward's heir, was residing here, and already married, before 1578, an\r\nimportant point to be noted in the family history.\r\n\r\nPage 183.--Simon in Longcroft, according to Shaw, used the Arden arms\r\nwith a difference, the arms being \"Ermine a fesse chequy G. and B. Crest\r\non a Chapeau, Erm. and Gu., a boar passant or.\" At the north end of the\r\nvillage of Longcroft was an old half-timbered house, which was purchased\r\nby John of Wisbeach, who died 1709, and thus became the property of the\r\nfamily of Longcroft.\r\n\r\nPage 187.--Shaw mentions the tombstones: \"Henry Arden died 1674\"; \"Henry\r\nArden died 1698, aged 24\"; \"Humphrey Arden died 1705, aged 74; Elizabeth\r\nhis daughter died 1689, aged 21; Katharine, his eldest daughter, died\r\n1722; John Arden died 1709, aged 84.\"\r\n\r\nHenry Arden died 1728, and Anna his wife and Catherine his twin sister.\r\nThe stone erected by John, his son. \"John died 1734, aged 40; Anna\r\nCatherina, wife of John Arden, and daughter of John Newton of King's\r\nBromley, died 1727, aged 29.\" \"Also to the memory of Anne, second wife,\r\ndaughter of Rev.

Robert Arden, of Lapworth, might have been one of\r\nthe six unnamed younger children of the Robert executed during the Wars\r\nof the Roses.\r\n\r\nNicholaa was widow of William de Boutvilein when she married Sir Robert\r\nde Arderne de Draiton. After her husband's death she was involved in a\r\ncontest with Robert de Wyckham about the presentation to the church of\r\nSwaldyve. There is no doubt that the name on the seal mentioned in the\r\nlast line of p. 189 is in the masculine genitive; but I am inclined to\r\nbelieve that the die-cutter made a mistake, and that it was really the\r\nseal of Nicholaa.\r\n\r\nPage 193.--In Blomfield's account of Bawsey, Norfolk, he states that it\r\nbelonged to the family of Glanville in 6 Richard I. \"Thomas de Ardern\r\nand Ralph, son of Robert, impleaded Sir William de Auberville and Maude\r\nhis wife for their portion in Bawsey and Glosthorp.\" Maud, the eldest\r\ndaughter of Ralph de Glanville, married Sir William de Auberville;\r\nAmabil, the second, married Ralph de Arden; and Helewise married Robert\r\nFitzRalph de Middleham, Yorkshire (Blomfield's \"Norfolk,\" viii.\r\n341-342).\r\n\r\nPage 194.--John Arderne was a priest at Oxburgh in 1386 (Blomfield's\r\n\"Norfolk,\" vi. 191). Mortimer's Chapel, Attleborough. A benefactor\r\nthereto was John Arderne, buried therein 1479. Other entries may concern\r\nhis descendants. Sir Edward Warenne, of Boton, in 1365 married Cecily,\r\ndaughter and coheir of Sir Nicholas de Eton, widow of John, son and heir\r\nof Sir John Ardern (ix. 370). John Arderne, Rector of Brinton 1452 (ix.\r\n370). Isolda de Arderne presented to Plasset and Attleborough in King\r\nJohn's time (i. 503, 523). She was a benefactress to the Abbey of\r\nWindham (ii. 516, 525). She was a daughter of Alured de Plesseto, and\r\nleft her body to be buried at Windham, and benefactions to the Abbey,\r\nwith the consent of William de Arderne, her son. Thurston Holland, of\r\nDenton, married Jane, daughter of John Ardern, of Hawarden (i. 342).\r\nElizabeth, Duchess of Norfolk, presented Robert Arderne to the Rectory\r\nof Aldeburgh (149), and at his death, 1504, gave it to Will Taylor (v.\r\n353). Peter Arderne trustee for John Copputdike, of Witlingham, in 1432\r\n(v. 456).\r\n\r\nPage 196.--In relation to the Cheshire Ardens, Burke says that \"the\r\nelder branch of Ardens became extinct by the death of Walkelin Ardern,\r\n_temp._ Richard II. Sir John Arden, younger brother, became head of the\r\nfamily. A younger branch of Arderns settled at Alderley (Edward III.),\r\nand ended in a few descents in a female heir, who married into the\r\nWeever family, whose heiress married the ancestor of Sir J. Stanley. The\r\nArdernes of Leicestershire descended from Thomas, the younger son of Sir\r\nRalph Arderne of Harden, 1420, and brother of John of Harden.\" This is\r\nconfusing and unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nPage 199.--Does the following notice refer to this Thomas Arden of\r\nElford, etc.? \"Thomas de Arderne, Chivaler, who was in Gascony in the\r\nretinue of Ed.
