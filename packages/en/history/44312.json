What a record this name represents of British\r\npluck and daring, of patient industry and hardy endurance, of wild\r\nadventure among savage Indian tribes, and of exposure to danger by\r\nmountain, precipice, and seething torrent and wintry plain!\r\n\r\nIn two full centuries the Hudson's Bay Company, under its original\r\nCharter, undertook financial enterprises of the greatest magnitude,\r\npromoted exploration and discovery, governed a vast domain in the\r\nnorthern part of the American Continent, and preserved to the British\r\nEmpire the wide territory handed over to Canada in 1870. For nearly a\r\ngeneration since that time the veteran Company has carried on successful\r\ntrade in competition with many rivals, and has shown the vigour of youth.\r\n\r\nThe present History includes not only the record of the remarkable\r\nexploits of this well-known Company, but also the accounts of the daring\r\nFrench soldiers and explorers who disputed the claim of the Company\r\nin the seventeenth century, and in the eighteenth century actually\r\nsurpassed the English adventurers in penetrating the vast interior of\r\nRupert's Land.\r\n\r\nSpecial attention is given in this work to the picturesque history\r\nof what was the greatest rival of the Hudson's Bay Company, viz. the\r\nNorth-West Fur Company of Montreal, as well as to the extraordinary\r\nspirit of the X Y Company and the Astor Fur Company of New York.\r\n\r\nA leading feature of this book is the adequate treatment for the first\r\ntime of the history of the well-nigh eighty years just closing, from the\r\nunion of all the fur traders of British North America under the name\r\nof the Hudson's Bay Company. This period, beginning with the career\r\nof the Emperor-Governor. Sir George Simpson (1821), and covering the\r\nlife, adventure, conflicts, trade, and development of the vast region\r\nstretching from Labrador to Vancouver Island, and north to the Mackenzie\r\nRiver and the Yukon, down to the present year, is the most important\r\npart of the Company's history.\r\n\r\nFor the task thus undertaken the author is well fitted. He has had\r\nspecial opportunities for becoming acquainted with the history,\r\nposition, and inner life of the Hudson's Bay Company. He has lived for\r\nnearly thirty years in Winnipeg, for the whole of that time in sight\r\nof Fort Garry, the fur traders' capital, or what remains of it; he has\r\nvisited many of the Hudson's Bay Company's posts from Fort William\r\nto Victoria, in the Lake Superior and the Lake of the Woods region,\r\nin Manitoba, Assiniboia, Alberta, and British Columbia; in those\r\ndistricts he has run the rapids, crossed the portages, surveyed the\r\nruins of old forts, and fixed the localities of long-forgotten posts;\r\nhe is acquainted with a large number of the officers of the Company,\r\nhas enjoyed their hospitality, read their journals, and listened with\r\ninterest to their tales of adventure in many out-of-the-way posts; he\r\nis a lover of the romance, and story, and tradition of the fur traders'\r\npast.\r\n\r\nThe writer has had full means of examining documents, letters, journals,\r\nbusiness records, heirlooms, and archives of the fur traders both in\r\nGreat Britain and Canada. He returns thanks to the custodians of many\r\nvaluable originals, which he has used, to the Governor of the Hudson's\r\nBay Company in 1881, Right Hon. G. J. Goschen, who granted him the\r\nprivilege of consulting all Hudson's Bay Company records up to the date\r\nof 1821, and he desires to still more warmly acknowledge the permission\r\ngiven him by the distinguished patron of literature and education, the\r\npresent Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, Lord Strathcona and Mount\r\nRoyal, to read any documents of public importance in the Hudson's Bay\r\nHouse in London. This unusual opportunity granted the author was largely\r\nused by him in 1896 and again in 1899.\r\n\r\nTaking the advice of his publishers, the author, instead of publishing\r\nseveral volumes of annals of the Company, has condensed the important\r\nfeatures of the history into one fair-sized volume, but has given in an\r\nAppendix references and authorities which may afford the reader, who\r\ndesires more detailed information on special periods, the sources of\r\nknowledge for fuller research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nTO THE THIRD EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe favor which has been shown to the \"Remarkable History of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company\" has resulted in a large measure from its being\r\nwritten by a native-born Canadian, who is familiar with much of the\r\nground over which the Company for two hundred years held sway.\r\n\r\nA number of corrections have been made and the book has been brought up\r\nto date for this Edition.\r\n\r\nIt has been a pleasure to the Author, who has expressed himself without\r\nfear or favor regarding the Company men and their opponents, that he has\r\nreceived from the greater number of his readers commendations for his\r\nfairness and insight into the affairs of the Company and its wonderful\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n                                                           GEORGE BRYCE.\r\n\r\n    KILMADOCK, WINNIPEG,\r\n            _August 19, 1910_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n  THE FIRST VOYAGE FOR TRADE.

To a visitor, strolling\r\ndown Leadenhall Street, it recalls the spirit of Lamb to turn into\r\nEast India Avenue, and the mind wanders back to Clive and Burke of\r\nMacaulay's brilliant essay, in which he impales, with balanced phrase\r\nand perfect impartiality, Philip Francis and Warren Hastings alike.\r\n\r\nThe London merchants were mighty men, men who could select their agents,\r\nand send their ships, and risk their money on every sea and on every\r\nshore. Nor was this only for gain, but for philanthropy as well. Across\r\nyonder is the abode of the New England Company, founded in 1649, and\r\nre-established by Charles II. in 1661--begun and still existing with its\r\nfixed income \"for the propagation of the Gospel in New England and the\r\nadjoining parts of America,\" having had as its first president the Hon.\r\nRobert Boyle; and hard by are the offices of the Canada Company, now\r\nreaching its three-quarters of a century.\r\n\r\nNot always, however, as Macaulay points out, did the trading Companies\r\nremember that the pressure on their agents abroad for increased returns\r\nmeant the temptation to take doubtful or illicit methods to gain their\r\nends. They would have recoiled from the charge of Lady Macbeth,--\r\n\r\n    \"Wouldst not play false,\r\n    And yet wouldst wrongly win.\"\r\n\r\nYet on the whole the Merchant Companies of London bear an honourable\r\nrecord, and have had a large share in laying the foundations of\r\nEngland's commercial greatness.\r\n\r\nWandering but a step further past East India Avenue, at the corner\r\nof Lime and Leadenhall Streets, we come to-day upon another building\r\nsitting somewhat sedately in the very heart of stirring and living\r\ncommerce. This is the Hudson's Bay House, the successor of the old house\r\non Fenchurch Street, the abode of another Company, whose history goes\r\nback for more than two centuries and a quarter, and which is to-day the\r\nmost vigorous and vivacious of all the sisterhood of companies we have\r\nenumerated. While begun as a purely trading Company, it has shown in\r\nits remarkable history not only the shrewdness and business skill of\r\nthe race, called by Napoleon a \"nation of shopkeepers,\" but it has been\r\nthe governing power over an empire compassing nearly one half of North\r\nAmerica, it has been the patron of science and exploration, the defender\r\nof the British flag and name, and the fosterer, to a certain extent, of\r\neducation and religion.\r\n\r\nNot only on the shores of Hudson Bay, but on the Pacific coast, in\r\nthe prairies of Red River, and among the snows of the Arctic slope,\r\non the rocky shores of Labrador and in the mountain fastnesses of the\r\nYukon, in the posts of Fort William and Nepigon, on Lake Superior, and\r\nin far distant Athabasca, among the wild Crees, or greasy Eskimos, or\r\ntreacherous Chinooks, it has floated the red cross standard, with the\r\nwell-known letters H. B. C.--an \"open sesame\" to the resources of a wide\r\nextent of territory.\r\n\r\nThe founding of the Company has features of romance. These may well\r\nbe detailed, and to do so leads us back several years before the\r\nincorporation of the Company by Charles II. in 1670. The story of the\r\nfirst voyage and how it came about is full of interest.\r\n\r\nTwo French Protestant adventurers--Medard Chouart and Pierre Esprit\r\nRadisson--the former born near Meaux, in France, and the other a\r\nresident of St. Malo, in Brittany--had gone to Canada about the middle\r\nof the seventeenth century. Full of energy and daring, they, some years\r\nafterwards, embarked in the fur trade, and had many adventures.\r\n\r\nRadisson was first captured by the Iroquois, and adopted into one of\r\ntheir tribes. After two years he escaped, and having been taken to\r\nEurope, returned to Montreal. Shortly afterwards he took part in the\r\nwars between the Hurons and Iroquois. Chouart was for a time assistant\r\nin a Jesuit mission, but, like most young men of the time, yielded to\r\nthe attractions of the fur trade. He had married first the daughter of\r\nAbraham Martin, the French settler, after whom the plains of Abraham\r\nat Quebec are named. On her death Chouart married the widowed sister\r\nof Radisson, and henceforth the fortunes of the two adventurers were\r\nclosely bound up together. The marriage of Chouart brought him a\r\ncertain amount of property, he purchased land out of the proceeds of\r\nhis ventures, and assumed the title of Seignior, being known as \"Sieur\r\ndes Groseilliers.\" In the year 1658 Groseilliers and Radisson went\r\non the third expedition to the west, and returned after an absence\r\nof two years, having wintered at Lake Nepigon, which they called\r\n\"Assiniboines.\" It is worthy of note that Radisson frankly states in the\r\naccount of his third voyage that they had not been in the Bay of the\r\nNorth (Hudson Bay).\r\n\r\nThe fourth voyage of the two partners in 1661 was one of an eventful\r\nkind, and led to very important results. They had applied to the\r\nGovernor for permission to trade in the interior, but this was refused,\r\nexcept on very severe conditions. Having had great success on their\r\nprevious voyage, and with the spirit of adventure inflamed within them,\r\nthe partners determined to throw off all authority, and at midnight\r\ndeparted without the Governor's leave, for the far west. During an\r\nabsence of two years the adventurers turned their canoes northward, and\r\nexplored the north shore of Lake Superior.\r\n\r\nIt is in connection with this fourth voyage (1661) that the question has\r\nbeen raised as to whether Radisson and his brother-in-law Groseilliers\r\nvisited Hudson Bay by land. The conflicting claim to the territory about\r\nHudson Bay by France and England gives interest to this question. Two\r\nFrench writers assert that the two explorers had visited Hudson Bay by\r\nland. These are, the one, M. Bacqueville de la Potherie, Paris; and the\r\nother, M. Jeremie, Governor of the French ports in Hudson Bay. Though\r\nboth maintain that Hudson Bay was visited by the two Frenchmen, Radisson\r\nand Groseilliers, yet they differ entirely in details, Jeremie stating\r\nthat they captured some Englishmen there, a plain impossibility.\r\n\r\nOldmixon, an English writer, in 1708, makes the following\r\nstatement:--\"Monsieur Radisson and Monsieur Gooselier, meeting with some\r\nsavages in the Lake of the Assinipouals, in Canada, they learnt of them\r\nthat they might go by land to the bottom of the bay, where the English\r\nhad not yet been. Upon which they desired them to conduct them thither,\r\nand the savages accordingly did it.\" Oldmixon is, however, inaccurate\r\nin some other particulars, and probably had little authority for this\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRITICAL PASSAGE.\r\n\r\nThe question arises in Radisson's Journals, which are published in the\r\nvolume of the Prince Society.\r\n\r\nFor so great a discovery the passage strikes us as being very short and\r\ninadequate, and no other reference of the kind is made in the voyages.\r\nIt is as follows, being taken from the fourth voyage, page 224:--\r\n\r\n\"We went away with all hast possible to arrive the sooner at ye\r\ngreat river. We came to the seaside, where we finde an old house all\r\ndemolished and battered with boullets. We weare told yt those that\r\ncame there were of two nations, one of the wolf, and the other of\r\nthe long-horned beast. All those nations are distinguished by the\r\nrepresentation of the beasts and animals. They tell us particularities\r\nof the Europians. We know ourselves, and what Europ is like, therefore\r\nin vaine they tell us as for that. We went from isle to isle all that\r\nsummer. We pluckt abundance of ducks, as of other sort of fowles; we\r\nwanted not fish, nor fresh meat. We weare well beloved, and weare\r\noverjoyed that we promised them to come with such shipps as we invented.\r\nThis place has a great store of cows. The wild men kill not except for\r\nnecessary use. We went further in the bay to see the place that they\r\nweare to pass that summer. That river comes from the lake, and empties\r\nitself in ye river of Sagnes (Saguenay) called Tadousac, wch is a\r\nhundred leagues in the great river of Canada, as where we are in ye Bay\r\nof ye North. We left in this place our marks and rendezvous. The wild\r\nmen yt brought us defended us above all things, if we would come quietly\r\nto them, that we should by no means land, & so goe to the river to the\r\nother side, that is to the North, towards the sea, telling us that those\r\npeople weare very treacherous.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLAIM INVALID.\r\n\r\nWe would remark as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. The fourth voyage may be traced as a journey through Lake Superior,\r\npast the pictured rocks on its south side, beyond the copper deposits,\r\nwestward to where there are prairie meadows, where the Indians grow\r\nIndian corn, and where elk and buffalo are found, in fact in the region\r\ntoward the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\n2. The country was toward that of the Nadoneseronons, i.e. the Nadouessi\r\nor Sioux; north-east of them were the Christinos or Crees; so that the\r\nregion must have been what we know at present as Northern Minnesota.\r\nThey visited the country of the Sioux, the present States of Dakota,\r\nand promised to visit the Christinos on their side of the upper lake,\r\nevidently Lake of the Woods or Winnipeg.\r\n\r\n3. In the passage before us they were fulfilling their promise. They\r\ncame to the \"seaside.\" This has given colour to the idea that Hudson Bay\r\nis meant. An examination of Radisson's writing shows us, however, that\r\nhe uses the terms lake and sea interchangeably. For example, in page\r\n155, he speaks of the \"Christinos from the bay of the North Sea,\" which\r\ncould only refer to the Lake of the Woods or Lake Winnipeg. Again, on\r\npage 134, Radisson speaks of the \"Lake of the Hurrons which was upon the\r\nborder of the sea,\" evidently meaning Lake Superior. On the same page,\r\nin the heading of the third voyage, he speaks of the \"filthy Lake of the\r\nHurrons, Upper Sea of the East, and Bay of the north,\" and yet no one\r\nhas claimed that in this voyage he visited Hudson Bay. Again, elsewhere,\r\nRadisson uses the expression, \"salted lake\" for the Atlantic, which must\r\nbe crossed to reach France.\r\n\r\n4. Thus in the passage \"the ruined house on the seaside\" would seem\r\nto have been one of the lakes mentioned. The Christinos tell them of\r\nEuropeans, whom they have met a few years before, perhaps an earlier\r\nFrench party on Lake Superior or at the Sault. The lake or sea abounded\r\nin islands. This would agree with the Lake of the Woods, where the\r\nChristinos lived, and not Hudson Bay. Whatever place it was it had a\r\ngreat store of cows or buffalo. Lake of the Woods is the eastern limit\r\nof the buffalo. They are not found on the shores of Hudson Bay.\r\n\r\n5. It will be noticed also that he speaks of a river flowing from the\r\nlake, when he had gone further in the bay, evidently the extension of\r\nthe lake, and this river empties itself into the Saguenay. This is\r\nplainly pure nonsense. It would be equally nonsensical to speak of it\r\nin connection with the Hudson Bay, as no river empties from it into the\r\nSaguenay.\r\n\r\nProbably looking at the great River Winnipeg as it flows from Lake of\r\nthe Woods, or Bay of Islands as it was early called, he sees it flowing\r\nnorth-easterly, and with the mistaken views so common among early\r\nvoyageurs, conjectures it to run toward the great Saguenay and to empty\r\ninto it, thence into the St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\n6. This passage shows the point reached, which some interpret as Hudson\r\nBay or James Bay, could not have been so, for it speaks of a further\r\npoint toward the north, toward the sea.\r\n\r\n7. Closely interpreted, it is plain that Radisson[1] had not only not\r\nvisited Hudson or James Bay, but that he had a wrong conception of it\r\naltogether. He is simply giving a vague story of the Christinos.[2]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF HUDSON BAY AND STRAITS\r\n\r\nAs known six years before the first Hudson's Bay Company Expedition\r\nsailed for Hudson Bay.\r\n\r\n(_Taken from Drage's \"Account of a Voyage.\"_)]\r\n\r\nOn the return of Groseilliers and Radisson to Quebec, the former was\r\nmade a prisoner by order of the Governor for illicit trading. The two\r\npartners were fined 4000_l._ for the purpose of erecting a fort at Three\r\nRivers, and 6000_l._ to go to the general funds of New France.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GREAT ENTERPRISE.\r\n\r\nFilled with a sense of injustice at the amount of the fine placed\r\nupon them, the unfortunate traders crossed over to France and sought\r\nrestitution. It was during their heroic efforts to secure a remission of\r\nthe fine that the two partners urged the importance, both in Quebec and\r\nParis, of an expedition being sent out to explore Hudson Bay, of which\r\nthey had heard from the Indians. Their efforts in Paris were fruitless,\r\nand they came back to Quebec, burning for revenge upon the rapacious\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\nDriven to desperation by what they considered a persecution, and no\r\ndoubt influenced by their being Protestant in faith, the adventurers\r\nnow turned their faces toward the English. In 1664 they went to Port\r\nRoyal, in Acadia, and thence to New England. Boston was then the centre\r\nof English enterprise in America, and the French explorers brought their\r\ncase before the merchants of that town. They asserted that having been\r\non Lake Assiniboine, north of Lake Superior, they had there been assured\r\nby the Indians that Hudson Bay could be reached.\r\n\r\nAfter much effort they succeeded in engaging a New England ship, which\r\nwent as far as Lat. 61, to the entrance of Hudson Straits, but on\r\naccount of the timidity of the master of the ship, the voyage was given\r\nup and the expedition was fruitless.\r\n\r\nThe two enterprising men were then promised by the ship-owners the\r\nuse of two vessels to go on their search in 1665, but they were again\r\ndiscouraged by one of the vessels being sent on a trip to Sable Isle and\r\nthe other to the fisheries in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Groseilliers and\r\nRadisson, bitterly disappointed, sought to maintain their rights against\r\nthe ship-owners in the Courts, and actually won their case, but they\r\nwere still unable to organize an expedition.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the almost discouraged Frenchmen met the two Royal\r\nCommissioners who were in America in behalf of Charles II. to settle\r\na number of disputed questions in New England and New York. By one of\r\nthese, Sir George Carteret, they were induced to visit England. Sir\r\nGeorge was no other than the Vice-Chamberlain to the King and Treasurer\r\nof the Navy. He and our adventurers sailed for Europe, were captured\r\nby a Dutch ship, and after being landed on the coast of Spain, reached\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThrough the influence of Carteret they obtained an audience with King\r\nCharles on October 25th, 1666, and he promised that a ship should be\r\nsupplied to them as soon as possible with which to proceed on their\r\nlong-planned journey.\r\n\r\nEven at this stage another influence came into view in the attempt of De\r\nWitt, the Dutch Ambassador, to induce the Frenchmen to desert England\r\nand go out under the auspices of Holland. Fortunately they refused these\r\noffers.\r\n\r\nThe war with the Dutch delayed the expedition for one year, and in the\r\nsecond year their vessel received orders too late to be fitted up for\r\nthe voyage. The assistance of the English ambassador to France, Mr.\r\nMontague, was then invoked by Groseilliers and Radisson, now backed up\r\nby a number of merchant friends to prepare for the voyage.\r\n\r\nThrough this influence, an audience was obtained from Prince Rupert, the\r\nKing's cousin, and his interest was awakened in the enterprise.\r\n\r\nIt was a remarkable thing that at this time the Royal House of England\r\nshowed great interest in trade. A writer of a century ago has said,\r\n\"Charles II., though addicted to pleasure, was capable of useful\r\nexertions, and he loved commerce. His brother, the Duke of York, though\r\npossessed of less ability, was endowed with greater perseverance, and\r\nby a peculiar felicity placed his chief amusement in commercial schemes\r\nwhilst he possessed the whole influence of the State.\" \"The Duke of York\r\nspent half his time in the business of commerce in the city, presiding\r\nfrequently at meetings of courts of directors.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the circumstances were very favourable for the\r\nFrench enthusiasts who were to lead the way to Hudson Bay, and the royal\r\npersonages who were anxious to engage in new and profitable schemes.\r\n\r\nThe first Stock Book (1667) is still in existence in the Hudson's\r\nBay House, in London, and gives an account of the stock taken in the\r\nenterprise even before the Company was organized by charter. First on\r\nthe list is the name of His Royal Highness the Duke of York, and, on the\r\ncredit side of the account, \"By a share presented to him in the stock\r\nand adventure by the Governor and Company, 300_l._\"\r\n\r\nThe second stockholder on the list is the notable Prince Rupert, who\r\ntook 300_l._ stock, and paid it up in the next two years, with the\r\nexception of 100_l._ which he transferred to Sir George Carteret, who\r\nevidently was the guiding mind in the beginning of the enterprise.\r\nChristopher, Duke of Albemarle--the son of the great General Monk, who\r\nhad been so influential in the restoration of Charles II. to the throne\r\nof England, was a stockholder for 500_l._\r\n\r\nThen came as stockholders, and this before the Company had been formally\r\norganized, William, Earl of Craven, well known as a personal friend of\r\nPrince Rupert; Henry, Earl of Arlington, a member of the ruling cabal;\r\nwhile Anthony, Earl of Shaftesbury, the versatile minister of Charles,\r\nis down for 700_l._ Sir George Carteret is charged with between six and\r\nseven hundred pounds' worth of stock; Sir John Robinson, Sir Robert\r\nVyner, Sir Peter Colleton and others with large sums.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, in the year 1667 the project took shape, a number\r\nof those mentioned being responsible for the ship, its cargo, and the\r\nexpenses of the voyage. Among those who seem to have been most ready\r\nwith their money were the Duke of Albemarle, Earl of Craven, Sir\r\nGeorge Carteret, Sir John Robinson, and Sir Peter Colleton. An entry\r\nof great interest is made in connection with the last-named knight.\r\nHe is credited with 96_l._ cash paid to the French explorers, who\r\nwere the originators of the enterprise. It is amusing, however, to\r\nsee Groseilliers spoken of as \"Mr. Gooseberry\"--a somewhat inaccurate\r\ntranslation of his name.\r\n\r\nTwo ships were secured by the merchant adventurers, the _Eaglet_,\r\nCaptain Stannard, and the _Nonsuch Ketch_, Captain Zachariah Gillam. The\r\nformer vessel has almost been forgotten, because after venturing on the\r\njourney, passing the Orkneys, crossing the Atlantic, and approaching\r\nHudson Straits, the master thought the enterprise an impossible one, and\r\nreturned to London.\r\n\r\nSpecial interest attaches to the _Nonsuch Ketch_. It was the successful\r\nvessel, but another notable thing connected with it was that its New\r\nEngland captain, Zachariah Gillam, had led the expedition of 1664,\r\nthough now the vessel under his command was one of the King's ships.[3]\r\n\r\nIt was in June, 1668, that the vessels sailed from Gravesend, on the\r\nThames, and proceeded on their journey, Groseilliers being aboard\r\nthe _Nonsuch_, and Radisson in the _Eaglet_. The _Nonsuch_ found the\r\nBay, discovered little more than half a century before by Hudson, and\r\nexplored by Button, Fox, and James, the last-named less than forty years\r\nbefore. Captain Gillam is said to have sailed as far north as 75° N.\r\nin Baffin Bay, though this is disputed, and then to have returned into\r\nHudson Bay, where, turning southward, he reached the bottom of the Bay\r\non September 29th. Entering a stream, the Nemisco, on the south-east\r\ncorner of the Bay--a point probably not less than 150 miles from the\r\nnearest French possessions in Canada--the party took possession of\r\nit, calling it, after the name of their distinguished patron, Prince\r\nRupert's River.\r\n\r\nHere, at their camping-place, they met the natives of the district,\r\nprobably a branch of the Swampy Crees. With the Indians they held a\r\nparley, and came to an agreement by which they were allowed to occupy\r\na certain portion of territory. With busy hands they went to work and\r\nbuilt a stone fort, in Lat. 51° 20' N., Long. 78° W., which, in honour\r\nof their gracious sovereign, they called \"Charles Fort.\"\r\n\r\nNot far away from their fort lay Charlton Island, with its shores of\r\nwhite sand, and covered over with a growth of juniper and spruce. To\r\nthis they crossed on the ice upon the freezing of the river on December\r\n9th. Having made due preparations for the winter, they passed the long\r\nand dreary time, finding the cold excessive. As they looked out they saw\r\n\"Nature looking like a carcase frozen to death.\"\r\n\r\nIn April, 1669, however, the cold was almost over, and they were\r\nsurprised to see the bursting forth of the spring. Satisfied with their\r\njourney, they left the Bay in this year and sailed southward to Boston,\r\nfrom which port they crossed the ocean to London, and gave an account of\r\ntheir successful voyage.\r\n\r\nThe fame of the pioneer explorer is ever an enviable one. There can be\r\nbut one Columbus, and so for all time this voyage of Zachariah Gillam,\r\nbecause it was the expedition which resulted in the founding of the\r\nfirst fort, and in the beginning of the great movement which has lasted\r\nfor more than two centuries, will be memorable. It was not an event\r\nwhich made much stir in London at the time, but it was none the less the\r\nfirst of a long series of most important and far-reaching activities.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See map opposite.\r\n\r\n[2] Mr. Miller Christie, of London, and others are of opinion that\r\nRadisson visited Hudson Bay on this fourth voyage.\r\n\r\n[3] A copy of the instructions given the captains may be found in State\r\nPapers, London, Charles II., 251, No. 180.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nHUDSON'S BAY COMPANY FOUNDED.\r\n\r\n     Royal charters--Good Queen Bess--\"So miserable a\r\n     wilderness\"--Courtly stockholders--Correct spelling--\"The nonsense\r\n     of the Charters\"--Mighty rivers--Lords of the territory--To execute\r\n     justice--War on infidels--Power to seize--\"Skin for skin\"--Friends\r\n     of the red man.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe success of the first voyage made by the London merchants to Hudson\r\nBay was so marked that the way was open for establishing the Company and\r\ncarrying on a promising trade. The merchants who had given their names\r\nor credit for Gillam's expedition lost no time in applying, with their\r\npatron, Prince Rupert, at their head, to King Charles II. for a Charter\r\nto enable them more safely to carry out their plans. Their application\r\nwas, after some delay, granted on May 2nd, 1670.\r\n\r\nThe modern method of obtaining privileges such as they sought would have\r\nbeen by an application to Parliament; but the seventeenth century was\r\nthe era of Royal Charters. Much was said in England eighty years after\r\nthe giving of this Charter, and again in Canada forty years ago, against\r\nthe illegality and unwisdom of such Royal Charters as the one granted to\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company. These criticisms, while perhaps just, scarcely\r\ncover the ground in question.\r\n\r\nAs to the abstract point of the granting of Royal Charters, there\r\nwould probably be no two opinions to-day, but it was conceded to be a\r\nroyal prerogative two centuries ago, although the famous scene cannot\r\nbe forgotten where Queen Elizabeth, in allowing many monopolies which\r\nshe had granted to be repealed, said in answer to the Address from the\r\nHouse of Commons: \"Never since I was a queen did I put my pen to any\r\ngrant but upon pretext and semblance made to me that it was both good\r\nand beneficial to the subject in general, though private profit to some\r\nof my ancient servants who had deserved well.... Never thought was\r\ncherished in my heart that tended not to my people's good.\"\r\n\r\nThe words, however, of the Imperial Attorney-General and\r\nSolicitor-General, Messrs. Bethel and Keating, of Lincoln's Inn, when\r\nappealed to by the British Parliament, are very wise: \"The questions of\r\nthe validity and construction of the Hudson's Bay Company Charter cannot\r\nbe considered apart from the enjoyment that has been had under it during\r\nnearly two centuries, and the recognition made of the rights of the\r\nCompany in various acts, both of the Government and Legislature.\"\r\n\r\nThe bestowal of such great privileges as those given to the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany are easily accounted for in the prevailing idea as to the royal\r\nprerogative, the strong influence at Court in favour of the applicants\r\nfor the Charter, and, it may be said, in such opinions as that expressed\r\nforty years after by Oldmixon: \"There being no towns or plantations\r\nin this country (Rupert's Land), but two or three forts to defend the\r\nfactories, we thought we were at liberty to place it in our book where\r\nwe pleased, and were loth to let our history open with the description\r\nof so wretched a Colony. For as rich as the trade to those parts has\r\nbeen or may be, the way of living is such that we cannot reckon any man\r\nhappy whose lot is cast upon this Bay.\"\r\n\r\nThe Charter certainly opens with a breath of unrestrained heartiness\r\non the part of the good-natured King Charles. First on the list of\r\nrecipients is \"our dear entirely beloved Prince Rupert, Count Palatine\r\nof the Rhine, Duke of Bavaria and Cumberland, etc,\" who seems to have\r\ntaken the King captive, as if by one of his old charges when he gained\r\nthe name of the fiery Rupert of Edgehill. Though the stock book of the\r\nCompany has the entry made in favour of Christopher, Duke of Albemarle,\r\nyet the Charter contains that of the famous General Monk, who, as \"Old\r\nGeorge,\" stood his ground in London during the year of the plague\r\nand kept order in the terror-stricken city. The explanation of the\r\noccurrence of the two names is found in the fact that the father died in\r\nthe year of the granting of the Charter. The reason for the appearance\r\nof the name of Sir Philip Carteret in the Charter is not so evident, for\r\nnot only was Sir George Carteret one of the promoters of the Company,\r\nbut his name occurs as one of the Court of Adventurers in the year after\r\nthe granting of the Charter. John Portman, citizen and goldsmith of\r\nLondon, is the only member named who is neither nobleman, knight, nor\r\nesquire, but he would seem to have been very useful to the Company as a\r\nman of means.\r\n\r\nThe Charter states that the eighteen incorporators named deserve the\r\nprivileges granted because they \"have at their own great cost and\r\ncharges undertaken an expedition for Hudson Bay, in the north-west parts\r\nof America, for a discovery of a new passage into the South Sea, and for\r\nthe finding of some trade for furs, minerals, and other considerable\r\ncommodities, and by such their undertakings, have already made such\r\ndiscoveries as to encourage them to proceed farther in pursuance of\r\ntheir said design, by means whereof there may probably arise great\r\nadvantage to Us and our kingdoms.\"\r\n\r\nThe full name of the Company given in the Charter is, \"The Governor\r\nand Company of Adventurers of England, trading into Hudson Bay.\" They\r\nhave usually been called \"The Hudson's Bay Company,\" the form of the\r\npossessive case being kept in the name, though it is usual to speak\r\nof the bay itself as Hudson Bay. The adventurers are given the powers\r\nof possession, succession, and the legal rights and responsibilities\r\nusually bestowed in incorporation, with the power of adopting a seal\r\nor changing the same at their \"will and pleasure\"; and this is granted\r\nin the elaborate phraseology found in documents of that period.\r\nFull provision is made in the Charter for the election of Governor,\r\nDeputy-Governor, and the Managing Committee of seven. It is interesting\r\nto notice during the long career of the Company how the simple machinery\r\nthus provided was adapted, without amendment, in carrying out the\r\nimmense projects of the Company during the two and a quarter centuries\r\nof its existence.\r\n\r\nThe grant was certainly sufficiently comprehensive. The opponents of\r\nthe Company in later days mentioned that King Charles gave away in\r\nhis sweeping phrase a vast territory of which he had no conception,\r\nand that it was impossible to transfer property which could not be\r\ndescribed. In the case of the English Colonies along the Atlantic\r\ncoast it was held by the holders of the charters that the frontage\r\nof the seaboard carried with it the strip of land all the way across\r\nthe continent. It will be remembered how, in the settlement with the\r\nCommissioners after the American Revolution, Lord Shelburne spoke of\r\nthis theory as the \"nonsense of the charters.\" The Hudson's Bay Company\r\nwas always very successful in the maintenance of its claim to the full\r\nprivileges of the Charter, and until the time of the surrender of its\r\nterritory to Canada kept firm possession of the country from the shore\r\nof Hudson Bay even to the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe generous monarch gave the Company \"the whole trade of all those\r\nseas, streights, and bays, rivers, lakes, creeks, and sounds, in\r\nwhatsoever latitude they shall be, that lie within the entrance of the\r\nstreights commonly called Hudson's Streights, together with all the\r\nlands, countries, and territories upon the coasts and confines of the\r\nseas, streights, bays, lakes, rivers, creeks, and sounds aforesaid,\r\nwhich are not now actually possessed by any of our subjects, or by the\r\nsubjects of any other Christian prince or State.\"\r\n\r\nThe wonderful water system by which this great claim was extended over\r\nso vast a portion of the American continent has been often described.\r\nThe streams running from near the shore of Lake Superior find their way\r\nby Rainy Lake, Lake of the Woods, and Lake Winnipeg, then by the River\r\nNelson, to Hudson Bay. Into Lake Winnipeg, which acts as a collecting\r\nbasin for the interior, also run the Red River and mighty Saskatchewan,\r\nthe latter in some ways rivalling the Mississippi, and springing from\r\nthe very heart of the Rocky Mountains. The territory thus drained was\r\nall legitimately covered by the language of the Charter. The tenacious\r\nhold of its vast domain enabled the Company to secure in later years\r\nleases of territory lying beyond it on the Arctic and Pacific slopes.\r\nIn the grant thus given perhaps the most troublesome feature was the\r\nexclusion, even from the territory granted, of the portion \"possessed\r\nby the subjects of any other Christian prince or State.\" We shall see\r\nafterwards that within less than twenty years claims were made by the\r\nFrench of a portion of the country on the south side of the Bay; and\r\nalso a most strenuous contention was put forth at a later date for the\r\nFrench explorers, as having first entered in the territory lying in\r\nthe basin of the Red and Saskatchewan Rivers. This claim, indeed, was\r\nadvanced less than fifty years ago by Canada as the possessor of the\r\nrights once maintained by French Canada.\r\n\r\nThe grant in general included the trade of the country, but is made\r\nmore specific in one of the articles of the Charter, in that \"the\r\nfisheries within Hudson's Streights, the minerals, including gold,\r\nsilver, gems, and precious stones, shall be possessed by the Company.\"\r\nIt is interesting to note that the country thus vaguely described is\r\nrecognized as one of the English \"Plantations or Colonies in America,\"\r\nand is called, in compliment to the popular Prince, \"Rupert's Land.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most astounding gift bestowed by the Charter is not that of\r\nthe trade, or what might be called, in the phrase of the old Roman law,\r\nthe \"usufruct,\" but the transfer of the vast territory, possibly more\r\nthan one quarter or a third of the whole of North America, to hold it\r\n\"in free and common socage,\" i.e., as absolute proprietors. The value\r\nof this concession was tested in the early years of this century, when\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company sold to the Earl of Selkirk a portion of the\r\nterritory greater in area than the whole of England and Scotland; and\r\nin this the Company was supported by the highest legal authorities in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nTo the minds of some, even more remarkable than the transfer of the\r\nownership of so large a territory was the conferring upon the Company by\r\nthe Crown of the power to make laws, not only for their own forts and\r\nplantations, with all their officers and servants, but having force over\r\nall persons upon the lands ceded to them so absolutely.\r\n\r\nThe authority to administer justice is also given in no uncertain\r\nterms. The officers of the Company \"may have power to judge all persons\r\nbelonging to the said Governor and Company, or that shall live under\r\nthem, in all causes, whether civil or criminal, according to the laws of\r\nthis kingdom, and execute justice accordingly.\" To this was also added\r\nthe power of sending those charged with offences to England to be tried\r\nand punished. The authorities, in the course of time, availed themselves\r\nof this right. We shall see in the history of the Red River Settlement,\r\nin the very heart of Rupert's Land, the spectacle of a community of\r\nseveral thousands of people within a circle having a radius of fifty\r\nmiles ruled by Hudson's Bay Company authority, with the customs duties\r\ncollected, certain municipal institutions established, and justice\r\nadministered, and the people for two generations not possessed of\r\nrepresentative institutions.\r\n\r\nOne of the powers most jealously guarded by all governments is the\r\ncontrol of military expeditions. There is a settled unwillingness to\r\nallow private individuals to direct or influence them. No qualms of this\r\nsort seem to have been in the royal mind over this matter in connection\r\nwith the Hudson's Bay Company. The Company is fully empowered in the\r\nCharter to send ships of war, men, or ammunition into their plantations,\r\nallowed to choose and appoint commanders and officers, and even to issue\r\nthem their commissions.\r\n\r\nThere is a ludicrous ring about the words empowering the Company to\r\nmake peace or war with any prince or people whatsoever that are not\r\nChristians, and to be permitted for this end to build all necessary\r\ncastles and fortifications. It seems to have the spirit of the old\r\nformula leaving Jews, Turks, and Saracens to the uncovenanted mercies\r\nrather than to breathe the nobler principles of a Christian land.\r\nSurely, seldom before or since has a Company gone forth thus armed\r\n_cap-à-pie_ to win glory and profit for their country.\r\n\r\nAn important proviso of the Charter, which was largely a logical\r\nsequence of the power given to possess the wide territory, was the\r\ngrant of the \"whole, entire, and only Liberty of Trade and Traffick.\"\r\nThe claim of a complete monopoly of trade was held most strenuously by\r\nthe Company from the very beginning. The early history of the Company\r\nabounds with accounts of the steps taken to prevent the incoming of\r\ninterlopers. These were private traders, some from the English colonies\r\nin America, and others from England, who fitted out expeditions to trade\r\nupon the Bay. Full power was given by the Charter \"to seize upon the\r\npersons of all such English or any other subjects, which sail into\r\nHudson's Bay or inhabit in any of the countries, islands, or territories\r\ngranted to the said Governor and Company, without their leave and\r\nlicense in that behalf first had and obtained.\"\r\n\r\nThe abstract question of whether such monopoly may rightly be granted\r\nby a free government is a difficult one, and is variously decided by\r\ndifferent authorities. The \"free trader\" was certainly a person greatly\r\ndisliked in the early days of the Company. Frequent allusions are made\r\nin the minutes of the Company, during the first fifty years of its\r\nexistence, to the arrest and punishment of servants or employés of the\r\nCompany who secreted valuable furs on their homeward voyage for the\r\npurpose of disposing of them. As late as half a century ago, in the more\r\nsettled parts of Rupert's Land, on the advice of a judge who had a high\r\nsense of its prerogative, an attempt was made by the Company to prevent\r\nprivate trading in furs. Very serious local disturbances took place in\r\nthe Red River Settlement at that time, but wiser counsels prevailed, and\r\nin the later years of the Company's régime the imperative character of\r\nthe right was largely relaxed.\r\n\r\nThe Charter fittingly closes with a commendation of the Company by the\r\nKing to the good offices of all admirals, justices, mayors, sheriffs,\r\nand other officers of the Crown, enjoining them to give aid, favour,\r\nhelp, and assistance.\r\n\r\nWith such extensive powers, the wonder is that the Company bears, on the\r\nwhole, after its long career over such an extended area of operations,\r\nand among savage and border people unaccustomed to the restraints of\r\nlaw, so honourable a record. Being governed by men of high standing,\r\nmany of them closely associated with the operations of government\r\nat home, it is very easy to trace how, as \"freedom broadened slowly\r\ndown\" from Charles II. to the present time, the method of dealing with\r\nsubjects and subordinates became more and more gentle and considerate.\r\nAs one reads the minutes of the Company in the Hudson's Bay House for\r\nthe first quarter of a century of its history, the tyrannical spirit,\r\neven so far at the removal of troublesome or unpopular members of the\r\nCommittee and the treatment of rivals, is very evident.\r\n\r\nThis intolerance was of the spirit of the age. In the Restoration,\r\nthe Revolution, and the trials of prisoners after rebellion, men were\r\naccustomed to the exercise of the severest penalties for the crimes\r\ncommitted. As the spirit of more gentle administration of law found its\r\nway into more peaceful times the Company modified its policy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARMS OF THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY.]\r\n\r\nThe Hudson's Bay Company was, it is true, a keen trader, as the motto,\r\n\"Pro Pelle Cutem\"--\"skin for skin\"--clearly implies. With this no fault\r\ncan be found, the more that its methods were nearly all honourable\r\nBritish methods. It never forgot the flag that floated over it. One of\r\nthe greatest testimonies in its favour was that, when two centuries\r\nafter its organization it gave up, except as a purely trading company,\r\nits power to Canada, yet its authority over the wide-spread Indian\r\npopulation of Rupert's Land was so great, that it was asked by the\r\nCanadian Government to retain one-twentieth of the land of that wide\r\ndomain as a guarantee of its assistance in transferring power from the\r\nold to the new régime.\r\n\r\nThe Indian had in every part of Rupert's Land absolute trust in the\r\ngood faith of the Company. To have been the possessor of such absolute\r\npowers as those given by the Charter; to have on the whole \"borne their\r\nfaculties so meek\"; to have been able to carry on government and trade\r\nso long and so successfully, is not so much a commendation of the royal\r\ndonor of the Charter as it is of the clemency and general fairness of\r\nthe administration, which entitled it not only officially but also\r\nreally, to the title \"The Honourable Hudson's Bay Company.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF TRADE.\r\n\r\n     Rich Mr. Portman--Good ship _Prince Rupert_--The early\r\n     adventurers--\"Book of Common Prayer\"--Five forts--Voting a\r\n     funeral--Worth of a beaver--To Hudson Bay and back--Selling\r\n     the pelts--Bottles of sack--Fat dividends--\"Victorious as\r\n     Cæsar\"--\"Golden Fruit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe generation that lived between the founding of the Company and the\r\nend of the century saw a great development in the trade of the infant\r\nenterprise. Meeting sometimes at the place of business of one of the\r\nCommittee, and afterwards at hired premises, the energetic members of\r\nthe sub-committee paid close attention to their work. Sir John Robinson,\r\nSir John Kirke, and Mr. Portman acted as one such executive, and the\r\nmonthly, and at times weekly meetings of the Court of Adventurers were\r\nheld when they were needed. It brings the past very close to us as we\r\nread the minutes, still preserved in the Hudson's Bay House, Leadenhall\r\nStreet, London, of a meeting at Whitehall in 1671, with His Highness\r\nPrince Rupert in the chair, and find the sub-committee appointed to\r\ncarry on the business. Captain Gillam for a number of years remained\r\nin the service of the Company as a trusted captain, and commanded the\r\nship _Prince Rupert_. Another vessel, the _Windingoo_, or _Wyvenhoe\r\nPinck_, was soon added, also in time the _Moosongee Dogger_, then the\r\n_Shaftsbury_, the _Albemarle_, and the _Craven Bark_--the last three\r\nnamed from prominent members of the Company. Not more than three of\r\nthese ships were in use at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe fitting out of these ships was a work needing much attention from\r\nthe sub-committee. Year after year its members went down to Gravesend\r\nabout the end of May, saw the goods which had been purchased placed\r\naboard the ships, paid the captain and men their wages, delivered the\r\nagents to be sent out their commissions, and exercised plenary power in\r\nregard to emergencies which arose. The articles selected indicate very\r\nclearly the kind of trade in which the Company engaged. The inventory\r\nof goods in 1672 shows how small an affair the trade at first was.\r\n\"Two hundred fowling-pieces, and powder and shot; 200 brass kettles,\r\nsize from five to sixteen gallons; twelve gross of knives; 900 or 1000\r\nhatchets,\" is recorded as being the estimate of cargo for that year.\r\n\r\nA few years, however, made a great change. Tobacco, glass beads, 6,000\r\nflints, boxes of red lead, looking-glasses, netting for fishing, pewter\r\ndishes, and pewter plates were added to the consignments. That some\r\nattention was had by the Company to the morals of their employés is seen\r\nin that one ship's cargo was provided with \"a book of common prayer, and\r\na book of homilies.\"\r\n\r\nAbout June 1st, the ship, or ships, sailed from the Thames, rounded\r\nthe North of Scotland, and were not heard of till October, when they\r\nreturned with their valuable cargoes. Year after year, as we read the\r\nrecords of the Company's history, we find the vessels sailing out and\r\nreturning with the greatest regularity, and few losses took place from\r\nwind or weather during that time.\r\n\r\nThe agents of the Company on the Bay seem to have been well selected\r\nand generally reliable men. Certain French writers and also the English\r\nopponents of the Company have represented them as timid men, afraid\r\nto leave the coast and penetrate to the interior, and their conduct\r\nhas been contrasted with that of the daring, if not reckless, French\r\nexplorers. It is true that for about one hundred years the Hudson's\r\nBay Company men did not leave the shores of Hudson Bay, but what was\r\nthe need so long as the Indians came to the coast with their furs and\r\nafforded them profitable trade! By the orders of the Company they opened\r\nup trade at different places on the shores of the Bay, and we learn from\r\nOldmixon that fifteen years after the founding of the Company there were\r\nforts established at (1) Albany River; (2) Hayes Island; (3) Rupert's\r\nRiver; (4) Port Nelson; (5) New Severn. According to another authority,\r\nMoose River takes the place of Hayes Island in this list. These forts\r\nand factories, at first primitive and small, were gradually increased in\r\nsize and comfort until they became, in some cases, quite extensive.\r\n\r\nThe plan of management was to have a governor appointed over each fort\r\nfor a term of years, and a certain number of men placed under his\r\ndirection. In the first year of the Hudson's Bay Company's operations as\r\na corporate body, Governor Charles Bailey was sent out to take charge\r\nof Charles Fort at Rupert's River. With him was associated the French\r\nadventurer, Radisson, and his nephew, Jean Baptiste Groseilliers. Bailey\r\nseems to have been an efficient officer, though fault was found with\r\nhim by the Company. Ten years after the founding of the Company he died\r\nin London, and was voted a funeral by the Company, which took place\r\nby twilight to St. Paul's, Covent Garden. The widow of the Governor\r\nmaintained a contention against the Company for an allowance of 400_l._,\r\nwhich was given after three years' dispute. Another Governor was William\r\nLydall, as also John Bridgar, Governor of the West Main; and again Henry\r\nSargeant, Thomas Phipps, Governor of Fort Nelson, and John Knight,\r\nGovernor of Albany, took an active part in the disputes of the Company\r\nwith the French. Thus, with a considerable amount of friction, the\r\naffairs of the Company were conducted on the new and inhospitable coast\r\nof Hudson Bay.\r\n\r\nTo the forts from the vast interior of North America the various tribes\r\nof Indians, especially the Crees, Chipewyans, and Eskimos, brought\r\ntheir furs for barter. No doubt the prices were very much in favour of\r\nthe traders at first, but during the first generation of traders the\r\ncompetition of French traders from the south for their share of the\r\nIndian trade tended to correct injustice and give the Indians better\r\nprices for their furs.\r\n\r\nThe following is the standard fixed at this time:--\r\n\r\n  Guns                      twelve winter beaver skins for largest,\r\n                              ten for medium,\r\n                              eight for smallest.\r\n  Powder                    a beaver for 1/2 lb.\r\n  Shot                      a beaver for 4 lbs.\r\n  Hatchets                  a beaver for a great and little hatchet.\r\n  Knives                    a beaver for eight great knives and eight\r\n                              jack knives.\r\n  Beads                     a beaver for 1/2 lb. of beads.\r\n  Laced coats               six beavers for one.\r\n  Plain coats               five beavers for one plain red coat.\r\n  Coats for women,\r\n    laced, 2 yds.           six beavers.\r\n  Coats for women, plain    five beavers.\r\n  Tobacco                   a beaver for 1 lb.\r\n  Powder-horn               a beaver for a large powder-horn and two\r\n                              small ones.\r\n  Kettles                   a beaver for 1 lb. of kettle.\r\n  Looking-glass and comb    two skins.\r\n\r\nThe trade conducted at the posts or factories along the shore was\r\ncarried on by the local traders so soon as the rivers from the\r\ninterior--the Nelson and the Churchill--were open, so that by the time\r\nthe ship from London arrived, say in the end of July or beginning of\r\nAugust, the Indians were beginning to reach the coast. The month of\r\nAugust was a busy month, and by the close of it, or early in September,\r\nthe ship was loaded and sent back on her journey.\r\n\r\nBy the end of October the ships arrived from Hudson Bay, and the anxiety\r\nof the Company to learn how the season's trade had succeeded was\r\nnaturally very great. As soon as the vessels had arrived in the Downs\r\nor at Portsmouth, word was sent post haste to London, and the results\r\nwere laid before a Committee of the Company. Much reference is made in\r\nthe minutes to the difficulty of preventing the men employed in the\r\nships from entering into illicit trade in furs. Strict orders were given\r\nto inspect the lockers for furs to prevent private trade. In due time\r\nthe furs were unladen from the ships and put into the custody of the\r\nCompany's secretary in the London warehouse.\r\n\r\nThe matter of selling the furs was one of very great importance. At\r\ntimes the Company found prices low, and deferred their sales until the\r\noutlook was more favourable. The method followed was to have an auction,\r\nand every precaution was taken to have the sales fair and aboveboard.\r\nEvidences are not wanting that at times it was difficult for the Court\r\nof Adventurers to secure this very desirable result.\r\n\r\nThe matter was not, however, one of dry routine, for the London\r\nmerchants seem to have encouraged business with generous hospitality.\r\nOn November 9th, 1681, the sale took place, and the following entry is\r\nfound in the minutes: \"A Committee was appointed to provide three dozen\r\nbottles of sack and three dozen bottles of claret, to be given to buyers\r\nat ye sale. Dinner was also bespoken at 'Ye Stillyard,' of a good dish\r\nof fish, a loyne of veal, two pullets, and four ducks.\"\r\n\r\nAs the years went on, the same variations in furs that we see in our\r\nday took place. New markets were then looked for and arrangements made\r\nfor sending agents to Holland and finding the connections in Russia,\r\nthat sales might be effected. In order to carry out the trade it was\r\nnecessary to take large quantities of hemp from Holland in return for\r\nthe furs sent. The employment of this article for cordage in the Navy\r\nled to the influence of important members of the Company being used with\r\nthe Earl of Marlborough to secure a sale for this commodity. Pending the\r\nsales it was necessary for large sums of money to be advanced to carry\r\non the business of the Company. This was generally accomplished by the\r\nliberality of members of the Company itself supplying the needed amounts.\r\n\r\nThe Company was, however, from time to time gratified by the declaration\r\nof handsome dividends. So far as recorded, the first dividend was\r\ndeclared in 1684, and judged by modern standards it was one for which a\r\ncompany might well wait for a number of years. It was for 50 per cent.\r\nupon stock. Accordingly, the Earl of Craven received 150_l._, Sir James\r\nHayes 150_l._, and so on in proportion. In 1688 another dividend of a\r\nlike amount of 50 per cent. on the stock resulted, and among others,\r\nHon. Robert Boyle, Earl Churchill, and Sir Christopher Wren had their\r\nhearts gladdened. In 1689 profits to the extent of 25 per cent. on the\r\nstock were received, and one of the successful captains was, in the\r\nexuberance of feeling of the stockholders, presented with a silver\r\nflagon in recognition of his services. In 1690, however, took place by\r\nfar the most remarkable event of a financial kind in the early history\r\nof the Company. The returns of that year from the Bay were so large that\r\nthe Company decided to treble its stock. The reasons given for this\r\nwere:--\r\n\r\n(1) The Company has in its warehouse about the value of its original\r\nstock (10,500_l._). (2) The factories at Fort Nelson and New Severn\r\nare increasing in trade, and this year the returns are expected to be\r\n20,000_l._ in beaver. (3) The factories are of much value. (4) Damages\r\nare expected from the French for a claim of 100,000_l._\r\n\r\nThe Company then proceeded to declare a dividend of 25 per cent., which\r\nwas equivalent to 75 per cent. on their original stock.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasing incident to the sovereign of the realm that in all\r\nthese profits he was not forgotten. In the original Charter the only\r\nrecompense coming to the Crown, for the royal gift, was to be the\r\npayment, when the territory was entered upon, of \"two elks and two black\r\nbeavers.\" This may have been a device for keeping up the royal claim,\r\nbut at any rate 300_l_. in the original stock-book stood to the credit\r\nof the sovereign. It had been the custom to send a deputation to present\r\nin person the dividends to His Majesty, and the pounds sterling were\r\nalways changed to guineas.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion of the great dividend, King William III. had but lately\r\nreturned from his victories in Ireland. The deputation, headed by Sir\r\nEdward Dering, was introduced to the King by the Earl of Portland,\r\nand the following address, hitherto, so far as known to the writer,\r\nunpublished, was presented along with the noble gift:--\r\n\r\n\"Your Majestie's most Loyal and Dutiful subjects beg leave to\r\ncongratulate your Majestie's Happy Return here with Honor and Safety.\r\nAnd we do daily pray to Heaven (that Hath God wonderfully preserved your\r\nRoyall Person) that in all your undertakings Your Majestie may be as\r\nvictorious as Cæsar, as beloved as Titus, and (after all) have the long\r\nand glorious Reigne and Peacefull end of Augustus.\r\n\r\n\"On this happy occasion we desire also most humbly to present to your\r\nMajestie a dividend of _Two Hundred and twenty-five guineas_ upon\r\nthree hundred pounds stock in the Hudson's Bay Company, now Rightfully\r\ndelivered to your Majestie. And although we have been the greatest\r\nsufferers of any Company from those common enemies of all mankind the\r\nFrench, yet when your Majestie's just Arms shall have given Repose to\r\nall Christendom, we also shall enjoy our share of these great Benefits\r\nand do not doubt but to appeare often with this golden fruit in our\r\nhands, under the happy influence of Your Majestie's most gracious\r\nprotection over us and all our Concerns.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true that towards the end of the seventeenth century, as we shall\r\nafterwards see, the trade of the Company was seriously injured by the\r\nattacks of the French on the Bay, but a quarter of a century in which\r\nthe possibility of obtaining such profits had been shown was sufficient\r\nto establish the Company in the public favour and to attract to it much\r\ncapital. Its careful management from the first led to its gaining a\r\nreputation for business ability which it has never lost during two and a\r\nquarter centuries of its history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHREE GREAT GOVERNORS.\r\n\r\n     Men of high station--Prince Rupert primus--Prince James,\r\n     \"nemine contradicente\"--The hero of the hour--Churchill River\r\n     named--Plate of solid gold--Off to the Tower.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe success of the Hudson's Bay Company, and the influence exerted by\r\nit during so long a period, has often been attributed to the union of\r\npersons of station and high political influence with the practical and\r\nfar-seeing business men of London, who made up the Company. A perusal of\r\nthe minutes of the first thirty years of the Company's history impresses\r\non the mind of the reader that this is true, and that good feeling and\r\npatriotism were joined with business tact and enterprise in all the\r\nventures. From the prosperous days of Queen Elizabeth and her sea-going\r\ncaptains and explorers, certainly from the time of Charles II., it was\r\nno uncommon thing to see the titled and commercial classes co-operating,\r\nin striking contrast to the governing classes of France, in making\r\ncommerce and trade a prominent feature of the national life.\r\n\r\nThe first Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, Rupert, Prince of\r\nBavaria, grandson by the mother's side of James I. of England, is a\r\nsufficiently well-known character in general history to require no\r\nextended notice. His exploits on the Royalist side in the Civil War,\r\nhis fierce charges and his swiftness in executing difficult military\r\nmovements, led to his name being taken as the very embodiment of energy\r\nand prowess. In this sense the expression, \"the fiery Rupert of debate\"\r\nwas applied to a prominent parliamentarian of the past generation.\r\n\r\nAfter the restoration of Charles II., Prince Rupert took up his abode\r\nin England, finding it more like home to him than any Continental\r\ncountry. Enjoying the plaudits of the Cavaliers, for whom he had so\r\nstrenuously fought, he was appointed Constable of Windsor, a no very\r\nonerous position. From the minutes of the Hudson's Bay Company we\r\nfind that he had lodgings at Whitehall, and spent much of his time in\r\nbusiness and among scientific circles--indeed, the famous toys called\r\n\"glass tears,\" or \"Rupert's drops,\" were brought over by him to England\r\nfrom the Continent to interest his scientific friends.\r\n\r\nWe have seen already the steps taken by the returned Commissioners from\r\nthe American Colonies to introduce Radisson and Groseilliers to Prince\r\nRupert, and through him to the royal notice.\r\n\r\nThe success of the expedition of Gillam and the building of Charles Fort\r\non Hudson Bay led to the Prince consenting to head the new Company.\r\nHe had just passed the half century of his age when he was appointed\r\nGovernor of the vast _terra incognita_ lying to the west of the Bay to\r\nwhich, in his honour, was given the name Rupert's Land.\r\n\r\nThe Company lost no time in undertaking a new expedition. Prince\r\nRupert's intimate friend, the Earl of Craven, was one of the\r\nincorporators, and it was with this nobleman that Prince Rupert's\r\nwidowed mother, the Princess Elizabeth, had found a home in the days of\r\nadversity.\r\n\r\nThe close connection of the Hudson's Bay Company with the Court gave\r\nit, we see very plainly, certain important advantages. Not only do\r\nthe generous terms of the Charter indicate this, but the detailing of\r\ncertain ships of the Royal Navy to protect the merchantmen going out to\r\nHudson Bay shows the strong bond of sympathy. Certainly nothing less\r\nthan the thorough interest of the Court could have led to the firm stand\r\ntaken by the English Government in the controversies with France as to\r\nthe possession of Hudson Bay.\r\n\r\nSeveral excellent paintings of the Prince are in existence, one by\r\nVandyke in Warwick Castle, showing his handsome form, and another in\r\nKnebworth, Hertford. The Prince was unfortunately not free from the\r\nimmorality that was so flagrant a feature of the Court of Charles II. At\r\nthat time this was but little taken into account, and the fame of his\r\nmilitary exploits, together with the fixing of his name upon so wide an\r\nextent of the earth's surface, have served to give posterity an interest\r\nin him.\r\n\r\nFor twelve successive years Prince Rupert was chosen Governor at the\r\nGeneral Court of Adventurers, and used his great influence for the\r\nCompany. He died on November 29th, 1682, at the comparatively early age\r\nof sixty-three.\r\n\r\nThe death of the first Governor was a somewhat severe trial for the\r\ninfant Company. The Prince's name had been one to conjure by, and though\r\nhe had been ably supported by the Deputy-Governor, Sir James Hayes,\r\nyet there was some fear of loss of prestige to the Adventurers on his\r\nunexpected death.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Company were anxious to keep up, if possible, the\r\nroyal connection, but they were by no means clear as to the choice of\r\nthe only available personage who came before their view. James, Duke of\r\nYork, was a man with a liking for business, but he was not a popular\r\nfavourite. The famous _jeu d'esprit_ of Charles II. will be remembered.\r\nWhen James informed Charles II. that there was a conspiracy on foot to\r\ndrive him from the throne, \"No, James,\" said Charles, \"they will never\r\nkill me to make you king.\"\r\n\r\nThe minutes of the Company show that much deliberation took place\r\nas to the choice of a successor to Prince Rupert, but at length, in\r\nJanuary, 1683, at a General Court, the choice was made, and the record\r\nreads:--\"His Royal Highness the Duke of York was chosen Governor of\r\nthe Company, 'Nemine contradicente.' \"The new Governor soon had reasons\r\nto congratulate himself on his election, for on April 21st, 1684, Sir\r\nJames Hayes and Sir Edward Dering reported to the Adventurers their\r\nhaving paid 150 guineas to His Royal Highness as a dividend on the stock\r\nheld by him. Prince James was chosen Governor for three successive\r\nyears, until the year when, on the death of Charles, he became King.\r\nWhile James was not much in favour as a man, yet he possessed decided\r\nadministrative ability, and whether this was the cause or not, certainly\r\nthe period of his governorship was a successful time in the history of\r\nthe Company.\r\n\r\nFailing a prince or duke, the lot could not have fallen upon a more\r\ncapable man than was chosen as the Duke of York's successor for the\r\ngovernorship. On April 2nd, 1685, at a General Court of the Adventurers,\r\nthe choice fell upon one of the most remarkable men of his time, the\r\nRight Hon. John Lord Churchill, afterwards Duke of Marlborough. Lord\r\nChurchill had not yet gained any of his great victories. He was,\r\nhowever, at this time a favourite of the Duke of York, and no doubt,\r\non the recommendation of James, had been brought before the Court of\r\nAdventurers. He was one of the most adroit men of his time, he was on\r\nthe highway to the most distinguished honours, and the Adventurers\r\ngladly elected him third governor.\r\n\r\nOn April 2nd, 1685, the new governor threw himself heartily into the\r\nwork of the Company. No doubt one so closely connected with the public\r\nservice could be of more practical value than even a royal duke. The\r\ngreat dividend of which we have already spoken followed the years of his\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nThe success attained but stimulated the Company to increase their trade\r\nand widen the field of their operations. The river running into the\r\nwest side of the Bay, far to the north, was named in honour of the new\r\ngovernor, Churchill River, and in 1686 expansion of trade was sought by\r\nthe decision to settle at the mouth of this river and use it as a new\r\ntrading centre for the north and west. Without any desire to annoy the\r\nFrench, who claimed the south end of the Bay, it was determined to send\r\na ship to the southern part of Hudson Bay, and a few months later the\r\n_Yonge_ frigate was dispatched. The fear of attacks from the French,\r\nwho were known to be in a very restless condition, led to the request\r\nbeing made to the Government to station a military force at each fort\r\nin Hudson Bay. It was also the desire of the Company that steps should\r\nbe taken to protect them in their Charter rights and to prevent illegal\r\nexpeditions from going to trade in the Bay. All this shows the energy\r\nand hopefulness of the Company under the leadership of Lord Churchill.\r\n\r\nThe part taken by Lord Churchill in the opposition to James, and his\r\nactive agency in inducing William of Orange to come to England, are\r\nwell known. He was a worshipper of the rising sun. On the arrival of\r\nWilliam III., Lord Churchill, who was soon raised to the peerage as\r\nEarl of Marlborough, was as popular, for the time, with the new king\r\nas he had been with his predecessor. His zeal is seen in his sending\r\nout in June, 1689, as governor, the instructions that William and Mary\r\nshould be proclaimed in the posts upon the shores of Hudson Bay. He was\r\nable shortly after to report to his Company that 100 marines had been\r\ndetailed to protect the Company's ships on their way to Hudson Bay. The\r\nenthusiasm of the Company at this mark of consideration obtained through\r\nthe influence of Lord Churchill, was very great, and we learn from the\r\nminutes that profuse thanks were given to the governor, and a piece of\r\nplate of solid gold, of the value of 100 guineas, was presented to him\r\nfor his distinguished services. Legislation was also introduced at this\r\ntime into Parliament for the purpose of giving further privileges to the\r\nAdventurers.\r\n\r\nBut the rising tide of fortune was suddenly checked. Disaster\r\novertook the Governor. William had found some reason for distrusting\r\nthis versatile man of affairs, and he suspected him of being in\r\ncorrespondence with the dethroned James. No doubt the suspicion was well\r\nfounded, but the King had thought it better, on account of Marlborough's\r\ngreat talents, to overlook his unfaithfulness. Suddenly, in May, 1692,\r\nEngland was startled by hearing that the Earl of Marlborough had been\r\nthrown into the Tower on an accusation of high treason. For seven\r\nyears this determined soldier had led the Company to success, but\r\nhis imprisonment rendered a change in the governorship a necessity.\r\nMarlborough was only imprisoned for a short time, but he was not\r\nre-elected to the position he had so well filled. At the General Court\r\nof Adventurers in November of the year of Marlborough's fall, Sir\r\nStephen Evance was chosen Governor. This gentleman was re-elected a\r\nnumber of times, and was Governor of the Company at the close of the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nTwo decades, and more, of the formative life of the Company were thus\r\nlived under the ægis of the Court, the personal management of two\r\ncourtly personages, and under the guidance of the leading general of\r\nhis time. As we shall see afterwards, during a part of this period the\r\naffairs of the Company were carried on in the face of the constant\r\nopposition of the French. Undoubtedly heavy losses resulted from the\r\nFrench rivalry, but the pluck and wisdom of the Company were equally\r\nmanifested in the confidence with which they risked their means, and\r\nthe strong steps taken to retain their hold on Hudson Bay. This was the\r\ngolden age of the Hudson's Bay Company. When money was needed it was\r\noften cheerfully advanced by some of the partners; it was an honour to\r\nhave stock in a Company which was within the shadow of the throne; its\r\ndistinguished Governors were re-elected so long as they were eligible\r\nto serve; again and again the Committee, provided with a rich purse of\r\ngolden guineas, waited on His Majesty the King to give return for the\r\nfavour of the Royal Charter; and never afterward can the historian point\r\nin the annals of the Company to so distinguished a period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTWO ADROIT ADVENTURERS.\r\n\r\n     Peter Radisson and \"Mr. Gooseberry\" again--Radisson\r\n     _v._ Gillam--Back to France--A wife's influence--Paltry\r\n     vessels--Radisson's diplomacy--Deserts to England--Shameful\r\n     duplicity--\"A hogshead of claret\"--Adventurers\r\n     appreciative--Twenty-five years of Radisson's life hitherto\r\n     unknown--\"In a low and mean condition\"--The Company in\r\n     Chancery--Lucky Radisson--A Company pensioner.\r\n\r\n\r\nA mysterious interest gathers around two of the most industrious and,\r\nit must be added, most diplomatic and adroit of the agents of the\r\nCompany, the two Frenchmen, Pierre Esprit Radisson and Medard Chouart,\r\nafterwards the Sieur de Groseilliers. Acquainted with the far northern\r\nfur trade, their assistance was invaluable. We have seen in a former\r\nchapter that finding little encouragement either in New France or their\r\nmother country, they had transferred their services to England, and were\r\nlargely instrumental in founding the Hudson's Bay Company.\r\n\r\nIn the first voyage of the adventurers to Hudson's Bay, it came about\r\nthat while Groseilliers was lucky in being on the _Nonsuch_ ketch, which\r\nmade its way into the Bay, on the other hand, Radisson, to his great\r\nchagrin, was on board the companion ship, the _Eaglet_, which, after\r\nattempting an entrance and failing, returned to England.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that during the time of his enforced idleness in\r\nLondon, while the party was building Charles Fort on Prince Rupert's\r\nRiver, Radisson was busy interesting the leading men of the city in the\r\nimportance of the adventure. Immediately on the return of the company\r\nof the _Nonsuch_, steps were taken for the organization of the Hudson's\r\nBay Company. This, as we have seen, took place in May, 1670, and in the\r\nsame year Radisson and Groseilliers went out with Governor Bailey, and\r\nassisted in establishing trade on the shores of the Bay.\r\n\r\nOn their return, in the autumn of 1671, to London, the two adventurers\r\nspent the winter there, and, as the minutes of the Company show,\r\nreceived certain money payments for their maintenance. In October, 1673,\r\nthe sloop _Prince Rupert_ had arrived at Portsmouth from Hudson Bay, and\r\nthere are evidences of friction between Radisson and Captain Gillam.\r\nRadisson is called on to be present at a meeting of the General Court\r\nof the Company held in October, and afterwards Gillam is authorized to\r\nadvance the amounts necessary for his living expenses.\r\n\r\nIn the Company minutes of June 25th, 1674, is found the following\r\nentry:--\"That there be allowed to Mr. Radisson 100 pounds per annum from\r\nthe time of his last arrival in London, in consideration of services\r\ndone by him, out of which to be deducted what hath been already paid\r\nhim since that time, and if it shall please God to bless this Company\r\nwith good success hereafter that they shall come to be in a prosperous\r\ncondition they will then re-assume the consideration thereof.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the next month a further sum was paid Radisson.\r\n\r\nThe restless Radisson could not, however, be satisfied. No doubt he\r\nfelt his services to be of great value, and he now illustrated what was\r\nreally the weakness of his whole life, a want of honest reliability. The\r\nCompany had done as well for him as its infant resources would allow,\r\nbut along with Groseilliers he deserted from London, and sought to\r\nreturn to the service of France under the distinguished Prime Minister\r\nColbert.\r\n\r\nThe shrewd Colbert knew well Radisson's instability. This feature of his\r\ncharacter had been further emphasized by another event in Radisson's\r\nlife. He had married a daughter of Sir John Kirke, one of the Hudson's\r\nBay Company promoters, and a member of the well-known family which\r\nhad distinguished itself in the capture of Canada, nearly fifty years\r\nbefore. This English and domestic connection made Colbert suspicious\r\nof Radisson. However, he agreed to pay Radisson and Groseilliers the\r\nsum of their debts, amounting to 400_l._, and to give them lucrative\r\nemployment. The condition of his further employment was that Radisson\r\nshould bring his wife to France, but he was unable to get either his\r\nwife or her father to consent to this. The Kirke family, it must be\r\nremembered, were still owners of a claim amounting to 341,000_l._\r\nagainst France, which had been left unsettled during the time of\r\nChamplain, when England restored Canada to France.\r\n\r\nFor seven years Radisson vacillated between the two countries. Under the\r\nFrench he went for one season on a voyage to the West Indies, and was\r\neven promised promotion in the French marine. At one time he applied\r\nagain to the Hudson's Bay Company for employment, but was refused.\r\nThe fixed determination of his wife not to leave England on the one\r\nhand, and the settled suspicion of the French Government on the other,\r\ncontinually thwarted him. At length, in 1681, Radisson and Groseilliers\r\nwere sent by the French to Canada, to undertake a trading expedition\r\nto Hudson Bay. The lack of money, and also of full confidence, led to\r\ntheir venture being poorly provided for. In July, 1682, rendezvous was\r\nmade at Ile Percée, in the lower St. Lawrence, by Radisson in a wretched\r\nold vessel of ten tons, and by Groseilliers in a rather better craft of\r\nfifteen tons burthen.\r\n\r\nNo better could be done, however, and so, after many mishaps, including\r\nserious mutinies, dangers of ice and flood, and hairbreadth escapes, the\r\ntwo vessels reached the mouth of the Hayes River on Hudson Bay. They\r\ndetermined to trade at this point. Groseilliers undertook to build a\r\nsmall fort on this river, and Radisson went inland on a canoe expedition\r\nto meet the natives. In this Radisson was fairly successful and gathered\r\na good quantity of furs.\r\n\r\nThe French adventurers were soon surprised to find that an English\r\nparty had taken possession of the mouth of the Nelson River, and were\r\nestablishing a fort. Radisson opened communication with the English,\r\nand found them in charge of Governor Bridgar, but really led by young\r\nGillam, son of the old captain of the _Nonsuch_. The versatile Frenchman\r\nsoon met a fine field for his diplomatic arts. He professed great\r\nfriendship for the new comers, exchanged frequent visits with them,\r\nand became acquainted with all their affairs. Finding the English short\r\nof provisions, he supplied their lack most generously, and offered to\r\nrender them any service.\r\n\r\nGovernor Bridgar was entirely unable to cope with the wiles of Radisson.\r\nMatters were so arranged that Jean Baptiste Groseilliers, his nephew,\r\nwas left in charge of the forts, to carry on the trade during the next\r\nwinter, and with his brother-in-law, Groseilliers, and Governor Bridgar,\r\nsomewhat of a voluntary prisoner, Radisson sailed away to Canada in\r\nGillam's ship. On reaching Canada Governor De la Barre restored the ship\r\nto the English, and in it Bridgar and Gillam sailed to New England,\r\nwhence in due time they departed for England. The whole affair has\r\na Quixotic appearance, and it is not surprising that Radisson and\r\nGroseilliers were summoned to report themselves to Colbert in France and\r\nto receive his marked displeasure. Their adventure had, however, been so\r\nsuccessful, and the prospects were so good, that the French Government\r\ndetermined to send them out again, in two ships, to reap the fruits of\r\nthe winter's work of the younger Groseilliers.\r\n\r\nNow occurred another of Radisson's escapades. The French expedition was\r\nready to start in April. The day (24th) was fixed. Radisson asked for\r\ndelay, pleading important private business in England. On May 10th he\r\narrived in England, and we find him, without any compunction, entering\r\ninto negotiations with the Hudson's Bay Company, and as a result playing\r\nthe traitor to his engagements in France, his native country.\r\n\r\nThe entry in the Company's minutes bearing on this affair is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                                                      \"_May 12th, 1684._\r\n\r\n  \"Sir James Hayes and Mr. Young, that Peter Esprit Radisson has arrived\r\n  from France; that he has offered to enter their service; that they\r\n  took him to Windsor and presented him to His Royal Highness; that they\r\n  had agreed to give him 50_l._ per annum, 200_l._ worth of stock, and\r\n  20_l._ to set him up to proceed to Port Nelson; and his brother\r\n  (in-law) Groseilliers to have 20_s._ per week, if he come from France\r\n  over to Britain and be true. Radisson took the oath of fidelity to the\r\n  Company.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days later Radisson took the ship _Happy Return_ to Hudson Bay.\r\nSailing immediately to Hayes River, Radisson found that his nephew, J.\r\nBaptiste Groseilliers, had removed his post to an island in the river.\r\nOn his being reached, Radisson explained to him the change that had\r\ntaken place, and that he proposed to transfer everything, establishment\r\nand peltry, to the Hudson's Bay Company. Young Groseilliers, being loyal\r\nto France, objected to this, but Radisson stated that there was no\r\noption, and he would be compelled to submit. The whole quantity of furs\r\ntransferred to Radisson by his nephew was 20,000--an enormous capture\r\nfor the Hudson's Bay Company. In the autumn Radisson returned in the\r\nHudson's Bay Company's ship, bringing the great store of booty.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Committee of the Company (October 7th), \"a packet\r\nwas read from Pierre Radisson showing how he had brought his countrymen\r\nto submit to the English. He was thanked, and a gratuity of 100 guineas\r\ngiven him.\" It is also stated that \"a promise having been made of\r\n20_s._ per week to Groseilliers, and he not having come, the same is\r\ntransferred to his son in the bay.\" The minute likewise tells us that\r\n\"Sir William Young was given a present of seven musquash skins for being\r\ninstrumental in inviting Radisson over from France.\" From this we infer\r\nthat Sir William, who, as we shall afterwards see, was a great friend\r\nand promoter of Radisson, had been the active agent in inducing Radisson\r\nto leave the service of France and enter that of the English Company.\r\n\r\nThe Company further showed its appreciation of Radisson's service by\r\nvoting him 100_l._ to be given to four Frenchmen left behind in Hudson\r\nBay. Jean Baptiste Groseilliers, nephew of Radisson, was also engaged by\r\nthe Company for four years in the service at 100_l._ a year. Radisson\r\nseems to have had some dispute with the Company as to the salary at\r\nthis time. On May 6th, 1685, his salary when out of England was raised\r\nto 100_l._ a year, and 300_l._ to his wife in case of his death.\r\nRadisson refused to accept these terms. The Company for a time would\r\nnot increase its offer, but the time for the ship to sail was drawing\r\nnigh, and the Committee gave way and added to the above amount 100_l._\r\nof stock to be given to his wife. John Bridgar was appointed Governor at\r\nPort Nelson for three years, and Radisson superintendent of the trade\r\nthere. Radisson was satisfied with the new terms, and that the Company\r\nwas greatly impressed with the value of his services is seen in the\r\nfollowing entry: \"A hogshead of claret being ordered for Mr. Radisson,\r\n'such as Mr. R. shall like.'\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1685-6 all hitherto printed accounts of Radisson leave our\r\nredoubtable explorer. We are, for the history up to this date, much\r\nindebted to the Prince Society of Boston for printing an interesting\r\nvolume containing the journals of Radisson, which are preserved in the\r\nBritish Museum in London and in the Bodleian Library in Oxford.\r\n\r\nDr. N. E. Dionne, the accomplished librarian of the Legislative Library,\r\nQuebec, has contributed to the proceedings of the Royal Society of\r\nCanada very appreciative articles entitled, \"Chouart and Radisson.\"\r\nIn these he has relied for the detail of facts of discovery almost\r\nentirely on the publication of the Prince Society. He has, however,\r\nadded much genealogical and local Canadian material, which tends to make\r\nthe history of these early explorers more interesting than it could\r\notherwise be.\r\n\r\nA resident of Manitoba, who has shown an interest in the legends and\r\nearly history of Canada, Mr. L. A. Prudhomme, St. Boniface, Judge of\r\nthe County, has written a small volume of sixty pages on the life of\r\nRadisson. Like the articles of Dr. Dionne, this volume depends entirely\r\nfor its information on the publication of the Prince Society.\r\n\r\nReaders of fiction are no doubt familiar with the appearance of Radisson\r\nin Gilbert Parker's novel, \"The Trail of the Sword.\" It is unnecessary\r\nto state that there seems no historic warrant for the statement, \"Once\r\nhe attempted Count Frontenac's life. He sold a band of our traders to\r\nthe Iroquois.\" The character, thoroughly repulsive in this work of\r\nfiction, does not look to be the real Radisson; and certainly as we\r\nsurvey the bloody scene, which must have been intended for a period\r\nsubsequent to Frontenac's return to Canada in 1689, where Radisson fell\r\ndone to death by the dagger and pistol of the mutineer Bucklaw and was\r\nburied in the hungry sea, we see what was purely imaginary. Of course,\r\nwe do not for a moment criticize the art of the historic novelist, but\r\nsimply state that the picture is not that of the real Radisson, and that\r\nwe shall find Radisson alive a dozen or more years after the tragic end\r\ngiven him by the artist.\r\n\r\nThese three works, as well as the novel, agree in seeing in Radisson a\r\nman of remarkable character and great skill and adroitness.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER HISTORY.\r\n\r\nThe Prince Society volume states: \"We again hear of Radisson in Hudson\r\nBay in 1685, and this is his last appearance in public records as far as\r\nis known.\" The only other reference is made by Dionne and Prudhomme in\r\nstating that Charlevoix declares \"that Radisson died in England.\"\r\n\r\nPatient search in the archives of the Hudson's Bay Company in London\r\nhas enabled the writer to trace the history of Radisson on for many\r\nyears after the date given, and to unearth a number of very interesting\r\nparticulars connected with him; indeed, to add some twenty-five years\r\nhitherto unknown to our century to his life, and to see him pass from\r\nview early in 1710.\r\n\r\nIn 1687, Radisson was still in the employ of the Company, and the\r\nCommittee decided that he should be made a denizen or subject of\r\nEngland. He arrived from Hudson Bay in October of this year, appeared\r\nbefore the Hudson's Bay Company Committee, and was welcomed by its\r\nmembers. It was decided that 50_l._ be given as a gratuity to the\r\nadventurer till he should be again employed. On June 24th, 1688,\r\nRadisson again sailed in the ship for Hudson Bay, and during that year\r\nhe was paid 100_l._ as 50 per cent. dividend on his 200_l._ worth of\r\nstock, and in the following year 50_l._ as 25 per cent. dividend on\r\nhis stock. As the following year, 1690, was the time of the \"great\r\ndividend,\" Radisson was again rejoiced by the amount of 150_l._ as his\r\nshare of the profits.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of the Company appears to have led to an era of\r\nextravagance, and to certain dissensions within the Company itself. The\r\namounts paid Radisson were smaller in accordance with the straits in\r\nwhich the Company found itself arising from French rivalry on the Bay.\r\nIn 1692 Sir William Young is seen strongly urging fuller consideration\r\nfor Radisson, who was being paid at the reduced rate of 50_l._ a year.\r\n\r\nIn the Hudson's Bay Company letter-book of this period we find a most\r\ninteresting memorial of Sir William Young's in behalf of Radisson, with\r\nanswers by the Company, on the whole confirming our narrative, but\r\nstating a few divergent points.\r\n\r\nWe give the memorial in full.\r\n\r\nDated December 20th, 1692, being plea of William Young, in behalf of\r\nPierre Esprit Radisson:--\r\n\r\n\"Radisson, born a Frenchman, educated from a child in Canada, spent\r\nyouth hunting and commercing with the Indians adjacent to Hudson Bay,\r\nmaster of the language, customs, and trade.\r\n\r\n\"Radisson being at New England about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years\r\npast, met there with Colonel Nichols, Governor of New York, and was by\r\nhim persuaded to go to England and proffer his services to King Charles\r\nthe Second, in order to make a settlement of an English factory in that\r\nbay.\r\n\r\n\"At his arrival, the said King, giving credit to Radisson for that\r\nundertaking, granted to Prince Rupert, the Duke of Albemarle, and\r\nothers, the same Charter we do still claim by, thereby constituting\r\nthem the proprietors of the said bay, under which authority he, the\r\nsaid Radisson, went immediately and made an English settlement there\r\naccording to his promises.\r\n\r\n\"On his return to England the King presented him with a medal and gold\r\nchain. When rejected by the Company, he was compelled to return to\r\nCanada, his only place of abode. Joined the French and led an expedition\r\nto Hudson Bay. With the aid of Indians destroyed Company's factory and\r\nplanted a New England factory in Port Nelson River.\r\n\r\n\"During the winter Radisson did no violence to the English, but supplied\r\nthem with victuals, powder, and shot when their ship was cast away.\r\nRefused a present from the Indians to destroy the English, and gave them\r\na ship to convey them away. Afterwards settled the French factory higher\r\nup the same river, where his alliance with the Indians was too strong\r\nfor New England or Old England, and immediately after he went to France.\r\nMr. Young, member of the Hudson's Bay Company, with leave from Sir James\r\nHayes, deputy-governor, tried to hire him back to Hudson's Bay Company's\r\nservice with large promises. During negotiations, Radisson unexpectedly\r\narrived in London. Company's ships were ready to sail. Had just time\r\nto kiss the King's hand at Windsor and that of the Duke of York, then\r\ngovernor. They commended him to the care and kindness of Sir James Hayes\r\nand the Hudson's Bay Company, and commanded that he should be made an\r\nEnglish citizen, which was done in his absence.\r\n\r\n\"Before sending him, the Company gave him two original actions in\r\nHudson's Bay Company stock, and 50_l._ for subsistence money, with large\r\npromises of future rewards for expected service.\r\n\r\n\"Arriving at Port Nelson he put Company in entire possession of that\r\nriver, brought away the French to England, and took all the beavers and\r\nfurs they had traded and gave them to the Company without asking share\r\nof the profits, although they sold for 7,000_l._\r\n\r\n\"He was kindly welcomed in England and again commended by the King.\r\nCommittee presented him with 100 guineas, and entered in the books\r\nthat he should have 50_l._ added to the former 50_l._, until the King\r\nshould find him a place, when the last 50_l._ should cease. Had no place\r\ngiven him. Sir Edward Dering, deputy governor, influenced Committee to\r\nwithdraw 50_l._, so he had only 50_l._ to maintain self, wife, and four\r\nor five children, and servants, 24_l._ of this going for house-rent.\r\nWhen chief factor at Nelson, was tempted by servants to continue to\r\ncheat the Company, was beaten because he refused.\r\n\r\n     \"Prays for payment of 100_l._ and arrears, because:\r\n\r\n     \"1.

Mr. Young further pleads that as Mr. Radisson was the\r\n     author of the Company's prosperity, so he (Mr. Young) was the first\r\n     to persuade him to join their service. That he (Mr. Young) had been\r\n     offered a reward for his services in persuading him, which he had\r\n     utterly refused. But now that this reward be given in the form of\r\n     maintenance for Radisson in his great necessity, &c.\"\r\n\r\nThe Committee passes over the sketch of Radisson's life, which they do\r\nnot gainsay.\r\n\r\nIn the second paragraph, they observe that Mr. Young stated their\r\nneglect to maintain Mr. Radisson without mentioning their reasons for\r\nso doing, which might have shown whether it was their unkindness or\r\nRadisson's desert.\r\n\r\nThey go on to take notice of the fact that about 1681 or 1682, Radisson\r\nand Groseilliers entered into another contract with the Company and\r\nreceived 20_l._ Soon afterwards they absconded, went to France,\r\nand thence to Canada. Next year they joined their countrymen in an\r\nexpedition to Port Nelson, animated by the report of Mr. Abram to the\r\nCompany that it was the best place for a factory. They took their two\r\nbarks up as far as they durst for fear of the English. Then the French\r\nin the fall built a small hut, which Mr. Young says was too strong for\r\neither New England or Old England without guns or works--a place merely\r\nto sleep in, manned only with seven French.\r\n\r\nThis expedition, Mr. Young saith, was at first prejudicial to the\r\nCompany, but afterward of great advantage, which he cannot apprehend.\r\n\r\nIn another place Mr. Young is pleased to state that the New England\r\nsettlement was so strong that the Old could not destroy it. Old England\r\nsettlement was only a house unfortified, which Bridgar built to keep the\r\ngoods dry, because Gillam's boat arrived late.\r\n\r\n\"1. Mr. Young says all are in favour of Radisson but Sir Edward Dering,\r\nwe have not met with any who are in favour but Mr. Young. Those who give\r\ngratuity should know why.\r\n\r\n\"2. That he had no place or honour given him is no reason for giving\r\ngratuity, there being no contract in the case.\r\n\r\n\"3. Never found him accused of cheating and purloining, but breach of\r\ncontract with Company, after receiving their money, we do find him\r\nguilty of.\r\n\r\n\"4. Says he never did capitulate with the Company. Find he did (see\r\nminutes), May 6th, 1685.\r\n\r\n\"5. Cannot believe Radisson was beaten by the Company's servants.\r\nGreater increase of furs after he left, &c., &c., &c.\"\r\n\r\nThis memorial and its answer show the rather unreasonable position\r\ntaken by the Company. In the time of its admiration for Radisson and of\r\nfat dividends, it had provided liberal things; but when money became\r\nscarce, then it was disposed to make matters pleasing to itself, despite\r\nthe claims of Radisson. In the year following the presenting of the\r\nmemorial, it is stated in the minutes that \"Radisson was represented to\r\nthe Company as in a low and mean condition.\" At this time it was ordered\r\nthat 50_l._ be paid Radisson and to be repaid out of the next dividend.\r\n\r\nThe unreasonable position assumed by the Company, in withholding a part\r\nof the salary which they had promised in good faith, filled Radisson\r\nwith a sense of injustice. No doubt guided by his friend, Sir William\r\nYoung, who, on account of his persistence on behalf of the adventurer,\r\nwas now dropped from the Committee of the Company, Radisson filed a bill\r\nin Chancery against the Company, and in July, 1694, notice of this was\r\nserved upon the Committee.\r\n\r\nMuch consternation appears to have filled their minds, and the\r\nDeputy-Governor, Sir Samuel Clark, reported shortly after having used\r\n200_l._ for secret service, the matter being seemingly connected with\r\nthis case.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great influence of the Company, the justice of\r\nRadisson's claims prevailed, and the Court of Chancery ordered the\r\npayment of arrears in full. The Committee afterwards met Sir William\r\nYoung and Richard Craddock, who upheld Radisson's claim. It is reported\r\nthat they agreed to settle the matter by paying Radisson 150_l._, he\r\ngiving a release, and that he should be paid, under seal, 100_l._ per\r\nannum for life, except in those years when the Company should make a\r\ndividend, and then but 50_l._ according to the original agreement.\r\nRadisson then received, as the minutes show, his salary regularly from\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nIn 1698, the Company asked for the renewal by Parliament of its Charter.\r\nRadisson petitioned Parliament for consideration, asking that before\r\nthe request made by the Company for the confirmation of the privileges\r\nsought were granted, a clause should be inserted protecting him in the\r\nregular payment of the amounts due to him from time to time by the\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his petition to Parliament he states that he has four\r\nyoung children, and has only the 100_l._ a year given by the Company to\r\nlive on. In the year 1700 he was still struggling with his straitened\r\ncircumstances, for in that year he applied to the Company to be\r\nappointed warehouse-keeper for the London premises, but his application\r\nwas refused. His children, of whom he is said to have had nine, appear\r\nto have passed over to Canada and to have become a part of the Canadian\r\npeople. His brother-in-law, Groseilliers, had also returned to his\r\nadopted Canada, but is stated to have died before 1698.\r\n\r\nRegularly during the succeeding years the quarterly amount is voted to\r\nRadisson by the Company, until January 6th, 1710, when the last quota\r\nof 12_l._ 10_s._ was ordered to be given. About this time, at the ripe\r\nage of seventy-four, passed away Pierre Esprit Radisson, one of the\r\nmost daring and ingenious men of his time. We know nothing of his death,\r\nexcept from the fact that his pension ceased to be paid.\r\n\r\nJudge Prudhomme, to whose appreciative sketch of Radisson in French we\r\nhave already referred, well summarizes his life. We translate:--\r\n\r\n\"What a strange existence was that of this man! By turns discoverer,\r\nofficer of marine, organizer and founder of the most commercial company\r\nwhich has existed in North America, his life presents an astonishing\r\nvariety of human experiences.\r\n\r\n\"He may be seen passing alternately from the wigwams of the miserable\r\nsavages to the court of the great Colbert; from managing chiefs of the\r\ntribes to addressing the most illustrious nobles of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n\"His courage was of a high order. He looked death in the face more than\r\na hundred times without trepidation. He braved the tortures and the\r\nstake among the Iroquois, the treacherous stratagems of the savages of\r\nthe West, the rigorous winters of the Hudson Bay, and the tropical heat\r\nof the Antilles.\r\n\r\n\"Of an adventurous nature, drawn irresistibly to regions unknown,\r\ncarried on by the enthusiasm of his voyages, always ready to push out\r\ninto new dangers, he could have been made by Fenimore Cooper one of the\r\nheroes of his most exciting romances.\r\n\r\n\"The picture of his life consequently presents many contrasts. The life\r\nof a brigand, which he led with a party of Iroquois, cannot be explained\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"He was blamable in a like manner for having deserted the flag of\r\nFrance, his native country. The first time we might, perhaps, pardon\r\nhim, for he was the victim of grave injustice on the part of the\r\ngovernment of the colony.\r\n\r\n\"No excuse could justify his second desertion. He had none to offer,\r\nnot one. He avowed very candidly that he sought the service of England\r\nbecause he preferred it to that of France.\r\n\r\n\"In marrying the daughter of Mr. John Kirke, he seems to have espoused\r\nalso the nationality of her family. As for him, he would have needed to\r\nchange the proverb, and, in the place of 'One who marries a husband\r\ntakes his country,' to say, 'One who marries a wife takes her country.'\r\n\r\n\"The celebrated discover of the North-West, the illustrious Le\r\nVerendrye, has as much as Radisson, and even more than he, of just\r\nreason to complain of the ingratitude of France; yet how different was\r\nhis conduct!\r\n\r\n\"Just as his persecutions have placed upon the head of the first a\r\nnew halo of glory, so they have cast upon the brow of the second an\r\nineffaceable stain.\r\n\r\n\"Souls truly noble do not seek in treason the recompense for the rights\r\ndenied them.\"\r\n\r\n(For a detailed chronological account of Radisson's life, see Appendix\r\nB, page 487.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nFRENCH RIVALRY.\r\n\r\n     The golden lilies in danger--\"To arrest Radisson\"--The\r\n     land called \"Unknown\"--A chain of claim--Imaginary\r\n     pretensions--Chevalier de Troyes--The brave Lemoynes--Hudson Bay\r\n     forts captured--A litigious governor--Laugh at treaties--The glory\r\n     of France--Enormous claims--Consequential damages.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two great nations which were seeking supremacy in North America came\r\ninto collision all too soon on the shores of Hudson Bay. Along the shore\r\nof the Atlantic, England claimed New England and much of the coast to\r\nthe southward. France was equally bent on holding New France and Acadia.\r\nNow that England had begun to occupy Hudson Bay, France was alarmed, for\r\nthe enemy would be on her northern as well as on her southern border. No\r\ndoubt, too, France feared that her great rival would soon seek to drive\r\nher golden lilies back to the Old World, for New France would be a wedge\r\nbetween the northern and southern possessions of England in the New\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\nThe movement leading to the first voyage to Hudson Bay by Gillam and his\r\ncompany was carefully watched by the French Government. In February,\r\n1668, at which time Gillam's expedition had not yet sailed, the Marquis\r\nde Denonville, Governor of Canada, appointed an officer to go in search\r\nof the most advantageous posts and occupy the shores of the Baie du Nord\r\nand the embouchures of the rivers that enter therein. Among other things\r\nthe governor gave orders \"to arrest especially the said Radisson and his\r\nadherents wherever they may be found.\"\r\n\r\nIntendant Talon, in 1670, sent home word to M. Colbert that ships had\r\nbeen seen near Hudson Bay, and that it was likely that they were\r\nEnglish, and were \"under the guidance of a man des Grozeliers, formerly\r\nan inhabitant of Canada.\"\r\n\r\nThe alarm caused the French by the movements of the English adventurers\r\nwas no doubt increased by the belief that Hudson Bay was included in\r\nFrench territory. The question of what constituted ownership or priority\r\nof claim was at this time a very difficult one among the nations.\r\nWhether mere discovery or temporary occupation could give the right of\r\nownership was much questioned. Colonization would certainly be admitted\r\nto do so, provided there had been founded \"certain establishments.\" But\r\nthe claim of France upon Hudson Bay would appear to have been on the\r\nmere ground of the Hudson Bay region being contiguous or neighbouring\r\nterritory to that held by the French.\r\n\r\nThe first claim made by France was under the commission, as Viceroy to\r\nCanada, given in 1540 by the French King to Sieur de Roberval, which no\r\ndoubt covered the region about Hudson Bay, though not specifying it. In\r\n1598 Lescarbot states that the commission given to De La Roche contained\r\nthe following: \"New France has for its boundaries on the west the\r\nPacific Ocean within the Tropic of Cancer; on the south the islands of\r\nthe Atlantic towards Cuba and Hispaniola; on the east, the Northern Sea\r\nwhich washes its shores, embracing in the north the land called Unknown\r\ntoward the Frozen Sea, up to the Arctic Pole.\"\r\n\r\nThe sturdy common sense of Anglo-Saxon England refused to be bound by\r\nthe contention that a region admittedly \"Unknown\" could be held on a\r\nmere formal claim.\r\n\r\nThe English pointed out that one of their expeditions under Henry Hudson\r\nin 1610 had actually discovered the Bay and given it its name; that Sir\r\nThomas Button immediately thereafter had visited the west side of the\r\nBay and given it the name of New Wales; that Captain James had, about a\r\nscore of years after Hudson, gone to the part of the Bay which continued\r\nto bear his name, and that Captain Fox had in the same year reached\r\nthe west side of the Bay. This claim of discovery was opposed to the\r\nfanciful claims made by France. The strength of the English contention,\r\nnow enforced by actual occupation and the erection of Charles Fort,\r\nmade it necessary to obtain some new basis of objection to the claim of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to resist the conclusion that a deliberate effort was\r\nmade to invent some ground of prior discovery in order to meet the\r\nvisible argument of a fort now occupied by the English. M. de la\r\nPotherie, historian of New France, made the assertion that Radisson and\r\nGroseilliers had crossed from Lake Superior to the Baie du Nord (Hudson\r\nBay). It is true, as we have seen, that Oldmixon, the British writer\r\nof a generation or two later, states the same thing. This claim is,\r\nhowever, completely met by the statement made by Radisson of his third\r\nvoyage that they heard only from the Indians on Lake Superior of the\r\nNorthern Bay, but had not crossed to it by land. We have disposed of\r\nthe matter of his fourth voyage. The same historian also puts forward\r\nwhat seems to be pure myth, that one Jean Bourdon, a Frenchman, entered\r\nthe Bay in 1656 and engaged in trade. It was stated also that a priest,\r\nWilliam Couture, sent by Governor D'Avaugour of New France, had in\r\n1663 made a missionary establishment on the Bay. These are unconfirmed\r\nstatements, having no details, and are suspicious in their time of\r\norigination. The Hudson's Bay Company's answer states that Bourdon's\r\nvoyage was to another part of Canada, going only to 53° N., and not\r\nto the Bay at all. Though entirely unsupported, these claims were\r\nreiterated as late as 1857 by Hon. Joseph Cauchon in his case on behalf\r\nof Canada _v._ Hudson's Bay Company. M. Jeremie, who was Governor of the\r\nFrench forts in Hudson Bay in 1713, makes the statement that Radisson\r\nand Groseilliers had visited the Bay overland, for which there is no\r\nwarrant, but the Governor does not speak of Bourdon or Couture. This\r\ncontradiction of De la Potherie's claim is surely sufficient proof\r\nthat there is no ground for credence of the stories, which are purely\r\napocryphal. It is but just to state, however, that the original claim of\r\nRoberval and De la Roche had some weight in the negotiations which took\r\nplace between the French and English Governments over this matter.\r\n\r\nM. Colbert, the energetic Prime Minister of France, at any rate made up\r\nhis mind that the English must be excluded from Hudson Bay. Furthermore,\r\nthe fur trade of Canada was beginning to feel very decidedly the\r\ninfluence of the English traders in turning the trade to their factories\r\non Hudson Bay. The French Prime Minister, in 1678, sent word to\r\nDuchesnau, the Intendant of Canada, to dispute the right of the English\r\nto erect factories on Hudson Bay. Radisson and Groseilliers, as we have\r\nseen, had before this time deserted the service of England and returned\r\nto that of France. With the approval of the French Government, these\r\nfacile agents sailed to Canada and began the organization, in 1681, of\r\na new association, to be known as \"The Northern Company.\" Fitted out\r\nwith two small barks, _Le St. Pierre_ and _La Ste. Anne_, in 1682, the\r\nadventurers, with their companions, appeared before Charles Fort, which\r\nGroseilliers had helped to build, but do not seem to have made any\r\nhostile demonstration against it. Passing away to the west side of the\r\nBay, these shrewd explorers entered the River Ste. Therese (the Hayes\r\nRiver of to-day) and there erected an establishment, which they called\r\nFort Bourbon.\r\n\r\nThis was really one of the best trading points on the Bay. Some dispute\r\nas to even the occupancy of this point took place, but it would seem\r\nas if Radisson and Groseilliers had the priority of a few months over\r\nthe English party that came to establish a fort at the mouth of the\r\nadjoining River Nelson. The two adventurers, Radisson and Groseilliers,\r\nin the following year came, as we have seen, with their ship-load of\r\npeltries to Canada, and it is charged that they attempted to unload\r\na part of their cargo of furs before reaching Quebec. This led to a\r\nquarrel between them and the Northern Company, and the adroit fur\r\ntraders again left the service of France to find their way back to\r\nEngland. We have already seen how completely these two Frenchmen, in\r\nthe year 1684, took advantage of their own country at Fort Bourbon and\r\nturned over the furs to the Hudson's Bay Company.\r\n\r\nThe sense of injury produced on the minds of the French by the treachery\r\nof these adventurers stirred the authorities up to attack the posts in\r\nHudson Bay. Governor Denonville now came heartily to the aid of the\r\nNorthern Company, and commissioned Chevalier de Troyes to organize an\r\noverland expedition from Quebec to Hudson Bay. The love of adventure\r\nwas strong in the breasts of the young French _noblesse_ in Canada.\r\nFour brothers of the family Le Moyne had become known for their deeds\r\nof valour along the English frontier. Leader among the valorous\r\nFrench-Canadians was Le Moyne D'Iberville, who, though but twenty-four\r\nyears of age, had already performed prodigies of daring. Maricourt, his\r\nbrother, was another fiery spirit, who was known to the Iroquois by a\r\nname signifying \"the little bird which is always in motion.\" Another\r\nleader was Ste. Helene. With a party of chosen men these intrepid\r\nspirits left the St. Lawrence in March, 1685, and threaded the streams\r\nof the Laurentian range to the shore of Hudson Bay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LE MOYNE D'IBERVILLE.]\r\n\r\nAfter nearly three months of the most dangerous and exciting adventures,\r\nthe party reached their destination. The officers and men of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company's service were chiefly civilians unaccustomed\r\nto war, and were greatly surprised by the sudden appearance upon the\r\nBay of their doughty antagonists. At the mouth of the Moose River one\r\nof the Hudson's Bay Company forts was situated, and here the first\r\nattack was made. It was a fort of considerable importance, having four\r\nbastions, and was manned by fourteen guns. It, however, fell before the\r\nfierce assault of the forest rangers. The chief offence in the eyes of\r\nthe French was Charles Fort on the Rupert River, that being the first\r\nconstructed by the English Company. This was also captured and its\r\nfortifications thrown down. At the same time that the main body were\r\nattacking Charles Fort, the brothers Le Moyne, with a handful of picked\r\nmen, stealthily approached in two canoes one of the Company's vessels in\r\nthe Bay and succeeded in taking it.\r\n\r\nThe largest fort on the Bay was that in the marshy region on Albany\r\nRiver. It was substantially built with four bastions and was provided\r\nwith forty-three guns. The rapidity of movement and military skill of\r\nthe French expedition completely paralyzed the Hudson's Bay Company\r\nofficials and men. Governor Sargeant, though having in Albany Fort furs\r\nto the value of 50,000 crowns, after a slight resistance surrendered\r\nwithout the honours of war. The Hudson's Bay Company employés were\r\ngiven permission to return to England and in the meantime the Governor\r\nand his attendants were taken to Charlton Island and the rest of the\r\nprisoners to Moose Fort. D'Iberville afterwards took the prisoners to\r\nFrance, whence they came back to England.\r\n\r\nA short time after this the Company showed its disapproval of Governor\r\nSargeant's course in surrendering Fort Albany so readily. Thinking they\r\ncould mark their disapprobation more strongly, they brought an action\r\nagainst Governor Sargeant in the courts to recover 20,000_l._ After\r\nthe suit had gone some distance, they agreed to refer the matter to\r\narbitration, and the case was ended by the Company having to pay to\r\nthe Governor 350_l._ The affair, being a family quarrel, caused some\r\namusement to the public.\r\n\r\nThe only place of importance now remaining to the English on Hudson Bay\r\nwas Port Nelson, which was near the French Fort Bourbon. D'Iberville,\r\nutilizing the vessel he had captured on the Bay, went back to Quebec in\r\nthe autumn of 1687 with the rich booty of furs taken at the different\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nThese events having taken place at a time when the two countries, France\r\nand England, were nominally at peace, negotiations took place between\r\nthe two Powers.\r\n\r\nLate in the year 1686 a treaty of neutrality was signed, and it was\r\nhoped that peace would ensue on Hudson Bay. This does not seem to have\r\nbeen the case, however, and both parties blame each other for not\r\nobserving the terms of the Act of Pacification. D'Iberville defended\r\nAlbany Fort from a British attack in 1689, departed in that year for\r\nQuebec with a ship-load of furs, and returned to Hudson Bay in the\r\nfollowing year. During the war which grew out of the Revolution, Albany\r\nFort changed hands again to the English, and was afterwards retaken\r\nby the French, after which a strong English force (1692) repossessed\r\nthemselves of it. For some time English supremacy was maintained on the\r\nBay, but the French merely waited their time to attack Fort Bourbon,\r\nwhich they regarded as in a special sense their own. In 1694 D'Iberville\r\nvisited the Bay, besieged and took Fort Bourbon, and reduced the place\r\nwith his two frigates. His brother De Chateauguay was killed during the\r\nsiege.\r\n\r\nIn 1697 the Bay again fell into English hands, and D'Iberville was\r\nput in command of a squadron sent out for him from France, and with\r\nthis he sailed for Hudson Bay. The expedition brought unending glory to\r\nFrance and the young commander. Though one of his warships was crushed\r\nin the ice in the Hudson Straits and his remaining vessels could nowhere\r\nbe seen when he reached the open waters of the Bay, yet he bravely\r\nsailed to Port Nelson, purposing to invest it in his one ship, the\r\n_Pelican_. Arrived at his station, he observed that he was shut in on\r\nthe rear by three English men-of-war. His condition was desperate; he\r\nhad not his full complement of men, and some of those on board were\r\nsick. His vessel had but fifty guns; the English vessels carried among\r\nthem 124. The English vessels, the _Hampshire_, the _Dering_, and the\r\n_Hudson's Bay_, all opened fire upon him. During a hot engagement, a\r\nwell-aimed broadside from the _Pelican_ sank the _Hampshire_ with all\r\nher sails flying, and everything on board was lost; the _Hudson's Bay_\r\nsurrendered unconditionally, and the _Dering_ succeeded in making her\r\nescape. After this naval duel D'Iberville's missing vessels appeared,\r\nand the commander, landing a sufficient number of men, invested and took\r\nPort Nelson. The whole of the Hudson Bay territory thus came into the\r\npossession of the French. The matter has always, however, been looked at\r\nin the light of the brilliant achievement of this scion of the Le Moynes.\r\n\r\nFew careers have had the uninterrupted success of that of Pierre Le\r\nMoyne D'Iberville, although this fortune reached its climax in the\r\nexploit in Hudson Bay. Nine years afterwards the brilliant soldier\r\ndied of yellow fever at Havana, after he had done his best in a\r\ncolonization enterprise to the mouth of the Mississippi which was\r\nnone too successful. Though the treaty of Ryswick, negotiated in this\r\nyear of D'Iberville's triumphs, brought for the time the cessation of\r\nhostilities, yet nearly fifteen years of rivalry, and for much of the\r\ntime active warfare, left their serious traces on Hudson's Bay Company\r\naffairs. A perusal of the minutes of the Hudson's Bay Company during\r\nthis period gives occasional glimpses of the state of war prevailing,\r\nalthough it must be admitted not so vivid a picture as might have been\r\nexpected. As was quite natural, the details of attacks, defences,\r\nsurrenders, and parleys come to us from French sources rather than\r\nfrom the Company's books. That the French accounts are correct is fully\r\nsubstantiated by the memorials presented by the Company to the British\r\nGovernment, asking for recompense for losses sustained.\r\n\r\nIn 1687 a petition was prepared by the Hudson's Bay Company, and a copy\r\nof it is found in one of the letter-books of the Company. This deals\r\nto some extent with the contention of the French king, which had been\r\nlodged with the British Government, claiming priority of ownership of\r\nthe regions about Hudson Bay. The arguments advanced are chiefly those\r\nto which we have already referred. The claim for compensation made upon\r\nthe British Government by the Company is a revelation of how seriously\r\nthe French rivalry had interfered with the progress of the fur trade.\r\nAfter still more serious conflict had taken place in the Bay, and the\r\nCompany had come to be apprehensive for its very existence, another\r\npetition was laid before His Majesty William III., in 1694. This\r\npetition, which also contained the main facts of the claim of 1687, is\r\nso important that we give some of the details of it. It is proper to\r\nstate, however, that a part of the demand is made up of what has since\r\nbeen known as \"consequential damages,\" and that in consequence the\r\nmatter lingered on for at least two decades.\r\n\r\nThe damages claimed were:--\r\n\r\n  1682. Captain Gillam and cargo on _Prince Rupert_.     £    _s._  _d._\r\n        (Captain and a number of men, cargo, and\r\n        ship all lost in hostilities.)

In 1696, \"Le Grand Monarque\" was sufficiently humbled to\r\nmake overtures for peace. The opposing nations accepted these, and on\r\nMay 9th, 1697, the representatives of the nations met at William III.'s\r\nChâteau of Neuberg Hansen, near the village of Ryswick, which is in\r\nBelgium, a short distance from the Hague.\r\n\r\nLouis had encouraged the Jacobite cause, James III. being indeed a\r\nresident of the Castle of St. Germain, near Paris. This had greatly\r\nirritated William, and one of the first things settled at the Treaty was\r\nthe recognition of William as rightful King of England.\r\n\r\nArticle VII. of the Treaty compelled the restoration to the King of\r\nFrance and the King of Great Britain respectively of \"all countries,\r\nislands, forts, and colonies,\" which either had possessed before the\r\ndeclaration of war in 1690. However satisfactory this may have been in\r\nAcadia and Newfoundland, we find that it did not meet the case of the\r\nHudson Bay, inasmuch as the ownership of this region was, as we have\r\nseen, claimed by both parties before the war. In the documents of the\r\nCompany there is evidence of the great anxiety caused to the adventurers\r\nwhen the news reached London, as to what was likely to be the basis of\r\nsettlement of the Treaty. The adventurers at once set themselves to work\r\nto bring influence to bear against the threatened result. The impression\r\nseemed to prevail that they had been \"caught napping,\" and possibly they\r\ncould not accomplish anything. Their most influential deputation came to\r\nthe Hague, and, though late in the day, did avail somewhat.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Article VII. of the Treaty embodies the results of their\r\ninfluence. It is so important for our purpose that we give it in\r\nfull:--\"Commissioners should be appointed on both sides to examine and\r\ndetermine the rights and pretensions which either of the said Kings have\r\nto the places situated in Hudson Bay; but the possession of those places\r\nwhich were taken by the French during the peace that preceded this war,\r\nand were retaken by the English during this war, shall be left to the\r\nFrench, by virtue of the foregoing articles. The capitulation made by\r\nthe English on September 5th, 1695, shall be observed according to the\r\nform and tenor; the merchandises therein mentioned shall be restored;\r\nthe Governor at the fort taken there shall be set at liberty, if it\r\nbe not already done; the differences which have arisen concerning the\r\nexecution of the said capitulation and the value of the goods there\r\nlost, shall be adjudicated and determined by the said commissioners;\r\nwho immediately after the ratification of the present Treaty, shall be\r\ninvested with sufficient authority for the setting of the limits and\r\nconfines of the lands to be restored on either side by virtue of the\r\nforegoing article, and likewise for exchanging of lands, as may conduce\r\nto the mutual interest and advantage of both Kings.\"\r\n\r\nThis agreement presents a few salient points:--\r\n\r\n1. The concession to France of rights (undefined, it is true), but of\r\nrights not hitherto acknowledged by the English.\r\n\r\n2. The case of the Company, which would have been seriously prejudiced\r\nby Article VII., is kept open, and commissioners are appointed to\r\nexamine and decide boundaries.\r\n\r\n3. The claim for damages so urgently pressed by the Hudson's Bay Company\r\nreceives some recognition in the restoration of merchandize and the\r\ninvestigation into the \"value of the goods lost.\"\r\n\r\n4. On the whole, the interests of the Hudson's Bay Company would seem to\r\nhave been decidedly prejudiced by the Treaty.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the Company were in a very unfortunate condition for\r\nfifteen years after the Treaty of Ryswick. The Treaty took place in the\r\nvery year of D'Iberville's remarkable victories in the Bay. That each\r\nnation should hold that of which it was in actual possession meant that\r\nof the seven Hudson's Bay Company forts, only Fort Albany was left to\r\nthe Company. The Company began to petition at once for the appointment\r\nof the Commissioners provided by the Treaty, to settle the matter in\r\ndispute. The desperate condition of their affairs accounts for the\r\nmemorials presented to the British Government by the Company in 1700 and\r\nin the succeeding year, by which they expressed themselves as satisfied\r\nto give the French the southern portion of the Bay from Rupert's River\r\non the east and Albany Fort on the west. About the time of the second of\r\nthese proposals the Hudson's Bay Company sent to the British Government\r\nanother petition of a very different tone, stating their perilous\r\ncondition, arising from their not receiving one-fifth of the usual\r\nquantity of furs, even from Fort Albany, which made their year's trade\r\nan absolute loss; they propose that an expedition of \"three men-of-war,\r\none bomb-vessel, and 250 soldiers\" should be sent to dislodge the French\r\nand to regain the whole Bay for them, as being the original owners. No\r\nsteps on the part of the Ryswick Commissioners seem to have been taken\r\ntoward settling the question of boundaries in Hudson Bay.\r\n\r\nThe great Marlborough victories, however, crushed the power of France,\r\nand when Louis XIV. next negotiated with the allies at Utrecht--\"The\r\nFerry of the Rhine\"--in 1713, the English case was in a very different\r\nform from what it had been at the Treaty of Ryswick. Two years before\r\nthe Treaty, when it was evident that the war would be brought to an end,\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company plucked up courage and petitioned strongly\r\nto be allowed the use of the whole of Hudson Bay, and to have their\r\nlosses on the Bay repaid by France. Several times during the war had\r\nFrance sued for peace at the hands of the allies, but the request had\r\nbeen refused. To humble France seemed to be the fixed policy of all\r\nher neighbours. At the end of the war, in which France was simply able\r\nto hold what she could defend by her fortresses, the great kingdom\r\nof Louis XIV. found itself \"miserably exhausted, her revenue greatly\r\nfallen off, her currency depreciated thirty per cent., the choicest of\r\nher nobles drafted into the army, and her merchants and industrious\r\nartisans weighed down to the ground by heavy imposts.\" This was\r\nEngland's opportunity, and she profited by it. Besides \"the balance of\r\npower\" in Europe being preserved, Great Britain received Nova Scotia,\r\nNewfoundland, certain West India Islands, and the undisturbed control of\r\nthe Iroquois.\r\n\r\nSections X. and XI. of the Treaty are of special value to us in our\r\nrecital. By the former of these the entire west coast of Hudson Bay\r\nbecame British; the French were to evacuate all posts on the Bay and\r\nsurrender all war material within six months; Commissioners were to be\r\nappointed to determine within a year the boundary between Canada and\r\nthe British possessions on Hudson Bay. Section XI. provided \"that the\r\nFrench King should take care that satisfaction be given, according to\r\nthe rule of justice and equity, to the English Company trading to the\r\nBay of Hudson, for all damages and spoil done to their colonies, ships,\r\npersons, and goods, by the hostile incursions and depredations of the\r\nFrench in time of peace.\" This was to be arrived at by Commissioners to\r\nbe appointed.\r\n\r\nIf the Hudson's Bay Company, to quote their own language in regard to\r\nthe Treaty of Ryswick, had been left \"the only mourners by the peace,\"\r\nthey were to be congratulated on the results of the Treaty of Utrecht.\r\nAs in so many other cases, however, disputed points left to be settled\r\nby Commissioners lingered long before results were reached. Six years\r\nafter the Treaty of Utrecht, the Memorial of the Hudson's Bay Company\r\nshows that while they had received back their forts, yet the line of\r\ndelimitation between Canada had not been drawn and their losses had not\r\nbeen paid.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter we have a list of the claims against the French\r\nas computed in 1694, amounting to upwards of 200,000_l._; now, however,\r\nthe amount demanded is not much above 100,000_l._, though the Memorial\r\nexplains that in making up the above modest sum, they had not counted up\r\nthe loss of their forts, nor the damage done to their trade, as had been\r\ndone in the former case. Immediately after the time of this Memorial of\r\nthe Company, the Commissioners were named by Great Britain and France,\r\nand several meetings took place. Statements were then given in, chiefly\r\nas to the boundaries between the British and French possessions in the\r\nneighbourhood of Hudson Bay and Canada. The Commissioners for several\r\nyears practised all the arts of diplomacy, and were farther and farther\r\napart as the discussions went on. No result seems to have been reached,\r\nand the claims of the Hudson's Bay Company, so far as recorded, were\r\nnever met. Peace, however, prevailed in Hudson Bay for many years; the\r\nIndians from the interior, even to the Rocky Mountains, made their\r\nvisits to the Bay for the first forty years of the eighteenth century,\r\nand the fur trade, undisturbed, became again remunerative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nDREAM OF A NORTH-WEST PASSAGE.\r\n\r\n     Stock rises--Jealousy aroused--Arthur Dobbs, Esq.--An\r\n     ingenious attack--Appeal to the \"Old Worthies\"--Captain Christopher\r\n     Middleton--Was the Company in earnest?--The sloop _Furnace_--Dobbs'\r\n     fierce attack--The great subscription--Independent\r\n     expedition--\"Henry Ellis, gentleman\"--\"Without success\"--Dobbs'\r\n     real purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen peace had been restored by the Treaty of Utrecht, the shores of\r\nthe Bay, which had been in the hands of the French since the Treaty of\r\nRyswick, were given over to Great Britain, according to the terms of the\r\nTreaty; they have remained British ever since. The Company, freed from\r\nthe fears of overland incursions by the French from Canada, and from the\r\nfleets that had worked so much mischief by sea, seems to have changed\r\ncharacter in the _personnel_ of the stockholders and to have lost a good\r\ndeal of the pristine spirit. The charge is made that the stockholders\r\nhad become very few, that the stock was controlled by a majority, who,\r\nyear after year, elected themselves, and that considering the great\r\nprivileges conferred by the Charter, the Company was failing to develop\r\nthe country and was sleeping in inglorious ease on the shores of Hudson\r\nBay. Certain it is that Sir Bibye Lake was re-elected Governor year\r\nafter year, from 1720 to 1740.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, however, to have been a spirit of jealousy which\r\nanimated those who made these discoveries as to the Company's inaction.\r\nThe return of peace had brought prosperity to the traders; and dividends\r\nto the stockholders began to be a feature of company life which they had\r\nnot known for more than a quarter of a century. As we shall see, the\r\nstock of the Company was greatly increased in 1720, and preparations\r\nwere being made by the Committee for a wide extension of their\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a man of great personal energy appears on the scene of\r\nEnglish commercial life, who became a bitter opponent of the Company,\r\nand possessed such influence with the English Government that the\r\nCompany was compelled to make a strenuous defence. This was Arthur\r\nDobbs, Esq., an Irishman of undoubted ability and courage. He conducted\r\nhis plan of campaign against the Company along a most ingenious and\r\ndangerous line of attack.\r\n\r\nHe revived the memory among the British people of the early voyages to\r\ndiscover a way to the riches of the East, and appealed to the English\r\nimagination by picturing the interior of the North American Continent,\r\nwith its vast meadows, splendid cascades, rich fur-bearing animals,\r\nand numberless races of Indians, picturesquely dressed, as opening up\r\na field, if they could be reached, of lucrative trade to the London\r\nmerchants. To further his purpose he pointed out the sluggish character\r\nof the Hudson's Bay Company, and clinched his arguments by quoting\r\nthe paragraph in the Charter which stated that the great privileges\r\nconferred by generous Charles II. were bestowed in consideration of\r\ntheir object having been \"The Discovery of a New Passage into the South\r\nSea.\" Dobbs appealed to the sacrifices made and the glories achieved\r\nin earlier days in the attempt to discover the North-West Passage. In\r\nscores of pages, the indefatigable writer gives the accounts of the\r\nearly voyages.\r\n\r\nWe have but to give a passage or two from another author to show what a\r\npowerful weapon Dobbs wielded, and to see how he succeeded in reviving a\r\nquestion which had slumbered well nigh a hundred years, and which again\r\nbecame a living question in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThis writer says:--\"It would lead us far beyond our limits were we\r\nto chronicle all the reasons urged, and the attempts made to 'finde\r\nout that short and easie passage by the North-west, which we have\r\nhitherto so long desired.' Under the auspices of the 'Old Worthies'\r\nreally--though ostensibly countenanced by kings, queens, and nobles--up\r\nrose a race of men, daring and enthusiastic, whose names would add\r\nhonour to any country, and embalm its history.\r\n\r\n\"Commencing with the reign of Henry VII., we have first, John Cabot\r\n(1497), ever renowned; for he it was who first saw and claimed for the\r\n'Banner of England,' the American continent. Sebastian, his son, follows\r\nin the next year--a name honourable and wise. Nor may we omit Master\r\nRobert Thorne of Bristol (1527); Master Hore (1536); and Master Michael\r\nLok (1545), of London--men who knew 'cosmography' and the 'weighty and\r\nsubstantial reasons' for 'a discovery even to the North Pole.' For a\r\nshort time Arctic energy changed its direction from the North-west to\r\nthe North-east (discoveries of the Muscovy Company), but wanting success\r\nin that quarter, again reverted to the North-west. Then we find Martin\r\nFrobisher, George Best, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, James Davis, George\r\nWaymouth, John Knight, the cruelly treated Henry Hudson, James Hall,\r\nSir Thomas Button, Fotherbye, Baffin and Bylot, 'North-west' Luke Fox,\r\nThomas James, &c.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, in the course of sixty years--now breaking the icy fetters\r\nof the North, now chained by them; now big with high hope 'of the\r\nPassage,' then beaten back by the terrific obstacles, as it were,\r\nguarding it--notwithstanding, these men never faltered, never despaired\r\nof finally accomplishing it. Their names are worthy to be held in\r\nremembrance; for, with all their faults, all their strange fancies\r\nand prejudices, still they were a daring and glorious race, calm\r\namid the most appalling dangers; what they did was done correctly,\r\nas far as their limited means went; each added something that gave\r\nus more extended views and a better acquaintance with the globe we\r\ninhabit--giving especially large contributions to geography, with a more\r\nfixed resolution to discover the 'Passage.' By them the whole of the\r\neastern face of North America was made known, and its disjointed lands\r\nin the North, even to 77 deg. or 78 deg. N. Their names will last while\r\nEngland is true to herself.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dobbs awakened much interest among persons of rank in England as\r\nto the desirability of finding a North-West Passage. Especially to the\r\nLords of the Admiralty, on whom he had a strong hold, did he represent\r\nthe glory and value of fitting out an expedition to Hudson Bay on this\r\nquest.\r\n\r\nDobbs mentions in his book the unwilling efforts of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany to meet the demand for a wider examination of the Bay which\r\ntook place a few years after the Peace of Utrecht. In 1719, Captain\r\nJames Knight received orders from the Company to fit out an expedition\r\nand sail up the west coast of the Bay. This he did in two ships, the\r\n_Albany_ frigate, Captain George Barlow, and the _Discovery_, Captain\r\nDavid Vaughan. Captain John Scroggs, in the ship _Whalebone_, two\r\nyears afterward, sailed up the coast in search of the expedition. It\r\nis maintained by the opponents of the Company that these attempts were\r\na mere blind to meet the search for a North-West Passage, and that the\r\nCompany was averse to any real investigation being made.\r\n\r\nIt is of course impossible to say whether this charge was deserved or\r\nnot. The fact that no practicable North-West Passage has ever been\r\ndiscovered renders the arguments drawn from the running of the tides,\r\n&c., of no value, and certainly justifies the Company to some extent in\r\nits inaction. The fact that in 1736 the Hudson's Bay Company yielded to\r\nthe claim raised by Dobbs and his associates, is to be noted in favour\r\nof the Company's contention that while not believing in the existence of\r\nthe North-West Passage, they were willing to satisfy the excited mind of\r\nthe English public. Their expedition of the _Churchill_ sloop, Captain\r\nNapper, and the _Musquash_ sloop, Captain Crow, accomplished nothing in\r\nsolving the question in dispute.\r\n\r\nDisappointed with the efforts made by the Company at his request,\r\nDobbs, in 1737, took in hand to organize an expedition under Government\r\ndirection to go upon the search of the \"Passage.\" At this time he opened\r\ncommunication with Captain Christopher Middleton, one of the best known\r\ncaptains in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company. Middleton, being\r\nsatisfied with the Company's service, refused to leave it. Dobbs then\r\nasked him to recommend a suitable man, and also arranged with Middleton\r\nto be allowed to examine the records kept of his voyages, upon the\r\nHudson's Bay Company ships. This, however, came to nothing.\r\n\r\nAbout 1740 Captain Middleton had cause to differ with the Company on\r\nbusiness matters, and entertained Dobbs' proposition, which was that he\r\nshould be placed in command of a British man-of-war and go in search\r\nof the long-sought North-West Passage. Middleton gave the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany a year's notice, but found them unwilling to let him retire.\r\n\r\nHe had taken the step of resigning deliberately and adhered to it,\r\nthough he was disappointed in his command not being so remunerative as\r\nhe expected. In May, 1741, Captain Middleton received his orders from\r\nthe Lords of the Admiralty to proceed upon his journey and to follow the\r\ndirections given him as to finding a North-West Passage. These had been\r\nprepared under Dobbs' supervision. Directions are given as to his course\r\nof procedure, should he reach California, and also as to what should be\r\ndone in case of meeting Japanese ships. Middleton was placed in charge\r\nof Her Majesty's sloop the _Furnace_, and had as a companion and under\r\nhis orders the _Discovery Pink_, William Moore, Master. In due time,\r\nHudson Bay was reached, but in August the season seemed rather late\r\nto proceed northward from \"Cary's Swan's Nest,\" and it was decided to\r\nwinter in the mouth of Churchill River.\r\n\r\nOn July 1st, 1742, the expedition proceeded northward. Most complete\r\nobservations were made of weather, land, presence of ice, natives of\r\nthe coast, depth of bay, rivers entering bay, tides, and any possible\r\noutlets as far as 88 deg. or 89 deg. W. longitude. Observations were\r\ncontinued until August 18th, when the expedition sailed home to report\r\nwhat it had found.\r\n\r\nCaptain Middleton read an important paper on \"The Extraordinary Degrees\r\nand Surprising Effects of Cold in Hudson Bay,\" before the Royal Society\r\nin London.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Middleton reached the Orkneys on his return voyage than he\r\nforwarded to Dobbs, who was in Ireland, a letter and an abstract of his\r\njournal. Lest this should have gone astray, he sent another copy on his\r\narrival in the Thames. The report was, on the whole, discouraging as to\r\nthe existence of a north-west passage.\r\n\r\nDobbs, however, was unwilling to give up his dream, and soon began to\r\ndiscredit Middleton. He dealt privately with the other officers of the\r\nships, Middleton's subordinates, and with surprising skill turned the\r\ncase against Captain Middleton.\r\n\r\nThe case of Dobbs against Captain Middleton has been well stated by John\r\nBarrow. Middleton was charged with neglect in having failed to explore\r\nthe line of coast which afforded a probability of a passage to the\r\nnorth-west. The principal points at issue appear to have been in respect\r\nto the following discoveries of Middleton, viz. the Wager River, Repulse\r\nBay, and the Frozen Strait. As regards the first, Mr. Dobbs asserted\r\nthat the tide came through the so-called river from the westward; and\r\nthis question was settled in the following year by Captain Moore, who\r\nentirely confirmed Captain Middleton's report.\r\n\r\nRepulse Bay, which well deserves the name it bears, was no less\r\naccurately laid down by Captain Middleton, and of the Frozen Strait,\r\nSir Edward Parry remarks, \"Above all, the accuracy of Captain Middleton\r\nis manifest upon the point most strenuously urged against him, for our\r\nsubsequent experience has not left the smallest doubt of Repulse Bay and\r\nthe northern part of Welcome Bay being filled by a rapid tide, flowing\r\ninto it from the eastward through the Frozen Strait.\"\r\n\r\nDobbs, by a high order of logic chopping, succeeded in turning the\r\ncase, for the time being, against Captain Middleton. Seldom has greater\r\nskill been used to win a cause. He quotes with considerable effect a\r\nletter by Sir Bibye Lake, addressed to the Governor of the Prince of\r\nWales Fort, Churchill River, reading: \"Notwithstanding an order to you,\r\nif Captain Middleton (who is sent ahead in the Government's service to\r\ndiscover a passage north-west) should by inevitable necessity be brought\r\ninto real distress and danger of his life and loss of his ship, in such\r\ncase you are then to give him the best assistance and relief you can.\"\r\nDobbs' whole effort seems to be to show that Middleton was hiding the\r\ntruth, and this, under the influence of his old masters, the Hudson's\r\nBay Company. A copy of Dobbs' Criticisms, laid before the Lords of the\r\nAdmiralty, was furnished Captain Middleton, and his answer is found in\r\n\"Vindication of the Conduct,\" published in 1743.\r\n\r\n\"An Account of the Countries adjoining to Hudson Bay\" by Arthur Dobbs,\r\nEsq., is a book published in the year after, and is really a book\r\nof note. A quarto, consisting of upwards of 200 pages, it showed a\r\nmarvellous knowledge of colonization in America, of the interior of the\r\ncontinent at that time, and incidentally deals with Captain Middleton's\r\njournal. Its account of the journey of \"Joseph La France, a French\r\nCanadese Indian,\" from Lake Superior by way of Lake Winnipeg to Hudson\r\nBay, is the first detailed account on record of that voyage being made.\r\nEvidently Arthur Dobbs had caught the ear of the English people, and the\r\nCompany was compelled to put itself in a thorough attitude of defence.\r\n\r\nDobbs with amazing energy worked up his cause, and what a writer of\r\nthe time calls, \"The long and warm dispute between Arthur Dobbs, Esq.\r\nand Captain Middleton,\" gained much public notice. The glamour of\r\nthe subject of a north-west passage, going back to the exploits of\r\nFrobisher, Baffin, and Button, touched the national fancy, and no doubt\r\nthe charge of wilful concealment of the truth made against the Hudson's\r\nBay Company, repeated so strenuously by Dobbs, gained him adherents.\r\nParliament took action in the matter and voted 20,000_l._ as a reward\r\nfor the discovery of a north-west passage. This caused another wave of\r\nenthusiasm, and immediately a subscription was opened for the purpose of\r\nraising 10,000_l._ to equip an expedition for this popular enterprise.\r\nIt was proposed to divide the whole into 100 shares of 100_l._ each. A\r\nvigorous canvass was made to secure the amount, and the subscription\r\nlist bears the names of several nobles, an archbishop, a bishop, and\r\nmany esquires. A perusal of the names suggests that a number of them are\r\nIrish, and no doubt were obtained by Mr. Dobbs, who was often at Lisburn\r\nin Ireland. The amount raised was 7,200_l._ The expedition, we hear\r\nafterwards, cost upwards of 10,000_l._, but the money needed was, we\r\nare told, willingly contributed by those who undertook the enterprise.\r\nMr. Dobbs, as was suitable, was a leading spirit on the Committee of\r\nManagement.\r\n\r\nTwo ships were purchased by the Committee, the _Dobbs_ galley, 180 tons\r\nburden, Captain William Moore, and the _California_, 140 tons, Captain\r\nFrancis Smith. On May 24th, 1746, the two vessels, provisioned and\r\nwell fitted out for the voyage, left the mouth of the Thames, being\r\nin company with the two ships of the Hudson's Bay Company going to the\r\nBay, the four ships being under the convoy of the ship _Loo_, of forty\r\nguns, as France was at this time at war with England. The voyage was\r\nrather prosperous, with the exception of a very exciting incident on\r\nboard the _Dobbs_ galley. A dangerous fire broke out in the cabin of\r\nthe vessel, and threatened to reach the powder-room, which was directly\r\nunderneath, and contained \"thirty or forty barrels of powder, candles,\r\nspirits, matches, and all manner of combustibles.\" Though, as the writer\r\nsays, \"during the excitement, you might hear all the varieties of sea\r\neloquence, cries, prayers, curses, and scolding, mingled together, yet\r\nthis did not prevent the proper measures being taken to save the ship\r\nand our lives.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of the voyage is given to us in a very interesting manner by\r\nHenry Ellis, gentleman, agent for the proprietors of the expedition.\r\nThough nearly one hundred pages are taken up with the inevitable\r\nsummaries of \"The Several Expeditions to discover a North-West Passage,\"\r\nyet the remaining portion of the book is well written. After the\r\nusual struggle with the ice in Hudson Strait, as it was impossible to\r\nexplore southward during the first season, the _Dobbs_ galley and the\r\n_California_ sailed for Port Nelson, intending to winter there. They\r\narrived on August 26th. Ellis states that they were badly received by\r\nthe Hudson's Bay officers at the first. They, however, laid up their\r\nships in Hayes River, and built an erection of logs on the shore for\r\nthe staff. The officers' winter quarters were called \"Montague House,\"\r\nnamed after the Duke of Montague, patron of the expedition. After a\r\nsevere winter, during which the sailors suffered with scurvy, and,\r\naccording to Ellis, received little sympathy from the occupants of York\r\nFort, the expedition left the mouth of the Hayes River on June 24th, to\r\nprosecute their discovery. After spending the summer coasting Hudson\r\nBay and taking careful notes, the officers of the vessels gladly left\r\nthe inhospitable shore to sail homeward, and the two ships arrived in\r\nYarmouth Roads on October 14th, 1747.\r\n\r\n\"Thus ended,\" says Ellis, \"this voyage, without success indeed, but not\r\nwithout effect; for though we did not discover a north-west passage ...\r\nwe returned with clearer and fuller proofs ... that evidently such a\r\npassage there may be.\" It will be observed that Ellis very much confirms\r\nCaptain Middleton's conclusions, but Mr. Dobbs no doubt made the best of\r\nhis disappointment, and, as we shall see, soon developed what had been\r\nfrom the first his real object, the plan for founding a rival company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE INTERESTING BLUE-BOOK OF 1749.\r\n\r\n     \"Le roi est mort\"--Royalty unfavourable--Earl of\r\n     Halifax--\"Company asleep\"--Petition to Parliament--Neglected\r\n     discovery--Timidity or caution--Strong \"Prince of Wales\"--Increase\r\n     of stock--A timid witness--Claims of discovery--To make\r\n     Indians Christians--Charge of disloyalty--New Company promises\r\n     largely--Result nil.\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur Dobbs, Esq., was evidently worsted in his tilt with the Hudson's\r\nBay Company. His fierce onslaught upon Captain Middleton was no doubt\r\nthe plan of attack to enable him to originate the expedition of the\r\n_Dobbs_ galley and _California_. Even this voyage had brought little\r\nbetter prospect of the discovery of a north-west passage, except the\r\noptimistic words of Ellis, the use of which, indeed, seemed very like\r\nthe delectable exercise of \"extracting sunbeams from cucumbers.\"\r\n\r\nBut the energy of the man was in no way dampened. Indeed, the\r\nindications are, as we survey the features of the time, that he had\r\nstrong backing in the governing circles of the country. Time was when\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company basked in the sunshine of the Court. It is,\r\nperhaps, the penalty of old institutions that as rulers pass away and\r\npolitical parties change, the centre of gravity of influence shifts.\r\nPerhaps the Hudson's Bay Company had not been able to use the convenient\r\nmotto, \"Le Roi est mort: Vive le Roi!\" At any rate the strong Court\r\ninfluence of the Company had passed away, and there is hardly a nobleman\r\nto be found on the list of stockholders submitted by the Company to the\r\nCommittee of the Lords.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when Henry Ellis, the historian of the expedition,\r\nwrites his book in the year after his return, he is permitted to\r\ndedicate it to His Royal Highness Frederick, Prince of Wales, is\r\nprivileged to refer in his dedication to a \"gracious audience\" allowed\r\nhim by the Prince after his return, and to speak of \"the generous care\"\r\nexpressed by the Prince \"for the happy progress of his design.\" Again,\r\nin a similar dedication of a book written four years afterwards by\r\nJoseph Robson, a former employé of the Hudson's Bay Company, but a book\r\nfull of hostility to the Company, allusion is made to the fact that the\r\nEarl of Halifax, Lord Commissioner of Trade and Plantations, gave his\r\nmost hearty approval to such plans as the expedition sought to carry\r\nout. It is said of Lord Halifax, who was called the Father of Colonies:\r\n\"He knows the true state of the nation--that it depends on trade and\r\nmanufactures; that we have more rivals than ever; that navigation is our\r\nbulwark and Colonies our chief support; and that new channels should be\r\nindustriously opened. Therefore, we survey the whole globe in search\r\nof fresh inlets which our ships may enter and traffic.\" Those familiar\r\nwith the work of Lord Halifax will remember that the great colonization\r\nscheme by which Nova Scotia was firmly grappled to the British Empire\r\nand the City of Halifax founded, was his; and the charge made by Dobbs\r\nthat for a generation the \"Company had slept on the shores of the Bay,\"\r\nwould appeal with force to a man of such energetic and progressive\r\nnature as the Lord Commissioner.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Dobbs now came out boldly; not putting the discovery of\r\nthe North-West Passage in the front of his plan, but openly charging\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company with indolence and failure, and asking for the\r\ngranting of a charter to a rival company.\r\n\r\nAs summed up by the sub-committee to which the petition of Dobbs and his\r\nassociates was submitted, the charges were:--\r\n\r\nI. The Company had not discovered, nor sufficiently attempted to\r\ndiscover, the North-West Passage into the southern seas.\r\n\r\nII. They had not extended their settlements to the limits given them by\r\ntheir Charter.\r\n\r\nIII. They had designedly confined their trade within very narrow limits:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Had abused the Indians.\r\n  (_b_) Had neglected their forts.\r\n  (_c_) Ill-treated their own servants.\r\n  (_d_) Encouraged the French.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson's Bay Company, now put on their mettle, exhibited a\r\nconsiderable amount of activity, and filed documents before the\r\nCommittee that in some respects met the charges against them. They\r\nclaimed that they had in the thirty years preceding the investigation\r\ndone a fair amount of exploratory work and discovery. In 1719, they had\r\nsent out the _Albany_ frigate and _Discovery_ to the northern regions,\r\nand neither of them returned to tell the tale. In the same year its\r\nvessels on the Bay, the _Prosperous_ and the _Success_, one from York\r\nFactory, the other from Prince of Wales Fort, had sailed up the coast on\r\nexploratory expeditions. Two years afterward, the _Prosperous_, under\r\nKelsey, made a voyage, and the _Success_, under Captain Napper, had\r\nsailed from York Fort and was lost. In the same year the _Whalebone_,\r\nunder Captain John Scroggs, went from England to Prince of Wales Fort,\r\nand after wintering there, in the following year made a decided effort\r\non behalf of the Passage, but returned unsuccessful. In the year when\r\nDobbs became so persistent (1737) James Napper, who had been saved from\r\nthe wreck of the _Success_ sixteen years before, took command of the\r\n_Churchill_ from Prince of Wales Fort, but on the exploration died, and\r\nthe vessel returned. The _Musquash_, under Captain Crow, accompanied\r\nthe _Churchill_, but returned with no hope of success. This was the\r\ncase presented by the Hudson's Bay Company. It was still open to the\r\nopponents of the Company to say, as they did, that the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany was not in earnest, wanted nothing done to attract rivals, and\r\nwere adepts in concealing their operations and in hoodwinking the public.\r\n\r\nA more serious charge was that they had not sought to reach the\r\ninterior, but had confined their trade to the shores of the Bay. Here\r\nit seems that the opponents of the Company made a better case. It is\r\nindeed unaccountable to us to-day, as we think that the Company had now\r\nbeen eighty years trading on the Bay and had practically no knowledge\r\nof the inheritance possessed by them. At this very time the French,\r\nby way of Lake Superior, had journeyed inland, met Indian tribes,\r\ntraded with them, and even with imposing ceremonies buried metal plates\r\nclaiming the country which the Hudson's Bay Company Charter covered as\r\nlying on rivers, lakes, &c., tributary to Hudson Bay. It is true they\r\nhad submitted instructions to the number of twenty or thirty, in which\r\ngovernors and captains had been urged to explore the interior and extend\r\nthe trade among the Indian tribes. But little evidence could be offered\r\nthat these communications had been acted on.\r\n\r\nThe chief dependence of the Company seems to have been on one Henry\r\nKelsey, who went as a boy to Hudson Bay, but rose to be chief officer\r\nthere. The critics of the Company were not slow to state that Kelsey had\r\nbeen a refugee from their forts and had lived for several seasons among\r\nthe Indians of the interior. Even if this were so, it is still true that\r\nKelsey came to be one of the most enterprising of the wood-runners of\r\nthe Company. Dobbs confronted them with the fact that the voyage from\r\nLake Superior to Hudson Bay had been only made once in their history,\r\nand that by Joseph La France, the Canadian Indian. Certainly, whether\r\nfrom timidity, caution, inertia, or from some deep-seated system of\r\npolicy, it was true that the Company had done little to penetrate the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nThe charge that the Company abused the Indians was hardly substantiated.\r\nThe Company was dependent on the goodwill of the Indians, and had they\r\ntreated them badly, their active rivals, the French, would simply have\r\nreaped the benefit of their folly. That the price charged the Indians\r\nfor goods was as large as the price paid for furs was small, is quite\r\nlikely to have been true. Civilized traders all the world over, dealing\r\nwith ignorant and dependent tribes, follow this policy. No doubt the\r\nrisks of life and limb and goods in remote regions are great, and great\r\nprofits must be made to meet them. It is to be remembered, however,\r\nthat when English and French traders came into competition, as among\r\nthe Iroquois in New York State, and afterwards in the Lake Superior\r\ndistrict, the quality of the English goods was declared by the Indians\r\nbetter and their treatment by the English on the whole more honest and\r\naboveboard than that by the French.\r\n\r\nThat traders should neglect their own forts seems very unlikely. Those\r\ngoing to the Hudson Bay Main expected few luxuries, and certainly did\r\nnot have an easy life, but there was on the part of the Company a vast\r\ndifference in treatment as compared with that given to the fur traders\r\nin New France as they went to the far west. No doubt pressure for\r\ndividends prevented expenditure that was unnecessary, but a perusal of\r\nthe experience of Champlain with his French fur company leads us to\r\nbelieve that the English were far the more liberal and considerate in\r\nthe treatment of employés.\r\n\r\nThe fortress of the River Churchill, known as the Prince of Wales Fort,\r\nwith its great ruins to be seen to-day, belonging to this period, speaks\r\nof a large expense and a high ideal of what a fort ought to be. During\r\nthe examination of witnesses by the Committee, full opportunity was\r\ngiven to show cases of ill-treatment of men and poor administration of\r\ntheir forts. Twenty witnesses were examined, and they included captains,\r\nmerchants, and employés, many of whom had been in the service of the\r\nCompany on the Bay, but whether, as Robson says, \"It must be attributed\r\neither to their confusion upon appearing before so awful an assembly, or\r\nto their having a dependence on the Company and an expectation of being\r\nemployed again in their service,\" little was elicited at all damaging to\r\nthe Company.\r\n\r\nThe charge of the fewness of the forts and the smallness of the trade\r\nwas more serious. That they should have a monopoly of the trade, and\r\nshould neither develop it themselves, nor allow others to develop it,\r\nwould have been to pursue a \"dog in the manger\" policy. They stated that\r\nthey had on an average three ships employed solely on their business,\r\nthat their exports for ten years immediately preceding amounted to\r\n40,240_l._ and their imports 122,835_l._, which they claimed was a\r\nbalance of trade satisfactory to England.\r\n\r\nThe objection that the whole capital of the Company at the commencement,\r\n10,500_l._, was trifling, was perhaps true, but they had made great\r\nprofits, and they used them in the purchase of ships and the building of\r\nforts, and now had a much more valuable property than at the beginning.\r\nThat they had been able to increase their stock so largely was a tribute\r\nto the profits of their business and to its ability to earn dividends on\r\na greatly increased capital stock.\r\n\r\nThe increase of stock as shown by the Company was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Original stock     £10,500\r\n  Trebled in 1690     31,500\r\n  Trebled in 1720     94,500\r\n\r\nAt this time there was a movement to greatly increase the stock, but the\r\nstringency of the money market checked this movement, and subscriptions\r\nof ten per cent. were taken, amounting to 3,150_l._ only. This was also\r\ntrebled and added to the original 94,500_l._, making a total stock of\r\n103,950_l._\r\n\r\nSome three years after the investigation by the Committee, one of the\r\nwitnesses, Joseph Robson, who gave evidence of the very mildest, most\r\nnon-committal character, appears to have received new light, for he\r\npublished a book called, \"An Account of Six Years' Residence in Hudson's\r\nBay.\" He says in the preface, speaking of the evidence given by him in\r\nthe investigation, \"For want of confidence and ability to express myself\r\nclearly, the account I then gave was far from being so exact and full\r\nas that which I intended to have given.\" What the influence was that\r\nso effectually opened Robson's eyes, we do not know. The second part\r\nof this work is a critique of the evidence furnished by the Company,\r\nand from the vigour employed by this writer as compared with the apathy\r\nshown at the investigation, it is generally believed that in the\r\nmeantime he had become a dependent of Dobbs.\r\n\r\nThe plea put forward by the petitioners for the granting of a charter\r\nto them contained several particulars. They had, at their own cost and\r\ncharges, fitted out two ships, the _Dobbs_ galley and _California_,\r\nin search of the North-West Passage to the West and Southern Ocean.\r\nTheir object was, they claimed, a patriotic one, and they aimed at\r\nextending the trade of Great Britain. They maintained that though the\r\nreward offered had been 20,000_l._, it was not sufficient to accomplish\r\nthe end, as they had already spent more than half of that sum.\r\nNotwithstanding this, they had discovered a number of bays, inlets,\r\nand coasts before unknown, and inasmuch as this was the ground of the\r\nCharter issued by Charles II. to the Hudson's Bay Company, they claimed\r\nlike consideration for performing a similar service.\r\n\r\nThe petitioners made the most ample promise as to their future should\r\nthe charter be granted. They would persevere in their search for the\r\npassage to the Southern Ocean of America, of which, notwithstanding the\r\nfrequent failures in finding it, they had a strong hope. The forward\r\npolicy of Lord Halifax of extensive colonization they were heartily in\r\nfavour of, and they undertook to settle the lands they might discover.\r\nThe question had been raised during the investigation, whether the\r\nCompany had done anything to civilize the natives. They had certainly\r\ndone nothing. Probably their answer was that they were a trading\r\ncompany, and never saw the Indians except in the months of the trading\r\nseason, when in July and August they presented themselves from the\r\ninterior at the several factories. The petitioners promised, in regard\r\nto the natives, that they would \"lay the foundation for their becoming\r\nChristians and industrious subjects of His Majesty.\" Beyond the sending\r\nout of a prayer-book from time to time, which seemed to indicate a\r\ndesire to maintain service among their servants, the Company had taken\r\nno steps in this direction.\r\n\r\nThe closing argument for the bestowal of a charter was that they would\r\nprevent French encroachments upon British rights and trade on the\r\ncontinent of America. The petition makes the very strong statement that\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company had connived at, or allowed French and English\r\nto encroach, settle, and trade within their limits on the south side of\r\nthe Bay. Whatever may have been in the mind of the petitioners on this\r\nsubject of conniving with the French, a perusal of the minutes of the\r\nCompany fails to show any such disposition. The Company in Charles II.'s\r\ntimes was evidently more anti-French than the Government. They disputed\r\nthe claim of the French to any part of the Bay, and strongly urged\r\ntheir case before the English Commissioners at the Treaty of Ryswick.\r\nOne of their documents, seemingly showing them to be impressed with\r\nthe claim of priority of ownership of the French King, did propose a\r\ndivision of the Bay, giving the south part of the Bay to the French and\r\nthe remainder to themselves. It is easy to understand a trading company\r\nwishing peace, so that trade might go on, and knowing that Hudson Bay,\r\nwith its enormous coast line, afforded wide room for trade, proposing\r\nsuch a settlement.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, however, the reference is to the great competition which was,\r\nin a few years, to extend through the interior to the Rocky Mountains.\r\nThis was to be indeed a battle royal. Arthur Dobbs, judging by his book,\r\nwhich shows how far ahead he was of his opponents in foresight, saw\r\nthat this must come, and so the new Company promises to penetrate the\r\ninterior, cut off the supply of furs from the French, and save the trade\r\nto Britain. A quarter of a century afterwards, the Hudson's Bay Company,\r\nslow to open their eyes, perceived it too, and as we shall see, rose\r\nfrom their slumbers, and entered the conflict.\r\n\r\nThe Report was made to the Privy Council, expressing appreciation of the\r\npetition, and of the advanced views enunciated, but stating that the\r\ncase against the Hudson's Bay Company had not yet been made out. So no\r\nnew charter was granted!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nFRENCH CANADIANS EXPLORE THE INTERIOR.\r\n\r\n     The \"Western Sea\"--Ardent Duluth--\"Kaministiquia\"--Indian\r\n     boasting--Père Charlevoix--Father Gonor--The man of the hour:\r\n     Verendrye--Indian map maker--The North Shore--A line of forts--The\r\n     Assiniboine country--A notable manuscript--A marvellous\r\n     journey--Glory but not wealth--Post of the Western Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven the French in Canada were animated in their explorations by the\r\ndream of a North-West Passage. The name Lachine at the rapids above\r\nMontreal is the memorial of La Salle's hope that the Western Sea was to\r\nbe reached along this channel. The Lake Superior region seems to have\r\nbeen neglected for twenty years after Radisson and Groseilliers had\r\nvisited Lake Nepigon, or Lake Assiniboines, as they called it.\r\n\r\nBut the intention of going inland from Lake Superior was not lost sight\r\nof by the French explorers, for on a map (Parl. Lib. Ottawa) of date\r\n1680, is the inscription in French marking the Kaministiquia or Pigeon\r\nRiver, \"By this river they go to the Assinepoulacs, for 150 leagues\r\ntoward the north-west, where there are plenty of beavers.\"\r\n\r\nThe stirring events which we have described between 1682 and 1684, when\r\nRadisson deserted from the Hudson's Bay Company and founded for the\r\nFrench King Fort Bourbon on the Bay, were accompanied by a new movement\r\ntoward Lake Superior, having the purpose of turning the stream of trade\r\nfrom Hudson Bay southward to Lake Superior.\r\n\r\nAt this time Governor De La Barre writes from Canada that the English at\r\nHudson Bay had that year attracted to them many of the northern Indians,\r\nwho were in the habit of coming to Montreal, and that he had despatched\r\nthither Sieur Duluth, who had great influence over the western Indians.\r\nGreysolon Duluth was one of the most daring spirits in the service\r\nof France in Canada. Duluth writes (1684) to the Governor from Lake\r\nNepigon, where he had erected a fort, seemingly near the spot where\r\nRadisson and Groseilliers had wintered.\r\n\r\nDuluth says in his ardent manner: \"It remains for me, sir, to assure\r\nyou that all the savages of the north have great confidence in me, and\r\nthat enables me to promise you that before the lapse of two years not\r\na single savage will visit the English at Hudson Bay. This they have\r\nall promised me, and have bound themselves thereto, by the presents I\r\nhave given, or caused to be given them. The Klistinos, Assinepoulacs,\r\n&c., have promised to come to my fort.... Finally, sir, I wish to lose\r\nmy life if I do not absolutely prevent the savages from visiting the\r\nEnglish.\"\r\n\r\nDuluth seems for several years to have carried on trade with the Indians\r\nnorth and west of Lake Nepigon, and no doubt prevented many of them from\r\ngoing to Hudson Bay. But he was not well supported by the Governor,\r\nbeing poorly supplied with goods, and for a time the prosecution of\r\ntrade by the French in the Lake Superior region declined. The intense\r\ninterest created by D'Iberville in his victorious raids on Hudson Bay no\r\ndoubt tended to divert the attention of the French explorers from the\r\ntrade with the interior. The Treaties of Ryswick and Utrecht changed the\r\nwhole state of affairs for the French King, and deprived by the latter\r\nof these treaties of any hold on the Bay, the French in Canada began to\r\nturn their attention to their deserted station on Lake Superior.\r\n\r\nNow, too, the reviving interest in England of the scheme for the\r\ndiscovery of the North-West Passage infected the French. Six years\r\nafter the Treaty of Utrecht, we find (MSS. Ottawa) it stated: \"Messrs.\r\nde Vaudreuil and Begin having written last year that the discovery of\r\nthe Western Sea would be advantageous to the Colony, it was approved\r\nthat to reach it M. de Vaudreuil should establish these posts, which he\r\nhad proposed, and he was instructed at the same time to have the same\r\nestablished without any expense accruing to the King--as the person\r\nestablishing them would be remunerated by trade.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1717 the Governor sent out a French lieutenant, Sieur De\r\nla Noue, who founded a fort at Kaministiquia. In a letter, De la Noue\r\nstates that the Indians are well satisfied with the fort he has erected,\r\nand promise to bring there all those who had been accustomed to trade\r\nat Hudson Bay. Circumstances seem to have prevented this explorer from\r\ngoing and establishing a fort at Tekamiouen (Rainy Lake), and a third at\r\nthe lake still farther to the north-west.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat notable that during the fifty years succeeding the early\r\nvoyages of Radisson and Groseilliers on Lake Superior, the French were\r\nquite familiar with the names of lakes and rivers in the interior\r\nwhich they had never visited. It will be remembered, however, that the\r\nsame thing is true of the English on Hudson Bay. They knew the names\r\nAssiniboines, Christinos, and the like as familiar terms, although they\r\nhad not left the Bay.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this is easily seen. The North-West Indian is a great\r\nnarrator. He tells of large territories, vast seas, and is, in fact, in\r\nthe speech of Hiawatha, \"Iagoo, the great boaster.\" He could map out his\r\nroute upon a piece of birch-bark, and the maps still made by the wild\r\nNorth-Western Indians are quite worthy of note.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the objection brought by the French against\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company of clinging to the shores of the Bay, may be\r\nequally charged against the French on the shore of Lake Superior, or\r\nat least of Lake Nepigon, for the period from its first occupation of\r\nat least seventy years. No doubt the same explanation applies in both\r\ncases, viz. the bringing of their furs to the forts by the Indians made\r\ninland exploration at that time unnecessary.\r\n\r\nBut the time and the man had now come, and the vast prairies of the\r\nNorth-West, hitherto unseen by the white man, were to become the\r\nbattle-ground for a far greater contest for the possession of the fur\r\ntrade than had yet taken place either in Hudson Bay or with the Dutch\r\nand English in New York State.\r\n\r\nThe promoting cause for this forward movement was again the dream of\r\nopening up a North-West Passage. The hold this had upon the French we\r\nsee was less than that upon Frobisher, James, Middleton, or Dobbs among\r\nthe English. Speaking of the French interest in the scheme, Pierre\r\nMargry, keeper of the French Archives in Paris, says: \"The prospect of\r\ndiscovering by the interior a passage to the _Grand Océan_, and by that\r\nto China, which was proposed by our officers under Henry IV., Louis\r\nXIII., and Louis XIV., had been taken up with renewed ardour during\r\nthe Regency. Memorial upon memorial had been presented to the Conseil\r\nde Marine respecting the advisability and the advantage of making this\r\ndiscovery. Indeed, the Père de Charlevoix was sent to America, and made\r\nhis great journey from the north to the south of New France for the\r\npurpose of reliably informing the Council as to the most suitable route\r\nto pursue in order to reach the Western Sea. But the ardour which during\r\nthe life of Philip of Orleans animated the Government regarding the\r\nexploration of the West became feeble, and at length threatened to be\r\ntotally extinguished, without any benefit being derived from the posts\r\nwhich they had already established in the country of the Sioux and at\r\nKaministiquia.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Regent, in choosing between the two plans that Father Charlevoix\r\npresented to him at the close of his journey for the attainment of a\r\nknowledge of the Western Sea, through an unfortunate prudence, rejected\r\nthe suggestion, which, it is true, was the most expensive and uncertain,\r\nviz. an expedition up the Missouri to its source and beyond, and\r\ndecided to establish a post among the Sioux. The post of the Sioux was\r\nconsequently established in 1727. Father Gonor, a Jesuit missionary who\r\nhad gone upon the expedition, we are told, was, however, obliged to\r\nreturn without having been able to discover anything that would satisfy\r\nthe expectations of the Court about the Western Sea.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time Michilimackinac was the depôt of the West. It stood in the\r\nentrance of Lake Michigan--the Gitche Gumee of the Indian tribes, near\r\nthe mouth of the St. Mary River, the outlet of Lake Superior; it was at\r\nthe head of Lake Huron and Georgian Bay alike. Many years afterwards it\r\nwas called the \"Key of the North-West\" and the \"Key of the Upper Lakes.\"\r\nA round island lying a little above the lake, it appealed to the Indian\r\nimagination, and, as its name implies, was likened by them to the\r\nturtle. To it from every side expeditions gathered, and it became the\r\ngreat rendezvous.\r\n\r\nAt Michilimackinac, just after the arrival of Father Gonor, there\r\ncame from the region of Lake Superior a man whose name was to become\r\nillustrious as an explorer, Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, Sieur de\r\nla Verendrye. We have come to know him simply by the single name of\r\nVerendrye.\r\n\r\nThis great explorer was born in Three Rivers, the son of an old officer\r\nof the French army. The young cadet found very little to do in the\r\nNew World, and made his way home to France. He served as a French\r\nofficer in the War of the Spanish Succession, and was severely wounded\r\nin the battle of Malplaquet. On his recovery, he did not receive the\r\nrecognition that he desired, and so went to the western wilds of Canada\r\nand took up the life of a \"coureur de bois.\"\r\n\r\nVerendrye, in pursuing the fur trade, had followed the somewhat deserted\r\ncourse which Radisson and Groseilliers had long before taken, and which\r\na decade before this La Noue had, as we have seen, selected. The fort on\r\nLake Nepigon was still the rendezvous of the savages from the interior,\r\nwho were willing to be turned aside from visiting the English on Hudson\r\nBay. From the Indians who assembled around his fort on Lake Nepigon,\r\nin 1728, Verendrye heard of the vast interior, and had some hopes of\r\nreaching the goal of those who dreamt of a Western Sea.\r\n\r\nAn experienced Indian leader named Ochagach undertook to map out on\r\nbirch bark the route by which the lakes of the interior could be\r\nreached, and the savage descanted with rapture upon the furs to be\r\nobtained if the journey could be made. Verendrye, filled with the\r\nthought of western discovery, went to Quebec, and discussed his purpose\r\nwith the Governor there. He pointed out the route by way of the river\r\nof the Assiniboels, and then the rivers by which Lake Ouinipegon might\r\nbe reached. His estimate was that the Western Sea might be gained by an\r\ninland journey from Lake Superior of 500 leagues.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHOMEDEY DE MAISONNEUVE.\r\n\r\nA daring Pioneer of New France.\r\n\r\n(_From his statue in Montreal._)]\r\n\r\nGovernor Beauharnois considered the map submitted and the opinions of\r\nVerendrye with his military engineer, Chaussegros De Lery; and their\r\nconclusions were favourable to Verendrye's deductions. Verendrye\r\nhad the manner and character which inspired belief in his honesty and\r\ncompetence. He was also helped in his dealings with the Governor at\r\nQuebec by the representations of Father Gonor, whom we have seen had\r\nreturned from the fort established among the Sioux, convinced that the\r\nother route was impracticable.\r\n\r\nFather Gonor entirely sympathized with Verendrye in the belief that\r\nthe only hope lay in passing through the country of the Christinos\r\nand Assiniboels of the North. The Governor granted the explorer the\r\nprivilege of the entire profit of the fur trade, but was unable to give\r\nany assistance in money. Verendrye now obtained the aid of a number of\r\nmerchants in Montreal in providing goods and equipment for the journey,\r\nand in high glee journeyed westward, calling at Michilimackinac to take\r\nwith him the Jesuit Father Messager, to be the companion of his voyage.\r\nNear the end of August, 1731, the expedition was at Pigeon River, long\r\nknown as Grand Portage, a point more than forty miles south-westward of\r\nthe mouth of the Kaministiquia.\r\n\r\nThis was a notable event in history when Verendrye and his crew stood\r\nready to face the hardships of a journey to the interior. No doubt the\r\nway was hard and long, and the men were sulky and discouraged, but the\r\nheroism of their commander shone forth as he saw into the future and led\r\nthe way to a vast and important region.\r\n\r\nOften since that time have important expeditions going to the North-West\r\nbeen seen as they swept by the towering heights of Thunder Cape, and,\r\npassing onward, entered the uninviting mouth of Kaministiquia.\r\n\r\nEighty-five years afterward, Lord Selkirk and his band of one hundred De\r\nMeuron soldiers appeared here in canoes and penetrated to Red River to\r\nregain the lost Fort Douglas.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and twenty-six years after Verendrye, according to an\r\naccount given by an eye-witness--an old Hudson's Bay Company officer--a\r\nCanadian steamer laden high above the decks appeared at the mouth of the\r\nKaministiquia, bearing the Dawson and Hind expedition, to explore the\r\nplains of Assiniboia and pave the way for their admission to Canada.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and thirty-nine years after Verendrye, Sir Garnet Wolseley,\r\nwith his British regulars and Canadian volunteers, swept through Thunder\r\nBay on their way to put down the Red River rebellion.\r\n\r\nAnd now one hundred and sixty-nine years after Verendrye, the splendid\r\nsteamers of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company thrice a week in summer\r\ncarry their living cargo into the mouth of the Kaministiquia to be\r\ntransported by rail to the fast filling prairies of the West.\r\n\r\nYes! it was a great event when Verendrye and his little band of\r\nunwilling voyageurs started inland from the shore of Lake Superior.\r\n\r\nVerendrye, his valiant nephew, De La Jemeraye, and his two sons, were\r\nthe leaders of the expedition. Grand Portage avoids by a nine mile\r\nportage the falls and rapids at the mouth of the Pigeon River, and\r\nnorthward from this point the party went, and after many hardships\r\nreached Rainy Lake in the first season, 1731. Here, at the head of Rainy\r\nRiver, just where it leaves the Lake, they built their first fort, St.\r\nPierre. The writer has examined the site of this fort, just three miles\r\nabove the falls of Rainy River, and seen the mounds and excavations\r\nstill remaining. This seems to have been their furthest point reached\r\nin the first season, and they returned to winter at Kaministiquia. In\r\nthe next year the expedition started inland, and in the month of June\r\nreached their Fort St. Pierre, descended the Rainy River, and with\r\nexultation saw the expanse of the Lake of the Woods.\r\n\r\nThe earliest name we find this lake known by is that given by Verendrye.\r\nHe says it was called Lake Minitie (Cree, Ministik) or Des Bois. (1) The\r\nformer of these names, Minitie, seems to be Ojibway, and to mean Lake\r\nof the Islands, probably referring to the large number of islands to\r\nbe found in the northern half of the Lake. The other name (2), Lac des\r\nBois, or Lake of the Woods, would appear to have been a mistranslation\r\nof the Indian (Ojibway) name by which the Lake was known. The name (3)\r\nwas \"Pikwedina Sagaigan,\" meaning \"the inland lake of the sand hills,\"\r\nreferring to the skirting range of sand hills running for some thirteen\r\nmiles along the southern shore of the Lake to the east of the mouth of\r\nRainy River, its chief tributary.\r\n\r\nAnother name found on a map prepared by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1748\r\nis (4) Lake Nimigon, probably meaning the \"expanse,\" referring to the\r\nopen sheet of water now often called \"La Traverse.\" Two other names,\r\n(5) Clearwater Lake and (6) Whitefish Lake, are clearly the extension\r\nof Clearwater Bay, a north-western part of the Lake, and Whitefish\r\nBay, still given by the Indians to the channel to the east of Grande\r\nPresqu'île.\r\n\r\nOn the south-west side of the Lake of the Woods Verendrye's party built\r\nFort St. Charles, probably hoping then to come in touch with the Sioux\r\nwho visited that side of the lake, and with whom they would seek trade.\r\nAt this point the prospect was very remote of reaching the Western\r\nSea. The expenses were great, and the fur trade did not so far give\r\nsufficient return to justify a further march to the interior. Unassisted\r\nthey had reached in 1733 Lake Ouinipegon (Winnipeg), by descending the\r\nrapid river from Lake of the Woods, to which they gave the name of\r\nMaurepas.\r\n\r\nThe government in Quebec informed the French Minister, M. de Maurepas,\r\nthat they had been told by the adventurous Jemeraye that if the French\r\nKing would bear the expense, they were now certain that the Western Sea\r\ncould be reached. They had lost in going to Lake Ouinipegon not less\r\nthan 43,000 livres, and could not proceed further without aid. The reply\r\nfrom the Court of France was unfavourable; nothing more than the free\r\nprivilege of the fur trade was granted the explorers.\r\n\r\nIn the following year Verendrye built a fort near Lake Ouinipegon, at\r\nthe mouth of the Maurepas River (which we now know as Winnipeg River),\r\nand not far from the present Fort Alexander. The fort was called Fort\r\nMaurepas, although the explorers felt that they had little for which\r\nto thank the French Minister. Still anxious to push on further west,\r\nbut prevented by want of means, they made a second appeal to the\r\nFrench Government in 1735. But again came the same reply of refusal.\r\nThe explorers spent their time trading with the Indians between Lake\r\nWinnipeg and Grand Portage, and coming and going, as they had occasion,\r\nto Lake Superior, and also to Michilimackinac with their cargoes.\r\n\r\nWhile at Fort St. Charles, on the shores of the Lake of the Woods, in\r\n1736, a great disaster overtook the party. Verendrye's eldest son was\r\nvery anxious to return to Kaministiquia, as was also the Jesuit priest,\r\nAnneau, who was in company with the traders. Verendrye was unwilling,\r\nbut at last consented. The party, consisting of the younger Verendrye\r\nand twenty men, were ruthlessly massacred by an ambush of the Sioux on\r\na small island some five leagues from Fort St. Charles, still known as\r\nMassacre Island.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards the crime was discovered, and Verendrye had\r\ndifficulty in preventing his party from accepting the offer of the\r\nAssiniboines and Christinos to follow the Sioux and wreak their\r\nvengeance upon them. During the next year Fort Maurepas was still their\r\nfarthest outpost.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of Fort St. Charles on the south side of the north-west\r\nangle of the Lake of the Woods were in 1908 discovered by St. Boniface\r\nHistorical Society and the remains of young Verendrye's party found\r\nburied in the ruins of the chapel.\r\n\r\nThough no assistance could be obtained from the French Court for western\r\ndiscovery, and although the difficulties seemed almost insurmountable,\r\nVerendrye was unwilling to give up the path open to him. He had the true\r\nspirit of the explorer, and chafed in his little stockade on the shores\r\nof Lake Winnipeg, seeking new worlds to conquer.\r\n\r\nIf it was a great event when Verendrye, in 1731, left the shores of Lake\r\nSuperior to go inland, it was one of equal moment when, penniless and in\r\ndebt, he determined at all hazards to leave the rocks and woods of Lake\r\nWinnipeg, and seek the broad prairies of the West. His decision being\r\nthus reached, the region which is now the fertile Canadian prairies was\r\nentered upon.\r\n\r\nWe are fortunate in having the original journal of this notable\r\nexpedition of 1738, obtained by Mr. Douglas Brymner, former Archivist\r\nat Ottawa. This, with two letters of Bienville, were obtained by Mr.\r\nBrymner from a French family in Montreal, and the identity of the\r\ndocuments has been fully established.\r\n\r\nThis journal covers the time from the departure of Verendrye from\r\nMichilimackinac on July 20th, till say 1739, when he writes from the\r\nheart of the prairies. On September 22nd the brave Verendrye left Fort\r\nMaurepas for the land unknown. It took him but two days with his five\r\nmen to cross in swift canoes the south-east expanse of Lake Winnipeg,\r\nenter the mouth of Red River, and reach the forks of the Red and\r\nAssiniboine Rivers, where the city of Winnipeg now stands.\r\n\r\nIt was thus on September 24th of that memorable year that the eyes of\r\nthe white man first fell on the site of what is destined to be the great\r\ncentral city of Canada. A few Crees who expected him met the French\r\nexplorer there, and he had a conference with two chiefs, who were in the\r\nhabit of taking their furs to the English on Hudson Bay.\r\n\r\nThe water of the Assiniboine River ran at this time very low, but\r\nVerendrye was anxious to push westward. Delayed by the shallowness of\r\nthe Assiniboine, the explorer's progress was very slow, but in six days\r\nhe reached the portage, then used to cross to Lake Manitoba on the route\r\nto Hudson Bay. On this portage now stands the town of Portage la Prairie.\r\n\r\nThe Assiniboine Indians who met Verendrye here told him it would be\r\nuseless for him to ascend the Assiniboine River further, as the water\r\nwas so low. Verendrye was expecting a reinforcement to join his party,\r\nunder his colleague, M. de la Marque. He determined to remain at Portage\r\nla Prairie and to build a fort. Verendrye then assembled the Indians,\r\ngave them presents of powder, ball, tobacco, axes, knives, &c., and in\r\nthe name of the French King received them as the children of the great\r\nmonarch across the sea, and repeated several times to them the orders of\r\nthe King they were to obey.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to notice the skill with which the early French\r\nexplorers dealt with the Indians, and to see the formal way in which\r\nthey took possession of the lands visited. Verendrye states that the\r\nIndians were greatly impressed, \"many with tears in their eyes.\" He adds\r\nwith some _naïveté_, \"They thanked me greatly, promising to do wonders.\"\r\n\r\nOn October 3rd, Verendrye decided to build a fort. He was joined shortly\r\nafter by Messrs. de la Marque and Nolant with eight men in two canoes.\r\nThe fort was soon pushed on, and, with the help of the Indians, was\r\nfinished by October 15th. This was the beginning of Fort de la Reine.\r\nAt this stage in his journal Verendrye makes an important announcement,\r\nbearing on a subject which has been somewhat discussed.\r\n\r\nVerendrye says, \"M. de la Marque told me he had brought M. de Louvière\r\nto the forks with two canoes to build a fort there for the accommodation\r\nof the people of the Red River. I approved of it if the Indians were\r\nnotified.\" This settles the fact that there was a fort at the forks of\r\nthe Red and Assiniboine Rivers, and that it was built in 1738.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of this information, we have been in the habit of fixing\r\nthe building of Fort Rouge at this point from 1735 to 1737. There can\r\nnow be no doubt that October, 1738, is the correct date. From French\r\nmaps, as has been pointed out, Fort Rouge stood at the mouth of the\r\nAssiniboine, on the south side of the river, and the portion of the city\r\nof Winnipeg called Fort Rouge is properly named.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, evident that the forts erected by these early\r\nexplorers were simply winter stations, thrown up in great haste.\r\n\r\nVerendrye and his band of fifty-two persons, Frenchmen and Indians, set\r\nout overland by the Mandan road on October 18th, to reach the Mandan\r\nsettlements of the Missouri. It is not a part of our work to describe\r\nthat journey. Suffice it to say that on December 3rd he was at the\r\ncentral fort of the Mandans, 250 miles from his fort at Portage la\r\nPrairie.\r\n\r\nBeing unable to induce his Assiniboine guides and interpreters to\r\nremain for the winter among the Mandans, Verendrye returned somewhat\r\nunwillingly to the Assiniboine River. He arrived on February 10th at his\r\nFort de la Reine, as he says himself, \"greatly fatigued and very ill.\"\r\n\r\nVerendrye in his journal gives us an excellent opportunity of seeing\r\nthe thorough devotion of the man to his duty. From Fort Michilimackinac\r\nto the Missouri, by the route followed by him, is not less than 1,200\r\nmiles, and this he accomplished, as we have seen with the necessary\r\ndelay of building a fort, between July 20th and December 3rd--136\r\ndays--of this wonderful year of 1738.\r\n\r\nStruggling with difficulties, satisfying creditors, hoping for\r\nassistance from France, but ever patriotic and single-minded, Verendrye\r\nbecame the leading spirit in Western exploration. In the year after his\r\ngreat expedition to the prairies, he was summoned to Montreal to resist\r\na lawsuit brought against him. The prevailing sin of French Canada was\r\njealousy. Though Verendrye had struggled so bravely to explore the\r\ncountry, there were those who whispered in the ear of the Minister of\r\nthe French Court that he was selfish and unworthy. In his heart-broken\r\nreply to the charges, he says, \"If more than 40,000 livres of debt which\r\nI have on my shoulders are an advantage, then I can flatter myself that\r\nI am very rich.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1741 a fruitless attempt was made to reach the Mandans, but in the\r\nfollowing year Verendrye's eldest surviving son and his brother, known\r\nas the Chevalier, having with them only two Canadians, left Forte de la\r\nReine, and made in this and the succeeding year one of the most famous\r\nof the Verendrye discoveries. This lies beyond the field of our inquiry,\r\nbeing the journey to the Missouri, and up to an eastern spur of the\r\nRocky Mountains. Parkman, in his \"A Half Century of Conflict,\" has given\r\na detailed account of this remarkable journey.\r\n\r\nGoing northward over the Portage la Prairie, Verendrye's sons had\r\ndiscovered what is now known as Lake Manitoba, and had reached the\r\nSaskatchewan River. On the west side of Lake Manitoba they founded\r\nFort Dauphin, while at the west end of the enlargement of the\r\nSaskatchewan known as Cedar Lake, they built Fort Bourbon and ascended\r\nthe Saskatchewan to the forks, which were known as the Poskoiac. Tardy\r\nrecognition of Verendrye's achievements came from the French Court in\r\nthe explorer being promoted to the position of captain in the Colonial\r\ntroops, and a short time after he was given the Cross of the Order of\r\nSt. Louis. Beauharnois and his successor Galissionière had both stood\r\nby Verendrye and done their best for him. Indeed, the explorer was just\r\nabout to proceed on the great expedition which was to fulfil their hopes\r\nof finding the Western Sea, when, on December 6th, he passed away, his\r\ndream unrealized. He was an unselfish soul, a man of great executive\r\nability, and one who dearly loved his King and country. He stands out in\r\nstriking contrast to the Bigots and Jonquières, who disgraced the name\r\nof France in the New World.\r\n\r\nFrom the hands of these vampires, who had come to suck out the blood of\r\nNew France, Verendrye's sons received no consideration. Their claims\r\nwere coolly passed by, their goods shamelessly seized, and their\r\nwritten and forcible remonstrance made no impression. Legardeur de St.\r\nPierre, more to the mind of the selfish Bigot, was given their place\r\nand property, and in 1751 a small fort was built on the upper waters\r\nof the Saskatchewan, near the Rocky Mountains, near where the town of\r\nCalgary now stands. This was called in honour of the Governor, Fort La\r\nJonquière. A year afterward, St. Pierre, with his little garrison of\r\nfive men, disgusted with the country, deserted Fort La Reine, which, a\r\nfew weeks after, was burned to the ground by the Assiniboines.\r\n\r\nThe fur trade was continued by the French in much the same bounds, so\r\nlong as the country remained in the hands of France.\r\n\r\nWe are fortunate in having an account of these affairs given in De\r\nBougainville's Memoir, two years before the capture of Canada by Wolfe.\r\nThe forts built by Verendrye's successors were included under the \"Post\r\nof the Western Sea\" (La Mer de l'Ouest). Bougainville says, \"The Post of\r\nthe Western Sea is the most advanced toward the north; it is situated\r\namidst many Indian tribes, with whom we trade and who have intercourse\r\nwith the English, toward Hudson Bay. We have there several forts built\r\nof stockades, trusted generally to the care of one or two officers,\r\nseven or eight soldiers, and eighty _engagés Canadiens_. We can push\r\nfurther the discoveries we have made in that country, and communicate\r\neven with California.\"\r\n\r\nThis would have realized the dream of Verendrye of reaching the Western\r\nSea.\r\n\r\n\"The Post of La Mer de l'Ouest includes the forts of St. Pierre, St.\r\nCharles, Bourbon, De la Reine, Dauphin, Poskoiac, and Des Prairies (De\r\nla Jonquière), all of which are built with palisades that can give\r\nprotection only against the Indians.\"\r\n\r\n\"The post of La Mer de l'Ouest merits special attention for two reasons:\r\nthe first, that it is the nearest to the establishments of the English\r\non Hudson Bay, and from which their movements can be watched; the\r\nsecond, that from this post, the discovery of the Western Sea may be\r\naccomplished; but to make this discovery it will be necessary that the\r\ntravellers give up all view of personal interest.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years later, French power in North America came to an end, and a\r\ngeneration afterward, the Western Sea was discovered by British fur\r\ntraders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE SCOTTISH MERCHANTS OF MONTREAL.\r\n\r\n     Unyielding old Cadot--Competition--The enterprising\r\n     Henry--Leads the way--Thomas Curry--The older Finlay--Plundering\r\n     Indians--\"Grand Portage\"--A famous mart--The plucky Frobishers--The\r\n     Sleeping Giant aroused--Fort Cumberland--Churchill River--Indian\r\n     rising--The deadly smallpox--The whites saved.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe capture of Canada by General Wolfe in 1759 completely changed the\r\ncourse of affairs in the Western fur country. Michilimackinac and Sault\r\nSte. Marie had become considerable trading centres under the French\r\n_régime_, but the officers and men had almost entirely been withdrawn\r\nfrom the outposts in the death struggle for the defence of Quebec and\r\nMontreal.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Canada was announced with sorrow by the chief captain of\r\nthe West, Charles de Langlade, on his return after the capitulation of\r\nMontreal. The French Canadians who had taken Indian wives still clung to\r\nthe fur country. These French half-breed settlements at Michilimackinac\r\nand neighbouring posts were of some size, but beyond Lake Superior,\r\nexcept a straggler here and there, nothing French was left behind. The\r\nforts of the western post fell into decay, and were in most cases burnt\r\nby the Indians. Not an army officer, not a priest, not a fur trader,\r\nremained beyond Kaministiquia.\r\n\r\nThe French of Michilimackinac region were for a time unwilling to accept\r\nBritish rule. Old trader, Jean Baptiste Cadot, who had settled with his\r\nIndian wife, Anastasie, at Sault Ste. Marie, and become a man of wide\r\ninfluence, for years refused to yield, and a French Canadian author\r\nsays: \"So the French flag continued to float over the fort of Sault Ste.\r\nMarie long after the _fleur-de-lis_ had quitted for ever the ramparts\r\nof Quebec. Under the shadow of the old colours, so fruitful of tender\r\nmemories, he was able to believe himself still under the protection of\r\nthe mother-country.\" However, Cadot ended by accepting the situation,\r\nand an author tells us that like Cadot, \"were the La Cornes, the\r\nLanglades, the Beaujeus, the Babys, and many others who, after fighting\r\nlike lions against England, were counted a little later among the number\r\nof her most gallant defenders.\" For several years, however, the fur\r\ntrade was not carried on.\r\n\r\nThe change of flag in Canada brought a number of enterprising spirits as\r\nsettlers to Quebec and Montreal. The Highland regiments under Generals\r\nAmherst and Wolfe had seen Montreal and Quebec. A number of the military\r\nbecame settlers. The suppression of the Jacobite rebellion in Scotland\r\nin 1745 had led to the dispersion of many young men of family beyond\r\nthe seas. Some of these drifted to Montreal. Many of the Scottish\r\nsettlements of the United States had remained loyal, so that after the\r\nAmerican Revolution parties of these loyalists came to Montreal. Thus in\r\na way hard to explain satisfactorily, the English-speaking merchants who\r\ncame to Canada were largely Scottish. In a Government report found in\r\nthe Haldimand papers in 1784, it is stated that \"The greater part of the\r\ninhabitants of Montreal (no doubt meaning English-speaking inhabitants)\r\nare Presbyterians of the Church of Scotland.\" It was these Scottish\r\nmerchants of Montreal who revived the fur trade to the interior.\r\n\r\nWashington Irving, speaking of these merchants, says, \"Most of the\r\nclerks were young men of good families from the Highlands of Scotland,\r\ncharacterized by the perseverance, thrift, and fidelity of their\r\ncountry.\" He refers to their feasts \"making the rafters resound with\r\nbursts of loyalty and old Scottish songs.\"\r\n\r\nThe late Archbishop Taché, a French Canadian long known in the\r\nNorth-West, speaking of this period says, \"Companies called English, but\r\ngenerally composed of Scotchmen, were found in Canada to continue to\r\nmake the most of the rich furs of the forests of the North. Necessity\r\nobliged them at first to accept the co-operation of the French\r\nCanadians, who maintained their influence by the share they took in the\r\nworking of these companies.... This circumstance explains how, after\r\nthe Scotch, the French Canadian element is the most important.\"\r\n\r\nThe first among these Scottish merchants to hie away from Montreal to\r\nthe far West was Alexander Henry, whose \"Travels and Adventures in\r\nCanada and the Indian Territories between the years 1760 and 1766\" have\r\nthe charm of narrative of an Irving or a Parkman. He knew nothing of the\r\nfur trade, but he took with him an experienced French Canadian, named\r\nCampion. He appeared at Michilimackinac two years after the conquest\r\nby Wolfe, and in the following year visited Sault Ste. Marie with its\r\nstockaded fort, and formed a friendship with trader Cadot. In the\r\nfollowing year, Henry was a witness of the massacre at Michilimackinac,\r\nso graphically described by Parkman in his \"Conspiracy of Pontiac.\"\r\nHenry's account of his own escape is a thrilling tale.\r\n\r\nIn 1765 Henry obtained from the Commandant at Michilimackinac licence\r\nof the exclusive trade of Lake Superior. He purchased the freight of\r\nfour canoes, which he took at the price of 10,000 good, merchantable\r\nbeavers. With his crew of twelve men, and supplies of fifty bushels\r\nof prepared Indian corn, he reached a band of Indians on the Lake who\r\nwere in poverty, but who took his supplies on trust, and went off to\r\nhunt beaver. In due time the Indians returned, and paid up promptly\r\nand fully the loans made to them. By 1768 he had succeeded in opening\r\nup the desired route of French traders, going from Michilimackinac to\r\nKaministiquia on Lake Superior and returning. His later journeys we may\r\nnotice afterwards.\r\n\r\nOf the other merchants who followed Henry in reviving the old route,\r\nthe first to make a notable adventure was the Scotchman Thomas Curry.\r\nProcuring the requisite band of voyageurs and interpreters, in 1766\r\nhe pushed through with four canoes, along Verendrye's route, even to\r\nthe site of the old French Fort Bourbon, on the west of Cedar Lake, on\r\nthe lower Saskatchewan River. Curry had in his movement something of\r\nthe spirit of Verendrye, and his season's trip was so successful that,\r\naccording to Sir Alexander Mackenzie, his fine furs gave so handsome\r\na return that \"he was satisfied never again to return to the Indian\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUNCTION OF THE OTTAWA AND ST. LAWRENCE (near Cedars).]\r\n\r\nAnother valorous Scotchman, James Finlay, of Montreal, took up the\r\npaddle that Curry had laid down, and in 1768, with a force equal to that\r\nof Curry, passed into the interior and ascended the Saskatchewan to\r\nNipawi, the farthest point which Verendrye had reached. He was rewarded\r\nwith a generous return for his venture.\r\n\r\nBut while these journeys had been successful, it would seem that\r\nthe turbulent state of the Indian tribes had made other expeditions\r\ndisastrous. In a memorial sent by the fur traders a few years later\r\nto the Canadian Government, it is stated that in a venture made from\r\nMichilimackinac in 1765 the Indians of Rainy Lake had plundered\r\nthe traders of their goods, that in the next year a similar revolt\r\nfollowed, that in the following year the traders were compelled to\r\nleave a certain portion of their goods at Rainy Lake to be allowed to\r\ngo on to Lake Ouinipique. It is stated that the brothers, Benjamin and\r\nJames Frobisher, of Montreal, who became so celebrated as fur traders,\r\nbegan a post ten years after the conquest. These two merchants were\r\nEnglishmen. They speedily took the lead in pushing forward far into\r\nthe interior, and were the most practical of the fur traders in making\r\nalliances and in dealing successfully with the Indians. In their first\r\nexpedition they had the same experience in their goods being seized by\r\nthe thievish Indians of Rainy Lake; but before they could send back\r\nword the goods for the next venture had reached Grand Portage on Lake\r\nSuperior, and they were compelled to try the route to the West again.\r\nOn this occasion they managed to defy the pillaging bands, and reached\r\nFort Bourbon on the Saskatchewan. They now discovered that co-operation\r\nand a considerable show of force was the only method of carrying on a\r\nsafe trade among the various tribes. It was fortunate for the Montreal\r\ntraders that such courageous leaders as the Frobishers had undertaken\r\nthe trade.\r\n\r\nThe trade to the North-West thus received a marvellous development at\r\nthe hands of the Montreal merchants. Nepigon and the Kaministiquia,\r\nwhich had been such important points in the French _régime_, had been\r\nquite forgotten, and Grand Portage was now the place of greatest\r\ninterest, and so continued to the end of the century.\r\n\r\nIt is with peculiar interest a visitor to-day makes his way to\r\nGrand Portage. The writer, after a difficult night voyage over the\r\nstormy waters of Lake Superior, rowed by the keeper of a neighbouring\r\nlighthouse, made a visit a few years ago to this spot. Grand Portage\r\nends on a bay of Lake Superior. It is partially sheltered by a rocky\r\nisland which has the appearance of a robber's keep, but has one\r\ninhabitant, the only white man of the region, a French Canadian of very\r\nfair means. On the bay is to-day an Indian village, chiefly celebrated\r\nfor its multitude of dogs. A few traces of the former greatness of\r\nthe place may be seen in the timbers down in the water of the former\r\nwharves, which were extensive. Few traces of forts are now, a century\r\nafter their desertion by the fur traders, to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe portage, consisting of a road fairly made for the nine or ten miles\r\nnecessary to avoid the falls on Pigeon River, can still be followed. No\r\nhorse or ox is now to be found in the whole district, where at one time\r\nthe traders used this means of lightening the burden of packing over the\r\nportage. The solitary road, as the traveller walks along it, with weeds\r\nand grasses grown up, brings to one a melancholy feeling. The bustle of\r\nvoyageur and trader and Indian is no more; and the reflection made by\r\nIrving comes back, \"The lords of the lakes and forests have passed away.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet Grand Portage was at the time of which we are writing a place\r\nof vast importance. Here there were employed as early as 1783, by the\r\nseveral merchants from Montreal, 500 men. One half of these came from\r\nMontreal to Grand Portage in canoes of four tons burden, each managed\r\nby from eight to ten men. As these were regarded as having the least\r\nromantic portion of the route, meeting with no Indians, and living\r\non cured rations, they were called the \"mangeurs de lard,\" or pork\r\neaters. The other half of the force journeyed inland from Grand Portage\r\nin canoes, each carrying about a ton and a half. Living on game and\r\nthe dried meat of the buffalo, known as pemmican, these were a more\r\nindependent and daring body. They were called the \"coureurs de bois.\"\r\n\r\nFor fifteen days after August 15th these wood-runners portaged over\r\nthe nine or ten miles their burdens. Men carrying 150 lbs. each way\r\nhave been known to make the portage and return in six hours. When the\r\ncanoes were loaded at the west end of the portage with two-thirds\r\ngoods and one-third provisions, then the hurry of the season came, and\r\nsupplies for Lake Winnipeg, the Saskatchewan, and far distant Athabasca\r\nwere hastened on apace. The difficulties of the route were at many a\r\ndécharge, where only the goods needed to be removed and the canoes\r\ntaken over the rapids, or at the portage, where both canoes and load\r\nwere carried past dangerous falls and fierce rapids. The dash, energy,\r\nand skill that characterized these mixed companies of Scottish traders,\r\nFrench voyageurs, half-breed and Indian _engagés_, have been well\r\nspoken of by all observers, and appeal strongly to the lovers of the\r\npicturesque and heroic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF ROUTE OF SCOTTISH MERCHANTS UP THE OTTAWA TO LAKE\r\nATHABASCA.]\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century after the conquest we have a note of alarm at the\r\nnew competition that the Company from Hudson Bay had at last undertaken.\r\nIn the Memorial before us it is stated that disturbance of trade is\r\nmade by \"New Adventurers.\" It is with a smile we read of the daring and\r\nstrong-handed traders of Montreal saying, \"Those adventurers (evidently\r\nH. B. Co.), consulting their own interests only, without the least\r\nregard to the management of the natives or the general welfare of the\r\ntrade, soon occasioned such disorders, &c.... Since that time business\r\nis carried on with great disadvantages.\"\r\n\r\nThis reference, so prosaically introduced, is really one of enormous\r\nmoment in our story. The Frobishers, with their keen business instincts\r\nand daring plans, saw that the real stroke which would lead them on\r\nto fortune was to divert the stream of trade then going to Hudson Bay\r\nsouthward to Lake Superior. Accordingly, with a further aggressive\r\nmovement in view, Joseph Frobisher established a post on Sturgeon Lake,\r\nan enlargement of the Saskatchewan, near the point known by the early\r\nFrench as Poskoiac.\r\n\r\nA glance at the map will show how well chosen Sturgeon Lake Fort was.\r\nNorthward from it a watercourse could be readily followed, by which the\r\nmain line of water communication from the great northern districts to\r\nHudson Bay could be reached and the Northern Indians be interrupted in\r\ntheir annual pilgrimage to the Bay. But, as we shall afterward see, the\r\nsleeping giant of the Bay had been awakened and was about to stretch\r\nforth his arms to grasp the trade of the interior with a new vigour.\r\nTwo years after Frobisher had thrown down the pledge of battle, it was\r\ntaken up by the arrival of Samuel Hearne, an officer of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany, and by his founding Fort Cumberland on Sturgeon Lake, about two\r\nmiles below Frobisher's Fort. Hearne returned to the Bay, leaving his\r\nnew fort garrisoned by a number of Orkney men under an English officer.\r\n\r\nDuring the same year an explorer, on behalf of the Hudson's Bay Company,\r\nvisited Red River, but no fort was built there for some time afterward.\r\nThe building of Fort Cumberland led to a consolidation on the part of\r\nthe Montreal merchants. In the next year after its building, Alexander\r\nHenry, the brothers Frobisher, trader Cadot, and a daring trader named\r\nPond, gathered at Sturgeon Lake, and laid their plans for striking a\r\nblow in retaliation, as they regarded it, for the disturbance of trade\r\nmade by the Hudson's Bay Company in penetrating to the interior from the\r\nBay.\r\n\r\nCadot, with four canoes, went west to the Saskatchewan; Pond, with two,\r\nto the country on Lake Dauphin; and Henry and the Frobisher brothers,\r\nwith their ten canoes and upwards of forty men, hastened northward to\r\ncarry out the project of turning anew the Northern Indians from their\r\nusual visit to the Bay. On the way to the Churchill River they built a\r\nfort on Beaver Lake. In the following year, a strong party went north to\r\nChurchill or English River, as Joseph Frobisher now called it. When it\r\nwas reached they turned westward and ascended the Churchill, returning\r\nat Serpent's Rapid, but sending Thomas Frobisher with goods on to Lake\r\nAthabasca.\r\n\r\nFrom the energy displayed, and the skill shown in seizing the main\r\npoints in the country, it will be seen that the Montreal merchants were\r\nnot lacking in ability to plan and decision to execute. The two great\r\nforces have now met, and for fifty years a battle royal will be fought\r\nfor the rivers, rocks, and plains of the North Country. At present it is\r\nour duty to follow somewhat further the merchants of Montreal in their\r\nagencies in the North-West.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the competition between the two companies\r\nproduced disorder and confusion among the Indian tribes. The Indian\r\nnature is excitable and suspicious. Rival traders for their own ends\r\nplayed upon the fears and cupidity alike of the simple children of the\r\nwoods and prairies. They represented their opponents in both cases as\r\nunreliable and grasping, and party spirit unknown before showed itself\r\nin most violent forms. The feeling against the whites of both parties\r\nwas aroused by injustices, in some cases fancied, in others real. The\r\nAssiniboines, really the northern branch of the fierce Sioux of the\r\nprairies, were first to seize the tomahawk. They attacked Poplar Fort on\r\nthe Assiniboine. After some loss of life, Bruce and Boyer, who were in\r\ncharge of the fort, decided to desert it. Numerous other attacks were\r\nmade on the traders' forts, and it looked as if the prairies would be\r\nthe scene of a general Indian war.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that seems to have prevented so dire a disaster was the\r\nappearance of what is ever a dreadful enemy to the poor Indian, the\r\nscourge of smallpox. The Assiniboines had gone on a war expedition\r\nagainst the Mandans of the Missouri River, and had carried back the\r\nsmallpox infection which prevailed among the Mandan lodges. This\r\ndisease spread over the whole country, and several bands of Indians\r\nwere completely blotted out. Of one tribe of four hundred lodges, only\r\nten persons remained; the poor survivors, in seeking succour from other\r\nbands, carried the disease with them. At the end of 1782 there were\r\nonly twelve traders who had persevered in their trade on account of\r\nthe discouragements, but the whole trade was for two or three seasons\r\nbrought to an end by this disease.\r\n\r\nThe decimation of the tribes, the fear of infection by the traders, and\r\nthe general awe cast over the country turned the thoughts of the natives\r\naway from war, and as Masson says, \"the whites had thus escaped the\r\ndanger which threatened them.\"\r\n\r\nTwo or three years after the scourge, the merchants of Montreal revived\r\nthe trade, and, as we shall see, made a combination which, in the\r\nthoroughness of its discipline, the energy of its operations, the\r\ncourage of its promoters, and the scope of its trade, has perhaps never\r\nbeen equalled in the history of trading companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE COPPERMINE.\r\n\r\n     Samuel Hearne--\"The Mungo Park of Canada\"--Perouse\r\n     complains--The North-West Passage--Indian guides--Two\r\n     failures--Third journey successful--Smokes the calumet--Discovers\r\n     Arctic Ocean--Cruelty to the Eskimos--Error in latitude--Remarkable\r\n     Indian woman--Capture of Prince of Wales Fort--Criticism by\r\n     Umfreville.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch an agitation as that so skilfully planned and shrewdly carried on\r\nby Arthur Dobbs, Esq., could not but affect the action of the Hudson's\r\nBay Company. The most serious charge brought against the Company was\r\nthat, while having a monopoly of the trade on Hudson Bay, it had taken\r\nno steps to penetrate the country and develop its resources. It is of\r\ncourse evident that the Company itself could have no reason for refusing\r\nto open up trade with the interior, for by this means it would be\r\nexpanding its operations and increasing its profits. The real reason\r\nfor its not doing so seems to have been the inertia, not to say fear,\r\nof Hudson's Bay Company agents on the Bay who failed to mingle with the\r\nbands of Indians in the interior.\r\n\r\nNow the man was found who was to be equal to the occasion. This was\r\nSamuel Hearne. Except occasional reference to him in the minutes of\r\nthe Company and works of the period, we know little of Samuel Hearne.\r\nHe was one of the class of men to which belonged Norton, Kelsey, and\r\nothers--men who had grown up in the service of the Company on the Bay,\r\nand had become, in the course of years, accustomed to the climate,\r\ncondition of life, and haunts of the Indians, thus being fitted for\r\nactive work for the Company.\r\n\r\nSamuel Hearne became so celebrated in his inland expeditions, that\r\nthe credit of the Hudson's Bay Company leaving the coast and venturing\r\ninto the interior has always been attached to his name. So greatly,\r\nespecially in the English mind, have his explorations bulked, that\r\nthe author of a book of travels in Canada about the beginning of this\r\ncentury called him the \"Mungo Park of Canada.\" In his \"Journey,\" we\r\nhave an account of his earlier voyages to the interior in search of the\r\nCoppermine River. This book has a somewhat notable history.\r\n\r\nIn the four-volume work of La Perouse, the French navigator, it is\r\nstated that when he took Prince of Wales Fort on the Churchill River in\r\n1782, Hearne, as governor of the fort, surrendered it to him, and that\r\nthe manuscript of his \"Journey\" was seized by the French commander. It\r\nwas returned to Hearne on condition that it should be published, but the\r\npublication did not take place until thirteen years afterwards. It is\r\nsomewhat amusing to read in Perouse's preface (1791) the complaint that\r\nHearne had not kept faith with him in regard to publishing the journal,\r\nand the hope is expressed that this public statement in reminding him of\r\nhis promise would have the desired effect of the journal being published.\r\n\r\nFour years afterwards Hearne's \"Journey\" appeared. A reference to this\r\nfine quarto work, which is well illustrated, brings us back in the\r\nintroduction to all the controversies embodied in the work of Dobbs,\r\nEllis, Robson, and the \"American Traveller.\"\r\n\r\nHearne's orders were received from the Hudson's Bay Company, in 1769, to\r\ngo on a land expedition to the interior of the continent, from the mouth\r\nof the Churchill as far as 70 deg. N. lat., to smoke the calumet of\r\npeace with the Indians, to take accurate astronomical observations, to\r\ngo with guides to the Athabasca country, and thence northward to a river\r\nabounding with copper ore and \"animals of the fur kind,\" &c.\r\n\r\nIt is very noticeable, also, that his instructions distinctly tell him\r\n\"to clear up the point, if possible, in order to prevent further doubt\r\nfrom arising hereafter respecting a passage out of Hudson Bay into\r\nthe Western Ocean, as hath lately been represented by the 'American\r\nTraveller.'\" The instructions made it plain that it was the agitation\r\nstill continuing from the days of Dobbs which led to the sending of\r\nHearne to the north country.\r\n\r\nHearne's first expedition was made during the last months of the year\r\n1769. It is peculiarly instructive in the fact that it failed to\r\naccomplish anything, as it gives us a glimpse of the difficulties which\r\nno doubt so long prevented the movement to the interior. In the first\r\nplace, the bitterly severe months of November and December were badly\r\nchosen for the time of the expedition. On the sixth day of the former\r\nof these months Hearne left Prince of Wales Fort, taking leave of the\r\nGovernor, and being sent off with a salute of seven guns. His guide was\r\nan Indian chief, Chawchinahaw. Hearne ascertained very soon, what others\r\nhave found among the Indians, that his guide was not to be trusted; he\r\n\"often painted the difficulties in the worst colours\" and took every\r\nmethod to dishearten the explorer. Three weeks after starting, a number\r\nof the Indians deserted Hearne.\r\n\r\nShortly after this mishap, Chawchinahaw and his company ruthlessly\r\ndeserted the expedition, and two hundred miles from the fort set out\r\non another route, \"making the woods ring with their laughter.\" Meeting\r\nother Indians, Hearne purchased venison, but was cheated, while his\r\nIndian guide was feasted. The explorer remarks:--\"A sufficient proof\r\nof the singular advantage which a native of this country has over an\r\nEnglishman, when at such a distance from the Company's factories as to\r\ndepend entirely on them for subsistence.\"\r\n\r\nHearne arrived at the fort after an absence of thirty-seven days, as\r\nhe says, \"to my own mortification and the no small surprise of the\r\nGovernor.\" Hearne was simply illustrating what has been shown a hundred\r\ntimes since, in all foreign regions, viz., native peoples are quick to\r\nsee the inexperience of men raw to the country, and will heartlessly\r\nmaltreat and deceive them. However, British officers and men in all\r\nparts of the world become at length accustomed to dealing with savage\r\npeoples, and after some experience, none have ever equalled British\r\nagents and explorers in the management and direction of such peoples.\r\n\r\nEarly in the following year Hearne plucked up courage for another\r\nexpedition. On this occasion he determined to take no Europeans, but to\r\ntrust to Indians alone. On February 23rd, accompanied by five Indians,\r\nHearne started on his second journey. Following the advice of the\r\nGovernor, the party took no Indian women with them, though Hearne states\r\nthat this was a mistake, as they were \"needed for hauling the baggage\r\nas well as for dressing skins for clothing, pitching our tent, getting\r\nfiring, &c.\" During the first part of the journey deer were plentiful,\r\nand the fish obtained by cutting holes in the ice of the lakes were\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\nHearne spent the time of the necessary delays caused by the obtaining\r\nof fish and game in taking observations, keeping his journal and\r\nchart, and doing his share of trapping. Meeting, as soon as the spring\r\nopened, bands of Indians going on various errands, the explorer started\r\noverland. He carried sixty pounds of burden, consisting of quadrant,\r\nbooks and papers, compass, wearing apparel, weapons and presents for the\r\nnatives. The traveller often made twenty miles a day over the rugged\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nMeeting a chief of the Northern Indians going in July to Prince of Wales\r\nFort, Hearne sent by him for ammunition and supplies. A canoe being now\r\nnecessary, Hearne purchased this of the Indians. It was obtained by the\r\nexchange of a single knife, the full value of which did not exceed a\r\npenny. In the middle of this month the party saw bands of musk oxen.\r\nA number of these were killed and their flesh made into pemmican for\r\nfuture use. Finding it impossible to reach the Coppermine during the\r\nseason, Hearne determined to live with the Indians for the winter.\r\n\r\nThe explorer was a good deal disturbed by having to give presents to\r\nIndians who met him. Some of them wanted guns, all wanted ammunition,\r\niron-work, and tobacco; many were solicitous for medicine; and others\r\npressed for different articles of clothing. He thought the Indians very\r\ninconsiderate in their demands.\r\n\r\nOn August 11th the explorer had the misfortune to lose his quadrant\r\nby its being blown open and broken by the wind. Shortly after this\r\ndisaster, Hearne was plundered by a number of Indians who joined him.\r\n\r\nHe determined to return to the fort. Suffering from the want of food\r\nand clothing, Hearne was overtaken by a famous chief, Matonabbee, who\r\nwas going eastward to Prince of Wales Fort. The chief had lived several\r\nyears at the fort, and was one who knew the Coppermine. Matonabbee\r\ndiscussed the reasons of Hearne's failure in his two expeditions. The\r\nforest philosopher gave as the reason of these failures the misconduct\r\nof the guides and the failure to take any women on the journey. After\r\nmaintaining that women were made for labour, and speaking of their\r\nassistance, said Matonabbee, \"women, though they do everything, are\r\nmaintained at a trifling expense, for as they always stand cook, the\r\nvery licking of their fingers in scarce times is sufficient for their\r\nsubsistence.\" Plainly, the northern chief had need of the ameliorating\r\ninfluence of modern reformers. In company with the chief, Hearne\r\nreturned to the fort, reaching it after an absence of eight months and\r\ntwenty-two days, having, as he says, had \"a fruitless or at least an\r\nunsuccessful journey.\"\r\n\r\nHearne, though beaten twice, was determined to try a third time and win.\r\nHe recommended the employment of Matonabbee as a guide of intelligence\r\nand experience. Governor Norton wished to send some of the coast Indians\r\nwith Hearne, but the latter refused them, and incurred the ill-will\r\nof the Governor. Hearne's instructions on this third journey were \"in\r\nquest of a North-West Passage, copper-mines, or any other thing that may\r\nbe serviceable to the British nation in general, or the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany in particular.\" The explorer was now furnished with an Elton's\r\nquadrant.\r\n\r\nThis third journey was begun on December 7th, 1770. Travelling sometimes\r\nfor three or four days without food, they were annoyed, when supplies\r\nwere secured, by the chief Matonabbee taking so ill from over-eating\r\nthat he had to be drawn upon a sledge. Without more than the usual\r\nincidents of Indian travelling, the party pushed on till a point some\r\n19 deg. west of Churchill was reached, according to the calculations of\r\nthe explorer. It is to be noted, however, that Hearne's observations,\r\nmeasurements, and maps, do not seem to be at all accurate.\r\n\r\nTurning northward, as far as can be now made out, about the spot where\r\nthe North-West traders first appeared on their way to the Churchill\r\nRiver, Hearne went north to his destination. His Indian guides now\r\nformed a large war party from the resident Indians, to meet the Eskimos\r\nof the river to which they were going and to conquer them.\r\n\r\nThe explorer announces that having left behind \"all the women, children,\r\ndogs, heavy baggage, and other encumbrances,\" on June 1st, 1771, they\r\npursued their journey northward with great speed. On June 21st the sun\r\ndid not set at all, which Hearne took to be proof that they had reached\r\nthe Arctic Circle. Next day they met the Copper Indians, who welcomed\r\nthem on hearing the object of their visit.\r\n\r\nHearne, according to orders, smoked the calumet of peace with the Copper\r\nIndians. These Indians had never before seen a white man. Hearne was\r\nconsidered a great curiosity. Pushing on upon their long journey, the\r\nexplorers reached the Coppermine River on July 13th. Hearne was the\r\nwitness of a cruel massacre of the Eskimos by his Indian allies, and the\r\nseizure of their copper utensils and other provisions, and expresses\r\ndisgust at the enormity of the affair. The mouth of the river, which\r\nflows into the Arctic Ocean, was soon reached on July 18th, and the tide\r\nfound to rise about fourteen feet.\r\n\r\nHearne seems in the narrative rather uncertain about the latitude of the\r\nmouth of the Coppermine River, but states that after some consultation\r\nwith the Indians, he erected a mark, and took possession of the coast on\r\nbehalf of the Hudson's Bay Company.\r\n\r\nIn Hearne's map, dated July, 1771, and purporting to be a plan of the\r\nCoppermine, the mouth of the river is about 71 deg. 54´ N. This was a\r\ngreat mistake, as the mouth of the river is somewhere near 68 deg. N.\r\nSo great a mistake was certainly unpardonable. Hearne's apology was\r\nthat after the breaking of his quadrant on the second expedition, the\r\ninstrument which he used was an old Elton's quadrant, which had been\r\nknocking about the Prince of Wales Fort for nearly thirty years.\r\n\r\nHaving examined the resources of the river and heard of the mines from\r\nwhich the Copper Indians obtained all the metal for the manufacture of\r\nhatchets, chisels, knives, &c., Hearne started southward on his return\r\njourney on July 18th. Instead of coming by the direct route, he went\r\nwith the Indians of his party to the north side of Lake Athabasca on\r\nDecember 24th. Having crossed the lake, as illustrating the loneliness\r\nof the region, the party found a woman who had escaped from an Indian\r\nband which had taken her prisoner, and who had not seen a human face\r\nfor seven months, and had lived by snaring partridges, rabbits, and\r\nsquirrels. Her skill in maintaining herself in lonely wilds was truly\r\nwonderful. She became the wife of one of the Indians of Hearne's party.\r\nIn the middle of March, 1772, Hearne was delivered a letter, brought to\r\nhim from Prince of Wales Fort and dated in the preceding June. Pushing\r\neastward, after a number of adventures, Hearne reached Prince of Wales\r\nFort on June 30th, 1772, having been absent on his third voyage eighteen\r\nmonths and twenty-three days. Hearne rejoices that he had at length put\r\nan end to the disputes concerning a North-West Passage through Hudson\r\nBay. The fact, however, that during the nineteenth century this became\r\nagain a living question shows that in this he was mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe perseverance and pluck of Hearne have impressed all those who have\r\nread his narrative. He was plainly one of the men possessing the subtle\r\npower of impressing the Indian mind. His disasters would have deterred\r\nmany men from following up so difficult and extensive a route. To him\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company owes a debt of gratitude. That debt consists\r\nnot in the discovery of the Coppermine, but in the attitude presented to\r\nthe Northern Indians from the Bay all the way to Lake Athabasca. Hearne\r\ndoes not mention the Montreal fur traders, who, in the very year of his\r\nreturn, reached the Saskatchewan and were stationed at the Churchill\r\nRiver down which he passed.\r\n\r\nFirst of white men to reach Athapuscow, now thought to have been Great\r\nSlave Lake, Samuel Hearne claimed for his Company priority of trade,\r\nand answered the calumnies that his Company was lacking in energy\r\nand enterprise. He took what may be called \"seizen\" of the soil for\r\nthe English traders. We shall speak again of his part in leading the\r\nmovement inland to oppose the Nor'-Westers in the interior. His services\r\nto the Hudson's Bay Company received recognition in his promotion,\r\nthree years after his return home from his third voyage, to the\r\ngovernorship of the Prince of Wales Fort. To Hearne has been largely\r\ngiven the credit of the new and adventurous policy of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nHearne does not, however, disappear from public notice on his promotion\r\nto the command of Prince of Wales Fort. When war broke out a few years\r\nlater between England and France, the latter country, remembering her\r\nold successes under D'Iberville on Hudson Bay, sent a naval expedition\r\nto attack the forts on the Bay. Umfreville gives an account of the\r\nattack on Prince of Wales Fort on August 8th and 9th, 1772. Admiral\r\nde la Perouse was in command of these war vessels, his flagship being\r\n_Le Sceptre_, of seventy-four guns. The garrison was thought to be\r\nwell provided for a siege, and La Perouse evidently expected to have a\r\nsevere contest. However, as he approached the fort, there seemed to be\r\nno preparations made for defence, and, on the summons to surrender, the\r\ngates were immediately thrown open.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCE OF WALES FORT.]\r\n\r\nUmfreville, who was in the garrison and was taken prisoner on this\r\noccasion, speaks of the conduct of the Governor as being very\r\nreprehensible, but severely criticizes the Company for its neglect. He\r\nsays:--\"The strength of the fort itself was such as would have resisted\r\nthe attack of a more considerable force; it was built of the strongest\r\nmaterials, the walls were of great thickness and very durable (it was\r\nplanned by the ingenious Mr. Robson, who went out in 1742 for that\r\npurpose), it having been forty years in building and attended with\r\ngreat expense to the Company. In short, it was the opinion of every\r\nintelligent person that it might have made an obstinate resistance when\r\nattacked, had it been as well provided in other respects; but through\r\nthe impolitic conduct of the Company, every courageous exertion of their\r\nservants must have been considered as imprudent temerity; for this\r\nplace, which would have required four hundred men for its defence, the\r\nCompany, in its consummate wisdom, had garrisoned with only thirty-nine.\"\r\n\r\nIn this matter, Umfreville very plainly shows his animus to the Company,\r\nbut incidentally he exonerates Hearne from the charge of cowardice,\r\ninasmuch as it would have been madness to make defence against so large\r\na body of men. As has been before pointed out, we can hardly charge\r\nwith cowardice the man who had shown his courage and determination in\r\nthe three toilsome and dangerous journeys spoken of; rather would we\r\nsee in this a proof of his wisdom under unfortunate circumstances. The\r\nsurrender of York Factory to La Perouse twelve days afterwards, without\r\nresistance, was an event of an equally discouraging kind. The Company\r\nsuffered great loss by the surrender of these forts, which had been\r\nunmolested since the Treaty of Utrecht.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nFORTS ON HUDSON BAY LEFT BEHIND.\r\n\r\n     Andrew Graham's \"Memo.\"--Prince of Wales Fort--The\r\n     garrison--Trade--York Factory--Furs--Albany--Subordinate\r\n     forts--Moose--Moses Norton--Cumberland House--Upper\r\n     Assiniboine--Rainy Lake--Brandon House--Red River--Conflict of the\r\n     Companies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new policy of the Company that for a hundred years had carried on\r\nits operations in Hudson Bay was now to be adopted. As soon as the plan\r\ncould be developed, a long line of posts in the interior would serve\r\nto carry on the chief trade, and the forts and factories on Hudson Bay\r\nwould become depôts for storage and ports of departure for the Old World.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting at this point to have a view of the last days of\r\nthe old system which had grown up during the operations of a century.\r\nWe are fortunate in having an account of these forts in 1771 given by\r\nAndrew Graham, for many years a factor of the Hudson's Bay Company. This\r\ndocument is to be found in the Hudson's Bay Company house in London,\r\nand has been hitherto unpublished. The simplicity of description and\r\ncurtness of detail gives the account its chief charm.\r\n\r\nPRINCE OF WALES FORT.--On a peninsula at the entrance of the Churchill\r\nRiver. Most northern settlement of the Company. A stone fort, mounting\r\nforty-two cannon, from six to twenty-four pounders. Opposite, on the\r\nsouth side of the river, Cape Merry Battery, mounting six twenty-four\r\npounders with lodge-house and powder magazine. The river 1,006 yards\r\nwide. A ship can anchor six miles above the fort. Tides carry salt\r\nwater twelve miles up the river. No springs near; drink snow water nine\r\nmonths of the year. In summer keep three draught horses to haul water\r\nand draw stones to finish building of forts.\r\n\r\nStaff:--A chief factor and officers, with sixty servants and tradesmen.\r\nThe council, with discretionary power, consists of chief factor, second\r\nfactor, surgeon, sloop and brig masters, and captain of Company's ship\r\nwhen in port. These answer and sign the general letter, sent yearly\r\nto directors. The others are accountant, trader, steward, armourer,\r\nship-wright, carpenter, cooper, blacksmith, mason, tailor, and\r\nlabourers. These must not trade with natives, under penalties for so\r\ndoing. Council mess together, also servants. Called by bell to duty,\r\nwork from six to six in summer; eight to four in winter. Two watch\r\nin winter, three in summer. In emergencies, tradesmen must work at\r\nanything. Killing of partridges the most pleasant duty.\r\n\r\nCompany signs contract with servants for three or five years, with the\r\nremarkable clause: \"Company may recall them home at any time without\r\nsatisfaction for the remaining time. Contract may be renewed, if\r\nservants or labourers wish, at expiry of term. Salary advanced forty\r\nshillings, if men have behaved well in first term. The land and sea\r\nofficers' and tradesmen's salaries do not vary, but seamen's are raised\r\nin time of war.\"\r\n\r\nA ship of 200 tons burden, bearing provisions, arrives yearly in August\r\nor early September. Sails again in ten days, wind permitting, with cargo\r\nand those returning. Sailors alone get pay when at home.\r\n\r\nThe annual trade sent home from this fort is from ten to four thousand\r\nmade beaver, in furs, felts, castorum, goose feathers, and quills, and\r\na small quantity of train oil and whalebone, part of which they receive\r\nfrom the Eskimos, and the rest from the white whale fishery. A black\r\nwhale fishery is in hand, but it shows no progress.\r\n\r\nYORK FACTORY.--On the north bank of Hayes River, three miles from the\r\nentrance. Famous River Nelson, three miles north, makes the land between\r\nan island. Well-built fort of wood, log on log. Four bastions with\r\nsheds between, and a breastwork with twelve small carriage guns. Good\r\nclass of quarters, with double row of strong palisades. On the bank's\r\nedge, before the fort, is a half-moon battery, of turf and earth, with\r\nfifteen cannon, nine-pounders. Two miles below the fort, same side, is\r\na battery of ten twelve-pounders, with lodge-house and powder magazine.\r\nThese two batteries command the river, but the shoals and sand-banks\r\nacross the mouth defend us more. No ship comes higher than five miles\r\nbelow the fort.\r\n\r\nGoverned like Prince of Wales Fort. Complement of men: forty-two. The\r\nnatives come down Nelson River to trade. If weather calm, they paddle\r\nround the point. If not, they carry their furs across. This fort sends\r\nhome from 7,000 to 33,000 made beaver in furs, &c., and a small quantity\r\nof white whale oil.\r\n\r\nSEVERN FORT.--On the north bank of Severn River. Well-built square\r\nhouse, with four bastions. Men: eighteen. Commanded by a factor and\r\nsloop master. Eight small cannon and other warlike stores. Sloop carries\r\nfurs in the fall to York Factory and delivers them to the ship, with\r\nthe books and papers, receiving supply of trading goods, provisions,\r\nand stores. Severn full of shoals and sand banks. Sloop has difficulty\r\nin getting in and out. Has to wait spring tides inside the point. Trade\r\nsent home, 5,000 to 6,600 made beaver in furs, &c.\r\n\r\nALBANY FORT.--On south bank of Albany River, four miles from the\r\nentrance. Large well-built wood fort. Four bastions with shed between.\r\nCannon and warlike stores. Men: thirty; factor and officers. River\r\ndifficult. Ship rides five leagues out and is loaded and unloaded by\r\nlarge sloop. Trade, including two sub-houses of East Main and Henley,\r\nfrom 10,000 to 12,000 made beaver, &c. (This fort was the first\r\nEuropeans had in Hudson Bay, and is where Hudson traded with natives.)\r\n\r\nHENLEY HOUSE.--One hundred miles up the river from Albany. Eleven men,\r\ngoverned by master. First founded to prevent encroachments of the\r\nFrench, when masters of Canada, and present to check the English.\r\n\r\nEAST MAIN HOUSE.--Entrance of Slude River. Small square house. Sloop\r\nmaster and eleven men. Trade: 1000 to 2000 made beaver in furs, &c.\r\nDepth of water just admits sloop.\r\n\r\nMOOSE FACTORY.--South bank of Moose River, near entrance. Well-built\r\nwood fort--cannon and warlike stores. Twenty-five men. Factor and\r\nofficers. River admits ship to good harbour, below fort. Trade, 3,000 to\r\n4,000 made beavers in furs, &c. One ship supplies this fort, along with\r\nAlbany and sub-forts.\r\n\r\nThese are the present Hudson's Bay Company's settlements in the Bay.\r\n\"All under one discipline, and excepting the sub-houses, each factor\r\nreceives a commission to act for benefit of Company, without being\r\nanswerable to any person or persons in the Bay, more than to consult for\r\ngood of Company in emergencies and to supply one another with trading\r\ngoods, &c., if capable, the receiver giving credit for the same.\"\r\n\r\nThe movement to the interior was begun from the Prince of Wales Fort\r\nup the Churchill River. Next year, after his return from the discovery\r\nof the Coppermine, Samuel Hearne undertook the aggressive work of\r\ngoing to meet the Indians, now threatened from the Saskatchewan by the\r\nseductive influences of the Messrs. Frobisher, of the Montreal fur\r\ntraders. The Governor at Prince of Wales Fort, for a good many years,\r\nhad been Moses Norton. He was really an Indian born at the fort, who\r\nhad received some education during a nine years' residence in England.\r\nOf uncultivated manners, and leading far from a pure life, he was yet\r\na man of considerable force, with a power to command and the ability\r\nto ingratiate himself with the Indians. He was possessed of undoubted\r\nenergy, and no doubt to his advice is very much due the movement to\r\nleave the forts in the Bay and penetrate to the interior of the country.\r\nIn December of the very year (1773) in which Hearne went on his trading\r\nexpedition inland, Norton died.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, as we have seen, Hearne erected Cumberland House,\r\nonly five hundred yards from Frobisher's new post on Sturgeon Lake. It\r\nwas the intention of the Hudson's Bay Company also to make an effort\r\nto control the trade to the south of Lake Winnipeg. Hastily called\r\naway after building Cumberland House, Hearne was compelled to leave\r\na colleague, Mr. Cockings, in charge of the newly-erected fort, and\r\nreturned to the bay to take charge of Prince of Wales Fort, the post\r\nleft vacant by the death of Governor Norton.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson's Bay Company, now regularly embarked in the inland trade,\r\nundertook to push their posts to different parts of the country,\r\nespecially to the portion of the fur country in the direction from which\r\nthe Montreal traders approached it. The English traders, as we learn\r\nfrom Umfreville, who was certainly not prejudiced in their favour,\r\nhad the advantage of a higher reputation in character and trade among\r\nthe Indians than had their Canadian opponents. From their greater\r\nnearness to northern waters, the old Company could reach a point in the\r\nSaskatchewan with their goods nearly a month earlier in the spring than\r\ntheir Montreal rivals were able to do. We find that in 1790 the Hudson's\r\nBay Company crossed south from the northern waters and erected a trading\r\npost at the mouth of the Swan River, near Lake Winnipegoosis. This they\r\nsoon deserted and built a fort on the upper waters of the Assiniboine\r\nRiver, a few miles above the present Hudson's Bay Company post of Fort\r\nPelly.\r\n\r\nA period of surprising energy was now seen in the English Company's\r\naffairs. \"Carrying the war into Africa,\" they in the same year met their\r\nantagonists in the heart of their own territory, by building a trading\r\npost on Rainy Lake and another in the neighbouring Red Lake district,\r\nnow included in North-Eastern Minnesota. Having seized the chief\r\npoints southward, the aroused Company, in the next year (1791), pushed\r\nnorth-westward from Cumberland House and built an establishment at Ile à\r\nla Crosse, well up toward Lake Athabasca.\r\n\r\nCrossing from Lake Winnipeg in early spring to the head waters of the\r\nAssiniboine River, the spring brigade of the Hudson's Bay Company quite\r\noutdid their rivals, and in 1794 built the historic Brandon House, at a\r\nvery important point on the Assiniboine River. This post was for upwards\r\nof twenty years a chief Hudson's Bay Company centre until it was burnt.\r\nOn the grassy bank of the Assiniboine, the writer some years ago found\r\nthe remains of the old fort, and from the well-preserved character of\r\nthe sod, was able to make out the line of the palisades, the exact size\r\nof all the buildings, and thus to obtain the ground plan.\r\n\r\nBrandon House was on the south side of the Assiniboine, about seventeen\r\nmiles below the present city of Brandon. Its remains are situated on\r\nthe homestead of Mr. George Mair, a Canadian settler from Beauharnois,\r\nQuebec, who settled here on July 20th, 1879. The site was well chosen at\r\na bend of the river, having the Assiniboine in front of it on the east\r\nand partially so also on the north. The front of the palisade faced to\r\nthe east, and midway in the wall was a gate ten feet wide, with inside\r\nof it a look-out tower (guérite) seven feet square. On the south side\r\nwas the long store-house. In the centre had stood a building said by\r\nsome to have been the blacksmith's shop. Along the north wall were the\r\nbuildings for residences and other purposes. The remains of other forts,\r\nbelonging to rival companies, are not far away, but of these we shall\r\nspeak again.\r\n\r\nThe same activity continued to exist in the following year, for in\r\npoints so far apart as the Upper Saskatchewan and Lake Winnipeg new\r\nforts were built. The former of these was Edmonton House, built on the\r\nnorth branch of the Saskatchewan. The fort erected on Lake Winnipeg\r\nwas probably that at the mouth of the Winnipeg River, near where Fort\r\nAlexander now stands.\r\n\r\nIn 1796, another post was begun on the Assiniboine River, not unlikely\r\nnear the old site of Fort de la Reine, while in the following year, as\r\na half-way house to Edmonton on the Saskatchewan, Carlton House was\r\nerected. The Red River proper was taken possession of by the Company in\r\n1799. Alexander Henry, junr., tells us that very near the boundary line\r\n(49 degrees N.) on the east side of the Red River, there were in 1800\r\nthe remains of a fort.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of things, so far as the Hudson's Bay Company was\r\nconcerned, at the end of the century.\r\n\r\nIn twenty-five years they had extended their trade from Edmonton House,\r\nnear the Rockies, as far as Rainy Lake; they had made Cumberland House\r\nthe centre of their operations in the interior, and had taken a strong\r\nhold of the fertile region on the Red and Assiniboine Rivers, of which\r\nto-day the city of Winnipeg is the centre.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the severe competition between the Montreal merchants\r\nand the Hudson's Bay Company greatly diminished the profits of both.\r\nAccording to Umfreville, the Hudson's Bay Company business was conducted\r\nmuch more economically than that of the merchants of Montreal. The\r\nCompany upon the Bay chiefly employed men obtained in the Orkney\r\nIslands, who were a steady, plodding, and reliable class. The employés\r\nof the Montreal merchants were a wild, free, reckless people, much\r\naddicted to drink, and consequently less to be depended upon.\r\n\r\nThe same writer states that the competition between the two rival\r\nbodies of traders resulted badly for the Indians. He says: \"So that the\r\nCanadians from Canada and the Europeans from Hudson Bay met together,\r\nnot at all to the ulterior advantage of the natives, who by this\r\nmeans became degenerated and debauched, through the excessive use of\r\nspirituous liquors imported by these rivals in commerce.\"\r\n\r\nOne thing at any rate had been clearly demonstrated, that the inglorious\r\nsleeping by the side of the Bay, charged by Dobbs and others against\r\nthe old Company, had been overcome, and that the first quarter of the\r\nsecond century of the history of the Hudson's Bay Company showed that\r\nthe Company's motto, \"Pro Pelle Cutem,\" \"Skin for Skin,\" had not been\r\ninappropriately chosen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE NORTH-WEST COMPANY FORMED.\r\n\r\n     Hudson's Bay Company aggressive--The great McTavish--The\r\n     Frobishers--Pond and Pangman dissatisfied--Gregory and\r\n     McLeod--Strength of the North-West Company--Vessels to be\r\n     built--New route from Lake Superior sought--Good-will at\r\n     times--Bloody Pond--Wider union, 1787--Fort Alexandria--Mouth of\r\n     the Souris--Enormous fur trade--Wealthy Nor'-Westers--\"The Haunted\r\n     House.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe terrible scourge of smallpox cut off one-half, some say one-third\r\nof the Indian population of the fur country. This was a severe blow to\r\nthe prosperity of the fur trade, as the traders largely depended on\r\nthe Indians as trappers. The determination shown by the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany, and the zeal with which they took advantage of an early access\r\nto the Northern Indians, were a surprise to the Montreal traders, and we\r\nfind in the writings of the time, frequent expressions as to the loss of\r\nprofits produced by the competition in the fur trade.\r\n\r\nThe leading fur merchants of Montreal determined on a combination of\r\ntheir forces. Chief among the stronger houses were the Frobishers.\r\nJoseph Frobisher had returned from his two years' expedition in 1776,\r\n\"having secured what was in those days counted a competent fortune,\" and\r\nwas one of the \"characters\" of the commercial capital of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe strongest factor in the combination was probably Simon McTavish, of\r\nwhom a writer has said \"that he may be regarded as the founder of the\r\nfamous North-West Company.\" McTavish, born in 1750, was a Highlander of\r\nenormous energy and decision of character. While by his force of will\r\nrousing opposition, yet he had excellent business capacity, and it was\r\nhe who suggested the cessation of rivalries and strife among themselves\r\nand the union of their forces by the Canadian traders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAC DES ALLUMETTES.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly the North-West Company was formed 1783-4, its stock being\r\napportioned into sixteen parts, each stockholder supplying in lieu of\r\nmoney a certain proportion of the commodities necessary for trade, and\r\nthe Committee dividing their profits when the returns were made from\r\nthe sale of furs. The united firms of Benjamin and Joseph Frobisher\r\nand Simon McTavish administered the whole affair for the traders and\r\nreceived a commission as agents.\r\n\r\nThe brightest prospect lay before the new formed Company, and they had\r\ntheir first gathering at Grand Portage in the spring of 1784. But union\r\ndid not satisfy all. A viciously-disposed and self-confident trader,\r\nPeter Pond, had not been consulted. Pond was an American, who, as we\r\nhave seen in 1775, accompanied Henry, Cadot, and Frobisher to the far\r\nNorth-West. Two years later he had gone to Lake Athabasca, and forty\r\nmiles from the lake on Deer River, had built in 1778 the first fort in\r\nthe far-distant region, which became known as the Fur Emporium of the\r\nNorth-West. Pond had with much skill prepared a great map of the country\r\nfor presentation to the Empress Catherine of Russia, and at a later\r\nstage gave much information to the American commissioners who settled\r\nthe boundary line under the Treaty of Paris.\r\n\r\nPond was dissatisfied and refused to enter the new Company. Another\r\ntrader, Peter Pangman, an American also, had been overlooked in the\r\nnew Company, and he and Pond now came to Montreal, determined to form\r\na strong opposition to the McTavish and Frobisher combination. In this\r\nthey were successful.\r\n\r\nOne of the rising merchants of Montreal at this time was John Gregory,\r\na young Englishman. He was united in partnership with Alexander Norman\r\nMcLeod, an ardent Highlander, who afterwards rose to great distinction\r\nas a magnate of the fur trade. Pangman and Pond appealed to the\r\nself-interest of Gregory, McLeod & Company, and so, very shortly after\r\nhis projected union of all the Canadian interests, McTavish saw arise a\r\nrival, not so large as his own Company, but in no way to be despised.\r\n\r\nTo this rival Company also belonged an energetic, strong-willed\r\nScotchman, who afterwards became the celebrated Sir Alexander\r\nMackenzie, his cousin Roderick McKenzie--a notable character, a trader\r\nnamed Ross, and also young Finlay, a son of the pioneer so well known\r\ntwenty years before in the fur trading and civil history of Canada. Pond\r\nsignalized himself by soon after deserting to the older Company.\r\n\r\nThe younger Company acted with great vigour. Leaving McLeod behind to\r\nmanage the business in Montreal, the other members found themselves\r\nin the summer at Grand Portage, where they established a post. They\r\nthen divided up the country and gave it to the partners and traders.\r\nAthabasca was given to Ross; Churchill River to Alexander Mackenzie; the\r\nSaskatchewan to Pangman; and the Red River country to the veteran trader\r\nPollock.\r\n\r\nThe North-West Company entered with great energy upon its occupation of\r\nthe North-West country. We are able to refer to an unpublished memorial\r\npresented by them, in 1784, to Governor Haldimand, which shows very well\r\ntheir hopes and expectations. They claim to have explored and improved\r\nthe route from Grand Portage to Lake Ouinipique, and they ask the\r\ngovernor to grant them the exclusive privilege of using this route for\r\nten years.\r\n\r\nThey recite the expeditions made by the Montreal traders from their\r\nposts in 1765 up to the time of their memorial. They urge the granting\r\nof favours to them on the double ground of their having to oppose the\r\n\"new adventurers,\" as they call the Hudson's Bay Company, in the north,\r\nand they claim to desire to oppose the encroachments of the United\r\nStates in the south. They state the value of the property of the Company\r\nin the North-West, exclusive of houses and stores, to be 25,303_l._\r\n3_s._ 6_d._; the other outfits also sent to the country will not fall\r\nfar short of this sum. The Company will have at Grand Portage in the\r\nfollowing July 50,000_l._ (original cost) in fur. They further ask the\r\nprivilege of constructing a small vessel to be built at Detroit and to\r\nbe taken up Sault Ste. Marie to ply on Lake Superior, and also that in\r\ntransporting their supplies on the King's ships from Niagara and Detroit\r\nto Michilimackinac, they may have the precedence on account of the\r\nshortness of their season and great distance interior to be reached.\r\n\r\nThey state that they have arranged to have a spot selected at Sault Ste.\r\nMarie, whither they may have the fort transferred from Michilimackinac,\r\nwhich place had been awarded by the Treaty of Paris to the Americans.\r\nThey desire another vessel placed on the lakes to carry their furs to\r\nDetroit. This indicates a great revival of the fur trade and vigorous\r\nplans for its prosecution.\r\n\r\nA most interesting statement is also made in the memorial: that on\r\naccount of Grand Portage itself having been by the Treaty of Paris left\r\non the American side of the boundary on Lake Superior, they had taken\r\nsteps to find a Canadian route by which the trade could be carried on\r\nfrom Lake Superior to the interior. They state that they had sent off on\r\nan expedition a canoe, with provisions only, navigated by six Canadians,\r\nunder the direction of Mr. Edward Umfreville, who had been eleven years\r\nin the service of the Hudson's Bay Company, and who along with his\r\ncolleague, Mr. Verrance, knew the language of the Indians.\r\n\r\nWe learn from Umfreville's book that \"he succeeded in his expedition\r\nmuch to the satisfaction of the merchants,\" along the route from\r\nLake Nepigon to Winnipeg River. The route discovered proved almost\r\nimpracticable for trade, but as it was many years before the terms of\r\nthe treaty were carried into effect, Grand Portage remained for the time\r\nthe favourite pathway to the interior.\r\n\r\nThe conflict of the two Montreal companies almost obscured that with the\r\nEnglish traders from Hudson Bay. True, in some districts the competition\r\nwas peaceful and honourable. The nephew of Simon McTavish, William\r\nMcGillivray, who afterwards rose to great prominence as a trader, was\r\nstationed with one of the rival company, Roderick McKenzie, of whom we\r\nhave spoken, on the English River. In 1786 they had both succeeded so\r\nwell in trade that, forming their men into two brigades, they returned\r\ntogether, making the woods resound with the lively French songs of the\r\nvoyageurs.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the traders largely depended, however, on the character\r\nof the men. To the Athabasca district the impetuous and intractable\r\nPond was sent by the older Company, on his desertion to it. Here there\r\nwas the powerful influence of the Hudson's Bay Company to contend\r\nagainst, and the old Company from the Bay long maintained its hold on\r\nthe Northern Indians. To make a flank movement upon the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany he sent Cuthbert Grant and a French trader to Slave Lake, on\r\nwhich they established Fort Resolution, while, pushing on still farther,\r\nthey reached a point afterwards known as Fort Providence.\r\n\r\nThe third body to be represented in Athabasca Lake was the small\r\nNorth-West Company by their _bourgeois_, John Ross. Ross was a peaceable\r\nand fair man, but Pond so stirred up strife that the employés of the two\r\nCompanies were in a perpetual quarrel. In one of these conflicts Ross\r\nwas unfortunately killed. This added to the evil reputation of Pond,\r\nwho in 1781 had been charged with the murder of a peaceful trader named\r\nWadin, in the same Athabasca region.\r\n\r\nWhen Roderick McKenzie heard at Ile à la Crosse of the murder, he\r\nhastened to the meeting of the traders at Grand Portage. This alarming\r\nevent so affected the traders that the two Companies agreed to unite.\r\nThe union was effected in 1787, and the business at headquarters in\r\nMontreal was now managed by the three houses of McTavish, Frobisher, and\r\nGregory. Alexander Mackenzie was despatched to Athabasca to take the\r\nplace of the unfortunate trader Ross, and so became acquainted with the\r\nregion which was to be the scene of his triumphs in discovery.\r\n\r\nThe union of the North-West fur companies led to extension in some\r\ndirections. The Assiniboine Valley, in one of the most fertile parts of\r\nthe country, was more fully occupied. As in the case of the Hudson's\r\nBay Company, the occupation of this valley took place by first coming\r\nto Lake Winnipeg and ascending the Swan River (always a fur trader's\r\nparadise), until, by a short portage, the Upper Assiniboine was reached.\r\n\r\nThe oldest fort in this valley belonging to the Nor'-Westers seems to\r\nhave been built by a trader, Robert Grant, a year or two after 1780. It\r\nis declared by trader John McDonnell to have been two short days' march\r\nfrom the junction of the Qu'Appelle and Assiniboine.\r\n\r\nWell up the Assiniboine, and not far from the source of the Swan River,\r\nstood Fort Alexandria, \"surrounded by groves of birch, poplar, and\r\naspen,\" and said to have been named after Sir Alexander Mackenzie. It\r\nwas 256 feet in length by 196 feet in breadth; the \"houses, stores,\r\n&c., being well built, plastered on the inside and outside, and washed\r\nover with a white earth, which answers nearly as well as lime for\r\nwhite-washing.\"\r\n\r\nConnected with this region was the name of a famous trader, Cuthbert\r\nGrant, the father of the leader of the half-breeds and Nor'-Westers,\r\nof whom we shall speak afterwards. At the mouth of Shell River on the\r\nAssiniboine stood a small fort built by Peter Grant in 1794.\r\n\r\nWhen the Nor'-Westers became acquainted with the route down the\r\nAssiniboine, they followed it to its mouth, and from that point, where\r\nit joined the Red River, descended to Lake Winnipeg and crossed to the\r\nWinnipeg River.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this they established in 1785, as a halting place,\r\nPine Fort, about eighteen miles below the junction of the Souris and\r\nAssiniboine Rivers. At the mouth of the Souris River, and near the site\r\nof the Brandon House, already described as built by the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany, the North-West Company built in 1795 Assiniboine House. This\r\nfort became of great importance as the depôt for expeditions to the\r\nMandans of the Missouri River.\r\n\r\nThe union of the Montreal Companies resulted, as had been expected, in\r\na great expansion of the trade. In 1788 the gross amount of the trade\r\ndid not exceed 40,000_l._, but by the energy of the partners it reached\r\nbefore the end of the century more than three times that amount--a\r\nremarkable showing.\r\n\r\nThe route now being fully established, the trade settled down into\r\nregular channels. The agents of the Company in Montreal, Messrs.\r\nMcTavish & Co., found it necessary to order the goods needed from\r\nEngland eighteen months before they could leave Montreal for the West.\r\nArriving in Canada in the summer, they were then made up in packages for\r\nthe Indian trade. These weighed about ninety pounds each, and were ready\r\nto be borne inland in the following spring.\r\n\r\nThen being sent to the West, they were taken to the far points in the\r\nensuing winter, where they were exchanged for furs. The furs reached\r\nMontreal in the next autumn, when they were stored to harden, and\r\nwere not to be sold or paid for before the following season. This was\r\nforty-two months after the goods were ordered in Canada. This trade was\r\na very heavy one to conduct, inasmuch as allowing a merchant one year's\r\ncredit, he had still two years to carry the burden after the value of\r\nthe goods had been considered as cash.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the century a single year's produce was enormous. One\r\nsuch year was represented by 106,000 beavers, 32,000 marten, 11,800\r\nmink, 17,000 musquash, and, counting all together, not less than 184,000\r\nskins.\r\n\r\nThe agents necessary to carry on this enormous volume of trade were\r\nnumerous. Sir Alexander Mackenzie informs us that there were employed\r\nin the concern, not including officers or partners, 50 clerks, 71\r\ninterpreters and clerks, 1,120 canoe-men, and 35 guides.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the operations of this Company may be seen from the\r\nforegoing statements. The capital required by the agents of the concern\r\nin Montreal, the number of men employed, the vast quantities of goods\r\nsent out in bales made up for the western trade, and the enormous store\r\nof furs received in exchange, all combined to make the business of the\r\nNorth-West Company an important factor in Canadian life.\r\n\r\nCanada was then in her infancy. Upper Canada was not constituted a\r\nprovince until the date of the formation of the North-West Company.\r\nMontreal and Quebec, the only places of any importance, were small\r\ntowns. The absence of manufactures, agriculture, and means of\r\ninter-communication or transport, led to the North-West Company being\r\nthe chief source of money-making in Canada. As the fur merchants became\r\nrich from their profits, they bought seigniories, built mansions, and\r\neven in some cases purchased estates in the old land.\r\n\r\nSimon McTavish may be looked upon as a type. After a most active life,\r\nand when he had accumulated a handsome competence, Simon McTavish owned\r\nthe Seigniory of Terrebonne, receiving in 1802 a grant of 11,500 acres\r\nin the township of Chester. He was engaged at the time of his death,\r\nwhich took place in 1804, in erecting a princely mansion at the foot of\r\nthe Mountain in Montreal. For half a century the ruins of this building\r\nwere the dread of children, and were known as McTavish's \"Haunted\r\nHouse.\" The fur-trader's tomb may still be recognized by an obelisk\r\nenclosed within stone walls, near \"Ravenscrag,\" the residence of the\r\nlate Sir Hugh Allan, which occupies the site of the old ruin. _Surely\r\nthe glory of the lords of the lakes and the forest has passed away._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nVOYAGES OF SIR ALEXANDER MACKENZIE.\r\n\r\n     A young Highlander--To rival Hearne--Fort Chipewyan\r\n     built--French Canadian voyageurs--Trader Leroux--Perils\r\n     of the route--Post erected on Arctic Coast--Return\r\n     journey--Pond's miscalculations--Hudson Bay Turner--Roderick\r\n     McKenzie's hospitality--Alexander Mackenzie--Astronomy and\r\n     mathematics--Winters on Peace River--Terrific journey--The Pacific\r\n     slope--Dangerous Indians--Pacific Ocean, 1793--North-West passage\r\n     by land--Great achievement--A notable book.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the chiefs of the fur traders seems to have had a higher ambition\r\nthan simply to carry back to Grand Portage canoes overflowing with\r\nfurs. Alexander Mackenzie had the restless spirit that made him a very\r\nuncertain partner in the great schemes of McTavish, Frobisher & Co., and\r\nled him to seek for glory in the task of exploration. Coming as a young\r\nHighlander to Montreal, he had early been so appreciated for his ability\r\nas to be sent by Gregory, McLeod & Co. to conduct their enterprise in\r\nDetroit. Then we have seen that, refusing to enter the McTavish Company,\r\nhe had gone to Churchill River for the Gregory Company. The sudden union\r\nof all the Montreal Companies (1787) caused, as already noted, by Pond's\r\nmurder of Ross, led to Alexander Mackenzie being placed in charge in\r\nthat year of the department of Athabasca.\r\n\r\nThe longed-for opportunity had now come to Mackenzie. He heard from the\r\nIndians and others of how Samuel Hearne, less than twenty years before,\r\non behalf of their great rivals, the Hudson's Bay Company, had returned\r\nby way of Lake Athabasca from his discovery of the Coppermine River. He\r\nlonged to reach the Arctic Sea by another river of which he had heard,\r\nand eclipse the discovery of his rival. He even had it in view to seek\r\nthe Pacific Ocean, of which he was constantly hearing from the Indians,\r\nwhere white men wearing armour were to be met--no doubt meaning the\r\nSpaniards.\r\n\r\nMackenzie proceeded in a very deliberate way to prepare for his long\r\njourney. Having this expedition in view, he secured the appointment of\r\nhis cousin, Roderick McKenzie, to his own department. Reaching Lake\r\nAthabasca, Roderick McKenzie selected a promontory running out some\r\nthree miles into the lake, and here built (1788) Fort Chipewyan, it\r\nbeing called from the Indians who chiefly frequented the district.\r\nIt became the most important fort of the north country, being at the\r\nconverging point of trade on the great watercourses of the north-west.\r\n\r\nOn June 3rd, 1789, Alexander Mackenzie started on his first exploration.\r\nIn his own birch-bark canoe was a crew of seven. His crew is worthy of\r\nbeing particularized. It consisted of four French Canadians, with the\r\nwives of two of them. These voyageurs were François Barrieau, Charles\r\nDucette, or Cadien, Joseph Landry, or Cadien, Pierre de Lorme. To\r\ncomplete the number was John Steinbruck, a German. The second canoe\r\ncontained the guide of the expedition, an Indian, called the \"English\r\nchief,\" who was a great trader, and had frequented year by year the\r\nroute to the English, on Hudson Bay. In his canoe were his two wives,\r\nand two young Indians. In a third canoe was trader Leroux, who was to\r\naccompany the explorer as far north as Slave Lake, and dispose of the\r\ngoods he took for furs. Leroux was under orders from his chief to build\r\na fort on Slave Lake.\r\n\r\nStarting on June 3rd, the party left the lake, finding their way down\r\nSlave River, which they already knew. Day after day they journeyed,\r\nsuffered from myriads of mosquitoes, passed the steep mountain portage,\r\nand, undergoing many hardships, reached Slave Lake in nine days.\r\n\r\nSkirting the lake, they departed north by an unknown river. This was\r\nthe object of Mackenzie's search. Floating down the stream, the Horn\r\nMountains were seen, portage after portage was crossed, the mouth of\r\nthe foaming Great Slave Lake River was passed, the snowy mountains came\r\nin view in the distance, and the party, undeterred, pressed forward on\r\ntheir voyage of discovery.\r\n\r\nThe usual incidents of early travel were experienced. The accidents,\r\nthough not serious, were numerous; the scenes met with were all new;\r\nthe natives were surprised at the bearded stranger; the usual deception\r\nand fickleness were displayed by the Indians, only to be overcome by\r\nthe firmness and tact of Mackenzie; and forty days after starting,\r\nthe expedition looked out upon the floating ice of the Arctic Ocean.\r\nMackenzie, on the morning of July 14th, erected a post on the shore, on\r\nwhich he engraved the latitude of the place (69 deg. 14´ N.), his own\r\nname, the number of persons in the party, and the time they remained\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nHis object having been thus accomplished, the important matter was to\r\nreach Lake Athabasca in the remaining days of the open season. The\r\nreturn journey had the usual experiences, and on August 24th they\r\ncame upon Leroux on Slave Lake, where that trader had erected Fort\r\nProvidence. On September 12th the expedition arrived safely at Fort\r\nChipewyan, the time of absence having been 102 days. The story of this\r\njourney is given in a graphic and unaffected manner by Mackenzie in his\r\nwork of 1801, but no mention is made of his own name being attached to\r\nthe river which he had discovered.\r\n\r\nWe have stated that Peter Pond had prepared a map of the north country,\r\nwith the purpose of presenting it to the Empress of Russia. Being a man\r\nof great energy, he was not deterred from this undertaking by the fact\r\nthat he had no knowledge of astronomical instruments and little of the\r\nart of map-making. His statements were made on the basis of reports from\r\nthe Indians, whose custom was always to make the leagues short, that\r\nthey might boast of the length of their journeys. Computing in this way,\r\nhe made Lake Athabasca so far from Hudson Bay and the Grand Portage\r\nthat, taking Captain Cook's observations on the Pacific Coast four years\r\nbefore this, the lake was only, according to his calculations, a hundred\r\nor a hundred and fifty miles from the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe effect of Pond's calculations, which became known in the Treaty of\r\nParis, was to stimulate the Hudson's Bay Company to follow up Hearne's\r\ndiscoveries and to explore the country west of Lake Athabasca. They\r\nattempted this in 1785, but they sent out a boy of fifteen, named\r\nGeorge Charles, who had been one year at a mathematical school, and\r\nhad never made there more than simple observations. As was to have been\r\nexpected, the boy proved incompetent. Urged on by the Colonial Office,\r\nthey again in 1791 organized an expedition to send Astronomer Philip\r\nTurnor to make the western journey. Unaccustomed to the Far West, and\r\npoorly provided for this journey, Turner found himself at Fort Chipewyan\r\nentirely dependent for help and shelter on the Nor'-Westers. He was,\r\nhowever, qualified for his work, and made correct observations, which\r\nsettled the question of the distance of the Pacific Ocean. Mr. Roderick\r\nMcKenzie showed him every hospitality. This expedition served at least\r\nto show that the Pacific was certainly five times the distance from Lake\r\nAthabasca that Pond had estimated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR ALEXANDER MACKENZIE.]\r\n\r\nAfter coming back from the Arctic Sea, Alexander Mackenzie spent his\r\ntime in urging forward the business of the fur trade, especially north\r\nof Lake Athabasca; but there was burning in his breast the desire to be\r\nthe discoverer of the Western Sea. The voyage of Turner made him still\r\nmore desirous of going to the West.\r\n\r\nLike Hearne, Alexander Mackenzie had found the want of astronomical\r\nknowledge and the lack of suitable instruments a great drawback in\r\ndetermining his whereabouts from day to day. With remarkable energy, he,\r\nin the year 1791, journeyed eastward to Canada, crossed the Atlantic\r\nOcean to London, and spent the winter in acquiring the requisite\r\nmathematical knowledge and a sufficient acquaintance with instruments to\r\nenable him to take observations.\r\n\r\nHe was now prepared to make his journey to the Pacific Ocean. He states\r\nthat the courage of his party had been kept up on their reaching the\r\nArctic Sea, by the thought that they were approaching the Mer de\r\nl'Ouest, which, it will be remembered, Verendrye had sought with such\r\npassionate desire.\r\n\r\nIn the very year in which Mackenzie returned from Great Britain,\r\nhis great purpose to reach the Pacific Coast led him to make his\r\npreparations in the autumn, and on October 10th, 1792, to leave Fort\r\nChipewyan and proceed as far up Peace River as the farthest settlement,\r\nand there winter, to be ready for an early start in the following\r\nspring. On his way he overtook Mr. Finlay, the younger, and called upon\r\nhim in his camp near the fort, where he was to trade for the winter.\r\nLeaving Mr. Finlay \"under several volleys of musketry,\" Mackenzie\r\npushed on and reached the spot where the men had been despatched in\r\nthe preceding spring to square timber for a house and cut palisades to\r\nfortify it. Here, where the Boncave joins the main branch of the Peace\r\nRiver, the fort was erected. His own house was not ready for occupation\r\nbefore December 23rd, and the body of the men went on after that date\r\nto erect five houses for which the material had been prepared. Troubles\r\nwere plentiful; such as the quarrelsomeness of the natives, the killing\r\nof an Indian, and in the latter part of the winter severe cold. In May,\r\nMackenzie despatched six canoes laden with furs for Fort Chipewyan.\r\n\r\nThe somewhat cool reception that Mackenzie had received from the other\r\npartners at Grand Portage, when on a former occasion he had given an\r\naccount of his voyage to the Arctic Sea, led him to be doubtful whether\r\nhis confrères would fully approve the great expedition on which he was\r\ndetermined to go. He was comparatively a young man, and he knew that\r\nthere were many of the traders jealous of him. Still, his determined\r\ncharacter led him to hold to his plan, and his great energy urged him to\r\nmake a name for himself.\r\n\r\nMackenzie had found much difficulty in securing guides and voyageurs.\r\nThe trip proposed was so difficult that the bravest shrank from it. The\r\nexplorer had, however, great confidence in his colleague, Alexander\r\nMackay, who had arrived at the Forks a few weeks before the departure.\r\nMackay was a most experienced and shrewd man. After faithfully serving\r\nhis Company, he entered, as we shall see, the Astor Fur Company in\r\n1811, and was killed among the first in the fierce attack on the ship\r\n_Tonquin_, which was captured by the natives. Mackenzie's crew was\r\nthe best he could obtain, and their names have become historic. There\r\nwere besides Mackay, Joseph Landry and Charles Ducette, two voyageurs\r\nof the former expedition, Baptiste Bisson, François Courtois, Jacques\r\nBeauchamp, and François Beaulieu, the last of whom died so late as\r\n1872, aged nearly one hundred years, probably the oldest man in the\r\nNorth-West at the time. Archbishop Taché gives an interesting account\r\nof Beaulieu's baptism at the age of seventy. Two Indians completed the\r\nparty, one of whom had been so idle a lad, that he bore till his dying\r\nday the unenviable name of \"Cancre\"--the crab.\r\n\r\nHaving taken, on the day of his departure, the latitude and longitude\r\nof his winter post, Mackenzie started on May 9th, 1793, for his notable\r\nvoyage. Seeing on the banks of the river elk, buffalo, and bear, the\r\nexpedition pushed ahead, meeting the difficulties of navigation with\r\npatience and skill. The murmurs of his men and the desire to turn back\r\nmade no impression on Mackenzie, who, now that his Highland blood\r\nwas up, determined to see the journey through. The difficulties of\r\nnavigation became extreme, and at times the canoes had to be drawn up\r\nstream by the branches of trees.\r\n\r\nAt length in longitude 121° W. Mackenzie reached a lake, which he\r\nconsidered the head of the Ayugal or Peace River. Here the party landed,\r\nunloaded the canoes, and by a portage of half-a-mile on a well-beaten\r\npath, came upon another small lake. From this lake the explorers\r\nfollowed a small river, and here the guide deserted the party. On June\r\n17th the members of the expedition enjoyed, after all their toil and\r\nanxiety, the \"inexpressible satisfaction of finding themselves on the\r\nbank of a navigable river on the west side of the first great range of\r\nmountains.\"\r\n\r\nRunning rapids, breaking canoes, re-ascending streams, quieting\r\ndiscontent, building new canoes, disturbing tribes of surprised Indians,\r\nand urging on his discouraged band, Mackenzie persistently kept on his\r\nway. He was descending on Tacouche Tesse, afterwards known as the Fraser\r\nRiver. Finding that the distance by this river was too great, he turned\r\nback. At the point where he took this step (June 23rd) was afterwards\r\nbuilt Alexandria Fort, named after the explorer. Leaving the great\r\nriver, the party crossed the country to what Mackenzie called the West\r\nRoad River. For this land journey, begun on July 4th, the explorers were\r\nprovided with food. After sixteen days of a most toilsome journey, they\r\nat length came upon an arm of the sea. The Indians near the coast seemed\r\nvery troublesome, but the courage of Mackenzie never failed him. It was\r\nrepresented to him that the natives \"were as numerous as mosquitoes and\r\nof a very malignant character.\"\r\n\r\nHis destination having been reached, the commander mixed up some\r\nvermilion in melted grease and inscribed in large characters on the\r\nsouth-east face of the rock, on which they passed the night, \"Alexander\r\nMackenzie, from Canada, by land the twenty-second of July, one thousand\r\nseven hundred and ninety-three.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a short rest the well-repaid explorers began their homeward\r\njourney. To ascend the Pacific slope was a toilsome and discouraging\r\nundertaking, but the energy which had enabled them to come through\r\nan unknown road easily led them back by a way that had now lost its\r\nuncertainty. Mackenzie says that when \"we reached the downward current\r\nof the Peace River and came in view of Fort McLeod, we threw out our\r\nflag and accompanied it with a general discharge of fire-arms, while\r\nthe men were in such spirits and made such an active use of their\r\npaddles, that we arrived before the two men whom we left in the spring\r\ncould recover their senses to answer us. Thus we landed at four in the\r\nafternoon at the place which we left in the month of May. In another\r\nmonth (August 24th) Fort Chipewyan was reached, where the following\r\nwinter was spent in trade.\"\r\n\r\nIt is hard to estimate all the obstacles overcome and the great service\r\nrendered in the two voyages of Alexander Mackenzie. Readers of the\r\n\"North-West Passage by Land\" will remember the pitiable plight in which\r\nLord Milton and Dr. Cheadle, nearly seventy years afterwards, reached\r\nthe coast. Mackenzie's journey was more difficult, but the advantage\r\nlay with the fur-traders in that they were experts in the matters of\r\nNorth-West travel. Time and again, Mackenzie's party became discouraged.\r\nWhen the Pacific slope was reached, and the voyageurs saw the waters\r\nbegin to run away from the country with which they were acquainted,\r\ntheir fears were aroused, and it was natural that they should be\r\nunwilling to proceed further.\r\n\r\nMackenzie had, however, all the instincts of a brave and tactful\r\nleader. On one occasion he was compelled to take a stand and declare\r\nthat if his party deserted him, he would go on alone. This at once\r\naroused their admiration and sympathy, and they offered to follow him.\r\nAt the point on the great river where he turned back, the Indians were\r\nexceedingly hostile. His firmness and perfect self-control showed the\r\nsame spirit that is found in all great leaders in dealing with savage or\r\nsemi-civilized races. Men like Frontenac, Mackenzie, and General Gordon\r\nseemed to have a charmed life which enabled them to exercise a species\r\nof mesmeric influence over half-trained or entirely uncultivated minds.\r\n\r\nFrom the wider standpoint, knowledge was supplied as to the country\r\nlying between the two great oceans, and while it did not, as we know\r\nfrom the voyages seeking a North-West Passage in this century, lay\r\nthe grim spectre of an Arctic channel, yet it was a fulfilment of\r\nVerendrye's dream, and to Alexander Mackenzie, a Canadian bourgeois, a\r\nself-made man, aided by his Scotch and French associates, had come the\r\nhappy opportunity of discovering \"La Grande Mer de l'Ouest.\"\r\n\r\nAlexander Mackenzie, filled with the sense of the importance of his\r\ndiscovery, determined to give it to the world, and spent the winter at\r\nFort Chipewyan in preparing the material. In this he was much assisted\r\nby his cousin, Roderick McKenzie, to whom he sent the journal for\r\nrevision and improvement. Early in the year 1794, the distinguished\r\nexplorer left Lake Athabasca, journeyed over to Grand Portage, and a\r\nyear afterward revisited his native land. He never returned to the\r\n\"Upper Country,\" as the Athabasca region was called, but became one\r\nof the agents of the fur-traders in Montreal, never coming farther\r\ntoward the North-west than to be present at the annual gatherings of\r\nthe traders at Grand Portage. The veteran explorer continued in this\r\nposition till the time when he crossed the Atlantic and published his\r\nwell-known \"Voyages from Montreal,\" dedicated to \"His Most Sacred\r\nMajesty George the Third.\" The book, while making no pretensions to\r\nliterary attainment, is yet a clear, succinct, and valuable account of\r\nthe fur trade and his own expeditions. It was the work which excited\r\nthe interest of Lord Selkirk in Rupert's Land and which has become a\r\nrecognized authority.\r\n\r\nIn 1801 this work of Alexander Mackenzie was published, and the order\r\nof knighthood was conferred upon the successful explorer. On his return\r\nto Canada, Sir Alexander engaged in strong opposition to the North-West\r\nCompany and became a member of the Legislative Assembly for Huntingdon\r\nCounty, in Lower Canada. He lived in Scotland during the last years of\r\nhis life, and died in the same year as the Earl of Selkirk, 1820. Thus\r\npassed away a man of independent mind and of the highest distinction.\r\nHis name is fixed upon a region that is now coming into greater notice\r\nthan ever before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT EXPLORATION.\r\n\r\n     Grand Portage on American soil--Anxiety about the\r\n     boundary--David Thompson, astronomer and surveyor--His\r\n     instructions--By swift canoe--The land of beaver--A dash to the\r\n     Mandans--Stone Indian House--Fixes the boundary at Pembina--Sources\r\n     of the Mississippi--A marvellous explorer--Pacific slope\r\n     explored--Thompson down the Kootenay and Columbia--Fiery Simon\r\n     Fraser in New Caledonia--Discovers Fraser River--Sturdy John\r\n     Stuart--Thompson River--Bourgeois Quesnel--Transcontinental\r\n     expeditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nA number of events conspired to make it necessary for the North-West\r\nCompany to be well acquainted with the location of its forts within the\r\nlimits of the territory of the United States, in some parts of which\r\nit carried on operations of trade, and to understand its relation to\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company's territory. The treaty of amity and commerce,\r\nwhich is usually connected with the name of John Jay, 1794, seemed\r\nto say that all British forts in United States territory were to be\r\nevacuated in two years. This threw the partners at Grand Portage into a\r\nstate of excitement, inasmuch as they knew that the very place of their\r\ngathering was on the American side of the boundary line.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID THOMPSON, ASTRONOMER AND SURVEYOR.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the fitting instrument appeared at Grand Portage. This\r\nwas David Thompson. This gentleman was a Londoner, educated at the Blue\r\nCoat School, in London. Trained thoroughly in mathematics and the use\r\nof astronomical instruments, he had obtained a position in the Hudson's\r\nBay Company. In the summer of 1795, with three companions, two of them\r\nIndians, he had found his way from Hudson Bay to Lake Athabasca, and\r\nthus showed his capability as an explorer. Returning from his Western\r\nexpedition, he reported to Mr. Joseph Colon, the officer in charge at\r\nYork Fort, by whose orders he had gone to Athabasca, and expressed\r\nhimself as willing to undertake further explorations for the Company.\r\nThe answer was curt--to the effect that no more surveys could then be\r\nundertaken by the Company, however desirable. Thompson immediately\r\ndecided to seek employment elsewhere in the work for which he was\r\nso well qualified. Leaving the Bay and the Company behind, attended\r\nonly by two Indians, he journeyed inland and presented himself at the\r\nsummer meeting of the North-West fur-traders at Grand Portage. Without\r\nhesitation they appointed him astronomer and surveyor of the North-West\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nAstronomer Thompson's work was well mapped out for him.\r\n\r\n(1) He was instructed to survey the forty-ninth parallel of latitude.\r\nThis involved a question which had greatly perplexed the diplomatists,\r\nviz. the position of the source of the Mississippi. Many years after\r\nthis date it was a question to decide which tributary is the source of\r\nthe Mississippi, and to this day there is a difference of opinion on the\r\nsubject, i.e. which of the lakes from which different branches spring is\r\nthe true source of the river. The fact that the sources were a factor in\r\nthe settling of the boundary line of this time made it necessary to have\r\nexpert testimony on the question such as could be furnished by a survey\r\nby Thompson.\r\n\r\n(2) The surveyor was to go to the Missouri and visit the ancient\r\nvillages of the natives who dwelt there and who practised agriculture.\r\n\r\n(3) In the interests of science and history, to inquire for the fossils\r\nof large animals, and to search for any monuments that might throw a\r\nlight on the ancient state of the regions traversed.\r\n\r\n(4) It was his special duty to determine the exact position of the posts\r\nof the North-West Company visited by him, and all agents and employés\r\nwere instructed to render him every assistance in his work.\r\n\r\nAstronomer Thompson only waited the departure of one of the Great\r\nNorthern brigades to enter upon the duties of his new office. These\r\ndepartures were the events of the year, having in the eyes of the\r\nfur-traders something of the nature of a caravan for Mecca about\r\nthem. Often a brigade consisted of eight canoes laden with goods and\r\nwell-manned. The brigade which Thompson accompanied was made up of four\r\ncanoes under trader McGillies, and was ready to start on August 9th,\r\n1796. He had taken the observation for Grand Portage and found it to be\r\n48 deg. (nearly) N. latitude and 89 deg. 3´ 4´´ (nearly) W. longitude.\r\n\r\nHe was now ready with his instruments--a sextant of ten inches radius,\r\nwith quicksilver and parallel glasses, an excellent achromatic\r\ntelescope, one of the smaller kind, drawing instruments, and a\r\nthermometer, and all of these of the best make. The portage was wearily\r\ntrudged, and in a few days, after a dozen shorter portages, the height\r\nof land was reached in 48 deg. N. latitude, and here begins the flow of\r\nwater to Hudson Bay. It was accordingly the claim of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany that their territory extended from this point to the Bay. At the\r\noutlet of Rainy Lake still stood a trading post, where Verendrye had\r\nfounded his fort, and the position of this was determined, 48 deg. 1´\r\n2´´ N. latitude. In this locality was also a post of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nNo post seems at this time to have been in use on Rainy River or Lake\r\nof the Woods by any of the trading companies, though it will be seen\r\nthat the X Y Company was at this date beginning its operations. At the\r\nmouth of the Winnipeg River, however, there were two establishments, the\r\none known as Lake Winnipeg House, or Bas de la Rivière, an important\r\ndistributing point, now found to be in 50 deg. 1´ 2´´ N. latitude.\r\nThere was also near by it the Hudson's Bay Company post, founded in the\r\nprevious year.\r\n\r\nThompson, being in company with his brigade, which was going to the west\r\nof Lake Manitoba, coasted along Lake Winnipeg, finding it dangerous\r\nto cross directly, and after taking this roundabout, in place of the\r\n127 miles in a straight line, reached what is now known as the Little\r\nSaskatchewan River on the west side of Lake Winnipeg.\r\n\r\nGoing by the little Saskatchewan River through its windings and across\r\nthe meadow portage, he came to Lake Winnipegoosis and, northward along\r\nits western coast, reached Swan River, the trappers' paradise. Swan\r\nRiver post was twelve miles up the river from its mouth, and was found\r\nto be in 52 deg 24´ N. latitude. Crossing over to the Assiniboine (Stone\r\nIndian) River, he visited several posts, the most considerable being\r\nFort Tremblant (Poplar Fort), which some think had its name changed to\r\nFort Alexandria in honour of Sir Alexander Mackenzie.\r\n\r\nJohn McDonnell, North-West trader of this period, says:--\"Fort Tremblant\r\nand the temporary posts established above it furnished most of the\r\nbeaver and otter in the Red River returns, but the trade has been almost\r\nruined since the Hudson's Bay Company entered the Assiniboine River by\r\nthe way of Swan River, carrying their merchandise from one river to the\r\nother on horseback--three days' journey--who by that means, and the\r\nshort distance between Swan River and their factory at York Fort, from\r\nwhence they are equipped, can arrive at the _coude de l'homme_ (a river\r\nbend or angle) in the Assiniboine River, a month sooner than we can\r\nreturn from Grand Portage, secure the fall trade, give credits to the\r\nIndians, and send them to hunt before our arrival; so that we see but\r\nfew in that quarter upon our arrival.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief trader of this locality was Cuthbert Grant, who, as before\r\nmentioned, was a man of great influence in the fur trade.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer next went to the Fort between the Swan and Assiniboine\r\nRivers, near the spot where the famous Fort Pelly of the present day\r\nis situated. Taking horses, a rapid land journey was made to Belleau's\r\nFort, lying in 53 deg. N. latitude (nearly).\r\n\r\nThe whole district is a succession of beaver meadows, and had at this\r\ntime several Hudson's Bay Company posts, as already mentioned. Thompson\r\ndecided to winter in this beaver country, and when the following summer\r\nhad fairly set in with good roads and blossoming prairies, he came,\r\nafter journeying more than 200 miles southward, to the Qu'Appelle River\r\npost, which was at that time under a trader named Thorburn. Thompson was\r\nnow fairly on the Assiniboine River, and saw it everywhere run through\r\nan agreeable country with a good soil and adapted to agriculture.\r\n\r\nArrived at Assiniboine House, he found it in charge of John McDonnell,\r\nbrother of the well-known Miles McDonnell, who, a few years later,\r\nbecame Lord Selkirk's first governor on Red River. Ensconcing himself\r\nin the comfortable quarters at Assiniboine House, Thompson wrote up in\r\nink his journals, maps, astronomical observations, and sketches which he\r\nhad taken in crayon, thus giving them more permanent form. He had now\r\nbeen in the employ of the North-West Company a full year, and in that\r\ntime had been fully gratified by the work he had done and by the cordial\r\nreception given him in all the forts to which he had gone.\r\n\r\nAssiniboine House, or, as he called it, Stone Indian House, was found to\r\nbe a congenial spot. It was on the north side of the Assiniboine River,\r\nnot far from where the Souris River empties its waters into the larger\r\nstream, though the site has been disputed.\r\n\r\nOne of the astronomer's clearly defined directions was to visit the\r\nMandan villages on the Missouri River. He was now at the point when this\r\ncould be accomplished, although the time chosen by him, just as winter\r\nwas coming on, was most unsuitable. His journey reminds us of that made\r\nby Verendrye to the Mandans in 1738.\r\n\r\nThe journey was carefully prepared for. With the characteristic\r\nshrewdness of the North-West Company, it was so planned as to require\r\nlittle expenditure. Thompson was to be accompanied chiefly by\r\nfree-traders, i.e. by men to whom certain quantities of goods would be\r\nadvanced by the Company. By the profits of this trade expenses would be\r\nmet. The guide and interpreter was René Jussaume (a man of very doubtful\r\ncharacter), who had fallen into the ways of the Western Indians. He had\r\nlived for years among the Mandans, and spoke their language. Another\r\nfree-trader, Hugh McCracken, an Irishman, also knew the Mandan country,\r\nwhile several French Canadians, with Brossman, the astronomer's servant\r\nman, made up the company. Each of the traders took a credit from Mr.\r\nMcDonnell of from forty to fifty skins in goods. Ammunition, tobacco,\r\nand trinkets, to pay expenses, were provided, and Thompson was supplied\r\nwith two horses, and his chief trader, Jussaume, with one. The men had\r\ntheir own dogs to the number of thirty, and these drew goods on small\r\nsleds. Crossing the Assiniboine, the party started south-westward, and\r\ncontinued their journey for thirty-three days, with the thermometer\r\nalmost always below zero and reaching at times 36 deg. below. The\r\njourney was a most dangerous and trying one and covered 280 miles.\r\nThompson found that some Hudson's Bay traders had already made flying\r\nvisits to the Mandans. On his return, Thompson's itinerary was, from the\r\nMissouri till he reached the angle of the Souris River, seventy miles,\r\nwhere he found abundant wood and shelter, and then to the south end\r\nof Turtle Mountain, fourteen miles. Leaving Turtle Mountain, his next\r\nstation was twenty-four miles distant at a point on the Souris where an\r\noutpost of Assiniboine House, known as Ash House, had been established.\r\nAnother journey of forty-five miles brought the expedition back to the\r\nhospitable shelter of Mr. McDonnell at Stone Indian House. Thompson now\r\ncalculated the position of this comfortable fort and found it to be 49\r\ndeg. 41´ (nearly) N. latitude and 101 deg. 1´ 4´´ (nearly) W. longitude.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer, after spending a few weeks in making up his notes\r\nand surveys, determined to go eastward and undertake the survey of\r\nthe Red River. On February 26th, 1798, he started with three French\r\nCanadians and an Indian guide. Six dogs drew three sleds laden with\r\nbaggage and provisions. The company soon reached the sand hills, then\r\ncalled the Manitou Hills, from some supposed supernatural agency in\r\ntheir neighbourhood. Sometimes on the ice, and at other times on the\r\nnorth shore of the Assiniboine to avoid the bends of the river, the\r\nparty went, experiencing much difficulty from the depth of the snow.\r\nAt length, after journeying ten days over the distance of 169 miles,\r\nthe junction of the Assiniboine and Red River, at the point where now\r\nstands the city of Winnipeg, was reached. There was no trading post here\r\nat the time. It seems somewhat surprising that what became the chief\r\ntrading centre of the company, Fort Garry, during the first half of this\r\ncentury should, up to the end of the former century, not have been taken\r\npossession of by any of the three competing fur companies.\r\n\r\nLosing no time, Thompson began, on March 7th, the survey, and going\r\nsouthward over an unbroken trail, with the snow three feet deep, reached\r\nin seven days Pembina Post, then under the charge of a leading French\r\ntrader of the company, named Charles Chaboillez. Wearied with a journey\r\nof some sixty-four miles, which had, from the bad road, taken seven\r\ndays, Thompson enjoyed the kind shelter of Pembina House for six days.\r\nThis house was near the forty-ninth parallel and was one of the especial\r\npoints he had been appointed to determine. He found Pembina House to be\r\nin latitude 48 deg. 58´ 24´´ N., so that it was by a very short distance\r\non the south side of the boundary line. Thompson marked the boundary,\r\nso that the trading post might be removed, when necessary, to the north\r\nside of the line. A few years later, the observation taken by Thompson\r\nwas confirmed by Major Long on his expedition of 1823, but the final\r\nsettlement of where the line falls was not made till the time of the\r\nboundary commission of 1872.\r\n\r\nPushing southward in March, the astronomer ascended Red River to the\r\ntrading post known as Upper Red River, near where the town of Grand\r\nForks, North Dakota, stands to-day. Here he found J. Baptiste Cadot,\r\nprobably the son of the veteran master of Sault Ste. Marie, who so long\r\nclung to the flag of the Golden Lilies.\r\n\r\nThompson now determined to survey what had been an object of much\r\ninterest, the lake which was the source of the great River Mississippi.\r\nTo do this had been laid upon him in his instructions from the\r\nNorth-West Company. Making a détour from Grand Forks, in order to avoid\r\nthe ice on the Red Lake River, he struck the upper waters of that\r\nriver, and followed the banks until he reached Red Lake in what is now\r\nNorth-Eastern Minnesota. Leaving this lake, he made a portage of six\r\nmiles to Turtle Lake, and four days later reached the point considered\r\nby him to be the source of the Mississippi. Turtle Lake, at the time of\r\nthe treaty of 1783, was supposed to be further north than the north-west\r\nangle of the Lake of the Woods. This arose, Thompson tells us, from the\r\nvoyageurs counting a pipe to a league, at the end of which time it was\r\nthe fur-traders' custom to take a rest. Each pipe, that is, the length\r\nof time taken to smoke a pipe, however, was nearer two miles than\r\nthree, so that the head waters of the Mississippi had been counted 128\r\nmiles further north than Thompson found them to be. It is to be noted,\r\nhowever, that the Astronomer Thompson was wrong in making Turtle Lake\r\nthe source of the Mississippi. The accredited source of the Mississippi\r\nwas discovered, as we shall afterwards see, in July, 1832, to be Lake\r\nItasca, which lies about half a degree south-west of Turtle Lake.\r\n\r\nThompson next visited Red Cedar Lake, in the direction of Lake Superior.\r\nHere he found a North-West trading house, Upper Red Cedar House, under\r\nthe command of a partner, John Sayer, whose half-blood son afterward\r\nfigured in Red River history. He found that Sayer and his men passed the\r\nwinter on wild rice and maple sugar as their only food.\r\n\r\nCrossing over to Sand Lake River, Mr. Thompson found a small post of\r\nthe North-West Company, and, descending this stream, came to Sand Lake.\r\nBy portage, reaching a small stream, a tributary of St. Louis River, he\r\nsoon arrived at that river itself, with its rapids and dalles, and at\r\nlength reached the North-West trading post near the mouth of the river,\r\nwhere it joined the Fond du Lac.\r\n\r\nHaving come to Lake Superior, the party could only obtain a dilapidated\r\nnorthern canoe, but with care it brought them, after making an enormous\r\ncircuit and accomplishing feats involving great daring and supreme\r\nhardship, along the north shore of the lake to Grand Portage. On hearing\r\nhis report of two years' work, the partners, at the annual meeting at\r\nGrand Portage, found they had made no mistake in their appointment, and\r\ngave him the highest praise.\r\n\r\nThe time had now come, after the union of the North-West Company and\r\nthe X Y Company, for pushing ahead the great work in their hands and\r\nexamining the vast country across the Rocky Mountains. The United\r\nCompany in 1805 naturally took up what had been planned several years\r\nbefore, and sent David Thompson up the Saskatchewan to explore the\r\nColumbia River and examine the vast \"sea of mountains\" bordering on the\r\nPacific Ocean. The other partner chosen was Simon Fraser, and his orders\r\nwere to go up the Peace River, cross the Rockies, and explore the region\r\nfrom its northern side. We shall see how well Fraser did his part, and\r\nmeanwhile we may follow Thompson in his journey.\r\n\r\nIn 1806, we find that he crossed the Rockies and built in the following\r\nyear a trading-house for the North-West Company on the Lower Columbia.\r\nThompson called his trading post Kootenay House, and indeed his\r\npersistent use of the term \"Kootenay\" rather than \"Columbia,\" which he\r\nwell knew was the name of the river, is somewhat remarkable. Coming over\r\nthe pass during the summer he returned to Kootenay House and wintered\r\nthere in 1807-1808. During the summer of 1808, he visited possibly Grand\r\nPortage, certainly Fort Vermilion. Fort Vermilion, a short distance\r\nabove the present Fort Pitt, was well down the north branch of the\r\nSaskatchewan River, and on his way to it, Thompson would pass Fort\r\nAugustus, a short distance below where Edmonton now stands, as well as\r\nFort George.\r\n\r\nHe left Fort Vermilion in September, and by October 21st, the\r\nSaskatchewan being frozen over, he laid up canoes for the winter, and\r\ntaking horses, crossed the Rocky Mountains, took to canoes on the\r\nColumbia River again, and on November 10th arrived at his fort of\r\nKootenay House, where he wintered. On this journey, Thompson discovered\r\nHowse's Pass, which is about 52 deg. N. latitude.\r\n\r\nIn 1809, Thompson determined on extending his explorations southward on\r\nthe Columbia River. A short distance south of the international boundary\r\nline, he built a post in September of that year. He seems to have spent\r\nthe winter of this year in trying new routes, some of which he found\r\nimpracticable, and can hardly be said to have wintered at any particular\r\nspot. In his pilgrimage, he went up the Kootenay River, which he called\r\nMcGillivray's River, in honour of the famous partner, but the name has\r\nnot been retained. Hastening to his post of Kootenay House, he rested a\r\nday, and travelling by means of canoes and horses, in great speed came\r\neastward and reached Fort Augustus, eight days out from Kootenay, June\r\n22nd, 1810. From this point he went eastward, at least as far as Rainy\r\nLake, leaving his \"little family\" with his sister-in-law, a Cree woman,\r\nat Winnipeg River House.\r\n\r\nReturning, he started on October 10th, 1810, for Athabasca. He\r\ndiscovered the Athabasca Pass on the \"divide,\" and on July 3rd, 1811,\r\nstarted to descend the Columbia, and did so, the first white man, as far\r\nas Lewis River, from which point Lewis and Clark in 1805, having come\r\nover the Rocky Mountains, had preceded him to the sea. Near the junction\r\nof the Spokane River with the Columbia, he erected a pole and tied\r\nto it a half-sheet of paper, claiming the country north of the forks\r\nas British territory. This notice was seen by a number of the Astor\r\nemployés, for Ross states that he observed it in August, with a British\r\nflag flying upon it. Thompson's name among the Indians of the coast was\r\n\"Koo-Koo-Suit.\"\r\n\r\nRoss Cox states that \"in the month of July, 1811, Mr. David Thompson,\r\nAstronomer to the North-West Company, of which he was also a proprietor,\r\narrived with nine men in a canoe at Astoria from the interior. This\r\ngentleman came on a voyage of discovery to the Columbia, preparatory to\r\nthe North-West Company forming a settlement at the mouth of the river.\r\nHe remained at Astoria until the latter end of July, when he took his\r\ndeparture for the interior.\"\r\n\r\nThompson was thus disappointed on finding the American company installed\r\nat the mouth of the Columbia before him, but he re-ascended the river\r\nand founded two forts on its banks at advantageous points.\r\n\r\nThompson left the western country with his Indian wife and children soon\r\nafter this, and in Eastern Canada, in 1812-13, prepared a grand map of\r\nthe country, which adorned for a number of years the banqueting-room of\r\nthe bourgeois at Fort William and is now in the Government buildings at\r\nToronto.\r\n\r\nIn 1814 he definitely left the upper country, and was employed by the\r\nImperial Government in surveying a part of the boundary line of the\r\nUnited States and Canada. He also surveyed the watercourses between the\r\nOttawa River and Georgian Bay. He lived for years at the River Raisin,\r\nnear Williamstown, in Upper Canada, and was very poor. At the great\r\nage of eighty-seven, he died at Longueil. He was not appreciated as he\r\ndeserved. His energy, scientific knowledge, experience, and successful\r\nwork for the Company for sixteen years make him one of the most notable\r\nmen of the period.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMON FRASER, FUR-TRADER AND EXPLORER.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the entrance by the northern access to the Pacific\r\nslope was confided to Simon Fraser, and we may well, after considering\r\nthe exploits of David Thompson, refer to those of his colleague in the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nSimon Fraser, one of the most daring of the fur-traders, was the son\r\nof a Scottish U.E. Loyalist,[4] who was captured by the Americans at\r\nBurgoyne's surrender and who died in prison. The widowed mother took her\r\ninfant boy to Canada, and lived near Cornwall. After going to school,\r\nthe boy, who was of the Roman Catholic faith, entered the North-West\r\nCompany at the age of sixteen as a clerk, and early became a bourgeois\r\nof the Company. His administrative ability led to his being appointed\r\nagent at Grand Portage in 1797. A few years afterwards, Fraser was\r\nsent to the Athabasca region, which was at that time the point aimed\r\nat by the ambitious and determined young Nor'-Westers. By way of Peace\r\nRiver, he undertook to make his journey to the west side of the Rocky\r\nMountains. Leaving the bulk of his command at the Rocky Mountain\r\nportage, he pushed on with six men, and reaching the height of land,\r\ncrossed to the lake, which he called McLeod's in honour of his prominent\r\npartner, Archibald Norman McLeod. Stationing three men at this point,\r\nFraser returned to his command and wintered there.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1806 he passed through the mountains, and came upon a\r\nriver, which he called Stuart River. John Stuart, who was at that time\r\na clerk, was for thirty years afterwards identified with the fur trade.\r\nStuart Lake, in British Columbia, was also called after him. On the\r\nStuart River, Fraser built a post, which, in honour of his fatherland,\r\nhe called New Caledonia, and this probably led to this great region on\r\nthe west of the mountains being called New Caledonia. Stuart was left in\r\ncharge of this post, and Fraser went west to a lake, which since that\r\ntime has been called Fraser Lake. He returned to winter at the new fort.\r\n\r\nFraser's disposition to explore and his success thus far led the\r\nCompany to urge their confrère to push on and descend the great River\r\nTacouche Tesse, down which Alexander Mackenzie had gone for some\r\ndistance, and which was supposed to be the Columbia. It was this\r\nexpedition which created Fraser's fame. The orders to advance had been\r\nbrought to him in two canoes by two traders, Jules Maurice Quesnel and\r\n(Hugh) Faries.\r\n\r\nLeaving behind Faries with two men in the new fort, Fraser, at the mouth\r\nof the Nechaco or Stuart River, where afterward stood Fort George,\r\ngathered his expedition, and was ready to depart on his great, we may\r\nwell call it terrific, voyage, down the river which since that time\r\nhas borne his name. His company consisted of Stuart, Quesnel, nineteen\r\nvoyageurs, and two Indians, in four canoes. It is worthy of note that\r\nJohn Stuart, who was Fraser's lieutenant, was in many ways the real\r\nleader of the expedition. Having been educated in engineering, Stuart,\r\nby his scientific knowledge, was indispensable to the exploring party.\r\n\r\nOn May 22nd a start was made from the forks. We have in Masson's first\r\nvolume preserved to us Simon Fraser's journal of this remarkable voyage,\r\nstarting from the Rockies down the river. The keynote to the whole\r\nexpedition is given us in the seventh line of the journal. \"Having\r\nproceeded about eighteen miles, we came to a strong rapid which we\r\nran down, nearly wrecking one of our canoes against a precipice which\r\nforms the right bank of the river.\" A succession of rapids, overhung by\r\nenormous heights of perpendicular rocks, made it almost as difficult\r\nto portage as it would have been to risk the passage of the canoes and\r\ntheir loads down the boiling cauldron of the river.\r\n\r\nNothing can equal the interest of hearing in the explorer's own words\r\nan incident or two of the journey. On the first Wednesday of June he\r\nwrites: \"Leaving Mr. Stuart and two men at the lower end of the rapid\r\nin order to watch the motions of the natives, I returned with the other\r\nfour men to the camp. Immediately on my arrival I ordered the five men\r\nout of the crews into a canoe lightly loaded, and the canoe was in a\r\nmoment under way. After passing the first cascade she lost her course\r\nand was drawn into the eddy, whirled about for a considerable time,\r\nseemingly in suspense whether to sink or swim, the men having no power\r\nover her. However, she took a favourable turn, and by degrees was led\r\nfrom this dangerous vortex again into the stream. In this manner she\r\ncontinued, flying from one danger to another, until the last cascade but\r\none, where in spite of every effort the whirlpools forced her against\r\na low projecting rock. Upon this the men debarked, saved their own\r\nlives, and continued to save the property, but the greatest difficulty\r\nwas still ahead, and to continue by water would be the way to certain\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n\"During this distressing scene, we were on the shore looking on and\r\nanxiously concerned; seeing our poor fellows once more safe afforded\r\nus as much satisfaction as to themselves, and we hastened to their\r\nassistance; but their situation rendered our approach perilous and\r\ndifficult. The bank was exceedingly high and steep, and we had to\r\nplunge our daggers at intervals into the ground to check our speed, as\r\notherwise we were exposed to slide into the river. We cut steps in the\r\ndeclivity, fastened a line to the front of the canoe, with which some of\r\nthe men ascended in order to haul it up, while the others supported it\r\nupon their arms. In this manner our situation was most precarious; our\r\nlives hung, as it were, upon a thread, as the failure of the line, or\r\na false step of one of the men, might have hurled the whole of us into\r\neternity. However, we fortunately cleared the bank before dark.\"\r\n\r\nEvery day brought its dangers, and the progress was very slow. Finding\r\nthe navigation impossible, on the 26th Fraser says: \"As for the road\r\nby land, we could scarcely make our way with even only our guns. I\r\nhave been for a long period among the Rocky Mountains, but have never\r\nseen anything like this country. It is so wild that I cannot find\r\nwords to describe our situation at times. We had to pass where no\r\nhuman being should venture; yet in those places there is a regular\r\nfootpath impressed, or rather indented upon the very rocks by frequent\r\ntravelling. Besides this, steps which are formed like a ladder by poles\r\nhanging to one another, crossed at certain distances with twigs, the\r\nwhole suspended from the top, furnish a safe and convenient passage\r\nto the natives down these precipices; but we, who had not had the\r\nadvantage of their education and experience, were often in imminent\r\ndanger, when obliged to follow their example.\"\r\n\r\nOn the right, as the party proceeded along the river, a considerable\r\nstream emptied in, to which they gave the name Shaw's River, from one of\r\nthe principal wintering partners.\r\n\r\nSome distance down, a great river poured in from the left, making\r\nnotable forks. Thinking that likely the other expedition by way of the\r\nSaskatchewan might be on the upper waters of that river at the very\r\ntime, they called it Thompson River, after the worthy astronomer, and it\r\nhas retained the name ever since.\r\n\r\nBut it would be a mistake to think that the difficulties were passed\r\nwhen the forks of the Thompson River were left behind. Travellers on\r\nthe Canadian-Pacific Railway of to-day will remember the great gorge of\r\nthe Fraser, and how the railway going at dizzy heights, and on strong\r\noverhanging ledges of rock, still fills the heart with fear.\r\n\r\nOn July 2nd the party reached an arm of the sea and saw the tide ebbing\r\nand flowing, showing them they were near the ocean. They, however,\r\nfound the Indians at this part very troublesome. Fraser was compelled\r\nto follow the native custom, \"and pretended to be in a violent passion,\r\nspoke loud, with vehement gestures, exactly in their own way, and thus\r\npeace and tranquillity were instantly restored.\"\r\n\r\nThe explorer was, however, greatly disappointed that he had been\r\nprevented by the turbulence of the natives from going down the arm\r\nof the sea and looking out upon the Pacific Ocean. He wished to take\r\nobservations on the sea coast. However, he got the latitude, and knowing\r\nthat the Columbia is 45 deg. 20´ N., he was able to declare that the\r\nriver he had followed was not the Columbia. How difficult it is to\r\ndistinguish small from great actions! Here was a man making fame for all\r\ntime, and the idea of the greatness of his work had not dawned upon him.\r\n\r\nA short delay, and the party turned northward on July 4th, and with many\r\nhardships made their way up the river. On their ascent few things of\r\nnote happened, the only notable event being the recognition of the fame\r\nof the second bourgeois, Jules Quesnel, by giving his name to a river\r\nflowing into the Fraser River from the east. The name is still retained,\r\nand is also given to the lake which marks the enlargement of the river.\r\nOn August 6th, the party rejoined Faries and his men in the fort on\r\nStuart Lake. The descent occupied forty-two days, and, as explorers have\r\noften found in such rivers as the Fraser, the ascent took less time than\r\nthe descent. In this case, their upward journey was but of thirty-three\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nFraser returned to the east in the next year and is found in 1811 in\r\ncharge of the Red River district, two years afterward in command on the\r\nMackenzie River, and at Fort William on Lake Superior, in 1816, when the\r\nFort was taken by Lord Selkirk. After retiring, he lived at St. Andrews\r\non the Ottawa and died at the advanced age of eighty-six, having been\r\nknown as one of the most noted and energetic fur-traders in the history\r\nof the companies.\r\n\r\nThus we have seen the way in which these two kings of adventure--Fraser\r\nand Thompson--a few years after Sir Alexander Mackenzie, succeeded amid\r\nextraordinary hardships in crossing to the Western Sea. The record\r\nof the five transcontinental expeditions of these early times is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n(1) Alexander Mackenzie, by the Tacouche Tesse and Bellacoola River,\r\n1793.\r\n\r\n(2) Lewis and Clark, the American explorers, by the Columbia River, 1805.\r\n\r\n(3) Simon Fraser by the river that bears his name, formerly the Tacouche\r\nTesse, 1808.\r\n\r\n(4) David Thompson, by the Columbia River, 1811.\r\n\r\n(5) The overland party of Astorians, by the Columbia, 1811.\r\n\r\nThese expeditions shed a flood of glory on the Anglo-Saxon name and\r\nfame.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[4] The United Empire Loyalists were those British patriots who left\r\nthe United States after the Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nThe X Y COMPANY.\r\n\r\n     \"Le Marquis\" Simon McTavish unpopular--Alexander Mackenzie his\r\n     rival--Enormous activity of the \"Potties\"--Why called X Y--Five\r\n     rival posts at Souris--Sir Alexander, the silent partner--Old Lion\r\n     of Montreal roused--\"Posts of the King\"--Schooner sent to Hudson\r\n     Bay--Nor'-Westers erect two posts on Hudson Bay--Supreme folly--Old\r\n     and new Nor'-Westers unite--List of partners.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some years the Montreal fur companies, in their combinations and\r\nreadjustments, had all the variety of the kaleidoscope. Agreements were\r\nmade for a term of years, and when these had expired new leagues were\r\nformed, and in every case dissatisfied members went into opposition and\r\nkept up the heat and competition without which it is probable the fur\r\ntrade would have lost, to those engaged in it, many of its charms.\r\n\r\nIn 1795 several partners had retired from the North-West Company\r\nand thrown in their lot with the famous firm that we have seen was\r\nalways inclined to follow its own course--Messrs. Forsyth, Richardson\r\nand Co. For a number of years this independent Montreal firm had\r\nmaintained a trade in the districts about Lake Superior. The cause\r\nof this disruption in the Company was the unpopularity, among the\r\nwintering partners especially, of the strong-willed and domineering\r\nchief in Montreal--Simon McTavish. One set of bourgeois spoke of him\r\nderisively as \"Le Premier,\" while others with mock deference called him\r\n\"Le Marquis.\" Sir Alexander Mackenzie had been himself a partner, had\r\nresided in the Far West, and he was regarded by all the traders in the\r\n\"upper country\" as their friend and advocate. Although the discontent\r\nwas very great when the secession took place, yet the mere bonds of\r\nself-interest kept many within the old Company. Alexander Mackenzie\r\nmost unwillingly consented to remain in the old Company, but only for\r\nthree years, reserving to himself the right to retire at the end of that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding their disappointment, and possibly buoyed up with the\r\nhope of having the assistance of their former friend at a later period,\r\nthe members of the X Y Company girt themselves about for the new\r\nenterprise in the next year, so that the usual date of this Company is\r\nfrom the year 1795. Whether it was the circumstance of its origination\r\nin dislike of \"Le Premier,\" or whether the partners felt the need of\r\ngreater activity on account of their being weaker, it must be confessed\r\nthat a new era now came to the fur trade, and the opposition was carried\r\non with a warmth much greater than had ever been known among the old\r\ncompanies. A casual observer can hardly help feeling that while not a\r\nmember of the new Company at this date, Alexander Mackenzie was probably\r\nits active promoter behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nThe new opposition developed without delay. Striking at all the salient\r\npoints, the new Company in 1797 erected its trading house at Grand\r\nPortage, somewhat more than half-a-mile from the North-West trading\r\nhouse and on the other side of the small stream that there falls into\r\nthe Bay. A few years after, when the North-West Company moved to\r\nKaministiquia, the X Y also erected a building within a mile of the new\r\nfort. The new Company was at some time in its history known as the New\r\nNorth-West Company, but was more commonly called the X Y Company. The\r\norigin of this name is accounted for as follows. On the bales which\r\nwere made up for transport, it was the custom to mark the North-West\r\nCompany's initials N.W. When the new Company, which was an offshoot\r\nof the old, wished to mark their bales, they simply employed the next\r\nletters of the alphabet, X Y. They are accordingly not contractions,\r\nand should not be written as such. It was the habit of members of\r\nthe older Company to express their contempt for the secessionists by\r\ncalling them the \"Little Company\" or \"the Little Society.\" In the\r\nAthabasca country the rebellious traders were called by their opponents\r\n\"Potties,\" probably a corruption of \"Les Petits,\" meaning members of \"La\r\nPetite Compagnie.\" When these names were used by the French Canadian\r\nvoyageurs, the X Y Company was referred to.\r\n\r\nHowever disrespectfully they may have been addressed, the traders of\r\nthe new Company caused great anxiety both to the North-West Company and\r\nto the Hudson's Bay Company, though they regarded themselves chiefly\r\nas rivals of the former. Pushing out into the country nearest their\r\nbase of supplies on Lake Superior, they took hold of the Red River and\r\nAssiniboine region, as well as of the Red Lake country immediately south\r\nof and connected with it. The point where the Souris empties into the\r\nAssiniboine was occupied in the same year (1798) by the X Y Company.\r\nIt had been a favourite resort for all classes of fur-traders, there\r\nhaving been no less than five opposing trading houses at this point four\r\nyears before. No doubt the presence of the free-trading element such as\r\nMcCracken and Jussaume, whom we find in the Souris region thus early,\r\nmade it easier for smaller concerns to carry on a kind of business in\r\nwhich the great North-West Company would not care to be engaged.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile dissension prevailed in the North-West Company. The\r\nsmouldering feeling of dislike between \"Le Marquis\" and Alexander\r\nMackenzie and the other fur-trading magnates broke out into a flame.\r\nAs ex-Governor Masson says: \"These three years were an uninterrupted\r\nsuccession of troubles, differences, and misunderstandings between these\r\ntwo opposing leaders.\" At the great gathering at the Grand Portage in\r\n1799, Alexander Mackenzie warned the partners that he was about to\r\nquit the Company, and though the winterers begged him not to carry out\r\nhis threat, yet he remained inexorable. The discussion reported to\r\nMr. McTavish was very displeasing to him, and in the following year\r\nhis usual letter to the gathering written from Montreal was curt and\r\nshowed much feeling, he saying, \"I feel hurt at the distrust and want of\r\nconfidence that appeared throughout all your deliberations last season.\"\r\n\r\nAlexander Mackenzie, immediately after the scene at Grand Portage,\r\ncrossed over to England, published his \"Voyages,\" and received his\r\ntitle. He then returned in 1801 to Canada. Flushed with the thought of\r\nhis successes, he threw himself with great energy into the affairs of\r\nthe opposing Company, the X Y, or, as it was also now called, that\r\nof \"Sir Alexander Mackenzie and Company.\" If the competition had been\r\nwarm before, it now rose to fever heat. The brigandage had scarcely any\r\nlimit; combats of clerk with clerk, trapper with trapper, voyageur with\r\nvoyageur, were common. Strong drink became, as never before or since, a\r\nchief instrument of the rival companies in dealing with the Indians.\r\n\r\nA North-West Company trader, writing from Pembina, says: \"Indians daily\r\ncoming in by small parties; nearly 100 men here. I gave them fifteen\r\nkegs of mixed liquor, and the X Y gave in proportion; all drinking; I\r\nquarrelled with Little Shell, and dragged him out of the fort by the\r\nhair. Indians very troublesome, threatening to level my fort to the\r\nground, and their chief making mischief. I had two narrow escapes from\r\nbeing stabbed by him; once in the hall and soon afterwards in the shop.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the troubles of competition between the Companies. The new\r\nCompany made a determined effort to compete also in the far-distant\r\nPeace River district. In October of this year two prominent partners of\r\nthe new Company arrived with their following at the Peace River. One\r\nof these, Pierre de Rocheblave, was of a distinguished family, being\r\nthe nephew of a French officer who had fought on the _Monongahela_\r\nagainst Braddock. The other was James Leith, who also became a prominent\r\nfur-trader in later days.\r\n\r\nIllustrating the keenness of the trade conflict, John McDonald, of\r\nGarth, also says in 1798, writing from the Upper Saskatchewan, \"We had\r\nhere (Fort Augustus), besides the Hudson's Bay Company, whose fort was\r\nwithin a musket shot of ours, the opposition on the other side of the\r\nnew concern I have already mentioned, which had assumed a powerful shape\r\nunder the name of the X Y Company, at the head of which was the late\r\nJohn Ogilvy in Montreal, and at this establishment Mr. King, an old\r\nsouth trader in his prime and pride as the first among bullies.\"\r\n\r\nSir Alexander Mackenzie did wonders in the management of his Company,\r\nbut the old lion at Montreal, from his mountain château, showed a\r\nremarkable determination, and provided as he was with great wealth,\r\nhe resolved to overcome at any price the opposition which he also\r\ncontemptuously called the \"Little Company.\" In 1802, he, with the skill\r\nof a great general, reconstructed his Company. He formed a combination\r\nwhich was to continue for twenty years. Into this he succeeded in\r\nintroducing a certain amount of new blood; those clerks who had shown\r\nability were promoted to the position of bourgeois or partners. By this\r\nprogressive and statesmanlike policy, notwithstanding the energy of the\r\nX Y Company, the old Company showed all the vigour and enthusiasm of\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nAn employé of the North-West Company, Livingston, had a few years before\r\nestablished a post on Slave Lake. Animated with the new spirit of his\r\nsuperiors, he went further north still and made a discovery of silver,\r\nbut on undertaking to open trade communications with the Eskimos, the\r\ntrader unfortunately lost his life.\r\n\r\nOther expeditions were sent to the Missouri and to the sources of the\r\nSouth Saskatchewan; it is even said that in this direction a post was\r\nestablished among the fierce tribes of the Bow River, west of the\r\npresent town of Calgary.\r\n\r\nLooking out for other avenues for the wonderful store of energy in the\r\nNorth-West Company, the partners took into consideration the development\r\nof the vast fisheries of the St. Lawrence and the interior. Simon\r\nMcTavish rented the old posts of the King--meaning by these Tadoussac,\r\nChicoutimi, Assuapmousoin, and Mistassini, reached by way of the\r\nSaguenay; and Ile Jérémie, Godbout, Mingan, Masquaro, and several others\r\nalong the north shore of the Lower St. Lawrence or the Gulf. The annual\r\nrent paid for the Kings posts was 1000_l._\r\n\r\nBut the greatest flight of the old fur king's ambition was to carry\r\nhis operations into the forbidden country of the Hudson Bay itself.\r\nIn furtherance of this policy, in 1803 the North-West Company sent\r\na schooner of 150 tons to the shores of Hudson Bay to trade, and\r\nalong with this an expedition was sent by land by way of St. John and\r\nMistassini to co-operate in establishing stations on the Bay. By this\r\nmovement two posts were founded, one at Charlton Island and the other at\r\nthe mouth of the Moose River. Many of the partners were not in favour\r\nof these expeditions planned by the strong-headed old dictator, and the\r\nventure proved a financial loss. Simon McTavish, though comparatively\r\na young man, now thought of retiring, and purchased the seigniory of\r\nTerrebonne, proposing there to lead a life of luxury and ease, but a\r\nstronger enemy than either the X Y or Hudson's Bay Company came to break\r\nup his plans. Death summoned him away in July, 1804.\r\n\r\nThe death of Simon McTavish removed all obstacles to union between the\r\nold and new North-West Companies, and propositions were soon made to Sir\r\nAlexander Mackenzie, and his friends, which resulted in a union of the\r\ntwo Companies. We are fortunate in having preserved to us the agreement\r\nby which the two Companies--old and new North-West Companies--were\r\nunited. The partners of the old Company were given three-quarters of\r\nthe stock and those of the new one-quarter. The provisions of the\r\nagreement are numerous, but chiefly deal with necessary administration.\r\nOne important clause is to the effect that no business other than the\r\nfur trade, or what is necessarily depending thereon, shall be followed\r\nby the Company. No partner of the new concern is to be allowed to have\r\nany private interests at the posts outside those of the Company. By\r\none clause the new North-West Company is protected from any expense\r\nthat might arise from Simon McTavish's immense venture on the Hudson\r\nBay. It may be interesting to give the names of the partners of the two\r\nCompanies, those who were not present, from being mostly in the interior\r\nand whose names were signed by those having powers of attorney from\r\nthem, being marked Att.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NORTH-WEST OR X Y COMPANY.\r\n\r\n  Alex.

These names represent likewise those who carried\r\non that wearisome and disastrous conflict with the Hudson's Bay Company\r\nwhich in time would have ruined both Companies but for the happy union\r\nwhich took place, when the resources of each were well-nigh exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE LORDS OF THE LAKES AND FORESTS.--I.\r\n\r\n     New route to Kaministiquia--Vivid sketch of Fort\r\n     William--\"Cantine Salope\"--Lively Christmas week--The feasting\r\n     partners--Ex-Governor Masson's good work--Four great Mackenzies--A\r\n     literary bourgeois--Three handsome demoiselles--\"The man in the\r\n     moon\"--Story of \"Bras Croche\"--Around Cape Horn--Astoria taken\r\n     over--A hot-headed trader--Sad case of \"Little Labrie\"--Punch on\r\n     New Year's Day--The heart of a \"Vacher.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe union of the opposing companies from Montreal led to a great\r\ndevelopment of trade, and, as we have already seen, to important schemes\r\nof exploration.\r\n\r\nRoderick McKenzie, the cousin of Sir Alexander, in coming down from\r\nRainy Lake to Grand Portage, heard of a new route to Kaministiquia.\r\nWe have already seen that Umfreville had found out a circuitous\r\npassage from Nepigon to Winnipeg River, but this had been considered\r\nimpracticable by the fur-traders.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when the treaty of amity and commerce made it certain that\r\nGrand Portage had to be given up, it was regarded as a great matter\r\nwhen the route to Kaministiquia became known. This was discovered by\r\nMr. Roderick McKenzie quite by accident. When coming, in 1797, to\r\nCanada on leave of absence, this trader was told by an Indian family\r\nnear Rainy Lake that a little farther north there was a good route for\r\nlarge canoes, which was formerly used by the whites in their trading\r\nexpeditions. Taking an Indian with him, McKenzie followed this course,\r\nwhich brought him out at the mouth of the Kaministiquia. This proved to\r\nbe the old French route, for all along it traces were found of their\r\nformer establishments. Strange that a route at one time so well known\r\nshould be completely forgotten in forty years.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1800 the North-West Company built a fort, called the New\r\nFort, at the mouth of the Kaministiquia, and, abandoning Grand Portage,\r\nmoved their headquarters to this point in 1803. In the year after the\r\nunion of the North-West and X Y Companies the name Fort William was\r\ngiven to this establishment, in honour of the Hon. William McGillivray,\r\nwho had become the person of greatest distinction in the united\r\nNorth-West Company.\r\n\r\nAs giving us a glimpse of the life of \"the lords of the lakes and\r\nforests,\" which was led at Fort William, we have a good sketch written\r\nby a trader, Gabriel Franchère, who was a French Canadian of respectable\r\nfamily and began life in a business place in Montreal. At this stage,\r\nsays a local writer, \"the fur trade was at its apogee,\" and Franchère\r\nwas engaged by the Astor Company and went to Astoria. Returning over the\r\nmountains, he passed Fort William. His book, written in French, has been\r\ntranslated into English, and is creditable to the writer, who died as\r\nlate as 1856 in St. Paul, Minnesota.\r\n\r\nFranchère says of Fort William, rather inaccurately, that it was built\r\nin 1805. This lively writer was much impressed by the trade carried on\r\nat this point, and gives the following vivid description:--\r\n\r\n\"Fort William has really the appearance of a fort from the palisade\r\nfifteen feet high, and also that of a pretty village from the number of\r\nbuildings it encloses. In the middle of a spacious square stands a large\r\nbuilding, elegantly built, though of wood, the middle door of which is\r\nraised five feet above the ground plot, and in the front of which runs\r\na long gallery. In the centre of this building is a room about sixty\r\nfeet long and thirty wide, decorated with several paintings, and some\r\nportraits in crayon of a number of the partners of the Company. It is in\r\nthis room that the agents, the clerks, and the interpreters take their\r\nmeals at different tables. At each extremity of the room are two small\r\napartments for the partners.\"\r\n\r\n\"The back part of the house is occupied by the kitchen and sleeping\r\napartments of the domestics. On each side of this building there is\r\nanother of the same size, but lower; these are divided lengthwise by a\r\ncorridor, and contain each twelve pretty sleeping-rooms. One of these\r\nhouses is intended for the partners, the other for the clerks.\r\n\r\n\"On the east side of the Fort there is another house intended for the\r\nsame purpose, and a large building in which furs are examined and where\r\nthey are put up in tight bales by means of a press. Behind, and still on\r\nthe same side, are found the lodges of the guides, another building for\r\nfurs, and a powder magazine. This last building is of grey stone, and\r\nroofed in with tin. In the corner stands a kind of bastion or point of\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n\"On the west side is seen a range of buildings, some of which serve\r\nfor stores and others for shops. There is one for dressing out the\r\nemployés; one for fitting out canoes; one in which merchandise is\r\nretailed; another where strong drink, bread, lard, butter, and cheese\r\nare sold, and where refreshments are given out to arriving voyageurs.\r\nThis refreshment consists of a white loaf, a half pound of butter, and a\r\nquart of rum. The voyageurs give to this liquor store the name 'Cantine\r\nSalope.'\r\n\r\n\"Behind is found still another row of buildings, one of which is used\r\nas an office or counting-house, a pretty square building well lighted;\r\nanother serves as a store; and a third as a prison. The voyageurs give\r\nto the last the name 'Pot au beurre.' At the south-east corner is a\r\nstone shed roofed with tin. Farther back are the workshops of the\r\ncarpenters, tinsmiths, blacksmiths, and their spacious courts or sheds\r\nfor sheltering the canoes, repairing them, and constructing new ones.\r\n\r\n\"Near the gate of the Fort, which is to the south, are the\r\ndwelling-houses of the surgeon and resident clerk. Over the entrance\r\ngate a kind of guard-house has been built. As the river is deep enough\r\nat its entrance, the Company has had quays built along the Fort as a\r\nlanding-place for the schooners kept on Lake Superior for transporting\r\npeltries, merchandise, and provisions from Fort William to Sault Ste.\r\nMarie, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\n\"There are also on the other side of the river a number of houses, all\r\ninhabited by old French-Canadian voyageurs, worn out in the service of\r\nthe North-West Company, without having become richer by it. Fort William\r\nis the principal factory of the North-West Company in the interior and\r\na general rendezvous of the partners. The agents of Montreal and the\r\nproprietors wintering in the north nearly all assemble here every summer\r\nand receive the returns, form expeditions, and discuss the interests of\r\ntheir commerce.\r\n\r\n\"The employés wintering in the north spend also a portion of the summer\r\nat Fort William. They form a great encampment to the west, outside\r\nthe palisades. Those who are only engaged at Montreal to go to Fort\r\nWilliam or to Rainy Lake, and who do not winter in the North, occupy\r\nanother space on the east side. The former give to the latter the name\r\n'mangeurs de lard.' A remarkable difference is observed between the two\r\ncamps, which are composed of three or four hundred men each. That of the\r\n'mangeurs de lard' is always very dirty and that of the winterers neat\r\nand clean.\"\r\n\r\nBut the fur-traders were by no means merely business men. Perhaps never\r\nwere there assemblages of men who feasted more heartily when the work\r\nwas done. The Christmas week was a holiday, and sometimes the jollity\r\nwent to a considerable excess, which was entirely to be expected when\r\nthe hard life of the voyage was taken into consideration. Whether at\r\nFort William, or in the North-West Company's house in St. Gabriel\r\nStreet, Montreal, or in later day at Lachine, the festive gatherings\r\nof the Nor'-Westers were characterized by extravagance and often by\r\nhilarious mirth. The luxuries of the East and West were gathered for\r\nthese occasions, and offerings to Bacchus were neither of poor quality\r\nnor limited in extent. With Scotch story and Jacobite song, intermingled\r\nwith \"La Claire Fontaine\" or \"Malbrouck s'en va,\" those lively songs of\r\nFrench Canada, the hours of evening and night passed merrily away.\r\n\r\nAt times when they had been feasting long into the morning, the traders\r\nand clerks would sit down upon the feast-room floor, when one would\r\ntake the tongs, another the shovel, another the poker, and so on.\r\nThey would arrange themselves in regular order, as in a boat, and,\r\nvigorously rowing, sing a song of the voyage; and loud and long till\r\nthe early streaks of the east were seen would the rout continue. When\r\nthe merriment reached such a height as this, ceremony was relaxed, and\r\nvoyageurs, servants, and attendants were admitted to witness the wild\r\ncarouse of the wine-heated partners.\r\n\r\nWe are fortunate in having the daily life of the fur-traders from the\r\nLower St. Lawrence to the very shores of the Pacific Ocean pictured for\r\nus by the partners in the \"Journals\" they have left behind them. Just as\r\nthe daily records of the monks and others, dreary and uninteresting as\r\nmany of them at times are, commemorated the events of their time in the\r\n\"Saxon Chronicle\" and gave the material for history, so the journals of\r\nthe bourgeois, often left unpublished for a generation or two, and the\r\nworks of some of those who had influence and literary ability enough to\r\nissue their stories in the form of books, supply us with the material\r\nfor reproducing their times. From such sources we intend to give a few\r\nsketches of the life of that time.\r\n\r\nWe desire to express the greatest appreciation of the work of\r\nex-Governor Masson, who is related to the McKenzie and Chaboillez\r\nfamilies of that period, and who has published no less than fourteen\r\njournals, sketches of the time; of the painstaking writing of an\r\nAmerican officer, Dr. Coues, who has with great care and success edited\r\nthe journals of Alexander Henry, Jr., and such remains as he could\r\nobtain of David Thompson, thus supplementing the publication by Charles\r\nLindsey, of Toronto, of an account of Thompson. We acknowledge also the\r\npatient collection of material by Tassé in his \"Canadiens de L'Ouest,\"\r\nas well as the interesting journals of Harmon and others, which have\r\ndone us good service.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUABLE REMINISCENCES.\r\n\r\nThe name of McKenzie (Hon. Roderick McKenzie) was one to conjure by\r\namong the fur-traders. From the fact that there were so many well-known\r\npartners and clerks of this name arose the custom, very common in the\r\nHighland communities, of giving nicknames to distinguish them. Four of\r\nthe McKenzies were \"Le Rouge,\" \"Le Blanc,\" \"Le Borgne\" (one-eyed), and\r\n\"Le Picoté\" (pock-marked). Sir Alexander was the most notable, and after\r\nhim his cousin, the Hon. Roderick, of whom we write.\r\n\r\nThis distinguished man came out as a Highland laddie from Scotland\r\nin 1784. He at once entered the service of the fur company, and made\r\nhis first journey to the North-West in the next year. His voyage from\r\nSte. Anne, on Montreal Island, up the fur-traders' route, was taken in\r\nGregory McLeod & Co.'s service. At Grand Portage McKenzie was initiated\r\ninto the mysteries of the partners. Pushed into the North-West, he soon\r\nbecame prominent, and built the most notable post of the upper country,\r\nFort Chipewyan.\r\n\r\nOn his marriage he became allied to a number of the magnates of the\r\nfur company. His wife belonged to the popular family of Chaboillez,\r\ntwo other daughters of which were married, one to the well-known\r\nSurveyor-General of Lower Canada, Joseph Bouchette, and another to Simon\r\nMcTavish, \"Le Marquis.\"\r\n\r\nRoderick McKenzie was a man of some literary ability and taste. He\r\nproposed at one time writing a history of the Indians of the North-West\r\nand also of the North-West Company. In order to do this, he sent\r\ncirculars to leading traders, and thus receiving a number of journals,\r\nlaid the foundation of the literary store from which ex-Governor Masson\r\nprepared his book on the bourgeois.\r\n\r\nBetween him and his cousin, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, an extensive\r\ncorrespondence was kept up. Extracts from the letters of the\r\ndistinguished partner form the burden of the \"Reminiscences\" published\r\nby Masson. Many of the facts have been referred to in our sketch of Sir\r\nAlexander Mackenzie's voyages.\r\n\r\nFor eight long years Roderick McKenzie remained in the Indian country,\r\nand came to Canada in 1797. Some two years afterward Sir Alexander\r\nMackenzie left the old Company and headed the X Y Company. At that\r\ntime Roderick McKenzie was chosen in the place of his cousin in the\r\nNorth-West Company, and this for several years caused a coolness between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHis \"Reminiscences\" extend to 1829, at which time he was living in\r\nTerrebonne, in Lower Canada. He became a member of the Legislative\r\nCouncil in Lower Canada, and he has a number of distinguished\r\ndescendants. Roderick McKenzie closes his interesting \"Reminiscences\"\r\nwith an elaborate and valuable list of the proprietors, clerks,\r\ninterpreters, &c., of the North-West Company in 1799, giving their\r\ndistribution in the departments, and the salary paid each. It gives us a\r\npicture of the magnitude of the operations of the North-West Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nTALES OF THE NORTH-WEST.\r\n\r\nFew of the Nor'-Westers aimed at collecting and preserving the folk-lore\r\nof the natives. At the request of Roderick McKenzie, George Keith,\r\na bourgeois who spent a great part of his life very far North, viz.\r\nin the regions of Athabasca, Mackenzie River, and Great Bear Lake,\r\nsent a series of letters extending from 1807 onward for ten years\r\nembodying tales, descriptions, and the history of the Indian tribes\r\nof his district. His first description is that of the Beaver Indians,\r\nof whom he gives a vocabulary. He writes for us a number of tales of\r\nthe Beaver Indians, viz. \"The Indian Hercules,\" \"Two Lost Women,\" \"The\r\nFlood, a Tale of the Mackenzie River,\" and \"The Man in the Moon.\" One\r\nletter gives a good account of the social manners and customs of the\r\nBeaver Indians, and another a somewhat complete description of the\r\nRocky Mountains and Mackenzie River country. Descriptions of the Filthy\r\nLake and Grand River Indians and the Long Arrowed Indians, with a few\r\nmore letters with reference to the fur trade, make up the interesting\r\ncollection. George Keith may be said to have wielded the \"pen of a ready\r\nwriter.\" We give his story of\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAN IN THE MOON.\r\n\r\n_A Tale, or Tradition, of the Beaver Indians._\r\n\r\n\"In the primitive ages of the world, there was a man and his wife who\r\nhad no children. The former was very singular in his manner of living.\r\nBeing an excellent hunter, he lived entirely upon the blood of the\r\nanimals he killed. This circumstance displeased his wife, who secretly\r\ndetermined to play him a trick. Accordingly one day the husband went\r\nout hunting, and left orders with his wife to boil some blood in a\r\nkettle, so as to be ready for supper on his return. When the time of his\r\nexpected return was drawing nigh, his wife pierced a vein with an awl\r\nin her left arm and drew a copious quantity of blood, which she mixed\r\nwith a greater quantity of the blood of a moose deer, that he should not\r\ndiscover it, and prepared the whole for her husband's supper.\r\n\r\n\"Upon his return the blood was served up to him on a bark dish; but,\r\nupon putting a spoonful to his mouth, he detected the malice of his\r\nwife, and only saying that the blood did not smell good, threw the\r\nkettle with the contents about her ears.\r\n\r\n\"Night coming on, the man went to bed and told his wife to observe\r\nthe moon about midnight. After the first nap, the woman, awaking, was\r\nsurprised to find that her husband was absent. She arose and made a\r\nfire, and, lifting up her eyes to the moon, was astonished to see her\r\nhusband, with his dog and kettle, in the body of the moon, from which he\r\nhas never descended. She bitterly lamented her misfortunes during the\r\nrest of her days, always attributing them to her malicious invention of\r\npreparing her own blood for her husband's supper.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERESTING AUTOBIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nAmong all the Nor'-Westers there was no one who had more of the Scottish\r\npride of family than John McDonald, of Garth, claiming as he did to\r\nbe descended from the lord of the isles. His father obtained him a\r\ncommission in the British army, but he could not pass the examination on\r\naccount of a blemish caused by an accident to his arm. The sobriquet,\r\n\"Bras Croche\" clung to him all his life as a fur trader.\r\n\r\nCommended to Simon McTavish, the young man became his favourite, and in\r\n1791 started for the fur country. He was placed under the experienced\r\ntrader, Angus Shaw, and passed his first winter in the far-off Beaver\r\nRiver, north of the Saskatchewan. Next winter he visited the Grand\r\nPortage, and he tells us that for a couple of weeks he was feasting\r\non the best of everything and the best of fish. Returning to the\r\nSaskatchewan, he took part in the building of Fort George on that river,\r\nwhence, after wintering, the usual summer journey was made to Grand\r\nPortage. Here, he tells us, they \"met the gentlemen from Montreal in\r\ngoodfellowship.\" This life continued till 1795.\r\n\r\nHe shows us the state of feeling between the Companies. \"It may not be\r\nout of the way to mention that on New Year's Day, during the customary\r\nfiring of musketry, one of our opponent's bullies purposely fired his\r\npowder through my window. I, of course, got enraged, and challenged him\r\nto single combat with our guns; this was a check upon him ever after.\"\r\n\r\nRemaining in the same district, by the year 1800 he had, backed as he\r\nwas by powerful influence, his sister being married to Hon. William\r\nMacGillivray, become a partner in the Company. Two years afterward he\r\nspeaks of old Cuthbert Grant coming to the district, but in the spring,\r\nthis officer being sick, McDonald fitted up a comfortable boat with an\r\nawning, in which Grant went to the Kaministiquia, where he died.\r\n\r\nIn 1802, McDonald returned from Fort William and determined to build\r\nanother fort farther up the river to meet a new tribe, the Kootenays.\r\nThis was \"Rocky Mountain House.\" Visiting Scotland in the year after,\r\nhe returned to be dispatched in 1804 to English River, where he\r\nwas in competition with a Hudson's Bay Company trader. In the next\r\nyear he went back to the Saskatchewan, saying that, although a very\r\ndangerous department, he preferred it. Going up the south branch of the\r\nSaskatchewan, he erected the \"New Chesterfield House\" at the mouth of\r\nthe Red Deer River, and there met again a detachment of Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany people.\r\n\r\nIn 1806 he, being unwell, spent the year chiefly in Montreal, after\r\nwhich he was appointed to the less exacting field of Red River. One\r\ninteresting note is given us as to the Red River forts. He says, \"I\r\nestablished a fort at the junction of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers and\r\ncalled it 'Gibraltar,' though there was not a rock or a stone within\r\nthree miles.\" As we shall see afterwards, the building of this fort,\r\nwhich was on the site of the city of Winnipeg, had taken place in the\r\nyear preceding.\r\n\r\nWith his customary energy in erecting forts, he built one a distance\r\nup the Qu'Appelle River, probably Fort Espérance. While down at Fort\r\nWilliam in the spring, the news came to him that David Thompson was\r\nsurrounded in the Rocky Mountains by Blackfoot war parties. McDonald\r\nvolunteered to go to the rescue, and with thirty chosen men, after many\r\ndangers and hardships, reached Thompson in the land of the Kootenays.\r\n\r\nMcDonald was one of the traders selected to go to Britain and thence by\r\nthe ship _Isaac Todd_ to the mouth of the Columbia to meet the Astor Fur\r\nCompany. He started in company with Hon. Edward Ellice. At Rio Janeiro\r\nMcDonald shipped from the _Isaac Todd_ on board the frigate _Phoebe_. On\r\nthe west coast of South America they called at \"Juan Fernandez, Robinson\r\nCrusoe's Island.\" They reached the Columbia on November 30th, 1813, and\r\nin company with trader McDougall took over Astoria in King George's\r\nname, McDonald becoming senior partner at Astoria.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1814, McDonald left for home across the mountains, by way of\r\nthe Saskatchewan, and in due time arrived at Fort William. He came to\r\nSault Ste. Marie to find the fort built by the Americans, and reached\r\nMontreal amid some dangers. The last adventure mentioned in his journal\r\nwas that of meeting in Terrebonne Lord Selkirk's party who were going to\r\nthe North-West to oppose the Nor'-Westers.\r\n\r\nThe veteran spent his last days in the County of Glengarry, Ontario, and\r\ndied in 1860, between eighty-nine and ninety years of age. His career\r\nhad been a most romantic one, and he was noted for his high spirit and\r\ncourage, as well as for his ceaseless energy as a trader.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO JOURNALS AND A DESCRIPTION.\r\n\r\nJames McKenzie, brother of Hon. Roderick McKenzie, was a graphic, though\r\nsomewhat irritable writer with a good style. He has left us \"A Journal\r\nfrom the Athabasca Country,\" a description of the King's posts on the\r\nLower St. Lawrence, with a journal of a jaunt through the King's posts.\r\nThis fur trader joined the North-West Company.\r\n\r\nIn 1799 he was at Fort Chipewyan. His descriptions are minute accounts\r\nof his doings at his fort. He seems to have taken much interest in\r\nhis men, and he gives a pathetic account of one of these trappers\r\ncalled \"Little Labrie.\" Labrie had been for six days without food, and\r\nwas almost frozen to death. He says: \"Little Labrie's feet are still\r\nsoaking in cold water, but retain their hardness. We watched him\r\nall last night; he fainted often in the course of the night, but we\r\nalways brought him to life again by the help of mulled wine. Once in\r\nparticular, when he found himself very weak and sick, and thought he\r\nwas dying he said, 'Adieu; je m'en vais; tout mon bien à ceux qui ont\r\nsoin de moi.' 10th, about twelve o'clock, Labrie was freed from all his\r\nagonies in this world.\" McKenzie evidently had a kind heart.\r\n\r\nThe candid writer gives us a picture of New Year's Day, January 1st,\r\n1890. \"This morning before daybreak, the men, according to custom,\r\nfired two broadsides in honour of the New Year, and then came in to\r\nbe rewarded with rum, as usual. Some of them could hardly stand alone\r\nbefore they went away; such was the effect of the juice of the grape\r\non their brains. After dinner, at which everyone helped themselves so\r\nplentifully that nothing remained to the dogs, they had a bowl of punch.\r\nThe expenses of this day, with fourteen men and women, are: 61-1/2\r\nfathoms Spencer twist (tobacco), 7 flagons rum, 1 ditto wine, 1 ham, a\r\nskin's worth of dried meat, about 40 white fish, flour, sugar, &c.\"\r\n\r\nMcKenzie had many altercations in his trade, and seems to have been\r\nof a violent temper. He found fault with one of the X Y people, named\r\nPerroue, saying it was a shame for him to call those who came from\r\nScotland \"vachers\" (cow-boys). He said he did not call all, but a few of\r\nthem \"vachers.\" \"I desired him to name one in the North, and told him\r\nthat the one who served him as a clerk was a 'vacher,' and had the heart\r\nof a 'vacher' since he remained with him.\"\r\n\r\nMcKenzie has frequent accounts of drunken brawls, from which it is\r\neasy to be seen that this period of the opposition of the two Montreal\r\nCompanies was one of the most dissolute in the history of the fur\r\ntraders. The fur trader's violent temper often broke out against\r\nemployés and Indians alike. He had an ungovernable dislike to the\r\nIndians, regarding them simply as the off-scourings of all things, and\r\nfor the voyageurs and workmen of his own Company the denunciations are\r\nso strong that his violent language was regarded as \"sound and fury,\r\nsignifying nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE LORDS OF THE LAKES AND FORESTS.--II.\r\n\r\n     Harmon and his book--An honest man--\"Straight as an\r\n     arrow\"--New views--An uncouth giant--\"Gaelic, English, French, and\r\n     Indian oaths\"--McDonnell, \"Le Prêtre\"--St. Andrew's Day--\"Fathoms\r\n     of tobacco\"--Down the Assiniboine--An entertaining journal--A good\r\n     editor--A too frank trader--\"Gun fired ten yards away\"--Herds of\r\n     buffalo--Packs and pemmican--\"The fourth Gospel\"--Drowning of\r\n     Henry--\"The weather cleared up\"--Lost for forty days--\"Cheepe,\"\r\n     the corpse--Larocque and the Mandans--McKenzie and his half-breed\r\n     children.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GOOD TRADER AND A GOOD BOOK.\r\n\r\nTo those interested in the period we are describing there is not a more\r\nattractive character than Daniel Williams Harmon, a native of Vermont,\r\nwho entered the North-West Company's service in the year 1800, at the\r\nage of 22. After a number of years spent in the far West, he brought\r\nwith him on a visit to New England the journal of his adventures, and\r\nthis was edited and published by a Puritan minister, Daniel Haskel, of\r\nAndover, Massachusetts. Harmon and the book are both somewhat striking,\r\nthough possibly neither would draw forth universal admiration. The\r\nyoungest of his daughters was well known as a prominent citizen of\r\nOttawa, and had a marked reverence for the memory of her father.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DANIEL WILLIAM HARMON, ESQ.]\r\n\r\nLeaving Lachine in the service of McTavish, Frobisher & Co., the young\r\nfur trader followed the usual route up the Ottawa and reached in due\r\ncourse Grand Portage, which he called \"the general rendezvous for the\r\nfur traders.\" He thus describes the fort: \"It is twenty-four rods by\r\nthirty, is built on the margin of the Bay, at the foot of a hill or\r\nmountain of considerable height. Within the fort there is a considerable\r\nnumber of dwelling-houses, shops, and stores; the houses are surrounded\r\nby palisades, which are about eighteen inches in diameter. The other\r\nfort, which stands about 200 rods from this, belongs to the X Y Company.\r\nIt is only three years since they made an establishment here, and as yet\r\nthey have had but little success.\" Harmon was appointed to follow John\r\nMcDonald, of Garth, to the Upper Saskatchewan. On the way out, however,\r\nHarmon was ordered to the Swan River district. Here he remained for four\r\nyears taking a lively interest in all the parts of a trader's life. He\r\nwas much on the Assiniboine, and passed the sites of Brandon, Portage la\r\nPrairie, and Winnipeg of to-day.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1805, Harmon, having gone to the Saskatchewan, took as what\r\nwas called his \"country wife\" a French Canadian half-breed girl, aged\r\nfourteen. He states that it was the custom of the country for the trader\r\nto take a wife from the natives, live with her in the country, and then,\r\non leaving the country, place her and her children under the care of\r\nan honest man and give a certain amount for her support. As a matter\r\nof fact, Harmon, years after, on leaving the country, took his native\r\nspouse with him, and on Lake Champlain some of his younger children were\r\nborn. There were fourteen children born to him, and his North-West wife\r\nwas to her last days a handsome woman, \"as straight as an arrow.\"\r\n\r\nDuring Harmon's time Athabasca had not only the X Y Company, but also\r\na number of forts of the Hudson's Bay Company. Cumberland House was\r\nthe next place of residence of the fur trader, and at this point the\r\nHudson's Bay Company house was in charge of Peter Fidler. Harmon's\r\njournal continues with most interesting details of the fur trade, which\r\nhave the charm of liveliness and novelty. Allusions are constantly made\r\nto the leading traders, McDonald, Fraser, Thompson, Quesnel, Stuart,\r\nand others known to us in our researches. In the course of time (1810)\r\nHarmon found his way over the Rocky Mountain portage and pursued the\r\nfur trade in McLeod Lake Fort and Stuart's Lake in New Caledonia, and\r\nhere we find a fort called, after him, Harmon's Fort. His description\r\nof the Indians is always graphic, giving many striking customs of the\r\naborigines. About the end of 1813 Harmon's journal is taken up with\r\nserious religious reflections. He had been troubled with doubts as to\r\nthe reality of Christianity. But after reading the Scriptures and such\r\nbooks as he could obtain, he tells us that a new view of things was his,\r\nand that his future life became more consistent and useful. He records\r\nus a series of the resolutions which he adopted, and they certainly\r\nindicate a high ideal on his part.\r\n\r\nIn 1816 he had really become habituated to the upper country. He gives\r\nus a glimpse of his family:--\r\n\r\n\"I now pass a short time every day, very pleasantly, in teaching my\r\nlittle daughter Polly to read and spell words in the English language,\r\nin which she makes good progress, though she knows not the meaning\r\nof one of them. In conversing with my children I use entirely the\r\nCree Indian language; with their mother I more frequently employ the\r\nFrench. Her native tongue, however, is more familiar to her, which\r\nis the reason why our children have been taught to speak that in\r\npreference to the French language.\" In his journal, which at times\r\nfully shows his introspections, he gives an account of the struggle in\r\nhis own mind about leaving his wife in the country, as was the custom\r\nof too many of the clerks and partners. He had instructed her in the\r\nprinciples of Christianity, and by these principles he was bound to her\r\nfor life. After eight and a half years spent on the west side of the\r\nRocky Mountains, Harmon arrived at Fort William, 1819, having made a\r\njourney of three thousand miles from his far-away post in New Caledonia.\r\nMontreal was soon after reached, and the Journal comes to a close.\r\n\r\n\r\nA BUSY BOURGEOIS.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the energy and ability displayed by John McDonald, of\r\nGarth, known as \"Le Bras Croch.\" Another trader, John McDonald, is\r\ndescribed by Ross Cox, who spent his life largely in the Rocky Mountain\r\nregion. He was known as McDonald Grand. \"He was 6 ft. 4 in. in height,\r\nwith broad shoulders, large bushy whiskers, and red hair, which he\r\nallowed to grow for years without the use of scissors, and which\r\nsometimes, falling over his face and shoulders, gave to his countenance\r\na wild and uncouth appearance.\" He had a most uncontrollable temper, and\r\nin his rage would indulge in a wild medley of Gaelic, English, French,\r\nand Indian oaths.\r\n\r\nBut a third John McDonnell was found among the fur traders. He was a\r\nbrother of Miles McDonnell, Lord Selkirk's first governor of the Red\r\nRiver Settlement. John McDonnell was a rigid Roman Catholic, and was\r\nknown as \"Le Prêtre\" (\"The Priest\"), from the fact that on the voyage\r\nthrough the fur country he always insisted on observing the Church\r\nfasts along with his French Canadian employés. McDonnell, on leaving\r\nthe service of the North-West Company, retired to Point Fortune, on the\r\nOttawa, and there engaged in trade.\r\n\r\nWe have his journal for the years 1793-5, and it is an excellent example\r\nof what a typical fur trader's journal would be. It is minute, accurate,\r\nand very interesting. During this period he spent his time chiefly in\r\ntrading up and down the Assiniboine and Red Rivers. A few extracts will\r\nshow the interesting nature of his journal entries:--\r\n\r\n_Fort Espérance, Oct. 18th, 1793._--Neil McKay set out to build and\r\nwinter at the Forks of the river (junction of the Qu'Appelle and\r\nAssiniboine), alongside of Mr. Peter Grant, who has made his pitch about\r\nseven leagues from here. Mr. N. McKay's effects were carried in two\r\nboats, managed by five men each. Mr. C. Grant set out for his quarters\r\nof River Tremblant, about thirty leagues from here. The dogs made a\r\nwoeful howling at all the departures.\r\n\r\n_Oct. 19th._--Seventeen warriors came from the banks of the Missouri for\r\ntobacco. They slept ten nights on their way, and are emissaries from a\r\nparty of Assiniboines who went to war upon the Sioux.\r\n\r\n_Oct. 20th._--The warriors traded a few skins brought upon their backs\r\nand went off ill pleased with their reception. After dark, the dogs kept\r\nup a constant barking, which induced a belief that some of the warriors\r\nwere lurking about the fort for an opportunity to steal. I took a sword\r\nand pistol and went to sleep in the store. Nothing took place.\r\n\r\n_Oct. 31st._--Two of Mr. N. McKay's men came from the forts, supposing\r\nthis to be All Saints' Day. Raised a flag-staff poplar, fifty feet above\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 23rd._--The men were in chase of a white buffalo all day, but\r\ncould not get within shot of him. Faignant killed two buffalo cows. A\r\nmild day.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 30th._--St. Andrew's Day. Hoisted the flag in honour of the\r\ntitulary saint of Scotland. A beautiful day. Expected Messrs. Peter\r\nGrant and Neil McKay to dinner. They sent excuse by Bonneau.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 2nd._--Sent Mr. Peter Grant a Town and Country magazine of 1790.\r\nPoitras' wife made me nine pairs of shoes (moccasins).\r\n\r\n_Jan. 1st, 1794._--Mr. Grant gave the men two gallons of rum and three\r\nfathoms of tobacco, by the way of New Year's gift.\r\n\r\n(It is interesting to follow McDonnell on one of his journeys down the\r\nAssiniboine.)\r\n\r\n_May 1st._--Sent off the canoes early in the morning. Mr. Grant and I\r\nset out about seven. Slept at the Forks of River Qu'Appelle.\r\n\r\n_May 4th._--Killed four buffalo cows and two calves and camped below the\r\nFort of Mountain à La Bosse (near Virden), about two leagues.\r\n\r\n_May 5th._--Arrived at Ange's River La Souris Fort (below Brandon).\r\n\r\n_May 17th._--Passed Fort Des Trembles and Portage La Prairie.\r\n\r\n_May 20th._--Arrived at the Forks Red River (present city of Winnipeg)\r\nabout noon.\r\n\r\n_May 24th._--Arrived at the Lake (Winnipeg) at 10 a.m.\r\n\r\n_May 27th._--Arrived at the Sieur's Fort (Fort Alexander at the mouth of\r\nWinnipeg River).\r\n\r\nMcDonnell also gives in his journal a number of particulars about the\r\nCree and Assiniboine Indians, describing their religion, marriages,\r\ndress, dances, and mourning. The reader is struck with the difference\r\nin the recital by different traders of the lives lived by them. The\r\nliterary faculty is much more developed in some cases than in others,\r\nand John McDonnell was evidently an observing and quick-witted man. He\r\nbelonged to a U. E. Loyalist Scottish family that took a good position\r\nin the affairs of early Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FULL AND INTERESTING AUTOBIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nThat the first trader of the North-West whom we have described,\r\nAlexander Henry, should have been followed in the North-West fur trade\r\nby his nephew, Alexander Henry, Jr., is in itself a thing of interest;\r\nbut that the younger Henry should have left us a most voluminous and\r\nentertaining journal is a much greater matter.\r\n\r\nThe copy of this journal is in the Parliamentary Library at Ottawa,\r\nand forms two large bound folio volumes of 1,642 pages. It is not\r\nthe original, but is a well-approved copy made in 1824 by George\r\nCoventry, of Montreal. For many years this manuscript has been in the\r\nParliamentary Library, and extracts have been made and printed. Recently\r\nan American writer, Dr. Coues, who has done good service in editing the\r\nnotable work of Lewis and Clark, and also that of Zebulon S. Pike, has\r\npublished a digest of Henry's journal and added to it very extensive\r\nnotes of great value. The greatest praise is due to this author for the\r\nskill with which he has edited the journal, and all students of the\r\nperiod are indebted to one so well fitted to accomplish the task.\r\n\r\nThe journal opens, in 1799, with Henry on the waters of a tributary\r\nof Lake Manitoba, he having arrived from Grand Portage by the usual\r\nfur traders' route. In this place he built a trading house and spent\r\nhis first winter. In the following year the trader is found on the Red\r\nRiver very near the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude, and is\r\nengaged in establishing a post at the mouth of the Pembina River, a\r\ntributary of Red River. At this post Henry remains until 1808, going\r\nhither and thither in trading expeditions, establishing new outposts,\r\ncounter-working the rival traders of the X Y Company, and paying his\r\nvisits from time to time to Grand Portage.\r\n\r\nHenry's entries are made with singular clearness and realistic force.\r\nHe recites with the utmost frankness the details of drunken debauchery\r\namong the Indians, the plots of one company to outdo the other in\r\ntrading with the Indians, and the tricks of trade so common at this\r\nperiod in the fur trade.\r\n\r\nA few examples of his graphic descriptions may be given. \"At ten\r\no'clock I came to the point of wood in which the fort was built, and\r\njust as I entered the gate at a gallop, to take the road that led to the\r\ngate, a gun was fired about ten yards from me, apparently by a person\r\nwho lay in the long grass. My horse was startled and jumped on one side,\r\nsnorting and prancing; but I kept my seat, calling out, 'Who is there?'\r\nNo answer was returned. I instantly took my gun from my belt, and cocked\r\nher to fire, forgetting she was not loaded and I had no ammunition. I\r\ncould still see the person running in the grass, and was disappointed\r\nin not having a shot at him. I again called out, 'Who is there?' 'C'est\r\nmoi, bourgeois.' It proved to be one of my men, Charbonneau. I was vexed\r\nwith him for causing me such consternation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRED RIVER.\r\n\r\n\"_February 28th, 1801._--Wolves and crows are very numerous, feeding on\r\nthe buffalo carcasses that lie in every direction. I shot two buffalo\r\ncows, a calf, and two bulls, and got home after dark. I was choking\r\nwith thirst, having chased the buffalo on snow-shoes in the heat of the\r\nday, when the snow so adheres that one is scarcely able to raise the\r\nfeet. A draught of water was the sweetest beverage I ever tasted. An\r\nIndian brought in a calf of this year, which he found dead. It was well\r\ngrown, and must have perished last night in the snow. This was thought\r\nextraordinary; they say it denotes an early spring.\r\n\r\n\"_March 5th._--The buffalo have for some time been wandering in every\r\ndirection. My men have raised and put their traps in order for the\r\nspring hunt, as the raccoons begin to come out of their winter quarters\r\nin the daytime, though they retire to the hollow trees at night. On the\r\n8th it rained for four hours; fresh meat thawed. On the 9th we saw the\r\nfirst spring bird. Bald eagles we have seen the whole winter, but now\r\nthey are numerous, feeding on the buffalo carcasses.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the Red River period Henry made a notable journey in 1806 across\r\nthe plains to the Mandans on the Missouri. Two years afterward he bids\r\nfarewell to Red River and the Assiniboine, and goes to carry on trade in\r\nthe Saskatchewan. While on the Saskatchewan, which was for three years,\r\nhe was in charge of important forts, viz. Fort Vermilion, Terre Blanche,\r\nand the Rocky Mountain House. His energy and acquaintance with the\r\nprairie were well shown in his exploration of this great region, and the\r\nlong journeys willingly undertaken by him. His account of the western\r\nprairies, especially of the Assiniboines, is complete and trustworthy.\r\nIn fact, he rejoices in supplying us with the details of their lives and\r\nmanners which we might well be spared.\r\n\r\nA gap of two years from 1811 is found in Henry's journal, but it is\r\nresumed in 1813, the year in which he crosses the Rocky Mountains and\r\nis found in the party sent by the North-West Company to check the\r\nencroachments on the Columbia of the Astor Fur Company. His account\r\nof the voyage on the Pacific is regarded as valuable, and Dr. Coues\r\nsays somewhat quaintly: \"His work is so important a concordance that\r\nif Franchère, Cox, and Ross be regarded as the synoptical writers of\r\nAstoria, then Henry furnishes the fourth Gospel.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the surrender of Astoria to the North-West Company and its\r\noccupation by the British, some of the Nor'-Westers returned. John\r\nMcDonald, of Garth, as we have seen, crossed the mountains. In his\r\njournal occurs a significant entry: \"Mr. la Rogue brings the melancholy\r\nintelligence that Messrs. D. McTavish, Alexander Henry, and five sailors\r\nwere drowned on May 22nd last, in going out in a boat from Fort George\r\nto the vessel called the _Isaac Todd_.\" Ross Cox gives a circumstantial\r\naccount of this sad accident, though, strange to say, he does not\r\nmention the name of Henry, while giving that of D. McTavish.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat startling to us to find that Henry continued his journal\r\nup to the very day before his death, his last sentence being, \"The\r\nweather cleared up.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRADER LOST FOR FORTY DAYS.\r\n\r\nLying before the writer is the copy of a letter of John Pritchard, of\r\nthe X Y Company, written in 1805, giving an account of a forty days'\r\nadventure of a most thrilling kind. Pritchard was in charge of the X Y\r\nFort at the mouth of the Souris River on the Assiniboine. He had on June\r\n10th gone with one of the clerks up the River Assiniboine, intending\r\nto reach Qu'Appelle Fort, a distance of 120 miles. All went well till\r\nMontagne à la Bosse was reached, where there was a trading house. Going\r\nwestward, the two traders were separated in looking for the horses.\r\nPritchard lit fires for two days, but could attract no attention. Then\r\nhe realized that he was lost. Misled by the belts of timber along the\r\ndifferent streams, he went along the Pipestone, thinking he was going\r\ntowards the Assiniboine. In this he was mistaken. Painfully he crept\r\nalong the river, his strength having nearly gone. Living on frogs,\r\ntwo hawks, and a few other birds, he says at the end of ten days, \"I\r\nperceived my body completely wasted. Nothing was left me but my bones,\r\ncovered with a skin thinner than paper. I was perfectly naked, my\r\nclothes having been worn in making shoes, with which I protected my\r\nbruised and bleeding feet.\"\r\n\r\nSome days after, Pritchard found a nest of small eggs and lived on\r\nthem. He says, \"How mortifying to me to see the buffalo quenching their\r\nthirst in every lake near to which I slept, and geese and swans in\r\nabundance, whilst I was dying of hunger in this land of plenty, for want\r\nof wherewith to kill.\" After trying to make a hook and line to fish, and\r\nfailing; after being tempted to lie down and give up life, he caught a\r\nhen grouse, which greatly strengthened him, as he cooked and ate it. He\r\nhad now crossed the Souris River, thinking it to be the Assiniboine, and\r\ncame upon a great plain where the prairie turnip (Psoralea esculenta)\r\ngrew plentifully. Pushing southward, being sustained by the bulbs of\r\nthis \"pomme blanche,\" as it is called by the French voyageurs, Pritchard\r\ncame at length to Whitewater Lake, near Turtle Mountain, and here found\r\ntwo vacant wintering houses of the fur traders. He now was able to\r\nidentify his locality and to estimate that he was sixty miles directly\r\nsouth of his trading post. His feet, pierced by the spear grass (Stipa\r\nspartea), were now in a dreadful condition. He found a pair of old shoes\r\nin the vacant fort and several pairs of socks.\r\n\r\nHe determined to move northward to his fort. Soon he was met by a band\r\nof Indians, who were alarmed at his worn appearance. The natives took\r\ngood care of him and carried him, at times unconscious, to his fort,\r\nwhich he reached after an absence of forty days. He says, \"Picture to\r\nyourself a man whose bones are scraped, not an atom of flesh remaining,\r\nthen over these bones a loose skin, fine as the bladder of an animal; a\r\nbeard of forty days' growth, his hair full of filth and scabs. You will\r\nthen have some idea of what I was.\" The Hudson's Bay Company officer,\r\nMcKay, from the neighbouring fort, was exceedingly kind and supplied his\r\nevery want.\r\n\r\nThe Cree Indians after this adventure called Pritchard the Manitou\r\nor Great Spirit. The Assiniboines called him Cheepe--or the corpse,\r\nreferring to his wan appearance. For weeks after his return the\r\nmiserable trader was unable to move about, but in time recovered, and\r\nlived to a good old age on the banks of the Red River.\r\n\r\nTo the last day of his life he referred to his great deliverance, and\r\nwas thoroughly of the opinion that his preservation was miraculous.\r\n\r\n\r\nASSINIBOINE TO MISSOURI.\r\n\r\nWe are fortunate in having two very good journals of journeys made in\r\nthe early years of the century from the forts at the junction of the\r\nSouris and Assiniboine River to the Missouri River. As was described in\r\nthe case of David Thompson, this was a long and tedious journey, and yet\r\nit was at one time within the plans of the North-West Company to carry\r\ntheir trade thither. Few of the French Canadian gentlemen entered into\r\nthe North-West Company. One of these, who became noted as an Indian\r\ntrader, was François Antoine Larocque, brother-in-law of Quesnel, the\r\ncompanion of Simon Fraser. Of the same rank as himself, and associated\r\nwith him, was a trader, Charles McKenzie, who entered the North-West\r\nCompany as a clerk in 1803.\r\n\r\nThe expedition to the Mandans under these gentlemen, left Fort\r\nAssiniboine on November 11th, 1804, a party in all of seven, and\r\nprovided with horses, five of which carried merchandise for trade. After\r\nthe usual incidents of this trying journey, the Missouri was reached.\r\n\r\nThe notable event of this journey was the meeting with the American\r\nexpedition of Lewis and Clark, then on its way to cross overland to\r\nthe Pacific Ocean. Larocque in his journal gives information about this\r\nexpedition. Leaving Philadelphia in 1803, the expedition, consisting of\r\nupward of forty men, had taken till October to reach the Mandans on the\r\nMissouri. The purposes of the expedition of Lewis and Clark were:--\r\n\r\n(1) To explore the territory towards the Pacific and settle the boundary\r\nline between the British and American territories.\r\n\r\n(2) To quiet the Indians of the Missouri by conference and the\r\nbestowment of gifts.\r\n\r\nLarocque was somewhat annoyed by the message given him by Lewis and\r\nClark, that no flags or medals could be given by the North-West Company\r\nto the Indians in the Missouri, inasmuch as they were American Indians.\r\nLarocque had some amusement at the continual announcement by these\r\nleaders that the Indians would be protected so long as they should\r\nbehave as dutiful children to the great father, the President of the\r\nUnited States. In the spring the party returned, after wintering on\r\nthe Missouri. In 1805, during the summer, another expedition went\r\nto the Missouri; in 1806, Charles McKenzie went in February to the\r\nMandans, and, returning, made a second journey in the same year to the\r\nMissouri. The account given by McKenzie of the journeys of 1804-6 is an\r\nexceedingly well written one, for this leader was fond of study, and, we\r\nare told, delighted especially in the history of his native land, the\r\nhighlands of Scotland.\r\n\r\nCharles McKenzie had married an Indian woman, and became thoroughly\r\nidentified with the North-West. He was fond of his native children, and\r\nstood up for their recognition on the same plane as the white children.\r\nAfter the union of the North-West Company and the Hudson's Bay Company,\r\nthe English influence largely prevailed. Thinking that his son, who was\r\nwell educated at the Red River Seminary, was not sufficiently recognized\r\nby the Company, McKenzie wrote bitterly, \"It appears the present concern\r\nhas stamped the Cain mark upon all born in this country. Neither\r\neducation nor abilities serve them. The Honourable Company are unwilling\r\nto take natives, even as apprenticed clerks, and the favoured few they\r\ndo take can never aspire to a higher status, be their education and\r\ncapacity what they may.\"\r\n\r\nMcKenzie continued the fur trade until 1846, when he retired and settled\r\non the Red River. His son, Hector McKenzie, now dead, was well known on\r\nthe Red River, and accompanied one of the explorations to the far north.\r\n\r\nLarocque did not continue long in the fur trade, but went to Montreal\r\nand embarked in business, in which he was very unsuccessful. He spent\r\nthe last years of his life in retirement and close study, and died in\r\nthe Grey nunnery in a Lower Canadian parish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE LORDS OF THE LAKES AND FORESTS.--III.\r\n\r\n     Dashing French trader--\"The country of fashion\"--An air of\r\n     great superiority--The road is that of heaven--Enough to intimidate\r\n     a Cæsar--\"The Bear\" and the \"Little Branch\"--Yet more rum--A\r\n     great Irishman--\"In the wigwam of Wabogish dwelt his beautiful\r\n     daughter\"--Wedge of gold--Johnston and Henry Schoolcraft--Duncan\r\n     Cameron on Lake Superior--His views of trade--Peter Grant, the\r\n     ready writer--Paddling the canoe--Indian folk-lore--Chippewa\r\n     burials--Remarkable men and great financiers, marvellous explorers,\r\n     facile traders.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DASHING FRENCH TRADER--FRANÇOIS VICTOR MALHIOT.\r\n\r\nA gay and intelligent French lad, taken with the desire of leading the\r\nlife of the traders in the \"upper country\" (_pays d'en haut_), at the\r\nage of fifteen deserted school and entered the North-West Company. In\r\n1796, at the age of twenty, he was promoted to a clerkship and sent to\r\na post in the upper part of the Red River country. On account of his\r\ninferior education he was never advanced to the charge of a post in\r\nthe Company's service, but he was always noted for his courage and the\r\ngreat energy displayed by him in action. In 1804 Malhiot was sent to\r\nWisconsin, where he carried on trade.\r\n\r\nFor the North-West Company there he built a fort and waged a vigorous\r\nwarfare with the other traders, strong drink being one of the most ready\r\nweapons in the contest. In 1801 the trader married after the \"country\r\nfashion\" (_à la façon du pays_), i.e. as we have explained, he had taken\r\nan Indian woman to be his wife, with the understanding that when he\r\nretired from the fur trade, she should be left provided for as to her\r\nliving, but be free to marry another.\r\n\r\nMalhiot tired of the fur trade in 1807 and returned to Lower Canada,\r\nwhere he lived till his death. Malhiot's Indian wife was afterwards\r\ntwice married, and one of her sons by the third marriage became a member\r\nof the Legislature in Lower Canada. A brother of Malhiot's became\r\na colonel in the British army in India, and another brother was an\r\ninfluential man in his native province.\r\n\r\nFew traders had more adventures than this French Canadian. Stationed\r\nwest of Lake Superior, at Lac du Flambeau, Malhiot found himself\r\nsurrounded by men of the X Y Company, and he assumed an air of great\r\nsuperiority in his dealings with the Indians. Two of his companions\r\nintroduced him to the savages as the brother of William McGillivray, the\r\nhead of the North-West Company. He says, \"This thing has produced a very\r\ngood effect up to the present, for they never name me otherwise than as\r\ntheir 'father.' I am glad to believe that they will respect me more than\r\nthey otherwise would have done, and will do themselves the honour of\r\ntrading with me this winter.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the rough country through which he was passing, Malhiot\r\nsays, \"Of all the passages and places that I have been able to see\r\nduring the thirteen years in which I travelled, this is the most\r\nfrightful and unattractive. The road of the portage is truly that of\r\nheaven, for it is strait, full of obstacles, slippery places, thorns,\r\nand bogs. The men who pass it loaded, and who are obliged to carry over\r\nit bales, certainly deserve the name of 'men.'\r\n\r\n\"This villainous portage is only inhabited by owls, because no other\r\nanimal could find its living there, and the cries of these solitary\r\nbirds are enough to frighten an angel and to intimidate a Cæsar.\"\r\n\r\nMalhiot maintained his dignified attitude to the Indians and held great\r\nconferences with the chiefs, always with an eye to the improvement of\r\ntrade. To one he says:--\r\n\r\n\"MY FATHER,--It is with great joy that I smoke in thy pipe of peace and\r\nthat I receive thy word. Our chief trader at Kaministiquia will accept\r\nit, I trust, this spring, with satisfaction, and he will send thee a\r\nmark of his friendship, if thou dost continue to do well. So I take\r\ncourage! Only be as one, and look at the fort of the X Y from a distance\r\nif thou dost wish to attain to what thou desirest.\"\r\n\r\nIn April, 1805, the trader says, \"My people have finished building my\r\nfort, and it is the prettiest of any in the Indian country. Long live\r\nthe North-West Company! Honour to Malhiot!\"\r\n\r\nMalhiot gives a very sad picture of the degeneracy of the trade at this\r\ntime, produced by the use of strong drink in gaining the friendship of\r\nthe Indians. A single example may suffice to show the state of affairs.\r\n\r\n_April 26th._--\"The son of 'Whetstone,' brother-in-law of Chorette, came\r\nhere this evening and made me a present of one otter, 15 rats, and 12\r\nlbs. of sugar, for which I gave him 4 pots of rum. He made them drunk\r\nat Chorette's with the 'Indians,' the 'Bear,' and 'the Little Branch.'\r\nWhen they were well intoxicated, they cleared the house, very nearly\r\nkilled Chorette, shot La Lancette, and broke open the store-house. They\r\ncarried away two otters, for which I gave them more rum this morning,\r\nbut without knowing they had been stolen. All this destruction occurred\r\nbecause Chorette had promised them more rum, and that he had not any\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\nMalhiot's journal closes with the statement that after a long journey\r\nfrom the interior he and his party had camped in view of the island at\r\nGrand Portage.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN IRISHMAN OF DISTINCTION.\r\n\r\nIn the conflict of the North-West, X Y, and Hudson's Bay Companies,\r\nit is interesting to come upon the life and writing of an Irishman, a\r\nman of means, who, out of love for the wilds of Lake Superior, settled\r\ndown upon its shores and became a \"free trader,\" as he was called. This\r\nwas John Johnston, who came to Montreal, enjoyed the friendship of Sir\r\nGuy Carleton, the Governor of Canada, and hearing of the romantic life\r\nof the fur traders, plunged into the interior, in 1792 settled at La\r\nPointe, on the south side of Lake Superior, and established himself as\r\nan independent trader. A gentleman of birth and education, Johnston\r\nseems to have possessed a refined and even religious spirit. Filled with\r\nhigh thoughts inspired by a rocky and romantic island along the shore,\r\nhe named it \"Contemplation Island.\" Determined to pass his life on the\r\nrocky but picturesque shores of Lake Superior, Johnston became friendly\r\nwith the Indian people. The old story of love and marriage comes in\r\nhere also. The chief of the region was Wabogish, the \"White Fisher,\"\r\nwhose power extended as far west as the Mississippi. In the wigwam of\r\nWabogish dwelt his beautiful daughter. Her hand had been sought by many\r\nyoung braves, but she had refused them all. The handsome, sprightly\r\nIrishman had, however, gained her affections, and proposed to her father\r\nfor her. Writing long afterward he describes her as she was when he\r\nfirst saw her, a year after his arrival on the shores of Lake Superior.\r\n\"Wabogish or the 'White Fisher,' the chief of La Pointe, made his sugar\r\non the skirts of a high mountain, four days' march from the entrance of\r\nthe river to the south-east. His eldest daughter, a girl of fourteen,\r\nexceedingly handsome, with a cousin of hers who was two or three years\r\nolder, rambling one day up the eastern side of the mountain, came to a\r\nperpendicular cliff exactly fronting the rising sun. Near the base of\r\nthe cliff they found a piece of yellow metal, as they called it, about\r\neighteen inches long, a foot broad, four inches thick and perfectly\r\nsmooth. It was so heavy that they could raise it only with great\r\ndifficulty. After examining it for some time, it occurred to the eldest\r\ngirl that it belonged to the 'Gitche Manitou,' 'The Great Spirit,' upon\r\nwhich they abandoned the place with precipitation.\r\n\r\n\"As the Chippewas are not idolaters, it occurs to me that some of the\r\nsouthern tribes must have emigrated thus far to the North, and that the\r\npiece either of copper or of gold is part of an altar dedicated to the\r\nsun. If my conjecture is right, the slab is more probably gold--as the\r\nMexicans have more of that metal than they have of copper.\"\r\n\r\nThe advances of Johnston toward chief Wabogish for marriage to his\r\ndaughter were for a time resisted by the forest magnate. Afraid of\r\nthe marriages made after the country fashion, he advised Johnston to\r\nreturn to his native country for a time. If, after a sufficient absence,\r\nhis affection for his daughter should still remain strong, he would\r\nconsent to their marriage. Johnston returned to Ireland, disposed of his\r\nproperty, and came back to Lake Superior to claim his bride.\r\n\r\nJohnston settled at Sault Ste. Marie, where he had a \"very considerable\r\nestablishment with extensive plantations of corn and vegetables, a\r\nbeautiful garden, a comfortable house, a good library, and carried on an\r\nimportant trade.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the war of 1814 he co-operated with the British commandant,\r\nColonel McDonald, in taking the island of Michilimackinac from the\r\nAmericans. While absent, the American expedition landed at Sault Ste.\r\nMarie, and set fire to Johnston's house, stables, and other buildings,\r\nand these were burnt to the ground, his wife and children viewing the\r\ndestruction of their home from the neighbouring woods.\r\n\r\nMasson says: \"A few years afterwards, Mr. Johnston once more visited\r\nhis native land, accompanied by his wife and his eldest daughter, a\r\nyoung lady of surpassing beauty. Every inducement was offered to them to\r\nremain in the old country, the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland having\r\neven offered to adopt their daughter. They preferred, however, returning\r\nto the shores of Lake Superior, where Miss Johnston was married to Mr.\r\nHenry Schoolcraft, the United States Indian agent at Sault Ste. Marie,\r\nand the distinguished author of the 'History of the Indian Tribes of\r\nthe United States.'\" Mr. Johnston wrote \"An Account of Lake Superior\"\r\nat the request of Roderick McKenzie. This we have, but it is chiefly a\r\ngeographical description of the greatest of American lakes. Johnston\r\ndied at Sault Ste. Marie in 1828.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DETERMINED TRADER OF LAKE SUPERIOR.\r\n\r\nA most daring and impulsive Celt was Duncan Cameron. He and his family\r\nwere Scottish U. E. Loyalists from the Mohawk River in New York State.\r\nAs a young man he entered the fur trade, and was despatched to the\r\nregion on Lake Superior to serve under Mr. Shaw, the father of Angus\r\nShaw, of whom we have already spoken. In 1786 Cameron became a clerk and\r\nwas placed in charge of the Nepigon district, an important field for his\r\nenergies. Though this region was a difficult one, yet by hard work he\r\nmade it remunerative to his Company. Speaking of his illness, caused by\r\nexposure, he says, in writing a letter to his friend, \"I can assure you\r\nit is with great difficulty I can hold my pen, but I must tell you that\r\nthe X Y sends into the Nepigon this year; therefore, should I leave my\r\nbones there, I shall go to winter.\"\r\n\r\nIn response to the application of Roderick McKenzie, Duncan Cameron\r\nsent a description of the Nepigon district and a journal of one of his\r\njourneys to the interior. From these we may give a few extracts. Passing\r\nover his rather full and detailed account of Saulteaux Indians of this\r\nregion, we find that he speaks in a journal which is in a very damaged\r\ncondition, of his visit to Osnaburgh Fort, a Hudson's Bay Company fort\r\nbuilt in 1786, and of his decision to send a party to trade in the\r\ninterior. There is abundant evidence of the great part played by strong\r\ndrink at this time in the fur country.\r\n\r\n\"Cotton Shirt, a haughty Indian chief, has always been very faithful to\r\nme these several years past. He is, without exception, the best hunter\r\nin the whole department, and passes as having in consequence great\r\ninfluence over me. One of his elder brothers spoke next and said that he\r\nwas now grown up to a man; that 'his fort,' as he calls Osnaburgh, was\r\ntoo far off for the winter trade; that if I left anyone here, he would\r\ncome to them with winter skins; he could not live without getting drunk\r\nthree or four times at least, but that I must leave a clerk to deal with\r\nhim, as he was above trading with any young under-strappers. I told him\r\nthat if I consented to leave a person here, I would leave one that had\r\nboth sense and knowledge enough to know how to use him well, as also any\r\nother great man. This Indian had been spoiled by the H. B. people at\r\nOsnaburgh Fort, where we may consider him master. He had been invited to\r\ndine there last spring.\"\r\n\r\n\"This great English partisan, a few weeks ago, had his nose bit off by\r\nhis son-in-law at the door of what he calls 'his fort.' He is not yet\r\ncured, and says that a great man like him must not get angry or take any\r\nrevenge, especially when he stands in awe of the one who ill-used him,\r\nfor there is nothing an Indian will not do rather than admit himself to\r\nbe a coward.\"\r\n\r\n\"My canoe was very much hampered; I put a man and his wife in the small\r\ncanoe and embarked in the other small canoe with my guides, after giving\r\nsome liquor to the old man and his sons, who must remain here to-day\r\nto try and pack all their three canoes. We went on as well as we could\r\nagainst a cold head wind till the big canoe got on a stone which nearly\r\nupset her and tore a piece two feet square out of her bottom. She filled\r\nimmediately and the men and goods were all in danger of going to the\r\nbottom before they reached the shore; notwithstanding their efforts, she\r\nsank in three feet of water. We hastened to get everything out of her,\r\nbut my sugar and their molasses were damaged, but worse than all, my\r\npowder, which I immediately examined, was considerably damaged.\"\r\n\r\n\"Having decided to establish a fort, we all set to work; four men to\r\nbuild, one to square boards for the doors, timber for the floors, and\r\nshelves for the shops, the two others to attend the rest.... There are\r\nnow eight Indians here, all drunk and very troublesome to my neighbour,\r\nwho, I believe, is as drunk as themselves; they are all very civil to\r\nme, and so they may, for I am giving them plenty to drink, without\r\ngetting anything from them as yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"This man (an Indian from Red Lake) tells me that the English (H.\r\nB. Co.), the X Y, and Mr. Adhemar (a free trader) were striving who\r\nwould squander the most and thereby please the Indians best, but the\r\nconsequence will be that the Indians will get all they want for half the\r\nvalue and laugh at them all, in the end. He told me that an Indian, who\r\nI know very well to have no influence on anyone but himself, got five\r\nkegs of mixed high wines to himself alone between the three houses and\r\ntook 200 skins credit; that all the Indians were fifteen days without\r\ngetting sober. I leave it to any rational being to judge what that\r\nIndian's skins will cost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another circumstance which will tend to injure the trade very much,\r\nso long as we have the Hudson's Bay Company against us, is the premium\r\nthey allow every factor or master on whatever number of skins they\r\nobtain. Those people do not care at what price they buy or whether their\r\nemployés gain by them, so long as they have their premium, which sets\r\nthem in opposition to one another almost as much as they are to us. The\r\nhonourable Hudson's Bay Company proprietors very little knew their own\r\ninterest when they first allowed this interest to their 'officers,'\r\nas they call them, as it certainly had not the desired effect, for,\r\nif it added some to their exertions, it led in a great degree to the\r\nsquandering of their goods, as they are in general both needy and\r\nselfish.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER GRANT, THE HISTORIOGRAPHER.\r\n\r\nWhile many journals and sketches were forwarded to Mr. Roderick\r\nMcKenzie, none of them were of so high a character in completeness and\r\nstyle as that of Mr. Peter Grant on the Saulteaux Indians. Peter Grant,\r\nas quite a young man at the age of twenty, joined the North-West Company\r\nin 1784. Seven years afterward he had become a partner, had charge of\r\nRainy Lake district, and afterward that of the Red River department. His\r\nsketch of the Indians marks him as a keen observer and a facile writer.\r\nSome of his descriptions are excellent:--\r\n\r\n\"The fruits found in this country are the wild plum, a small sort\r\nof wild cherry, wild currants of different kinds, gooseberries,\r\nstrawberries, raspberries, brambleberries, blackberries, choke cherries,\r\nwild grapes, sand cherries, a delicious fruit which grows on a small\r\nshrub near sandy shores, and another blueberry, a fine fruit not larger\r\nthan a currant, tasting much like a pear and growing on a small tree\r\nabout the size of a willow. (No doubt the Saskatoon berry.--ED.) In\r\nthe swamp you find two kinds of cranberries. Hazel nuts, but of very\r\ninferior quality, grow near the banks of the rivers and lakes. A kind of\r\nwild rice grows spontaneously in the small muddy creeks and bays.\"\r\n\r\n\"The North-West Company's canoes, manned with five men, carry about\r\n3,000 lbs.; they seldom draw more than eighteen inches of water and go\r\ngenerally at the rate of six miles an hour in calm weather. When arrived\r\nat a portage, the bowman instantly jumps in the water to prevent the\r\ncanoe from touching the bottom, while the others tie their slings to the\r\npackages in the canoe and swing them on their backs to carry over the\r\nportage. The bowman and the steersman carry their canoe, a duty from\r\nwhich the middle men are exempt. The whole is conducted with astonishing\r\nexpedition, a necessary consequence of the enthusiasm which always\r\nattends their long and perilous voyages. It is pleasing to see them,\r\nwhen the weather is calm and serene, paddling in their canoes, singing\r\nin chorus their simple, melodious strains, and keeping exact time with\r\ntheir paddles, which effectually beguiles their labours. When they\r\narrive at a rapid, the guide or foreman's business is to explore the\r\nwaters previous to their running down with their canoes, and, according\r\nto the height of the water, they either lighten the canoe by taking out\r\npart of the cargo and carry it overland, or run down the whole load.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Saulteaux, Grant says, \"The Saulteaux are, in general,\r\nof the common stature, well proportioned, though inclining to a slender\r\nmake, which would indicate more agility than strength. Their complexion\r\nis a whitish cast of the copper colour, their hair black, long,\r\nstraight, and of a very strong texture, the point of the nose rather\r\nflat, and a certain fulness in the lips, but not sufficient to spoil\r\nthe appearance of the mouth. The teeth, of a beautiful ivory white, are\r\nregular, well set, and seldom fail them even in the most advanced period\r\nof life; their cheeks are high and rather prominent, their eyes black\r\nand lively, their countenance is generally pleasant, and the symmetry\r\nof their features is such as to constitute what can be called handsome\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\n\"Their passions, whether of a benevolent or mischievous tendency, are\r\nalways more violent than ours. I believe this has been found to be the\r\ncase with all barbarous nations who never cultivate the mind; hence the\r\ncruelties imputed to savages, in general, towards their enemies. Though\r\nthese people cannot be acquitted from some degree of that ferocious\r\nbarbarity which characterizes the savages, they are, however, free\r\nfrom that deliberate cruelty which has been so often imputed to other\r\nbarbarous natives. They are content to kill and scalp their enemy, and\r\nnever reserve a prisoner for the refined tortures of a lingering and\r\ncruel death.\r\n\r\n\"The Saulteaux have, properly speaking, no regular system of government\r\nand but a very imperfect idea of the different ranks of society so\r\nabsolutely necessary in all civilized countries. Their leading men\r\nor chief magistrates are petty chiefs, whose dignity is hereditary,\r\nbut whose authority is confined within the narrow circle of their own\r\nparticular tribe or relatives. There are no established laws to enforce\r\nobedience; all is voluntary, and yet, such is their confidence and\r\nrespect for their chiefs, that instances of mutiny or disobedience to\r\norders are very rare among them.\r\n\r\n\"As to religion, Gitche Manitou, or the 'Master of Life,' claims the\r\nfirst rank in their devotion. To him they attribute the creation of the\r\nheavens, of the waters, and of that portion of the earth beyond the\r\nsea from which white people come. He is also the author of life and\r\ndeath, taking pleasure in promoting the happiness of the virtuous, and\r\nhaving, likewise, the power of punishing the wicked. Wiskendjac is next\r\nin power. He is said to be the creator of all the Indian tribes, the\r\ncountry they inhabit and all it contains. The last of their deities is\r\ncalled Matchi-Manitou, or the 'Bad Spirit,' He is the author of evil,\r\nbut subject to the control of the Gitche Manitou. Though he is justly\r\nheld in great detestation, it is thought good policy to smooth his anger\r\nby singing and beating the drum.\r\n\r\n\"When life is gone, the body of the dead is addressed by some friend of\r\nthe deceased in a long speech, in which he begs of him to take courage,\r\nand pursue his journey to the Great Meadow, observing that all his\r\ndeparted friends and relations are anxiously waiting to receive him, and\r\nthat his surviving friends will soon follow.\r\n\r\n\"The body is then decently dressed and wrapped in a new blanket, with\r\nnew shoes, garnished and painted with vermilion, on the feet. It is\r\nkept one night in the lodge, and is next day buried in the earth. After\r\nburial they either raise a pole of wood over the grave, or enclose it\r\nwith a fence. At the head of the grave a small post is erected, on\r\nwhich they carve the particular mark of the tribe to whom the deceased\r\nbelonged. The bodies of some of their most celebrated chiefs are raised\r\nupon a high scaffold, with flags flying, and the scalps of their\r\nenemies. It is customary with their warriors, at the funeral of their\r\ngreat men, to strike the post and relate all their martial achievements,\r\nas they do in the war dance, and their funeral ceremonies generally\r\nconclude by a feast round the grave.\"\r\n\r\nGrant, in 1794, built the post on the Assiniboine at the mouth of Shell\r\nRiver, and five years afterward was in charge of the fort on the Rainy\r\nLake. About the same time he erected a post, probably the first on the\r\nRed River, in the neighbourhood of the present village of St. Vincent,\r\nnear 49° N. Lat., opposite Pembina. He seems to have been in the Indian\r\ncountry in 1804, and, settling in Lower Canada, died at Lachine in 1848,\r\nat the grand old age of eighty-four.\r\n\r\nThus have we sought to sketch, from their own writings, pictures of the\r\nlords of the fur trade. They were a remarkable body of men. Great as\r\nfinanciers, marvellous as explorers, facile as traders, brave in their\r\nspirits, firm and yet tactful in their management of the Indians, and,\r\nexcept during the short period from 1800-1804, anxious for the welfare\r\nof the Red men. Looking back, we wonder at their daring and loyalty,\r\nand can well say with Washington Irving, \"The feudal state of Fort\r\nWilliam is at an end; its council chamber is silent and desolate; its\r\nbanquet-hall no longer echoes to the auld world ditty; the lords of the\r\nlakes and forests have passed away.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE IMPULSE OF UNION.\r\n\r\n     North-West and X Y Companies unite--Recalls the Homeric\r\n     period--Feuds forgotten--Men perform prodigies--The new fort\r\n     re-christened--Vessel from Michilimackinac--The old canal--Wills\r\n     builds Fort Gibraltar--A lordly sway--The \"Beaver Club\"--Sumptuous\r\n     table--Exclusive society--\"Fortitude in Distress\"--Political\r\n     leaders in Lower Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the termination of the great conflict between the North-West and the\r\nX Y Companies we have already referred. The death of Simon McTavish\r\nremoved a difficulty and served to unite the traders. The experience and\r\nstanding of the old Company and the zeal and vigour of the new combined\r\nto inspire new hope.\r\n\r\nGreat plans were matured for meeting the opposition of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany and extending the trade of the Company. The explorations of\r\nDavid Thompson and Simon Fraser, which, as we have seen, produced such\r\ngreat results in New Caledonia, while planned before, were now carried\r\nforward with renewed vigour, the enterprise of the Nor'-Westers being\r\nthe direct result of the union. The heroic deeds of these explorers\r\nrecall to us the adventurous times of the Homeric period, when men\r\nperformed prodigies and risked their lives for glory. The explanation of\r\nthis hearty co-operation was that the old and new Companies were very\r\nclosely allied. Brothers and cousins had been in opposite camps, not\r\nbecause they disliked each other, but because their leaders could not\r\nagree. Now the feuds were forgotten, and, with the enthusiasm of their\r\nCeltic natures, they would attempt great things.\r\n\r\nThe \"New Fort,\" as it had been called, at the mouth of the\r\nKaministiquia, was now re-christened, and the honoured name of the\r\nchieftain McGillivray was given to this great depôt--Fort William.\r\n\r\nIt became a great trading centre, and the additions required to\r\naccommodate the increased volume of business and the greater number of\r\nemployés, were cheerfully made by the united Company.\r\n\r\nStanding within the great solitudes of Thunder Bay, Fort William became\r\nas celebrated in the annals of the North-West Company, as York or Albany\r\nhad been in the history of the Hudson's Bay Company.\r\n\r\nA vessel came up from Lake Erie, bringing supplies, and, calling at\r\nMichilimackinac, reached the Sault Ste. Marie. Boats which had come down\r\nthe canal, built to avoid the St. Mary Rapids, here met this vessel.\r\nFrom the St. Mary River up to Fort William a schooner carried cargoes,\r\nand increased the profits of the trade, while it protected many from the\r\ndangers of the route. The whole trade was systematized, and the trading\r\nhouses, duplicated as they had been at many points, were combined, and\r\nthe expenses thus greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Company could fully lay its plans, it determined to take\r\nhold in earnest of the Red River district. Accordingly we see that,\r\nunder instructions from John McDonald, of Garth, a bourgeois named John\r\nWills, who, we find, had been one of the partners of the X Y Company,\r\nerected at the junction of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers, on the point\r\nof land, a fort called Fort Gibraltar. Wills was a year in building\r\nit, having under him twenty men. The stockade of this fort was made\r\nof \"oak trees split in two.\" The wooden picketing was from twelve to\r\nfifteen feet high. The following is a list of buildings enclosed in\r\nit, with some of their dimensions. There were eight houses in all; the\r\nresidence of the bourgeois, sixty-four feet in length; two houses for\r\nthe servants, respectively thirty-six and twenty-eight feet long; one\r\nstore thirty-two feet long; a blacksmith's shop, stable, kitchen, and\r\nan ice-house. On the top of the ice-house a watch-tower (guérite) was\r\nbuilt. John Wills continued to live in this fort up to the time of his\r\ndeath a few years later. Such was the first building, so far as we know,\r\nerected on the site of the City of the Plains, and which was followed\r\nfirst by Fort Douglas and then by Fort Garry, the chief fort in the\r\ninterior of Rupert's Land.\r\n\r\nIt was to this period in the history of the United Company that\r\nWashington Irving referred when he said: \"The partners held a lordly\r\nsway over the wintry lakes and boundless forests of the Canadas almost\r\nequal to that of the East India Company over the voluptuous climes and\r\nmagnificent realms of the Orient.\"\r\n\r\nSome years before this, a very select organization had been formed\r\namong the fur traders in Montreal. It was known as the \"Beaver Club.\"\r\nThe conditions of the membership were very strict. They were that the\r\ncandidate should have spent a period of service in the \"upper country,\"\r\nand have obtained the unanimous vote of the members. The gatherings of\r\nthe Club were very notable. At their meetings they assembled to recall\r\nthe prowess of the old days, the dangers of the rapids, the miraculous\r\ndeliverances accomplished by their canoe men, the disastrous accidents\r\nthey had witnessed.\r\n\r\nTheir days of feasting were long remembered by the inhabitants of\r\nMontreal after the club had passed away. The sumptuous table of the\r\nClub was always open to those of rank or distinction who might visit\r\nMontreal, and the approval of the Club gave the entry to the most\r\nexclusive society of Montreal.\r\n\r\nStill may be met with in Montreal pieces of silverware and glassware\r\nwhich were formerly the property of the \"Beaver Club,\" and even large\r\ngold medals bearing the motto, \"Fortitude in Distress,\" used by the\r\nmembers of the Club on their days of celebration.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period that the power of the fur trading magnates seemed\r\nto culminate, and their natural leadership of the French Canadians being\r\nrecognized in the fur trade, many of the partners became political\r\nleaders in the affairs of Lower Canada. The very success of the new\r\nCompany, however, stirred up, as we shall see, opposition movements\r\nof a much more serious kind than they had ever had to meet before.\r\nSir Alexander Mackenzie's book in 1801 had awakened much interest in\r\nBritain and now stimulated the movement by Lord Selkirk which led to\r\nthe absorption of the North-West Company. The social and commercial\r\nstanding of the partners started a movement in the United States which\r\naimed at wresting from British hands the territory of New Caledonia,\r\nwhich the energy of the North-West Company of explorers had taken\r\npossession of for the British crown.\r\n\r\nIt will, however, be to the glory of the North-West Company that these\r\npowerful opposition movements were mostly rendered efficient by the\r\nemployment of men whom the Nor'-Westers had trained; and the methods of\r\ntrade, borrowed from them by these opponents, were those continued in\r\nthe after conduct of the fur trade that grew up in Rupert's Land and the\r\nIndian territories beyond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE ASTOR FUR COMPANY.\r\n\r\n     Old John Jacob Astor--American Fur Company--The Missouri\r\n     Company--A line of posts--Approaches the Russians--Negotiates with\r\n     Nor'-Westers--Fails--Four North-West officials join Astor--Songs of\r\n     the voyageurs--True Britishers--Voyage of the _Tonquin_--Rollicking\r\n     Nor'-Westers in Sandwich Islands--Astoria built--David Thompson\r\n     appears--Terrible end of the _Tonquin_--Astor's overland\r\n     expedition--Washington Irving's \"Astoria, a romance\"--The _Beaver_\r\n     rounds the Cape--McDougall and his smallpox phial--The _Beaver_\r\n     sails for Canton.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong those who came to Montreal to trade with the Nor'-Westers and to\r\nreceive their hospitality was a German merchant of New York, named John\r\nJacob Astor. This man, who is the ancestor of the distinguished family\r\nof Astors at the present time in New York, came over from London to the\r\nNew World and immediately began to trade in furs. For several years\r\nAstor traded in Montreal, and shipped the furs purchased to London, as\r\nthere was a law against exporting from British possessions. After Jay's\r\ntreaty of amity and commerce (1794) this restriction was removed, and\r\nAstor took Canadian furs to the United States, and even exported them to\r\nChina, where high prices ruled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHANN JACOB ASTOR.]\r\n\r\nWhile Astor's ambition led him to aim at controlling the fur trade in\r\nthe United States, the fact that the western posts, such as Detroit\r\nand Michilimackinac, had not been surrendered to the United States\r\ntill after Jay's treaty, had allowed the British traders of these and\r\nother posts of the West to strengthen themselves. Such daring traders\r\nas Murdoch Cameron, Dickson, Fraser, and Rolette could not be easily\r\nbeaten on the ground where they were so familiar, and where they had\r\ngained such an ascendancy over the Indians. The Mackinaw traders were\r\ntoo strong for Astor, and the hope of overcoming them through the agency\r\nof the \"American Fur Company,\" which he had founded in 1809, had to be\r\ngiven up by him. What could not be accomplished by force could, however,\r\nbe gained by negotiation, and so two years afterward, with the help of\r\ncertain partners from among the Nor'-Westers in Montreal, Astor bought\r\nout the Mackinaw traders (1811), and established what was called the\r\n\"South-West Company.\"\r\n\r\nDuring these same years, the St. Louis merchants organized a company\r\nto trade upon the Missouri and Nebraska Rivers. This was known as the\r\nMissouri Company, and with its 250 men it pushed its trade, until in\r\n1808, one of its chief traders crossed the Rocky Mountains, and built\r\na fort on the western slope. This was, however, two years afterward\r\ngiven up on account of the hostility of the natives. A short time\r\nafter this, the Company passed out of existence, leaving the field to\r\nthe enterprising merchant of New York, who, in 1810, organized his\r\nwell-known \"Pacific Fur Company.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASANOV. Trader and Chief.]\r\n\r\nDuring these eventful years, the resourceful Astor was, with the full\r\nknowledge of the American Government, steadily advancing toward gaining\r\na monopoly of the fur trade of the United States. Jonathan Carver, a\r\nBritish officer, had, more than thirty years before this, in company\r\nwith a British Member of Parliament named Whitworth, planned a route\r\nacross the continent. Had not the American Revolution commenced they\r\nwould have built a fort at Lake Pepin in Minnesota, gone up a tributary\r\nof the Mississippi to the West, till they could cross, as they thought\r\nwould be possible, to the Missouri, and ascending it have reached the\r\nRocky Mountain summit. At this point they expected to come upon a river,\r\nwhich they called the Oregon, that would take them to the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe plan projected by Carver was actually carried out by the well-known\r\nexplorers Lewis and Clark in 1804-6. Astor's penetrating mind now\r\nsaw the situation clearly. He would erect a line of trading posts up\r\nthe Missouri River and across the Rockies to the Columbia River on\r\nthe Pacific Coast and while those on the east of the Rockies would\r\nbe supplied from St. Louis, he would send ships to the mouth of the\r\nColumbia, and provide for the posts on the Pacific slope from the\r\nWest. With great skill Astor made approaches to the Russian Fur Company\r\non the Pacific Coast, offering his ships to supply their forts with all\r\nneeded articles, and he thus established a good feeling between himself\r\nand the Russians.\r\n\r\nThe only other element of danger to the mind of Astor was the opposition\r\nof the North-West Company on the Pacific Coast. He knew that for years\r\nthe Montreal merchants had had their eye on the region that their\r\npartner Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had discovered. Moreover, their agents,\r\nThompson, Fraser, Stuart, and Finlay the younger, were trading beyond\r\nthe summit of the Rockies in New Caledonia, but the fact that they were\r\nfarther north held out some hope to Astor that an arrangement might be\r\nmade with them. He accordingly broached the subject to the North-West\r\nCompany and proposed a combination with them similar to that in force\r\nin the co-operation in the South-West Company, viz. that they should\r\ntake a one-third interest in the Pacific Fur Company. After certain\r\ncorrespondence, the North-West Company declined the offer, no doubt\r\nhoping to forestall Astor in his occupation of the Columbia. They then\r\ngave orders to David Thompson to descend the Columbia, whose upper\r\nwaters he had already occupied, and he would have done this had not a\r\nmutiny taken place among his men, which made his arrival at the mouth of\r\nthe Columbia a few months too late.\r\n\r\nAstor's thorough acquaintance with the North-West Company and its\r\nnumerous employés stood him in good stead in his project of forming\r\na company. After full negotiations he secured the adhesion to his\r\nscheme of a number of well-known Nor'-Westers. Prominent among these\r\nwas Alexander McKay, who was Sir Alexander Mackenzie's most trusted\r\nassociate in the great journey of 1793 to the Pacific Ocean. McKay\r\nhad become a partner of the North-West Company, and left it to join\r\nthe Pacific Fur Company. Most celebrated as being in charge of the\r\nAstor enterprise on the coast was Duncan McDougall, who also left the\r\nNorth-West Company to embark in Astor's undertaking. Two others, David\r\nStuart and his nephew Robert Stuart, made the four partners of the new\r\nCompany who were to embark from New York with the purpose of doubling\r\nthe Cape and reaching the mouth of the Columbia.\r\n\r\nA company of clerks and _engagés_ had been obtained in Montreal, and\r\nthe party leaving Canada went in their great canoe up Lake Champlain,\r\ntook it over the portage to the Hudson, and descended that river to New\r\nYork. They transferred the picturesque scene so often witnessed on the\r\nOttawa to the sleepy banks of the Hudson River, and with emblems flying,\r\nand singing songs of the voyageurs, surprised the spectators along the\r\nbanks. Arrived at New York the men with bravado expressed themselves as\r\nready to endure hardships. As Irving puts it, they declared \"they could\r\nlive hard, lie hard, sleep hard, eat dogs--in short, endure anything.\"\r\n\r\nBut these partners and men had much love for their own country and\r\nlittle regard to the new service into which desire for gain had led them\r\nto embark. It was found out afterwards that two of the partners had\r\ncalled upon the British Ambassador in New York, had revealed to him the\r\nwhole scheme of Mr. Astor, and enquired whether, as British subjects,\r\nthey might embark in the enterprise. The reply of the diplomat assured\r\nthem of their full liberty in the matter. Astor also required of the\r\nemployés that they should become naturalized citizens of the United\r\nStates. They professed to have gone through the ceremony required, but\r\nit is contended that they never really did so.\r\n\r\nThe ship in which the party was to sail was the _Tonquin_, commanded by\r\na Captain Thorn, a somewhat stern officer, with whom the fur traders had\r\nmany conflicts on their outbound journey. The report having gone abroad\r\nthat a British cruiser from Halifax would come down upon the _Tonquin_\r\nand arrest the Canadians on board her, led to the application being\r\nmade to the United States frigate _Constitution_ to give the vessel\r\nprotection. On September 10th, 1810, the _Tonquin_ with her convoy put\r\nout and sailed for the Southern Main.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the constant irritation between the captain and his\r\nfur trading passengers, the vessel went bravely on her way. After\r\ndoubling Cape Horn on Christmas Day, they reached the Sandwich Islands\r\nin February, and after paying visits of ceremony to the king, obtained\r\nthe necessary supplies of hogs, fruits, vegetables, and water from the\r\ninhabitants, and also engaged some twenty-four of the islanders, or\r\nKanakas, as they are called, to go as employés to the Columbia.\r\n\r\nLike a number of rollicking lads, the Nor'-Westers made very free\r\nwith the natives, to the disgust of Captain Thorn. He writes:--\"They\r\nsometimes dress in red coats and otherwise very fantastically, and\r\ncollecting a number of ignorant natives around them, tell them they are\r\nthe great chiefs of the North-West ... then dressing in Highland plaids\r\nand kilts, and making bargains with the natives, with presents of rum,\r\nwine, or anything that is at hand.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 28th the _Tonquin_ set sail from the Sandwich Islands.\r\nThe discontent broke out again, and the fur traders engaged in a mock\r\nmutiny, which greatly alarmed the suspicious captain. They spoke to\r\neach other in Gaelic, had long conversations, and the captain kept an\r\never-watchful eye upon them; but on March 22nd they arrived at the mouth\r\nof the Columbia River.\r\n\r\nMcKay and McDougall, as senior partners, disembarked, visited the\r\nvillage of the Chinooks, and were warmly welcomed by Comcomly, the\r\nchief of that tribe. The chief treated them hospitably and encouraged\r\ntheir settling in his neighbourhood. Soon they had chosen a site for\r\ntheir fort, and with busy hands they cut down trees, cleared away\r\nthickets, and erected a residence, stone-house, and powder magazine,\r\nwhich was not, however, at first surrounded with palisades. In honour\r\nof the promoter of their enterprise, they very naturally called the new\r\nsettlement Astoria.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the new fort had assumed something like order, the _Tonquin_,\r\naccording to the original design, was despatched up the coast to trade\r\nwith the Indians for furs. Alexander McKay took charge of the trade, and\r\nsought to make the most of the honest but crusty captain. The vessel\r\nsailed on July 5th, 1811, on what proved to be a disastrous journey.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she was gone reports began to reach the traders at Astoria\r\nthat a body of white men were building a fort far up the Columbia.\r\nThis was serious news, for if true it meant that the supply of furs\r\nlooked for at Astoria would be cut off. An effort was made to find out\r\nthe truth of the rumour, without success, but immediately after came\r\ndefinite information that the North-West Company agents were erecting\r\na post at Spokane. We have already seen that this was none other\r\nthan David Thompson, the emissary of the North-West Company, sent to\r\nforestall the building of Astor's fort.\r\n\r\nThough too late to fulfil his mission, on July 15th the doughty\r\nastronomer and surveyor, in his canoe manned by eight men and having the\r\nBritish ensign flying, stopped in front of the new fort. Thompson was\r\ncordially received by McDougall, to the no small disgust of the other\r\nemployés of the Astor Company. After waiting for eight days, Thompson,\r\nhaving received supplies and goods from McDougall, started on his return\r\njourney. With him journeyed up the river David Stuart, who, with eight\r\nmen, was proceeding on a fur-trading expedition. Among his clerks was\r\nAlexander Ross, who has left a veracious history of the \"First Settlers\r\non the Oregon.\" Stuart had little confidence in Thompson, and by a\r\ndevice succeeded in getting him to proceed on his journey and leave him\r\nto choose his own site for a fort. Going up to within 140 miles of the\r\nSpokane River, and at the junction of the Okanagan and Columbia, Stuart\r\nerected a temporary fort to carry on his first season's trade.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the _Tonquin_ had gone on her way up the coast. The\r\nIndians were numerous, but were difficult to deal with, being impudent\r\nand greedy. A number of them had come upon the deck of the _Tonquin_,\r\nand Captain Thorn, being wearied with their slowness in bargaining and\r\nfulness of wiles, had grown impatient with the chief and had violently\r\nthrown him over the side of the ship. The Indians no doubt intended\r\nto avenge this insult. Next morning early, a multitude of canoes came\r\nabout the _Tonquin_ and many savages clambered upon the deck. Suddenly\r\nan attack was made upon the fur traders. Alexander McKay was one of the\r\nfirst to fall, being knocked down by a war club. Captain Thorn fought\r\ndesperately, killing the young chief of the band, and many others, until\r\nat last he was overcome by numbers. The remnant of the crew succeeded\r\nin getting control of the ship and, by discharging some of the deck\r\nguns, drove off the savages. Next morning the ship was all quiet as\r\nthe Indians came about her. The ship's clerk, Mr. Lewis, who had been\r\nseverely wounded, appeared on deck and invited them on board. Soon the\r\nwhole deck was crowded by the Indians, who thought they would secure a\r\nprize. Suddenly a dreadful explosion took place. The gunpowder magazine\r\nhad blown up, and Lewis and upward of one hundred savages were hurled\r\ninto eternity. It was a fierce revenge! Four white men of the crew\r\nwho had escaped in a boat were captured and terribly tortured by the\r\nmaddened Indian survivors. An Indian interpreter alone was spared to\r\nreturn to Astoria to relate the tale of treachery and blood.\r\n\r\nAstor's plan involved, however, the sending of another expedition\r\noverland to explore the country and lay out his projected chain of\r\nforts. In charge of this party was William P. Hunt, of Trenton,\r\nNew Jersey, who had been selected by Astor, as being a native-born\r\nAmerican, to be next to himself in authority in the Company. Hunt had no\r\nexperience as a fur trader, but was a man of decision and perseverance.\r\nWith him was closely associated Donald McKenzie, who had been in the\r\nservice of the North-West Company, but had been induced to join in the\r\npartnership with Astor.\r\n\r\nHunt and McKenzie arrived in Montreal on June 10th, 1811, and engaged a\r\nnumber of voyageurs to accompany them. With these in a great canoe the\r\nparty left the church of La Bonne Ste. Anne, on Montreal Island, and\r\nascended the Ottawa. By the usual route Michilimackinac was reached, and\r\nhere again other members of the party were enlisted. The party was also\r\nreinforced by the addition of a young Scotchman of energy and ability,\r\nRamsay Crooks, and with him an experienced and daring Missouri trader\r\nnamed Robert McLellan. At Mackinaw as well as at Montreal the influence\r\nof the North-West Company was so strong that men engaged for the journey\r\nwere as a rule those of the poorest quality. Thus were the difficulties\r\nof the overland party increased by the Falstaffian rabble that attended\r\nthe well-chosen leaders.\r\n\r\nThe party left Mackinaw, crossed to the Mississippi, and reached St.\r\nLouis in September.\r\n\r\nAt St. Louis the explorers came into touch with the Missouri Company, of\r\nwhich we have spoken. The same hidden opposition that had met them in\r\nMontreal and Mackinaw was here encountered. Nothing was said, but it\r\nwas difficult to get information, hard to induce voyageurs to Join them,\r\nand delay after delay occurred. Near the end of October St. Louis was\r\nleft behind and the Missouri ascended for 450 miles to a fort Nodowa,\r\nwhen the party determined to winter. During the winter Hunt returned to\r\nSt. Louis and endeavoured to enlist additional men for his expedition.\r\nIn this he still had the opposition of a Spaniard, Manuel de Lisa, who\r\nwas the leading spirit in the Missouri Company. After some difficulty\r\nHunt engaged an interpreter, Pierre Dorion, a drunken French half-breed,\r\nwho was, however, expert and even accomplished in his work.\r\n\r\nA start was at last made in January, and Irving tells us of the\r\nexpedition meeting Daniel Boone, the famous old hunter of Kentucky, one\r\nwho gloried in keeping abreast of the farthest line of the frontier, a\r\ntrapper and hunter. The party went on its way ascending the river, and\r\nwas accompanied by the somewhat disagreeable companion Lisa. At length\r\nthey reached the country of the Anckaras, who, like the Parthians of\r\nold, seemed to live on horseback. After a council meeting the distrust\r\nof Lisa disappeared, and a bargain was struck between the Spaniard and\r\nthe explorer by which he would supply them with 130 horses and take\r\ntheir boats in exchange. Leaving in August the party went westward,\r\nkeeping south at first to avoid the Blackfeet, and then, turning\r\nnorthward till they reached an old trading post just beyond the summit.\r\n\r\nThe descent was now to be made to the coast, but none of them had the\r\nslightest conception of the difficulties before them. They divided\r\nthemselves into four parties, under the four leaders, McKenzie,\r\nMcLellan, Hunt, and Crooks. The two former took the right bank, the two\r\nlatter the left bank of the river. For three weeks they followed the\r\nrugged banks of this stream, which, from its fierceness, they spoke of\r\nas the \"Mad River.\" Their provisions soon became exhausted and they were\r\nreduced to the dire necessity of eating the leather of their shoes.\r\nAfter a separation of some days the plan was struck upon by Mr. Hunt\r\nof gaining communication across the river by a boat covered with horse\r\nskin. This failed, and the unfortunate voyageur attempting to cross in\r\nit was drowned. After a time the Lewis River was reached. Trading off\r\ntheir horses, McKenzie's party, which was on the right bank, obtained\r\ncanoes from the natives, and at length on January 18th, 1812, this party\r\nreached Astoria. Ross Cox says: \"Their concave cheeks, protuberant\r\nbones, and tattered garments strongly indicated the dreadful extent\r\nof their privations; but their health appeared uninjured and their\r\ngastronomic powers unimpaired.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the disaster of the horse-skin boat the two parties lost sight of\r\none another. Mr. Hunt had the easier bank of the river, and, falling in\r\nwith friendly Indians, he delayed for ten days and rested his wearied\r\nparty. Though afterward delayed, Hunt, with his following of thirty men,\r\none woman, and two children, arrived at Astoria, to the great delight of\r\nhis companions, on February 15th, 1812.\r\n\r\nVarious accounts have been given of the journey. Those of Ross Cox and\r\nAlexander Ross are the work of actual members of the Astor Company,\r\nthough not of the party which really crossed. Washington Irving's\r\n\"Astoria\" is regarded as a pleasing fiction, and he is very truly spoken\r\nof by Dr. Coues, the editor of Henry and Thompson's journals, in the\r\nfollowing fashion:--\"No story of travel is more familiar to the public\r\nthan the tale told by Irving of this adventure, because none is more\r\nreadable as a romance founded upon fact.... Irving plies his golden\r\npen elastically, and from it flow wit and humour, stirring scene, and\r\nstartling incident, character to the life. But he never tells us where\r\nthose people went, perhaps for the simple reason that he never knew. He\r\nwafts us westward on his strong plume, and we look down on those hapless\r\nAstorians; but we might as well be ballooning for aught of exactitude we\r\ncan make of this celebrated itinerary.\"\r\n\r\nIn October, 1811, the second party by sea left New York on the ship\r\n_Beaver_, to join the traders at the mouth of the Columbia. Ross Cox,\r\nwho was one of the clerks, gives a most interesting account of the\r\nvoyage and of the affairs of the Company. With him were six other cabin\r\npassengers. The ship was commanded by Captain Sowles. The voyage was on\r\nthe whole a prosperous one, and Cape Horn was doubled on New Year's\r\nDay, 1812. More than a month after, the ship called at Juan Fernandez,\r\nand two months after crossed the Equator. Three weeks afterward she\r\nreached the Sandwich Islands, and on April 9th, after a further voyage,\r\narrived at the mouth of the Columbia.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Astoria the newcomers had many things to see and learn,\r\nbut they were soon under way, preparing for their future work. There\r\nwere many risks in thus venturing away from their fort. Chief Trader\r\nMcDougall had indeed found the fort itself threatened after the disaster\r\nof the _Tonquin_. He had, however, boldly grappled with the case. Having\r\nfew of his company to support him, he summoned the Indians to meet him.\r\nIn their presence he informed them that he understood they were plotting\r\nagainst him, but, drawing a corked bottle from his pocket, he said:\r\n\"This bottle contains smallpox. I have but to draw out the cork and at\r\nonce you will be seized by the plague.\" They implored him to spare them\r\nand showed no more hostility.\r\n\r\nSuch recitals as this, and the sad story of the _Tonquin_ related to\r\nRoss Cox and his companions, naturally increased their nervousness as to\r\npenetrating the interior.\r\n\r\nThe _Beaver_ had sailed for Canton with furs, and the party of the\r\ninterior was organized with three proprietors, Ramsay Crooks, Robert\r\nMcLellan, and Robert Stuart, who, with eight men, were to cross the\r\nmountains to St. Louis. At the fort there remained Mr. Hunt, Duncan\r\nMcDougall, B. Clapp, J. C. Halsey, and Gabriel Franchère, the last of\r\nwhom wrote an excellent account in French of the Astor Company affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nLORD SELKIRK'S COLONY.\r\n\r\n     Alexander Mackenzie's book--Lord Selkirk\r\n     interested--Emigration a boon--Writes to Imperial Government--In\r\n     1802 looks to Lake Winnipeg--Benevolent project of trade--Compelled\r\n     to choose Prince Edward Island--Opinions as to Hudson's Bay\r\n     Company's charter--Nor'-Westers alarmed--Hudson's Bay Company's\r\n     Stock--Purchases _Assiniboia_--Advertises the new colony--Religion\r\n     no disqualification--Sends first colony--Troubles of the\r\n     project--Arrive at York Factory--The winter--The mutiny--\"Essence\r\n     of Malt\"--Journey inland--A second party--Third party under\r\n     Archibald Macdonald--From Helmsdale--The number of colonists.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe publication of his work by Alexander Mackenzie, entitled, \"Voyages\r\nfrom Montreal through the Continent of North America, &c.,\" awakened\r\ngreat interest in the British Isles. Among those who were much\r\ninfluenced by it was Thomas, Earl of Selkirk, a young Scottish nobleman\r\nof distinguished descent and disposition. The young Earl at once thought\r\nof the wide country described as a fitting home for the poor and\r\nunsuccessful British peasantry, who, as we learn from Wordsworth, were\r\nat this time in a most distressful state.\r\n\r\nDuring his college days the Earl of Selkirk had often visited the\r\nHighland glens and crofts, and though himself a Southron, he was so\r\ninterested in his picturesque countrymen that he learned the Gaelic\r\nlanguage. Not only the sad condition of Scotland, but likewise the\r\nunsettled state of Ireland, appealed to his heart and his patriotic\r\nsympathies. He came to the conclusion that emigration was the remedy for\r\nthe ills of Scotland and Ireland alike.\r\n\r\nAccordingly we find the energetic Earl writing to Lord Pelham to\r\ninterest the British Government in the matter. We have before us a\r\nletter with two memorials attached. This is dated April 4th, 1802,\r\nand was kindly supplied the writer by the Colonial Office. The\r\nproposals, after showing the desirability of relieving the congested and\r\ndissatisfied population already described, go on to speak of a suitable\r\nfield for the settlement of the emigrants. And this we see is the\r\nregion described by Alexander Mackenzie. Lord Selkirk says: \"No large\r\ntract remains unoccupied on the sea-coast of British America except\r\nbarren and frozen deserts. To find a sufficient extent of good soil in\r\na temperate climate we must go far inland. This inconvenience is not,\r\nhowever, an insurmountable obstacle to the prosperity of a colony, and\r\nappears to be amply compensated by other advantages that are to be found\r\nin some remote parts of the British territory. At the western extremity\r\nof Canada, upon the waters which fall into Lake Winnipeg and which in\r\nthe great river of Port Nelson discharge themselves into Hudson Bay,\r\nis a country which the Indian traders represent as fertile, and of a\r\nclimate far more temperate than the shores of the Atlantic under the\r\nsame parallel, and not more severe than that of Germany or Poland. Here,\r\ntherefore, the colonists may, with a moderate exertion of industry,\r\nbe certain of a comfortable subsistence, and they may also raise some\r\nvaluable objects of exportation.... To a colony in these territories the\r\nchannel of trade must be the river of Port Nelson.\"\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly interesting, in view of the part afterwards played by\r\nLord Selkirk, to read the following statement: \"The greatest impediment\r\nto a colony in this quarter seems to be the Hudson's Bay Company\r\nmonopoly, which the possessors cannot be expected easily to relinquish.\r\nThey may, however, be amply indemnified for its abolition without any\r\nburden, perhaps even with advantage to the revenue.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter then goes on to state the successful trade carried on by the\r\nCanadian traders, and gives a scheme by which both the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany and the North-West Company may receive profits greater than\r\nthose then enjoyed, by a plan of issuing licences, and limiting traders\r\nto particular districts.\r\n\r\nFurther, the proposal declares: \"If these indefatigable Canadians were\r\nallowed the free navigation of the Hudson Bay they might, without going\r\nso far from Port Nelson as they now go from Montreal, extend their\r\ntraffic from sea to sea, through the whole northern part of America,\r\nand send home more than double the value that is now derived from that\r\nregion.\"\r\n\r\nThe matter brought up in these proposals was referred to Lord\r\nBuckinghamshire, Colonial Secretary, but failed for the time being,\r\nnot because of any unsuitableness of the country, but \"because the\r\nprejudices of the British people were so strong against emigration.\"\r\nDuring the next year Lord Selkirk succeeded in organizing a Highland\r\nemigration of not less than 800 souls. Not long before the starting of\r\nthe ships the British Government seems to have interfered to prevent\r\nthis large number being led to the region of Lake Winnipeg, and\r\ncompelled Lord Selkirk to choose the more accessible shore of Prince\r\nEdward Island. After settling his colonists on the island, Lord Selkirk\r\nvisited Montreal, where he was well received by the magnates of the\r\nNorth-West Company, and where his interest in the far West was increased\r\nby witnessing, as Astor also did about the same time, the large returns\r\nobtained by the \"lords of the lakes and forests.\"\r\n\r\nYears went past, and Lord Selkirk, unable to obtain the assent of the\r\nBritish Government to his great scheme of colonizing the interior\r\nof North America, at length determined to obtain possession of the\r\nterritory wanted for his plans through the agency of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany. About the year 1810 he began to turn his attention in earnest\r\nto the matter.\r\n\r\nWith characteristic Scottish caution he submitted the charter of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company to the highest legal authorities in London,\r\nincluding the names Romilly, Holroyd, Cruise, Scarlett, and John Bell.\r\nTheir clear opinion was that the Hudson's Bay Company was legally able\r\nto sell its territory and to transfer the numerous rights bestowed by\r\nthe charter. They say, \"We are of opinion that the grant of the soil\r\ncontained in the charter is good, and that it will include all the\r\ncountry, the waters of which run into Hudson Bay, as ascertained by\r\ngeographical observation.\"\r\n\r\nLord Selkirk, now fully satisfied that the Hudson's Bay Company was a\r\nsatisfactory instrument, proceeded to obtain control of the stock of the\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nThe partners of the North-West Company learned of the steps being taken\r\nby Lord Selkirk and became greatly alarmed. They were of the opinion\r\nthat the object of Lord Selkirk was to make use of his great emigration\r\nscheme to give supremacy to the Hudson's Bay Company over its rivals,\r\nand to injure the Nor'-Westers' fur trade. So far as can be seen, Lord\r\nSelkirk had no interest in the rivalry that had been going on between\r\nthe Companies for more than a generation. His first aim was emigration,\r\nand this for the purpose of relieving the distress of many in the\r\nBritish Isles.\r\n\r\nAs showing the mind of Lord Selkirk in the matter we have before us a\r\ncopy of his lordship's work on emigration published in 1805. This copy\r\nis a gift to the writer from Lady Isabella Hope, the late daughter of\r\nLord Selkirk. In this octavo volume, upwards of 280 pages, the whole\r\nquestion of the state of the Highlands is ably described. Tracing\r\nthe condition of the Highlanders from the Rebellion of 1745, and the\r\nnecessity of emigration, Lord Selkirk refers to the demand for keeping\r\nup the Highland regiments as being less than formerly, and that the\r\nHighland proprietors had been opposed to emigration.\r\n\r\nHis patriotism was also stirred in favour of preventing the flow of\r\nBritish subjects to the United States, and in his desire to see the\r\nBritish possessions, especially in America, filled up with loyal British\r\nsubjects. He states that in his Prince Edward Island Company in 1803 he\r\nhad succeeded in securing a number from the Isle of Skye, whose friends\r\nhad largely gone to North Carolina, and that others of them were from\r\nRoss, Argyle, and Inverness, and that the friends of these had chiefly\r\ngone to the United States.\r\n\r\nAfter going into some detail as to the management of his Prince Edward\r\nIsland Highlanders, he speaks of the success of his experiment, and\r\ngives us proof of his consuming interest in the progress and happiness\r\nof his poor fellow-countrymen. It is consequently almost beyond doubt\r\nthe fact that it was his desire for carrying out his emigration scheme\r\nthat led him to obtain control of the Hudson's Bay Company, and not the\r\ndesire to introduce a colony to injure the North-West trade, as charged.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt of Lord Selkirk's thoroughly patriotic and lofty\r\naims. In 1808 he published a brochure of some eighty pages on \"A System\r\nof National Defence.\" In this he shows the value of a local militia and\r\nproposes a plan for the maintenance of a sufficient force to protect\r\nGreat Britain from its active enemy, Napoleon. He maintains that a\r\nVolunteer force would not be permanent; and that under any semblance\r\nof peace that establishment must immediately fall to pieces. His only\r\ndependence for the safety of the country is in a local militia.\r\n\r\nWith his plan somewhat matured, he continued in 1810 to obtain\r\npossession of stock of the Company, and succeeded in having much of\r\nit in the hands of his friends. By May, 1811, he had with his friends\r\nacquired, it is said, not less than 35,000_l._ of the total stock,\r\n105,000_l._ sterling. A general court of the proprietors was called for\r\nMay 30th, and the proposition was made by Lord Selkirk to purchase a\r\ntract of land lying in the wide expanse of Rupert's Land and on the Red\r\nRiver of the North, to settle, within a limited time, a large colony on\r\ntheir lands and to assume the expense of transport, of outlay for the\r\nsettlers, of government, of protection, and of quieting the Indian title\r\nto the lands. At the meeting there was represented about 45,000_l._\r\nworth of stock, and the vote on being taken showed the representatives\r\nof nearly 30,000_l._ of the stock to be in favour of accepting Lord\r\nSelkirk's proposal. Among those who voted with the enterprising Earl\r\nwere his kinsmen, Andrew Wedderburn, Esq. (having nearly 4,500_l._\r\nstock), William Mainwaring, the Governor Joseph Berens, Deputy-Governor\r\nJohn Henry Pelly, and many other well-known proprietors.\r\n\r\nThe opposition was, however, by no means insignificant, William\r\nThwaytes, representing nearly 10,000_l._, voted against the proposal, as\r\ndid also Robert Whitehead, who held 3,000_l._ stock. The most violent\r\nopponents, however, were the Nor'-Westers who were in England at the\r\ntime. Two of them had only purchased stock within forty-eight hours of\r\nthe meeting. These were Alexander Mackenzie, John Inglis, and Edward\r\nEllice, the three together representing less than 2,500_l._\r\n\r\nThe projector of the colony having now beaten down all opposition,\r\nforthwith proceeded to carry out his great plan of colonization. His\r\nproject has, of course, been greatly criticized. He has been called \"a\r\nkind-hearted but visionary Scottish nobleman,\" and his relative, Sir\r\nJames Wedderburn, spoke of him fifty years afterwards as \"a remarkable\r\nman, who had the misfortune to live before his time.\" Certainly Lord\r\nSelkirk met with gigantic difficulties, but these were rather from the\r\nNorth-West Company than from any untimeliness in his emigration scheme.\r\n\r\nLord Selkirk soon issued the advertisement and prospectus of the new\r\ncolony. He held forth the advantage to be derived from joining the\r\ncolony. His policy was very comprehensive. He said: \"The settlement is\r\nto be formed in a territory where religion is not the ground of any\r\ndisqualification; an unreserved participation in every privilege will\r\ntherefore be enjoyed by Protestant and Catholic without distinction.\"\r\n\r\nThe area of the new settlement was said to consist of 110,000 square\r\nmiles on the Red and Assiniboine Rivers, and one of the most fertile\r\ndistricts of North America. The name Assiniboia was given it from the\r\nAssiniboine, and steps were taken immediately to organize a government\r\nfor the embryo colony.\r\n\r\nActive measures were then taken by the Earl of Selkirk to advance his\r\nscheme, and it was determined to send out the first colony immediately.\r\nSome years before, Lord Selkirk had carried on a correspondence with\r\na U. E. Loyalist colonist, Miles Macdonell, formerly an officer of\r\nthe King's Royal Regiment of New York, who had been given the rank of\r\ncaptain in the Canadian Militia. Macdonell's assistance was obtained in\r\nthe new enterprise, and he was appointed by his lordship to superintend\r\nhis colony at Red River.\r\n\r\nMany incorrect statements have been made about the different bands of\r\ncolonists which found their way to Red River. No less than four parties\r\narrived at Red River by way of York or Churchill Factories between\r\nthe years 1811 and 1815. Facts connected with one of them have been\r\nnaturally confused in the memories of the old settlers on Red River with\r\nwhat happened to other bands. In this way the author has found that\r\nrepresentations made to him and embodied in his work on \"Manitoba,\"\r\npublished in 1882, were in several particulars incorrect. Fortunately in\r\nlate years the letter-book of Captain Miles Macdonell was acquired from\r\nthe Misses Macdonell of Brockville, and the voluminous correspondence of\r\nLord Selkirk has been largely copied for the Archives at Ottawa. These\r\nletters enable us to give a clear and accurate account of the first band\r\nof colonists that found its way to the heart of the Continent and began\r\nthe Red River settlement.\r\n\r\nIn the end of June, 1811, Captain Miles Macdonell found himself at\r\nYarmouth, on the east coast of England, with a fleet of three vessels\r\nsent out by the Hudson's Bay Company for their regular trade and also\r\nto carry the first colonists. These vessels were the _Prince of Wales_,\r\nthe _Eddystone_, and an old craft the _Edward and Anne_, with \"old sail\r\nropes, &c., and very badly manned.\" This extra vessel was evidently\r\nintended for the accommodation of the colonists. By the middle of July\r\nthe little fleet had reached the Pentland Firth and were compelled to\r\nput into Stromness, when the _Prince of Wales_ embarked a number of\r\nOrkneymen intended for the Company's service. The men of the Hudson's\r\nBay Company at this time were largely drawn from the Orkney Islands.\r\n\r\nProceeding on their way the fleet made rendezvous at Stornoway, the\r\nchief town of Lewis, one of the Hebrides. Here had arrived a number\r\nof colonists or employés, some from Sligo, others from Glasgow, and\r\nothers from different parts of the Highlands. Many influences were\r\noperating against the success of the colonizing expedition. It had the\r\nstrenuous opposition of Sir Alexander Mackenzie, then in Britain, and\r\nthe newspapers contained articles intended to discourage and dissuade\r\npeople from embarking in the enterprise. Mr. Reid, collector of Customs\r\nat Stornoway, whose wife was an aunt of Sir Alexander Mackenzie, threw\r\nevery impediment in the way of the project, and some of those engaged by\r\nLord Selkirk were actually lured away by enlisting agents. A so-called\r\n\"Captain\" Mackenzie, denominated a \"mean fellow,\" came alongside the\r\n_Edward and Anne_, which had some seventy-six men aboard--Glasgow men,\r\nIrish, \"and a few from Orkney\"--and claimed some of them as \"deserters\r\nfrom Her Majesty's service.\" The demand was, however, resisted. It is\r\nno wonder that in his letter to Lord Selkirk Captain Macdonell writes,\r\n\"All the men that we shall have are now embarked, but it has been an\r\nherculean task.\"\r\n\r\nA prominent employé of the expedition, Mr. Moncrieff Blair, posing as\r\na gentleman, deserted on July 25th, the day before the sailing of the\r\nvessels. A number of the deserters at Stornoway had left their effects\r\non board, and these were disposed of by sale among the passengers.\r\nAmong the officers was a Mr. Edwards, who acted as medical man of the\r\nexpedition. He had his hands completely full during the voyage and\r\nreturned to England with the ships. Another notable person on board was\r\na Roman Catholic priest, known as Father Bourke. Captain Macdonell was\r\nhimself a Roman Catholic, but he seems from the first to have had no\r\nconfidence in the priest, who, he stated, had \"come away without the\r\nleave of his bishop, who was at the time at Dublin.\" Father Bourke,\r\nwe shall see, though carried safely to the shores of Hudson Bay,\r\nnever reached the interior, but returned to Britain in the following\r\nyear. After the usual incidents of \"an uncommon share of boisterous,\r\nstormy, and cold weather\" on the ocean, the ships entered Hudson Bay.\r\nExperiencing \"a course of fine mild weather and moderate fair winds,\" on\r\nSeptember 24th the fleet reached the harbour of York Factory, after a\r\nvoyage of sixty-one days out from Stornoway, the _Eddystone_, which was\r\nintended to go to Churchill, not having been able to reach that Factory,\r\ncoming with the other vessels to York Factory.\r\n\r\nThe late arrival of the colony on the shores of Hudson Bay made it\r\nimpossible to ascend the Nelson River and reach the interior during the\r\nseason of 1811. Accordingly Captain Macdonell made preparations for\r\nwintering on the Bay. York Factory would not probably have afforded\r\nsufficient accommodation for the colonists, but in addition Captain\r\nMacdonell states in a letter to Lord Selkirk that \"the factory is\r\nvery ill constructed and not at all adapted for a cold country.\"\r\nIn consequence of these considerations, Captain Macdonell at once\r\nundertook, during the fair weather of the season yet remaining, to build\r\nwinter quarters on the north side of the river, at a distance of some\r\nmiles from the Factory. No doubt matters of discipline entered into the\r\nplans of the leader of the colonists. In a short time very comfortable\r\ndwellings were erected, built of round logs, the front side high with a\r\nshade roof sloping to the rear a foot thick--and the group of huts was\r\nknown as \"Nelson encampment!\"\r\n\r\nThe chief work during the earlier winter, which the captain laid on his\r\ntwo score men, was providing themselves with fuel, of which there was\r\nplenty, and obtaining food from the Factory, for which sledges drawn\r\nover the snow were utilized by the detachments sent on this service. The\r\nmost serious difficulty was, however, a meeting, in which a dozen or\r\nmore of the men became completely insubordinate, and refused to yield\r\nobedience either to Captain Macdonell or to Mr. W. H. Cook, the Governor\r\nof the Factory. Every effort was made to maintain discipline, but the\r\nmen steadily held to their own way, lived apart from Macdonell, and drew\r\ntheir own provisions from the fort to their huts. This tended to make\r\nthe winter somewhat long and disagreeable.\r\n\r\nCaptain Macdonell, being a Canadian, knew well the dangers of the\r\ndread disease of the scurvy attacking his inexperienced colonists.\r\nThe men at the fort prophesied evil things in this respect for the\r\n\"encampment.\" The captain took early steps to meet the disease, and his\r\nletters to Governor Cook always contain demands for \"essence of malt,\"\r\n\"crystallized salts of lemon,\" and other anti-scorbutics. Though some of\r\nhis men were attacked, yet the sovereign remedy so often employed in the\r\n\"lumber camps\" of America, the juice of the white spruce, was applied\r\nwith almost magical effect. As the winter went on, plenty of venison was\r\nreceived, and the health of his wintering party was in the spring much\r\nbetter than could have been anticipated.\r\n\r\nAfter the New Year had come, all thoughts were directed to preparations\r\nfor the journey of 700 miles or thereabouts to the interior. A number\r\nof boats were required for transportation of the colonists and their\r\neffects. Captain Macdonell insisted on his boats being made after\r\na different style from the boats commonly used at that time by the\r\nCompany. His model was the flat boat, which he had seen used in the\r\nMohawk River in the State of New York. The workmanship displayed in the\r\nmaking of these boats very much dissatisfied Captain Macdonell, and he\r\nconstantly complained of the indolence of the workmen. In consequence of\r\nthis inefficiency the cost of the boats to Lord Selkirk was very great,\r\nand drew forth the objections of the leader of the colony.\r\n\r\nCaptain Macdonell had the active assistance of Mr. Cook, the officer in\r\ncharge of York, and of Mr. Auld, the Commander of Churchill, the latter\r\nhaving come down to York to make arrangements for the inland journey\r\nof the colonists. By July 1st, 1812, the ice had moved from the river,\r\nand the expedition started soon after on the journey to Red River. The\r\nnew settlers found the route a hard and trying one with its rapids and\r\nportages. The boats, too, were heavy, and the colonists inexperienced in\r\nmanaging them. It was well on toward autumn when the company, numbering\r\nabout seventy, reached the Red River. No special preparation had been\r\nmade for the colonists, and the winter would soon be upon them. Some\r\nof the parties were given shelter in the Company fort and buildings,\r\nothers in the huts of the freed men, who were married to the Indian\r\nwomen, and settled in the neighbourhood of the Forks, while others still\r\nfound refuge in the tents of the Indian encampment in the vicinity.\r\nGovernor Macdonell soon selected Point Douglas as the future centre of\r\nthe colony and what is now Kildonan as the settlement. On account of the\r\nwant of food the settlers were taken sixty miles south to Pembina and\r\nthere, by November, a post, called Fort Daer from one of Lord Selkirk's\r\ntitles, was erected for the shelter of the people and for nearness to\r\nthe buffalo herds. The Governor Joined the colony in a short time and\r\nretired with them early in 1813 to their settlement.\r\n\r\nWhile Governor Macdonell was thus early engaged in making a beginning\r\nin the new colony, Lord Selkirk was seeking out more colonists, and\r\nsent out a small number to the New World by the Hudson's Bay Company\r\nships. Before sailing from Stornoway the second party met with serious\r\ninterruption from the collector of Customs, who, we have seen, was\r\nrelated to Sir Alexander Mackenzie. The number on board the ships was\r\ngreater, it was claimed, than the \"Dundas Act\" permitted. Through the\r\ninfluence of Lord Selkirk the ships were allowed to proceed on their\r\nvoyage. Prison fever, it is said, broke out on the voyage, so that a\r\nnumber died at sea, and others on the shore of Hudson Bay. A small\r\nnumber, not more than fifteen or twenty, reached Red River in the autumn\r\nof 1813.\r\n\r\nDuring the previous winter Governor Macdonell had taken a number of the\r\ncolonists to Pembina, a point sixty miles south of the Forks, where\r\nbuffalo could be had, as has already been mentioned on the previous\r\npage. On returning, after the second winter, to the settlement, the\r\ncolonists sowed a small quantity of wheat. They were not, however, at\r\nthat time in possession of any horses or oxen and were consequently\r\ncompelled to prepare the ground with the hoe.\r\n\r\nLord Selkirk had not been anxious in 1812 to send a large addition to\r\nhis colony. In 1813 he made greater efforts, and in June sent out in\r\nthe _Prince of Wales_, sailing from Orkney, a party under Mr. Archibald\r\nMacdonald, numbering some ninety-three persons. Mr. Macdonald has\r\nwritten an account of his voyage, and has given us a remarkably concise\r\nand clear pamphlet. Having spent the winter at Churchill, Macdonald\r\nstarted on April 14th with a considerable number of his party, and,\r\ncoming by way of York Factory, reached Red River on June 22nd, when\r\nthey were able to plant some thirty or forty bushels of potatoes. The\r\nsettlers were in good spirits, having received plots of land to build\r\nhouses for themselves. Governor Macdonell went northward to meet the\r\nremainder of Archibald Macdonald's party, and arrived with them late in\r\nthe season.\r\n\r\nOn account of various misunderstandings between the colony and the\r\nNorth-West Company, which we shall relate more particularly in another\r\nchapter, 150 of the colonists were induced by a North-West officer,\r\nDuncan Cameron, to leave the country and go by a long canoe journey to\r\nCanada. The remainder, numbering about sixty persons, making up about\r\nthirteen families, were driven from the settlement, and found refuge at\r\nNorway House (Jack River) at the foot of Lake Winnipeg. An officer from\r\nLord Selkirk, Colin Robertson, arrived in the colony to assist these\r\nsettlers, but found them driven out. He followed them to Norway House,\r\nand with his twenty clerks and servants, conducted them back to Red\r\nRiver to their deserted homes.\r\n\r\nWhile these disastrous proceedings were taking place on Red River,\r\nincluding the summons to Governor Macdonell to appear before the Courts\r\nof Lower Canada to answer certain charges made against him, Lord Selkirk\r\nwas especially active in Great Britain, and gathered together the best\r\nband of settlers yet sent out. These were largely from the parish of\r\nKildonan, in Sutherlandshire, Scotland. Governor Macdonell having gone\r\neast to Canada, the colony was to be placed under a new Governor, a\r\nmilitary officer of some distinction, Robert Semple, who had travelled\r\nin different parts of the world. Governor Semple was in charge of this\r\nfourth party of colonists, who numbered about 100. With this party,\r\nhastening through his journey, Governor Semple reached his destination\r\non Red River in the month of October, in the same year in which they had\r\nleft the motherland.\r\n\r\nThus we have seen the arrival of those who were known as the Selkirk\r\ncolonists. We recapitulate their numbers:--\r\n\r\n  In 1811, reaching Red River in 1812                              70\r\n  In 1812, reaching Red River in 1813                        15 or 20\r\n  In 1813, reaching Red River in two parties in 1814               93\r\n  In 1815, reaching Red River in the same year                    100\r\n  Making deduction of the Irish settlers there were of the\r\n    Highland colonists about                                      270\r\n  Less those led by the North-West Company in 1814 to Canada      140\r\n  Permanent Highland settlers                                     130\r\n\r\nOf these but two remained on the banks of the Red River in 1897, George\r\nBannerman and John Matheson, and they have both died since that time.\r\n\r\nWe shall follow the history of these colonists further; suffice it now\r\nto say that their settlement has proved the country to be one of great\r\nfertility and promise; and their early establishment no doubt prevented\r\ninternational complications with the United States that might have\r\nrendered the possession of Rupert's Land a matter of uncertainty to\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTROUBLE BETWEEN THE COMPANIES.\r\n\r\n     Nor'-Westers oppose the colony--Reason why--A considerable\r\n     literature--Contentions of both parties--Both in fault--Miles\r\n     Macdonell's mistake--Nor'-Wester arrogance--Duncan Cameron's\r\n     ingenious plan--Stirring up the Chippewas--Nor'-Westers warn\r\n     colonists to depart--McLeod's hitherto unpublished narrative--Vivid\r\n     account of a brave defence--Chain shot from the blacksmith's\r\n     smithy--Fort Douglas begun--Settlers driven out--Governor Semple\r\n     arrives--Cameron last Governor of Fort Gibraltar--Cameron sent to\r\n     Britain as a prisoner--Fort Gibraltar captured--Fort Gibraltar\r\n     decreases, Fort Douglas increases--Free traders take to the\r\n     plains--Indians favour the colonists.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the most casual observer it must have been evident that the colony\r\nto be established by Lord Selkirk would be regarded with disfavour by\r\nthe North-West Company officers. The strenuous opposition shown to it in\r\nGreat Britain by Sir Alexander Mackenzie, and by all who were connected\r\nwith him, showed quite clearly that it would receive little favour on\r\nthe Red River.\r\n\r\nFirst, it was a Hudson's Bay scheme, and would greatly advance the\r\ninterests of the English trading Company. That Company would have at the\r\nvery threshold of the fur country a depôt, surrounded by traders and\r\nworkmen, which would give them a great advantage over their rivals.\r\n\r\nSecondly, civilization and its handmaid agriculture are incompatible\r\nwith the fur trade. As the settler enters, the fur-bearing animals are\r\nexterminated. A sparsely settled, almost unoccupied country, is the only\r\nhope of preserving this trade.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the claim of the Hudson's Bay Company under its charter was\r\nthat they had the sole right to pursue the fur trade in Rupert's Land.\r\nTheir traditional policy on Hudson Bay had been to drive out private\r\ntrade, and to preserve their monopoly.\r\n\r\nFourthly, the Nor'-Westers claimed to be the lineal successors of the\r\nFrench traders, who, under Verendrye, had opened up the region west of\r\nLake Superior. They long after maintained that priority of discovery and\r\nearlier possession gave them the right to claim the region in dispute as\r\nbelonging to the province of Quebec, and so as being a part of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe first and second parties of settlers were so small, and seemed so\r\nlittle able to cope with the difficulties of their situation, that no\r\ngreat amount of opposition was shown. They were made, it is true, the\r\nlaughing-stock of the half-breeds and Indians, for these free children\r\nof the prairies regarded the use of the hoe or other agricultural\r\nimplement as beneath them. The term \"Pork-eaters,\" applied, as we have\r\nseen, to the voyageurs east of Fort William, was freely applied to\r\nthese settlers, while the Indians used to call them the French name\r\n\"jardinières\" or clod-hoppers.\r\n\r\nA considerable literature is in existence dealing with the events of\r\nthis period. It is somewhat difficult, in the conflict of opinion,\r\nto reach a basis of certainty as to the facts of this contest.\r\nThe Indian country is proverbial for the prevalence of rumour and\r\nmisrepresentation. Moreover, prejudice and self-interest were mingled\r\nwith deep passion, so that the facts are very hard to obtain.\r\n\r\nThe upholders of the colony claim that no sooner had the settlers\r\narrived than efforts were made to stir up the Indians against them; that\r\nbesides, the agents of the North-West Company had induced the Metis, or\r\nhalf-breeds, to disguise themselves as Indians, and that on their way\r\nto Pembina one man was robbed by these desperadoes of the gun which his\r\nfather had carried at Culloden, a woman of her marriage ring, and others\r\nof various ornaments and valuable articles. There were, however, it is\r\nadmitted, no specially hostile acts noticeable during the years 1812 and\r\n1813.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of the North-West Company, on the other hand, blame the\r\nfirst aggression on Miles Macdonell. During the winter of 1813 and\r\n1814 Governor Macdonell and his colonists were occupying Fort Daer and\r\nPembina. The supply of subsistence from the buffalo was short, food\r\nwas difficult to obtain, the war with the United States was in progress\r\nand might cut off communication with Montreal, and moreover, a body of\r\ncolonists was expected to arrive during the year from Great Britain.\r\nAccordingly, the Governor, on January 8th, 1814, issued a proclamation.\r\n\r\nHe claimed the territory as ceded to Lord Selkirk, and gave the\r\ndescription of the tract thus transferred. The proclamation then goes\r\non to say: \"And whereas the welfare of the families at present forming\r\nthe settlements on the Red River within the said territory, with those\r\non their way to it, passing the winter at York or Churchill Forts on\r\nHudson Bay, as also those who are expected to arrive next autumn,\r\nrenders it a necessary and indispensable part of my duty to provide\r\nfor their support. The uncultivated state of the country, the ordinary\r\nresources derived from the buffalo, and other wild animals hunted within\r\nthe territory, are not deemed more than adequate for the requisite\r\nsupply; wherefore, it is hereby ordered that no persons trading in furs\r\nor provisions within the territory, for the Honourable the Hudson's\r\nBay Company, the North-West Company, or any individual or unconnected\r\ntraders whatever, shall take out any provisions, either of flesh, grain,\r\nor vegetables, procured or raised within the territory, by water or\r\nland-carriage for one twelvemonth from the date hereof; save and except\r\nwhat may be judged necessary for the trading parties at the present time\r\nwithin the territory, to carry them to their respective destinations,\r\nand who may, on due application to me, obtain licence for the same. The\r\nprovisions procured and raised as above, shall be taken for the use of\r\nthe colony, and that no losses may accrue to the parties concerned, they\r\nwill be paid for by British bills at the customary rates, &c.\"\r\n\r\nThe Nor'-Westers then recalled the ceremonies with which Governor\r\nMacdonell had signalized his entrance to the country: \"When he arrived\r\nhe gathered his company about him, made before it some impressive\r\nceremonies, drawn from the conjuring book of his lordship, and read\r\nto it his commission of governor or representative of Lord Selkirk;\r\nafterwards a salute was fired from the Hudson's Bay Company fort, which\r\nproclaimed his taking possession of the neighbourhood.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor, however, soon gave another example of his determination to\r\nassert his authority. It had been represented to him that the North-West\r\nCompany officers had no intention of obeying the proclamation, and\r\nindeed were engaged in buying up all the available supplies to prevent\r\nhis getting enough for his colonists. Convinced that his opponents were\r\nengaged in thwarting his designs, the Governor sent John Spencer to\r\nseize some of the stores which had been gathered in the North-West post\r\nat the mouth of the Souris River. Spencer was unwilling to go, unless\r\nvery specific instructions were given him. The Governor had, by Lord\r\nSelkirk's influence in Canada, been appointed a magistrate, and he now\r\nissued a warrant authorizing Spencer to seize the provisions in this\r\nfort.\r\n\r\nSpencer, provided with a double escort, proceeded to the fort at the\r\nSouris, and the Nor'-Westers made no other resistance than to retire\r\nwithin the stockade and shut the gate of the fort. Spencer ordered his\r\nmen to force an entrance with their hatchets. Afterwards, opening the\r\nstore-houses, they seized six hundred skins of dried meat (pemmican) and\r\nof grease, each weighing eighty-five pounds. This booty was removed into\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company fort (Brandon House) at that place.\r\n\r\nWe have now before us the first decided action that led to the serious\r\ndisturbances that followed. The question arises, Was the Governor\r\njustified in the steps taken by him? No doubt, with the legal opinion\r\nwhich Lord Selkirk had obtained, he considered himself thoroughly\r\njustified. The necessities of his starving people and the plea of\r\nhumanity were certainly strong motives urging him to action. No doubt\r\nthese considerations seemed strong, but, on the other hand, he should\r\nhave remembered that the idea of law in the fur traders' country was\r\na new thing, that the Nor'-Westers, moreover, were not prepared to\r\ncredit him with purity of motive, and that they had at their disposal a\r\nforce of wild Bois Brûlés ready to follow the unbridled customs of the\r\nplains. Further, even in civilized communities laws of non-intercourse,\r\nembargo, and the like, are looked upon as arbitrary and of doubtful\r\nvalidity. All these things should have led the Governor, ill provided\r\nas he was with the force necessary for his defence, to hesitate before\r\ntaking a course likely to be disagreeable to the Nor'-Westers, who would\r\nregard it as an assertion of the claim of superiority of the Hudson's\r\nBay Company and of the consequent degradation of their Company, of which\r\nthey were so proud.\r\n\r\nIn their writings the North-West Company take some credit for not\r\nprecipitating a conflict, but state that they endured the indignity\r\nuntil their council at Fort William should take action in the following\r\nsummer. At this council, which was interesting and full of strong\r\nfeeling against their fur-trading rivals, the Nor'-Westers, under the\r\npresidency of the Hon. William McGillivray, took decided action.\r\n\r\nIn the trials that afterwards arose out of this unfortunate quarrel,\r\nJohn Pritchard, whose forty days' wanderings we have recorded, testified\r\nthat one of the North-West agents, Mackenzie, had given him the\r\ninformation that \"the intention of the North-West Company was to seduce\r\nand inveigle away as many of the colonists and settlers at Red River\r\nas they could induce to join them; and after they should thus have\r\ndiminished their means of defence, to raise the Indians of Lac Rouge,\r\nFond du Lac, and other places, to act and destroy the settlement; and\r\nthat it was also their intention to bring the Governor, Miles Macdonell,\r\ndown to Montreal as a prisoner, by way of degrading the authority under\r\nwhich the colony was established in the eyes of the natives of that\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nSimon McGillivray, a North-West Company partner, had two years before\r\nthis written from London that \"Lord Selkirk must be driven to abandon\r\nhis project, for his success would strike at the very existence of our\r\ntrade.\"\r\n\r\nTwo of the most daring partners of the North-West Company were put in\r\ncharge of the plan of campaign agreed on at Fort William. These were\r\nDuncan Cameron and Alexander Macdonell. The latter wrote to a friend,\r\nfrom one of his resting-places on his journey, \"Much is expected of\r\nus ... so here is at them with all my heart and energy.\" The two\r\npartners arrived at Fort Gibraltar, situated at the forks of the Red\r\nand Assiniboine Rivers, toward the end of August. The senior partner,\r\nMacdonell, leaving Cameron at Fort Gibraltar, went westward to the\r\nQu'Appelle River, to return in the spring and carry out the plan agreed\r\non.\r\n\r\nCameron had been busy during the winter in dealing with the settlers,\r\nand let no opportunity slip of impressing them. Knowing the fondness\r\nof Highlanders for military display, he dressed himself in a bright\r\nred coat, wore a sword, and in writing to the settlers, which he often\r\ndid, signed himself, \"D. Cameron, Captain, Voyageur Corps, Commanding\r\nOfficer, Red River.\" He also posted an order at the gate of his fort\r\npurporting to be his captain's commission. Some dispute has arisen as to\r\nthe validity of this authority. There seems to have been some colour for\r\nthe use of this title, under authority given for enlisting an irregular\r\ncorps in the upper lakes during the American War of 1812, but the legal\r\nopinion is that this had no validity in the Red River settlement.\r\n\r\nCameron, aiming at the destruction of the colony, began by ingratiating\r\nhimself with a number of the leading settlers. Knowing the love of\r\nthe Highlanders for their own language, Cameron spoke to them Gaelic\r\nin his most pleasing manner, entertained the leading colonists at his\r\nown table, and paid many attentions to their families. Promises were\r\nthen made to a number of leaders to provide the people with homes in\r\nUpper Canada, to pay up wages due by the Hudson's Bay Company or Lord\r\nSelkirk, and to give a year's provisions free, provided the colony would\r\nleave the Red River and accept the advantages offered in Canada. This\r\nplan succeeded remarkably well, and it is in sworn evidence that on\r\nthree-quarters of the colony reaching Fort William, a settler, Campbell\r\nreceived 100_l._, several others 20_l._, and so on.\r\n\r\nSome of the best of the settlers, amounting to about one-quarter of\r\nthe whole, refused all the advances of the subtle captain. Another\r\nmethod was taken with this class. The plan of frightening them away by\r\nthe co-operation of the Cree Indians had failed, but the Bois Brûlés,\r\nor half-breeds, were a more pliant agency. These were to be employed.\r\nCameron now (April, 1815) made a demand on Archibald Macdonald, Acting\r\nGovernor, to hand over to the settlers the field pieces belonging\r\nto Lord Selkirk, on the ground that these had been used already to\r\ndisturb the peace. This startling order was presented to the Governor by\r\nsettler Campbell on the day on which the fortnightly issue of rations\r\ntook place at the colony buildings. The settlers in favour of Cameron\r\nthen broke open the store-house, and took nine pieces of ordnance and\r\nremoved them to Fort Gibraltar. The Governor having arrested one of the\r\nsettlers who had broken open the store-house, a number of the North-West\r\nCompany clerks and servants, under orders from Cameron, broke into the\r\nGovernor's house and rescued the prisoner.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Miles Macdonell, the Governor, returned to the\r\nsettlement. A warrant had been issued for his arrest by the\r\nNor'-Westers, but he refused for the time to acknowledge the\r\njurisdiction of the magistrates. Cameron now spread abroad the statement\r\nthat if the settlers did not deliver up the Governor, they in turn would\r\nbe attacked and driven from their homes. Certain colonists were now\r\nfired at by unseen assailants.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of May, the senior partner, Alexander Macdonell,\r\narrived from Qu'Appelle, accompanied by a band of Cree Indians. The\r\npartners hoped through these to frighten the settlers who remained\r\nobdurate, but the Indians were too astute to be led into the quarrel,\r\nand assured Governor Miles Macdonell that they were resolved not to\r\nmolest the newcomers.\r\n\r\nAn effort was also made to stir up the Chippewa Indians of Sand Lake,\r\nnear the west of Lake Superior. The chief of the band declared to the\r\nIndian Department of Canada that he was offered a large reward if he\r\nwould declare war against the Selkirk colonists. This the Chippewas\r\nrefused to do.\r\n\r\nEarly in June the lawless spirit followed by the Nor'-Westers again\r\nshowed itself. A party from Fort Gibraltar went down with loaded\r\nmuskets, and from a wood near the Governor's residence fired upon some\r\nof the colony employés. Mr. White, the surgeon, was nearly hit, and a\r\nball passed close by Mr. Burke, the storekeeper. General firing then\r\nbegan from the wood and was returned from the house, but four of the\r\ncolony servants were wounded. This expedition was under Cameron, who\r\ncongratulated his followers on the result.\r\n\r\nThe demand for the surrender of the Governor, in answer to the warrant\r\nissued, was then made, and at the persuasion of the other officers of\r\nthe settlement, and to avoid the loss of life and the dangers threatened\r\nagainst the colonists, Governor Miles Macdonell surrendered himself and\r\nwas taken to Montreal for trial, though no trial ever took place.\r\n\r\nThe double plan of coaxing away all the settlers who were open to such\r\ninducement, and of then forcibly driving away the residue from the\r\nsettlement, seemed likely to succeed. One hundred and thirty-four of\r\nthe colonists, induced by promises of free transport, two hundred acres\r\nof land in Upper Canada, as well as in some cases by substantial gifts,\r\ndeserted the colony in June (1815), along with Cameron, and arrived\r\nat Fort William on their way down the lakes at the end of July. These\r\nsettlers made their way in canoes along the desolate shores of Lake\r\nSuperior and Georgian Bay, and arrived at Holland Landing, in Upper\r\nCanada, on September 5th. Many of them were given land in the township\r\nof West Guillimbury, near Newmarket, and many of their descendants are\r\nthere to this day.\r\n\r\nThe Nor'-Westers now continued their persecution of the remnant of the\r\nsettlers. They burnt some of their houses and used threats of the most\r\nextreme kind. On June 25th, 1815, the following document was served upon\r\nthe disheartened colonists:--\r\n\r\n\"All settlers to retire immediately from the Red River, and no trace of\r\na settlement to remain.\r\n\r\n                                                    \"CUTHBERT GRANT.\r\n                                                    \"BOSTONNAIS PANGMAN.\r\n                                                    \"WILLIAM SHAW.\r\n                                                    \"BONHOMME MONTOUR.\"\r\n\r\nThe conflict resulting at this time may be said to be the first battle\r\nof the war. A fiery Highland trader, John McLeod, was in charge of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company house at this point, and we have his account of the\r\nattack and defence, somewhat bombastic it may be, but which, so far as\r\nknown to the author, has never been published before.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPY OF DIARY IN PROVINCIAL LIBRARY, WINNIPEG.\r\n\r\n\"In 1814-15, being in charge of the whole Red River district, I spent\r\nthe winter at the Forks, at the settlement there. On June 25th, 1815,\r\nwhile I was in charge, a sudden attack was made by an armed band of\r\nthe N.-W. party under the leadership of Alexander Macdonell (Yellow\r\nHead) and Cuthbert Grant, on the settlement and Hudson's Bay Company\r\nfort at the Forks. They numbered about seventy or eighty, well armed\r\nand on horseback. Having had some warning of it, I assumed command of\r\nboth the colony and H. B. C. parties. Mustering with inferior numbers,\r\nand with only a few guns, we took a stand against them. Taking my place\r\namongst the colonists, I fought with them. All fought bravely and kept\r\nup the fight as long as possible. Many all about me falling wounded; one\r\nmortally. Only thirteen out of our band escaped unscathed.\r\n\r\n\"The brunt of the struggle was near the H. B. C. post, close to which\r\nwas our blacksmith's smithy--a log building about ten feet by ten.\r\nBeing hard pressed, I thought of trying the little cannon (a three or\r\nfour-pounder) lying idle in the post where it could not well be used.\r\n\r\n\"One of the settlers (Hugh McLean) went with two of my men, with his\r\ncart to fetch it, with all the cart chains he could get and some powder.\r\nFinally, we got the whole to the blacksmithy, where, chopping up the\r\nchain into lengths for shot, we opened a fire of chain shot on the enemy\r\nwhich drove back the main body and scattered them, and saved the post\r\nfrom utter destruction and pillage. All the colonists' houses were,\r\nhowever, destroyed by fire. Houseless, wounded, and in extreme distress,\r\nthey took to the boats, and, saving what they could, started for Norway\r\nHouse (Jack's River), declaring they would never return.\r\n\r\n\"The enemy still prowled about, determined apparently to expel, dead or\r\nalive, all of our party. All of the H. B. Company's officers and men\r\nrefused to remain, except the two brave fellows in the service, viz.\r\nArchibald Currie and James McIntosh, who, with noble Hugh McLean, joined\r\nin holding the fort in the smithy. Governor Macdonell was a prisoner.\r\n\r\n\"In their first approach the enemy appeared determined more to\r\nfrighten than to kill. Their demonstration in line of battle, mounted,\r\nand in full 'war paint' and equipment was formidable, but their fire,\r\nespecially at first, was desultory. Our party, numbering only about half\r\ntheirs, while preserving a general line of defence, exposed itself as\r\nlittle as possible, but returned the enemy's fire, sharply checking the\r\nattack, and our line was never broken by them. On the contrary, when the\r\nchain-firing began, the enemy retired out of range of our artillery, but\r\nat a flank movement reached the colony houses, where they quickly and\r\nresistlessly plied the work of destruction. To their credit be it said,\r\nthey took no life or property.\r\n\r\n\"Of killed, on our side, there was only poor John Warren of H. B. C.\r\nservice, a worthy brave gentleman, who, taking a leading part in the\r\nbattle, too fearlessly exposed himself. Of the enemy, probably, the\r\ncasualties were greater, for they presented a better target, and we\r\ncertainly fired to kill. From the smithy we could and did protect the\r\ntrade post, but could not the buildings of the colonists, which were\r\nalong the bank of the Red River, while the post faced the Assiniboine\r\nmore than the Red River. Fortunately for us in the 'fort' (the smithy)\r\nthe short nights were never too dark for our watch and ward.\r\n\r\n\"The colonists were allowed to take what they could of what belonged\r\nto them, and that was but little, for as yet they had neither cow nor\r\nplough, only a horse or two. There were boats and other craft enough\r\nto take them all--colonists and H. B. C. people--away, and all, save\r\nmy three companions already named and myself, took ship and fled. For\r\nmany days after we were under siege, living under constant peril; but\r\nunconquerable in our bullet-proof log walls, and with our terrible\r\ncannon and chain shot.\r\n\r\n\"At length the enemy retired. The post was safe, with from 800_l._ to\r\n1000_l._ sterling worth of attractive trade goods belonging to the\r\nHudson's Bay Company untouched. I was glad of this, for it enabled me to\r\nsecure the services of free men about the place--French Canadians and\r\nhalf-breeds not in the service of the N.-W. Company--to restore matters\r\nand prepare for the future.\r\n\r\n\"I felt that we had too much at stake in the country to give it up, and\r\nhad every confidence in the resources of the H. B. Company and the Earl\r\nof Selkirk to hold their own and effectually repel any future attack\r\nfrom our opponents.\r\n\r\n\"I found the free men about the place willing to work for me; and at\r\nonce hired a force of them for building and other works in reparation\r\nof damages and in new works. So soon as I got my post in good order,\r\nI turned to save the little but precious and promising crops of the\r\ncolonists, whose return I anticipated, made fences where required, and\r\nin due time cut and stacked their hay, &c.\r\n\r\n\"That done I took upon me, without order or suggestion from any quarter,\r\nto build a house for the Governor and his staff of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany at Red River. There was no such officer at that time, nor\r\nhad there ever been, but I was aware that such an appointment was\r\ncontemplated.\r\n\r\n\"I selected for this purpose what I considered a suitable site at\r\na point or sharp bend in the Red River about two miles below the\r\nAssiniboine, on a slight rise on the south side of the point--since\r\nknown as Point Douglas, the family name of the Earl of Selkirk. Possibly\r\nI so christened it--I forget.\r\n\r\n\"It was of two stories; with main timbers of oak; a good substantial\r\nhouse; with windows of parchment in default of glass.\" Here ends\r\nMcLeod's diary.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of the vicinity showed the colonists much sympathy, but\r\non June 27th, after the hostile encounter, some thirteen families,\r\ncomprising from forty to sixty persons, pursued their sad journey,\r\npiloted by friendly Indians, to the north end of Lake Winnipeg, where\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company post of Jack River afforded some shelter.\r\nMcLeod and, as he tells us, three men only were left. These endeavoured\r\nto protect the settlers' growing crops, which this year showed great\r\npromise.\r\n\r\nThe expulsion may now be said to have been complete. The day after\r\nthe departure of the expelled settlers, the colony dwellings, with\r\nthe possible exception of the Governor's house, were all burnt to the\r\nground. In July the desolate band reached Jack River House, their future\r\nbeing dark indeed. Deliverance was, however, coming from two directions.\r\nColin Robertson, a Hudson's Bay Company officer, arrived from the East\r\nwith twenty Canadians. On reaching the Red River settlement, he found\r\nthe settlers all gone, but he followed them speedily to their rendezvous\r\non Lake Winnipeg and returned with the refugees to their deserted homes\r\non Red River. They were joined also by about ninety settlers from the\r\nHighlands of Scotland, who had come through to Red River in one season.\r\nThe colony was now rising into promise again. A number of the demolished\r\nbuildings were soon erected; the colony took heart, and under the new\r\nGovernor, Robert Semple, a British officer who had come with the last\r\nparty of settlers, the prospects seemed to have improved. The Governor's\r\ndwelling was strengthened, other dwellings were erected beside it, and\r\nmore necessity being now seen for defence, the whole assumed a more\r\nmilitary aspect, and took the name, after Lord Selkirk's family name,\r\nFort Douglas.\r\n\r\nThough a fair crop had been reaped by the returned settlers from their\r\nfields, yet the large addition to their numbers made it necessary to\r\nremove to Fort Daer, where the buffalo were plentiful. This party was\r\nunder the leadership of Sheriff Alexander Macdonell, though Governor\r\nSemple was also there. The autumn saw trouble at the Forks. The report\r\nof disturbances having taken place between the Nor'-Westers and Hudson's\r\nBay Company employés at Qu'Appelle was heard, as well as renewed threats\r\nof disturbance in the colony. Colin Robertson in October, 1815, captured\r\nFort Gibraltar, seized Duncan Cameron, and recovered the field-pieces\r\nand other property taken by the Nor'-Westers in the preceding months.\r\nThough the capture of Cameron and his fort thus took place, and the\r\nevent was speedily followed by the reinstatement of the trader on his\r\npromise to keep the peace, yet the report of the seizure led to the\r\ngreatest irritation in all parts of the country where the two Companies\r\nhad posts. All through the winter, threatenings of violence filled the\r\nair. The Bois Brûlés were arrogant, and, led by their faithful leader,\r\nCuthbert Grant, looked upon themselves as the \"New Nation.\"\r\n\r\nReturning, after the New Year of 1816, from Fort Daer, Governor Semple\r\nsaw the necessity for aggressive action. Fort Gibraltar was to become\r\nthe rendezvous for a Bois Brûlés force of extermination from\r\nQu'Appelle, Fort des Prairies (Portage la Prairie), and even from the\r\nSaskatchewan. To prevent this, Colin Robertson, under the Governor's\r\ndirection, recaptured Fort Gibraltar and held Cameron as a prisoner.\r\nThis event took place in March or April of 1816. The legality of this\r\nseizure was of course much discussed between the hostile parties.\r\n\r\nIt was deemed wise, however, to make a safe disposal of the prisoner\r\nCameron. He was accordingly dispatched under the care of Colin\r\nRobertson, by way of Jack River, to York Factory, to stand his trial\r\nin England. Thus were reprisals made for the capture and removal of\r\nMiles Macdonell in the preceding year, both actions being of doubtful\r\nlegality. On account of the failure of the Hudson's Bay Company ship\r\nto leave York Factory in that year, Cameron did not reach England for\r\nseventeen months, where he was immediately released.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Fort Gibraltar was soon to follow the deportation of its\r\ncommandant. The matter of the dismantling of Fort Gibraltar was much\r\ndiscussed between Governor Semple and his lieutenant, Colin Robertson.\r\nThe latter was opposed to the proposed destruction of the Nor'-Wester\r\nfort, knowing the excitement such a course would cause. However, after\r\nthe departure of Robertson to Hudson Bay in charge of Cameron, the\r\nGovernor carried out his purpose, and in the end of May, 1816, the\r\nbuildings were pulled down. A force of some thirty men were employed,\r\nand, expecting as they did, a possible interruption from the West, the\r\nwork was done in a week or a little more.\r\n\r\nThe materials were taken apart; the stockade was made into a raft, the\r\nremainder was piled upon it, and all was floated down Red River to the\r\nsite of Fort Douglas. The material was then used for strengthening\r\nthe fort and building new houses in it. Thus ended Fort Gibraltar. A\r\nconsiderable establishment it was in its time; its name was undoubtedly\r\na misnomer so far as strength was concerned; yet it points to its\r\norigination in troublous times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORT DOUGLAS.]\r\n\r\nThe vigorous policy carried out in regard to Fort Gibraltar was likewise\r\nshown in the district south of the Forks. As we have seen, to the\r\nsouth, Fort Daer had been erected, and thither, winter by winter, the\r\nsettlers had gone for subsistence. Here, too, was the Nor'-Wester\r\nfort of Pembina House. During the time when Governor Semple and Colin\r\nRobertson were maturing their plans, it was determined to seize Pembina.\r\nNo sooner had the news of Cameron's seizure reached Fort Daer, than\r\nSheriff Macdonell, who was in charge, organized an expedition, took\r\nPembina House, and its officers and inhabitants. The prisoners were sent\r\nto Fort Douglas, and were liberated on pledges of good behaviour, and\r\nthe military stores were also taken to Fort Douglas. The reasons given\r\nby the colony people for this course are \"self-defence and the security\r\nof the lives of the settlers.\" About the end of April, the settlers\r\nreturned from Fort Daer, and were placed on their respective lots along\r\nthe Red River.\r\n\r\nAll events now plainly pointed to armed disturbances and bloodshed. The\r\npolicy of Governor Semple was too vigorous when the inflammable elements\r\nin the country were borne in mind. There was in the country a class\r\ncalled \"Free Canadians,\" i.e. those French Canadian trappers and traders\r\nnot connected with either Company, who obtained a precarious living for\r\nthemselves, their Indian wives, and half-breed children. These, fearing\r\ntrouble, betook themselves to the plains. The Indians of the vicinity\r\nseemed to have gained a liking for the colonists and their leaders.\r\nWhen they heard the threatenings from the West, two of the chiefs came\r\nto Governor Semple and offered the assistance of their bands. This\r\nthe Governor could not accept, whereat the chiefs gave voice to their\r\nsorrow and disappointment. Governor Semple seems to have disregarded all\r\nthese omens of coming trouble, and to have acted almost without common\r\nprudence. No doubt, having but lately come to the country, he failed to\r\nunderstand the daring character of his opponents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE SKIRMISH OF SEVEN OAKS.\r\n\r\n     Leader of the Bois Brûlés--A candid letter--Account of a\r\n     prisoner--\"Yellow Head\"--Speech to the Indians--The chief knows\r\n     nothing--On fleet Indian ponies--An eye-witness in Fort Douglas--A\r\n     rash Governor--The massacre--\"For God's sake save my life\"--The\r\n     Governor and twenty others slain--Colonists driven out--Eastern\r\n     levy meets the settlers--Effects seized--Wild revelry--Chanson of\r\n     Pierre Falcon.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe troubles between the Hudson's Bay and North-West Companies were\r\nevidently coming to a crisis. The Nor'-Westers laid their plans with\r\nskill, and determined to send one expedition from Fort William westward\r\nand another from Qu'Appelle eastward, and so crush out the opposition at\r\nRed River.\r\n\r\nFrom the west the expedition was under Cuthbert Grant, and he, appealing\r\nto his fellow Metis, raised the standard of the Bois Brûlés and called\r\nhis followers the \"New Nation.\" Early in March the Bois Brûlés' leader\r\nwrote to Trader J. D. Cameron, detailing his plans and expectations.\r\nWe quote from his letter: \"I am now safe and sound, thank God, for I\r\nbelieve that it is more than Colin Robertson, or any of his suite, dare\r\noffer the least insult to any of the Bois Brûlés, although Robertson\r\nmade use of some expressions which I hope he will swallow in the spring.\r\nHe shall see that it is neither fifteen, thirty, nor fifty of his best\r\nhorsemen that can make the Bois Brûlés bow to him. Our people at Fort\r\nDes Prairies and English River are all to be here in the spring. It is\r\nhoped that we shall come off with flying colours, and _never to see any\r\nof them again in the colonizing way in Red River_.... We are to remain\r\nat the Forks to pass the summer, for fear they should play us the same\r\ntrick as last summer of coming back; but they shall receive a warm\r\nreception.\"\r\n\r\nThe details of this western expedition are well given by Lieutenant\r\nPierre Chrysologue Pambrun, an officer of the Canadian Voltigeurs, a\r\nregiment which had distinguished itself in the late war against the\r\nUnited States. Pambrun had entered the service of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany as a trader, and been sent to the Qu'Appelle district. Having\r\ngone west to Qu'Appelle, he left that western post with five boat loads\r\nof pemmican and furs to descend the Assiniboine River to the Forks.\r\nEarly in May, near the Grand Rapids, Pambrun and his party touched the\r\nshore of the river, when they were immediately surrounded by a party\r\nof Bois Brûlés and their boats and cargoes were all seized by their\r\nassailants. The pemmican was landed and the boats taken across the\r\nriver. The unfortunate Pambrun was for five days kept in durance vile by\r\nCuthbert Grant and Peter Pangman, who headed the attacking party, and\r\nthe prisoner was carried back to Qu'Appelle.\r\n\r\nWhile Pambrun was here as prisoner, he was frequently told by Cuthbert\r\nGrant that the half-breeds were intending in the summer to destroy the\r\nRed River settlements; their leader often reminded the Bois Brûlés\r\nof this, and they frequently sang their war songs to waken ardour\r\nfor the expeditions. Captors and prisoner shortly afterward left the\r\nwestern fort and went down the river to Grand Rapids. Here the captured\r\npemmican was re-embarked and the journey was resumed. Near the forks\r\nof the Qu'Appelle River a band of Indians was encamped. The Indians\r\nwere summoned to meet Commander Macdonell, who spoke to them in French,\r\nthough Pangman interpreted.\r\n\r\n\"MY FRIENDS AND RELATIONS,--I address you bashfully, for I have not\r\na pipe of tobacco to give you. All our goods have been taken by the\r\nEnglish, but we are now upon a party to drive them away. Those people\r\nhave been spoiling the fair lands which belonged to you and the Bois\r\nBrûlés, and to which they have no right. They have been driving away the\r\nbuffalo. You will soon be poor and miserable if the English stay. But we\r\nwill drive them away if the Indians do not, for the North-West Company\r\nand the Bois Brûlés are one. If you (speaking to the chief) and some of\r\nyour young men will join I shall be glad.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief responded coldly and gave no assistance.\r\n\r\nNext morning the Indians departed, and the party proceeded on their\r\njourney. Pambrun was at first left behind, but in the evening was given\r\na spare horse and overtook Grant's cavalcade at the North-West Fort near\r\nBrandon House. At the North-West Fort Pambrun saw tobacco, carpenters'\r\ntools, a quantity of furs, and other things which had been seized in the\r\nHudson's Bay Fort, Brandon House, and been brought over as booty to the\r\nNor'-Westers.\r\n\r\nResuming their journey the traders kept to their boats down the\r\nAssiniboine, while the Bois Brûlés went chiefly on horseback until they\r\nreached Portage La Prairie. Sixty miles had yet to be traversed before\r\nthe Forks were reached. The Bois Brûlés now prepared their mounted\r\nforce. Cuthbert Grant was Commander. Dressed in the picturesque garb of\r\nthe country, the Metis now arrived with guns, pistols, lances, bows,\r\nand arrows. Pambrun remained behind with Alexander Macdonell, but was\r\nclearly led to believe that the mounted force would enter Fort Douglas\r\nand destroy the settlement. On their fleet Indian ponies these children\r\nof the prairie soon made their journey from Portage La Prairie to the\r\nSelkirk settlement.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to the facile narrator, John Pritchard, for an account\r\nof their arrival and their attack. He states that in June, 1816, he was\r\nliving at Red River, and quite looked for an attack from the western\r\nlevy just described. Watch was constantly kept from the guérite of Fort\r\nDouglas for the approaching foe. The half-breeds turned aside from the\r\nAssiniboine some four miles up the River to a point a couple of miles\r\nbelow Fort Douglas. Governor Semple and his attendants followed them\r\nwith the glass in their route across the plain. The Governor and about\r\ntwenty others sallied out to meet the western party. On his way out he\r\nsent back for a piece of cannon, which was in the fort, to be brought.\r\nSoon after this the half-breeds approached Governor Semple's party in\r\nthe form of a half moon. The Highland settlers had betaken themselves\r\nfor protection to Fort Douglas, and in their Gaelic tongue made sad\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\nA daring fellow named Boucher then came out of the ranks of his party,\r\nand, on horseback, approached Semple and his body-guard. He gesticulated\r\nwildly, and called out in broken English, \"What do you want? What do you\r\nwant?\" Governor Semple answered, \"What do _you_ want?\" To this Boucher\r\nreplied, \"We want our fort.\" The Governor said, \"Well, go to your fort.\"\r\nNothing more was said, but Governor Semple was seen to put his hand on\r\nBoucher's gun. At this juncture a shot was fired from some part of the\r\nline, and the firing became general. Many of the witnesses who saw the\r\naffair affirmed that the shot first fired was from the Bois Brûlés' line.\r\n\r\nThe attacking party were most deadly in their fire. Semple and his\r\nstaff, as well as others of his party, fell to the number of twenty-two.\r\nThe affair was most disastrous.\r\n\r\nPritchard says:--\r\n\r\n\"I did not see the Governor fall, though I saw his corpse the next day\r\nat the fort. When I saw Captain Rogers fall I expected to share his\r\nfate. As there was a French Canadian among those who surrounded me,\r\nand who had just made an end of my friend, I said, 'Lavigne, you are\r\na Frenchman, you are a man, you are a Christian. For God's sake save\r\nmy life; for God's sake try and save it. I give myself up; I am your\r\nprisoner.'\"\r\n\r\nTo the appeals of Pritchard Lavigne responded, and, placing himself\r\nbefore his friend, defended him from the infuriated half-breeds, who\r\nwould have taken his life. One Primeau wished to shoot Pritchard,\r\nsaying that the Englishman had formerly killed his brother. At length\r\nthey decided to spare Pritchard's life, though they called him a _petit\r\nchien_, told him he had not long to live, and would be overtaken on\r\ntheir return. It transpired that Governor Semple was not killed by the\r\nfirst shot that disabled him, but had his thigh-bone broken. A kind\r\nFrench Canadian undertook to care for the Governor, but in the fury of\r\nthe fight an Indian, who was the greatest rascal in the company, shot\r\nthe wounded man in the breast, and thus killed him instantly.\r\n\r\nThe Bois Brûlés, indeed, many of them, were disguised as Indians, and,\r\npainted as for the war dance, gave the war whoop, and made a hideous\r\nnoise and shouting. When their victory was won they declared that their\r\npurpose was to weaken the colony and put an end to the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany opposition. Cuthbert Grant then proceeded to complete his work.\r\nHe declared to Pritchard that \"if Fort Douglas were not immediately\r\ngiven up with all the public property, instantly and without resistance,\r\nman, woman, and child would be put to death. He stated that the attack\r\nwould be made upon it the same night, and if a single shot were fired,\r\nthat would be the signal for the indiscriminate destruction of every\r\nsoul.\"\r\n\r\nThis declaration of Cromwellian policy was very alarming. Pritchard\r\nbelieved it meant the killing of all the women and children. He\r\nremonstrated with the prairie leader, reminding him that the colonists\r\nwere his father's relatives. Somewhat softened by this appeal, Grant\r\nconsented to spare the lives of the settlers if all the arms and public\r\nproperty were given up and the colony deserted. An inventory of property\r\nwas accordingly taken, and in the evening of the third day after the\r\nbattle, the mournful company, for a second time, like Acadian refugees,\r\nleft behind them homes and firesides and went into exile.\r\n\r\nThe joyful news was sent west by the victorious Metis. Pambrun at\r\nPortage La Prairie received news from a messenger who had hastened away\r\nto report to Macdonell the result of the attack. Hearing the account\r\ngiven by the courier, the trader was full of glee. He announced in\r\nFrench to the people who were anxiously awaiting the news, \"Sacré nom\r\nde Dieu, bonnes nouvelles, vingt-deux Anglais de tués.\" Those present,\r\nespecially Lamarre, Macdonell, and Sieveright, gave vent to their\r\nfeelings boisterously.\r\n\r\nMany of the party mounted their Indian ponies and hastened to the place\r\nof conflict; others went by water down the Assiniboine. The commander\r\nsent word ahead that the colonists were to be detained till his arrival.\r\nPambrun, being taken part of the way by water, was delayed, and so was\r\ntoo late in arriving to see the colonists. Cuthbert Grant and nearly\r\nfifty of the assailing party were in the fort.\r\n\r\nPambrun, having obtained permission to visit Seven Oaks, the scene of\r\nthe conflict, was greatly distressed by the sight. The uncovered limbs\r\nof many of the dead were above ground, and the bodies were in a mangled\r\ncondition. This unfortunate affair for many a day cast a reproach upon\r\nthe Nor'-Westers, although the prevailing opinion was that Grant was a\r\nbrave man and conducted himself well in the engagement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEVEN OAKS MONUMENT.]\r\n\r\nWe have now to enquire as to the movements of the expedition coming\r\nwestward from Fort William. The route of upwards of four hundred miles\r\nwas a difficult one. Accordingly, before they reached Red River,\r\nFort Douglas was already in the hands of the Nor'-Westers. With the\r\nexpedition from Fort William came a non-commissioned officer of the De\r\nMeuron regiment, one of the Swiss bodies of mercenaries disbanded after\r\nthe war of 1812-15. This was Frederick Damien Huerter. His account is\r\ncircumstantial and clear. He had, as leading a military life, entered\r\nthe service of the Nor'-Westers, and coming west to Lake Superior,\r\nfollowed the leadership of the fur trader Alexander Norman McLeod and\r\ntwo of the officers of his old regiment, Lieutenants Missani and Brumby.\r\n\r\nArriving at Fort William, a short time was given for providing the party\r\nwith arms and equipment, and soon the lonely voyageurs, on this occasion\r\nin a warlike spirit, were paddling themselves over the fur traders'\r\nroute in five large north canoes.\r\n\r\nOn the approach to Rainy Lake Fort, as many of the party as were\r\nsoldiers dressed in full regimentals, in order to impress upon the\r\nIndians that they had the King's authority. Strong drink and tobacco\r\nwere a sufficient inducement to about twenty of the Indians to join the\r\nexpedition. On the day before the fight at Seven Oaks, the party had\r\narrived at the fort known as Bas de la Rivière, near Lake Winnipeg.\r\nGuns and two small brass field-pieces, three pounders, were put in\r\norder, and the company crossed to the mouth of the Red River, ascended\r\nto Nettley Creek, and there bivouacked, forty miles from the scene of\r\naction and two days after the skirmish. They had expected here to meet\r\nthe Qu'Appelle brigade of Cuthbert Grant. No doubt this was the original\r\nplan, but the rashness of the Governor and the hot blood of the Metis\r\nhad brought on the engagement, with the result we have seen.\r\n\r\nKnowing nothing of the fight, the party started to ascend the river,\r\nand soon met seven or eight boats, laden with colonists, under the\r\ncommand of the sheriff of the Red River settlement. McLeod then heard of\r\nthe fight, ordered the settlers ashore, examined all the papers among\r\ntheir baggage, and took possession of all letters, account books, and\r\ndocuments whatsoever. Even Governor Semple's trunks, for which there\r\nwere no keys, were broken open and examined. The colonists were then set\r\nfree and proceeded on their sad journey, Charles Grant being detailed to\r\nseeing them safely away.\r\n\r\nHuerter says:--\r\n\r\n\"On the 26th I went up the river to Fort Douglas. There were many of the\r\npartners of the North-West Company with us. At Fort Douglas the brigade\r\nwas received with discharges of artillery and fire-arms. The fort was\r\nunder Mr. Alexander Macdonell, and there was present a great gathering\r\nof Bois Brûlés, clerks, and interpreters, as well as partners of the\r\nCompany. On our arrival Archibald Norman McLeod, our leader, took the\r\nmanagement and direction of the fort, and all made whatever they chose\r\nof the property it contained. The Bois Brûlés were entirely under the\r\norders and control of McLeod and the partners. McLeod occupied the\r\napartments lately belonging to Governor Semple. After my arrival I saw\r\nall the Bois Brûlés assembled in a large outer room, which had served as\r\na mess-room for the officers of the colony.\r\n\r\n\"I rode the same day to the field of 'Seven Oaks,' where Governor Semple\r\nand so many of his people had lost their lives, in company with a number\r\nof those who had been employed on that occasion--all on horseback. At\r\nthis period, scarcely a week after June 19th, I saw a number of human\r\nbodies scattered about the plain, and nearly reduced to skeletons, there\r\nbeing then very little flesh adhering to the bones; and I was informed\r\non the spot that many of the bodies had been partly devoured by dogs and\r\nwolves.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a scene of great rejoicing the same evening at the fort,\r\nthe Bois Brûlés being painted and dancing naked, after the manner of\r\nsavages, to the great amusement of their masters.\r\n\r\nOn June 29th most of the partners and the northern brigade set off for\r\nthe rapids at the mouth of the Saskatchewan. The departure of the grand\r\nbrigade was signalized by the discharge of artillery from Fort Douglas.\r\n\r\nThe Nor'-Westers were now in the ascendant. The Bois Brûlés were\r\nnaturally in a state of exultation. Their wild Indian blood was at the\r\nboiling point. Fort Douglas had been seized without opposition, and for\r\nseveral days the most riotous scenes took place. Threats of violence\r\nwere freely indulged in against the Hudson's Bay Company, Lord Selkirk,\r\nand the colonists. As Pritchard remarks, there was nothing now for the\r\ndiscouraged settlers but to betake themselves for the second time to the\r\nrendezvous at the north of Lake Winnipeg, and there await deliverance\r\nat the hands of their noble patron, Lord Selkirk. The exuberance of the\r\nFrench half-breeds found its way into verse. We give the chanson of\r\nPierre Falcon and the translation of it:--\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANSON ÉCRITE PAR PIERRE FALCON.\r\n\r\n    Voulez-vous écouter chanter une chanson de vérité?\r\n    Le dix-neuf de Juin les Bois Brûlés sont arrivés\r\n    Comme des braves guerriers,\r\n    Sont arrivés à la grenouillère.\r\n\r\n    Nous avons fait trois prisonniers\r\n    Des Orcanais? Ils sont ici pour piller notre pays,\r\n    Etant sur le point de débarquer,\r\n    Deux de nos gens se sont écriés,\r\n    \"Voilà l'Anglais qui vient nous attaquer.\"\r\n    Tous aussitôt nous sommes dévirés\r\n    Pour aller les rencontrer.\r\n\r\n    J'avons cerné la bande de grenadiers;\r\n    Ils sont immobiles?--Ils sont démentés?\r\n    J'avons agi comme des gens d'honneur,\r\n    Nous envoyâmes un ambassadeur.\r\n    \"Gouverneur, voulez-vous arrêter un petit moment,\r\n    Nous voulons vous parler.\"\r\n\r\n    Le gouverneur, qui est enragé,\r\n    Il dit à ses soldats, \"Tirez.\"\r\n    Le premier coup l'Anglais le tire,\r\n    L'ambassadeur a presque manqué d'être tué,\r\n    Le gouverneur se croyant l'empereur,\r\n    Il agit avec rigueur,\r\n    Le gouverneur, se croyant l'empereur,\r\n    A son malheur agit avec trop de rigueur.\r\n\r\n    Ayant vu passé les Bois Brûlés,\r\n    Il a parti pour nous épouvanter.\r\n    Il s'est trompé; il s'est bien fait tuer\r\n    Quantité de ses grenadiers.\r\n\r\n    J'avons tué presque toute son armée;\r\n    De la bande quatre de cinq se sont sauvés\r\n    Si vous aviez vu les Anglais\r\n    Et tous les Bois Brûlés après--\r\n    De butte en butte les Anglais culbutaient;\r\n    Les Bois Brûlés jetaient des cris de joie.\r\n\r\n    Qui en a composé la chanson?\r\n    C'est Pierre Falcon, le bon garçon.\r\n    Elle a été faite et composée\r\n    Sur la victoire qui nous avons gagnée.\r\n    Elle a été faite et composée.\r\n    Chantons la gloire de tous ces Bois Brûlés.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG WRITTEN BY PIERRE FALCON.\r\n\r\n    Come, listen to this song of truth,\r\n    A song of brave Bois Brûlés,\r\n    Who at Frog Plain took three captives,\r\n    Strangers come to rob our country.\r\n\r\n    Where dismounting there to rest us,\r\n    A cry is raised, \"The English!\r\n    They are coming to attack us.\"\r\n    So we hasten forth to meet them.\r\n\r\n    I looked upon their army,\r\n    They are motionless and downcast;\r\n    So, as honour would incline us,\r\n    We desire with them to parley.\r\n\r\n    But their leader, moved with anger,\r\n    Gives the word to fire upon us;\r\n    And imperiously repeats it,\r\n    Rushing on to his destruction.\r\n\r\n    Having seen us pass his stronghold,\r\n    He has thought to strike with terror\r\n    The Bois Brûlés.--Ah! mistaken,\r\n    Many of his soldiers perish.\r\n\r\n    But a few escaped the slaughter,\r\n    Rushing from the field of battle;\r\n    Oh, to see the English fleeing!\r\n    Oh, the shouts of their pursuers!\r\n\r\n    Who has sung this song of triumph?\r\n    The good Pierre Falcon has composed it,\r\n    That his praise of these Bois Brûlés\r\n    Might be evermore recorded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nLORD SELKIRK TO THE RESCUE.\r\n\r\n     The Earl in Montreal--Alarming news--Engages a body of\r\n     Swiss--The De Meurons--Embark for the North-West--Kawtawabetay's\r\n     story--Hears of Seven Oaks--Lake Superior--Lord Selkirk--A doughty\r\n     Douglas--Seizes Fort William--Canoes upset and Nor'-Westers\r\n     drowned--\"A Banditti\"--The Earl's blunder--A winter march--Fort\r\n     Douglas recaptured--His Lordship soothes the settlers--An Indian\r\n     Treaty--\"The Silver Chief\"--The Earl's note-book.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sad story of the beleaguered and excited colonists reached the ears\r\nof Lord Selkirk through his agents. The trouble threatening his settlers\r\ndetermined the energetic founder to visit Canada for himself, and, if\r\npossible, the infant colony. Accordingly, late in the year 1815, in\r\ncompany with his family--consisting of the Countess, his son, and two\r\ndaughters--he reached Montreal. The news of the first dispersion of the\r\ncolonists, their flight to Norway House, and the further threatenings\r\nof the Bois Brûlés, arrived about the time of their coming to New York.\r\nLord Selkirk hastened on to Montreal, but it was too late in the season,\r\nbeing about the end of October, to penetrate to the interior.\r\n\r\nHe must winter in Montreal. He was here in the very midst of the enemy.\r\nWith energy, characteristic of the man, he brought the matter of\r\nprotection of his colony urgently before the Government of Lower Canada.\r\nIn a British colony surely the rights of property of a British subject\r\nwould be protected, and surely the safety of hundreds of loyal people\r\ncould not be trifled with. As we shall see in a later chapter, the\r\nhigh-minded nobleman counted without his host; he had but to live a few\r\nyears in the New World of that day to find how skilfully the forms of\r\nlaw can be adapted to carry out illegal objects and shield law-breakers.\r\n\r\nAs early as February of that year (1815), dreading the threatenings\r\neven then made by the North-West Company, he had represented to Lord\r\nBathurst, the British Secretary of State, the urgent necessity of an\r\narmed force, not necessarily very numerous, being sent to the Red River\r\nsettlement to maintain order in the colony. Now, after the outrageous\r\nproceedings of the summer of 1815 and the arrival of the dreary\r\nintelligence from Red River, Lord Selkirk again brings the matter before\r\nthe authorities, this time before Sir Gordon Drummond, Governor of Lower\r\nCanada, and encloses a full account of the facts as to the expulsion\r\nof the settlers from their homes, and of the many acts of violence\r\nperpetrated at Red River.\r\n\r\nNothing being gained in this way, his Lordship determined to undertake\r\nan expedition himself, as soon as it could be organized, and carry\r\nassistance to his persecuted people, who, he knew, had been gathered\r\ntogether by Colin Robertson, and to whom he had sent as Governor,\r\nMr. Semple, in whom he reposed great confidence. We have seen that\r\nduring the winter of 1815-16, peace and a certain degree of confidence\r\nprevailed among the settlers, more than half of whom were spending their\r\nfirst winter in the country. Fort Douglas was regarded as strong enough\r\nto resist a considerable attack, and the presence of Governor Semple,\r\na military officer, was thought a guarantee for the protection of the\r\npeople. During the winter, however, Lord Selkirk learned enough to\r\nassure him that the danger was not over--that, indeed, a more determined\r\nattack than ever would be made as soon as the next season should open.\r\nHe had been sworn in as a Justice of the Peace in Upper Canada and for\r\nthe Indian territories; he had obtained for his personal protection from\r\nthe Governor the promise of a sergeant and six men of the British army\r\nstationed in Canada, but this was not sufficient.\r\n\r\nHe undertook a plan of placing upon his own land in the colony a number\r\nof persons as settlers who could be called upon in case of emergency, as\r\nhad been the intention in the case of the Highland colonists, to whom\r\nmuskets had been furnished. The close of the Napoleonic wars had left a\r\nlarge number of the soldiers engaged in these wars out of employment,\r\nthe British Government having been compelled to reduce the size of the\r\narmy. During the Napoleonic wars a number of soldiers of adventure from\r\nSwitzerland and Italy, captured by Britain in Spain, entered her service\r\nand were useful troops. Two of these regiments, one named \"De Meuron,\"\r\nand the other \"Watteville,\" had been sent to Canada to assist in the\r\nwar against the United States. This war being now over also, orders\r\ncame to Sir Gordon Drummond to disband the two regiments in May, 1815.\r\nThe former of the regiments was at the time stationed at Montreal, the\r\nlatter at Kingston.\r\n\r\nFrom these bodies of men Lord Selkirk undertook to provide his colony\r\nwith settlers willing to defend it. The enemies of Lord Selkirk have\r\nbeen very free in their expression of opinion as to the worthlessness of\r\nthese soldiers and their unfitness as settlers. It is worthy of notice,\r\nhowever, that the Nor'-Westers did not scruple to use Messrs. Missani\r\nand Brumby, as well as Reinhard and Huerter of the same corps, to carry\r\nout their own purposes. The following order, given by Sir John Coape\r\nSherbrooke, effectually disposes of such a calumny:--\r\n\r\n                                              \"Quebec, July 26th, 1816.\r\n\r\n   \"In parting with the regiments 'De Meuron' and 'Watteville,'\r\n   both of which corps his Excellency has had the good fortune\r\n   of having under his command in other parts of the world, Sir\r\n   John Sherbrooke desires Lieutenant-Colonel De Meuron and\r\n   Lieutenant-Colonel May, and the officers and men of these corps\r\n   will accept his congratulations on having, by their conduct in\r\n   the Canadas, maintained the reputation which they have deservedly\r\n   acquired by their former services. His Excellency can have no\r\n   hesitation in saying that his Majesty's service in these provinces\r\n   has derived important advantages during the late war from the\r\n   steadiness, discipline, and efficiency of these corps.\r\n\r\n                                 \"J. HARVEY, Lieutenant-Colonel, D.A.G.\"\r\n\r\nTestimony to the same effect is given by the officer in command of the\r\ngarrison of Malta, on their leaving that island to come to Canada.\r\n\r\nThese men afforded the material for Lord Selkirk's purpose, viz. to\r\ntill the soil and protect the colony. Like a wise man, however, he made\r\ncharacter the ground of engagement in the case of all whom he took. To\r\nthose who came to terms with him he agreed to give a sufficient portion\r\nof land, agricultural implements, and as wages for working the boats on\r\nthe voyage eight dollars a month. It was further agreed that should any\r\nchoose to leave Red River on reaching it, they should be taken back by\r\nhis Lordship free of expense.\r\n\r\nEarly in June, 1816, four officers and about eighty men of the \"De\r\nMeurons\" left Montreal in Lord Selkirk's employ and proceeded westward\r\nto Kingston. Here twenty more of the \"Watteville\" regiment joined\r\ntheir company. Thence the expedition, made up by the addition of one\r\nhundred and thirty canoe-men, pushed on to York (Toronto), and from York\r\nnorthward to Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay.\r\n\r\nAcross this Bay and Lake Huron they passed rapidly on to Sault Ste.\r\nMarie, Lord Selkirk leaving the expedition before reaching that place\r\nto go to Drummond's Isle, which was the last British garrison in Upper\r\nCanada, and at which point he was to receive the sergeant and six men\r\ngranted for his personal protection by the Governor of Canada. At\r\nDrummond's Island a council was held with Kawtawabetay, an Ojibway\r\nchief, by the Indian Department, Lieut.-Colonel Maule, of the 104th\r\nRegiment, presiding. Kawtawabetay there informed the council that in the\r\nspring of 1815 two North-West traders, McKenzie and Morrison, told him\r\nthat they would give him and his people all the goods or merchandise and\r\nrum that they had at Fort William, Leach Lake, and Sand Lake, if he, the\r\nsaid Kawtawabetay, and his people would make and declare war against the\r\nsettlers in Red River. On being asked by the chief whether this was at\r\nthe request of the \"great chiefs\" at Montreal or Quebec, McKenzie and\r\nMorrison said it was solely from the North-West Company's agents, who\r\nwished the settlement destroyed, as it was an annoyance to them. The\r\nchief further stated that the last spring (1816), whilst at Fond Du Lac\r\nSuperior, a Nor'-Wester agent (Grant) offered him two kegs of rum and\r\ntwo carrots of tobacco if he would send some of his young men in search\r\nof certain persons employed in taking despatches to the Red River,\r\npillage these bearers of despatches of the letters and papers, and kill\r\nthem should they make any resistance. The chief stated he had refused to\r\nhave anything to do with these offers. On being asked in the council by\r\nLord Selkirk, who was present, as to the feelings of the Indians towards\r\nthe settlers at Red River, he said that at the commencement of the Red\r\nRiver settlement some of the Indians did not like it, but at present\r\nthey are all glad of its being settled.\r\n\r\nLord Selkirk soon hastened on and overtook his expedition at Sault Ste.\r\nMarie, now consisting of two hundred and fifty men all told, and these\r\nbeing maintained at his private expense. They immediately proceeded\r\nwestward, intending to go to the extreme point of Lake Superior, near\r\nwhere the town of Duluth now stands, and where the name Fond du Lac\r\nis still retained. The expedition would then have gone north-westward\r\nthrough what is now Minnesota to Red Lake, from which point a descent\r\ncould have been made by boat, through Red Lake River and Red River\r\nto the very settlement itself. This route would have avoided the\r\nNor'-Westers altogether.\r\n\r\nWestward bound, the party had little more than left Sault Ste. Marie,\r\nduring the last week of July, when they were met on Lake Superior by\r\ntwo canoes, in one of which was Miles Macdonell, former Governor of\r\nRed River, who brought the sad intelligence of the second destruction\r\nof the colony and of the murder of Governor Semple and his attendants.\r\nHis Lordship was thrown into the deepest despair. The thought of his\r\nGovernor killed, wholesale murder committed, the poor settlers led\r\nby him from the Highland homes, where life at least was safe, to\r\nendure such fear and privation, was indeed a sore trial. To any one\r\nless moved by the spirit of philanthropy, it must have been a serious\r\ndisappointment, but to one feeling so thorough a sympathy for the\r\nsuffering and who was himself the very soul of honour, it was a crushing\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nHe resolved to change his course and to go to Fort William, the\r\nheadquarters of the Nor'-Westers. He now determined to act in his office\r\nas magistrate, and sought to induce two gentlemen of Sault Ste. Marie,\r\nMessrs. Ermatinger and Askin, both magistrates, to accompany him in\r\nthat capacity. They were unable to go. Compelled to proceed alone, he\r\nwrites from Sault Ste. Marie, on July 29th, to Sir John Sherbrooke, and\r\nafter speaking of his failure to induce the two gentlemen mentioned by\r\nhim to go, says, \"I am therefore reduced to the alternative of acting\r\nalone, or of allowing an audacious crime to pass unpunished. In these\r\ncircumstances I cannot doubt that it is my duty to act, though I am\r\nnot without apprehension that the law may be openly resisted by a set\r\nof people who have been accustomed to consider force as the only true\r\ncriterion of right.\"\r\n\r\nOne would have said, on looking at the matter dispassionately, that the\r\nGovernor-General, with a military force so far west as Drummond Isle in\r\nGeorgian Bay, would have taken immediate steps to bring to justice the\r\noffenders.\r\n\r\nGovernor Sherbrooke seems to have felt himself powerless, for he says\r\nin a despatch to Lord Bathurst, \"I beg leave to call your Lordship's\r\nserious attention to the forcible and, I fear, too just description\r\ngiven by the Earl of Selkirk of the state of the Red River territory. I\r\nleave to your Lordship to judge whether a banditti such as he describes\r\nwill yield to the influence, or be intimidated by the menaces of distant\r\nauthority.\" It may be well afterwards to contrast this statement of the\r\nGovernor's with subsequent despatches. It must not be forgotten that\r\nwhile \"the banditti\" was pursuing its course of violence in the far-off\r\nterritory, and, as has been stated, thoroughly under the direction and\r\nencouragement of the North-West Company partners, the leading members of\r\nthis Company, who held, many of them, high places in society and in the\r\nGovernment in Montreal, were posing as the lovers of peace and order,\r\nand were lamenting over the excesses of the Indians and Bois Brûlés. By\r\nthis course they were enabled to thwart any really effective measures\r\ntowards restoring peace at the far-away \"seat of war.\"\r\n\r\nThe action of the North-West Company may be judged from the following\r\nextracts from a letter of the Hon. John Richardson, one of the partners,\r\nand likewise a member of the executive council of Lower Canada,\r\naddressed to Governor Sherbrooke. He says on August 17th, 1816: \"It is\r\nwith much concern that I have to mention that blood has been shed at\r\nthe Red River to an extent greatly to be deplored; but it is consolatory\r\nto those interested in the North-West Company to find that none of their\r\ntraders or people were concerned, or at the time within a hundred miles\r\nof the scene of contest.\" What a commentary on such a statement are the\r\nstories of Pambrun and Huerter, given in a previous chapter! What a\r\ncold-blooded statement after all the plottings and schemes of the whole\r\nwinter before the attack! What a heartless falsehood as regards the\r\nIndians, who, under so great temptations, refused to be partners in so\r\nbloody an enterprise!\r\n\r\nThe resolution of Lord Selkirk to go to Fort William in the capacity of\r\na magistrate was one involving, as he well knew, many perils. He was\r\nnot, however, the man to shrink from a daring enterprise having once\r\nundertaken it.\r\n\r\nTo Fort William, then, with the prospect of meeting several hundreds\r\nof the desperate men of the North-West Company, Lord Selkirk made his\r\nway. So confident was he in the rectitude of his purpose and in the\r\njustice of his cause, that he pushed forward, and without the slightest\r\nhesitation encamped upon the Kaministiquia, on the south side of the\r\nriver, in sight of Fort William. The expedition arrived on August 12th.\r\nA demand was at once made on the officers of the North-West Company for\r\nthe release of a number of persons who had been captured at Red River\r\nafter the destruction of the colony and been brought to Fort William.\r\nThe Nor'-Westers denied having arrested these persons, and to give\r\ncolour to this assertion immediately sent them over to Lord Selkirk's\r\nencampment.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th and following days of the month of August, the depositions\r\nof a number of persons were taken before his Lordship as a justice\r\nof the peace. The depositions related to the guilt of the several\r\nNor'-Wester partners, their destroying the settlement, entering and\r\nremoving property from Fort Douglas, and the like; and were made by\r\nPambrun, Lavigne, Nolin, Blondeau, Brisbois, and others. It was made\r\nso clear to Lord Selkirk that the partners were guilty of inciting the\r\nattacks on the colony and of approving the outrages committed, that he\r\ndetermined to arrest a number of the leaders. This was done by regular\r\nprocess--by warrants served on Mr. McGillivray, Kenneth McKenzie, Simon\r\nFraser, and others, but these prisoners were allowed to remain in Fort\r\nWilliam.\r\n\r\nIn one case, that of a partner named John McDonald, resistance having\r\nbeen offered, the constables called for the aid of a party of the De\r\nMeurons, who had crossed over from the encampment with them in their\r\nboats. The leaving of the prisoners with their liberty in Fort William,\r\nhowever, gave the opportunity for conspiracy; and it was represented\r\nto Lord Selkirk that Fort William would be used for the purposes of\r\nresistance, and that the prisoners arrested would be released. The facts\r\nleading to this belief were that a canoe, laden with arms, had left\r\nthe fort at night; that eight barrels of gunpowder had been secreted\r\nin a thicket, and that these had been taken from the magazine; while\r\nsome forty stand of arms, fresh-loaded, had been found in a barn among\r\nsome hay. These indications proved that an attempt was about to be\r\nmade to resist the execution of the law, and accordingly the prisoners\r\nwere placed in one building and closely guarded, while Lord Selkirk's\r\nencampment was removed across the river and pitched in front of the fort\r\nto prevent any surprise.\r\n\r\nA further examination of the prisoners took place, and their criminality\r\nbeing so evident, they were sent to York, Upper Canada. Three canoes,\r\nwell manned and containing the prisoners, left the fort on August\r\n18th, under the charge of Lieutenant Fauche, one of the De Meuron\r\nofficers. The journey down the lakes was marred by a most unfortunate\r\naccident. One of the canoes was upset some fifteen miles from Sault Ste.\r\nMarie. This was caused by the sudden rise in the wind. The affair was\r\npurely accidental, and there were drowned one of the prisoners, named\r\nMcKenzie, a sergeant and a man of the De Meurons, and six Indians.\r\nThe prisoners were taken to Montreal and admitted to bail. The course\r\ntaken by Lord Selkirk at Fort William has been severely criticized, and\r\nbecame, indeed, the subject of subsequent legal proceedings. One of the\r\nNor'-Wester apologists stated to Governor Sherbrooke \"that the mode of\r\nproceeding under Lord Selkirk's orders resembled nothing British, and\r\nexceeded even the military despotism of the French in Holland.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt it would have been better had Lord Selkirk obtained other\r\nmagistrates to take part in the proceedings at Fort William, but we\r\nhave seen he did try this and failed. Had it been possible to have had\r\nthe arrests effected without the appearance of force made by the De\r\nMeurons, it would have been more agreeable to our ideas of ordinary\r\nlegal proceedings; but it must be remembered he was dealing with those\r\ncalled by a high authority \"a banditti.\" Could Fort William have been\r\nleft in the hands of its possessors, it would have been better; but\r\nthen there was clear evidence that the Nor'-Westers intended violence.\r\nTo have left Fort William in their possession would have been suicidal.\r\nIt would probably have been better that Lord Selkirk should not have\r\nstopped the canoes going into the interior with North-West merchandise,\r\nbut to have allowed them to proceed was only to have assisted his\r\nenemies--the enemies, moreover, of law and order. Thousands of pounds'\r\nworth of his property stolen from Fort Douglas by the agents of the\r\nNorth-West Company, and the fullest evidence in the depositions made\r\nbefore him that this was in pursuance of a plan devised by the Company\r\nand deliberately carried out! Several hundreds of lawless voyageurs\r\nand unscrupulous partners ready to use violence in the wild region of\r\nLake Superior, where, during fifty years preceding, they had committed\r\nnumerous acts of bloodshed, and had never been called to account! The\r\nworrying reflection that homeless settlers and helpless women and\r\nchildren were crying, in some region then unknown to him, for his\r\nassistance, after their wanton dispersion by their enemies from their\r\nhomes on the banks of Red River! All these things were sufficient to\r\nnerve to action one of far less generous impulses than Lord Selkirk.\r\n\r\nIs it at all surprising that his Lordship did not act with all the\r\ncalmness and scrupulous care of a judge on the bench, who, under\r\nfavourable circumstances, feels himself strong in his consciousness of\r\nsafety, supported by the myriad officers of the law, and surrounded by\r\nthe insignia of Justice? The justification of his course, even if it\r\nbe interpreted adversely, is, that in a state of violence, to preserve\r\nthe person is a preliminary to the settlement of other questions of\r\npersonal right. One thing at least is to Lord Selkirk's credit, that,\r\nas soon as possible, he handed over the law-breakers to be dealt with\r\nby the Canadian Courts, where, however, unfortunately, another divinity\r\npresided than the blind goddess of Justice.\r\n\r\nLet us now see where we are in our story. Lord Selkirk is at Fort\r\nWilliam. The Nor'-Wester partners have been sent to the East. It is\r\nnear the end of August, and the state of affairs at Fort William does\r\nnot allow the founder to pass on to his colony for the winter. He is\r\nsurrounded by his De Meuron settlers. During the months of autumn the\r\nexpedition is engaged in laying in supplies for the approaching winter,\r\nand opening up roads toward the Red River country. The season was spent\r\nin the usual manner of the Lake Superior country, shut out from the\r\nrest of the world. The winter over, Lord Selkirk started on May 1st,\r\n1817, for Red River, accompanied by his body-guard. The De Meurons had\r\npreceded him in the month of March, and, reaching the interior, restored\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThe colonizer arrived at his colony in the last week of June, and saw,\r\nfor the first time, the land of his dreams for the preceding fifteen\r\nyears. In order to restore peace, he endeavoured to carry out the\r\nterms of the proclamation issued by the Government of Canada, that all\r\nproperty taken during the troubles should be restored to its original\r\nowners. This restitution was made to a certain extent, though much that\r\nhad been taken from Fort Douglas was never recovered. The settlers were\r\nbrought back from their refuge at Norway House, and the settlement\r\nwas again organized. The colonists long after related, with great\r\nsatisfaction, how Lord Selkirk cheered them by his presence. After their\r\nreturn to their despoiled homesteads a gathering of the settlers took\r\nplace, and a full consideration of all their affairs was had in their\r\npatron's presence.\r\n\r\nThis gathering was at the spot where the church and burying-ground of\r\nSt. John's are now found. \"Here,\" said his Lordship, pointing to lot\r\nnumber four, on which they stood, \"here you shall build your church;\r\nand that lot,\" said he, pointing to lot number three across the little\r\nstream called Parsonage Creek, \"is for the school.\" The people then\r\nreminded his Lordship that he had promised them a minister, who should\r\nfollow them to their adopted country. This he at once acknowledged,\r\nsaying, \"Selkirk never forfeited his word;\" while he promised to give\r\nthe matter attention as soon as practicable. In addition, Lord Selkirk\r\ngave a document stating that, \"in consideration of the hardships which\r\nthe settlers had suffered, in consequence of the lawless conduct of\r\nthe North-West Company, his intention was to grant gratuitously the\r\ntwenty-four lots which had been occupied to those of the settlers who\r\nhad made improvements on their lands before they were driven away from\r\nthem in the previous year.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the dispersion of this public gathering of the people, the\r\nfounder gave the name, at the request of the colonists, to their\r\nsettlement. The name given by him to this first parish in Rupert's Land\r\nwas that of Kildonan, from their old home in the valley of Helmsdale,\r\nin Sutherlandshire, Scotland. In more fully organizing the colony, his\r\nLordship ordered a complete survey to be made of the land, and steps to\r\nbe taken towards laying out roads, building bridges, erecting mills, &c.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered, as already stated, that at the inception of the\r\ncolony scheme, in 1811, the Nor'-Westers had threatened the hostility of\r\nthe Indians. It may be mentioned as a strange fact that, to this day, it\r\nis a trick of the Bois Brûlés, taking their cue from the Nor'-Westers,\r\nwhen making any demand, to threaten the Government with the wrath of the\r\nIndians, over whom they profess to exercise a control. We have already\r\nseen that the Nor'-Westers' boast as to their influence over the Indians\r\nwas empty. In the publications of the Nor'-Westers of 1816-20 a speech\r\nis sometimes set forth of an Indian chief, \"Grandes Oreilles,\" breathing\r\nforth threatenings against the infant settlement. It is worthy of notice\r\nthat even this resource is swept away by the author of the speech, a\r\nNor'-Wester trader, confessing that he had manufactured the speech and\r\n\"Grandes Oreilles\" had never spoken it.\r\n\r\nWithin three weeks of his arrival at Red River Lord Selkirk carried\r\nout his promise of making a treaty with the Indians. All the Indians\r\nwere most willing to do this, as on many occasions during the troubles\r\nthey had, by giving early information as to the movements of the\r\nNor'-Westers, and by other means, shown their sympathy and feeling\r\ntoward the settlers. The object of the treaty was simply to do what\r\nhas since been done all over the north-west territories--to extinguish\r\nthe Indian title. The treaty is signed alike by Ojibway, Cree, and\r\nAssiniboine chiefs, the last mentioned being a tribe generally\r\nconsidered to belong to the Sioux stock. Lord Selkirk afterwards made\r\na treaty, on leaving the Red River, with the other Sioux nations\r\ninhabiting his territory. The chiefs were met at Red River by his\r\nLordship, and those whose names are attached to the treaty are, giving\r\ntheir French names in some cases as shorter than the Indian, Le Sonent,\r\nRobe Noire, Peguis, L'Homme Noir, and Grandes Oreilles. His Lordship\r\nseems to have had a most conciliatory and attractive manner. It is worth\r\nwhile closing this chapter by giving extracts from the speeches of these\r\nIndian chiefs, taken down at the grand council at which Lord Selkirk\r\nsmoked the pipe of peace with the assembled warriors.\r\n\r\nPeguis, the Saulteaux chief, always the fast friend of the colonists,\r\nsaid, \"When the English settlers first came here we received them with\r\njoy. It was not our fault if even the stumps of the brushwood were\r\ntoo rough for their feet; but misfortunes have since overtaken them.\r\nEvil-disposed men came here, calling themselves great chiefs, sent from\r\nour Great Father across the big lake, but we believe they were only\r\ntraders, pretending to be great chiefs on purpose to deceive us. They\r\nmisled the young men who are near us (a small party of Bois Brûlés\r\nencamped in the neighbourhood), and employed them to shed the blood of\r\nyour children and to drive away the settlers from this river. We do not\r\nacknowledge these men as an independent tribe. They have sprung up here\r\nand there like mushrooms and we know them not.\r\n\r\n\"At the first arrival of the settlers we were frequently solicited by\r\nthe North-West Company to frighten them away; but we were pleased to see\r\nthat our Great Father had sent some of his white children to live among\r\nus, and we refused to do or say anything against them. The traders even\r\ndemanded our calumets, and desired to commit our sentiments to paper,\r\nthat they might send to our Great Father; but we refused to acknowledge\r\nthe speeches which they wished to put into our mouths. We are informed\r\nthat they have told a tale that it was the Indians who drove away and\r\nmurdered the children of our Great Father, but it is a falsehood.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I saw the mischief that happened I went to Lake Winnipeg\r\nwith a few friends to wait for news from the English, but I could meet\r\nnone. We have reasons to be friends of the colony. When there were only\r\ntraders here we could not get a blanket, or a piece of cloth, without\r\nfurs to give in exchange. Our country is now almost destitute of furs,\r\nso that we were often in want; from the people of the colony we get\r\nblankets and cloth for the meat we procure them. The country abounds\r\nwith meat, which we can obtain, but to obtain furs is difficult.\"\r\n\r\nNext, L'Homme Noir, a chief of the Assiniboines, who had come from a\r\nlong distance, addressing Lord Selkirk, particularly declares, \"we were\r\noften harassed with solicitations to assist the Bois Brûlés in what they\r\nhave done against your children, but we always refused. We are sure you\r\nmust have had much trouble to come here. We have often been told you\r\nwere our enemy; but we have to-day the happiness to hear from your own\r\nmouth the words of a true friend. We receive the present you give us\r\nwith great pleasure and thankfulness.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this, Robe Noire, an Ojibway chief, spoke in like terms; when the\r\nveritable Grandes Oreilles, to whose spurious war speech we have already\r\nreferred, said as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"I am happy to see here our own father. Clouds have overwhelmed me. I\r\nwas a long time in doubt and difficulty, but now I begin to see clearly.\r\n\r\n\"We have reason to be happy this day. We know the dangers you must\r\nhave encountered to come so far. The truth you have spoken pleases us.\r\nWe thank you for the present you give us. There seems an end to our\r\ndistress, and it is you who have relieved us.\r\n\r\n\"When our young men are drunk they are mad; they know not what they say\r\nor what they do; but this must not be attended to; they mean no harm.\"\r\n\r\nLong after, Selkirk was remembered and beloved by these Indian tribes,\r\nwho spoke of him as the \"Silver Chief.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for the founder's work in his colony in 1817. His affairs\r\nurgently required attention elsewhere. In the language of a writer of\r\nthe period, \"having thus restored order, infused confidence in the\r\npeople, and given a certain aid to their activity, Lord Selkirk took\r\nhis final leave of the colony.\" With a guide and a few attendants he\r\njourneyed southward, passing through the country of the warlike Sioux,\r\nwith whom he made peace.\r\n\r\nThe writer had at one time in his possession a note-book with, in Lord\r\nSelkirk's writing, an itinerary of his journey from Red River Colony,\r\nin which familiar names, such as Rivière Sale, Rivière Aux Gratias,\r\nPembina, and the like, appear with their distances in leagues. Among\r\nother memoranda is one, \"lost on the Prairie,\" and the distance in\r\nleagues estimated as lost by the misadventure. Every traveller over the\r\nManitoba prairie will take a feeling interest in that entry.\r\n\r\nPassing through the Mississippi country, he seems to have proceeded\r\neastward to Washington; he next appears in Albany, and hastens back to\r\nUpper Canada, without even visiting his family in Montreal, though he\r\nhad been absent from them for upwards of a year. In Upper Canada his\r\npresence was urgently needed to meet the artful machinations of his\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE BLUE-BOOK OF 1819 AND THE NORTH-WEST TRIALS.\r\n\r\n     British law disgraced--Governor Sherbrooke's distress--A\r\n     Commission decided on--Few unbiassed Canadians--Colonel Coltman\r\n     chosen--Over ice and snow--Alarming rumours--The Prince\r\n     Regent's order--Coltman at Red River--The Earl submissive--The\r\n     Commissioner's report admirable--The celebrated Reinhart\r\n     case--Disturbing lawsuits--Justice perverted--A store-house of\r\n     facts--Sympathy of Sir Walter Scott--Lord Selkirk's death--Tomb at\r\n     Orthes, in France.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe state of things in Rupert's Land in 1816 was a disgrace to British\r\ninstitutions. That subjects of the realm, divided into two parties,\r\nshould be virtually carrying on war against each other on British soil,\r\nwas simply intolerable. Not only was force being used, but warrants were\r\nbeing issued and the forms of law employed on both sides to carry out\r\nthe selfish ends of each party. An impartial historian cannot but say\r\nthat both parties were chargeable with grievous wrong.\r\n\r\nSir John Coape Sherbrooke, Governor-General of Canada, felt very keenly\r\nthe shameful situation, and yet the difficulties of transport and the\r\nremote distance of the interior where the conflict was taking place made\r\ninterference almost impossible. He was in constant communication with\r\nLord Bathurst, the Imperial Colonial Secretary.\r\n\r\nGovernor Sherbrooke's difficulties were, however, more than those of\r\ndistance. The influence of the North-West Company in Canada was supreme,\r\nand public sentiment simply reflected the views of the traders. The plan\r\nof sending a commission to the interior to stop hostilities and examine\r\nthe conflicting statements which were constantly coming to the Governor,\r\nseemed the most feasible; but with his sense of British fair-play,\r\nGovernor Sherbrooke knew he could find no one suitable to recommend.\r\n\r\nAt last, driven to take some action, Sir John named Mr. W. B. Coltman,\r\na merchant of Quebec and a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Militia, a man\r\naccustomed to Government matters, and one who bore a good reputation for\r\nfairness and justice. With this Commissioner, who did not enter on his\r\ntask with much alacrity, was associated Major Fletcher, a man of good\r\nlegal qualifications.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners were instructed to proceed immediately to the\r\nNorth-West. They were invested with the power of magistrates, and were\r\nauthorized to make a thorough investigation into the troubles which were\r\ndisturbing the country. \"You are particularly,\" say the instructions,\r\n\"to apply yourselves to mediate between the contending parties in the\r\naforesaid territories; to remove, as far as possible, all causes of\r\ndissension between them; to take all legal measures to prevent the\r\nrecurrence of those violences which have already so unhappily disturbed\r\nthe public peace; and generally to enforce and establish, within the\r\nterritory where you shall be, the influence and authority of the laws.\"\r\n\r\nVarious accidents prevented the Commissioners from leaving for the\r\nIndian country as soon as had been expected. They did not reach York\r\n(Toronto) till November 23rd, and on their arriving on the shores of\r\nLake Huron they found the lake frozen over and impassable. They could\r\ndo nothing themselves other than return to York, but they succeeded in\r\nfitting out an expedition under North-Western auspices to find its way\r\nover the ice and snow to Fort William, carrying the revocation of all\r\nthe commissions of magistrates west of Sault Ste. Marie and the news of\r\nthe new appointments in their stead. Reports during the winter continued\r\nto be of a disquieting kind, and as the spring drew nigh, preparations\r\nwere made for sending up the Commissioners with a small armed force.\r\n\r\nThe gravity of the situation may be judged from the steps taken\r\nby the Imperial Government and the instructions sent out by the\r\nauthority of George, the Prince Regent, to Governor Sherbrooke to\r\nissue a proclamation in his name calling on all parties to desist from\r\nhostilities, and requiring all military officers or men employed by any\r\nof the parties to immediately retire from such service. All property,\r\nincluding forts or trading stations, was to be immediately restored to\r\nthe rightful owners, and any impediment or blockade preventing transport\r\nto be at once removed.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that the proclamation and instructions given had\r\nthe desired effect. Coltman and his fellow Commissioner left in May for\r\nthe field of their operations, accompanied by forty men of the 37th\r\nRegiment as a body-guard. On arriving at Sault Ste. Marie, Commissioner\r\nColtman, after waiting two or three weeks, hastened on to Fort William,\r\nleaving Fletcher and the troops to follow him. On July 2nd he wrote from\r\nthe mouth of the River Winnipeg, stating that his presence had no doubt\r\ntended to preserve peace in the North-West, and that in two days he\r\nwould see Lord Selkirk in his own Fort Douglas at Red River.\r\n\r\nThree days after the despatch of this letter, Commissioner Coltman\r\narrived at Red River. He immediately grappled with the difficulties and\r\nmet them with much success. The news of Lord Selkirk's actions had all\r\narrived at Montreal through the North-West sources, so that both in\r\nQuebec and London a strong prejudice had sprung up against his Lordship.\r\nColonel Coltman found, however, that Lord Selkirk had been much\r\nmisrepresented. The illegal seizures he had made at Fort William were\r\ndictated only by prudence in dealing with what he considered a daring\r\nand treacherous enemy. He had submitted to the ordinance recalling\r\nmagistrates' commissions immediately on receiving it. Colonel Coltman\r\nwas so impressed with Lord Selkirk's reasonableness and good faith that\r\nhe recommended that the legal charges made against him should not be\r\nproceeded with.\r\n\r\nColonel Coltman then started on his return journey, and wrote that\r\nhe had stopped at the mouth of the Winnipeg River for the purpose of\r\ninvestigating the conspiracy, in which he states he fears the North-West\r\nCompany had been implicated, to destroy the Selkirk settlement. The\r\nenergetic Commissioner returned to Quebec in November of that year.\r\nGovernor Sherbrooke had the satisfaction of reporting to Lord Bathurst\r\nthe return of Mr. Coltman from his mission to the Indian territories,\r\nand \"that the general result of his exertions had been so far\r\nsuccessful, that he had restored a degree of tranquillity there which\r\npromises to continue during the winter.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Coltman's report, of about one hundred folio pages, is an\r\nadmirable one. His summary of the causes and events of the great\r\nstruggle between the Companies is well arranged and clearly stated. The\r\nwriter, in an earlier work, strongly took up Lord Selkirk's view of\r\nthe case, and criticised Coltman. Subsequent investigations and calmer\r\nreflection have led him to the conclusion that while Lord Selkirk was in\r\nthe right and exhibited a high and noble character, yet the provoking\r\ncircumstances came from both directions, and Colonel Coltman's account\r\nseems fairly impartial.\r\n\r\nThe cessation of hostilities brought about by the influence of Colonel\r\nColtman did not, however, bring a state of peace. The conflict was\r\ntransferred to the Courts of Lower and Upper Canada, these having been\r\ngiven power some time before by the Imperial Parliament to deal with\r\ncases in the Indian territories.\r\n\r\nA _cause célèbre_ was that of the trial of Charles Reinhart, an employé\r\nof the North-West Company, who had been a sergeant in the disbanded\r\nDe Meuron Regiment. Having gone to the North-West, he was during the\r\ntroubles given charge of a Hudson's Bay Company official named Owen\r\nKeveny, against whom it was urged that he had maltreated a servant of\r\nthe North-West Company. In bringing Keveny down from Lake Winnipeg to\r\nRat Portage, it was brought against Reinhart that at a place called the\r\nFalls of the River Winnipeg, he had brutally killed the prisoner under\r\nhis charge. While Lord Selkirk was at Fort William, Reinhart arrived\r\nat that point and made a voluntary confession before his Lordship as\r\na magistrate. This case was afterwards tried at Quebec and gave rise\r\nto an argument as to the jurisdiction of the Court, viz. whether the\r\npoint where the murder occurred on the River Winnipeg was in Upper\r\nCanada, Lower Canada, or the Indian territories. Though Reinhart was\r\nfound guilty, sentence was not carried out, probably on account of the\r\nuncertainty of jurisdiction. The Reinhart case became an important\r\nprecedent in settling the boundary line of Upper Canada, and also in\r\ndealing with the troubles arising out of the Riel rebellion of 1869.\r\n\r\nIn the year after Colonel Coltman's return, numerous cases were referred\r\nto the Courts, all these arising out of the violence at Red River.\r\nColonel Coltman had bound Lord Selkirk, though only accused of an\r\noffence amounting to a misdemeanour, in the large sum of 6,000_l._ and\r\nunder two sureties of 3,000_l._ each--in all 12,000_l._ Mr. Gale, Lord\r\nSelkirk's legal adviser, called attention to the illegality of this\r\nproceeding, but all to no effect.\r\n\r\nAfter Lord Selkirk had settled up his affairs with his colonists, he\r\njourneyed south from the Red River to St. Louis in the Western States,\r\nand then went eastward to Albany in New York, whence he appeared in\r\nSandwich in Upper Canada, the circuit town where information had been\r\nlaid. Here he found four accusations made against him by the North-West\r\nCompany. These were: (1) Having stolen eighty-three muskets at Fort\r\nWilliam; (2) Having riotously entered Fort William, August 13th; (3)\r\nAssault and false imprisonment of Deputy-Sheriff Smith; (4) Resistance\r\nto legal warrant.\r\n\r\nOn these matters being taken up, the first charge was so contradictory\r\nthat the magistrates dismissed it; but the other three could not be\r\ndealt with on account of the absence of witnesses, and so bail was\r\naccepted from Lord Selkirk of 350_l._ for his appearance. When Lord\r\nSelkirk presented himself at Montreal to answer to the charges for which\r\nColonel Coltman's heavy bail had bound him, the Court admitted it had no\r\njurisdiction, but with singular high-handedness bound Lord Selkirk to\r\nappear in Upper Canada under the same bail.\r\n\r\nIn Montreal in May, 1818, an action was brought before Chief Justice\r\nMonk and Justice Bowen against Colin Robertson and four others, charging\r\nthem with riotously destroying Fort Gibraltar, the Nor'-Wester fort.\r\nA number of witnesses were called, including Miles Macdonell, John\r\nPritchard, Auguste Cadot, and others. A verdict of not guilty was\r\nrendered.\r\n\r\nIn September of the same year a charge was laid against Lord Selkirk\r\nand others of a conspiracy to ruin the trade of the North-West Company.\r\nThis was before the celebrated Chief Justice Powell. The grand jury\r\nrefused to give the Chief Justice an answer in the case. The Court was\r\nsummarily adjourned, and legislation was introduced at the next meeting\r\nof the Legislature of Upper Canada to remedy defects in the Act in order\r\nthat the case might be tried. Afterward the cases were taken up in York,\r\nand Deputy-Sheriff Smith was given a verdict against Lord Selkirk for\r\n500_l._, and McKenzie, a North-West partner, a verdict of 1,500_l._ for\r\nfalse imprisonment at Fort William. The general impression has always\r\nprevailed there that the whole procedure in these cases against Lord\r\nSelkirk was high-handed and unjust, though it is quite possible that\r\nLord Selkirk had exceeded his powers in the troubled state of affairs at\r\nFort William.\r\n\r\nOn his Lordship's side charges were also brought in October, 1818. In\r\nthe full Court Chief Justice Powell and Justices Campbell and Boulter\r\npresided. The most notable of these cases was against Cuthbert Grant,\r\nBoucher, and sixteen others as either principals or accessories in the\r\nmurder of Robert Semple on June 19th, 1816. A few days later, in the\r\nsame month, a slightly different charge was brought against six of the\r\nNorth-West partners in connection with the murder of Governor Semple.\r\nUpwards of three hundred pages of evidence gave a minute and complete\r\naccount of the affair of Seven Oaks and of the whole conflict as found\r\nin a volume of Canadian trials. In these two cases a verdict of not\r\nguilty was also rendered.\r\n\r\nTwo other trials, one by Lord Selkirk's party against Paul Brown for\r\nrobbery of a blanket and a gun, and the other against John Cooper\r\nand Hugh Bannerman for stealing a cannon in a dwelling-house of Lord\r\nSelkirk, were also carried through, with in both cases a verdict of not\r\nguilty. The evidence in these cases was printed by both parties, with\r\nfoot-notes, giving a colour to each side concerned of a more favourable\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nSo much for this most disheartening controversy. It would be idle to\r\nsay that Lord Selkirk was faultless; but as we dispassionately read\r\nthe accounts of the trials, and consider that while Lord Selkirk was\r\nfriendless in Canada, the North-West Company had enormous influence, we\r\ncannot resist the conclusion that advantage was taken of his Lordship,\r\nand that justice was not done. It is true that, in the majority of\r\ncases, the conclusion was reached that it was impossible to precisely\r\nplace the blame on either side; but we cannot be surprised that Lord\r\nSelkirk, harassed and discouraged by the difficulties of his colony and\r\nhis treatment in the courts of Upper Canada and Lower Canada, should\r\nwrite as he did in October, 1818, to the Duke of Richmond, the new\r\nGovernor-General of Canada:--\r\n\r\n\"To contend alone and unsupported, not only against a powerful\r\nassociation of individuals, but also against all those whose official\r\nduty it should have been to arrest them in the prosecution of their\r\ncrimes, was at the best an arduous task; and, however confident one\r\nmight be of the intrinsic strength of his cause, it was impossible to\r\nfeel a very sanguine expectation that this alone would be sufficient to\r\nbear him up against the swollen tide of corruption which threatened to\r\noverwhelm him. He knew that in persevering under existing circumstances\r\nhe must necessarily submit to a heavy sacrifice of personal comfort,\r\nincur an expense of ruinous amount, and possibly render himself the\r\nobject of harassing and relentless persecution.\"\r\n\r\nThough Lord Selkirk crossed the Atlantic in 1818, yet the sounds of the\r\njudicial battle through which he had passed were still in his ears. In\r\nJune his friend, Sir James Montgomery, brought the matter before the\r\nBritish House of Commons, moving for all the official papers in the\r\ncase. The motion was carried, and the Blue Book containing this matter\r\nis a store-house where we may find the chief facts of this long and\r\nheart-breaking struggle recorded.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1818, we find in a copy of a letter in the possession of the\r\nwriter, written by Sir Walter Scott, a reference to the very poor health\r\nof his Lordship. Worn out and heart-broken by his trials, Lord Selkirk\r\ndid not rally, but in the course of a few months died at Pau, in the\r\nSouth of France, April, 1820. His Countess and daughters had accompanied\r\nhim to Montreal on his Canadian visit, and they were now with him to\r\nsoothe his dying hours and to see him laid to rest in the Protestant\r\ncemetery of Orthes.\r\n\r\nThough he was engaged in a difficult undertaking in seeking so early\r\nin the century to establish a colony on the Red River, and though it\r\nhas been common to represent him as being half a century before his\r\ntime, yet we cannot resist the conclusion that he was an honourable,\r\npatriotic, and far-seeing man, and that the burden of right in this\r\ngrand conflict was on his side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nMEN WHO PLAYED A PART.\r\n\r\n     The crisis reached--Consequences of Seven Oaks--The\r\n     noble Earl--His generous spirit--His mistakes--Determined\r\n     courage--Deserves the laurel crown--The first Governor--Macdonell's\r\n     difficulties--His unwise step--A Captain in red--Cameron's\r\n     adroitness--A wearisome imprisonment--Last governor of Fort\r\n     Gibraltar--The Metis chief--Half-breed son of old Cuthbert--A\r\n     daring hunter--Warden of the plains--Lord Selkirk's agent--A Red\r\n     River patriarch--A faithful witness--The French bard--Western war\r\n     songs--Pierriche Falcon.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe skirmish of Seven Oaks was the most notable event that ever occurred\r\non the prairies of Rupert's Land or in the limits of the fur country.\r\nIt was the crisis which indicated the determination of the Company,\r\nwhose years were numbered by a century and a half, to hold its own in\r\na great contest, and of the pluck of a British nobleman to show the\r\n\"_perfervidum ingenium Scotorum_,\" and unflinchingly to meet either in\r\narms or legal conflict the fur-trading oligarchy of that time in Canada.\r\nIt represented, too, the fierce courage and desperate resource of the\r\ntraders of the great Canadian Company, who, we have seen, were called by\r\nWashington Irving \"the lords of the lakes and forests.\"\r\n\r\nIt was also the _dénouement_ which led the Old and the New Worlds' fur\r\ncompanies, despite the heat of passion and their warmth of sentiment, to\r\nmake a peace which saved both from impending destruction.\r\n\r\nIt led, moreover, to the sealing up for half a century of Rupert's Land\r\nto all energetic projects and influx of population, and allowed Sir\r\nGeorge Simpson to build up for the time being the empire of the buffalo,\r\nthe beaver, and the fox, instead of developing a home of industry.\r\n\r\nCrises such as this develop character and draw out the powers of men\r\nwho would otherwise waste their sweetness on the desert air. The\r\nshock of meeting of two such great bodies as the Hudson's Bay Company\r\nand the North-West Company enabled men to show courage, loyalty, honest\r\nindignation, decision of character, shrewdness, diplomatic skill, and\r\ngreat endurance. These are the elements of human character. It is ever\r\nworth while to examine the motives, features of action, and ends aimed\r\nat by men under the trying circumstances of such a conflict. At the\r\nrisk of some repetition we give sketches of the lives of several of the\r\nleading persons concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARL OF SELKIRK.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD SELKIRK.]\r\n\r\nChief, certainly, of the actors who appeared on this stage was Lord\r\nSelkirk. Born to the best traditions of the Scottish nobility, Thomas\r\nDouglas belonged to the Angus-Selkirk family, which represented the\r\nDouglases of Border story, one of whom boasted that no ancestor of his\r\nhad for ten generations died within chambers. Lord Daer, as his title\r\nthen was, had studied at Edinburgh University, was an intimate friend of\r\nSir Walter Scott, and though a Lowlander, had formed a great attachment\r\nfor the Highlanders and had learned their language. He was, moreover, of\r\nmost active mind, broad sympathies, and generous impulses. At the age of\r\nthirty years, having become Earl of Selkirk, he sought to take part in\r\nassisting the social condition of Britain, which was suffering greatly\r\nfrom the Napoleonic wars. He took a large colony of Highlanders to\r\nPrince Edward Island, acquired land in Upper Canada and also in New York\r\nState, and then, solely for the purpose of helping on his emigration\r\nproject, entered on the gigantic undertaking of gaining control of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company. In all these things he succeeded. We have seen the\r\nconflicts into which he was led and the manly way in which he conducted\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nWe do not say he made no mistakes. We frankly admit that he went beyond\r\nthe ordinary powers of a magistrate's commission at Fort William. But we\r\nbelieve his aim was good. He was convinced that the Nor'-Westers had no\r\nlegal right to the Hudson's Bay Company lands over which they traded.\r\nHe believed them to be unscrupulous and dangerous, and his course was\r\ntaken to meet the exigency of the case. It must be remembered his\r\nresponsibility was a great one. His Highland and Irish colonists at\r\nRed River were helpless; he was their only defence; no British law was\r\npresent at Red River to help them. They were regarded as intruders, as\r\nenemies of the fur trade, and he felt that loyalty and right compelled\r\nhim to act as he did.\r\n\r\nNo doubt it seemed to the Canadian traders--who considered themselves as\r\nthe successors of the French who, more than three-quarters of a century\r\nbefore, had established forts at what was called the post of the Western\r\nSea--a high-handed and even foolhardy thing to bring his colony by way\r\nof Hudson Bay, and to plant them down at the forks on Red River, in a\r\nremote and probably unsuccessful colony. However, in the main the legal\r\nright was with his Lordship. The popular feeling in Canada toward Lord\r\nSelkirk was far from being a pure one, and a fair-minded person can\r\nhardly refrain from saying it was an interested and selfish one.\r\n\r\nCertainly, as we see him, Lord Selkirk was a high-minded, generous,\r\nfar-seeing, adventurous, courageous, and honourable man. We may admit\r\nthat his opinion of the North-West Company opponents was a prejudiced\r\nand often unjust one. But we linger on the picture of his Lordship\r\nreturning from Montreal with his Countess, their two young daughters,\r\nthe one afterward Lady Isabella Hope, and the other Lady Katherine\r\nWigram, with the young boy who grew up to be the last Earl of Selkirk;\r\nwe think of him worried by the lawsuits and penalties of which we have\r\nspoken, going home to meet the British Government somewhat prejudiced\r\nagainst him as having been a personage in what they considered a\r\ndangerous _émeute_: we follow him passing over to France, attended\r\nby his family, and dying in a foreign land--and we are compelled to\r\nsay, how often does the world persecute its benefactors and leave its\r\ngreatest uncrowned. The Protestant cemetery at Orthes contains the bones\r\nof one who, under other circumstances, might have been crowned with\r\nlaurel.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR MILES MACDONELL.\r\n\r\nEngaged by Lord Selkirk to lead his first company and superintend the\r\nplanting of his colony, Capt. Miles Macdonell found himself thrust\r\ninto a position of danger and responsibility as local governor at\r\nRed River. He was a man with a considerable experience. Of Highland\r\norigin, he had with his father, John Macdonell, called \"Scotas,\" from\r\nhis residence in Scotland, settled in the valley of the Mohawk River,\r\non the estates of Sir William Johnson, in New York State. The estates\r\nof Sir William were a hotbed of loyalism, and here was enlisted by his\r\nson, Sir John Johnson, under the authority of the British Government,\r\nat the time of the American Revolution, the well-known King's Royal\r\nRegiment of New York, familiarly known as the \"Royal Greens.\" The\r\nolder Macdonell was a captain in this regiment, and Miles, as a boy\r\nof fifteen, was commissioned as ensign. Afterward the young Macdonell\r\nreturned to Scotland, where he married, and again came to Canada.\r\nFollowing a military career, he was engaged by Lord Selkirk shortly\r\nbefore the war of 1812 to lead his colony to the Red River. We have\r\nseen how faithfully, both at York Factory and the Red River, he served\r\nhis Lordship. The chief point in dispute in connection with Governor\r\nMacdonell is whether the embargo against the export of supplies from\r\nRed River in 1814 was legal or not. If it was not, then on him rests\r\nmuch of the responsibility for the troubles which ensued. The seizure\r\nof pemmican, belonging to the North-West Company, at the mouth of\r\nthe Souris River, seems to have been high-handed. Undoubtedly Miles\r\nMacdonell believed it to be necessary for the support of the settlers\r\nin the country. His life was one of constant worry after this event.\r\nReprisals began between the parties. These at length ended in Miles\r\nMacdonell being seized by the North-West Company agents on June 22nd,\r\n1815, and taken as a prisoner to Fort William, and thence to Montreal.\r\nMacdonell lived upon the Ottawa till the time of his death in 1828.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of good mind and seemingly honest intentions. His military\r\neducation and experience probably gave him the habits of regularity and\r\ndecision which led to the statement made of him by the Hon. William\r\nMcGillivray, \"that he conducted himself like a Turkish bashaw.\" The\r\njustification of Governor Macdonell seems to be that the Nor'-Westers\r\nhad determined early in the history of the colony to destroy it, so\r\nthat the charges made against the Governor were merely an advantage\r\ntaken of disputed points. Capt. Macdonell's management at York Factory\r\nwas certainly judicious, and there seems but the one debatable point\r\nin his administration of Red River, and that was the proclamation of\r\nJanuary 8th, 1814.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUNCAN CAMERON.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable leaders on the Nor'-Wester side was Duncan\r\nCameron, who has the distinction of being the last commanding officer\r\nof Fort Gibraltar. Like Miles Macdonell, Duncan Cameron was the son of\r\na Highland U. E. Loyalist, who had been settled on the Hudson in New\r\nYork State. He entered the North-West Company in 1785 and fourteen years\r\nafter was in charge of Nepigon district, as we have seen. He gained\r\nmuch distinction for his company by his daring and skilful management\r\nof the plan to induce the Selkirk settlers to leave Red River and\r\nsettle in Upper Canada. Coming from the meeting of the Nor'-Westers in\r\nGrand Portage, in 1814 Cameron took up his abode in Fort Gibraltar,\r\nand according to the story of his opponents did so with much pomp and\r\ncircumstance. Miles Macdonell says:--\"Mr. Duncan Cameron arrived at\r\nRed River, sporting a suit of military uniform, gave himself out as\r\ncaptain in his Majesty's service, and acting by the King's authority for\r\nSir George Prevost.\" Every well-informed person looked upon this as a\r\nself-created appointment, at most a North-West trick; but it had a very\r\nconsiderable effect upon the lower class of people.\r\n\r\nIn regard to this the writer in his work on \"Manitoba,\" London, 1882,\r\ntook up strong ground against Cameron. The calming influence of years,\r\nand the contention which has been advanced that there was some ground\r\nfor Cameron claiming the commission in the \"Voyageur Corps\" which he\r\nformerly held, has led the writer to modify his opinion somewhat as to\r\nCameron.\r\n\r\nCameron succeeded in leading away about three-quarters of the colony.\r\nThis he was appointed to do and he seems to have done it faithfully. The\r\nmeans by which he appealed to the Highland colonists may have been less\r\ndignified than might have been desired, yet his warm Highland nature\r\nattracted his own countrymen in the settlement, and they probably needed\r\nlittle persuasion to escape from their hardships to what was to them the\r\npromised land of Upper Canada.\r\n\r\nIn the following year (1816), as already stated, Cameron was in command\r\nof Fort Gibraltar, and it was determined by Governor Semple to destroy\r\nthe North-West fort and bring its material down the river to supplement\r\nthe colony establishment, Fort Douglas. Before this was done the same\r\ntreatment that was given to Governor Macdonell by the Nor'-Westers in\r\narresting him was meted out to Cameron. He was seized by Colin Robertson\r\nand carried away to York Factory, to be taken as a prisoner to England.\r\nThis high-handed proceeding was objectionable on several grounds. The\r\nImperial Parliament had transferred the right of dealing with offences\r\ncommitted in Rupert's Land to the Courts of Canada, so that Robertson's\r\naction was clearly _ultra vires_. Moreover, if the Hudson's Bay Company\r\nunder its charter exercised authority, it is questionable whether that\r\ngave the right to send a prisoner to Britain for trial, the more that no\r\ndefinite charge was laid against Cameron. Certainly Cameron had reason\r\nto complain of great injustice in this arrest. Taking him all in all, he\r\nwas a hot, impulsive Highland leader of men, persuasive and adroit, and\r\ndid not hesitate to adopt the means lying nearest to attain his purpose.\r\nThe fact that from 1823 to 1828, after he had left the Company's\r\nservice, he represented the County of Glengarry in the Upper Canadian\r\nLegislature, shows that those who knew him best had a favourable opinion\r\nabout this last commander of Fort Gibraltar. Fort Gibraltar was never\r\nrebuilt, its place and almost its very site under the United Company\r\nbeing taken by the original Fort Garry. Sir Roderick Cameron, of New\r\nYork, who has been connected with the Australian trade, was a son of\r\nDuncan Cameron.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTHBERT GRANT.\r\n\r\nThe skirmish of Seven Oaks brought into view a fact that had hardly made\r\nitself known before, viz., that a new race, the Metis, or half-breed\r\nchildren of the fur traders and employés by Indian women, were becoming\r\na guild or body able to exert its influence and beginning to realize its\r\npower.\r\n\r\nOf this rising and somewhat dangerous body a young Scottish half-breed,\r\nCuthbert Grant, had risen to sudden prominence as the leader. His\r\nfather, of the same name, had been a famous North-West trader, and was\r\nlooked upon as the special guardian of the Upper Assiniboine and Swan\r\nRiver district. He had died in 1799, but influential as he had been, the\r\nson became from circumstances much more so. The North-West Company knew\r\nthat the Scottish courage and endurance would stand them in good stead,\r\nand his Indian blood would give him a great following in the country.\r\nEducated in Montreal, he was fitted to be the leader of his countrymen.\r\nHis dash and enthusiasm were his leading characteristics. When the war\r\nparty came down from Qu'Appelle and Portage La Prairie, young Cuthbert\r\nGrant was its natural leader. When the fight took place he was well to\r\nthe front in the _mêlée_, and it is generally argued that his influence\r\nwas exerted toward saving the wounded and preventing acts of barbarity,\r\nsuch as savage races are prone to when the passions are aroused. On the\r\nnight of June 19th, when the victory had come to his party, Cuthbert\r\nGrant took possession of Fort Douglas, and the night was one for revelry\r\nexceeding what his Highland forbears had ever seen, or equal to any\r\nexultation of the Red man in his hour of triumph.\r\n\r\nIn after years, when peace had been restored, Cuthbert Grant settled\r\nin the neighbourhood of White Horse Plains, a region twenty miles west\r\nof Red River on the Assiniboine, and here became an influential man.\r\nHe was the leader of the hunt against the buffalo, on which every year\r\nthe adventurous young men went to bring back their winter supply of\r\nfood. In order that this might be properly managed, to protect life in\r\na dangerous sport and to preserve the buffalo from wanton destruction,\r\nstrict rules were agreed on and penalties attached to their breach.\r\nThe officer appointed by the Council of Assiniboia to carry out these\r\nlaws was called the \"Warden of the Plains.\" This office Cuthbert Grant\r\nfilled. Of the fifteen members of the Council of Assiniboia, Grant was\r\none, and he largely reflected the opinion of the French half-breed\r\npopulation of the Red River settlement. He was the hero of the plain\r\nhunters, and the native bards never ceased to sing his praises. His case\r\nis a remarkable example of the power that native representatives obtain\r\namong mixed communities.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN PRITCHARD.\r\n\r\nThe name of John Pritchard carries us back on the Red River to the\r\nbeginning of the century--to a time even before the coming of the\r\nSelkirk colony. His descendants to the fourth generation are still found\r\nin Manitoba and are well known. He was born in 1777 in a small village\r\nin Shropshire, England, and received his education in the famous Grammar\r\nSchool of Shrewsbury. Early in the century he emigrated to Montreal.\r\nAt that time the ferment among the fur traders was great. The old\r\nNorth-West Company of Montreal had split into sections, and to the new\r\nCompany, or X Y Company, young Pritchard was attached. We first hear\r\nof him at the mouth of the Souris River in 1805, and shortly after in\r\ncharge of one of the forts at that point where the Souris River empties\r\ninto the Assiniboine.\r\n\r\nWe have already given the incident of Pritchard being lost on the\r\nprairie for forty days. Pritchard does not seem to have taken kindly to\r\nthe United North-West Company, for at the time of the Seven Oaks affair\r\nwe find him as one of the garrison occupying Fort Douglas, although he\r\nrepresents himself as being a settler on the Red River.\r\n\r\nAfter the skirmish of Seven Oaks Pritchard sought to escape with the\r\nother settlers to the north of Lake Winnipeg, but was made prisoner by\r\nthe North-West Company's agents and taken to Fort William. Thence he\r\nwent east to Montreal and gave evidence in connection with the trials\r\narising out of the Red River troubles. Pritchard was a capable and ready\r\nman. His evidence is clear and well expressed. He had much facility in\r\ndoing business, and had a smooth, diplomatic manner that stood him in\r\ngood stead in troublous times.\r\n\r\nPritchard afterwards entered Lord Selkirk's service and as his agent\r\nwent over to London. Returning to the Red River settlement, he married\r\namong the people of Kildonan, and lived not far from the Kildonan\r\nChurch, on the east side of the river. A number of his letters have\r\nbeen printed, which show that he took a lively interest in the affairs\r\nof the settlement, especially in its religious concerns. It is not,\r\nthen, remarkable that among his descendants there should be no less than\r\nseven clergymen of the Church of England. It is interesting to know that\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company voted him about 1833 a gratuity of 25_l._ in\r\nconsideration of valuable services rendered by him to education, and\r\nespecially in the establishment of Sunday schools and day schools. This\r\nman, whose life was a chronicle of the history of the settlement, passed\r\naway in 1856 and was buried in St. John's Churchyard.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIERRE FALCON, THE RHYMESTER.\r\n\r\nAmong the wild rout of the Nor'-Westers at the skirmish of Seven Oaks\r\nwas a young French half-breed, whose father was a French Canadian\r\nengaged in the fur trade, and his mother an Indian woman from the\r\nMissouri country. The young combatant had been born in 1793, at Elbow\r\nFort, in the Swan River district. Taken as a child to Canada, young\r\nPierre lived for a time at Laprairie, and at the age of fifteen returned\r\nwith his father to the Red River, and with him engaged in the service\r\nof the North-West Company. What part Falcon took in the affair at Seven\r\nOaks we are not told, except that he behaved bravely, and saw Governor\r\nSemple killed.\r\n\r\nPierre Falcon was, however, the bard or poet of his people. This\r\ncharacteristic of Falcon is quite remarkable, considered in connection\r\nwith the time and circumstances. That a man who was unable to read or\r\nwrite should have been able to describe the striking events of his\r\ntime in verse is certainly a notable thing. He never tires singing in\r\ndifferent times and metres the valour of the Bois Brûlés at Seven Oaks.\r\n\r\n    \"Voulez-vous écouter chanter\r\n    Une chanson de vérité?\r\n    Le dix-neuf Juin, la bande des Bois Brûlés\r\n    Sont arrivés comme des braves guerriers.\"\r\n\r\nThen with French gaiety and verve he gives an account of the attack on\r\nthe Orkneymen, as he calls them, and recites the Governor's action and\r\nhis death. Falcon finishes up the chanson with a wild hurrah of triumph--\r\n\r\n    \"Les Bois Brûlés jetaient des cris de joie.\"\r\n\r\nThe lively spirit of the rhymester broke out in song upon all the\r\nprincipal events which agitated the people of the settlement. Joseph\r\nTassé, to whom we are chiefly indebted in this sketch, says of him,\r\n\"all his compositions are not of the same interest, but they are sung\r\nby our voyageurs to the measured stroke of the oar, on the most distant\r\nrivers and lakes of the North-West. The echoes of the Assiniboine, the\r\nMackenzie, and Hudson Bay will long repeat them.\"\r\n\r\nThe excitable spirit of the rhymer never left him. At the time of the\r\nRiel rebellion (1869-70) Falcon was still alive, and though between\r\nseventy and eighty years of age, he wished to march off with his gun to\r\nthe fray, declaring that \"while the enemy would be occupied in killing\r\nhim his friends would be able to give hard and well-directed blows to\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nFor about half a century he lived on the White Horse Plains, twenty\r\nmiles or more up the Assiniboine from Winnipeg, and became an\r\ninfluential man in the neighbourhood. His mercurial disposition seems to\r\nhave become more settled than in his fiery youth, for though unlettered,\r\nhe was made a justice of the peace.\r\n\r\nHis verse-making was, of course, of a very simple and unfinished kind.\r\nOne of his constant fashions was to end it with a declaration that it\r\nwas made by Falcon, the singer of his people.\r\n\r\n    \"Qui en a fait la chanson?\r\n    Un poète de canton;\r\n    Au bout de la chanson\r\n    Nous vous le nommerons.\r\n    Un jour étant à table,\r\n    A boire et à chanter,\r\n    A chanter tout au long\r\n    La nouvelle chanson.\r\n    Amis, buvons, trinquons,\r\n    Saluons la chanson\r\n    De Pierriche Falcon,\r\n    Ce faiseur de chanson.\"\r\n\r\nThe last line being often varied to\r\n\r\n    \"Pierre Falcon, le bon garçon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR SIMPSON UNITES ALL INTERESTS.\r\n\r\n     Both Companies in danger--Edward Ellice, a mediator--George\r\n     Simpson, the man of destiny--Old feuds buried--Gatherings at Norway\r\n     House--Governor Simpson's skill--His marvellous energy--Reform in\r\n     trade--Morality low--A famous canoe voyage--Salutes fired--Pompous\r\n     ceremony at Norway House--Strains of the bagpipe--Across the Rocky\r\n     Mountains--Fort Vancouver visited--Great executive ability--The\r\n     governor knighted--Sir George goes around the world--Troubles of a\r\n     book--Meets the Russians--Estimate of Sir George.\r\n\r\n\r\nAffairs in Rupert's Land had now reached their worst and had begun\r\nto mend, the strong hand of British law had made itself felt, and\r\nhostilities had ceased from Fort William to far-off Qu'Appelle and to\r\nthe farther distant Mackenzie River. The feeling of antagonism was,\r\nhowever, stirring in the bosoms of both parties. The death of Lord\r\nSelkirk in France brought the opposing fur traders closer together,\r\nand largely through the influence of Hon. Edward Ellice, a prominent\r\nNor'-Wester, a reconciliation between the hostile Companies took place\r\nand a union was formed on March 26th, 1821, under the name of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of both Companies had been brought to the verge of\r\ndestruction by the conflicts, and the greatest satisfaction prevailed\r\nboth in England and Canada at the union. The prospect now was that\r\nthe stability of the English Company and the energy of the Canadian\r\ncombination would result in a great development of the fur trade.\r\n\r\nAs is so often the case, the man for the occasion also appeared. This\r\nwas not an experienced man, not a man long trained in the fur trade, not\r\neven a man who had done more than spend the winter in the fur country at\r\nLake Athabasca. He was simply a young clerk, who had approved himself\r\nin the London Hudson's Bay Company office to Andrew Colville, a relation\r\nof the Earl of Selkirk. He was thus free from the prejudices of either\r\nparty and young enough to be adaptable in the new state of things. This\r\nman was George Simpson, a native of Ross-shire, in Scotland. He was\r\nshort of stature, but strong, vigorous, and observing. He was noted\r\nfor an ease and affability of manner that stood him in good stead all\r\nthrough his forty years of experience as chief officer of the Hudson's\r\nBay Company. He became a noted traveller, and made the canoe voyage from\r\nMontreal to the interior many times. For many years the Nor'-Westers,\r\nas we have seen, held their annual gathering at Grand Portage on\r\nLake Superior, and it was to this place that the chief officers had\r\nannually resorted. The new element of the English Company coming in\r\nfrom Hudson Bay now made a change necessary. Accordingly, Norway House\r\non Lake Winnipeg became the new centre, and for many years the annual\r\ngathering of the Company leaders in the active trade took place here.\r\nThe writer has had the privilege of perusing the minutes of some of\r\nthese gatherings, which were held shortly after Governor Simpson was\r\nappointed. These are valuable as showing the work done by the young\r\nGovernor and his method of dealing with difficulties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR GEORGE SIMPSON.]\r\n\r\nWhile it has always been said that Governor Simpson was dictatorial and\r\noverbearing, it will be seen that at this stage he was conciliatory and\r\nconsiderate. He acted like the chairman of a representative body of men\r\ncalled together to consult over their affairs, the members having equal\r\nrights. On June 23rd, 1823, one of his first meetings was held at Norway\r\nHouse. Reports were given in detail from the various posts and districts\r\nin turn. Bow River, at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, was reported as\r\nabandoned; from the Upper Red River, it was stated that on account of\r\nprairie fires the buffalo were few, and that the wild Assiniboines had\r\nbetaken themselves to the Saskatchewan to enjoy its plenty.\r\n\r\nFrom Lower Red River came the news that the attempt to prevent the\r\nnatives trading in furs had been carried rather too far. Furs belonging\r\nto a petty trader, Laronde, had been seized, confiscated, and sent to\r\nHudson Bay. It was learned that Laronde had not been duly aware of the\r\nnew regulations, and it was ordered that compensation be made to him.\r\nThis was done, and he and his family were fully satisfied. The Catholic\r\nMission at Pembina had been moved down to the Forks, where now St.\r\nBoniface stands, and the desire was expressed that the traders should\r\nwithdraw their trade as much as possible from the south side of the\r\nUnited States' boundary line.\r\n\r\nThe reports from the Selkirk settlement were of a favourable kind. The\r\nSioux, who had come from their land of the Dakotas to meet Lord Selkirk,\r\nwere not encouraged to make any further visits. The Selkirk colony was\r\nsaid to be very prosperous, and it is stated that it was the intention\r\nof the new Company soon to take over the property belonging to Lord\r\nSelkirk in the colony.\r\n\r\nSome conflicts had arisen in the Lac La Pluie (Rainy Lake) district,\r\nand these were soothed and settled. Reference is made to the fact that\r\nGrand Portage having been found to be on United States' territory, new\r\narrangements had been made for avoiding collision with the Americans.\r\n\r\nReports were even given in of prosperous trade in the far-distant\r\nColumbia, and steps were taken at various points to reduce the number of\r\nposts, the union of the Companies having made this possible.\r\n\r\nIn all these proceedings, there may be seen the influence of the\r\ndiplomatic and shrewd young Governor doing away with difficulties and\r\nmaking plans for the extension of a successful trade in the future. It\r\nwas not surprising that the Council invested Governor Simpson with power\r\nto act during the adjournment.\r\n\r\nSometimes at Moose Factory, now at York, then at Norway House, and again\r\nat Red River, the energetic Governor paid his visits. He was noted for\r\nthe imperious and impetuous haste with which he drove his voyageurs\r\nthrough the lonely wilds. For years a story was prevalent in the Red\r\nRiver country that a stalwart French voyageur, who was a favourite with\r\nthe Governor, was once, in crossing the Lake of the Woods, so irritated\r\nby the Governor's unreasonable urging, that he seized his tormentor,\r\nwho was small in stature, by the shoulders, and dipped him into the\r\nlake, giving vent to his feelings in an emphatic French oath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORT WILLIAM, LAKE SUPERIOR.\r\n\r\n_As seen by the writer in 1865._]\r\n\r\nThe Governor knew how to attach his people to himself, and he gathered\r\naround him in the course of his career of forty years a large number of\r\nmen most devoted to the interests of the Company. His visits to Fort\r\nGarry on the Red River were always notable. He was approachable to the\r\nhumblest, and listened to many a complaint and grievance with apparent\r\nsympathy and great patience. He had many of the arts of the courtier\r\nalong with his indomitable will.\r\n\r\nAt another of his gatherings at Norway House with the traders in 1823 we\r\nhave records of the greatest interest. The canoe had been the favourite\r\ncraft of the Nor'-Westers, but he now introduced boats and effected a\r\nsaving of one-third in wages, and he himself superintended the sending\r\nof an expedition of four boats with twenty men by way of Nelson River\r\nfrom York Factory to far distant Athabasca. He was quick to see those\r\nwho were the most profitable as workmen for the Company. On one occasion\r\nhe gives his estimate as follows: \"Canadians (i.e., French Canadians)\r\npreferable to Orkneymen. Orkneymen less expensive, but slow. Less\r\nphysical strength and spirits. Obstinate if brought young into the\r\nservice. Scotch and Irish, when numerous, quarrelsome, independent, and\r\nmutinous.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time it was determined to give up the practice of bestowing\r\npresents upon the Indians. It was found better to pay them liberally for\r\ntheir pelts, making them some advances for clothing.\r\n\r\nThe minutes state at this time that there was little progress in the\r\nmoral and religious instruction of the Indians. The excessive use of\r\nspirits, which still continued, was now checked; the quantity given\r\nin 1822 and 1823 was reduced one-half and the strength of the spirits\r\nlowered. Missionaries could not be employed with success, on account of\r\nthe small number of Indians at any one point. The only hope seemed to\r\nbe to have schools at Red River and to remove the children from their\r\nparents to these. Many difficulties, arising from the objections of the\r\nparents, were, however, sure to come in the way.\r\n\r\nEvidences were not wanting of chief factors being somewhat alienated\r\nfrom the Governor, but those dissatisfied were promptly invited to the\r\nCouncil and their coolness removed. In carrying out discipline among\r\nthe men some difficulty was experienced, as the long conflicts between\r\nthe Companies had greatly demoralized the employés. One plan suggested\r\nwas that offenders should be fined and the fines vested in a charitable\r\nfund. It was found that this would only do for Europeans. \"A blow was\r\nbetter for a Canadian,\" and though this was highly reprobated, it was\r\njustified by experience.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting at York Factory instructions were given to Chief Factor\r\nStuart on Lake Superior to complete and launch a new vessel much larger\r\nthan the _Discovery_, then afloat. Captain Bayfield, R.N., the British\r\nofficer surveying the lakes, wintered at this time with his crew at Fort\r\nWilliam, and the work of surveying the lakes promised to take him three\r\nsummers.\r\n\r\nThe following entry, September 5th, 1823, shows the considerate way in\r\nwhich the Governor sought the advice of his Council:--\"Governor Simpson\r\nrequested permission to visit England. If granted, will hold himself\r\nready to return to Canada in 1825 and proceed by express canoe in time\r\nto make arrangements for the season.\" At the same date, 1823, a step\r\nin advance was taken in having a permanent and representative council\r\nto regulate the affairs of Red River Settlement. The entry reads,\r\n\"Captain Robert Parker Pelly, Governor of Assiniboia, Rev. Mr. West,\r\nRev. Mr. Jones, Mr. Logan added to the council. Jacob Corrigal, chief\r\ntrader, appointed sheriff, vice Andrew Stewart, deceased. Rev. Mr. Jones\r\nappointed chaplain at a salary of 100_l._ during absence of Mr. West. He\r\nwill officiate at Red River.\"\r\n\r\nThere lies before the writer a work entitled \"Peace River; a Canoe\r\nVoyage from the Hudson Bay to the Pacific.\" It was written by Archibald\r\nMacdonald and annotated between forty and fifty years after by Malcolm\r\nMcLeod, of Ottawa. It gives a graphic account of the state maintained\r\nby Governor Simpson and his method of appealing to the imagination of\r\nthe Indians and Company servants alike. The journey was made from ocean\r\nto ocean, the point of departure being York Factory, on Hudson Bay, and\r\nthe destination Fort Vancouver, on the Columbia River. In addition to\r\nMacdonald, Governor Simpson took with him Dr. Hamlyn as medical adviser,\r\nand in two light canoes, provided with nine men each, the party went\r\nwith extraordinary speed along the waterways which had already been the\r\nscenes of many a picturesque and even sanguinary spectacle.\r\n\r\nFourteen chief officers--factors and traders--and as many more clerks\r\nwere summoned on July 12th, 1828, to give a send-off to the important\r\nparty. As the pageant passed up Hayes River, loud cheers were given and\r\na salute of seven guns by the garrison. The voyageurs then struck up one\r\nof the famous chansons by which they beguiled the lonely waterways, and\r\nwith their dashing paddles, hastened away to the interior.\r\n\r\nSo well provided an expedition, with its tents for camping, suitable\r\nutensils for the camp fire, arms to meet any danger, provisions\r\nincluding wine for the gentlemen, and spirits for the voyageurs, was not\r\nlong in ascending the watercourses to Norway House, where the outlet of\r\nLake Winnipeg was reached.\r\n\r\nThe arrival at Norway House was signalized by much pomp. The residents\r\nof the fort were on the qui vive for the important visitor. The\r\nUnion Jack, with its magic letters \"H. B. C.,\" floated from the tall\r\nflag-staff of Norway pine, erected on Signal Hill. Indians from their\r\nneighbouring haunts were present in large numbers, and the lordly Red\r\nmen, at their best when \"en fête,\" were accompanied by bevies of their\r\ndusky mates, who looked with admiring gaze on the \"Kitche Okema\" who was\r\narriving.\r\n\r\nThe party had prepared for the occasion. They had, before reaching\r\nthe fort, landed and put themselves in proper trim and paid as much\r\nattention to their toilets as circumstances would permit. Fully ready,\r\nthey resumed their journey, and with flashing paddles speeded through\r\nthe deep rocky gorge, quickly turned the point, and from the gaudily\r\npainted canoe of the Governor with high prow, where sat the French\r\nCanadian guide, who for the time commanded, there pealed forth the\r\nstrains of the bagpipes, while from the second canoe was heard the sound\r\nof the chief factor's bugle. As the canoes came near the shore, the soft\r\nand lively notes fell on the ear of \"La Claire Fontaine\" from the lively\r\nvoyageurs. Altogether, it was a scene very impressive to the quiet\r\nresidents of the post.\r\n\r\nThe time of the Governor was very fully occupied at each stopping-place.\r\nA personal examination and inspection of each post, of its officers and\r\nemployés, buildings, books, trade, and prospects was made with \"greatest\r\nthoroughness.\" Fond as the Governor was of pomp, when the pageant was\r\npassed, then he was a man of iron will and keenest observation. His\r\ncorrespondence at each resting-place was great, and he was said to be\r\nable to do the work of three men, though twelve years after the date of\r\nthe present journey he became affected with partial blindness.\r\n\r\nFort Chipewyan had always maintained its pre-eminence as an important\r\ndepôt of the fur trade. The travelling emperor of the fur traders\r\nwas captured by its picturesque position as well as by its historic\r\nmemories. Here he found William McGillivray, with whose name the fur\r\ntraders conjured, and under invitation from the Governor the former\r\nNor'-Wester and his family joined the party in crossing the Rockies. The\r\nwaving of flags, firing of guns, shouting of the Indians and employés,\r\nand the sound of singing and bagpipe made the arrival and departure as\r\nnotable as it had been at Norway House.\r\n\r\nA little more than a month after they had left York Factory the\r\nindomitable travellers entered Peace River, in order to cross the Rocky\r\nMountains. Fort Vermilion, Fort Dunvegan, St. John, all had their\r\nobjects of interest for the party, but one of the chief was that it was\r\na scarce year, and at Dunvegan, as well as at Fort McLeod across the\r\nmountains, there was not enough of food at hand to supply the visitors.\r\nCases of dispute were settled by the Governor, who presided with the air\r\nof a chief Justice. Caution and advice were given in the most impressive\r\nfashion, after the manner of a father confessor, to the Indians, fault\r\nbeing found with their revelries and the scenes of violence which\r\nnaturally followed from these.\r\n\r\nFrom McLeod to Fort St. James the journey was made by land. Thus the\r\ncrest of the Rocky Mountains was crossed, the voyageurs packing on their\r\nshoulders the impedimenta, and horses being provided for the gentlemen\r\nof the party. This was the difficult portage which so often tried the\r\ntraders. Fort St. James, it will be remembered, was at Lake Stuart,\r\nwhere Fraser started on his notable journey down the Fraser River. It\r\nwas the chief place and emporium of New Caledonia. The entry is thus\r\ndescribed: \"Unfurling the British ensign, it was given to the guide,\r\nwho marched first. After him came the band, consisting of buglers and\r\nbagpipers. Next came the Governor, mounted, and behind him Hamlyn and\r\nMacdonald also on horses. Twenty men loaded like beasts of burden,\r\nformed the line; after them a loaded horse; and finally, McGillivray\r\nwith his wife and family brought up the rear.\"\r\n\r\nThus arranged, the imposing body was put in motion. Passing over a\r\ngentle elevation, they came in full view of the fort, when the bugle\r\nsounded, a gun was fired, and the bagpipes struck up the famous march of\r\nthe clans, \"Si coma leum codagh na sha\" (\"If you will it, war\"). Trader\r\nDouglas, who was in charge of the fort, replied with small ordnance and\r\nguns, after which he advanced and received the distinguished visitors in\r\nfront of the fort.\r\n\r\nPassing on, by September 24th the party came to Fort Alexandria, four\r\ndays down the Fraser, and reached Kamloops, the junction of the North\r\nand South Thompson. At every point of importance, the Governor took\r\noccasion to assemble the natives and employés, and gave them good\r\nadvice, \"exhorting them to honesty, frugality, temperance,\" finishing\r\nhis prelections with a gift of tobacco or some commodity appreciated\r\nby them. Running rapids, exposed to continual danger, but fortunate in\r\ntheir many escapes, they reached Fort Langley, near the mouth of the\r\nFraser River, two days less than three months from the time of their\r\nstarting from York Factory. From this point, Governor Simpson made\r\nhis way to Fort Vancouver on the Columbia, then the chief post on the\r\nPacific Coast, and in the following year returned over the mountains,\r\nsatisfied that he had gained much knowledge and that he had impressed\r\nhimself on trader, _engagé_, and Indian chief alike.\r\n\r\nWith marvellous energy, the Governor-in-Chief, as he was called, covered\r\nthe vast territory committed to his care. Establishments in unnecessary\r\nand unremunerative places were cut down or closed. Governor Simpson,\r\nwhile in some respects fond of the \"show and circumstance\" which an old\r\nand honourable Company could afford, was nevertheless a keen business\r\nman, and never forgot that he was the head of a Company whose object was\r\ntrade. It cannot be denied that the personal element entered largely\r\ninto his administration. He had his favourites among the traders, he\r\nwas not above petty revenges upon those who thwarted his plans, and his\r\ndecisions were sometimes harsh and tyrannical, but his long experience,\r\nextending over forty years, was marked on the whole by most successful\r\nadministration and by a restoration of the prestige of the Company, so\r\nnearly destroyed at the time of the union.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1839, when the Colonial Office was engaged in settling up\r\nthe Canadian rebellion which a blundering colonial system had brought\r\nupon both Lower and Upper Canada, the British Government sought\r\nto strengthen itself among those who had loyally stood by British\r\ninfluence. Governor Simpson and the whole staff of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany had been intensely loyal, and it was most natural and right that\r\nthe young Queen Victoria, who had lately assumed the reins of power,\r\nshould dispense such a favour as that of knighthood on the doughty\r\nleader of the fur traders. Sir George Simpson worthily bore the honours\r\nbestowed upon him by his Sovereign, and in 1841 undertook a voyage round\r\nthe world, crossing, as he did so, Rupert's Land and the territories\r\nin his rapid march. Two portly volumes containing an itinerary of the\r\nvoyage, filling nine hundred pages, appeared some five years after\r\nthis Journey was completed. This work is given in the first person as\r\na recital by the Governor of what he saw and passed through. Internal\r\nevidence, however, as well as local tradition on the Red River, shows\r\nanother hand to have been concerned in giving it a literary form. It\r\nis reported that the moulding agent in style and arrangement was Judge\r\nThom, the industrious and strong-minded recorder of the Red River\r\nSettlement.\r\n\r\nThe work is dedicated to the directors of the Hudson's Bay Company.\r\nThese were nine in number, and their names are nearly all well known\r\nin connection with the trade of this period. Sir John Henry Pelly,\r\nlong famous for his leadership; Andrew Colville, Deputy-Governor, who,\r\nby family connection with Lord Selkirk, long held an important place;\r\nBenjamin Harrison; John Halkett, another kinsman of Lord Selkirk; H.\r\nH. Berens; A. Chapman, M.P.; Edward Ellice, M.P., a chief agent in the\r\nUnion and a most famous trader; the Earl of Selkirk, the son of the\r\nfounder; and R. Weynton. The names of almost all these traders will be\r\nfound commemorated in forts and trading-posts throughout Rupert's Land.\r\n\r\nLeaving London, March 3rd, 1841, the Governor called at Halifax, but\r\ndisembarked at Boston, went by land to Montreal, and navigation being\r\nopen on May 4th on the St. Lawrence, he and his party started and soon\r\nreached Ste. Anne, on Montreal Island. The evidence of the humour of Sir\r\nGeorge's editor, who knew Montreal well, is seen in his referring to\r\nMoore's \"Canadian Boat Song,\" in saying, \"At Ste. Anne's Rapid, on the\r\nOttawa, we neither sang our evening hymn nor bribed the Lady Patroness\r\nwith shirts, caps, &c., for a propitious journey; but proceeded.\"\r\nFollowing the old canoe route, Georgian Bay and Lake Superior were\r\nsoon passed over, though on the latter lake the expedition was delayed\r\nabout a week by the ice, and here too Sir George met the sad news of\r\nthe unfortunate death of his kinsman, Thomas Simpson, of whom we shall\r\nspeak more fully in connection with Arctic exploration. Taking the\r\nroute from Fort William by Kaministiquia, the travellers hastened over\r\nthe course by way of Rainy Lake and River and Lake of the Woods. In\r\nreferring to Rainy River the somewhat inflated style of the editor makes\r\nSir George speak without the caution which every fur trader was directed\r\nto cultivate in revealing the resources of the fur country. A decade\r\nafterwards Mr. Roebuck, before the Committee of the House of Commons,\r\n\"heckled\" Sir George over this fulsome passage. The passage is: \"From\r\nthe very brink of the river (Rainy River) there rises a gentle slope of\r\ngreenwood, crowned in many places with a plentiful growth of birch,\r\npoplar, beech, elm, and oak. Is it too much for the eye of philanthropy\r\nto discern, through the vista of futurity, this noble stream,\r\nconnecting, as it does, the fertile shores of two spacious lakes, with\r\ncrowded steamboats on its bosom and populous towns on its borders?\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the usual route by River Winnipeg, Lake Winnipeg, and Red\r\nRiver, Fort Garry was soon reached, and here the Governor somewhat\r\nchanged his plans. He determined to cross the prairies by light\r\nconveyances, and accordingly on July 3rd, at five in the morning, with\r\nhis fellow-travellers, with only six men, three horses, and one light\r\ncart, the Emperor of the Plains left Fort Garry under a salute and with\r\nthe shouting of the spectators, as he started on his journey to skirt\r\nthe winding Assiniboine River.\r\n\r\nA thousand miles over the prairie in July is one of the most cheery\r\nand delightsome journeys that can be made. The prairie flowers abound,\r\ntheir colours have not yet taken on the full blaze of yellow to be\r\nseen a month later, and the mosquitoes have largely passed away on the\r\nprairies. The weather, though somewhat warm, is very rarely oppressive\r\non the plains, where a breeze may always be felt. This long journey\r\nthe party made with most reckless speed--doing it in three weeks, and\r\narriving at Edmonton House, to be received by the firing of guns and\r\nthe presence of nine native chiefs of the Blackfeet, Piegans, Sarcees,\r\nand Bloods, dressed in their grandest clothes and decorated with scalp\r\nlocks. \"They implored me,\" says the Governor, \"to grant their horses\r\nmight always be swift, that the buffalo might instantly abound, and that\r\ntheir wives might live long and look young.\"\r\n\r\nFour days sufficed at Edmonton on the North Saskatchewan to provide the\r\ntravellers with forty-five fresh horses. They speedily passed up the\r\nSaskatchewan River, meeting bands of hostile Sarcees, using supplies of\r\npemmican, and soon catching their first view of the white peaks of the\r\nRocky Mountains. Deep muskegs and dense jungles were often encountered,\r\nbut all were overcome by the skill and energy of the expert fur trader\r\nRow and their guide. Through clouds of mosquitoes they advanced until\r\nthe sublime mountain scenery was beheld whenever it was not obscured\r\nwith the smoke arising from the fires through this region, which\r\nwas suffering from a very dry season. At length Fort Colville, on\r\nthe Columbia River, was gained after nearly one thousand miles from\r\nEdmonton; and this journey, much of it mountain travelling, had averaged\r\nforty miles a day. The party from Fort Garry had been travelling\r\nconstantly for six weeks and five days, and they had averaged eleven and\r\na half hours a day in the saddle. The weather had been charming, with\r\na steady cloudless sky, the winds were light, the nights cool, and the\r\nonly thing to be lamented was the appearance of the whole party, who,\r\nwith tattered garments and crownless hats, entered the fort.\r\n\r\nEmbarking below the Chaudière Falls of the Columbia, the company took\r\nboats, worked by six oars each, and the water being high they were able\r\nto make one hundred, and even more miles a day, in due course reaching\r\nFort Vancouver.\r\n\r\nAt Fort Vancouver Governor Simpson met Trader Douglas--afterward Sir\r\nJames Douglas. He accompanied the party, which now took horses and\r\ncrossed country by a four days' journey to Fort Nisqually. Here on the\r\nshore of Puget Sound lay the ship _Beaver_, and embarking on her the\r\nparty went on their journey to Sitka, the chief place in Alaska, whence\r\nthe Governor exchanged dignified courtesies with the Russian Governor\r\nEtholin, and enjoyed the hospitality of his \"pretty and lady-like\" wife.\r\nIn addition, Governor Simpson examined into the Company's operations\r\n(the Hudson's Bay Company had obtained exclusive licence of this sleepy\r\nAlaska for twenty years longer), and found the trade to be 10,000 fur\r\nseals, 1000 sea otters, 12,000 beaver, 2500 land otters,----foxes and\r\nmartins, 20,000 sea-horse teeth.\r\n\r\nThe return journey was made, the _Beaver_ calling, as she came down the\r\ncoast, at Forts Stikine, Simpson, and McLoughlin. In due course Fort\r\nVancouver was reached again. Sir George's journey to San Francisco,\r\nthence to Sandwich Islands, again direct to Alaska, and then westward to\r\nSiberia, and over the long journey through Siberia on to St. Petersburg,\r\nwe have no special need to describe in connection with our subject. The\r\ngreat traveller reached Britain, having journeyed round the globe in\r\nthe manner we have seen, in nineteen months and twenty-six days.\r\n\r\nEnough has been shown of Sir George's career, his administration,\r\nmethod of travel, and management, to bring before us the character of\r\nthe man. At times he was accompanied on his voyages to more accessible\r\npoints by Lady Simpson, and her name is seen in the post of Fort Frances\r\non Rainy River and in Lake Frances on the upper waters of the Liard\r\nRiver, discovered and named by Chief Factor Robert Campbell. Sir George\r\nlived at Lachine, near Montreal, where so many retired Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany men have spent the sunset of their days. He took an interest\r\nin business projects in Montreal, held stock at one time in the Allan\r\nLine of steamships, and was regarded as a leader in business and affairs\r\nin Montreal. He passed away in 1860. Sir E. W. Watkin, in his work,\r\n\"Recollections of Canada and the States,\" gives a letter from Governor\r\nDallas, who succeeded Sir George, in which reference is made to \"the\r\nlate Sir George Simpson, who for a number of years past lived at his\r\nease at Lachine, and attended more apparently to his own affairs than\r\nto those of the Company.\" Whether this is a true statement, or simply\r\nthe biassed view of Dallas, who was rather rash and inconsiderate, it is\r\nhard for us to decide.\r\n\r\nGovernor Simpson lifted the fur trade out of the depth into which it\r\nhad fallen, harmonised the hostile elements of the two Companies,\r\nreduced order out of chaos in the interior, helped, as we shall see,\r\nvarious expeditions for the exploration of Rupert's Land, and though,\r\nas tradition goes and as his journey around the world shows, he never\r\nescaped from the witchery of a pretty face, yet the business concerns\r\nof the Company were certainly such as to gain the approbation of the\r\nfinancial world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF THE TRADERS.\r\n\r\n     Lonely trading posts--Skilful letter writers--Queer old\r\n     Peter Fidler--Famous library--A remarkable will--A stubborn\r\n     Highlander--Life at Red River--Badly-treated Pangman--Founding\r\n     trading houses--Beating up recruits--Priest Provencher--A\r\n     fur-trading mimic--Life far north--\"Ruled with a rod of\r\n     iron\"--Seeking a fur country--Life in the canoe--A trusted\r\n     trader--Sheaves of letters--A find in Edinburgh--Faithful\r\n     correspondents--The Bishop's cask of wine--Red River, a \"land\r\n     of Canaan\"--Governor Simpson's letters--The gigantic Archdeacon\r\n     writes--\"MacArgrave's\" promotion--Kindly Sieveright--Traders and\r\n     their books.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was an empire that Governor Simpson established in the solitudes of\r\nRupert's Land. The chaos which had resulted from the disastrous conflict\r\nof the Companies was by this Napoleon of the fur trade reduced to\r\norder. Men who had been in arms against one another--Macdonell against\r\nMacdonell, McLeod against McLeod--learned to work together and gathered\r\naround the same Council Board. The trade was put upon a paying basis,\r\nthe Indians were encouraged, and under a peaceful rule the better life\r\nof the traders began to grow up.\r\n\r\nIt is true this social life was in many respects unique. The trading\r\nposts were often hundreds of miles apart, being scattered over the area\r\nfrom Labrador to New Caledonia. Still, during the summer, brigades of\r\ntraders carried communications from post to post, and once or twice in\r\nwinter the swift-speeding dog-trains hastened for hundreds of miles with\r\nletters and despatches over the icy wastes. There grew up during the\r\nwell-nigh forty years of George Simpson's governorship a comradeship of\r\na very strong and influential kind.\r\n\r\nLeading posts like York Factory on Hudson Bay, Fort Garry in the Red\r\nRiver settlement, Fort Simpson on the Mackenzie River, and Fort Victoria\r\non the Pacific Coast, were not only business centres, but kept alive\r\na Hudson's Bay Company sentiment which those who have not met it can\r\nhardly understand. Letters were written according to the good old style.\r\nNot mere telegraphic summaries and business orders as at the present\r\nday, but real news-letters--necessary and all the more valuable because\r\nthere were no newspapers in the land. The historian of to-day finds\r\nhimself led back to a very remarkable and interesting social life as he\r\nreads the collection of traders' letters and hears the tales of retired\r\nfactors and officers. Specimens and condensed statements from these\r\nmaterials may help us to picture the life of the period.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEER OLD PETER FIDLER.\r\n\r\nTraditions have come down from this period of men who were far from\r\nbeing commonplace in their lives and habits. Among the most peculiar\r\nand interesting of these was an English trader, Peter Fidler, who for\r\nforty years played his part among the trying events preceding Governor\r\nSimpson's time, and closed his career in the year after the union of\r\nthe Companies. The quaint old trader, Peter Fidler, is said to have\r\nbelonged to the town of Bolsover, in the County of Derby, England, and\r\nwas born August 16th, 1769. From his own statement we know that he kept\r\na diary in the service of the Company beginning in 1791, from which it\r\nis inferred that he arrived in Rupert's Land about that time and was\r\nthen engaged in the fur trade. Eight years afterwards he was at Green\r\nLake, in the Saskatchewan district, and about the same time in Isle\r\nà la Crosse. In this region he came into active competition with the\r\nNorth-West Company traders, and became a most strenuous upholder of the\r\nclaims of the Hudson's Bay Company.\r\n\r\nPromoted on account of his administrative ability, he is found in the\r\nearly years of the new century at Cumberland House, the oldest post of\r\nthe Company in the interior. His length of service at the time of the\r\nestablishment of the Selkirk colony being above twenty years, he was\r\nentrusted with the conduct of one of the parties of settlers from\r\nHudson Bay to Red River.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RED RIVER NOTE.]\r\n\r\nIn his will, a copy of which lies before the writer, it is made quite\r\nevident that Fidler was a man of education, and he left his collection\r\nof five hundred books to be the nucleus of a library which was\r\nafterwards absorbed into the Red River library, and of which volumes are\r\nto be seen in Winnipeg to this day.\r\n\r\nBut Fidler was very much more than a mere fur trader. He is called in\r\nhis will \"Surveyor\" and trader for the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company.\r\nHe was stated to have made the boundary survey of the district of\r\nAssiniboia, the limits of which have been already referred to in the\r\nchapter on Lord Selkirk. He also surveyed the lots for the Selkirk\r\nsettlers, in what was at that time the parish of Kildonan. The plan\r\nof the Selkirk settlement made by him may be found in Amos's Trials\r\nand in the Blue Book of 1819, and this proved to be of great value in\r\nthe troublesome lawsuits arising out of the disputes between the fur\r\ncompanies. The plan itself states that the lots were established in\r\n1814; and we find them to be thirty-six in number.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Fidler was placed in charge of the Red River\r\ndistrict, and it is said that the traders and clerks found him somewhat\r\narbitrary and headstrong. As the troubles were coming on, and Governor\r\nSemple had taken command of the Red River Company's fort and colony,\r\nFidler was placed in charge of Brandon House, then a considerable\r\nHudson's Bay Company Fort. He gives an account of the hostilities\r\nbetween the Companies there and of the seizure of arms. He continues\r\nactively engaged in the Company's service, and from his will being made\r\nat Norway House, this would seem to have been his headquarters, although\r\nin the official statement of the administration of his effects he is\r\nstated to be \"late of York Factory.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Justice Archer Martin, in his useful book, \"Hudson's Bay Company's\r\nLand Tenure,\" gives us an interesting letter of Alexander McLean to\r\nPeter Fidler, dated 1821. This is the time of the Union of the Hudson's\r\nBay Company and the North-West Company. In the letter mention is made\r\nof the departure for New York of (Mr. Nicholas) Garry, a gentleman\r\nof the honourable committee, and of Mr. Simon McGillivray, one of the\r\nNorth-West Company. We have spoken elsewhere of Mr. Garry's visit, and a\r\nfew years afterward Fort Garry was named after this officer.\r\n\r\nThe chief interest to us, however, centres in Fidler's eccentric will.\r\nWe give a synopsis of it:--\r\n\r\n(1) He requests that he may be buried at the colony of Red River should\r\nhe die in that vicinity.\r\n\r\n(2) He directs that his journals, covering twenty-five or thirty\r\nyears, also four or five vellum bound books, being a fair copy of the\r\nnarrative of his journeys, as well as astronomical and meteorological\r\nand thermometrical observations, also his manuscript maps, be given to\r\nthe committee of the Honourable Hudson's Bay Company.\r\n\r\n(3) The books already mentioned making up his library, his printed maps,\r\ntwo sets of twelve-inch globes, a large achromatic telescope, Wilson's\r\nmicroscope, and a brass sextant, a barometer, and all his thermometers\r\nwere to be taken by the Governor of the Red River colony and kept in\r\nGovernment hands for the general good of the Selkirk colonists.\r\n\r\n(4) Cattle, swine, and poultry, which he had purchased for one hundred\r\npounds from John Wills, of the North-West Company, the builder of Fort\r\nGibraltar, were to be left for the sole use of the colony, and if any of\r\nhis children were to ask for a pair of the aforesaid animals or fowls\r\ntheir request was to be granted.\r\n\r\n(5) To his Indian wife, Mary Fidler, he bequeathed fifteen pounds a year\r\nfor life to be paid to her in goods from the Hudson's Bay Company store,\r\nto be charged against his interest account in the hands of the Company.\r\n\r\n(6) The will required further that of all the rest of the money\r\nbelonging to him, in the hands of the Hudson's Bay Company or the Bank\r\nof England, as well as the legacy left him by his Uncle Jasper Fidler\r\nand other moneys due him, the interest be divided among his children\r\naccording to their needs.\r\n\r\n(7) After the interest of Fidler's money had been divided among his\r\nchildren till the youngest child Peter should come of age, the testator\r\nmakes the following remarkable disposal of the residue: \"All my money\r\nin the funds and other personal property after the youngest child has\r\nattained twenty-one years of age, to be placed in the public funds,\r\nand the interest annually due to be added to the capital and continue\r\nso until August 16th, 1969 (I being born on that day two hundred\r\nyears before), when the whole amount of the principal and interest so\r\naccumulated I will and desire to be then placed at the disposal of the\r\nnext male child heir in direct descent from my son Peter Fidler\" or to\r\nthe next-of-kin. He leaves his \"Copyhold land and new house situated in\r\nthe town of Bolsover, in the county of Derby,\" after the death of Mary\r\nFidler, the mother of the testator, to be given to his youngest son,\r\nPeter Fidler.\r\n\r\nThis will was dated on August 16th, 1821, and Fidler died in the\r\nfollowing year. The executors nominated were the Governor of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company, the Governor of the Selkirk settlement, and the\r\nsecretary of the Hudson's Bay Company.\r\n\r\nSome time after the death of this peculiar man, John Henry Pelly,\r\nGovernor-in-Chief of the Hudson's Bay Company, Donald McKenzie, Governor\r\nof the Selkirk settlement, and William Smith, Secretary of the Hudson's\r\nBay Company, renounced the probate and execution of the will, and\r\nin October, 1827, \"Thomas Fidler,\" his natural and lawful son, was\r\nappointed by the court to administer the will.\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of interest in this will has been shown by the\r\ndescendants of Peter Fidler, a number of whom still live in the province\r\nof Manitoba, on the banks of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. Lawyers\r\nhave from time to time been appointed to seek out the residue, which,\r\nunder the will, ought to be in process of accumulation till 1969, but\r\nno trace of it can be found in Hudson's Bay Company or Bank of England\r\naccounts, though diligent search has been made.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUBBORN JOHN MCLEOD.\r\n\r\nJohn McLeod has already figured in our story. Coming out with Lord\r\nSelkirk's first party from the Island of Lewis, as one of the \"twelve\r\nor thirteen young gentleman clerks,\" he, as we have seen, gave a good\r\naccount of himself in the \"imminent and deadly breach,\" when he\r\ndefended the Hudson's Bay Company encampment at the Forks against the\r\nfierce Nor'-Westers. His journal account of that struggle we found to be\r\nwell told, even exciting. It further gives a picture of the fur trader's\r\nlife, as seen with British eyes and by one of Hudson's Bay Company\r\nsympathies.\r\n\r\nHe met at the Forks, immediately on his arrival, three chiefs of the\r\nNor'-Westers. One of these was John Wills, who, as an old X Y trader,\r\nhad joined the Nor'-Westers and shortly after built Fort Gibraltar. A\r\nsecond of the trio was Benjamin Frobisher, of the celebrated Montreal\r\nfirm of that name, who perished miserably; and the last was Alexander\r\nMacdonell, who was commonly known as \"Yellow Head,\" and afterward became\r\nthe \"Grasshopper Governor.\"\r\n\r\nMcLeod vividly describes the scene on his arrival, when the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany, as represented by trader William Hillier, formally transferred\r\nto Miles Macdonell, Lord Selkirk's agent, the grant of land and the\r\nprivileges pertaining thereto. The ceremony was performed in the\r\npresence of the settlers and other spectators. McLeod quaintly relates\r\nthat the three bourgeois mentioned were present on his invitation,\r\nbut Wills would not allow his men to witness the transaction, which\r\nconsisted of reading over the concession and handing it to Macdonell.\r\nHugh Henney, the local officer in charge of the Hudson's Bay Company\r\naffairs, then read over the concession in French for the benefit of the\r\nvoyageurs and free traders.\r\n\r\nMcLeod relates a misadventure of irascible Peter Fidler in dealing\r\nwith a trader, Pangman, who afterwards figured in Red River affairs.\r\nAfter Henney had taken part in the formal cession, he departed, leaving\r\nMcLeod and Pangman in charge of the Hudson's Bay Company interests at\r\nthe Forks. McLeod states that prior to this time (1813), the Hudson's\r\nBay Company \"_had no house at this place_,\" thus disposing of a local\r\ntradition that there was a Hudson Bay trading post at the Forks before\r\nLord Selkirk's time. McLeod, however, proceeded immediately to build \"a\r\ngood snug house.\" This was ready before the return of the fall craft\r\n(trade), and it was this house that McLeod so valiantly defended in the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer McLeod found Pangman very useful in meeting the\r\nopposition of the North-West Company traders. Peter Pangman was a German\r\nwho had come from the United States, and was hence called \"Bostonnais\r\nPangman,\" the title Bostonnais being used in the fur-trading country for\r\nan American. Fidler, who had charge of the district for the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany, refused to give the equipment promised by Henney to Pangman.\r\nMcLeod speaks of the supreme blunder of thus losing, for the sake of a\r\nfew pounds, the service of so capable a man as Pangman. Pangman left\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company service, joined the Nor'-Westers, and was ever\r\nafter one of the most bitter opponents of the older Company. After many\r\na hostile blow dealt to his opponents, Pangman retired to Canada, where\r\nhe bought the Seigniory of Lachenaie, and his son was an influential\r\npublic man in Lower Canada, Hon. John Pangman.\r\n\r\nEvents of interest rapidly followed one another at the time of the\r\ntroubles. After the fierce onset at the Forks had been met by McLeod,\r\nhe was honoured by being sent 500 miles south-westward by his senior\r\nofficer, Colin Robertson, with horses, carts, and goods, to trade\r\nwith the Indians on the plains. This daring journey he accomplished\r\nwith only three men--\"an Orkneyman and two Irishmen.\" In early winter\r\nhe had returned to Pembina, where he was to meet the newly-appointed\r\nGovernor, Robert Semple. McLeod states that Semple was appointed under\r\nthe resolution of the Board of Directors in London on May 19th, 1811,\r\nfirst Governor of Assiniboia. From this we are led to think that Miles\r\nMacdonell was Lord Selkirk's agent only, and was Governor by courtesy,\r\nthough this was not the case.\r\n\r\nThe unsettled state of the country along the boundary line is shown in a\r\nfrightful massacre spoken of by McLeod. On a journey down the Red River,\r\nMcLeod had spent a night near Christmas time in a camp of the Saulteaux\r\nIndians. He had taken part in their festivities and passed the night in\r\ntheir tents. He was horrified to hear a few days after at Pembina that\r\na band of Sioux had, on the night of the feast, fallen upon the camp\r\nof Saulteaux, which was composed of thirty-six warriors, and that all\r\nbut three of those making up the camp had been brutally killed in a\r\nnight attack. On his return to his post McLeod passed the scene of the\r\nterrible massacre, and he says he saw \"the thirty-three slain bodies\r\nscalped, the knives and arrows and all that had touched their flesh\r\nbeing left there.\"\r\n\r\nMcLeod was noted for his energy in building posts. He erected an\r\nestablishment on Turtle River; and in the year after built a trading\r\nhouse beyond Lake Winnipeg, at the place where Oxford House afterward\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nMcLeod, being possessed of courage and energy, was sent west to\r\nSaskatchewan, where, having wintered in the district with traders Bird\r\nand Pruden, and faced many dangers and hardships, he returned to Red\r\nRiver and was among those arrested by the Nor'-Westers. He was sent to\r\nMontreal, where, after some delay, the charge against him was summarily\r\ndismissed. He was, while there, summoned as a witness in the case\r\nagainst Reinhart in Quebec.\r\n\r\nIn Montreal McLeod was rejoiced to meet Lady Selkirk, the wife of his\r\npatron, from whom he received tokens of confidence and respect.\r\n\r\nThe trader had a hand in the important movement by which Lord Selkirk\r\nprovided for his French and German dependents on the Red River, who\r\nbelonged to the Roman Catholic faith, the ordinances of religion. As\r\nwe shall see, Lord Selkirk secured, according to his promise, the two\r\npriests Provencher and Dumoulin, and with them sent out a considerable\r\nnumber of French Canadians to Red River.\r\n\r\nMcLeod's account of his part in the matter is as follows:--\"On my way\r\nbetween Montreal and Quebec, I took occasion, with the help of the good\r\nRoman Catholic priests, Dumoulin of Three Rivers, and Provencher of\r\nMontreal, to beat up recruits for the Hudson's Bay Company service and\r\nthe colony among the French Canadians. On the opening of navigation\r\nabout May 1st, I started, in charge with a brigade of seven large\r\ncanoes, and with about forty Canadians, some with their families, headed\r\nby my two good friends the priests--the first missionaries in the north\r\nsince the time of the French before the conquest. Without any loss or\r\ndifficulty, I conducted the whole through to Norway House, whence in\r\ndue course they were taken in boats and schooner to Red River. At\r\nthis place we had a navy on the lake, but lately under the command\r\nof Lieutenant Holt, one of the victims of 1816. Holt had been of the\r\nSwedish navy.\"\r\n\r\nAt Norway House McLeod's well-known ability and trustworthiness led\r\nto his appointment to the far West, \"and from this time forth his\r\nfield was northward to the Arctic.\" He had the distinguished honour of\r\nestablishing a permanent highway, by a line of suitable forts and trade\r\nestablishments to the Peace River region. While in charge of his post he\r\nhad the pleasure of entertaining Franklin (the noble Sir John) on his\r\nfirst Arctic land expedition, and afterwards at Norway House saw the\r\nsame distinguished traveller on his second journey to the interior of\r\nthe North land.\r\n\r\nAfter the union of the Companies, McLeod, now raised to the position of\r\nChief Trader, was the first officer of the old Hudson's Bay Company to\r\nbe sent across the Rocky Mountains to take charge of the district in\r\nNew Caledonia. Among the restless and vindictive natives of that region\r\nhe continued for many years with a good measure of success, and ended\r\nup a career of thirty-seven years as a successful trader and thorough\r\ndefender of the name and fame of the Hudson's Bay Company, by retiring\r\nto spend the remainder of his days, as so many of the traders did, upon\r\nthe Ottawa River.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLARD FERDINAND WENTZEL'S DISLIKES AND THE NEW RÉGIME.\r\n\r\nWentzel was a Norwegian who had entered the North-West Company in\r\n1799, and spent most of his time in Athabasca and Mackenzie River\r\ndistricts, where he passed the hard life of a \"winterer\" in the northern\r\ndepartment. He was intelligent, but a mimic--and this troublesome\r\ncleverness prevented his promotion in the Company. He co-operated with\r\nFranklin the explorer in his journey to the Arctic Ocean. Wentzel was\r\na musician--according to Franklin \"an excellent musician.\" This talent\r\nof his brightened the long and dreary hours of life and contributed to\r\nkeep all cheerful around him. A collection of the voyageur songs made\r\nby him is in existence, but they are somewhat gross. Wentzel married\r\na Montagnais Indian woman, by whom he had two children. One of them\r\nlived on the Red River and built the St. Norbert Roman Catholic Church\r\nin 1855. From Wentzel's letters we quote extracts showing the state of\r\nfeeling at the time of the union of the fur companies in 1821 and for a\r\nfew years afterwards.\r\n\r\n_March 26th, 1821._--\"In Athabasca, affairs seem to revive; the natives\r\nare beginning to be subjected by the rivalship in trade that has been\r\ncarried on so long, and are heartily desirous of seeing themselves once\r\nmore in peaceable times, which makes the proverb true that says, 'Too\r\nmuch of a good thing is good for nothing.' Besides, the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany have apparently realized the extravagance of their measures;\r\nlast autumn they came into the department with fifteen canoes only,\r\ncontaining each about fifteen pieces. Mr. Simpson (afterward Sir\r\nGeorge), a gentleman from England last spring, superintends their\r\nbusiness. His being a stranger, and reputedly a gentlemanly man, will\r\nnot create much alarm, nor do I presume him formidable as an Indian\r\ntrader. Indeed, Mr. Leith, who manages the concerns of the North-West\r\nCompany in Athabasca, has been so liberally supplied with men and goods\r\nthat it will be almost wonderful if the opposition can make good a\r\nsubsistence during the winter. Fort Chipewyan alone has an equipment\r\nof no less than seventy men, enough to crush their rivals.\" (Editor's\r\nnote.--Another year saw Simpson Governor of the United Company.)\r\n\r\n_April 10th, 1823._--\"Necessity rather than persuasion, however,\r\ninfluenced me to remain; my means for future support are too slender\r\nfor me to give up my employment, but the late revolution in the affairs\r\nof the country (the coalition of the Hudson's Bay Company with the\r\nNorth-West Company in 1821) now obliges me to leave it the ensuing year,\r\nas the advantages and prospects are too discouraging to hold forth a\r\nprobability of clearing one penny for future support. Salaries do not\r\nexceed one hundred pounds sterling, out of which clerks must purchase\r\nevery necessity, even tobacco, and the prices of goods at the Bay are at\r\nthe rate of one hundred and fifty or three hundred per cent. on prime\r\ncost, therefore I shall take this opportunity of humbly requesting your\r\nadvice how to settle my little earnings, which do not much exceed five\r\nhundred pounds, to the best advantage.\"\r\n\r\n_March 1st, 1824._--\"Respecting the concerns of the North-West\r\n(country), little occurs that can be interesting to Canada. Furs have\r\nlost a great deal of their former value in Europe, and many of the chief\r\nfactors and traders would willingly compound for their shares with the\r\nCompany for one thousand five hundred pounds, in order to retire from a\r\ncountry which has become disgusting and irksome to all classes. Still,\r\nthe returns are not altogether unprofitable; but debts, disappointments,\r\nand age seem to oppress everyone alike. _Engagés'_ prices are now\r\nreduced to twenty-five pounds annually to a boute (foreman), and twenty\r\npounds to middlemen, without equipment or any perquisites whatever.\r\nIn fact, no class enjoys the gratuity of an equipment. Besides, the\r\ncommittee at home insist upon being paid for families residing in posts\r\nand belonging to partners, clerks, or men, at the rate of two shillings\r\nfor every woman and child over fourteen years of age, one shilling for\r\nevery child under that age. This is complained of as a grievance by all\r\nparties, and must eventually become very hard on some who have large\r\nfamilies to support. In short, the North-West is now beginning to be\r\nruled with a rod of iron.\" (Evidently Wentzel is not an admirer of the\r\nnew régime.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFINLAY'S SEARCH FOR FUR.\r\n\r\nThe name of Finlay was a famous one among the traders. As we have seen,\r\nJames Finlay was one of the first to leave Montreal, and penetrate\r\namong the tribes of Indians, in search of fur, to the far distant\r\nSaskatchewan. His son James was a trader, and served in the firm of\r\nGregory, McLeod & Co. As was not uncommon, these traders had children by\r\nthe Indian women, having a \"country marriage,\" as it was called. As the\r\nresult of these there was connected with the Finlay family a half-breed\r\nnamed Jaceo, or Jacko Finlay, who took his part in exploration in the\r\nRocky Mountains in company with David Thompson. Besides these, there was\r\na well-known trader, John Finlay, who is often difficult to separate\r\nfrom the other traders of the name.\r\n\r\nThe writer has lying before him a manuscript, never hitherto published,\r\nentitled \"A Voyage of Discovery from the Rocky Mountain Portage in Peace\r\nRiver, to the Sources of Finlay's Branch, and North-Westward: Summer,\r\n1824.\" This is certified by Chief Factor McDougall, to-day of Prince\r\nAlbert, to be the journal of John Finlay. As it illustrates the methods\r\nby which the fur country was opened, we give a few extracts.\r\n\r\n_May 13th._--\"Rainy weather. In the evening, left Rocky Mountain\r\nPortage establishment. Crossed over to the portage and encamped for the\r\nnight.... The expedition people are as follows: six effective canoe\r\nmen, Joseph Le Guard, Antoine Perreault (bowman), Joseph Cunnayer, J.\r\nB. Tourangeau, J. M. Bouche, and Louis Olsen (middleman), M. McDonald,\r\nManson, and myself, besides Le Prise, and wife, in all ten persons. Le\r\nPrise is in the double capacity of hunter and interpreter.\"\r\n\r\nFinlay speaks of \"The existing troubles in this quarter caused by\r\nthe murderers of our people at St. John's, roving about free and, it\r\nis said, menacing all; but as this is an exploratory voyage, and the\r\nprincipal motive to ascertain the existence of beaver in the country we\r\nare bound for, we shall do our best to accomplish the intentions of the\r\nvoyage.\"\r\n\r\n_17th._--\"Encamped at the hill at the little lake on the top of the\r\nhills at the west side of the Portage. Mr. M. shot a large fowl of the\r\ngrouse kind, larger than the black heath cock in Scotland. Found some\r\ndried salmon in exchange with Mr. Stunt for pemmican--a meal for his\r\nmen, and this year he seems independent of the Peace River, at least as\r\nfar as Dunvegan: they have nothing in provisions at the Portage.\"\r\n\r\nFinlay is very much in the habit of describing the rock formations seen\r\non his voyage. His descriptions are not very valuable, for he says,\r\n\"I am not qualified to give a scientific description of the different\r\nspecies and genera of the different substances composing the strata of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains.\"\r\n\r\n_22nd May._--\"In this valley, about four miles before us right south,\r\nFinlay's branch comes in on the right: a mile and a half below Finlay's\r\nbranch made a portage of five hundred paces. At a rapid here we found\r\nthe Canny _cache_ (a hiding place for valuables); said to be some beaver\r\nin it of last year's hunt.\"\r\n\r\n_23rd._--\"Met a band of Indians, who told us they were going up the\r\nsmall river--(evidently this had been named after the elder Finlay, as\r\nthis instances its familiarity)--on the left, to pass the summer, and a\r\nlittle before another river on the right; that there were some beavers\r\nin it, but not so many as the one they were to pass the summer in.\"\r\n\r\n_24th._--\"To-day some tracks of the reindeer, mountain sheep and goats,\r\nbut the old slave (hunter) has killed nothing but a fowl or beaver now\r\nand then.\"\r\n\r\n_25th._--\"I have never seen in any part of the country such luxuriance\r\nof wood as hereabout, the valley to near the tops of the mountains on\r\nboth sides covered with thick, strong, dark-green branching pines. We\r\nsee a good many beaver and some fowl, game (bustards), and duck, but\r\nkill few.\"\r\n\r\nFinlay declares to the slave, the hunter of his party, his intention to\r\ngo up the large branch of the Finlay. \"This is a disappointment to him\r\nas well as to the people, who have indulged their imaginations on this\r\nroute falling on the Liard River, teeming in beaver and large animals.\"\r\n\r\n_7th June._--\"This afternoon we have seen a great deal of beaver work,\r\nand killed some bustards and Canadian grey geese; we have seen no swans,\r\nand the ducks, with few exceptions, are shabby.\"\r\n\r\nFinlay gives a statement of his journey made so far, thus:--\r\n\r\n  Rocky Mountain Portage to entrance of Finlay's Branch          6 days.\r\n  To Deserter's Portage                                          4  ,,\r\n  To Large Branch                                                5  ,,\r\n  To Point Du Mouton                                             4  ,,\r\n  To end of Portage                                              4  ,,\r\n  To Fishing Lakes                                               3  ,,\r\n                                                                --\r\n                                                                26 days.\r\n                                                                --\r\n\r\n\r\nFINLAY GIVES HIS VIEWS AS TO A \"BEAVER COUNTRY.\"\r\n\r\n\"In some of the large rivers coming into Finlay's branch, where soft\r\nground with wood, eligible for beaver, had been accumulated, beaver were\r\nto be found. Otherwise, except such places as here and here, the whole\r\ncountry is one continued mountain valley of rock and stone, and can by\r\nno means come under the denomination of a beaver country, in the common\r\nacceptation of the word, on the waters of the Hudson's Bay and Mackenzie\r\nRiver.\"\r\n\r\n_June 15th._--\"Very fine warm weather; huge masses of snow falling\r\ndown from the mountains with a noise resembling thunder. Those snow\r\n_déboules_ seem irresistible, shivering the trees to atoms, carrying\r\nall clean before them, forming ruins as if the Tower of Babel or the\r\nPyramids of Egypt had been thrown down from their foundations.\"\r\n\r\n_June 29th._--\"Made a good fishery to-day: 7 trout, 12 carp, 1 small\r\nwhite fish, like those at McLeod's lake in Western Caledonia.\"\r\n\r\nFinlay closes his Journal of seventy-five closely-written quarto pages\r\nat the lake high in the mountains, where he saw a river rising. This\r\nlake we see from the map to be the source of the Liard River.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRUSTED TRADER AND HIS FRIENDS.\r\n\r\nNot very long ago it was the good fortune of the writer to be in\r\nEdinburgh. He was talking to his friend, a well-known Writer to the\r\nSignet. The conversation turned on the old fur-trading days, and in a\r\nshort time author and lawyer found themselves four stories high, in a\r\ngarret, examining boxes, packages, and effects of James Hargrave and his\r\nson Joseph, who as fur traders, father and son, had occupied posts in\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company service extending from 1820 to 1892.\r\n\r\nSeveral cases were filled with copies of a book entitled \"Red River,\"\r\npublished by the younger Hargrave in 1871. Other boxes enclosed the\r\nlibrary of father and son. Two canvas bags contained many pounds of new\r\nfarthings, which, by some strange mischance, had found their way to the\r\nHudson Bay and had been returned as useless. Miscellaneous articles of\r\nno value to the searchers lay about, but in one large valise were many\r\nbundles of letters. These were done up in the most careful manner. The\r\npackages were carefully tied with red tape, and each, securely sealed\r\nwith three black ominous seals, emphasized the effect of the directions\r\nwritten on them, in some cases \"to be opened only by my son,\" in others,\r\n\"to be opened only by my children.\" After some delay the permission of\r\nthe heirs was obtained, and the packages were opened and examined.\r\n\r\nThey were all letters written between 1821 and 1859 by fur-trading\r\nfriends to James Hargrave, who had carefully preserved them, folded,\r\ndocketed, and arranged them, and who had, in the last years of his\r\nlife at \"Burnside House,\" his residence at Brockville, Canada, kept\r\nthe large correspondence as the \"apple of his eye.\" The vast majority\r\nof the letters, numbering many hundreds in all, had been addressed to\r\nYork Factory. For most of his life Hargrave had been in charge of York\r\nFactory, on Hudson Bay. York Factory was during the greater part of\r\nthis fur trader's life, as it had been for more than a century before\r\nhis time, the port of entry to which goods brought by ship from Britain\r\nhad been borne to the interior of Rupert's Land, and also the port\r\nfrom which the ships had carried their precious cargoes of furs to the\r\nmother country. James Hargrave had thus become the trusted correspondent\r\nof governor and merchant, of bishop and clergyman, of medical man and\r\neducationist. He was emphatically a middleman, a sort of Janus, looking\r\nwith one face to the London merchants and with the other to the dwellers\r\nin Rupert's Land.\r\n\r\nBut Hargrave was also a letter-writer, and a receiver of many news\r\nletters and friendly letters, a man who enjoyed conversation, and when\r\nthis could not be had with his friends _tête-à-tête_, his social chats\r\nwere carried on by means of letters, many months and even years apart.\r\nBy degrees he rose in the service. From the first a friend of the\r\nemperor-governor, he has the good wishes of his friends expressed for\r\nhis first rise to the post of chief trader, which he gained in 1833, and\r\nby-and-by came his next well-deserved promotion to be chief factor in\r\n1844.\r\n\r\nAlong with all these letters was a book handsomely bound for keeping\r\naccounts and private memoranda. This book shows James Hargrave to have\r\nbeen a most methodical and painstaking man. In it is contained a list\r\nof all the promotions to official positions of commissioned officers\r\nfor nearly forty years, from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Here also is\r\nan account of his investments, and the satisfactory statement that,\r\nduring his nearly forty years of service, his shares of the profits,\r\ninvestments, and re-investments of what he did not use, allowed him to\r\nretire from active service with, as the result of his labour, about\r\n8,700_l._\r\n\r\nThe writer has sought to glean from the hundreds of letters in the\r\nEdinburgh garret what is interesting in the life of Rupert's Land, so\r\nfar as is shown in the writing and acting of this old fur trader and his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nMany of the letters are from Governor Simpson. These letters of the\r\nGovernor are chiefly written from Red River or Norway House--the\r\nformer the \"Fur Traders' Paradise,\" the latter the meeting-place of\r\nthe Council, held once a year to decide all matters of business.\r\nOccasionally a letter of the Governor's is from Bas de la Rivière (i.e.\r\nthe mouth of the Winnipeg River), written by that energetic officer, as\r\nmight be said, \"on the wing,\" and in a few cases from London, England,\r\nwhither frequently Governor Simpson crossed on the business of the\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nGovernor Simpson's remarks as to society in Red River, 1831, are keen\r\nand amusing:--\"As yet we have had one fête, which was honoured by the\r\npresence of all the elegance and dignity of the place from his Reverence\r\nof Juliopolis (Bishop Provencher) down to friend Cook, who (the latter)\r\nwas as grave and sober as a bishop.... By-the-bye, we have got a very\r\n'rum' fellow of a doctor here now: the strangest compound of skill,\r\nsimplicity, selfishness, extravagance, musical taste, and want of\r\ncourtesy, I ever fell in with. The people are living on the fat of the\r\nearth, in short, Red River is a perfect land of Canaan as far as good\r\ncheer goes.... Do me the favour to pick out a couple pounds of choice\r\nsnuff for me and send them by Mr. Miles.\"\r\n\r\nA short time after this, Governor Simpson, writing, says, speaking of\r\nthe completion of St. John's Church, afterward the Cathedral Church,\r\nand referring to the discontent of the Selkirk settlers, with which he\r\nhad small sympathy, \"We have got into the new church, which is really a\r\nsplendid edifice for Red River, and the people are less clamorous about\r\na Gaelic minister than they were.\" The good Governor had his pleasant\r\nfling at the claim made by the Highlanders to have their private stills\r\nwhen he says, \"And about whiskey they say not one word, now that rum\r\nis so cheap, and good strong 'heavy wet' in general use.\" Speaking of\r\none of the chief officers who was off duty, the Governor says \"Chief\r\nFactor Charles is like a fish out of water, having no musquash to count,\r\nnor Chipewyans to trade with; he is as brisk and active as a boy, and\r\ninstead of showing any disposition to retire, wishes to volunteer to\r\nput a finishing hand to the as yet fruitless attempt at discovering the\r\nNorth-West passage.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Simpson knows well the art of flattery, and his skill in\r\nmanaging his large force of Company officers and men is well seen. He\r\nstates to Hargrave that he once predicted at the board that the traders\r\nof York Factory would yet have a seat at the Board. This, he stated,\r\ngave mortal offence to some members, but he was to bear the prediction\r\nin mind. He compliments him on sending the best-written letter that he\r\nhas received for a long time, and we find that in the following year\r\nHargrave was made Chief Trader. This was the occasion for numerous\r\ncongratulations from his friends Archdeacon Cochrane of Red River,\r\nTrader Sieveright, and others.\r\n\r\nThe news of the time was common subject of discussion between the\r\ntraders in their letters. Governor Simpson gave an account of the\r\noutbreak of cholera in the eastern states and provinces, and traces\r\nin a very graphic way its dangerous approach towards Rupert's Land.\r\nUp to August, 1832, fifteen hundred people had died in Montreal. The\r\npestilence had reached Mackinaw, and two hundred of the steamboat\r\npassengers were carried off, and some near Sault Ste. Marie. \"God\r\ngrant,\" says the Governor, \"it may not penetrate further into our wilds,\r\nbut the chances are decidedly against us.\"\r\n\r\nThat the Hudson's Bay Company officers were not traders only is made\r\nabundantly evident. In one of his letters, Governor Simpson states that\r\ntheir countryman, Sir Walter Scott, has just passed away, he thanks\r\nHargrave for sending him copies of _Blackwood's Magazine_, and orders\r\nare often given for fresh and timely books. A little earlier we find\r\nthe minute interest which the fur traders took in public events in\r\na letter from Chief Factor John Stuart, after whom Stuart's Lake, in\r\nNew Caledonia, was named. He speaks to Hargrave of the continuation of\r\nSouthey's \"History of the War of the Peninsula\" not being published,\r\nand we know from other sources that this History fell still-born, but\r\nStuart goes on to say that he had sent for Col. Napier's \"History of\r\nthe Peninsular War.\" \"Napier's politics,\" says Stuart, \"are different,\r\nand we shall see whether it is the radical or a laurel (Southey was\r\npoet laureate) that deserves the palm.\" These examples but illustrate\r\nwhat all close observers notice, that the officers of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany not only read to purpose, but maintained a keen outlook for the\r\nbest and most finished contemporary literature. Much additional evidence\r\nmight be supplied on this point.\r\n\r\nAll through Governor Simpson's letters there is a strain of sympathy\r\nfor the people of the Company that is very beautiful. These show that\r\ninstead of being a hard and tyrannical man, the Governor had a tender\r\nheart. In one of his letters he expresses sympathy for Trader Heron, who\r\nhad met misfortune. He speaks of his great anxiety for a serious trouble\r\nthat had arisen in Rev. Mr. Jones's school at Red River, and hopes that\r\nit may not injure education; he laments at considerable length over Mr.\r\nJ. S. McTavish's unfortunate accident. Having heard of Hargrave's long\r\nillness he sends a letter of warm sympathy, and this in the midst of a\r\nflying visit, and in London in the following year pays every attention\r\nby giving kind, hospitable invitations to Hargrave to enjoy the society\r\nof himself and Lady Simpson.\r\n\r\nThe racy letters of Governor Simpson are by no means more interesting\r\nthan those of many others of Hargrave's friends. Ordinary business\r\nletters sometimes seem to have a humorous turn about them even fifty\r\nyears after they were written. The Roman Catholic Bishop Provencher\r\n(Bishop of Juliopolis _in partibus infidelium_) affords an example\r\nof this. He writes in great distress to Hargrave as to the loss of\r\na cask of white wine (_une barrique de vin blanc_). He had expected\r\nit by the York boats sent down by the great Red River merchant,\r\nAndrew McDermott.... The cask had not arrived. The good Bishop cannot\r\nunderstand it, but presumes, as it is December when he writes, that it\r\nwill come in the spring. The Bishop's last remark is open to a double\r\nmeaning, when he says, \"Leave it as it is, for he will take it without\r\nputting it in barrels.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bishop in a more important matter addresses Governor Simpson,\r\nand the Governor forwards his letter to York Factory. In this Bishop\r\nProvencher thanks him for giving a voyage in the canoes, from Red River\r\nto Montreal, to Priest Harper, and for bringing up Sub-Deacon Poiré,\r\na \"young man of talent.\" He also gives hearty thanks for a passage,\r\ngranted by the Governor on the fur traders' route from the St. Lawrence,\r\nto two stonemasons. \"I commence,\" he said, \"to dig the foundation of my\r\nchurch to-morrow.\" He asks for a passage down and up for members of his\r\necclesiastical staff. He wants from York Factory forty or fifty hoes for\r\nMr. Belcour to use in teaching the Indians to cultivate potatoes and\r\nIndian corn, and he naïvely remarks, \"while thus engaged, he will at\r\nthe same time cultivate their spirits and their hearts by the preaching\r\nof the Word of God.\" The eye for business is seen in the Bishop's final\r\nremark that he thinks \"that the shoes from the Bay will cost much less\r\nthan those made by the smiths at Red River.\"\r\n\r\nArchdeacon Cochrane, a man of gigantic form and of amazing _bonhomie_,\r\nwho has been called the \"founder of the Church of England on Red River,\"\r\nwrites several interesting letters. Beginning with business he drifts\r\ninto a friendly talk. One of his letters deals with the supplies for the\r\nschool he had opened (1831) at St. Andrew's, Red River, another sings\r\nthe praises of his new church at the rapids: \"It is an elegant little\r\nchurch, pewed for three hundred and forty people, and finished in the\r\nneatest manner it could be for Red River. The ceiling is an arc of an\r\nellipse, painted light blue. The moulding and pulpit brown; the jambs\r\nand sashes of the windows white.\"\r\n\r\nA little of the inner working of the fur-trading system in the\r\npredominance of Scottish influence is exhibited by Archdeacon Cochrane\r\nin one letter to Hargrave. Referring to Hargrave's promotion to the\r\nchief tradership, not yet bestowed, the old clergyman quaintly says,\r\n\"Are you likely to get another feather in your cap? I begin to think\r\nthat your name will have to be changed into MacArgrave. A 'mac' before\r\nyour name would produce a greater effect than all the rest of your\r\nmerits put together. Can't you demonstrate that you are one of the\r\ndescendants of one of the great clans?\"\r\n\r\nAmong the correspondence is a neat little note to Hargrave (1826) from\r\nRev. David Jones, the Archdeacon's predecessor, written at Red River,\r\nasking his company to a family dinner on the next Monday, at 2 p.m.; and\r\na delicate missive from Acting-Governor Bulger, of Red River, asking\r\nHargrave to accept a small quantity of snuff.\r\n\r\nAmong Hargrave's correspondents are such notable fur traders as Cuthbert\r\nGrant, the leader of the Bois Brûlés, who had settled down on White\r\nHorse Plains, on the Assiniboine River, and was the famous captain of\r\nthe buffalo hunters; and William Conolly, the daring Chief Factor of New\r\nCaledonia. Events in Fort Churchill are well described in the extensive\r\ncorrespondence of J. G. McTavish, long stationed there; and good\r\nGovernors Finlayson and McMillan of Red River are well represented; as\r\nwell as Alexander Ross, the historian of the Red River affairs. A full\r\naccount of the wanderings from York Factory to the far distant Pacific\r\nslope of Mr. George Barnston, who afterwards was well known in business\r\ncircles as a resident of Montreal, could be gathered, did time permit,\r\nfrom a most regular correspondence with Hargrave.\r\n\r\nProbably the man most after the York Chief Factor's own heart was a\r\ngood letter writer, John Sieveright, who early became Chief Trader and\r\nafterwards Chief Factor in 1846. Sieveright had become acquainted with\r\nHargrave at Sault Ste. Marie. Afterwards he was removed to Fort Coulonge\r\non the Upper Ottawa, but he still kept up his interest in Hargrave\r\nand the affairs of Rupert's Land. Sieveright has a play of humour and\r\npleasant banter that was very agreeable to Hargrave. He rallies him\r\nabout an old acquaintance, the handsome daughter of Fur Trader Johnston,\r\nof Sault Ste. Marie, who, it will be remembered, married an Indian\r\nprincess. He has a great faculty of using what other correspondents\r\nwrite to him, in making up very readable and well written letters to his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nFor many years Sieveright was at Fort Coulonge, and thus was in touch\r\nwith the Hudson's Bay Company house at Lachine, the centre of the fur\r\ntrade on this continent. Every year he paid a visit to headquarters,\r\nand had an advantage over the distant traders on the Saskatchewan,\r\nMackenzie, and Nelson Rivers. He, however, seemed always to envy them\r\ntheir lot. Writing of Fort Coulonge, he gives us a picture of the fur\r\ntrader's life: \"This place has the advantage of being so near the\r\ncivilized world as to allow us to hear now and then what is going on\r\nin it; but no society or amusement to help pass the time away. In\r\nconsequence I cannot help reading a great deal too much--injurious at\r\nany time of life--particularly so when on the wrong side of fifty.\r\nI have been lately reading John Galt's 'Southernan,' not much to be\r\nadmired. His characters are mostly all caricatures. If place will be\r\nallowed in paper trunk, I shall put that work and 'Laurie Todd' in for\r\nyour acceptance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nTHE VOYAGEURS FROM MONTREAL.\r\n\r\n     Lachine, the fur traders' Mecca--The departure--The flowing\r\n     bowl--The canoe brigade--The voyageur's song--\"En roulant ma\r\n     boule\"--Village of St. Anne's--Legend of the Church--The sailor's\r\n     guardian--Origin of \"Canadian Boat Song\"--A loud invocation--\"A\r\n     la Claire Fontaine\"--\"Sing, nightingale\"--At the rapids--The\r\n     ominous crosses--\"Lament of Cadieux\"--A lonely maiden sits--The\r\n     Wendigo--Home of the Ermatingers--A very old canal--The rugged\r\n     coast--Fort William reached--A famous gathering--The joyous return.\r\n\r\n\r\nMontreal, to-day the chief city of Canada, was, after the union of\r\nthe Companies, the centre of the fur trade in the New World. The old\r\nNor'-Wester influence centred on the St. Lawrence, and while the final\r\ncourt of appeal met in London, the forces that gave energy and effect\r\nto the decrees of the London Board acted from Montreal. At Lachine,\r\nabove the rapids, nine miles from the city, lived Governor Simpson, and\r\nmany retired traders looked upon Lachine as the Mecca of the fur trade.\r\nEven before the days of the Lachine Canal, which was built to avoid the\r\nrapids, it is said the pushing traders had taken advantage of the little\r\nRiver St. Pierre, which falls into the St. Lawrence, and had made a deep\r\ncutting from it up which they dragged their boats to Lachine. To the\r\nhardy French voyageurs, accustomed to \"portage\" their cargoes up steep\r\ncliffs, it was no hardship to use the improvised canal and reach Lachine\r\nat the head of the rapids.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I.--PORTAGE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: II.--DÉCHARGE.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Lachine became the port of departure for the voyageurs on\r\ntheir long journeys up the Ottawa, and on to the distant fur country.\r\nHeavy canoes carrying four tons of merchandise were built for the\r\nfreight, and light canoes, some times manned with ten or twelve men,\r\ntook the officers at great speed along the route. The canoes were\r\nmarvels of durability. Made of thin but tough sheets of birch bark,\r\nsecurely gummed along the seams with pitch, they were so strong, and yet\r\nso light, that the Indians thought them an object of wonder, and said\r\nthey were the gift of the Manitou.\r\n\r\nThe voyageurs were a hardy class of men, trained from boyhood to the\r\nuse of the paddle. Many of them were Iroquois Indians--pure or with an\r\nadmixture of white blood. But the French Canadians, too, became noted\r\nfor their expert management of the canoe, and were favourites of Sir\r\nGeorge Simpson. Like all sailors, the voyageurs felt the day of their\r\ndeparture a day of fate. Very often they sought to drown their sorrows\r\nin the flowing bowl, and it was the trick of the commander to prevent\r\nthis by keeping the exact time of the departure a secret, filling up\r\nthe time of the voyageurs with plenty to do and leaving on very short\r\nnotice. However, as the cargo was well-nigh shipped, wives, daughters,\r\nchildren, and sweethearts too, of the departing canoe men began to\r\nlinger about the docks, and so were ready to bid their sad farewells.\r\n\r\nIn the governor's or chief factor's brigade each voyageur wore a feather\r\nin his cap, and if the wind permitted it a British ensign was hoisted\r\non each light canoe. Farewells were soon over. Cheers filled the air\r\nfrom those left behind, and out from Lachine up Lake St. Louis, an\r\nenlargement of the St. Lawrence, the brigade of canoes were soon to\r\nshoot on their long voyage. No sooner had \"le maître\" found his cargo\r\nafloat, his officers and visitors safely seated, than he gave the cheery\r\nword to start, when the men broke out with a \"chanson de voyage.\"\r\nPerhaps it was the story of the \"Three Fairy Ducks,\" with its chorus\r\nso lively in French, but so prosaic, even in the hands of the poetic\r\nMcLennan, when translated into English as the \"Rolling Ball\":--\r\n\r\n    \"Derrière chez nous, il y a un étang\r\n    (Behind the manor lies the mere),\r\n          En roulant ma boule. (Chorus.)\r\n    Trois beaux canards s'en vont baignant.\r\n    (Three ducks bathe in its waters clear.)\r\n          En roulant ma boule.\r\n    Rouli, roulant, ma boule roulant,\r\n    En roulant, ma boule roulant,\r\n          En roulant ma boule.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now the paddles strike with accustomed dash. The voyageurs are\r\nexcited with the prospect of the voyage, all scenes of home swim before\r\ntheir eyes, and the chorister leads off with his story of the prince\r\n(fils du roi) drawing near the lake, and with his magic gun cruelly\r\nsighting the black duck, but killing the white one. With falling voices\r\nthe swinging men of the canoe relate how from the snow-white drake his\r\n\r\n    \"Life blood falls in rubies bright,\r\n    His diamond eyes have lost their light,\r\n    His plumes go floating east and west,\r\n    And form at last a soldier's bed.\r\n          En roulant ma boule\r\n    (Sweet refuge for the wanderer's head),\r\n          En roulant ma boule,\r\n    Rouli, roulant, ma boule roulant,\r\n    En roulant ma boule roulant,\r\n          En roulant ma boule.\"\r\n\r\nAs the brigade hies on its way, to the right is the purplish brown water\r\nof the Ottawa, and on the left the green tinge of the St. Lawrence,\r\ntill suddenly turning around the western extremity of the Island of\r\nMontreal, the boiling waters of the mouth of the Ottawa are before the\r\nvoyageurs. Since 1816 there has been a canal by which the canoes avoid\r\nthese rapids, but before that time all men and officers disembarked and\r\nthe goods were taken by portage around the foaming waters.\r\n\r\nAnd now the village of Ste. Anne's is reached, a sacred place to the\r\ndeparting voyageurs, and here at the old warehouse the canoes are\r\nmoored. Among the group of pretty Canadian houses stands out the\r\nGothic church with its spire so dear an object to the canoe men. The\r\nsuperstitious voyageurs relate that old Bréboeuf, who had gone as priest\r\nwith the early French explorers, had been badly injured on the portage\r\nby the fall of earth and stones upon him. The attendance possible for\r\nhim was small, and he had laid himself down to die on the spot where\r\nstands the church. He prayed to Ste. Anne, the sailors' guardian, and on\r\nher appearing to him he promised to build a church if he survived. Of\r\ncourse, say the voyageurs, with a merry twinkle of the eye, he recovered\r\nand kept his word. At the shrine of \"la bonne Ste. Anne\" the voyageur\r\nmade his vow of devotion, asked for protection on his voyage, and left\r\nsuch gift as he could to the patron saint.\r\n\r\nComing up and down the river at this point the voyageurs often sang the\r\nsong:--\r\n\r\n    \"Dans mon chemin j'ai rencontré\r\n    Deux cavaliers très bien montés;\"\r\n\r\nwith the refrain to every verse:--\r\n\r\n    \"A l'ombre d'un bois je m'en vais jouer,\r\n    A l'ombre d'un bois je m'en vais jouer.\"\r\n    (\"Under the shady tree I go to play.\")\r\n\r\nIt is said that it was when struck with the movement and rhythm of\r\nthis French chanson that Thomas Moore, the Irish poet, on his visit to\r\nCanada, while on its inland waters, wrote the \"Canadian Boat Song,\" and\r\nmade celebrated the good Ste. Anne of the voyageurs. Whether in the\r\nfirst lines he succeeded in imitating the original or not, his musical\r\nnotes are agreeable:--\r\n\r\n    \"Faintly as tolls the evening chime,\r\n    Our voices keep tune and our oars keep time.\"\r\n\r\nCertainly the refrain has more of the spirit of the boatman's song:--\r\n\r\n    \"Row, brothers, row; the stream runs fast,\r\n    The rapids are near and the daylight's past.\"\r\n\r\nThe true colouring of the scene is reflected in\r\n\r\n    \"We'll sing at Ste. Anne;\"\r\n\r\nand--\r\n\r\n    \"Ottawa's tide, this trembling moon,\r\n    Shall see us float over thy surges soon.\"\r\n\r\nSte. Anne really had a high distinction among all the resting-places\r\non the fur trader's route. It was the last point in the departure\r\nfrom Montreal Island. Religion and sentiment for a hundred years\r\nhad consecrated it, and a short distance above it, on an eminence\r\noverlooking the narrows--the real mouth of the Ottawa--was a venerable\r\nruin, now overgrown with ivy and young trees, \"Château brillant,\" a\r\ncastle speaking of border foray and Indian warfare generations ago.\r\n\r\nIf the party was a distinguished one there was often a priest included,\r\nand he, as soon as the brigade was fairly off and the party had settled\r\ndown to the motion, reverently removing his hat, sounded forth a loud\r\ninvocation to the Deity and to a long train of male and female saints,\r\nin a loud and full voice, while all the men at the end of each versicle\r\nmade response, \"Qu'il me bénisse.\" This done, he called for a song. None\r\nof the many songs of France would be more likely at this stage than the\r\nfavourite and most beloved of all French Canadian songs, \"A la Claire\r\nFontaine.\"\r\n\r\nThe leader in solo would ring out the verse--\r\n\r\n    \"A la claire fontaine,\r\n    M'en allent promener,\r\n    J'ai trouvé l'eau si belle,\r\n    Que je m'y sois baigné.\"\r\n\r\n    (\"Unto the crystal fountain,\r\n    For pleasure did I stray;\r\n    So fair I found the waters,\r\n    My limbs in them I lay.\")\r\n\r\nThen in full chorus all would unite, followed verse by verse. Most\r\ntouching of all would be the address to the nightingale--\r\n\r\n    \"Chantez, rossignol, chantez,\r\n    Toi qui as le coeur gai;\r\n    Tu as le coeur à rire,\r\n    Moi, je l'ai à pleurer.\"\r\n\r\n    (\"Sing, nightingale, keep singing,\r\n    Thou hast a heart so gay;\r\n    Thou hast a heart so merry,\r\n    While mine is sorrow's prey.\")\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful of all, the chorus, is again repeated, and is, as\r\ntranslated by Lighthall:--\r\n\r\n    \"Long is it I have loved thee,\r\n    Thee shall I love alway,\r\n          My dearest;\r\n    Long is it I have loved thee,\r\n    Thee shall I love alway.\"\r\n\r\nThe brigade swept on up the Lake of Two Mountains, and though the work\r\nwas hard, yet the spirit and exhilaration of the way kept up the hearts\r\nof the voyageurs and officers, and as one song was ended, another was\r\nbegun and carried through. Now it was the rollicking chanson, \"C'est\r\nla Belle Françoise,\" then the tender \"La Violette Dandine,\" and when\r\ninspiration was needed, that song of perennial interest, \"Malbrouck s'en\r\nva-t-en guerre.\"\r\n\r\nA distance up the Ottawa, however, the scenery changes, and the river\r\nis interrupted by three embarrassing rapids. At Carillon, opposite to\r\nwhich was Port Fortune, a great resort for retired fur traders, the\r\nlabours began, and so these rapids, Carillon, Long Sault, and Chute au\r\nBlondeau, now avoided by canals, were in the old days passed by portage\r\nwith infinite toil. Up the river to the great Chaudière, where the City\r\nof Ottawa now stands, they cheerfully rowed, and after another great\r\nportage the Upper Ottawa was faced.\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous and exacting part of the great river was the\r\nwell-known section where two long islands, the lower the Calumet, and\r\nthe Allumette block the stream, and fierce rapids are to be encountered.\r\nThis was the _pièce de résistance_ of the canoe-men's experience. Around\r\nit their superstitions clustered. On the shores were many crosses\r\nerected to mark the death, in the boiling surges beside the portage,\r\nof many comrades who had perished here. Between the two islands on the\r\nnorth side of the river, the Hudson's Bay Company had founded Fort\r\nCoulonge, used as a depôt or refuge in case of accident. No wonder the\r\nregion, with \"Deep River\" above, leading on to the sombre narrows of\r\n\"Hell Gate\" further up the stream, appealed to the fear and imagination\r\nof the voyageurs.\r\n\r\nBallad and story had grown round the boiling flood of the Calumet. As\r\nearly as the time of Champlain, the story goes that an educated and\r\ndaring Frenchman named Cadieux had settled here, and taken as his wife\r\none of the dusky Ottawas. The prowling Iroquois attacked his dwelling.\r\nCadieux and one Indian held the enemy at bay, and firing from different\r\npoints led them to believe that the stronghold was well manned. In the\r\nmeantime, the spouse of Cadieux and a few Indians launched their canoes\r\ninto the boiling waters and escaped. From pool to pool the canoe was\r\nwhirled, but in its course the Indians saw before them a female figure,\r\nin misty robes, leading them as protectress. The Christian spouse said\r\nit was the \"bonne Ste. Anne,\" who led them out of danger and saved them.\r\nThe Iroquois gave up the siege. Cadieux's companion had been killed, and\r\nthe surviving settler himself perished from exhaustion in the forest.\r\nBeside him, tradition says, was found his death-song, and this \"Lament\r\nde Cadieux,\" with its touching and attractive strain, the voyageurs sang\r\nwhen they faced the dangers of the foaming currents of the Upper Ottawa.\r\n\r\nThe whole route, with its rapids, whirlpools, and deceptive currents,\r\ncame to be surrounded, especially in superstitious minds, with an air\r\nof dangerous mystery. A traveller tells us that a prominent fur trader\r\npointed out to him the very spot where his father had been swept under\r\nthe eddy and drowned. The camp-fire stories were largely the accounts of\r\ndisasters and accidents on the long and dangerous way. As such a story\r\nwas told on the edge of a shadowy forest the voyageurs were filled with\r\ndread. The story of the Wendigo was an alarming one. No crew would push\r\non after the sun was set, lest they should see this apparition.\r\n\r\nSome said he was a spirit condemned to wander to and fro in the earth on\r\naccount of crimes committed, others believed the Wendigo was a desperate\r\noutcast, who had tasted human flesh, and prowled about at night, seeking\r\nin camping-places of the traders a victim. Tales were told of unlucky\r\ntrappers who had disappeared in the woods and had never been heard of\r\nagain. The story of the Wendigo made the camping-place to be surrounded\r\nwith a sombre interest to the traders.\r\n\r\nUnbelievers in this mysterious ogre freely declared that it was but a\r\npartner's story told to prevent the voyageurs delaying on their journey,\r\nand to hinder them from wandering to lonely spots by the rapids to fish\r\nor hunt. One of the old writers spoke of the enemy of the voyageurs--\r\n\r\n    \"Il se nourrit des corps des pauvres voyageurs,\r\n    Des malheureux passants et des navigateurs.\"\r\n\r\n    (\"He feeds on the bodies of unfortunate men of the river, of\r\n        unlucky travellers, and of the mariners.\")\r\n\r\nImpressed by the sombre memories of this fur traders' route, a traveller\r\nin the light canoes in fur-trading days, Dr. Bigsby, relates that he\r\nhad a great surprise when, picking his way along a rocky portage, he\r\n\"suddenly stumbled upon a young lady sitting alone under a bush in a\r\ngreen riding habit and white beaver bonnet.\" The impressionable doctor\r\nlooked upon this forest sylph and doubted whether she was\r\n\r\n    \"One of those fairy shepherds and shepherdesses\r\n    Who hereabouts live on simplicity and watercresses.\"\r\n\r\nAfter confused explanations on the part of both, the lady was found to\r\nbe an Ermatinger, daughter of the well-known trader of Sault Ste. Marie,\r\nwho with his party was then at the other end of the portage.\r\n\r\nWe may now, with the privilege accorded the writer, omit the hardships\r\nof hundreds of miles of painful journeying, and waft the party of the\r\nvoyageurs, whose fortunes we have been following, up to the head of\r\nthe west branch of the Ottawa, across the Vaz portages, and down a\r\nlittle stream into Lake Nipissing, where there was an old-time fort\r\nof the Nor'-Westers, named La Ronde. Across Lake Nipissing, down the\r\nFrench River, and over the Georgian Bay with its beautiful scenery, the\r\nvoyageurs' brigade at length reached the River St. Mary, soon to rest at\r\nthe famous old fort of Sault Ste. Marie. Sault Ste. Marie was the home\r\nof the Ermatingers, to which the fairy shepherdess belonged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLOCK HOUSE OF OLD H. B. COMPANY POST.\r\n\r\nSault Ste. Marie.]\r\n\r\nThe Ermatinger family, whose name so continually associates itself\r\nwith Sault Ste. Marie, affords a fine example of energy and influence.\r\nShortly after the conquest of Canada by Wolfe, a Swiss merchant came\r\nfrom the United States and made Canada his home. One of his sons, George\r\nErmatinger, journeyed westward to the territory now making up Michigan,\r\nand, finding his way to Sault Ste. Marie, married, engaged in the fur\r\ntrade, and died there.\r\n\r\nStill more noted than his brother, Charles Oaks Ermatinger, going\r\nwestward from Montreal, also made Sault Ste. Marie his home. A man\r\nof great courage and local influence in the war of 1812, the younger\r\nbrother commanded a company of volunteers in the expedition from Fort\r\nSt. Joseph, which succeeded that summer in capturing Michilimackinac.\r\nHis fur-trading establishment at Sault Ste. Marie was situated on the\r\nsouth side of the river, opposite the rapids. When this territory was\r\ntaken possession of by the troops of the United States in 1822, the\r\nfur trader's premises at Sault Ste. Marie were seized and became the\r\nAmerican fort. For some years after this seizure trader Ermatinger had\r\na serious dispute with the United States Government about his property,\r\nbut finally received compensation. True to the Ermatinger disposition,\r\nthe trader then withdrew to the Canadian side, retained his British\r\nconnection, and carried on trade at Sault Ste. Marie, Drummond Island,\r\nand elsewhere.\r\n\r\nA resident of Sault Ste. Marie informs the writer that the family of\r\nErmatinger about that place is now a very numerous one, \"related to\r\nalmost all the families, both white and red.\" Very early in the century\r\n(1814), a passing trader named Franchère arrived from the west country\r\nat the time that the American troops devastated Sault Ste. Marie.\r\nCharles Ermatinger then had his buildings on the Canadian side of the\r\nriver, not far from the houses and stores of the North-West Company,\r\nwhich had been burnt down by the American troops. Ermatinger at the time\r\nwas living on the south side of the river temporarily in a house of old\r\ntrader Nolin, whose family, the traveller tells us, consisted of \"three\r\nhalf-breed boys and as many girls, one of whom was passably pretty.\"\r\nErmatinger had just erected a grist mill, and was then building a stone\r\nhouse \"very elegant.\" To this home the young lady overtaken by Dr.\r\nBigsby on the canoe route belonged. Of the two nephews of the doughty\r\nold trader of Sault Ste. Marie, Charles and Francis Ermatinger, who were\r\nprominent in the fur trade, more anon.\r\n\r\nThe dashing rapids of the St. Mary River are the natural feature which\r\nhas made the place celebrated. The exciting feat of \"running the rapids\"\r\nis accomplished by all distinguished visitors to the place. John\r\nBusheau, or some other dusky canoe-man, with unerring paddle, conducts\r\nthe shrinking tourist to within a yard of the boiling cauldron, and\r\nsweeps down through the spray and splash, as his passenger heaves a sigh\r\nof relief.\r\n\r\nThe obstruction made by the rapids to the navigation of the river, which\r\nis the artery connecting the trade of Lakes Huron and Superior, early\r\noccupied the thought of the fur traders. A century ago, during the\r\nconflict of the North-West Company and the X Y, the portage past the\r\nrapids was a subject of grave dispute. Ardent appeals were made to the\r\nGovernment to settle the matter. The X Y Company forced a road through\r\nthe disputed river frontage, while the North-West Company used a canal\r\nhalf a mile long, on which was built a lock; and at the foot of the\r\ncanal a good wharf and store-house had been constructed. This waterway,\r\nbuilt at the beginning of the century and capable of carrying loaded\r\ncanoes and considerable boats, was a remarkable proof of the energy and\r\nskill of the fur traders.\r\n\r\nThe river and rapids of St. Mary past, the joyful voyageurs hastened to\r\nskirt the great lake of Superior, on whose shores their destination lay.\r\nDeep and cold, Lake Superior, when stirred by angry winds, became the\r\ngrave of many a voyageur. Few that fell into its icy embrace escaped.\r\nIts rocky shores were the death of many a swift canoe, and its weird\r\nlegends were those of the Inini-Wudjoo, the great giant, or of the\r\nhungry heron that devoured the unwary. Cautiously along its shores Jean\r\nBaptiste crept to Michipicoten, then to the Pic, and on to Nepigon,\r\nplaces where trading posts marked the nerve centres of the fur trade.\r\n\r\nAt length, rounding Thunder Cape, Fort William was reached, the goal\r\nof the \"mangeur de lard\" or Montreal voyageur. Around the walls of\r\nthe fort the great encampment was made. The River Kaministiquia was\r\ngay with canoes; the East and West met in rivalry--the wild couriers\r\nof the West and the patient boatmen of the East. In sight of the fort\r\nstood, up the river, McKay Mountain, around which tradition had woven\r\nfancies and tales. Its terraced heights suggest man's work, but it is\r\nto this day in a state of nature. Here in the days of conflict, when\r\nthe opposing trappers and hunters went on their expeditions, old Trader\r\nMcKay ascended, followed them with his keen eye in their meanderings,\r\nand circumvented them in their plans.\r\n\r\nThe days of waiting, unloading, loading, feasting, and contending being\r\nover, the Montreal voyageurs turned their faces homeward, and with flags\r\nafloat, paddled away, now cheerfully singing sweet \"Alouette.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Ma mignonette, embrassez-moi.\r\n    Nenni, Monsieur, je n'oserais,\r\n    Car si mon papa le savait.\"\r\n\r\n    (My darling, smile on me.\r\n    No! No! good sir, I do not dare,\r\n    My dear papa would know! would know!)\r\n    \"But who would tell papa?\"\r\n    \"The birds on the forest tree.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Ils parlent français, latin aussi,\r\n    Hélas! que le monde est malin\r\n    D'apprendre aux oiseaux le latin.\"\r\n\r\n    (\"They speak French and Latin too,\r\n    Alas! the world is very bad\r\n    To tell its tales to the naughty birds.\")\r\n\r\nBon voyage! Bon voyage, mes voyageurs!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE FAR NORTH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nEXPLORERS IN THE FAR NORTH.\r\n\r\n     The North-West Passage again--Lieut.

From the time of Dobbs, the discomfiture of\r\nthat bitter enemy of the Hudson's Bay Company had checked the advance\r\nin following up the explorations of Davis and Baffin, whose names had\r\nbecome fixed on the icy sea channels of the North.\r\n\r\nCaptain Phipps, afterwards Lord Mulgrave, had been the last of the\r\ngreat captains who had taken part in the spasm of north-west interest\r\nset agoing by Dobbs. Two generations of men had passed when, in 1817,\r\nthe quest for the North-West Passage was taken up by Captain William\r\nScoresby. Scoresby advanced a fresh argument in favour of a new\r\neffort to attain this long-harboured dream of the English captains.\r\nHe maintained that a change had taken place in the seasons, and the\r\nposition of the ice was such as probably to allow a successful voyage to\r\nbe made from Baffin's Bay to Behring Strait.\r\n\r\nSir John Barrow with great energy advocated the project of a new\r\nexpedition, and Captain John Ross and Edward Parry were despatched to\r\nthe northern seas. Parry's second expedition enabled him to discover\r\nFury and Hecla Strait, to pass through Lancaster Strait, and to name\r\nthe continuation of it Barrow Strait, after the great patron of northern\r\nexploration.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN'S LAND EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile John Franklin was despatched to cross the plains of Rupert's\r\nLand to forward Arctic enterprise. This notable man has left us an\r\nheritage of undying interest in connection with this movement. A\r\nnative of Lincolnshire, a capable and trusted naval officer, who had\r\nfought with Nelson at Copenhagen, who had gone on an Arctic voyage to\r\nSpitzbergen, and had seen much service elsewhere, he was appointed to\r\ncommand the overland expedition through Rupert's Land to the Arctic Sea,\r\nwhile Lieutenant Parry sought, as we have seen, the passage with two\r\nvessels by way of Lancaster Sound.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by a surgeon--Dr. Richardson--two midshipmen, Back and\r\nHood, and a few Orkneymen, Lieutenant Franklin embarked from England\r\nfor Hudson Bay in June, 1819. Wintering for the first season on the\r\nSaskatchewan, the party were indebted to the Hudson's Bay Company for\r\nsupplies, and reached Fort Chipewyan in about a year from the time\r\nof their departure from England. The second winter was spent by the\r\nexpedition on the famous barren grounds of the Arctic slope. Their fort\r\nwas called Fort Enterprise, and the party obtained a living chiefly from\r\nthe game and fish of the region. In the following summer the Franklin\r\nparty descended the Coppermine River to the Arctic Sea. Here Hearne's\r\nmistake of four degrees in the latitude was corrected and the latitude\r\nof the mouth of the Coppermine River fixed at 67° 48´ N. Having explored\r\nthe coast of the Arctic Sea eastward for six degrees to Cape Turnagain\r\nand suffered great hardships, the survivors of the party made their\r\nreturn journey, and reached Britain after three years' absence. Franklin\r\nwas given the rank of captain and covered with social and literary\r\nhonours.\r\n\r\nThree years after his return to England, Captain Franklin and his\r\nold companions went upon their second journey through Rupert's Land.\r\nHaving reached Fort Chipewyan, they continued the journey northward,\r\nand the winter was spent at their erection known as Fort Franklin, on\r\nGreat Bear Lake. Here the party divided, one portion under Franklin\r\ngoing down the Mackenzie to the sea, and coasting westward to Return\r\nReef, hoping to reach Captain Cook's icy cape of 1778. In this they\r\nfailed. Dr. Richardson led the other party down the Mackenzie River\r\nto its mouth, and then, going eastward, reached the mouth of the\r\nCoppermine, which he ascended. By September both parties had gained\r\ntheir rendezvous, Fort Franklin, and it was found that unitedly they had\r\ntraced the coast line of the Arctic Sea through thirty-seven degrees of\r\nlongitude. On the return of the successful adventurer, after an absence\r\nof two years, to England, he was knighted and received the highest\r\nscientific honours.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN JOHN ROSS BY SEA.\r\n\r\nWhen the British people become roused upon a subject, failure seems\r\nbut to whet the public mind for new enterprise and greater effort. The\r\nNorth-West Passage was now regarded as a possibility. After the coast of\r\nthe Arctic Ocean had been traced by the Franklin-Richardson expedition,\r\nto reach this shore by a passage from Parry's Fury and Hecla Strait\r\nseemed feasible.\r\n\r\nTwo years after the return of Franklin from his second overland journey,\r\nan expedition was fitted out by a wealthy distiller, Sheriff Felix\r\nBooth, and the ship, the _Victory_, provided by him, was placed under\r\nthe command of Captain John Ross, who had already gained reputation in\r\nexploring Baffin's Bay. Captain Ross was ably seconded in his expedition\r\nby his nephew, Captain James Ross. Going by Baffin's Bay and through\r\nLancaster Sound, Prince Regent's Inlet led Ross southward between\r\nCockburn Island and Somerset North, into an open sea called after\r\nhis patron, Gulf of Boothia, on the west side of which he named the\r\nnewly-discovered land Boothia Felix. He even discovered the land to the\r\nwest of Boothia, calling it King William Land. His ship became embedded\r\nin the ice. After four winters in the Arctic regions he was rescued by a\r\nwhaler in Barrow Strait.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable events in this voyage of Ross's was his\r\ndiscovery of the North Magnetic Pole on the west side of Boothia Felix.\r\nDuring his second winter (1831) Captain Ross determined to gratify his\r\nambition to be the discoverer of the point where the magnetic needle\r\nstands vertically, as showing the centre of terrestrial magnetism for\r\nthe northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nAfter four or five days' overland journey, with a trying headwind from\r\nthe north-west, he reached the sought-for point on June 1st. We deem it\r\nonly just to state the discovery in the words of the veteran explorer\r\nhimself:--\r\n\r\n\"The land at this place is very low near the coast, but it rises into\r\nridges of fifty or sixty feet high about a mile inland. We could have\r\nwished that a place so important had possessed more of mark or note.\r\nIt was scarcely censurable to regret that there was not a mountain to\r\nindicate a spot to which so much interest must ever be attached; and I\r\ncould even have pardoned any one among us who had been so romantic or\r\nabsurd as to expect that the magnetic pole was an object as conspicuous\r\nand mysterious as the fabled mountain of Sinbad, that it was even a\r\nmountain of iron, or a magnet as large as Mont Blanc. But Nature had\r\nhere erected no monument to denote the spot which she had chosen as\r\nthe centre of one of her great and dark powers; and where we could do\r\nlittle ourselves towards this end, it was our business to submit, and to\r\nbe content in noting in mathematical numbers and signs, as with things\r\nof far more importance in the terrestrial system, what we could ill\r\ndistinguish in any other manner.\r\n\r\n\"The necessary observations were immediately commenced, and they were\r\ncontinued throughout this and the greater part of the following day....\r\nThe amount of the dip, as indicated by my dipping-needle, was 89° 59´,\r\nbeing thus within one minute of the vertical; while the proximity at\r\nleast of this pole, if not its actual existence where we stood, was\r\nfurther confirmed by the action, or rather by the total inaction, of\r\nseveral horizontal needles then in my possession.... There was not one\r\nwhich showed the slightest effort to move from the position in which it\r\nwas placed.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I had satisfied my own mind on this subject, I made known\r\nto the party this gratifying result of all our joint labours; and it\r\nwas then that, amidst mutual congratulations, we fixed the British flag\r\non the spot, and took possession of the North Magnetic Pole and its\r\nadjoining territory, in the name of Great Britain and King William the\r\nFourth. We had abundance of material for building in the fragments of\r\nlimestone that covered the beach; and we therefore erected a cairn of\r\nsome magnitude, under which we buried a canister containing a record\r\nof the interesting fact, only regretting that we had not the means of\r\nconstructing a pyramid of more importance and of strength sufficient\r\nto withstand the assaults of time and of the Esquimaux. Had it been a\r\npyramid as large as that of Cheops I am not quite sure that it would\r\nhave done more than satisfy our ambition under the feelings of that\r\nexciting day. The latitude of this spot is 70° 5´ 17´´ and its longitude\r\n96° 46´ 45´´.\"\r\n\r\nThus much for the magnetic pole. This pole is almost directly north\r\nof the city of Winnipeg, and within less than twenty degrees of it.\r\nOne of Lady Franklin's captains--Captain Kennedy, who resided at Red\r\nRiver--elaborated a great scheme for tapping the central supply of\r\nelectricity of the magnetic pole, and developing it from Winnipeg as a\r\nsource of power.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR GEORGE BACK, THE EXPLORER.\r\n\r\nIn the third year of Captain Ross's expedition his protracted absence\r\nbecame a matter of public discussion in Britain. Dr. Richardson, who had\r\nbeen one of Franklin's followers, offered to take charge of an overland\r\nexpedition in search of Ross, but his proposition was not accepted.\r\nMr. Ross, a brother of Sir John and father of Captain James Ross, was\r\nanxious to find an officer who would take charge of a relief expedition,\r\nand the British Government favoured the enterprise. Captain George Back,\r\none of the midshipmen who had accompanied Franklin, was favourably\r\nregarded for the important position.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson's Bay Company was in sympathy with the exploration of its\r\nArctic possessions and gave every assistance to the project. Nicholas\r\nGarry, the Deputy-Governor of the Company, ably supported it; and the\r\nBritish Government at last gave its consent to grant two thousand\r\npounds, provided the Hudson's Bay Company would furnish, according to\r\nits promise, the supplies and canoes free of charge, and that Captain\r\nRoss's friends would contribute three thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nCaptain Back cordially accepted the offer to command the expedition,\r\nand his orders from the Government were to find Captain Ross, or any\r\nsurvivors or survivor of his party; and, \"subordinate to this, to direct\r\nhis attention to mapping what remains unknown of the coasts which he was\r\nto visit, and make such other scientific observations as his leisure\r\nwould admit.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1833 Captain Back crossed the Atlantic, accompanied by a surgeon,\r\nDr. Richard King, and at Montreal obtained a party of four regulars of\r\nthe Royal Artillery. Pushing on by the usual route, he reached Lake\r\nWinnipeg, and thence by light canoe arrived at Fort Resolution on Great\r\nSlave Lake in August. He wintered at Fort Reliance, near the east end of\r\nGreat Slave Lake, which was established by Roderick McLeod, a Hudson's\r\nBay Company officer, who had received orders to assist the expedition.\r\nBefore leaving this point a message arrived from England that Captain\r\nRoss was safe. Notwithstanding this news, in June of the following year\r\nBack and his party crossed the country to Artillery Lake, and drew\r\ntheir boats and baggage in a most toilsome manner over the ice of this\r\nand three other lakes, till the Great Fish River was reached and its\r\ndifficult descent begun.\r\n\r\nOn July 30th the party encamped at Cape Beaufort, a prominent point of\r\nthe inlet of the Arctic Ocean into which the Great Fish River empties.\r\nThe expedition again descended the river and returned to England, where\r\nit was well received, and Captain Back was knighted for his pluck and\r\nperseverance. An expedition under Back in the next year, to go by ship\r\nto Wager Bay and then to cross by portage the narrow strip of land\r\nto the Gulf of Boothia, was a failure, and the party with difficulty\r\nreached Britain again.\r\n\r\n\r\nA HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY EXPEDITION--DEASE AND SIMPSON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR JOHN FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\nLADY FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\nSIR GEORGE BACK.\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN RICHARDSON.\r\n\r\nSEARCHERS IN THE NORTH.]\r\n\r\nDr. Richard King, who had been Back's assistant and surgeon, now\r\nendeavoured to organize an expedition to the Arctic Ocean by way of Lake\r\nAthabasca and through a chain of lakes leading to the Great Fish\r\nRiver. This project received no backing from the British Government or\r\nfrom the Hudson's Bay Company. The Company now undertook to carry out an\r\nexpedition of its own. The reasons of this are stated to have been--(1)\r\nThe interest of the British public in the effort to connect the\r\ndiscoveries of Captains Back and Ross; (2) They are said to have desired\r\na renewal of their expiring lease for twenty-one years of the trade of\r\nthe Indian territories; (3) The fact was being pointed out, as in former\r\nyears, that their charter required the Company to carry on exploration.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 the Hudson's Bay Company in London decided to carrying out\r\nthe expedition, and gave instructions to Governor Simpson to organize\r\nand despatch it. At Norway House, at the meeting of the Governor and\r\nofficers of that year, steps were taken to explore the Arctic Coast. An\r\nexperienced Hudson's Bay Company officer, Peter Warren Dease, and with\r\nhim an ardent young man, Thomas Simpson, a relation of the Governor, was\r\nplaced in charge.\r\n\r\nThe party, after various preparations, including a course of mathematics\r\nand astronomy received by Thomas Simpson at Red River, made its\r\ndeparture, and Fort Chipewyan was reached in February, where the\r\nremainder of the winter was spent. As soon as navigation opened, the\r\ndescent of the Mackenzie River was made to the mouth. The party then\r\ncoasting westward on the Arctic Ocean, passed Franklin's \"Return Reef,\"\r\nreached Boat Extreme, and Simpson made a foot journey thence to Cape\r\nBarrow.\r\n\r\nHaving returned to the mouth of the Mackenzie River, the Great Bear\r\nLake, where Fort Confidence had been erected by the advance guard of the\r\nparty, was reached.\r\n\r\nThe winter was passed at this point, and in the following spring the\r\nexpedition descended the Copper-mine River, and coasting eastward along\r\nthe Polar Sea, reached Cape Turnagain in August. Returning and ascending\r\nthe Coppermine for a distance, the party halted, and Simpson made a land\r\njourney eastward to new territory which he called Victoria Land, and\r\nerected a pillar of stones, taking possession of the country, \"in the\r\nname of the Honourable Company, and for the Queen of Great Britain.\"\r\nTheir painful course was then retraced to Fort Confidence, where the\r\nsecond winter was spent.\r\n\r\nOn the opening of spring, the Company descended to the coast to carry\r\non their work. Going eastward, they, after much difficulty, reached new\r\nground, passed Dease's Strait, and discovered Cape Britannia.\r\n\r\nTaking two years to return, Simpson arrived at Fort Garry, and\r\ndisappointed at not receiving further instructions, he joined a freight\r\nparty about to cross the plains to St. Paul, Minnesota. While on the way\r\nhe was killed, either by his half-breed companions or by his own hand.\r\nHis body was brought back to Fort Garry, and is buried at St. John's\r\ncemetery.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson's Bay Company thus made an earnest effort to explore the\r\ncoast, and through its agents, Dease and Simpson, may be said to have\r\nbeen reasonably successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEARCH FOR FRANKLIN.\r\n\r\nAfter the return of Sir John Franklin from his second overland\r\nexpedition in Rupert's Land, Sir John was given the honourable position\r\nof Lieutenant-Governor of Tasmania, and on his coming again to England,\r\nwas asked by the Admiralty to undertake a sea voyage for the purpose of\r\nfinding his way from Lancaster Sound to Behring's Strait.\r\n\r\nSir John accepted the trust, and his popularity led to the offer of\r\nnumerous volunteers, who were willing to undertake the hazards of the\r\njourney. Two excellent vessels, the _Erebus_ and _Terror_, well fitted\r\nout for the journey, were provided, and his expedition started with the\r\nmost glowing hopes of success, on May 19th, 1845. Many people in Britain\r\nwere quite convinced that the expectation of a north-west passage was\r\nnow to be realized.\r\n\r\nWe know now only too well the barrier which lay in Franklin's way.\r\nAlmost directly north-east of the mouth of Fish River, which Back and\r\nSimpson had both found, there lies a vast mass of ice, which can neither\r\nmove toward Behring's Strait on account of the shallow opening there,\r\nor to Baffin's Bay on account of the narrow and tortuous winding of the\r\nchannels. This, called by Sir George Nares the Paleocrystic Sea, we are\r\nnow aware bars the progress of any ship. Franklin had gone down on the\r\nwest side of North Somerset and Boothia, and coming against the vast\r\nbarrier of the Paleocrystic Sea, had been able to go no further.\r\n\r\nTwo years after the departure of the expedition from which so much was\r\nexpected, there were still no tidings. Preparations were made for an\r\nexpedition to rescue the adventurers, and in 1848 the first party of\r\nrelief sailed.\r\n\r\nFor the next eleven years the energy and spirit and liberality\r\nof the British public were something unexampled in the annals of\r\npublic sympathy. Regardless of cost or hazard, not less than fifteen\r\nexpeditions were sent out by England and the United States on their sad\r\nquest. Lady Franklin, with a heroism and skill past all praise, kept\r\nthe eye of the nation steadily on her loss, and sacrificed her private\r\nfortune in the work of rescue. We are not called upon to give the\r\ndetails of these expeditions, but may refer to a few notable points.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson's Bay Company at once undertook a journey by land in quest of\r\nthe unfortunate navigator. Dr. Richardson, who had gone on Franklin's\r\nfirst expedition, along with a well-known Hudson's Bay Company officer,\r\nDr. Rae, scoured the coast of the Arctic Sea, from the mouth of the\r\nMackenzie to that of the Coppermine River. For two years more, Dr.\r\nRae continued the search, and in the fourth year (1851) this facile\r\ntraveller, by a long sledge journey in spring and boat voyage in summer,\r\nexamined the shores of Wollaston and Victoria Land.\r\n\r\nA notable expedition took place in the sending out by Lady Franklin\r\nherself of the _Prince Albert_ schooner, under Captain Kennedy, who\r\nafterwards made his home in the Red River settlement. His second in\r\ncommand was Lieutenant Bellot, of the French Navy, who was a plucky\r\nand shrewd explorer, and who, on a long sledge journey, discovered the\r\nStrait which bears his name between North Somerset and Boothia.\r\n\r\nThe names of McClure, Austin, Collinson, Sir Edmund Belcher, and Kellett\r\nstand out in bold relief in the efforts--fruitless in this case--made to\r\nrecover traces of the unfortunate expedition.\r\n\r\nThe first to come upon remains of the Franklin expedition was Dr. John\r\nRae, who, we have seen, had thoroughly examined the coast along the\r\nArctic Ocean. The writer well remembers meeting Dr. Rae many years after\r\nin the city of Winnipeg and hearing his story.\r\n\r\nRae was a lithe, active, enterprising man. In 1853, he announced that\r\nthe drawback in former expeditions had been the custom of carrying a\r\ngreat stock of provisions and useless impedimenta, and so under Hudson's\r\nBay Company auspices he undertook to go with gun and fishing tackle up\r\nthe west coast of Hudson Bay. This he did, ascended Chesterfield Inlet,\r\nand wintered with eight men at Repulse Bay.\r\n\r\nIn the next season he made a remarkable journey of fifty-six days, and\r\nsucceeded in connecting the discoveries of Captain James Ross with\r\nthose of Dease and Simpson, proving King William Land to be an island.\r\nRae discovered on this journey plate and silver decorations among the\r\nEskimos, which they admitted had belonged to the Franklin party. Dr. Rae\r\nwas awarded a part of the twenty thousand pounds reward offered by the\r\nImperial Government.\r\n\r\nThe British people could not, however, be satisfied until something more\r\nwas done, and Lady Franklin, with marvellous self-devotion, gave the\r\nlast of her available means to add to the public subscription for the\r\npurchase and fitting out of the little yacht _Fox_, which, under Captain\r\nLeopold McClintock, sailed from Aberdeen in 1857. Having in less than\r\ntwo years reached Bellot Strait, McClintock's party was divided into\r\nthree sledging expeditions. One of them, under Captain McClintock, was\r\nvery successful, obtaining relics of the lost Franklin and his party and\r\nfinding a cairn which contained an authoritative record of the fortunes\r\nof the company for three years. Sir John had died a year before this\r\nrecord was written. Captain McClintock was knighted for his successful\r\neffort and the worst was now at last known.\r\n\r\nThe attempt of Sir John and the efforts to find him reflect the highest\r\nhonour on the British people. And not only sentiment, but reason was\r\nsatisfied. As had been said, \"the catastrophe of Sir John Franklin's\r\nexpedition led to seven thousand miles of coast line being discovered,\r\nand to a vast extent of unknown country being explored, securing very\r\nconsiderable additions to geographical knowledge. Much attention was\r\nalso given to the collection of information, and the scientific results\r\nof the various search expeditions were considerable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nEXPEDITIONS TO THE FRONTIER OF THE FUR COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n     A disputed boundary--Sources of the Mississippi--The fur\r\n     traders push southward--Expedition up the Missouri--Lewis and\r\n     Clarke meet Nor'-Westers--Claim of United States made--Sad death of\r\n     Lewis--Lieutenant Pike's journey--Pike meets fur traders--Cautions\r\n     Dakotas--Treaty with Chippewas--Violent death--Long and Keating fix\r\n     49 deg.

It is now clearly shown that Lord\r\nShelbourne, the English Premier, desired to promote good feeling between\r\nmother and daughter as nations. Accordingly the boundary line west of\r\nLake Superior gave over a wide region where British traders had numerous\r\nestablishments, and where their occupation should have counted for\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nIn the treaty of amity and commerce, eleven years afterward, it was\r\nagreed that a line drawn from Lake of the Woods overland to the source\r\nof Mississippi should be the boundary. But, alas! the sources of the\r\nMississippi for fifty years afterward proved as difficult a problem\r\nas the source of the Nile. In the first decade of this century it was\r\nimpossible to draw the southern line of Rupert's Land. The United States\r\nduring this period evinced some anxiety in regard to this boundary, and,\r\nas we shall see, a number of expeditions were despatched to explore the\r\ncountry. The sources of the Mississippi naturally afforded much interest\r\nto the Government at Washington, even though the convention of London\r\nof 1818 had settled the 49 deg. N. as the boundary.\r\n\r\nThe region west of the Mississippi, which was known as Louisiana,\r\nextended northward to the British possessions, having been transferred\r\nby Spain to the United States in 1803. A number of expeditions to the\r\nmarches or boundary land claim a short notice from us, as being bound up\r\nwith the history and interests of the Hudson's Bay Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEWIS AND CLARKE'S EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\nOf these, a notable and interesting voyage was that of Captains\r\nMeriwether Lewis and William Clarke, of the United States army. This\r\nexpedition consisted of nearly fifty men--soldiers, volunteers,\r\nadventurers, and servants. Being a Government expedition, it was well\r\nprovided with stores, Indian presents, weapons, and other necessary\r\narticles of travel. Leaving Wood River, near St. Louis, the party\r\nstarted up the Missouri in three boats, and were accompanied by two\r\nhorses along the bank of the River to bring them game or to hunt in\r\ncase of scarcity. After many adventures the expedition, which began\r\nits journey on May 14th, 1804, reached the headquarters of the Mandan\r\nIndians on the Missouri on October 26th.\r\n\r\nThe Mandans, or, as they have been called, the White Bearded Sioux, were\r\nat this time a large and most interesting people. Less copper-coloured\r\nthan the other Indians, agricultural in habit, pottery makers, and\r\ndwelling in houses partly sunk in the earth, their trade was sought from\r\ndifferent directions. We have seen already that Verendrye first reached\r\nthem; that David Thompson, the astronomer of the North-West Company,\r\nvisited them; that Harmon and others, North-West traders, met them; that\r\nfur traders from the Assiniboine came to them; that even the Hudson's\r\nBay Company had penetrated to their borders. The Mandans themselves\r\njourneyed north to the Assiniboine and carried Indian corn, which they\r\ngrew, to Rupert's Land to exchange for merchandise. The Mandan trail can\r\nstill be pointed out in Manitoba.\r\n\r\nA fur trader, Hugh McCracken, met Lewis and Clarke at this point, and\r\nwe read, \"That he set out on November 1st on his return to the British\r\nfort and factory on the Assiniboine River, about one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles from this place. He took a letter from Captain Lewis to the\r\nNorth-West Company, enclosing a copy of the passport granted by the\r\nBritish Minister in the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThis shows the uncertainty as to the boundary line, the leaders of the\r\nexpedition having provided themselves with this permission in case of\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the Mandans, Captain Lewis gave them presents, and\r\n\"told them that they had heard of the British trader, Mr. Laroche,\r\nhaving attempted to distribute medals and flags among them; but that\r\nthese emblems could not be received from any other than the American\r\nnation, without incurring the displeasure of their Great Father, 'the\r\nPresident. On December 1st the party was visited by a trader, Henderson,\r\nwho came from the Hudson's Bay Company. He had been about eight days on\r\nhis route in a direction nearly south, and brought with him tobacco,\r\nbeads, and other merchandise to trade for furs, and a few guns which\r\nwere to be exchanged for horses. On December 17th Hugh Harvey and\r\ntwo companions arrived at the camp, having come in six days from the\r\nBritish establishment on the Assiniboine, with a letter from Mr. Charles\r\nChaboillez, one of the North-West Company, who, with much politeness,\r\noffered to render us any service in his power.\"\r\n\r\nWith the expedition of Lewis and Clarke we have little more to do. It\r\nsuccessfully crossed from the sources of the Missouri, over the Rocky\r\nMountains to the Columbia, descended it to the mouth, and returned by\r\nnearly the same route, reaching the mouth of the Missouri in 1806.\r\n\r\nThe expedition of Lewis and Clarke has become the most celebrated of the\r\nAmerican transcontinental ventures. Its early presence at the mouth of\r\nthe Columbia River gave strength to the claim of the United States for\r\nthat region; it was virtually a taking possession of the whole country\r\nfrom the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean; it had a picturesqueness and\r\nan interest that appealed to the national mind, and the melancholy\r\ndeath of Captain Lewis, who, in 1809, when the American Government\r\nrefused to fulfil its engagements with him, blew out his brains, lends\r\nan impressiveness to what was really a great and successful undertaking.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIKE'S EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\nThe source or sources of the Mississippi was, as we have seen, an\r\nimportant matter in settling the boundary line between the possessions\r\nof Great Britain and the United States. The matter having occupied the\r\nauthorities at Washington, Zebulon M. Pike, a lieutenant of the United\r\nStates army, was sent to examine the country upon the Upper Mississippi\r\nand to maintain the interests of the Government in that quarter. Leaving\r\nSt. Louis on August 9th, 1805, he ascended the \"Father of Waters,\" and\r\nreached Prairie du Chien in September. Here he was met by the well-known\r\nfree-traders who carried on the fur trade in this region. Their names\r\nwere Fisher, Frazer and Woods. These men were in the habit of working\r\nlargely in harmony with the North-West Company traders, and, on account\r\nof their British origin, were objects of suspicion to the United States\r\nauthorities. Pushing on among the Indians, by the help of French\r\nCanadian interpreters, he came to Lake Pepin. On the shores of this\r\nlake Pike met Murdoch Cameron, the principal British free-trader on the\r\nupper Minnesota River. Cameron was a shrewd and daring Scotchman, noted\r\nfor his generosity and faithfulness. He was received with distinction\r\nby Pike, and the trader as shown by his grave, pointed out many years\r\nafterward on the banks of the Minnesota, was in every way worthy of the\r\nattention. Shortly after this, Pike passed near where the city of St.\r\nPaul, Minn., stands to-day, the encampment of J. B. Faribault, a French\r\nCanadian free-trader of note, whose name is now borne by an important\r\ntown south of St. Paul. Pike held a council with the Dakota Indians, and\r\npurchased from them a considerable amount of land for military purposes,\r\nfor which the Senate paid them the sum of two thousand dollars. Pike\r\nseems to have cautioned the Dakotas or Sioux to beware of the influence\r\nof the English, saying, \"I think the traders who come from Canada are\r\nbad birds among the Chippeways, and instigate them to make war upon\r\ntheir red brothers, the Sioux.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the end of October, unable to proceed further up the Mississippi\r\non account of ice, Pike built a blockhouse, which he enclosed with\r\npickets, and there spent the most severe part of the winter.\r\n\r\nAt his post early in December he was visited by Robert Dickson, a\r\nBritish fur trader, described by Neill as \"a red-haired Scotchman, of\r\nstrong intellect, good family, and ardent attachment to the crown\r\nof England, who was at the head of the Indian trade in Minnesota.\"\r\nPike himself speaks of Dickson as a \"gentleman of general commercial\r\nknowledge and of open, frank manners.\" Explanations took place between\r\nthe Government agent and the trader as to the excessive use of spirits\r\nby the Indians.\r\n\r\nOn December 10th Pike started on a journey northward in sleds, taking\r\na canoe with him for use so soon as the river should open. When Pike\r\narrived near Red Cedar Lake, he was met by four Chippewa Indians, a\r\nFrenchman, and one of the North-West traders, named Grant. Going with\r\nGrant to his establishment on the shores of the lake, Pike tells us,\r\n\"When we came in sight of the house I observed the flag of Great Britain\r\nflying. I felt indignant, and cannot say what my feelings would have\r\nexcited me to had Grant not told me that it belonged to the Indians.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 1st Pike reached Leech Lake, which he considered to be the\r\nmain source of the Mississippi. He crossed the lake twelve miles to\r\nthe establishment of the North-West Company, which was in charge of a\r\nwell-known North-West trader, Hugh McGillies. While he was treated with\r\ncivility, it is plain from his cautions to McGillies and his bearing to\r\nhim, that he was jealous of the influence which British traders were\r\nthen exercising in Minnesota.\r\n\r\nHaving made a treaty with the Chippewa Indians of Red Lake, Pike's work\r\nwas largely accomplished, and in April he departed from this region,\r\nwhere he had shown great energy and tact, to give in his report after a\r\nvoyage of some nine months.\r\n\r\nA most melancholy interest attaches to this gentlemanly and\r\nmuch-respected officer of the United States. In the war of 1812-15,\r\nPike, then made a general, was killed at the taking of York (Toronto),\r\nin Upper Canada, by the explosion of the magazine of the fort evacuated\r\nby General Sheaffe. Pike, as leader on this Mississippi expedition, as\r\ncommanding an expedition on the Rio Grande, where he was captured by the\r\nSpaniards, and as a brave soldier, has handed down an honourable name\r\nand fame.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONG AND KEATING.\r\n\r\nThe successful journey of Lewis and Clarke, as well as the somewhat\r\nuseful expedition of Lieutenant Pike, led the United States Government\r\nto send in 1823 an expedition to the northern boundary line 49 deg. N.,\r\nwhich had been settled a few years before. In charge of this was Major\r\nStephen H. Long. He was accompanied by a scientific corps consisting of\r\nThomas Say, zoologist and antiquary; Samuel Seymour, landscape painter\r\nand designer; and William H. Keating, mineralogist and geologist, who\r\nalso acted as historian of the expedition.\r\n\r\nLeaving Philadelphia in April, the company passed overland to Prairie\r\ndu Chien on the Mississippi, ascended this river, and going up its\r\nbranch, the Minnesota, reached the town of Mendota in the month of\r\nJuly. A well-known French half-breed, Joseph Renville, acted as guide,\r\nand several others joined the party at this point. After journeying up\r\nthe Minnesota River, partly by canoe, and partly by the use of horses,\r\nthey reached in thirteen days Big Stone Lake, which is considered to\r\nbe the source of the river. Following up the bed of a dried-up stream\r\nfor three miles, they found Lake Traverse, the source of the Red River,\r\nand reached Pembina Village, a collection of fifty or sixty log huts\r\ninhabited by half-breeds, numbering about three hundred and fifty. We\r\nhave already seen how the North-West and Hudson's Bay Companies had\r\nposts at this place, and that it had been visited regularly by the\r\nSelkirk settlers as being in proximity to the open plains where buffalo\r\ncould be obtained. On the day after Long's arrival he saw the return\r\nof the buffalo hunters from the chase. The procession consisted of\r\none hundred and fifteen carts, each loaded with about eight hundred\r\npounds of the pressed buffalo meat. There were three hundred persons,\r\nincluding the women. The number of horses was about two hundred. Twenty\r\nhunters, mounted on their best steeds, rode abreast, giving a salute as\r\nthey passed the encampment of the expedition.\r\n\r\nOne of Major Long's objects in making his Journey was to ascertain the\r\npoint where the parallel of 49 deg. N. crossed the Red River. For four\r\ndays observations were taken and a flag-staff planted a short distance\r\nsouth of the 49th parallel. The space to the boundary line was measured\r\noff, and an oak post fixed on it, having on the north side the letters\r\nG. B., and on the south side U. S. This post was kept up and was seen by\r\nthe writer in 1871. In 1872, a joint expedition of British and American\r\nengineers took observations and found Long's point virtually correct.\r\nThey surveyed the line of 49 deg. eastward to Lake of the Woods and\r\nwestward to the Rocky Mountains. Posts were erected at short distances\r\nalong the boundary line, many of them of iron, with the words on them,\r\n\"Convention of London, 1818.\"\r\n\r\nHis work at Pembina having been accomplished, Major Long gave up, on\r\naccount of the low country to be passed, the thought of following the\r\nboundary line eastward to the Lake of the Woods. He sold his horses and\r\ntook canoes down the river to the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Garry,\r\nwhere he was much interested in the northern civilization as well as in\r\nthe settlers who had Fort Douglas as their centre.\r\n\r\nIt was August 17th when Long's expedition left Fort Douglas and went\r\ndown the Red River. It took but two days to reach the mouth of the river\r\nand cross Lake Winnipeg to Fort Alexander at the mouth of the Winnipeg\r\nRiver. Six days more brought the swift canoe-men up the river to Lake\r\nof the Woods. At the falls of Rainy River was the Hudson's Bay Company\r\nestablishment, then under the charge of fur trader McGillivray. On the\r\nopposite side of the river was the fort of the American Fur Company.\r\nFollowing the old route, they reached Grand Portage, September 12th,\r\nand thence the expedition returned to the East. Major Long's expedition\r\nwas a well-conducted and successful enterprise. Its members were of\r\nthe highest respectability, and the two volumes written by Secretary\r\nKeating have the charm of real adventure about them.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELTRAMI'S DASH.\r\n\r\nWhen Major Long was leaving Fort Snelling, on the Mississippi, to go\r\nupon the expedition we have just described, an erratic but energetic and\r\nclever Italian, named J. C. Beltrami, asked to be allowed to accompany\r\nhim. This aspiring but wayward man has left us a book, consisting of\r\nletters addressed to Madame la Comtesse Compagoni, a lady of rank\r\nin Florence, which is very interesting. On starting he wrote, \"My\r\nfirst intention, that of going in search of the real source of the\r\nMississippi, was always before my eyes.\"\r\n\r\nBeltrami, while clever, seems to have been a man of insufferable\r\nconceit. On the journey to Big Stone Lake and thence along the river, in\r\nthe buffalo hunts, in conferences with the Sioux, the Italian adventurer\r\nawakened the resentment of the commander of the expedition, who refused\r\nto allow him to accompany his party further. This proved rather\r\nfavourable to the purpose of Beltrami, who, with a half-breed guide and\r\nChippewa Indians, started to go eastward, having a mule and a dog train\r\nas means of transport. After a few days' journey the guide left him,\r\nreturning with the mule and dog train to Pembina. Next his Indian guide\r\ndeserted him, fearing the Sioux, and Beltrami was left to make his way\r\nin a canoe up the river to Red Lake. Inexperienced in the management of\r\na birch bark canoe, Beltrami was upset, but he at length proceeded along\r\nthe bank and shallows of the river, dragging the canoe with a tow line\r\nafter him, and arrived in miserable plight at Red Lake.\r\n\r\nHere he engaged a guide and interpreter, and writes that he went \"where\r\nno white man had previously travelled.\" He was now on the highway to\r\nrenown. He was taken from point to point on the many lakes of Northern\r\nMinnesota, and affixed names to them. On August 20th, 1823, he went over\r\nseveral portages, led by his guide to Turtle Lake, which was to him a\r\nsource of wonder, as he saw it from the flow of waters south to the\r\nGulf of Mexico, north to the Frozen Sea, east to the Atlantic, and west\r\ntoward the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nHis own words are: \"A vast platform crosses this distinguished supreme\r\nelevation, and, what is more astonishing, in the midst of it rises a\r\nlake. How is this lake formed? Whence do its waters proceed? This lake\r\nhas no issue! And my eyes, which are not deficient in sharpness, cannot\r\ndiscover in the whole extent of the clearest and widest horizon any\r\nland which rises above it. All places around it are, on the contrary,\r\nconsiderably lower.\"\r\n\r\nBeltrami then went to examine the surrounding country, and found the\r\nlake, to which he gave the name of Lake Julia, to be bottomless.\r\nThis lake he pronounces to be the source of the Mississippi River.\r\nThis opinion was published abroad and accepted by some, but later\r\nexplorations proved him to be wrong. A small lake to the south-west,\r\nafterwards found to be the true source, was described to him by his\r\nguide as Lac La Biche, and he placed this on his chart as \"Doe Lake,\"\r\nthe west source of the Mississippi. It is a curious fact that Lake\r\nJulia was the same lake surveyed twenty-five years before by astronomer\r\nThompson.\r\n\r\nAfter further explorations, Beltrami returned to Fort Snelling, near St.\r\nPaul, Minn., being clothed in Indian garments, with a piece of bark for\r\na hat.\r\n\r\nThe intrepid explorer found his way to New Orleans, where he published\r\n\"La Découverte des Sources du Mississippi.\" Though the work was\r\ncriticized with some severity, yet Beltrami, on his arrival at London\r\nin 1827, published \"A Pilgrimage in Europe and America\" in two volumes,\r\nwhich are the source of our information. The county in Minnesota, which\r\nincludes both Julia and Doe Lakes, is appropriately called Beltrami\r\nCounty.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASS AND SCHOOLCRAFT.\r\n\r\nLewis Cass, of New Hampshire was appointed Governor of Michigan in 1813.\r\nSix years after this he addressed the Secretary of War in Washington,\r\nproposing an expedition to and through Lake Superior, and to the\r\nsources of the Mississippi. It was planned for an examination of the\r\nprincipal features of the North-West tributary to Lake Superior and\r\nthe Mississippi River. This was sanctioned in 1820, and the expedition\r\nembarked in May of that year at Detroit, Michigan, Henry Schoolcraft\r\nbeing mineralogist, and Captain D. B. Douglas topographer and astronomer.\r\n\r\nThe expedition, after much contrary weather, reached Sault Ste. Marie,\r\nand the Governor, after much difficulty, here negotiated a treaty with\r\nthe Indians. Going by way of the Fond du Lac, the party entered the\r\nSt. Louis River, and made a tiresome portage to Sandy Lake station.\r\nThis fur-trading post the party left in July, and ascended the Upper\r\nMississippi to the Upper Cedar Lake, the name of which was changed\r\nto Lake Cassina, and afterwards Cass Lake. From the Indians Governor\r\nCass learned that Lac La Biche--some fifty miles further on--was the\r\ntrue source of the river, but he was deterred by their accounts of the\r\nlowness of the water and the fierceness of the current from attempting\r\nthe journey any further. The expedition ingloriously retired from the\r\nproject, going down to St. Anthony Falls, ascending the Wisconsin River,\r\nand thence down Fox River. The Governor himself in September arrived in\r\nDetroit, having crossed the Southern Peninsula of Michigan on horseback.\r\n\r\nHon. J. W. Brown says: \"When Governor Cass abandoned his purpose to\r\nascend the Mississippi to its source, he was within an easy distance,\r\ncomparatively speaking, of the goal sought for. Less timidity had often\r\nbeen displayed in canoe voyages, even in the face of low water, and an\r\nO-z-a-win-dib or a Keg-wed-zis-sag, Indian guides, would have easily won\r\nthe battle of the day for Governor Cass.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOLCRAFT AT LENGTH SUCCEEDS.\r\n\r\nHenry Rowe Schoolcraft, of good family, was born in New York State, and\r\nwas educated in that State and in Vermont. His first expedition was in\r\ncompany with De Witt Clinton in a journey to Missouri and Arkansas. On\r\nhis return he published two treatises which gave him some reputation\r\nas an explorer and scientist. We have already spoken of the part taken\r\nby him in the expedition of Governor Cass. He received after this the\r\nappointment of \"Superintendent of Indian Affairs\" at Sault Ste. Marie,\r\nand to this we are indebted for the treasury of Indian lore published in\r\nfour large quarto volumes, from which Longfellow obtained his tale of\r\n\"Hiawatha.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1830 Schoolcraft received orders from Washington, ostensibly for\r\nconference with the Indians, but in reality to determine the source\r\nof the Mississippi. The Rev. W. T. Boutwell, representing a Board of\r\nMissions, accompanied the expedition.\r\n\r\nLac La Biche was already known to exist, and to this Schoolcraft pointed\r\nhis expedition. On their journey outward Schoolcraft suddenly one day\r\nasked Boutwell the Greek and Latin names for the headwaters or true\r\nsource of a river. Mr. Boutwell could not recall the Greek, but gave\r\nthe two Latin words--_veritas_ (truth) and _caput_ (head). These were\r\nwritten on a slip of paper, and Mr. Schoolcraft struck out the first and\r\nlast three letters, and announced to Boutwell that \"Itasca shall be the\r\nname.\" It is true that Schoolcraft wrote a stanza in which he says, \"By\r\nfair Itasca shed,\" seemingly referring to an Indian maiden. Boutwell,\r\nhowever, always maintained his story of the name, and this is supported\r\nby the fact that the word was never heard in the Ojibway mythology.\r\n\r\nThe party followed the same route as that taken by Governor Cass on his\r\njourney, reaching Cass Lake on July 10th, 1832. Taking the advice of\r\nOzawinder, a Chippewa Indian, they followed up their journey in birch\r\nbark canoes, went up the smaller fork of the Mississippi, and then by\r\nportage reached the eastern extremity of La Biche or Itasca Lake.\r\n\r\nThe party landed on the island in the lake which has since been known\r\nas Schoolcraft Island, and here raised their flag. After exploring the\r\nshores of the lake, he returned to Cass Lake, and, full of pride of\r\nhis discovery, journeyed home to Sault Ste. Marie. On the map drawn\r\nto illustrate Schoolcraft's inland journey occurs, beside the lake of\r\nhis discovery, the legend, \"Itasca Lake, the source of the Mississippi\r\nRiver; length from Gulf of Mexico, 3,160 miles; elevation, 1,500 ft.\r\nReached July 13th, 1832.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORT EDMONTON, ON THE NORTH SASKATCHEWAN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JASPER HOUSE, ROCKY MOUNTAINS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nFAMOUS JOURNEYS IN RUPERT'S LAND.\r\n\r\n     Fascination of an unknown land--Adventure, science,\r\n     or gain--Lieutenant Lefroy's magnetic survey--Hudson's Bay\r\n     Company assists--Winters at Fort Chipewyan--First scientific\r\n     visit to Peace River--Notes lost--Not \"gratuitous canoe\r\n     conveyance\"--Captain Palliser and Lieutenant Hector--Journey\r\n     through Rupert's Land--Rocky Mountain passes--On to the coast--A\r\n     successful expedition--Hind and Dawson--To spy out the land for\r\n     Canada--The fertile belt--Hind's description good--Milton and\r\n     Cheadle--Winter on the Saskatchewan--Reach Pacific Ocean in a\r\n     pitiable condition--Captain Butler--The horse Blackie and dog \"Cerf\r\n     Vola\"--Fleming and Grant--\"Ocean to ocean\"--\"Land fitted for a\r\n     healthy and hardy race\"--Waggon road and railway.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vast area of Rupert's Land and the adjoining Indian territories have\r\nalways had a fascination for the British imagination; and not alone its\r\nwide extent, but its being a fur traders' paradise, and in consequence\r\nlargely a \"terra incognita,\" has led adventurous spirits to desire to\r\nexplore it.\r\n\r\nJust as Sir John Mandeville's expedition to the unknown regions of Asia\r\nin the fourteenth century has appealed to the hardy and brave sons of\r\nBritain from that early day; and in later times the famous ride of\r\nColonel Burnaby to Khiva in our own generation has led Central Asia to\r\nbe viewed as a land of mystery; so the plains of Rupert's Land, with the\r\nreputed Chinese wall thrown around them by the Hudson's Bay Company's\r\nmonopoly, have been a favourite resort for the traveller, the mighty\r\nhunter, and the scientist.\r\n\r\nIt is true no succeeding records of adventure can have the interest\r\nfor us that gathers around those of the intrepid Verendrye, the\r\nmysterious Hearne, or the heroic Alexander Mackenzie, whose journeys we\r\nhave already described, yet many daring adventurers who have gone on\r\nscientific or exploratory expeditions, or who have travelled the wide\r\nexpanse for sport or for mere curiosity, may claim our attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEFROY'S MAGNETIC SURVEY.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the magnetic pole by Sir John Ross, and the continued\r\ninterest in the problems connected with the Arctic Sea, the romance\r\nof the North land, and the dream of a North-West Passage, led to the\r\ndesire to have a scientific survey of the wide expanse of Rupert's Land.\r\nThe matter was brought to the notice of the Royal Society by Major,\r\nafterwards General Sir Edward Sabine, a noted student of magnetism.\r\nSir John Herschell, the leading light on the subject of physics,\r\nsucceeded in inducing the Society to pronounce a favourable opinion\r\non the project, and the strong influence of the Royal Society, under\r\nthe presidency of the Marquis of Northampton, induced the Lords of the\r\nTreasury to meet the estimated expenses, nine hundred and ten pounds,\r\nwith the understanding that, as stated by the President, gratuitous\r\ncanoe conveyance would be provided by the Hudson's Bay Company in the\r\nterritories belonging to them.\r\n\r\nLieutenant, afterwards General Sir Henry Lefroy, a young artillery\r\nofficer, was selected to go upon the journey. A circular letter was sent\r\nto the Hudson's Bay Company posts by Governor Simpson, directing that\r\nevery assistance should be given to the survey. Lefroy, having wintered\r\nin Montreal, was given a passage on May 1st, 1842, on the canoes for\r\nthe North-West. Passing up the Ottawa and along the fur traders'\r\nroute, he soon reached Sault Ste. Marie and Fort William; magnetic\r\nobservations, accurate observations of latitude and longitude being\r\nmade at the Hudson's Bay Company posts along the route. Kakabeka Falls\r\nand the various points along the Kaministiquia route were examined, and\r\nexchanging the \"canot de maître\" for the \"canot de Nord,\" by way of Lake\r\nof the Woods and Lake Winnipeg, the observer arrived at Fort Garry on\r\nJune 29th, having found Sir George Simpson at Lower Fort Garry.\r\n\r\nAfter a close examination of the Red River Valley and some geological\r\nobservations on the west side of Lake Winnipeg, Lefroy made his way to\r\nNorway House, and then by the watercourses, four hundred miles, to York\r\nFactory. Having done good work on the Bay, he made the return journey to\r\nNorway House, and on August 22nd, Cumberland House on the Saskatchewan\r\nwas gained. Here he adopted the latitude and longitude taken by\r\nFranklin's two land expeditions, and here took seven independent\r\nobservations of variation and dip of the magnetic needle.\r\n\r\nNow striking energetically northward, and stopping long enough at the\r\nposts to take the necessary observations, the explorer arrived at Fort\r\nChipewyan on September 23rd. It was twelve years since the dwellers on\r\nLake Athabasca had been visited by any traveller from the south, and\r\nLefroy's voyageurs, as they completed their three thousand miles of\r\njourney, decked out in their best apparel, made the echoes of the lake\r\nresound with their gay chansons. Lefroy wintered in the fort, where the\r\nwinter months were enjoyed in the well-selected library of the Company\r\nand the new experiences of the fur trader's life, while his voyageurs\r\nwent away to support themselves at a fishing station on the lake.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1843 was spent in a round of thirteen hundred and forty\r\nmiles, going from Lake Athabasca, up the Peace River to Fort Dunvegan,\r\nthen by way of Lower Slave Lake to Edmonton, and down the Saskatchewan\r\nto Cumberland. Lefroy claims that no scientific traveller had visited\r\nthe Peace River since the time of Alexander Mackenzie, fifty-five years\r\nbefore. Unfortunately, Lefroy's notes of this journey and some of his\r\nbest observations were lost in his return through the United States, and\r\ncould not be replaced.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1844, Lieutenant Lefroy left Lake Athabasca, and travelled\r\non snow shoes to Fort Resolution on Great Slave Lake, and thence to\r\nFort Simpson, four hundred and fifty miles, having his instruments\r\nfor observation borne on dog sleds. This journey was made in nineteen\r\ndays. Waiting at the Fort till May, he accomplished the descent of the\r\nMackenzie River after the breaking up of the ice, and reached Fort Good\r\nHope. The return journey to Fort Resolution was made at a very rapid\r\nrate, and the route thence to Lake Athabasca was followed. The diary\r\nends June 30th, 1844.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the expedition some misunderstanding arose as to the\r\nsettlement of the accounts. The Hudson's Bay Company had promised to\r\ngive \"gratuitous canoe conveyance.\" The original plan of the journey\r\nwas, however, much changed, and Lieutenant Lefroy was a much greater\r\nexpense to the Company than had been expected. A bill of upwards of\r\ntwelve hundred pounds was rendered by the Hudson's Bay Company to the\r\nRoyal Society. After certain explanations and negotiations a compromise\r\nof eight hundred and fifty pounds was agreed on, and this was paid by\r\nthe Treasury Department to the Company.\r\n\r\nThe work done by Lieutenant Lefroy was of the most accurate and valuable\r\nkind. His name is remembered as that of one of the most trustworthy\r\nof the explorers of the plains of Rupert's Land and the North, and is\r\ncommemorated by Fort Lefroy in the Rocky Mountains. It is true his\r\nevidence, recorded in the Blue Book of 1857, was somewhat disappointing,\r\nbut his errors were those of judgment, not of prejudice or intention.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALLISER AND HECTOR.\r\n\r\nThe approach of the time when the twenty-one years' lease of the Indian\r\nterritories granted by the Imperial Parliament to the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany was drawing near a close in 1857, when the Committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons met in February of this year to consider the matter. A\r\nvast mass of evidence was taken, and the consideration of the Blue Book\r\ncontaining this will afford us material for a very interesting chapter.\r\nThe interest in the matter, and the necessity for obtaining expert\r\ninformation, led the Imperial Government to organize an expedition under\r\nCaptain John Palliser, R.N.A., of the Royal Engineers. With Captain\r\nPalliser, who was to go up the Canadian lakes to the interior, was\r\nassociated Lieutenant Blakiston, R.N., who received orders to proceed\r\nby ship to York Factory and meet the main expedition at some point in\r\nRupert's Land. The geologist of the expedition was James Hector, M.D.\r\n(Edin.). J. W. Sullivan was secretary and M. E. Bourgeau, botanist.\r\n\r\nAfter the usual incidents of an ocean voyage, some difficulty with the\r\nCustoms authorities in New York arose as to the entry of astronomical\r\ninstruments, which was happily overcome, and after a long journey by\r\nway of Detroit, Sault Ste. Marie was reached, where Palliser found two\r\nbirch bark canoes and sixteen voyageurs awaiting him, as provided by the\r\nHudson's Bay Company. Sir George Simpson had lately passed this point.\r\nJourneying along the fur traders' route, the explorers found themselves\r\nexpected at Fort Frances, on Rainy River.\r\n\r\nHere a deputation of Indians waited upon them, and the old chief\r\ndiscoursed thus: \"I do not ask for presents, although I am poor and my\r\npeople are hungry, but I know you have come straight from the Great\r\nCountry, and we know that no men from that country ever came to us and\r\nlied. I want you to declare to us truthfully what the Great Queen of\r\nyour country intends to do to us when she will take the country from the\r\nfur company's people. All around me I see the smoke of the white men to\r\nrise. The 'Long Knives' (the Americans) are trading with our neighbours\r\nfor their lands and they are cheating them and deceiving them. Now, we\r\nwill not sell nor part with our lands.\"\r\n\r\nHaving reached Fort Garry, Captain Palliser divided his party, sending\r\none section west, and himself going south to the boundary line with the\r\nother. Going west from Pembina, Palliser reached the French half-breed\r\nsettlement of St. Joseph (St. Jo.), and some days afterwards Turtle\r\nMountain. Thence he hurried across country to Fort Ellice to meet the\r\nother portion of his expedition.\r\n\r\nWhile the tired horses rested here he made an excursion of a notable\r\nkind to the South-West. This was to the \"Roches Percées\" on the Souris\r\nRiver. This is a famous spot, noted for the presence of Tertiary\r\nsandstone exposures, which have weathered into the most fantastic\r\nshapes. It is a sacred spot of the Indians. Here, as at the \"Red\r\nPipestone Quarry,\" described by Longfellow, and not more than one\r\nhundred and fifty miles distant from it, Sioux, Assiniboines, and Crees\r\nmeet in peace. Though war may prevail elsewhere, this spot is by mutual\r\nagreement kept as neutral. At this point Palliser saw a great camp of\r\nAssiniboines.\r\n\r\nReturning from this side excursion, the Captain resumed his command, and\r\nhaving obtained McKay, the Hudson's Bay Company officer at Fort Ellice,\r\nwith Governor Christie's permission, set off by way of Qu'Appelle Lakes\r\nfor the elbow of the Saskatchewan.\r\n\r\nOn the South Saskatchewan Palliser came to the \"heart of the buffalo\r\ncountry.\" The whole region as far as the eye could reach was covered\r\nwith the buffalo in bands varying from hundreds to thousands. So vast\r\nwere the herds, that he began to have serious apprehensions for his\r\nhorses, as \"the grass was eaten to the earth, as if the place had been\r\ndevastated by locusts.\"\r\n\r\nCrossing the Saskatchewan the explorers went northward to Fort Carlton\r\non the north branch, where the party wintered while Captain Palliser\r\nreturned to Canada, paying 65_l._ to a Red River trader to drive him\r\nfive hundred and twenty miles from Fort Garry to Crow Wing, the nearest\r\nMinnesota settlement. Palliser's horse, for which he had bargained, was\r\nkilled at Pembina, and he walked the four hundred and fifty miles of the\r\njourney, which was made with painful slowness by the struggling horses\r\nand sleds of the traders.\r\n\r\nIn June of the following year Palliser left Fort Carlton, part of his\r\ncommand going to the Red Deer River, the other part to visit Fort Pitt\r\nand Edmonton House. From Edmonton the explorer reports that during\r\nthe summer, his men had succeeded in finding a pass through the Rocky\r\nMountains, one not only practicable for horses, but which, with but\r\nlittle expense, could be rendered available for carts also.\r\n\r\nHe also states the passes discovered by him to be:--\r\n\r\n(1) Kananaskis Pass and Vermilion Pass;\r\n\r\n(2) Lake Pass and Beaver Foot Pass;\r\n\r\n(3) Little Fork Pass;\r\n\r\n(4) Kicking Horse Pass--six in all, which, with the North Kootenay (on\r\nBritish territory), make up seven known passes.\r\n\r\nHaving wintered at Edmonton, he satisfied himself that this region so\r\nfar north and west is a good agricultural region, that the Saskatchewan\r\nregion compares favourably with that of the Red River Valley, that the\r\nrule of the country should be given over by the Hudson's Bay Company to\r\nthe general Government, and that a railway could be built easily from\r\nthe Red River to the eastern foot of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nOrders having reached Palliser to proceed, he undertook, in the summer\r\nof 1859, a journey across the Rocky Mountains, following in part the\r\nold Hudson's Bay Company trail. On St. Andrew's Day, the party arrived\r\nat the Hudson's Bay Company post at Vancouver on the Columbia, and was\r\nwelcomed by Mr. Graham, the officer in charge.\r\n\r\nTaking steamer down the Columbia with his assistant Sullivan, Captain\r\nPalliser went to Victoria, a Hudson's Bay Company establishment on\r\nVancouver Island, whither they were followed by Dr. Hector. Journeying\r\nsouth-west to San Francisco, he returned, _viâ_ Isthmus of Panama, to\r\nNew York and England.\r\n\r\nThe expedition was one of the best organized, best managed, and most\r\nsuccessful that visited Rupert's Land. The report is a sensible,\r\nwell-balanced, minute, and reliable account of the country passed over.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIND AND DAWSON'S EXPLORATION.\r\n\r\nIn the same year that Palliser's expedition was despatched by the\r\nBritish Government to examine the resources and characteristics of\r\nRupert's Land, a party was sent by the Canadian Government with similar\r\nends in view, but more especially to examine the routes and means of\r\naccess by which the prairies of the North-West might be reached from\r\nLake Superior.\r\n\r\nThe staff of the party was as follows: George Gladman, director;\r\nProfessor Henry Youle Hind, geologist; W. H. E. Napier, engineer; S. J.\r\nDawson, surveyor. These, along with several foremen, twelve Caughnawaga\r\nIroquois, from near Lachine, and twelve Ojibway Indians from Fort\r\nWilliam, made up a stirring canoe party of forty-four persons.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1857, the expedition left Toronto, went by land to Collingwood\r\non Lake Huron, embarked there on the steamer _Collingwood_, and passing\r\nby Sault St. Marie, reached on August 1st Fort William at the mouth of\r\nthe Kaministiquia. Mr. John McIntyre, the officer of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany in charge of Fort William, has given to the writer an account\r\nof the arrival of the party there with their great supply canoes,\r\ntrading outfit, and apparatus, piled up high on the steamer's deck--a\r\ngreat contrast to the scanty but probably more efficient means of\r\ntransport found on a Hudson's Bay Company trading journey. The party in\r\ndue time went forward over the usual fur traders' route, which we have\r\nso often described, and arrived at Fort Garry early in September.\r\n\r\nAs the object of the expedition was to spy out the land, the Red River\r\nsettlement, now grown to considerable size, afforded the explorers an\r\ninteresting field for study. Simple though the conditions of life were,\r\nyet the fact that six or seven thousands of human beings were gaining a\r\nlivelihood and were possessed of a number of the amenities of life, made\r\nits impress on the visitors, and Hind's chapters VI. to X. of his first\r\nvolume are taken up with a general account of the settlement, the banks\r\nof the Red River, statistics of population, administration of justice,\r\ntrade, occupations of the people, missions, education, and agriculture\r\nat Red River.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at the settlement, the leaders devised plans for\r\novertaking their work. The approach of winter made it impossible to plan\r\nexpeditions over the plains to any profit. Mr. Gladman returned by canoe\r\nto Lake Superior early in September, Napier and his assistants took\r\nup their abode among the better class of English-speaking half-breeds\r\nbetween the upper and lower forts on the banks of the Red River. Mr.\r\nDawson found shelter among his Roman Catholic co-religionists half a\r\nmile from Fort Garry. He and his party were to be engaged during the\r\nwinter between Red River and the Lake of the Woods, along the route\r\nafterwards called the Dawson Road, while Hind followed his party up the\r\nwestern bank of Red River to Pembina, and his own account is that there\r\nwas of them \"all told, five gentlemen, five half-breeds, six saddle\r\nhorses, and five carts, to which were respectively attached four poor\r\nhorses and one refractory mule.\"\r\n\r\nThis party was returning to Canada, going by way of Crow Wing, thence by\r\nstage coach to St. Paul, on the Mississippi, then by rail unbroken to\r\nToronto, which was reached after an absence of three and a half months.\r\n\r\nThe next season Hind was placed in charge of the expedition, and\r\nwith new assistants went up the lakes in May, leading them by the\r\nlong-deserted route of Grand Portage instead of by Kaministiquia. The\r\njourney from Lake Superior to Fort Garry was made in about twenty-one\r\ndays. On their arrival at Red River the party found that Mr. Dawson\r\nhad gone on an exploring tour to the Saskatchewan. Having organized\r\nhis expedition Hind now went up the Assiniboine to Fort Ellice. The\r\nQu'Appelle Valley was then explored, and the lake reached from which two\r\nstreamlets flow, one into the Qu'Appelle and thence to the Assiniboine,\r\nthe other into the Saskatchewan. Descending the Saskatchewan, at the\r\nmouth of which the Grand Rapids impressed the party, they made the\r\njourney thence up Lake Winnipeg and Red River to the place of departure.\r\nThe tour was a most interesting one, having occupied all the summer.\r\nHind was a close observer, was most skilful in working with the Hudson's\r\nBay Company and its officers, and he gained an excellent view of the\r\nmost fertile parts of the country. His estimate of it on the whole\r\nhas been wonderfully borne out by succeeding years of experience and\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILTON AND CHEADLE.\r\n\r\nThe world at large, after Hind's expedition and the publication of\r\nhis interesting observations, began to know more of the fur traders'\r\nland and showed more interest in it. In the years succeeding Hind's\r\nexpedition a number of enterprising Canadians reached Fort Garry by way\r\nof St. Paul, Minn., and took up their abode in the country. A daring\r\nband of nearly 200 Canadians, drawn by the gold fever, started in 1862,\r\non an overland journey to Cariboo; but many of them perished by the way.\r\nThree other well-known expeditions deserve notice.\r\n\r\nThe first of these was in 1862 by Viscount Milton and Dr. Cheadle.\r\nComing from England by way of Minnesota to Fort Garry, they stopped at\r\nRed River settlement, and by conveyance crossed the prairies in their\r\nfirst season as far as Fort Carlton on the North Saskatchewan, and\r\nwintered there. The season was enjoyable, and in spring the explorers\r\nascended the Saskatchewan to Edmonton, and then, by way of the Yellow\r\nHead Pass, crossed the Rocky Mountains. Their descent down the Thompson\r\nRiver was a most difficult one. The explorers were nearly lost through\r\nstarvation, and on their arrival by way of Fraser River at Victoria\r\ntheir appearance was most distressing and their condition most pitiable.\r\nA few years ago, in company with a party of members of the British\r\nAssociation, Dr. Cheadle visited Winnipeg, and at a banquet in the city\r\nexpressed to the writer his surprise that the former state of scarcity\r\nof food even on Red River had been so changed into the evident plenty\r\nwhich Manitoba now enjoys. Milton and Cheadle's \"The North-West Passage\r\nby Land\" is a most enjoyable book.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN BUTLER.\r\n\r\nIn the early months of the year 1870, when Red River settlement was\r\nunder the hand of the rebel Louis Riel, a tall, distinguished-looking\r\nstranger descended the Red River in the steamer _International_.\r\nNews had been sent by a courier on horseback to the rebel chief that\r\na dangerous stranger was approaching. The stalwart Irish visitor\r\nwas Captain W. F. Butler, of H.M. 69th Regiment of Foot. As the\r\n_International_ neared Fort Garry, Butler, with a well-known resident of\r\nRed River settlement, sprang upon the river-bank from the steamer in the\r\ndark as she turned into the Assiniboine River.\r\n\r\nHe escaped to the lower part of the settlement, but the knowledge that\r\nhe had a letter from the Roman Catholic Archbishop Taché led to the\r\nrebel chief sending for and promising him a safe-conduct. Butler came\r\nand inspected the fort, and again departed to Lake Winnipeg, River\r\nWinnipeg, and Lake of the Woods, where he accomplished his real mission,\r\nin telling to General Wolseley, of the relief expedition coming to drive\r\naway the rebels, the state of matters in the Red River.\r\n\r\nCaptain Butler then went west, crossed country to the Saskatchewan,\r\ndescended the river, and in winter came through, by snow-shoe and dog\r\ntrain, over Lakes Winnipegoosis and Manitoba to the east, and then to\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nLove of adventure brought Captain Butler back to the North-West. In\r\n1872 he journeyed through the former fur traders' land, reaching Lake\r\nAthabasca in March, 1873. Ascending the Peace River, he arrived in\r\nNorthern British Columbia in May. Through three hundred and fifty miles\r\nof the dense forests of New Caledonia he toiled to reach Quesnel, on the\r\nFraser, four hundred miles north of Victoria, British Columbia, where he\r\nin due time landed.\r\n\r\nCaptain Butler has left a graphic, perhaps somewhat embellished, account\r\nof his travels in the books, \"Great Lone Land\" and \"Wild North Land.\"\r\nThe central figure of his first book is the faithful horse \"Blackie\" and\r\nof the second the Eskimo dog \"Cerf-Vola.\" The appreciative reader feels,\r\nhowever, especially in the latter, the spirit and power of Milton's and\r\nCheadle's \"North-West Passage by Land\" everywhere in these descriptive\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLEMING AND GRANT.\r\n\r\nThird of these expeditions was that undertaken in 1872, under the\r\nleadership of Sandford Fleming, which has been chronicled in the\r\nwork \"Ocean to Ocean,\" by Rev. Principal Grant. The writer saw this\r\nexpedition at Winnipeg in the summer of its arrival. It came for the\r\npurpose of crossing the plains, as a preliminary survey for a railway.\r\nThe party came up the lakes, and by boat and portage over the traders'\r\nroute, and the Dawson Road from Lake of the Woods to Red River, and\r\nhalted near Fort Garry. Going westward, they for the most part followed\r\nthe path of Milton and Cheadle. Fort Carlton and then Edmonton House\r\nwere reached, and the Yellow Head Pass was followed to the North\r\nThompson River. The forks of the river at Kamloops were passed, and\r\nthen the canoe way down the Fraser to the sea was taken. The return\r\njourney was made by way of San Francisco. The expedition did much to\r\nopen the way for Canadian emigration and to keep before the minds of\r\nCanadians the necessity for a waggon road across the Rocky Mountains\r\nand for a railway from ocean to ocean as soon as possible. Dr. Grant's\r\nconclusion was: \"We know that we have a great North-West, a country like\r\nold Canada--not suited for lotus-eaters to live in, but fitted to rear a\r\nhealthy and hardy race.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nRED RIVER SETTLEMENT.\r\n\r\n1817-1846.\r\n\r\n     Chiefly Scottish and French settlers--Many\r\n     hardships--Grasshoppers--Yellow Head--\"Gouverneur\r\n     Sauterelle\"--Swiss settlers--Remarkable parchment--Captain\r\n     Bulger, a military governor--Indian troubles--Donald Mackenzie,\r\n     a fur trader, governor--Many projects fail--The flood--Plenty\r\n     follows--Social condition--Lower Fort built--Upper Fort\r\n     Garry--Council of Assiniboia--The settlement organized--Duncan\r\n     Finlayson governor--English farmers--Governor Christie--Serious\r\n     epidemic--A regiment of regulars--The unfortunate major--The people\r\n     restless.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cessation of hostilities between the rival Companies afforded\r\nan opportunity to Lord Selkirk's settlement to proceed with its\r\ndevelopment. To the scared and harassed settlers it gave the prospects\r\nof peace under their Governor, Alexander Macdonell, who had been in\r\nthe fur trade, but took charge of the settlement after the departure\r\nof Miles Macdonell. The state of affairs was far from promising. The\r\npopulation of Scottish and Irish settlers was less than two hundred.\r\nThere were a hundred or thereabout of De Meurons, brought up by Lord\r\nSelkirk, and a number of French voyageurs, free traders or \"freemen\" as\r\nopposed to _engagés_, and those who, with their half-breed families,\r\nhad begun to assemble about the forks and to take up holdings for\r\nthemselves. For the last mentioned, the hunt, fishing, and the fur trade\r\nafforded a living; but as to the settlers and De Meurons, Providence\r\nseemed to favour them but little more than the hostile Nor'-Westers had\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nThe settlers were chiefly men who were unacquainted with farming, and\r\nthey had few implements, no cattle or horses, and the hoe and spade\r\nwere their only means of fitting the soil for the small quantity of\r\ngrain supplied them for sowing. Other means of employment or livelihood\r\nthere were none. In 1818 the crops of the settlers were devoured by an\r\nincursion of locusts. On several occasions clouds of these destructive\r\ninsects have visited Red River, and their ravages are not only serious,\r\nbut they paralyze all effort on the part of the husbandmen. The\r\ndescription given by the prophet Joel was precisely reproduced on the\r\nbanks of the Red River, \"the land is as the Garden of Eden before them,\r\nand behind them is a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape\r\nthem.\" There was no resource for the settlers but to betake themselves\r\nto Pembina to seek the buffalo. In the next year they sowed their scanty\r\nseed, but the young \"grasshoppers,\" as they were called, rose from the\r\neggs deposited in the previous year, and while the wheat was in the\r\nblade, cleared it from the fields more thoroughly than any reaper could\r\nhave done. This scourge continued till the spring of 1821, when the\r\nlocusts disappeared suddenly, and the crop of that year was a bountiful\r\none.\r\n\r\nDuring these years the colony was understood to be under the personal\r\nownership of Lord Selkirk. He regarded himself as responsible, as lord\r\nparamount of the district, for the safety and support of the colonists.\r\nIn the first year of the settlement he had sent out supplies of food,\r\nclothing, implements, arms, and ammunition; a store-house had been\r\nerected; and this continued during these years to be supplied with what\r\nwas needed. It was the Governor's duty to regulate the distribution of\r\nthese stores and to keep account of them as advances to the several\r\nsettlers, and of the interest charged upon such advances. Whilst the\r\nstore was a boon, even a necessity, to the settlers, it was also an\r\ninstrument of oppression. Alexander Macdonell was called \"Gouverneur\r\nSauterelle\" (\"Grasshopper Governor\"), the significant statement being\r\nmade by Ross \"that he was so nicknamed because he proved as great a\r\ndestroyer within doors as the grasshoppers in the fields.\" He seems,\r\nmoreover, to have been an extravagant official, being surrounded by\r\na coterie of kindred spirits, who lived in \"one prolonged scene of\r\ndebauchery.\"\r\n\r\nWith the departure of the grasshoppers from the country departed also\r\nthe unpopular and unfaithful Governor. It was only on the visit of Mr.\r\nHalkett, one of Lord Selkirk's executors, that Macdonell's course of\r\n\"false entries, erroneous statements, and over-charges\" was discovered,\r\nand the accounts of the settlers adjusted to give them their rights. The\r\ndisgraceful reign of Governor Macdonell was brought to a close none too\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of Governor Macdonell's rule a number of important\r\nevents had taken place. The union of the two rival Companies was\r\naccomplished. Clergy, both Roman Catholic and of the Church of England,\r\nhad arrived in the colony. A farm had been begun by the Colony officers\r\non the banks of the Assiniboine, and the name of Hayfield Farm was borne\r\nby it. Perhaps the most notable event was the arrival at Red River of a\r\nnumber of Swiss settlers. These were brought out by Colonel May, late of\r\nthe De Watteville regiment. A native of Berne, he had come to Canada,\r\nbut not to Red River.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss were in many ways an element of interest. Crossing the ocean\r\nby Hudson's Bay Company's ships they arrived at York Factory in August,\r\n1821, and were borne in the Company's York boats to their destination.\r\nGathered, as they had been, from the towns and villages of Switzerland,\r\nand being chiefly \"watch and clock makers, pastry cooks, and musicians,\"\r\nthey were ill-suited for such a new settlement as that of Red River,\r\nwhere they must become agriculturists. They seem to have been honest and\r\norderly people, though very poor.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the De Meurons had come as soldiers; they\r\nwere chiefly, therefore, unmarried men. The arrival of the Swiss, with\r\ntheir handsome sons and daughters, produced a flutter of excitement\r\nin the wifeless De Meuron cabins along German Creek. The result is\r\ndescribed in the words of a most trustworthy eye-witness of what took\r\nplace: \"No sooner had the Swiss emigrants arrived than many of the\r\nGermans, who had come to the settlement a few years ago from Canada and\r\nhad houses, presented themselves in search of a wife, and having fixed\r\ntheir attachment with acceptance, they received those families in which\r\nwas their choice into their habitations. Those who had no daughters\r\nto afford this introduction were obliged to pitch their tents along\r\nthe banks of the river and outside the stockades of the fort, till\r\nthey removed to Pembina in the better prospects of provisions for the\r\nwinter.\" The whole affair was a repetition of the old Sabine story.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these De Meurons and Swiss, it may be interesting to\r\nmention a remarkable parchment agreement which the writer has perused.\r\nIt is eleven feet long, and one and a half feet wide, containing the\r\nsignatures of forty-nine settlers, of which twenty-five are those of De\r\nMeurons or Swiss, the remainder being of Highlanders and Norwegians.\r\nAmong these names are Bender, Lubrevo, Quiluby, Bendowitz, Kralic,\r\nWassloisky, Joli, Jankosky, Wachter, Lassota, Laidece, Warcklur, Krusel,\r\nJolicoeur, Maquet, and Lalonde.\r\n\r\nThis agreement binds the Earl of Selkirk or his agents not to engage\r\nin the sale of spirituous liquors or the fur trade, but to provide\r\nfacilities for transport of goods from and into the country, and at\r\nmoderate rates. The settlers are bound to keep up roads, to support\r\na clergyman, and to provide for defence. The document is not only a\r\ncuriosity, but historically valuable. There is no date upon it, but the\r\ndate is fixed by the signatures, viz. \"for the Buffalo Wool Company,\r\nJohn Pritchard.\" That Company, we know, began, and as we shall see\r\nafterwards, failed in the years 1821 and 1822. This, accordingly, is the\r\ndate of the document marking the era of the fusion of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany and the Nor'-Westers.\r\n\r\nThe De Meurons and Swiss never took kindly to Red River. So early as\r\n1822, after wintering at Pembina, a number of them, instead of turning\r\ntheir faces toward Fort Garry, went up the Red River into Minnesota,\r\nand took up farms where St. Paul now stands, on the Mississippi. They\r\nwere the first settlers there. Among their names are those of Garvas,\r\nPierrie, Louis Massey, and that of Perry, men who became very rich in\r\nherds in the early days of Minnesota.\r\n\r\nOn the removal of Governor Macdonell, Captain A. Bulger was, in June,\r\n1822, installed as Governor of Assiniboia. His rule only lasted one year\r\nand proved troublous, though he was a high-minded and capable official.\r\nThere lies before the writer, \"Papers Referring to Red River,\"\r\nconsisting chiefly of a long letter published by the Captain in India,\r\nwritten in 1822 to Andrew Colville, one of the executors of Lord Selkirk.\r\n\r\nOne of his chief troubles was the opposition given him by the Hudson's\r\nBay Company officer Clarke, who was in charge of their establishment\r\nat the Forks. Every effort was put forth by Clarke to make Bulger's\r\nposition uncomfortable, and the opposition drove the Captain away.\r\n\r\nBulger also had a worrying experience with Peguis, the chief of the\r\nIndians on the Lower Red River. Though Peguis and the other chiefs had\r\nmade a treaty with Lord Selkirk and ceded certain lands to his Lordship,\r\nthey now, with the fickleness of children, repented of their bargain and\r\nsought additional payment for the concession. Bulger's military manner,\r\nhowever, overcame the chief, and twenty-five lashes administered to an\r\nIndian who had attempted violence had a sobering effect upon the Red man.\r\n\r\nGovernor Bulger expresses himself very freely on the character of the De\r\nMeuron settlers. He says: \"It is quite absurd to suppose they will ever\r\nprove peaceable and industrious settlers. The only charm that Red River\r\npossesses in their eyes, and, I may say, in the eyes of almost all the\r\nsettlers, is the colony stores. Their demands are insatiable, and when\r\nrefused, their insolence extreme. United as they are among themselves,\r\nand ferocious in their dispositions, nothing can be done against them.\"\r\nIt is but fair, however, to state that the Captain had a low opinion\r\nboth of the Hudson's Bay Company's officers and of the French Canadian\r\nfreemen.\r\n\r\nGovernor Bulger, on retiring, made the following suggestions, which show\r\nthe evils which he thought needed a remedy, viz. \"to get courts and\r\nmagistrates nominated by the King; to get a company of troops sent out\r\nto support the magistrates and keep the natives in order; to circulate\r\nmoney; to find a market for the surplus grain; to let it be determined\r\nwhether the council at York Factory are justified in preventing the\r\nsettlers from buying moose or deer skin for clothing and provisions.\"\r\nThe Governor's closing words are, \"if these things cannot be done, it\r\nis my sincere advice to you to spend no more of Lord Selkirk's money\r\nupon Red River.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Bulger was succeeded by Robert Pelly, who was the brother of\r\nSir J. H. Pelly, the Governor of the Company in London. It seems to\r\nhave been about this time that the executors of Lord Selkirk, while\r\nnot divesting themselves of their Red River possessions, yet in order\r\nto avoid the unseemly conflicts seen in Bulger's time, entrusted the\r\nadministration of their affairs to the Company's officers at Red River.\r\nWe have seen in a former chapter the appointment of the committee to\r\nmanage these Red River affairs at Norway House council.\r\n\r\nAfter two years Pelly retired, and Donald McKenzie, a fur trader who had\r\ntaken part in the stirring events of Astoria, to which we have referred,\r\nbecame Governor.\r\n\r\nThe discontent of the settlers, and the wish to advance the colony,\r\nled the Company for a number of years after the union of the Companies\r\nto try various projects for the development of the colony. Though the\r\nrecital of these gives a melancholy picture of failure, yet it shows a\r\nheartiness and willingness on the part of the Company to do the best for\r\nthe settlers, albeit there was in every case bad management.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the union of the two fur Companies in 1821, a company\r\nto manufacture cloth from buffalo wool was started. This, of course,\r\nwas a mad scheme, but there was a clamour that work should be found\r\nfor the hungry immigrants. The Company began operations, and every one\r\nwas to become rich. $10,000 of money raised in shares was deposited\r\nin the Hudson's Bay Company's hands as the bankers of the \"Buffalo\r\nWool Company,\" machinery was obtained, and the people largely gave up\r\nagriculture to engage in killing buffalo and collecting buffalo skins.\r\nTrade was to be the philosopher's stone. In 1822 the bubble burst. It\r\ncost $12.50 to manufacture a yard of buffalo wool cloth on Red River,\r\nand the cloth only sold for $1.10 a yard in London. The Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany advanced $12,500 beyond the amount deposited, and a few years\r\nafterwards was under the necessity of forgiving the debt. The Hudson's\r\nBay Company had thus its lesson in encouraging the settlers.\r\n\r\nThe money distributed to the settlers through this Company, however,\r\nbought cattle for them, several hundred cattle having been brought from\r\nIllinois that year. A model farm for the benefit of the settlers was\r\nnext undertaken. Buildings, implements, and also a mansion, costing\r\n$3,000, for the manager, were provided. A few years of mismanagement and\r\nextravagance brought this experiment to an end also, and the founders\r\nwere $10,000 out of pocket. Such was another scheme to encourage the\r\nsettlers.\r\n\r\nDriven to another effort by the discontent of the people, Governor\r\nSimpson tried another model farm. At a fine spot on the Assiniboine,\r\nfarm dwellings, barns, yards, and stables were erected and fields\r\nenclosed, well-bred cattle were imported, also horses. The farm was well\r\nstocked with implements. Mismanagement, however, again brought its usual\r\nresult, and after six years the trial was given up, there having been a\r\nloss to the Company of $17,500.\r\n\r\nNothing daunted, the Red River settlers started the \"Assiniboine Wool\r\nCompany,\" but as it fell through upon the first demand for payment of\r\nthe stock, it hurt nobody, and ended, according to the proverb, with\r\n\"much cry and little wool.\"\r\n\r\nAnother enterprise was next begun by Governor Simpson, \"The Flax and\r\nHemp Company,\" but though the farmers grew a plentiful quantity of\r\nthese, the undertaking failed, and the crop rotted on the fields. A more\r\nlikely scheme for the encouragement of the settlers was now set on foot\r\nby the Governor, viz. a new sheep speculation. Sheep were purchased in\r\nMissouri, and after a journey of nearly fifteen hundred miles, only two\r\nhundred and fifty sheep out of the original fourteen hundred survived\r\nthe hardships of the way.\r\n\r\nA tallow company is said to have swallowed up from $3,000 to $5,000 for\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company, and a good deal of money was spent in opening\r\nup a road to Hudson Bay. Thus was enterprise after enterprise undertaken\r\nby the Company, largely for the good of the settlers. If ever an honest\r\neffort was made to advance an isolated and difficult colony, it was in\r\nthese schemes begun by the Hudson's Bay Company here.\r\n\r\nThe most startling event during the rule of Governor Mackenzie was the\r\nRed River flood in 1826. The winter of this year had been severe, and\r\na great snowfall gave promise of a wet and dangerous spring. The snow\r\nhad largely cleared away, when, early in the month of May, the waters\r\nbegan rising with surprising rapidity. The banks of the rivers were soon\r\nunable to contain the floods, and once on the prairie level the waters\r\nspread for miles east and west in a great lake. The water rose several\r\nfeet in the houses of the settlers. When the wind blew the waves dashed\r\nover the roofs. Buildings were undermined and some were floated away.\r\nThe settlers were compelled to leave their homes, and took flight to\r\nthe heights of Stony Mountain, Little Mountain, Bird's Hill, and other\r\nelevations. For weeks the flood continued, but at last, on its receding,\r\nthe homeless settlers returned to their battered and damaged houses,\r\nmuch disheartened. The crops, however, were sown, though late, and a\r\nfair harvest was gathered in that unpromising year.\r\n\r\nThe flood was the last straw that broke the back of the endurance of De\r\nMeurons and Swiss colonists. They almost all withdrew from the country\r\nand became settlers in Minnesota and other States of the American Union.\r\nEither from pride or real dislike, the Selkirk settlers declared that\r\nthey were well rid of these discontented and turbulent foreigners.\r\n\r\nThe year of the flood seems to have introduced an era of plenty, for\r\nthe people rebuilt their houses, cultivated their fields, received full\r\nreturns for their labour, and were enabled to pay off their debts and\r\nimprove their buildings. During Governor McKenzie's régime at the time\r\nof the flood, the population of the Red River settlement had reached\r\nfifteen hundred.\r\n\r\nAfter this, though the colony lost by desertions, as we have seen, yet\r\nit continued to gain by the addition of retiring Hudson's Bay Company\r\nofficers and servants, who took up land as allowed by the Company in\r\nstrips along the river after the Lower Canadian fashion, for which\r\nthey paid small sums. There were in many cases no deeds, simply the\r\nregistration of the name in the Company's register. A man sold his lot\r\nfor a horse, and it was a matter of chance whether the registration\r\nof the change in the lot took place or not. This was certainly a mode\r\nof transferring land free enough to suit an English Radical or even\r\nHenry George. The land reached as far out from the river as could be\r\nseen by looking under a horse, say two miles, and back of this was the\r\nlimitless prairie, which became a species of common where all could cut\r\nhay and where herds could run unconfined. Wood, water, and hay were the\r\nnecessaries of a Red River settler's life; to cut poplar rails for his\r\nfences in spring and burn the dried rails in the following winter was\r\nquite the authorized thing. There was no inducement to grow surplus\r\ngrain, as each settler could only get a market for eight bushels of\r\nwheat from the Hudson's Bay Company. It could not be exported. Pemmican\r\nfrom the plains was easy to get; the habits of the people were simple;\r\ntheir wants were few; and while the condition of Red River settlement\r\nwas far from being that of an Arcadia, want was absent and the people\r\nwere becoming satisfied.\r\n\r\nTo Governor McKenzie, who ruled well for eight years, credit is due\r\nlargely for the peace and progress of the period. Alexander Ross, who\r\ncame from the Rocky Mountains to Red River in 1825, is the chronicler\r\nof this period, and it is with amusement we read his gleeful account\r\nof the erection of the first stone building, small though it was, on\r\nthe banks of Red River. Lime had been burnt from the limestone, found\r\nabundantly along the lower part of the Red River, during the time of\r\nGovernor Bulger. It was in 1830 that the Hudson's Bay Company built a\r\nsmall powder magazine of stone, near Fort Garry. This was the beginning\r\nof solid architecture in the settlement.\r\n\r\nIn the following year the Hudson's Bay Company, evidently encouraged\r\nby the thrift and contentment of the people, began the erection of a\r\nvery notable and important group of buildings some nineteen miles down\r\nthe river from the forks. This was called Lower Fort Garry. It was\r\nbuilt on the solid rock, and was, and is to this day, surrounded by a\r\nmassive stone wall. Various reasons have been advanced for the building\r\nof this, the first permanent fort so far from the old centre of trade,\r\nand of the old associations at the \"forks.\" Some have said it was done\r\nto place it among the English people, as the French settlers were\r\nbecoming turbulent; some that it was at the head of navigation from Lake\r\nWinnipeg, being north of the St. Andrew's rapids; and some maintained\r\nthat the site was chosen as having been far above the high water during\r\nthe year of flood, when Fort Douglas and Upper Fort Garry had been\r\nsurrounded. The motive will probably never be known; but for a time it\r\nwas the residence of the Governor of Rupert's Land when he was in the\r\ncountry, and was the seat of government. Four years afterwards, when\r\nAlexander Christie had replaced Mr. Donald McKenzie as local governor,\r\nFort Garry or Upper Fort Garry was begun in 1835 at the forks, but on\r\nhigher ground than the original Fort Garry of 1821, which had been\r\nerected after the union of the Companies.\r\n\r\nThis fort continued the centre of business, government, education, and\r\npublic affairs for more than three decades and was the nucleus of the\r\nCity of Winnipeg. Sold in the year 1882, the fort was demolished, and\r\nthe front gate, now owned by the city, is all that remains of this\r\nhistoric group of buildings. The destruction of the fort was an act\r\nof vandalism, reflecting on the sordid man who purchased it from the\r\nHudson's Bay Company.\r\n\r\nIn Governor Christie's time the necessity was recognized of having a\r\nform of government somewhat less patriarchal than the individual rule\r\nof the local governor had been. Accordingly, the Council of Assiniboia\r\nwas appointed by the Hudson's Bay Company, the president being Sir\r\nGeorge Simpson, the Governor of Rupert's Land, and with him fourteen\r\ncouncillors. It may be of interest to give the names of the members\r\nof this first Council. Besides the president there were: Alexander\r\nChristie, Governor of the Colony; Rev. D. T. Jones, Chaplain H. B. C.;\r\nRight Rev. Bishop Provencher; Rev. William Cochrane, Assistant Chaplain;\r\nJames Bird, formerly Chief Factor, H. B. C.; James Sutherland, Esq.; W.\r\nH. Cook, Esq.; John Pritchard, Esq.; Robert Logan, Esq.; Sheriff Alex.\r\nRoss; John McCallum, Coroner; John Bunn, Medical Adviser; Cuthbert\r\nGrant, Esq., Warden of the Plains; Andrew McDermott, Merchant.\r\n\r\nIt is generally conceded, however, that the Council did not satisfy the\r\npublic aspirations. The president and councillors were all declared\r\neither sinecurists or paid servants of the Company. The mass of the\r\npeople complained at not being represented. It was, however, a step very\r\nmuch in advance of what had been, although there was a suspicion in\r\nthe public mind that it had something of the form of popular government\r\nwithout the substance.\r\n\r\nAt the first meeting of the Council a number of measures were passed.\r\nTo preserve order a volunteer corps of sixty men was organized, with\r\na small annual allowance per man. Of this body, Sheriff Ross was\r\ncommander. The settlement was divided into four districts, over each of\r\nwhich a Justice of the Peace was appointed, who held quarterly courts\r\nin their several jurisdictions. At this court small actions only were\r\ntried, and the presiding magistrate was allowed to refer any case of\r\nexceptional difficulty to the court of Governor and Council. This\r\nhigher court sat quarterly also. In larger civil cases and in criminal\r\ncases the law required a jury to be called. A jail and court-house were\r\nerected outside the walls of Fort Garry. To meet the expense involved\r\nunder the new institutions a tax of 7-1/2 per cent. duty was levied\r\non imports and a like duty on exports. The Hudson's Bay Company also\r\nagreed to contribute three hundred pounds a year in aid of public works\r\nthroughout the settlement.\r\n\r\nThe year 1839 was notable in the history of the colony. A new Governor,\r\nDuncan Finlayson, was appointed, and steps were taken also to improve\r\nthe judicial system which had been introduced. An appointment was made\r\nof the first recorder for Red River settlement. The new appointee was\r\na young Scottish lawyer from Montreal, named Adam Thom. He had been\r\na journalist in Montreal, was of an ardent and somewhat aggressive\r\ndisposition, but was a man of ability and broad reading. Judge Thom\r\nwas, however, a Company officer, and as such there was an antecedent\r\nsuspicion of him in the public mind. It was pointed out that he was not\r\nindependent, receiving his appointment and his salary of seven hundred\r\npounds from the Company. In Montreal he had been known as a determined\r\nloyalist in the late Papineau rebellion, and the French people regarded\r\nhim as hostile to their race.\r\n\r\nThe population of the settlement continued to increase. In the last year\r\nof Governor Finlayson's rule, twenty families of Lincolnshire farmers\r\nand labourers came to the country to assist with their knowledge of\r\nagriculture. After five years' rule Governor Finlayson retired from\r\noffice, and was succeeded for a short time by his old predecessor, Mr.\r\nAlexander Christie.\r\n\r\nA serious epidemic visited the Red River in the year 1846. Ross\r\ndescribes it in the following graphic way: \"In January the influenza\r\nraged, and in May the measles broke out; but neither of these\r\nvisitations proved fatal. At length in June a bloody flux began its\r\nravages first among the Indians, and others among the whites; like the\r\ngreat cry in Egypt, 'There was not a house where there was not one\r\ndead,' On Red River there was not a smiling face on 'a summer's day.'\r\nFrom June 18th to August 2nd, the deaths averaged seven a day, or three\r\nhundred and twenty-one in all, being one out of every sixteen of our\r\npopulation. Of these one-sixth were Indians, two-thirds half-breeds, and\r\nthe remainder white. On one occasion thirteen burials were proceeding at\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this year also the Oregon question, with which we shall\r\nafterwards deal, threatened war between Great Britain and the United\r\nStates. The policy of the British Government is, on the first appearance\r\nof trouble, to prepare for hostilities. Accordingly the 6th Royal\r\nRegiment of Foot, with sappers and artillery, in all five hundred\r\nstrong, was hurried out under Colonel Crofton to defend the colony.\r\nColonel Crofton took the place of Alexander Christie as Governor. The\r\naddition of this body of military to the colony gave picturesqueness to\r\nthe hitherto monotonous life of Red River. A market for produce and the\r\ncirculation of a large sum of money marked their stay on Red River. The\r\nturbulent spirits who had made much trouble were now silenced, or betook\r\nthemselves to a safe place across the boundary line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIES: SLEDGE, KEEL, WHEEL, CAYUSE, CHASE.\r\n\r\n     A picturesque life--The prairie hunters and traders--Gaily\r\n     caparisoned dog trains--The great winter packets--Joy in the\r\n     lonely forts--The summer trade--The York boat brigade--Expert\r\n     voyageurs--The famous Red River cart--Shagganappe ponies--The\r\n     screeching train--Tripping--The western cayuse--The great buffalo\r\n     hunt--Warden of the plains--Pemmican and fat--the return in triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great prairies of Rupert's Land and their intersecting rivers\r\nafforded the means for the unique and picturesque life of the prairie\r\nhunters and traders. The frozen, snowy plains and lakes were crossed in\r\nwinter by the serviceable sledge drawn by Eskimo dogs, familiarly called\r\n\"Eskies\" or \"Huskies.\" When summer had come, the lakes and rivers of the\r\nprairies, formerly skimmed by canoes, during the fifty years from the\r\nunion of the Companies till the transfer of Rupert's Land to Canada,\r\nwere for freight and even rapid transit crossed and followed by York and\r\nother boats. The transport of furs and other freight across the prairies\r\nwas accomplished by the use of carts--entirely of wood--drawn by Indian\r\nponies, or by oxen in harness, while the most picturesque feature of the\r\nprairie life of Red River was the departure of the brigade of carts with\r\nthe hunters and their families on a great expedition for the exciting\r\nchase of the buffalo. These salient points of the prairie life of the\r\nlast half-century of fur-trading life we may with profit depict.\r\n\r\n\r\nSLEDGE AND PACKET.\r\n\r\nUnder the régime established by Governor Simpson, the communication with\r\nthe interior was reduced to a system. The great winter event at Red\r\nRiver was the leaving of the North-West packet about December 10th. By\r\nthis agency every post in the northern department was reached. Sledges\r\nand snow-shoes were the means by which this was accomplished. The sledge\r\nor toboggan was drawn by three or four \"Huskies,\" gaily comparisoned;\r\nand with these neatly harnessed dogs covered with bells, the traveller\r\nor the load of valuables was hurried across the pathless snowy wastes\r\nof the plains or over the ice of the frozen lakes and rivers. The dogs\r\ncarried their freight of fish on which they lived, each being fed only\r\nat the close of his day's work, and his allowance one fish.\r\n\r\nThe winter packet was almost entirely confined to the transport of\r\nletters and a few newspapers. During Sir George Simpson's time an annual\r\nfile of the _Montreal Gazette_ was sent to each post, and to some of\r\nthe larger places came a year's file of the London _Times_. A box was\r\nfastened on the back part of the sledge, and this was packed with the\r\nimportant missives so prized when the journey was ended.\r\n\r\nGoing at the rate of forty or more miles a day with the precious\r\nfreight, the party with their sledges camped in the shelter of a\r\nclump of trees or bushes, and built their camp fire; then each in his\r\nblankets, often joined by the favourite dog as a companion for heat,\r\nsought rest on the couch of spruce or willow boughs for the night with\r\nthe thermometer often at 30 deg. or 40 deg. below zero F.\r\n\r\nThe winter packet ran from Fort Garry to Norway House, a distance of\r\n350 miles. At this point the packet was all rearranged, a part of the\r\nfreight being carried eastward to Hudson Bay, the other portion up the\r\nSaskatchewan to the western and northern forts. The party which had\r\ntaken the packet to Norway House, at that point received the packages\r\nfrom Hudson Bay and with them returned to Fort Garry. The western mail\r\nfrom Norway House was taken by another sledge party up the Saskatchewan\r\nRiver, and leaving parcels at posts along the route, reached its\r\nrendezvous at Carlton House. The return party from that point received\r\nthe mail from the North, and hastened to Fort Garry by way of Swan River\r\ndistrict, distributing its treasures to the posts it passed and reaching\r\nFort Garry usually about the end of February.\r\n\r\nAt Carlton a party of runners from Edmonton and the Upper Saskatchewan\r\nmade rendezvous, deposited their packages, received the outgoing mail,\r\nand returned to their homes. Some of the matter collected from the Upper\r\nSaskatchewan and that brought, as we have seen, by the inland packet\r\nfrom Fort Garry was taken by a new set of runners to Mackenzie River,\r\nand Athabasca. Thus at Carlton there met three parties, viz. from Fort\r\nGarry, Edmonton, and Athabasca. Each brought a packet and received\r\nanother back in return. The return packet from Carlton to Fort Garry,\r\narriving in February, took up the accumulated material, went with it\r\nto Norway House, the place whence they had started in December, thus\r\ncarrying the \"Red River spring packet,\" and at Norway House it was met\r\nby another express, known as the \"York Factory spring packet,\" which\r\nhad just arrived. The runners on these various packets underwent great\r\nexposure, but they were fleet and athletic and knew how to act to the\r\nbest advantage in storm and danger. They added a picturesque interest to\r\nthe lonely life of the ice-bound post as they arrived at it, delivered\r\ntheir message, and again departed.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEL AND CANOE.\r\n\r\nThe transition from winter to spring is a very rapid one on the plains\r\nof Rupert's Land. The ice upon the rivers and lakes becomes honey-combed\r\nand disappears very soon. The rebound from the icy torpor of winter\r\nto the active life of the season that combines spring and summer is\r\nmarvellous. No sooner were the waterways open in the fur-trading days\r\nthan freight was hurried from one part of the country to another by\r\nmeans of inland or York boats.\r\n\r\nThese boats, it will be remembered, were introduced by Governor Simpson,\r\nwho found them more safe and economical than the canoe generally in use\r\nbefore his time.\r\n\r\nEach of these boats could carry three or four tons of freight, and was\r\nmanned by nine men, one of them being steersman, the remainder, men for\r\nthe oar. Four to eight of these craft made up a brigade, and the skill\r\nand rapidity with which these boats could be loaded or unloaded, carried\r\npast a portage or décharge, guided through rapids or over considerable\r\nstretches of the lakes, was the pride of their Indian or half-breed\r\ntripsmen, as they were called, or the admiration of the officers dashing\r\npast them in their speedy canoes.\r\n\r\nThe route from York Factory to Fort Garry being a long and continuous\r\nwaterway, was a favourite course for the York boat brigade. Many of the\r\nsettlers of the Red River settlement became well-to-do by commanding\r\nbrigades of boats and carrying freight for the Company. In the earlier\r\ndays of Governor Simpson the great part of the furs from the interior\r\nwere carried to Fort Garry or the Grand Portage, at the mouth of the\r\nSaskatchewan, and thence past Norway House to Hudson Bay. From York\r\nFactory a load of general merchandise was brought back, which had been\r\ncargo in the Company's ship from the Thames to York. Lake Winnipeg is\r\ngenerally clear of ice early in June, and the first brigade would then\r\nstart with its seven or eight boats laden to the gunwales with furs; a\r\nweek after, the second brigade was under way, and thus, at intervals to\r\nkeep clear of each other in crossing the portages, the catch of the past\r\nseason was carried out. The return with full supplies for the settlers\r\nwas earnestly looked for, and the voyage both ways, including stoppages,\r\ntook some nine weeks.\r\n\r\nFar up into the interior the goods in bales were taken. One of the best\r\nknown routes was that of what was called, \"The Portage Brigade.\" This\r\nran from Lake Winnipeg up the Saskatchewan northward, past Cumberland\r\nHouse and Ile à la Crosse to Methy Portage, otherwise known as Portage\r\nla Loche, where the waters part, on one side going to Hudson's Bay,\r\non the other flowing to the Arctic Sea. The trip made from Fort Garry\r\nto Portage la Loche and return occupied about four months. At Portage\r\nla Loche the brigade from the Mackenzie River arrived in time to meet\r\nthat from the south, and was itself soon in motion, carrying its year's\r\nsupply of trading articles for the Far North, not even leaving out\r\nPeel's River and the Yukon.\r\n\r\nThe frequent transhipments required in these long and dangerous routes\r\nled to the secure packing of bales, of about one hundred pounds each,\r\neach of them being called an \"inland piece.\" Seventy-five made up the\r\ncargo of a York boat. The skill with which these boats could be laden\r\nwas surprising. A good half-breed crew of nine men was able to load a\r\nboat and pack the pieces securely in five minutes.\r\n\r\nThe boat's crew was under the command of the steersman, who sat on a\r\nraised platform in the stern of the boat. At the portages it was the\r\npart of the steersman to raise each piece from the ground and place\r\ntwo of them on the back of each tripsman, to be held in place by the\r\n\"portage strap\" on the forehead. It will be seen that the position\r\nof the captain was no sinecure. One of the eight tripsmen was known\r\nas \"bowman.\" In running rapids he stood at the bow, and with a light\r\npole directed the boat, giving information by word and sign to the\r\nsteersman. The position of less responsibility though great toil was\r\nthat of the \"middlemen,\" or rowers. When a breeze blew, a sail hoisted\r\nin the boat lightened their labours. The captain or steersman of each\r\nboat was responsible to the \"guide,\" who, as a commander of the brigade,\r\nwas a man of much experience, and consequently held a position of some\r\nimportance. Such were the means of transport over the vast water system\r\nof Rupert's Land up to the year 1869, although some years before that\r\ntime transport by land to St. Paul in Minnesota had reached large\r\nproportions. Since the date named, railway and steamboat have directed\r\ntrade into new channels, for even Mackenzie River now has a Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany steamboat.\r\n\r\n\r\nCART AND CAYUSE.\r\n\r\nThe lakes and rivers were not sufficient to carry on the trade of the\r\ncountry. Accordingly, land transport became a necessity. If the Ojibway\r\nIndians found the birch bark canoe and the snow-shoe so useful that they\r\nassigned their origin to the Manitou, then certainly it was a happy\r\nthought when the famous Red River cart was similarly evolved. These\r\ntwo-wheeled vehicles are entirely of wood, without any iron whatever.\r\n\r\nThe wheels are large, being five feet in diameter, and are three inches\r\nthick. The felloes are fastened to one another by tongues of wood, and\r\npressure in revolving keeps them from falling apart. The hubs are thick\r\nand very strong. The axles are wood alone, and even the lynch pins are\r\nwooden. A light box frame, tightened by wooden pegs, is fastened by the\r\nsame agency and poised upon the axle. The price of a cart in Red River\r\nof old was two pounds.\r\n\r\nThe harness for the horse which drew the cart was made of roughly-tanned\r\nox hide, which was locally known as \"shagganappe.\" The name\r\n\"shagganappe\" has in later years been transferred to the small-sized\r\nhorse used, which is thus called a \"shagganappe pony.\"\r\n\r\nThe carts were drawn by single ponies, or in some cases by stalwart\r\noxen. These oxen were harnessed and wore a collar, not the barbarous\r\nyoke which the ox has borne from time immemorial. The ox in harness has\r\na swing of majesty as he goes upon his journey. The Indian pony, with\r\na load of four or five hundred pounds in a cart behind him, will go at\r\na measured jog-trot fifty or sixty miles a day. Heavy freighting carts\r\nmade a journey of about twenty miles a day, the load being about eight\r\nhundred pounds.\r\n\r\nA train of carts of great length was sometimes made to go upon some\r\nlong expedition, or for protection from the thievish or hostile bands\r\nof Indians. A brigade consisted of ten carts, under the charge of three\r\nmen. Five or six more brigades were joined in one train, and this was\r\nplaced under the charge of a guide, who was vested with much authority.\r\nHe rode on horseback forward, marshalling his forces, including the\r\nmanagement of the spare horses or oxen, which often amounted to twenty\r\nper cent. of the number of those drawing the carts. The stopping-places,\r\nchosen for good grass and a plentiful supply of water, the time\r\nof halting, the management of brigades, and all the details of a\r\nconsiderable camp were under the care of this officer-in-chief.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable cart trails and freighting roads on the prairies\r\nwas that from Fort Garry to St. Paul, Minnesota. This was an excellent\r\nroad, on the west side of the Red River, through Dakota territory\r\nfor some two hundred miles, and then, by crossing the Red River into\r\nMinnesota, the road led for two hundred and fifty miles down to St.\r\nPaul. The writer, who came shortly after the close of the fifty years\r\nwe are describing, can testify to the excellence of this road over the\r\nlevel prairies. At the period when the Sioux Indians were in revolt and\r\nthe massacre of the whites took place in 1862, this route was dangerous,\r\nand the road, though not so smooth and not so dry, was followed on the\r\neast side of the Red River.\r\n\r\nEvery season about three hundred carts, employing one hundred men,\r\ndeparted from Fort Garry to go upon the \"tip,\" as it was called, to\r\nSt. Paul, or in later times to St. Cloud, when the railway had reached\r\nthat place. The visit of this band coming from the north, with their\r\nwooden carts, \"shagganappe\" ponies, and harnessed oxen, bringing huge\r\nbales of precious furs, awakened great interest in St. Paul. The late\r\nJ. W. Taylor, who for about a quarter of a century held the position of\r\nAmerican Consul at Winnipeg, and who, on account of his interest in the\r\nNorth-West prairies, bore the name of \"Saskatchewan Taylor,\" was wont\r\nto describe most graphically the advent, as he saw it, of this strange\r\nexpedition, coming, like a Midianitish caravan in the East, to trade at\r\nthe central mart. On Sundays they encamped near St. Paul. There was the\r\ngreatest decorum and order in camp; their religious demeanour, their\r\nhonest and well-to-do appearance, and their peaceful disposition were\r\nan oasis in the desert of the wild and reckless inhabitants of early\r\nMinnesota.\r\n\r\nAnother notable route for carts was that westward from Fort Garry by way\r\nof Fort Ellice to Carlton House, a distance of some five hundred miles.\r\nIt will be remembered that it was by this route that Governor Simpson in\r\nearly days, Palliser, Milton, and Cheadle found their way to the West.\r\nIn later days the route was extended to Edmonton House, a thousand miles\r\nin all. It was a whole summer's work to make the trip to Edmonton and\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nOn the Hudson's Bay Company reserve of five hundred acres around Fort\r\nGarry was a wide camping-ground for the \"trippers\" and traders. Day\r\nafter day was fixed for the departure, but still the traders lingered.\r\nAfter much leave-taking, the great train started. It was a sight to be\r\nremembered. The gaily-caparisoned horses, the hasty farewells, the hurry\r\nof women and children, the multitude of dogs, the balky horses, the\r\nsubduing and harnessing and attaching of the restless ponies, all made\r\nit a picturesque day.\r\n\r\nThe train in motion appealed not only to the eye, but to the ear as\r\nwell, the wooden axles creaked, and the creaking of a train with every\r\ncart contributing its dismal share, could be heard more than a mile\r\naway. In the Far-West the early traders used the cayuse, or Indian\r\npony, and \"travoie,\" for transporting burdens long distances. The\r\n\"travoie\" consisted of two stout poles fastened together over the back\r\nof the horse, and dragging their lower ends upon the ground. Great\r\nloads--almost inconceivable, indeed--were thus carried across the\r\npathless prairies. The Red River cart and the Indian cayuse were the\r\nproduct of the needs of the prairies.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAIN HUNTERS AND THE BUFFALO.\r\n\r\nA generation had passed since the founding of the Selkirk settlement,\r\nand the little handful of Scottish settlers had become a community of\r\nfive thousand. This growth had not been brought about by immigration,\r\nnor by natural increase, but by what may be called a process of\r\naccretion. Throughout the whole of Rupert's Land and adjoining\r\nterritories the employés of the Company, whether from Lower Canada or\r\nfrom the Orkney Islands, as well as the clerks and officers of the\r\ncountry, had intermarried with the Indian women of the tribes.\r\n\r\nWhen the trader or Company's servant had gained a competence suited to\r\nhis ideas, he thought it right to retire from the active fur trade and\r\nfloat down the rivers to the settlement, which the first Governor of\r\nManitoba called the \"Paradise of Red River.\" Here the hunter or officer\r\nprocured a strip of land from the Company, on it erected a house for\r\nthe shelter of his \"dusky race,\" and engaged in agriculture, though\r\nhis former life largely unfitted him for this occupation. In this way,\r\nfour-fifths of the population of the settlement were half-breeds, with\r\ntheir own traditions, sensibilities, and prejudices--the one part of\r\nthem speaking French with a dash of Cree mixed with it, the other\r\nEnglish which, too, had the form of a Red River patois.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that tripping and hunting gave a livelihood to some, if not\r\nthe great majority, but these occupations unfitted men for following the\r\nplough. In addition there was no market for produce, so that agriculture\r\ndid not in general thrive. One of the favourite features of Red River,\r\nwhich fitted in thoroughly with the roving traditions of the large part\r\nof the population, was the annual buffalo hunt, which, for those who\r\nengaged in it, occupied a great portion of the summer.\r\n\r\nWe have the personal reminiscences of the hunt by Alexander Ross,\r\nsometime sheriff of Assiniboia, which, as being lively and graphic, are\r\nworthy of being reproduced.\r\n\r\nRoss says: \"Buffalo hunting here, like bear baiting in India, has become\r\na popular and favourite amusement among all classes; and Red River,\r\nin consequence, has been brought into some degree of notice by the\r\npresence of strangers from foreign countries. We are now occasionally\r\nvisited by men of science as well as men of pleasure. The war road of\r\nthe savage and the solitary haunt of the bear have of late been resorted\r\nto by the florist, the botanist, and the geologist; nor is it uncommon\r\nnowadays to see officers of the Guards, knights, baronets, and some of\r\nthe higher nobility of England and other countries coursing their steeds\r\nover the boundless plains and enjoying the pleasures of the chase among\r\nthe half-breeds and savages of the country. Distinction of rank is, of\r\ncourse, out of the question, and at the close of the adventurous day\r\nall squat down in merry mood together, enjoying the social freedom of\r\nequality round Nature's table and the novel treat of a fresh buffalo\r\nsteak served up in the style of the country, that is to say, roasted on\r\na forked stick before the fire; a keen appetite their only sauce, cold\r\nwater their only beverage. Looking at this assemblage through the medium\r\nof the imagination, the mind is led back to the chivalric period of\r\nformer days, when chiefs and vassals took counsel together....\r\n\r\n\"With the earliest dawn of spring the hunters are in motion like bees,\r\nand the colony in a state of confusion, from their going to and fro,\r\nin order to raise the wind and prepare themselves for the fascinating\r\nenjoyments of hunting. It is now that the Company, the farmers, the\r\npetty traders are all beset by their incessant and irresistible\r\nimportunities. The plain mania brings everything else to a stand. One\r\nwants a horse, another an axe, a third a cart; they want ammunition,\r\nthey want clothing, they want provisions; and though people refuse\r\none or two they cannot deny a whole population, for, indeed, over-much\r\nobstinacy would not be unattended with risk. Thus the settlers are\r\nreluctantly dragged into profligate speculation.\r\n\r\n\"The plain hunters, finding they can get whatever they want without\r\nready money, are led into ruinous extravagances; but the evil of the\r\nlong credit system does not end here.... So many temptations, so many\r\nattractions are held out to the thoughtless and giddy, so fascinating is\r\nthe sweet air of freedom, that even the offspring of the Europeans, as\r\nwell as natives, are often induced to cast off their habits of industry\r\nand leave their comfortable homes to try their fortunes in the plains.\r\n\r\n\"The practical result of all this may be stated in a few words. After\r\nthe expedition starts there is not a man-servant or maid-servant to\r\nbe found in the colony. At any season but seed-time and harvest-time,\r\nthe settlement is literally swarming with idlers; but at these urgent\r\nperiods money cannot procure them.\r\n\r\n\"The actual money value expended on one trip, estimating also their lost\r\ntime, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  1210 carts (in 1840)                                       £1815\r\n   620 hunters (two months) at 1_s._ a day                    1860\r\n   650 women (two months) at 9_d._                            1460\r\n   360 boys and girls (two months) at 4_d._                    360\r\n   403 buffalo runners (horses) at 15_l._                     6045\r\n   655 cart horses at 8_l._                                   5240\r\n   586 draught oxen at 6_l._                                  3516\r\n  Guns, gunpowder, knives, axes, harness, camp equipage,\r\n      and utensils (estimate approaching)                     3700\r\n                                                             -----\r\n                                                       Say £24,000\r\n\r\n\"From Fort Garry, June 15th, 1840, the cavalcade and followers went\r\ncrowding on to the public road, and thence, stretching from point to\r\npoint, till the third day in the evening, when they reached Pembina\r\n(sixty miles south of Fort Garry), the great rendezvous on such\r\noccasions. When the hunters leave the settlement it enjoys that relief\r\nwhich a person feels on recovering from a long and painful sickness.\r\nHere, on a level plain, the whole patriarchal camp squatted down like\r\npilgrims on a journey to the Holy Land in ancient days, only not\r\nquite so devout, for neither scrip nor staff were consecrated for\r\nthe occasion. Here the roll was called and general muster taken, when\r\nthey numbered on this occasion 1,630 souls; and here the rules and\r\nregulations for the journey were finally settled. The officials for the\r\ntrip were named and installed into office, and all without the aid of\r\nwriting materials.\r\n\r\n\"The camp occupied as much ground as a modern city, and was formed in\r\na circle. All the carts were placed side by side, the trams outward.\r\nWithin this line of circumvallation, the tents were placed in double,\r\ntreble rows, at one end, the animals at the other, in front of the\r\ntents. This is the order in all dangerous places, but where no danger is\r\napprehended, the animals are kept on the outside. Thus the carts formed\r\na strong barrier, not only for securing the people and their animals\r\nwithin, but as a place of shelter and defence against an attack of the\r\nenemy from without.\r\n\r\n  In 1820 the number of carts assembled for the first trip was     540\r\n  \"  1825  \"    \"    \"    \"      \"       \"   \"    \"    \"    \"      680\r\n  \"  1830  \"    \"    \"    \"      \"       \"   \"    \"    \"    \"      820\r\n  \"  1835  \"    \"    \"    \"      \"       \"   \"    \"    \"    \"      970\r\n  \"  1840  \"    \"    \"    \"      \"       \"   \"    \"    \"    \"     1210\r\n\r\n\"There is another appendage belonging to the expedition, and these are\r\nnot always the least noisy, viz. the dogs or camp followers. On the\r\npresent occasion they numbered no fewer than 542. In deep snow, where\r\nhorses cannot conveniently be used, dogs are very serviceable animals to\r\nthe hunters in these parts. The half-breed, dressed in his wolf costume,\r\ntackles two or three sturdy curs into a flat sled, throws himself on it\r\nat full length, and gets among the buffalo unperceived. Here the bow\r\nand arrow play their part to prevent noise. And here the skilful hunter\r\nkills as many as he pleases, and returns to camp without disturbing the\r\nband.\r\n\r\n\"But now to the camp again--the largest of the kind, perhaps, in the\r\nworld. The first step was to hold a council for the nomination of chiefs\r\nor officers for conducting the expedition. Ten captains were named,\r\nthe senior on this occasion being Jean Baptiste Wilkie, an English\r\nhalf-breed, brought up among the French, a man of good sound sense and\r\nlong experience, and withal a fine, bold-looking, and discreet fellow, a\r\nsecond Nimrod in his way.\r\n\r\n\"Besides being captain, in common with the others, he was styled the\r\ngreat war chief or head of the camp, and on all public occasions he\r\noccupied the place of president. All articles of property found without\r\nan owner were carried to him and he disposed of them by a crier, who\r\nwent round the camp every evening, were it only an awl. Each captain had\r\nten soldiers under his orders, in much the same way as policemen are\r\nsubject to the magistrate. Ten guides were likewise appointed, and here\r\nwe may remark that people in a rude state of society, unable either to\r\nread or write, are generally partial to the number ten. Their duties\r\nwere to guide the camp each in his turn--that is day about--during\r\nthe expedition. The camp flag belongs to the guide of the day; he is\r\ntherefore standard bearer in virtue of his office.\r\n\r\n\"The hoisting of the flag every morning is the signal for raising camp.\r\nHalf an hour is the full time allowed to prepare for the march; but if\r\nanyone is sick or their animals have strayed, notice is sent to the\r\nguide, who halts till all is made right. From the time the flag is\r\nhoisted, however, till the hour of camping arrives it is never taken\r\ndown. The flag taken down is a signal for encamping. While it is up the\r\nguide is chief of the expedition. Captains are subject to him, and the\r\nsoldiers of the day are his messengers; he commands all. The moment the\r\nflag is lowered his functions cease, and the captains' and soldiers'\r\nduties commence. They point out the order of the camp, and every cart as\r\nit arrives moves to its appointed place. This business usually occupies\r\nabout the same time as raising camp in the morning; for everything moves\r\nwith the regularity of clockwork.\r\n\r\n\"All being ready to leave Pembina, the captains and other chief men\r\nhold another council and lay down the rules to be observed during the\r\nexpedition. Those made on the present occasion were:--\r\n\r\n(1) No buffalo to be run on the Sabbath day.\r\n\r\n(2) No party to fork off, lag behind, or go before, without permission.\r\n\r\n(3) No person or party to run buffalo before the general order.\r\n\r\n(4) Every captain with his men in turn to patrol the camp and keep\r\nguard.\r\n\r\n(5) For the first trespass against these laws, the offender to have his\r\nsaddle and bridle cut up.\r\n\r\n(6) For the second offence the coat to be taken off the offender's back\r\nand to be cut up.\r\n\r\n(7) For the third offence the offender to be flogged.\r\n\r\n(8) Any person convicted of theft, even to the value of a sinew, to be\r\nbrought to the middle of the camp, and the crier to call out his or her\r\nname three times, adding the word 'Thief' at each time.\r\n\r\n\"On the 21st the start was made, and the picturesque line of march soon\r\nstretched to the length of some five or six miles in the direction of\r\nsouth-west towards Côte à Pique. At 2 p.m. the flag was struck, as a\r\nsignal for resting the animals. After a short interval it was hoisted\r\nagain, and in a few minutes the whole line was in motion, and continued\r\nthe route till five or six o'clock in the evening, when the flag was\r\nhauled down as a signal to encamp for the night. Distance travelled,\r\ntwenty miles.\r\n\r\n\"The camp being formed, all the leading men, officials, and others\r\nassembled, as the general custom is, on some rising ground or eminence\r\noutside the ring, and there squatted themselves down, tailor-like, on\r\nthe grass in a sort of council, each having his gun, his smoking bag in\r\nhis hand, and his pipe in his mouth. In this situation the occurrences\r\nof the day were discussed, and the line of march for the morrow agreed\r\nupon. This little meeting was full of interest, and the fact struck me\r\nvery forcibly that there is happiness and pleasure in the society of the\r\nmost illiterate men, sympathetically if not intellectually inclined,\r\nas well as among the learned, and I must say I found less selfishness\r\nand more liberality among those ordinary men than I had been accustomed\r\nto find in higher circles. Their conversation was free, practical,\r\nand interesting, and the time passed on more agreeably than could be\r\nexpected among such people, till we touched on politics.\r\n\r\n\"Of late years the field of chase has been far from Pembina, and\r\nthe hunters do not so much as know in what direction they may find\r\nthe buffalo, as these animals frequently shift their ground. It is\r\na mere leap in the dark, whether at the outset the expedition takes\r\nthe right or the wrong road; and their luck in the chase, of course,\r\ndepends materially on the choice they make. The year of our narrative\r\nthey travelled a south-west or middle course, being the one generally\r\npreferred, since it leads past most of the rivers near their sources,\r\nwhere they are easily crossed. The only inconvenience attending this\r\nchoice is the scarcity of wood, which in a warm season is but a\r\nsecondary consideration.\r\n\r\n\"Not to dwell on the ordinary routine of each day's journey, it was the\r\nninth day from Pembina before we reached the Cheyenne River, distant\r\nonly about 150 miles, and as yet we had not seen a single band of\r\nbuffalo. On July 3rd, our nineteenth day from the settlement, and at a\r\ndistance of little more than 250 miles, we came in sight of our destined\r\nhunting grounds, and on the day following we had our first buffalo\r\nrace. Our array in the field must have been a grand and imposing one to\r\nthose who had never seen the like before. No less than 400 huntsmen,\r\nall mounted, and anxiously waiting for the word 'Start!' took up their\r\nposition in a line at one end of the camp, while Captain Wilkie, with\r\nhis spyglass at his eye, surveyed the buffalo, examined the ground, and\r\nissued his orders. At eight o'clock the whole cavalcade broke ground,\r\nand made for the buffalo; first at a slow trot, then at a gallop, and\r\nlastly at full speed. Their advance was over a dead level, the plain\r\nhaving no hollow or shelter of any kind to conceal their approach. We\r\nneed not answer any queries as to the feeling and anxiety of the camp on\r\nsuch an occasion. When the horsemen started the cattle might have been\r\na mile and a half ahead, but they had approached to within four or five\r\nhundred yards before the bulls curved their tails or pawed the ground.\r\nIn a moment more the herd took flight, and horse and rider are presently\r\nseen bursting in among them. Shots are heard, and all is smoke, dash,\r\nand hurry. The fattest are first singled out for slaughter, and in less\r\ntime than we have occupied with the description, a thousand carcases\r\nstrew the plain.\r\n\r\n\"The moment the animals take to flight the best runners dart forward in\r\nadvance. At this moment a good horse is invaluable to his owner, for\r\nout of the 400 on this occasion, not above fifty got the first chance\r\nof the fat cows. A good horse and an experienced rider will select\r\nand kill from ten to twelve animals at one heat, while inferior horses\r\nare contented with two or three. But much depends on the nature of the\r\nground. On this occasion the surface was rocky, and full of badger\r\nholes. Twenty-three horses and riders were at one moment sprawling on\r\nthe ground. One horse, gored by a bull, was killed on the spot, two men\r\ndisabled by the fall. One rider broke his shoulder blade; another burst\r\nhis gun and lost three of his fingers by the accident; and a third was\r\nstruck on the knee by an exhausted ball. These accidents will not be\r\nthought over-numerous considering the result; for in the evening no less\r\nthan 1,375 buffalo tongues were brought into camp.\r\n\r\n\"The rider of a good horse seldom fires till within three or four yards\r\nof his object, and never misses. And, what is admirable in point of\r\ntraining, the moment the shot is fired his steed springs on one side\r\nto avoid stumbling over the animal, whereas an awkward and shy horse\r\nwill not approach within ten or fifteen yards, consequently the rider\r\nhas often to fire at random and not infrequently misses. Many of them,\r\nhowever, will fire at double that distance and make sure of every shot.\r\nThe mouth is always full of balls; they load and fire at the gallop, and\r\nbut seldom drop a mark, although some do to designate the animal.\r\n\r\n\"Of all the operations which mark the hunter's life and are essential to\r\nhis ultimate success, the most perplexing, perhaps, is that of finding\r\nout and identifying the animals he kills during a race. Imagine 400\r\nhorsemen entering at full speed a herd of some thousands of buffalo,\r\nall in rapid motion. Riders in clouds of dust and volumes of smoke\r\nwhich darken the air, crossing and recrossing each other in every\r\ndirection; shots on the right, on the left, behind, before, here,\r\nthere, two, three, a dozen at a time, everywhere in close succession,\r\nat the same moment. Horses stumbling, riders falling, dead and wounded\r\nanimals tumbling here and there, one over the other; and this zigzag\r\nand bewildering _mêlée_ continued for an hour or more together in wild\r\nconfusion. And yet, from practice, so keen is the eye, so correct the\r\njudgment, that after getting to the end of the race, he can not only\r\ntell the number of animals which he had shot down, but the position in\r\nwhich each lies--on the right or on the left side--the spot where the\r\nshot hit, and the direction of the ball; and also retrace his way, step\r\nby step, through the whole race and recognize every animal he had the\r\nfortune to kill, without the least hesitation or difficulty. To divine\r\nhow this is accomplished bewilders the imagination.\r\n\r\n\"The main party arrived on the return journey at Pembina on August 17th,\r\nafter a journey of two months and two days. In due time the settlement\r\nwas reached, and the trip being a successful one, the returns on this\r\noccasion may be taken as a fair annual average. An approximation to the\r\ntruth is all we can arrive at, however. Our estimate is nine hundred\r\npounds weight of buffalo meat per cart, a thousand being considered\r\nthe full load, which gives one million and eighty-nine thousand pounds\r\nin all, or something more than two hundred pounds weight for each\r\nindividual, old and young, in the settlement. As soon as the expedition\r\narrived, the Hudson's Bay Company, according to usual custom, issued a\r\nnotice that it would take a certain specified quantity of provisions,\r\nnot from each fellow that had been on the plains, but from each old and\r\nrecognized hunter. The established price at this period for the three\r\nkinds over head, fat, pemmican, and dried meat, was two pence a pound.\r\nThis was then the Company's standard price; but there is generally a\r\nmarket for all the fat they bring. During the years 1839, 1840, and\r\n1841, the Company expended five thousand pounds on the purchase of\r\nplain provisions, of which the hunters got last year the sum of twelve\r\nhundred pounds, being rather more money than all the agricultural class\r\nobtained for their produce in the same year. It will be remembered that\r\nthe Company's demand affords the only regular market or outlet in the\r\nColony, and, as a matter of course, it is the first supplied.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF LABRADOR AND THE KING'S DOMAINS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nLIFE ON THE SHORES OF HUDSON BAY AND LABRADOR.\r\n\r\n     The bleak shores unprogressive--Now as at the beginning--York\r\n     Factory--Description of Ballantyne--The weather--Summer comes with\r\n     a rush--Picking up subsistence--The Indian trade--Inhospitable\r\n     Labrador--Establishment of Ungava Bay--McLean at Fort\r\n     Chimo--Herds of cariboo--Eskimo crafts--\"Shadowy Tartarus\"--The\r\n     king's domains--Mingan--Mackenzie--The Gulf settlements--The\r\n     Moravians--Their four missions--Rigolette, the chief trading\r\n     post--A school for developing character--Chief Factor Donald A.\r\n     Smith--Journeys along the coast--A barren shore.\r\n\r\n\r\nLife on the shores of Hudson Bay is as unchangeable as the shores and\r\nscenery of the coast are monotonous. The swampy, treeless flats that\r\nsurround the Bay simply change from the frozen, snow-clad expanse which\r\nstretches as far as the eye can see in winter, to the summer green of\r\nthe unending grey willows and stunted shrubs that cover the swampy\r\nshores. For a few open months the green prevails, and then nature for\r\neight months assumes her winding sheet of icy snow.\r\n\r\nFor two hundred and fifty years life has been as unvarying on these\r\nwastes as travellers tell us are the manners and customs of living\r\nof the Bedouins on their rocky Araby. No log shanties give way in\r\na generation to the settler's house, and then to the comfortable,\r\nwell-built stone or brick dwelling, which the fertile parts of America\r\nso readily permit. The accounts of McLean, Rae, Ryerson, and Ballantyne\r\nof the middle of the nineteenth century are precisely those of Robson,\r\nEllis, or Hearne of the eighteenth century, or indeed practically those\r\nof the early years of the Company in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe ships sail from Gravesend on the Thames with the same ceremonies,\r\nwith the visit and dinner of the committee of the directors, the \"great\r\nguns,\" as the sailors call them, as they have done for two centuries and\r\na quarter, from the days of Zachariah Gillam and Pierre Esprit Radisson.\r\nNo more settlement is now seen on Hudson Bay than in the early time,\r\nunless it be in the dwellings of the Christianized and civilized swampy\r\nCrees and in the mission houses around which the Indians have gathered.\r\n\r\nYork Factory, up to the middle of the nineteenth century, retained\r\nits supremacy. However, at times, Fort Churchill, with its well-built\r\nwalls and formidable bastions, may have disputed this primacy, yet York\r\nFactory was the depôt for the interior almost uninterruptedly. To it\r\ncame the goods for the northern department, by way in a single season of\r\nthe vessel the _Prince Rupert_, the successor of a long line of _Prince\r\nRuperts_, from the first one of 1680, or of its companions, the _Prince\r\nAlbert_ or the _Prince of Wales_. By these, the furs from the Far North\r\nfound their way, as at the first, to the Company's house in London.\r\n\r\nYork Factory is a large square of some six acres, lying along Hayes\r\nRiver, and shut in by high stockades. The houses are all wooden, and\r\non account of the swampy soil are raised up to escape the water of\r\nthe spring-time floods. At a point of advantage, a lofty platform was\r\nerected to serve as a \"look-out\" to watch for the coming ship, the great\r\nannual event of the slow-passing lives of the occupants of the post.\r\nThe flag-staff, on which, as is the custom at all Hudson's Bay Company\r\nposts, the ensign with the magic letters H. B. C. floats, speaks at once\r\nof many an old tradition and of great achievements.\r\n\r\nBallantyne in his lively style speaks of his two years at the post, and\r\ndescribes the life of a young Hudson's Bay Company officer. The chief\r\nfactor, to the eye of the young clerk, represents success achieved and\r\nis the embodiment of authority, which, on account of the isolation of\r\nthe posts and the absence of all law, is absolute and unquestioned. York\r\nFactory, being a depôt, has a considerable staff, chiefly young men,\r\nwho live in the bachelors' hall. Here dwell the surgeon, accountant,\r\npostmaster, half a dozen clerks, and others.\r\n\r\nIn winter, Ballantyne says, days, if not weeks, passed without the\r\narrival of a visitor, unless it were a post from the interior, or some\r\nCree trader of the neighbourhood, or some hungry Indian seeking food.\r\nThe cold was the chief feature of remark and consideration. At times the\r\nspirit thermometer indicated 65 deg. below zero, and the uselessness of\r\nthe mercury thermometer was then shown by a pot of quicksilver being\r\nmade into bullets and remaining solid. Every precaution was taken to\r\nerect strong buildings, which had double windows and double doors, and\r\nyet in the very severe weather, water contained in a vessel has been\r\nknown to freeze in a room where a stove red hot was doing its best. It\r\nis worthy of notice, however, that even in Arctic regions, a week or ten\r\ndays is as long as such severe weather continues, and mild intervals\r\ncome regularly.\r\n\r\nOn the Bay the coming of spring is looked for with great expectation,\r\nand when it does come, about the middle of May, it sets in with a\r\n\"rush;\" the sap rises in the shrubs and bushes, the buds burst out,\r\nthe rivers are freed from ice, and indeed, so rapid and complete is\r\nthe change, that it may be said there are only two seasons--summer and\r\nwinter--in these latitudes.\r\n\r\nAs summer progresses the fare of dried geese, thousands of which are\r\nstored away for winter use, of dried fish and the white ptarmigan and\r\nwood partridge that linger about the bushes and are shot for food, is\r\nsuperseded by the arrival of myriads of ducks and geese and the use of\r\nthe fresh fish of the Bay. In many of the posts the food throughout the\r\nwhole year is entirely flesh diet, and not a pound of farinaceous food\r\nis obtainable. This leads to an enormous consumption of the meat diet\r\nin order to supply a sufficient amount of nourishment. An employé will\r\nsometimes eat two whole geese at a meal.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Rae's celebrated expedition from Fort Churchill, north along\r\nthe shore of Hudson Bay, on his search for Sir John Franklin, the\r\namount of supplies taken was entirely inadequate for his party for the\r\nlong period of twenty-seven months, being indeed only enough for four\r\nmonths' full rations. In Rae's instructions from Sir George Simpson it\r\nis said, \"For the remaining part of your men you cannot fail to find\r\nsubsistence, animated as you are and they are by a determination to\r\nfulfil your mission at the cost of danger, fatigue, and privation.\r\nWhenever the natives can live, I can have no fears with respect to you,\r\nmore particularly as you will have the advantage of the Eskimos, not\r\nmerely in your actual supplies, but also in the means of recruiting and\r\nrenewing them.\"\r\n\r\nThe old forts still remained in addition to the two depôt posts, York\r\nand Moose Factory, there being Churchill, Severn, Rupert's House,\r\nFort George, and Albany--and the life in them all of the stereotyped\r\ndescription which we have pictured. Besides the preparation in summer\r\nof supplies for the long winter, the only variety was the arrival of\r\nIndians with furs from the interior. The trade is carried on by means\r\nof well-known standards called the \"castor\" or \"beaver.\" The Indian\r\nhands his furs over to the trader, who sorts them into different lots.\r\nThe value is counted up at so many--say fifty--castors. The Indian then\r\nreceives fifty small bits of wood, and with these proceeds to buy guns,\r\nknives, blankets, cloth, beads, or trinkets, never stopping till his\r\ncastors are all exhausted. The castor rarely exceeds two shillings in\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nWhile resembling in its general features the life on the Bay, the\r\nconduct of the fur trader on the shore of Labrador and throughout the\r\nLabrador Peninsula is much more trying and laborious than around the\r\nBay. The inhospitable climate, the heavy snows, the rocky, dangerous\r\nshore, and the scarcity in some parts of animal life, long prevented the\r\nfur companies from venturing upon this forbidding coast.\r\n\r\nThe northern part of Labrador is inhabited by Eskimos; further south are\r\ntribes of swampy Crees. Between the Eskimos and Indians deadly feuds\r\nlong prevailed. The most cruel and bloody raids were made upon the timid\r\nEskimos, as was done on the Coppermine when Hearne went on his famous\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nMcLean states that it was through the publication of a pamphlet by the\r\nMoravian missionaries of Labrador, which declared that \"the country\r\nproduced excellent furs,\" that the Hudson's Bay Company was led to\r\nestablish trading posts in Northern Labrador. The stirring story of\r\n\"Ungava,\" written by Ballantyne, gives what is no doubt in the main a\r\ncorrect account of the establishment of the far northern post called\r\n\"Fort Chimo,\" on Ungava Bay.\r\n\r\nThe expedition left Moose Factory in 1831, and after escaping the\r\ndangers of floating ice, fierce storms, and an unknown coast, erected\r\nthe fort several miles up the river running into Ungava Bay. The story\r\nrecalls the finding out, no doubt somewhat after the manner of the\r\nfamous boys' book, \"The Swiss Family Robinson,\" the trout and salmon of\r\nthe waters, the walrus of the sea, and the deer of the mountain valleys,\r\nbut the picture is not probably overdrawn. The building of Fort Chimo\r\nis plainly described by one who was familiar with the exploration and\r\nlife of the fur country; the picture of the tremendous snowstorm and its\r\noverwhelming drifts is not an unlikely one for this coast, which, since\r\nthe day of Cortereal, has been the terror of navigators.\r\n\r\nMcLean, a somewhat fretful and biassed writer, though certainly not\r\nlacking in a clear and lively style, gives an account of his being\r\nsent, in 1837, to take charge of the district of North Labrador for the\r\nCompany. On leaving York Factory in August the brig encountered much\r\nice, although it escaped the mishaps which overtook almost all small\r\nvessels on the Bay. The steep cliffs of the island of Akpatok, which\r\nstands before Ungava Bay, were very nearly run upon in the dark, and\r\nmuch difficulty was experienced in ascending the Ungava, or South River,\r\nto Fort Chimo.\r\n\r\nThe trader's orders from Governor Simpson were to push outposts into\r\nthe interior of Labrador, to support his men on the resources of the\r\ncountry, and to open communication with Esquimaux Bay, on the Labrador\r\ncoast, and thus, by means of the rivers, to establish an inland route\r\nof inter-communication between the two inlets. McLean made a most\r\ndetermined attempt to establish the desired route, but after innumerable\r\nhardships to himself and his company, retired, after nearly four months'\r\nefforts, to Fort Chimo, and sent a message to his superior officer that\r\nthe proposed line of communication was impracticable.\r\n\r\nMcLean gives an account of the arrival of a herd of three hundred\r\nreindeer or cariboo, and of the whole of them being captured in a\r\n\"pound,\" as is done in the case of the buffalo. The trader was also\r\nvisited by Eskimos from the north side of Hudson Strait, who had\r\ncrossed the rough and dangerous passage on \"a raft formed of pieces\r\nof driftwood picked up along the shore.\" The object of their visit\r\nwas to obtain wood for making canoes. The trader states that the fact\r\nof these people having crossed \"Hudson's Strait on so rude and frail\r\na conveyance\" strongly corroborates the opinion that America was\r\noriginally peopled from Asia by way of Behring's Strait.\r\n\r\nIt became more and more evident, however, that the Ungava trade could\r\nnot be profitably continued. Great expense was incurred in supplying\r\nUngava Bay by sea; the country was poor and barren, and the pertinacity\r\nof the Eskimos in adhering to their sealskin dresses made the trade in\r\nfabrics, which was profitable among the Indians, an impossibility at\r\nUngava. McLean continued his explorations and was somewhat successful in\r\nopening the sought-for route by way of the Grand River, and, returning\r\nto Fort Chimo, wintered there. Having been promoted by Sir George\r\nSimpson, McLean obtained leave to visit Britain, and before going\r\nreceived word from the directors of the Company that his recommendation\r\nto abandon Ungava Bay had been accepted, and that the ship would call at\r\nthat point and remove the people and property to Esquimaux Bay. McLean,\r\nin speaking of the weather of Hudson Straits during the month of January\r\n(1842), gives expression to his strong dislike by saying, \"At this\r\nperiod I have neither seen, read, nor heard of any locality under heaven\r\nthat can offer a more cheerless abode to civilized man than Ungava.\"\r\n\r\nReferring also to the fog that so abounds at this point as well as at\r\nthe posts around Hudson Bay, the discontented trader says: \"If Pluto\r\nshould leave his own gloomy mansion _in tenebris Tartari_, he might take\r\nup his abode here, and gain or lose but little by the exchange.\"\r\n\r\nBut the enterprising fur-traders were not to be deterred by the\r\niron-bound coast, or foggy shores, or dangerous life of any part of the\r\npeninsula of Labrador. Early in the century, while the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany were penetrating southward from the eastern shore of Hudson\r\nBay, which had by a kind of anomaly been called the \"East Main,\" the\r\nNorth-West Company were occupying the north shore of the St. Lawrence\r\nand met their rivals at the head waters of the Saguenay.\r\n\r\nThe district of which Tadoussac was the centre had from the earliest\r\ncoming of the French been noted for its furs. That district all the way\r\ndown to the west end of the island of Anticosti was known as the \"King's\r\nDomains.\" The last parish was called Murray Bay, from General Murray,\r\nthe first British governor of Quebec, who had disposed of the district,\r\nwhich furnished beef and butter for the King, to two of his officers,\r\nCaptains Nairn and Fraser.\r\n\r\nThe North-West Company, in the first decade of the nineteenth century,\r\nhad leased this district, which along with the Seigniory of Mingan that\r\nlay still further down the Gulf of St. Lawrence, was long known as the\r\n\"King's Posts.\" Beyond the Seigniory of Mingan, a writer of the period\r\nmentioned states that the Labrador coast had been left unappropriated,\r\nand was a common to which all nations at peace with England might\r\nresort, unmolested, for furs, oil, cod-fish, and salmon.\r\n\r\nA well-known trader, James McKenzie, after returning from the Athabasca\r\nregion, made, in 1808, a canoe journey through the domains of the\r\nKing, and left a journal, with his description of the rocky country\r\nand its inhabitants. He pictures strongly the one-eyed chief of Mingan\r\nand Father Labrosse, the Nestor for twenty-five years of the King's\r\nposts, who was priest, doctor, and poet for the region. McKenzie's\r\nvoyage chiefly inclined him to speculate as to the origin and religion\r\nof the natives, while his description of the inland Indians and their\r\nsocial life is interesting. His account of the manners and customs of\r\nthe Montagners or Shore Indians was more detailed than that of the\r\nNascapees, or Indians of the interior, and he supplies us with an\r\nextensive vocabulary of their language.\r\n\r\nMcKenzie gives a good description of the Saguenay River, of Chicoutimi,\r\nand Lake St. John, and of the ruins of a Jesuit establishment which had\r\nflourished during the French régime. Whilst the bell and many implements\r\nhad been dug up from the scene of desolation, the plum and apple trees\r\nof their garden were found bearing fruit. From the poor neglected fort\r\nof Assuapmousoin McKenzie returned, since the fort of Mistassini could\r\nonly be reached by a further journey of ninety leagues. This North-West\r\npost was built at the end of Lake Mistassini, while the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany Fort, called Birch Point, was erected four days' journey\r\nfurther on toward East Main House.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Saguenay, McKenzie followed the coast of the St. Lawrence,\r\npassing by Portneuf, with its beautiful chapel, \"good enough for His\r\nHoliness the Pope to occupy,\" after which--the best of the King's posts\r\nfor furs--Ile Jérémie was reached, with its buildings and chapels on a\r\nhigh eminence. Irregularly built Godbout was soon in view, and the Seven\r\nIslands Fort was then come upon. Mingan was the post of which McKenzie\r\nwas most enamoured. Its fine harbour and pretty chapel drew his special\r\nattention. The \"Man River\" was famous for its fisheries, while Masquaro,\r\nthe next port, was celebrated for the supply of beavers and martins in\r\nits vicinity. The salmon entering the river in the district are stated\r\nto be worthy of note, and the traveller and his company returned to\r\nQuebec, the return voyage being two hundred leagues.\r\n\r\nSince the time of McKenzie the fur trade has been pushed along the\r\nformerly unoccupied coast of Labrador. Even before that time the far\r\nnorthern coast had been taken up by a brave band of Moravians, who\r\nsupported themselves by trade, and at the same time did Christian work\r\namong the Eskimos. Their movement merits notice. As early as 1749 a\r\nbrave Hollander pilot named Erhardt, stimulated by reading the famous\r\nbook of Henry Ellis on the North-West Passage, made an effort to form a\r\nsettlement on the Labrador coast. He lost his life among the deceitful\r\nEskimos.\r\n\r\nYears afterward, Count Zinzendorf made application to the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany to be allowed to send Moravian missionaries to the different\r\nHudson's Bay Company posts. The union of trader and missionary in the\r\nMoravian cult made the Company unwilling to grant this request. After\r\nvarious preparations the Moravians took up unoccupied ground on the\r\nLabrador coast, in 56 deg. 36´ N., where they found plenty of wood,\r\nrunlets of sparkling water and a good anchorage. They erected a stone\r\nmarked G.R. III., 1770, for the King, and another with the inscription\r\nV.F. (Unitas fratrum), the name of their sect.\r\n\r\nTheir first settlement was called Nain, and it was soon followed by\r\nanother thirty miles up the coast known as \"Okkak.\" Thirty miles south\r\nof Nain they found remains of the unfortunate movement first made by the\r\nSociety, and here they established a mission, calling it \"Hopedale.\"\r\nWhen they had become accustomed to the coast, they showed still more\r\nof the adventurous spirit and founded their most northerly post of\r\nHebron, well nigh up to the dreaded \"Ungava Bay.\" A community of upwards\r\nof eleven hundred Christian Eskimos has resulted from the fervour and\r\nself-denial of these humble but faithful missionaries. Their courage and\r\ndetermination stand well beside that of the daring fur traders.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson's Bay Company was not satisfied with Mingan as their farthest\r\noutward point. In 1832 and 1834, Captain Bayfield, R.N., surveyed the\r\nLabrador coast. In due time the Company pushed on to the inlet known\r\nas Hamilton Inlet or Esquimaux Bay, on the north side of which the\r\nfort grew up, known as Rigolette. Here a farm is maintained stocked\r\nwith \"Cattle, sheep, pigs and hens,\" and the place is the depôt of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company and of the general trade of the coast. Farther\r\nup two other sub-posts are found, viz., Aillik, and on the opposite\r\nside of the Inlet Kaipokok. The St. Lawrence and Labrador posts of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company have been among the most difficult and trying of\r\nthose in any part where the Company carries on its vast operations from\r\nAtlantic to Pacific. This Labrador region has been a noble school for\r\nthe development of the firmness, determination, skill, and faithfulness\r\ncharacteristic of both the officers and men of the Hudson's Bay Company.\r\n\r\nMost notable of the officers of the first rank who have conducted the\r\nfur trade in Labrador is Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal, the present\r\nGovernor of the Company. Coming out at eighteen, Donald Alexander Smith,\r\na well-educated Scottish lad, related to Peter and Cuthbert Grant, and\r\nthe brothers John and James Stuart, prominent officers, whose deeds in\r\nthe North-West Company are still remembered, the future Governor began\r\nhis career. Young Smith, on arriving at Montreal (1838), was despatched\r\nto Moose Factory, and for more than thirty years was in the service,\r\nin the region of Hudson Bay and Labrador. Rising to the rank of chief\r\ntrader, after fourteen years of laborious service he reached in ten\r\nyears more the acme of desire of every aspirant in the Company, the\r\nrank of chief factor. His years on the coast of Labrador, at Rigolette,\r\nand its subordinate stations were most laborious. The writer has had\r\nthe privilege from time to time of hearing his tales, of the long\r\njourney along the frozen coast, of camping on frozen islands, without\r\nshelter, of storm-staid journeys rivalling the recitals of Ballantyne\r\nat Fort Chimo, of cold receptions by the Moravians, and of the doubtful\r\nhospitalities of both Indians and Eskimos. Every statement of Cortereal,\r\nGilbert, or Cabot of the inhospitable shore is corroborated by this\r\nsuccessful officer, who has lived for thirty years since leaving\r\nLabrador to fill a high place in the affairs both of Canada and the\r\nEmpire. One of his faithful subordinates on this barren coast was\r\nChief Factor P. W. Bell, who gained a good reputation for courage and\r\nfaithfulness, not only in Labrador, but on the barren shore of Lake\r\nSuperior. The latter returned to Labrador after his western experience,\r\nand retired from the charge of the Labrador posts a few years ago. It\r\nis to the credit of the Hudson's Bay Company that it has been able to\r\nsecure men of such calibre and standing to man even its most difficult\r\nand unattractive stations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nATHABASCA, MACKENZIE RIVER, AND THE YUKON.\r\n\r\n     Peter Pond reaches Athabasca River--Fort Chipewyan\r\n     established--Starting-point of Alexander McKenzie--The\r\n     Athabasca library--The Hudson Bay Company roused--Conflict at\r\n     Fort Wedderburn--Suffering--The dash up the Peace River--Fort\r\n     Dunvegan--Northern extension--Fort Resolution--Fort Providence--The\r\n     great river occupied--Loss of life--Fort Simpson, the centre--Fort\r\n     Reliance--Herds of cariboo--Fort Norman built--Fort Good Hope--The\r\n     Northern Rockies--The Yukon reached and occupied--The fierce\r\n     Liard River--Fort Halkett in the mountains--Robert Campbell comes\r\n     to the Stikine--Discovers the Upper Yukon--His great fame--The\r\n     districts--Steamers on the water stretches.\r\n\r\n     (The map on page 388 should be consulted while this chapter is\r\n     being read.)\r\n\r\nLess than twenty years after the conquest of Canada by the British, the\r\ntraders heard of the Lake Athabasca and Mackenzie River district. The\r\nregion rapidly rose into notice, until it reached the zenith as the fur\r\ntraders' paradise, a position it has held till the present time.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, Samuel Hearne, the Hudson's Bay Company adventurer--the\r\nMungo Park of the North--first of white men, touched, on his way to the\r\nCoppermine, Lake Athapuscow, now thought to have been Great Slave Lake.\r\n\r\nIt was the good fortune, however, of the North-West Company to take\r\npossession of this region first for trade.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAKE AND RIVER ATHABASCA.\r\n\r\nThe daring Montreal traders, who had seized upon the Saskatchewan and\r\npushed on to Lake Ile à la Crosse, having a surplus of merchandise in\r\nthe year 1778, despatched one of their agents to Lake Athabasca, and\r\n\"took seisin\" of the country. As already stated, the man selected was\r\nthe daring and afterwards violent trader Peter Pond. On the River\r\nAthabasca, some thirty miles south of the Lake, Pond built the first\r\nIndian trading post of the region, which, however, after a few years was\r\nabandoned and never afterwards rebuilt.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT CHIPEWYAN.\r\n\r\nLess than ten years after this pioneer led the way, a fort was built\r\non the south side of Lake Athabasca, at a point a few miles east of\r\nthe entrance of the river. To this, borrowing the name of the Indian\r\nnation of the district, was given the name Fort Chipewyan. This old\r\nfort became celebrated as the starting-place of the great expedition of\r\nAlexander Mackenzie, when he discovered the river that bears his name\r\nand the Polar Sea into which it empties. At this historic fort also,\r\nRoderick McKenzie, cousin of the explorer, founded the famous \"Athabasca\r\nLibrary,\" for the use of the officers of the Company in the northern\r\nposts, and in its treasures Lieutenant Lefroy informs us he revelled\r\nduring his winter stay.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the century the X Y Company aggressively invaded the\r\nAthabasca region, and built a fort a mile north of Fort Chipewyan, near\r\nthe site of the present Roman Catholic Mission of the Nativity.\r\n\r\nAs the conflict between the North-West and Hudson's Bay Companies\r\nwaxed warm, the former Company, no doubt for the purpose of being more\r\nfavourably situated for carrying on the trade with the Mackenzie River,\r\nremoved their fort on Lake Athabasca to the commanding promontory near\r\nthe exit of Slave River from the lake. Renewed and often enlarged, Fort\r\nChipewyan has until recently remained the greatest depôt of the north\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY AROUSED.\r\n\r\nThe fierceness of the struggle for the fur trade may be seen in the\r\nfact that the Hudson's Bay Company (1815) with vigour took up a site\r\non an island in front of Fort Chipewyan and built Fort Wedderburn, at\r\nno greater distance than a single mile, and though it was not their\r\nfirst appearance on the lake, yet they threw themselves in considerable\r\nforce into the contest, numbering, under John Clark, afterward Chief\r\nFactor, ten clerks, a hundred men, and fourteen large canoes loaded\r\nwith supplies. Many misfortunes befell the new venture of the Company.\r\nA writer of the time says, \"No less than fifteen men, one woman, and\r\nseveral children perished by starvation. They built four trade posts on\r\nthe Peace River (lower) and elsewhere in the autumn; but not one of them\r\nwas able to weather out the following winter. All were obliged to come\r\nto terms with their opponents to save the party from utter destruction.\r\nThat year the Athabasca trade of the North-West Company was four hundred\r\npacks against only five in all secured by the Hudson's Bay Company.\"\r\n\r\nThree years afterward the old Company, with British pluck, again\r\nappeared on this lake, having nineteen loaded canoes. Trader Clark was\r\nnow accompanied by the doughty leader, Colin Robertson, whose prowess we\r\nhave already seen in the Red River conflict.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that in the year before the union of the\r\nCompanies, George Simpson, the young clerk, arrived on Lake Athabasca\r\nwith fifteen loaded canoes. He was chiefly found at Fort Wedderburn\r\nand a short distance up the Peace River. It is not certain that the\r\nprospective Governor ever visited Slave Lake to the north. He gives,\r\nhowever, the following vivid summary of his winter's experience in\r\nAthabasca: \"At some seasons both whites and Indians live in wasteful\r\nabundance on venison, buffalo meat, fish, and game of all kinds, while\r\nat other times they are reduced to the last degree of hunger, often\r\npassing several days without food. In the year 1820 our provisions fell\r\nshort at the establishment, and on two or three occasions I went for\r\ntwo or three whole days and nights without having a single morsel to\r\nswallow, but then again, I was one of a party of eleven men and one\r\nwoman which discussed at one sitting meal no less than three ducks and\r\ntwenty-two geese!\" This winter's knowledge was of great value to the man\r\nafterwards called to be the arbiter of destiny of many a hard-pressed\r\ntrader.\r\n\r\nOther forts are mentioned as having been established by both Companies\r\nat different points on the Athabasca River, but their period of duration\r\nwas short. In some cases these abandoned forts have been followed by\r\nnew forts, in recent times, on the same sites.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEACE RIVER.\r\n\r\nSoon after the arrival of the first traders in the Athabasca district,\r\nthe fame of the Peace River--the Indian \"Unjijah,\" a mighty stream,\r\nwhose waters empty into the river flowing from Lake Athabasca--rose\r\namong the adventurers. An enterprising French Canadian trader,\r\nnamed Boyer, pushed up the stream and near a small tributary--Red\r\nRiver--established the first post of this great artery, which flows from\r\nthe West, through the Rocky Mountains. Long abandoned, this post has in\r\nlate years been re-established.\r\n\r\nThe Peace River has ever had a strange fascination for trader and\r\ntourist, and a few years after Boyer's establishment became known,\r\na trading house was built above the \"Chutes\" of the river. This was\r\nafterwards moved some distance up stream and became the well-known Fort\r\nVermilion. This fort has remained till the present day.\r\n\r\nFarther still up the Peace River, where the Smoky River makes its\r\nforks, a fort was erected whose stores and dwelling-houses were on a\r\nlarger scale than those of the mother establishment of Fort Chipewyan,\r\nhaving had stockaded walls, a good powder magazine, and a good well\r\nof water. This fort for a time was known as McLeod's Fort, but in the\r\ncourse of events its site was abandoned. Fort Dunvegan, famous to later\r\ntravellers, was first built on the south side of the river, and was the\r\nheadquarters of the Beaver Indians, from whom the North-West Company\r\nreceived a formal gift of the site. The present fort is on the opposite\r\nside of the Peace River.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered, however, that it was from the post at the mouth\r\nof Smoky River that Alexander Mackenzie, having wintered, started on his\r\ngreat journey to the Pacific. In later years the Hudson's Bay Company\r\nhas maintained a fort at this point as an outpost of Dunvegan.\r\n\r\nEarly in the century we find allusions to the fact that the catch of\r\nbeaver was, from over-hunting, declining in the Peace River country, and\r\nthat, in consequence, the North-West Company had been compelled to give\r\nup several of their forts. Around Fort St. John's a tragic interest\r\ngathers. John McLean, in his \"Notes of a Twenty-five Years' Service,\"\r\nspeaks of reaching on his journey--1833--the \"tenantless fort,\" where\r\nsome years before a massacre had taken place. It had been determined by\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company to remove the fort to Rocky Mountain Portage.\r\nThe tribe of Tsekanies, to whom the fort was tributary, took this as an\r\ninsult. At the time of removal the officer in charge, Mr. Hughes, had\r\nsent off a part of his men with effects of the fort intended for the new\r\npost. Hughes was shot down on the riverside by the Indians. The party of\r\nboatmen, on returning, \"altogether unconscious of the fate that awaited\r\nthem, came paddling towards the landing-place, singing a voyageur's\r\nsong, and Just as the canoe touched the shore, a volley of bullets was\r\ndischarged at them, which silenced them for ever. They were all killed\r\non the spot.\" An expedition was organized by the traders to avenge\r\nthe foul murder, but more peaceful counsels prevailed. Most of the\r\nfugitives paid the penalty of their guilt by being starved to death. The\r\ndeserted fort was some twenty miles below the present Fort St. John's.\r\nThe present fort was built in the latter half of the century, and its\r\noutpost of Hudson's Hope, together with the trade station at Battle\r\nRiver, below Dunvegan, was erected about a generation ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT SLAVE LAKE.\r\n\r\nThe extension of the fur trade to Great Slave Lake dates back to within\r\nseven years after the advent of Peter Pond on the Athabasca River. The\r\nfamous trader, Cuthbert Grant, father of the \"Warden of the Plains,\" who\r\nfigured in the Seven Oaks fight, led the way, and with him a Frenchman,\r\nLaurent Leroux. Reaching this great lake, these ardent explorers built a\r\ntrading post on Slave River, near its mouth. A short time afterwards the\r\ntraders moved their first post to Moose Deer Island, a few miles from\r\nthe old site, and here the North-West Company remained until the time of\r\nthe union of the Companies. The impulse of union led to the construction\r\nof a new establishment on the site chosen by the Hudson's Bay Company\r\nfor the erection of their post some six years before. The new post was\r\ncalled Fort Resolution, and was on the mainland two miles or more from\r\nthe island. This post marked the extreme limit of the operations of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company up to the time of the union.\r\n\r\nWhen Alexander Mackenzie determined to make his first great voyage, he\r\nstarted from Fort Chipewyan and bravely pushing out into the unknown\r\nwilds, left Great Slave Lake and explored the river that bears his name.\r\nHere he promised the tribe of the Yellow Knife Indians to establish a\r\npost among them in the next year. The promise was kept to the letter.\r\nThe new post, built at the mouth of the Yellow Knife River, was called\r\nFort Providence. It was afterwards removed to a large island in the\r\nnorth arm of the lake, and to this the name Fort Rae, in honour of\r\nthe celebrated Arctic explorer, John Rae, was given. Near this new\r\nstation there has been for years a Roman Catholic Mission. It was from\r\nthe neighbourhood of these forts on the lake that Captain Franklin\r\nset out to build his temporary station, Fort Enterprise, one hundred\r\nmiles from his base of supplies. Fort Rae has remained since the time\r\nof its erection a place of some importance. It formed the centre of\r\nthe northern operations of Captain Dawson, R.A., on his expedition for\r\ncircumpolar observation in recent times.\r\n\r\nAfter the Hudson's Bay Company had transferred Rupert's Land to Canada,\r\na new post was opened on the Slave River, midway between Athabasca\r\nand Great Slave Lake. It was called Fort Smith, in honour of Chief\r\nCommissioner Donald A. Smith, now Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal. Near\r\nthe site of Fort Smith are the dangerous Noyé Rapids of Slave River,\r\nwhere Grant and Leroux, on their voyage to Great Slave Lake, lost a\r\ncanoe and five of its occupants. From Fort Smith southward to Smith\r\nLanding a waggon or cart road has been in use up to the present time.\r\nNow this is to be converted into a tramway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF MACKENZIE RIVER AND THE YUKON.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMACKENZIE RIVER.\r\n\r\nNorthward the course of the fur traders' empire has continually made\r\nits way. Leaving Great Slave Lake four years before the close of the\r\neighteenth century, along the course of Alexander Mackenzie's earlier\r\nexploration, Duncan Livingston, a North-West Company trader, built\r\nthe first fort on the river eighty miles north of the lake. Three\r\nyears later the trader, his three French-Canadian voyageurs and Indian\r\ninterpreter, were basely killed by the Eskimos on the Lower Mackenzie\r\nRiver. A year or two afterward a party of fur traders, under John Clark,\r\nstarted on an expedition of exploration and retaliation down the river,\r\nbut again the fury of the Eskimos was roused. In truth, had it not been\r\nfor a storm of fair wind which favoured them, the traders would not have\r\nescaped with their lives.\r\n\r\nVery early in the present century, Fort Simpson, the former and present\r\nheadquarters of the extensive Mackenzie River district, was built, and\r\nvery soon after its establishment the prominent trader, and afterwards\r\nChief Factor, George Keith, is found in charge of it. It is still the\r\ngreat trading and Church of England Mission centre of the vast region\r\nreaching to the Arctic Sea.\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of the century, Big Island, at the point where\r\nthe Mackenzie River leaves Great Slave Lake, was, on account of its\r\ngood supply of white fish, the wintering station for the supernumerary\r\ndistrict servants of the Hudson's Bay Company. Though this point is\r\nstill visited for fishing in the autumn, yet in later years the trade of\r\nthis post has been transferred to another built near the Roman Catholic\r\nMission at Fort Providence, forty miles farther down the river. On Hay\r\nRiver, near the point of departure of the Mackenzie River from the lake,\r\nseveral forts have been built from time to time and abandoned, among\r\nthem a Fort George referred to by the old traders. The eastern end of\r\nthe lake, known as Fond du Lac, became celebrated, as we have already\r\nseen, in connection with the Arctic explorers, Sir George Back and Dr.\r\nRichard King, for here they built Fort Reliance and wintered, going in\r\nthe spring to explore the Great Fish River. In after years, on account\r\nof the district being the resort for the herds of cariboo, Fort Reliance\r\nwas rebuilt, and was for a time kept up as an outpost of Fort Resolution\r\nfor collecting furs and \"country provisions.\" It may be re-occupied soon\r\non account of the discoveries of gold and copper in the region.\r\n\r\nJourneying down the Mackenzie River, we learn that there was a fur\r\ntraders' post of the Montreal merchants sixty miles north of Fort\r\nSimpson. In all probability this was but one of several posts that\r\nwere from time to time occupied in that locality. At the beginning of\r\nthe century the North-West Company pushed on further north, and had a\r\ntrading post on the shore of Great Bear Lake, but almost immediately on\r\nits erection they were met here by their rivals, the X Y Company. At\r\nthis point, reached by going up the Bear River from its junction with\r\nthe Mackenzie on the south-west arm of the lake, Chief Factor Peter\r\nDease built Fort Franklin for the use of the great Arctic explorer,\r\nafter whom he named the fort.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT NORMAN, ON THE MACKENZIE.\r\n\r\nTo explore new ground was a burning desire in the breasts of the\r\nNor'-Westers. Immediately in the year of their reunion with the X\r\nY Company, the united North-West Company established a post on the\r\nMackenzie River, sixty miles north of the mouth of Bear River. Indeed,\r\nthe mouth of Bear River on the Mackenzie seems to have suggested itself\r\nas a suitable point for a post to be built, for in 1810 Fort Norman had\r\nbeen first placed there. For some reason the post was moved thirty or\r\nforty miles higher up the river, but a jam of ice having occurred in the\r\nspring of 1851, the fort was mainly swept away by the high water, though\r\nthe occupants and all the goods were saved. In the same year the mouth\r\nof the Bear River came into favour again, and Fort Norman was built\r\nat that point. After this time the fort was moved once or twice, but\r\nwas finally placed in its present commanding position. It was in quite\r\nrecent times that, under Chief Factor Camsell's direction, a station\r\nhalf-way between Fort Norman and Fort Simpson was fixed and the name of\r\nFort Wrigley given to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT GOOD HOPE.\r\n\r\nNot only did the impulse of union between the North-West and X Y\r\nCompanies reach Bear River, but in the same year, at a point on the\r\nMackenzie River beyond the high perpendicular cliffs known as \"The\r\nRamparts,\" some two hundred miles further north than Fort Norman, was\r\nFort Good Hope erected. Here it remained for nearly a score of years\r\nas the farthest north outpost of the fur trade, but after the union of\r\nthe North-West and Hudson's Bay Companies it was moved a hundred miles\r\nsouthward on the river and erected on Manitoulin Island. After some\r\nyears (1836) an ice jam of a serious kind took place, and though the\r\ninmates escaped in a York boat, yet the fort was completely destroyed by\r\nthe rushing waters of the angry Mackenzie. The fort was soon rebuilt,\r\nbut in its present beautiful situation on the eastern bank of the river,\r\nopposite the old site on Manitoulin Island.\r\n\r\nDuring Governor Simpson's time the extension of trade took place toward\r\nthe mouth of the Mackenzie River. A trader, John Bell, who not only\r\nfaced the hardships of the region within the Arctic Circle, but also\r\ngained a good name in connection with Sir John Richardson's expedition\r\nin search of Franklin, built the first post on Peel's River, which runs\r\ninto the delta of Mackenzie River. Bell, in 1846, descended the Rat\r\nRiver, and first of British explorers set eyes on the Lower Yukon.\r\n\r\nIn the following year the Hudson's Bay Company established La Pierre's\r\nHouse in the heart of the Rocky Mountains toward the Arctic Sea, and\r\nChief Trader Murray built and occupied the first Fort Yukon. This fort\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company held for twenty-two years, until the territory\r\nof Alaska passed into the hands of the people of the United States.\r\nRampart House was built by the Hudson's Bay Company within British\r\nterritory. Both Rampart House and La Pierre's House were abandoned a\r\nfew years ago as unprofitable. A similar fate befell Fort Anderson, two\r\ndegrees north of the Arctic Circle, built for the Eastern Eskimos on\r\nthe Anderson River, discovered in 1857 by Chief Factor R. MacFarlane,\r\na few years before the transfer of the territory of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany to Canada. No doubt the withdrawal from Fort Anderson was\r\nhastened by the terribly fatal epidemic of scarlatina which prevailed\r\nall over the Mackenzie River district in the autumn and early winter\r\nof 1865. More than eleven hundred Indians and Eskimos, out of the four\r\nthousand estimated population, perished. The loss of the hunters caused\r\nby this disease, and the difficulties of overland transport, led to the\r\nabandonment of this out-of-the-way post.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIARD RIVER.\r\n\r\nThe conflict of the North-West and X Y Companies led to the most\r\nextraordinary exploration that Rupert's Land and the Indian territories\r\nhave witnessed. At the time when the Mackenzie River, at the beginning\r\nof the century, was being searched and occupied, a fort known as The\r\nForks was established at the junction of the Liard and Mackenzie Rivers.\r\nThis fort, called, after the union of the Hudson's Bay and North-West\r\nCompanies, Fort simpson, became the base of operations for the\r\nexploration of the Liard River. We have followed the course of trade by\r\nwhich the Mackenzie itself was placed under tribute; it may be well also\r\nto look at the occupation of the Liard, the most rapid and terrible of\r\nall the great eastern streams that dash down from the heart of the Rocky\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nThe first post to be established on this stream was Fort Liard, not far\r\nbelow the junction of the western with the east branch of the river.\r\nThere was an old fort between Fort Liard and Fort Simpson, but Fort\r\nLiard, which is still occupied by the Hudson's Bay Company, began almost\r\nwith the century, and a few years afterwards was under the experienced\r\ntrader, George Keith. Probably, at an equally early date, Fort Nelson,\r\non the eastern branch of the river, was established. In the second\r\ndecade of the century, Alexander Henry, the officer in charge, and all\r\nof his people were murdered by the Indians. The post was for many years\r\nabandoned, but was rebuilt in 1865, and is still a trading post.\r\n\r\nIt was probably shortly after the union of the North-West and Hudson's\r\nBay Companies that Fort Halkett, far up the western branch of the river,\r\nwas erected. After forty or fifty years of occupation, Fort Halkett\r\nwas abandoned, but a small post called Toad River was built some time\r\nafterward, half way between its site and that of Fort Liard. In 1834,\r\nChief Trader John M. McLeod, not the McLeod whose journal we have\r\nquoted, pushed up past the dangerous rapids and boiling whirlpools, and\r\namong rugged cliffs and precipices of the Rocky Mountains, discovered\r\nDease River and Dease Lake from which the river flows.\r\n\r\nRobert Campbell, an intrepid Scottish officer of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany, in 1838, succeeded in doing what his predecessors had been\r\nunable to accomplish, viz. to establish a trading-post on Dease Lake. In\r\nthe summer of the same year Campbell crossed to the Pacific Slope and\r\nreached the head waters of the Stikine River.\r\n\r\nIn opening his new post Campbell awakened the hostility of the coast\r\nIndians. He and his men became so reduced in supplies that they\r\nsubsisted for some time on the skin thongs of their moccasins and snow\r\nshoes and on the parchment windows of their huts, boiled to supply the\r\none meal a day which kept them alive. In the end Campbell was compelled\r\nto leave his station on the Dease Lake, and the fort was burnt by the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCOVERY OF THE UPPER YUKON.\r\n\r\nUnder orders from Governor Simpson, Campbell, in 1840, undertook\r\nthe exploration that has made his name famous. This was to ascend\r\nthe northern branch of the wild and dangerous Liard River. For this\r\npurpose he left the mountain post, Fort Halkett, and passing through\r\nthe great gorge arrived at Lake Frances, where he gave the promontory\r\nwhich divides the lake the name \"Simpson's Tower.\" Leaving the Lake\r\nand ascending one of its tributaries, called by him Finlayson's River,\r\nhe reached the interesting reservoir of Finlayson's Lake, of which, at\r\nhigh water, one part of the sheet runs west to the Pacific Ocean and\r\nthe other to the Arctic Sea. With seven trusty companions he crossed\r\nthe height of land and saw the high cliffs of the splendid river,\r\nwhich he called \"Pelly Banks,\" in honour of the then London Governor\r\nof the Company. The Company would have called it Campbell's River, but\r\nthe explorer refused the honour. Going down the stream a few miles on\r\na raft, Campbell then turned back, and reached Fort Halkett after an\r\nabsence of four months.\r\n\r\nHighly complimented by Governor Simpson, Campbell, under orders, in the\r\nnext year built a fort at Lake Frances, and in a short time another\r\nestablishment at Pelly Banks. Descending the river, the explorer met at\r\nthe junction of the Lewis and Pelly Banks a band of Indians, who would\r\nnot allow him to proceed further, and indeed plotted to destroy him\r\nand his men. Eight years after his discovery of Pelly Banks, Campbell\r\nstarted on his great expedition, which was crowned with success.\r\nReaching again the junction of the Pelly and Lewis Rivers, he erected\r\na post, naming it Fort Selkirk, although it was long locally known\r\nas Campbell's Fort. Two years after the building of Fort Selkirk,\r\nCampbell, journeying in all from the height of land for twelve hundred\r\nmiles, reached Fort Yukon, where, as we have seen, Trader Murray was in\r\ncharge. Making a circuit around by the Porcupine River and ascending\r\nthe Mackenzie River, Campbell surprised his friends at Fort Simpson by\r\ncoming up the river to Fort Simpson.\r\n\r\nIn 1852, a thievish band of coast Indians called the Chilkats plundered\r\nFort Selkirk and shortly afterward destroyed it. Its ruins remain to\r\nthis day, and the site is now taken up by the Canadian Government as a\r\nstation on the way to the Yukon gold-fields.\r\n\r\nCampbell went home to London, mapped out with the aid of Arrowsmith the\r\ncountry he had found, and gave names to its rivers and other features.\r\nA few years ago an officer of the United States army, Lieutenant\r\nSchwatka, sought to rob Campbell of his fame, and attempted to rename\r\nthe important points of the region. Campbell's merit and modesty entitle\r\nhim to the highest recognition.\r\n\r\nThe trading posts of the great region we are describing have been\r\nvariously grouped into districts. Previous to the union of the\r\nNorth-West and Hudson's Bay Companies, from Athabasca north and west\r\nwas known as the \"Athabasca-Mackenzie Department,\" their returns all\r\nbeing kept in one account. This northern department was long under the\r\nsuperintendency of Chief Factor Edward Smith.\r\n\r\nA new district was, some time after the transfer of the Indian\r\nterritories to Canada, formed and named \"Peace River.\" The management\r\nhas changed from time to time, Fort Dunvegan, for example, for a\r\nperiod the headquarters of the Peace River district, having lost its\r\npre-eminence and been transferred to be under the chief officer on\r\nLesser Slave Lake.\r\n\r\nThe vast inland water stretches of which we have spoken have been the\r\nchief means of communication throughout the whole country. Without these\r\nthere could have been little fur trade. The distances are bewildering.\r\nThe writer remembers seeing Bishop Bompas, who had left the far distant\r\nFort Yukon to go to England, and who by canoe, York boat, dog train,\r\nsnow shoe, and waggon, had been nine months on the journey before he\r\nreached Winnipeg.\r\n\r\nThe first northern inland steamer in these remote retreats was the\r\n_Graham_ (1882), built by the Company at Fort Chipewyan on Lake\r\nAthabasca, by Captain John M. Smith. Three years later the same captain\r\nbuilt the screw-propeller _Wrigley_, at Fort Smith, on the Slave River;\r\nand a few years afterward, this indefatigable builder launched at\r\nAthabasca landing the stern-wheeler _Athabasca_, for the water stretches\r\nof the Upper Athabasca River.\r\n\r\nHow remarkable the record of adventure, trade, rivalry, bloodshed,\r\nhardship, and successful effort, from the time, more than a century ago,\r\nwhen Peter Pond started out on his seemingly desperate undertaking!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nON THE PACIFIC SLOPE.\r\n\r\n     Extension of trade in New Caledonia--The Western\r\n     Department--Fort Vancouver built--Governor's residence and\r\n     Bachelor's Hall--Fort Colville--James Douglas, a man of note--A\r\n     dignified official--An Indian rising--A brave woman--The fertile\r\n     Columbia Valley--Finlayson, a man of action--Russian fur\r\n     traders--Treaty of Alaska--Lease of Alaska to the Hudson's Bay\r\n     Company--Fort Langley--The great farm--Black at Kamloops--Fur\r\n     trader v. botanist--\"No soul above a beaver's skin\"--A tragic\r\n     death--Chief Nicola's eloquence--A murderer's fate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great exploration early in the century secured the Pacific Slope\r\nvery largely to the North-West Company. Several of their most energetic\r\nagents, as the names of the rivers running into the Pacific Ocean show,\r\nhad made a deep impression on the region even as far south as the mouth\r\nof the Columbia River. On the union of the North-West and Hudson's Bay\r\nCompanies, Governor Simpson threw as much energy into the development of\r\ntrade in the country on the western side of the Rocky Mountains as if he\r\nhad been a thorough-going Nor'-Wester.\r\n\r\nIn his administration from ocean to ocean he divided the trading\r\nterritory into four departments, viz. Montreal, the Southern, the\r\nNorthern, and the Western. In each of these there were four factors,\r\nand these were, in the Western or Rocky Mountain department, subject\r\nto one chief. Under the chief factor the gradation was chief trader,\r\nchief clerk, apprenticed clerk, postmaster, interpreter, voyageur, and\r\nlabourer.\r\n\r\nThis fuller organization and the cessation of strife resulted in a\r\ngreat increase of the trade of the Hudson's Bay Company on the coast as\r\nwell as the east side of the Rocky Mountains. The old fort of Astoria,\r\nwhich was afterwards known as Fort George, was found too far from the\r\nmountains for the convenience of the fur traders. Accordingly in 1824-5,\r\na new fort was erected on the north side of the Columbia River, six\r\nmiles above its junction with the Willamette River. The new fort was\r\ncalled Fort Vancouver, and was built on a prairie slope about one mile\r\nback from the river, but it was afterwards moved nearer the river bank.\r\nThe new site was very convenient for carrying on the overland traffic\r\nto Puget Sound. This fort was occupied for twenty-three years, until\r\ninternational difficulties rendered its removal necessary.\r\n\r\nFort Vancouver was of considerable size, its stockade measuring 750 ft.\r\nin length and 600 ft. in breadth. The Governor's residence, Bachelor's\r\nHall, and numerous other buildings made up a considerable establishment.\r\nAbout the fort a farm was under cultivation to the extent of fifteen\r\nhundred acres, and a large number of cattle, sheep, and horses were bred\r\nupon it and supplied the trade carried on with the Russians in the Far\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nFarther up the Columbia River, where the Walla Walla River emptied in,\r\na fort was constructed in 1818. The material for this fort was brought\r\na considerable distance, and being in the neighbourhood of troublesome\r\ntribes of Indians, care was taken to make the fort strong and defensible.\r\n\r\nStill further up the Columbia River and near the mountains, an important\r\npost, Fort Colville, was built. This fort became the depôt for all\r\nthe trade done on the Columbia River; and from this point the brigade\r\nwhich had been organized at Fort Vancouver made its last call before\r\nundertaking the steep mountain climb which was necessary in order that\r\nby the middle of March it might reach Norway House and be reported at\r\nthe great summer meeting of the fur traders' council there. This task\r\nneeded a trusty leader, and for many years Chief Factor, afterward Sir\r\nJames, Douglas became the man on whom Governor and Council depended to\r\ndo this service.\r\n\r\nThe mention of the name of James Douglas brings before us the greatest\r\nand most notable man developed by the fur trade of the Pacific slope.\r\nThe history of this leader was for fifty years after the coalition of\r\nthe Companies in 1821, the history of the Hudson's Bay Company on the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR JAMES DOUGLAS.]\r\n\r\nBorn near the beginning of the century, a scion of the noble house of\r\nDouglas, young Douglas emigrated to Canada, entered the North-West\r\nCompany, learned French as if by magic, and though little more than\r\na lad, at once had heavy responsibilities thrown upon him. He was\r\nenterprising and determined, with a judicious mixture of prudence. He\r\nhad capital business talents and an adaptability that stood him in good\r\nstead in dealing with Indians. The veteran Chief Factor, McLoughlin,\r\nwho had served his term in the Nor'-Wester service about Lake Superior\r\nand Lake Nepigon, was appointed to the charge of the Pacific or Western\r\nDistrict. He discerned the genius of his young subordinate, and with\r\nthe permission of the directors in London, after a short interval, took\r\nDouglas west of the mountains to the scene of his future successes. The\r\nfriendship between these chiefs of the Pacific Coast was thus early\r\nbegun, and they together did much to mould the British interests on the\r\nPacific Coast into a comely shape.\r\n\r\nWhile McLoughlin crossed at once to the Columbia and took charge of\r\nFort Vancouver, he directed Douglas to go north to New Caledonia, or\r\nwhat is now Northern British Columbia, to learn the details of the fur\r\ntrade of the mountains. Douglas threw himself heartily into every part\r\nof his work. He not only learned the Indian languages, and used them to\r\nadvantage in the advancement of the fur trade, but studied successfully\r\nthe physical features of the country and became an authority on the\r\nPacific Slope which proved of greatest value to the Company and the\r\ncountry for many a day.\r\n\r\nDouglas had as his headquarters Fort St. James, near the outlet of\r\nStuart Lake, i.e. just west of the summit of the Rocky Mountains. He\r\ndetermined to enforce law and do away with the disorder which prevailed\r\nin the district. An Indian, who some time before had murdered one of\r\nthe servants of the Hudson's Bay Company, had been allowed to go at\r\nlarge. Judgment being long deferred, the murderer thought himself\r\nlikely to be unmolested, and visited Stuart Lake. Douglas, learning of\r\nhis presence, with a weak garrison seized the criminal and visited\r\nvengeance on him. The Indians were incensed, but knowing that they had\r\nto deal with a doughty Douglas, employed stratagem in their reprisals.\r\nThe old chief came very humbly to the fort and, knocking at the gate,\r\nwas given admittance. He talked the affair over with Douglas, and the\r\nmatter seemed in a fair way to be settled when another knock was heard\r\nat the gate. The chief stated that it was his brother who sought to be\r\nadmitted. The gate was opened, when in rushed the whole of the Nisqually\r\ntribe. McLean vividly describes the scene which ensued: \"The men of\r\nthe fort were overpowered ere they had time to stand on their defence.\r\nDouglas, however, seized a wall-piece that was mounted in the hall,\r\nand was about to discharge it on the crowd that was pouring in upon\r\nhim, when the chief seized him by the hands and held him fast. For an\r\ninstant his life was in the utmost peril, surrounded by thirty or forty\r\nIndians, their knives drawn, and brandishing them over his head with\r\nfrantic gestures, and calling out to the chief, \"Shall we strike? Shall\r\nwe strike?\"\r\n\r\nThe chief hesitated, and at this critical moment the interpreter's wife\r\n(daughter of an old trader, James McDougall) stepped forward, and by her\r\npresence of mind saved him and the establishment.\r\n\r\n\"Observing one of the inferior chiefs, who had always professed the\r\ngreatest friendship for the whites, standing in the crowd, she addressed\r\nherself to him, exclaiming, 'What! you a friend of the whites, and not\r\nsay a word in their behalf at such a time as this! Speak! You know the\r\nmurderer deserved to die; according to your own laws the deed was just;\r\nit is blood for blood. The white men are not dogs; they love their own\r\nkindred as well as you; why should they not avenge their murder?'\"\r\n\r\nThe moment the heroine's voice was heard the tumult subsided; her\r\nboldness struck the savages with awe. The chief she addressed, acting\r\non her suggestion, interfered, and being seconded by the old chief, who\r\nhad no serious intention of injuring the whites, and was satisfied with\r\nshowing them that they were fairly in his power, Douglas and his men\r\nwere set at liberty, and an amicable conference having taken place, the\r\nIndians departed much elated with the issue of their enterprise.\r\n\r\nDouglas spent his four years in the interior in a most interesting and\r\nenergetic life. The experience there gained was invaluable in his after\r\ncareer as a fur trader. In 1826, at Bear Lake, at the head of a branch\r\nof the River Skeena, he built a fort, which he named Fort Connolly, in\r\nhonour of his superior officer, the chief of the Pacific department.\r\nOther forts in this region date their origin to Douglas's short stay in\r\nthis part of the mountains. Douglas also had an \"affair of the heart\"\r\nwhile at Fort St. James. Young and impressionable, he fell in love with\r\nNellie, the daughter of Mr. Connolly, a young \"daughter of the country,\"\r\naged sixteen. She became his wife and survived him as Lady Douglas.\r\n\r\nHis life of adventure in the Rocky Mountains came to an end by the\r\nsummons of Chief Factor McLoughlin to appear at Fort Vancouver, the\r\nchief point of the Company's trade on the Pacific slope. In two years\r\nmore the rising young officer became chief trader, and three years\r\nafterward he had reached the high dignity of chief factor. His chief\r\nwork was to establish forts, superintend the trade in its different\r\ndepartments, and inspect the forts at least annually. His vigilance and\r\nenergy were surprising. He became so noted that it was said of him: \"He\r\nwas one of the most enterprising and inquisitive of men, famous for his\r\nintimate acquaintance with every service of the coast.\"\r\n\r\nThough James Douglas rose by well marked tokens of leadership to the\r\nchief place on the Pacific Coast, yet the men associated with him were\r\na worthy and able band. His friend, Chief Factor Dr. John McLoughlin,\r\nwho had been his patron, was a man of excellent ability. McLoughlin was\r\nof a sympathetic and friendly disposition, and took an interest in the\r\nsettlement of the fertile valley of the Columbia. His course seems to\r\nhave been disapproved of by the London Committee of the Company, and his\r\nplace was given to Douglas, after which he spent his life in Oregon. His\r\nwork and influence cannot, however, be disregarded. He passed through\r\nmany adventures and dangers. He was fond of show, and had a manner\r\nwhich might well recommend him to Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nFrom a trader's journal we learn: \"McLoughlin and his suite would\r\nsometimes accompany the south-bound expeditions from Fort Vancouver,\r\nin regal state, for fifty or one hundred miles up the Willamette, when\r\nhe would dismiss them with his blessing and return to the fort. He did\r\nnot often travel, and seldom far; but on these occasions he indulged\r\nhis men rather than himself in some little variety.... It pleased\r\nMrs. McLoughlin thus to break the monotony of her fort life. Upon a\r\ngaily-caparisoned steed, with silver trappings and strings of bells on\r\nbridle reins and saddle skirt, sat the lady of Fort Vancouver, herself\r\narrayed in brilliant colours and wearing a smile which might cause\r\nto blush and hang its head the broadest, warmest, and most fragrant\r\nsunflower. By her side, also gorgeously attired, rode her lord, king of\r\nthe Columbia, and every inch a king, attended by a train of trappers,\r\nunder a chief trader, each upon his best behaviour.\"\r\n\r\nBut a group of men, notable and competent, gathered around these two\r\nleaders of the fur trade on the Pacific Coast. These comprised Roderick\r\nFinlayson, John Work, A. C. Anderson, W. F. Tolmie, John Tod, S.\r\nBlack, and others. These men, in charge of important posts, were local\r\nmagnates, and really, gathered together in council, determined the\r\npolicy of the Company along the whole coast.\r\n\r\nIn 1827 the spirit of extension of the trading operations took\r\npossession of the Hudson's Bay Company. In that year the officers at\r\nFort Vancouver saw arrive from the Thames the schooner _Cadboro_,\r\nseventy-two tons burthen. She became as celebrated on the Pacific\r\nCoast as any prominent fur trader could have become. It was said of\r\nthis good ship, \"She saw buried every human body brought by her from\r\nEngland, save one, John Spence, ship carpenter.\" Her arrival at this\r\ntime was the occasion for an expedition to occupy the Lower Fraser with\r\na trading post. John McMillan commanded the expedition of twenty-five\r\nmen. Leaving Fort Vancouver in boats, and, after descending the Columbia\r\nfor a distance, crossing the country to Puget's Sound, they met the\r\n_Cadboro_, which had gone upon her route. Transported to the mouth of\r\nthe Fraser River, which empties into the Gulf of Georgia, they, with\r\nsome difficulty, ascended the river and planted Fort Langley, where in\r\nthe first season of trade a fair quantity of beaver was purchased, and\r\na good supply of deer and elk meat was brought in by the hunters. The\r\nfounding of Fort Langley meant virtually the taking hold of what we now\r\nknow as the mainland of British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe reaching out in trade was not favoured by the Indians of the\r\nColumbia. Two years after the founding of Fort Langley, a Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany ship from London, the _William and Ann_, was wrecked at the\r\nmouth of the Columbia River. The survivors were murdered by the Indians,\r\nand the cargo was seized and secreted by the savage wreckers. Chief\r\nFactor McLoughlin sent to the Indians, demanding the restoration of the\r\nstolen articles. An old broom was all that was brought to the fort, and\r\nthis was done in a spirit of derision. The schooner _Vancouver_--the\r\nfirst ship of that name--(150 tons burthen), built on the coast, was\r\nwrecked five years after, and became a total loss.\r\n\r\nIn the same year as the wreck of the _William and Ann_, it was strongly\r\nimpressed upon the traders that a sawmill should be erected to supply\r\nthe material for building new vessels. Chief Factor McLoughlin\r\ndetermined to push this on. He chose as a site a point on the Willamette\r\nRiver, a tributary of the Columbia from the south, where Oregon city\r\nnow stands. He began a farm in connection with the mill, and in a\r\nyear or two undertook the construction of the mill race by blasting\r\nin the rock, and erected cottages for his men and new settlers. The\r\nIndians, displeased with the signs of permanent residence, burnt\r\nMcLoughlin's huts. It is said it was this enterprise that turned the\r\nHudson's Bay Company Committee in London against the veteran trader.\r\nYears afterwards, Edward Ellice, the fur-trade magnate residing in\r\nEngland, said, \"Dr. McLoughlin was rather an amphibious and independent\r\npersonage. He was a very able man, and, I believe, a very good man; but\r\nhe had a fancy that he would like to have interests in both countries,\r\nboth in United States and in English territory.... While he remained\r\nwith the Hudson's Bay Company he was an excellent servant.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the traders far up in the interior, in command of Fort Kamloops,\r\nwhich was at the junction of the North and South Thompson, was a\r\nScotchman named Samuel Black. There came as a visitor to his fort a man\r\nof science and a countryman of his own. This man was David Douglas.\r\nHe was an enthusiast in the search for plants and birds. He was\r\nindefatigable as a naturalist, did much service to the botany of Western\r\nAmerica, and has his name preserved in the characteristic tree of the\r\nPacific slope--the Douglas Fir. Douglas, on visiting Black, was very\r\nfirm in the expression of his opinions against the Company, saying, \"The\r\nHudson's Bay Company is simply a mercenary corporation; there is not an\r\nofficer in it with a soul above a beaver's skin.\" Black's Caledonian\r\nblood was roused, for he was a leading spirit among the traders, having\r\non the union of the Companies been presented with a ring with the\r\ninscription on it, \"To the most worthy of the worthy Nor'-Westers.\" He\r\nchallenged the botanist to a duel. The scientist deferred the meeting\r\ntill the morning, but early next day Black tapped at the parchment\r\nwindow of the room where Douglas was sleeping, crying, \"Mister Douglas,\r\nare ye ready?\" Douglas disregarded the invitation. David Douglas some\r\ntime after visited Hawaii, where, in examining the snares for catching\r\nwild cattle, he fell into the pit, and was trampled to death by a wild\r\nbullock.\r\n\r\nThe death of Samuel Black was tragic. In 1841, Tranquille, a chief of\r\nthe Shushwaps, who dwelt near Kamloops, died. The friends of the chief\r\nblamed the magic or \"evil medicine\" of the white man for his death. A\r\nnephew of Tranquille waited his opportunity and shot Chief Trader Black.\r\nThe Hudson's Bay Company was aroused to most vigorous action. A writer\r\nsays: \"The murderer escaped. The news spread rapidly to the neighbouring\r\nposts. The natives were scarcely less disturbed than the white men.\r\nThe act was abhorred, even by the friends and relatives of Tranquille.\r\nAnderson was at Nisqually at the time. Old John Tod came over from Fort\r\nAlexandria, McLean from Fort Colville, and McKinley and Ermatinger from\r\nFort Okanagan. From Fort Vancouver McLoughlin sent men.... Cameron was\r\nto assist Tod in taking charge of Kamloops. All traffic was stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Tod informed the assembled Shushwaps that the murderer must be\r\ndelivered up. The address of Nicola, chief of the Okanagans, gives a\r\nfine example of Indian eloquence. He said: 'The winter is cold. On all\r\nthe hills around the deer are plenty; and yet I hear your children\r\ncrying for food. Why is this? You ask for powder and ball, they refuse\r\nyou with a scowl. Why do the white men let your children starve? Look\r\nthere! Beneath yon mound of earth lies him who was your friend, your\r\nfather. The powder and ball he gave you that you might get food for your\r\nfamishing wives and children, you turned against him. Great heavens!\r\nAnd are the Shushwaps such cowards, dastardly to shoot their benefactor\r\nin the back while his face was turned? Yes, alas, you have killed your\r\nfather! A mountain has fallen! The earth is shaken! The sun is darkened!\r\nMy heart is sad. I cannot look at myself in the glass. I cannot look at\r\nyou, my neighbours and friends. He is dead, and we poor Indians shall\r\nnever see his like again. He was just and generous. His heart was larger\r\nthan yonder mountain, and clearer than the waters of the lake. Warriors\r\ndo not weep, but sore is my breast, and our wives shall wail for him.\r\nWherefore did you kill him? But you did not. You loved him. And now you\r\nmust not rest until you have brought to justice his murderer.'\r\n\r\n\"The old man was so rigid in expression that his whole frame and\r\nfeatures seemed turned to stone.\r\n\r\n\"Archibald McKinley said, 'Never shall I forget it; it was the grandest\r\nspeech I ever heard.'\r\n\r\n\"The murderer was soon secured and placed in irons, but in crossing a\r\nriver he succeeded in upsetting the boat in the sight of Nicola and his\r\nassembled Indians. The murderer floated down the stream, but died, his\r\ndeath song hushed by the crack of rifles from the shore.\"\r\n\r\nThus by courage and prudence, alas! not without the sacrifice of\r\nvaluable lives, was the power of the Hudson's Bay Company and the\r\nprestige of Great Britain established on the Pacific Coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nFROM OREGON TO VANCOUVER ISLAND.\r\n\r\n     Fort Vancouver on American soil--Chief Factor Douglas\r\n     chooses a new site--Young McLoughlin killed--Liquor selling\r\n     prohibited--Dealing with the Songhies--A Jesuit father--Fort\r\n     Victoria--Finlayson's skill--Chinook jargon--The brothers\r\n     Ermatinger--A fur-trading Junius--\"Fifty-four, forty, or\r\n     fight\"--Oregon Treaty--Hudson's Bay Company indemnified--The waggon\r\n     road--A colony established--First governor--Gold fever--British\r\n     Columbia--Fort Simpson--Hudson's Bay Company in the interior--The\r\n     forts--A group of worthies--Service to Britain--The coast become\r\n     Canadian.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Columbia River grew to be a source of wealth to the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany. Its farming facilities were great, and its products afforded\r\na large store for supplying the Russian settlements of Alaska. But as\r\non the Red River, so here the influx of agricultural settlers sounded a\r\nnote of warning to the fur trader that his day was soon to pass away.\r\nWith the purpose of securing the northern trade, Fort Langley had been\r\nbuilt on the Fraser River. The arrival of Sir George Simpson on the\r\ncoast on his journey round the world was the occasion of the Company\r\ntaking a most important step in order to hold the trade of Alaska.\r\n\r\nIn the year following Sir George's visit, Chief Factor Douglas crossed\r\nPuget Sound and examined the southern extremity of Vancouver Island\r\nas to its suitability for the erection of a new fort to take the\r\nplace in due time of Fort Vancouver. Douglas found an excellent site,\r\nclose beside the splendid harbour of Esquimalt, and reported to the\r\nassembled council of chief factors and traders at Fort Vancouver that\r\nthe advantages afforded by the site, especially that of its contiguity\r\nto the sea, would place the new fort, for all their purposes, in a much\r\nbetter position than Fort Vancouver. The enterprise was accordingly\r\ndetermined on for the next season.\r\n\r\nA tragic incident took place at this time on the Pacific Coast, which\r\ntended to make the policy of expansion adopted appear to be a wise and\r\nreasonable one. This was the violent death of a young trader, the son\r\nof Chief Trader McLoughlin, at Fort Taku on the coast of Alaska, in the\r\nterritory leased from the Russians by the Hudson's Bay Company. The\r\nmurder was the result of a drunken dispute among the Indians, in which,\r\naccidentally, young McLoughlin had been shot.\r\n\r\nSir George Simpson had just returned to the fort from his visit to the\r\nSandwich Islands, and was startled at seeing the Russian and British\r\nships, with flags at half-mast, on account of the young trader's death.\r\nThe Indians, on the arrival of the Governor, expressed the greatest\r\npenitence, but the stern Lycurgus could not be appeased, and this\r\ncalamity, along with one of a similar kind, which had shortly before\r\noccurred on the Stikine River, led Sir George Simpson and the Russian\r\nGovernor Etholin to come to an agreement to discontinue at once the\r\nsale of spirituous liquor in trading with the Indians. The Indians for\r\na time resorted to every device, such as withholding their furs unless\r\nliquor was given them, but the traders were unyielding, and the trade on\r\nthe coast became safer and more profitable on account of the disuse of\r\nstrong drink.\r\n\r\nThe decision to build a new fort having been reached in the next spring,\r\nthe moving spirit of the trade on the coast, James Douglas, with fifteen\r\nmen, fully supplied with food and necessary implements, crossed in the\r\n_Beaver_ from Nisqually, like another Eneas leaving his untenable city\r\nbehind to build a new Troy elsewhere. On the next day, March 13th, the\r\nvessel came to anchor opposite the new site.\r\n\r\nA graphic writer has given us the description of the beautiful spot:\r\n\"The view landwards was enchanting. Before them lay a vast body of land,\r\nupon which no white man then stood. Not a human habitation was in sight;\r\nnot a beast, scarcely a bird. Even the gentle murmur of the voiceless\r\nwood was drowned by the gentle beating of the surf upon the shore. There\r\nwas something specially charming, bewitching in the place. Though wholly\r\nnatural it did not seem so. It was not at all like pure art, but it was\r\nas though nature and art had combined to map out and make one of the\r\nmost pleasing prospects in the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe visitor looking at the City of Victoria in British Columbia to-day\r\nwill say that the description is in no way overdrawn. Not only is the\r\nsite one of the most charming on the earth, but as the spectator turns\r\nabout he is entranced with the view on the mainland, of Mount Olympia,\r\nso named by that doughty captain, John Meares, more than fifty years\r\nbefore the founding of this fort.\r\n\r\nThe place had been already chosen for a village and fortification by the\r\nresident tribe, the Songhies, and went by the Indian name of Camosun.\r\nThe Indian village was a mile distant from the entrance to the harbour.\r\nWhen the _Beaver_ came to anchor, a gun was fired, which caused a\r\ncommotion among the natives, who were afraid to draw near the intruding\r\nvessel. Next morning, however, the sea was alive with canoes of the\r\nSonghies.\r\n\r\nThe trader immediately landed, chose the site for his post, and found\r\nat a short distance tall and straight cedar-trees, which afforded\r\nmaterial for the stockades of the fort. Douglas explained to the Indians\r\nthe purpose of his coming, and held up to them bright visions of the\r\nbeautiful things he would bring them to exchange for their furs. He also\r\nemployed the Indians in obtaining for him the cedar posts needed for his\r\npalisades.\r\n\r\nThe trader showed his usual tact in employing a most potent means of\r\ngaining an influence over the savages by bringing the Jesuit Father\r\nBalduc, who had been upon the island before and was known to the\r\nnatives. Gathering the three tribes of the south of the island, the\r\nSonghies, Clallams, and Cowichins, into a great rustic chapel which had\r\nbeen prepared, Father Balduc held an impressive religious service, and\r\nshortly after visited a settlement of the Skagits, a thousand strong,\r\nand there too, in a building erected for public worship, performed the\r\nimportant religious rites of his Church before the wondering savages.\r\n\r\nIt was the intention of the Hudson's Bay Company to make the new fort\r\nat Camosun, which they first called Fort Albert, and afterwards Fort\r\nVictoria--the name now borne by the city, the chief trading depôt on the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORT VICTORIA, B.C.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the buildings were well under way, Chief Factor Douglas\r\nsailed northward along the coast to re-arrange the trade. Fort Simpson,\r\nwhich was on the mainland, some fifteen degrees north of the new fort\r\nand situated between the Portland Canal and the mouth of the Skeena\r\nRiver, was to be retained as necessary for the Alaska trade, but the\r\npromising officer, Roderick Finlayson, a young Scotchman, who had shown\r\nhis skill and honesty in the northern post, was removed from it and\r\ngiven an important place in the new establishment. Living a useful and\r\nblameless life, he was allowed to see the new fort become before his\r\ndeath a considerable city. Charles Ross, the master of Fort McLoughlin,\r\nbeing senior to Finlayson, was for the time being placed in charge of\r\nthe new venture. The three minor forts, Taku, Stikine, and McLoughlin,\r\nwere now closed, and the policy of consolidation led to Fort Victoria at\r\nonce rising into importance.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the chief factor from his northern expedition, with\r\nall the employés and stores from the deserted posts, the work at Fort\r\nVictoria went on apace. The energetic master had now at his disposal\r\nfifty good men, and while some were engaged at the buildings--either\r\nstore-houses or dwellings--others built the defences. Two bastions\r\nof solid block work were erected, thirty feet high, and these were\r\nconnected by palisades or stockades of posts twenty feet high, driven\r\ninto the earth side by side. The natives encamped alongside the new\r\nwork, looked on with interest, but as they had not their wives and\r\nchildren with them, the traders viewed them with suspicion. On account\r\nof the watchfulness of the builders, the Indians, beyond a few acts of\r\npetty theft, did not interfere with the newcomers in their enterprise.\r\n\r\nThree months saw the main features of the fort completed. On\r\nentering the western gate of the fort, to the right was to be seen a\r\ncottage-shaped building, the post office, then the smithy; further\r\nalong the walls were the large store-house, carpenter's shop, men's\r\ndormitory, and the boarding-house for the raw recruits. Along the east\r\nwall were the chapel, chaplain's house, then the officers' dining-room,\r\nand cook-house attached. Along the north wall was a double row of\r\nstore-houses for furs and goods, and behind them the gunpowder magazine.\r\nIn the north-west corner was the cottage residence of the chief factor\r\nand his family.\r\n\r\nThe defences of the fort were important, consisting of two bastions on\r\nthe western angles, and these contained six or eight nine-pounders. The\r\nsouth tower was the real fort from which salutes were fired; the north\r\ntower was a prison; and near the western or front gate stood the belfry\r\nerection and on its top the flag-staff. Such was the first Fort Albert\r\nor Victoria.\r\n\r\nVictoria rapidly grew into notice, and in due time Roderick Finlayson,\r\nthe man of adaptation and force, on the death of his superior officer\r\nbecame chief factor in charge. The writer met the aged fur trader years\r\nafter he had retired from active service, and spent with him some hours\r\nof cheerful discourse. Large and commanding in form, Finlayson had\r\nthe marks of governing ability about him. He lacked the adroitness of\r\nMcLoughlin, the instability of Tod, and the genius of Douglas, but he\r\nwas a typical Scotchman, steady, patient, and trustworthy. Like an old\r\npatriarch, he spent his last days in Victoria, keeping a large extent of\r\nvacant city property in a common. Urged again and again to sell it when\r\nit had become valuable, the sturdy pioneer replied that he \"needed it to\r\npasture his 'coo.'\"\r\n\r\nOne of the things most striking in all the early traders was their\r\nability to master language. Many of the officers of the Company were\r\nable to speak four languages. On the Pacific Coast, on account of\r\nthe many Indian tongues differing much from each other, there grew\r\nup a language of commerce, known as the Chinook jargon. It was a\r\nmost remarkable phenomenon; it is still largely in use. The tribe\r\nmost familiar to the traders at the beginning of the century was the\r\nChinooks. English-speaking, French, and United States traders met with\r\nthem, and along with them the Kanakas, or Sandwich Island workmen, with\r\nmany bands of coast Indians.\r\n\r\nA trade has developed upon the Pacific Coast, the Chinook jargon has\r\ngrown, and now numbers some five hundred words. Of these, nearly half\r\nwere Chinook in origin, a number were from other Indian languages,\r\nalmost a hundred were French, and less than seventy English, while\r\nseveral were doubtful. The then leading elements among the traders were\r\nknown in the jargon as respectively, Pasai-ooks, French, a corruption\r\nof Français; King Chautchman (King George man), English; and Boston,\r\nAmerican. The following will show the origin and meaning of a few words,\r\nshowing changes made in consonants which the Indians cannot pronounce.\r\n\r\n   _French._        _Jargon._        _Meaning._\r\n  Le mouton.         Lemoots.         Sheep.\r\n  Chapeau.           Seahpo.          Hat.\r\n  Sauvage.           Siwash.          Indian.\r\n\r\n  _English._        _Jargon._        _Meaning._\r\n  Fire.              Piah.            Fire or cook.\r\n  Coffee.            Kaupy.           Coffee.\r\n  Handkerchief.      Hat'atshum.      Handkerchief.\r\n\r\n  _Chinook._        _Jargon._        _Meaning._\r\n  Tkalaitanam.       Kali-tan.        Arrow.\r\n  Thliakso.          Yokso.           Hair.\r\n    ----             Klootchman.      Woman.\r\n\r\nSongs, hymns, sermons, and translations of portions of the Bible are\r\nmade in the jargon, and used by missionaries and teachers. Several\r\ndictionaries of the dialect have been published.\r\n\r\nAmong the out-standing men who were contemporaries upon the Pacific\r\nCoast of Finlayson were the two brothers Ermatinger. Already it has\r\nbeen stated that they were nephews of the famous old trader of Sault\r\nSte. Marie. Their father had preferred England to Canada, and had gone\r\nthither. His two sons, Edward and Francis, were, as early as 1818,\r\napprenticed by their father to the Hudson's Bay Company and sent on the\r\nCompany's ship to Rupert's Land, by way of York Factory. Edward, whose\r\nautobiographical sketch, hitherto unpublished, lies before us, tells\r\nus that he spent ten years in the fur trade, being engaged at York\r\nFactory, Oxford House, Red River, and on the Columbia River. Desirous\r\nof returning to the service after he had gone back to Canada, he had\r\nreceived an appointment to Rupert's Land again from Governor Simpson.\r\nThis was cancelled by the Governor on account of a grievous quarrel\r\nwith old Charles, the young trader's uncle, on a sea voyage with the\r\nGovernor to Britain. For many years, however, Edward Ermatinger lived\r\nat St. Thomas, Ontario, where his son, the respected Judge Ermatinger,\r\nstill resides. The old gentleman became a great authority on Hudson's\r\nBay affairs, and received many letters from the traders, especially, it\r\nwould seem, from those who had grievances against the Company or against\r\nits strong-willed Governor.\r\n\r\nFrancis Ermatinger, the other brother, spent between thirty and forty\r\nyears in the Far West, especially on the Pacific Coast. An unpublished\r\njournal of Francis Ermatinger lies before us. It is a clear and vivid\r\naccount of an expedition to revenge the death of a trader, Alexander\r\nMackenzie, and four men who had been basely murdered (1828) by the tribe\r\nof Clallam Indians. The party, under Chief Factor Alexander McLeod,\r\nattacked one band of Indians and severely punished them; then from the\r\nship _Cadboro_ on the coast, a bombardment of the Indian village took\r\nplace, in which many of the tribe of the murderers were killed, but\r\nwhether the criminals suffered was never known.\r\n\r\nThat Francis Ermatinger was one of the most hardy, determined, and\r\ncapable of the traders is shown by a remarkable Journey made by him,\r\nunder orders from Sir George Simpson on his famous journey round the\r\nworld. Ermatinger had left Fort Vancouver in charge of a party of\r\ntrappers to visit the interior of California. Sir George, having heard\r\nof him in the upper waters of one of the rivers of the coast, ordered\r\nhim to meet him at Monterey. This Ermatinger undertook to do, and\r\nafter a terrific journey, crossing snowy chains of mountains, fierce\r\ntorrents in a country full of pitfalls, reached the imperious Governor.\r\nErmatinger had assumed the disguise of a Spanish caballero, and was\r\nrecognized by his superior officer with some difficulty. Ermatinger\r\nwrote numerous letters to his brothers in Canada, which contained\r\ndetails of the hard but exciting life he was leading.\r\n\r\nMost unique and peculiar of all the traders on the Pacific Coast was\r\nJohn Tod, who first appeared as a trader in the Selkirk settlement and\r\nwrote a number of the Hargrave letters. In 1823 he was sent by Governor\r\nSimpson, it is said, to New Caledonia as to the penal settlement of\r\nthe fur traders, but the young Scotchman cheerfully accepted his\r\nappointment. He became the most noted letter-writer of the Pacific\r\nCoast, indeed he might be called the prince of controversialists among\r\nthe traders. There lies before the writer a bundle of long letters\r\nwritten over a number of years by Tod to Edward Ermatinger. Tod,\r\nprobably for the sake of argument, advocated loose views as to the\r\nvalidity of the Scriptures, disbelief of many of the cardinal Christian\r\ndoctrines, and in general claimed the greatest latitude of belief. It is\r\nvery interesting to see how the solemn-minded and orthodox Ermatinger\r\nstrives to lead him into the true way. Tod certainly had little effect\r\nupon his faithful correspondent, and shows the greatest regard for his\r\nadmonitions.\r\n\r\nThe time of Sir George Simpson's visit to the coast on his journey round\r\nthe world was one of much agitation as to the boundary line between\r\nthe British and United States possessions on the Pacific Coast. By the\r\ntreaty of 1825 Russia and Britain had come to an agreement that the\r\nRussian strip along the coast should reach southward only to 54 deg.\r\n40´ N. lat. The United States mentioned its claim to the coast as far\r\nnorth as the Russian boundary. However preposterous it may seem, yet\r\nit was maintained by the advocates of the Monroe doctrine that Great\r\nBritain had no share of the coast at all. The urgency of the American\r\nclaim became so great that the popular mind seemed disposed to favour\r\ncontesting this claim with arms. Thus originated the famous saying,\r\n\"Fifty-four, forty, or fight.\" The Hudson's Bay Company was closely\r\nassociated with the dispute, the more that Fort Vancouver on the\r\nColumbia River might be south of the boundary line, though their action\r\nof building Fort Victoria was shown to be a wise and timely step. At\r\nlength in 1846 the treaty between Great Britain and the United States\r\nwas made and the boundary line established. The Oregon Treaty, known in\r\nsome quarters as the Ashburton Treaty, provided that the 49th parallel\r\nof latitude should on the mainland be the boundary, thus handing over\r\nFort Vancouver, Walla Walla, Colville, Nisqually, and Okanagan to the\r\nUnited States, and taking them from their rightful owners, the Hudson's\r\nBay Company. Article two of the great treaty, however, stated that the\r\nCompany should enjoy free navigation of the Columbia River, while the\r\nthird article provided that the possessory rights of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany and all other British subjects on the south side of the boundary\r\nline should be respected.\r\n\r\nThe decision in regard to the boundary led to changes in the Hudson's\r\nBay Company establishments. Dr. McLoughlin, having lost the confidence\r\nof the Company, threw in his lot with his United States home, and\r\nretired in the year of the treaty to Oregon City, where he died a\r\nfew years after. His name is remembered as that of an impulsive,\r\ngood-hearted, somewhat rash, but always well-meaning man.\r\n\r\nThough Fort Victoria became the depôt for the coast of the trade of\r\nthe Company, Fort Vancouver, with a reduced staff, was maintained for\r\na number of years by the Company. While under charge of Chief Trader\r\nWark, a part of the fields belonging to the Company at Fort Vancouver\r\nwere in a most high-handed manner seized by the United States for\r\nmilitary purposes. The senior officer, Mr. Grahame, on his return from\r\nan absence, protested against the invasion. In June, 1860, however,\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company withdrew from the Columbia. The great herd of\r\nwild cattle which had grown up on the Columbia were disposed of by the\r\nCompany to a merchant of Oregon. The Company thus retired to the British\r\nside of the boundary line during the three years closing with 1860.\r\n\r\nSteps were taken by the Hudson's Bay Company to obtain compensation from\r\nthe United States authorities. A long and wearisome investigation took\r\nplace; witnesses were called and great diversity of opinion prevailed as\r\nto the value of the interest of the Company in its forts. The Hudson's\r\nBay Company claimed indemnity amounting to the sum of 2,000,000 dols.\r\nWitnesses for the United States gave one-tenth of that amount as a fair\r\nvalue. Compensation of a moderate kind was at length made to the Company\r\nby the United States.\r\n\r\nOn its withdrawal from Oregon the Hudson's Bay Company decided on\r\nopening up communication with the interior of the mainland up the Fraser\r\nRiver. This was a task of no small magnitude, on account of the rugged\r\nand forbidding banks of this great river. A. Caulfield Anderson, an\r\nofficer who had been in the Company's service for some fourteen years\r\nbefore the date of the Oregon Treaty and was in charge of a post on the\r\nFraser River, was given the duty of finding the road to the interior.\r\nHe was successful in tracing a road from Fort Langley to Kamloops. The\r\nIndians offered opposition to Anderson, but he succeeded in spite of\r\nall hindrances, and though other routes were sought for and suggested,\r\nyet Anderson's road by way of the present town of Hope and Lake Nicola\r\nto Kamloops afterwards became one great waggon road to the interior. No\r\nsooner had the boundary line been fixed than agitation arose to prepare\r\nthe territory north of the line for a possible influx of agriculturists\r\nor miners and also to maintain the coast true to British connection. The\r\nHudson's Bay Company applied to the British Government for a grant of\r\nVancouver Island, which they held under a lease good for twelve years\r\nmore. Mr. Gladstone opposed the application, but considering it the best\r\nthing to be done in the circumstances, the Government made the grant\r\n(1847) to the Company under certain conditions. The Company agreed to\r\ncolonize the island, to sell the lands at moderate rates to settlers,\r\nand to apply nine-tenths of the receipts toward public improvements.\r\nThe Company entered heartily into the project, issued a prospectus\r\nfor settlers, and hoped in five years to have a considerable colony\r\nestablished on the Island.\r\n\r\nSteps were taken by the British Government to organize the new colony.\r\nThe head of the Government applied to the Governor of the Company to\r\nname a Governor. Chief Factor Douglas was suggested, but probably\r\nthinking an independent man would be more suitable, the Government gave\r\nthe appointment to a man of respectability, Richard Blanshard, in the\r\nend of 1849.\r\n\r\nThe new Governor arrived, but no preparations had been made for his\r\nreception. No salary was provided for his maintenance, and the attitude\r\nof the Hudson's Bay Company officially at Fort Victoria was decidedly\r\nlacking in heartiness. Governor Blanshard's position was nothing\r\nmore than an empty show. He issued orders and proclamations which\r\nwere disregarded. He visited Fort Rupert, which had been founded by\r\nthe Company on the north-east angle of the island, and there held an\r\ninvestigation of a murder of three sailors by the Newitty Indians.\r\nGovernor Blanshard spent much of his time writing pessimistic reports\r\nof the country to Britain, and after a residence of a year and a half\r\nreturned to England, thoroughly soured on account of his treatment by\r\nthe officers of the Company.\r\n\r\nThe colonization of Vancouver Island proved very slow. A company of\r\nminers for Nanaimo, and another of farmers from Sooke, near Victoria,\r\ncame, but during Governor Blanshard's rule only one _bonâ-fide_ sale\r\nof land was made, and five years after the cession to the Company\r\nthere were less than five hundred colonists. Chief Factor Douglas\r\nsucceeded to the governorship and threw his accustomed energy into his\r\nadministration. The cry of monopoly, ever a popular one, was raised,\r\nand inasmuch as the colony was not increasing sufficiently to satisfy\r\nthe Imperial Government, the great Committee of the House of Commons\r\nof 1857 was appointed to examine the whole relation of the Company to\r\nRupert's Land and the Indian territories. The result of the inquiry was\r\nthat it was decided to relieve the Hudson's Bay Company of the charge of\r\nVancouver Island at the time of expiry of their lease. The Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany thus withdrew on the Pacific Coast to the position of a private\r\ntrading company, though Sir James Douglas, who was knighted in 1863,\r\ncontinued Governor of the Crown Colony of Vancouver Island, with the\r\nadded responsibility of the territory on the mainland.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the gold discovery in the mainland called much\r\nattention to the country. Thousands of miners rushed at once to the\r\nBritish possessions on the Pacific Coast. Fort Victoria, from being a\r\nlonely traders' post, grew as if by magic into a city. Thousands of\r\nminers betook themselves to the Fraser River, and sought the inland\r\ngold-fields. All this compelled a more complete organization than the\r\nmere oversight of the mainland by Governor Douglas in his capacity as\r\nhead of the fur trade. Accordingly the British Government determined to\r\nrelieve the Hudson's Bay Company of responsibility for the mainland,\r\nwhich they held under a licence soon to expire, and to erect New\r\nCaledonia and the Indian territories of the coast into a separate Crown\r\nColony under the name of British Columbia. In Lord Lytton's dispatches\r\nto Governor Douglas, to whom the governorship of both of the colonies\r\nof Vancouver Island and British Columbia was offered, the condition is\r\nplainly stated that he would be required to sever his connection with\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company and the Puget Sound Agricultural Company,\r\nand to be independent of all local interests. Here we leave Sir James\r\nDouglas immersed in his public duties of governing the two colonies,\r\nwhich in time became one province under the name of British Columbia,\r\nthus giving up the guidance of the fur-trading stations for whose\r\nup-building he had striven for fifty years.\r\n\r\nThe posts of the Hudson's Bay Company on the Pacific Coast in 1857\r\nwere:--\r\n\r\n  _Vancouver Island_--\r\n        Fort Victoria.\r\n        Fort Rupert.\r\n        Nanaimo.\r\n\r\n  _Fraser River_--\r\n        Fort Langley.\r\n\r\n  _Thompson River_--\r\n        Kamloops.\r\n        Fort Hope.\r\n\r\n  _North-West Coast_--\r\n        Fort Simpson.\r\n\r\n  _New Caledonia_--\r\n        Stuart Lake.\r\n        McLeod Lake.\r\n        Fraser Lake.\r\n        Alexandria.\r\n        Fort George.\r\n        Babines.\r\n        Connolly Lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nPRO GLORIA DEI.\r\n\r\n     A vast region--First spiritual adviser--A _locum tenens_--Two\r\n     French Canadian priests--St. Boniface founded--Missionary\r\n     zeal in Mackenzie River district--Red River parishes--The\r\n     great Archbishop Taché--John West--Archdeacon Cochrane, the\r\n     founder--John McCallum--Bishop Anderson--English Missionary\r\n     Societies--Archbishop Machray--Indian Missions--John Black, the\r\n     Presbyterian apostle--Methodist Missions on Lake Winnipeg--The\r\n     Cree syllabic--Chaplain Staines--Bishop Cridge--Missionary\r\n     Duncan--Metlakahtla--Roman Catholic coast missions--Church of\r\n     England bishop--Diocese of New Westminster--Dr. Evans--Robert\r\n     Jamieson--Education.\r\n\r\n\r\nWherever British influence has gone throughout the world the Christian\r\nfaith of the British people has followed. It is true, for one hundred\r\nand fifty years the ships to Hudson Bay crossed regularly to the\r\nforts on the Bay, and beyond certain suggestions as to service to the\r\nemployés, no recognition of religion took place on Hudson Bay, and no\r\nChristian clergyman or missionary visitor found his way thither. The\r\nCompany was primarily a trading company, its forts were far apart, and\r\nthere were few men at any one point.\r\n\r\nThe first heralds of the Cross, indeed, to reach Rupert's Land were the\r\nFrench priests who accompanied Verendrye, though they seem to have made\r\nno settlements in the territory. It is said that after the conquest\r\nof Canada, when the French traders had withdrawn from the North-West,\r\nexcept a few traditions in one of the tribes, no trace of Christianity\r\nwas left behind.\r\n\r\nThe first clergyman to arrive in Rupert's Land was in connection with\r\nLord Selkirk's colony in 1811. A party of Lord Selkirk's first colonists\r\nhaving come from Sligo, the founder sent one Father Bourke to accompany\r\nthe party to Red River. The wintering at York Factory seems to have\r\ndeveloped some unsatisfactory traits in the spiritual adviser, and he\r\ndid not proceed further than the shore of the Bay, but returned to his\r\nnative land.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of providing certain spiritual oversight for his Scottish\r\ncolonists occupied Lord Selkirk's mind. In 1815 James Sutherland, an\r\nelder authorized by the Church of Scotland to baptize and marry, arrived\r\nwith one of the bands of colonists at Red River. The first point in\r\nthe agreement between Lord Selkirk and his colonists was \"to have the\r\nservices of a minister of their own church.\" This was Lord Selkirk's\r\nwish, and Mr. Sutherland was sent as _locum tenens_. For three years\r\nthis devout man performed the duties of his sacred office, until in\r\nthe conflict between the rival Companies he was forcibly taken away to\r\nCanada by the North-West Company.\r\n\r\nLord Selkirk entered into correspondence with the Roman Catholic\r\nauthorities in Lower Canada as to their appointing priests to take\r\ncharge of the French and De Meurons of his colony. We have already seen\r\nin the sketch of John McLeod that two French priests, Joseph Norbert\r\nProvencher and Sévère Dumoulin, proceeded to the North-West and took\r\nup a position on the east side of Red River nearly opposite the site\r\nof the demolished Fort Gibraltar. On account of the preponderance of\r\nthe German-speaking De Meurons, the settlement was called St. Boniface,\r\nafter the German patron saint. Though these pioneer priests endured\r\nhardships and poverty, they energetically undertook their work, and\r\nmaintained a school in which, shortly after, we are told, there were\r\nscholars in the \"Humanities.\"\r\n\r\nWith great zeal the Roman Catholic Church has carried its missions to\r\nthe Indians, even to distant Athabasca and Mackenzie River. In 1822\r\nthe Priest Provencher was made a bishop under the title of Bishop\r\nof Juliopolis (_in partibus infidelium_). His jurisdiction included\r\nRupert's Land and the North-West or Indian territories. Besides the work\r\namong the Indians, the Bishop organized the French settlements along the\r\nRed and Assiniboine Rivers into parishes. In addition to St. Boniface,\r\nsome of these were St. Norbert, St. François Xavier, St. Charles, St.\r\nVital, and the like, until, at the close of the Hudson's Bay Company's\r\nrule in 1869, there were nine French parishes.\r\n\r\nThe Indian missions have been largely carried on by a Society of the\r\nRoman Catholic Church known as the Oblate Fathers. A sisterhood of the\r\nGrey Nuns have also taken a strong hold of the North-West.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1844 a young French priest named Alexandre Antonin Taché\r\ncame to the North-West and led the way in carrying the faith among\r\nthe Indians of the Mackenzie River. A most interesting work of Father\r\nTaché, called \"Vingt Années de Missions,\" gives the life and trials of\r\nthis devoted missionary. In a few years the young priest was appointed\r\ncoadjutor of Bishop Provencher, and on the death of that prelate in\r\n1853, young Monseigneur Taché succeeded to the see under the name of\r\nthe Bishop of St. Boniface. Bishop Taché became a notable man of the\r\nRed River settlement. He was a man of much breadth of view, kindliness\r\nof manner, and of great religious zeal. As an educational and public\r\nman, he wielded, during the whole time of the Hudson's Bay Company's\r\nlater régime, a potent influence. A year or two after the elevation of\r\nBishop Taché to the vacant place of Bishop Provencher, Bishop Grandin\r\nwas appointed a bishop of the interior and took up his abode at Ile à la\r\nCrosse. The Roman Catholic Church has done much in bringing many wild\r\ntribes under the civilizing influence of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThough Lord Selkirk was compelled to betake himself to France in 1820\r\nin search of health, he did not forget his promise to his Scottish\r\ncolonists on Red River. He entrusted the task of procuring a clergyman\r\nfor them to Mr. John Pritchard, who, we have seen, had entered the\r\nservice of his Lordship. Pritchard, acting under the direction of the\r\ncommittee of the Hudson's Bay Company, seems to have taken a course that\r\nLord Selkirk would hardly have approved. To some extent disregarding the\r\npromise made to the Scottish settlers, either the agent or the committee\r\napplied to the Church Missionary Society to appoint a chaplain for the\r\nHudson's Bay Company at Red River.\r\n\r\nThe choice made was a most judicious one, being that of Rev. John\r\nWest, who wrote a very readable book on his experiences, in which the\r\ncondition of the settlement, along with an account of his missionary\r\nlabours, are described. A little volume, written by Miss Tucker, under\r\nthe name of \"The Rainbow of the North,\" also gives an interesting\r\naccount of the founding of the Protestant faith in the settlement.\r\n\r\nMr. West arrived in Red River settlement in October, 1820, and at once\r\nbegan his labours by holding services in Fort Garry. For a time he was\r\nfully occupied in marrying many who had formerly lived as man and wife,\r\nthough already married after the Indian fashion, and in baptizing the\r\nchildren. He at once opened a school. Mr. West made an exploratory\r\njourney five or six hundred miles westward, visiting Indian tribes. In\r\n1823 he erected the first Protestant place of worship on the Red River,\r\nand in the same year was joined by Rev. David Jones, who was left in\r\ncharge when Mr. West returned to England.\r\n\r\nTwo years afterwards Rev. William Cochrane and his wife arrived at\r\nRed River. Mr. Cochrane, afterward Archdeacon Cochrane, was a man of\r\nstriking personality, and to him has been given the credit of laying\r\nthe foundation of the Church of England in the Red River settlement.\r\nThe Indians to the north of the settlement on Red River were visited\r\nand yielded readily to the solicitations of the missionaries. Early\r\namong these self-denying Indian missionaries was the Rev. A., afterwards\r\nArchdeacon, Cowley. Churches were erected in the parishes that were set\r\napart in the same way as the French parishes; St. John's, St. Paul's,\r\nSt. Andrew's, St. Clement's, St. James, Headingly, and the like, to the\r\nnumber of ten, were each provided with church and school.\r\n\r\nRev. Mr. Jones did not neglect the educational interests of his wide\r\ncharge. Having become convinced of the necessity of establishing a\r\nboarding-school to meet the wants of the scattered families of Rupert's\r\nLand, Mr. Jones brought out Mr. John McCallum, a student of King's\r\nCollege, Aberdeen, who had found his way to London. Coming to Red River\r\nin 1833, McCallum began the school which has since become St. John's\r\nCollege. At first this school was under the Church Missionary Society,\r\nbut a decade after its founding it was conducted by McCallum himself,\r\nwith an allowance from the Company.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 an episcopal visit was made to Red River by the first Protestant\r\nBishop who could reach the remote spot. This was Dr. Mountain, Bishop\r\nof Montreal. He published a small work giving an account of his visit.\r\nMany confirmations took place by the Bishop, and Mr. Cowley was made a\r\npriest. John McCallum had taken such a hold upon the Selkirk settlers\r\nthat it was deemed advisable to ordain him, and for several years he\r\ncarried on the school along with the incumbency of the parish church.\r\nMcCallum only lived for five years after the Bishop's visit.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 James Leith, a wealthy chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company,\r\nbequeathed in his will twelve thousand pounds to be expended for the\r\nbenefit of the Indian missions in Rupert's Land. Leith's family bitterly\r\nopposed this disposition of their patrimony, but the Master of the\r\nRolls, hearing that the Hudson's Bay Company was willing to add three\r\nhundred pounds annually to the interest accruing from the Leith bequest,\r\ngave the decision against them, and thus secured an income to the see of\r\nseven hundred pounds a year. In 1849 the diocese of Rupert's Land was\r\nestablished by the Crown, and Rev. David Anderson, of Oxford University,\r\nwas consecrated first Bishop of Rupert's Land. In the autumn of the same\r\nyear Bishop Anderson arrived at Red River, by way of York Factory, and\r\nhis first public duty was to conduct the funeral of the lamented John\r\nMcCallum. After an incumbency of fifteen years Bishop Anderson returned\r\nto England and resigned the bishopric.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 Dr. Robert Machray arrived at Red River, having been consecrated\r\nBishop by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Under Bishop Anderson the\r\ncollege successfully begun by McCallum languished, for the Bishop seemed\r\nmore intent on mission work than education. In the year after his\r\narrival, Bishop Machray revived the institution under the name of St.\r\nJohn's College. It was of much service to the colony.\r\n\r\nBy the time of the passing away of the power of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany, four years after the arrival of Bishop Machray, substantial\r\nstone churches and school-houses had been erected in almost all of\r\nthe parishes mentioned as organized by the Church of England. To the\r\nChurch of England belonged nearly all the English-speaking half-breed\r\npopulation of the colony, as well as a large number of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany officers.\r\n\r\nBishop Machray's diocese covered a vast area. From Hudson Bay to the\r\nRocky Mountains was under his jurisdiction. Much work was done amongst\r\nthe Indian tribes. At Moose Factory on the Bay, another devoted labourer\r\nwas working diligently. It is true the missions were widely scattered,\r\nbut of the twenty-four clergymen belonging to the diocese of Rupert's\r\nLand, fifteen were among the Indians at the time of the cessation of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company's rule. The remainder were in the parishes of Red\r\nRiver such as St. John's, St. Andrew's, St. Paul's, Headingly, Poplar\r\nPoint, and Portage la Prairie.\r\n\r\nThe assistance rendered not only by the Church Missionary Society, but\r\nalso by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts,\r\nthe Colonial and Continental Church Society, and the Society for the\r\nPromotion of Christian Knowledge, was very great, and future generations\r\nwill be indebted to the benevolence and liberality of the English people\r\nin sending spiritual assistance to Rupert's Land.\r\n\r\nA perusal of the work, \"Red River Settlement,\" by Alexander Ross, shows\r\nthat a long and somewhat disappointing struggle was maintained by the\r\nSelkirk settlers to obtain the fulfilment of Lord Selkirk's promise to\r\nsend them a minister of their own faith. Scottish governors came and\r\ndeparted, but no Scottish minister came. Sir George Simpson arrived\r\non his yearly visits at Fort Garry, and was often interviewed by the\r\nsettlers of Kildonan, but the Governor, though pleasant and plausible\r\nenough, was impenetrable as the sphinx. Petitions were sent to the\r\nHudson's Bay Company and to the Scottish General Assembly, but they\r\nseldom reached their destination and effected nothing.\r\n\r\nThe people conformed to the service of the Church of England in the\r\nvicinity of their parish. They were treated by the Episcopal clergy with\r\nmuch consideration. Their own psalter was used in their worship, the\r\nservice was made as simple as they could well desire, but the people,\r\nwith Highland tenacity, held to their own tenets for forty years, and\r\nmaintained among themselves regular cottage meetings for prayer and\r\npraise.\r\n\r\nAt length the question arose as to the possession of the church property\r\nand the right of burial in St. John's burial-ground. The Scottish\r\nsettlers maintained their right to the church and churchyard. A very\r\nacrimonious discussion arose. In the end the matter was referred to\r\nMr. Eden Colville, a Company director, who was in the settlement on\r\nbusiness. Mr. Colville informed the writer that he claimed the credit\r\nof settling the dispute. Another site on the river bank two or three\r\nmiles to the north of St. John's, called La Grenouillère, or Frog Plain,\r\nconsisting of several hundred acres, was handed over to the Scottish\r\nsettlers for church, manse, and glebe. This was in 1851, and though the\r\nKildonan people were still given the right to bury their dead in St.\r\nJohn's, in the future their chief interest centred in the new plot.\r\n\r\nThe presence in Red River of Mr. Ballenden, a countryman of the\r\nKildonan people, as Hudson's Bay Company Governor of Fort Garry, led\r\nto an application being made to their friends in Scotland to send\r\nthem a minister. Indeed, the call had been made again and again for a\r\ngeneration. This request was transmitted to Canada to Dr. Robert Burns,\r\na man of warm missionary zeal and great wisdom. Sir George Simpson\r\nhad been communicated with, and deemed it wise to reverse his former\r\npolicy of inaction and promised certain aid and countenance, should a\r\nPresbyterian minister be found to care for the parish of Kildonan.\r\n\r\nDr. Burns had among his acquaintances a recent graduate of Knox\r\nCollege, Toronto, named John Black. Him the zealous doctor urged, if\r\nnot commanded, to go to Red River. This trust was accepted, and after\r\na tedious and uncertain journey Rev. John Black arrived at Red River,\r\nSeptember, 1851. The Kildonan people immediately rallied around their\r\nnew clergyman, who, though not able to speak Gaelic as they desired, yet\r\nbecame an idol to his people. In 1853 a church was erected, with the aid\r\nof a small grant from the Hudson's Bay Company, and the foundations of\r\nPresbyterianism were laid.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 Rev. James Nisbet, who had come a few years before to assist Mr.\r\nBlack, organized a mission to the Cree Indians, and named his mission\r\nchurch on the banks of the Saskatchewan, Prince Albert. Growing by slow\r\ndegrees, the Presbyterian interest increased and was represented at\r\nthe end of the Hudson's Bay Company's rule by four or five clergymen.\r\nSchools as maintained by voluntary contributions were erected in the\r\nPresbyterian parishes of Kildonan and Little Britain.\r\n\r\nManitoba College was planned and arranged for in the closing year of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company's régime.\r\n\r\nThe Methodists, with the fervour and missionary zeal which has always\r\ncharacterized them, determined to aid in evangelizing the Indians\r\nof Rupert's Land. It was the English Methodists who first showed a\r\ndesire in this direction. They agreed to send the Indians a clergyman\r\nsuited for the work, if the Canadian Methodist Church would send a few\r\nlabourers trained in Indian work in Canada.\r\n\r\nJames Evans, an Englishman who had been long in Canada, and had\r\nlaboured for years among the Indians of Upper Canada, consented to go\r\nto Rupert's Land and take the superintendence of the others sent out.\r\nLeaving Montreal with the three English missionaries and two educated\r\nyoung Ojibways, Peter Jacobs and Henry B. Steinhauser, the party went\r\nby canoes up the lakes and then along the old fur traders' route,\r\nand arrived at Norway House, at the foot of Lake Winnipeg, in 1840.\r\nEvans made Norway House his headquarters, George Barnley went to Moose\r\nFactory, William Mason to Rainy Lake and River Winnipeg, and Robert T.\r\nRundle to Edmonton.\r\n\r\nThe missions to the Hudson Bay and Rainy Lake were soon given up, but\r\nRossville and Oxford House, on Lake Winnipeg, and several points near\r\nEdmonton, are the evidence to-day of the faithful self-denying work done\r\nby these early Methodist pioneers. Having no whites in the country, the\r\noperations of the Methodist Church in Rupert's Land were, up to the\r\ntime of the Hudson's Bay Company's transfer, confined to the Indians of\r\nRupert's Land.\r\n\r\nMr. Evans, the superintendent of these missions, became very celebrated\r\nby the invention of a syllabic system of writing introduced among the\r\nCrees. The plan is simple, and an intelligent Indian who has never seen\r\nthe system[5] can in a short time learn to read and write the syllabic.\r\nThe syllabic has spread widely over Rupert's Land, and the different\r\nChurches use, especially among the Crees, this ingenious invention in\r\nprinting the Bible and service books. When Lord Dufferin, a number of\r\nyears ago, visited the North-West as Governor-General of Canada, on\r\nhearing of Evans' invention he remarked, \"The nation has given many a\r\nman a title and a pension and a resting-place in Westminster Abbey who\r\nnever did half so much for his fellow-creatures.\"\r\n\r\nSome claim has been made for Mason as being the inventor of this\r\ncharacter, but there seems to be no ground for the claim.\r\n\r\nJohn Ryerson, a Canadian Methodist divine, in 1854 visited Rupert's Land\r\nfrom Canada, and after seeing the missions on Lake Winnipeg, went from\r\nYork Factory to England. The taking over of the mission by the Canadian\r\nMethodist Church resulted from this visit.\r\n\r\nThese are the main movements of a religious kind that took place within\r\nthe borders of Rupert's Land and the territories east of the Rocky\r\nMountains up to the end of the Hudson's Bay Company's régime. A great\r\nservice was rendered to the whites and Indians alike, to the Hudson's\r\nBay Company, to the Kildonan settlers, and all the native people by the\r\npatient work of the four churches named. The best feeling, and in many\r\ncases active co-operation, were given by these churches to each other.\r\nThe work done by these churches laid the foundation for the general\r\nmorality and advanced social life which prevailed in Red River and in\r\nthe regions beyond.\r\n\r\nOn the Pacific slope the Hudson's Bay Company took an immediate control\r\nof the religious and educational instruction of the people, upon the\r\norganization of Vancouver Island as a colony (1849). The Rev. Robert\r\nStaines was sent as chaplain and teacher to Fort Victoria, and was given\r\na salary and an allowance for carrying on a boarding-school in which he\r\nwas assisted by his wife. Mr. Staines did not agree with the Company,\r\nwent to Britain as a delegate from the dissatisfied employés, but died\r\nof injuries received on his homeward voyage.\r\n\r\nMr. Staines' successor was the Rev. Edward Cridge. The new chaplain was\r\nwell provided for by the Company, being secured a parsonage and glebe of\r\none hundred acres, and three hundred pounds a year, one hundred pounds\r\nannually being as chaplain of the Company. Mr. Cridge became a prominent\r\nclergyman of the colony, but in later years left his mother Church to\r\nbecome bishop of the Reformed Episcopal Church. In 1859 Bishop Hills\r\nwas made first bishop of the united colonies of Vancouver Island and\r\nBritish Columbia. Twenty years afterward the diocese was divided into\r\n(1) Vancouver Island and the islands, as _Diocese of Columbia_, (2) the\r\nsouthern mainland as _Diocese of New Westminster_, and (3) the northern\r\nmainland as _Diocese of New Caledonia_. The Church of England in British\r\nColumbia has enjoyed large gifts from the Baroness Burdett-Coutts.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable missions of modern times is that of\r\nMetlakahtla, begun under the auspices of the Church of England by\r\nWilliam Duncan. The village he founded became an example of civilization\r\namong the Indians, as well as a handmaid to the Christian work done.\r\nUnfortunately, the model Indian village has been largely broken up by a\r\nmisunderstanding between Mr. Duncan and his bishop.\r\n\r\nThe first missionary of note of the Roman Catholic Church on the\r\ncoast was Father Demers, who became Bishop of Vancouver Island and\r\nNew Caledonia. The Oblate Fathers were early on the ground in British\r\nColumbia, the first of the Order having baptized upwards of three\r\nthousand men, women, and children of Indian tribes, the Songhies,\r\nSaanechs, and Cowichins, near Victoria. Many churches, schools, and\r\nhospitals have been founded by the energetic and self-denying Roman\r\nCatholics who have made British Columbia their home. Bishop Seghers\r\nsucceeded the venerable Bishop Demers in his diocese.\r\n\r\nTen years after the formation of Vancouver Island as a Crown colony,\r\nRevs. Dr. Evans, L. Robson, and two other ministers undertook work for\r\nthe Methodist Church on the coast. Good foundations were laid by the\r\nclergymen named, and still better by Rev. Thomas Crosby, who joined\r\nthem after a few years' service, and entered heartily into efforts to\r\nevangelize the Indians. He had great success among the Flathead Indians.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 the first Presbyterian minister arrived--Rev. John Hall, from\r\nIreland, and he undertook work in Victoria. In the year following, Rev.\r\nRobert Jamieson came from Canada as a representative of the Canadian\r\nPresbyterian Church and settled at New Westminster. Churches were soon\r\nbuilt in Victoria, Nanaimo, and New Westminster, that now contain strong\r\nand vigorous congregations.\r\n\r\nAll of the churches were under deep obligations to the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany for protection, assistance, and sympathy in their undertakings\r\non the coast. The inrush of gold seekers threw a great responsibility\r\nupon all the churches, and it was well that the Company, merely\r\nfor motives of self-interest, should regard the influence of the\r\nmissionaries among the fierce tribes of the mountains, of both island\r\nand mainland, as of the greatest importance. The record of self-denying\r\nmissionaries of the churches has justified all the patronage and favour\r\nrendered them by the Hudson's Bay Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[5] See Appendix F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nTHE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY AND THE INDIANS.\r\n\r\n     The Company's Indian policy--Character of officers--A race\r\n     of hunters--Plan of advances--Charges against the Company--Liquor\r\n     restriction--Capital punishment--Starving Indians--Diseased and\r\n     helpless--Education and religion--The age of missions--Sturdy\r\n     Saulteaux--The Muskegons--Wood Crees--Wandering Plain Crees--The\r\n     Chipewyans--Wild Assiniboines--Blackfeet Indians--Polyglot\r\n     coast tribes--Eskimos--No Indian war--No police--Pliable and\r\n     docile--Success of the Company.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the opponents of the Company have sought to find\r\ngrounds for the overthrow of the licence to trade granted by the\r\nGovernment of Britain over the Indian territories. One of the most\r\nfrequent lines of attack was in regard to the treatment of the Indians\r\nby the fur traders. It may be readily conceded that the ideal of the\r\nCompany's officials was in many cases not the highest. The aim of\r\nGovernor Simpson in his long reign of forty years was that of a keen\r\ntrader. A politic man, the leader of the traders when in Montreal\r\nconformed to the sentiment of the city, abroad in the wilds he did very\r\nlittle to encourage his subordinates to cultivate higher aims among\r\nthe natives. Often the missionary was found raising questions very\r\ndisturbing to the monopoly, and this brought the Company officers into a\r\nhostile attitude to him. Undoubtedly in some cases the missionaries were\r\nofficious and unfair in their criticisms.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, the men and officers of the Company were\r\ngenerally moral. Men of education and reading the officers usually were,\r\nand their sentiment was likely to be in the right direction. The spirit\r\nof the monopoly--the golden character of silence, and the need of being\r\nsecretive and uncommunicative--was instilled into every clerk, trapper,\r\nand trader.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BLOOD INDIANS.\r\n  (Squaws and Papooses.)\r\n\r\n  ASSINIBOINES.\r\n  (Indians and Squaws on their ponies.)\r\n\r\nINDIANS OF THE PLAINS.]\r\n\r\nBut the tradition of the Company was to keep the Indian a hunter.\r\nThere was no effort to encourage the native to agriculture or to any\r\nindustry. To make a good collector of fur was the chief aim. For this\r\nthe Indian required no education, for this the wandering habit needed\r\nto be cultivated rather than discouraged, and for this it was well to\r\nhave the home ties as brittle as possible. Hence the tent and teepee\r\nwere favoured for the Indian hunter more than the log cottage or village\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the most common charges against the Company that in order\r\nto keep the Indian in subjection advances were made on the catch of\r\nfurs of the coming season, in order that, being in debt, he might be\r\nless independent. The experience of the writer in Red River settlement\r\nin former days leads him to doubt this, and certainly the fur traders\r\ndeny the allegation. The improvident or half-breed Indian went to the\r\nCompany's store to obtain all that he could. The traders at the forts\r\nhad difficulty in checking the extravagance of their wards. Frequently\r\nthe storekeeper refused to make advances lest he should fail in\r\nrecovering the value of the articles advanced. Fitzgerald, a writer who\r\ntook part in the agitation of 1849, makes the assertion in the most\r\nflippant manner that to keep the Indians in debt was the invariable\r\npolicy of the Company. No evidence is cited to support this statement,\r\nand it would seem to be very hard to prove.\r\n\r\nThe same writer undertakes, along the line of destructive criticism, to\r\nshow that the Hudson's Bay Company does not deserve the credit given\r\nit of discouraging the traffic in strong drink, and asserts that \"a\r\nbeaver skin was never lost to the Company for want of a pint of rum.\"\r\nThis is a very grave charge, and in the opinion of the writer cannot be\r\nsubstantiated. The Bishop of Montreal, R. M. Ballantyne, and the agents\r\nof the missionary societies are said either to have little experience\r\nor to be unwilling to tell on this subject what they knew. This critic\r\nthen quotes various statements of writers, extending back in some cases\r\nthirty or forty years, to show that spirituous liquors were sold by the\r\nCompany. It is undoubted that at times in the history of the fur trade,\r\nespecially at the beginning of the century, when the three Companies\r\nwere engaged in a most exacting competition, as we have fully shown,\r\nin several cases much damage was done. On the Pacific Coast, too,\r\neight or ten years before this critic wrote, there was, as we have\r\nseen, excess. At other times, also, at points in the wide field of\r\noperations, over half a continent, intoxicating liquor was plentiful and\r\nvery injurious, but no feeling was stronger in a Hudson's Bay Company\r\ntrader's mind than that he was in a country without police, without\r\nmilitary, without laws, and that his own and his people's lives were\r\nin danger should drunkenness prevail. Self-preservation inclined every\r\ntrader to prevent the use of spirits among the Indians. The writer is of\r\nopinion that while there may have been many violations of sobriety, yet\r\nthe record of the Hudson's Bay Company has been on the whole creditable\r\nin this matter.\r\n\r\nThe charges of executing capital punishment and of neglecting the\r\nIndians in years of starvation may be taken together. The criticism of\r\nthe people of Red River was that the Company was weak in the execution\r\nof the penalties of the law. They complained that the Company was\r\nuncertain of its powers and that the hand of justice was chained. The\r\nmarvel to an unprejudiced observer is that the Company succeeded in\r\nruling so vast a territory with so few reprisals or executions. In\r\nthe matter of assisting the Indians in years of scarcity, it was the\r\ninterest of the fur company to save the lives of its trappers and\r\nworkers. But those unacquainted with the vast wastes of Rupert's Land\r\nand the Far North little know the difficulties of at times obtaining\r\nfood. The readers of Milton and Cheadle's graphic story or our account\r\nof Robert Campbell's adventures on the Stikine, know the hardships and\r\nthe near approach to starvation of these travellers. Dr. Cheadle, on a\r\nvisit to Winnipeg a few years ago, said to the writer that on his first\r\nvisit the greatest difficulty his party had was to secure supplies.\r\nThere are years in which game and fish are so scarce that in remote\r\nnorthern districts death is inevitable for many. The conditions make it\r\nimpossible for the Company to save the lives of the natives. Relief for\r\nthe diseased and aged is at times hard to obtain. Smallpox and other\r\nepidemics have the most deadly effect upon the semi-civilized people of\r\nthe far-off hunter's territory.\r\n\r\nThe charge made up to 1849 that the Hudson's Bay Company had done little\r\nfor the education and religious training of the Indians was probably\r\ntrue enough. Outside of Red River and British Columbia they did not\r\nsufficiently realize their responsibility as a company. Since that time,\r\nwith the approval and co-operation in many ways of the Company, the\r\nvarious missionary societies have grappled with the problem. The Indians\r\nabout Hudson Bay, on Lake Winnipeg, in the Mackenzie River, throughout\r\nBritish Columbia, and on the great prairies of Assiniboia, are to-day\r\nlargely Christianized and receiving education.\r\n\r\nThe Saulteaux, or Indians who formerly lived at Sault Ste. Marie, but\r\nwandered west along the shore of Lake Superior and even up to Lake\r\nWinnipeg, are a branch of the Algonquin Ojibways. Hardy and persevering,\r\nmost conservative in preserving old customs, hard to influence by\r\nreligious ideas, they have been pensioners of the Hudson's Bay Company,\r\nbut their country is very barren, and they have advanced but little.\r\n\r\nVery interesting, among their relations of Algonquin origin, are the\r\nMuskegons, or Swampy Crees, who have long occupied the region around\r\nHudson Bay and have extended inland to Lake Winnipeg. Docile and\r\npeaceful, they have been largely influenced by Christianity. Under\r\nmissionary and Company guidance they have gathered around the posts,\r\nand find a living on the game of the country and in trapping the wild\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nRelated to the Muskegons are the Wood Crees, who live along the rivers\r\nand on the belts of wood which skirt lakes and hills. They cling to the\r\nbirch-bark wigwam, use the bark canoe, and are nomadic in habit. They\r\nmay be called the gipsies of the West, and being in scattered families\r\nhave been little reached by better influences.\r\n\r\nAnother branch of the Algonquin stock is the Plain Crees. These Indians\r\nare a most adventurous and energetic people. Leaving behind their canoes\r\nand Huskie dogs, they obtained horses and cayuses and hied them over\r\nthe prairies. Birch-bark being unobtainable, they made their tents,\r\nbetter fitted for protecting them from the searching winds of the\r\nprairies and the cold of winter, from tanned skins of the buffalo and\r\nmoose-deer. For seven hundred miles from the mouth of the Saskatchewan\r\nthey extend to the foot hills of the Rocky Mountains. Meeting in their\r\ngreat camps, seemingly untameable as a race of plain hunters, they were,\r\nup to the time of the transfer to Canada, almost untouched by missionary\r\ninfluence, but in the last thirty years they have been placed on\r\nreserves by the Canadian Government and are in almost all cases yielding\r\nto Christianizing agencies.\r\n\r\nNorth of the country of the Crees live tribes with very wide\r\nconnections. They call themselves \"Tinné\" or \"People,\" but to others\r\nthey are known as Chipewyans, or Athabascans. They seem to be less\r\ncopper-coloured than the other Indians, and are docile in disposition.\r\nThis nation stretches from Fort Churchill, on Hudson Bay, along the\r\nEnglish River, up to Lake Athabasca, along the Peace River into the very\r\nheart of the Rocky Mountains, and even beyond to the coast. They have\r\nproved teachable and yield to ameliorating influences.\r\n\r\nProbably the oldest and best known name of the interior of Rupert's\r\nLand, the name after which Lord Selkirk called his Colony of Assiniboia,\r\nis that belonging to the Wild Assiniboines or Stony River Sioux. The\r\nriver at the mouth of which stands the city of Winnipeg was their\r\nnorthern boundary, and they extended southward toward the great Indian\r\nconfederacy of the Sioux natives or Dakotas, of which indeed they were\r\nat one time a branch. Tall, handsome, with firmly formed faces, agile\r\nand revengeful, they are an intelligent and capable race. These Indians,\r\nknown familiarly as the \"Stonies,\" have greatly diminished in numbers\r\nsince the time of Alexander Henry, jun., who describes them fully. In\r\nlater years they have been cut down with pulmonary and other diseases,\r\nand are to-day but the fragment of a great tribe. They have long been\r\nfriendly with the Plain Crees, but are not very open to Christianity,\r\nthough there are one or two small communities which are exceptions in\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\nVery little under Hudson's Bay Company control were the Blackfoot\r\nnation, along the foot hills of the Rocky Mountains, near the national\r\nboundary. Ethnically they are related to the Crees, but they have always\r\nbeen difficult to approach. Living in large camps during Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany days, they spent a wild, happy, comfortable life among the\r\nherds of wandering buffalo of their district. Since the beginning of\r\nthe Canadian régime they have become more susceptible to civilizing\r\nagencies, and live in great reserves in the south-west of their old\r\nhunting grounds.\r\n\r\nA perfect chaos of races meets us among the Indians of British Columbia\r\nand Alaska, and their language is polyglot. Seemingly the result of\r\ninnumerable immigrations from Malayan and Mongolian sources in Asia,\r\nthey have come at different times. One of the best known tribes of\r\nthe coast is the Haidas, numbering some six thousand souls. The Nutka\r\nIndians occupy Vancouver Island, and have many tribal divisions. To\r\nthe Selish or Flatheads belong many of the tribes of the Lower Fraser\r\nRiver, while the Shushwaps hold the country on the Columbia and Okanagan\r\nRivers. Mention has been made already of the small but influential tribe\r\nof Chinooks near the mouth of the Columbia River.\r\n\r\nWhile differing in many ways from each other, the Indians of the Pacific\r\nCoast have always been turbulent and excitable. From first to last\r\nmore murders and riots have taken place among them than throughout all\r\nthe vast territory held by the Hudson's Bay Company east of the Rocky\r\nMountains. While missionary zeal has accomplished much among the Western\r\nCoast Indians, yet the \"bad Indian\" element has been a recognized and\r\nappreciable quantity among them so far as the Company is concerned.\r\n\r\nLast among the natives who have been under Hudson's Bay Company\r\ninfluence are the Eskimos or Innuits of the Far North. They are found\r\non the Labrador Coast, on Coppermine River, on the shore of the Arctic\r\nSea, and on the Alaskan peninsula. Dressed in sealskin clothing and\r\ndwelling in huts of snow, hastening from place to place in their sledges\r\ndrawn by wolf-like dogs called \"Eskies\" or \"Huskies,\" these people have\r\nfound themselves comparatively independent of Hudson's Bay Company\r\nassistance. Living largely on the products of the sea, they have shown\r\ngreat ingenuity in manufacturing articles and implements for themselves.\r\nThe usual experience of the Company from Ungava, through the Mackenzie\r\nRiver posts, and the trading houses in Alaska has been that they were\r\nstarved out and were compelled to give up their trading houses among\r\nthem. Little has been done, unless in the Yukon country, to evangelize\r\nthe Eskimos.\r\n\r\nThe marvel to the historian, as he surveys the two centuries and a\r\nquarter of the history of the Hudson's Bay Company, is their successful\r\nmanagement of the Indian tribes. There has never been an Indian war in\r\nRupert's Land or the Indian territories--nothing beyond a temporary\r\n_émeute_ or incidental outbreak. Thousands of miles from the nearest\r\nBritish garrison or soldier, trade has been carried on in scores and\r\nscores of forts and factories with perfect confidence. The Indians have\r\nalways respected the \"Kingchauch man.\" He was to them the representative\r\nof superior ability and financial strength, but more than this, he\r\nwas the embodiment of civilization and of fair and just dealing. High\r\nprices may have been imposed on the Indians, but the Company's expenses\r\nwere enormous. There are points among the most remote trading posts\r\nfrom which the returns in money were not possible in less than nine\r\nyears from the time the goods left the Fenchurch Street or Lime Street\r\nwarehouses. With all his keen bargaining and his so-called exacting\r\nmotto, \"Pro pelle cutem,\" the trader was looked upon by the Indians as\r\na benefactor, bringing into his barren, remote, inhospitable home the\r\ncommodities to supply his wants and make his life happier. While the\r\nIndians came to recognize this in their docile and pliable acceptance\r\nof the trader's decisions, the trader also became fond of the Red man,\r\nand many an old fur trader freely declares his affection for his Indian\r\nward, so faithful to his promise, unswerving in his attachment, and\r\ncelebrated for never forgetting a kindness shown him.\r\n\r\nThe success of the Company was largely due to honourable, capable,\r\nand patient officers, clerks, and employés, who with tact and justice\r\nmanaged their Indian dependents, many of whom rejoiced in the title of\r\n\"A Hudson's Bay Company Indian.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nUNREST IN RUPERT'S LAND (1844-69).\r\n\r\n     Discontent on Red River--Queries to the Governor--A courageous\r\n     Recorder--Free trade in furs held illegal--Imprisonment--New\r\n     land deed--Enormous freights--Petty revenge--Turbulent\r\n     pensioners--Heart-burnings--Heroic Isbister--Half-breed\r\n     memorial--Mr. Beaver's letter--Hudson's Bay Company notified--Lord\r\n     Elgin's reply--Voluminous correspondence--Company's full\r\n     answer--Colonel Crofton's statement--Major Caldwell, a\r\n     partisan--French petition--Nearly a thousand signatures--Love,\r\n     a factor--The elder Riel--A court scene--Violence--\"Vive la\r\n     liberté\"--The Recorder checked--A new judge--Unruly Corbett--The\r\n     prison broken--Another rescue--A valiant doctor--A Red River Nestor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fuller organization of Assiniboia, after its purchase by the\r\nHudson's Bay Company from the heirs of the Earl of Selkirk, encouraged\r\nthe authorities at Red River to assert the rights which the Company had\r\nalways claimed--viz. the monopoly of the fur trade in Rupert's Land and\r\nthe imposition of heavy freights on imports and exports by way of Hudson\r\nBay. The privilege of exporting tallow, the product of the buffalo, had\r\nbeen accorded on reasonable terms to a prominent resident of the Red\r\nRiver, named James Sinclair. The first venture, a small one, succeeded;\r\nbut a second larger consignment was refused by the Company, and, after\r\nlying nearly two years at York Factory, the cargo was sold to the\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nTwenty leading half-breeds then petitioned the Company to be allowed\r\nto export their tallow and to be given a reasonable freight charge. No\r\nanswer was returned to this letter. The half-breeds were thus rising\r\nin intelligence and means; being frequently employed as middlemen in\r\ntrafficking in furs, they learned something of the trade and traffic.\r\nThe half-breed settlers of the Red River settlement have always\r\nclaimed special privileges in Rupert's Land as being descended from\r\nthe aboriginal owners. It was under such circumstances that Governor\r\nChristie, following, it is supposed, legal direction, in 1844 issued\r\ntwo proclamations, the first, requiring that each settler, before the\r\nCompany would carry any goods for him, should be required to declare\r\nthat he had not been engaged in the fur trade; the second, that the\r\nwriter of every letter write his name on the outside of it, in order\r\nthat, should he be suspected of dealing in furs, it might be opened and\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\nThis was a direct issue, and they determined to bring the matter to a\r\ncrisis. Twenty leading natives (half-breeds of Red River settlement),\r\namong them a number well known, such as James Sinclair, John Dease, John\r\nVincent, William Bird, and Peter Garrioch, in 1845 approached Alexander\r\nChristie, Governor of the settlement, requesting answers to fourteen\r\nqueries. These questions required satisfaction as to whether half-breeds\r\ncould hunt, buy, sell, or traffic in furs, and also what were the\r\nrestrictions in this matter upon Europeans, &c. A pacific and soothing\r\nreply was made by Governor Christie, but the Company soon began to take\r\nsteps to repress the free trade in furs, and the Council of Rupert's\r\nLand passed certain regulations, among others one placing a duty of\r\ntwenty per cent. upon imports, but exempting from their tax settlers\r\nwho were free of the charge of trading in furs. This was a vexatious\r\nregulation and roused great opposition.\r\n\r\nAll these devices had a legal smack about them, and were no doubt the\r\nsuggestions of Judge Thom, the Recorder of Red River, a remarkable man,\r\nwho, six years before this time, had come from Montreal to put legal\r\nmatters in order in the Red River settlement. The Recorder entered\r\n_con amore_ into the matter, and advised the assertion of claims that\r\nhad fallen into disuse for many years among the different classes of\r\nresidents in the settlement. The redoubtable judge, who, it will be\r\nremembered, was said to have been at the elbow of Sir George Simpson in\r\nwriting his \"Journey Round the World,\" now evolved another tyrannical\r\nexpedient.\r\n\r\nA new land deed was devised, and whosoever wished to hold land in the\r\nsettlement was compelled to sign it. This indenture provided that if the\r\nland-holder should invade any privileges of the Company and fail to\r\ncontribute to the maintenance of clergy and schools, or omit to do his\r\nwork upon the public roads, or carry on trade in skins, furs, peltry, or\r\ndressed leather, such offender should forfeit his lands.\r\n\r\nThis was certainly un-British and severe, and we may look upon it as the\r\nplan of the judge, who failed to understand the spirit of his age, and\r\nwould have readily fallen in with a system of feudal tenure. The writer\r\nin after years met this judge, then very old, in London, and found him\r\na kindly man, though with Scottish determination, willing to follow out\r\nhis opinions logically, however rash or out of place such a course might\r\nbe. If the Hudson's Bay Company found itself in a sea of trouble, and\r\nhostile to public sentiment in the settlement, it had to blame its own\r\ncreation, the valorous Recorder of Red River.\r\n\r\nThe imposition of enormous freights, adopted at this time for carrying\r\ngoods by way of York Factory to England, in order to check trade, was\r\na part of the same policy of \"Thorough\" recommended by this legal\r\nadviser. Sinclair, already mentioned, became the \"Village Hampden\" in\r\nthis crisis. Taking an active part in his opposition to this policy of\r\nrestriction, he found that he was to be punished, by the \"Company's\r\nShip\" from England to York Factory refusing to carry for him any\r\nfreight. It was partly the Oregon question and partly the unsettled\r\nstate of public opinion in Red River that led to a British regiment\r\nbeing for a time stationed at the Red River settlement. On the removal\r\nof these troops the pensioners, a turbulent band of old discharged\r\nsoldiers, came from Britain and were settled upon the Assiniboine, above\r\nFort Garry. A writer who knew them well ventures to suggest that they\r\nwere of the same troublesome disposition as the former De Meurons of\r\nLord Selkirk. Coming ostensibly to introduce peace they brought a sword.\r\nSooner or later the discontent and irritation produced by Judge Thorn's\r\ninspiration was sure to reach its culmination, and this it did in the\r\nSayer affair afterwards described.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the complaints from the Red River settlement found a\r\nwilling and powerful advocate in Mr. Alexander K. Isbister, a young\r\nLondon barrister, and afterwards a prominent educationalist. He was a\r\nnative of Rupert's Land, and had a dash of Indian blood in his veins,\r\nand so took up the brief for his compatriots in a formidable series\r\nof documents. Mr. Isbister's advocacy gave standing and weight to the\r\ncontention of the Red River half-breeds, and a brave and heroic fight\r\nwas made, even though the point of view was at times quite unjust to the\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nIn 1847, Isbister, with five other half-breeds of Red River, forwarded,\r\nto the Secretary of State for the Colonies, a long and able memorial,\r\nsetting forth the grievances of the petitioners. The document sets\r\nforth in short that the Company had \"amassed a princely revenue\" at the\r\nexpense of the natives, allowed their wards to pass their lives in the\r\ndarkest heathenism, broke their pledges to exclude strong drink from the\r\nIndian trade, were careless of the growing evil of want and suffering in\r\nthe territory, paid little for the furs, and persecuted the natives by\r\nchecking them in their barter of furs, and followed a short-sighted and\r\npernicious policy.\r\n\r\nThis was assuredly a serious list of charges. Earl Grey in due time\r\ncalled on Isbister and his friends for a more specific statement of\r\nthe grievances, and wrote to the Governor of Assiniboia, to the London\r\nGovernor of the Hudson's Bay Company, and to the Governor-General of\r\nCanada, Lord Elgin, asking their attention to the allegations of the\r\npetition.\r\n\r\nSome two months after Lord Grey's letter was received, the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany Governor, Sir J. H. Pelly, submitted a long and minute answer\r\nto the various charges of the petitioners. As is usually the case, both\r\nparties had some advantages. As to the enormous profits, the Company\r\nwere able to show that they had unfortunately not been able to make\r\n\"more than the ordinary rate of mercantile profit.\" They replied as to\r\nthe religious interests of the natives, that their sole objects, as\r\nstated in the Charter, were trade and the discovery of a North-West\r\nPassage, but that they had helped at a considerable annual expense the\r\nChurch Missionary Society, Wesleyan Missionary Society, and a Roman\r\nCatholic Missionary Society. The Company gives a most indignant denial\r\nto the charge that they had resumed the trade in spirituous liquors with\r\nthe Indians, though admitting in the neighbourhood of Red River the use\r\nof small quantities of strong drink in meeting the American traders.\r\n\r\nThis answer did not, however, quiet the storm. Isbister returned to\r\nthe attack, giving the evidence of Mr. Alexander Simpson, a trader on\r\nthe Pacific Coast, and the extensive and strong letter of the Rev.\r\nHerbert Beaver, the former chaplain of the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort\r\nVancouver. Isbister also raised the question of the validity of the\r\nCompany's Charter. The Company again replied, and so the battle raged,\r\nreply and rejoinder, quotations and evidence _ad libitum_. Isbister may\r\nnot have proved his case, but his championship won the approbation of\r\nmany independent observers.\r\n\r\nLord Elgin, the efficient and popular Governor-General of Canada, gave\r\nsuch reply as he was able. He states that the distance of Red River\r\nwas so great and the intercourse so little, that taking into account\r\nthe peculiar jurisdiction of the Company, he found it difficult to\r\nobtain the information sought. As to the complaints about the religious\r\nneglect of the Indians, Lord Elgin states that disappointments in this\r\nmatter occur in other quarters as well as in the Hudson's Bay Company\r\nterritories, but declares that the result of his inquiries in the matter\r\n\"is highly favourable to the Company, and that it has left in his mind\r\nthe impression that the authority which they exercise over the vast and\r\ninhospitable region subject to their jurisdiction is on the whole very\r\nadvantageous to the Indians.\"\r\n\r\nLord Elgin states that he is much indebted for his information to\r\nColonel Crofton, the commander of the 6th Royal Regiment, which we\r\nhave seen was stationed for a time at Red River. Colonel Crofton\r\nafterwards gave to the Colonial Secretary what one would say was\r\nrather an unjudicial reply. He said, \"I unhesitatingly assert that the\r\ngovernment of the Hudson's Bay Company is mild and protective, and\r\nadmirably adapted, in my opinion, for the state of society existing in\r\nRupert's Land, where Indians, half-breeds, or Europeans are happily\r\ngoverned, and live protected by laws which I know were mercifully\r\nand impartially administered by Mr. Thom, the Recorder, and by the\r\nmagistrates of the land.\" In regard to this opinion, while no doubt an\r\nhonest expression of views, it is plain that Colonel Crofton did not\r\nunderstand the aspiration for self-government which prevails in Western\r\ncommunities. The reply of the Governor of Assiniboia, Major Caldwell,\r\nwas likewise favourable to the Company. Alexander Ross, in his \"Red\r\nRiver Settlement,\" criticizes the method taken by Major Caldwell to\r\nobtain information. According to Ross, the Governor sent around queries\r\nto a few select individuals, accepting no one \"below what the Major\r\nconsidered a gentleman.\" This, the critic says, was the action of a man\r\n\"who had never studied the art of governing a people.\" Ross, who did not\r\nadmire the Company greatly, however, sums up the whole matter by saying,\r\n\"The allegations of harsh conduct or maladministration preferred against\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company by Mr. Isbister and his party were in general\r\ntotally unfounded and disproved,\" and therefore neither Major Caldwell's\r\ninquiries nor the inspiration of his genius were required.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Major Caldwell's optimism and Lord Elgin's favourable\r\nreply, there was really a serious condition of affairs in Red River\r\nsettlement. Along with the petition of Isbister and his five English\r\nhalf-breed compatriots, there was one far more formidable from the\r\nFrench half-breeds, who to the number of nine hundred and seventy-seven\r\nsubscribed their names. Presented to Her Majesty the Queen, in most\r\nexcellent terms, in the French language, their petition sought, decrying\r\nthe monopoly as severe:--\r\n\r\n1. That as good subjects they might be governed by the principles of the\r\nBritish Constitution;\r\n\r\n2. That as British subjects they demanded their right to enjoy the\r\nliberty of commerce;\r\n\r\n3. They requested the sale of lands to strangers, and that a portion of\r\nthe proceeds should be applied to improve the means of transport.\r\n\r\nFrench and English half-breeds were now united in a common purpose. A\r\nstrange story is related as to the way in which the English-speaking\r\nhalf-breeds came to throw in their lot with their French\r\nfellow-countrymen. A Company officer had left his two daughters at Fort\r\nGarry to be educated. One of them was the object of the affection of a\r\nyoung Scotch half-breed, and at the same time of a young Highlander.\r\nThe young lady is said to have preferred the Metis, but the stern\r\nparent favoured the Highlander. The Scotchman, fortified by the father's\r\napproval, proceeded to upbraid the Metis for his temerity in aspiring to\r\nthe hand of one so high in society as the lady. As love ruined Troy, so\r\nit is said this affair joined French and English half-breeds in a union\r\nto defeat the Company.\r\n\r\nThe agitation went on, as Isbister and his friends corresponded with\r\nthe people of Red River and succeeded so well in gaining the ear of the\r\nBritish Government. Among the French people one of the fiercest and most\r\nnoisy leaders was Louis Riel, the revolutionary \"miller of the Seine.\"\r\nThis man, the father of the rebel chief of later years, was a French\r\nhalf-breed. A tribune of the people, he had a strong ascendency over the\r\nignorant half-breeds. He was ready for any emergency.\r\n\r\nIt is often the case that some trifling incident serves to bring on a\r\nserious crisis in affairs. A French settler, named Guillaume Sayer,\r\nhalf-breed son of an old bourgeois in the North-West Company, had\r\nbought a quantity of goods, intending to go on a trading expedition to\r\nLake Manitoba. The Company proceeded to arrest him, and, after a stiff\r\nresistance, he was overcome by force and imprisoned at Fort Garry.\r\n\r\nAs the day of trial drew near the excitement grew intense. Governor\r\nCaldwell was a well-known martinet; the Recorder was regarded as the\r\noriginator of the policy of restriction. He was, moreover, believed\r\nto be a Francophobe, having written a famous series of newspaper\r\ncommunications in Montreal, known as the \"Antigallic Letters.\" The day\r\nof trial had been fixed for Ascension Day, May 17th, and this was taken\r\nas a religious affront by the French. The Court was to meet in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the trial hundreds of French Metis, armed, came from all\r\nthe settlements to St. Boniface Church, and, leaving their guns at the\r\nchurch door, entered for service. At the close they gathered together,\r\nand were addressed in a fiery oration by Riel. A French Canadian\r\nadmirer, writing of the matter, says, \"Louis Riel obtained a veritable\r\ntriumph on that occasion, and long and loud the hurrahs were repeated by\r\nthe echoes of the Red River.\"\r\n\r\nCrossing by way of Point Douglas, the Metis surrounded the unguarded\r\nCourt House at Fort Garry. The governor, judge, and magistrate arrived,\r\nand took their seats at eleven o'clock. A curious scene now ensued: the\r\nmagistrates protested against the violence; Riel in loud tones declared\r\nthat they would give the tribunal one hour, and that if justice were\r\nnot done them, they would do it themselves. An altercation then took\r\nplace between Judge Thom and Riel, and with his loud declaration, \"Et\r\nje déclare que de ce moment Sayer est libre----\" drowned by the shouts\r\nof the Metis, the trial was over. Sayer and his fellow-prisoners betook\r\nthemselves to freedom, while the departing Metis cried out, \"Le commerce\r\nest libre! le commerce est libre! Viva la liberté!\" This crisis was a\r\nserious one. Judge Thom, so instructed by Governor Simpson, never acted\r\nas Recorder again. The five years' struggle was over.\r\n\r\nThe movement for liberty continued to stimulate the people. Five years\r\nafterward the plan of the agitators was to obtain the intervention of\r\nCanada. Accordingly a petition, signed by Roderick Kennedy and five\r\nhundred and seventy-four others, was presented to the Legislative\r\nAssembly of Canada. The grievances of the people of Red River were\r\nrecited. It was stated that application had been made to the Imperial\r\nParliament without result, and this through \"the chicanery of the\r\nCompany and its false representations.\" In 1857 the Toronto Board of\r\nTrade petitioned the Canadian Assembly to open the Hudson's Bay Company\r\nterritories to trade. Restlessness and uncertainty largely prevailed\r\nin Red River, though there were many of the colonists who paid little\r\nattention to what they considered the infatuated conduct of the\r\nagitators.\r\n\r\nNo truer test of the success of government can be found than the respect\r\nand obedience shown by the people for the law. Red River settlement,\r\njudged by this standard, had a woful record at this time. After the\r\nunfortunate Sayer affair, Recorder Thom was superseded, and for a\r\ntime (1855 to 1858) Judge Johnson, of Montreal, came to Fort Garry to\r\nadminister justice and to act as Governor.\r\n\r\nJudge Black, a capable trader who had received a legal training, was\r\nappointed to the office of Recorder, but soon found a case that tried\r\nhis judicial ability and skill. A clergyman named Corbett, who had been\r\nbitterly hostile to the Company, testified to certain extreme statements\r\nagainst the Company in the great investigation of 1857. He then returned\r\nto his parish of Headingly in the settlement. A criminal charge was\r\nbrought against him, for which he was found guilty in the courts and\r\nsentenced to six months' imprisonment. The opponents of the Company,\r\nseemingly without ground, but none the less fiercely, declared that the\r\ntrial was a persecution by the Company and that Corbett was innocent.\r\nStrong in this belief, the mob surrounded the prison at Fort Garry,\r\noverawed the old French jailor, and, rescuing Corbett, took him home to\r\nhis parish.\r\n\r\nAmong those who had been prominent in the rescue was James Stewart,\r\nlong afterward a druggist and meteorological observer in Winnipeg.\r\nStewart and some of his companions were arrested for jail-breaking and\r\ncast into prison. Some forty or fifty friends of Stewart threatened\r\nviolence should he be kept a prisoner. The Governor, bishop, and three\r\nmagistrates met to overawe the insurgents, but the determined rescuers\r\ntore up the pickets enclosing the prison yard, broke open the jail, and\r\nmade the prisoner a free man.\r\n\r\nSuch insubordination and tumult marked the decline of the Company's\r\npower as a governing body. This lawlessness was no doubt stimulated\r\nby the establishment of a newspaper in 1859--_The Nor'-Wester_--which\r\nfrom the first was hostile to the Company. The system of government by\r\nthe Council of Assiniboia had always been a vulnerable point in the\r\nmanagement by the Company, and the newspaper constantly fanned the\r\nspirit of discontent. In the year 1868, when the Hudson Bay Company\r\nrégime was approaching its end, another violent and disturbing affair\r\ntook place. This was the arrest of Dr. Schultz, a Canadian leader of\r\ngreat bodily strength and determination, who had thrown in his lot with\r\nthe Red River people. As a result of a business dispute, Schultz was\r\nproceeded against in the Court, and an order issued for seizure of his\r\ngoods. On his resisting the sheriff in the execution of his duty, he\r\nwas, after a severe struggle, overpowered, taken captive, and confined\r\nin Fort Garry jail.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the wife of Dr. Schultz and some fifteen men\r\nforcibly entered the prison, overpowered the guards, and, breaking open\r\nhis cell, rescued the redoubtable doctor. Hargrave says, \"This done, the\r\nparty adjourned along with him to his house, where report says, 'They\r\nmade a night of it.'\"\r\n\r\nThese events represented the decadence of the Company's rule; they\r\nindicated the rise of new forces that were to compel a change; and\r\nhowever harmful to those immediately involved they declared unmistakably\r\nthat the old order changeth, giving place to new.\r\n\r\nTypical of his times, there sat through the court scenes of these\r\ntroublous days the old \"clerk of court and council,\" William Robert\r\nSmith. With long grey beard he held his post, and was the genius of\r\nthe place. He was the Nestor of Red River. A Bluecoat boy from London,\r\nhe had come from school far back in 1813, to enter on the fur trade\r\nin Rupert's Land. At Oxford House, Ile à la Crosse, Little Slave\r\nLake, and Norway House, he served eleven faithful years as a clerk,\r\nwhen he retired and became a settler of Red River. He was the first\r\nto settle near Lower Fort Garry, and named the spot \"Little Britain,\"\r\nfrom one of his old London localities. Farming, teaching, catechizing\r\nfor the church, acting precentor, a local encyclopædia, and collector\r\nof Customs, he passed his versatile life, till, the year before the\r\nSayer _émeute_, he became Clerk of Court, which place, with slight\r\ninterruption, he held for twenty years. How remarkable to think of the\r\nman of all work, the Company's factotum, reaching in his experience from\r\nthe beginning to well-nigh the ending of the Selkirk settlement! One who\r\nknew him says, \"From his long residence in the settlement he has seen\r\ngovernors, judges, bishops, and clergymen, not to mention such birds\r\nof passage as the Company's local officers, who come and go, himself\r\nremaining to record their doings to their successors.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COUNCIL OF HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY COMMISSIONED OFFICERS\r\nHELD IN WINNIPEG, 1887.\r\n\r\n(_See_ Appendix G. for names.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nCANADA COVETS THE HUDSON'S BAY TERRITORY.\r\n\r\n     Renewal of licence--Labouchere's letter--Canada claims\r\n     to Pacific Ocean--Commissioner Chief-Justice Draper--Rests on\r\n     Quebec Act, 1774--Quebec overlaps Indian territories--Company\r\n     loses Vancouver Island--Cauchon's memorandum--Committee of\r\n     1857--Company on trial--A brilliant committee--Four hundred folios\r\n     of evidence--To transfer Red River and Saskatchewan--Death of Sir\r\n     George--Governor Dallas--A cunning scheme--Secret negotiations--The\r\n     Watkin Company floated--Angry winterers--Dallas's soothing\r\n     circular--The old order still--Ermatinger's letters--McDougall's\r\n     resolutions--Cartier and McDougall as delegates--Company accepts\r\n     the terms.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs is well known to those who have followed the history of the Hudson's\r\nBay Company, while the possession of Rupert's Land was secured by\r\ncharter, the territory outside Rupert's Land was secured to the Company\r\nby licence.

Accordingly, three or four years before this date,\r\nas their Athabasca, New Caledonia, and British Columbia possessions had\r\nbecome of great value to them, the Company with due foresight approached\r\nthe British Government with a request for the renewal of their tenure.\r\nMen of understanding on both sides of the Atlantic saw the possible\r\ndanger of a refusal to their request, on account of the popular ferment\r\nwhich had taken place both in Red River and British Columbia. Others\r\nthought the time had come for ending the power of the Company.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Labouchere, Secretary of State for the Colonies, entered into\r\ncorrespondence with Sir Edmund Head, Governor-General of Canada, on the\r\nsubject. Anxious about the state of things in every part of the Empire\r\nas the Colonial Office always is, the turbulence and defiance of law\r\nin Red River settlement called for special attention. Accordingly the\r\nGovernor-General was informed that it was the intention of the Home\r\nGovernment to have, not only the question of the licence discussed, but\r\nalso the \"general position and prospects\" of the Company considered,\r\nby a Committee of the House of Commons. The Canadian Government was\r\ntherefore cordially invited to have its views, as well as those of the\r\nCanadian community, represented before the Committee.\r\n\r\nThis invitation was the thing for which Canada had been waiting. A\r\ndespatch was sent by the Canadian Government, in less than seven weeks\r\nfrom the time when the invitation left Downing Street, accepting the\r\nproposal of the Mother Country. The Canadian Ministry was pleased\r\nthat British-American affairs were receiving such prominent notice in\r\nEngland. It suggested the importance of determining the limits of Canada\r\non the side towards Rupert's Land, and went on to state that the general\r\nopinion strongly held in the New World was \"that the western boundary of\r\nCanada extends to the Pacific Ocean.\" Reference is made to the danger of\r\ncomplications arising with the United States, and the statement advanced\r\nthat the \"question of the jurisdiction and title claimed by the Hudson's\r\nBay Company is to Canada of paramount importance.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1857 Chief Justice Draper crossed to Great Britain as Canadian\r\nrepresentative, with a very wide commission to advance Canadian\r\ninterests. He was called before the Committee appointed by the House of\r\nCommons, and answered nearly two hundred questions relating to Canada\r\nand to the Hudson's Bay Company interests in Rupert's Land and beyond.\r\nThe capable and active-minded Chief Justice kept before the Committee\r\nthese points:--\r\n\r\n(1) What he conceived to be the true western boundary of Canada, and in\r\nso doing gave his opinion, based on the Quebec Act of 1774, that Canada\r\nshould be allowed to extend to the Rocky Mountains and should have the\r\nprivilege of exploring and building roads in that region.\r\n\r\n(2) The earnest desire of the Canadian people that Rupert's Land and the\r\nIndian territories should be maintained as British territory.\r\n\r\n(3) That Canada should be allowed to extend her settlements into these\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Draper argued his case with great clearness and cogency,\r\nand made an excellent impression upon the Committee.\r\n\r\nThe matter of the Company's hold on Vancouver Island seems to have been\r\nsettled without any great difficulty. Mr. Richard Blanshard, the former\r\nGovernor, who received so cool a reception in Vancouver Island, gave a\r\nplain and unvarnished tale. The Company had evidently made up its mind\r\nto surrender all its claims to Vancouver Island. And the island, as we\r\nhave seen, became independent.\r\n\r\nCanada entered with great spirit into the case presented before the\r\nCommittee. The question of the licence was quite overshadowed by the\r\nwider discussion covering the validity of the Hudson's Bay Company\r\ncharter, the original boundary line of the province of Canada, and\r\nthe manner in which the Company had carried out its responsibilities.\r\nAn industrious minister of the Canadian Government, Hon. Joseph\r\nCauchon, with true Gallic fire and a French Canadian spirit, prepared\r\na memorandum of a most elaborate kind on the Hudson's Bay Company's\r\nclaim and status. In this, Mr. Cauchon goes back to the earliest times,\r\nshows the limits of occupation by the French explorers, follows down the\r\nline of connection established by the North-West traders, deals with\r\nthe troubles of Lord Selkirk, and concludes that the Red River and the\r\nSaskatchewan are not within the limits of the Company's charter. This\r\nvigorous writer then deals with the Treaty of Paris, the Quebec Act, and\r\nthe discoveries of Canadian subjects as giving Canada a Jurisdiction\r\neven to the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, the Committee of 1857 became a famous one.\r\nThe whole economy of the Company was discussed. The ground gone over by\r\nIsbister and others during the preceding decade supplied the members\r\nwith material, and the proceedings of the Committee became notable\r\nfor their interest. The Committee held eighteen meetings, examined\r\ntwenty-nine witnesses, and thoroughly sifted the evidence.\r\n\r\nThe _personnel_ of the Committee was brilliant. The Secretary of State\r\nwas Chairman. Mr. Roebuck and Mr. Gladstone represented the inquiring\r\nand aggressive element. Lord Stanley and Lord John Russell added their\r\nexperience, Edward Ellice--\"the Old Bear\"--watched the case for the\r\nCompany, and Mr. Lowe and Sir John Pakington took a lively interest\r\nin the proceedings and often interposed. Altogether the Committee was\r\nconstituted for active service, and every nook and cranny of Rupert's\r\nLand and the adjoining territories was thoroughly investigated.\r\n\r\nAmong the witnesses was the distinguished Governor Simpson. He was at\r\nhis best. Mr. Roebuck and he had many a skirmish, and although Sir\r\nGeorge was often driven into a corner, yet with surprising agility\r\nhe recovered himself. Old explorers such as John Ross, Dr. Rae, Col.\r\nLefroy, Sir John Richardson, Col. Crofton, Bishop Anderson, Col.\r\nCaldwell, and Dr. King, gave information as to having visited Rupert's\r\nLand at different periods. Their evidence was fair, with, as could\r\nbe expected in most cases, a \"good word\" for the Company. Rev. Mr.\r\nCorbett gave testimony against the Company, Governor Blanshard in the\r\nsame strain, A. K. Isbister, considerably moderated in his opposition,\r\ngave evidence as a native who had travelled in the country, while John\r\nMcLoughlin, a rash and heady agitator, told of the excitement in Red\r\nRiver settlement. Edward Ellice became a witness as well as a member of\r\nthe Committee, and with adroitness covered the retreat of any of his\r\nwitnesses when necessity arose.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, from February to the end of July, the Committee met,\r\nand gathered a vast amount of evidence, making four hundred pages of\r\nprinted matter. It is a thesaurus of Hudson's Bay Company material.\r\nIt revealed not only the localities of this unknown land to England\r\nand the world, but made everyone familiar with the secret methods,\r\ndevices, and working of the fur trade over a space of well-nigh half a\r\ncontinent. The Committee decided to recommend to Parliament that it is\r\n\"important to meet the just and reasonable wishes of Canada to assume\r\nsuch territory as may be useful for settlement; that the districts of\r\nthe Red River and the Saskatchewan seem the most available; and that\r\nfor the order and good government of the country,\" arrangements should\r\nbe made for their cession to Canada. It was also agreed that those\r\nregions where settlement is impossible be left to the exclusive control\r\nof the Hudson's Bay Company for the fur trade. The Committee not only\r\nrecommended that Vancouver Island should be made independent, but that\r\nthe territory of the mainland in British Columbia should be united with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFour years after the sitting of this Committee, which gave such anxiety\r\nto the Hudson's Bay Company, Sir George Simpson, after a very short\r\nillness, passed away, having served as Governor for forty years. In an\r\nearlier chapter his place and influence have been estimated and his\r\nmerits and defects shown.\r\n\r\nSir George, in his high office as Governor of Rupert's Land, was\r\nsucceeded by A. J. Dallas, a Scottish merchant, who had been in\r\nbusiness in China, had retired, and afterwards acted as Chief Factor\r\nof the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Victoria, in Vancouver Island, and\r\nhad then married the daughter of Governor James Douglas. Dallas had\r\nshown great nerve and judgment in British Columbia, in a serious brush\r\nwith the United States authorities in 1859. Three years after this\r\nevent he was called to succeed the great Governor of Rupert's Land.\r\nOn his appointment to this high position, he took up his residence at\r\nFort Garry, and had, in conjunction with the local Governor, William\r\nMcTavish, to face the rising tide of dissatisfaction which showed itself\r\nin the Corbett and Stewart rescues. Writers of the period state that\r\nDallas lacked the dignity and tact of old Sir George. In his letters,\r\nhowever, Governor Dallas shows that he thoroughly appreciated the\r\nserious state of matters. He says: \"I have had great difficulty in\r\npersuading the magistrates to continue to act. Mr. William McTavish,\r\nGovernor of Assiniboia, has resigned his post.\" Governor Dallas says he\r\n\"finds himself with all the responsibility and semblance of authority\r\nover a vast territory, but unsupported, if not ignored, by the Crown.\"\r\nHe states that people do not object to the _personnel_ of the Hudson's\r\nBay Company government, but to the \"system of government.\" He fears the\r\nformation of a provisional government, and a movement for annexation to\r\nthe United States, which had been threatened. He is of opinion that the\r\n\"territorial right should revert to the Crown.\" These are strong, honest\r\nwords for an official of the Company whose rule had prevailed for some\r\ntwo centuries.\r\n\r\nAnd now Governor Dallas appears co-operating in an ingenious and adroit\r\nfinancial scheme with Mr. E. W. Watkin, a member of the British House\r\nof Commons, by which the Hudson's Bay Company property changed hands.\r\nEdward Watkin was a financial agent, who had much to do with the Grand\r\nTrunk Railway of Canada, and had an intimate knowledge of Canadian\r\naffairs. He had succeeded in interesting the Colonial Secretary of\r\nState, the Duke of Newcastle, in a railway, road, and telegraphic scheme\r\nfor connecting the British possessions in North America.\r\n\r\nDifficulties having arisen in inducing staid old Governor Berens, the\r\nLondon head of the Company, to accept modern ideas, a plan was broached\r\nof buying out the whole Hudson's Bay Company possessions and rights.\r\nDifficulty after difficulty was met and surmounted, and though many a\r\ntime the scheme seemed hopeless, yet in the end it succeeded, though not\r\nwithout much friction and heart-burning. Watkin describes graphically\r\nthe first interview between three members of the Hudson's Bay Company,\r\nBerens, Eden Colville, and Lyall, of the first part, and Glynn,\r\nNewmarch, himself, and three other capitalists of the second part.\r\nThe meeting took place in the Hudson's Bay Company House, Fenchurch\r\nStreet, February 1st, 1862. \"The room was the 'Court' room, dark and\r\ndirty, faded green cloth, old chairs almost black, and a fine picture of\r\nPrince Rupert. Governor Berens, an old man and obstinate, was somewhat\r\ninsulting in his manner. We took it patiently.\" It was a day of fate for\r\nthe old Company.\r\n\r\nMany interviews afterwards took place between Watkin and the accountant\r\nand solicitors of the Company. The Company would hear of no dealings,\r\nexcept on the basis of a cash payment. The men of capital accordingly\r\nsucceeded in interesting the \"International Financial Association,\" a\r\nnew corporation looking for some great scheme to lay before the public.\r\n\r\nAt length the whole shares, property, and rights of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany were taken over, the final arrangements being made by Mr.\r\nRichard Potter on June 1st, 1863. Thus the Company begun in so small a\r\nway by Prince Rupert and his associates nearly two centuries before,\r\nsold out, and the purchase money of one and a half millions of pounds\r\nwas paid over the counter to the old Company by the new Association.\r\n\r\nA new company was now to be organized whose stock would be open for\r\npurchase, and the International Association would, on such organization\r\nbeing formed, hand over the Company's assets to the new stockholders.\r\nIn a short time the Company was reconstituted, Sir Edmund Head being\r\nthe new Governor, with, as prominent members of the Board of Directors,\r\nRichard Potter, Eden Colville, E. B. Watkin, and an American fur trader\r\nof experience, Sir Curtis Lampson.\r\n\r\nSecretly as the negotiations for the formation of a new company had been\r\nconducted, the news of the affair reached Canada and Rupert's Land,\r\nand led to anxious inquiries being made and to a memorial from the\r\nCompany's officers being presented to the Board of Directors asking for\r\ninformation. So thoroughly secret had the interviews between the London\r\nparties been carried on that the officials of the London office knew\r\nnothing of them, and stated in their reply to the memorialists that the\r\nrumours were incorrect. In July, when the transfer had been consummated\r\nand the news of it appeared in the public press, it created surprise and\r\nindignation among the chief factors and chief traders, who, under the\r\ndeed poll or Company arrangement which had been adopted in 1821, though\r\nsomewhat modified thirteen years later, had been regarded as having\r\ncertain partnership rights in the Company.\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Watkin informs us, in his interesting \"Reminiscences,\" that\r\nhe had intended that the \"wintering partners,\" as the officers in\r\nRupert's Land were called, should have been individually communicated\r\nwith, but that on account of his hasty departure to Canada the matter\r\nhad been overlooked. It certainly was irritating to the officers of\r\nthe fur trade to learn for the first time from the public press of an\r\narrangement being perfected involving their whole private interests.\r\n\r\nWatkin expresses his great apprehension lest the news in a distorted\r\nform should reach the distant regions of the fur country, where the\r\nCompany had one hundred and forty-four posts, covering the continent\r\nfrom Labrador to Sitka, Vancouver Island and San Francisco. He feared\r\nalso that there would be a new company formed to occupy the ground with\r\nthe old.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Canada, Mr. Watkin was agreeably surprised at the arrival\r\nof Governor Dallas from Red River in Montreal. After consultation it\r\nwas decided on that the Governor should send a conciliatory circular\r\nto the commissioned officers of the Company, explaining the objects of\r\nthe new Company, and stating that all the interests of the wintering\r\npartners would be conserved. It is evident that the attitude of the\r\nofficers had alarmed even such stout-hearted men as Watkin and Dallas.\r\nThere lies before the writer also a personal letter, dated London, July\r\n23rd, 1863, signed by Edmund Head, Governor, to a chief trader of the\r\nCompany, stating that it was the intention of the Committee \"to carry on\r\nthe fur trade as it has been hitherto carried on, under the provisions\r\nof the deed poll.\" None of the collateral objects of the Company \"should\r\ninterfere with the fur trade.\" He begs the officers to \"have with him\r\nfree and unreserved communication through the usual channel.\" Evidently\r\nthe echo of the angry voices in Athabasca had been heard in London.\r\n\r\nThe old deed poll, which they had intended to suspend, as shown by\r\nWatkin, was thus preserved. This document secured them as follows:\r\nAccording to both deed polls of 1821 and 1834, forty per cent. of the\r\nnet profits of the trade, divided into eighty-five shares of equal\r\namount, were distributed annually among the wintering partners of the\r\nCompany. A chief trader received an eighty-fifth share of the profits,\r\nand a chief factor two eighty-fifth shares. Both had certain rights\r\nafter retiring.\r\n\r\nThe proposed abolition of these terms of the deed poll and the\r\nsubstitution therefor of certain salaries with the avowed purpose of\r\nreducing the expenses, of course meant loss to every wintering partner.\r\nThe interests thus involved justified the most strenuous opposition on\r\nthe part of the partners, and, unless the proposal were modified, would\r\nalmost certainly have led to a disruption of the Company.\r\n\r\nIn harmony with Governor Head's circular letter no action in the\r\ndirection contemplated was taken until 1871, when, on the receipt of\r\nthe three hundred thousand pounds voted by Canada to the Company, the\r\nsum of one hundred and seven thousand and fifty-five pounds was applied\r\nto buying out the vested rights of the wintering partners, and the\r\nagitation was quieted.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the arrangement made for the payment of officers of the\r\nCompany since 1871, as compared with their previous remuneration, has\r\nbeen a subject of discussion.\r\n\r\nThere lies before the writer an elaborate calculation by an old Hudson's\r\nBay Company officer to the effect that under the old deed poll a chief\r\nfactor would receive two eighty-fifth shares, his total average being\r\nseven hundred and twenty pounds per annum; and under the new (taking\r\nthe average of twenty-five years) two and one half-hundredths shares,\r\namounting to five hundred and thirty-two pounds annually, or a loss\r\nnearly of one hundred and eighty-eight pounds; similarly that a chief\r\ntrader would receive three hundred and nineteen pounds, as against three\r\nhundred and sixty formerly, or a loss per annum of forty-one pounds.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the number of higher commissioned officers was reduced\r\nwhen the old deed poll was cancelled, so that the stockholders received\r\nthe advantage from there being fewer officials, also the chances of\r\npromotion to higher offices were diminished.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of these internal dissensions of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany public opinion had been gradually maturing in Canada in favour\r\nof acquiring at least a portion of Rupert's Land. At the time of the\r\nSpecial Committee of 1857, it will be remembered the Hind-Gladman\r\nexpedition had gone to spy out the land. A company, called the\r\nNorth-West Transportation Company, was about the same time organized in\r\nToronto to carry goods and open communication from Fort William by way\r\nof the old fur traders' route to Fort Garry.\r\n\r\nThe merits and demerits of the north-western prairies were discussed\r\nin the public press of Canada. Edward Ermatinger, whose name has been\r\nalready mentioned, was a steady supporter of the claim of the Hudson's\r\nBay Company in a series of well-written letters in the _Hamilton\r\nSpectator_, a journal of Upper Canada. Taking the usual line of argument\r\nfollowed by the Company, he showed the small value of the country, its\r\ninhospitable climate, its inaccessibility, and magnified the legal\r\nclaim of the Hudson's Bay Company against the Canadian contention.\r\nIt is amusing to read in after years, when his opinion of Sir George\r\nSimpson was changed, his declaration of regret at having been led to so\r\nstrenuously present his views in the _Spectator_.\r\n\r\nTen years had passed after the setting of the great Committee of 1857,\r\nand nothing practical as to the transfer of the country to Canada had\r\nbeen accomplished. The confederation movement had now widened the\r\nhorizon of Canadian public men. In the very year of the confederation\r\nof the Canadian provinces (1867), Hon. William McDougall, who had been\r\na persistent advocate of the Canadian claim to the North-West, moved in\r\nthe Dominion Parliament a series of resolutions, which were carried.\r\nThese resolutions showed the advantage, both to Canada and the Empire,\r\nof the Dominion being extended to the Pacific Ocean; that settlement,\r\ncommerce, and development of the resources of the country are dependent\r\non a stable Government being established; that the welfare of the\r\nRed River settlers would be enhanced by this means; that provision\r\nwas contained in the British North-American Act for the admission of\r\nRupert's Land and the North-West territory to the Dominion; that this\r\nwide country should be united to Canada; that in case of union the legal\r\nrights of any corporation, as the Hudson's Bay Company, association, or\r\nindividual should be respected; that this should be settled judicially\r\nor by agreement; that the Indian title should be legally extinguished;\r\nand that an address be made to Her Majesty to this effect. The\r\nresolutions were carried by a large majority of the House. This was a\r\nbold and well-conceived step, and the era of discussion and hesitancy\r\nseemed to have passed away in favour of a policy of action.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson's Bay Company, however, insisted on an understanding being\r\ncome to as to terms before giving consent to the proposed action, and a\r\ndespatch to the Dominion Government from Her Majesty's Government called\r\nattention to this fact. As soon as convenient, a delegation, consisting\r\nof Hon. George E. Cartier and Hon. William McDougall, proceeded to\r\nEngland to negotiate with the Company as to terms. The path of the\r\ndelegates on reaching England proved a thorny one. The attitude of the\r\nImperial Government was plainly in favour of recognizing some legal\r\nvalue in the chartered rights of the Company, a thing denied by some,\r\nspecially Mr. McDougall. No progress was being made. At this juncture\r\nD'Israeli's Government was defeated, and a delay resulted in waiting for\r\na new Government. Earl Granville was the new Secretary of State for the\r\nColonies. While negotiations were going on, the Hudson's Bay Company\r\nsent in to the Secretary of State a rather hot complaint that Canadian\r\nsurveyors and road builders had entered upon their territory to the west\r\nof the Lake of the Woods. This was quite true, but the action had been\r\ntaken by the Canadian Government under the impression that all parties\r\nwould willingly agree to it. Not being at this juncture able to settle\r\nanything, the commissioners returned to Canada.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Government was, however, in earnest in the matter, and\r\npressed the Hudson's Bay Company to consent to reasonable terms,\r\nthe more that the government by the Company in Red River was not\r\nsatisfactory--an indisputable fact. At length the Company felt bound to\r\naccept the proposed terms. The main provisions of bargain were that the\r\nCompany should surrender all rights in Rupert's Land; that Canada pay\r\nthe Company the sum of three hundred thousand pounds; that the Company\r\nbe allowed certain blocks of land around their posts; that they be given\r\none-twentieth of the arable land of the country; and that the Company\r\nshould be allowed every privilege in carrying on trade as a regular\r\ntrading company. Thus was the concession of generous Charles the Second\r\nsurrendered after two centuries of honourable occupation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nTROUBLES OF THE TRANSFER OF RUPERT'S LAND.\r\n\r\n     Transfer Act passed--A moribund government--The\r\n     Canadian surveying party--Causes of the rebellion--Turbulent\r\n     Metis--American interference--Disloyal ecclesiastics--Governor\r\n     McDougall--Riel and his rebel band--A blameworthy Governor--The\r\n     \"blawsted fence\"--Seizure of Fort Garry--Riel's ambitions--Loyal\r\n     rising--Three wise men from the East--_The New Nation_--A\r\n     winter meeting--Bill of Rights--Canadian shot--The Wolseley\r\n     expedition--Three renegades slink away--The end of Company\r\n     rule--The new Province of Manitoba.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old Company had agreed to the bargain, and the Imperial Act was\r\npassed authorizing the transfer of the vast territory east of the Rocky\r\nMountains to Canada. Canada, with the strengthening national spirit\r\nrising from the young confederation, with pleasure saw the Dominion\r\nGovernment place in the estimates the three hundred thousand pounds\r\nfor the payment of the Hudson's Bay Company, and an Act was passed by\r\nthe Dominion Parliament providing for a government of the north-west\r\nterritories, which would secure the administration of justice, and the\r\npeace, order, and good government of Her Majesty's subjects and others.\r\nIt was enacted, however, that all laws of the territory at the time of\r\nthe passing of the Act should remain in force until amended or repealed,\r\nand all officers except the chief to continue in office until others\r\nwere appointed.\r\n\r\nAnd now began the most miserable and disreputable exhibition of\r\ndecrepitude, imbecility, jesuitry, foreign interference, blundering, and\r\nrash patriotism ever witnessed in the fur traders' country. This was\r\nknown as the Red River rebellion. The writer arrived in Fort Garry the\r\nyear following this wretched affair, made the acquaintance of many of\r\nthe actors in the rebellion, and heard their stories. The real, deep\r\nsignificance of this rebellion has never been fully made known. Whether\r\nthe writer will succeed in telling the whole tale remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson's Bay Company officials at Red River were still the\r\ngovernment. This fact must be distinctly borne in mind. It has been\r\nstated, however, that this government had become hopelessly weak and\r\ninefficient. Governor Dallas, in the words quoted, admitted this and\r\nlamented over it. Were there any doubt in regard to this statement, it\r\nwas shown by the utter defiance of the law in the breaking of jail in\r\nthe three cases of Corbett, Stewart, and Dr. Schultz. No government\r\ncould retain respect when the solemn behests of its courts were laughed\r\nat and despised. This is the real reason lying at the root of the\r\napathy of the English-speaking people of the Red River in dealing with\r\nthe rebellion. They were not cowards; they sprang from ancestors who\r\nhad fought Britain's battles; they were intelligent and moral; they\r\nloved their homes and were prepared to defend them; but they had no\r\nguarantee of leadership; they had no assurance that their efforts would\r\nbe given even the colour of legality; the broken-down jail outside\r\nFort Garry, its uprooted stockades and helpless old jailor, were the\r\nsymbol of governmental decrepitude and were the sport of any determined\r\nlaw-breaker.\r\n\r\nIt has been the habit of their opponents to refer to the annoyance\r\nof the Hudson's Bay Company Committee in London with Canada for in\r\n1869 sending surveyors to examine the country before the transfer was\r\nmade. Reference has also been made to the dissatisfaction of the local\r\nofficers at the action taken by the Company in dealing with the deed\r\npoll in 1863; some have said that the Hudson's Bay Company officials\r\nat Fort Garry did not admire the Canadian leaders as they saw them;\r\nand others have maintained that these officers cared nothing for the\r\ncountry, provided they received large enough dividends as wintering\r\npartners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SOUTH AND EAST FACES, 1840.\r\n  From sketch by wife of Governor Finlayson.\r\n\r\nIllustration:\r\n\r\n  EAST FACE, IN YEAR 1882, WHEN FORT WAS DISMANTLED.\r\n  X Spot where Scott was executed.\r\n\r\nFORT GARRY--WINTER SCENES.]\r\n\r\nNow, there may be something in these contentions, but they do not touch\r\nthe core of the matter. The Hudson's Bay Company, both in London and\r\nFort Garry, were thoroughly loyal to British institutions; the officers\r\nwere educated, responsible, and high-minded men; they had acted up to\r\ntheir light in a thoroughly honourable manner, and no mere prejudice, or\r\nfancied grievance, or personal dislike would have made them untrue to\r\ntheir trusts. But the government had become decrepit; vacillation and\r\nuncertainty characterized every act; had the people been behind them,\r\nhad they not felt that the people distrusted them, they would have taken\r\naction, as it was their duty to do.\r\n\r\nThe chronic condition of helplessness and governmental decay was\r\nemphasized and increased by a sad circumstance. Governor William\r\nMcTavish, an honourable and well-meaning man, was sick. In the midst\r\nof the troubles of 1863 he would willingly have resigned, as Governor\r\nDallas assures us; now he was physically incapable of the energy and\r\ndecision requisite under the circumstances. Moreover, as we shall\r\nsee, there was a most insidious and dangerous influence dogging his\r\nevery step. His subordinates would not act without him, he could not\r\nact without them, and thus an absolute deadlock ensued. Moreover, the\r\nCouncil of Assiniboia, an appointed body, had felt itself for years\r\nout of touch with the sentiment of the colony, and its efforts at\r\nlegislation resulted in no improvement of the condition of things. Woe\r\nto a country ruled by an oligarchy, however well-meaning or reputable\r\nsuch a body may be!\r\n\r\nTurn now from this picture of pitiful weakness to the unaccountable and\r\nculpable blundering of the Canadian Government. Cartier and McDougall\r\nfound out in England that sending in a party of surveyors before the\r\ncountry was transferred was offensive to the Hudson's Bay Company. More\r\noffensive still was the method of conducting the expedition. It was a\r\nmark of sublime stupidity to profess, as the Canadian Government did,\r\nto look upon the money spent on this survey as a benevolent device for\r\nrelieving the people suffering from the grasshopper visitation. The\r\ngenius who originated the plan of combining charity with gain should\r\nhave been canonized. Moreover, the plan of contractor Snow of paying\r\npoor wages, delaying payment, and giving harsh treatment to such a\r\npeople as the half-breeds are known to be was most ill advised. The\r\nevidently selfish and grasping spirit shown in this expedition sent to\r\nsurvey and build the Dawson Road, yet turning aside to claim unoccupied\r\nlands, to sow the seeds of doubt and suspicion in the minds of a people\r\nhitherto secluded from the world, was most unpatriotic and dangerous.\r\nIt cannot be denied, in addition, that while many of the small band\r\nof Canadians were reputable and hard-working men, the course of a few\r\nprominent leaders, who had made an illegitimate use of the Nor'-Wester\r\nnewspaper, had tended to keep the community in a state of alienation and\r\nturmoil.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, were the conditions? A helpless, moribund government,\r\nwithout decision, without actual authority on the one hand, and on\r\nthe other an irritating, selfish, and aggressive expedition, taking\r\npossession of the land before it was transferred to Canada, and assuming\r\nthe air of conquerors.\r\n\r\nLook now at the combustible elements awaiting this combination. The\r\nFrench half-breeds, descendants of the turbulent Bois Brûlés of Lord\r\nSelkirk's times; the old men, companions of Sayer and the elder Riel,\r\nwho defied the authority of the court, and left it shouting, \"Vive\r\nla liberté!\" now irritated by the Dawson Road being built in the way\r\njust described; the road running through the seigniory given by Lord\r\nSelkirk to the Roman Catholic bishop, the road in rear of their largest\r\nsettlements, and passing through another French settlement at Pointe des\r\nChênes! Further, the lands adjacent to these settlements, and naturally\r\nconnected with them, being seized by the intruders! Furthermore, the\r\nnatives, antagonized by the action of certain Canadians who had for\r\nyears maintained the country in a state of turmoil! Were there not all\r\nthe elements of an explosion of a serious and dangerous kind?\r\n\r\nTwo other most important forces in this complicated state of things\r\ncannot be left out. The first of these is a matter which requires\r\ncareful statement, but yet it is a most potential factor in the\r\nrebellion. This is the attitude of certain persons in the United States.\r\nFor twenty years and more the trade of the Red River settlement had been\r\nlargely carried on by way of St. Paul, in the State of Minnesota. The\r\nHudson Bay route and York boat brigade were unable to compete with the\r\nfacilities offered by the approach of the railway to the Mississippi\r\nRiver. Accordingly long lines of Red River carts took loads of furs to\r\nSt. Paul and brought back freight for the Company. The Red River trade\r\nwas a recognized source of profit in St. Paul. Familiarity in trade led\r\nto an interest on the part of the Americans in the public affairs of Red\r\nRiver. Hot-headed and sordid people in Red River settlement had actually\r\nspoken of the settlement being connected with the United States.\r\n\r\nNow that irritation was manifested at Red River, steps were taken by\r\nprivate parties from the United States to fan the flame. At Pembina, on\r\nthe border between Rupert's Land and the United States, lived a nest\r\nof desperadoes willing to take any steps to accomplish their purposes.\r\nThey had access to all the mails which came from England to Canada\r\nmarked \"Vià Pembina.\" Pembina was an outpost refuge for law-breakers\r\nand outcasts from the United States. Its people used all their power to\r\ndisturb the peace of Red River settlement. In addition, a considerable\r\nnumber of Americans had come to the little village of Winnipeg, now\r\nbeing begun near the walls of Fort Garry. These men held their private\r\nmeetings, all looking to the creation of trouble and the provocation of\r\nfeeling that might lead to change of allegiance. Furthermore, the writer\r\nis able to state, on the information of a man high in the service of\r\nCanada, and a man not unknown in Manitoba, that there was a large sum\r\nof money, of which an amount was named as high as one million dollars,\r\nwhich was available in St. Paul for the purpose of securing a hold by\r\nthe Americans on the fertile plains of Rupert's Land.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was an agency of most dangerous proportions, an element\r\nin the village of Winnipeg able to control the election of the first\r\ndelegate to the convention, a desperate body of men on the border, who\r\nwith Machiavelian persistence fanned the flame of discontent, and a\r\nreserve of power in St. Paul ready to take advantage of any emergency.\r\n\r\nA still more insidious and threatening influence was at work. Here\r\nagain the writer is aware of the gravity of the statement he is making,\r\nbut he has evidence of the clearest kind for his position. A dangerous\r\nreligious element in the country--ecclesiastics from old France--who\r\nhad no love for Britain, no love for Canada, no love for any country,\r\nno love for society, no love for peace! These plotters were in close\r\nassociation with the half-breeds, dictated their policy, and freely\r\nmingled with the rebels. One of them was an intimate friend of the\r\nleader of the rebellion, consulted with him in his plans, and exercised\r\na marked influence on his movements. This same foreign priest, with\r\nJesuitical cunning, gave close attendance on the sick Governor, and\r\nthrough his family exercised a constant and detrimental power upon\r\nthe only source of authority then in the land. Furthermore, an Irish\r\nstudent and teacher, with a Fenian hatred of all things British, was a\r\n\"familiar\" of the leader of the rebellion, and with true Milesian zeal\r\nadvanced the cause of the revolt.\r\n\r\nCan a more terrible combination be imagined than this? A decrepit\r\ngovernment with the executive officer sick; a rebellious and chronically\r\ndissatisfied Metis element; a government at Ottawa far removed by\r\ndistance, committing with unvarying regularity blunder after blunder;\r\na greedy and foreign cabal planning to seize the country, and a secret\r\nJesuitical plot to keep the Governor from action and to incite the fiery\r\nMetis to revolt!\r\n\r\nThe drama opens with the appointment, in September, 1869, by\r\nthe Dominion Government, of the Hon. William McDougall as\r\nLieutenant-Governor of the north-west territories, his departure from\r\nToronto, and his arrival at Pembina, in the Dakota territory, in the\r\nend of October. He was accompanied by his family, a small staff, and\r\nthree hundred stand of arms with ammunition. He had been preceded by\r\nthe Hon. Joseph Howe, of the Dominion Government, who visited the Red\r\nRiver settlement ostensibly to feel the pulse of public opinion, but as\r\nCommissioner gaining little information. Mr. McDougall's commission as\r\nGovernor was to take effect after the formal transfer of the territory.\r\nHe reached Pembina, where he was served with a notice not to enter\r\nthe territory, yet he crossed the boundary line at Pembina, and took\r\npossession of the Hudson's Bay Fort of West Lynn, two miles north of the\r\nboundary.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a storm was brewing along Red River. A young French\r\nhalf-breed, Louis Riel, son of the excitable miller of the Seine of whom\r\nmention was made--a young man, educated by the Roman Catholic Bishop\r\nTaché, of St. Boniface, for a time, and afterwards in Montreal, was\r\nregarded as the hope of the Metis. He was a young man of fair ability,\r\nbut proud, vain, and assertive, and had the ambition to be a Cæsar or\r\nNapoleon. He with his followers had stopped the surveyors in their work,\r\nand threatened to throw off the approaching tyranny. Professing to be\r\nloyal to Britain but hostile to Canada, he succeeded, in October, in\r\ngetting a small body of French half-breeds to seize the main highway at\r\nSt. Norbert, some nine miles south of Fort Garry.\r\n\r\nThe message to Mr. McDougall not to enter the territory was forwarded by\r\nthis body, that already considered itself the _de facto_ government. A\r\nCanadian settler at once swore an affidavit before the officer in charge\r\nof Fort Garry that an armed party of French half-breeds had assembled to\r\noppose the entrance of the Governor.\r\n\r\nHere, then, was the hour of destiny. An outbreak had taken place, it was\r\nillegal to oppose any man entering the country, not to say a Governor,\r\nthe fact of revolt was immediately brought to Fort Garry, and no amount\r\nof casuistry or apology can ever justify Governor McTavish, sick though\r\nhe was, from immediately not taking action, and compelling his council\r\nto take action by summoning the law-abiding people to surround him and\r\nrepress the revolt. But the government that would allow the defiance of\r\nthe law by permitting men to live at liberty who had broken jail could\r\nnot be expected to take action. To have done so would have been to work\r\na miracle.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion went on apace; two of the so-called Governor's staff\r\npushed on to the barricade erected at St. Norbert. Captain Cameron,\r\none of them, with eyeglass in poise, and with affected authority,\r\ngave command, \"Remove that blawsted fence,\" but the half-breeds were\r\nunyielding. The two messengers returned to Pembina, where they found Mr.\r\nMcDougall likewise driven back and across the boundary. Did ever British\r\nprestige suffer a more humiliating blow?\r\n\r\nThe act of rebellion, usually dangerous, proved in this case a trivial\r\none, and Riel's little band of forty or fifty badly-armed Metis began\r\nto grow. The mails were seized, freight coming into the country became\r\nbooty, and the experiment of a rising was successful. In the meantime\r\nthe authorities of Fort Garry were inactive. The rumour came that Riel\r\nthought of seizing the fort. An affidavit of the chief of police under\r\nthe Government shows that he urged the master of Fort Garry to meet the\r\ndanger, and asked authority to call upon a portion of the special police\r\nforce sworn in, shortly before, to preserve the peace. No Governor\r\nspoke; no one even closed the fort as a precaution; its gates stood wide\r\nopen to friend or foe.\r\n\r\nThis exhibition of helplessness encouraged the conspirators, and\r\nRiel and one hundred of his followers (November 2nd) unopposed took\r\npossession of the fort and quartered themselves upon the Company. In\r\nthe front part of the fort lived the Governor; he was now flanked by a\r\nbody-guard of rebels; the master of the fort, a burly son of Britain,\r\nthough very gruff and out of sorts, could do nothing, and the young\r\nNapoleon of the Metis fattened on the best of the land.\r\n\r\nRiel now issued a proclamation, calling on the English-speaking parishes\r\nof the settlement to elect twelve representatives to meet the President\r\nand representatives of the French-speaking population, appointing a\r\nmeeting for twelve days afterwards.\r\n\r\nMr. McDougall, on hearing of the seizure of the fort, wrote to\r\nGovernor McTavish stating that as the Hudson Bay Company was still the\r\ngovernment, action should be taken to disperse the rebels. A number\r\nof loyal inhabitants also petitioned Governor McTavish to issue his\r\nproclamation calling on the rebels to disperse. The sick and helpless\r\nGovernor, fourteen days after the seizure of the fort and twenty-three\r\ndays after the affidavit of the rising, issued a tardy proclamation\r\ncondemning the rebels and calling upon them to disperse. The Convention\r\nmet November 16th, the English parishes having been cajoled into\r\nelecting delegates, thinking thus to soothe the troubled land. After\r\nmeeting and discussing in hot and useless words the state of affairs,\r\nthe Convention adjourned till December 1st, it being evident, however,\r\nthat Riel desired to form a provisional government of which he should be\r\nthe joy and pride.\r\n\r\nThe day for the reassembling of the Convention arrived. Riel and his\r\nparty insisted on ruling the meeting, and passed a \"Bill of Rights\"\r\nconsisting of fifteen provisions. The English people refused to accept\r\nthese propositions, and, after vainly endeavouring to take steps to meet\r\nMr. McDougall, withdrew to their homes, ashamed and confounded.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. McDougall was chafing at the strange and humiliating\r\nsituation in which he found himself. With his family and staff poorly\r\nhoused at Pembina and the severe winter coming on, he could scarcely\r\nbe blamed for irritation and discontent. December 1st was the day on\r\nwhich he expected his commission as Governor to come into effect,\r\nand wonder of wonders, he, a lawyer, a privy councillor, and an\r\nexperienced statesman, went so far on this mere supposition as to issue\r\na proclamation announcing his appointment as Governor. As a matter of\r\nfact, far away from communication with Ottawa, he was mistaken as to\r\nthe transfer. On account of the rise of the rebellion this had not\r\nbeen made, and Mr. McDougall, in issuing a spurious proclamation,\r\nbecame a thing of contempt to the insurgents, an object of pity to the\r\nloyalists, and the laughing-stock of the whole world. His proclamation\r\nat the same time authorizing Colonel Dennis, the Canadian surveyor in\r\nRed River settlement, to raise a force to put down the rebellion, was\r\nsimply a _brutum fulmen_, and was the cause to innocent, well-meaning\r\nmen of trouble and loss. Colonel Dennis succeeded in raising a force\r\nof some four hundred men, and would not probably have failed had it\r\nnot transpired that the two proclamations were illegal and that the\r\nlevies were consequently unauthorized. Such a thing to be carried out\r\nby William McDougall and Colonel Dennis, men of experience and ability!\r\nSurely there could be no greater fiasco!\r\n\r\nThe Canadian people were now in a state of the greatest excitement, and\r\nthe Canadian Government, aware of its blundering and stupidity, hastened\r\nto rectify its mistakes. Commissioners were sent to negotiate with\r\nthe various parties in Red River settlement. These were Vicar-General\r\nThibault, who had spent long years in the Roman Catholic Missions of the\r\nNorth-West, Colonel de Salaberry, a French Canadian, and Mr. Donald A.\r\nSmith, the chief officer of the Hudson's Bay Company, then at Montreal.\r\nOn the last of these Commissioners, who had been clothed with very wide\r\npowers, lay the chief responsibility, as will be readily seen.\r\n\r\nA number of Canadians--nearly fifty--had been assembled in the store\r\nof Dr. Schultz, at the village of Winnipeg, and, on the failure of Mr.\r\nMcDougall's proclamation, were left in a very awkward condition. With\r\narms in their hands, they were looked upon by Riel as dangerous, and\r\nwith promises of freedom and of the intention of Riel to meet McDougall\r\nand settle the whole matter, they (December 7th) surrendered. Safely in\r\nthe fort and in the prison outside the wall, the prisoners were kept by\r\nthe truce-breaker, and the Metis contingent celebrated the victory by\r\nnumerous potations of rum taken from the Hudson's Bay Company stores.\r\n\r\nRiel now took a step forward in issuing a proclamation, which has\r\ngenerally been attributed to the crippled postmaster at Pembina, one of\r\nthe dangerous foreign clique longing to seize the settlement. He also\r\nhoisted a new flag, with the fleur-de-lis worked upon it, thus giving\r\nevidence of his disloyalty and impudence. Other acts of injustice, such\r\nas seizing Company funds and interfering with personal liberty, were\r\ncommitted by him.\r\n\r\nOn December 27th--a memorable day--Mr. Donald A. Smith arrived. His\r\ncommission and papers were left at Pembina, and he went directly to Fort\r\nGarry, where Riel received him. The interview, given in Mr. Smith's\r\nown words, was a remarkable one. Riel vainly sought to induce the\r\nCommissioner to recognize his government, and yet was afraid to show\r\ndisrespect to so high and honoured an officer. For about two months\r\nCommissioner Smith lived at Fort Garry, in a part of the same building\r\nas Governor McTavish.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith says of this period, \"The state of matters at this time was\r\nmost unsatisfactory and truly humiliating. Upwards of fifty British\r\nsubjects were held in close confinement as political prisoners; security\r\nfor persons or property there was none.... The leaders of the French\r\nhalf-breeds had declared their determination to use every effort for the\r\npurpose of annexing the territory to the United States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Smith acted with great wisdom and decision. His plan evidently\r\nwas to have no formal breach with Riel but gradually to undermine him,\r\nand secure a combination by which he could be overthrown. Many of\r\nthe influential men of the settlement called upon Mr. Smith, and the\r\naffairs of the country were discussed. Riel was restless and at times\r\nimpertinent, but the Commissioner exercised his Scottish caution, and\r\nbided his time.\r\n\r\nAt this time a newspaper, called _The New Nation_, appeared as the organ\r\nof the provisional government. This paper openly advocated annexation\r\nto the United States, thus showing the really dangerous nature of the\r\nmovement embodied in the rebellion.\r\n\r\nDuring all these months of the rebellion, Bishop Taché, the influential\r\nhead of the Roman Catholic Church, had been absent in Rome at the\r\ngreat Council of that year. One of his most active priests left behind\r\nwas Father Lestanc, the prince of plotters, who has generally been\r\ncredited with belonging to the Jesuit Order. Lestanc had sedulously\r\nhaunted the presence of the Governor; he was a daring and extreme man,\r\nand to him and his fellow-Frenchman, the curé of St. Norbert, much of\r\nRiel's obstinacy has been attributed. Commissioner Smith now used his\r\nopportunity to weaken Riel. He offered to send for his commission to\r\nPembina, if he were allowed to meet the people. Riel consented to this.\r\nThe commission was sent for, and Riel tried to intercept the messenger,\r\nbut failed to do so. The meeting took place on January 19th. It was a\r\ndate of note for Red River settlement. One thousand people assembled,\r\nand as there was no building capable of holding the people, the meeting\r\ntook place in the open air, the temperature being twenty below zero.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this meeting was the election and subsequent assembling\r\nof forty representatives--one half French, the other half English--to\r\nconsider the matter of Commissioner Smith's message. Six days after\r\nthe open-air meeting the Convention met. A second \"Bill of Rights\"\r\nwas adopted, and it was agreed to send delegates to Ottawa to meet\r\nthe Dominion Government. A provisional government was formed, at the\r\nrequest, it is said, of Governor McTavish, and Riel gained the height\r\nof his ambition in being made President, while the fledgling Fenian\r\npriest, O'Donoghue, became \"Secretary of the Treasury.\"\r\n\r\nThe retention of the prisoners in captivity aroused a deep feeling\r\nin the country, and a movement originated in Portage La Prairie to\r\nrescue the unfortunates. This force was joined by recruits at Kildonan,\r\nmaking up six hundred in all. Awed by this gathering, Riel released\r\nthe prisoners, though he was guilty of an act of deepest treachery in\r\narresting nearly fifty of the Assiniboine levy as they were returning\r\nto their homes. Among them was Major Boulton, who afterwards narrowly\r\nescaped execution, and who has written an interesting account of the\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the two parties of loyalists, and their easy capture by\r\nRiel, raises the question of the wisdom of these efforts. No doubt the\r\ninspiring motive of these levies was in many cases true patriotism, and\r\nit reflects credit on them as men of British blood and British pluck,\r\nbut the management of both was so unfortunate and so lacking in skill,\r\nthat one is disposed, though lamenting their failures, to put these\r\nexpeditions down as dictated by the greatest rashness.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of Riel served to awaken high ambitions. The late\r\nArchbishop Taché, in a later rebellion, characterized Riel as a\r\nremarkable example of inflated ambition, and called his state of\r\nmind that of \"megalomania.\" Riel now became more irritable and\r\ndomineering. He seemed also bitter against the English for the signs\r\nof insubordination appearing in all the parishes. The influence of the\r\nviolent and dastardly Lestanc was strong upon him. The anxious President\r\nnow determined to awe the English, and condemned for execution a young\r\nIrish Canadian prisoner named Thomas Scott. Commissioner Smith and a\r\nnumber of influential inhabitants did everything possible to dissuade\r\nRiel, but he persisted, and Scott was publicly executed near Fort Garry\r\non March 4th, 1870.\r\n\r\n\"Whom the gods destroy, they first make mad.\" The execution of Scott\r\nwas the death-knell of Riel's hopes. Canada was roused to its centre.\r\nDetermined to have no further communication with Riel, Commissioner\r\nSmith as soon as possible left Fort Garry and returned to Canada.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Bishop Taché, who had returned at the request of the\r\nCanadian Government, took place in due time. Probably the real attitude\r\nof Bishop Taché will never be known, though his strong French Canadian\r\nassociations and love of British connection make it seem hardly possible\r\nthat he could have been implicated in the rebellion. Bishop Taché\r\nendeavoured to overcome the terrible mistake of Riel. Commissioners were\r\ndespatched to Ottawa, the most important of them Father Ritchot, of St.\r\nNorbert, whose hand had been in the plot from the beginning. Carrying\r\ndown a \"Bill of Rights\" from the provisional government, which, however,\r\nthere is clear evidence Ritchot and others took the liberty of altering,\r\nthey were instrumental in having a Bill passed through the Dominion\r\nParliament, establishing Manitoba as a province.\r\n\r\nFor the establishment of peace, an expedition was organized by Canada,\r\nconsisting of British regulars and Canadian volunteers, under Colonel\r\nWolseley. Coming from Canada up the fur-traders' route, through Lake\r\nof the Woods, down Winnipeg River, across Lake Winnipeg, and up the\r\nRed River, the expedition arrived, to the great joy of the suffering\r\npeople of the settlement, on August 24th, 1870. After eleven months of\r\nthe most torturing anxiety had been endured, the sight of the rescuing\r\nsoldiery sent the blood pulsing again through their veins. As the\r\ntroops approached Fort Garry, three slinking figures were seen to leave\r\nthe fort and escape across the Assiniboine. These were the \"President\r\nRiel,\" \"Adjutant-General\" Lepine, and the scoundrel O'Donoghue. \"They\r\nfolded their tents like the Arabs, and as silently stole away.\" Colonel\r\nWolseley says, \"The troops then formed line outside the fort, the Union\r\nJack was hoisted, a royal salute fired, and three cheers were given for\r\nthe Queen, which were caught up and heartily re-echoed by many of the\r\ncivilians and settlers who had followed the troops from the village.\"\r\n\r\nThe transfer of Rupert's Land had been completed, and the governing\r\npower of the famous old Company was a thing of the past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nPRESENT STATUS OF THE COMPANY.\r\n\r\n     A great land Company--Fort Garry dismantled--The new\r\n     buildings--New _v._ Old--New life in the Company--Palmy days\r\n     are recalled--Governors of ability--The present distinguished\r\n     Governor--Vaster operations--Its eye not dimmed.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelieved of the burden of government, the Hudson's Bay Company threw\r\nitself heartily into the work of developing its resources. Mr. Donald A.\r\nSmith, who had done so much to undermine the power of Riel, returned to\r\nManitoba as Chief Commissioner of the Company, and proceeded to manage\r\nits affairs in the altered conditions of the country. Representing\r\nenormous interests in the North-West, Mr. Smith entered the first local\r\nlegislature at Winnipeg, and soon after became for a time a member of\r\nthe Canadian House of Commons. One of the most important matters needing\r\nattention was the land interests of the Company. The Company claimed\r\nfive hundred acres around Fort Garry. This great tract of land, covering\r\nnow one of the most important parts of the City of Winnipeg, was used\r\nas a camping-ground, where the traders from the far west posts, even as\r\nfar as Edmonton, made their \"corrals\" and camped during their stay at\r\nthe capital. Some opposition was developed to this claim, but the block\r\nof land was at length handed over to the Company, fifty acres being\r\nreserved for public purposes.\r\n\r\nThe allotment of wild land to the Company of one-twentieth went on in\r\neach township as it was surveyed, and though all this land is taxable,\r\nyet it has become a great source of revenue to the Company. Important\r\nsites and parcels of land all over the country have helped to swell its\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nThe great matter of adapting its agencies to meet the changed\r\nconditions of trade was a difficult thing. The methods of two\r\ncenturies could not be changed in a day. The greatest difficulty lay in\r\nthe officers and men remote from the important centres. It was reported\r\nthat in many of the posts no thorough method of book-keeping prevailed.\r\nThe dissatisfaction arising from the sale made by the Company in 1863,\r\nand the uncertainty as to the deed poll, no doubt introduced an element\r\nof fault-finding and discontent into the Company's business. Some of\r\nthe most trusted officers retired from the service. The resources of\r\nthe Company were, however, enormous, its credit being practically\r\nunlimited, and this gave it a great advantage in competing with the\r\nCanadian merchants coming to the country, the majority of whom had\r\nlittle capital. Ten years after the transfer Fort Garry was sold, and\r\nthough it came back on the hands of the Company, yet _miserabile dictu_,\r\nthe fort had been dismantled, thrown down, and even the stone removed,\r\nwith the exception of the front gate, which still remains. This gate,\r\nwith a portion of ground about it, has been given by the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany to the City of Winnipeg as a small historic park. Since the time\r\nof sale, large warehouses have been erected, not filled, as were the old\r\nshops, with bright coloured cloths, moccasins, and beads, fitted for the\r\nIndian and native trade, but aiming at full departments after the model\r\nof Maple and Shoolbred, of the mother city of London. These shops are\r\nrepresented in the plate accompanying this description.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY'S STORES AND GENERAL OFFICES,\r\nWINNIPEG.]\r\n\r\nThe trade thus modified has been under the direction of men of ability,\r\nwho succeeded Mr. Donald A. Smith, such as Messrs. Wrigley, Brydges,\r\nand a number of able subordinates. The extension of trade has gone on\r\nin many of the rising towns of the Canadian West, where the Hudson's\r\nBay Company was not before represented, such as Portage La Prairie,\r\nCalgary, Lethbridge, Prince Albert, Vancouver, &c. In all these points\r\nthe Company's influence has been a very real and important one.\r\n\r\nThe methods of trade, now employed, require a skill and knowledge never\r\nneeded in the old fur-trading days. The present successful Commissioner,\r\nC. C. Chipman, Esq., resident in Winnipeg, controls and directs\r\ninterests far greater than Sir George Simpson was called upon to deal\r\nwith. Present and Past presents a contrast between ceaseless competition\r\nand a sleepy monopoly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMISSIONER CHIPMAN (WINNIPEG).\r\n\r\nExecutive Officer of H.B. Co. in Canada.]\r\n\r\nThe portions of the country not reached, or likely to be reached by\r\nsettlement, have remained in possession of the Hudson's Bay Company\r\nalmost solely. The Canadian Government has negotiated treaties with the\r\nIndians as far north as Lake Athabasca, leaving many of the Chipewyans\r\nand Eskimos still to the entire management of the Company.\r\n\r\nThe impression among the officers of the Company is that under the\r\ndeed poll of 1871 they are not so well remunerated as under the former\r\nrégime. It is difficult to estimate the exact relation of the present\r\nto the past, inasmuch as the opening up of the country, the improvement\r\nof transportation facilities, and the cheapening of all agricultural\r\nsupplies has changed the relative value of money in the country. Under\r\nthis arrangement, which has been in force for twenty-four years,\r\nthe profits of the wintering partners are divided on the basis of\r\none-hundredth of a share. Of this an inspecting chief factor receives\r\nthree shares; a chief factor two and a half; a factor two; and a chief\r\ntrader one and a half shares. The average for the twenty-five years of\r\nthe one-hundredth share has been 213_l._ 12_s._ 2-1/2_d._ Since 1890 a\r\nmore liberal provision has been made for officers retiring, and since\r\nthat time an officer on withdrawing in good standing receives two years'\r\nfull pay and six years' half pay. Later years have seen a further\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nA visit to the Hudson's Bay House on the corner of Leadenhall and Lime\r\nStreets, London, still gives one a sense of the presence of the old\r\nCompany. While in the New World great changes have taken place, and\r\nthe visitor is struck with the complete departure from the low-ceiling\r\nstore, with goods in disorder and confusion, with Metis smoking\r\n\"kinni-kinnik\" till the atmosphere is opaque--all this to the palatial\r\nbuildings with the most perfect arrangements and greatest taste; yet\r\nin London \"the old order changeth\" but slowly. It is true the old\r\nbuilding on Fenchurch Street, London, where \"the old Lady\" was said by\r\nthe Nor'-Westers to sit, was sold in 1859, and the proceeds divided\r\namong the shareholders and officers for four years thereafter. But\r\nthe portraits of Prince Rupert, Sir George Simpson, and the copy of\r\nthe Company Charter were transferred bodily to the directors' room in\r\nthe building on Lime Street. The strong room contains the same rows of\r\nminutes, the same dusty piles of documents, and the journals of bygone\r\nyears, but the business of a vast region is still managed there, and the\r\nold gentlemen who control the Hudson's Bay Company affairs pass their\r\ndividends as comfortably as in years gone by, with, in an occasional\r\nyear, some restless spirit stirring up the echoes, to be promptly\r\nrepressed and the current of events to go on as before.\r\n\r\nSince 1871, however, it is easy to see that men of greater financial\r\nability have been at the head of the councils of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany, recalling the palmy days of the first operations of the\r\nCompany. After five years' service, Sir Edmund Head, the first Governor\r\nunder the new deed poll, gave way, to be followed for a year by the\r\ndistinguished politician and statesman, the Earl of Kimberley. For five\r\nyears thereafter, Sir Stafford Northcote, who held high Government\r\noffice in the service of the Empire, occupied this position. He\r\nwas followed for six years by one who has since gained a very high\r\nreputation for financial ability, the Rt. Hon. G. J. Goschen. Eden\r\nColville, who seems to carry us back to the former generation--a man\r\nof brisk and alert mind, and singularly free from the prejudices and\r\nimmobility of Governor Berens, the last of the barons of the old\r\nrégime--held office for three years after Mr. Goschen.\r\n\r\nFor the last ten years the veteran of kindly manner, warm heart, and\r\ngenial disposition, Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal, has occupied this\r\nhigh place. The clerk, junior officer, and chief factor of thirty\r\nhard years on the inhospitable shores of Hudson Bay and Labrador, the\r\nCommissioner who, as Donald A. Smith, soothed the Riel rebellion, and\r\nfor years directed the reorganization of the Company's affairs at Fort\r\nGarry and the whole North-West, the daring speculator who took hold,\r\nwith his friends, of the Minnesota and Manitoba Railway, and with Midas\r\ntouch turned the enterprise to gold, a projector and a builder of the\r\nCanadian Pacific Railway, the patron of art and education, has worthily\r\nfilled the office of Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, and with\r\nmuch success reorganized its administration and directed its affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Company's operations are vaster than ever before. The greatest\r\nmercantile enterprise of the Greater Canada west of Lake Superior; a\r\nstrong land Company, still keeping up its traditions and conducting a\r\nlarge trade in furs; owning vessels and transportation facilities; able\r\nto take large contracts; exercising a fatherly care over the Indian\r\ntribes; the helper and assistant of the vast missionary organizations\r\nscattered over Northern Canada, the Company since the transfer of\r\nRupert's Land to Canada has taken a new lease of life; its eye is not\r\ndim, nor its natural force abated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE OF THE CANADIAN WEST.\r\n\r\n     The Greater Canada--Wide wheat fields--Vast pasture\r\n     lands--Huronian mines--The Kootenay riches--Yukon\r\n     nuggets--Forests--Iron and coal--Fisheries--Two great cities--Towns\r\n     and villages--Anglo-Saxon institutions--The great outlook.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1871, soon after Rupert's Land and the Indian territories were\r\ntransferred to Canada, it was the fortune of the writer to take up his\r\nabode in Winnipeg, as the village in the neighbourhood of Fort Garry was\r\nalready called. The railway was in that year still four hundred miles\r\nfrom Winnipeg. From the terminus in Minnesota the stage coach drawn by\r\nfour horses, with relays every twenty miles, sped rapidly over prairies\r\nsmooth as a lawn to the site of the future City of the Plains.\r\n\r\nThe fort was in its glory. Its stone walls, round bastions, threatening\r\npieces of artillery and rows of portholes, spoke of a place of some\r\nstrength, though even then a portion of stone wall had been taken down\r\nto give easier access to the \"Hudson's Bay Store.\" It was still the seat\r\nof government, for the Canadian Governor lived within its walls, as the\r\nlast Company Governor, McTavish, had done. It was still the scene of\r\ngaiety, as the better class of the old settlers united with the leaders\r\nof the new Canadian society in social joys, under the hospitable roof of\r\nGovernor Archibald.\r\n\r\nSince that time forty years have well-nigh passed. The stage coach,\r\nthe Red River cart, and the shagganappe pony are things of the past,\r\nand great railways with richly furnished trains connect St. Paul and\r\nMinnesota with the City of Winnipeg. More important still, the skill\r\nof the engineer has blasted a way through the Archæan rocks to Fort\r\nWilliam, Lake Superior, more direct than the old fur-traders' route;\r\nthe tremendous cliffs of the north shore of Lake Superior have been\r\nlevelled and the chasm bridged. To the west the prairies have been\r\ngridironed with numerous lines of railway, the enormous ascents of the\r\nfour Rocky Mountain ranges rising a mile above the sea level have been\r\ncrossed, and the giddy heights of the Fraser River cañon traversed.\r\nThe iron band of the Canadian Pacific Railway, one of whose chief\r\npromoters was Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal, the present Governor of\r\nthe Company, has joined ocean to ocean. The Canadian Northern Railway\r\nruns its line from Lake Superior through Winnipeg and Edmonton to\r\nBritish Columbia. It has in prospect a transcontinental Railway from the\r\nAtlantic to the Pacific Ocean. The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway has in\r\noperation a perfectly built line from Lake Superior through Winnipeg and\r\nEdmonton to the Rocky Mountains, and with the backing of the Canadian\r\nGovernment guarantees a most complete connection between the eastern and\r\nwestern shores of the continent.\r\n\r\nA wonderful transformation has taken place in the land since the days\r\nof Sir George Simpson and his band of active chief factors and traders.\r\nIt is true, portions of the wide territory reaching from Labrador\r\nto the Pacific Ocean will always be the domain of the fur-trader.\r\nThe Labrador, Ungava, and Arctic shores of Canada will always remain\r\ninhospitable, but the Archæan region on the south and west of Hudson Bay\r\nundoubtedly contains great mineral treasures. The Canadian Government\r\npledges itself to a completed railway from the prairie wheat fields to\r\nYork Factory on Hudson Bay. This will bring the seaport on Hudson Bay\r\nas near Britain as is New York, and will make an enormous saving in\r\ntransportation to Western Canada. What a mighty change from the day when\r\nthe pessimistic French King spoke of all Canada, as \"only a few orpents\r\nof snow.\" Mackenzie River district is still the famous scene of the fur\r\ntrade, and may long continue so, though there is always the possibility\r\nof any portion of the vast waste of the Far North developing, as the\r\nYukon territory has done, mineral wealth rivalling the famous sands of\r\nPactolus or the riches of King Solomon's mines.\r\n\r\nUnder Canadian sway, law and order are preserved throughout this wide\r\ndomain, although the Hudson's Bay Company officers still administer\r\nlaw and in many cases are magistrates or officers for the Government,\r\nreceiving their commissions from Ottawa. Peace and order prevail; the\r\narm of the law has been felt in Keewatin, the Mackenzie River, and\r\ndistant Yukon.\r\n\r\nBut it is to the fertile prairies of the West and valleys and slopes\r\nof the Pacific Coast we look for the extension of the Greater Canada.\r\nWhile the Hon. William McDougall was arguing the value of the prairie\r\nland of the West, his Canadian and other opponents maintained \"that in\r\nthe North-West the soil never thawed out in summer, and that the potato\r\nor cabbage would not mature.\" With this opinion many of the Hudson's\r\nBay Company officers agreed, though it is puzzling to the resident\r\nof the prairie to-day to see how such honourable and observing men\r\ncould have made such statements. The fertile plains have been divided\r\ninto three great provinces, Manitoba (1871), Saskatchewan and Alberta\r\n(1905). Manitoba, which at the time of the closing of the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany régime numbered some 12,000 or 15,000 whites and half-breeds\r\nand as many more Indians, has (in 1909) a population of well-nigh half\r\na million--the city of Winnipeg itself exceeding more than one quarter\r\nof that number. Saskatchewan and Alberta probably make up between them\r\nanother half million of people in this prairie section. These being the\r\nthree great bread-providing provinces of the Dominion, produced in 1909\r\non 297,000,000 of acres, which is but 8 per cent. of their total arable\r\nland, of wheat, oats, barley and flax, 132-1/3 million dollars' worth of\r\ncereals.\r\n\r\nThe City of Winnipeg, which, when the writer first saw the hamlet\r\nbearing that name, had less than three hundred souls, has now become a\r\nbeautiful city, which drew forth the admiration of the whole British\r\nAssociation on the occasion of their visit to it in 1909. Its assessment\r\nin 1910 was 157-3/5 millions of dollars, and the amount of building in\r\nthat year reached 11,000,000 dollars. The city has under construction\r\nat Winnipeg River, fifty miles from the city, 60,000 horsepower of\r\nelectric energy, which will be transmitted by cable to the city in\r\n1911 for manufacturing purposes. Up till 1882 the Hudson's Bay Company\r\nstore was a low building, a wooden erection made of lumber sawn by\r\nwhip-saw or by some rude contrivance, having what was known in the\r\nold Red River days as a \"pavilion roof.\" Its highly-coloured fabrics\r\nsuited to the trade of the country did not relieve its dingy interior.\r\nTo-day the Hudson's Bay Company departmental stores and offices, built\r\nof dark red St. Louis brick, speak of the enormous progress made in\r\nthe development of the country. The Hudson's Bay Company store, great\r\nas it now is, has been equalled and even perhaps surpassed by private\r\nenterprises of great magnitude. Winnipeg, as being from its geographical\r\nposition half way between the international boundary line and Lake\r\nWinnipeg, is the natural gateway between Eastern and Western Canada. It\r\nis becoming the greatest railway centre of Canada, and is familiarly\r\nspoken of as the \"Chicago of Western Canada.\" It bids fair also to be a\r\ngreat manufacturing centre. In spite of its recent date and unfinished\r\nfacilities for power its manufactured output has grown from 8-2/3\r\nmillions of dollars in 1900 to 25,000,000 in 1910. From 1902, when its\r\nbank clearings were 188-1/3 millions of dollars, these grew in 1909\r\nto 770-2/3 millions. All this is not surprising when the marvellous\r\nimmigration and consequent development is shown by the railway mileage\r\nof Western Canada, which has grown from 3,680 miles in 1900 to 11,472\r\nmiles in 1909; and when the annual product, chiefly of cattle and\r\nhorses, reached in the latter year the sum of 175,000,000 of dollars.\r\n\r\nBritish Columbia, including the New Caledonia, Kootenay Country, and\r\nVancouver Island of the fur-traders, is a land of great resources.\r\nIts population has increased many times over. Its great salmon\r\nfisheries, trade in timber, coal mines, agricultural productiveness,\r\nand genial climate have long made it a favourite dwelling-place for\r\nEnglish-speaking colonists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PARLIAMENT BUILDINGS, VICTORIA, B.C.\r\n\r\nWith statue of Capt. George Vancouver above; figures of Sir James\r\nDouglas and Chief Justice Begbie in niches; and the obelisk of Sir James\r\nDouglas, erected by the people of British Columbia.]\r\n\r\nIn late years much prominence has been given to this province by the\r\ndiscovery of its mineral products. Gold, silver, and lead mines in\r\nthe Kootenay region, which was discovered by old David Thompson, and\r\nin the Cariboo district, have lately attracted many immigrants to\r\nBritish Columbia; the adjoining territory of the Yukon, brought to the\r\nknowledge of the world by Chief Factor Robert Campbell, has surpassed\r\nall other parts of the fur-traders' land in rich productiveness,\r\nalthough the region lying between the Lake of the Woods and Lake\r\nSuperior, along the very route of the fur-traders, is becoming famous by\r\nits production of gold, silver, and other valuable metals.\r\n\r\nThroughout the wide West great deposits of coal and iron are found, the\r\nbasis of future manufactures, and in many districts great forests to\r\nsupply to the world material for increasing development.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is to be the future of this Canadian West? The possibilities\r\nare illimitable. The Anglo-Saxon race, with its energy and pluck, has\r\nlaid hold of the land so long shut in by the wall built round it by the\r\nfur-traders. This race, with its dominating forcefulness, will absorb\r\nand harmonize elements coming from all parts of the world to enjoy the\r\nfertile fields and mineral treasures of a land whose laws are just,\r\nwhose educational policy is thorough and progressive, whose moral and\r\nreligious aspirations are high and noble, and which gives a hearty\r\nwelcome to the industrious and deserving from all lands.\r\n\r\nThe flow of population to the Canadian West during the first decade of\r\nthis century has been remarkable. Not only has there been a vast British\r\nimmigration of the best kind, but some 150,000 to 200,000 of industrious\r\nsettlers from the continent of Europe have come to build the railways,\r\ncanals, and public works of the country, and they have been essential\r\nfor its agricultural development. Several hundreds of thousands of the\r\nbest settlers have come from the United States, a large proportion of\r\nthem being returned Canadians or the children of Canadians.\r\n\r\nOn the shores of Burrard Inlet on the Pacific Ocean another place of\r\ngreat importance is rising--Vancouver City, the terminus of the Canadian\r\nPacific Railway. Victoria, begun, as we have seen, by Chief Factor\r\nDouglas as the chief fort along the Pacific Coast, long held its own as\r\nthe commercial as well as the political capital of British Columbia,\r\nbut in the meantime Vancouver has surpassed it in population, if not in\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nAll goes to show that the Hudson's Bay Company was preserving for the\r\ngenerations to come a most valuable heritage. The leaders of opinion\r\nin Canada have frequently, within the last five years of the century,\r\nexpressed their opinion that the second generation of the twentieth\r\ncentury may see a larger Canadian population to the West of Lake\r\nSuperior than will be found in the provinces of the East. William Cullen\r\nBryant's lines, spoken of other prairies, will surely come true of the\r\nwide Canadian plains:--\r\n\r\n                                \"I listen long\r\n                            ... and think I hear\r\n    The sound of that advancing multitude\r\n    Which soon shall fill these deserts. From the ground\r\n    Comes up the laugh of children, the soft voice\r\n    Of maidens, and the sweet and solemn hymn\r\n    Of Sabbath worshippers. The low of herds\r\n    Blends with the rustling of the heavy grain\r\n    Over the dark brown furrows.\"\r\n\r\nThe French explorers are a reminiscence of a century and a half ago;\r\nthe lords of the lakes and forests, with all their wild energy, are\r\ngone for ever; the Astorians are no more; no longer do the French\r\nCanadian voyageurs make the rivers vocal with their chansons; the pomp\r\nand circumstance of the emperor of the fur-traders has been resolved\r\ninto the ordinary forms of commercial life; and the rude barter of the\r\nearly trader has passed into the fulfilment of the poet's dream, of\r\nthe \"argosies of magic sails,\" and the \"costly bales\" of an increasing\r\ncommerce. The Hudson's Bay Company still lives and takes its new place\r\nas one of the potent forces of the Canadian West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES AND REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Chapters I.-VI.)\r\n\r\nVoyages among the North American Indians, 1652-84 (Prince Society).\r\n\r\nHistoire de l'Amérique Septentrionale, 1772, by M.

The boundary line that has since been a subject of\r\nmuch dispute with the United States, which bought out the rights of\r\nRussia, was thus laid down in the Treaty:--\r\n\r\nIII. \"The line of demarcation between the possessions of the high\r\ncontracting parties, upon the coast of the Continent and the\r\nislands of America to the north-west, shall be drawn in the manner\r\nfollowing:--Commencing from the southernmost point of the island called\r\nPrince of Wales's Island, which point lies in the parallel of 54 degrees\r\n40 minutes, north latitude, and between the 131st and 133rd degree of\r\nwest longitude (meridian of Greenwich); the said line shall ascend to\r\nthe north along the channel called Portland Channel, as far as the point\r\nof the Continent where it strikes the 56th degree of north latitude;\r\nfrom this last-mentioned point the line of demarcation shall follow the\r\nsummits of the mountains situated parallel to the coast, as far as the\r\npoint of intersection of the 141st degree of west longitude (of the\r\nsame meridian); and finally, from the said point of intersection, the\r\nsaid meridian line of the 141st degree in its prolongation as far as\r\nthe Frozen Ocean, shall form the limit between the Russian and British\r\npossessions on the Continent of America to the north-west.\r\n\r\nIV. \"With reference to the line of demarcation laid down in the\r\npreceding article, it is understood:--\r\n\r\n1st. \"That the island called Prince of Wales's Island shall belong\r\nwholly to Russia.\r\n\r\n2nd. \"That wherever the summit of the mountains which extend in a\r\ndirection parallel to the coast, from the 56th degree of north latitude\r\nto the point of intersection of the 141st degree of west longitude,\r\nshall prove to be at the distance of more than ten marine leagues from\r\nthe ocean, the limit between the British possessions and the line of\r\ncoast which is to belong to Russia, as above mentioned, shall be formed\r\nby a line parallel to the windings of the coast, and which shall never\r\nexceed the distance of ten marine leagues therefrom.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hudson's Bay Company, in the year following the Treaty, pushed their\r\nposts to the interior, and obtained a hold on the Indians from the coast\r\ninward. Making use of their privilege of ascending the river from the\r\ncoast, they undertook to erect a post upon one of these rivers. This led\r\nthe Russian American Fur Company to make a vigorous protest, and a long\r\ncorrespondence ensued on the matter. At length, in 1839, the Hudson's\r\nBay Company, chiefly in order to gain access to their Indians of the\r\ninterior, leased the strip of coast territory from Fort Simpson to Cross\r\nSound for a period of ten years. The following is an extract from the\r\nagreement made February 6th, 1839, between the Hudson's Bay and Russian\r\nAmerican Fur Companies:--\r\n\r\n\"The Russian Fur Company cede to the Hudson's Bay Company for a period\r\nof ten years, commencing June 1st, 1840, the coast (exclusive of the\r\nislands) and the interior country situated between Cape Spencer and\r\nlatitude 54° 40´ or thereabouts for an annual rental of two thousand\r\nseasoned otters.\r\n\r\n\"The Hudson's Bay Company agree to sell to the Russian Fur Company\r\n2,000 otters taken on the west side of the mountains at the price of\r\n23_s._ sterling per skin, and 3,000 seasoned otters taken on the east\r\nside of the Rocky Mountains at 32_s._ sterling per skin. The Hudson's\r\nBay Company agree to sell to the Russian Fur Company 2,000 ferragoes\r\n(120 lbs. each) of wheat annually for a term of ten years, at the price\r\nof 10_s._ 9_d._ sterling per ferrago, also flour, peas, barley, salted\r\nbeef, butter, and pork hams at fixed prices, under certain provisions.\r\n\r\n\"The Hudson's Bay Company relinquish the claim preferred by them for\r\ndamages sustained by them, arising from the obstruction presented by\r\nthe Russian authorities to an expedition fitted out by the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany for entering the Stikine River.\"\r\n\r\nThe agreement was continued after the expiration of ten years, but\r\nthe rental fine changed from a supply of otters to a money payment of\r\n1,500_l._ a year. The Hudson's Bay Company, as we have seen, pushed\r\ntheir posts down the Yukon River, and only withdrew them after Alaska,\r\nin 1867, passed into the possession of the United States. An officer of\r\nthe Hudson's Bay Company, James McDougall, at present a chief factor of\r\nthe Company, was the last in command of the Company posts in Alaska, and\r\nperformed the duty of withdrawing them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX F.\r\n\r\nTHE CREE SYLLABIC CHARACTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.
