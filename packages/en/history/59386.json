WALLACE\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving read the proofs of Mr. Westermarck’s book I am asked by the\r\npublishers to say a few words by way of introducing the work to\r\nEnglish readers. This I have great pleasure in doing, because I have\r\nseldom read a more thorough or a more philosophic discussion of some\r\nof the most difficult, and at the same time interesting problems of\r\nanthropology.\r\n\r\nThe origin and development of human marriage have been discussed by\r\nsuch eminent writers as Darwin, Spencer, Morgan, Lubbock, and many\r\nothers. On some of the more important questions involved in it all\r\nthese writers are in general accord, and this agreement has led to\r\ntheir opinions being widely accepted as if they were well-established\r\nconclusions of science. But on several of these points Mr. Westermarck\r\nhas arrived at different, and sometimes diametrically opposite,\r\nconclusions, and he has done so after a most complete and painstaking\r\ninvestigation of all the available facts.\r\n\r\nWith such an array of authority on the one side and a hitherto unknown\r\nstudent on the other, it will certainly be thought that all the\r\nprobabilities are against the latter. Yet I venture to anticipate that\r\nthe verdict of independent thinkers will, on most of these disputed\r\npoints, be in favour of the new comer who has so boldly challenged\r\nthe conclusions of some of our most esteemed writers. Even those whose\r\nviews are here opposed, will, I think, acknowledge that Mr. Westermarck\r\nis a careful investigator and an acute reasoner, and that his arguments\r\nas well as his conclusions are worthy of the most careful consideration.\r\n\r\nI would also call attention to his ingenious and philosophical\r\nexplanation of the repugnance to marriage between near relatives which\r\nis so very general both among savage and civilised man, and as to the\r\ncauses of which there has been great diversity of opinion; and to his\r\nvaluable suggestions on the general question of sexual selection, in\r\nwhich he furnishes an original argument against Darwin’s views on the\r\npoint, differing somewhat from my own though in general harmony with it.\r\n\r\nEvery reader of the work will admire its clearness of style, and the\r\nwonderful command of what is to the author a foreign language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nI need scarcely say how fully I appreciate the honour of being\r\nintroduced to English readers by Mr. Alfred R. Wallace. I am also\r\ngreatly obliged for his kindness in reading the proofs, and in giving\r\nme the benefit of his advice with regard to various parts of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for me to acknowledge sufficiently my obligations\r\nto Mr. James Sime for his assistance in preparing this book for the\r\npress. The work, as originally written, naturally contained a good many\r\nforeign modes of expression. Mr. Sime has been indefatigable in helping\r\nme to improve the form of the text; and, in our discussions on the main\r\nlines of the argument, he has made several important suggestions. I am\r\nsincerely obliged for the invaluable aid he has given me.\r\n\r\nMy cordial thanks are due to Mr. Charles J. Cooke, British Vice-Consul\r\nat Helsingfors, who most kindly aided me in writing the first part of\r\nthe book in a tongue which is not my own. I am indebted also to Dr.\r\nE. B. Tylor, Professor G. Croom Robertson, Mr. James Sully, and Dr. W.\r\nC. Coupland for much encouraging interest; to Mr. Joseph Jacobs for\r\nthe readiness with which he has placed at my disposal some results of\r\nhis own researches; and to several gentlemen in different parts of the\r\nworld who have been so good as to respond to my inquiries as to their\r\npersonal observation of various classes of phenomena connected with\r\nmarriage among savage tribes. The information I have received from them\r\nis acknowledged in the passages in which it is used.\r\n\r\nA list of authorities is given at the end of the book—between the text\r\nand the index, and it may be well to add that the references in the\r\nnotes have been carefully verified.\r\n\r\n  E. W.\r\n\r\n LONDON, _May, 1891_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this new edition of my book I have made no essential changes, but\r\nhere and there the argument has been strengthened by the addition of\r\nfacts which have come to my knowledge since the appearance of the first\r\nedition. The most important of these new facts will be found in the\r\nsecond chapter.\r\n\r\nI take this opportunity of expressing my warm appreciation of the\r\nthorough way in which the ideas set forth in this book have been\r\ndiscussed by many critics in England and elsewhere. Translations of the\r\nwork have appeared, or are about to appear, in German, Swedish, French,\r\nItalian, and Russian.\r\n\r\n  E. W.\r\n\r\n LONDON, _January, 1894_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nI much regret that the demand for a new edition of this book should\r\ncome at a time when circumstances prevent me from undertaking such a\r\nrevision of the work as I feel to be required. Since the appearance\r\nof the Second Edition many important facts bearing upon the subject\r\nhave been brought to light, new theories have been advanced, and old\r\ntheories, supported by fresh arguments, have been revived. To all this,\r\nhowever, I can do no justice, as I am at present being engaged in\r\nanthropological research in Morocco. This edition is, in consequence, a\r\nmere reprint of the second. But I purpose, after my return to Europe,\r\nto issue an Appendix, in which the book will be brought more up to date\r\nand some criticism will be replied to.\r\n\r\n  E.

history of human civilization\r\nshould be made an object of as scientific a treatment as the history of\r\norganic nature that I write this book. Like the phenomena of physical\r\nand psychical life those of social life should be classified into\r\ncertain groups, and each group investigated with regard to its origin\r\nand development. Only when treated in this way can history lay claim to\r\nthe rank and honour of a science in the highest sense of the term, as\r\nforming an important part of Sociology the youngest of the principal\r\nbranches of learning.\r\n\r\nDescriptive historiography has no higher object than that of offering\r\nmaterials to this science. It can, however, but very inadequately\r\nfulfil this task. The written evidences of history do not reach far\r\ninto antiquity. They give us information about times when the scale\r\nof civilization was already comparatively high—but scarcely anything\r\nmore. As to the origin and early development of social institutions,\r\nthey leave us entirely in the dark. The sociologist cannot rest content\r\nwith this. But the information which historical documents are unable to\r\nafford him, may be, to a great extent, obtained from ethnography.\r\n\r\nThe admirable works of Dr. Tylor, Sir John Lubbock, and Mr. Herbert\r\nSpencer have already made us familiar with the idea of a history of\r\nprimitive civilization, based on ethnographical grounds. This new\r\nmanner of treating history has, since the publication of their writings\r\non the subject, gained adherents day by day. Immeasurable expanses have\r\nthus been opened to our knowledge, and many important results have\r\nbeen reached. But it must, on the other hand, be admitted that the\r\nscientific value of the conclusions drawn from ethnographical facts has\r\nnot always been adequate to the labour, thought, and acumen bestowed\r\non them. The various investigators have, in many important questions,\r\ncome to results so widely different, that the possibility of thus\r\ngetting any information about the past might easily be doubted. These\r\ndifferences, however, seem to me to be due, not to the material, but to\r\nthe manner of treating it.\r\n\r\n“The chief sources of information regarding the early history of civil\r\nsociety,” says Mr. McLennan, “are, first, the study of races in their\r\nprimitive condition; and, second, the study of the symbols employed by\r\nadvanced nations in the constitution or exercise of civil rights.”[1]\r\n\r\nYet nothing has been more fatal to the Science of Society than the\r\nhabit of inferring, without sufficient reasons, from the prevalence of\r\na custom or institution among some savage peoples, that this custom,\r\nthis institution is a relic of a stage of development that the whole\r\nhuman race once went through. Thus the assumption that primitive\r\nmen lived in tribes or hordes, all the men of which had promiscuous\r\nintercourse with all the women, where no individual marriage existed,\r\nand the children were the common property of the tribe, is founded,\r\nin the first place, on the statements of some travellers and ancient\r\nwriters as to peoples among whom this custom is said actually to\r\nprevail, or to have prevailed. Dr. Post has gone still further in his\r\nbook, ‘Die Geschlechtsgenossenschaft der Urzeit und die Entstehung\r\nder Ehe.’ Without adducing any satisfactory reason for his opinion, he\r\nconsiders it probable that “monogamous marriage originally emerged\r\neverywhere from pure communism in women, through the intermediate\r\nstages of limited communism in women, polyandry, and polygyny.”[2] Mr.\r\nLewis H. Morgan, in his ‘Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the\r\nHuman Family,’ has suggested no fewer than fifteen normal stages in\r\nthe evolution of marriage and the family, assuming the existence and\r\ngeneral prevalence of a series of customs and institutions “which\r\nmust of necessity have preceded a knowledge of marriage between single\r\npairs, and of the family itself, in the modern sense of the term.”[3]\r\nAccording to him, one of the first stages in this series is the\r\nintermarriage of brothers and sisters, as evidence of which he adduces,\r\nbesides other facts, the historical statements that one of the Herods\r\nwas married to his sister, and Cleopatra was married to her brother.[4]\r\n\r\nAgain, in the study of symbols, or survivals, the sociologists have by\r\nno means always been so careful as the matter requires. True enough\r\nthat “wherever we discover symbolical forms, we are justified in\r\ninferring that in the past life of the people employing them, there\r\nwere corresponding realities.”[5] But all depends upon our rightly\r\ninterpreting these symbols, and not putting into them a foreign\r\nmeaning. The worst is, however, that many customs have been looked upon\r\nas survivals that probably are not so. Thus, for instance, I think that\r\nMr. McLennan is mistaken in considering the system of the Levirate,\r\nunder which, at a man’s death, his wife or wives pass to his brother,\r\nas a test of the former presence of polyandry, the brothers of a family\r\nhaving a common wife.\r\n\r\nSimilar conclusions being of common occurrence in modern Sociology, it\r\nis not surprising that different writers dissent so frequently from\r\neach other. This should be a strong reason for every conscientious\r\ninvestigator first of all putting to himself the question: how can\r\nwe from ethnographical facts acquire information regarding the early\r\nhistory of mankind?\r\n\r\nI do not think that this question can be correctly answered in more\r\nthan one way. We have first to find out the causes of the social\r\nphenomena; then, from the prevalence of the causes, we may infer the\r\nprevalence of the phenomena themselves, if the former must be assumed\r\nto have operated without being checked by other causes.\r\n\r\nIf, then, historical researches based on ethnography are to be\r\ncrowned with success, the first condition is that there shall be a\r\nrich material. It is only by comparing a large number of facts that\r\nwe may hope to find the cause or causes on which a social phenomenon\r\nis dependent. And a rich material is all the more indispensable, as\r\nthe trustworthiness of ethnographical statements is not always beyond\r\ndispute. Without a thorough knowledge of a people it is impossible\r\nto give an exact account of its habits and customs, and therefore\r\nit often happens that the statements of a traveller cannot, as\r\nregards trustworthiness, come up to the evidences of history. As the\r\nsociologist is in many cases unable to distinguish falsehood from\r\ntruth, he must be prepared to admit the inaccuracy of some of the\r\nstatements he quotes. What is wanting in quality must be made up for\r\nin quantity; and he who does not give himself the trouble to read\r\nthrough a voluminous literature of ethnography should never enter into\r\nspeculations on the origin and early development of human civilization.\r\n\r\nOften, no doubt, it is extremely difficult to make out the causes\r\nof social phenomena. There are, for instance, among savage peoples\r\nmany customs which it seems almost impossible to explain. Still, the\r\nstatistical ‘method of investigating the development of institutions,’\r\nadmirably set forth in the paper which Dr. Tylor recently read before\r\n‘The Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland,’[6] will\r\nthrow light upon many mysterious points. Dr. Tylor has there shown\r\nthat causal relations among social facts may be discovered by way of\r\ntabulation and classification. The particular rules of the different\r\npeoples are to be scheduled out into tables, so as to indicate the\r\n“adhesions,” or relations of coexistence of each custom, showing\r\nwhich peoples have the same custom, and what other customs accompany\r\nit or lie apart from it. If, then, starting with any two customs,\r\nthe number of their “adhesions” is found to be much greater than the\r\nnumber of times they would coexist according to the ordinary law of\r\nchance-distribution—which number is calculated from the total number\r\nof peoples classified and the number of occurrences of each custom—we\r\nmay infer that there is some causal connection between the two customs.\r\nFurther on, I shall mention some few of the inferences Dr. Tylor has\r\nalready drawn by means of this method.\r\n\r\nThe causes on which social phenomena are dependent fall within the\r\ndomain of different sciences—Biology, Psychology, or Sociology. The\r\nreader will find that I put particular stress upon the psychological\r\ncauses, which have often been deplorably overlooked, or only\r\nimperfectly touched upon. And more especially do I believe that the\r\nmere instincts have played a very important part in the origin of\r\nsocial institutions and rules.\r\n\r\nWe could not, however, by following the method of investigation here\r\nset forth, form any idea of the earlier stages of human development,\r\nunless we had _some_ previous knowledge of the antiquity of mankind.\r\nOtherwise we should, of course, be quite ignorant whether the causes\r\nin question operated or not in the past. Fortunately, in this respect\r\nalso, modern science has come to results which scarcely admit any\r\nlonger of being considered as mere hypotheses. It teaches us, to\r\nquote Sir John Lubbock, “that man was at first a mere savage, and\r\nthat the course of history has on the whole been a progress towards\r\ncivilization, though at times—and at some times for centuries—some\r\nraces have been stationary, or even have retrograded;”[7] that,\r\nhowever, all savage nations now existing are raised high above\r\nprimitive men; and that the first beings worthy to be called men,\r\nwere probably the gradually transformed descendants of some ape-like\r\nancestor. We may, further, take for granted that all the physical and\r\npsychical qualities that man, in his present state, has in common with\r\nhis nearest relatives among the lower animals, also occurred at the\r\nearlier stages of human civilization. These conclusions open to us a\r\nrich source of new knowledge.\r\n\r\nFinally, as to social survivals, I agree, certainly, with Mr. McLennan\r\nthat they are of great importance to Sociology. But we must be\r\nextremely careful not to regard as rudiments customs which may be more\r\nsatisfactorily explained otherwise.\r\n\r\nIt is only by strictly keeping to these principles that we may hope\r\nto derive information touching the early history of man. In doing so,\r\nthe student will be on his guard against rash conclusions. Considering\r\nthat he has to make out the primary sources of social phenomena before\r\nwriting their history, he will avoid assuming a custom to be primitive,\r\nonly because, at the first glance, it appears so; he will avoid making\r\nrules of exceptions, and constructing the history of human development\r\non the immediate ground of isolated facts. It is true that the critical\r\nsociologist, on account of the deficiency of our knowledge, very often\r\nhas to be content with hypotheses and doubtful presumptions. At any\r\nrate, the interests of science are better looked to, if we readily\r\nacknowledge our ignorance, than if we pass off vague guesses as\r\nestablished truths.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is one of the simplest of all social institutions the history of\r\nwhich forms the subject of this book. Indeed, next to the family\r\nconsisting of mother and offspring only, marriage is probably _the_\r\nsimplest. I shall not, however, treat this subject in all its aspects,\r\nbut confine myself to human marriage, though before dealing with it I\r\nmust, of course, touch upon the sexual relations of the lower animals\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nThe expression “human marriage” will probably be regarded by most\r\npeople as an improper tautology. But, as we shall see, marriage, in\r\nthe natural history sense of the term, does not belong exclusively\r\nto our own species. No more fundamental difference between man and\r\nother animals should be implied in sociological than in biological and\r\npsychological terminology. Arbitrary classifications do science much\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nI shall examine human marriage from its different sides, giving, in\r\naccordance with my method, an historical account of each separately.\r\nThe reader may find much that will outrage his feelings, and, possibly,\r\nhurt his sense of modesty; but the concealment of truth is the only\r\nindecorum known to science. To keep anything secret within its cold and\r\npassionless expanses, would be the same as to throw a cloth round a\r\nnaked statue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF MARRIAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom remote antiquity we are told of kings and rulers who instituted\r\nmarriage amongst their subjects. We read in ‘Mahâbhârata,’ the Indian\r\npoem, that formerly “women were unconfined, and roved about at their\r\npleasure, independent. Though in their youthful innocence, they went\r\nastray from their husbands, they were guilty of no offence; for such\r\nwas the rule in early times.” But Swêtakêtu, son of the Rishi Uddâlaka,\r\ncould not bear this custom, and established the rule that thenceforward\r\nwives should remain faithful to their husbands and husbands to their\r\nwives.[8] The Chinese annals recount that, “in the beginning, men\r\ndiffered in nothing from other animals in their way of life. As\r\nthey wandered up and down in the woods, and women were in common,\r\nit happened that children never knew their fathers, but only their\r\nmothers.” The Emperor Fou-hi abolished, however, this indiscriminate\r\nintercourse of the sexes and instituted marriage.[9] Again, the ancient\r\nEgyptians are stated to be indebted to Menes for this institution,[10]\r\nand the Greeks to Kekrops. Originally, it is said, they had no idea\r\nof conjugal union; they gratified their desires promiscuously, and\r\nthe children that sprang from these irregular connections always bore\r\nthe mother’s name. But Kekrops showed the Athenians the inconvenience\r\nto society from such an abuse, and established the laws and rules\r\nof marriage.[11] The remote Laplanders, also, sing about Njavvis and\r\nAttjis, who instituted marriage, and bound their wives by sacred\r\noaths.[12]\r\n\r\nPopular imagination prefers the clear and concrete; it does not\r\nrecognize any abstract laws that rule the universe. Nothing exists\r\nwithout a cause, but this cause is not sought in an agglomeration of\r\nexternal or internal forces; it is taken to be simple and palpable,\r\na personal being, a god or a king. Is it not natural, then, that\r\nmarriage, which plays such an important part in the life of the\r\nindividual, as well as in that of the people, should be ascribed to a\r\nwise and powerful ruler, or to direct divine intervention?\r\n\r\nWith notions of this kind science has nothing to do. If we want to\r\nfind out the origin of marriage, we have to strike into another path,\r\nthe only one which can lead to the truth, but a path which is open\r\nto him alone who regards organic nature as one continued chain, the\r\nlast and most perfect link of which is man. For we can no more stop\r\nwithin the limits of our own species, when trying to find the root of\r\nour psychical and social life, than we can understand the physical\r\ncondition of the human race without taking into consideration that of\r\nthe lower animals. I must, therefore, beg the reader to follow me into\r\na domain which many may consider out of the way, but which we must, of\r\nnecessity, explore in order to discover what we seek.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the preservation of the progeny of the lowest\r\nanimals depends mainly upon chance. In the great sub-kingdom of the\r\nInvertebrata, even the mothers are exempted from nearly all anxiety as\r\nregards their offspring. In the highest order, the Insects, the eggs\r\nare hatched by the heat of the sun, and the mother, in most cases,\r\ndoes not even see her young. Her care is generally limited to seeking\r\nout an appropriate place for laying the eggs, and to fastening them to\r\nsome proper object and covering them, if this be necessary for their\r\npreservation. Again, to the male’s share nothing falls but the function\r\nof propagation.[13]\r\n\r\nIn the lowest classes of the Vertebrata, parental care is likewise\r\nalmost unheard of. In the immense majority of species, young fishes are\r\nhatched without the assistance of their parents, and have, from the\r\noutset, to help themselves. Many Teleostei form, however, an exception;\r\nand, curiously enough, it is the male on which, in these cases, the\r\nparental duty generally devolves. In some instances he constructs a\r\nnest, and jealously guards the ova deposited in it by the female; while\r\nthe male of certain species of Arius carries the ova about with him in\r\nhis capacious pharynx.[14] Most of the Reptiles place their eggs in a\r\nconvenient and sunny spot between moss and leaves, and take no further\r\ntrouble about them. But several of the larger serpents have a curious\r\nfashion of laying them in a heap, and then coiling themselves around\r\nthem in a great hollow cone.[15] And female Crocodiles, as also certain\r\naquatic snakes of Cochin China, observed by Dr. Morice, carry with them\r\neven their young.[16]\r\n\r\nAmong the lower Vertebrata it rarely happens that both parents jointly\r\ntake care of their progeny. M. Milne Edwards states, indeed, that in\r\nthe Pipa, or Toad of Surinam, the male helps the female to disburthen\r\nherself of her eggs;[17] and the Chelonia are known to live in pairs.\r\n“La femelle,” says M. Espinas, “vient sur les plages sablonneuses au\r\nmoment de la ponte, accompagnée du mâle, et construit un nid en forme\r\nde four où la chaleur du soleil fait éclore les œufs.”[18] But it may\r\nbe regarded as an almost universal rule that the relations of the sexes\r\nare utterly fickle. The male and female come together in the paring\r\ntime; but having satisfied their sexual instincts they part again, and\r\nhave nothing more to do with one another.\r\n\r\nThe Chelonia form, with regard to their domestic habits, a transition\r\nto the Birds, as they do also from a zoological and, particularly,\r\nfrom an embryological point of view. In the latter class, parental\r\naffection has reached a very high degree of development, not only on\r\nthe mother’s side, but also on the father’s. Male and female help each\r\nother to build the nest, the former generally bringing the materials,\r\nthe latter doing the work. In fulfilling the numberless duties of the\r\nbreeding season, both birds take a share. Incubation rests principally\r\nwith the mother, but the father, as a rule, helps his companion, taking\r\nher place when she wants to leave the nest for a moment, or providing\r\nher with food and protecting her from every danger. Finally, when the\r\nduties of the breeding season are over, and the result desired is\r\nobtained, a period with new duties commences. During the first few\r\ndays after hatching, most birds rarely leave their young for long, and\r\nthen only to procure food for themselves and their family. In cases\r\nof great danger, both parents bravely defend their offspring. As soon\r\nas the first period of helplessness is over, and the young have grown\r\nsomewhat, they are carefully taught to shift for themselves; and it is\r\nonly when they are perfectly capable of so doing that they leave the\r\nnest and the parents.\r\n\r\nThere are, indeed, a few birds that from the first day of their\r\nultra-oval existence lack all parental care; and in some species, as\r\nthe ducks, it frequently happens that the male leaves family duties\r\nwholly to the female. But, as a general rule, both share prosperity and\r\nadversity. The hatching of the eggs and the chief part of the rearing\r\nduties belong to the mother,[19] whilst the father acts as protector,\r\nand provides food, &c.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the sexes are thus of a very intimate character,\r\nmale and female keeping together not only during the breeding season,\r\nbut also after it. Nay, most birds, with the exception of those\r\nbelonging to the Gallinaceous family, when pairing, do so once for all\r\ntill either one or the other dies. And Dr. Brehm is so filled with\r\nadmiration for their exemplary family life, that he enthusiastically\r\ndeclares that “real genuine marriage can only be found among\r\nbirds.”[20]\r\n\r\nThis certainly cannot be said of most of the Mammals. The mother\r\nis, indeed, very ardently concerned for the welfare of her young,\r\ngenerally nursing them with the utmost affection, but this is by no\r\nmeans the case with the father. There are cases in which he acts as\r\nan enemy of his own progeny. But there are not wanting instances to\r\nthe contrary, the connections between the sexes, though generally\r\nrestricted to the time of the rut, being, with several species of a\r\nmore durable character. This is the case with whales,[21] seals,[22]\r\nthe hippopotamus,[23] the _Cervus campestris_,[24] gazelles,[25] the\r\n_Neotragus Hemprichii_ and other small antelopes,[26] reindeer,[27] the\r\n_Hydromus coypus_,[28] squirrels,[29] moles,[30] the ichneumon,[31] and\r\nsome carnivorous animals, as a few cats and martens,[32] the yaguarundi\r\nin South America,[33] the _Canis Brasiliensis_,[34] and possibly also\r\nthe wolf.[35] Among all these animals the sexes remain together even\r\nafter the birth of the young, the male being the protector of the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nWhat among lower Mammals is an exception, is among the Quadrumana a\r\nrule. The natives of Madagascar relate that in some species of the\r\nProsimii, male and female nurse their young in common[36]—a statement,\r\nhowever, which has not yet been proved to be true. The mirikina\r\n(_Nyctipithecus trivirgatus_) seems, according to Rengger, to live in\r\npairs throughout the whole year, for, whatever the season, a male and a\r\nfemale are always found together.[37] Of the _Mycetes Caraya_, _Cebus\r\nAzarae_,[38] and _Ateles paniscus_,[39] single individuals are very\r\nseldom, or never, seen, whole families being generally met with. Among\r\nthe Arctopitheci,[40] the male parent is expressly said to assist the\r\nfemale in taking care of the young ones.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting to us are, of course, the man-like apes. Diard\r\nwas told by the Malays, and he found it afterwards to be true, that\r\nthe young Siamangs, when in their helpless state, are carried about by\r\ntheir parents, the males by the father, the females by the mother.[41]\r\nLieutenant C. de Crespigny, who was wandering in the northern part of\r\nBorneo in 1870, gives the following description of the Orang-utan:\r\n“They live in families—the male, female, and a young one. On one\r\noccasion I found a family in which were two young ones, one of them\r\nmuch larger than the other, and I took this as a proof that the family\r\ntie had existed for at least two seasons. They build commodious\r\nnests in the trees which form their feeding-ground, and, so far as I\r\ncould observe, the nests, which are well lined with dry leaves, are\r\nonly occupied by the female and young, the male passing the night in\r\nthe fork of the same or another tree in the vicinity. The nests are\r\nvery numerous all over the forests, for they are not occupied above\r\na few nights, the mias (or Orang-utan) leading a roving life.”[42]\r\nAccording to Dr. Mohnike, however, the old males generally live with\r\nthe females during the rutting season only;[43] and Mr. Wallace never\r\nsaw two full-grown animals together. But as he sometimes found not only\r\nfemales, but also males, accompanied by half-grown young ones,[44]\r\nwe may take for granted that the offspring of the Orang-utan are not\r\ndevoid of all paternal care.\r\n\r\nMore unanimous are the statements which we have regarding the Gorilla.\r\nAccording to Dr. Savage, they live in bands, and all his informants\r\nagree in the assertion that but one adult male is seen in every band.\r\n“It is said that when the male is first seen he gives a terrific yell\r\nthat resounds far and wide through the forest.... The females and young\r\nat the first cry quickly disappear; he then approaches the enemy in\r\ngreat fury, pouring out his horrid cries in quick succession.”[45]\r\nAgain, Mr. Du Chaillu found “almost always one male with one female,\r\nthough sometimes the old male wanders companionless;”[46] and Mr.\r\nWinwood Reade states likewise that the Gorilla goes “sometimes alone,\r\nsometimes accompanied by his female and young one.”[47] The same\r\ntraveller was told that, when a family of Gorillas ascend a tree and\r\neat a certain fruit, the old father remains seated at the foot of the\r\ntree. And when the female is pregnant, he builds a rude nest, usually\r\nabout fifteen or twenty feet from the ground; here she is delivered,\r\nand the nest is then abandoned.[48]\r\n\r\nFor more recent information about the Gorilla we are indebted to Herr\r\nvon Koppenfells. He states that the male spends the night crouching\r\nat the foot of the tree, against which he places his back, and thus\r\nprotects the female and their young, which are in the nest above, from\r\nthe nocturnal attacks of leopards. Once he observed a male and female\r\nwith two young ones of different ages, the elder being perhaps about\r\nsix years old, the younger about one.[49]\r\n\r\nWhen all these statements are compared, it is impossible to doubt that\r\nthe Gorilla lives in families, the male parent being in the habit of\r\nbuilding the nest and protecting the family. And the same is the case\r\nwith the Chimpanzee. According to Dr. Savage, “it is not unusual to\r\nsee ‘the old folks’ sitting under a tree regaling themselves with\r\nfruit and friendly chat, while ‘their children’ are leaping around\r\nthem and swinging from branch to branch in boisterous merriment.”[50]\r\nAnd Herr von Koppenfells assures us that the Chimpanzee, like the\r\nGorilla, builds a nest for the young and female on a forked branch, the\r\nmale himself spending the night lower down in the tree.[51]\r\n\r\nPassing from the highest monkeys to the savage and barbarous races\r\nof man, we meet with the same phenomenon. With the exception of a\r\nfew cases in which certain tribes are asserted to live together\r\npromiscuously—almost all of which assertions I shall prove further on\r\nto be groundless—travellers unanimously agree that in the human race\r\nthe relations of the sexes are, as a rule, of a more or less durable\r\ncharacter. The family consisting of father, mother, and offspring, is\r\na universal institution, whether founded on a monogamous, polygynous,\r\nor polyandrous marriage. And, as among the lower animals having the\r\nsame habit, it is to the mother that the immediate care of the children\r\nchiefly belongs, while the father is the protector and guardian of the\r\nfamily. Man in the savage state is generally supposed to be rather\r\nindifferent to the welfare of his wife and children, and this is really\r\noften the case, especially if he be compared with civilized man. But\r\nthe simplest paternal duties are, nevertheless, universally recognized.\r\nIf he does nothing else, the father builds the habitation, and employs\r\nhimself in the chase and in war.\r\n\r\nThus, among the North American Indians, it was considered disgraceful\r\nfor a man to have more wives than he was able to maintain.[52] Mr.\r\nPowers says that among the Patwin, a Californian tribe which ranks\r\namong the lowest in the world, “the sentiment that the men are bound\r\nto support the women—that is to furnish the supplies—is stronger even\r\nthan among us.”[53] Among the Iroquois it was the office of the husband\r\n“to make a mat, to repair the cabin of his wife, or to construct a new\r\none.” The product of his hunting expeditions, during the first year of\r\nmarriage, belonged of right to his wife, and afterwards he shared it\r\nequally with her, whether she remained in the village, or accompanied\r\nhim to the chase.[54] Azara states that among the Charruas of South\r\nAmerica, “du moment où un homme se marie, il forme une famille à part\r\net travaille pour la nourrir;”[55] and among the Fuegians, according\r\nto Admiral Fitzroy, “as soon as a youth is able to maintain a wife,\r\nby his exertions in fishing or bird-catching, he obtains the consent\r\nof her relations.”[56] Again, among the utterly rude Botocudos, whose\r\ngirls are married very young, remaining in the house of the father till\r\nthe age of puberty, the husband is even then obliged to maintain his\r\nwife, though living apart from her.[57]\r\n\r\nTo judge from the recent account of Herr Lumholtz, the paternal duties\r\nseemed to be scarcely recognized by the natives of Queensland.[58] But\r\nwith reference to the Kurnai in South Australia, Mr. Howitt states\r\nthat “the man has to provide for his family with the assistance of\r\nhis wife. His share is to hunt for their support, and to fight for\r\ntheir protection.” As a Kurnai once said to him, “A man hunts, spears\r\nfish, fights, and sits about.”[59] And in the Encounter Bay tribe the\r\npaternal care is considered so indispensable, that, if the father dies\r\nbefore a child is born, the child is put to death by the mother, as\r\nthere is no longer any one to provide for it.[60]\r\n\r\nAmong the cannibals of New Britain, the chiefs have to see that the\r\nfamilies of the warriors are properly maintained.[61] As regards the\r\nTonga Islanders, Martin remarks, “A married woman is one who cohabits\r\nwith a man, and lives under his roof and protection;”[62] and in\r\nSamoa, according to Mr. Pritchard, “whatever intercourse may take\r\nplace between the sexes, a woman does not become a man’s wife unless\r\nthe latter take her to his own house.”[63] Among the Maoris, says Mr.\r\nJohnston, “the mission of woman was to increase and multiply; that\r\nof man to defend his home.”[64] In Radack, even natural children are\r\nreceived by the father into his house, as soon as they are able to\r\nwalk.[65]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. D. Macdonald states that, in some African tribes, “a father\r\nhas to fast after the birth of his child, or take some such method of\r\nshowing that he recognizes that he as well as the mother should take\r\ncare of the young stranger.”[66] Certain Africans will not even go on\r\nany warlike expedition when they have a young child;[67] and the South\r\nAmerican Guaranies, while their wives are pregnant do not risk their\r\nlives in hunting wild beasts.[68] In Lado the bridegroom has to assure\r\nhis father-in-law three times that he will protect his wife, calling\r\nthe people present to witness.[69] And among the Touaregs, according\r\nto Dr. Chavanne, a man who deserts his wife is blamed, as he has taken\r\nupon himself the obligation of maintaining her.[70]\r\n\r\nThe wretched Rock Veddahs in Ceylon, according to Sir J. Emerson\r\nTennent, “acknowledge the marital obligation and the duty of\r\nsupporting their own families.”[71] Among the Maldivians, “although\r\na man is allowed four wives at one time, it is only on condition of\r\nhis being able to support them.”[72] The Nagas are not permitted to\r\nmarry until they are able to set up house on their own account.[73] The\r\nNairs, we are told, consider it a husband’s duty to provide his wife\r\nwith food, clothing, and ornaments;[74] and almost the same is said\r\nby Dr. Schwaner with reference to the tribes of the Barito district,\r\nin the south-east part of Borneo.[75] A Burmese woman can demand a\r\ndivorce, if her husband is not able to maintain her properly.[76]\r\nAmong the Mohammedans, the maintenance of the children devolves so\r\nexclusively on the father, that the mother is even entitled to claim\r\nwages for nursing them.[77] And among the Romans, _manus_ implied not\r\nonly the wife’s subordination to the husband, but also the husband’s\r\nobligation to protect the wife.[78]\r\n\r\nThe father’s place in the family being that of a supporter and\r\nprotector, a man is often not permitted to marry until he has given\r\nsome proof of his ability to fulfil these duties.\r\n\r\nThe Koyúkuns believe that a youth who marries before he has killed\r\na deer will have no children.[79] The aborigines of Pennsylvania\r\nconsidered it a shame for a boy to think of a wife before having given\r\nsome proof of his manhood.[80] Among the wild Indians of British\r\nGuiana, says Mr. Im Thurn, before a man is allowed to choose a wife he\r\nmust prove that he can do a man’s work and is able to support himself\r\nand his family.[81] Among the Dyaks of Borneo,[82] the Nagas of Upper\r\nAssam,[83] and the Alfura of Ceram,[84] no one can marry unless he has\r\nin his possession a certain number of heads. The Karmanians, according\r\nto Strabo, were considered marriageable only after having killed an\r\nenemy.[85] The desire of a Galla warrior is to deprive the enemy of his\r\ngenitals, the possession of such a trophy being a necessary preliminary\r\nto marriage.[86] Among the Bechuana and Kafir tribes south of the\r\nZambesi, the youth is not allowed to take a wife until he has killed\r\na rhinoceros.[87] In the Marianne Group, the suitor had to give proof\r\nof his bodily strength and skill.[88] And among the Arabs of Upper\r\nEgypt, the man must undergo an ordeal of whipping by the relations of\r\nhis bride in order to test his courage. If he wishes to be considered\r\nworth having, he must receive the chastisement, which is sometimes\r\nexceedingly severe, with an expression of enjoyment.[89]\r\n\r\nThe idea that a man is bound to maintain his family is, indeed, so\r\nclosely connected with that of marriage and fatherhood, that sometimes\r\neven repudiated wives with their children are, at least to a certain\r\nextent, supported by their former husbands. This is the case among the\r\nChukchi of North-Western Asia,[90] the Basutos in Southern Africa,[91]\r\nand the Munda Kols in Chota Nagpore.[92] Further, a wife frequently\r\nenjoys her husband’s protection even after sexual relations have been\r\nbroken off. And upon his death, the obligation of maintaining her and\r\nher children devolves on his heirs, the wide-spread custom of a man\r\nmarrying the widow of his deceased brother being, as we shall see\r\nin a subsequent chapter, not only a privilege belonging to the man,\r\nbut, among several peoples, even a duty. We may thus take for granted\r\nthat in the human race, at least at its present stage, the father has\r\nto perform the same function as in other animal species, where the\r\nconnections between the sexes last longer than the sexual desire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn encyclopedical and philosophical works we meet with several\r\ndifferent definitions of the word marriage. Most of these definitions\r\nare, however, of a merely juridical or ethical nature, comprehending\r\neither what is required to make the union legal,[93] or what, in the\r\neye of an idealist, the union ought to be.[94] But it is scarcely\r\nnecessary to say how far I am here from using the word in either of\r\nthese senses. It is the natural history of human marriage that is the\r\nobject of this treatise; and, from a scientific point of view, I think\r\nthere is but one definition which may claim to be generally admitted,\r\nthat, namely, according to which marriage is nothing else than a more\r\nor less durable connection between male and female, lasting beyond\r\nthe mere act of propagation till after the birth of the offspring.\r\nThis definition is wide enough to include all others hitherto given,\r\nand narrow enough to exclude those wholly loose connections which by\r\nusage are never honoured with the name of marriage. It implies not\r\nonly sexual relations, but also living together, as is set forth in\r\nthe proverb of the Middle Ages, “Boire, manger, coucher ensemble est\r\nmariage, ce me semble.”[95] And, though, rather vague, which is a\r\nmatter of course, it has the advantage of comprehending in one notion\r\nphenomena essentially similar and having a common origin.\r\n\r\nThus, as appears from the preceding investigation, the first traces of\r\nmarriage are found among the Chelonia. With the Birds it is an almost\r\nuniversal institution, whilst, among the Mammals, it is restricted to\r\ncertain species only. We observed, however, that it occurs, as a rule,\r\namong the monkeys, especially the anthropomorphous apes as well as in\r\nthe races of men. Is it probable, then, that marriage was transmitted\r\nto man from some ape-like ancestor, and that there never was a time\r\nwhen it did not occur in the human race? These questions cannot be\r\nanswered before we have found out the cause to which it owes its origin.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that where the generative power is restricted to a\r\ncertain season, it cannot be the sexual instinct that keeps male and\r\nfemale together for months or years. Nor is there any other egoistic\r\nmotive that could probably account for this habit. Considering that\r\nthe union lasts till after the birth of the offspring, and considering\r\nthe care taken of this by the father, we may assume that the prolonged\r\nunion of the sexes is, in some way or other connected with parental\r\nduties. I am, indeed, strongly of opinion that the tie which joins male\r\nand female is an instinct developed through the powerful influence of\r\nnatural selection. It is evident that, when the father helps to protect\r\nthe offspring, the species is better able to subsist in the struggle\r\nfor existence than it would be if this obligation entirely devolved\r\non the mother. Paternal affection and the instinct which causes male\r\nand female to form somewhat durable alliances, are thus useful mental\r\ndispositions which, in all probability, have been acquired through the\r\nsurvival of the fittest.\r\n\r\nBut how, then, can it be that among most animals the father never\r\nconcerns himself about his progeny? The answer is not difficult to\r\nfind. Marriage is only one of many means by which a species is enabled\r\nto subsist. Where parental care is lacking, we may be sure to find\r\ncompensation for it in some other way. Among the Invertebrata, Fishes,\r\nand Reptiles, both parents are generally quite indifferent as to their\r\nprogeny. An immense proportion of the progeny therefore succumb before\r\nreaching maturity; but the number of eggs laid is proportionate to the\r\nnumber of those lost, and the species is preserved nevertheless. If\r\nevery grain of roe, spawned by the female fishes, were fecundated and\r\nhatched, the sea would not be large enough to hold all the creatures\r\nresulting from them. The eggs of Reptiles need no maternal care, the\r\nembryo being developed by the heat of the sun; and their young are\r\nfrom the outset able to help themselves, leading the same life as the\r\nadults. Among Birds, on the other hand, parental care is an absolute\r\nnecessity. Equal and continual warmth is the first requirement for\r\nthe development of the embryo and the preservation of the young ones.\r\nFor this the mother almost always wants the assistance of the father,\r\nwho provides her with necessaries, and sometimes relieves her of the\r\nbrooding. Among Mammals, the young can never do without the mother\r\nat the tenderest age, but the father’s aid is generally by no means\r\nindispensable. In some species, as the walrus,[96] the elephant,[97]\r\nthe _Bos americanus_,[98] and the bat,[99] there seems to be a rather\r\ncurious substitute for paternal protection, the females, together with\r\ntheir young ones, collecting in large herds or flocks apart from the\r\nmales. Again, as to the marriage of the Primates, it is, I think, very\r\nprobably due to the small number of young, the female bringing forth\r\nbut one at a time; and, among the highest apes, as in man, also to the\r\nlong period of infancy.[100] Perhaps, too, the defective family life\r\nof the Orang-utan, compared with that of the Gorilla and Chimpanzee,\r\ndepends upon the fewer dangers to which this animal is exposed. For\r\n“except man,” Dr. Mohnike says, “the Orang-utan in Borneo has\r\nno enemy of equal strength.”[101] In short, the factors which the\r\nexistence of a species depends upon, as the number of the progeny,\r\ntheir ability to help themselves when young, maternal care, marriage,\r\n&c., vary indefinitely in different species. But in those that do not\r\nsuccumb, all these factors are more or less proportionate to each\r\nother, the product always being the maintenance of the species.\r\n\r\nMarriage and family are thus intimately connected with each other: it\r\nis for the benefit of the young that male and female continue to live\r\ntogether. Marriage is therefore rooted in family, rather than family\r\nin marriage. There are also many peoples among whom true conjugal life\r\ndoes not begin before a child is born, and others who consider that the\r\nbirth of a child out of wedlock makes it obligatory for the parents\r\nto marry. Among the Eastern Greenlanders[102] and the Fuegians,[103]\r\nmarriage is not regarded as complete till the woman has become a\r\nmother. Among the Shawanese[104] and Abipones,[105] the wife very often\r\nremains at her father’s house till she has a child. Among the Khyens,\r\nthe Ainos of Yesso, and one of the aboriginal tribes of China, the\r\nhusband goes to live with his wife at her father’s house, and never\r\ntakes her away till after the birth of a child.[106] In Circassia,\r\nthe bride and bridegroom are kept apart until the first child is\r\nborn;[107] and among the Bedouins of Mount Sinai, a wife never enters\r\nher husband’s tent until she becomes far advanced in pregnancy.[108]\r\nAmong the Baele, the wife remains with her parents until she becomes\r\na mother, and if this does not happen, she stays there for ever, the\r\nhusband getting back what he has paid for her.[109] In Siam, a wife\r\ndoes not receive her marriage portion before having given birth to a\r\nchild;[110] while among the Atkha Aleuts, according to Erman, a husband\r\ndoes not pay the purchase sum before he has become a father.[111]\r\nAgain, the Badagas in Southern India have two marriage ceremonies, the\r\nsecond of which does not take place till there is some indication that\r\nthe pair are to have a family; and if there is no appearance of this,\r\nthe couple not uncommonly separate.[112] Dr. Bérenger-Féraud states\r\nthat, among the Wolofs in Senegambia, “ce n’est que lorsque les signes\r\nde la grossesse sont irrécusables chez la fiancée, quelquefois même ce\r\nn’est qu’après la naissance d’un ou plusieurs enfants, que la cérémonie\r\ndu mariage proprement dit s’accomplit.”[113] And the Igorrotes of Luzon\r\nconsider no engagement binding until the woman has become pregnant.[114]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Emin Pasha tells us that, among the Mádi in Central\r\nAfrica, “should a girl become pregnant, the youth who has been her\r\ncompanion is bound to marry her, and to pay to her father the customary\r\nprice of a bride.”[115] Burton reports a similar custom as prevailing\r\namong peoples dwelling to the south of the equator.[116] Among many of\r\nthe wild tribes of Borneo, there is almost unrestrained intercourse\r\nbetween the youth of both sexes; but, if pregnancy ensue, marriage\r\nis regarded as necessary.[117] The same, as I am informed by Dr.\r\nA. Bunker, is the case with some Karen tribes in Burma. In Tahiti,\r\naccording to Cook, the father might kill his natural child, but if he\r\nsuffered it to live, the parties were considered to be in the married\r\nstate.[118] Among the Tipperahs of the Chittagong Hills,[119] as well\r\nas the peasants of the Ukraine,[120] a seducer is bound to marry the\r\ngirl, should she become pregnant. Again, Mr.Powers informs us that,\r\namong the Californian Wintun, if a wife is abandoned when she has a\r\nyoung child, she is justified by her friends in destroying it on the\r\nground that it has no supporter.[121] And among the Creeks, a young\r\nwoman that becomes pregnant by a man whom she had expected to marry,\r\nand is disappointed, is allowed the same privilege.[122]\r\n\r\nIt might, however, be supposed that, in man, the prolonged union of the\r\nsexes is due to another cause besides the offspring’s want of parental\r\ncare, _i.e._, to the fact that the sexual instinct is not restricted to\r\nany particular season, but endures throughout the whole year. “That\r\nwhich distinguishes man from the beast,” Beaumarchais says, “is\r\ndrinking without being thirsty, and making love at all seasons.” But in\r\nthe next chapter, I shall endeavour to show that this is probably not\r\nquite correct, so far as our earliest human or semi-human ancestors are\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nA HUMAN PAIRING SEASON IN PRIMITIVE TIMES\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Leuckart assumes that the periodicity in the sexual life of\r\nanimals depends upon economical conditions, the reproductive matter\r\nbeing a surplus of the individual economy. Hence he says that the rut\r\noccurs at the time when the proportion between receipts and expenditure\r\nis most favourable.[123]\r\n\r\nThough this hypothesis is accepted by several eminent physiologists,\r\nfacts do not support the assumption that the power of reproduction is\r\ncorrelated with abundance of food and bodily vigour. There are some\r\nwriters who even believe that the reverse is the case.[124]\r\n\r\nAt any rate, it is not correct to say, with Dr. Gruenhagen, that “the\r\ngeneral wedding-feast is spring, when awakening nature opens, to most\r\nanimals, new and ample sources of living.”[125] This is certainly true\r\nof Reptiles and Birds, but not of Mammals; every month or season of the\r\nyear is the pairing season of one or another mammalian species.[126]\r\nBut notwithstanding this apparent irregularity, the pairing time of\r\nevery species is bound by an unfailing law; it sets in earlier or\r\nlater, according as the period of gestation lasts longer or shorter,\r\nso that the young may be born at the time when they are most likely to\r\nsurvive. Thus, most Mammals bring forth their young early in spring,\r\nor, in tropical countries, at the beginning of the rainy season; the\r\nperiod then commences when life is more easily sustained, when prey\r\nis most abundant, when there is enough water and vegetable food, and\r\nwhen the climate becomes warmer. In the highlands, animals pair later\r\nthan those living in lower regions,[127] whilst those of the polar\r\nand temperate zones generally pair later than those of the tropics.\r\nAs regards the species living in different latitudes the pairing time\r\ncomes earlier or later, according to the differences in climate.[128]\r\n\r\nFar from depending upon any general physiological law, the rut is\r\nthus adapted to the requirements of each species separately. Here\r\nagain we have an example of the powerful effects of natural selection,\r\noften showing themselves very obviously. The dormouse (_Muscardinus\r\navellanarius_), for instance, that feeds upon hazel-nuts, pairs in\r\nJuly, and brings forth its young in August, when nuts begin to ripen.\r\nThen the young grow very quickly, so that they are able to bear the\r\nautumn and winter cold.[129]\r\n\r\nThere are, however, a few wild species, as some whales,[130]\r\nthe elephant,[131] many Rodents,[132] and several of the lower\r\nmonkeys,[133] that seem to have no definite pairing season. As to\r\nthem it is, perhaps, sufficient to quote Dr. Brehm’s statement with\r\nreference to the elephant, “The richness of their woods is so great,\r\nthat they really never suffer want.”[134] But the man-like apes do not\r\nbelong to this class. According to Mr. Winwood Reade, the male Gorillas\r\nfight at the rutting season for their females;[135] Dr. Mohnike, as\r\nalso other authorities, mentions the occurrence of a rut-time with the\r\nOrang-utan.[136] And we find that both of these species breed early in\r\nthe season when fruits begin to be plentiful,—that is, their pairing\r\ntime depends on the same law as that which prevails in the rest of the\r\nanimal kingdom.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Burton says, “The Gorilla breeds about December, a cool\r\nand dry month; according to my bushmen, the period of gestation is\r\nbetween five and six months.”[137] I have referred this important\r\nstatement to Mr. Alfred R. Wallace, who writes as follows: “From the\r\nmaps of rain distribution in Africa in Stanford’s ‘Compendium,’ the\r\ndriest months in the Gorilla country seem to be January and February,\r\nand these would probably be the months of greatest fruit supply.” As\r\nregards the Orang-utan, Mr. Wallace adds, “I found the young sucking\r\nOrang-utan in May; that was about the second or third month of the dry\r\nseason, in which fruits began to be plentiful.”\r\n\r\nConsidering, then, that the periodicity of the sexual life rests\r\non the kind of food on which the species lives, together with\r\nother circumstances connected with anatomical and physiological\r\npeculiarities, and considering, further, the close biological\r\nresemblance between man and the man-like apes, we are almost compelled\r\nto assume that the pairing time of our earliest human or half-human\r\nancestors was restricted to a certain season of the year, as was also\r\nthe case with their nearest relations among the lower animals. This\r\npresumption derives further probability from there being, even now,\r\nsome rude peoples who are actually stated to have an annual pairing\r\ntime, and other peoples whose sexual instinct undergoes most decidedly\r\na periodical increase at a certain time of the year.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Johnston, the wild Indians of California, belonging to\r\nthe lowest races on earth, “have their rutting seasons as regularly\r\nas have the deer, the elk, the antelope, or any other animals.”[138]\r\nAnd Mr. Powers confirms the correctness of this statement, at least\r\nwith regard to some of these Indians, saying that spring “is a literal\r\nSaint Valentine’s Day with them, as with the natural beasts and birds\r\nof the forest.”[139]\r\n\r\nAs regards the Goddanes in Luzon, Mr. Foreman tells us that “it is\r\nthe custom of the young men about to marry, to vie with each other\r\nin presenting to the sires of their future bride all the scalps they\r\nare able to take from their enemies, as proof of their manliness\r\nand courage. This practice prevails at the season of the year when\r\nthe tree—popularly called by the Spaniards ‘the fire-tree’—is in\r\nbloom.”[140]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Watch-an-dies in the western part of Australia, Mr.\r\nOldfield remarks, “Like the beasts of the field, the savage has\r\nbut one time for copulation in the year.[141] About the middle of\r\nspring ... the Watch-an-dies begin to think of holding their grand\r\nsemi-religious festival of Caa-ro, preparatory to the performance of\r\nthe important duty of procreation.”[142] A similar feast, according to\r\nMr. Bonwick, was celebrated by the Tasmanians at the same time of the\r\nyear.[143]\r\n\r\nThe Hos, an Indian hill tribe, have, as we are informed by Colonel\r\nDalton, every year a great feast in January, “when the granaries are\r\nfull of grain, and the people, to use their own expression, full of\r\ndevilry. They have a strange notion that at this period, men and women\r\nare so over-charged with vicious propensities, that it is absolutely\r\nnecessary for the safety of the person to let off steam by allowing for\r\na time full vent to the passions. The festival, therefore, becomes a\r\nsaturnalia, during which servants forget their duty to their masters,\r\nchildren their reverence for parents, men their respect for women,\r\nand women all notions of modesty, delicacy, and gentleness.” Men and\r\nwomen become almost like animals in the indulgence of their amorous\r\npropensities, and the utmost liberty is given to the girls.[144]\r\n\r\nThe same writer adds that “it would appear that most Hill Tribes have\r\nfound it necessary to promote marriage by stimulating intercourse\r\nbetween the sexes at particular seasons of the year.”[145] Among the\r\nSantals, “the marriages mostly take place once a year, in January;\r\nfor six days all the candidates for matrimony live in promiscuous\r\nconcubinage, after which the whole party are supposed to have\r\npaired off as man and wife.”[146] The Punjas in Jeypore, according\r\nto Dr. Shortt, have a festival in the first month of the new year,\r\nwhere men and women assemble. The lower order or castes observe\r\nthis festival, which is kept up for a month, by both sexes mixing\r\npromiscuously, and taking partners as their choice directs.[147]\r\nA similar feast, comprising a continuous course of debauchery and\r\nlicentiousness, is held once a year, by the Kotars, a tribe inhabiting\r\nthe Neilgherries;[148] according to Mr. Bancroft, by the Keres in\r\nNew Mexico;[149] according to Dr. Fritsch, by the Hottentots;[150]\r\naccording to the Rev. H. Rowley, by the Kafirs;[151] and, as I am\r\ninformed by Mr. A. J. Swann, by some tribes near Nyassa. Writers of the\r\nsixteenth century speak of the existence of certain early festivals in\r\nRussia, at which great license prevailed. According to Pamphill, these\r\nannual gatherings took place, as a rule, at the end of June, the day\r\nbefore the festival of St. John the Baptist, which, in pagan times, was\r\nthat of a divinity known by the name of Jarilo, corresponding to the\r\nPriapus of the Greeks.[152] At Rome, a festival in honour of Venus took\r\nplace in the month of April;[153] and Mannhardt mentions some curious\r\npopular customs in Germany, England, Esthonia and other European\r\ncountries, which seem to indicate an increase of the sexual instinct in\r\nspring or at the beginning of summer.[154]\r\n\r\nBy questions addressed to persons living among various savage peoples,\r\nI have inquired whether among these peoples, marriages are principally\r\ncontracted at a certain time of the year, and whether more children are\r\nborn in one month or season than in another. In answer, Mr. Radfield\r\nwrites from Lifu, near New Caledonia, that marriages there formerly\r\ntook place at various times, when suitable, but “November used to be\r\nthe time at which engagements were made.” As the seasons in this island\r\nare the reverse of those in England, this month includes the end of\r\nspring and the beginning of summer. The Rev. H. T. Cousins informs\r\nme that, among the Kafirs inhabiting what is known as Cis-Natalian\r\nKafirland, “there are more children born in one month or season\r\nthan in another, _viz._ August and September, which are the spring\r\nmonths in South Africa;” and he ascribes this surplus of births to\r\nfeasts, comprising debauchery and unrestricted intercourse between the\r\nunmarried people of both sexes. Again, Dr. A. Sims writes from Stanley\r\nPool that, among the Bateke, more children are born in September and\r\nOctober, that is, in the seasons of the early rains, than at other\r\ntimes; and the Rev. Ch. E. Ingham, writing from Banza Manteka, states\r\nthat he believes the same to be the case among the Bakongo. But the\r\nRev. T. Bridges informs me that, among the Yahgans in the southern\r\npart of Tierra del Fuego, so far as he knows, one month is the same as\r\nanother with regard to the number of births. I venture, however, to\r\nthink that this result might be somewhat modified by a minute inquiry,\r\nembracing a sufficient number of cases. For statistics prove that even\r\nin civilized countries, there is a regular periodical fluctuation in\r\nthe birth-rate.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century Wargentin showed that, in Sweden more\r\nchildren were born in one month than in another.[155] The same has\r\nsince been found to be the case in other European countries. According\r\nto Wappäus, the number of births in Sardinia, Belgium, Holland, and\r\nSweden is subject to a regular increase twice a year, the maximum\r\nof the first increase occurring in February or March, that of the\r\nsecond in September and October.[156] M. Sormani observed that, in the\r\nsouth of Italy, there is an increase only once in the year, but more\r\nto the north twice, in spring and in autumn.[157] Dr. Mayr and Dr.\r\nBeukemann found in Germany two annual maxima—in February or March, and\r\nin September;—[158]and Dr. Haycraft states that, in the eight largest\r\ntowns of Scotland, more children are born in legitimate wedlock in\r\nApril than in any other month.[159] As a rule, according to M. Sormani,\r\nthe first annual augmentation of births has its maximum, in Sweden, in\r\nMarch; in France and Holland, between February and March; in Belgium,\r\nSpain, Austria and Italy, in February; in Greece, in January; so that\r\nit comes earlier in southern Europe than farther to the north.[160]\r\nAgain, the second annual increase is found more considerable the more\r\nto the north we go. In South Germany it is smaller than the first\r\none, but in North Germany generally larger;[161] and in Sweden, it is\r\ndecidedly larger.[162]\r\n\r\nAs to non-European countries, Wappäus observed that in Massachusetts,\r\nthe birth-rate likewise underwent an increase twice a year, the\r\nmaxima falling in March and September; and that in Chili many more\r\nchildren were born in September and October—_i.e._, at the beginning\r\nof spring—than in any other month.[163] Finally, Mr. S. A. Hill, of\r\nAllahabad, has proved, by statistical data, that, among the Hindus\r\nof that province, the birth-rates exhibit a most distinct annual\r\nvariation, the minimum falling in June and the maximum in September and\r\nOctober.[164]\r\n\r\nThis unequal distribution of births over the different months of the\r\nyear is ascribed to various causes by statisticians. It is, however,\r\ngenerally admitted that the maximum in February and March (in Chili,\r\nSeptember) is, at least to a great extent, due to the sexual instinct\r\nbeing strongest in May and June (in Chili, December).[165] This is the\r\nmore likely to be the case as it is especially illegitimate births that\r\nare then comparatively numerous. And it appears extremely probable\r\nthat, in Africa also, the higher birth-rates in the seasons of the\r\nearly rains owe their origin to the same cause.\r\n\r\nThus, comparing the facts stated, we find, among various races of men,\r\nthe sexual instinct increasing at the end of spring, or, rather, at the\r\nbeginning of summer. Some peoples of India seem to form an exception to\r\nthis rule, lascivious festivals, in the case of several of them, taking\r\nplace in the month of January, and the maximum of births, among the\r\nHindus of Allahabad, falling at the end of the hot season, or in early\r\nautumn. But in India also there are traces of strengthened passions in\r\nspring. M. Rousselet gives the following description of the indecent\r\nHoli festival, as it is celebrated among the Hindus of Oudeypour. “The\r\nfestival of Holi marks the arrival of spring, and is held in honour\r\nof the goddess Holica, or Vasanti, who personifies that season in the\r\nHindu Pantheon. The carnival lasts several days, during which time the\r\nmost licentious debauchery and disorder reign throughout every class of\r\nsociety. It is the regular saturnalia of India. Persons of the greatest\r\nrespectability, without regard to rank or age, are not ashamed to take\r\npart in the orgies which mark this season of the year.... Women and\r\nchildren crowd round the hideous idols of the feast of Holica, and\r\ndeck them with flowers; and immorality reigns supreme in the streets\r\nof the capital.”[166] Among the Aryans who inhabited the plains of the\r\nNorth, the spring, or “vasanta,” corresponding to the months of March\r\nand April, was the season of love and pleasure, celebrated in song by\r\nthe poets, and the time for marriages and religious feasts.[167] And\r\namong the Rajputs of Mewar, according to Lieutenant-Colonel Tod, the\r\nlast days of spring are dedicated to Camdéva, the god of love: “the\r\nscorching winds of the hot season are already beginning to blow, when\r\nFlora droops her head, and the ‘god of love turns anchorite.’”[168]\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, infer that this enhancement of the procreative\r\npower is to be attributed directly to “the different positions of\r\nthe sun with respect to the earth,”[169] or to the temperature of\r\na certain season. The phenomenon does not immediately spring from\r\nthis cause in the case of any other animal species. Neither can it\r\nbe due to abundance of food. In the northern parts of Europe many\r\nmore conceptions take place in the months of May and June, when the\r\nconditions of life are often rather hard, than in September, October,\r\nand November, when the supplies of food are comparatively plentiful.\r\nIn the north-western provinces of Germany, as well as in Sweden, the\r\nlatter months are characterized by a minimum of conceptions.[170] Among\r\nthe Kaffirs, more children are conceived in November and December than\r\nin any other month, although, according to the Rev. H. T. Cousins,\r\nfood is most abundant among them from March to September. And among\r\nthe Bateke, the maximum of conceptions falls in December and January,\r\nalthough food is, as I am informed by Dr. Sims, most plentiful in the\r\ndry season, that is, from May to the end of August.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the periodical increase of conceptions cannot\r\nbe explained by the opposite hypothesis, entertained by some\r\nphysiologists, that the power of reproduction is increased by want\r\nand distress. Among the Western Australians and Californians,[171]\r\nfor instance, the season of love is accompanied by a surplus of food,\r\nand in the land of the Bakongo, among whom Mr. Ingham believes most\r\nconceptions to take place in December and January, food is, according\r\nto him, most abundant precisely in these months and in February.\r\n\r\nIt seems, therefore, a reasonable presumption that the increase of the\r\nsexual instinct at the end of spring or in the beginning of summer, is\r\na survival of an ancient pairing season, depending upon the same law\r\nthat rules in the rest of the animal kingdom. Since spring is rather\r\na time of want than a time of abundance for a frugivorous species,\r\nit is impossible to believe that our early ancestors, as long as\r\nthey fed upon fruits, gave birth to their young at the beginning of\r\nthat period. From the statements of Sir Richard Burton and Mr. A. R.\r\nWallace, already quoted,[172] we know that the man-like apes breed\r\nearly in the season when fruits begin to be plentiful. But when man\r\nbegan to feed on herbs, roots, and animal food, the conditions were\r\nchanged. Spring is the season of the re-awakening of life, when there\r\nare plenty of vegetables and prey. Hence those children whose infancy\r\nfell in this period survived more frequently than those born at any\r\nother. Considering that the parents of at least a few of them must have\r\nhad an innate tendency to the increase of the power of reproduction at\r\nthe beginning of summer, and considering, further, that this tendency\r\nmust have been transmitted to some of the offspring, like many other\r\ncharacteristics which occur periodically at certain seasons,[173]\r\nwe can readily understand that gradually, through the influence of\r\nnatural selection, a race would emerge whose pairing time would be\r\nexclusively or predominantly restricted to the season most favourable\r\nto its subsistence. To judge from the period when most children are\r\nborn among existing peoples, the pairing season of our prehistoric\r\nancestors occurred, indeed, somewhat earlier in the year than is the\r\ncase with the majority of mammalian species. But we must remember that\r\nthe infancy of man is unusually long; and, with regard to the time\r\nmost favourable to the subsistence of children, we must take into\r\nconsideration not only the first days of their existence, but the\r\nfirst period of their infancy in general. Besides food and warmth,\r\nseveral other factors affect the welfare of the offspring, and it is\r\noften difficult to find out all of them. We do not know the particular\r\ncircumstances that make the badger breed at the end of February or the\r\nbeginning of March,[174] and the reindeer of the Norwegian mountains\r\nas early as April;[175] but there can be no doubt that these breeding\r\nseasons are adapted to the requirements of the respective species.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the winter maximum of conceptions, especially considerable\r\namong the peoples of Northern Europe, is generally sought in social\r\ninfluences, as the quiet ensuing on the harvest time, the better\r\nfood, and the amusements of Christmas.[176] But the people certainly\r\nrecover before December from the labours of the field, and Christmas\r\namusements, as Wargentin remarks, take place at the end of that month\r\nand far into January, without any particular influence upon the number\r\nof births in October being observable.[177] It has, further, been\r\nproved that the unequal distribution of marriages over the different\r\nmonths exercises hardly any influence upon the distribution of\r\nbirths.[178] Again, among the Hindus the December and January maximum\r\nof conceptions seems from the lascivious festivities of several Indian\r\npeoples to be due to an increase of the sexual instinct. According\r\nto Mr. Hill, this increase depends upon healthy conditions with an\r\nabundant food supply. But, as I have already said, it is not proved\r\nthat a strengthened power of reproduction and abundance of food are\r\nconnected with one another.\r\n\r\nI am far from venturing to express any definite opinion as to the cause\r\nof these particular phenomena, but it is not impossible that they also\r\nare effects of natural selection, although of a comparatively recent\r\ndate. Considering that the September maximum of births (or December\r\nmaximum of conceptions) in Europe becomes larger the farther north\r\nwe go; that the agricultural peoples of Northern Europe have plenty\r\nof food in autumn and during the first part of winter, but often\r\nsuffer a certain degree of want in spring; and, finally, that the\r\nwinter cold does not affect the health of infants, the woods giving\r\nsufficient material for fuel,—it has occurred to me that children born\r\nin September may have a better chance of surviving than others. Indeed,\r\nDr. Beukemann states that the number of still-born births is largest in\r\nwinter or at the beginning of spring, and that “the children born in\r\nautumn possess the greatest vitality and resisting power against the\r\ndangers of earliest infancy.”[179] This would perhaps be an adequate\r\nexplanation either of an increase of the sexual instinct or of greater\r\ndisposition to impregnation in December. It is not impossible either,\r\nthat the increase of the power of reproduction among the Hindus in\r\nDecember and January, which causes an increase of births in September\r\nand October—_i.e._, the end of the hot season and the beginning\r\nof winter—owes its origin to the fact that during the winter the\r\ngranaries get filled and some of the conditions of life become more\r\nhealthy. But it should be remarked that September itself, according to\r\nMr. Hill, is a very unhealthy month.[180]\r\n\r\nNow it can be explained, I believe for the first time, how it happens\r\nthat man, unlike the lower animals, is not limited to a particular\r\nperiod of the year in which to court the female.[181] The Darwinian\r\ntheory of natural selection can, as it seems to me, account for the\r\nperiodicity of the sexual instinct in such a rude race as the Western\r\nAustralians, among whom the mortality of children is so enormous\r\nthat the greater number of them do not survive even the first month\r\nafter birth,[182] and who inhabit a land pre-eminently unproductive\r\nof animals and vegetables fitted to sustain human life, a land where,\r\n“during the summer seasons, the black man riots in comparative\r\nabundance, but during the rest of the year ... the struggle for\r\nexistence becomes very severe.”[183] The more progress man makes in\r\narts and inventions; the more he acquires the power of resisting\r\ninjurious external influences; the more he rids himself of the\r\nnecessity of freezing when it is cold, and starving when nature is less\r\nlavish with food; in short, the more independent he becomes of the\r\nchanges of the seasons—the greater is the probability that children\r\nborn at one time of the year will survive as well, or almost as well,\r\nas those born at any other. Variations as regards the pairing time,\r\nalways likely to occur occasionally, will do so the more frequently on\r\naccount of changed conditions of life, which directly or indirectly\r\ncause variability of every kind;[184] and these variations will be\r\npreserved and transmitted to following generations. Thus we can\r\nunderstand how a race has arisen, endowed with the ability to procreate\r\nchildren in any season. We can also understand how, even in such a rude\r\nrace as the Yahgans in Tierra del Fuego, the seasonable distribution\r\nof births seems to be pretty equal, as there is, according to the Rev.\r\nT. Bridges, “such a variety of food in the various seasons that there\r\nis strictly no period of hardship, save such as is caused by accidents\r\nof weather.” We can explain, too, why the periodical fluctuation in\r\nthe number of births, though comparatively inconsiderable in every\r\ncivilized society, is greater in countries predominantly agricultural,\r\nsuch as Chili, than in countries predominantly industrial, as\r\nSaxony;[185] why it is greater in rural districts than in towns;[186]\r\nand why it was greater in Sweden in the middle of the last century than\r\nit is now.[187] For the more man has abandoned natural life out of\r\ndoors, the more luxury has increased and his habits have got refined,\r\nthe greater is the variability to which his sexual life has become\r\nsubject, and the smaller has been the influence exerted upon it by the\r\nchanges of the seasons.\r\n\r\nMan has thus gone through the same transition as certain domestic\r\nanimals. The he-goat[188] and the ass in southern countries,[189]\r\nfor instance, rut throughout the whole year. The domestic pig pairs\r\ngenerally twice a year, while its wild ancestors had but one rutting\r\nseason.[190] Dr. Hermann Müller has even observed a canary that laid\r\neggs in autumn and winter.[191] Natural selection cannot, of course,\r\naccount for such alterations: they fall under the law of variation.\r\nIt is the limited pairing season that is a product of this powerful\r\nprocess, which acts with full force only under conditions free from\r\ncivilization and domestication.\r\n\r\nIf the hypothesis set forth in this chapter holds good, it must be\r\nadmitted that the continued excitement of the sexual instinct could not\r\nhave played a part in the origin of human marriage—provided that this\r\ninstitution did exist among primitive men. Whether this was the case I\r\nshall examine in the following chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE ANTIQUITY OF HUMAN MARRIAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it be admitted that marriage, as a necessary requirement for the\r\nexistence of certain species, is connected with some peculiarities\r\nin their organism, and, more particularly among the highest monkeys,\r\nwith the paucity of their progeny and their long period of infancy,—it\r\nmust at the same time be admitted that, among primitive men, from\r\nthe same causes as among these animals, the sexes in all probability\r\nkept together till after the birth of the offspring. Later on, when\r\nthe human race passed beyond its frugivorous stage and spread over\r\nthe earth, living chiefly on animal food, the assistance of an adult\r\nmale became still more necessary for the subsistence of the children.\r\nEverywhere the chase devolves on the man, it being a rare exception\r\namong savage peoples for a woman to engage in it.[192] Under such\r\nconditions a family consisting of mother and young only, would\r\nprobably, as a rule, have succumbed.\r\n\r\nIt has, however, been suggested that, in olden times, the natural\r\nguardian of the children was not the father, but the maternal\r\nuncle.[193] This inference has been drawn chiefly from the common\r\npractice of a nephew succeeding his mother’s brother in rank and\r\nproperty. But sometimes the relation between the two is still more\r\nintimate. “La famille Malaise proprement dite—le Sa-Mandei,—” says a\r\nDutch writer, as quoted by Professor Giraud-Teulon, “consiste dans\r\nla mère et ses enfants: le père n’en fait point partie. Les liens de\r\nparenté qui unissent ce dernier à ses frères et sœurs sont plus étrois\r\nque ceux qui le rattachent à sa femme et à ses propres enfants. Il\r\ncontinue même après son mariage à vivre dans sa famille maternelle;\r\nc’est là qu’est son véritable domicile, et non pas dans la maison de\r\nsa femme: il ne cesse pas de cultiver le champ de sa propre famille,\r\nà travailler pour elle, et n’aide sa femme qu’accidentellement. Le\r\nchef de la famille est ordinairement le frère aîné du côté maternel\r\n(le mamak ou avunculus). De par ses droits et ses devoirs, c’est lui\r\nle vrai père des enfants de sa sœur.”[194] As regards the mountaineers\r\nof Georgia, especially the Pshaves, M. Kovalevsky states that, among\r\nthem, “le frère de la mère prend la place du père dans toutes les\r\ncirconstances où il s’agit de venger le sang répandu, surtout au cas de\r\nmeurtre commis sur la personne de son neveu.”[195] Among the Goajiro\r\nIndians,[196] the Negroes of Bondo,[197] the Barea, and the Bazes,[198]\r\nit is the mother’s brother who has the right of selling a girl to her\r\nsuitor. Touching the Kois, the Rev. John Cain says, “The maternal\r\nuncle of any Koi girl has the right to bestow her hand on any one of\r\nhis sons, or any other suitable candidate who meets with his approval.\r\nThe father and the mother of the girl have no acknowledged voice in the\r\nmatter. A similar custom prevails amongst some of the Komâti (Vaiśya)\r\ncaste.”[199] Among the Savaras in India, the bridegroom has to give a\r\nbullock not only to the girl’s father, but to the maternal uncle;[200]\r\nwhilst among the Creeks, the proxy of the suitor asked for the consent\r\nof the uncles, aunts, and brothers of the young woman, “the father\r\nhaving no voice or authority in the business.”[201]\r\n\r\nBut such cases are rare. Besides, most of them imply only that the\r\nchildren in a certain way belong to the uncle, not that the father is\r\nreleased from the obligation of supporting them. Even where succession\r\nruns through females only, the father is nearly always certainly the\r\nhead of the family. Thus, for instance, in Melanesia, where the clan of\r\nthe children is determined by that of the mother, “the mother is,” to\r\nquote Dr. Codrington, “in no way the head of the family. The house of\r\nthe family is the father’s, the garden is his, the rule and government\r\nare his.”[202] Nor is there any reason to believe that it was generally\r\notherwise in former times. A man could not of course be the guardian\r\nof his sister’s children, if he did not live in close connection with\r\nthem. But except in such a decidedly anomalous case as that of the\r\nMalays, just referred to, this could scarcely happen unless marriages\r\nwere contracted between persons living closely together. Nowadays,\r\nhowever, such marriages are usually avoided, and I shall endeavour\r\nlater on to show that they were probably also avoided by our remote\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nIt might, further, be objected that the children were equally well or\r\nbetter provided for, if not the fathers only, but all the males of\r\nthe tribe indiscriminately were their guardians. The supporters of\r\nthe hypothesis of promiscuity, and even other sociologists, as for\r\ninstance Herr Kautsky,[203] believe that this really was the case among\r\nprimitive men. According to them, the tribe or horde is the primary\r\nsocial unit of the human race, and the family only a secondary unit,\r\ndeveloped in later times. Indeed, this assumption has been treated\r\nby many writers, not as a more or less probable hypothesis, but as a\r\ndemonstrated truth. Yet the idea that a man’s children belong to the\r\ntribe, has no foundation in fact. Everywhere we find the tribes or\r\nclans composed of several families, the members of each family being\r\nmore closely connected with one another than with the rest of the\r\ntribe. The family, consisting of parents, children, and often also\r\ntheir next descendants, is a universal institution among existing\r\npeoples.[204] And it seems extremely probable that, among our earliest\r\nhuman ancestors, the family formed, if not the society itself, at least\r\nthe nucleus of it. As this is a question of great importance, I must\r\ndeal with it at some length.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin remarks, “Judging from the analogy of the majority of the\r\nQuadrumana, it is probable that the early ape-like progenitors of man\r\nwere likewise social.”[205] But it may be doubted whether Mr. Darwin\r\nwould have drawn this inference, had he taken into consideration the\r\nremarkable fact that none of the monkeys most nearly allied to man can\r\nbe called social animals.\r\n\r\nThe solitary life of the Orang-utan has already been noted. As\r\nregards Gorillas, Dr. Savage states that there is only one adult male\r\nattached to each group;[206] and Mr. Reade says expressly that they\r\nare not gregarious, though they sometimes seem to assemble in large\r\nnumbers.[207] Both Mr. Du Chaillu[208] and Herr von Koppenfels[209]\r\nassure us likewise that the Gorilla generally lives in pairs or\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nThe same is the case with the Chimpanzee. “It is seldom,” Dr. Savage\r\nsays, “that more than one or two nests are seen upon the same tree or\r\nin the same neighbourhood; five have been found, but it was an unusual\r\ncircumstance. They do not live in ‘villages’.... They are more often\r\nseen in pairs than in gangs.... As seen here, they cannot be called\r\ngregarious.”[210] This statement, confirmed or repeated by Mr. Du\r\nChaillu[211] and Professor Hartmann,[212] is especially interesting, as\r\nthe Chimpanzee resembles man also in his comparatively slight strength\r\nand courage, so that a gregarious life might be supposed to be better\r\nsuited to this animal.\r\n\r\nMr. Spencer, however, has pointed out that not only size, strength,\r\nand means of defence, but also the kind and distribution of food and\r\nother factors must variously co-operate and conflict to determine how\r\nfar a gregarious life is beneficial, and how far a solitary life.[213]\r\nConsidering, then, that, according to Dr. Savage, the Chimpanzees are\r\nmore numerous in the season when the greatest number of fruits come to\r\nmaturity,[214] we may almost with certainty infer that the solitary\r\nlife generally led by this ape is due chiefly to the difficulty it\r\nexperiences in getting food at other times of the year.\r\n\r\nIs it not, then, most probable that our fruit-eating human or\r\nhalf-human ancestors, living on the same kind of food, and requiring\r\nabout the same quantities of it as the man-like apes, were not more\r\ngregarious than they? It is likely, too, that subsequently, when man\r\nbecame partly carnivorous, he continued, as a rule, this solitary\r\nkind of life, or that gregariousness became his habit only in part.\r\n“An animal of a predatory kind,” says Mr. Spencer, “which has prey\r\nthat can be caught and killed without help, profits by living alone:\r\nespecially if its prey is much scattered, and is secured by stealthy\r\napproach or by lying in ambush. Gregariousness would here be a positive\r\ndisadvantage. Hence the tendency of large carnivores, and also of\r\nsmall carnivores that have feeble and widely-distributed prey, to lead\r\nsolitary lives.”[215] It is, indeed, very remarkable that even now\r\nthere are savage peoples who live rather in separate families than in\r\ntribes, and that most of these peoples belong to the very rudest races\r\nin the world.[216]\r\n\r\n“‘The wild or forest Veddahs,’” Mr. Pridham states, “build their\r\nhuts in trees, live in pairs, only occasionally assembling in greater\r\nnumbers, and exhibit no traces of the remotest civilization, nor\r\nany knowledge of social rites.”[217] According to Mr. Bailey, the\r\nNilgala Veddahs, who are considered the wildest, “are distributed\r\nthrough their lovely country in small septs, or families, occupying\r\ngenerally caves in the rocks, though some have little bark huts. They\r\ndepend almost solely on hunting for their support, and hold little\r\ncommunication even with each other.”[218]\r\n\r\nIn Tierra del Fuego, according to Bishop Stirling, family life is\r\nexclusive. “Get outside the family,” he says, “and relationships are\r\ndoubtful, if not hostile. The bond of a common language is no security\r\nfor friendly offices.”[219] Commander Wilkes states likewise that the\r\nFuegians “appear to live in families and not in tribes, and do not\r\nseem to acknowledge any chief;[220]” and, according to M. Hyades, “la\r\nfamille est bien constitutée, mais la tribu n’existe pas, à proprement\r\nparler.”[221] Each family is perfectly independent of all the others,\r\nand only the necessity of common defence now and then induces a few\r\nfamilies to form small gangs without any chief.[222] The Rev. T.\r\nBridges writes to me, “They live in clans, called by them Ucuhr,\r\nwhich means a house. These Ucuhr comprise many subdivisions; and the\r\nmembers are necessarily related. But,” he continues, “the Yahgans are\r\na roving people, having their districts and moving about within these\r\ndistricts from bay to bay and island to island in canoes, without any\r\norder. The whole clan seldom travels together, and only occasionally\r\nand then always incidentally is it to be found collected. The smaller\r\ndivisions keep more together.... Occasionally, as many as five families\r\nare to be found living in a wigwam, but generally two families.”\r\nIndeed, in ‘A Voice for South America,’ Mr. Bridges says that “family\r\ninfluence is the one great tie which binds these natives together, and\r\nthe one great preventive of violence.”[223]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the West Australians, who are probably better known to him\r\nthan to any other civilized man, Bishop Salvado says that they “au\r\nlieu de se gouverner par tribus, paraissent se gouverner à la manière\r\npatriarchale: chaque famille, qui généralement ne compte pas plus de\r\nsix à neuf individus, forme comme une petite société, sous la seule\r\ndépendance de son propre chef.... Chaque famille s’approprie une espèce\r\nde district, dont cependant les families voisines jouissent en commun\r\nsi l’on vit en bonne harmonie.”[224]\r\n\r\nMr. Stanbridge, who spent eighteen years in the wilds of Victoria,\r\ntells us that the savages there are associated in tribes or families,\r\nthe members of which vary much in number. Each tribe has its own\r\nboundaries, the land of which is parcelled out amongst families and\r\ncarefully transmitted by direct descent; these boundaries being so\r\nsacredly maintained that the member of no single family will venture on\r\nthe lands of a neighbouring one without invitation.[225] And touching\r\nthe Gournditch-mara, Mr. Howitt states that “each family camped by\r\nitself.”[226]\r\n\r\nThe Bushmans of South Africa, according to Dr. Fritsch, are almost\r\nentirely devoid of a tribal organization. Even when a number of\r\nfamilies occasionally unite in a larger horde, this association is more\r\nor less accidental, and not regulated by any laws.[227] But a horde\r\ncommonly consists of the different members of one family only, at least\r\nif the children are old and strong enough to help their parents to find\r\nfood.[228] “Sexual feelings, the instinctive love to children, or the\r\ncustomary attachment among relations,” says Lichtenstein, “are the\r\nonly ties that keep them in any sort of union.”[229]\r\n\r\nThe like is stated to be true of several peoples in Brazil. According\r\nto v. Martius, travellers often meet there with a language “used only\r\nby a few individuals connected with each other by relationship, who\r\nare thus completely isolated, and can hold no communication with any\r\nof their other countrymen far or near.”[230] With reference to the\r\nBotocudos, v. Tschudi says that “the family is the only tie which\r\njoins these rude children of nature with each other.”[231] The Guachís,\r\nMauhés, and Guatós for the most part live scattered in families,[232]\r\nand the social condition of the Caishánas, among whom each family has\r\nits own solitary hut, “is of a low type, very little removed, indeed,\r\nfrom that of the brutes living in the same forests.”[233] The Marauá\r\nIndians live likewise in separate families or small hordes, and so\r\ndo some other of the tribes visited by Mr. Bates.[234] According to\r\nMr. Southey, the Cayáguas or Wood-Indians, who inhabited the forests\r\nbetween the Paraná and the Uruguay, were not in a social state; “one\r\nfamily lived at a distance from another, in a wretched hut composed of\r\nboughs; they subsisted wholly by prey, and when larger game failed,\r\nwere contented with snakes, mice, pismires, worms, and any kind of\r\nreptile or vermin.”[235] Again, speaking of the Coroados, v. Spix and\r\nv. Martius say that “they live without any bond of social union,\r\nneither under a republican nor a patriarchal form of government. Even\r\nfamily ties are very loose among them.”[236]\r\n\r\nThe Togiagamutes, an Eskimo tribe, never visited by white men in\r\ntheir own country until the year 1880, who lead a thoroughly nomadic\r\nlife, wandering from place to place in search of game or fish,\r\nappear, according to Petroff, “to live in the most perfect state of\r\nindependence of each other. Even the communities do not seem bound\r\ntogether in any way; families and groups of families constantly\r\nchanging their abode, leaving one community and joining another, or\r\nperhaps forming one of their own. The youth, as soon as he is able to\r\nbuild a kaiak and to support himself, no longer observes any family\r\nties, but goes where his fancy takes him, frequently roaming about with\r\nhis kaiak for thousands of miles before another fancy calls him to take\r\na wife, to excavate a miserable dwelling, and to settle down for a\r\ntime.”[237]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Finns, too, according to the linguistic researches of\r\nProfessor Ahlqvist, were without any kind of tribal organization. In\r\nhis opinion, such a state would have been almost impossible among them,\r\nas they lived in scattered families for the sake of the chase and in\r\norder to have pastures for their reindeer.[238]\r\n\r\nThat the comparatively solitary life which the families of these\r\npeoples live, is due to want of sufficient food, appears from several\r\nfacts. Lichtenstein tells us that the hardships experienced by the\r\nBushmans in satisfying the most urgent necessities of life, preclude\r\nthe possibility of their forming larger societies. Even the families\r\nthat form associations in small separate hordes are sometimes obliged\r\nto disperse, as the same spot will not afford sufficient sustenance\r\nfor all. “The smaller the number, the easier is a supply of food\r\nprocured.”[239]\r\n\r\n“Scarcity of food, and the facility with which they move from one\r\nplace to another in their canoes,” says Admiral Fitzroy, “are, no\r\ndoubt, the reasons why the Fuegians are always so dispersed among the\r\nislands in small family parties, why they never remain long in one\r\nplace, and why a large number are not seen many days in society.”[240]\r\n\r\nThe natives of Port Jackson, New South Wales, when visited a hundred\r\nyears ago by Captain Hunter, were associated in tribes of many\r\nfamilies living together, apparently without a fixed residence, the\r\ndifferent families wandering in different directions for food, but\r\nuniting on occasions of disputes with another tribe.[241] The Rev. A.\r\nMeyer assures us likewise, as regards the Encounter Bay tribe, that\r\n“the whole tribe does not always move in a body from one place to\r\nanother, unless there should be abundance of food to be obtained at\r\nsome particular spot; but generally they are scattered in search of\r\nfood.”[242] Again, with reference to the Australians more generally,\r\nMr. Brough Smyth remarks that “in any large area occupied by a tribe,\r\nwhere there was not much forest land, and where kangaroos were not\r\nnumerous, it is highly probable that the several families composing\r\nthe tribe would withdraw from their companions for short periods, at\r\ncertain seasons, and betake themselves to separate portions of the\r\narea, ... and it is more than probable—it is almost certain—that each\r\nhead of a family would betake himself, if practicable, to that portion\r\nwhich his father had frequented.”[243]\r\n\r\nFinally, from Mr. Wyeth’s account in Schoolcraft’s great work on\r\nthe Indian Tribes of the United States, I shall make the following\r\ncharacteristic quotation with reference to the Snakes inhabiting the\r\nalmost desert region which extends southward from the Snake River as\r\nfar as the southern end of the Great Salt Lake, and eastward from the\r\nRocky to the Blue Mountains:—“The paucity of game in this region\r\nis, I have little doubt, the cause of the almost entire absence of\r\nsocial organization among its inhabitants; no trace of it is ordinarily\r\nseen among them, except during salmon-time, when a large number of\r\nthe Snakes resort to the rivers, chiefly to the Fishing Falls, and\r\nat such places there seems some little organization.... Prior to the\r\nintroduction of the horse, no other tribal arrangement existed than\r\nsuch as is now seen in the management of the salmon fishery.... The\r\norganization would be very imperfect, because the remainder of the\r\nyear would be spent by them in families widely spread apart, to eke\r\nout the year’s subsistence on the roots and limited game of their\r\ncountry. After a portion of them, who are now called Bonaks, had\r\nobtained horses, they would naturally form bands and resort to the\r\nBuffalo region to gain their subsistence, retiring to the most fertile\r\nplaces in their own, to avoid the snows of the mountains and feed their\r\nhorses. Having food from the proceeds of the Buffalo hunt, to enable\r\nthem to live together, they would annually do so, for the protection\r\nof their horses, lodges, &c., &c. These interests have caused an\r\norganization among the Bonaks, which continues the year through,\r\nbecause the interests which produce it continue; and it is more\r\nadvanced than that of the other Snakes.”[244]\r\n\r\nHere, I think, we have an excellent account of the origin of society,\r\napplicable not only to the Snakes, but, in its main features, to man\r\nin general. The kind of food he subsisted upon, together with the\r\nlarge quantities of it that he wanted, probably formed in olden times\r\na hindrance to a true gregarious manner of living, except perhaps in\r\nsome unusually rich places. Man in the savage state, even when living\r\nin luxuriant countries, is often brought to the verge of starvation, in\r\nspite of his having implements and weapons which his ruder ancestors\r\nhad no idea of. If the obstacle from insufficient food-supply could\r\nbe overcome, gregariousness would no doubt be of great advantage\r\nto him. Living together, the families could resist the dangers of\r\nlife and defend themselves from their enemies much more easily than\r\nwhen solitary,—all the more so, as the physical strength of man, and\r\nespecially savage man,[245] is comparatively slight. Indeed, his bodily\r\ninferiority, together with his defencelessness and helplessness, has\r\nprobably been the chief lever of civilization.\r\n\r\n“He has,” to quote Mr. Darwin, “invented and is able to use various\r\nweapons, tools, traps, &c., with which he defends himself, kills or\r\ncatches prey, and otherwise obtains food. He has made rafts or canoes\r\nfor fishing or crossing over to neighbouring fertile islands. He has\r\ndiscovered the art of making fire, by which hard and stringy roots can\r\nbe rendered digestible, and poisonous roots or herbs innocuous.”[246]\r\nIn short, man gradually found out many new ways of earning his living\r\nand more and more emancipated himself from direct dependence on\r\nsurrounding nature. The chief obstacle to a gregarious life was by this\r\nmeans in part surmounted, and the advantages of such a life induced\r\nfamilies or small gangs to unite together in larger bodies. Thus it\r\nseems that the gregariousness and sociability of man sprang, in the\r\nmain, from progressive intellectual and material civilization, whilst\r\nthe tie that kept together husband and wife, parents and children, was,\r\nif not the only, at least the principal social factor in the earliest\r\nlife of man. I cannot, therefore, agree with Sir John Lubbock that, as\r\na general rule, as we descend in the scale of civilization, the family\r\ndiminishes, and the tribe increases, in importance.[247] This may hold\r\ngood for somewhat higher stages, but it does not apply to the lowest\r\nstages. Neither do I see any reason to believe that there _ever_ was a\r\ntime when the family was quite absorbed in the tribe. There does not\r\nexist a single well established instance of a people among whom this is\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nI do not, of course, deny that the tie which bound the children to the\r\nmother was much more intimate and more lasting than that which bound\r\nthem to the father. But it seems to me that the only result to which a\r\ncritical investigation of facts can lead us is, that in all probability\r\nthere has been no stage of human development when marriage has not\r\nexisted, and that the father has always been, as a rule, the protector\r\nof his family. Human marriage appears, then, to be an inheritance from\r\nsome ape-like progenitor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nA CRITICISM OF THE HYPOTHESIS OF PROMISCUITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inference drawn in the last chapter is opposed to the view held\r\nby most sociologists who have written upon early history. According\r\nto them, man lived originally in a state of promiscuity. This is the\r\nopinion of Bachofen, McLennan, Morgan, Lubbock, Bastian, Giraud-Teulon,\r\nLippert, Kohler, Post, Wilken, and several other writers.[248] Although\r\nsuggested at first only as a probable hypothesis, this presumption is\r\nnow treated by many writers as a demonstrated truth.[249]\r\n\r\nThe promiscuity of primitive man is not, however, generally considered\r\nto be perfectly indiscriminate, but limited to the individuals\r\nbelonging to the same tribe. It may, therefore, perhaps be said to be\r\na kind of marriage: polygyny combined with polyandry. Sir John Lubbock\r\nhas also given it the name of “communal marriage,” indicating by\r\nthis word, that all the men and women in a community were regarded as\r\nequally husbands and wives to one another. As I do not, in speaking of\r\nmarriage, take into consideration unions of so indefinite a nature,\r\nthis seems to be the proper place to discuss the hypothesis in question.\r\n\r\nThe evidence adduced in support of it flows from two sources. First,\r\nthere are, in the books of ancient writers and modern travellers,\r\nnotices of some savage nations said to live promiscuously; secondly,\r\nthere are some remarkable customs which are assumed to be social\r\nsurvivals, pointing to an earlier stage of civilization, when marriage\r\ndid not exist. Let us see whether this evidence will stand the test of\r\na critical examination.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHerodotus and Strabo inform us that, among the Massagetæ every man had\r\nhis own wife, but that all the other men of the tribe were allowed to\r\nhave sexual intercourse with her.[250] The Auseans, a Libyan people,\r\nhad, according to the former, their wives in common;[251] and Solinus\r\nreports the same of the Garamantians of Ethiopia.[252] Community\r\nof women is, further, alleged to have occurred among the Liburnes,\r\nGalactophagi,[253] and the ancient Bohemians.[254] And Garcilasso de la\r\nVega asserts that, among the natives of Passau in Peru, before the time\r\nof the Incas, men had no separate wives.[255]\r\n\r\nTo these statements of ancient peoples Sir J. Lubbock adds a few others\r\nconcerning modern savages.[256] “The Bushmen of South Africa,” he\r\nsays, “are stated to be entirely without marriage.” Sir Edward Belcher\r\ntells us that, in the Andaman Islands, the custom is for the man and\r\nwoman to remain together until the child is weaned, when they separate,\r\nand each seeks a new partner.[257] Speaking of the natives of Queen\r\nCharlotte Islands, Mr. Poole says that among them “the institution\r\nof marriage is altogether unknown,” and that the women “cohabit\r\nalmost promiscuously with their own tribe, though rarely with other\r\ntribes.”[258] In the Californian Peninsula, according to Baegert, the\r\nsexes met without any formalities, and their vocabulary did not even\r\ncontain the word “to marry.”[259] Mr. Hyde states that, in the Pacific\r\nIslands, there was an “utter absence of what we mean by the family,\r\nthe household, and the husband; the only thing possible was to keep\r\nthe line distinct through the mother, and enumerate the successive\r\ngenerations with the several putative fathers.”[260] Among the Nairs,\r\nas Buchanan tells us, no one knows his father, and every man looks on\r\nhis sister’s children as his heirs; a man may marry several women,\r\nand a woman may be the wife of several men.[261] The Teehurs of Oude\r\nlive together almost indiscriminately in large communities, and even\r\nwhen two people are regarded as married the tie is but nominal.[262]\r\nIt is recorded that, among the Tôttiyars of India, “brothers, uncles,\r\nnephews, and other kindred, hold their wives in common.”[263] And\r\namong the Todas of the Neilgherry Hills, when a man marries a girl,\r\nshe becomes the wife of all his brothers as they successively reach\r\nmanhood, and they become the husbands of all her sisters when they are\r\nold enough to marry.[264]\r\n\r\nThe Kámilarói tribes in South Australia are divided into four clans,\r\nin which brothers and sisters are respectively Ipai and Ipātha, Kŭbi\r\nand Kubĭtha, Mŭri and Mātha, Kumbu and Būtha. Ipai may only marry\r\nKubĭtha; Kŭbi, Ipātha; Kumbu, Mātha; and Mŭri, Būtha. In a certain\r\nsense, we are told, every Ipai is regarded as married, not by any\r\nindividual contract, but by organic law, to every Kubĭtha; every Kŭbi\r\nto every Ipātha, and so on. If, for instance, a Kŭbi “meet a stranger\r\nIpātha, they address each other as _spouse_. A Kŭbi thus meeting an\r\nIpātha, though she were of another tribe, would treat her as his\r\nwife, and his right to do so would be recognised by her tribe.”[265]\r\nThis institution, according to which the men of one division, have as\r\nwives the women of another division, the Rev. L. Fison calls “group\r\nmarriage.” He contends that, among the South Australians, it has given\r\nway in later times, in some measure, to individual marriage. But\r\ntheoretically, as he says, marriage is still communal: “it is based\r\nupon the marriage of all the males in one division of a tribe to all\r\nthe females of the same generation in another division.” To this may\r\nbe added a statement of the Rev. C. W. Schürmann with reference to the\r\nPort Lincoln aborigines. “As for near relatives, such as brothers,”\r\nhe remarks, “it may almost be said that they have their wives in\r\ncommon.... A peculiar nomenclature has arisen from these singular\r\nconnections; a woman honours the brothers of the man to whom she is\r\nmarried with the indiscriminate name of husbands; but the men make\r\na distinction, calling their own individual spouses yungaras, and\r\nthose to whom they have a secondary claim, by right of brotherhood,\r\nkartetis.”[266]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Fuegians, Admiral Fitzroy says, “We had some reason to\r\nthink there were parties who lived in a promiscuous manner—a few women\r\nbeing with many men.”[267] The Lubus of Sumatra, the Olo Ot, together\r\nwith a few other tribes of Borneo, the Poggi Islanders, the Orang Sakai\r\nof Malacca, and the mountaineers of Peling, east of Celebes, are by\r\nProfessor Wilken stated to be entirely without marriage.[268] The same\r\nis said by Professor Bastian to be the case with the Keriahs, Kurumbas,\r\nChittagong tribes, Guaycurûs, Kutchin Indians, and Arawaks.[269] He\r\nstates, too, that the Jolah on the island of St. Mary, according to\r\nHewett, possess their women in common,[270] and that, according to\r\nMagalhães, the like is true of the Cahyapos in Matto Grosso.[271] We\r\nread in Dapper’s old book on Africa, that certain negro tribes had\r\nneither law, nor religion, nor any proper names, and possessed their\r\nwives in common.[272] These are all the statements known to me of\r\npeoples alleged to be without marriage.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it must be remarked that some of the facts adduced\r\nare not really instances of promiscuity. Sir Edward Belcher’s statement\r\nas regards the Andamanese evidently suggests monogamy; and among the\r\nMassagetæ and the Teehurs, the occurrence of marriage is expressly\r\nconfirmed, though the marriage tie was loose. As for the aborigines\r\nof the Californian Peninsula, it must be remembered that the want of\r\nan equivalent for the verb “to marry” does not imply the want of\r\nthe fact itself. Baegert indicates, indeed, that marriage did occur\r\namong them, when he says that “each man took as many wives as he\r\nliked, and if there were several sisters in a family he married them\r\nall together.”[273] And throughout the Pacific Islands, marriage is\r\na recognized institution. Nowhere has debauchery been practised more\r\nextensively than among the Areois of Tahiti. Yet Mr. Ellis assures us\r\nthat, “although addicted to every kind of licentiousness themselves,\r\neach Arcoi had his own wife; ... and so jealous were they in this\r\nrespect that improper conduct towards the wife of one of their own\r\nnumber was sometimes punished with death.”[274]\r\n\r\nAs to the South Australians, Mr. Fison’s statements have caused not a\r\nlittle confusion. On his authority several writers assert that, among\r\nthe Australian savages, groups of males are actually found united to\r\ngroups of females.[275] But after all, Mr. Fison does not seem really\r\nto mean to affirm the present existence of group-marriages. The chief\r\nargument advanced by him in support of his theory is grounded on the\r\nterms of relationship in use in the tribes. These terms belong to the\r\n“classificatory system” of Mr. Morgan;[276] but Mr. Fison admits that\r\nhe is not aware of any tribe in which the actual practice is to its\r\nfull extent what the terms of relationship imply. “Present usage,”\r\nhe says, “is everywhere in advance of the system so implied, and the\r\nterms are survivals of an ancient right, not precise indications of\r\ncustom as it is.”[277] The same is granted by Mr. Howitt.[278] Yet it\r\nwill be pointed out further on to what absurd results we must be led,\r\nif, guided by such terms, we begin to speculate upon early marriage.\r\nMoreover, if a Kŭbi and an Ipātha address each other as spouse, this\r\ndoes not imply that in former times every Kŭbi was married to every\r\nIpātha indiscriminately. On the contrary, the application of such a\r\nfamiliar term might be explained from the fact that the women who may\r\nbe a man’s wives, and those who cannot possibly be so, stand in a\r\nwidely different relation to him.[279] It seems also as if a communism\r\nin wives among the Port Lincoln aborigines had been inferred by Mr.\r\nSchürmann chiefly from the nomenclature. Indeed, Mr. Curr, who has\r\nprocured more information regarding the Australian aborigines than\r\nany other investigator, so far as I know, states that, in Australia,\r\nmen and women have never been found living in a state of promiscuous\r\nintercourse, but _the reverse is a matter of notoriety_.[280] “It\r\nseems to me,” he says, “after a careful examination of the subject,\r\nthat there is not within our knowledge a single fact, or linguistic\r\nexpression which requires us to have recourse to the theory of\r\ngroup-marriage to explain it, but that there are several ... directly\r\nat variance with that theory.”[281] The Rev. John Mathew asserts also,\r\nin his recent paper on ‘The Australian Aborigines,’ that he fails to\r\nsee that group-marriage “has been proven to exist in the past, and it\r\ncertainly does not occur in Australia now.”[282] At any rate, it may be\r\nasserted that such group-marriages are different from the promiscuity\r\nwhich is presumed to have prevailed in primitive society. And this may\r\nwith even more reason be said of the marriages of the Tôttiyars, Nairs\r\nand Todas, of which at least those of the Todas have originated, I\r\nbelieve, in true polyandry.\r\n\r\nMany of the assertions made as to peoples living together promiscuously\r\nare evidently erroneous. Travellers are often apt to misapprehend the\r\nmanners and customs of the peoples they visit, and we should therefore,\r\nif possible, compare the statements of different writers, especially\r\nwhen so delicate and private a matter as the relation between the sexes\r\nis concerned. Sir Edward Belcher’s statement about the Andamanese has\r\nbeen disproved by Mr. Man, who, after a very careful investigation of\r\nthis people, says not only that they are strictly monogamous, but that\r\ndivorce is unknown, and conjugal fidelity till death not the exception\r\nbut the rule among them.[283] As regards the Bushmans, Sir John Lubbock\r\ndoes not indicate the source from which he has taken the statement\r\nthat they are “entirely without marriage;” all the authorities I have\r\nconsulted, unanimously assert the reverse. Burchell was told that even\r\na second wife is never taken until the first has become old, and that\r\nthe old wives remain with the husband on the same terms as before.[284]\r\nBarrow tells us almost the same.[285] Indeed, as we have already seen,\r\nthe family is the chief social institution of this people.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the Fuegians, Mr. Bridges, who has lived amongst\r\nthem for thirty years, writes to me, “Admiral Fitzroy’s supposition\r\nconcerning parties among the natives who lived promiscuously is false,\r\nand adultery and lewdness are condemned as evil, though through the\r\nstrength of animal passions very generally indulged, but never with\r\nthe consent of husbands or wives, or of parents.” From the description\r\nof Captain Jacobsen’s recent voyage to the North-Western Coast of\r\nNorth America, it appears that marriage exists among the Queen\r\nCharlotte Islanders also, although the husbands often prostitute their\r\nwives.[286] As for Professor Wilken’s statements about promiscuity\r\namong some peoples belonging to the Malay race, Professor Ratzel calls\r\ntheir accuracy in question. At least, among the Lubus, as Herr Van\r\nOphuijsen assures us, a man has to buy his wife, just as among the\r\nother Malay peoples;[287] and Dr. Schwaner expressly says that all that\r\nwe know about the Olo Ot depends on hearsay only.[288] But, according\r\nto him, they are not without marriage.[289]\r\n\r\nSome of Professor Bastian’s assertions are most astonishing. Any one\r\nwho takes the trouble to read Richardson’s, Kirby’s, or Bancroft’s\r\naccount of the Kutchin, will find that polygyny, but not promiscuity,\r\nis prevalent among them, the husbands being very jealous of their\r\nwives.[290] The same is stated by v. Martius about the Arawaks, whose\r\nblood-feuds are generally owing to jealousy and a desire to avenge\r\nviolations of conjugal rights.[291] The occurrence of marriage among\r\nthem has also been ascertained by Schomburgk and the Rev. W. H.\r\nBrett.[292] The Guaycurûs are said by Lozano to be monogamous,[293]\r\nand so, according to Captain Lewin, are as a rule the Chittagong Hill\r\ntribes, as we shall find later on. Touching the Keriahs, Colonel Dalton\r\naffirms only that they have no word for marriage in their own language,\r\nbut he does not deny that marriage itself occurs among them; on the\r\ncontrary, it appears that they buy their wives.[294] The Kurumbas\r\nare stated to be without the marriage ceremony, but not without\r\nmarriage.[295] And Dapper’s assertion that certain negro tribes have\r\ntheir women in common, has never, so far as I know, been confirmed by\r\nmore recent writers. Dr. Post has found no people in Africa living in\r\na state of promiscuity;[296] and Mr. Ingham informs me, speaking of\r\nthe Bakongo, that “they would be horrified at the idea of promiscuous\r\nintercourse.”\r\n\r\nThe peoples who may possibly live in a state of promiscuity have thus\r\nbeen reduced to a very small number. Considering the erroneousness of\r\nso many of the statements on the subject, it is difficult to believe in\r\nthe accuracy of the others.[297] Ethnography was not seriously studied\r\nby the ancients, and their knowledge of the African tribes was no doubt\r\nvery deficient. Pliny, in the same chapter where he states that, among\r\nthe Garamantians, men and women lived in promiscuous intercourse,\r\nreports of another African tribe, the Blemmyans, that they had no head,\r\nand that the mouth and eyes were in the breast.[298] Besides, marriage\r\nis an ambiguous word. The looseness of the marital tie, the frequency\r\nof adultery and divorce, and the absence of the marriage ceremony may\r\nentitle us to say that, among many savage peoples, marriage in the\r\nEuropean sense of the term does not exist. But this is very different\r\nfrom promiscuity.\r\n\r\nEven if some of the statements are right, and the intercourse between\r\nthe sexes among a few peoples really is, or has been, promiscuous,\r\nit would be a mistake to infer that these utterly exceptional cases\r\nrepresent a stage of human development which mankind, as a whole,\r\nhas gone through. Further, nothing would entitle us to consider\r\nthis promiscuity as a survival of the primitive life of man, or\r\neven as a mark of a very rude state of society. It is by no means\r\namong the lowest peoples that sexual relations most nearly approach\r\nto promiscuity. Mr. Rowney, for instance, states that, among the\r\nButias, the marriage tie is so loose that chastity is quite unknown,\r\nthat the husbands are indifferent to the honour of their wives, that\r\n“the intercourse of the sexes is, in fact, promiscuous.” But the\r\nButias are followers of Buddha, and “can hardly be counted among\r\nthe _wild_ tribes of India, for they are, for the most part, in\r\ngood circumstances, and have a certain amount of civilization among\r\nthem.”[299] On the other hand, among the lowest races on earth, as\r\nthe Veddahs, Fuegians, and Australians, the relation of the sexes are\r\nof a much more definite character. The Veddahs are a truly monogamous\r\npeople, and have a saying that “death alone separates husband and\r\nwife.”[300] And with reference to the Australians, Mr. Brough Smyth,\r\nstates that “though the marriages of Aboriginals are not solemnized\r\nby any rites, ... it must not be supposed that, as a rule, there is\r\nanything like promiscuous intercourse. When a man obtains a good wife,\r\nhe keeps her as a precious possession, as long as she is fit to help\r\nhim, and minister to his wants, and increase his happiness. No other\r\nman must look with affection towards her.... Promiscuous intercourse is\r\nabhorrent to many of them.” Among the aborigines of the northern and\r\ncentral parts of Australia, there are certainly women wholly given up\r\nto common lewdness, and a man is said to be considered a bad host who\r\nwill not lend his wife to a guest. But Mr. Brough Smyth thinks that\r\nthese practices are modern, and have been acquired since the aborigines\r\nwere brought in contact with the lower class of the whites, for “they\r\nare altogether irreconcilable with the penal laws in force in former\r\ntimes amongst the natives of Victoria.”[301] It seems obvious, then,\r\nthat even if there are peoples who actually live promiscuously, these\r\ndo not afford any evidence whatever for promiscuity having prevailed\r\nin primitive times. Now let us examine whether the other arguments are\r\nmore convincing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“A further fact,” Dr. Post says, “which speaks for sexual intercourse\r\nhaving originally been unchecked, is the wide-spread custom that the\r\nsexes may cohabit perfectly freely previous to marriage.”[302]\r\n\r\nThe immorality of many savages is certainly very great, but we must\r\nnot believe that it is characteristic of uncivilized races in general.\r\nThere are numerous savage and barbarous peoples among whom sexual\r\nintercourse out of wedlock is of rare occurrence, unchastity, at least\r\non the part of the woman, being looked upon as a disgrace and even as a\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\n“A Kafir woman,” Barrow says, “is chaste and extremely modest;”[303]\r\nand Mr. Cousins writes to me that, between their various feasts,\r\nthe Kafirs, both men and women, have to live in strict continence,\r\nthe penalty being banishment from the tribe, if this law is broken.\r\nProyart states that, among the people of Loango, “a youth durst not\r\nspeak to a girl except in her mother’s presence,” and “the crime of\r\na maid who has not resisted seduction, would be sufficient to draw\r\ndown a total ruin on the whole country, were it not expiated by a\r\npublic avowal made to the king.”[304] Among the Equatorial Africans,\r\nmentioned by Mr. Winwood Reade, a girl who disgraces her family by\r\nwantonness is banished from her clan; and, in cases of seduction, the\r\nman is severely flogged.[305] In Dahomey, if a man seduces a girl,\r\nthe law compels marriage, and the payment of eighty cowries to the\r\nparent or master.[306] In Tessaua, according to Dr. Barth, a fine\r\nof 100,000 kurdi is imposed on the father of a bastard child—a sum\r\nwhich indicates how seldom such children are born there.[307] Among\r\nthe Beni-Mzab, a man who seduces a young girl has to pay two hundred\r\nfrancs, and is banished for four years.[308] Among the Beni-Amer,\r\naccording to Munzinger, the unmarried women are very modest, though\r\nthe married women believe that they are allowed everything.[309] Among\r\nthe Arab girls in Upper Egypt, unchastity is made impossible by an\r\noperation when they are from three to five years old;[310] and among\r\nthe Marea, continence is a scarcely less necessary virtue, as a maiden\r\nor widow who becomes pregnant is killed together with the seducer and\r\nthe child.[311] As regards the Kabyles, Messrs. Hanoteau and Letourneux\r\nassert, “Les mœurs ne tolèrent même aucune relation sexuelle en dehors\r\ndu mariage.... L’enfant né en dehors du mariage est tué ainsi que sa\r\nmère.”[312]\r\n\r\nAmong the Central Asian Turks, according to Vámbéry, a fallen girl is\r\nunknown.[313] Among the Kalmucks,[314] as also the Gypsies,[315] the\r\ngirls take pride in having gallant affairs, but are dishonoured if\r\nthey have children previous to marriage. A seducer among the Tunguses\r\nis bound to marry his victim and pay the price claimed for her.[316]\r\nIn Circassia, an incontinent daughter is generally sold as soon as\r\npossible, being a disgrace to her parents.[317] Among the wretched\r\ninhabitants of Lob-nor, “immorality is severely punished.”[318] And\r\nregarding the Let-htas, a Hill Tribe of Burma, Mr. O’Riley states that,\r\nuntil married, the youth of both sexes are domiciled in two long houses\r\nat opposite ends of the village, and “when they may have occasion\r\nto pass each other, they avert their gaze, so they may not see each\r\nother’s faces.”[319]\r\n\r\nAs to the aborigines of the Indian Archipelago, Professor Wilken states\r\nthat side by side with peoples who indulge in great licentiousness,\r\nthere are others who are remarkably chaste. Thus, in Nias, the\r\npregnancy of an unmarried girl is punished with death, inflicted\r\nnot only upon her but upon the seducer.[320] Among the Hill Dyaks,\r\nthe young men are carefully separated from the girls, licentious\r\nconnections between the sexes being strictly prohibited;[321] and\r\nthe Sibuyaus, a tribe belonging to the Sea Dyaks, though they do not\r\nconsider the sexual intercourse of their young people a positive crime,\r\nyet attach an idea of great indecency to irregular connections, and are\r\nof opinion that an unmarried woman with child must be offensive to the\r\nsuperior powers.[322]\r\n\r\nBy some of the independent tribes of the Philippines also, according\r\nto Chamisso, chastity is held in great honour, “not only among the\r\nwomen, but also among the young girls, and is protected by very severe\r\nlaws;”[323]—a statement which is confirmed by Dr. Hans Meyer and\r\nProfessor Blumentritt with reference to the Igorrotes of Luzon.[324]\r\n\r\nIn New Guinea, too, chastity is strictly maintained.[325] Mr. G.\r\nA. Robinson and the Catechist Clark, who lived for years with the\r\naborigines, both declare their belief in the virtue of the young\r\nwomen;[326] and Dr. Finsch assures us that the natives of Dory are,\r\nin that respect, superior to many civilized nations in Europe.[327]\r\nThe French naturalists and some English writers spoke highly of the\r\nmorality of the young people among the Tasmanians.[328] The women of\r\nUea, Loyalty Islands, are described by Erskine as “strictly chaste\r\nbefore marriage, and faithful wives afterwards.”[329] In Fiji, great\r\ncontinence prevailed among the young folk, the lads being forbidden to\r\napproach women till eighteen or twenty years old.[330] Speaking of the\r\naborigines of Melanesia, Dr. Codrington remarks, “It is certain that\r\nin these islands generally there was by no means that insensibility\r\nin regard to female virtue with which the natives are so commonly\r\ncharged.”[331] In Samoa, the girls were allowed to cohabit with\r\nforeigners, but not with their countrymen,[332] and the chastity of the\r\nchiefs’ daughters was the pride of the tribe. But Mr. Turner remarks\r\nthat, though this virtue was ostensibly cultivated here by both sexes,\r\nit was more a name than a reality.[333]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the Australian natives, Mr. Moore Davis says,\r\n“Promiscuous intercourse between the sexes is not practised by the\r\nAborigines, and their laws on the subject, particularly those of New\r\nSouth Wales, are very strict. When at camp, all the young unmarried\r\nmen are stationed by themselves at the extreme ends, while the married\r\nmen, each with his family, occupy the centre. No conversation is\r\nallowed between the single men and the girls or the married women....\r\nInfractions of these and other laws were visited either by punishment\r\nby any aggrieved member of the tribe, or by the delinquent having\r\nto purge himself of his crime by standing up protected simply by\r\nhis shield, or a waddy, while five or six warriors threw, from a\r\ncomparatively short distance, several spears at him.”[334] Concerning\r\nseveral tribes in Western Victoria, Mr. Dawson likewise states that,\r\nat the corroborees and great meetings of the tribes, unmarried adults\r\nof both sexes are kept strictly apart from those of another tribe.\r\n“Illegitimacy is rare,” he says, “and is looked upon with such\r\nabhorrence that the mother is always severely beaten by her relatives,\r\nand sometimes put to death and burned. Her child is occasionally killed\r\nand burned with her. The father of the child is also punished with the\r\ngreatest severity, and occasionally killed.”[335]\r\n\r\nTurning to the American peoples: among the early Aleuts, according to\r\nVeniaminof, “girls or unmarried females who gave birth to illegitimate\r\nchildren were to be killed for shame, and hidden.”[336] Egede tells us\r\nthat, among the Greenlanders, unmarried women observed the rules of\r\nmodesty much better than married women. “During fifteen full years\r\nthat I lived in Greenland,” he says, “I did not hear of more than two\r\nor three young women, who were gotten with child unmarried; because\r\nit is reckoned the greatest of infamies.”[337] According to Cranz, a\r\nGreenland maid would take it as an affront were a young fellow even to\r\noffer her a pinch of snuff in company.[338] Among the Northern Indians,\r\ngirls are from the early age of eight or nine years prohibited by\r\ncustom from joining in the most innocent amusements with children of\r\nthe opposite sex. “When sitting in their tent,” says Hearne, “or even\r\nwhen travelling, they are watched and guarded with such an unremitting\r\nattention as cannot be exceeded by the most rigid discipline of an\r\nEnglish boarding-school.”[339] Mr. Catlin asserts that, among the\r\nMandans, female virtue is, in the respectable families, as highly\r\ncherished as in any society whatever.[340] Among the Nez Percés,[341]\r\nthe Apaches,[342] and certain other North American peoples,[343] the\r\nwomen are described as remarkably chaste, the seducer being viewed by\r\nsome of them with even more contempt than the girl he has dishonoured.\r\nAnd Dobrizhoffer praises the Abiponian women for their virtuous\r\nlife.[344]\r\n\r\nIf we add to these facts those which will be adduced further on,\r\nshowing what man requires in his bride, it must be admitted that\r\nthe number of uncivilized peoples among whom chastity, at least as\r\nregards women, is held in honour and, as a rule, cultivated, is very\r\nconsiderable. There being nothing to indicate that the morality of\r\nthose nations ever was laxer, the inference of an earlier stage of\r\npromiscuity from the irregular sexual relations of unmarried people,\r\ncould not apply to them, even if such an inference, on the whole,\r\nwere right. But this is far from being the case: first, because the\r\nwantonness of savages, in several cases, seems to be due chiefly to the\r\ninfluence of civilization; secondly, because it is quite different from\r\npromiscuity.\r\n\r\nIt has been sufficiently proved that contact with a higher culture,\r\nor, more properly, the dregs of it, is pernicious to the morality of\r\npeoples living in a more or less primitive condition. In Greenland,\r\nsays Dr. Nansen, “the Eskimo women of the larger colonies are far\r\nfreer in their ways than those of the small outlying settlements where\r\nthere are no Europeans.”[345] And the Yokuts of California, amongst\r\nwhom the freedom of the unmarried people of both sexes is very great\r\nnow, are said to have been comparatively virtuous before the arrival\r\nof the Americans.[346] In British Columbia and Vancouver Island,\r\n“amongst the interior tribes, in primitive times, breaches of chastity\r\non the part either of married or unmarried females were often punished\r\nwith death, inflicted either by the brother or husband;” whilst, among\r\nthe fish-eaters of the north-west coast, “it has no meaning, or, if\r\nit has, it appears to be utterly disregarded.”[347] Again, among the\r\nQueen Charlotte Islanders the present depravation has, according to\r\nCaptain Jacobsen been caused by the gold diggers who went there in the\r\nmiddle of this century.[348] Admiral Fitzroy observed, too, that the\r\nunchastity of the Patagonian women did not correspond with the pure\r\ncharacter attributed to them at an earlier time by Falkner, and he\r\nthinks that “their ideas of propriety may have been altered by the\r\nvisits of licentious strangers.”[349] A more recent traveller, Captain\r\nMusters, observed, indeed, little immorality amongst the Indians whilst\r\nin their native wilds.[350]\r\n\r\nThere is, further, no doubt that the licentiousness of many South\r\nSea Islanders, at least to some extent, owes its origin to their\r\nintercourse with Europeans. When visiting the Sandwich Islands with\r\nCook, Vancouver saw little or no appearance of wantonness among the\r\nwomen. But when he visited them some years afterwards, it was very\r\nconspicuous; and he ascribes this change in their habits to their\r\nintercourse with foreigners.[351] Owing to the same influence, the\r\nwomen of Ponapé and Tana lost their modesty;[352] and the privileges\r\ngranted to foreigners in Samoa have been already mentioned. Nay, even\r\nin Tahiti, so notorious for the licentiousness of its inhabitants,\r\nimmorality was formerly less than it is now. Thus, as a girl, betrothed\r\nwhen a child, grew up, “for the preservation of her chastity, a small\r\nplatform of considerable elevation was erected for her abode within the\r\ndwelling of her parents. Here she slept and spent the whole of the time\r\nshe passed within doors. Her parents, or some member of the family,\r\nattended her by night and by day, supplied her with every necessary,\r\nand accompanied her whenever she left the house. Some of their\r\ntraditions,” Ellis adds, “warrant the inference that this mode of\r\nlife, in early years, was observed by other females besides those who\r\nwere betrothed.”[353]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the tribes who once inhabited the Adelaide Plains of South\r\nAustralia, Mr. Edward Stephens, who went to Australia about half a\r\ncentury ago, remarks, “Those who speak of the natives as a naturally\r\ndegraded race, either do not speak from experience, or they judge them\r\nby what they have become when the abuse of intoxicants and contact with\r\nthe most wicked of the white race have begun their deadly work. As a\r\nrule, to which there are no exceptions, if a tribe of blacks is found\r\naway from the white settlement, the more vicious of the white men are\r\nmost anxious to make the acquaintance of the natives, and that, too,\r\nsolely for purposes of immorality.... I saw the natives and was much\r\nwith them before those dreadful immoralities were well known, ... and I\r\nsay it fearlessly, that nearly all their evils they owed to the white\r\nman’s immorality and to the white man’s drink.”[354]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. J. Sibree tells us that, among most of the tribes of\r\nMadagascar, the unchastity of girls does not give umbrage. But “there\r\nare some other tribes,” he says, “more isolated, as certain of the\r\neastern peoples, where a higher standard of morality prevails, girls\r\nbeing kept scrupulously from any intercourse with the other sex until\r\nthey are married.”[355]\r\n\r\nNowhere has chastity been more rigorously insisted upon than among the\r\nSouth Slavonians. A fallen girl among them has lost almost all chance\r\nof getting married. She is commonly despised and often punished in a\r\nvery barbarous way; whilst, on the other hand, purity gives a girl a\r\nhigher value than the greatest wealth. In some places, a father or a\r\nbrother may even kill a man whom he finds with his daughter or sister.\r\nBut Dr. Krauss assures us that this rigidity in their morals has\r\ngradually decreased, the more foreign civilization has got a footing\r\namong them.[356]\r\n\r\nAgain, Professor Ahlqvist believes that illicit intercourse between the\r\nsexes was almost unknown among the ancient Finns, as the terms used\r\nby them with reference to such connections are borrowed from other\r\nlanguages.[357] And Professor Vámbéry makes the same observation as\r\nregards the primitive Turko-Tartars. “The difference in morality,”\r\nhe says, “which exists between the Turks affected by a foreign\r\ncivilization and kindred tribes inhabiting the steppes, becomes very\r\nconspicuous to any one living among the Turkomans and Kara-Kalpaks; for\r\nwhether in Africa or Asia, certain vices are introduced only by the\r\nso-called bearers of culture.”[358]\r\n\r\nApart from such cases of foreign influence, we may perhaps say that\r\nirregular connections between the sexes have on the whole exhibited\r\na tendency to increase along with the progress of civilization. Dr.\r\nFritsch remarks that the Bushmans are much stricter in that matter\r\nthan their far more advanced neighbours.[359] Robert Drury assures\r\nus that, in Madagascar, “there are more modest women, in proportion\r\nto the number of people, than in England.”[360] Tacitus praised the\r\nchastity of the Germanic youth, in contrast to the licentiousness of\r\nthe highly civilized Romans. These statements may to a certain extent\r\nbe considered typical. In Europe, there are born among towns-people, on\r\nan average, twice as many bastard children, in proportion to the number\r\nof births, as among the inhabitants of the country, who generally\r\nlead a more natural life. In France, according to Wappäus, the ratio\r\nwas found even so great as 15·13 to 4·24; though in Saxony, with its\r\nmanufacturing country people, it was only as 15·39 to 14·64.[361] Nay,\r\nin Gratz and Munich the illegitimate births are even more numerous\r\nthan the legitimate.[362] The prostitution of the towns makes the\r\ndifference in morality still greater; and unfortunately the evil is\r\ngrowing. Almost everywhere prostitution increases in a higher ratio\r\nthan population.[363] In consideration of these facts, it is almost\r\nridiculous to speak of the immorality of unmarried people among savages\r\nas a relic of an alleged primitive stage of promiscuity.\r\n\r\nThere are several factors in civilization which account for this bad\r\nresult. The more unnatural mode of living and the greater number of\r\nexcitements exercise, no doubt, a deteriorating influence on morality;\r\nand poverty makes prostitutes of many girls who are little more than\r\nchildren. But the chief factor is the growing number of unmarried\r\npeople. It is proved that, in the cities of Europe, prostitution\r\nincreases according as the number of marriages decreases.[364] It has\r\nalso been established, thanks to the statistical investigations of\r\nEngel and others, that the fewer the marriages contracted in a year,\r\nthe greater is the ratio of illegitimate births.[365] Thus, by making\r\ncelibacy more common, civilization promotes sexual irregularity. It\r\nis true that more elevated moral feelings, concomitants of a higher\r\nmental development, may, to a certain extent, put the drag on passion.\r\nBut in a savage condition of life, where every full-grown man marries\r\nas soon as possible; where almost every girl, when she reaches the age\r\nof puberty, is given in marriage; where, consequently, bachelors and\r\nspinsters are of rare occurrence,—there is comparatively little reason\r\nfor illegitimate relations.[366] Marriage, it seems to me, is the\r\nnatural form of the sexual relations of man, as of his nearest allies\r\namong the lower animals. Far from being a relic of the primitive life\r\nof man, irregularity in this respect is an anomaly arising chiefly from\r\ncircumstances associated with certain stages of human development.\r\n\r\nDr. Post’s argument, as I have said, is open to another objection. Free\r\nsexual intercourse previous to marriage is quite a different thing\r\nfrom promiscuity, the most genuine form of which is prostitution. But\r\nprostitution is rare among peoples living in a state of nature and\r\nunaffected by foreign influence.[367] It is contrary to woman’s natural\r\nfeelings as involving a suppression of individual inclinations. In free\r\nsexual intercourse there is selection; a woman has for one man, or for\r\nseveral men, a preference which generally makes the connections more\r\ndurable.\r\n\r\nNowhere are unmarried people of both sexes less restrained than among\r\nthe savage nations of India and Indo-China. Yet among these savage\r\nnations there is no promiscuity. Among the Toungtha, for instance,\r\naccording to Captain Lewin, prostitution is not understood, and, when\r\nexplained, it is regarded by them with abhorrence. “They draw rightly\r\na strong distinction between a woman prostituting herself habitually\r\nas a means of livelihood, and the intercourse by mutual consent of\r\ntwo members of opposite sexes, leading, as it generally does, to\r\nmarriage.”[368] Among the Tipperahs,[369] Oráons,[370] and Kolyas[371],\r\nunmarried girls may cohabit freely with young men, but are never found\r\nliving promiscuously with them. Among the Dyaks on the Batang Lupar,\r\ntoo, unchastity is not rare, but a woman usually confines herself\r\nto one lover. “Should the girl prove with child,” says Sir Spenser\r\nSt. John, “it is an understanding between them that they marry”;\r\nand the men seldom, by denying the paternity, refuse to fulfil their\r\nengagements.[372] Again, in Tonga, it was considered disgraceful for a\r\ngirl to change lovers often. And in Scotland, prior to the Reformation,\r\nthere was a practice called “hand-fasting,” which certainly may be\r\ncharacterized as unrestrained freedom before marriage, but not as\r\npromiscuity. “At the public fairs,” the Rev. Ch. Rogers states, “men\r\nselected female companions with whom to cohabit for a year. At the\r\nexpiry of this period both parties were accounted free; they might\r\neither unite in marriage or live singly.”[373]\r\n\r\nThe attempt to explain free intercourse between unmarried people as\r\na relic of a primitive condition of general promiscuity or rather,\r\nto infer the latter from the former, must thus, in every respect, be\r\nconsidered a complete failure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir John Lubbock thinks that his hypothesis of “communal marriage”\r\nderives additional support from some curious customs, which he\r\ninterprets as acts of expiation for individual marriage. “In many\r\ncases,” he says, “the exclusive possession of a wife could only\r\nbe legally acquired by a temporary recognition of the pre-existing\r\ncommunal rights.”[374]\r\n\r\nThus Herodotus states that, in Babylonia, every woman was obliged once\r\nin her life to give herself up, in the temple of Mylitta, to strangers,\r\nfor the satisfaction of the goddess; and in some parts of Cyprus, he\r\ntells us, the same custom prevailed.[375] In Armenia, according to\r\nStrabo, there was a very similar law. The daughters of good families\r\nwere consecrated to Anaitis, a phallic divinity like Mylitta,\r\ngiving themselves, as it appears, to the worshippers of the goddess\r\nindiscriminately.[376] Again, in the valleys of the Ganges, virgins\r\nwere compelled before marriage to offer themselves up in the temples\r\ndedicated to Juggernaut. And the same is said to have been customary in\r\nPondicherry and at Goa.[377]\r\n\r\nThese practices, however, evidently belong to phallic-worship,\r\nand occurred, as Mr. McLennan justly remarks, among peoples who\r\nhad advanced far beyond the primitive state. The farther back we\r\ngo, the less we find of such customs in India; “the germ only of\r\nphallic-worship shows itself in the Vedas, and the gross luxuriance\r\nof licentiousness, of which the cases referred to are examples, is of\r\nlater growth.”[378]\r\n\r\nAncient writers tell us that, among the Nasamonians and Augilæ,\r\ntwo Libyan tribes, the _jus primae noctis_ was accorded to all the\r\nguests at a marriage.[379] Garcilasso de la Vega asserts that, in\r\nthe province Manta in Peru, marriages took place on condition that\r\nthe bride should first yield herself to the relatives and friends of\r\nthe bridegroom.[380] In the Balearic Islands, according to Diodorous\r\nSiculus, the bride was for one night considered the common property\r\nof all the guests, after which she belonged exclusively to her\r\nhusband.[381] And v. Langsdorf reports the occurrence of a very similar\r\npractice in Nukahiva.[382]\r\n\r\nWith regard to Sir J. Lubbock’s interpretation of these customs,\r\nas acts of expiation for individual marriage, Mr. McLennan remarks\r\nthat they are not cases of privileges accorded to the men of the\r\nbridegroom’s group only, which they should be, if they refer to an\r\nancient communal right.[383] It may also be noted that, in Nukahiva,\r\nthe license was dependent upon the will of the bride. Moreover, the\r\nfreedom granted to the wedding guests may be simply and naturally\r\nexplained. It may have been a part of the nuptial entertainment—a\r\nhorrible kind of hospitality, no doubt, but quite in accordance with\r\nsavage ideas, and analogous to another custom, which occurs much more\r\nfrequently; I mean the practice of lending wives.\r\n\r\nAmong many uncivilized peoples, it is customary for a man to offer his\r\nwife, or one of his wives, to strangers for the time they stay in his\r\nhut. Even this practice has been adduced by several writers as evidence\r\nof a former communism.[384] To Sir John Lubbock it seems to involve the\r\nrecognition of “a right inherent in every member of the community, and\r\nto visitors as temporary members.” Were this so, we should certainly\r\nhave to conclude that “communal marriage” has been very prevalent in\r\nthe human race, the practice of lending wives occurring among many\r\npeoples in different parts of the world.[385] But it is difficult to\r\nsee how the practice could ever have been in any way connected with\r\ncommunism in women for all men belonging to the same tribe. It is\r\nnot always the wife that is offered; it may as well be a daughter, a\r\nsister, or a servant.[386] Thus the people of Madagascar warn strangers\r\nto behave with decency to their wives, though they readily offer their\r\ndaughters;[387] and it is asserted that a Tungus “will give his\r\ndaughter for a time to any friend or traveller that he takes a liking\r\nto,” and if he has no daughter, he will give his servant, but not his\r\nwives.[388]\r\n\r\nIt can scarcely be doubted that such customs are due merely to savage\r\nideas of hospitality. When we are told that, among the coast tribes\r\nof British Columbia, “the temporary present of a wife is one of the\r\ngreatest honours that can be shown there to a guest;”[389] or that\r\nsuch an offer was considered by the Eskimo “as an act of generous\r\nhospitality;”[390] or, that “this is the common custom when the\r\nnegroes wish to pay respect to their guests,”[391]—I cannot see why we\r\nshould look for a deeper meaning in these practices than that which\r\nthe words imply. A man offers a visitor his wife as he offers him a\r\nseat at his table. It is the greatest honour a savage can show his\r\nguest, as a temporary exchange of wives—a custom prevalent in North\r\nAmerica, Polynesia, and elsewhere[392]—is regarded as a seal of the\r\nmost intimate friendship. Hence, among the Greenlanders, those men\r\nwere reputed the best and noblest tempered, who, without any pain or\r\nreluctance, would lend their friends their wives:[393] and the men of\r\nCaindu, a region of Eastern Tibet, hoped by such an offering to obtain\r\nthe favour of the gods.[394] Indeed, if the practice of lending wives\r\nis to be regarded as a relic of ancient communism in women, we may\r\nequally well regard the practice of giving presents to friends, or\r\nhospitality in other respects, as a remnant of ancient communism in\r\nproperty of every kind.\r\n\r\nThe _jus primae noctis_ granted to the friends of the bridegroom may,\r\nhowever, be derived from another source. Touching the capture of wives,\r\nMr. Brough Smyth states that, in New South Wales and about Riverina,\r\n“in any instance where the abduction has taken place by a party of\r\nmen for the benefit of some one individual, each of the members of the\r\nparty claims, as a right, a privilege which the intended husband has\r\nno power to refuse.”[395] A similar custom prevails, according to Mr.\r\nJohnston, among the Wa-taïta in Eastern Central Africa, though the\r\ncapture here is a symbol only. After the girl has been bought by the\r\nbridegroom, she runs away and affects to hide. Then she is sought out\r\nby him and three or four of his friends. When she is found, the men\r\nseize her and carry her off to the hut of her future husband, where she\r\nis placed at the disposal of her captors.[396] In such cases the _jus\r\nprimae noctis_ is a reward for a good turn done, or perhaps, as Mr.\r\nMcLennan suggests,[397] a common war-right, exercised by the captors\r\nof the woman. If we knew all the circumstances, this explanation\r\nmight prove to hold good also with regard to the right granted to the\r\nwedding-guests in the cases we have mentioned. At any rate, it must\r\nbe admitted that these strange customs may be interpreted in a much\r\nsimpler way than that suggested by Sir John Lubbock.\r\n\r\nThere are some instances of _jus primae noctis_ accorded to\r\na particular person, a chief or a priest. Thus, among the\r\nKinipetu-Eskimo, the Ankut, or high-priest has this right.[398] Among\r\nthe Caribs, the bridegroom received his bride from the hand of the\r\nPiache, or medicine-man, and certainly not as a virgin.[399] A similar\r\ncustom is met with among certain Brazilian tribes, though in some of\r\nthese cases it is to the chief that the right in question belongs.[400]\r\nThe Spanish nobleman Andagova states that, in Nicaragua, a priest\r\nliving in the temple was with the bride during the night preceding her\r\nmarriage.[401] And among the Tahus in Northern Mexico according to\r\nCastañeda, the _droit du seigneur_ was accorded to the cacique.[402]\r\n\r\nIn descriptions of travel in the fifteenth century, the aboriginal\r\ninhabitants of Teneriffe are represented as having married no woman who\r\nhad not previously spent a night with the chief, which was considered\r\na great honour.[403] The same right, according to Dr. Barth, was\r\npresumably granted to the chief of Bagele in Adamáua;[404] and,\r\naccording to Herodotus, to the king of the ancient Adyrmachidae.[405]\r\nNavarette tells us that, on the coast of Malabar, the bridegroom\r\nbrought the bride to the king, who kept her eight days in his palace;\r\nand the man took it “as a great honour and favour that his king would\r\nmake use of her.”[406] Again, according to Hamilton, a Samorin could\r\nnot take his bride home for three nights, during which the chief priest\r\nhad a claim to her company.[407] Sugenheim believes even that, in\r\ncertain parts of France, a similar right was accorded to the higher\r\nclergy during the Middle Ages.[408]\r\n\r\nYet Dr. Karl Schmidt has endeavoured, in a learned work, to prove that\r\nthe _droit du siegneur_ never existed in Europe, the later belief in it\r\nbeing merely “ein gelehrter Aberglaube,” which arose in various ways.\r\nThus there was classical witness to ancient traditions of tyrants, who\r\nhad distinguished themselves by such proceedings as that right was\r\nsupposed to legalize. From various parts of the world came reports of\r\ntravellers as to tribes among whom defloration was the privilege or\r\nduty of kings, priests, or other persons set apart for the purpose.\r\nA grosser meaning than the words will warrant had, besides, in Dr.\r\nSchmidt’s opinion, been attached to the fine paid by the vassal to\r\nhis feudal lord for permission to marry. That law, he says, which is\r\nbelieved to have extended over a large part of Europe, has left no\r\nevidence of its existence in laws, charters, decretals, trials, or\r\nglossaries.[409]\r\n\r\nThis is not the proper place to discuss Dr. Schmidt’s hypothesis; but\r\nhis arguments do not seem to be conclusive.[410] Several writers speak\r\nof estate-owners in Russia who claimed the _droit du seigneur_ in the\r\nlast and even the present century;[411] and a friend of mine informs me\r\nthat, when travelling in that country, he met with aged men whose wives\r\nhad been victims of the custom. It was certainly a privilege taken by\r\nthe law of might. But how in such cases shall we draw the line between\r\nmight and what is properly accepted as right?\r\n\r\nBachofen, Giraud-Teulon, Kulischer, and other writers[412] regard the\r\n_jus primae noctis_ accorded to a special person, as a remnant of a\r\nprimitive state of promiscuity or “communal marriage.” It is, in\r\ntheir opinion, a transformation of the ancient communal right, which\r\nwas taken away from the community and transferred to those who chiefly\r\nrepresented it—the priest, the king, or the nobility.\r\n\r\nBut why may not the practice in question have been simply a consequence\r\nof might? It may be a right taken forcibly by the stronger, or it\r\nmay be a privilege voluntarily given to the chief man as a mark of\r\nesteem,—in either case, it depends upon his authority. Indeed, the\r\nright of encroaching upon the marital rights of a subject is not\r\ncommonly restricted to the first night only. Where the chief or the\r\nking has the power of life and death, what man can prohibit him from\r\ndoing his will? “Quite indisputed,” Dr. Holub says, with reference to\r\nthe Marutse, “is the king’s power to put to death, or to make a slave\r\nof any one of his subjects in any way he choses; he may take a man’s\r\nwife simply by providing him with another wife as a substitute.”[413]\r\nIn Dahomey, all women belong to the king, who causes every girl to\r\nbe brought to him before marriage, and, if he pleases, retains her\r\nin the palace.[414] Among the Negroes in Fida, according to Bosman,\r\nthe captains of the king, who have to supply him with fresh wives,\r\nimmediately present to him any beautiful virgin they may see; and none\r\nof his subjects dare presume to offer objections.[415] In Persia, it\r\nwas a legal principle that whatever was touched by the king remained\r\nimmaculate, and that he might go into the harem of any of his\r\nsubjects.[416] Among the Kukis, “all the women of the village, married\r\nor single, are at the pleasure of the rajah,” who is regarded by his\r\npeople with almost superstitious veneration.[417] The Kalmuck priests,\r\nwho are not suffered to marry, may, it is said, pass a night with any\r\nman’s wife, and this is esteemed a favour by the husband.[418] And\r\nin Chamba (probably Cochin China), Marco Polo tells us, no woman was\r\nallowed to marry until the king had seen her.[419]\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Zimmermann, it is a dogma among many Malays that\r\nthe rajah has the entire disposal of the wives and children of his\r\nsubjects.[420] In New Zealand, when a chief desires to take to himself\r\na wife, he fixes his attention upon one and takes her, if need be by\r\nforce, without consulting her feelings and wishes, or those of any one\r\nelse.[421] In Tonga, the women of the lower people were at the disposal\r\nof the chiefs, who even used to shoot the husbands, if they made\r\nresistance;[422] whilst in Congo, as we are told by Mr. Reade, when the\r\nking takes a fresh concubine, her husband and all her lovers are put to\r\ndeath.[423]\r\n\r\nIn the interesting ‘Notes of a Country Clergyman’ in _Russkaja\r\nStariná_ (‘Russian Antiquity’), much light is thrown on the life of\r\nRussian landlords before the emancipation of the serfs. Here is what is\r\nsaid of one of them:—“Often N. I—tsch would stroll late in the evening\r\nabout his village to admire the prosperous condition of his peasants;\r\nhe would stop at some cottage, look in at the window, and tap on the\r\npane with his finger. This tapping was well known to everybody, and\r\nin a moment the best-looking woman of the family went out to him....\r\nAnother landlord, whenever he visited his estate, demanded from the\r\nmanager, immediately after his arrival, a list of all the grown-up\r\ngirls. Then,” the author continues, “the master took to his service\r\neach of the girls for three or four days, and as soon as the list was\r\nfinished, he went off to another village. This occurred regularly every\r\nyear.”[424]\r\n\r\nHere we have a collection of facts, belonging, as I think, to the same\r\ngroup as the _jus primae noctis_ is of a chief or a priest. And it is\r\nobvious that they have nothing to do with “communal marriage.” The\r\nprivilege accorded to the priest, however, seems, in some cases, to\r\nhave a purely religious origin. Thus, Egede informs us that the native\r\nwomen of Greenland thought themselves fortunate if an Angekokk, or\r\nprophet, honoured them with his caresses; and some husbands even paid\r\nhim, because they believed that the child of such a holy man could not\r\nbut be happier and better than others.[425] Von Martius thinks that\r\nthe right granted to the medicine-man among the Brazilian aborigines\r\nis owing to savage ideas of woman’s impurity.[426] And on the coast\r\nof Malabar, Hamilton says, the bride was given to the chief priest,\r\n“because the first fruits of her nuptials must be a holy oblation to\r\nthe god she worships.”[427]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYet another group of facts is adduced as evidence for the hypothesis of\r\nancient communism in women. Sir J. Lubbock and Professor Giraud-Teulon\r\ncite some cases of courtesans being held in greater estimation than\r\nwomen married to a single husband, or, at least, being by no means\r\ndespised.[428] Such feelings, Sir John believes, would naturally arise\r\n“when the special wife was a stranger and a slave, while the communal\r\nwife was a relative and a free woman,” and would, in some instances,\r\nlong survive the social condition to which they owed their origin.[429]\r\nThe courtesans are thus regarded as representatives of the communal\r\nwives of primitive times. But it seems to me much more reasonable to\r\nsuppose that if, in Athens and India, courtesans were respected and\r\nsought after even by the principal men, it was because they were the\r\nonly educated women.[430] Besides, as Mr. McLennan justly remarks with\r\nregard to such “communal wives,” “if any inference is to be made from\r\ntheir standing in Athens, in the brilliant age of Pericles, as to the\r\nstate of matters in the primitive groups, proof of primitive communism\r\nin women might as well be sought in London or Paris in our own day. Far\r\nback in the interval between savagery and the age of Pericles are the\r\nheroes of Homer with their noble wedded wives.”[431]\r\n\r\nIt is true that, among some uncivilized peoples, women having many\r\ngallants are esteemed better than virgins, and are more anxiously\r\ndesired in marriage. This is, for instance, stated to be the case with\r\nthe Indians of Quito,[432] the Laplanders in Regnard’s days,[433] and\r\nthe Hill Tribes of North Aracan.[434] But in each of these cases we\r\nare expressly told that want of chastity is considered a merit in the\r\nbride, because it is held to be the best testimony to the value of\r\nher attractions. There are thus various reasons why courtesans and\r\nlicentious women may be held in respect and sought after, and we need\r\nnot, therefore, resort to Sir John Lubbock’s far-fetched hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nA CRITICISM OF THE HYPOTHESIS OF PROMISCUITY\r\n\r\n(_Continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Mr. Lewis H. Morgan for information as to the\r\nnames of various degrees of kinship among no fewer than 139 different\r\nraces or tribes. This collection shows that very many peoples have\r\na nomenclature of relationships quite different from our own. Mr.\r\nMorgan divides the systems into two great classes, the descriptive\r\nand the classificatory, which he regards as radically distinct. “The\r\nfirst,” he says, “which is that of the Aryan, Semitic, and Uralian\r\nfamilies, rejecting the classification of kindred, except so far as\r\nit is in accordance with the numerical system, describes collateral\r\nconsanguinei, for the most part, by an augmentation or combination of\r\nthe primary terms of relationship. These terms, which are those for\r\nhusband and wife, father and mother, brother and sister, and son and\r\ndaughter, to which must be added, in such languages as possess them,\r\ngrandfather and grandmother, and grandson and granddaughter, are thus\r\nrestricted to the primary sense in which they are here employed. All\r\nother terms are secondary. Each relationship is thus made independent\r\nand distinct from every other. But the second, which is that of the\r\nTuranian, American Indian, and Malayan families, rejecting descriptive\r\nphrases in every instance, and reducing consanguinei to great classes,\r\nby a series of apparently arbitrary generalizations, applies the\r\nsame terms to all the members of the same class. It thus confounds\r\nrelationships, which, under the descriptive system, are distinct, and\r\nenlarges the signification both of the primary and secondary terms\r\nbeyond their seemingly appropriate sense.”[435]\r\n\r\nThe most primitive form of the classificatory group is the system\r\nof the “Malayan family,”[436] which prevails among the Hawaiians,\r\nKingsmill Islanders, Maoris, and, presumably, also among several\r\nother Polynesian and Micronesian tribes.[437] According to this\r\nsystem, all consanguinei, near and remote, are classified into five\r\ncategories. My brothers and sisters and my first, second, third, and\r\nmore remote male and female cousins, are the first category. To all\r\nthese without distinction I apply the same term. My father and mother,\r\ntogether with their brothers and sisters, and their first, second, and\r\nmore remote cousins, are the second category. To all these without\r\ndistinction I apply likewise the same term. The brothers, sisters, and\r\nseveral cousins of my grandparents I denominate as if they were my\r\ngrandparents; the cousins of my sons and daughters, as if they were\r\nmy sons and daughters; the grandchildren of my brothers and sisters\r\nand their several cousins, as if they were my own grandchildren. All\r\nthe individuals of the same category address each other as if they\r\nwere brothers and sisters. Uncleship, auntship, and cousinship being\r\nignored, we have, as far as the nomenclature is considered, only\r\ngrandchildren.[438]\r\n\r\nFrom this system of nomenclature all the others belonging to the\r\nclassificatory group have, according to Mr. Morgan, been gradually\r\ndeveloped. The system of the Two-Mountain Iroquois differs from that\r\nof the Hawaiians essentially in two respects only, the mother’s\r\nbrother being distinguished by a special term, and so also a sister’s\r\nchildren. The Micmac system is somewhat more advanced. Not only does\r\na man call his sister’s son his nephew, but a woman applies the same\r\nterm to her brother’s son; and not only is a mother’s brother termed\r\nan uncle, but also the father’s sister is distinguished by a special\r\nterm, as an aunt. A father’s brother is called a “little father;”\r\nand a mother’s sister, a “little mother.” Still more advanced is the\r\nsystem of the Wyandots, which may be regarded as the typical system of\r\nthe Indians.[439] A mother’s brother’s son and a father’s sister’s son\r\nare no longer called by the same terms as brothers, but are recognized\r\nas cousins; and women apply to their mother’s brother’s grandsons no\r\nlonger the same term as to their sons, but call them nephews.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to enter into further details. Those who shrink from\r\nthe trouble of reading through Mr. Morgan’s extensive tables, will\r\nfind an excellent summary of them in the fifth chapter of Sir John\r\nLubbock’s great work on ‘The Origin of Civilization.’ It may, however,\r\nbe added that the most advanced system of the classificatory group is\r\nthat of the Karens and Eskimo, which differs from our own in three\r\nrespects only. The children of cousins are termed nephews; the children\r\nof nephews, grandchildren; and a grandfather’s brothers and sisters,\r\nrespectively, grandfathers and grandmothers. “Hence,” says Sir John\r\nLubbock, “though the Karens and Eskimo have now a far more correct\r\nsystem of nomenclature than that of many other races, we find, even in\r\nthis, clear traces of a time when these peoples had not advanced in\r\nthis respect beyond the lowest stage.”[440]\r\n\r\nFrom these systems of nomenclature Mr. Morgan draws very far-reaching\r\nconclusions, assuming that they are necessarily to be explained by\r\nearly marriage customs. Thus, from the “Malayan system,” he infers\r\nthe former prevalence of “marriage in a group” of all brothers\r\nand sisters and cousins of the same grade or generation; or, more\r\ncorrectly, his case is, that if we can explain the “Malayan system”\r\non the assumption that such a general custom once existed, then we\r\nmust believe that it did formerly exist. “Without this custom,” he\r\nsays, “it is impossible to explain the origin of the system from the\r\nnature of descents. There is, therefore, a necessity for the prevalence\r\nof this custom amongst the remote ancestors of all the nations which\r\nnow possess the classificatory system, if the system itself is to\r\nbe regarded as having a natural origin.”[441] The family resulting\r\nfrom this custom he calls, in his latest work, the “consanguine\r\nfamily,” and in this, consisting of a body of kinsfolk, within which\r\nthere prevailed promiscuity, or “communal marriage,” between all men\r\nand women of the same generation, the family in its first stage is\r\nrecognized.[442] Mr. Morgan believes, however, that as a necessary\r\ncondition antecedent to this form of the family, promiscuity, in a\r\nwider sense of the term, may be theoretically deduced, though, as he\r\nsays, “it lies concealed in the misty antiquity of mankind beyond the\r\nreach of positive knowledge.”[443]\r\n\r\nIt is needless here to consider whether the last conclusion holds good.\r\nI shall endeavour to prove that Mr. Morgan’s inference of a stage of\r\npromiscuous intercourse even within the prescribed limits is altogether\r\nuntenable. All depends on the point whether the “classificatory\r\nsystem” is a system of blood-ties, the nomenclature having been founded\r\non blood-relationship, as near as the parentage of individuals could be\r\nknown. Mr. Morgan assumes this, instead of proving it.\r\n\r\nYet in the terms themselves there is, generally, nothing which\r\nindicates that they imply an idea of consanguinity. Professor Buschmann\r\nhas given us a very interesting list of the names for father and\r\nmother in many different languages.[444] The similarity of the terms\r\nis striking. “Pa,” “papa,” or “baba,” for instance, means father in\r\nseveral languages of the Old and New World, and “ma,” “mama,” means\r\nmother. The Tupis in Brazil have “paia” for father, and “maia” for\r\nmother;[445] the Uaraguaçú, respectively, “paptko” and “mamko.”[446]\r\nIn other languages the terms for father are “ab,” “aba,” “apa,”\r\n“ada,” “ata,” “tata”; those for mother, “ama,” “emä,” “ana,”\r\n“ena,” &c. According to Buschmann, there are four typical forms of\r\nwords for each of these ideas: for father, “pa,” “ta,” “ap,” “at”;\r\nfor mother, “ma,” “na,” “am,” “an.” Sometimes, however, the meaning\r\nof the types is reversed. Thus, in Georgian,[447] as well as in the\r\nMahaga language of Ysabel,[448] “mama” stands for father; whilst the\r\nTuluvas in Southern India call the father “amme,” and the mother\r\n“appe.”[449]\r\n\r\nThe terms used often fall outside of the types mentioned. In the Lifu\r\ntongue, for example, one term for father is “kaka;”[450] in the Duauru\r\nlanguage of Baladea, “chicha”;[451] in the Maréan tongue, “chacha”\r\nor “cheche.”[452] Again, among the Chalcha Mongols and some related\r\npeoples, mother is “ekè.”[453] In the Kanúri language, of Central\r\nAfrica, the mother is called “ya”;[454] while the Kechua in Brazil\r\ncall the father “yaya.”[455] Among the Bakongo, as I am informed by\r\nMr. Ingham, “se” means father; in Finnish, “isä.” Again, by the\r\nBrazilian Bakaĭri, the mother is called “ise”;[456] and, by the people\r\nof Aneiteum, New Hebrides, “risi.”[457]\r\n\r\nSimilar terms are often used for other relationships. The Greek,\r\n“πάππος” signifies grandfather, and “μάμμα” grandmother. In the\r\nKanúri language, “yaya” stands for elder brother;[458] and, in\r\nLifuan, “mama” and “dhina” are terms for brother, whilst mother is\r\n“thine.”[459]\r\n\r\nThe origin of such terms is obvious. They are formed from the easiest\r\nsounds a child can produce. “‘Pa-pa,’ ‘ma-ma,‘ 'tata,’ and\r\n‘apa,’ ‘ama,’ ‘ata,’” Professor Preyer says, “emerge originally\r\nspontaneously, the way of the breath being barred at the expiration,\r\neither by the lips (_p_, _m_), or by the tongue (_d_, _t_).”[460]\r\nYet the different races vary considerably with regard to the ease\r\nwith which they produce certain sounds. Thus the pronunciation of the\r\nlabials is very difficult to many Indians,[461] on account of which\r\ntheir terms for father, mother, or other near kinsfolk, often differ\r\nmuch from the types given by Professor Buschmann.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the terms borrowed from the children’s lips have\r\nno intrinsic meaning whatever. Hence, if a Bakaĭri child calls its\r\nfather and father’s brother “tsogo,” its mother and mother’s sister\r\n“tsego”;[462] if a Macúsi names his paternal uncle “papa” as well as\r\nhis father, and an Efatese names his father and all the tribe brothers\r\nof his father “ava” or “tama”;[463] if the Dacotahs apply the term\r\n“ahta” not only to the father, but also to the father’s brother, to\r\nthe mother’s sister’s husband, to the father’s father’s brother’s son,\r\n&c., and the term “enah” not only to the mother, but also to the\r\nmother’s sister, to the mother’s mother’s sister’s daughter, &c.;[464]\r\nif, among the New Caledonians, an uncle, taking the place of a father,\r\nis called “baba” like the father himself, and an aunt is called\r\n“gnagna” like a mother;[465] if, as Archdeacon Hodgson of Zanzibar,\r\nwrites to me, a native of Eastern Central Africa uses the words “baba”\r\nand “mama” not only for father and mother respectively, but also, very\r\ncommonly, for “any near relationship or even external connection;” if,\r\nfinally, the Semitic word for father, “ab” (“abu”), is not only used\r\nin a wide range of senses, but, to quote Professor Robertson Smith,\r\n“in all dialects is used in senses quite inconsistent with the idea\r\nthat procreator is the radical meaning of the word,”[466]—we certainly\r\nmust not, from these designations, infer anything as to early marriage\r\ncustoms.\r\n\r\nOf course there are other terms applied to kinsfolk besides words\r\ntaken from the lips of children, or words derived from these. But\r\nthough considerable, their number has been somewhat exaggerated.\r\nThus, for instance, Professor Vámbéry, in his work upon the primitive\r\nculture of the Turko-Tartars, says that the terms for mother, “ana”\r\nor “ene” have originally the meaning of woman or nurse, being derived\r\nfrom the roots “an” and “en.”[467] Exactly the reverse seems to be\r\nthe fact, the terms for mother being the primitive words. In the same\r\nway, I cannot but think that Professor Max Müller and several other\r\nphilologists are in error in deriving “pitár,” “pater,” “father,”\r\nfrom the root “pa,” which means to protect, to nourish; and “mâtár,”\r\n“mater,” “mother,” from the root “ma,” to fashion.[468] It seems,\r\nindeed, far more natural, as has been pointed out by Sir J. Lubbock\r\nand others, that the roots “pa,” to protect, and “ma,” to fashion,\r\ncome from “pa,” father, and “ma,” mother, and not _vice versa_.[469]\r\nI am the more inclined to accept this explanation, as Mr. A. J. Swann\r\ninforms me, from Kavala Island, Lake Tanganyika, that among the Waguha,\r\nthe words “baba,” and “tata,” which mean father, also have the\r\nmeaning of protector, provider.\r\n\r\nI do not deny that relationships—especially in the collateral and\r\ndescending lines—are in some cases denoted by terms derived from roots\r\nhaving an independent meaning; but the number of those that imply an\r\nidea of consanguinity does not seem to be very great. Mr. Bridges\r\nwrites that, among the Yahgans, “the names ‘imu’ and ‘dabi’—father and\r\nmother—have no meaning apart from their application, neither have any\r\nof their other very definite and ample list of terms for relatives,\r\nexcept the terms ‘macu’ and ‘macipa’ son and daughter. These terms\r\nrefer to ‘magu’ which means parturition; ‘cipa’ (‘keepa’) signifies\r\nwoman or female.” In Bakongo, according to Mr. Ingham, “se” and\r\n“tata” denote father; “mama,” “mbuta,” and “ngudi,” mother;\r\n“nfumu,” elder brother or sister; “mbunzi,” younger brother; and\r\n“mbusi,” younger sister. “Nfumu” means also Sir, chief; “mbuta”\r\nmeans “the one who bore,” from “buta,” or “wuta,” to beget; and\r\n“ngudi,” “the one we descended from.” Again, Mr. Radfield informs\r\nme that, in the language of Lifu, the term for father means root;\r\nthe term for mother, foundation or vessel; the term for sister,\r\nforbidden or “not to be touched;” and the terms for eldest and younger\r\nbrother, respectively, ruler and ruled. It is possible—I should even\r\nsay probable—that, in these instances also, the designations for\r\nrelationships are the radical words. Besides, it should be observed\r\nthat, in Yahgan, “the terms for relatives are strictly reserved for\r\nsuch, neither are they interchanged,” and that in Bakongo, the terms\r\n“tata” and “mama” are used as signs of respect to any one, whilst\r\nthe terms “mbuta” and “ngudi” seem to be applied exclusively to the\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nNot only has Mr. Morgan given no evidence for the truth of his\r\nassumption that the “classificatory system” is a system of blood-ties,\r\nbut this assumption is not even fully consistent with the facts he\r\nhas himself stated. It is conceivable that uncertainty as regards\r\nfatherhood might have led a savage to call several men his fathers, but\r\nan analogous reason could never have induced him to name several women\r\nhis mothers. Hence, if a man applies the same term to his mother’s\r\nsisters as to his mother, and he himself is addressed as a son by a\r\nwoman who did not give birth to him, this evidently shows that the\r\nnomenclature, at least in certain cases, cannot be explained by the\r\nnature of descent.[470]\r\n\r\nThere can be scarcely any doubt that the terms for relationships are,\r\nin their origin, terms of address. “The American Indians,” says\r\nMr. Morgan, “always speak to each other, when related, by the term\r\nof relationship, and never by the personal name of the individual\r\naddressed.”[471] From a psychological point of view, it would, indeed,\r\nbe surprising if it could be shown that primitive men, in addressing\r\nall the different members of their family or tribe, took into\r\nconsideration so complicated a matter as the degree of consanguinity.\r\nCan we really believe that a savage whose intelligence, perhaps, was so\r\ndeficient that he was scarcely able to count his own fingers, applied\r\nthe same term to his cousins as to his brothers, because he was not\r\ncertain whether, after all, they were not his brothers and that, when\r\nhe did make a distinction between them, he did so _because_ they were\r\nbegotten by different fathers? Facts show that savages generally\r\ndenominate their kindred according to much simpler principles, the\r\nnames being given chiefly with reference to sex and age, as also to the\r\nexternal or social, relationship in which the speaker stands to the\r\nperson whom he addresses.\r\n\r\nIn every language there are different designations for persons of\r\ndifferent sexes. In the rudest system of nomenclature, the Hawaiian,\r\nfather and other kinsmen of the same generation are called “makua\r\nkana;” mother, mother’s sisters, father’s sisters, &c., “makua\r\nwaheena,” “kana” and “waheena” being the terms for male and female.\r\nA son is called “kaikee kana,” a daughter “kaikee waheena,” whilst\r\n“kana” alone is applied to husband, husband’s brother, and sister’s\r\nhusband, and “waheena” to wife, wife’s sister, brother’s wife, &c.\r\n\r\nThere are also separate terms in every language for relations belonging\r\nto different generations. Among the lower races especially, age, or,\r\nmore exactly, the age of the person spoken to compared with that of the\r\nspeaker, plays a very important part in the matter of denomination.\r\nAccording to Dr. Davy, the Veddahs appear to be without names; “a\r\nVeddah interrogated on the subject, said, ‘I am called a man: when\r\nyoung, I was called the little man: and when old, I shall be called\r\nthe old man.’”[472] The Hawaiians, as we are informed by Judge\r\nAndrews, have no definite general word for brother in common use. But\r\n“kaikuaána” signifies any one of my brothers, or male cousins, older\r\nthan myself, I being a male, and any one of my sisters, or female\r\ncousins, older than myself, I being a female; whilst “kaikaina”\r\nsignifies a younger brother of a brother, or a younger sister of a\r\nsister.[473] Such distinguishing epithets applied to older and younger\r\nare, in fact, very frequently met with among uncivilized peoples. Thus,\r\ntouching the Andamanese, Mr. Man states that “brothers and sisters\r\nspeak of one another by titles that indicate relative age: that is,\r\ntheir words for brother and sister involve the distinction of elder or\r\nyounger.” A like system is adopted by them in respect to half-brothers,\r\nhalf-sisters, cousins, brothers-in-law, and sisters-in-law.[474] In\r\ncertain languages, too, there are special terms for an uncle on the\r\nfather’s side older than the father, and for an uncle younger than\r\nhe;[475] and in the Fulfúlde tongue, the age of the uncles is so\r\nminutely specified, that the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth\r\nuncle, on both the father’s and the mother’s side, are each called by a\r\nparticular name.[476]\r\n\r\nThe wider meaning in which many terms for kinship are used bear witness\r\nin the same direction. The Rev. J. Sibree states that, in Hova, “ray,”\r\nfather, does not take the sense the corresponding word in many Semitic\r\nlanguages has, of “maker” of a thing, but it is used in a wide sense\r\nas an elder or superior; and “rény,” mother, is also used in a\r\nwide sense as a respectful way of addressing an elderly woman.[477]\r\nMr. Swann writes to me that, among the Waguha, West Tanganyika, men\r\nadvanced in years are termed “baba,” father, whilst, in other parts\r\nof Equatorial Africa, according to Mr. Reade, old men are addressed as\r\n“rera,” father, and old women as “ngwe,” mother.[478] The Russian\r\n“batushka” and “matushka,” as also the Swedish “far” and “mor,”\r\nare often used in a similar way. Again, Mr. Cousins asserts that,\r\namong the natives of Cis-Natalian Kafirland, the terms for father,\r\nmother, brother, and sister, are not restricted to them only, but are\r\napplied equally to other persons of a similar age, whether related\r\nor otherwise. “‘Bawo,’ father,” he says, “means elder or older,\r\n‘bawo-kulu’ means a big-father, one older than father.” Probably\r\n“bawo,” as belonging to the type “pa,” was originally used as a\r\nterm of address, from which the sense of elder or older was derived;\r\nbut this does not interfere with the matter in question. The Rev. E.\r\nCasalis, writing of the Basutos, states that “in addressing a person\r\nolder than one’s self, one says, ‘My father, my mother;’ to an equal,\r\n‘My brother;’ and to inferiors, ‘My children.’”[479] The Finnish\r\n“isä” and the Votyak “ai,” father, the Lappish “Aja,” and the\r\nEsthonian “äi,” grandfather, are evidently related to, and probably\r\nthe roots of, the Finnish “iso” and “äijä” which mean big.[480] The\r\nChukchi use, besides “atta” for father and “mámang” for mother,\r\n“empynátchyo” and “émpyngau” respectively, which obviously have the\r\nsame root as “émpytchin,” elder or older.[481] The Brazilian Uainumá\r\ncall a father “paii,” but also “pechyry,” _i.e._, old.[482] “Les\r\njeunes Australiens,” says Bishop Salvado, “ont coutume d’appeler\r\n‘mama’ ou ‘maman’ (c’est-à-dire-père) tous les vieillards, comme\r\naussi ‘N-angan’ (ou mère) les femmes avancées en âge.”[483] According\r\nto Nicolaus Damascenus, the Galactophagi denominated “all old men\r\nfathers; young men, sons; and those of equal age, brothers.”[484] In\r\nGerman, the parents are “die Eltern,” the older (“die Aelteren”),\r\nand they are also called familiarly “die Alten;” the father, “der\r\nAlte;” and the mother, “die Alte” or “Altsche.”[485] Again, among\r\nthe North American Indians, old people are very commonly named\r\ngrandfathers and grandmothers;[486] whilst the Finnish “ämmä” does\r\nnot signify grandmother only, but old woman in general.[487] Among the\r\nTsuishikari Ainos, the maternal grandfather and grandmother of a child\r\nare called both by _him_, and his _father_, “henki” and “unarabe”\r\nrespectively.[488]\r\n\r\nAs to the collateral line, it should be observed that, in Ćagatai, an\r\nelder sister is called “egeći,” which actually means old woman “ege,”\r\nold, big; “eći,” woman, sister.[489] In Hungarian, where “bátya”\r\nstands for elder brother, an uncle is “nagybátya,” _i.e._, a big elder\r\nbrother.[490] Among many Ural-Altaic peoples, the same term is applied\r\nto an elder brother as to an uncle, to an elder sister as to an\r\naunt.[491] Were we to follow Mr. Morgan’s way of reasoning, we should,\r\nfrom this nomenclature, come to very curious conclusions as to the\r\nearly marriage customs of the peoples in question.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the Galibi language of Brazil, “tigami” signifies young\r\nbrother, son, and little child indiscriminately;[492] and several\r\nlanguages have no other words for son and daughter than those for lad\r\nand girl.[493] Thus, in Hawaiian, a son is called male child, or more\r\nproperly, little male; and a daughter, female child or girl.[494] Mr.\r\nGeorge Bridgman states that, among the Mackay blacks of Queensland, the\r\nword for daughter is used by a man for any young woman belonging to\r\nthe class which his daughter would belong to if he had one.[495] And,\r\nspeaking of the South Australians, Eyre says, “In their intercourse\r\nwith each other, natives of different tribes are exceedingly\r\npunctilious and polite; ... almost everything that is said is prefaced\r\nby the appellation of father, son, brother, mother, sister, or some\r\nother similar term, corresponding to that degree of relationship\r\nwhich would have been most in accordance with their relative ages and\r\ncircumstances.”[496]\r\n\r\nAll those names, refer, as previously mentioned, not to the absolute,\r\nbut to the relative, age of the person addressed. Often, too, there is\r\na certain relativity in the use of words denominating sex. Mr. Dall\r\nremarks, for instance, that among the Eskimo, the form of the terms\r\nof relationship “appears to depend in some cases more on the sex of\r\nthe speaker than on that of the person to whom the term refers.” In\r\nEastern Central Africa, “if a man have a brother and a sister, he is\r\ncalled one thing by the brother, but quite a different thing by the\r\nsister.”[497] And several other instances of the same kind are to be\r\nfound in Mr. Morgan’s tables.\r\n\r\nAs for the third factor influencing the terms of address—_i.e._, the\r\nsocial relationship which exists between the addresser and the one\r\naddressed,—it is obvious that different designations are applied to\r\nenemies and friends, to strangers and members of the family-circle,\r\nnay, generally, to persons to whom one stands in an altogether\r\ndifferent external relationship. The importance of this factor is\r\nevident from several statements. Thus, among the Hovas, according to\r\nMr. Sibree, the words for brother and sister “are also used widely\r\nfor any person whom one meets and desires to act towards in a friendly\r\nmanner.”[498] The Fuegians says Mr. Bridges, form certain kinds of\r\nfriendships, and “speak of aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, cousins,\r\nnieces and nephews, &c., which are only so through the friendships\r\nestablished.”[499] Among the Waguha, strangers are called “ndugu,”\r\nbrother, if of the same tribe;[500] and Mr. Hartshorne tells us that\r\nthe Veddahs applied to him the term “hura,” or cousin.[501] We\r\ncan understand, then, why the same name, as a rule, is used by the\r\nsavage to denote just the persons of the same sex and of like age\r\nwho belong to his own family-circle; and why, as a consequence, the\r\nnomenclature is rich or poor according as that circle is small or\r\nlarge. The Yahgans, for instance, who live in families rather than in\r\ntribes, have a very definite list of terms for kinsfolk. They have\r\ndifferent appellations for nephews and nieces on the brother’s side,\r\nand nephews and nieces on the sister’s side, and their words for\r\nuncle and aunt differ according as this relationship is paternal or\r\nmaternal. They have also special terms for father-, mother-, son-and\r\ndaughter-, brother-and sister-in-law.[502] On the other hand, the\r\nlarger, the body of kinsfolk that keep closely together, and the less\r\nit is differentiated, as regards the functions of its various members,\r\nthe more comprehensive are generally the terms of address. The\r\n“classificatory system of relationship” must, therefore, have emerged\r\nat a time when the separate families had already united in larger\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nThe same principle explains how it happens that a maternal uncle is\r\nalmost always distinguished from a father by a separate term, whilst\r\nthis is not the case with an uncle on the father’s side, the former\r\ngenerally living in another community from his nephew, and, besides,\r\nvery frequently standing to him in a quite peculiar relationship\r\nthrough the rules of succession. It may be fairly assumed, too, that\r\na mother’s sister much oftener than a father’s sister is called a\r\nmother, because sisters, among savages, keep as a rule, far more\r\nclosely together, when married, than brothers and sisters; sometimes\r\neven, especially among the North American Indians, they are the wives\r\nof the same man. If we add to this that a father’s brother’s son and\r\na mother’s sister’s son are more commonly addressed as brothers than\r\nas father’s sister’s son and a mother’s brother’s son, it becomes\r\nobvious to how great an extent the nomenclature is influenced by\r\nexternal relations. But as a certain kind of external relationship is\r\ninvariably connected with a certain degree, or certain degrees, of\r\nblood-relationship, the designations given with reference to the former\r\nhave been taken as terms for the latter.\r\n\r\nThe basis on which Mr. Morgan has built his hypothesis must be\r\nconsidered, then, altogether untenable.[503] It cannot be proved\r\nthat, where the “classificatory system” prevails, the nomenclature\r\nwas intended to express the degree of consanguity so exactly as\r\nhe assumes, or that it had originally anything whatever to do with\r\ndescent. On the contrary, I have endeavoured to show that the case\r\nwas probably just the reverse; so that no inference regarding early\r\nmarriage customs is to be drawn from the terms for relationships. Even\r\nnow, in Spanish, a brother’s great-grandson is called grandson; in\r\nBulgarian, as also in Russian, a father’s father’s brother is termed a\r\ngrandfather, and a father’s father’s sister a grandmother; the Greek\r\n“ἁνεψιός” appears to have been applied to a nephew, a grandson, and a\r\ncousin; “neef,” in Dutch, still expresses these three relationships\r\nindiscriminately; in Flemish and Platt Deutsch, “nichte” is applied\r\nto a female cousin as well as to a niece; and Shakspeare, in his will,\r\ndescribes his granddaughter, Susannah Hall, as “my niece.”[504]\r\nSurely, nobody would look upon these designations as relics of ancient\r\ntimes, when there really might have been some uncertainty as to kinship\r\nin the direction which the terms indicate. Mr. Morgan himself admits\r\nthat, in Latin, “nepos” did not originally signify “either a nephew,\r\ngrandson or cousin, but that it was used promiscuously to designate a\r\nclass of persons next without the primary relationships.”[505]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThirty years ago, in a work of prodigious learning,[506] the Swiss\r\njurist, Dr. Bachofen, drew attention to the remarkable fact that a\r\nsystem of “kinship through mothers only” prevailed among several\r\nancient peoples. Moreover, partly from actual statements of old\r\nwriters, partly from traditions and myths, he came to the conclusion\r\nthat such a system everywhere preceded the rise of “kinship through\r\nmales.” A few years later, though quite independently of him, Mr.\r\nMcLennan set forth exactly the same hypothesis, being led to it\r\nchiefly by extensive studies in modern ethnology. While, however,\r\nBachofen explained the phenomenon as a consequence of the supremacy\r\nof women, Mr. McLennan regarded it as due to the uncertain paternity\r\nwhich resulted from early promiscuity. “It is inconceivable,” he\r\nsays, “that anything but the want of certainty on that point could\r\nhave long prevented the acknowledgment of kinship through males; and\r\nin such cases we shall be able to conclude that such certainty has\r\nformerly been wanting—that more or less promiscuous intercourse between\r\nthe sexes has formerly prevailed. The connection between these two\r\nthings—uncertain paternity and kinship through females only, seems so\r\nnecessary—that of cause and effect—that we may confidently infer the\r\none where we find the other.”[507]\r\n\r\nIt must be observed that the facts adduced as examples of what Mr.\r\nMcLennan calls “kinship through females only” in most instances imply,\r\nchiefly, that children are named after their mothers, not after their\r\nfathers, and that property and rank succeed exclusively in the female\r\nline. If these customs were to be explained as relics of ancient\r\npromiscuity, we certainly should have to admit that such a state was\r\nformerly very prevalent in the human race. Yet we could not be sure\r\nthat it prevailed universally. For, though the number of peoples among\r\nwhom descent and inheritance follow the mother’s side only, is very\r\nconsiderable,[508] the number of those among whom the male line is\r\nrecognized, is scarcely less—even apart from the civilized nations\r\nof Europe and Asia. At present, when anthropologists affirm with so\r\nmuch assurance that a system of exclusive “kinship through females”\r\nprevailed everywhere before the tie of blood between father and child\r\nhad found a place in systems of relationships, it seems appropriate to\r\ngive a list of peoples among whom such a system does _not_ prevail—a\r\nlist, however, which cannot pretend to completeness.\r\n\r\nStarting, then, with North America, which is acknowledged to be, or to\r\nhave been, one of the chief centres of “mother-right,” or metrocracy,\r\nwe meet there with many aboriginal nations among whom a son, as a rule\r\ntakes the father’s name and becomes his heir.[509] Thus Cranz states\r\nthat, among the Eskimo of Greenland, “when a husband dies, his eldest\r\nson inherits his house, tent, and woman’s boat, and besides must\r\nmaintain the mother and children, who share the furniture and clothes\r\namongst themselves.”[510] Among the Indians bordering on the south-east\r\ncoast of the river St. Lawrence, according to Heriot, the eldest son\r\ntook the name of his father with the addition of one syllable.[511] The\r\nCalifornian tribes[512] and the Dacotahs[513] recognized chieftainship\r\nas hereditary in the male line; and, with reference to the latter,\r\nMr. Prescott remarks that they cannot well forget relationships, as\r\nthe names of father and mother are both recollected for three or four\r\ngenerations.[514] Among the Ahts, the eldest son takes all the property\r\nleft by his father, and the head-chiefs rank is hereditary in the male\r\nline.[515] The paternal system prevails, moreover, in thirteen other\r\ntribes mentioned by Mr. Frazer in his essay on “Totemism.”[516]\r\n\r\nIn Mexico, Yucatan, San Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua, succession\r\nran from father to son; and in Vera Paz, according to Las Casas,\r\nkinship was so exclusively recognized in the male line, that the people\r\nthere thought the most remote kin in their own lineage to be more\r\nclosely related than the daughter of their mother, provided she was\r\nnot of the same father. On the other hand, Piedrahita tells us that,\r\namong the Chibchas, the sons of sisters, and, in default of such, the\r\nbrothers of the king, were the heirs to the crown of Bogota, but that\r\nthe sons had a right to the personal property of their father; whilst,\r\naccording to Herrera, the property was inherited by the brothers, and\r\nif there were none living, by the _sons_ of those who were dead.[517]\r\n\r\nAmong the Caribs, kinship was reckoned in the female line, but the\r\nauthority of the chiefs was hereditary in the male line only, the\r\nchildren of sisters being excluded from the succession.[518] Among\r\nthe Macas Indians in Ecuador, property descends from father to\r\nson;[519] among the Guaycurûs, Abipones, and Araucanians, nobility, or\r\nchieftainship, was hereditary in the male line;[520] and the Brazilian\r\naborigines, or at least some of them, laid particular stress upon\r\nkinship through fathers.[521] Again, with reference to the Yahgans of\r\nTierra del Fuego, Mr. Bridges writes, “A child belongs equally to the\r\nclan of its father and mother as regards duty of revenge, but is always\r\nreckoned a member of the father’s clan only. Children are generally\r\nnamed after their grandparents, paternal or maternal indifferently.\r\nThey are quite as much attached to their mother’s relatives and these\r\nto them, as to their paternal relatives; the only difference is that\r\nthey are integral parts of the father’s clan, not of the mother’s.”\r\nSpeaking of the same people, M. Hyades remarks, “L’héritage se\r\ntransmet à l’époux survivant, ou à défaut, au fils aîné.”[522] In\r\nshort, the paternal system, so far as we know, predominates among the\r\naborigines of South America.\r\n\r\nPassing to the Pacific Islands, we find that, though rank and clan\r\nare commonly inherited there through the mother, property generally\r\ngoes in the male line. In Tonga, the son succeeds his father in homage\r\nand title,[523] and here, as well as in Fiji, on the father’s death,\r\nhis possessions descend to his children.[524] Ellis tells us that, in\r\nTahiti, the child of a chief was invested, soon after its birth, with\r\nthe name and office of its father,[525] and in the case of there being\r\nno children, the brother of the deceased assumed the government. In\r\nother families property always went to the eldest son.[526] Among the\r\nHawaiians, the rank of the principal and inferior chiefs, the offices\r\nof the priests, as also other situations of honour and influence,\r\ndescended from father to son,[527] although on the whole, the female\r\nline predominated.[528] In the Hervey Islands, children belonged either\r\nto the father’s or mother’s clan, according to arrangement; usually,\r\nhowever, the father had the preference.[529] In New Caledonia, kinship\r\nis reckoned in the male line,[530] and in Lifu, as Mr. Radfield informs\r\nme, children belong to the paternal clan. In the Caroline Group, landed\r\nproperty succeeds mostly from father to son, children are named after\r\ntheir father’s father or mother’s father, and, apparently, the rank of\r\nthe father influences that of the son, at least if he be a chief.[531]\r\nAmong the Rejangs[532] and Bataks[533] of Sumatra, as also in several\r\nother islands belonging to the Indian Archipelago,[534] and in New\r\nGuinea,[535] the male line prevails. In the Kingsmill Islands, “if a\r\nchief has several children by different wives, the son of the mother of\r\nthe highest rank is the successor.”[536] And, in New Zealand, nobility\r\nwas inherited both in the male and female line; but on the death of\r\na man, his eldest son took the family name which his father had held\r\nbefore him.[537]\r\n\r\nAustralian children are generally named after their mother’s clan; but\r\nthis is not the case in every tribe.[538] Among the Gournditch-mara,\r\nTurra, Moncalon, Torndirrup, and some other tribes, the male line\r\nprevails.[539] With reference to the Narrinyeri, the Rev. G. Taplin\r\nstates that a man’s children belong to his tribe (_i.e._ clan), and\r\nnot to their mother’s; that property descends from father to son, and\r\nthat, in case of a man dying without issue of his own, his possessions\r\nare always transmitted to the brother’s children.[540] Again, in the\r\nDieyerie tribe of South Australia, the sons take the father’s clan, the\r\ndaughters the mother’s.[541] Even where children are named after their\r\nmother, inheritance may go from father to son. Thus, among the West\r\nAustralians, the hunting ground or landed property descends in the male\r\nline, though “children of either sex always take the family name of\r\ntheir mother.”[542]\r\n\r\nAmong the Todas, all children belong to the father’s family, and\r\ninheritance runs through males only.[543] The same is the case with\r\nmost of the Indian Hill Tribes: either all the sons dividing their\r\nfather’s property equally, as among the Gonds, Bodo, and Dhimáls; or\r\nthe eldest son getting the largest share, as among the Kandhs, Karens,\r\nand Nagas; or the youngest born male being the only heir, as among\r\nthe Hos; or the favourite son succeeding without reference to age,\r\nas among the Mishmis.[544] Among the Pahárias, too, sons inherit,\r\nand nephews by sisters get no share.[545] The law of succession\r\namong the Singphos gives to the eldest son all the landed property\r\nof the father, to the youngest all his personal property, while the\r\nrest inherit nothing.[546] Among the Santals, children belong to the\r\nfather’s clan;[547] and the same is the case with the offspring of\r\nintermarriages of Lepchas and Limbus and Butias.[548] Touching the\r\nKarens, Dr. A. Bunker writes to me, “A child takes a name of its\r\nown, and of neither of the parents; but usually the father, being the\r\nstronger, takes the child in case of separation. It is regarded as\r\nbelonging to both parents, so far as blood goes.” If we add to this\r\nthat the male line prevails in Arabia,[549] Tibet,[550] throughout\r\nRussian Asia,[551] and among the Ainos,[552] it must be admitted\r\nthat the system of “kinship through females only” is of very rare\r\noccurrence in Asia, being restricted, so far as I know, to a few parts\r\nof India, Ceylon, and the Malay Archipelago.[553]\r\n\r\nIt is much more prevalent among the African races. Yet, even among\r\nthem, there are many instances where succession runs in the male line.\r\nA king or chief of the Somals[554] and Ba-kwileh[555] is succeeded by\r\nhis son. Among the Fulah, this dignity is transmitted to the brother,\r\nwhile, in other instances, succession goes from father to son.[556]\r\nAmong the Negroes of the Gold Coast, according to Bosman, the eldest\r\nson succeeded his father in office, though kinship was reckoned through\r\nthe mother all along this coast, except at Accra.[557] Dr. A. Sims\r\nwrites that, among the Bateke, “the child is considered as belonging\r\nto the father and mother equally,” and takes the grandfather’s or\r\ngrandmother’s name. Among the Waguha, according to Mr. Swann, children\r\nare generally named after the father. In Lánda, the eldest son inherits\r\nall his father’s possessions, wives included.[558] Among the Damaras,\r\nwhose divisions into clans are derived from the mother, the eldest son\r\nof the chief wife, nevertheless, is the successor of his father;[559]\r\nand the same rule prevails among the Bechuanas.[560] The Rev. A.\r\nEyles states that all Zulu children belong to the father’s tribe, and\r\nare called by his name or by the name of some of his ancestors.[561]\r\nAccording to Mr. Cousins,[562] this is essentially true of various\r\nKafir tribes, the first son, however, never being named after the\r\ngrandfather, but always after the father. Warner, Brownlee, and E. \r\nv. Weber assert also that, among the people, inheritance passes\r\nfrom father to son.[563] Le Vaillant and Kolben state the same with\r\nreference to the Hottentots and Bushmans;[564] and Andersson affirms\r\nthat, among the Namaquas, daughters take the father’s name, sons the\r\nmother’s.[565] Finally, in the part of Madagascar where Drury was,\r\nkinship does not seem to have been, in every case, reckoned through the\r\nfemale, though in that island children generally follow the condition\r\nof the mother.[566]\r\n\r\nAs for ancient peoples, Bachofen has adduced from the works of\r\nclassical writers evidence for the uterine line having prevailed among\r\nseveral of them. But, to quote Sir Henry Maine, “the greatest races\r\nof mankind, when they first appear to us, show themselves at or near\r\na stage of development in which relationship or kinship is reckoned\r\nexclusively through males.”[567] Several writers have, it is true,\r\nendeavoured to prove that, among the primitive Aryans, descent was\r\ntraced through females only;[568] but the evidence does not seem to be\r\nconclusive. Much importance has been attributed to the specially close\r\nconnection which, according to Tacitus, existed between a sister’s\r\nchildren and their mother’s brothers;[569] but Dr. Schrader observes\r\nthat, in spite of this prominent position of the maternal uncle in\r\nthe ancient Teutonic family, the _patruus_ distinctly came before\r\nthe _avunculus_, the agnates before the cognates, in testamentary\r\nsuccession. He also suggests that, when the head of a household died,\r\nthe women of his family passed under the guardianship of the eldest\r\nson, and that a woman’s children had therefore, quite naturally, a\r\npeculiarly intimate relation to their maternal uncle.[570] It is safe\r\nto say with Professor Max Müller, that we can neither assert nor deny\r\nthat in unknown times the Aryans ever passed through a metrocratic\r\nstage.[571]\r\n\r\nEven if it could be proved—which is doubtful—that, in former times, a\r\nsystem of “kinship through females only,” fully developed, prevailed\r\namong all the peoples whose children take the mother’s name and are\r\nconsidered to belong to her clan, though succession runs in the male\r\nline, we should still have to account for the fact that a large number\r\nof peoples exhibit no traces of such a system.[572] And to them belong\r\nmany of the rudest races of the world—such as the aborigines of Brazil,\r\nthe Fuegians, Hottentots, Bushmans, and several very low tribes in\r\nAustralia and India. The inference that “kinship through females only”\r\nhas everywhere preceded the rise of “kinship through males,” would,\r\nthen, be warranted only on condition that the cause, or the causes, to\r\nwhich the maternal system is owing, could be proved to have operated\r\nuniversally in the past life of mankind. From Mr. McLennan’s point of\r\nview, such an inference would be inadmissible, as he cannot prove the\r\nformer occurrence of a universal stage of promiscuity or polyandry,\r\nleading to uncertain paternity—the cause to which he attributes that\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nYet it is far from being so inconceivable as Mr. McLennan assumes,\r\nthat “anything but the want of certainty on that point could have\r\nlong prevented the acknowledgment of kinship through males.”[573]\r\nPaternity, as Sir Henry Maine remarks, is “matter of inference, as\r\nopposed to maternity, which is matter of observation.”[574] Hence it\r\nis almost beyond doubt that the father’s participation in parentage\r\nwas not recognized as soon as the mother’s.[575] Now, however, there\r\ndoes not seem to be a single people which has not made the discovery\r\nof fatherhood. In reply to my question whether the Fuegians consider\r\na child to descend exclusively or predominantly from either of the\r\nparents, Mr. Bridges certainly writes that, according to his idea, they\r\n“consider the maternal tie much more important than the paternal, and\r\nthe duties connected with it of mutual help, defence, and vengeance\r\nare held very sacred.” But it is doubtful whether this refers to the\r\nmere physiological connection between the child and its parents. Dr.\r\nSims informs me that, among the Bateke, the function of both parents in\r\ngeneration is held alike important, and the Waguha of West Tanganyika,\r\nas Mr. Swann states, also recognize the part taken by both. The same\r\nis asserted by Archdeacon Hodgson concerning certain other tribes of\r\nEastern Central Africa, though, among them, children take the name of\r\nthe mother’s tribe. Again, the Naudowessies, according to Carver, had\r\nthe very curious idea that their offspring were indebted to their\r\nfather for their souls, the invisible part of their essence, and to the\r\nmother for their corporeal and visible part; hence they considered it\r\n“more rational that they should be distinguished by the name of the\r\nlatter, from whom they indubitably derive their being, than by that of\r\nthe father, to which a doubt might sometimes arise whether they are\r\njustly entitled.”[576] Moreover, it seems as if the father’s share in\r\nparentage, once discovered, was often exaggerated. Thus, referring to\r\nsome tribes of New South Wales, Mr. Cameron tells us that, although\r\nthe father has nothing to do with the disposal of his daughter, as she\r\nbelongs to the clan of her mother’s brother, they “believe that the\r\ndaughter emanates from her father solely, being only nutured by her\r\nmother.”[577] Indeed, Mr. Howitt has found in every Australian tribe,\r\nwithout exception, with which he has acquaintance, the idea that the\r\nchild is derived from the male parent only. As a black fellow once put\r\nit to him, “The man gives the child to a woman to take care of for\r\nhim, and he can do whatever he likes with his own child.”[578] Again,\r\nMr. Cousins writes that, according to Kaffir ideas, a child descends\r\nchiefly, though not exclusively, from the father; and the ancient\r\nGreeks, as well as the Egyptians[579] and Hindus,[580] maintained a\r\nsimilar view. Nay, Euripides states distinctly that, in his day, the\r\nuniversally accepted physiological doctrine recognized only the share\r\ntaken by the father in procreation, and Hippocrates, in combating this\r\nopinion, and contending that the child descended from both parents,\r\nseems to admit that it was a prevalent heresy.[581] Finally, it seems\r\nprobable that the custom known under the name of “La Couvade”—that is,\r\nthe odd rule, prevalent among several peoples in different parts of\r\nthe world, requiring that the father, at the birth of his child, shall\r\nretire to bed for some time, and fast or abstain from certain kinds of\r\nfood—implies some idea of relationship between the two.[582]\r\n\r\nAdmitting, however, that there was a time when fatherhood, in the\r\nphysiological sense of the term, was not discovered, I do not think\r\nthat the preference given to the female line is due to this fact. If\r\nthe denomination of children and the rules of succession really were\r\nin the first place dependent on ideas of consanguinity, it might be\r\nexpected that a change with reference to the latter would be followed\r\nby a change in the former respect also. But the ties of blood have\r\nexercised a far less direct influence on the matter in question than\r\nis generally supposed, the system of “kinship through females only”\r\nbeing, properly speaking, quite different from what the words imply.\r\n\r\nThere may be several reasons for naming children after the mother\r\nrather than after the father, apart from any consideration of\r\nrelationship. Especially among savages, the tie between a mother\r\nand child is much stronger than that which binds a child to the\r\nfather.[583] Not only has she given birth to it, but she has also for\r\nyears been seen carrying it about at her breast. Moreover, in cases\r\nof separation, occurring frequently at lower stages of civilization,\r\nthe infant children always follow the mother, and so, very often, do\r\nthe children more advanced in years. Is it not natural, then, that\r\nthey should keep the name of the mother rather than that of a father\r\nwhom they scarcely know? Mr. Belt tells us that the men and women even\r\nof the christianised lower classes of Nicaragua often change their\r\nmates, and the children, in such cases remaining with the mother, take\r\ntheir surname from her.[584] According to Swann, the Creeks conferred\r\nthe honour of a chief on the issue of the female line, because it\r\nwas impossible to trace the right by the male issue, women only\r\nexceptionally having more than two children by the same father.[585]\r\nAnd touching the Khasias, one of the few tribes in India among whom\r\nthe female line prevails, Dr. Hooker states that they have a very\r\nlax idea of marriage, divorce and exchange of wives being common and\r\nattended with no disgrace; “the son therefore often forgets his\r\nfather’s name and person before he grows up, but becomes strongly\r\nattached to his mother.”[586]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of certain negro tribes, Winterbottom suggested long ago that\r\nthe prevalence of the female line was to be explained by the practice\r\nof polygyny,[587] and Dr. Starcke has recently called attention to\r\nthe same point.[588] The Rev. D. Macdonald likewise remarks, in\r\nhis account of the Efatese of the New Hebrides, that the idea that\r\nchildren are more closely related to the mother than to the father\r\nis an idea perfectly natural among a polygynous people.[589] It is\r\na customary arrangement in polygynous families that each wife has a\r\nhut for herself, where she lives with her children; but even where\r\nthis is not the case, mother and children naturally keep together as\r\na little sub-family. No wonder, then, if a child takes its name after\r\nthe mother rather than after the father. This is the simplest way of\r\npointing out the distinction between the issue of different wives, a\r\ndistinction which is of special importance where it is accompanied\r\nby different privileges as to succession. It is worth noticing that,\r\namong the Negroes, who are probably the most polygynous race in the\r\nworld, the female line is extremely prevalent; whereas, among the Hill\r\nTribes of India, who are on the whole, monogamists, children, with\r\nfew exceptions, take the name of the father. With reference to the\r\nBasutos, a Bechuana tribe, Mr. Casalis observes that the authority\r\nof the eldest maternal uncle preponderates to excess, especially in\r\npolygynous families, where the children have no strong affection for\r\ntheir father.[590]\r\n\r\nFurther, among several peoples a man, on marrying, has to quit his\r\nhome, and go to live with his wife in the house of her father, of whose\r\nfamily he becomes a member. This is a common practice among several of\r\nthe North American tribes,[591] and prevailed, in the southern part of\r\nthe New World, among the Caribs.[592] In some parts of Eastern Central\r\nAfrica, also, a man who marries a full grown girl “immediately leaves\r\nhis own village and proceeds to build a house in the village of his\r\nwife.”[593] Among the Sengirese, according to Dr. Hickson, the man\r\nalways goes to his wife’s house, unless he be the son of a rajah, in\r\nwhich case he may do as he pleases.[594] Dr. Hooker tells us that,\r\namong the Khasias, “the husband does not take his wife home, but\r\nenters her father’s household, and is entertained there.”[595] And in\r\nSumatra, in the mode of marriage called “ambel anak,” the father of\r\na virgin makes choice of some young man for her husband, who is taken\r\ninto his house to live there in a state between that of a son and that\r\nof a debtor.[596]\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Starcke, this custom is due to the great cohesive\r\npower of the several families, which causes them to refuse to part\r\nwith any of their members. “Since men are more independent,” he says,\r\n“they are also less stationary; they can no longer attract the women\r\nto themselves, and are therefore attracted by them.[597] Under such\r\ncircumstances, there is nothing astonishing in the fact that children\r\nare named after the mother’s tribe or clan, which is the case in\r\nall the instances just given of peoples among whom the husband has\r\nto settle down with his father-in-law. Indeed, Dr. Tylor has found\r\nthat, whilst the number of coincidences between peoples among whom\r\nthe husband lives with the wife’s family and peoples among whom the\r\nmaternal system prevails, is proportionally large, the full maternal\r\nsystem never appears among peoples whose exclusive custom is for the\r\nhusband to take his wife to his own home.[598] And it is a remarkable\r\nfact that where both customs—the woman receiving her husband in her own\r\nhut, and the man taking his wife to his—occur side by side among the\r\nsame people, descent in the former cases is traced through the mother,\r\nin the latter through the father.[599] In Japan, should there be only\r\ndaughters in the family, a husband is procured for the eldest, who\r\nenters his wife’s family, and, at the same time, takes its name.[600]\r\n\r\nAgain, as to the rules of succession, Dr. Starcke has set forth the\r\nhypothesis that they are dependent on local connections, those persons\r\nbeing each other’s heirs who dwell together in one place. Among the\r\nIroquois, for instance, at the death of a man, his property is divided\r\namong his brothers, sisters, and mother’s brothers, whilst the property\r\nof a woman is transmitted to her children and sisters, but not to\r\nher brothers. “Owing to the faculty of memory,” Dr. Starcke says,\r\n“childhood and youth involve a young man in such a web of associations\r\nthat he afterwards finds it hard to detach himself from them. The man\r\nwho, when married, has lived as a stranger in the house of another,\r\nclings to the impressions of his former home, and his earlier household\r\ncompanions become his heirs. But the brother who has wandered elsewhere\r\nstands in a more remote relation to his sister than do the sisters and\r\nthe children living with her in the parental home, and he is therefore\r\nexcluded from the inheritance.”[601]\r\n\r\nThough agreeing, in the main, with Dr. Starcke’s hypothesis, I do not\r\nthink it affords a complete explanation of the matter. It certainly\r\naccounts for the fact that, under the maternal system, it is just the\r\nnearest relatives on the mother’s side who are a man’s heirs, to the\r\nexclusion of other members of the clan. But, if succession really\r\ndepended upon local relations only, or upon the remembrance of such\r\nrelations in the past, it would be the most natural arrangement,\r\nwhere father and children lived together till the latter were grown\r\nup, for the father to be succeeded by his son. It seems probable that\r\nthe causes which make children take their mother’s name, have also\r\ndirectly exercised some influence upon the rules of succession; but I\r\nam inclined to believe that the power of the name itself has been of\r\nthe highest importance in that respect.\r\n\r\nBy means of family names former connections are kept up, and the past\r\nis associated with the present. Even we ourselves are generally more\r\ndisposed to count kin with distant relatives having our own surname\r\nthan with those having another. And upon man in a savage state language\r\nexercises, in this matter, a much greater influence than upon us. With\r\nreference to the aborigines of Western Australia, Sir George Grey\r\nobserves, “Obligations of family names are much stronger than those\r\nof blood;” and a “Saurian,” or a “Serpent,” from the East considers\r\nhimself related to a “Saurian,” or a “Serpent,” from the West, though\r\nno such relationship may exist.[602] Among the Ossetes, according\r\nto Baron von Haxthausen, a man is considered more nearly related to\r\na cousin a hundred times removed, who bears his name, than to his\r\nmother’s brother; and he is bound to take blood revenge for the former,\r\nwhile the latter is in fact not regarded as a relative at all.[603]\r\nSpeaking of certain Bantu tribes, Mr. McCall Theal remarks that their\r\naversion to incestuous marriages is so strong, that a man will not\r\nmarry a girl who belongs to another tribe, if she has the same family\r\nname as himself, although the relationship cannot be traced.[604] Is\r\nit not a justifiable presumption that a similar association of ideas\r\nhas influenced the rules of succession also,—all the more so, where\r\ncommunity of name implies community of worship as well? It should be\r\nobserved that in every case—at least so far as I know—where rank and\r\nproperty are inherited through females only, children are named after\r\nthe mother,—but not _vice versa_, thanks to the direct influence of\r\nlocal and other connections. In China, a man is even strictly forbidden\r\nto nominate as his heir an individual of a different surname.[605]\r\n\r\nIt is a difficult, sometimes even a hopeless, task to try to find out\r\nthe origin of savage laws and customs, and I do not pretend to have\r\ngiven an exhaustive explanation of those in question. But it seems to\r\nbe sufficiently clear, from what has been said, that we have no right\r\nto ascribe them to uncertain paternity; nay, that such an assumption\r\nis not even probably true. No one has yet exhibited any general\r\ncoincidence of what we consider moral and immoral habits with the\r\nprevalence of the male and female line among existing savages. Among\r\nthe Barea, for instance, as among the Negroes of Loango, inheritance\r\ngoes through mothers only, though adultery is said to be extremely\r\nrare;[606] whilst, on the other hand, among the wanton natives of\r\nTahiti, possessions always descend to the eldest son. With the Todas\r\nand Tibetans, among whom paternity is often actually uncertain on\r\naccount of their polyandrous marriage customs, succession runs through\r\nthe male line only. “If one or more women,” Mr. Marshall says with\r\nreference to the former, “are in common to several men, each husband\r\nconsiders all the children as his—though each woman is mother only\r\nto her own—and each male child is an heir to the property of all of\r\nthe fathers.”[607] Among the Reddies, a son—although it often happens\r\nthat he does not know his real father—is the heir of his mother’s\r\nhusband.[608] And, in India and Ceylon, female kinship is associated\r\nwith polyandry of the _beena_ type—where the husbands come to live\r\nwith the wife in or near the house of her birth; and male kinship with\r\nthat of the _deega_ type—where the wife goes to live in the house and\r\nvillage of her husband.[609]\r\n\r\nLastly, as Mr. Spencer remarks, avowed recognition of kinship in the\r\nfemale line only, shows by no means an unconsciousness of male kinship.\r\nAs a proof of this may be adduced the converse custom which the early\r\nRomans had of recognizing no legal relationship between children of the\r\nsame mother and of different fathers. For, if it cannot be supposed\r\nthat an actual unconsciousness of motherhood was associated with this\r\nsystem, neither is there any adequate warrant for the supposition that\r\nactual unconsciousness of fatherhood was associated with the system of\r\n“kinship through females only” among savages.[610]\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of the female line would not presuppose general\r\npromiscuity even if, in some cases, it were dependent on uncertainty as\r\nto fathers.[611] The separation of husband and wife, adultery on the\r\nwoman’s side, and the practice of lending wives to visitors occurring\r\nvery frequently among many savage nations, the proverb which says, “It\r\nis a wise child that knows his own father,” holds true for a large\r\nnumber of them. According to Mr. Ingham, the Bakongo, who trace their\r\ndescent through the mother only, assert as a reason for this custom\r\nuncertain paternity; but nevertheless, as we have already seen, they\r\nwould be horrified at the idea of promiscuous intercourse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving now examined all the groups of social phenomena adduced as\r\nevidence for the hypothesis of promiscuity, we have found that, in\r\npoint of fact, they are no evidence. Not one of the customs alleged as\r\nrelics of an ancient state of indiscriminate cohabitation of the sexes,\r\nor “communal marriage,” presupposes the former existence of that\r\nstate. The numerous facts put forward in support of the hypothesis do\r\nnot entitle us to assume that promiscuity has ever been the prevailing\r\nform of sexual relations among a single people, far less that it has\r\nconstituted a general stage in the social development of man, and,\r\nleast of all, that such a stage formed the starting-point of all human\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIt may seem to the reader that this question has received more\r\nattention than it deserves. But I have discussed it so fully not only\r\nbecause of the importance of the subject, but because of the insight\r\nthe customs mentioned give us into sexual and family relations very\r\ndifferent from our own, and because the unscientific character of the\r\nconclusions we have tested shows most clearly that sociology is still a\r\nscience in its infancy.\r\n\r\nEven now my criticism is not finished. Having shown that the hypothesis\r\nof promiscuity has no foundation in fact, I shall endeavour, in the\r\nnext chapter, to demonstrate that it is opposed to all the correct\r\nideas we are able to form with regard to the early condition of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nA CRITICISM OF THE HYPOTHESIS OF PROMISCUITY\r\n\r\n(_Concluded_)\r\n\r\n\r\nAgainst the hypothesis of promiscuity Sir Henry Maine has urged that\r\na good deal of evidence seems to show that promiscuous intercourse\r\nbetween the sexes tends to a pathological condition very unfavourable\r\nto fecundity; and “infecundity, amid perpetually belligerent savages,\r\nimplies weakness and ultimate destruction.”[612]\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter refers to the efforts of the American planters to form\r\nthe negroes into families, as the promiscuity into which they were\r\nliable to fall produced infertility, and fertility had become important\r\nto the slave-owners through the prohibition of the slave-trade.[613] It\r\nis also a well-known fact that prostitutes very seldom have children,\r\nwhile, according to Dr. Roubaud, those of them who marry young easily\r\nbecome mothers.[614] “Il ne pousse pas d’herbe dans les chemins où\r\ntout le monde passe,” Dr. Bertillon remarks.[615] And, in a community\r\nwhere all the women equally belonged to all the men, the younger and\r\nprettier ones would of course be most sought after, and take up a\r\nposition somewhat akin to that of the prostitutes of modern society.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be urged that the practice of polyandry prevails among\r\nseveral peoples without any evil results as regards fecundity being\r\nheard of. But polyandry scarcely ever implies continued promiscuous\r\nintercourse of many men with one woman. In Tibet, for example, where\r\nthe brothers of a family very often have a common wife, more than one\r\nare seldom at home at the same time.[616] Mr. Talboys Wheeler has\r\neven suggested that polyandry arose among a pastoral people, whose\r\nmen were away from their families for months at a time, so that the\r\nduty of protecting these families would naturally be undertaken by\r\nthe brothers in turn.[617] Again, among the Kaniagmuts, the second\r\nhusband was only a deputy who acted as husband and master of the house\r\nduring the absence of the true lord;[618] and the same was the case\r\nin Nukahiva.[619] But especially remarkable is the following practice\r\nconnected with polyandry. In the description given by Bontier and Le\r\nVerrier of the conquest and conversion of the Canarians in 1402 by\r\nJean de Bethencourt we read that, in the island of Lancerote, most of\r\nthe women have three husbands, “who wait upon them alternately by\r\nmonths; the husband that is to live with the wife the following month\r\nwaits upon her and upon her other husband the whole of the month that\r\nthe latter has her, and so each takes her in turn.”[620] Mr. Harkness\r\ntells us about a Toda who, having referred to his betrothal to his wife\r\nPilluvāni and the subsequent betrothal of the latter to two others,\r\nKhakhood and Tūmbut, said, “Now, according to our customs, Pilluvāni\r\nwas to pass the first month with me, the second with Khakhood, and the\r\nthird with Tūmbut.”[621] Among the Kulus, in the Himalaya Mountains,\r\nwhen parents sell a daughter to several brothers, she belongs during\r\nthe first month to the eldest brother, during the second to the next\r\neldest, and so on;[622] whilst, as regards the Nairs, whose women,\r\nexcept those of the first quality, may marry twelve husbands if they\r\npleased. Hamilton states that “all the husbands agree very well, for\r\nthey cohabit with her in their turns, according to their priority of\r\nmarriage, ten days, more or less, according as they can fix a term\r\namong themselves.”[623]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe strongest argument against ancient promiscuity is, however, to be\r\nderived from the psychical nature of man and other mammals. Mr. Darwin\r\nremarks that from what we know of the jealousy of all male quadrupeds,\r\narmed, as many of them are, with special weapons for battling with\r\ntheir rivals, promiscuous intercourse is utterly unlikely to prevail\r\nin a state of nature. “Therefore,” he continues, “looking far enough\r\nback in the stream of time, and judging from the social habits of man\r\nas he now exists, the most probable view is that he aboriginally lived\r\nin small communities, each with a single wife, or if powerful with\r\nseveral, whom he jealously guarded against all other men.”[624] Yet,\r\naccording to the same naturalist, it seems certain, from the lines of\r\nevidence afforded by Mr. Morgan, Mr. McLennan, and Sir J. Lubbock, that\r\nalmost promiscuous intercourse at a later time was extremely common\r\nthroughout the world;[625] and a similar view is held by some other\r\nwriters.[626] But if jealousy can be proved to be universally prevalent\r\nin the human race at the present day, it is impossible to believe that\r\nthere ever was a time when man was devoid of that powerful feeling.\r\nProfessor Giraud-Teulon[627] and Dr. Le Bon[628] assert, indeed, that\r\nit is unknown among almost all civilized peoples; but this assertion\r\nwill be found to be groundless.\r\n\r\nStarting from the very lowest races of men: we are told that the\r\nFuegians “are exceedingly jealous of their women, and will not\r\nallow any one, if they can help it, to enter their huts, particularly\r\nboys.”[629] Several writers assert the same as regards the\r\nAustralians.[630] Thus, according to Sir George Grey, “a stern and\r\nvigilant jealousy is commonly felt by every married man;”[631] and Mr.\r\nCurr states that, in most tribes, a woman “is not allowed to converse\r\nor have any relations whatever with any adult male, save her husband.\r\nEven with a grown-up brother she is always forbidden to exchange a\r\nword.”[632] With reference to the Veddahs of Ceylon, Mr. Bailey says\r\nthat, with the very smallest cause, the men are exceedingly jealous of\r\ntheir most unattractive wives, and are very careful to keep them apart\r\nfrom their companions.[633]\r\n\r\nAccording to a Thlinket myth, the jealousy of man is older than the\r\nworld itself. There was an age, it is supposed, when men groped in the\r\ndark in search of the world. At that time a Thlinket lived who had a\r\nwife and sister; and he was so jealous of his wife, that he killed all\r\nhis sister’s children because they looked at her.[634]\r\n\r\nGreat jealousy is met with among the Atkha Aleuts, according to\r\nFather Yakof; among the Kutchin Indians, according to Richardson and\r\nHardisty; among the Haidahs, according to Dixon; among the Tacullis,\r\naccording to Harmon; among the Crees, according to Richardson.[635]\r\nThe Indians on the Eastern side of the Rocky Mountains visited by\r\nHarmon, in their fits of jealousy, “often cut off all the hair from\r\nthe heads of their wives, and, not unfrequently, cut off their noses\r\nalso; and should they not in the moment of passion have a knife at\r\nhand, they will snap it off at one bite, with their teeth.... The man\r\nis satisfied in thus revenging a supposed injury; and having destroyed\r\nthe beauty of his wife, he concludes that he has secured her against\r\nall future solicitations to offend.”[636] In California, if a married\r\nnative woman is seen even walking in the forest with another man\r\nthan her husband, she is chastised by him, whilst a repetition of\r\nthe offence is generally punished with speedy death.[637] Among the\r\nCreeks, “it was formerly reckoned adultery, if a man took a pitcher\r\nof water off a married woman’s head, and drank of it.”[638] The Moquis\r\nallow their wives to work only indoors, afraid of having rivals.[639]\r\nThe Arawaks,[640] as also the Indians of Peru,[641] are stated to\r\ncommit horrible crimes of jealousy. The Botocudos, who are known to\r\nchange wives very frequently, are, nevertheless, much addicted to that\r\npassion.[642] And, regarding the Coroados of Brazil, v. Spix and v.\r\nMartius say that revenge and jealousy are the only passions that can\r\nrouse their stunted soul from its moody indifference.[643]\r\n\r\nIn the Sandwich Islands, according to Lisiansky, jealousy was extremely\r\nprevalent,[644] and, in Nukahiva, the men punish their wives with\r\nseverity upon the least suspicion of infidelity.[645] The Areois of\r\nTahiti, too, although given to every kind of licentiousness, are\r\ndescribed by Ellis as utterly jealous.[646] The same is said of the\r\nNew Caledonians and New Zealanders;[647] whilst, in the Pelew Islands,\r\nit is forbidden even to speak about another man’s wife or mention her\r\nname.[648] In short, the South Sea Islanders are, as Mr. Macdonald\r\nremarks, generally jealous of the chastity of their wives.[649]\r\n\r\nAmong the Malays of Sumatra, the husband jealously guards his wife\r\nas long as his affection lasts;[650] and, concerning several other\r\ntribes of the Indian Archipelago, Riedel says that the men are very\r\nmuch addicted to the same passion.[651] Captain Arnesen observed the\r\ngreat jealousy of the Samoyedes.[652] Dr. A. O. Heikel informs me that\r\na Tartar may repudiate his wife if he sees her shaking hands with a\r\nman. Among the nomadic Koriaks, many wives are killed by passionate\r\nhusbands. Hence their women endeavour to be very ugly: they refrain\r\nfrom dressing their hair or washing, and walk about ragged, as the\r\nhusbands take for granted that, if they dress themselves, they do so in\r\norder to attract admirers.[653]\r\n\r\nAmong the Beni-Mzab, a man who speaks in the street to a married\r\nwoman of quality is punished with a fine of two hundred francs and\r\nbanishment for four years.[654] In the Nile countries and many other\r\nparts of Africa, it is customary for the men to preserve the fidelity\r\nof their wives in a way not unlike a method used in the age of the\r\nCrusades.[655] With reference to the inhabitants of Fida, Bosman tells\r\nus that a rich negro will not suffer any man to enter the houses where\r\nhis wives reside, and on the least suspicion will sell them to the\r\nEuropeans;[656] whilst in Dahomey, if a wayfarer meets any of the royal\r\nwives on the road, a bell warns him “to turn off or stand against a\r\nwall while they pass.”[657]\r\n\r\nThat jealousy is a powerful agent in the social life of civilized\r\nnations is a fact which it is unnecessary to dwell upon. In Mohammedan\r\ncountries, a woman is not allowed to receive male visitors, or to go\r\nout unveiled,[658] it being unlawful for the Moslem to see the faces\r\nof any other women than those whom he is forbidden to marry and his\r\nown wives and female slaves.[659] A man who penetrates into the harem\r\nof another man may easily lose his life; and Dr. Polak states that, in\r\nPersia, a European physician cannot, without being considered indecent,\r\neven ask about the health of a Mohammedan’s wife and daughter, though\r\nthey are ill.[660] Again, in Japan, as I am told by a native of the\r\ncountry, it was customary for women when getting married, to have\r\ntheir eyebrows shaved off, because thick and beautiful eyebrows are\r\nconsidered one of a woman’s greatest ornaments. At the same time,\r\naccording to Mr. Balfour, their teeth are stained black, which can only\r\nhave the effect of making the wife less attractive to the husband,—as\r\nwell as to other men.[661] This reminds us of the wide-spread practice\r\nof depriving a woman of her ornaments as soon as she is married.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of jealousy in the human race is best shown by the\r\npunishments inflicted for adultery; although it may be that the\r\nproprietary feeling here plays an important part. In a savage country a\r\nseducer may be thankful if he escapes by paying to the injured husband\r\nthe value of the bride or some other fine, or if the penalty is reduced\r\nto a flogging, to his head being shaved, his ears cut off, one of his\r\neyes destroyed, his legs speared, &c., &c. He must consider himself\r\nvery lucky if he is merely paid in his own coin, or if the punishment\r\nfalls on his wife, who, in that case, seems to be looked upon as the\r\nreal cause of her husband’s unfaithfulness.[662] Most commonly, among\r\nuncivilized nations, the seducer is killed, adultery on the woman’s\r\nside being considered a heinous crime, for which nothing but the\r\ndeath of the offender can atone. Among the Waganda, it is, as a rule,\r\npunished even more severely than murder;[663] and, in parts of New\r\nGuinea, capital punishment is said to be almost unknown except for\r\nadultery.[664]\r\n\r\nMr. Reade remarks that, among savages generally, it is the seducer who\r\nsuffers, not the victim.[665] Yet this holds good for certain peoples\r\nonly,[666] the faithless wife being generally discarded, beaten, or\r\nill-treated in some other way, and very frequently killed. Often, too,\r\nshe is disfigured by her jealous husband, so that no man may fall in\r\nlove with her in future. Thus, among several peoples of North America,\r\nIndia, and elsewhere, her nose is cut or bitten off,—a practice which\r\nalso prevailed in ancient Egypt.[667] As late as the year 1120 the\r\nCouncil of Neapolis in Palestine decreed that an adulterer should be\r\ncastrated, and the nose of an unfaithful wife cut off;[668] whilst, in\r\nthe “Uplands-lag,” an old Swedish provincial law, it is prescribed\r\nthat an adulteress who cannot pay the fine of forty marks, shall lose\r\nher hair, ears, and nose.[669] The Creeks and some Chittagong Hill\r\ntribes likewise cut off the ears of a woman who has been guilty of\r\ninfidelity;[670] and many other people are in the habit of shaving her\r\nhead.[671]\r\n\r\nAmong a large number of peoples, a husband not only requires chastity\r\nfrom his wife, but demands that the woman whom he marries shall be a\r\nvirgin. There can be little doubt, I think, that this requirement owes\r\nits origin to the same powerful feeling that keeps watch over marital\r\nfaithfulness.\r\n\r\nAmong the Ahts, for example, “a girl who was known to have lost her\r\nvirtue, lost with it one of her chances of a favourable marriage.”[672]\r\nAmong the Chippewas, according to Mr. Keating, no woman could expect\r\nto be taken as a wife by a warrior unless she had lived in strict\r\nchastity.[673] Statements to the same effect are made with reference\r\nto other Indian tribes.[674] Again, when one of the Chichimecs of\r\nCentral Mexico marries, if the girl proves not to be a virgin, she may\r\nbe returned to her parents.[675] A very similar custom prevailed among\r\nthe Nicaraguans and Azteks,[676] and exist still among several tribes\r\nof the Indian Archipelago and in New Guinea;[677] whilst, in Samoa,\r\nvaluable presents were given for a girl who had preserved her virtue,\r\nthe bride’s purity being proved in a way that will not bear the light\r\nof description.[678]\r\n\r\n“In many parts of Africa,” says Mr. Reade, “no marriage can be\r\nratified till a jury of matrons have pronounced a verdict of purity\r\non the bride;[679] it being customary to return a girl who is found\r\nnot to have been entirely chaste, and to claim back the price paid\r\nfor her.[680] Dr. Grade states that among the Negroes of Togoland, a\r\nmuch higher price is paid for a bride who is a virgin than for any\r\nother.[681] Among the Somals, a fallen girl cannot become a man’s\r\nlegitimate wife;[682] whilst, in the Soudan and other parts of Africa\r\nwhere girls are subjected to infibulation, that incontinence may be\r\nmade impossible, no young woman who is not infibulated can get a\r\nhusband.[683]\r\n\r\nThe Jewish custom of handing “the tokens of the damsel’s virginity”\r\nto her parents, to be kept as evidence in case of a later accusation,\r\nis well-known.[684] A practice not very dissimilar to this prevails in\r\nChina,[685] Arabia,[686] and among the Chuvashes,[687] with whom the\r\n_signum innocentiae_ is exhibited even _coram populo_. In Persia,[688]\r\nas also in Circassia,[689] a girl who is not a virgin when she marries,\r\nruns the risk of being put away after the first night. Among several\r\nnations belonging to the Russian Empire, according to Georgi, the\r\nbridegroom may claim a fine in case of the bride being found to have\r\nlost her virtue;[690] and, among the Chulims, if the Mosaic testimony\r\nof chastity is wanting, the husband goes away and does not return\r\nbefore the seducer has made peace with him.[691] As to the ancient\r\nGermans, Tacitus states that, by their laws, virgins only could\r\nmarry.[692]\r\n\r\nA husband’s pretensions may reach even farther than this. He often\r\ndemands that the woman he chooses for his wife shall belong to him, not\r\nduring his lifetime only, but after his death.\r\n\r\nThe belief in another life is almost universal in the human race. As\r\nthat life is supposed to resemble this, man having the same necessities\r\nthere as here, part of his property is buried with him. And so strong\r\nis the idea of a wife being the exclusive property of her husband,\r\nthat, among several peoples, she may not even survive him.\r\n\r\nThus, formerly, among the Comanches, when a man died, his favourite\r\nwife was killed at the same time.[693] In certain Californian tribes,\r\nwidows were sacrificed on the pyre with their deceased husbands;[694]\r\nand Mackenzie was told that this practice sometimes occurred among\r\nthe Crees.[695] In Darien and Panama, on the death of a chief, all\r\nhis concubines were interred with him.[696] When one of the Incas\r\ndied, says Acosta, the woman whom he had loved best, as well as his\r\nservants and officers, were put to death, “that they might serve him\r\nin the other life.”[697] The same custom prevailed in the region of the\r\nCongo, as also in some other African countries.[698] “It is no longer\r\npossible to doubt,” says Dr. Schrader, “that ancient Indo-Germanic\r\ncustom ordained that the wife should die with her husband.”[699] In\r\nIndia, as is well known, widows were sacrificed, until quite recently,\r\non the funeral pile of their husbands;[700] whilst, among the Tartars,\r\naccording to Navarette, on a man’s death, one of his wives hanged\r\nherself “to bear him company in that journey.” Among the Chinese,\r\nsomething of the same kind seems to have been done occasionally in\r\nolden times.[701]\r\n\r\nTurning to other quarters of the world: in Polynesia, and especially\r\nin Melanesia, widows were very commonly killed.[702] In Fiji, for\r\ninstance, they were either buried alive or strangled, often at their\r\nown desire, because they believed that in this way alone could they\r\nreach the realms of bliss, and that she who met her death with the\r\ngreatest devotedness, would become the favourite wife in the abode\r\nof spirits. On the other hand, a widow who did not permit herself to\r\nbe killed was considered an adulteress.[703] In the New Hebrides,\r\naccording to the missionary John Inglis, a wife is strangled, even when\r\nher husband is long absent from home.[704]\r\n\r\nIf the husband’s demands are less severe, his widow is not on that\r\naccount always exempted from every duty towards him after his death.\r\nAmong the Tacullies, she is compelled by the kinsfolk of the deceased\r\nto lie on the funeral pile where the body of her husband is placed,\r\nwhilst the fire is lighting, until the heat becomes unbearable. Then,\r\nafter the body is consumed, she is obliged to collect the ashes and\r\ndeposit them in a small basket, which she must always carry about\r\nwith her for two or three years, during which time she is not at\r\nliberty to marry again.[705] Among the Kutchin Indians, the widow, or\r\nwidows, are bound to remain near the body for a year to protect it\r\nfrom animals, &c.; and only when it is quite decayed and merely the\r\nbones remain, are they permitted to remarry, “to dress their hair,\r\nand put on beads and other ornaments to attract admirers.”[706] Again,\r\namong the Minas on the Slave Coast, the widows are shut up for six\r\nmonths in the room where their husband is buried.[707] With the Kukis,\r\naccording to Rennel, a widow was compelled to remain for a year beside\r\nthe tomb of her deceased husband, her family bringing her food.[708]\r\nIn the Mosquito tribe, “the widow was bound to supply the grave of\r\nher husband with provisions for a year, after which she took up the\r\nbones and carried them with her for another year, at last placing them\r\nupon the roof of her house, and then only was she allowed to marry\r\nagain.”[709]\r\n\r\nIn Rotuma and the Marquesas Islands,[710] as well as among the Tartars\r\nand Iroquois,[711] a widow was never allowed to enter a second time\r\ninto the married state. Among the ancient Peruvians, says Garcilasso\r\nde la Vega, very few widows who had no children ever married again,\r\nand even widows who had children continued to live single; “for this\r\nvirtue was much commended in their laws and ordinances.”[712] Nor is it\r\nin China considered proper for a widow to contract a second marriage,\r\nand in genteel families such an event rarely, if ever, occurs. Indeed,\r\na lady of rank, by contracting a second marriage, exposes herself\r\nto a penalty of eighty blows.[713] Again, the Arabs, according to\r\nBurckhardt, regard everything connected with the nuptials of a widow\r\nas ill-omened, and unworthy of the participation of generous and\r\nhonourable men.[714]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Aryans, Dr. Schrader remarks that, when sentiments\r\nhad become more humane, traces of the old state of things survived in\r\nthe prohibitions issued against the second marriage of widows.[715]\r\nEven now, according to Dubois, the happiest lot that can befall a\r\nHindu woman, particularly one of the Brahman caste, is to die in the\r\nmarried state. The bare mention of a second marriage for her would be\r\nconsidered the greatest of insults, and, if she married again, “she\r\nwould be hunted out of society, and no decent person would venture at\r\nany time to have the slightest intercourse with her.”[716] Again, among\r\nthe Bhills, when a widow marries, the newly-wedded pair, according\r\nto a long-established custom, are obliged to leave the house before\r\ndaybreak and pass the next day in the fields, in a solitary place,\r\nsome miles from the village, nor may they return till the dusk. The\r\nnecessity of the couple passing the first day of their marriage in\r\nthis way, like outcasts, is, writes Sir J. Malcolm, “to mark that\r\nsense of degradation which all the natives of Hindustan entertain\r\nagainst a woman marrying a second husband.”[717] The South Slavonians,\r\nsays Krauss, regard a widow’s remarriage as an insult to her former\r\nconsort;[718] and a similar view prevailed in ancient Greece, according\r\nto Pausanias,[719] and among the Romans.[720] The early Christians,\r\nalso, strongly disapproved of second marriages by persons of either\r\nsex, although St. Paul had peremptorily urged that the younger widows\r\nshould marry.[721] Indeed the practice of second nuptials was branded\r\nwith the name of a legal adultery, and the persons who were guilty of\r\nso scandalous an offence against Christian purity were soon excluded\r\nfrom the honours and even from the alms of the Church.[722]\r\n\r\nMuch more commonly, however, the prohibition of a second marriage\r\nrefers only to a certain period after the husband’s death. Thus, among\r\nthe Chickasaws, widows were obliged to live a chaste single life for\r\nthree years at the risk of the law of adultery being executed against\r\nthe recusants;[723] whilst, among the Creeks, a widow was looked upon\r\nas an adulteress if she spoke or made free with any man within four\r\nsummers after the death of her husband.[724] Among the Old Kukis,\r\nwidowers and widows could not marry within three years, and then\r\nonly with the permission of the family of the deceased.[725] Among\r\nthe Kunáma, too, the period of widowhood must not be shorter than\r\nthree years, in Saraë not less than two.[726] The Arawaks, British\r\nColumbians, and Mandans required that the head of the widow should be\r\nshaved, and she was not permitted to marry again before her shorn locks\r\nregained their wonted length.[727] Among the Hovas, Ainos, Patagonians,\r\n&c., the widow has to live a single life for a year at least after her\r\nhusband’s death,[728] and among some other peoples for six months.[729]\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be supposed that the object of these prohibitions is to\r\nremove all apprehensions as to pregnancy. But this cannot be the case\r\nwhen the time of mourning lasts for a year or more. In Saraë, where a\r\nwidow is bound to celibacy for two years, a divorced wife is prevented\r\nfrom marrying within two months only, as Munzinger says, “in order to\r\navoid all uncertainty as to pregnancy;”[730] and, among the Bedouins,\r\na divorced woman has, for the same reason, to remain unmarried for no\r\nlonger time than forty days.[731] Moreover, certain peoples, especially\r\nthose among whom monogamy is the only recognized form of marriage, or\r\namong whom polygyny is practised as a rare exception, prohibit the\r\nspeedy remarriage not only of widows but of widowers.[732]\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the interdict appears also from the common rule that\r\na wife, after her husband’s death, shall give up all her ornaments,\r\nand have her head shaved, her hair cut short, or her face blackened.\r\nAmong certain Indians, the law compels the widow through the long term\r\nof her mourning to refrain from all public company and diversions,\r\nunder pain of being considered an adulteress, and, likewise to go with\r\nflowing hair without the privilege of oil to anoint it;[733] whilst, in\r\nGreenland tales, it is said of a truly disconsolate widow, “She mourns\r\nso, that she cannot be recognised for dirt.”[734]\r\n\r\nHence we see how deep-rooted is the idea that a woman belongs\r\nexclusively to one man. Savages believe that the soul of the deceased\r\ncan return and become a tormentor of the living. Thus a husband, even\r\nafter his death, may punish a wife who has proved unfaithful.\r\n\r\nAccording to travellers’ statements, there are, indeed, peoples\r\nalmost devoid of the feeling of jealousy, and the practice of lending\r\nor prostituting wives is generally taken as evidence of this. But\r\njealousy, as well as love, is far from being the same feeling in\r\nthe mind of a savage as in that of a civilized man. A wife is often\r\nregarded as not very different from other property, and an adulterer as\r\na thief.[735] In some parts of Africa, he is punished as such, having\r\nhis hands, or one of them, cut off.[736] The fact that a man lends his\r\nwife to a visitor no more implies the absence of jealousy than other\r\nways of showing hospitality imply that he is without the proprietary\r\nfeeling. According to Wilkes, the aborigines of New South Wales “will\r\nfrequently give one of their wives to a friend who may be in want of\r\none; but notwithstanding this laxity they are extremely jealous, and\r\nare very prompt to resent any freedom taken with their wives.”[737]\r\n\r\nA married woman is never permitted to cohabit with any man but the\r\nhusband, except with the husband’s permission; and this permission\r\nis given only as an act of hospitality or friendship, or as a means\r\nof profit. When we are told that a negro husband uses his wife for\r\nentrapping other men and making them pay a heavy fine;[738] that, among\r\nthe Crees, adultery is considered no crime “provided the husband\r\nreceives a valuable consideration for his wife’s prostitution;”[739] or\r\nthat, in Nukahiva, husbands sometimes offer their wives to foreigners\r\n“from their ardent desire of possessing iron, or other European\r\narticles,”[740]—we must not infer from this profligacy that jealousy\r\nis unknown to man at early stages of civilization. On the contrary,\r\nsuch practices are due chiefly to contact with “higher culture,” which\r\noften has the effect of misleading natural instincts. “Husbands,\r\nafter the degradation of a pseudo-civilization,” says Mr. Bonwick,\r\n“are sometimes found ready to barter the virtue of a wife for a piece\r\nof tobacco, a morsel of bread, or a silver sixpence.”[741] Mr. Curr\r\nobserves that, among the Australian natives, “husbands display much\r\nless jealousy of white men than of those of their own colour,” and that\r\nthey will more commonly prostitute their wives to strangers visiting\r\nthe tribe than to their own people.[742] “Under no circumstances,”\r\nsays Sir George Grey, “is a strange native allowed to approach the\r\nfire of a married man.”[743] According to Bosman, the Negroes of Benin\r\nwere very jealous of their wives with their own countrymen, though\r\nnot in the least with European foreigners;[744] and Lisiansky states\r\nexactly the same as regards the Sandwich Islanders.[745] In California,\r\nsays Mr. Powers, “since the advent of the Americans the husband often\r\ntraffics in his wife’s honour for gain, and even forces her to infamy\r\nwhen unwilling; though in early days he would have slain her without\r\npity and without remorse for the same offence.”[746] The like is true\r\nof the Columbians about Puget Sound;[747] and Georgi remarks that\r\nthe nomadic Koriaks torment their wives by their jealousy, sometimes\r\neven killing them from this passion; whereas those Koriaks who lead a\r\nstationary life, being far more advanced in civilization, are so little\r\naddicted to it, that they even have a relish for seeing foreigners make\r\nlove to their wives, whom they dress accordingly.[748]\r\n\r\nIf the hypothesis of an annual pairing time in the infancy of mankind\r\nholds good, jealousy must at that stage have been a passion of very\r\ngreat intensity.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be supposed that this feeling, though belonging to\r\nhuman nature, has been restrained by certain conditions which have\r\nmade it necessary, or desirable, for a man to share his wife with\r\nother men. Thus polyandry now prevails in several parts of the world.\r\nBut I shall endeavour to show, later on, that this practice is due\r\nchiefly to scarcity of women, and commonly implies an act of fraternal\r\nbenevolence, the eldest and first married brother in a family giving\r\nhis younger brothers a share in his wife, if they would otherwise be\r\nobliged to live unmarried. Hence polyandry can by no means, as Mr.\r\nMcLennan suggests, be regarded as “a modification of and advance from\r\npromiscuity.” It owes its origin to causes, or a cause, which never\r\nwould have produced general communism in women. Besides, it can be\r\nproved that polyandry is abhorrent to the rudest races of men.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested, too, that man’s gregarious way of living made\r\npromiscuity necessary. The men of a group, it is said, must either have\r\nquarrelled about their women and separated, splitting the horde into\r\nhostile sections, or indulged in promiscuous intercourse. But it is\r\nhard to understand why tribal organization in olden times should have\r\nprevented a man having his special wife, since it does not do so among\r\nsavages still existing. Primitive law is the law of might; and it is\r\nimpossible to believe that the stronger men, who generally succeeded\r\nin getting the most comely women, voluntarily gave their weaker\r\nrivals a share in their precious capture. Regarding the aborigines\r\nof Queensland, Lumholtz states that as a rule, it is difficult for\r\nmen to marry before they are thirty years of age, the old men having\r\nthe youngest and best-looking wives, while a young man must consider\r\nhimself fortunate if he can get an old woman.[749] It more commonly\r\nhappens among savages, however, that almost every full-grown man is\r\nable to get a wife for himself; and when this is the case, there is\r\nstill less reason for assuming communism in women.\r\n\r\nIt is not, of course, impossible that, among some peoples, intercourse\r\nbetween the sexes may have been almost promiscuous. But there is not a\r\nshred of genuine evidence for the notion that promiscuity ever formed\r\na general stage in the social history of mankind. The hypothesis\r\nof promiscuity, instead of belonging, as Professor Giraud-Teulon\r\nthinks,[750] to the class of hypotheses which are scientifically\r\npermissible, has no real foundation, and is essentially unscientific.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE AND CELIBACY\r\n\r\n\r\nWith wild animals sexual desire is not less powerful as an incentive\r\nto strenuous exertion than hunger and thirst. In the rut-time, the\r\nmales even of the most cowardly species engage in mortal combats; and\r\nabstinence, or at least voluntary abstinence, is almost unheard of in a\r\nstate of nature.[751]\r\n\r\nAs regards savage and barbarous races of men, among whom the relations\r\nof the sexes under normal conditions take the form of marriage,\r\nnearly every individual strives to get married as soon as he, or she,\r\nreaches the age of puberty.[752] Hence there are far fewer bachelors\r\nand spinsters among them than among civilized peoples. Harmon found\r\nthat among the Blackfeet, Crees, Chippewyans, and other aboriginal\r\ntribes on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, celibacy was a rare\r\nexception;[753] and Ashe noted the same fact among the Shawanese.[754]\r\nPrescott states of the Dacotahs, “I do not know of a bachelor among\r\nthem. They have a little more respect for the women and themselves,\r\nthan to live a single life.”[755] Indeed, according to Adair, many\r\nIndian women thought virginity and widowhood the same as death.[756]\r\nAmong the Eastern Greenlanders, visited by Lieutenant Holm, only one\r\nunmarried woman was met with.[757]\r\n\r\nThe Charruas, says Azara, “ne restent jamais dans le célibat, et ils\r\nse marient aussitôt qu’ils sentent le besoin de cette union.”[758]\r\nAs regards the Yahgans, Mr. Bridges writes that “none but mutes and\r\nimbeciles remained single, except some lads of vigour who did so from\r\nchoice, influenced by licentiousness. But no woman remained unmarried;\r\nalmost immediately on her husband’s death the widow found another\r\nhusband.”\r\n\r\nAmong the wild nations of Southern Africa, according to Burchell,\r\nneither men nor women ever pass their lives in a state of\r\ncelibacy;[759] and Bosman assures us that very few negroes of the\r\nGold Coast died single, unless they were quite young.[760] Among the\r\nMandingoes, Caillié met with no instance of a young woman, pretty or\r\nplain, who had not a husband.[761] Barth reports that the Western\r\nTouaregs had no fault to find with him except that he lived in\r\ncelibacy; they could not even understand how this was possible.[762]\r\n\r\nAmong the Sinhalese there are hardly any old bachelors and old\r\nmaids;[763] and Mr. Marshall says of the Todas, “No unmarried class\r\nexists, to disturb society with its loves and broils; ... it is a\r\n‘very much married’ people. Every man and every woman, every lad and\r\nevery girl is somebody’s husband or wife; tied at the earliest possible\r\nage.... With the exception of a cripple girl, and of those women who,\r\npast the child-bearing age, were widows, I did not meet with a single\r\ninstance of unmarried adult females.”[764] Among the Toungtha, it\r\nis unheard of for a man or woman to be unmarried after the age of\r\nthirty, and among the Chukmas, a bachelor twenty-five years old is\r\nrarely seen.[765] The Muásís consider it a father’s duty to fix upon\r\na bridegroom as soon as his daughter becomes marriageable.[766] Among\r\nthe Burmese[767] and the Hill Dyaks of Borneo,[768] old maids and old\r\nbachelors are alike unknown. Among the Sumatrans, too, instances of\r\npersons of either sex passing their lives in a state of celibacy are\r\nextremely rare:—“In the districts under my charge,” says Marsden,\r\n“are about eight thousand inhabitants, among whom I do not conceive\r\nit would be possible to find ten instances of men of the age of thirty\r\nyears unmarried.”[769] In Java, Mr. Crawfurd “never saw a woman of\r\ntwo-and-twenty that was not, or had not been, married.”[770] In Tonga,\r\naccording to Mariner, there were but few women who, from whim or\r\nsome accidental cause, remained single for life.[771] In Australia,\r\n“nearly all the girls are betrothed at a very early age;” and Mr.\r\nCurr never heard of a woman, over sixteen years of age, who, prior to\r\nthe breakdown of aboriginal customs after the coming of the Whites,\r\nhad not a husband.[772] As to the natives of Herbert River, Northern\r\nQueensland, Herr Lumholtz says that though the majority of the young\r\nmen have to wait a long time before they get wives, it is rare for a\r\nman to die unmarried.[773]\r\n\r\nIndeed, so indispensable does marriage seem to uncivilized man, that\r\na person who does not marry is looked upon almost as an unnatural\r\nbeing, or, at any rate, is disdained.[774] Among the Santals, if a\r\nman remains single, “he is at once despised by both sexes, and is\r\nclassed next to a thief, or a witch: they term the unhappy wretch\r\n‘No man.’”[775] Among the Kafirs, a bachelor has no voice in the\r\nkraal.[776] The Tipperahs, as we are told by Mr. J. F. Browne, do not\r\nconsider a man a person of any importance till he is married;[777]\r\nand, in the Tupi tribes, no man was suffered to partake of the\r\ndrinking-feast while he remained single.[778] The Fijians even believed\r\nthat he who died wifeless was stopped by the god Nangganangga on the\r\nroad to Paradise, and smashed to atoms.[779]\r\n\r\nIt may also be said that savages, as a rule, marry earlier in life\r\nthan civilized men. A Greenlander, says Dr. Nansen, often marries\r\nbefore there is any chance of the union being productive.[780] Among\r\nthe Californians, Mandans, and most of the north-western tribes in\r\nNorth America, marriage frequently takes place at the age of twelve\r\nor fourteen.[781] In the wild tribes of Central Mexico, girls are\r\nseldom unmarried after the age of fourteen or fifteen.[782] Among the\r\nTalamanca Indians, a bride is generally from ten to fourteen years old,\r\nwhilst a man seldom becomes a husband before fourteen.[783] In certain\r\nother Central American tribes, the parents try to get a wife for their\r\nson when he is nine or ten years old.[784]\r\n\r\nAmong the natives of Brazil, the man generally marries at the age of\r\nfrom fifteen to eighteen, the woman from ten to twelve.[785] According\r\nto Azara, the like was the case with the Guaranies of the Plata,\r\nwhilst, among the Guanas, “celle qui se marie le plus tard, se marie à\r\nneuf ans.”[786] In Tierra del Fuego, as we are informed by Lieutenant\r\nBove, a girl looks about for a husband when twelve or thirteen years\r\nold, and a youth marries at the age of from fourteen to sixteen.[787]\r\n\r\nMany African peoples, _e.g._, the Abyssinians,[788] the Beni-Amer,\r\nthe Djour tribes on the White Nile,[789] the Arabs of the Sahara, the\r\nWakamba, and the Ba-kwileh,[790] are likewise said to marry very young.\r\nMarriage usually takes place, among the Bongos when they are from\r\nfifteen to seventeen years old, but in many other tribes at an earlier\r\nage.[791]\r\n\r\nAmong the Sinhalese, when a young man has reached the age of eighteen\r\nor twenty, it is the duty of his father to provide him with a proper\r\nwife.[792] Among the Bodo and Dhimáls, “marriage takes place at\r\nmaturity, the male being usually from twenty to twenty-five years of\r\nage, and the female from fifteen to twenty.”[793] A Santal lad marries,\r\nas a rule, about the age of sixteen or seventeen, and a girl at that\r\nof fifteen;[794] whilst a Kandh boy marries when he reaches his tenth\r\nor twelfth year, his wife being usually about four years older.[795]\r\nThe Khyoungtha,[796] Munda Kols,[797] Red Karens,[798] Siamese,[799]\r\nBurmese,[800] Mongols,[801] and other Asiatic peoples, are also known\r\nto marry early. Among the Ainos, the young women are considered\r\nmarriageable at the age of sixteen or seventeen, and the men marry\r\nwhen about nineteen or twenty.[802] Again, among the Lake Dwellers of\r\nLob-nor, girls enter into matrimony at the age of fourteen or fifteen,\r\nmen at the same age, or a little later;[803] whilst, among the Malays,\r\naccording to Mr. Bickmore, the boys usually marry for the first time\r\nwhen about sixteen, and the girls at the age of thirteen or fourteen,\r\nand occasionally still earlier.[804]\r\n\r\nPassing to the Australian continent: among the natives of New South\r\nWales, the parties are in most cases betrothed very early in life, the\r\nyoung man claiming his wife later on, as soon as he arrives at the\r\nproper age.[805] According to Mr. Curr, “girls become wives at from\r\neight to fourteen years of age.”[806] At Port Moresby, New Guinea,\r\n“few men over twenty years of age remain single;” and the Maoris in\r\nNew Zealand are stated to marry very young.[807]\r\n\r\nMoreover, celibacy is comparatively rare not only among savage and\r\nbarbarous, but among several civilized races.\r\n\r\nAmong the Azteks, no young man lived single till his twenty-second\r\nyear, unless he intended to become a priest, and for girls the\r\ncustomary marrying-age was from eleven to eighteen. In Tlascala,\r\naccording to Clavigero, the unmarried state was, indeed, so despised\r\nthat a full-grown man who would not marry had his hair cut off for\r\nshame.[808] Again, among the ancient Peruvians, every year, or every\r\ntwo years, each governor in his district had to arrange for the\r\nmarriage of all the young men at the age of twenty-four and upwards,\r\nand all the girls from eighteen to twenty.[809]\r\n\r\nIn Japan, as I am told by a Japanese friend, old maids and old\r\nbachelors are almost entirely unknown, and the same is the case in\r\nChina.[810] “Almost all Chinese,” says Dr. Gray, “robust or infirm,\r\nwell-formed or deformed, are called upon by their parents to marry so\r\nsoon as they have attained the age of puberty. Were a grown-up son\r\nor daughter to die unmarried, the parents would regard it as most\r\ndeplorable.” Hence a young man of marriageable age, whom consumption\r\nor any other lingering disease had marked for its own, would be called\r\nupon by his parents or guardians to marry at once.[811] Nay, so\r\nindispensable is marriage considered among this people, that even the\r\ndead are married. Thus the spirits of all males who die in infancy, or\r\nin boyhood, are in due time married to the spirits of females who have\r\nbeen cut off at a like early age.[812]\r\n\r\nMarco Polo states the prevalence of the same practice among the\r\nTartars.[813] In Corea, says the Rev. John Ross, “the male human being\r\nwho is unmarried is never called a ‘man,’ whatever his age, but goes\r\nby the name of ‘yatow;’ a name given by the Chinese to unmarriageable\r\nyoung girls: and the ‘man’ of thirteen or fourteen has a perfect right\r\nto strike, abuse, order about the ‘yatow’ of thirty, who dares not as\r\nmuch as open his lips to complain.”[814]\r\n\r\nMohammedan peoples generally consider marriage a duty both for men and\r\nwomen.[815] “Nothing,” says Carsten Niebuhr, “is more rarely to be\r\nmet with in the East, than a woman unmarried after a certain time of\r\nlife.” She will rather marry a poor man, or become second wife to a man\r\nalready married, than remain in a state of celibacy.[816] Among the\r\nPersians, for instance, almost every girl of good repute is married\r\nbefore her twenty-first year, and old bachelors are unknown.[817] In\r\nEgypt, according to Mr. Lane, it is improper and even disreputable to\r\nabstain from marrying when a man has attained a sufficient age, and\r\nwhen there is no just impediment.[818]\r\n\r\nAmong the Hebrews, celibacy was nearly unheard of, as it is among the\r\nJews of our day. They have a proverb that “he who has no wife is no\r\nman.”[819] “To an ancient Israelite,” Michaelis remarks, “it would\r\nindeed have appeared very strange to have seen, though but in a vision,\r\na period in the future history of the world, when it would be counted\r\nsanctity and religion to live unmarried.”[820] Marriage was by the\r\nHebrews looked upon as a religious duty. According to the Talmud, the\r\nauthorities can compel a man to marry, and he who lives single at the\r\nage of twenty is accursed by God almost as if he were a murderer.[821]\r\n\r\nThe ancient nations of the Aryan stock, as M. Fustel de Coulanges\r\nand others have pointed out, regarded celibacy as an impiety and\r\na misfortune: “an impiety, because one who did not marry put the\r\nhappiness of the Manes of the family in peril; a misfortune, because he\r\nhimself would receive no worship after his death.” A man’s happiness\r\nin the next world depended upon his having a continuous line of male\r\ndescendants, whose duty it would be to make the periodical offerings\r\nfor the repose of his soul.[822]\r\n\r\nThus, according to the ‘Laws of Manu,’ marriage is the twelfth\r\nSanskāra, and hence a religious duty incumbent upon all.[823] “Until\r\nhe finds a wife, a man is only half of a whole,” we read in the\r\n‘Brahmadharma’;[824] and, among the Hindus of the present day, a man\r\nwho is not married is considered to be almost a useless member of\r\nsociety, and is, indeed, looked upon as beyond the pale of nature. It\r\nis also an established national rule, that women are designed for no\r\nother end than to be subservient to the wants and pleasures of men;\r\nconsequently, all women without exception are obliged to marry, when\r\nhusbands can be found for them, and those who cannot find a husband\r\ncommonly fall into the state of concubinage.[825] Among the ancient\r\nIranians, too, it was considered a matter of course that a girl should\r\nbe married on reaching the years of puberty.[826]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks regarded marriage as a matter not merely of private,\r\nbut also of public interest. This was particularly the case at Sparta,\r\nwhere criminal proceedings might be taken against those who married\r\ntoo late, and against those who did not marry at all. In Solon’s\r\nlegislation marriage was also placed under the inspection of the State,\r\nand, at Athens, persons who did not marry might be prosecuted, although\r\nthe law seems to have grown obsolete in later times. But independently\r\nof public considerations, there were private reasons which made\r\nmarriage an obligation.[827] Plato remarks that every individual is\r\nbound to provide for a continuance of representatives to succeed\r\nhimself as ministers of the Divinity;[828] and Isaeus says, “All they\r\nwho think their end approaching, look forward with a prudent care that\r\ntheir houses may not become desolate, but that there may be some person\r\nto attend to their funeral rites, and to perform the legal ceremonies\r\nat their tombs.”[829]\r\n\r\nTo the Roman citizen, as Mommsen observes, a house of his own and the\r\nblessing of children appeared the end and essence of life;[830] and\r\nCicero’s treatise ‘De Legibus’—a treatise which generally reproduces,\r\nin a philosophic form, the ancient laws of Rome—contains a law,\r\naccording to which the Censors had to impose a tax upon unmarried\r\nmen.[831] But in later periods, when sexual morality reached a very low\r\nebb in Rome, celibacy—as to which grave complaints were made as early\r\nas 520 B.C.—naturally increased in proportion, especially among the\r\nwell-off classes. Among these, marriage came to be regarded as a burden\r\nwhich people took upon themselves at the best in the public interest.\r\nIndeed, how it fared with marriage and the rearing of children, is\r\nshown by the Gracchan agrarian laws, which first placed a premium\r\nthereon;[832] whilst, later on, the _Lex Julia et Papia Poppæa_ imposed\r\nvarious penalties on those who lived in a state of celibacy after a\r\ncertain age,[833]—but with little or no result.[834]\r\n\r\nAgain, the Germans, as described by Cæsar, accounted it in the highest\r\ndegree scandalous to have intercourse with the other sex before the\r\ntwentieth year.[835] Tacitus also asserts that the young men married\r\nlate, and the maidens did not hurry into marriage.[836] But it seems\r\nprobable that at a later age celibacy was almost unknown among\r\nthe Germans, except in the case of women who had once lost their\r\nreputation, for whom neither beauty, youth, nor riches could procure a\r\nhusband.[837] As for the Slavs, it should be observed that, among the\r\nRussian peasantry celibacy is even now unheard of.[838] When a youth\r\nreaches the age of eighteen, he is informed by his parents that he\r\nought to marry at once.[839]\r\n\r\nThere are, however, even in savage life, circumstances which compel\r\ncertain persons to live unmarried for a longer or shorter time. When a\r\nwife has to be bought, a man must of course have some fortune before he\r\nis able to marry. Thus, as regards the Zulus, Mr. Eyles writes to me\r\nthat “young men who are without cattle have often to wait many years\r\nbefore getting married.”[840] When Major-General Campbell asked some\r\nof the Kandhs why they remained single, they replied that they did so\r\nbecause wives were too expensive.[841] Among the Munda Kols and Hos,\r\nin consequence of the high prices of brides, are to be found “what\r\nare probably not known to exist in other parts of India, respectable\r\nelderly maidens.”[842] In the New Britain Group, too, according to Mr.\r\nRomilly, the purchase sum is never fixed at too low a price, hence “it\r\nconstantly happens that the intended husband is middle-aged before he\r\ncan marry.”[843] Similar statements are made in a good many books of\r\ntravels.[844]\r\n\r\nPolygyny, in connection with slavery and the unequal distribution\r\nof property, acts in the same direction. In Makin, one of the\r\nKingsmill Islands, a great number of young men were unmarried owing\r\nto the majority of the women being monopolized by the wealthy and\r\npowerful.[845] Among the Bakongo, according to Mr. Ingham, as also\r\namong the Australians,[846] polygyny causes celibacy among the poorer\r\nand younger men; and Dr. Sims says the like of the Bateke, Mr. Cousins\r\nof the Kafirs, Mr. Radfield of the inhabitants of Lifu. Among the\r\nKutchin Indians, according to Hardisty, there are but few young men who\r\nhave wives—unless they can content themselves with some old cast-off\r\nwidow—on account of all the chiefs, medicine men, and those who possess\r\nrank acquired by property having two, three, or more wives.[847] For\r\nthe same reason many men of the lower classes of the Waganda are\r\nobliged to remain single, in spite of the large surplus of women.[848]\r\nIn Micronesia, also, it is common for the poorer class and the slaves\r\nto be doomed to perpetual celibacy.[849] Among the Thlinkets, a slave\r\ncannot acquire property, nor marry, except by consent of his master,\r\nwhich is rarely given;[850] and in the Soudan the case seems to be the\r\nsame.[851]\r\n\r\nBut we must not exaggerate the importance of these obstacles to\r\nmarriage. When the man is not able to buy a wife for himself, he may,\r\nin many cases, acquire her by working for some time with her parents,\r\nor by eloping with her. Moreover, as Sir John Lubbock remarks, the\r\nprice of a wife is generally regulated by the circumstances of the\r\ntribe, so that nearly every industrious young man is enabled to\r\nget one.[852] Speaking of the Sumatrans, Marsden observes that the\r\nnecessity of purchasing does not prove such an obstacle to matrimony as\r\nis supposed, for there are few families who are not in possession of\r\nsome small substance, and the purchase-money of the daughters serves\r\nalso to provide wives for the sons.[853] Again, polygyny is, as we\r\nshall see further on, almost everywhere restricted to a small minority\r\nof the people, and is very often connected with the fact that there is\r\na surplus of women. Thus, among the polygynous Waguha, as I am informed\r\nby Mr. Swann, unmarried grown-up men do not exist, the women being more\r\nnumerous than the men. At any rate, we may conclude that at earlier\r\nstages of civilization, when polygyny was practised less extensively\r\nand women were less precious chattels than they afterwards became,\r\ncelibacy was a much rarer exception than it is now among many of the\r\nlower races.\r\n\r\nPassing to the peoples of Europe, we find, from the evidence adduced by\r\nstatisticians, that modern civilization has proved very unfavourable\r\nto the number of marriages. In civilized Europe, in 1875, more than a\r\nthird of the male and female population beyond the age of fifteen lived\r\nin a state of voluntary or involuntary celibacy. Excluding Russia, the\r\nnumber of celibates varied from 25·57 per cent. in Hungary to 44·93 per\r\ncent. in Belgium. And among them there are many who never marry.[854]\r\nIn the middle of this century, Wappäus found that, in Saxony, 14·6 per\r\ncent. of the unmarried adult population died single; in Sweden, 14·9\r\nper cent.; in the Netherlands, 17·2 per cent.; and in France, 20·6\r\nper cent.[855] Of the rest, many marry comparatively late in life.\r\nThus, in Denmark, only 19·43 per cent. of the married men were under\r\ntwenty-five, and in Bavaria (in 1870-1878), only 16.36, whilst the\r\nfigures for England and Russia look more favourable, being respectively\r\n51·90 per cent. (in 1872-1878), and 68·31 per cent. (in 1867-1875). Of\r\nthe married women, on the other hand, only 5·09 per cent. are below\r\nthe age of twenty in Sweden, 5·40 per cent. in Bavaria, 7·44 per cent.\r\nin Saxony, 14·86 per cent. in England, &c.; but in Hungary as many as\r\n35·16 per cent., and in Russia even 57·27 per cent.[856] The mean age\r\nof the bachelors who enter into matrimony is 26 years in England and\r\n28·48 in France, that of the spinsters respectively 24·07 and 25·3.[857]\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the proportion of unmarried people has been gradually\r\nincreasing in Europe during this century,[858] and the age at which\r\npeople marry has risen. In England we need not go further back than\r\ntwo decades, to find a greater tendency on the part of men to defer\r\nmarriage to later age than was formerly the case.[859] Finally, it must\r\nbe noted that in country districts single men and women are more seldom\r\nmet with, and marriage is generally concluded earlier in life, than in\r\ntowns.[860]\r\n\r\nThere are, indeed, several factors in modern civilization which account\r\nfor the comparatively large number of celibates. In countries where\r\npolygyny is permitted, women have a better chance of getting married\r\nthan men, but in Europe the case is reversed. Here, as in most parts\r\nof the world, the adult women outnumber the adult men. If we reckon\r\nthe age for marriage from twenty to fifty years, a hundred men may, in\r\nEurope, choose amongst a hundred and three or four women, so that about\r\nthree or four women per cent. are doomed to a single life on account of\r\nour obligatory monogamy.[861]\r\n\r\nThe chief cause, however, of increasing celibacy is the difficulty of\r\nsupporting a family in modern society. The importance of this factor\r\nis distinctly proved by statistics. It has been observed that the\r\nfrequency of marriages is a very sensible barometer of the hopes which\r\nthe mass of people have for the future; hard times, wars, commercial\r\ncrises, &c., regularly depressing the number of marriages, whilst\r\ncomparative abundance has the opposite effect.[862]\r\n\r\nIn non-European countries into which a precocious civilization has\r\nnot been introduced, the population is more nearly in proportion to\r\nthe means of subsistence, and people adapt their mode of life more\r\nreadily to their circumstances. In most cases a man can earn his\r\nliving sooner;[863] and a wife far from being a burden to her husband,\r\nis rather a help to him, being his labourer or sometimes even his\r\nsupporter. Moreover, children, instead of requiring an education that\r\nwould absorb the father’s earnings, become, on the contrary, a source\r\nof income. Thus Mr. Bickmore asserts that, among the Malays, difficulty\r\nin supporting a family is unknown.[864] Carsten Niebuhr states that, in\r\nthe East, men are as disposed to marry as women, “because their wives,\r\ninstead of being expensive, are rather profitable to them.”[865] And,\r\nspeaking of the American Indians, Heriot says that children form the\r\nwealth of savage tribes.[866]\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent, the like is true of the agricultural classes of\r\nEurope. A peasant’s wife helps her husband in the field, tends the\r\ncattle, and takes part in the fishing. She cooks and washes, sews,\r\nspins, and weaves. In a word, she does many useful things about which\r\nwomen of the well-off classes never think of troubling themselves.\r\nHence in Russia, as we are informed by M. Pietro Semenow, the small\r\nagriculturists, who form an enormous proportion of the population, are\r\nin the habit of arranging for the marriage of their sons at as early an\r\nage as possible in order to secure an additional female labourer.[867]\r\n\r\nEven in cities it is not among the poorest classes that celibacy is\r\nmost frequent. A “gentleman,” before marrying, thinks it necessary to\r\nhave an income of which a mere fraction would suffice for a married\r\nworkman. He has to offer his wife a home in accordance with her\r\nsocial position and his own; and unless she brings him some fortune,\r\nshe contributes but little to the support of the family. Professor\r\nVallis has made out that, in the nobility and higher _bourgeoisie_ of\r\nSweden, only 32 per cent. of the male population and 26 per cent. of\r\nthe female population are married, whilst the averages for the whole\r\npopulation amount to 34 and 32 per cent. respectively.[868] Some such\r\ndisproportion must always exist when the habits of life are luxurious,\r\nand the amount of income does not correspond to them. And it is obvious\r\nthat women have to suffer from this trouble more than men, the life of\r\nmany of them being comparatively so useless, and their pretensions,\r\nnevertheless, so high.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why the age for marriage has been raised by advancing\r\ncivilization is, that a man requires more time to gain his living by\r\nintellectual than by material work. Thus, miners, tailors, shoemakers,\r\nartisans, &c., who earn in youth almost as much as in later life,\r\nmarry, as a rule, earlier than men of the professional class.[869] In\r\nmost European countries the decrease in the number of married people is\r\nalso partly due to the drafting of young men into the army, and their\r\nretention in it in enforced bachelorhood during the years when nature\r\nmost strongly urges to matrimony.\r\n\r\nOf course these conditions affect directly the marriage age only of\r\nmen, but indirectly they influence that of women also. Many fall in\r\nlove with their future wives long before they are able to form a home,\r\nand those who marry late generally avoid very great disparity of\r\nage.[870]\r\n\r\nIn one respect the average age at which women marry may be said to\r\ndepend directly upon the degree of civilization. Dr. Ploss has justly\r\npointed out that the ruder a people is, and the more exclusively a\r\nwoman is valued as an object of desire, or as a slave, the earlier in\r\nlife is she generally chosen;[871] whereas, if marriage becomes a union\r\nof souls as well as of bodies, the man claims a higher degree of mental\r\nmaturity from the woman he wishes to be his wife.\r\n\r\nAt the lower stages of human development, the pleasures of life consist\r\nchiefly in the satisfaction of natural wants and instincts. Hence\r\nsavages and barbarians scarcely ever dream of voluntarily denying\r\nthemselves “domestic bliss.” But, as a writer in ‘The Nation’ says,\r\n“by the general diffusion of education and culture, by the new\r\ninventions and discoveries of the age, by the increase of commerce\r\nand intercourse and wealth, the tastes of men and women have become\r\nwidened, their desires multiplied, new gratifications and pleasures\r\nhave been supplied to them. By this increase of the gratifications of\r\nexistence the relative share of them which married life affords has\r\nbecome just so much less. The domestic circle does not fill so large a\r\nplace in life as formerly. It is really less important to either man\r\nor woman. Married life has lost in some measure its advantage over a\r\nsingle life. There are so many more pleasures, now, that can be enjoyed\r\nas well or even better in celibacy.”[872]\r\n\r\nIt has further been suggested that the development of the mental\r\nfaculties has made the sexual impulse less powerful. That instinct\r\nis said to be most excessive in animals which least excel in\r\nintelligence, the beasts which are the most lascivious, as the ass,\r\nthe boar, &c., being also the most stupid;[873] and M. Forel even\r\nbelieves that, among the ants, increase of mind-power may have led to\r\nthe sterility of the workers.[874] Idiots, too, are known to display\r\nvery gross sensuality.[875] Yet the suggestion that decrease of sexual\r\ndesire is a necessary attendant upon mental evolution cannot, so far as\r\nI know, by any means be considered scientifically proved, though we may\r\nsafely say that if, among primitive men, pairing was restricted to one\r\nseason of the year, the sexual instinct became gradually less intense\r\nas it became less periodical. A higher degree of forethought and\r\nself-control has, moreover, to a certain extent put the drag on human\r\npassions.\r\n\r\nFinally, there can be no doubt that the higher development of feeling\r\nhas helped to increase the number of those who remain single. “By\r\nthe diffusion of a finer culture throughout the community,” says\r\nthe above-mentioned writer in ‘The Nation,’ “men and women can\r\nless easily find any one whom they are willing to take as a partner\r\nfor life; their requirements are more exacting; their standards of\r\nexcellence higher; they are less able to find any who can satisfy their\r\nown ideal, and less able to satisfy anybody else’s ideal. Men and\r\nwomen have, too, a livelier sense of the serious and sacred character\r\nof the marriage union, and of the high motives from which alone it\r\nshould be formed. They are less willing to contract it from any lower\r\nmotives.”[876]\r\n\r\nIn what direction is the civilized world tending with regard to these\r\nmatters? Will the number of celibates increase as hitherto, or will\r\nthere be some backward movement in that respect? A definite answer\r\ncannot yet be given, since much will depend on economical conditions\r\nwhich it is impossible at present to foresee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore this chapter is closed, it may be worth while to glance at the\r\ncurious notion that there is something impure and sinful in marriage,\r\nas in sexual relations generally. The missionary Jellinghaus found\r\nthis idea prevalent among the Munda Kols in Chota Nagpore. Once when\r\nhe asked them, “May a dog sin?” the answer was, “If the dog did\r\nnot sin how could he breed?”[877] In Efate, of the New Hebrides,\r\naccording to Mr. Macdonald, sexual intercourse is regarded as something\r\nunclean;[878] and the Tahitians believed that, if a man refrained\r\nfrom all connection with women some months before death, he passed\r\nimmediately into his eternal mansion without any purification.[879]\r\nIt is perhaps for a similar reason that the Shawanese have a great\r\nrespect for certain persons who observe celibacy,[880] and that,\r\namong the Californian Karok, a man who touches a woman within three\r\ndays before going out hunting is believed to miss the quarry.[881]\r\nAmong several peoples, as the Brazilian aborigines,[882] the Papuans\r\nof New Guinea,[883] certain tribes in Australia,[884] the Khyoungtha\r\nof the Chittagong Hills,[885] and the Khevsurs of the Caucasus,[886]\r\ncontinence is required from newly married people for some time\r\nafter marriage. The same is the case with several peoples of Aryan\r\norigin; and Dr. v. Schroeder even believes that this custom can be\r\ntraced back to the primitive times of the Indo-European race.[887]\r\nIn ancient Mexico, the Mazatek bridegroom kept apart from the bride\r\nduring the first fifteen days of his wedded life, both spending the\r\ntime in fasting and penance.[888] In Greenland, according to Egede, if\r\nmarried couples had children before a year was past, or if they had\r\nlarge families, they were blamed, and compared to dogs.[889] In Fiji,\r\nhusbands and wives do not usually spend the night together, except as\r\nit were by stealth; it is quite contrary to Fijian ideas of delicacy\r\nthat they should sleep under the same roof. Thus a man spends the day\r\nwith his family, but absents himself on the approach of night.[890]\r\nSpeaking of certain American Indians, Lafitau remarks, “Ils n’osent\r\naller dans les cabanes particulières où habitent leurs épouses, que\r\ndurant l’obscurité de la nuit; ... ce seroit une action extraordinaire\r\nde s’y présenter de jour.”[891] Moreover, in spite of the great\r\nlicentiousness of many savage races, a veil of modesty, however\r\ntransparent, is generally drawn over the relations of the sexes.[892]\r\n\r\nThe same notion of impurity doubtless explains the fact that certain\r\npersons devoted to religion have to live a single life. In the\r\nMarquesas Islands, no one could become a priest without having lived\r\nchastely for several years previously.[893] In Patagonia, according\r\nto Falkner, the male wizards were not allowed to marry,[894] and the\r\nsame prohibition applied to the priests of the Mosquito Indians and\r\nthe ancient Mexicans.[895] In Peru, there were virgins dedicated to\r\nthe Sun, who lived in seclusion to the end of their lives; and besides\r\nthe virgins who professed perpetual virginity in the monasteries,\r\nthere were other women, of the blood royal, who led the same life in\r\ntheir own houses, having taken a vow of chastity. “These women,”\r\nsays Garcilasso de la Vega, “were held in great veneration for their\r\nchastity and purity, and, as a mark of worship and respect, they were\r\ncalled ‘Occlo,’ which was a name held sacred in their idolatry.”[896]\r\nIn Mexico, also, certain religious women were bound to chastity,\r\nalthough their profession was but for one year. Speaking of these nuns,\r\nthe pious Father Acosta remarks, “The devil hath desired to be served\r\nby them that observe Virginitie, not that chastitie is pleasing unto\r\nhim, for he is an uncleane spirite, but for the desire he hath to take\r\nfrom the great God, as much as in him lieth, this glory to be served\r\nwith cleanness and integrity.”[897] Justinus tells us of Persian Sun\r\npriestesses, who, like the Roman vestals and certain Greek priestesses,\r\nwere obliged to refrain from intercourse with men;[898] and according\r\nto Pomponius Mela, the nine priestesses of the oracle of a Gallic deity\r\nin Sena were devoted to perpetual virginity.[899]\r\n\r\nThe Buddhistic doctrine teaches that lust and ignorance are the two\r\ngreat causes of the misery of life, and that we should therefore\r\nsuppress lust and remove ignorance. We read in the ‘Dhammika-Sutta’\r\nthat “a wise man should avoid married life as if it were a burning\r\npit of live coals.”[900] Sensuality is altogether incompatible with\r\nwisdom and holiness. According to the legend, Buddha’s mother, who\r\nwas the best and purest of the daughters of men, had no other sons,\r\nand her conception was due to supernatural causes.[901] And one of\r\nthe fundamental duties of monastic life, by an infringement of which\r\nthe guilty person brings about his inevitable expulsion from Buddha’s\r\nOrder, is, that “an ordained monk may not have sexual intercourse, not\r\neven with an animal. The monk who has sexual intercourse is no longer\r\na monk.”[902] Mr. Wilson, indeed, states that, in Tibet, some sects of\r\nthe Lamas are allowed to marry; but those who do not are considered\r\nmore holy. And in every sect the nuns must take a vow of absolute\r\ncontinence.[903] Again, the Chinese laws enjoin celibacy upon all\r\npriests, Buddhist or Taouist.[904]\r\n\r\nIn India, where, according to Sir Monier Williams, married life has\r\nbeen more universally honoured than in any other country of the world,\r\ncelibacy has, nevertheless, in instances of extraordinary sanctity,\r\nalways commanded respect.[905] “Those of their Sannyâsis,” says\r\nDubois, “who are known to lead their lives in perfect celibacy,\r\nreceive, on that account, marks of distinguished honour and respect.”\r\nBut the single state, which is allowed to those who devote themselves\r\nto a life of contemplation, is not tolerated in any class of women.[906]\r\n\r\nAmong a small class of Hebrews, too, the idea that marriage is impure\r\ngradually took root. The Essenes, says Josephus, “reject pleasures\r\nas an evil, but esteem continence and the conquest over our passions\r\nto be virtue. They neglect wedlock.”[907] This doctrine exercised\r\nno influence upon Judaism, but probably much upon Christianity. St.\r\nPaul held celibacy to be preferable to marriage:—“He that giveth his\r\nvirgin in marriage doeth well,” he says; “but he that giveth her\r\nnot in marriage doeth better.”[908] Yet, as for most men continence\r\nis not possible, marriage is for them not only a right but a duty.\r\n“It is good for a man not to touch a woman; nevertheless, to avoid\r\nfornication, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have\r\nher own husband.... If they (the unmarried and widows) cannot contain,\r\nlet them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.”[909] A much\r\nstronger opinion as to the superiority of celibacy is expressed by\r\nmost of the Fathers of the Church. Origen thought marriage profane and\r\nimpure. Tertullian says that celibacy must be chosen, even if mankind\r\nshould perish. According to St Augustine, the unmarried children will\r\nshine in heaven as beaming stars, whilst their parents will look\r\nlike the dim ones.[910] Indeed, as Mr. Lecky observes, the cardinal\r\nvirtue of the religious type became the absolute suppression of the\r\nwhole sensual side of our nature, and theology made the indulgence of\r\none passion almost the sole unchristian sin.[911] It was a favourite\r\nopinion among the Fathers that, if Adam had preserved his obedience to\r\nthe Creator, he would have lived for ever in a state of virgin purity,\r\nand that some harmless mode of vegetation might have peopled paradise\r\nwith a race of innocent and immortal beings. The use of marriage was in\r\nfact permitted to his fallen posterity only as a necessary expedient\r\nfor the continuance of the human species, and as a restraint, however\r\nimperfect, on the natural licentiousness of desire.[912] But, though it\r\nmay be marriage that fills the earth, says St. Jerome, it is virginity\r\nthat replenishes heaven.[913]\r\n\r\nThese opinions led by degrees to the obligatory celibacy of the secular\r\nand regular clergy. The New Testament gives us no intimation that,\r\nduring the lifetime of the apostles, monastic vows were taken by men\r\nof any age, or by unmarried women, and hardly any of the apostles\r\nthemselves were celibates.[914] But gradually, as continence came to\r\nbe regarded as a cardinal virtue, and celibacy as the nearest approach\r\nto the Divine perfection, a notion that the married state is not\r\nconsistent with the functions of the clergy became general. As early\r\nas the end of the fourth century, the continence of the higher grades\r\nof ecclesiastics was insisted on by a Roman synod, but no definite\r\npunishment was ordered for its violation.[915] Gregory VII.—who “looked\r\nwith abhorrence on the contamination of the holy sacerdotal character,\r\neven in its lowest degree, by any sexual connection”—was the first who\r\nprescribed with sufficient force the celibacy of the clergy. Yet, in\r\nmany countries, it was so strenuously resisted, that it could not be\r\ncarried through till late in the thirteenth century.[916]\r\n\r\nAs for the origin of this notion of sexual uncleanness, it may\r\nperhaps be connected with the instinctive feeling, to be dealt with\r\nlater on, against intercourse between members of the same family or\r\nhousehold. Experience, I think, tends to prove that there exists a\r\nclose association between these two feelings, which shows itself\r\nin many ways. Sexual love is entirely banished from the sphere of\r\ndomestic life, and it is reasonable to suppose, therefore, that when it\r\nappears in other relations, an association of ideas attaches a notion\r\nof impurity to the desire and a notion of shame to its gratification.\r\nEvidently, also, the religious enforcement of celibacy is intimately\r\nallied to the belief that sexual intercourse is the great transmitter\r\nof original sin, as well as to the abhorrence of every enjoyment which\r\nis considered to degrade the spiritual nature of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE COURTSHIP OF MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the male and female reproductive cells of plants, Professor\r\nSachs remarks that, wherever we are able to observe an external\r\ndifference between the two, the male cell behaves actively in the\r\nunion, the female passively.[917] In this respect there is an analogy\r\nbetween plants and many of the lower animals. In the case of some\r\nlowly-organised animals, which are permanently affixed to the same\r\nspot, the male element is invariably brought to the female. There are\r\nother instances in which the females alone are fixed, and the males\r\nmust be the seekers. Even when the males and females of a species\r\nare both free, it is almost always the males that first approach the\r\nfemales.[918]\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Darwin points out, we can see the reason why, in the first\r\ninstance, the male plays the active part:—“Even if the ova were\r\ndetached before fertilisation, and did not require subsequent\r\nnourishment or protection, there would yet be greater difficulty in\r\ntransporting them than the male element because, being larger than\r\nthe latter, they are produced in far smaller numbers.”[919] He adds,\r\nhowever, that, with respect to forms of which the progenitors were\r\nprimordially free, it is difficult to understand why the males should\r\ninvariably have acquired the habit of approaching the females, instead\r\nof being approached by them. Perhaps the explanation may be that the\r\nseeker is more exposed to danger than the one sought after, and that\r\nthe death of a male at the pairing time is less disadvantageous for\r\nthe existence of the species than the death of a female. At any rate,\r\nwe may say with Mr. Darwin that it is necessary that the males should\r\nbe endowed with strong passions in order that they may be efficient\r\nseekers; and the acquirement of such passions would naturally follow\r\nfrom the more eager males leaving a larger number of offspring than the\r\nless eager.[920]\r\n\r\nThe rule holds good for the human race, the man generally playing a\r\nmore active, the woman a more passive, part in courtship. The latter,\r\nas it has been said, “requires to be courted.” Yet, curiously enough,\r\nthere are a few peoples among whom the reverse seems to be the case,\r\njust as, among the lower animals also, there are some species of which\r\nthe females are the courters.[921] Among the Moquis in New Mexico,\r\naccording to Dr. Broeck, “instead of the swain asking the hand of the\r\nfair one, she selects the young man who is to her fancy, and then her\r\nfather proposes the match to the sire of the lucky youth.”[922] In\r\nParaguay, we are told, the women were generally endowed with stronger\r\npassions than the men,[923] and were allowed to make proposals;[924]\r\nand among the Garos, according to Colonel Dalton, it is not only\r\nthe privilege but even the duty of the girl to speak first, any\r\ninfringement of this rule being summarily and severely punished. “If\r\na male makes advances to a girl,” he says, “and the latter, rejecting\r\nthem, chooses also to tell her friends that such tenders of affection\r\nhave been made to her, it is looked on as an insult to the whole\r\n‘mahári’ (motherhood) to which the girl belongs, a stain only to be\r\nobliterated by the blood of pigs, and liberal libations of beer at the\r\nexpense of the ‘mahári’ to which the man belongs.”[925] According\r\nto Mr. Batchelor, it constantly occurs among the Ainos that the\r\nproposal of marriage comes in the first place from the girl;[926] and\r\nin Polynesia,[927] as also among the Kafirs of Natal[928] and certain\r\ntribes in Oregon,[929] the same is sometimes the case.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that the parents of both parties make up the match;\r\nand among several peoples the man pays his suit by proxy. But these\r\ninstances are of no particular importance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn most animal species courtship takes place in nearly the same way.\r\nDuring the season of love, the males even of the most timid animals\r\nengage in desperate combats with each other for the possession of the\r\nfemale, and she, although comparatively passive, nevertheless often\r\nexercises a choice, selecting one of the rivals. This fighting for a\r\nfemale occurs even among insects,[930] and is of universal prevalence\r\nin the order of the Vertebrata. We may, with Haeckel, regard it as a\r\nmodification and a special kind of the struggle for existence.[931]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that our primeval human ancestors had, in the\r\nsame way, to combat for their brides. Even now this kind of courtship\r\nis far from being unknown. Speaking of the Northern Indians, Hearne\r\nstates that “it has ever been the custom among those people for the men\r\nto wrestle for any woman to whom they are attached; and, of course, the\r\nstrongest party always carries off the prize. A weak man, unless he\r\nbe a good hunter and well-beloved, is seldom permitted to keep a wife\r\nthat a stronger man thinks worth his notice.... This custom prevails\r\nthroughout all their tribes, and causes a great spirit of emulation\r\namong their youth, who are upon all occasions, from their childhood,\r\ntrying their strength and skill in wrestling.[932] Richardson also saw,\r\nmore than once, a stronger man assert his right to take the wife of a\r\nweaker countryman. “Any one,” he says, “may challenge another to\r\nwrestle, and, if he overcomes, may carry off his wife as the prize....\r\nThe bereaved husband meets his loss with the resignation which custom\r\nprescribes in such a case, and seeks his revenge by taking the wife\r\nof another man weaker than himself.”[933] With reference to the Slave\r\nIndians, Mr. Hooper says, “If a man desire to despoil his neighbour of\r\nhis wife, a trial of strength of a curious nature ensues: they seize\r\neach other by the hair, which is worn long and flowing, and thus strive\r\nfor the mastery, until one or another cries _peccavi_. Should the\r\nvictor be the envious man, he has to pay a certain number of skins for\r\nthe husband-changing woman.”[934]\r\n\r\nAmong the Californians also, conflicting claims sometimes arise\r\nbetween two or more men in regard to a woman; and, among the Patwin,\r\nit occasionally happened that men who had a quarrel about a woman\r\nfought a duel with bows and arrows at long distances.[935] In Mexico,\r\na duel often decided the conflict between two competing suitors.[936]\r\nAmong the Guanas, according to Azara, the men frequently do not marry\r\ntill they are twenty years old or more, as before that age they cannot\r\nconquer their rivals.[937] Among the Muras, the wives are most commonly\r\ngained in a combat with fists between all the lovers of the girl; and\r\nthe same is the case with the Passés.[938]\r\n\r\nAmong the Australian aborigines, quarrels are perhaps for the most\r\npart occasioned by “the fair sex.”[939] Speaking of the natives near\r\nHerbert Vale, Northern Queensland, Herr Lumholtz says that, “if a\r\nwoman is good-looking, all the men want her, and the one who is most\r\ninfluential, or who is the strongest, is accordingly generally the\r\nvictor.”[940] Hence, the majority of the young men must wait a long\r\ntime before they get wives, as they have not the courage to fight the\r\nrequisite duel for one with an older man.[941] In the tribes of Western\r\nVictoria, described by Mr. Dawson, a young chief who cannot get a wife,\r\nand falls in love with one belonging to a chief who has more than two,\r\ncan, with her consent, challenge the husband to single combat, and, if\r\nthe husband is defeated, the conqueror makes her his legal wife.[942]\r\nNarcisse Peltier, who, during seventeen years, was detained by a tribe\r\nof Queensland Australians, states that the men “not unfrequently fight\r\nwith spears for the possession of a woman.”[943]\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand, if a girl had two suitors with equal pretensions, a\r\nkind of “pulling match” was arranged in which the girl’s arms were\r\ndragged by each of the suitors in opposite directions, the stronger\r\nman being the victor;[944] and, according to the Rev. R. Taylor, there\r\nis in the Maori language even a special term for denoting such a\r\nstruggle.[945] In Samoa, as also in the Fiji Islands, women have always\r\nbeen one of the chief causes of fighting;[946] and of the natives of\r\nMakin, of the Kingsmill Group, Mr. Wood assures us that “they have\r\nno wars, and very few arms, and seldom quarrel except about their\r\nwomen.”[947]\r\n\r\nAmong the South African Bushmans, the “stronger man will sometimes\r\ntake away the wife of the weaker.”[948] The people of Wadaï are\r\nnotorious for their desperate fights for women; and, among the young\r\nmen of Baghirmi, bloody feuds between rivals are far from being of rare\r\noccurrence.[949]\r\n\r\nIn the islands outside Kamchatka there prevailed formerly a very\r\ncurious custom, as reported by Steller. If a husband found that a rival\r\nhad been with his wife, he would admit that the rival had at least an\r\nequal claim to her. “Let us try, then,” he would say, “which of us\r\nhas the greater right, and shall have her.” After that they would take\r\noff their clothes and begin to beat each other’s backs with sticks;\r\nand he who first fell to the ground, unable to bear any more blows,\r\nlost his right to the woman.[950]\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient Hindus, says Mr. Samuelson, “it was a custom in\r\nroyal circles, when a princess became marriageable, for a tournament\r\nto be held, and the victor was chosen by the princess as her husband.”\r\nThis custom was known as the “Swayamvara,” or “Maiden’s Choice,” and\r\nit is often mentioned in the ancient legends.[951]\r\n\r\nIn Greek legends and myths, we meet with several instances of fighting\r\nor emulation for women. Pausanias tells us that Danaus established a\r\nrace for his daughters, and that “he that outran all the rest was to\r\nhave the first choice, and take her whom he most approved; he that was\r\nnext in order was to have the second choice, and so on to the last; and\r\nthose who had no suitors were ordered to wait till new ones came to\r\nthe course.”[952] According to Pindar, Antæus, father of a fair-haired\r\nand greatly-praised daughter, who had many suitors, stationed the\r\nwhole company of them at the end of the race-course, saying that he\r\nshould have her for his bride who should prove foremost in the race and\r\nfirst touch her garments.[953] Icarus likewise proposed a race for the\r\nsuitors of Penelope;[954] and, as Mr. Hamilton remarks, “the triumph\r\nof Odysseus over the Suitors is the real end of the Odyssey.”[955]\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Krauss, the South Slavonian youths on Palm Sunday,\r\nthe day for presentiments of love, wrestle with each other, believing\r\nthat he who proves the stronger will get the prettier wife.[956] Arthur\r\nYoung informs us of the following strange custom which prevailed in\r\nthe interior of Ireland in his time:—“There is a very ancient custom\r\nhere,” he says, “for a number of country neighbours among the poor\r\npeople to fix upon some young woman that ought, as they think, to be\r\nmarried; they also agree upon a young fellow as a proper husband for\r\nher; this determined, they send to the fair one’s cabin to inform her\r\nthat on the Sunday following ‘she is to be horsed,’ that is, carried\r\non men’s backs. She must then provide whisky and cider for a treat, as\r\nall will pay her a visit after mass for a hurling match. As soon as\r\nshe is horsed the hurling begins, in which the young fellow appointed\r\nfor her husband has the eyes of all the company fixed on him: if he\r\ncomes off conqueror, he is certainly married to the girl; but if\r\nanother is victorious, he as certainly loses her, for she is the prize\r\nof the victor.... Sometimes one barony hurls against another, but a\r\nmarriageable girl is always the prize.”[957]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sexual struggle in the animal kingdom is not always of a violent\r\nkind. As Mr. Darwin has pointed out, males often try by peaceful\r\nemulation to charm the female. In many species of birds the male seems\r\nto endeavour to gain his bride by displaying his colours and ornaments\r\nbefore her, or exciting her by his love-notes, songs, and antics. But\r\namong the lower Mammals he wins her, apparently, much more through\r\nthe law of battle than through the display of his charms.[958] There\r\ncan scarcely be any doubt that the same was the case with primitive\r\nmen; but we need not mount many steps of human progress to find that\r\ncourtship involves something more than a mere act of strength or\r\ncourage on the part of the male. It is not only in civilized countries\r\nthat it often means a prolonged making of love to the woman. Mariner’s\r\nwords with reference to the women of Tonga hold true for a great many,\r\nnot to say all, savage and barbarous races now existing. “It must\r\nnot be supposed,” he says, “that these women are always easily won;\r\nthe greatest attentions and most fervent solicitations are sometimes\r\nrequisite, even though there be no other lover in the way. This happens\r\nsometimes from a spirit of coquetry, at other times from a dislike to\r\nthe party, &c.”[959]\r\n\r\nThough generally playing the less active part in courtship, the woman\r\ndoes not by any means indulge in complete passivity. Mr. Hooper tells\r\nus that, among the Indians at James’s Bay, “two young Indian women\r\nwere observed some years ago in violent conflict.... After a lengthened\r\nand determined struggle the weakest succumbed to the superior prowess\r\nof her fortunate adversary. It appeared that these girls were in love\r\nwith the same man, and had self-instituted this mode of deciding their\r\nclaims.”[960] Among the Wintun of California, according to Mr. Powers,\r\nwhen any man other than a chief attempts to introduce into his wigwam a\r\nsecond partner of his bosom, the two women dispute for the supremacy,\r\noften in a desperate pitched battle with sharp stones; “they maul each\r\nother’s faces with savage violence, and if one is knocked down her\r\nfriends assist her to regain her feet, and the brutal combat is renewed\r\nuntil one or the other is driven from the wigwam.”[961] Peltier states\r\nthat, in the Australian tribe already referred to, the women, of whom\r\nfrom two to five commonly belong to each man, fight among themselves\r\nabout him, “their weapons being heavy staves, with which they beat one\r\nanother about the head till the blood flows.”[962] In the Kingsmill\r\nIslands, women sometimes, from jealousy, carry a small weapon, watching\r\nan opportunity of making an attack upon their rivals, desperate\r\nfights being the consequence;[963] and, among the Kamchadales also,\r\nthe females are said to have fought for the males.[964] But far more\r\ncommonly women try to secure men’s love by coquetry or the display of\r\ntheir charms. Finally, whilst the men are generally the courters, the\r\nwomen may in many, perhaps most cases, accept or refuse their proposals\r\nat pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe next chapter will be devoted to an account of some of the most\r\ncommon means by which the sexes endeavour, or formerly endeavoured,\r\nto make themselves attractive to one another, and to stimulate each\r\nother’s passions. Then we shall see how far woman has the liberty of\r\ndisposing of her own hand, and, at the same time, note cases in which\r\nthe man also, with regard to his marriage, has to submit to some\r\nother’s will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nMEANS OF ATTRACTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe desire for self-decoration, although a specifically human quality,\r\nis exceedingly old. There are peoples destitute of almost everything\r\nwhich we regard as necessaries of life, but there is no people so\r\nrude as not to take pleasure in ornaments. The ancient barbarians who\r\ninhabited the south of Europe at the same time as the reindeer and the\r\nmammoth, brought to their caves brilliant and ornamental objects.[965]\r\nThe women of the utterly wretched Veddahs in Ceylon decorate themselves\r\nwith necklaces of brass beads, and bangles cut from the chank\r\nshell.[966] The Fuegians “are content to be naked,” but “ambitious\r\nto be fine.”[967] The Australians, without taking the slightest pride\r\nin their appearance, so far as neatness or cleanliness is concerned,\r\nare yet very vain of their own rude decorations.[968] And of the rude\r\nTasmanians, Cook tells us that they had no wish to obtain useful\r\narticles, but were eager to secure anything ornamental.\r\n\r\n“Great as is the vanity of the civilized,” says Mr. Spencer, “it is\r\nexceeded by that of the uncivilized.”[969] The predilection of savages\r\nfor ornaments has been sufficiently shown by travellers in almost\r\nevery part of the world. Feathers and beads of different colours,\r\nflowers, rings, anklets, and bracelets, are common embellishments. A\r\nfully-equipped Santal belle, for instance, carries two anklets, and\r\nperhaps twelve bracelets, and a necklace weighing a pound, the total\r\nweight of ornaments on her person amounting to thirty-four pounds of\r\nbell metal,—“a greater weight,” says Captain Sherwill, “than one\r\nof our drawing-room belles could well lift.”[970] Besides this, the\r\nbody is transformed in various ways. The lips, the sides of the nose,\r\nand the lobes of the ear are especially ill-treated. Hardly any woman\r\nin Eastern Central Africa is without a lip-ring; they say it makes\r\nthem look pretty, and “the bigger the ring, the more they value\r\nthemselves!”[971] The Shulis bore a hole in the underlip and insert in\r\nit a piece of crystal three or four inches long, which sways about as\r\nthey speak;[972] and similar customs are common among other African\r\npeoples,[973] as also in some parts of North and South America.[974]\r\nThe Papuans perforate the septum of the nose and insert in the hole\r\nsticks, claws of birds, &c.[975] The most common practice is to pierce,\r\nenlarge, or somehow mutilate the ear-lobes. Certain North American\r\nIndians,[976] the Arecunas and Botocudos of South America,[977] and\r\nthe East African Wa-taïta[978] pull them down almost to the shoulders.\r\nAmong the Easter Islanders, says Beechey, “the lobe, deprived of its\r\near-ring, hangs dangling against the neck, and has a very disagreeable\r\nappearance, particularly when wet. It is sometimes so long as to be\r\ngreatly in the way; to obviate which, they pass the lobe over the upper\r\npart of the ear, or more rarely, fasten one lobe to the other, at the\r\nback of the head.”[979]\r\n\r\nScarcely less subject to mutilations are the teeth. In the Malay\r\nArchipelago, the filing and blackening of the teeth are thought\r\nto produce a most beautiful result, white teeth being in great\r\ndisesteem.[980] The Australians often knock out one or two front teeth\r\nof the upper jaw, and several tribes in New Guinea file their teeth\r\nsharp.[981] Again, the Damaras file the middle teeth in the upper jaw\r\ninto the form of a swallow’s tail, and knock out four teeth in the\r\nlower jaw; whilst one of the Makalaka tribes, north of the Zambesi, and\r\nthe Matongas, on its bank, “break out their top incisor-teeth from the\r\nsheerest vanity. Their women say that it is only horses that eat with\r\nall their teeth, and that men ought not to eat like horses.”[982]\r\n\r\nMany savage men take most pride in the hair of the head. Now it is\r\npainted in a showy manner, now decorated with beads and tinsel, now\r\ncombed and arranged with the most exquisite care. The Kandhs have\r\ntheir hair, which is worn very long, drawn forward and rolled up till\r\nit looks like a horn projecting from between the eyes. Around this it\r\nis their delight to wear a piece of red cloth, and they insert the\r\nfeathers of favourite birds, as also a pipe, comb, &c.[983] The men\r\nof Tana, of the New Hebrides, wear their hair “twelve and eighteen\r\ninches long, and have it divided into some six or seven hundred little\r\nlocks or tresses;”[984] and, among the Latúka, a man requires a period\r\nof from eight to ten years to perfect his coiffure.[985] In North\r\nAmerica, Hearne saw several men about six feet high, who had preserved\r\n“a single lock of their hair that, when let down, would trail on the\r\nground as they walked.”[986] Other Indians practise the custom of\r\nshaving the head and ornamenting it with the crest of deer’s hairs; and\r\nwigs are used by several savage peoples.[987] The Indians of Guiana,\r\nthe Fuegians, Chavantes, Uaupés,[988] and other tribes are in the habit\r\nof pulling out their eyebrows.\r\n\r\nScarcely anything has a greater attraction for the savage mind than\r\nshowy colours. “No matter,” says Dr. Holub, “how ill a traveller in\r\nthe Marutse district may be, and how many bearers he may require, if he\r\nonly has a good stock of blue beads he may always be sure of commanding\r\nthe best attention and of securing the amplest services; his beads will\r\nprove an attraction irresistible to sovereign and subject, to man,\r\nwoman, and child, to freeman and bondman alike.”[989] The practice of\r\nornamenting one’s self with gaudy baubles and painting the body with\r\nconspicuous colours is, indeed, extremely prevalent. Of Santal men at\r\na feast, Sir W. Hunter says that, “if all the colours of the rainbow\r\nwere not displayed by them, certainly the hedgehog, the peacock, and\r\na variety of the feathered tribe had been laid under contribution in\r\norder to supply the young Santal beaux with plumes.”[990] Especially\r\ndoes the savage man delight in paint. Red ochre is generally looked\r\nupon as the chief embellishment, whilst, of the other colours, black\r\nand white are probably most in use. The Naudowessies paint their faces\r\nred and black, “which they esteem as greatly ornamental.”[991] Among\r\nthe Guaycurûs, many men paint their bodies half red, half white.[992]\r\nThroughout the Australian continent the natives stain themselves with\r\nblack, red, yellow, and white.[993] In Fiji, a small quantity of\r\nvermilion is esteemed “as the greatest possible acquisition.”[994] In\r\nNew Zealand, the lips of both sexes are generally dyed blue; and in\r\nSanta Cruz, or Egmont Island, Labillardière observed with surprise that\r\n“there was very much diffused a fondness for white hair, which formed\r\na striking contrast to the colour of their skin.”[995]\r\n\r\n“Not one great country can be named,” Mr. Darwin says, “from the\r\nPolar regions in the north to New Zealand in the south, in which the\r\naborigines do not tattoo themselves.”[996] This practice was followed\r\nby the ancient Assyrians, Britons, and Thracians,[997] as it is\r\nfollowed by most savages still. And it may be said without exaggeration\r\nthat there is no visible part of the human body, except the eyeball,\r\nthat has escaped from being disfigured in this way. Some of the Easter\r\nIslanders tattoo their foreheads in arched lines, as also the edges\r\nof their ears, and the fleshy part of their lips.[998] The Abyssinian\r\nwomen occasionally prick their gums entirely blue.[999] The Mundrucûs\r\ntattooed even their eyelids.[1000] And, speaking of the tattooing of\r\nthe Sandwich Islanders, Freycinet remarks, “Aucune partie de leur\r\ncorps n’en est exempte; le nez, les oreilles, les paupières, le sommet\r\nde la tête, le bout de la langue même dans quelques circonstances, en\r\nsont surchargés non moins que la poitrine, le dos, les jambes, les bras\r\net la paume des mains.”[1001]\r\n\r\nOften cicatrices are made in the skin, without any colouring matter\r\nbeing used. Some tribes of Madagascar, for instance, are in the habit\r\nof making marks, “which are intended to be ornamental,” by slight\r\nincisions in the skin.[1002] The natives of Tana ornament themselves\r\nby “cutting or burning some rude device of a leaf or a fish on the\r\nbreast, or upper part of the arm.”[1003] The Australians throughout the\r\ncontinent scar their persons, as Mr. Curr assures us, only as a means\r\nof decoration.[1004] And, in Fiji, “rows of wart-like spots are burned\r\nalong the arms and backs of the women, which they and their admirers\r\ncall ornamental.”[1005]\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that many of these practices sprang from other\r\nmotives than a desire for decoration; and some are said to have had\r\na religious origin. The Australian Dieyerie, on being asked why he\r\nknocks out two front teeth of the upper jaw of his children, can answer\r\nonly that, when they were created, the Muramura, a good spirit, thus\r\ndisfigured the first child, and, pleased at the sight, commanded\r\nthat the like should be done to every male or female child for ever\r\nafter.[1006] The Pelew Islanders believe that the perforation of the\r\nseptum of the nose is necessary for winning eternal bliss;[1007] and\r\nthe Nicaraguans say that their ancestors were instructed by the gods\r\nto flatten the children’s heads.[1008] Again, in Fiji, it is supposed\r\nthat the custom of tattooing is in conformity with the appointment of\r\nthe god Dengei, and that its neglect is punished after death.[1009] A\r\nsimilar idea prevails among the Kingsmill Islanders and Ainos;[1010]\r\nand the Greenlanders formerly believed that the heads of those girls\r\nwho had not been deformed by long stitches made with a needle and black\r\nthread between the eyes, on the forehead, and upon the chin, would be\r\nturned into train tubs, and placed under the lamps in heaven, in the\r\nland of souls.[1011] But such tales are not of much importance, as any\r\nusage practised from time immemorial may easily be ascribed to the\r\ncommand of a god.\r\n\r\nMr. Frazer suggests that several of the practices here mentioned are\r\nfundamentally connected with totemism.[1012] In order to put himself\r\nmore fully under the protection of the totem, the clansman, according\r\nto Mr. Frazer, is in the habit of assimilating himself to it by\r\nthe arrangement of his hair and the mutilation of his body; and of\r\nrepresenting the totem on his body by cicatrices, tattooing, or paint.\r\nThus the Buffalo clans of the Iowa and Omahas wear two locks of hair in\r\nimitation of horns; whilst the Small Bird clan of the Omahas “leave\r\na little hair in front, over the forehead, for a bill, and some at the\r\nback of the head, for the bird’s tail, with much over each ear for the\r\nwings;” and the Turtle subclan cut off all the hair from a boy’s head,\r\nexcept six locks which are arranged so as to imitate the legs, head,\r\nand tail of a turtle. The practice of knocking out the upper front\r\nteeth at puberty, Mr. Frazer continues, is, or was once, probably an\r\nimitation of the totem; and so also the bone, reed, or stick which\r\nsome Australian tribes thrust through the nose. The Haidahs of Queen\r\nCharlotte Islands have always, and the Iroquois commonly, their totems\r\ntattooed on their persons, and certain other tribes have on their\r\nbodies tattooed figures of animals, which Mr. Frazer thinks likely to\r\nbe totem marks. According to one authority, the raised cicatrices of\r\nthe Australians are sometimes arranged in patterns representing the\r\ntotem; and, among a few peoples, the totem is painted on the person of\r\nthe clansman.[1013]\r\n\r\nMr. Frazer’s theory is supported by exceedingly few facts whereas\r\nthere is an enormous mass of cases in which we have no right whatever\r\nto infer a connection with totemism. It is, indeed, impossible to\r\nsee how most of the practices considered in this chapter could have\r\noriginated in this way. How is it possible to explain the knocking\r\nout of the upper front teeth or the thrusting of a stick through the\r\nnose as imitations of totem animals? And how are we to connect the\r\nmutilations of the ears and other parts of the body, and the various\r\nmodes of self-decoration, with totemism? Since all such practices are\r\nuniversally considered to improve the appearance, and, as will be shown\r\npresently, take place at the same period of life, we may justly infer\r\nthat the cause to which they owe their origin is fundamentally one and\r\nthe same. As for tattooing, Professor Gerland assumes that the tattooed\r\nmarks were originally figures of totem animals, though they are no\r\nlonger so;[1014] but an assumption of that kind is not permissible\r\nin a scientific investigation. And even in those rare cases, where\r\na connection between tattooing and totemism undoubtedly exists, we\r\ncannot be sure whether this connection is not secondary. At present\r\ntattooing is everywhere regarded exclusively, or almost exclusively, as\r\na means of decoration, and Cook states expressly that, in the South\r\nSea Islands, at the time of their discovery, it was in no way connected\r\nwith religion.[1015] Nor can I agree with Mr. Spencer that tattooing\r\nand other kinds of mutilation were practised originally as a means\r\nof expressing subordination to a dead ruler or a god.[1016] Equally\r\nwithout evidence is Mr. Colquhoun’s opinion that the custom originated\r\nin the wish either to make a man more fearful in battle, or to render\r\nthe body invulnerable by the tattooing of charms on it.[1017]\r\n\r\nIt is true, no doubt, that this practice subserves various ends. Mr.\r\nKeyser speaks of a chief in New Guinea who had sixty-three blue tattoo\r\nlines on his chest, which represented the number of enemies he had\r\nslain.[1018] Moreover, the tattooed marks make it possible for savages\r\nto distinguish their own clansmen from their enemies;[1019] though\r\nI cannot think, with Chenier,[1020] that this was their original\r\nobject. Again, many ornaments are really nothing but trophy-badges,\r\nand many things used for ornaments were at first substitutes for\r\ntrophies, having some resemblance to them;[1021] whilst others are\r\ncarried as signs of opulence.[1022] I do not deny, either, that men\r\nmay sometimes paint their bodies in order to inspire their enemies\r\nwith fear in battle, or that the use of red ochre and fat is good as\r\na defence against changes of weather, flies, and mosquitoes.[1023]\r\nNevertheless, it seems to be beyond doubt that men and women began to\r\nornament, mutilate, paint, and tattoo themselves chiefly in order to\r\nmake themselves attractive to the opposite sex,—that they might court\r\nsuccessfully, or be courted.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that in all parts of the world the desire for\r\nself-decoration is strongest at the beginning of the age of puberty,\r\nall the above-named customs being practised most zealously at that\r\nperiod of life. Concerning the Dacotahs, Mr. Prescott states that both\r\nsexes adorn themselves at their courtships to make themselves more\r\nattractive, and that “the young only are addicted to dress.”[1024] The\r\nOráon, according to Colonel Dalton, is likewise particular about his\r\npersonal appearance “only so long as he is unmarried.”[1025] Among the\r\nLet-htas in Indo-China, it is the unmarried youths that are profusely\r\nbedecked with red and white bead necklaces, wild boars’ tusks, brass\r\narmlets, and a broad band of black braid below the knee.[1026] Speaking\r\nof the Encounter Bay tribe of South Australia, the Rev. A. Meyer says\r\nthat “the plucking out of the beard and anointing with grease and\r\nochre (which belong to the initiatory ceremony) the men may continue\r\nif they please till about forty years of age, for they consider it\r\nornamental, and fancy that it makes them look younger, and gives\r\nthem an importance in the eyes of the women.”[1027] In Fiji, says\r\nMr. Anderson, the men, “who like to attract the attention of the\r\nopposite sex, don their best plumage;”[1028] and when Mr. Bulmer once\r\nasked an Australian native why he wore his adornments, the native\r\nanswered “that he wore them in order to look well, and to make himself\r\nagreeable to the women.”[1029]\r\n\r\nIt is when boys or girls approach puberty that, in the north-west\r\npart of North America, they have their lower lip perforated for the\r\nlabret;[1030] that, among the American Eskimo, the African Masarwas,\r\nand certain Australian natives, the cartilage between the nostrils is\r\npierced for the reception of a piece of bone, wood, or shell.[1031] At\r\nthe same age, among the Chibchas and the aborigines of the Californian\r\nPeninsula, holes were made in the ears.[1032] It is at this period of\r\nlife, also, that the Chaymas of New Andalusia, the Pelew Islanders, and\r\nthe natives of New Britain have their teeth blackened, as black teeth,\r\nboth for men and women, are considered an indispensable condition of\r\nbeauty;[1033] and that, in several parts of Africa and Australia, they\r\nknock out some teeth, knowing that otherwise they would run the risk\r\nof being refused on account of ugliness.[1034] Among the Nicobarese,\r\namong whom the men blacken their teeth from the period of puberty,\r\nthis disfigurement is indeed so favourably regarded by the fair sex\r\nthat a woman “would scorn to accept the addresses of one possessing\r\nwhite teeth, like a dog or pig.”[1035] Mr. Crawfurd tells us that,\r\nin the Malay Archipelago, the practice of filing and blackening the\r\nteeth, already referred to, is a necessary prelude to marriage, the\r\ncommon way of expressing the fact that a girl has arrived at puberty\r\nbeing that “she has had her teeth filed.”[1036] And, with reference\r\nto some of the natives of the Congo countries, Tuckey states that the\r\ntwo upper front teeth are filed by the men, so as to make a large\r\nopening, and scars are raised on the skin, both being intended by the\r\nmen as ornamental, and “principally done with the idea of rendering\r\nthemselves agreeable to the women.”[1037]\r\n\r\nThe important part played by the hair of the head as a stimulant of\r\nsexual passion appears in a curious way from Mr. Sibree’s account of\r\nKing Radàma’s attempt to introduce European customs among the Hovas\r\nof Madagascar. As soon as he had adopted the military tactics of the\r\nEnglish, he ordered that all his officers and soldiers should have\r\ntheir hair cut; but this command produced so great a disturbance among\r\nthe women of the capital that they assembled in great numbers to\r\nprotest against the king’s order, and could not be quieted till they\r\nwere surrounded by troops and their leaders cruelly speared.[1038]\r\nEverywhere it is the young and unmarried people who are most anxious\r\nto dress their hair.[1039] Thus, among the Bunjogees, a Chittagong\r\nHill tribe, the young men “stuff a large ball of black cotton into\r\ntheir topknot to make it look bigger.”[1040] In the Tenimber Group,\r\nthe lads decorate their long locks with leaves, flowers, and feathers,\r\nas Riedel says, “only in order to please the women.”[1041] Among the\r\nTacullies, “the elderly people neglect to ornament their heads, in\r\nthe same manner as they do the rest of their persons, and generally\r\nwear their hair short. But the younger people of both sexes, who feel\r\nmore solicitous to make themselves agreeable to each other, wash and\r\npaint their faces and let their hair grow long.”[1042] And in the\r\nAdmiralty Islands, according to Professor Moseley, “only the young men\r\nof apparently from eighteen to thirty, or so, wear the hair long and\r\ncombed out into a mop or bush,” whilst the boys or older men wear the\r\nhair short.[1043]\r\n\r\nPassing to the practice of painting the body: Dr. Sparrman tells us\r\nthat the two Hottentots whom he had in his service, when they expected\r\nto meet some girls of their own nation, painted their noses, cheeks,\r\nand the middle of the forehead with soot.[1044] On Flinders Island,\r\nwhither the remnant of the Tasmanians were removed, a rebellion nearly\r\nburst out when orders were once issued forbidding the use of ochre\r\nand grease, for “the young men feared the loss of favour in the eyes\r\nof their countrywomen.”[1045] Among the Guarayos, the suitor, when\r\ncourting, keeps for some days close to the cabin of the mistress of\r\nhis heart, he being painted from head to foot, and armed with his\r\nbattle club.[1046] In certain parts of Australia, when a boy arrives\r\nat the age of puberty, his hair, body, and limbs are profusely smeared\r\nwith red ochre and fat, this being one of the rites by which he is\r\ninitiated into the privileges of manhood.[1047] Again, with reference\r\nto the Ahts, Mr. Sproat remarks that “some of the young men streak\r\ntheir faces with red, but grown-up men seldom now use paint, unless\r\non particular occasions.” The women cease to use it about the age of\r\ntwenty-five.[1048]\r\n\r\nThe girls are generally painted when they arrive at the epoch of the\r\nfirst menstruation.[1049] Thus, among certain Equatorial Africans,\r\nthey are rubbed with black, red, and white paints in the course of a\r\nceremony which, according to Mr. Reade, is essentially of a Phallic\r\nnature.[1050] If a young maiden of the Tapoyers of Brazil “be\r\nmarriageable, and yet not courted by any, the mother paints her with\r\nsome red colour about the eyes.”[1051]\r\n\r\nThe act of tattooing, also, generally takes place at the age of\r\npuberty, in the case of men as well as in that of women. It is about\r\nthat period that, in the underlip of all freeborn female Thlinkets,\r\n“a slit is made parallel with the mouth, and about half an inch\r\nbelow it;”[1052] that, among the Eskimo, pigments of various dye are\r\npricked on the chin, at the angles of the mouth, and across the face\r\nover the cheek-bones;[1053] that, in some South American tribes,\r\nincisions are made from the shoulders of the girl to her waist, “when\r\nshe is regarded as a delicious morsel for the arms of an ardent\r\nlover.”[1054] At the same age, either or both sexes are subject to\r\ntattooing among the Guarayos,[1055] Abipones,[1056] Baris,[1057]\r\nGonds,[1058] Dyaks,[1059] Negritos of the Philippines,[1060] South\r\nSea Islanders,[1061] Australians,[1062] &c. Among the Nagas of Upper\r\nAssam, it was the custom “to allow matrimony to those only who made\r\nthemselves as hideous as possible by having their faces elaborately\r\ntattooed.”[1063] The Makalaka girls, before they could marry, had to\r\nsubmit to horrible torture, about four thousand stitches being made\r\nin the skin of the chest and stomach, and a black fluid being rubbed\r\ninto the wounds.[1064] In New Zealand, according to the Rev. R. Taylor,\r\nit was the great ambition of the young to have fine tattooed faces,\r\n“both to render themselves attractive to the ladies, and conspicuous\r\nin war.”[1065] In Samoa, until a young man was tattooed, he could not\r\nthink of marriage, but as soon as this was done, he considered himself\r\nentitled to all the privileges of mature years.[1066] “When it is\r\nall over,” says Mr. Pritchard, “and the youths thoroughly healed, a\r\ngrand dance is got up on the first available pretext to display the\r\ntattooing, when the admiration of the fair sex is unsparingly bestowed.\r\nAnd this is the great reward, long and anxiously looked forward to by\r\nthe youths as they smart under the hands of the ‘matai.’”[1067] Often,\r\nhowever, the operation is accomplished not at once, but at different\r\ntimes, that the patients may be able to bear the inflammation and pain\r\nat every stage of the process; and not unfrequently it begins when the\r\ngirls are quite young children, being constantly added to until they\r\nmarry.[1068]\r\n\r\nThe real object of the custom is shown also by several other\r\nstatements. When Mertens asked the natives of Lukunor what was the\r\nmeaning of tattooing, one of them answered, “It has the same object\r\nas your clothes, that is, to please the women.”[1069] Bancroft\r\nremarks that young Kadiak wives “secure the affectionate admiration\r\nof their husbands by tattooing the breast and adorning the face with\r\nblack lines.”[1070] The raised cuts of the Australians, according to\r\nMr. Palmer, are “merely ornamental and convey no idea of tribal\r\nconnection,” the women marking themselves in this manner “to add to\r\ntheir looks, and to make themselves attractive.”[1071] Barrington\r\nassures us that, among the natives of Botany Bay, “scars are, by\r\nboth sexes, deemed highly ornamental;”[1072] and, in the Eucla tribe,\r\naccording to Mr. W. Williams, both sexes make horizontal scars on\r\nthe chest and vertical scars on the upper arm “for the purpose of\r\nornamentation.”[1073] In Ponapé, as we are informed by von Kubary\r\nand Finsch, tattooing is practised only as a means of improving the\r\nappearance;[1074] and, in New Guinea, the women tattoo themselves “to\r\nplease the men.”[1075] Bock remarks, “As the Dyak women are tattooed\r\nto please their lovers, so the Laos men undergo the ordeal for the sake\r\nof the women.”[1076]\r\n\r\nIn Samoa, great licentiousness was connected with the custom of\r\ntattooing; and, in Tahiti, the chiefs prohibited it altogether on\r\naccount of the obscene practices by which it was invariably accompanied\r\nin that island.[1077] The Tahitians have also a very characteristic\r\ntale of its origin. Taaroa, their god, and Apouvaru had a daughter, who\r\nwas called Hinaeree-remonoi. “As she grew up, in order to preserve\r\nher chastity, she was made ‘pahio,’ or kept in a kind of enclosure,\r\nand constantly attended by her mother. Intent on her seduction, the\r\nbrothers invented tattooing, and marked each other with the figure\r\ncalled Taomaro. Thus ornamented, they appeared before their sister,\r\nwho admired the figures, and, in order to be tattooed herself, eluding\r\nthe care of her mother, broke the enclosure that had been erected for\r\nher preservation, was tattooed, and became also the victim to the\r\ndesigns of her brothers. Tattooing thus originated among the gods,\r\nand was first practised by the children of Taaroa, their principal\r\ndeity. In imitation of their example, and for the accomplishment of the\r\nsame purposes, it was practised among men.... The two sons of Taaroa\r\nand Apouvaru were the gods of tattooing. Their images were kept in\r\nthe temples of those who practised the art professionally, and every\r\napplication of their skill was preceded by a prayer addressed to them,\r\nthat the operation might not occasion death, that the wounds might soon\r\nheal, that the figures might be handsome, attract admirers, and answer\r\nthe ends of wickedness designed.”[1078]\r\n\r\nThis legend is especially instructive because it shows how a custom\r\nwhich had originally nothing to do with religion may in time take a\r\nmore or less religious character. Professor Wundt holds that, in most\r\ncases, religious ideas are the original sources from which customs\r\nflow;[1079] but it is far more probable that the connection between\r\nreligion and custom is often secondary. Nearly every practice which for\r\nsome reason or other has come into fashion and taken root among the\r\npeople, is readily supposed to have a divine sanction; and this is one\r\nof the reasons why conservatism as to religion is so often accompanied\r\nby conservatism in other matters. This must especially be the case\r\namong savage men who identify their ancestors with their gods, and\r\nconsequently look upon ancient customs as divine institutions.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, difficult to believe that the motives which gave rise to\r\ntattooing can have been different from those which led to the painting\r\nof the body. The chief distinction between the two is, that the\r\ntattooed marks are indelible, being neither extinguished nor rendered\r\nfainter by lapse of time. Hence the prevalence of tattooing may be\r\nexplained by a general desire among savages to make the decorations of\r\nthe body permanent. Sometimes, too, the custom seems to be kept up as a\r\ntest of courage.[1080]\r\n\r\nEven to European tastes the incised lines and figures have in many\r\ncases a certain beauty. Thus, speaking of the Gambier Islanders,\r\nBeechey assures us that the tattooing undoubtedly improves their\r\nappearance; and Yate remarks that “nothing can exceed the beautiful\r\nregularity with which the faces and thighs of the New Zealanders are\r\ntattooed,” the volutes being perfect specimens, and the regularity\r\nmechanically correct.[1081] Forster observed that, among the natives\r\nof Waitahoo (Marquesas Islands), the punctures were disposed with the\r\nutmost care, so that the marks on each leg, arm, and cheek and on the\r\ncorresponding muscles were exactly similar.[1082] Among the Tahitians,\r\naccording to Darwin, the ornaments follow the curvature of the body so\r\ngracefully, that they have a very pleasing and elegant effect; and,\r\namong the Easter Islanders, “all the lines were drawn with much taste,\r\nand carried in the direction of the muscle.”[1083] The fact that the\r\ntattooed lines follow closely the natural forms of the body in order to\r\nrender them more conspicuous, has been observed in the case of other\r\npeoples also,[1084] and it would be ridiculous to regard such marks as\r\ntransformed images of gods.\r\n\r\nThe facts stated seem to show that the object of tattooing,[1085]\r\nas well as of other kinds of self-decoration or mutilation, was to\r\nstimulate the sexual desire of the opposite sex. To us it appears\r\nstrange that such repugnant practices as that of perforating the septum\r\nof the nose or removing teeth should owe their origin to coquetry, but\r\nwe must not judge of the taste of savages by our own. In this case the\r\ndesire for self-decoration is to a great extent identical with the wish\r\nto attract attention, to excite by means of the charm of novelty.[1086]\r\nAt all stages of civilization people like a slight variety, but\r\ndeviations from what they are accustomed to see must not be too great,\r\nnor of such a kind as to provoke a disagreeable association of ideas.\r\nIn Cochin China, where the women blacken their teeth, a man said of\r\nthe wife of the English Ambassador contemptuously that “she had\r\nwhite teeth like a dog;”[1087] and the Abipones in South America, who\r\ncarefully plucked out all the hairs with which our eyes are naturally\r\nprotected, despised the Europeans for their thick eyebrows, and called\r\nthem brothers to the ostriches, who have very thick brows.[1088] We, on\r\nthe other hand, would dislike to see a woman with a crystal or a piece\r\nof wood in her lip.\r\n\r\nIt is a common notion that women are by nature vainer and more addicted\r\nto dressing and decorating themselves than men. This certainly does\r\nnot hold good for savage and barbarous peoples in general. It is true\r\nthat, among many of them, tattooing is exclusively or predominantly\r\nlimited to the women, and that the men sometimes wear fewer ornaments.\r\nBut several travellers, as for instance Dr. Schweinfurth[1089] and\r\nDr. Barth,[1090] who have a vast experience of African races, agree\r\nthat the reverse is usually the case. The women of all the tribes of\r\nIndians Richardson saw on his route through the northern parts of the\r\nfur countries, adorned their persons less than the men of the same\r\ntribes; and the like is said of the Comanches.[1091] Among the Uaupés,\r\nMr. Wallace observed “that the men and boys appropriated all the\r\nornaments.”[1092] The native women of Orangerie Bay of New Guinea,\r\nexcept that they are tattooed, adorn themselves less than the men,\r\nand none of them paint their faces and bodies, as the men frequently\r\ndo.[1093] In the Admiralty Islands, young girls “sometimes have a\r\nnecklace or two on, but they never are decorated to the extent to which\r\nthe men are,” it being evidently not considered good taste for them to\r\nadorn their persons.[1094] Among the aborigines of the New Hebrides,\r\nNew Hanover, New Ireland,[1095] and Australia,[1096] adornments are\r\nalmost entirely monopolised by the men, the “fair sex” being content\r\nwith their natural charms.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the plainer appearance of the women\r\ndepends upon their oppressed and despised position, as well as upon\r\nthe selfishness of the men.[1097] But it is doubtful whether this is\r\nthe true explanation. Savage ornaments, generally speaking, are not\r\ncostly things, and even where the state of women is most degraded\r\na woman may, if she pleases, paint her body with red ochre or put\r\na piece of wood through her lip or a feather through the cartilage\r\nof the nose. In Eastern Central Africa, for instance, the women are\r\nmore decorated than the men, although they hold an inferior position,\r\nbeing viewed as beasts of burden, and doing all the harder work. “A\r\nwoman,” says Mr. Macdonald, “always kneels when she has occasion to\r\ntalk to a man.”[1098] Almost the same is said of the female Indians of\r\nGuiana;[1099] whereas in the Yule Island, on the Coast of New Guinea,\r\nand in New Hanover, the women are less given to personal adornment\r\nthan the men, although they are held in respect, have influence in\r\ntheir families, and exercise, in some villages, much authority, or even\r\nsupremacy.[1100]\r\n\r\nOf all the various kinds of self-ornamentation tattooing is the most\r\nlaborious. Yet, in Melanesia, it is chiefly women that are tattooed,\r\nthough they are treated as slaves; whilst in Polynesia, where the\r\n_status_ of women is comparatively good, this practice is mainly\r\nconfined to the men.[1101] In Fiji, where women were fearfully\r\noppressed, genuine tattooing was found on them only.[1102]\r\n\r\nIt is expressly stated of the women of several savage peoples that\r\nthey are less desirous of self-decoration than the men. Speaking of\r\nthe Aleuts on the Fur-Seal Islands of Alaska, Mr. Elliott says, “In\r\nthese lower races there is much more vanity displayed by the masculine\r\nelement than the feminine, according to my observation; in other words,\r\nI have noticed a greater desire among the young men than among the\r\nyoung women of savage and semi-civilised people to be gaily dressed,\r\nand to look fine.”[1103] Among the Gambier Islanders, according to\r\nBeechey, the women “have no ornaments of any kind, and appeared quite\r\nindifferent to the beads and trinkets which were offered them.”[1104]\r\nIn Tierra del Fuego, Lieutenant Bove found the men more desirous of\r\nornaments than the women; and Proyart made a similar observation with\r\nregard to the people of Loango.[1105] Again, touching the Crees,\r\nMackenzie remarks that “the women, though by no means inattentive to\r\nthe decoration of their own persons, appear to have a still greater\r\ndegree of pride attending to the appearance of the men, whose faces are\r\npainted with more care than those of the women.”[1106]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, then, to believe that the inferior position of the\r\nweaker sex accounts for the comparative scarcity of female ornaments.\r\nThe fact may to some extent be explained by Mr. Spencer’s suggestion,\r\nthat ornaments have partly originated from trophy-badges, and Professor\r\nWundt’s, that they indicate rank and fortune: but these explanations\r\napply only to a few cases. If it be true that man began to decorate\r\nhimself chiefly in order to stimulate the passions of the opposite sex,\r\nwe may conclude that the vanity of the men is, in the first place,\r\ndue to the likings of the women, and that the plainer appearance\r\nof the women is a consequence of the men’s greater indifference to\r\ntheir ornaments. Mr. Darwin has shown that, among our domesticated\r\nquadrupeds, individual antipathies and preferences are exhibited much\r\nmore commonly by the female than by the male,[1107] and the same, as\r\nwe shall see, is in some measure the case with man also. It is the\r\nwomen rather than the men that have to be courted. Thus, with reference\r\nto the natives of Gippsland, Mr. Brough Smyth, on the authority of\r\nMr. Bulmer, states, “The ornaments worn by the females were not much\r\nregarded by the men. The woman did little to improve her appearance;\r\n... if her physical aspect was such as to attract admirers she was\r\ncontent.”[1108]\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that among savages it is, as a rule, the man\r\nonly that runs the risk of being obliged to lead a single life. Hence\r\nit is obvious that to the best of his ability he must endeavour to\r\nbe taken into favour by making himself as attractive as possible. In\r\ncivilized Europe, on the other hand, the opposite occurs. Here it is\r\nthe woman that has the greatest difficulty in getting married—and she\r\nis also the vainer of the two.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis as to the origin of the customs in question, set forth\r\nin this chapter, presupposes of course that savage girls enjoy great\r\nliberty in the choice of a mate. It will be seen subsequently that\r\nthere can be no doubt as to the accuracy of that presumption.\r\n\r\nAt a higher stage of civilization the tendency of mankind is to give\r\nup savage ornaments, and no longer to regard mutilations of the body\r\nas improving the appearance. In Persia, women still wear the nose-ring\r\nthrough one side of the nostril,[1109] but to a European such a custom\r\nwould be extremely displeasing. In the Western world the ear-ring is\r\nthe last vanishing relic of savage taste.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the naked body the ornaments were transferred to clothing, partly\r\nbecause climate made clothes necessary, partly for another reason. “A\r\nsavage begins,” Professor Moseley says, “by painting or tattooing\r\nhimself for ornament. Then he adopts a movable appendage, which he\r\nhangs on his body, and on which he puts the ornamentation which he\r\nformerly marked more or less indelibly on his skin. In this way he is\r\nable to gratify _his taste for change_.”[1110]\r\n\r\nIt is usually said that man began to cover his body for two reasons:\r\nfirst, to protect himself from frost and damp; secondly, on account of\r\na feeling of shame.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that, when man emigrated from his warm native\r\nhome and settled down in less hospitable zones, it became necessary for\r\nhim to screen himself from the influences of a raw climate. The Eskimo\r\nwrap themselves up in furs, and the wretched natives of Tierra del\r\nFuego throw a piece of sealskin over one of their shoulders, “on the\r\nside from which the wind blows.”[1111]\r\n\r\nThe second motive, too, seems acceptable at first sight. The savage men\r\nof the tropics, though otherwise entirely naked, commonly wear a scanty\r\ndress which Europeans might readily suppose to be used for the sake\r\nof decency. Nothing of the sort is found in any other animal species;\r\nhence Professor Wundt concludes that shame is “a feeling specifically\r\npeculiar to man.”[1112]\r\n\r\nBut why should man blush to expose one part of the body more than\r\nanother? This is no matter of course, but a problem to be solved.\r\n\r\nThe feeling in question cannot be regarded as originally innate in\r\nmankind. There are many peoples, who, though devoid of any kind of\r\ndress, show no trace of shame, and others who, when they dress\r\nthemselves, pay not the least regard to what we consider the first\r\nrequirements of decency.\r\n\r\nThus, in the northern parts of the Californian Peninsula, both men and\r\nwomen have been found in a state of nudity.[1113] Among the Miwok,\r\naccording to their own confession, persons of both sexes and of all\r\nages were formerly absolutely naked.[1114] Lyman found the same to be\r\nthe case with the Paiuches in northern Colorado, Columbus with the\r\naborigines of Hispaniola, Pizarro with the Indians of Coca, v. Humboldt\r\nwith the Chaymas, Wallace with the Purupurús, v. Schütz-Holzhausen with\r\nthe Catamixis, Prince Maximilian with the Puris at St. Fidelis, Azara\r\nwith certain Indians in the neighbourhood of the river Paraguay.[1115]\r\nIn some Indian tribes the men alone go naked,[1116] in others the\r\nwomen.[1117] Again, in North America, Mackenzie met a troop of\r\nnatives, of whom the men wore many ornaments and much clothing, but\r\nhad, apparently, not the slightest notion of bashfulness. And of the\r\nFuegians we are told that, although they have the shoulder or the back\r\nprotected by a sealskin, the rest of the body is perfectly naked.[1118]\r\n\r\nThe men of most Australian tribes, and in many cases the women, wear\r\nno clothes except in cold weather, when they throw a kangaroo skin\r\nabout their shoulders. “They are as innocent of shame,” says Mr.\r\nPalmer, “as the animals of the forests.”[1119] In Tasmania, too,\r\nthe aborigines were usually naked, or, when they covered themselves,\r\nthey showed that the idea of decency had not occurred to them.[1120]\r\nThe same is said of some tribes in Borneo[1121] and Sumatra,[1122]\r\nthe people of Jarai, bordering upon the empire of Siam,[1123] the\r\ninhabitants of the Louisiade Archipelago,[1124] Solomon Islands,[1125]\r\nPenrhyn Island, and some other islands of the South Sea;[1126] whilst,\r\nin others, only the men generally go naked.[1127] The Papuans of the\r\nsouth-west coast of New Guinea “glory in their nudeness, and consider\r\nclothing to be fit only for women.”[1128] In one part of Timor, on the\r\nother hand,[1129] as also in a tribe of the Andamanese,[1130] it is the\r\nwomen that are devoid of any kind of covering.\r\n\r\nPassing to Africa, we meet with instances of the same kind. Concerning\r\nthe Wa-taveita of the eastern equatorial region, Mr. Johnston remarks\r\nthat “both sexes have little notion or conception of decency, the men\r\nespecially seeming to be unconscious of any impropriety in nakedness.\r\nWhat clothing they have is worn as an adornment or for warmth at night\r\nand early morning.”[1131] The Wa-chaga and Mashukulumbe generally go\r\nabout naked,[1132] and so do the Bushmans, except when they use a\r\npiece of skin barely sufficient to cover the back.[1133] Again, among\r\nthe Bubis of Fernando Po[1134] and the natives of Balonda[1135] and\r\nLoango,[1136] the women have no sort of covering, whilst, among the\r\nNegroes of the Egyptian Soudan,[1137] the Baris,[1138] Shilluk,[1139]\r\nDinka,[1140] Watuta,[1141] and Masai,[1142] this is the case with\r\nthe men only. Apud Masaios membrum virile celare turpe existimatur,\r\nhonestum expromere, atque etiam ostentare.[1143] In Lancerote also,\r\naccording to Bontier and Le Verrier, the men used no covering; and,\r\nin Teneriffe, “the inhabitants went naked, except some few who wore\r\ngoatskins.”[1144]\r\n\r\nIt might perhaps be supposed that the feeling of modesty, though\r\nnot originally innate, appeared later on, at a certain stage of\r\ncivilization, either spontaneously or from some unknown cause. This\r\nseems, indeed, to be the opinion of Professor Wundt, who says that man\r\nbegan to cover himself from decency.[1145] But let us see what covering\r\nsavages often use.\r\n\r\nA fashionable young Wintun woman, says Mr. Powers, wears a girdle of\r\ndeer-skin, the lower edge of which is slit into a long fringe with a\r\npolished pine-nut at the end of each strand, while the upper border\r\nand other portions are studded with brilliant bits of shell.[1146] The\r\nBotocudos use a covering which has little resemblance to a garment; and\r\ntheir neighbours, the Patachos and Machacaris, make this trifle still\r\nsmaller, a thread being sufficient clothing, according to their notion\r\nof modesty.[1147] When a Carib girl attained the age of ten or twelve\r\nyears, she assumed around the waist “a piece of cotton cloth worked\r\nand embroidered with minute grains of shells of different colours,\r\ndecorated in the lower part with fringe.”[1148] Similar ornamental\r\nskirts are in use among the Macusís, Arawaks, and other South American\r\npeoples.[1149] Among the Guaycurûs, the men had no covering, except\r\na narrow bandage round the loins, which was of coloured cotton, and\r\noften adorned with glass beads.[1150] The Australians of Port Essington\r\noccasionally wear girdles of finely twisted human hair, and the men\r\nsometimes add a tassel of the hair of the opossum or flying squirrel,\r\nsuspended in front.[1151] The women on the Lower Murray manufacture\r\nround mats of grass or reeds, which they fasten upon their backs,\r\n“tying them in front, so that they almost resemble the shell of a\r\ntortoise.”[1152] In Tahiti, a “maro,” composed of red and yellow\r\nfeathers, was considered a present of very great value, and the women\r\nthought it “most ornamental” to enfold their loins with many windings\r\nof cloth.[1153] Dr. Seemann states that, in Fiji, the girls “wore\r\nnothing save a girdle of hibiscus-fibres, about six inches wide, dyed\r\nblack, red, yellow, white, or brown, and put on in such a coquettish\r\nway, that one thought it must come off every moment.”[1154] A similar\r\npractice is common in the islands of the Pacific, fringes made of\r\ncocoa-nut fibre or of leaves slit into narrow strips or filaments of\r\nbark, frequently dyed with gaudy colours, being, in most of these\r\nislands, the only garment of the natives. This costume, with its\r\nconspicuous tint and mobile fringe, has a most graceful appearance and\r\na very pretty effect, but is far from being in harmony with our ideas\r\nof modesty. In the island of Yap, according to Cheyne, “the dress of\r\nthe males, if such it may be called, is slovenly in the extreme. They\r\nwear the ‘maro’ next them, and, by way of improvement, a bunch of bark\r\nfibres dyed red, over it.”[1155] In New Caledonia, in Forster’s time,\r\nthe natives only tied “a string round the middle and another round\r\nthe neck;”[1156] whilst, in some other groups, the costume of the men\r\nconsisted of nothing but a leaf,[1157] a mussel,[1158] or a shell.[1159]\r\n\r\nIn Sumatra, according to Marsden, young women, before they are of an\r\nage to be clothed, have a plate of silver in the shape of a heart\r\nhung in front by a chain of the same metal.[1160] Among the Garos of\r\nBengal, the women wear merely a very short piece of striped blue cotton\r\nround the waist. The men have a very narrow waist-cloth tied behind\r\nand then brought up between the legs; the portion hanging over in\r\nfront is sometimes adorned with brass boss-like ornaments, and white\r\nlong-shaped beads.[1161] In Lukungu, the entire covering of most of the\r\nwomen consists of a narrow string with some white china beads threaded\r\non it.[1162] The Hottentot women, according to Barrow, bestowed their\r\nlargest and most splendid ornaments upon the little apron, about\r\nseven or eight inches wide, that hung from the waist. “Great pains,”\r\nhe says, “seem to be taken by the women to attract notice towards\r\nthis part of their persons. Large metal buttons, shells of the cypræa\r\ngenus, with the apertures outwards, or anything that makes a great\r\nshow, are fastened to the borders of this apron.”[1163] The Bushman\r\nwomen of South Africa, met with by the same traveller, had as their\r\nonly covering a belt of springbok’s skin, the part which was intended\r\nto hang in front being cut into long threads. But the filaments, he\r\nsays, “were so small and thin that they answered no sort of use as\r\na covering; nor, indeed, did the females, either old or young, seem\r\nto feel any sense of shame in appearing before us naked.”[1164] And\r\namong the Negroes of Benin, according to Bosman, the girls had no other\r\ngarment than some strings of coral twisted about the middle.[1165]\r\n\r\nIt seems utterly improbable that such “garments” owe their origin to\r\nthe feeling of shame. Their ornamental character being obvious, there\r\ncan be but little doubt that men and women originally, at least in\r\nmany cases, covered themselves not from modesty, but on the contrary,\r\nin order to make themselves more attractive—the men to women, and the\r\nwomen to men.\r\n\r\nIn a state where all go perfectly nude, nakedness must appear quite\r\nnatural, for what we see day after day makes no special impression\r\nupon us. But when one or another—whether man or woman—began to put on\r\na bright-coloured fringe, some gaudy feathers, a string with beads, a\r\nbundle of leaves, a piece of cloth, or a dazzling shell, this could not\r\nof course escape the attention of the others; and the scanty covering\r\nwas found to act as the most powerful attainable sexual stimulus.[1166]\r\nHence the popularity of such garments in the savage world.\r\n\r\nSeveral travellers have noticed that there is nothing indecent in\r\nabsolute nakedness when the eyes have got accustomed to it. “Where all\r\nmen go naked, as for instance in New Holland,” says Forster, “custom\r\nfamiliarizes them to each other’s eyes, as much as if they went wholly\r\nmuffled up in garments.”[1167] Speaking of a Port Jackson woman who was\r\nentirely uncovered, Captain Hunter remarks, “There is such an air of\r\ninnocence about her that clothing scarcely appears necessary.”[1168]\r\nWith reference to the Uupés, Mr. Wallace records his opinion that\r\n“there is far more immodesty in the transparent and flesh-coloured\r\ngarments of our stage-dancers, than in the perfect nudity of these\r\ndaughters of the forest.”[1169] In his ‘Africa Unveiled’ Mr. Rowley\r\nremarks, “When the sight becomes accustomed to the absence of raiment,\r\nyour sense of propriety is far less offended than in England, where\r\nample clothing is made the vehicle for asserting defiance, if not of\r\nactual law, yet of the wishes and feelings of the more virtuous part\r\nof the community.”[1170] And, speaking of the Fuegians, Captain Snow\r\nsays, “More harm, I think, is done by false modesty,—by covering and\r\n_partly_ clothing, than by the truth in nature always appearing as it\r\nis. Intermingling with savages of wild lands who do not clothe, gives\r\none, I believe, less impure and sensual feelings than the merely mixing\r\nwith society of a higher kind.”[1171]\r\n\r\nThe same view is taken by Dr. Zimmermann,[1172] and by Mr. Reade, who,\r\nwith reference to the natives of Central Africa, remarks that there\r\nis nothing voluptuous in the excessive _déshabillé_ of an equatorial\r\ngirl, nothing being so moral and so unlikely to excite the passions\r\nas nakedness.[1173] Speaking of the Wa-chaga, Mr. Johnston observes,\r\n“We should be apt to call, from our point of view, their nakedness\r\nand almost unconsciousness of shame indelicate, but it is rather, when\r\none gets used to it, a pleasing survival of the old innocent days when\r\nprurient thoughts were absent from the mind of man.”[1174] As a careful\r\nobserver remarks,[1175] true modesty lies in the entire absence of\r\nthought upon the subject. Among medical students and artists the nude\r\ncauses no extraordinary emotion; indeed, Flaxman asserted that the\r\nstudents in entering the academy seem to hang up their passions along\r\nwith their hats.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Forster says of the natives of Mallicollo, that “it\r\nis uncertain whether the scanty dress of their women owes its origin to\r\na sense of shame, or to an artful endeavour to please;” and of the men\r\nof Tana, that “round their middle they tie a string, and below that\r\nthey employ the leaves of a plant like ginger, for the same purpose\r\nand in the same manner as the natives of Mallicollo. Boys, as soon as\r\nthey attain the age of six years, are provided with these leaves; which\r\nseems to confirm what I have observed in regard to the Mallicollese,\r\n_viz._, that they do not employ this covering from motives of decency.\r\nIndeed, it had so much the contrary appearance, that in the person\r\nof every native of Tana or Mallicollo, we thought we beheld a living\r\nrepresentation of that terrible divinity who protected the orchard\r\nand gardens of the ancients.”[1176] Speaking of the very simple dress\r\nworn by the male Hottentot, Barrow says, “If the real intent of it\r\nwas the promotion of decency, it should seem that he has widely missed\r\nhis aim, as it is certainly one of the most immodest objects, in such\r\na situation as he places it, that could have been contrived.”[1177]\r\nAmong the Khyoungtha, there is a native tradition worth mentioning in\r\nthis connection. “A certain queen,” Captain Lewin tells us, “noticed\r\nwith regret that the men of the nation were losing their love for\r\nthe society of the women, and were resorting to vile and abominable\r\npractices, from which the worst possible results might be expected.\r\nShe therefore prevailed upon her husband to promulgate a rigorous\r\norder, prescribing the form of petticoat to be worn by all women in\r\nfuture, and directing that the male should be tattooed, in order that,\r\nby thus disfiguring the males, and adding _piquancy to the beauty of\r\nthe women_, the former might once more return to the feet of their\r\nwives.”[1178]\r\n\r\nMoreover, we know that some tribes who go perfectly naked are ashamed\r\nto cover themselves, looking upon a garment as something indecent. The\r\npious father Gumilla was greatly astonished to find that the Indians on\r\nthe Orinoco did not blush at their nakedness. “Si les Missionnaires”\r\nhe says, “qui ignorent leurs coutumes s’avisent de distribuer des\r\nmouchoirs, surtout aux femmes, pour qu’elles puissent se couvrir,\r\nelles les jettent dans la rivière, où elles vont les cacher, pour\r\nne point être obligées de s’en servir; et lors qu’on leur dit de se\r\ncouvrir, elles répondent: ... ‘Nous ne couvrons point, _parce que cela\r\nnous cause de la honte_.’”[1179] That this is no “traveller’s tale”\r\nmerely, appears from the following statement made by v. Humboldt with\r\nreference to the New Andalusian Chaymas, who, like most savage peoples\r\ndwelling in regions excessively hot, have an insuperable aversion to\r\nclothing:—“Under the torrid zone,” he asserts, “ ... the natives are\r\nashamed, as they say, to be clothed; and flee to the woods when they\r\nare too soon compelled to give up their nakedness.”[1180] Again, in an\r\nIndian hut at Mucúra in Brazil, Mr. Wallace found the women entirely\r\nwithout covering, and apparently quite unconscious of the fact. One of\r\nthem, however, possessed a “saía,” or petticoat, which she sometimes\r\nput on, and seemed then, as Mr. Wallace says, “almost as much ashamed\r\nof herself as civilized people would be if they took theirs off.”[1181]\r\n\r\nThere are several instances of peoples who, although they generally\r\ngo perfectly naked, sometimes use a covering. This they always do\r\nunder circumstances which plainly indicate that the covering is worn\r\nsimply as a means of attraction. Thus Lohmann tells us that, among\r\nthe Saliras, only harlots clothe themselves; and they do so in order\r\nto excite through the unknown.[1182] In many heathen tribes in the\r\ninterior of Africa, according to Barth, the married women are entirely\r\nnude, whilst the young marriageable girls cover their nakedness,—a\r\npractice analogous to that of a married woman being deprived of her\r\nornaments and her hair.[1183] Mr. Mathews states that, in many parts\r\nof Australia, “the females, and more especially young girls, wear a\r\nfringe suspended from a belt round the waist.”[1184] Concerning the\r\nnatives of Botany Bay (New South Wales), Barrington remarks that “the\r\nfemales at an early age wear a little apron, made from the skin of the\r\nopossum or kangaroo, cut into slips, and hanging a few inches from\r\nthe waist; this they wear till they grow up and are taken by men, and\r\nthen they are left off.”[1185] Collins says the same of the girls at\r\nPort Jackson;[1186] Mr. Palmer of some other Australians;[1187] and\r\nCaptain Snow of all those tribes among whom he had been for several\r\nweeks.[1188] Again, on Moreton Island, according to Macgillivray, both\r\nmen and women went about altogether unclothed, but the female children\r\nwore a small fringe in front. The same naturalist reports that, in\r\nalmost all the tribes of Torris Strait, the women wear a petticoat\r\nof fine shreds of pandanus leaves, the ends worked into a waistband,\r\nupon the construction of which much labour is expended; but it is only\r\n“sometimes put on, especially by the young girls, and when about to\r\nengage in dancing.” Under this, however, another covering is usually\r\nworn.[1189] Among the Tupi tribes of Brazil, as soon as a girl became\r\nmarriageable “cotton cords were tied round her waist and round the\r\nfleshy part of both arms; they denoted a state of maidenhood, and, if\r\nany one but a maiden wore them, they were persuaded that the Anhanga\r\nwould fetch her away.... It cannot,” Mr. Southey adds, “have been\r\ninvented for the purpose of keeping the women chaste till marriage, for\r\nthese bands were broken without fear, and incontinence was not regarded\r\nas an offence.”[1190] Among the Narrinyeri of Southern Australia, girls\r\nwear a sort of apron of fringe until they bear their first child, and,\r\nif they have no children, it is taken from them and burned by the\r\nhusband while they are asleep.[1191] In the Koombokkaburra tribe also,\r\nthe young women wear in front an apron of spun opossum fur, which is\r\ngenerally given up after the birth of the first or second child.[1192]\r\n\r\nThere are several cases in which only the married women are clothed,\r\nthe unmarried going entirely naked.[1193] But such instances do not\r\nconflict with the hypothesis suggested. Through long-continued use\r\ncovering loses its original character and becomes a sign of modesty,\r\nwhilst perfect nakedness becomes a stimulus. Usually, where nudity is\r\nconsidered indecent, the garments of the girls of barbarous peoples\r\nare restricted as much as possible, whilst those of the older women\r\nare comparatively seemly. Thus, among the African Schulis, the married\r\nwomen wear a narrow fringe of string in front, the unmarried wearing\r\nnothing but bead ornaments.[1194] Among the natives of Tassai, New\r\nGuinea, the former use a larger and thicker kind of petticoat of\r\npandanus leaf, divided into long grass-like shreds, reaching to the\r\nknee; while that worn by the latter consists merely of single lengths\r\nmade fast to a string which ties round the waist.[1195] In Fiji,\r\nthe liku—a kind of band made from hibiscus-bark—is before marriage\r\nworn very short, but after the birth of the first child is much\r\nlengthened;[1196] and a similar practice occurs in other islands of the\r\nSouth Sea.[1197]\r\n\r\nThe dances and festivals of many savage peoples are notoriously\r\naccompanied by the most hideous licentiousness. Then the young men\r\nand women endeavour to please each other in various ways, painting\r\nthemselves with brilliant colours, and decorating themselves with all\r\nsorts of ornaments.[1198] On such occasions many tribes who go naked\r\nin everyday life put on a scanty covering. Mr. Bonwick states that,\r\namong the Tasmanians, a fur string or band of emu feathers was used\r\nby some tribes, but only on great festivities; and the women wore\r\nin the dance a covering of leaves or feathers, which, as among the\r\nAustralians on similar occasions, was removed directly afterwards.\r\nTasmanian dances were performed “with the avowed intention of exciting\r\nthe passions of the men, in whose presence one young woman had the\r\ndance to herself.”[1199] Among the Australian Pegulloburras, who\r\ngenerally go entirely naked, the women on festive occasions wear round\r\nthe middle small fringes.[1200] Speaking of the Brazilian Uaupés, Mr.\r\nWallace asserts that, “while dancing in their festivals, the women\r\nwear a small ‘tanga,’ or apron, made of beads, prettily arranged. It\r\nis only about six inches square, but is never worn at any other time,\r\nand immediately the dance is over, it is taken off.” Besides, their\r\nbodies are painted.[1201] The same was the case with the Tahitian\r\nAreois—a sort of privileged libertines, leading a most licentious\r\nlife, and practising lewd dances and pantomimes,—who also sometimes,\r\non public occasions, put on a girdle of the yellow “ti” leaves,\r\nwhich, in appearance, resembled the feather girdles of the Peruvians\r\nor other South American tribes.[1202] As to the South African Basutos,\r\nMr. Casalis states that marriageable girls “frequently indulge in\r\ngrotesque dances, and at those times wear, as a sort of petticoat,\r\nlong bands composed of a series of rushes artistically strung\r\ntogether.”[1203]\r\n\r\nVery generally in the savage world, where climate does not put\r\nobstacles in the way, both sexes go naked till they reach manhood,\r\ncovering being resorted to at the same period of life as other\r\nornaments.[1204] A South Australian boy, for instance, when fourteen\r\nor sixteen years old, has to undergo the initiatory rites of manhood\r\nas follows:—he is smeared all over with red ochre and grease, the hair\r\nis plucked from his body, and all his friends gather green gum bushes,\r\nwhich they place under his armpits and over the _os pubis_, after which\r\nthe boy is entitled to marry.[1205]\r\n\r\nIn conformity with other ornaments, what we consider decent covering\r\nis said to be more common with savage men than with women. “If dress\r\nwere the result of a feeling of shame,” Professor Waitz observes, “we\r\nshould expect it to be more indispensable to woman than to man, which\r\nis not the case.”[1206] In America, according to v. Humboldt—among the\r\nCaribs, for instance—the men are often more decently clothed than the\r\nwomen.[1207] The same is stated of the Nagas of Upper Assam;[1208] and\r\nBarth, who had a vast experience of African savages, remarks, “I have\r\nobserved that many heathen tribes consider a covering, however poor and\r\nscanty it may be, more necessary for man than woman.”[1209] Whether\r\nthis is the rule among savage peoples is doubtful. At any rate, the\r\negoism of the men cannot be blamed for the nakedness of the women. For\r\na savage Eve may pluck her clothes from the trees.\r\n\r\nIn support of the psychological presumption which underlies the\r\nhypothesis here adduced, it may be added that some peoples are in the\r\nhabit of covering other parts of the body also, in order to “excite\r\nthrough the unknown.” Thus, among the Tipperahs, the married women\r\nwear nothing but a short petticoat, while the unmarried girls cover\r\nthe breast with a gaily-dyed cloth with fringed ends.[1210] Among the\r\nToungtha, the bosoms of women are left uncovered after the birth of the\r\nfirst child, but the unmarried girls wear a narrow breast cloth.[1211]\r\nThe Chinese consider small feet to be the chief charm of their women,\r\nand the girls have to undergo horrible torture while their feet are\r\nbeing compressed to the smallest possible size. It might be supposed\r\nthat they would at least have the pleasure of fascinating the men by\r\na beauty so painfully acquired. But Dr. Stricker assures us that, in\r\nChina, a woman is considered immodest if she shows her artificially\r\ndistorted foot to a man. It is even improper to speak of a woman’s\r\nfoot, and in decent pictures this part is always concealed under the\r\ndress.[1212] The women of Agades, according to Barth, generally go\r\nunveiled, and if they sometimes cover their heads, this is done rather\r\nfrom coquetry than from a feeling of shame.[1213] Mr. Man remarks\r\nthat a Hindu woman who attempts to hide her face, while she wears a\r\ngauze which displays her whole form, in her simulated modesty always\r\nappears as if attempting to convey an _arrière pensée_.[1214] Among\r\nthe Tacullies, it is customary for the girls to have over their eyes\r\na kind of veil or fringe, made either of strung beads or of narrow\r\nstrips of deer skin garnished with porcupine quills;[1215] and, among\r\nthe Chawanons, according to Moore, those young women who have any\r\npretensions to beauty, as soon as they become marriageable, “muffle\r\nthemselves up so that when they go abroad it is impossible to see\r\nanything but their eyes. On these indications of beauty they are\r\neagerly sought in marriage.”[1216]\r\n\r\nFinally, it is worth noting that this covering, or half covering, is\r\nonly one of the means by which savage men and women endeavor to direct\r\nattention to that which civilized man conceals from a sense of shame.\r\nAmong the Admiralty Islanders, the only covering is a shell, which\r\nshell is often tastefully engraved with the usual zigzag patterns,\r\nwhilst its dazzling whiteness forms a very striking contrast with the\r\nblackness of the skin.[1217] On reaching puberty, the Tankhul Nagas\r\nassume, instead of a shell, a horn or ivory ring from an eighth to\r\na quarter of an inch in breadth; being apparently of opinion that\r\nexposure, if so attended, is not a matter to be ashamed of.[1218] Some\r\nof the Brazilian Tupis, according to Castlenau, “mentulam inserunt in\r\nannulum ligneum, unde appellantur Porrudos, _i.e._ mentulati;”[1219]\r\nand, in several of the South Sea Islands, those parts of the body\r\nwhich civilized people are most anxious to conceal, are decorated with\r\ntattoos.[1220] De indigenis Tanembaris et Timorlaonis dum loquitur\r\nReidel, adulescentes et puellas dicit saepe consulto abradere pilos\r\npubis nulla alia mente, nisi ut illæ partes alteri sexui magis\r\nconspicuæ fiant.[1221]\r\n\r\nAbove all the practice of circumcision should be noticed in this\r\nconnection, since, as I believe, it owes its origin to the same\r\ncause. It is by no means a specifically Jewish custom, but is widely\r\nspread over the earth. It is in use among all the Mohammedan peoples,\r\namong most of the tribes inhabiting the African West Coast, among the\r\nKafirs, among nearly all the peoples of Eastern Africa, among the\r\nChristian Abyssinians, Bogos, and Copts,[1222] throughout all the\r\nvarious tribes inhabiting Madagascar,[1223] and, in the heart of the\r\nBlack Continent, among the Monbuttu and Akka. Moreover, it is practised\r\nvery commonly in Australia, in many islands of Melanesia,[1224] and\r\nin Polynesia universally. It has also been met with in some parts of\r\nAmerica: in Yucatan,[1225] on the Orinoco,[1226] and among certain\r\ntribes in the Rio Branco in Brazil.[1227] The Jews, Mohammedans,[1228]\r\nAbyssinians,[1229] and some other peoples being excepted, it is always\r\nperformed when the boy attains manhood—_i.e._, at the same age as\r\nthat at which he is tattooed or painted, or begins to dress or adorn\r\nhimself. Indeed, through the operation of circumcision, the boy becomes\r\na man, and, where it is wanting, some other operation or deformation\r\nof the body supplies its place.[1230] Thus, in Australia, some tribes\r\npractise circumcision, others knock out teeth, when the youth becomes\r\nvirile.[1231] Where circumcision is in use it is generally considered\r\nan indispensable preliminary to marriage, “uncircumcised” being a\r\nbad word, and the women often refusing all intercourse with such a\r\nman.[1232]\r\n\r\nSeveral different explanations of this custom have been\r\nsuggested.[1233] Some authors believe that it is due to hygienic\r\nmotives. But circumcised and uncircumcised peoples live under the\r\nsame conditions in the same neighbourhood side by side, without any\r\ndifference in their physical condition.[1234] Mr. Sturt remarks that,\r\nin Australia, “you would meet with a tribe with which that custom did\r\nnot prevail, between two with which it did.”[1235] Moreover, as Mr.\r\nSpencer observes, while the usage does not exist among the most cleanly\r\nraces in the world, it is common among the most uncleanly.[1236] Among\r\nthe Damaras and Bechuanas, the boys are circumcised, though these\r\npeoples are described as exceedingly filthy in their habits,[1237] and\r\nso also among the people of Madagascar and the Malays, who are far from\r\nbeing so cleanly as might be desired.[1238]\r\n\r\nAgain, according to Mr. Spencer, circumcision involves an offering to\r\nthe gods. He suggests that in the first instance vanquished enemies\r\nwere mutilated in order that a specially valuable trophy after a battle\r\nmight be presented to the king Then, “in a highly militant society\r\ngoverned by a divinely-descended despot, ... we may expect that the\r\npresentation to the king of these trophies taken from enslaved enemies,\r\nwill develop into the offering to the god of like trophies taken from\r\neach generation of male citizens in acknowledgment of their slavery\r\nto him.”[1239] This conclusion Mr. Spencer draws from the single fact\r\nthat, “among the Abyssinians, the trophy taken by circumcision from\r\nan enemy’s dead body is presented by each warrior to his chief.” But\r\nthere is no evidence whatever that this curious custom is of common\r\noccurrence. Circumcision is spread over a very large part of the\r\nearth, and prevails even in societies which are not “governed by a\r\ndivinely-descended despot,” who could require all his subjects to bear\r\nthis badge of servitude. With regard to the Australian aborigines, many\r\ntribes of whom practise circumcision, Mr. Curr says, “On the subject\r\nof government (by which I mean the habitual exercise of authority, by\r\none or a few individuals, over a community or a body of persons) I have\r\nmade many inquiries and received written replies from the observers\r\nof about a hundred tribes to the effect that none exists. Indeed, no\r\nfact connected with our tribes seems better established.”[1240] Since\r\nthere is nothing to indicate that there ever was a different state\r\nof things in Australia, how are we to reconcile these facts with the\r\ninterpretation offered by Mr. Spencer?\r\n\r\nIn the Book of Genesis the practice of circumcision is presented as\r\na religious rite, deriving its origin from a command of God. But\r\namong most peoples it appears to have little, if any, religious\r\nsignificance.[1241] Sometimes, indeed, it is performed by a priest\r\nof the community, but, as Herr Andree justly remarks, this has no\r\nnecessary relation to the question, the priests generally being the\r\nphysicians of savage tribes.[1242] Moreover, as has already been\r\npointed out, almost every ancestral custom may by degrees take a\r\nreligious character. Thus, the ancient Peruvians’ habit of enlarging\r\nthe lobe of the ear, so as to enable it to carry ear-tubes of great\r\nsize, is supposed to have been connected with sun-worship; for Spanish\r\nhistorians mention that elaborate religious ceremonies were held at\r\nthe Temple of the Sun at Cuzco, on the occasion of the boring of the\r\nears of young Peruvian nobles.[1243] But we should not be warranted in\r\ninferring that this custom had originally anything to do with religion.\r\nWith regard to circumcision among the Jews, I agree with Herr Andree\r\nthat its religious character was almost certainly of a comparatively\r\nlate date.[1244]\r\n\r\nThe peoples among whom this practice prevails are themselves unable\r\nto give any adequate account of its origin. With reference to the\r\ncircumcision of the Southern Africans, the Rev. H. H. Dugmore says\r\nthat they do not know how it began and that they have no traditionary\r\nremembrances about it, except that it has prevailed as a national\r\ncustom from generation to generation. “Our forefathers did so, and\r\ntherefore we do the same,” is all that the present generation can say\r\nabout the matter.[1245]\r\n\r\nThat the practice of circumcision arose from the same desire as that\r\nwhich led to other kinds of mutilation, is rendered more probable\r\nby the fact that disfiguration is sometimes effected in quite a\r\ndifferent way. Novae Zealandiae incolas Cook narrat non solum se\r\nnon circumcidere, sed contra tam necessarium habere praeputium,\r\nut anteriorem eius partem redimire soleant ligamento, quo glandem\r\npenis tegant.[1246] The same curious usage is met with in some other\r\nIslands of the South Sea;[1247] and in Brazil, according to Dr. Karl\r\nvon den Steinen, among the Trumaí.[1248] Indigenae Portus Lincoln\r\npueros pubertatem ingressos mirum in modum secant: quarzi fragmento\r\npenem ex ore secundum inferiorem partem usque ad scrotum incidunt\r\nitaque totum longitudinis spatium detegunt.[1249] In defence of this\r\npractice, says Mr. Schürmann, the natives had nothing to suggest\r\nexcept that “it was observed by their forefathers, and must therefore\r\nbe upheld by themselves.”[1250] In Ponapé, boys are always subjected\r\nto semi-castration, as Dr. Finsch remarks, in order to prevent the\r\npossibility of orchitis, and, further, because the girls consider men\r\nthus disfigured handsomer and more attractive than others. According to\r\nCaptain Wright, the same custom prevails in Niutabutabu, of the Tonga\r\nIslands.[1251]\r\n\r\nAmong many peoples of Africa, and in certain tribes of the Malay\r\nArchipelago and South America, the girls also undergo a sort of\r\ncircumcision, and this is looked upon as an indispensable preliminary\r\nto marriage.[1252] Sunt autem gentes, quarum contrarius mos est,\r\nut clitoris et labia minora non exsecentur, verum extendantur, et\r\nsaepe longissime extendandur. Atque ista etiam deformatio insigne\r\npulchritudinis existimatur.[1253] De indigenis Ponapéis haec adnotat\r\nDr. Finsch; labia interna longius extenta et pendentia puellis et\r\nuxoribus singulare sunt incitamentum, quae res eodem modo se habet apud\r\nalias gentes, ut apud Hottentottas.[1254]\r\n\r\nIt certainly seems strange that such deformities should have been\r\noriginally intended to improve the appearance. But we must remember\r\nthe rough taste of savages, and the wish for variety so deeply rooted\r\nin human nature. These practices evidently began at a time when man\r\nwent in a state of perfect nudity. The mutilations, as the eyes became\r\naccustomed to them, gradually ceased to be interesting, and continued\r\nto be inflicted merely through the force of habit, or from a religious\r\nmotive. A new stimulus was then invented, parts of the body which had\r\nformerly been exposed being hidden by a scanty covering: as the Chinese\r\nwomen at first had their feet pressed in order to excite admiration,\r\nbut afterwards began to conceal them from coquetry, or as the Tassai\r\nbeauties, though entirely naked otherwise, wear two or three petticoats\r\none over another.[1255]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow, then, are we to explain the connection which undoubtedly exists\r\nbetween nakedness and the feeling of shame? The hypothesis here set\r\nforth cannot be regarded as fully established until this question is\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n“The ideas of modesty,” Forster truly says, “are different in every\r\ncountry, and change in different periods of time.”[1256] As v. Humboldt\r\nremarks, “A woman in some parts of Asia is not permitted to show\r\nthe ends of her fingers; while an Indian of the Caribbean race is far\r\nfrom considering herself naked, when she wears a ‘guajuco’ two inches\r\nbroad. Even this band is regarded as a less essential part of dress\r\nthan the pigment which covers the skin. To go out of the hut without\r\nbeing painted with arnotta, is to transgress all the rules of Caribbean\r\ndecency.”[1257] In Tahiti, a person not properly tattooed would “be\r\nas much reproached and shunned, as if with us he should go about the\r\nstreets naked;”[1258] and, in Tonga also, the men would think it very\r\nindecent not to be tattooed.[1259]\r\n\r\nM. Letourneau reports that, at Basra on the Euphrates, it was the duty\r\nof a woman, if surprised when taking her bath, to turn her face; no\r\nfurther concealment was considered necessary.[1260] The same habit\r\nprevailed among the fellah women in Egypt;[1261] while, in Arabia,\r\naccording to Ebers, a woman acts even more indecorously in uncovering\r\nthe back of the head than in uncovering the face, though this also is\r\ncarefully hidden.[1262]\r\n\r\nThe Tubori women in Central Africa wear only a narrow strap, to which\r\nis attached a twig hanging down behind; but they feel greatly ashamed\r\nif the twig happens to fall off.[1263] A Chinese woman, as previously\r\nstated, is not permitted by the law of modesty to show her feet; and\r\nthe Samoans considered it most disgraceful to expose the navel.[1264]\r\nThe savage tribes of Sumatra and Celebes have a like feeling about the\r\nexposure of the knee, which is always carefully covered.[1265] Speaking\r\nof the horrible mouth adornment worn by the women of Port des Français\r\n(Alaska), which makes the lower part of the mouth jut out two or three\r\ninches, La Pérouse remarks, “We sometimes prevailed on them to pull\r\noff this ornament, to which they with difficulty agreed; they then\r\ntestified the same embarrassment, and made the same gestures, as a\r\nwoman in Europe who discovers her bosom.”[1266] Et Polynesios, quamquam\r\neum tenent morem, nullam ut aliam corporis partem nisi glandem penis\r\ntegant, hanc tamen nudare vehementer pudet. Ita Lisiansky animadvertit\r\nindigenas Nukahivae, qui praeputium peni abductum habent et extremam\r\neius partem lino constrictam, linum illud magni aestimare manifesto\r\napparere. “Accidit enim,” inquit, “ut frater regis, ubi navem meam\r\nascendit, linum amitteret, qua occasione mala quam maxime angebatur.\r\nQui cum constratum navis ingrederetur, illa re commotus partem non\r\nredimitam manibus velavit.”[1267] Dr. Mosely asserts that the Admiralty\r\nIslanders, who wear nothing but a shell, always cover themselves\r\nhastily on removing the shell for barter, and evidently consider that\r\nthey are exposing themselves either indecently or irreligiously, if\r\nthey show themselves perfectly nude.[1268] The Kubus of Sumatra have a\r\ntradition that they are descendants of the youngest of three brothers,\r\nthe first and second of whom were circumcised in the usual way, while\r\nit was found that no instruments would circumcise the third. This so\r\n_ashamed_ him that he betook himself to the woods.[1269]\r\n\r\nIdeas of modesty, therefore, are altogether relative and conventional.\r\nPeoples who are accustomed to tattoo themselves are ashamed to appear\r\nuntattooed; peoples whose women are in the habit of covering their\r\nfaces consider such a covering indispensable for every respectable\r\nwoman; peoples who for one reason or another have come to conceal the\r\nnavel, the knee, the bosom, or other parts, blush to reveal what is\r\nhidden. It is not the feeling of shame that has provoked the covering,\r\nbut the covering that has provoked the feeling of shame.\r\n\r\nThis feeling, Dr. Bain remarks, “is resolved by a reference to the\r\ndread of being condemned, or ill-thought of, by others.”[1270] Such\r\ndread is undoubtedly one of the most powerful motives of human\r\naction. Speaking of the Greenlanders, Cranz says that the mainspring\r\nof all that they do is their fear of being blamed or mocked by other\r\nmen.[1271] Among savages, custom is a tyrant as potent as law has\r\never been in civilized societies, every deviation from a usage which\r\nhas taken root among the people being laughed to scorn, or regarded\r\nwith disdain. The young ladies of Balonda, wholly unconscious of\r\ntheir own deficiency, could not maintain their gravity at the sight\r\nof the naked backs of Livingstone’s men. “Much to the annoyance of\r\nmy companions,” he says, “the young girls laughed outright whenever\r\ntheir backs were turned to them, for the Balonda men wear a dress\r\nconsisting of skins of small animals, hanging before and behind from\r\na girdle round the loins.”[1272] By degrees a custom is associated\r\nwith religion, and then becomes even more powerful than before. Mr.\r\nWilliams tells us of a Fijian priest, who, like all his countrymen,\r\nwas satisfied with a “masi,” or scanty hip-cloth, but on hearing a\r\ndescription of the naked inhabitants of New Caledonia and of their\r\nidols, exclaimed, contemptuously, “Not have a ‘masi,’ and yet pretend\r\nto have gods!”[1273] And, as Peschel remarks, “were a pious Mussulman\r\nof Ferghana to be present at our balls, and see the bare shoulders of\r\nour wives and daughters, and the semi-embraces of our round dances,\r\nhe would silently wonder at the long-suffering of Allah, who had\r\nnot long ago poured fire and brimstone on this sinful and shameless\r\ngeneration.”[1274]\r\n\r\nCovering the nakedness has, for the reason already pointed out, become\r\na very common practice among savage peoples; among those of the\r\ntropics, no other sort of clothing is generally in use. Hence, through\r\nthe power of custom, the feeling of shame aroused by the exposure of\r\nthe nakedness. If this is the true explanation, some may be disposed to\r\ninfer that savages who, for the sake of cold, cover almost the entire\r\nbody, will feel ashamed to bare even such parts as may elsewhere be\r\nshown without compunction. But this would be to overlook the essential\r\nfact that the heat of their dwellings, where they spend most of the\r\nwinter, and the warmth of the summer sun, in many cases make it\r\nnecessary for them, as they think, to throw off all their clothes.\r\nWhen this is done, they seem to be devoid of any sense of shame. Thus,\r\nthe Aleuts undress themselves completely in their warm jurts, and\r\nmen and women have for ages been accustomed to bathe together in the\r\nsea; “they do not think of there being any immodesty in it, yet, any\r\nimmorality is exceedingly rare among them.”[1275] The Tacullies, who\r\nusually take off their clothes in summer, though they are well clad\r\nin winter, manifest, according to Harmon, as little sense of shame\r\nin regard to uncovering “as the very brute creation.”[1276] The\r\nEskimo of Etah, who in the winter are enveloped to the face in furs,\r\nnevertheless, according to Kane’s description, completely put aside\r\ntheir garments in their subterranean dwellings;[1277] and the demeanour\r\nof the wife of Hans the Eskimo on board Hayes’s ship, plainly showed\r\nthat she had no idea of decency.[1278]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we know that peoples living in warm climates\r\nwho cover only the nakedness are utterly ashamed to expose it. The\r\nAndamanese, although they wear as little clothing as possible, exhibit\r\na delicacy that amounts to prudishness, the women of the tribes of\r\nSouth Andaman being so modest that they will not remove their small\r\napron of leaves, or put anything in its place, in the presence of any\r\nperson, even of their own sex.[1279] Speaking of the Fijians, Wilkes\r\nasserts that, “though almost naked, these natives have a great idea\r\nof modesty, and consider it extremely indelicate to expose the whole\r\nperson. If either a man or woman should be discovered without the\r\n‘maro,’ or ‘liku,’ they would probably be killed.”[1280] The female\r\nnatives of Nukahiva have only one small covering, but are so tenacious\r\nof it that the most licentious will not consent to take it off.[1281]\r\nAmong those Australian tribes, in which a covering is worn by the\r\nwomen, they will retire out of sight to bathe.[1282] In Lukunor and\r\nRadack, men and women never appear naked together;[1283] and among\r\nthe Pelew Islanders, according to Semper, the women have an unlimited\r\nprivilege of striking, fining, or, if it be done on the spot, killing\r\nany man who makes his way in to their bathing-places.[1284]\r\n\r\nThese facts appear to prove that the feeling of shame, far from being\r\nthe original cause of man’s covering his body, is, on the contrary,\r\na result of this custom; and that the covering, if not used as a\r\nprotection from the climate, owes its origin, at least in a great many\r\ncases, to the desire of men and women to make themselves mutually\r\nattractive.[1285] To some readers it may perhaps seem probable that the\r\ncovering of the nakedness was originally due to the feeling which makes\r\nintimate relations between the sexes, even among savages, a more or\r\nless secret matter. But, whilst this feeling is universal in mankind,\r\nthere are, as we have seen, a great many peoples who attach no idea\r\nof shame to the entire exposure of the body, and these peoples are\r\notherwise not less modest than those who cover themselves. Their number\r\nis, indeed, so great that we cannot regard the absence of shame as a\r\nreversion or perversion; and it may be asserted with perfect confidence\r\nthat the modesty which shows itself in covering is not an instinct in\r\nthe same sense as that in which the aversion to incest, for example,\r\nis an instinct,—an aversion to which sexual bashfulness seems to be\r\nvery closely related. Travellers have observed that, among various\r\nnaked tribes, women exhibit a strong sense of modesty through various\r\nattitudes. But these attitudes may, like concealment by clothing, have\r\nbeen _originally_ due to coquetry. They imply a vivid consciousness of\r\ncertain facts, and the exhibition of this consciousness is far from\r\nbeing a mark of modesty. It may, further, be supposed that decent\r\ncovering was adopted for the protection of parts specially liable to\r\ninjury. This may hold good for some cases; but the general prevalence\r\nof circumcision even among naked tribes shows that savages are not\r\nparticularly anxious about the safety of their persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE LIBERTY OF CHOICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to adduce numerous instances of savage and barbarous\r\ntribes among whom a girl is far from having the entire disposal of\r\nher own hand. Being regarded as an object of property, she is treated\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nAmong many peoples the female children are usually “engaged”\r\nin their earliest youth. Concerning the Eskimo to the north of\r\nChurchill, Franklin states that, “as soon as a girl is born, the\r\nyoung lad who wishes to have her for a wife goes to her father’s\r\ntent and proffers himself. If accepted, a promise is given which is\r\nconsidered binding, and the girl is delivered to her betrothed at\r\nthe proper age.”[1286] Early betrothals are among the established\r\ncustoms of the Chippewyans,[1287] Columbians,[1288] Botocudos,[1289]\r\nPatagonians,[1290] and other American peoples.[1291] Among the African\r\nMarutse, the children “are often affianced at an early age, and the\r\nmarriage is consummated as soon as the girl arrives at maturity.”[1292]\r\nThe Negroes of the Gold Coast, according to Bosman, often arranged for\r\nthe marriage of infants directly after birth;[1293] whilst, among the\r\nBushmans, Bechuanas, and Ashantees, children are engaged when they are\r\nstill in the womb, in the event of their proving to be girls.[1294]\r\n\r\nIn Australia, too, girls are frequently promised in early youth, and\r\nsometimes before they are born.[1295] The same is the case in New\r\nGuinea,[1296] New Zealand,[1297] Tahiti,[1298] and many other islands\r\nof the South Sea, as also among several of the tribes inhabiting\r\nthe Malay Archipelago.[1299] Mariner supposed that, in Tonga, about\r\none-third of the married women had been thus betrothed.[1300] In\r\nBritish India infant-marriage has hitherto been a common custom; and\r\nall peoples of the Turkish stock, according to Professor Vámbéry,\r\nare in the habit of betrothing babies.[1301] So also are the\r\nSamoyedes[1302] and Tuski;[1303] and among the Jews of Western Russia,\r\nparents betroth the children whom they hope to have.[1304]\r\n\r\nAmong some peoples, it is the mother,[1305] brother,[1306] or maternal\r\nuncle,[1307] who has the chief power of giving a girl in marriage. In\r\nTimor-laut, Mr. Forbes says, “nothing can be done of such import as\r\nthe disposal of a daughter without the advice, assistance, and witness\r\nof all the villagers, women and youths being admitted as freely to\r\nspeak as the elder males;”[1308] and in West Australia, according to\r\nMr. Oldfield, the consent of the whole tribe is necessary for a girl’s\r\nmarriage.[1309] Yet such cases are no doubt rare exceptions, and give\r\nus no right to conclude that there ever was a time when children were\r\ngenerally considered the property of the tribe, or of their maternal\r\nkinsfolk.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be a mistake to suppose that, among the lower\r\nraces, women are, as a rule, married without having any voice of their\r\nown in the matter. Their liberty of selection, on the contrary, is\r\nvery considerable, and, however down-trodden, they well know how to\r\nmake their influence felt. Thus, among the Indians of North America,\r\nnumberless instances are given of woman’s liberty to choose her\r\nhusband. Schoolcraft asserts that their marriages are brought about\r\n“sometimes with, and sometimes against, the wishes of the graver and\r\nmore prudent relatives of the parties,” the marital rite consisting\r\nchiefly in the consent of the parties.[1310] Heckewelder quotes\r\ninstances of Indians who committed suicide because they had been\r\ndisappointed in love, the girls on whom they had fixed their choice,\r\nand to whom they were engaged, having changed their minds, and married\r\nother lovers.[1311] Among the Kaniagmuts, Thlinkets, and Nutkas, the\r\nsuitor has to consult the wishes of the young lady.[1312] Among the\r\nChippewas, according to Mr. Keating, the mothers generally settle the\r\npreliminaries to marriage without consulting the children: but the\r\nparties are not considered husband and wife till they have given their\r\nconsent.[1313] The Atkha Aleuts occasionally betrothed their children\r\nto each other, but the marriage was held to be binding only after the\r\nbirth of a child.[1314] Among the Creeks, if a man desires to make a\r\nwoman his wife “conformably to the more ancient and serious custom\r\nof the country,” he endeavours to gain her own consent by regular\r\ncourtship.[1315] Among the Pueblos,[1316] &c.,[1317] “no girl is\r\nforced to marry against her will, however eligible her parents may\r\nconsider the match.”\r\n\r\nAs to the South American Guanas, Azara states, “Aucune femme ne\r\nconsent à se marier, sans avoir fait ses stipulations préliminaires\r\ntrès-détaillées avec son prétendu, et avec son père et ses parents, à\r\nl’égard de leur genre de vie réciproque.”[1318] In Tierra del Fuego,\r\naccording to Lieutenant Bove, the eagerness with which the women seek\r\nfor young husbands is surprising, but even more surprising is the\r\nfact that they nearly always attain their ends.[1319] Speaking of the\r\nsame people, Mr. Bridges says, “It frequently happens that there is\r\ninsuperable aversion on the girl’s part to her husband, and she leaves\r\nhim, and if she persists in hating him she is then given to one she\r\nlikes.”[1320] It is, indeed, common in America for a girl to run away\r\nfrom a bridegroom forced upon her by the parents;[1321] whilst, if they\r\nrefuse to give their daughter to a suitor whom she loves, the couple\r\nelope.[1322] Thus, among the Dacotahs, as we are told by Mr. Prescott,\r\n“there are many matches made by elopement, much to the chagrin of the\r\nparents.”[1323]\r\n\r\nIn Australia it is the rule that a father alone can give away his\r\ndaughter, and, according to Mr. Curr, the woman herself has no voice\r\nin the selection of her husband.[1324] But, with reference to the\r\nNarrinyeri, Mr. Taplin states that, “although the consent of a female\r\nis not considered a matter of the first importance, as, indeed, is\r\nthe case in many uncivilized nations, yet it is always regarded as\r\ndesirable.”[1325] Among the Kurnai, according to Mr. Howitt, she\r\ndecidedly enjoys the freedom of choice. Should the parents refuse their\r\nconsent, she goes away with her lover, and if they can remain away till\r\nthe girl is with child she may, it is said, expect to be forgiven.\r\nOtherwise it may become necessary for them to elope two or three\r\ntimes before they are pardoned, the family at length becoming tired\r\nof objecting.[1326] Mr. Mathew asserts that, with varying details,\r\nmarriage by mutual consent will be found among other tribes also,\r\nthough it is not completed except by means of a run-away match.[1327]\r\nElopement undertaken with the consent of the woman is, indeed, and has\r\nbeen, a recognized institution among at least some of the aboriginal\r\ntribes in Australia. Among the Kurnai it is the rule.[1328]\r\n\r\nThe Maoris have a proverb, “As a kahawai (a fish which is very\r\nparticular in selecting the hook that most resembles its food) selects\r\nthe hook which pleases it best out of a great number, so also a woman\r\nchooses one man out of many.”[1329] Mariner supposed that, in Tonga,\r\nperhaps two-thirds of the girls had married with their own free\r\nconsent.[1330] Concerning the natives of Arorae, Mr. Turner says,\r\n“In choosing a husband the lady sat in the lower room of the house,\r\nand over her head were let down through the chinks of the floor of the\r\nupper room two or three cocoa-nut leaflets, the ends of which were held\r\nby her lovers. She pulled at one, and asked whose it was. If the reply\r\nwas not in the voice of the young man she wished to have, she left it\r\nand pulled at another leaf, and another, until she found him, and then\r\npulled it right down. The happy man whose leaf she pulled down sat\r\nstill, while the others slunk away.”[1331] In the Society Islands, the\r\nwomen of the middle and lower ranks had the power to choose husbands\r\naccording to their own wishes; and that the women of the highest\r\nclasses sometimes asserted the same right appears from the addresses a\r\nchief of Eimeo had to pay to the object of his attachment before she\r\ncould be induced to accept his offer.[1332] In Radack, “marriages\r\ndepend on a free convention,” as seems to be generally the case in\r\nMicronesia.[1333] In the New Britain Group, according to Mr. Romilly,\r\nafter the man has worked for years to pay for his wife, and is finally\r\nin a position to take her to his house, she may refuse to go, and he\r\ncannot claim back from the parents the large sums he has paid them in\r\nyams, cocoa-nuts, and sugar-canes.[1334] With reference to the New\r\nCaledonian girl, M. Moncelon remarks, “Elle est consultée quelquefois,\r\nmais souvent est forcée d’obéir. Alors elle fuit à chaque instant pour\r\nrejoindre l’homme qu’elle préfère.”[1335]\r\n\r\nIn the Indian Archipelago, according to Professor Wilken, most\r\nmarriages are contracted by the mutual consent of the parties.[1336]\r\nAmong the Dyaks, “the unmarried girls are at perfect liberty to choose\r\ntheir mates.”[1337] In some parts of Java, much deference is paid to\r\nthe bride’s inclinations;[1338] and, among the Minahassers of Celebes,\r\ncourtship or love-making “is always strictly an affair of the heart\r\nand not in any way dependent upon the consent or even wish of the\r\nparents.”[1339] Similar statements are made by Riedel with reference\r\nto several of the smaller islands.[1340] Among the Rejangs of Sumatra,\r\nif a young man runs away with a virgin without the consent of her\r\nfather, he does not act contrary to the laws of the country; and, if he\r\nis willing to make the usual payments afterwards, the woman cannot be\r\nreclaimed by her father or other kinsfolk.[1341]\r\n\r\nIn Burma, “the choice of marriageable girls is perfectly free,” and\r\nmarriages are occasionally contracted even in direct opposition to\r\nthe parents.[1342] Among the Shans, mutual consent is required to\r\nconstitute a valid union;[1343] and, regarding the Chittagong Hill\r\ntribes, Captain Lewin says that the women’s “power of selecting\r\ntheir own husband is to the full as free as that enjoyed by our own\r\nEnglish maidens.”[1344] The same is the case with many, perhaps most,\r\nof the uncivilized tribes of India. The young couple often settle\r\nthe affair entirely between themselves, even though marriages are\r\nostensibly arranged by the parents;[1345] or the parents, before\r\nthey give their children in marriage, consult them, and, as a rule,\r\nfollow their likings.[1346] In case of parental objection, elopements\r\nfrequently take place.[1347] Among the Kukis, a girl who runs away\r\nfrom a husband she does not like is not thought to act wrongly in doing\r\nso.[1348] Among the aboriginal tribes of China,[1349] the Ainos,[1350]\r\nKhamchadales,[1351] Jakuts,[1352] Ossetes,[1353] &c.,[1354] the\r\ndaughter’s inclinations are nearly always consulted. And, in Corea,\r\nmutual choice was the ancient custom of the country.[1355]\r\n\r\nTurning to Africa we find that, among the Touaregs, a girl may select\r\nout of her suitors the one whom she herself prefers.[1356] As to\r\nthe West African negroes, Mr. Reade informed Mr. Darwin that “the\r\nwomen, at least among the more intelligent Pagan tribes, have no\r\ndifficulty in getting the husbands whom they may desire, although\r\nit is considered unwomanly to ask a man to marry them.”[1357] The\r\naccuracy of this statement is confirmed by several travellers,[1358]\r\nand it seems to hold good for other parts of Africa. Among the Shulis,\r\naccording to Dr. Felkin, the women have a voice in the selection of\r\ntheir husbands.[1359] The Mádi girls, says Emin Pasha, enjoy great\r\nfreedom, and are able to choose companions to their liking.[1360]\r\nAmong the Marutse, “free women who have not been given away or sold\r\nas slaves are allowed to choose what husbands they please.”[1361] The\r\nyoung Kafirs endeavour generally at first to gain the consent of the\r\ngirls, for it is, as Mr. Leslie remarks, “a mistake to imagine that\r\na girl is sold by her father in the same manner, and with the same\r\nauthority, with which he would dispose of a cow.”[1362] And, among\r\nthe Hottentots[1363] and Bushmans,[1364] when a girl has grown up to\r\nwomanhood without having previously been betrothed, her lover must gain\r\nher approbation, as well as that of the parents.\r\n\r\nIn works by ancient writers we find statements of the same kind. Among\r\nthe Cathæi, according to Strabo, the girls chose their husbands, and\r\nthe young men their wives;[1365] and the same is said by Herodotus\r\nof the women of Lydia.[1366] In Indian and old Scandinavian tales\r\nvirgins are represented as having the power to dispose of themselves\r\nfreely.[1367] Thus it was agreed that Skade should choose for herself a\r\nhusband among the Asas, but she was to make her choice by the feet, the\r\nonly part of their persons she was allowed to see.[1368]\r\n\r\nIn view of such facts it is impossible to agree with M. Letourneau\r\nthat, during a very long period, woman was married without her wishes\r\nbeing at all consulted.[1369] There can be no doubt that, under more\r\nprimitive conditions, she was even more free in that respect than\r\nshe is now among most of the lower races. At present a daughter is\r\nvery commonly an object of trade, and the more exclusively she is\r\nregarded from this point of view, the less, of course, are her own\r\nlikings taken into account. Among the Bedouins of Mount Sinai, who\r\nhave marriage by purpose, no father thinks it necessary to consult his\r\ndaughter before selling her, whereas, among the Arabs of the eastern\r\nplain, the Aenezes, &c., according to Burckhardt, “the father never\r\nreceives the price of the girl, and therefore some regard is paid\r\nto her inclinations.”[1370] But it will be shown that marriage by\r\npurchase forms a comparatively late stage in the history of the family\r\nrelations of mankind, owing its origin to the fact that daughters\r\nare valuable as labourers, and therefore not given away for nothing.\r\nSpeaking of the Gippsland natives, Mr. Fison says, “The assertion\r\nthat women ‘eat and do not hunt’ cannot apply to the lower savages.\r\nOn the contrary, whether among the ruder agricultural tribes or those\r\nwho are dependent on supplies gathered from the ‘forest and the\r\nflood,’ the women are food-providers, who supply to the full as much\r\nas they consume, and render valuable service into the bargain. In\r\ntimes of peace, as a general rule, they are the hardest workers and\r\nthe most useful members of the community.”[1371] Now, the Australians,\r\nalthough a very rude race, have advanced far beyond the original\r\nstate of man. There is no reason to doubt that, among our earliest\r\nhuman ancestors, the possession of a woman was desired only for the\r\ngratification of the man’s passions. It may be said generally that in a\r\nstate of nature every grown-up individual earns his own living. Hence\r\nthere is no slavery, as there is, properly speaking, no labour. A man\r\nin the earliest times had no reason, then, to retain his full-grown\r\ndaughter; she might go away, and marry at her pleasure. That she was\r\nnot necessarily gained by the very first male, we may conclude from\r\nwhat we know about the lower animals. As Mr. Darwin remarks, the female\r\ngenerally, or at least often, exerts some choice. She can in most cases\r\nescape, if wooed by a male who does not please her, and when pursued,\r\nas commonly occurs, by several males, she seems often to have the\r\nopportunity, whilst they are fighting with one another, of going away\r\nwith, or at least of temporarily paring with, some one male.[1372]\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that at a later stage, when family ties grew\r\nstronger, and bride-stealing became a common way of concluding a\r\nmarriage, the consent of the woman in the event of capture would be\r\nquite out of the question. Certainly it must generally have been\r\nso when she fell as a booty into the hands of an enemy. But women\r\nthus captured may in many cases have been able to escape from the\r\nhusbands forced on them, and to return to their own, or some friendly\r\nneighbouring, tribe. Very frequently, however, bride-stealing seems to\r\nhave taken place with the approval of the girl, there being no other\r\nway in which the match could be concluded if her parents were not\r\nwilling to agree to it. It is a common mistake, as Mr. Howitt remarks,\r\nto confound marriage by capture and marriage by elopement. They are\r\nessentially different, the one being effected without, the other\r\nwith, the woman’s consent.[1373] Thus, among the Australians, many,\r\nperhaps most, cases of so-called bride-stealing come under the head of\r\nelopements.[1374]\r\n\r\nSomething remains to be said as to the position of sons among\r\nuncivilized peoples. When young they are everywhere as much dependent\r\non the parents, or at least on the father, as are their sisters. A\r\nboy may be sold, bartered away, or even killed, if his father thinks\r\nproper. That the power of life and death, under certain circumstances,\r\nrests with the tribe is a matter of little importance in this\r\nconnection. But as soon as the young man grows up, the father, as a\r\nrule, has no longer any authority over him, whereas a woman is always\r\nmore or less in a state of dependence, marriage implying for her a\r\nchange of owner only. Among the Australians, says Mr. Curr, “sons\r\nbecome independent when they have gone through the ceremonies by\r\nwhich they attain to the _status_ of manhood.”[1375] The full-grown\r\nman is his own master; he is strong enough not to be kept in check by\r\nhis father, and, being able to shift for himself, he may marry quite\r\nindependently of the old man’s will.\r\n\r\nIt often happens, indeed, as we have seen, that parents betroth their\r\nchildren when they are young.[1376] But, if such an engagement is not\r\nalways binding even for the woman, it is of course all the less so\r\nfor the man. “The choice among the Kalmucks,” Liadov says, “belongs\r\nentirely to the parents. Still, there is no constraint upon this point,\r\nand, if the son declares that the selection of his parents displease\r\nhim, there is no further question about the matter.”[1377]\r\n\r\nMoreover, marriage contracts are concluded among certain peoples by the\r\nparents of the parties, even when these are full-grown.[1378] Among\r\nthe Iroquois, according to Mr. Morgan, the mother, when she considered\r\nher son of a suitable age for marriage, looked about for a maiden whom\r\nshe thought likely to accord with him in disposition and temperament,\r\nand remonstrance or objection on the part of the children was never\r\nattempted.[1379] Among the Basutos, the choice of “the great wife” is\r\ngenerally made by the father.[1380] And, in many of the uncivilized\r\ntribes of India, parents are in the habit of betrothing their\r\nsons.[1381] In certain cases, the parents merely go through a form of\r\nselection, the matter having already been really settled by the parties\r\nconcerned;[1382] and usually a man who has been induced to marry a\r\nwoman he does not like, may divorce her and choose another according\r\nto his taste. Yet, speaking of the Kisáns, Colonel Dalton says that\r\n“there is no instance on record of a youth or maiden objecting to the\r\narrangement made for them.”[1383] The paternal authority among these\r\ntribes of India implies, indeed, a family system of higher type than\r\nwe are accustomed to find among wild races: it approaches the _patria\r\npotestas_ of the ancient Aryan nations. Thus, among the Kandhs, in\r\neach family the absolute authority rests with the house-father; the\r\nsons have no property during the father’s lifetime, and all the male\r\nchildren, with their wives and descendants, continue to share the\r\nfather’s meal, prepared by the common mother.[1384] The father chooses\r\na full-grown woman as a wife for his young son. “In the superior\r\nage of the bride,” says Colonel Macpherson, “is seen a proof of the\r\nsupremacy of the paternal authority amongst this singular people. The\r\nparents obtain the wives of their sons during their boyhood, as very\r\nvaluable domestic servants, and their selections are avowedly made with\r\na view to utility in this character.”[1385]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong savages the father’s power depends exclusively, or chiefly, upon\r\nhis superior strength. At a later stage, in connection with a more\r\nhighly developed system of ancestor-worship, it becomes more ideal,\r\nand, at the same time, more extensive and more absolute. Obedience to\r\nthe father is regarded as a sacred duty, the transgression of which\r\nwill be punished as a crime against the gods. Indeed, so prevalent\r\nhas this strengthened authority of the father been among peoples who\r\nhave reached a relatively high degree of civilization, that it must be\r\nregarded as marking a stage in all human history.\r\n\r\nThe family system of the savage Indians differs widely, in this\r\nrespect, from that which was established among the ancient inhabitants\r\nof Mexico and Peru. Concerning the Mexicans, Clavigero says that\r\n“their children were bred to stand so much in awe of their parents,\r\nthat, even when grown up and married they hardly durst speak before\r\nthem.”[1386] The following was an exhortation of a Mexican to his\r\nson:—“Honour all persons, particularly thy parents, to whom thou\r\nowest obedience, respect, and service. Guard against imitating the\r\nexample of those wicked sons, who, like brutes that are deprived of\r\nreason, neither reverence their parents, listen to their instruction,\r\nnor submit to their correction; because whoever follows their steps\r\nwill have an unhappy end, will die in a desperate or sudden manner, or\r\nwill be killed and devoured by wild beasts.”[1387] A youth was seldom\r\nallowed to choose a wife for himself; he was expected to abide by the\r\nselection of his parents. Hence it rarely happened that a marriage\r\ntook place without the sanction of parents or other kinsfolk, and he\r\nwho presumed to marry without such sanction had to undergo penance,\r\nbeing looked upon as ungrateful, ill-bred, and apostate.[1388] The\r\nbelief was, according to Torquemada, that an act of that kind would\r\nbe punished by some misfortune.[1389] In a province of the Mexican\r\nempire, it was even required that a bridegroom should be carried, that\r\nhe might be supposed to marry against his inclinations.[1390] Touching\r\nthe Guatemalans, Mr. Bancroft says, “It seems incredible that the\r\nyoung men should have quietly submitted to having their wives picked\r\nout for them without being allowed any voice or choice in the matter.\r\nYet we are told that so great was their obedience and submission to\r\ntheir parents that there never was any scandal in these things.”[1391]\r\nIn the greater part of Nicaragua, matches were arranged by the parents;\r\nthough there were certain independent towns in which the girls chose\r\ntheir husbands from among the young men, while the latter sat at a\r\nfeast.[1392] Again, in Peru, Inca Pachacutec confirmed the law that\r\nsons should obey and serve their fathers until they reached the age\r\nof twenty-five, and that none should marry without the consent of\r\nthe parents, and of the parents of the girl, a marriage without this\r\nconsent being invalid and the children illegitimate.[1393]\r\n\r\nSimilar ideas formerly prevailed, and to some extent are still found,\r\namong the civilized nations of the Old World. The Chinese have a maxim\r\nthat, as the Emperor should have a father’s love for his people, so a\r\nfather should have a sovereign’s power over his family.[1394] From\r\nearliest youth the Chinese lad is imbued with such respect for his\r\nparents that it becomes at last a religious sentiment, and forms, as he\r\ngets older, the basis of his only creed—the worship of ancestors.[1395]\r\nDisobedience to parents is looked upon as a sin to be punished with\r\ndeath, whether the offender be an infant or a full-grown son or\r\ndaughter. And in everything referring to the marriage of the children\r\nparents are omnipotent. “From all antiquity in China,” Navarette\r\nsays, “no son ever did, or hereafter will, marry without the consent\r\nof his parents.”[1396] Indeed, according to Mr. Medhurst, it is a\r\nuniversally acknowledged principle in China that no person, of whatever\r\nage, can act for himself in matrimonial matters during the lifetime\r\nor in the neighbourhood of his parents or near senior kinsfolk. The\r\npower of these guardians is so great that they may contract a marriage\r\nfor a junior who is absent from home, and he is bound to abide by\r\nsuch engagement even though already affianced elsewhere without their\r\nprivity or consent.[1397] The consequence of this system is that,\r\nin many cases, the betrothed couple scarcely know each other before\r\nmarriage, the wedding being the first occasion on which the man catches\r\na glimpse of his wife’s face.[1398] In some parts of the Empire\r\nchildren are affianced in infancy.[1399]\r\n\r\nIn Japan, according to Professor Rein, a house-father enjoyed the\r\nsame extensive rights as the Roman _paterfamilias_—an unlimited power\r\nover the person and property of his children.[1400] Filial piety is\r\nconsidered the highest duty of man, and not even death or the marriage\r\nrelation weakens, to any great extent, the hold of a father on a child.\r\n“With affection on the one hand, and cunning on the other,” says Mr.\r\nGriffis, “an unscrupulous father may do what he will.... The Japanese\r\nmaiden, as pure as the purest Christian virgin, will, at the command\r\nof her father, enter the brothel to-morrow, and prostitute herself for\r\nlife. Not a murmur escapes her lips as she thus filially obeys.”[1401]\r\nMarriages are almost invariably arranged by the parents or nearest\r\nkinsfolk of the parties, or by the parties themselves with the aid\r\nof an agent or middleman known as the “nakōdo,” it being considered\r\nhighly improper for them to arrange it on their own account. Among the\r\nlower classes, such direct unions are not unfrequent; but they are held\r\nin contempt, and are known as “yagō,” _i.e._, “meeting on a moor,”—a\r\nterm of disrespect showing the low opinion entertained of them. The\r\nmiddleman’s duty consists in acquainting each of the parties with the\r\nnature, habits, good and bad qualities, and bodily infirmities of the\r\nother, and in doing his utmost to bring the affair to a successful\r\nconclusion. It seldom happens that the parties immediately interested\r\ncommunicate directly with the middleman; if they have parents or\r\nguardians, it is done by these, and, if not, by the nearest relation.\r\nThe middleman has to arrange for a meeting between the parties, which\r\nmeeting is known as the “mi ai,” literally “see meeting” and, if\r\neither party is dissatisfied with the other after this introduction,\r\nthe matter proceeds no further. But, formerly, says Mr. Küchler, “this\r\nante-nuptial meeting was dispensed with in the case of people of very\r\nexalted rank, who consequently never saw each other until the bride\r\nremoved her veil on the marriage day.”[1402]\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient Arabs[1403] and Hebrews, fathers exercised very great\r\nrights over their families. According to the old law of Jahveism, a\r\nfather might sell his child to relieve his own distress, or offer it\r\nto a creditor as a pledge.[1404] Death was the penalty for a child who\r\nstruck a parent, or even cursed one;[1405] though the father himself\r\ncould not inflict this penalty on his children, but had to appeal to\r\nthe whole community.[1406] How important were the duties of the child\r\nto the parents, is shown in the primitive typical relation of Isaac\r\nto Abraham, and may, as Ewald remarks, be at once learned from the\r\nplacing of the law on the subject among the Ten Commandments, and from\r\nits position there in immediate proximity to the commands relating to\r\nthe duties of man towards God.[1407] According to Michaelis, there is\r\nnowhere the slightest trace of its having been the will of Moses that\r\npaternal authority and the subjection of sons should cease after a\r\ncertain age.[1408] A Hebrew father not only disposed of his daughter’s\r\nhand, but chose wives for his sons,—the selection, however, being\r\nsometimes made by the mother.[1409]\r\n\r\nJudging from the marked severity of filial duties among the Egyptians,\r\nsome of which are distinctly alluded to in the inscription of Thebes,\r\nwe may conclude that, in Egypt, much more was expected from a son than\r\nin any European nation of the present day.[1410] And in the ‘Precepts\r\nof Ptah-Hotep,’ which have been called “the most ancient book in\r\nthe world,” we read that the father ought to command, the son to\r\nobey:—“The son who accepts the word of his father will attain old age\r\non that account. God wishes us to obey; disobedience is abhorrent to\r\nHim.”[1411]\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans, the house-father had, in the earlier time, the _jus\r\nvitae necisque_—the power of life and death—over his children. He\r\ncould imprison, sell, or kill his children under an express law of\r\nthe Twelve Tables;[1412] and Plutarch says Brutus condemned his sons\r\nto death, without judicial forms, not as consul, but as father.[1413]\r\n“All in the household,” Mommsen remarks, “were destitute of legal\r\nrights—the wife and the child no less than the bullock or the\r\nslave.”[1414] Even the full-grown son and his children were subject to\r\nthe house-father’s will,[1415] and in marriage without _conventio in\r\nmanum_ a daughter remained in the power of her father or tutor after\r\nmarriage. The consent of the _paterfamilias_ was indispensable to the\r\nmarriage of children, sons and daughters alike;[1416] and so strict\r\nwas this rule originally, that down to the reign of Marcus Aurelius\r\nthe children of a _mente captus_ could not contract a legal marriage\r\nwhile in the power of their father, the latter being incapable of\r\ngiving his consent.[1417] The religious character of this unlimited\r\npaternal authority has been pointed out by M. Fustel de Coulanges. “In\r\nprimitive antiquity,” he says, “the father is not only the strong man,\r\nthe protector who has power to command obedience; he is the priest, he\r\nis heir to the hearth, the continuator of the ancestors, the parent\r\nstock of the descendants, the depositary of the mysterious rites of\r\nworship, and of the sacred formulas of prayer. The whole religion\r\nresides in him.”[1418]\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested by Sir Henry Maine and others that the _patria\r\npotestas_ of the Romans was a survival of the paternal authority\r\nwhich existed among the primitive Aryans.[1419] But no clear evidence\r\nof the general prevalence of such unlimited authority among other\r\nIndo-European peoples has been adduced. Justinian justly observed,\r\n“The power which we have over our children is peculiar to Roman\r\ncitizens; for there are no other men possessing such a power over\r\ntheir children as we have.”[1420] That the father, among the Greeks,\r\nGermans, and Celts, had the power to expose his children when they\r\nwere very young and to sell his marriageable daughters, does not imply\r\nthe possession of a sovereignty like that which the Roman house-father\r\nexercised over his descendants at all ages. As, however, the family\r\ninstitution seems to have had a religious basis among the early\r\nAryans, the father probably had a higher authority than he has among\r\nany existing uncivilized people.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sir Henry Maine, the fulness of the ancient Hindu\r\n_patria potestas_ may be safely inferred from the veneration\r\nwhich even a living father must have inspired under a system of\r\nancestor-worship.[1421] At a later date, the law-book of Manu declares\r\nthat three persons—a wife, a son, and a slave—have in general no wealth\r\nexclusively their own; the wealth which they may earn being regularly\r\nacquired for the man to whom they belong.[1422] A more recent, but\r\nstill ancient authority, Narada, says that a son is “of age and\r\nindependent, in case his parents be dead; during their lifetime he\r\nis dependent, even though he be grown old.”[1423] And, speaking of\r\nthe South of India, Mr. Nelson observes, “It is an undoubted fact\r\nthat, amongst the so-called Hindus of the Madras Province, the father\r\nis looked upon by all at the present day as the Rajah or absolute\r\nSovereign of the family that depends upon him. He is entitled to\r\nreverence during his life, as he is to worship after his death. His\r\nword is law, to be obeyed without question or demur. He is emphatically\r\nthe ‘Master’ of his family, of his wife, of his sons, of his slaves,\r\nand of his wealth.”[1424] But, on the other hand, it appears from\r\nthe ‘Rig-Veda’ that, among the ancient Hindus, the father was the\r\nhead of the family only as long as he was able to be its protector\r\nand maintainer,[1425] decrepit parents being even allowed to die of\r\nstarvation,—a custom which was prevalent among the ancient Teutons\r\nand Eranians.[1426] Moreover, according to the ‘Laws of Manu,’ a\r\ndaughter might choose her husband in accordance with her own wish.\r\nThis permission, however, seems to have been an innovation, as Manu\r\nhimself disapproves of such a “voluntary union of a maiden and her\r\nlover, ... which springs from desire and has sexual intercourse for\r\nits purpose.”[1427] The four marriages—Brâhma, Daiva, Ârsha, and\r\nPrâgâpatya—in which the father gives away his daughter, are blessed\r\nmarriages, and from them spring sons radiant with knowledge of the\r\nVeda, honoured by good men, and destined to live a hundred years. But\r\nthe remaining four marriages—those effected by purchase, voluntary\r\nunion, forcible abduction, or stealth—are blamable marriages, from\r\nwhich spring sons who are cruel and untruthful, who hate the Veda\r\nand the sacred law.[1428] Among the ancient Persians also, marriage\r\ncontracted with the woman’s own consent, but against the will of her\r\nparents, was looked upon as the worst kind of marriage.[1429] In\r\nIndia,[1430] as well as in Persia,[1431] children were often affianced\r\nin earliest youth by their parents.\r\n\r\nAccording to M. Fustel de Coulanges, the unlimited subjection of the\r\nson to the father existed amongst the ancient Greeks, but disappeared\r\nat an early period at Athens, and somewhat later at Sparta.[1432] It\r\nseems very doubtful, however, whether this subjection ever was so\r\nunlimited as among the Romans. The relations of Ulysses and Laertes\r\nin the Odyssey indicate that, at least under certain circumstances, a\r\nfather in the decrepitude of age could be deposed from the headship\r\nof the family. In the mature Greek jurisprudence, as Sir Henry Maine\r\npoints out, the direct authority of the parent is restricted, as in\r\nEuropean codes, to the nonage or minority of the children.[1433] At\r\nAthens, a son was in his father’s power till twenty years of age; then\r\nhe could marry without paternal sanction.[1434] Women, on the other\r\nhand, were in a state of nonage throughout life. A woman could not be\r\na party to any act of importance without the consent of her guardians,\r\nwhose rights, after her marriage, passed to the husband. As a rule, it\r\nwas the lot of a Greek woman to be given in marriage to a man whom\r\nshe did not know.[1435] “Les femmes, à Athènes,” says M. Cauvet, “ne\r\ndevaient jamais choisir elles-mêmes leur époux, toujours il leur était\r\npar le tuteur que la loi leur donnait.”[1436] At Sparta, as well as\r\nat Athens, the betrothal of the bride by her father or guardian was\r\nrequisite as an introduction to marriage.[1437]\r\n\r\nAmong the Teutons, the father certainly had the power to expose or\r\nsell his children under age, but an adult son could put his infirm and\r\naged parents to death.[1438] “Quelle que soit la ressemblance des\r\ndeux institutions,” says M. Laboulaye, “on ne peut pas confondre la\r\npuissance paternelle (_patria potestas_) des Romains et la puissance\r\npaternelle des barbares, le _mundium_.”[1439] Far from being, as in\r\nRome, a power throughout life, the _mundium_ over a son ceased as soon\r\nas he was able to shift for himself.[1440] M. Pardessus asserts that,\r\nat any rate in the fifth and sixth centuries, such paternal authority\r\nas a Roman father exerted did not exist among the Franks;[1441] and an\r\nold commentator states that, “by the law of the Langobardi, children\r\nare not under the ‘power’ of the father.” Nevertheless, the _mundium_\r\namong these people was more severe than among any other of the Teutonic\r\nnations.[1442] The extent of the father’s rights in earlier times,\r\nwhen the Teutons had no written laws, we do not definitely know; but,\r\naccording to Tacitus, a house-father had not unlimited power even over\r\nhis slaves;[1443] so it is impossible to believe in the prevalence of\r\na _patria potestas_ of the Roman type among them. In choosing a wife,\r\nhowever, the men had apparently in early days to take counsel with\r\ntheir kinsfolk.[1444] “The parents and relations of the parties,”\r\nsays Tacitus, “are consulted in cases of marriage, and determine the\r\nnature of the bridal gifts.”[1445] Women always remained in a state of\r\ndependence. Girls, wives, or widows, they were under the guardianship\r\nof the father, husband, or nearest male relative. The father could\r\nfreely dispose of his daughter’s hand, and her own inclinations seem to\r\nhave been very little taken into consideration.[1446]\r\n\r\nAccording to ancient Russian laws, fathers had great power over the\r\nchildren;[1447] but Macieiowski thinks it improbable that a son could\r\nbe sold as a slave.[1448] Baron von Haxthausen, who wrote before the\r\nEmancipation in 1861, says, “The patriarchal government, feelings, and\r\norganization are in full activity in the life, manners, and customs\r\nof the Great Russians. The same unlimited authority which the father\r\nexercises over all his children is possessed by the mother over her\r\ndaughters.... The Russian addresses the same word to his real father,\r\nto the Starosta (a communal authority), to his proprietor, to the\r\nEmperor, and finally to God, _viz._, Father (‘Batushka’).”[1449]\r\nAccording to Sir Mackenzie Wallace, however, the head of the\r\nhousehold was rather the administrator of a labour association than\r\na house-father in the proper sense of the term. The house and nearly\r\neverything it contained were the joint-property of the family, and not\r\neven the head of it could sell or buy anything without the express or\r\ntacit consent of all the other grown-up men.[1450] In Poland, according\r\nto Nestor, a father used to select a bride for his son;[1451] and\r\nin Russia, previous to the Emancipation, it was a common custom for\r\nfathers to marry their young sons to full-grown women. According to\r\nProfessor Bogišić, the power of the father is not so great among the\r\nSouth Slavonians as among the Russians.[1452] But Dr. Krauss asserts\r\nthat a son is not permitted to make a proposal of marriage to a girl\r\nagainst the will of his parents; and, among the Croatians and Servians,\r\nit is quite exceptional for the young man himself to look about for his\r\nfuture wife.[1453] A daughter, of course, enjoys still less freedom of\r\ndisposing of her own hand.[1454]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe paternal authority of the archaic type here considered formed\r\nonly a transitional stage in the history of human institutions. It\r\ndeclined gradually, according as the religious basis on which it rested\r\nbecame more unstable. The introduction of a new religion with higher\r\nconceptions of human rights particularly contributed to its fall.\r\nPaying special attention to its influence on the laws of marriage, I\r\nshall endeavour to trace the main features of this highly important\r\nprocess, which released children from paternal despotism.\r\n\r\nAmong the Hebrews, a modification of the patriarchal principle\r\ntook place as early as the seventh century before the Christian\r\nera;[1455] and, according to the Talmudic law, a marriage, to be\r\nvalid, must be contracted with the voluntary consent of both the\r\nparties concerned.[1456] In Arabia, Mohammed limited the paternal\r\npower.[1457] According to all the Mohammedan schools, a son is at\r\nliberty to contract a marriage without his father’s consent, after he\r\nhas completed his fifteenth year. The Hanafîs and Shiahs grant the same\r\nprivilege to a daughter, whereas, according to other schools, a woman\r\nis emancipated from paternal control only through marriage.[1458] A\r\nMohammedan father certainly has the right to impose the _status_ of\r\nmarriage on his children during their minority, sons and daughters\r\nalike, but the law takes particular care that this right shall never be\r\nexercised to the prejudice of the infant. Any act of the father which\r\nis likely to injure the interest of the minor is considered illegal,\r\nand entitles the judge to interfere in order to prevent the completion\r\nof such act, or, if complete, to annul it.[1459]\r\n\r\nIn the mature Greek jurisprudence the paternal power was more\r\nrestricted than during the Homeric age;[1460] and the Roman _patria\r\npotestas_ gradually became a shadow of what it had been. Under the\r\nRepublic the abuses of paternal authority were checked by the censors,\r\nand in later times the Emperors reduced the father’s power within\r\ncomparatively narrow limits. Alexander Severus ordained that severe\r\npunishments should be inflicted on members of a family only by the\r\nmagistrate. Diocletian and Maximilian took away the power of selling\r\nfreeborn children as slaves; and Constantine declared the father who\r\nkilled his child guilty of murder.[1461] The father’s privilege of\r\ndictating marriage for his sons declined into a conditional veto;[1462]\r\nand it seems as if daughters also, at length, gained a certain amount\r\nof freedom in the choice of a husband. At any rate, a daughter could\r\nprotest, if the father wished to give her in marriage to a man with a\r\nbad reputation.[1463]\r\n\r\n“La philosophie stoïcienne et le christianisme,” says M.\r\nKoenigswarter, “qui hâtèrent le développement des principes d’égalité,\r\nfurent surtout favorables aux fils de famille et aux femmes.”[1464] The\r\ninfluence of Christianity shows itself in Teutonic legislation as well\r\nas in Roman. An edict of Clothaire I. in 560 prohibited the forcing\r\nof women to marry against their will;[1465] although a Council held\r\nat Paris three years earlier expressly required the consent of the\r\nparents also.[1466] According to the laws of Cnut, no woman or girl\r\ncould be forced to marry a man whom she disliked.[1467] The Swedish\r\n‘Westgöta-lag’ permitted a woman to dissolve a marriage which had\r\nbeen contracted without her consent;[1468] and similar privileges were\r\ngranted to her in the ‘Uplands-lag’[1469] and certain other Teutonic\r\nlaw-books.[1470] Later on, the ‘Schwabenspiegel’—a faithful echo of\r\ncanonical ideas—says, “When a young man has completed his fourteenth\r\nyear, he can take a wife without the consent of his father.... At\r\ntwelve years, a maiden is marriageable; and the marriage subsists, even\r\nif contracted in spite of her father, or other relatives.”[1471] A\r\nsimilar privilege, during the Middle Ages, was granted to German women\r\nin general.[1472] But the feelings of the people seemed to have been\r\nopposed to it, and required the consent of the parents. Thus Ulrich von\r\nLichtenstein says in his ‘Frauenbuch,’ “A girl who has no parents\r\nshould follow the advice of her kinsfolk; if she gives herself to a man\r\nof her own accord, she may live with shame.”[1473]\r\n\r\nPaternal authority has declined more rapidly in some countries than\r\nin others. The process has been especially slow in France. In the\r\nliterature of the eleventh century, says M. Bernard, the paternal\r\ncharacter is “everywhere honoured, and filial piety everywhere\r\npraised and rewarded. In the romances of chivalry fathers are never\r\nridiculous; nor sons insolent and mocking.... Above the majesty of\r\nthe feudal baron, that of the paternal power was held still more\r\nsacred and inviolable. However powerful the son might be, he would\r\nnot have dared to outrage his father, whose authority was in his eyes\r\nalways confounded with the sovereignty of command.”[1474] This respect\r\nexercised a tyrannical dominion for centuries. Du Vair remarks, “Nous\r\ndevons tenir nos pères comme des dieux en terre.”[1475] Bodin wrote,\r\nin the later part of the sixteenth century, that, though the monarch\r\ncommands his subjects, the master his disciples, the captain his\r\nsoldiers, there is none to whom nature has given any command except the\r\nfather, “who is the true image of the great sovereign God, universal\r\nfather of all things.”[1476] In the Duke of Sully’s ‘Memoirs’ we read\r\nthat, in his days in France, children were not permitted to sit in\r\nthe presence of their parents without being commanded to do so.[1477]\r\nAccording to the edicts of Henry III. (1566), Louis XIII. (1639), and\r\nLouis XIV. (1697), sons could not marry before the age of thirty, nor\r\ndaughters before that of twenty-five, without the consent of the father\r\nand mother, on pain of being disinherited.[1478] Speaking of the women\r\namong the nobility and upper classes in France during the eighteenth\r\ncentury, Messrs. de Goncourt remark, “Généralement le mariage de la\r\njeune fille se faisait presque immédiatement au sortir du couvent, avec\r\nun mari accepté et agréé par la famille. Car le mariage était avant\r\ntout une affaire de famille, un arrangement au gré des parents, qui\r\ndécidaient des considérations de position et d’argent, des convenances\r\nde rang et de fortune. Le choix était fait d’avance pour la jeune\r\npersonne, qui n’était pas consultée.”[1479]\r\n\r\nEven now French law accords considerable power to parents. A child\r\ncannot quit the paternal residence without the permission of the father\r\nbefore the age of twenty-one except for enrolment in the army.[1480]\r\nFor grave misconduct by his children the father has strong means\r\nof correction.[1481] A son under twenty-five and a daughter under\r\ntwenty-one cannot marry without the consent of their parents;[1482]\r\nand, even when a man has attained his twenty-fifth year, and the woman\r\nher twenty-first, both are still bound to ask for it, by a formal\r\nnotification.[1483] Parental restraints upon marriage exist to a very\r\ngreat extent in Germany and Holland also, the marriage of minors being\r\nabsolutely void, if effected without the consent of the father, or of\r\nthe mother if she be the survivor. According to American, Scotch, and\r\nIrish law, on the other hand, the consent of parents and guardians to\r\nthe marriage of minors is not requisite to the validity of the union.\r\nThe same was the case in England prior to the statute of 26 Geo. II.\r\nc. 33, which declared all marriages by license, when either of the\r\nparties was under the age of twenty-one years, if celebrated without\r\npublication of banns, or without the consent of the father or unmarried\r\nmother, or guardian to be absolutely null and void.[1484]\r\n\r\nThere is thus a certain resemblance between the family institution of\r\nsavage tribes and that of the most advanced races. Among both, the\r\ngrown-up son, and frequently the grown-up daughter, enjoys a liberty\r\nunknown among peoples at an intermediate stage of civilization. There\r\nare, however, these vital differences:—that children in civilized\r\ncountries are in no respect the property of their parents; that they\r\nare born with certain rights guaranteed to them by society; that the\r\nbirth of children gives parents no rights over them other than those\r\nwhich conduce to the children’s happiness. These ideas, essential as\r\nthey are to true civilization, are not many centuries old. It is a\r\npurely modern conception the French Encyclopedist expresses when he\r\nsays, “Le pouvoir paternel est plutôt un devoir qu’un pouvoir.”[1485]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nSEXUAL SELECTION AMONG ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expression, “Sexual Selection,” was first used by Mr. Darwin.\r\nBesides natural selection, which depends on the success of both\r\nsexes, at all ages, in relation to the general conditions of life,\r\nhe introduced another principle, sexual selection, which depends on\r\nthe success of certain individuals over others of the same sex, in\r\nrelation to the propagation of the species. According to the former\r\nprinciple, those individuals who are most successful in the struggle\r\nfor existence survive the others, and characters useful to the species\r\nare thus inherited; according to the latter, those individuals who have\r\nthe greatest success in the struggle for mates have the most numerous\r\noffspring, and the characters which gave them the preference pass on to\r\nthe new generation, and are afterwards intensified by the operation of\r\nlike causes. The sexual struggle is of two kinds. In both it is carried\r\non by individuals of the same sex; but in one these individuals,\r\ngenerally the males, try to drive away or kill their rivals; in\r\nthe other, they seek to excite or charm those of the opposite sex,\r\ngenerally the females, who select the most attractive males for their\r\npartners. Therefore, the characters acquired through sexual selection,\r\nand transmitted chiefly to offspring of the same sex, generally the\r\nmales, are, on the one hand, weapons for battle, vigour and courage; on\r\nthe other hand, certain colours, forms, ornaments, sounds, or odours,\r\nwhich are felt to be pleasant. The secondary sexual characters of the\r\nlatter sort are thus due to the taste of the females. They have been\r\nacquired because they are beautiful or otherwise agreeable, whereas the\r\ncharacters resulting from natural selection have been acquired because\r\nthey are useful. How are we to explain the origin of this wonderful\r\næsthetic faculty? “The senses of man and of the lower animals,”\r\nsays Mr. Darwin, “seem to be so constituted that brilliant colours\r\nand certain forms, as well as harmonious and rhythmical sounds, give\r\npleasure and are called beautiful; but why this should be so we know\r\nnot.”[1486] According to Mr. Darwin, natural and sexual selection are\r\ntwo different sources from which animal characters have arisen. There\r\nis some truth in the statement of one of his critics, “Mr. Darwin,\r\nin fact, has so far abandoned his former belief in the efficacy\r\nof ‘natural selection’ as an agent in producing the differences\r\nwhich separate different species of animals, as to admit that some\r\nsupplementary cause must, in some cases at any rate, be looked for; and\r\nthis he thinks is to be found in the action, through long periods, of\r\n‘sexual selection.’”[1487]\r\n\r\nFar from co-operating with the process of natural selection, sexual\r\nselection, as described by Mr. Darwin, produces effects disadvantageous\r\nto the species. “It is evident,” he says, “that the brilliant\r\ncolours, top-knots, fine plumes, &c., of many male birds cannot\r\nhave been acquired as a protection; indeed, they sometimes lead to\r\ndanger.”[1488] When we consider what an important part is played by\r\ncolours, as means of protection, in the whole animal kingdom, it is\r\ncertainly surprising that many male animals display brilliant hues,\r\nwhich cannot fail to make them conspicuous to their enemies. The strong\r\nodours emitted by certain reptiles and mammals, during the pairing\r\nseason, and the sounds produced by various species at the same period,\r\nhave also the effect of attracting hostile animals that are searching\r\nfor food. And the danger arising for the species from these secondary\r\nsexual characters is all the greater because they generally appear\r\nat the time when offspring is about to be produced. Thus, besides\r\ncolours, structures, and functions, adapted in the most marvellous way\r\nto the requirements of each species, there are others highly dangerous,\r\nwhich, according to Mr. Darwin, depend upon an æsthetic sense, the\r\norigin of which we do not know, and which is absolutely useless.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin, in his many works, has shown how immense is the influence\r\nexercised by natural selection on the organic world. A disciple,\r\ntherefore, naturally feels perplexed when he is told of a series of\r\nfacts, which, according to the explanation given by the master, are\r\nopposed to natural selection. When the contradiction between the\r\ntheories of natural and sexual selection is distinctly realized, the\r\nquestion arises:—Can we be sure that the secondary sexual characters\r\nare so useless as Mr. Darwin suggests? May not they also be explained\r\nby the principle of the survival of the fittest? The larger size and\r\ngreater strength of the males, and the weapons of offence or defence\r\nmany of them possess, may easily be so accounted for, as, among the\r\nhigher animals, the males generally fight with each other for the\r\npossession of the females. The point is whether the other secondary\r\nsexual characters can be due to the same cause.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is an established fact that the colours of flowers serve a definite\r\nend. Through them the flowers are recognized by insects in search\r\nof honey; and the insects, during their visits, involuntarily carry\r\nthe pollen of one flower to the stigma of another, and thus effect\r\ncross-fertilization, which is proved to be of great importance for\r\nthe vigour and fertility of the next generation of plants. Now it\r\nis extremely interesting to note that brilliant colours are found\r\nonly in species of flowers to which they are useful as means of\r\nattracting insects; they never occur in plants which are fertilized\r\nby the wind.[1489] Mr. Wallace observes that plants rarely need to be\r\nconcealed, because they obtain protection by their spines, or their\r\nhardness, or their hairy covering, or their poisonous secretions.\r\nHence there are very few cases of what seems to be true protective\r\ncolouring among them.[1490] In animals, on the contrary, colour is\r\ngreatly influenced by their need of protection from, or warning to,\r\ntheir numerous enemies; colours of other kinds must always, to a\r\ncertain extent, be dangerous for the species. Is it probable, then,\r\nthat, whilst gay colours occur only in the flowers of those plants to\r\nwhich they are of real use, conspicuous colours should occur in animals\r\nto which they are of real danger—merely because the females find them\r\nbeautiful?\r\n\r\nMr. Wallace, whose well-known criticism of Mr. Darwin’s theory of\r\nsexual selection[1491] seems, in many points, to be conclusive,\r\nsuggests that the very frequent superiority of the male bird or insect\r\nin brightness or intensity of colour is due to the greater vigour\r\nand activity and the higher vitality of the male. This intensity of\r\ncoloration is therefore most manifest in the male during the breeding\r\nseason, when the vitality is at a maximum. It would be further\r\ndeveloped by the combats of the males for the possession of the\r\nfemales; and the most vigorous and energetic usually leaving the most\r\nnumerous and most healthy offspring, natural selection would indirectly\r\nbecome a preserver and intensifier of colour.[1492] Mr. Wallace has\r\nmade it very probable that there is some connection between vigour and\r\ncolour, but another question is whether this connection, depending\r\non some unknown physiological law, is so necessary that it takes\r\nplace even when colour is positively disadvantageous to the species.\r\nNothing of the kind is found in the vegetable kingdom. We know, as Mr.\r\nWallace himself remarks, that colours which rarely or never appear in\r\nthe species in a state of nature, continually occur among cultivated\r\nplants and domesticated animals—a fact which shows that the capacity\r\nto develop colour is ever present.[1493] Among wild plants such colour\r\nvariations are never preserved except when they are useful. Is it not\r\nmost reasonable to suppose that the like is the case with animals?\r\n\r\nThe truth seems to be that colour subserves the same purpose in both of\r\nthe great kingdoms of the organic world. Just as flowers are coloured\r\nthat insects may recognize where honey is to be found, and thus may\r\nbe led to promote fertilization, so the sexual colours of animals\r\nhave been developed to make it easier for the sexes to find each other\r\nduring the pairing time. Protective colours are useful so far as they\r\nconceal the animal from its enemies, but, at the same time, they\r\nconceal it from individuals of its own species. Sexual colours are\r\ntherefore useful as well, because they make the animal more visible.\r\nIt is quite in accordance with the theory of natural selection that,\r\nwhere such colours occur, the advantage from them should be greater\r\nthan the disadvantage. We can see the reason for the brilliant colours\r\nof humming-birds, as these birds, on account of their great activity\r\n“are practically unmolested,”[1494] and for the bright hues of the\r\nrose chafers, who are saved from attack by a combination of protecting\r\ncharacters.[1495] But generally there is danger in sexual colours,\r\nso that nature has given them with the utmost cautiousness. Usually\r\nthey occur in males only, because of the females’ greater need of\r\nprotection.[1496] They are not developed till the age of reproduction,\r\nand they appear, in a great many species, only during the pairing\r\nseason. The greatest advantage is won with the least possible peril.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact of great importance that sexual colours occur exactly\r\nin those species whose habits make these colours most visible. Thus\r\nthe nocturnal moths, taken as a body, are much less gaily decorated\r\nthan butterflies, all of which are diurnal in their habits, although,\r\naccording to Mr. Wallace, the general influence of solar light and heat\r\nis no adequate cause for the variety, intensity, and complexity of the\r\ncolours. The females of the ghost moth are yellow with darker markings,\r\nwhereas the males are white, that they may be more easily seen by the\r\nfemales whilst flying about in the dusk; and it is remarkable that,\r\nin the Shetland Islands, the male of this moth, instead of differing\r\nwidely from the female, frequently resembles her closely in colour,—as\r\nMr. Fraser suggests,[1497] because, at the season of the year when\r\nthe ghost moth appears in these northern latitudes, the whiteness of\r\nthe males is not needed to render them visible to the females in the\r\ntwilight night. Both Mr. Darwin[1498] and Mr. Wallace[1499] think that,\r\nin this case, colour may be a means of recognition. Sexual colours\r\noccur chiefly in species which, because of their manner of living, are\r\nto be seen at a distance; they seldom occur in sedentary or slowly\r\nmoving terrestrial animals.[1500] The members of the lowly organized\r\norder Thysanura are wingless and dull-coloured. The Hemiptera, which\r\nusually lurk about plants, and prey upon hapless insects, are not,\r\nas a rule, remarkable for conspicuous hues. The Orthoptera are all\r\nterrestrial in their habits, generally feeding upon plants, and,\r\nalthough some exotic locusts are beautifully ornamented, their bright\r\ntints, according to Mr. Darwin, do not seem to fall under the head of\r\nsexual coloration. On the other hand, the dragon-flies, which live\r\nin the open air, possess splendid green, blue, yellow, and vermilion\r\nmetallic tints, and the sexes often differ in their coloration. Every\r\none has admired the extreme beauty of many butterflies, especially\r\nof the males. Amongst the Fishes, living in a medium through which\r\nbright colours may be observed at a distance, we often find, besides\r\nprotective colours, conspicuous hues which are especially intense\r\nand visible during the pairing time. Among the Reptiles, the little\r\nlizards of the genus Draco especially deserve attention; they glide\r\nthrough the air on their rib-supported parachutes, and the beauty of\r\ntheir colours baffles description. Mammals, on the other hand, do not\r\ngenerally present the splendid tints so common among male birds; and\r\nthe brighter colours of certain arboreal mammals serve chiefly as means\r\nof concealment.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena seem to show that sexual colours have been evolved for\r\nthe purpose of _being seen_. They can scarcely be due merely to the\r\nfact that coloration is connected with the degree of vitality, since\r\nthe Mammals, for instance, are certainly not less vigorous than any\r\nof the other Vertebrate orders. It may perhaps be suggested that,\r\nas flying animals more easily escape their enemies than terrestrial,\r\nthey may with less danger be decorated with conspicuous hues. But here\r\nwe have to observe the most important fact, that animals which do\r\nnot possess sexual colours generally have some other means of making\r\nthemselves discoverable.\r\n\r\nFlowers which need the help of insects for fertilization attract them,\r\nin some cases, not by bright colours, but by peculiar odours. And as\r\nwe do not find conspicuous colours in plants fertilized by the wind,\r\nso flowers have no perfume except where it is of real use. The most\r\nbrilliant flowers, as a rule, are those which possess least odour,\r\nwhilst many of them have no scent at all. White or very pale flowers\r\nare generally the most odoriferous. M. Mongredien gives a list of about\r\n160 species of hardy trees and shrubs with showy flowers, and another\r\nlist of sixty species with fragrant flowers; but only twenty of the\r\nlatter are included among the showy species, and these are almost all\r\nwhite-flowered.[1501] Most of the white flowers are scented only at\r\nnight, or their perfumes are most powerfully emitted at that time; the\r\nreason being that white flowers are fertilized chiefly by night-flying\r\ninsects. We arrive thus at two conclusions: first, that powerful odours\r\nand conspicuous colours as guides to insect fertilizers are, as a rule,\r\ncomplementary to each other; secondly, that they occur alternately in\r\nthe way most useful to the species.\r\n\r\nIn the animal kingdom various odours and sounds are closely connected\r\nwith the reproduction of the species. During the season of love a\r\nmusky odour is emitted by the submaxillary glands of the crocodile,\r\nand pervades its haunts. At the same period the anal scent-glands of\r\nsnakes are in active function, and so are the corresponding glands of\r\nthe lizards. Many mammals are odoriferous. In some cases the odour\r\nappears to serve as a defence or a protection, but in other species the\r\nglands are confined to the males, and almost always become more active\r\nduring the rutting season. Again, a great many insects have the power\r\nof producing stridulous sounds. In two families of the Homoptera and in\r\nthree of the Orthoptera, the males alone possess organs of sound in\r\nan efficient state, and these are used incessantly during the pairing\r\nseason. Some male fishes have sound-producing instruments, and the\r\nfishermen of Rochelle assert that the males alone make the noise during\r\nthe spawning-time. Of frogs and toads the males emit various sounds\r\nat the pairing time, as in the case of the croaking of our common\r\nfrog. During the rutting season, and at no other time, the male of\r\nthe huge tortoise of the Galapagos Islands utters a hoarse bellowing\r\nnoise, which can be heard at a distance of more than a hundred yards.\r\nProfessor Aughey states that on two occasions, being himself unseen,\r\nhe watched from a little distance a rattle-snake coiled up with head\r\nerect, which continued to rattle at short intervals for half an hour;\r\nat last he saw another snake approach, and when they met they paired.\r\nAmong Birds the power of song, or of giving forth strange cries, or\r\neven instrumental music, is exceedingly common, particularly in the\r\nmales during the pairing season; and almost all male mammals use their\r\nvoices much more during that period than at any other time. Some, as\r\nthe giraffe and porcupine, are stated to be completely mute except\r\nduring the rutting season.\r\n\r\nThe colours, odours, and sounds of animals, like the colours and odours\r\nof plants—so far as they may be assumed to be in some way connected\r\nwith the reproductive functions—are, as a rule, complementary to each\r\nother. Stridulating insects are generally not conspicuously coloured.\r\nAmong the Homoptera, there do not seem to be any well-marked cases\r\nof ornamental differences between the sexes. Among crickets, the\r\nLocustidæ, and grasshoppers, some species are beautifully coloured;\r\nbut Mr. Darwin says, “It is not probable that they owe their bright\r\ntints to sexual selection. Conspicuous colours may be of use to these\r\ninsects by giving notice that they are unpalatable.” Other species have\r\ndirectly protective colours. The bright hues of stridulating beetles\r\nseem to be of use chiefly for protective and warning purposes; whereas\r\nspecies belonging to the orders Neuroptera and Lepidoptera, often\r\nextremely conspicuously coloured, are not remarkable for any stridulous\r\nsounds. Frogs and toads, which have an interesting sexual character\r\nin the musical powers possessed by the males, are evidently coloured\r\naccording to the principle of protection, or sometimes tinted with\r\nconspicuous hues in order to be more easily recognized by their enemies\r\nas a nauseous food. Of Reptiles, the Lacertilia excel mainly in bright\r\ntints; the Chelonia, Crocodilia, and Ophidia, in sounds and odours.\r\nAmong Birds, in one instance at least, the male is remarkable for his\r\nscent. “During the pairing and breeding season,” says Mr. Gould, with\r\nreference to the Australian musk-duck, “ ... this bird emits a strong\r\nmusky odour;” it is not ornamented with any conspicuous hues.[1502]\r\nSexual colours and the power of song are generally complementary to\r\neach other among Birds. “As a general rule,” Mr. Wood remarks, “it\r\nis found that the most brilliant songsters among the birds are attired\r\nin the plainest garb; and it may safely be predicted of any peculiarly\r\ngorgeous bird, that power, quality and sweetness of voice are in\r\ninverse ratio to its beauty of plumage.”[1503] Thus, of the British\r\nbirds, with the exception of the bullfinch and goldfinch, the best\r\nsongsters are plain-coloured, and the brilliant birds of the tropics\r\nare hardly ever songsters. The wild camel in the desert of Kum-tagh has\r\na reddish, sandy hue, and the males, “even during the rutting season,\r\nutter no sound, but find their consorts by scent.”[1504] The musk-deer,\r\nwell known for the intolerable perfume which the males emit at the\r\npairing time, is also entirely silent.[1505]\r\n\r\nMoreover, as appears from what has just been said, the sexual colours,\r\nthe perceptible scents and sounds of animals are complementary to\r\neach other in the way that is best suited to make the animals easily\r\ndiscoverable. As bright colours would be of no advantage to flowers\r\nfertilized by night-flying insects, so they would be of comparatively\r\nlittle advantage to animals living among grass and plants, in woods\r\nand bushes; whereas sounds and scents make the animal recognizable at\r\na considerable distance. We have also seen that it is among flying and\r\naquatic animals that sexual colours chiefly occur, whereas terrestrial\r\nanimals excel in sound and scents. Thus most of the stridulating\r\ninsects are terrestrial. Whilst brightly-coloured lizards, living on\r\ntrees or running from stone to stone, must attract attention by the\r\nbrilliance of their covering, crocodiles inhabiting rivers and jungles,\r\nand frogs crawling among the grass, allure their mates, the former by\r\nemitting musky odours, the latter by producing loud sounds. The odour\r\nof the Australian musk-duck, which depends for its food and for its\r\npreservation from danger upon its powers of diving rather than upon\r\nthose of flying, is, as Mr. Gould observes, often perceptible long\r\nbefore the animal can be seen.[1506]\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin remarks, as regards birds, “Bright colours and the power of\r\nsong seem to replace each other. We can perceive that, if the plumage\r\ndid not vary in brightness, or if bright colours were dangerous to\r\nthe species, other means would be employed to charm the females; and\r\nmelody of voice offers one such means.”[1507] But if we accept Mr.\r\nDarwin’s theory of sexual selection, we are compelled to suppose that\r\nthat inexplicable æsthetic sense of the females has been developed in\r\nthe way most dangerous to the species. Conspicuous colours are admired\r\nby the females of those animals which, by means of such colours, are\r\nmost easily discovered by their enemies, and sounds and odours are\r\nappreciated exactly in those species to which they are most perilous.\r\nIf, on the contrary, we accept the explanation that, although sexual\r\ncolours, odours, and sounds are in some ways hurtful to the species,\r\nthey are upon the whole advantageous, inasmuch as they make it easier\r\nfor the sexes to find each other, we have a theory in accordance\r\nwith all known facts, as well as with the great principle of natural\r\nselection. It may be objected that it is not the females but the\r\nmales that are the seekers, whilst the secondary sexual characters\r\ngenerally occur in the males only. But we have no reason to think\r\nthat the females are entirely passive during the pairing season; and\r\nseveral of the statements collected by Mr. Darwin directly indicate\r\nthat females are attracted by the sounds of their future partners. If\r\nBurdach is correct in saying that the male sex generally possesses\r\nmore acute senses than the female,[1508] it is obvious that secondary\r\nsexual characters would be of less use to females than to males, as it\r\ncertainly would be of greater danger.\r\n\r\nIn his work on ‘Darwinism,’ Mr. Wallace expresses the opinion that\r\nthe various sounds and odours which are peculiar to the male serve\r\nas a call to the female, or as an indication of his presence; and,\r\nas he says, “the production, intensification, and differentiation\r\nof these sounds and odours are clearly within the power of natural\r\nselection.”[1509] Mr. Wallace has also shown the immense importance of\r\ncolour as a means of recognition. The theory here set forth thus, in\r\nfact, very nearly approaches his views. The only difference is that\r\nthe sexual colours have been classified under the head of “colour\r\nfor recognition,” though the positive cause by which they have been\r\nproduced may be a surplus of vital energy.\r\n\r\nWe have still to consider certain secondary sexual characters which,\r\naccording to Mr. Darwin, must be regarded as ornaments. With these he\r\nclasses the great horns which rise from the head, thorax, and clypeus\r\nof many male beetles; the appendages with which some male fishes and\r\nreptiles are provided; the combs, plumes, crests, and protuberances\r\nof many male birds; and various crests, tufts, and mantles of hair\r\nwhich are found in certain mammals. But some of these characters may\r\nbe of use to the males in their fights for females, or serve as means\r\nof recognition. Mr. Wallace suggests that crests and other erectile\r\nfeathers may have been useful in making the bird more formidable in\r\nappearance, and in thus frightening away enemies; while long tail or\r\nwing feathers might serve to distract the aim of a bird of prey.[1510]\r\nMoreover, characters of which we cannot yet perceive the use may in\r\nthe future be brought under the law of utility, as has been the case\r\nin so many other instances. According to Mr. Wallace, the ornamental\r\nappendages of birds and other animals are due to a surplus of vital\r\nenergy, leading to abnormal growths in those parts of the integument\r\nwhere muscular and nervous action are greatest.[1511] And where these\r\n“ornaments” are of no positive disadvantage to the species, certainly\r\nno other explanation is needed.\r\n\r\nFor other arguments which may be advanced against Mr. Darwin’s\r\ntheory of sexual selection, reference may be made to Mr. Wallace’s\r\ncriticisms in ‘Tropical Nature’ and ‘Darwinism.’ We have sufficient\r\nevidence that females are pleased or excited by the males’ display of\r\ntheir sexual colours,[1512] and are charmed by their songs. But Mr.\r\nDarwin’s theory presupposes, amongst many other things, that almost\r\nall the females of a species, over a wide area and for many successive\r\ngenerations, prefer exactly the same modification of the colour, or\r\nornament or sounds.[1513] Moreover, if the secondary sexual characters\r\nare due to female choice, how shall we explain the strange fact that\r\nthe taste of the females varies so much that there are scarcely two\r\nspecies in which the standard of perfection is exactly the same? This\r\ndifficulty did not escape Mr. Darwin. “It is a curious fact,” he says,\r\n“that in the same class of animals sounds so different as the drumming\r\nof the snipe’s tail, the tapping of the woodpecker’s beak, the harsh\r\ntrumpet-like cry of certain waterfowl, the cooing of the turtle-dove,\r\nand the song of the nightingale, should all be pleasing to the females\r\nof the several species.” And further, “What shall we say about the\r\nharsh screams of, for instance, some kinds of macaws; have these birds\r\nas bad taste for musical sounds as they apparently have for colour,\r\njudging by the inharmonious contrast of their bright yellow and blue\r\nplumage?”[1514]\r\n\r\nThe theory now suggested accounts fully for this difference in taste.\r\nThe immense variability of the secondary sexual characters is\r\nprecisely what might be expected, if their object is to make it easier\r\nfor the sexes to find and recognize each other. And it is natural that\r\nthe females should be pleased by colours, odours, or sounds which, by\r\nthe association of ideas, are to them the symbols of the most exciting\r\nperiod of their lives. On the other hand, we know that differently\r\ncoloured races of the same species may be disinclined to pair\r\ntogether.[1515] And here, I think, we may draw an important conclusion.\r\nThe great stability of the secondary sexual characters which we find in\r\nwild species, but certainly not in animals under domestication, seems\r\nto be due chiefly to the fact that those males which most typically\r\nrepresent the peculiarities of their species have the best chance of\r\nfinding mates.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe reader may have felt some surprise at this strange jump from the\r\n_patria potestas_ to a discussion of merely zoological facts, which\r\nhave nothing to do, directly, with the history of human marriage. But\r\nwe have now to deal with the sexual selection of man, and, for the\r\nright understanding of this, it was necessary to show that the sexual\r\nselection of the lower animals is entirely subordinate to the great law\r\nof natural selection. Mr. Darwin discussed the origin of the secondary\r\nsexual characters as a preliminary to the statement of his theory\r\nregarding the origin of man, and of the different races of men. At the\r\nend of the next chapter we shall consider whether this theory appears\r\nto be in accordance with facts or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE SEXUAL SELECTION OF MAN: TYPICAL BEAUTY\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the “Sexual Selection of Man” is meant the choice made by men\r\nand women as regards relations with the opposite sex. Mr. Darwin has\r\nshown that such selection takes place among the lower Vertebrata, and,\r\njudging from what we know of domesticated animals, it is much more\r\ncommon in the case of females than in that of males. The male, indeed,\r\nas a rule, seems to be ready to pair with any female, provided she\r\nbelongs to his own species.[1516] As this probably depends upon the\r\ngreat strength of his sexual impulse, we may infer that in primitive\r\ntimes, when man had a definite pairing season, he displayed a like\r\ntendency, and that the sexual instinct, in proportion as it has become\r\nless intense, has become more discriminating.\r\n\r\nEven now woman is more particular in her choice than man, provided\r\nthat the union takes place without reference to interest. A Maori\r\nproverb says, “Let a man be ever so good-looking, he will not be much\r\nsought after; but let a woman be ever so plain, men will still eagerly\r\nseek after her.”[1517] With regard to the Negroes of Sogno, Merolla\r\nda Sorrento states, “Women would have experience of their husbands\r\nbefore they married them, in like manner as the men were to have of\r\nthem; and in this particular I can aver that they are commonly much\r\nmore obstinate or fickle than men, for I have known many instances in\r\nwhich the men were willing to be married, while the women held back,\r\nand either fled away or made excuses.”[1518] Among the Eastern Central\r\nAfricans, according to Mr. Macdonald, many cases are known of slave\r\nwives running away from free husbands, but none of slave husbands\r\nrunning away from free wives.[1519] In the crossings between unequal\r\nhuman races, the father almost always belongs to the superior race.\r\n“In every case,” says M. de Quatrefages, “and especially in transient\r\namours, woman refuses to lower herself; man is less delicate.”[1520]\r\nThus, cases in which negresses form unions with the indigenous men of\r\nAmerica are very rare;[1521] and Dr. Nott, who wrote in the middle of\r\nthis century, never personally met any one who was the offspring of\r\na negro man and a white woman, because of the extreme rarity of such\r\nhalf-breeds.[1522] In New Zealand it sometimes happens that a European\r\nman marries a Maori woman; but Mr. Kerry Nicholls never came across an\r\ninstance where a European woman had married a Maori man.[1523] Even in\r\ncivilized society men are less particular in their connections than\r\nwomen of corresponding education, no doubt, would be, even if the rules\r\nof everyday morality were the same for both sexes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn this and the following four chapters we shall deal with the\r\ninstinctive feelings by which the sexes are guided in the act of\r\nselection. We have already observed that the sexual instinct is excited\r\nby artificial means, such as ornaments, mutilations, &c. Now we have\r\nto consider the intrinsic characters of a human being which affect the\r\npassions of a person of the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin has shown that, among the lower Vertebrata, the female\r\ncommonly gives the preference to “the most vigorous, defiant, and\r\nmettlesome male,”—a taste the origin of which is easily accounted for\r\nby the theory of natural selection. A similar instinctive appreciation\r\nof manly strength and courage is found in women, especially in the\r\nwomen of savage races. In a song, communicated by Mr. Schoolcraft,\r\nan Indian girl gives the following description of her ideal:— “My\r\nlove is tall and graceful as the young pine waving on the hill—And as\r\nswift in his course as the noble stately deer—His hair is flowing,\r\nand dark as the blackbird that floats through the air—And his eyes,\r\nlike the eagle’s, both piercing and bright—His heart, it is fearless\r\nand great—And his arm, it is strong in the fight.”[1524] A tale from\r\nMadagascar tells of a princess whose beauty fascinated all men.\r\nMany princes fought to obtain possession of her; but she refused\r\nthem all, and chose a lover who was young, handsome, courageous,\r\nand strong.[1525] The beautiful Atalanta gave herself to the best\r\nrunner;[1526] and the hero suitors of the Finnish myths had to undergo\r\ndifficult trials to prove their courage.[1527] “When a Dyak wants to\r\nmarry,” says Mr. Bock, “he must show himself a hero before he can\r\ngain favour with his intended.” He has to secure a number of human\r\nheads by killing men of hostile tribes; and the more heads he cuts off,\r\nthe greater the pride and admiration with which he is regarded by his\r\nbride.[1528] The demands of the Sàkalàva girls of Madagascar are less\r\ncruel. When a young man wishes to obtain a wife, his qualifications,\r\naccording to Mr. Sibree, are tested thus:—“Placed at a certain\r\ndistance from a clever caster of the spear, he is bidden to catch\r\nbetween his arm and side every spear thrown by the man opposite to him.\r\nIf he displays fear or fails to catch the spear, he is ignominiously\r\nrejected; but if there be no flinching and the spears are caught, he\r\nis at once proclaimed an accepted ‘lover.’” It is said that a similar\r\ncustom prevailed among the Bétsiléo, another Madagascar tribe.[1529]\r\nAmong the Dongolowees, as we are informed by Dr. Felkin, if two men are\r\nsuitors for a girl, and there is a difficulty in deciding between the\r\nrivals, the following method is adopted. The fair lady has a knife tied\r\nto each forearm, so fixed that the blade of the knife projects below\r\nthe elbow. She then takes up a position on a log of wood, the young\r\nmen sitting on either side with their legs closely pressed against\r\nhers. Raising her arms, the girl leans forward, and slowly presses the\r\nknives into the thighs of her would-be husbands. The suitor who best\r\nundergoes this trial of endurance wins the bride, whose first duty\r\nafter marriage is to dress the wounds she has herself inflicted.[1530]\r\nSpeaking of the natives on the River Darling, Major T. L. Mitchell\r\nsays that the possession of gins, or wives, appears to be associated\r\nwith all their ideas of fighting; “while, on the other hand, the gins\r\nhave it in their power on such occasions to evince that universal\r\ncharacteristic of the fair, a partiality for the brave. Thus it is,\r\nthat, after a battle, they do not always follow their fugitive husbands\r\nfrom the field, but frequently go over as a matter of course, to the\r\nvictors.”[1531]\r\n\r\nWe may infer that women’s instinctive inclination to strong and\r\ncourageous men is due to natural selection in two ways. A strong man\r\nis not only father of strong children, but he is also better able than\r\na weak man to protect his offspring. The female instinct is especially\r\nwell marked at the lower stages of civilization, because bodily vigour\r\nis then of most importance in the struggle for existence. The same\r\nprinciple explains the attraction which health in a woman has for men.\r\nIn civilized society, infirmity and sickliness are not always a serious\r\nhindrance to love, but in a savage state, says Alexander v. Humboldt,\r\n“nothing can induce a man to unite himself to a deformed woman, or one\r\nwho is very unhealthy.”[1532]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks conceived Eros as an extremely handsome youth, and\r\nAphrodite was the goddess of beauty as well as of love. So closely\r\nare these two ideas—love and beauty—connected. This connection is not\r\npeculiar to the civilized mind. In Tahiti, Cook saw several instances\r\nwhere women preferred personal beauty to interest.[1533] The Negroes of\r\nthe West African Coast, according to Mr. Winwood Reade, often discuss\r\nthe beauty of their women;[1534] and, among the cannibal savages of\r\nNorthern Queensland, described by Herr Lumholtz, the women take much\r\nnotice of a man’s face, especially of the part about the eyes.[1535]\r\nBut, although in every country, in every race, beauty stimulates\r\npassion, the ideas of what constitutes beauty vary indefinitely. As\r\nHume says, “Beauty is no quality in things themselves; it exists\r\nmerely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a\r\ndifferent beauty.”[1536]\r\n\r\nA flat, retreating brow seems to white men to spoil what would\r\notherwise be a pretty face; but “the Chinook ideal of facial beauty,”\r\nsays Mr. Bancroft, “is a straight line from the end of the nose to the\r\ncrown of the head.”[1537] A little snubnose may embitter the life of a\r\nEuropean girl; but the Australian natives “laugh at the sharp noses\r\nof Europeans, and call them in their language ‘tomahawk noses,’ much\r\npreferring their own style of flat broad noses.”[1538] The Tahitians\r\nfrequently said to Mr. Williams, “What a pity it is that English\r\nmothers pull the children’s noses so much, and make them so frightfully\r\nlong!”[1539] We admire white teeth and rosy cheeks; but a servant\r\nof the king of Cochin China spoke with contempt of the wife of the\r\nEnglish ambassador, because she had white teeth like a dog and a rosy\r\ncolour like that of potato flowers.[1540] In the northern parts of the\r\nChinese Empire, according to Pallas, those women are preferred who are\r\nof the Manchu type,—that is, who have a broad face, high cheek-bones,\r\nvery broad noses, and enormous ears;[1541] and the South American\r\nUaupés consider a swollen calf one of the chief attractions a young\r\nlady can possess, the result being that girls wear a tight garter below\r\nthe knee from infancy.[1542]\r\n\r\nEven among the Aryan peoples the standard of beauty varies. “To an\r\nhonest Fleming, who has never studied design,” says M. Bombet, “the\r\nforms of Rubens’s women are the most beautiful in the world. Let not\r\nus, who admire slenderness of form above everything else, and to whom\r\nthe figures even of Raphael’s women appear rather massive, be too ready\r\nto laugh at him. If we were to consider the matter closely, it would\r\nappear that each individual, and, consequently, each nation, has a\r\nseparate idea of beauty.”[1543]\r\n\r\nWhat human characteristics are considered beautiful, and how has\r\nbeauty come to influence the sexual selection of man? In trying to\r\nanswer these questions, we shall note only such characteristics as\r\nare held to be beautiful by considerable groups of men, apart from\r\nindividual differences of taste; and we shall confine ourselves to\r\nphysical beauty, as presenting itself in bodily forms and the colour\r\nof the skin. Mr. Spencer maintains that “mental and facial perfection\r\nare fundamentally connected,” and that “the aspects which please\r\nus are the outward correlatives of inward perfections, while the\r\naspects which displease us are the outward correlatives of inward\r\nimperfections.”[1544] But Mr. Spencer evidently looks upon beauty, or\r\n“facial perfection,” as something real in the sense in which mental\r\nqualities are real,—an opinion with which it is difficult to agree.\r\nThe lateral jutting-out of the cheek-bones, which seems to him an index\r\nof imperfection, is admired by many of the lower races.\r\n\r\nThe full development of those visible properties which are essential\r\nto the human organism is universally recognized as indispensable to\r\nperfect beauty,—natural deformity, the unsymmetrical shape of the\r\nbody, apparent traces of disease, &c., being regarded by every race as\r\nunfavourable to personal appearance. We distinguish between masculine\r\nand feminine beauty, and, in spite of racial differences, the ideas\r\nof what constitute these forms of beauty are fundamentally the same\r\nthroughout the world. To be really handsome a person must approach\r\nthe ideal type of his or her sex. The male organism is remarkable for\r\nthe development of the muscular system, the female for that of fatty\r\nelements; and conspicuous muscles are everywhere considered to improve\r\nthe appearance of a man, rounded forms that of a woman. According to v.\r\nHumboldt, the natives of Guiana, to express the beauty of a woman, say\r\nthat “she is fat and has a narrow forehead.” A traveller found that\r\na Kirghiz’s estimate of female beauty was regulated by the amount of\r\nfat, “for even when dilating on the beauties of his favourite wife,\r\nhe laid the greatest stress on her _embonpoint_.”[1545] The Kafirs\r\nand Hottentots are charmed by their women’s long and pendant breasts,\r\nwhich, in certain tribes, assume such monstrous dimensions, that the\r\nusual way of giving suck, when the child is carried on the back, is\r\nby throwing the breast over the shoulder.[1546] Mr. Reade tells us\r\nthat, among the Mpongwé of Gaboon, even very young girls “strive to\r\nemulate the pendant beauties of their seniors.”[1547] The Makololo\r\nwomen, according to Dr. Livingstone, make themselves fat and pretty\r\nby drinking a peculiar drink called “boyáloa”;[1548] and, among the\r\nTrarsa, a Moorish tribe in the Western Sahara, the women take immense\r\nquantities of milk and butter to make themselves more attractive.[1549]\r\nSuch exaggerations, however repugnant to a more refined taste,\r\nindicate a general tendency in men’s notions of female beauty.\r\n\r\nAmong Europeans, men are on an average two or three inches taller than\r\nwomen,[1550] and have a greater breadth of shoulder. A high-built\r\nand broad-shouldered figure is also regarded as an ideal of manly\r\nbeauty, whereas women who are very tall or broad are apt to be rather\r\nawkward. A woman’s face is shorter, her mouth less broad, her nose less\r\nprominent, her neck longer, her pelvis wider, her waist narrower than\r\na man’s; and her fingers are more slender and pointed, her hands and\r\nfeet smaller. The halving line of a woman’s body is lower than that of\r\na man’s, so that her steps are shorter and lighter.[1551] As a matter\r\nof fact, a long face, a broad mouth, and large hands and feet are much\r\nmore objectionable in a woman than in a man. Women have a special\r\nliking for low-bodied dresses, which display the full length of the\r\nneck; and by means of a corset they make the waist narrower than it is\r\nby nature.\r\n\r\nThere is thus an ideal of beauty which, no doubt, may be said to be\r\ncommon to the whole human race. But this ideal is merely an abstraction\r\nwhich can never be realized. General similarities in taste are\r\naccompanied by specific differences. Though every one admits that\r\na face without a nose is ugly, no particular form of the nose is\r\nuniversally admired; and races which regard a swelling bosom as essen—\r\ntial to feminine beauty differ widely from the Hottentots as to the\r\ncharm of pendant breasts.\r\n\r\nEvery race has, indeed, its own standard of beauty. Alexander von\r\nHumboldt long ago observed, “Nations attach the idea of beauty\r\nto everything which particularly characterizes their own physical\r\nconformation, their natural physiognomy. Thence it results that,\r\nif nature have bestowed very little beard, a narrow forehead, or\r\na brownish-red skin, every individual thinks himself beautiful in\r\nproportion as his body is destitute of hair, his head flattened,\r\nhis skin more covered with ‘annotto,’ or ‘chica,’ or some other\r\ncoppery-red colour.”[1552] This view has been adopted by several later\r\nwriters,[1553] but, as it has been disputed by others,[1554] it may\r\nbe well to bring together some fresh evidence, as an addition to that\r\ncollected by Mr. Darwin.\r\n\r\nThe Sinhalese, says Dr. Davy, who are great connoisseurs of the charms\r\nof the sex, and have books on the subject, and rules to aid the\r\njudgment, would not allow a woman to be perfectly beautiful unless she\r\nhad the following characteristics:—“Her hair should be voluminous like\r\nthe tail of the peacock, long, reaching to the knees, and terminating\r\nin graceful curls; her nose should be like the bill of the hawk, and\r\nlips bright and red, like coral on the young leaf of the iron-tree.\r\nHer neck should be large and round, her chest capacious, her breasts\r\nfirm and conical, like the yellow cocoa-nut, and her waist small—almost\r\nsmall enough to be clasped by the hand. Her lips should be wide; her\r\nlimbs tapering; the soles of her feet without any hollow, and the\r\nsurface of her body in general, soft, delicate, smooth, and rounded,\r\nwithout the asperities of projecting bones and sinews.” Dr. Davy adds,\r\n“The preceding is the most general external character that can be\r\ngiven of the Sinhalese.”[1555]\r\n\r\nThe women of the Indo-European race are remarkable for the length of\r\ntheir hair. “Dans nos contrées,” Isidore Geoffroy observes, “ces\r\ndéveloppements ajoutent à la beauté des femmes; dans d’autres pays,\r\nsi on les y observait, ils passeraient presque pour de légers vices\r\nde conformation.”[1556] “A small round face,” says Castrén, “full\r\nrosy red cheeks and lips, white forehead, black tresses, and small\r\ndark eyes are marks of a Samoyede beauty. Thus in a Samoyedian song\r\na girl is praised for her small eyes, her broad face, and its rosy\r\ncolour.”[1557] These, as we know, are the typical characteristics of\r\nthe Samoyedes.[1558] As to the Tartar women, who generally have far\r\nless prominent noses than we in Europe are accustomed to see, Father\r\nde Rubruquis states, “The less their noses the handsomer they are\r\nesteemed.”[1559] In Fiji, the remarkably broad occiput, peculiar\r\nto its people, is looked upon as a mark of beauty.[1560] Among the\r\nEgyptians Mr. Lane scarcely ever saw corpulent persons, and, unlike\r\nmany other African peoples, they do not admire very fat women:—“In\r\nhis love-songs, the Egyptian commonly describes the object of his\r\naffections as of slender figure, and small waist.”[1561] “The\r\nnegroes,” says v. Humboldt, “give the preference to the thickest and\r\nmost prominent lips; the Kalmucks to turned-up noses; and the Greeks,\r\nin the statues of heroes, raised the facial line from 85° to 100°\r\nbeyond nature. The Aztecs, who never disfigure the heads of their\r\nchildren, represent their principal divinities, as their hieroglyphical\r\nmanuscripts prove, with a head much more flattened than any I have ever\r\nseen among the Caribs.”[1562]\r\n\r\nThe fashion, prevalent among many peoples, of transforming parts of\r\nthe body, affords a good illustration of their ideas about personal\r\nbeauty. The Indians of North America, who have a low and flat forehead,\r\noften exaggerate this natural peculiarity by an artificial flattening\r\nof the forehead.[1563] In Tahiti, Samoa, and other islands of the\r\nPacific Ocean, it has been customary from time immemorial to flatten\r\nthe occiputs and to press the noses of the infants, as Professor\r\nGerland observes, in order to increase a national characteristic which\r\nis considered beautiful.[1564] The same practice occurs in Sumatra,\r\nand Marsden could learn no other reason for it, but that it was an\r\nimprovement of beauty in the estimation of the natives.[1565] Among\r\nthe Ovambo of South Africa, the fashion is quite different:—“With\r\nthe exception of the crown, which is always left untouched,” says\r\nAndersson, “the men often shave the head, which has the effect of\r\nmagnifying the natural prominence of the hinder parts of it.”[1566]\r\nAmong the Chinese, small feet are considered a woman’s chief\r\nattraction; hence the feet of girls are pressed from early childhood.\r\nNow we know from the measurements made by Scherzer and Schwarz, that\r\nChinese women have by nature unusually small feet—a peculiarity which\r\nhas always distinguished them from their Tartar neighbours. And, as a\r\nmatter of fact, the Manchu Tartars, who at present rule the Chinese\r\nEmpire, never press the feet of their daughters.[1567]\r\n\r\nEach race considers its own colour preferable to every other. The\r\nNorth American Indians admire “a tawny hide,” and the Chinese dislike\r\nthe white skin of the Europeans.[1568] Some young New Zealanders, who\r\nthemselves were lightly copper-coloured, were greatly amused at the\r\ndark tint of an Australian, and laughed at him for being so ugly.[1569]\r\nBarrington tells us on the other hand, of an Australian woman, who,\r\nhaving had a child by a white man, smoked it and rubbed it with oil to\r\ngive it a darker colour.[1570] The Hovas, who are probably, as a rule,\r\nthe lightest people in Madagascar, often put a spot of dark colour on\r\nthe cheeks, in order to heighten the effect of their fair complexion,\r\nof which they are very proud.[1571] Among the Malays, according to Mr.\r\nCrawfurd, “the standard of perfection in colour is virgin gold, and,\r\nas a European lover compares the bosom of his mistress to the whiteness\r\nof snow, the East Insular lover compares that of his to the yellowness\r\nof the precious metal.”[1572]\r\n\r\nThe object of the painting of the body, so commonly practised among\r\nsavages, seems sometimes to be to exaggerate the natural colour of the\r\nskin. Von Humboldt believes that this is the reason why the American\r\nIndians paint themselves with red ochre and earth.[1573] The natives\r\nof Tana, who have the colour of an old copper coin, usually dye their\r\nbodies a few shades darker;[1574] whilst the Bornabi Islanders, who\r\nhave a light copper-coloured complexion, “anoint their bodies with\r\nturmeric, in order to give themselves a whiter appearance.”[1575]\r\nThe Javanese, when in full dress, smear themselves with a yellow\r\ncosmetic.[1576] And, speaking of the people of a place in Maabar\r\n(Coromandel Coast), Marco Polo says, “The children that are born here\r\nare black enough, but the blacker they be the more they are thought\r\nof; wherefore from the day of their birth their parents do rub them\r\nevery week with oil of sesamé, so that they become as black as devils.\r\nMoreover, they make their gods black and their devils white, and the\r\nimages of their saints they do paint black all over.”[1577]\r\n\r\nThe question,—What characteristics of the human form are deemed\r\nbeautiful? may now be answered. Men find beauty in the full development\r\nof the visible characteristics belonging to the human organism in\r\ngeneral; of those peculiar to the sex; of those peculiar to the race.\r\nWe have next to consider the connection of love and beauty.\r\n\r\nThat this connection does not depend upon the æsthetic pleasure excited\r\nby beauty is obvious from the fact that the intrinsic character of\r\nan æsthetic feeling is disinterestedness, whereas the intrinsic\r\ncharacter of love is the very reverse. So far as beauty implies the\r\nfull development of characteristics essential to the human organism,\r\nor to either of the sexes, the preference given to it follows from the\r\ninstinctive inclination to healthiness, already mentioned, and needs\r\nno further discussion. The question is to explain the stimulating\r\ninfluence of racial perfection.\r\n\r\n“In barbarous nations,” says v. Humboldt, “there is a physiognomy\r\npeculiar to the tribe or horde rather than to any individual. When we\r\ncompare our domestic animals with those which inhabit our forests, we\r\nmake the same observation.”[1578] The accuracy of this statement has\r\nbeen confirmed by later writers;[1579] and we may say with M. Godron,\r\n“C’est —aujourd’hui un fait parfaitement acquis à la science, que plus\r\nun peuple se rapproche de l’état de nature, plus les hommes qui le\r\ncomposent se ressemblent entre eux.”[1580] This likeness does not refer\r\nto the physiognomy only, but to the body as a whole. The variations of\r\nstature, for instance, are known to be least considerable among the\r\npeoples least advanced in civilization.[1581]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that this greater similarity is due partly to\r\nthe greater uniformity of the conditions of life to which uncivilized\r\npeoples are subject. According to Villermé and Quetelet, an inequality\r\nof stature is observed not only between the inhabitants of towns on\r\nthe one hand and those of the country on the other, but also, in the\r\ninterior of towns, between individuals of different professions.[1582]\r\nThere is, however, another factor, which is, I think, of still greater\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe deviations from the national type, which occur sporadically, have\r\nbeen considered the result of disease, and can, as Professor Waitz\r\nobserves, “but rarely become permanent, as the national type is\r\nalways that which harmonizes with the soil and the climate, and the\r\nexternal relations in which the respective peoples live.”[1583] We must\r\nassume that a certain kind of constitution is best suited for certain\r\nconditions of life, and that every considerable deviation from this\r\nmust perish in the struggle for existence in a state in which natural\r\nselection is constantly at work and physical qualities are of the\r\nfirst importance. We know from Isidore Geoffroy’s investigations that\r\npersons who deviate much, with regard to the length of body, from the\r\ncommon standard—they may be dwarfs or giants—are, as a rule, abnormal\r\nin other respects also, being deficient in intelligence as well as in\r\nthe power of reproduction, and being especially liable to premature\r\ndeath.[1584] Sir W. Lawrence, too, remarks that the strength of men\r\nwho have considerably exceeded the ordinary standard has by no means\r\ncorresponded to their size, and that “there are very few instances of\r\nwhat we can deem healthy, well-made men, with all the proper attributes\r\nof the race, much below the general standard.”[1585] If, among\r\ncivilized peoples, such deviations indicate some disturbance of the\r\nvital functions, and, as a consequence, are unfavourable to existence,\r\nthis must be even more the case with savage tribes, all the members\r\nof which are subject to nearly the same conditions of life. Abnormal\r\ncharacteristics may sometimes flourish in a highly civilized society,\r\nbut they are doomed to perish in communities among whom the struggle\r\nfor existence is far more severe.\r\n\r\nIt may at first sight seem strange that all the characteristics,\r\nhowever slight, in which the various races of men differ from each\r\nother, should harmonize with particular conditions of life to the\r\nexclusion of others. But it must be remembered that, if we had fuller\r\nknowledge, characteristics which seem to us useless, or even hurtful,\r\nmight be seen to be useful. We know the utility of _some_ special\r\ncharacteristics, and that of others may, at least provisionally,\r\nbe assumed. It is certain that the physiological functions of most\r\npersons who quit their native land and settle in a wholly different\r\nregion, must undergo a considerable change if the new conditions are\r\nnot to have injurious effects. Moreover, many bodily structures are so\r\nintimately related, that when one part varies others vary also, though,\r\nin most instances, we are quite unable to assign any reason why this\r\nshould be the case.\r\n\r\nSavage men are generally distinguished for relatively large jaws,\r\nwhich, no doubt, are of use in a state of nature, where food is often\r\nhard and tough, where the jaws have to perform the functions of knife\r\nand fork, and where the teeth occasionally serve as implements. This\r\nracial peculiarity, being in fact only a mark of low civilization, is\r\nthus easily accounted for by the law of natural selection. The less\r\nman, with advancing civilization, was in want of large and strong jaws,\r\nthe greater was the chance for individuals born with smaller jaws to\r\nsurvive; hence a race with comparatively small jaws gradually arose.\r\nIndeed, Professor Virchow has shown that the prognathous type of face\r\nis inconsistent with the full development of the brain.[1586]\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity which characterizes the lower races of men is the\r\nlateral jutting-out of the cheek-bones. But, as Mr. Spencer observes,\r\nthis excessive size of the cheek-bones is only an accompaniment of\r\nlarge jaws. Other peculiarities of feature—depression of the bridge of\r\nthe nose, forward opening of the nostrils, wide-spread _alæ_, and a\r\nlong and large mouth—constantly coexist with large and protuberant jaws\r\nand great cheek-bones, alike in uncivilized races and in the young of\r\ncivilized races;[1587] hence we cannot believe that the connection is\r\nmerely accidental.\r\n\r\nProfessor Schaaffhausen has noticed that many peculiarities of the\r\nskull are coincident with arrested cerebral development and correlated\r\nto each other:—“The characters observed in the skulls of the lower\r\nraces, namely, a narrow and low frontal bone, a short sagittal\r\nsuture, a low temporal squama, a short occipital squama, the upper\r\nmargin of which forms a flat arch, are therefore to be considered\r\nas approximations to the animal form, and they stand to each other\r\nin organic connection.”[1588] It seems as if stature and muscular\r\nforce were in some way connected with the dolichocephalic and the\r\nbrachycephalic forms of the skull, for Welcker found that short men and\r\nshort races incline more to the latter, tall men and tall races to the\r\nformer. Again, according to Fick, the muscles exercise a remarkable\r\ninfluence on the form of the bones in general, and particularly upon\r\nsome cranial bones.[1589]\r\n\r\nThe process of acclimatization affords opportunities for the study of\r\nthe connection between organic structures and functions on the one\r\nhand, and surrounding nature on the other. At present, however, our\r\nknowledge of the subject is exceedingly scanty. It has been asserted\r\nthat the curly hair of the European becomes straight in America,—like\r\nthe hair of an Indian; that in North America, as in New South Wales,\r\nchildren of European parents are apt to become tall and lean, whilst\r\nthere is a tendency among European colonists at the Cape to grow\r\nfat,—which reminds us of the steatopygy of the native women.[1590]\r\nAlmost all that we know with certainty is that, in the process of\r\nacclimatization, man has to undergo a change, and that this change is\r\noften too great to be endurable. As Dr. Felkin observes, Europeans are\r\nalmost incapable of forming colonies in the tropics;[1591] and, with\r\nfew exceptions, they have been unable to rear a sound progeny there\r\nin marriage with white women.[1592] Colonel Hadden, who has spent\r\nsixteen years in India, informs me that it is a prevalent opinion\r\namong British officers in that country that an English regiment of a\r\nthousand men would, within thirteen years, from climate, disease, or\r\nother casualties, almost wholly die out. This statement well agrees\r\nwith Professor Sprenger’s, that a regiment consisting of eight hundred\r\nmen loses within ten years more than seven hundred.[1593] It is\r\nalso, according to Colonel Hadden, a common report that, of a third\r\ngeneration of pure Europeans in India, children only are, occasionally,\r\nmet with, and that they never reach the age of puberty.[1594] English\r\nparents, as a rule, send their children to Europe when five or six\r\nyears old, as otherwise they would succumb.[1595] According to\r\nMr. Squier, it is the concurrent testimony of all intelligent and\r\nobserving men in Central America that the pure whites are there not\r\nonly relatively but absolutely decreasing in numbers, whilst the\r\npure Indians are rapidly increasing, and the Ladinos more and more\r\napproximating to the aboriginal type.[1596]\r\n\r\nThe colour of the skin is justly considered one of the chief\r\ncharacteristics of race. Now it is quite impossible to assign any\r\ndefinite reason why one race is white, another black, brown, or\r\nyellow. Nobody has yet been able to prove that the colour of the skin\r\nis of any direct use to man, and it certainly is not the immediate\r\nresult of long exposure to a certain climate. But we know that there\r\nexists an intimate connection between the colour of the skin and\r\nbodily constitution. “Les colorations diverses,” says M. Godron,\r\n“qui distinguent les différentes variétés de l’espèce humaine,\r\ntiennent beaucoup moins aux agents physiques, qu’aux phénomènes les\r\nplus intimes de l’organisation qui dans l’état actuel de la science,\r\nnous échappent et resteront peut-être toujours couverts d’un voile\r\nimpénétrable.”[1597] Thus the alteration in the customary physiological\r\nfunctions called acclimatization, seems often to be connected with\r\nsome change of colour not directly depending upon the influence of the\r\nsun. Dr. Mayer observed that a European at the tropics loses his rosy\r\ncomplexion, the difference in colour between arterial and venous blood\r\nbeing strikingly diminished on account of the smaller absorption of\r\noxygen, which results from the feebler process of combustion.[1598]\r\nAccording to Dr. Tylor, it is asserted that the pure negro in the\r\nUnited States has undergone a change which has left him a shade lighter\r\nin complexion;[1599] whilst a long medical experience at New Orleans\r\nshowed Dr. Visinié that the blood of the American negro has lost the\r\nexcess of plasticity which it possessed in Africa.[1600] A negro boy\r\nbrought to Germany by Gerhard Rohlfs, changed his colour after a\r\nresidence of two years, from deep black to light brown.[1601] Klinkosch\r\nmentions the case of a negro who lost his blackness and became yellow;\r\nand Caldani declares that a negro, who was a shoemaker at Venice,\r\nwas black when brought, during infancy, to that city, but became\r\ngradually lighter, and had the hue of a person suffering from a slight\r\njaundice.[1602] In the ‘Philosophical Transactions,’ there is even a\r\nrecord of a negro who became as white as a European.[1603] On the other\r\nhand, we are told of an English gentleman Macnaughten by name, who\r\nlong lived the life of a native in the jungle of Southern India, and\r\nacquired, even on the clothed portions of his body, a skin as brown as\r\nthat of a Brahman.[1604] These statements, if true, certainly refer to\r\nexceedingly exceptional cases, but their accuracy cannot be _à priori_\r\ndenied. We know that certain organisms are much better able than others\r\nto undergo the change which constitutes acclimatization, and we have\r\nno positive reason to doubt that this power may, in abnormal cases, be\r\nextraordinarily great. At any rate, it is beyond doubt that a close\r\nconnection exists between the colour of the skin and the physiological\r\nfunctions of the body, on the one hand, and between these and the\r\nconditions of life on the other. Disease is commonly accompanied by a\r\nchange of colour. Mr. Wallace observes that, in many islands of the\r\nMalay Archipelago, species of widely different genera of butterflies\r\ndiffer in precisely the same way as to colour or form from allied\r\nspecies in other islands.[1605] The same thing occurs to a less degree\r\nin other parts of the world also. And Agassiz has pointed out that,\r\nin Asia and Africa, the large apes and the human races have the same\r\ncolour of the skin.[1606]\r\n\r\nWe may thus take for granted that racial peculiarities stand in some\r\nconnection with the external circumstances in which the various races\r\nlive. It may perhaps be objected that we meet with native tribes of\r\nvarious types on the same degree of latitude, and under the same\r\nclimatic conditions.[1607] But we must remember that it is often\r\nimpossible to decide whether the conditions of life are exactly the\r\nsame; that intermixture of blood has caused a great confusion of racial\r\ntypes; and that all peoples have arrived at their present localities\r\nafter more or less extensive migrations. We may be sure that some\r\ncharacters have been preserved from earlier times when the race lived\r\nin other circumstances, and that the higher its degree of civilization\r\nthe less likely it would be to lose the stamp impressed upon it.[1608]\r\n\r\nIt is, however, exceedingly doubtful whether racial differences are so\r\ndirectly the result of external influences as anthropologists generally\r\nbelieve,—that is, whether they are the inherited effects of conditions\r\nof life to which previous generations have been subject. Professor\r\nWeismann, as is well known, thinks that acquired characters are not\r\ntransmitted from parent to offspring. “It has never been proved,” he\r\nsays, “that acquired characters are transmitted, and it has never been\r\ndemonstrated that, without the aid of such transmission, the evolution\r\nof the organic world becomes unintelligible.”[1609] Man has from time\r\nimmemorial mutilated his body in various ways, and there is not a\r\nsingle well-founded case of these mutilations having been inherited\r\nby the offspring.[1610] The children of accomplished pianists do not\r\ninherit the art of playing the piano. Facts show that children of\r\nhighly civilized nations have no trace of a language, when they have\r\ngrown up in a wild condition and in complete isolation.[1611] Change in\r\ncolour influenced by sun and air is obviously temporary. The children\r\nof the husbandman, or of the sailor, are just as fair as those of the\r\nmost delicate and pale inhabitant of a city; and, although the Moors,\r\nwho have lived in Africa since the seventh century, are generally in\r\nmature life very sunburnt, their children are as white as those born in\r\nEurope, and “restent blancs toute leur vie, quand leurs travaux ne les\r\nexposent pas aux ardeurs du soleil.”[1612]\r\n\r\nSuch facts are certainly not in favour of the prevalent theory that the\r\ndifferences of race are due to direct adaptation. Whether Professor\r\nWeismann’s theory proves to be well founded or not, we manifestly\r\ncannot assume that the heredity of acquired characters suffices to\r\nexplain the origin of the human races. It seems most probable that, at\r\nthe very earliest stages of human evolution, mankind was restricted to\r\na comparatively small area, and was then homogeneous, as every animal\r\nand vegetable species is under similar conditions. In the struggle\r\nfor existence the intellectual faculties of man were developed, and\r\nbefore the breaking away of isolated groups he may have invented the\r\nart of making fire, and of fabricating the simplest implements and\r\nweapons. This mental superiority made it possible for man to disperse,\r\nenabling him to exist even under conditions somewhat different from\r\nthose to which he was originally adapted. His organism had to undergo\r\ncertain changes, but we are not aware that these modifications were\r\ntransmitted to descendants. All that we know is, that the children born\r\nwere not exactly like each other, and that those who happened to vary\r\nmost in accordance with the new conditions of life as a rule survived,\r\nand became the ancestors of following generations. The congenital\r\ncharacters which enabled them to survive were of course transmitted\r\nto their offspring, and thus, through natural selection,[1613] races\r\nwould gradually arise, the members of each of which would have as\r\nhereditary dispositions the same peculiarities as those which, to a\r\ncertain extent, may be acquired through acclimatization, but then\r\nonly for the individual himself, not for his descendants. We can thus\r\nunderstand how the children of a negro are black[1614]—even if they are\r\nborn in Europe[1615]—as the black colour is the correlative of certain\r\nphysiological processes favourable to existence in the country of their\r\nrace. They survive, whilst the children of Europeans who have emigrated\r\nto the tropics are carried off in great numbers, even though their\r\nparents have succeeded in undergoing the functional modifications which\r\naccompanied the change of abode.\r\n\r\nThis explanation of racial differences seems the more acceptable, when\r\nwe take into consideration the immense period which has elapsed since\r\nman began to spread over the earth, and the slow and gradual change\r\nof abodes. He was not at once moved from the tropics to the polar\r\nzones, or from the polar zones to the tropics, but had to undergo an\r\nindefinitely long chain of adaptive processes. Thus were gradually\r\nestablished such radical differences as those which distinguish a\r\nEuropean from a negro, an Australian from a Red-skin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now found an answer to our question, why man, in the choice of\r\nmate, gives the preference to the best representatives of his race. The\r\nfull development of racial characters indicates health, a deviation\r\nfrom them indicates disease. Physical beauty is thus in every respect\r\nthe outward manifestation of physical perfection, or healthiness, and\r\nthe development of the instinct which prefers beauty to ugliness is\r\nevidently within the power of natural selection.\r\n\r\nThis explanation of the connection between love and beauty, as also\r\nof the origin of the races of men, is very different from that given\r\nby Mr. Darwin. “The men of each race,” he says, “prefer what they\r\nare accustomed to; they cannot endure any great change; but they\r\nlike variety, and admire each characteristic carried to a moderate\r\nextreme.... As the great anatomist Bichat long ago said, if every one\r\nwere cast in the same mould, there would be no such thing as beauty.\r\nIf all our women were to become as beautiful as the Venus de’ Medici,\r\nwe should for a time be charmed; but we should soon wish for variety,\r\nand as soon as we had obtained variety, we should wish to see certain\r\ncharacters a little exaggerated beyond the then existing common\r\nstandard.”[1616]\r\n\r\nIn the fashions of our own dress, says Mr. Darwin, we see exactly\r\nthe same principle and the same desire to carry every point to an\r\nextreme.[1617] Man prefers, to a certain extent, what he is accustomed\r\nto see. Thus the Maoris, who are in the habit of dyeing their lips\r\nblue, consider it “a reproach to a woman to have red lips;”[1618]\r\nand we ourselves dislike, on the whole, any great deviation from the\r\nleading fashions. But, on the other hand, man wants variety. Now in\r\none, now in another way, he changes his dress in order to attract\r\nattention, or to charm. The fashions of savages are certainly more\r\npermanent than ours;[1619] but the extreme diversity of ornaments with\r\nwhich many uncivilized peoples bedeck themselves, shows their emulation\r\nto make themselves attractive by means of new enticements. “Each\r\nof the Outanatas (New Guinea),” says Mr. Earl, “seemed desirous of\r\nornamenting himself in some way different from his neighbour;”[1620]\r\nand, with regard to the Pacific Islanders, Mr. John Williams remarks\r\nthat “the inhabitants of almost every group ... have their peculiar\r\nideas as to what constitutes an addition to beauty.”[1621] But it is\r\nimpossible to believe that the different races’ ideal of personal\r\nbeauty are in any way connected with this capriciousness of taste.\r\nWere this the case, as Mr. Darwin suggests, the men of each race would\r\nadmire variations and piquant peculiarities in the appearance of their\r\nwomen, and not only each _characteristic_ point “carried to a moderate\r\nextreme.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Darwin, racial differences are due to the different\r\nstandards of beauty, whereas, according to the theory here indicated,\r\nthe different standards of beauty are due to racial differences. “Let\r\nus suppose,” says Mr. Darwin, “the members of a tribe, practising\r\nsome form of marriage, to spread over an unoccupied continent, they\r\nwould soon split up into distinct hordes, separated from each other\r\nby various barriers, and still more effectually by the incessant wars\r\nbetween all barbarous nations. The hordes would thus be exposed to\r\nslightly different conditions and habits of life, and would sooner or\r\nlater come to differ in some small degree. As soon as this occurred,\r\neach isolated tribe would form for itself a slightly different standard\r\nof beauty; and then unconscious selection would come into action\r\nthrough the more powerful and leading men preferring certain women to\r\nothers. Thus the differences between the tribes, at first very slight,\r\nwould gradually and inevitably be more or less increased.”[1622] This\r\ntheory—that racial differences are due to sexual selection—obviously\r\npresupposes either that the human organism is alike well fitted to any\r\nclimate and natural conditions; or that no correlation exists between\r\nthe visible parts of the body and its functions. Otherwise, of course,\r\nlittle effect could be produced through the preference given to certain\r\nindividuals; for in a savage state, where celibacy is an exception,\r\nthose men and women whose constitution was best suited to the\r\nconditions of life would, in any case, in the end, determine the racial\r\ntype. It is also difficult to see how those slight variations from the\r\noriginal human type, which, according to Mr. Darwin, characterized\r\nthe distinct hordes or tribes into which mankind was split up, could\r\nhave developed into such enormous differences as we find in the colour\r\nof the skin of, for example, a negro and a European—only through the\r\nselection of the best representatives of these tribal peculiarities,\r\nthese slight variations. Finally, it seems doubtful whether Mr. Darwin\r\nwould have ascribed racial differences in colour to the influence\r\nof sexual selection, had he considered the important fact, already\r\nmentioned, that the larger apes have the same colour of the skin as the\r\nhuman races living in the same country.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin also thinks that the differences in external appearance\r\nbetween man and the lower animals are, to a certain extent, due to\r\nsexual selection. The chief character of the human race which he\r\nproposes to account for in this way is the general hairlessness of the\r\nbody. “No one supposes,” he says, “that the nakedness of the skin\r\nis any direct advantage to man; his body therefore cannot have been\r\ndivested of hair through natural selection.”[1623] It is curious that\r\nthe hairlessness of man has puzzled so many anthropologists,[1624] as\r\nit may very easily be explained by the law of variation. When man had\r\ninvented the art of making fire, and the idea of covering himself to\r\nsecure protection from cold had occurred to his mind, hairlessness\r\nwas no serious disadvantage in the struggle for existence. Hence\r\nnatural selection ceased to operate in the matter, and a hairless race\r\ngradually arose. We find the same principle at work in various other\r\nways. Civilized man does not need such keen vision as savages;[1625]\r\nconsequently many of us are short-sighted and few Europeans could\r\nmatch a Red Indian in his power of detecting the symptoms of a trail.\r\nFor the same reason we are generally inferior to savages in the\r\ncapacity for discriminating odours, and our teeth are apt to be very\r\nmuch less sound and vigorous than theirs.\r\n\r\nThat sexual selection has had _some_ influence on the physical aspect\r\nof mankind is probable. Accurate observers in different parts of the\r\nworld have remarked that personal deformities are very rare in savage\r\nraces unaffected by European influence.[1626] This chiefly depends upon\r\nthe fact that deformed individuals seldom survive the hardships of\r\nearly life, but, as Sir W. Lawrence says, if they do survive, they are\r\nprevented by the kind of aversion they inspire from propagating their\r\ndeformities.[1627] It is not unlikely that the selection of the best\r\nrepresentatives of the race contributes to keep the racial type pure.\r\nSexual selection, too, may be the cause why, among savages, the men are\r\nso often handsomer than the women—that is, better specimens of their\r\nsex and their race;[1628] whilst, in civilized society, the reverse is\r\ntrue. We have seen that savage women have great liberty of disposing\r\nof their own hand, and that, at lower stages of civilization, celibacy\r\noccurs almost exclusively among the men. Among us, on the contrary,\r\nthe unmarried women outnumber the unmarried men, and, whilst a man’s\r\nability to marry depends only to a small extent upon his personal\r\nappearance, the like may certainly not be said of women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE LAW OF SIMILARITY\r\n\r\n\r\nA powerful instinct keeps animals from pairing with individuals\r\nbelonging to another species than their own. “L’animal,” says\r\nM. Duvernoy, “a l’instinct de se rapprocher de son espèce et de\r\ns’éloigner des autres, comme il a celui de choisir ses aliments et\r\nd’éviter les poisons.”[1629] Among Birds, there are found a small\r\nnumber of wild hybrids, nearly all of which are in the order of\r\nGallinae, and most of which belong to the genus Tetrao.[1630] But among\r\nInsects, Fishes, and Mammals, living in a state of nature, hybridism\r\nis unknown or almost so.[1631] And, even among domesticated mammals,\r\nsome tricks are often required to deceive the male, and so to conquer\r\nits aversion to a female of a different species. The stallion, for\r\ninstance, who is to cover a she-ass, is frequently first excited by the\r\npresence of a mare, for which, at the proper moment, the she-ass is\r\nsubstituted.[1632]\r\n\r\nWe may be sure that, were it not for this instinctive feeling, many\r\nmore animal hybrids would be naturally produced than is the case. In\r\nthe vegetable kingdom, where the play of instincts is altogether out\r\nof the question, bastards occur much more frequently;[1633] and in\r\ncaptivity a considerable number of animal hybrid forms are produced\r\nthat are never met with in a state of nature.[1634] Yet, according to\r\nMr. Darwin, there are good grounds for the doctrine of Pallas, that\r\nthe conditions to which domesticated animals and cultivated plants\r\nhave been subjected, generally eliminate the tendency towards mutual\r\nsterility, so that the domesticated descendants of species which\r\nin their natural state would have been in some degree sterile when\r\ncrossed, become perfectly fertile.[1635]\r\n\r\nThe origin of this instinct, which helps to keep even closely allied\r\nspecies in a state of nature distinct, seems to be sufficiently clear.\r\nThe number of species which have proved fertile together are very\r\nlimited, and the fertility of the hybrid offspring is almost constantly\r\ndiminished, often even to a very great extent. Of course, no one\r\nnow talks of the sterility of hybrids as a moral necessity—hybrids\r\nbeing _animalia adulterina_,—or as the result of a special divine\r\ndecree, that new species should not be multiplied indefinitely.[1636]\r\nM. Isidore Geoffroy has shown not only that hybrids may be fertile,\r\nbut that “infertile” hybrids are, properly speaking, merely the\r\nhybrids which are most rarely fertile, their sterility never being\r\nabsolute.[1637] Moreover, as has been pointed out by Mr. Wallace, in\r\nalmost all the experiments that have hitherto been made in crossing\r\ndistinct species, no care has been taken to avoid close interbreeding;\r\nhence these experiments cannot be held to prove that hybrids are\r\nin all cases infertile _inter se_.[1638] But looking to all the\r\nascertained facts on the intercrossing of plants and animals, we may\r\nwith Mr. Darwin conclude that some degree of sterility in hybrids is an\r\nextremely general result.[1639] This being the case with the hybrids of\r\nour domesticated animals, it must be so all the more with animals in a\r\nstate of nature, which generally live under conditions less favourable\r\nto mutual fertility. It is easy to understand, then, that instincts\r\nleading to intercrossing of different species, even if appearing\r\noccasionally, never could be long-lived, as only those animals which\r\npreferred pairing with individuals of their own species, gave birth\r\nto an offspring endowed with a normal power of reproduction, and thus\r\nbecame the founders of numerous generations that inherited their\r\ninstincts.\r\n\r\nThe relative or absolute sterility characterizing first crosses and\r\nhybrids depends upon a biological law which might be called the “Law\r\nof Similarity.” The degree of sterility, in either case,[1640] runs,\r\nat least to a certain extent, parallel with the general affinity of\r\nthe forms that are united. Thus, most animal hybrids are produced by\r\nindividuals belonging to the same genus, whilst species belonging to\r\ndistinct genera can rarely, and those belonging to distinct families\r\nperhaps never, be crossed.[1641] The parallelism, however, is not\r\ncomplete, for a multitude of closely allied species will not unite,\r\nor unite only with great difficulty, though other species, widely\r\ndifferent from each other, can be crossed with facility. Hence Mr.\r\nDarwin infers that the difficulty or facility in crossing “apparently\r\ndepends exclusively on the sexual constitution of the species which\r\nare crossed, or on their sexual elective affinity, _i.e._, the\r\n‘Wahlverwandtschaft’ of Gärtner.” But as species rarely, or never,\r\nbecome modified in one character, without being at the same time\r\nmodified in many, and as systematic affinity includes all visible\r\nresemblances and dissimilarities, any difference in sexual constitution\r\nbetween two species would naturally stand in more or less close\r\nrelation with their systematic position.[1642]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the instinct in question, man follows the general rule\r\nin the animal kingdom. Our notions of morality are closely connected\r\nwith the instinctive feelings engraved in our nature; and bestiality\r\nis commonly looked upon as one of the most heinous crimes of which man\r\ncan make himself guilty. Several passages both in ancient[1643] and\r\nmodern writers[1644] prove the occasional occurrence of this crime, but\r\nalways under circumstances analogous to those under which single birds\r\nsometimes form connections against nature,[1645] _i.e._, either because\r\nof isolation, or on account of vitiated instincts.[1646]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSupporters of the hypothesis that the several races of man are distinct\r\nspecies of the genus Homo, assert that an instinctive aversion similar\r\nto that which keeps different animal species from intermingling, exists\r\nalso between the various human races.[1647] It may be noted by the\r\nway that, even if this were true, the idea that mankind consists of\r\nvarious species might be controverted; for certain races of domestic\r\nor semi-domesticated animals seem to prefer breeding with their own\r\nkind and refuse to mingle with others. Thus Mr. Bennett states that\r\nthe dark and pale coloured herds of fallow deer, which have long been\r\nkept together in the Forest of Dean and two other places, have never\r\nbeen known to mingle. On one of the Faroe Islands, the half-wild native\r\nblack sheep are said not to have readily mixed with the imported white\r\nsheep. And in Circassia, where six sub-races of the horse are known and\r\nhave received distinct names, horses of three of these races, whilst\r\nliving a free life, almost always refuse to mingle and cross, and will\r\neven attack each other.[1648] As for man, there are many races who\r\ndislike marrying persons of another race, but the motives are various.\r\nThe different ideas of beauty no doubt play an important part. Mr.\r\nWinwoode Reade does not think it probable that negroes would prefer\r\neven the most beautiful European woman, on the mere grounds of physical\r\nadmiration, to a good-looking negress.[1649] A civilized race does not\r\nreadily intermingle with one less advanced in civilization, from the\r\nsame motives as those which prevent a lord from marrying a peasant\r\ngirl. And more than anything else, I think, the enmity, or at least,\r\nwant of sympathy, due to difference of interests, ideas, and habits,\r\nwhich so often exist between distinct peoples or tribes, helps to keep\r\nraces separate. But such reasons as these have nothing in common with\r\nthe instinctive feeling which deters animals of distinct species from\r\npairing with each other. Hence, when two races come into very close\r\nmutual contact, especially if they are at about the same stage of\r\ncivilization, their dislike to intermarriage commonly disappears.\r\n\r\nMongrels form, indeed, a large proportion of the inhabitants of the\r\nworld. It is doubtful whether there are any pure races in Europe; not\r\neven the Basques can pretend to purity of blood.[1650] M. Broca found,\r\nwhen investigating the subject of stature, that nineteen-twentieths\r\nof the whole population of France presented, in various degrees, the\r\ncharacters of mixed races.[1651] In North America, different races\r\nintermingle more and more every day. In Greenland, according to Dr.\r\nNansen, in the course of a century and a half there has been such\r\nan intermixture of races that it would now be extremely difficult,\r\nif not impossible, to find a true Eskimo throughout the whole of\r\nthe west coast; and the Europeans, far from being disliked by the\r\nnative women have succeeded in inspiring them with so much respect\r\nthat the “simplest European sailor is preferred to the best Eskimo\r\nseal catcher.”[1652] In Mexico, the Spanish mixed breeds constitute\r\ntwo-thirds or three-fourths of the whole population;[1653] and South\r\nAmerica, to quote a French writer, is “le grand laboratoire des\r\nnations hybrides ou métisses modernes.”[1654] Of twelve millions of\r\nmongrels, which is the estimated number of mongrels on the face of\r\nthe globe, no fewer than eleven millions are found there.[1655] Even\r\nin remote Tierra del Fuego, according to Mr. Bridges, some mongrels of\r\nEuropean fathers and indigenous mothers have appeared during the last\r\nfew years.\r\n\r\nIn Asia there are numberless instances of intermixture of breed between\r\nthe Tartars, Mongols, and Tunguses, and the Russians and Chinese,\r\n&c.[1656] In India there are many Eurasians; in the Indian Archipelago\r\nChinese and Malays intermarry;[1657] and, in the Islands of the South\r\nSea, the mongrels of European fathers amount to a considerable number.\r\nIn Africa, the eastern Soudan is a great centre of mixed breeds between\r\nraces much removed from one another. And, in Southern Africa, the\r\nGriquas—the offspring of Dutch colonists and Hottentot women—form a\r\nvery distinct race.\r\n\r\nAs far as we know, there are no human races who, when intermingled,\r\nare entirely sterile. But as regards the degree of fertility of first\r\ncrosses and of mongrels, the opinions of different anthropologists\r\nvary considerably. Those who do not believe in the unity of the human\r\nrace have been especially solicitous to prove that crosses are almost\r\ninevitably followed by bad results in that respect. Thus Dr. Knox\r\nthinks that the half-breeds, if they were abandoned to themselves\r\nand no longer had access to pure races, would rapidly disappear, the\r\n“hybrid” being rejected by nature as a degradation of humanity.[1658]\r\nDr. Nott asserts that, when two proximate species of mankind, two\r\nraces bearing a general resemblance to each other in type, are bred\r\ntogether, they produce offspring perfectly prolific; but that, when\r\nspecies the most widely separated, such as the Anglo-Saxon and the\r\nnegro, are crossed, the mulatto offspring are but partially prolific,\r\nand acquire an inherent tendency to run out, and become eventually\r\nextinct, when kept apart from the parent stocks.[1659] The same opinion\r\nis entertained by M. Broca, and by M. Pouchet, who thinks that the\r\ncrossed race will exist only if it continues to be supported by the\r\ntwo creating types remaining in the midst of it.[1660]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Dr. Prichard believes it may be asserted, without\r\nthe least chance of valid contradiction, that mankind, of all races and\r\nvarieties, are equally capable of having offspring by intermarriage,\r\nand that such connections are equally prolific whether contracted\r\nbetween individuals of the same variety or of the most dissimilar\r\nvarieties. “If there is any difference,” he says, “it is probably\r\nin favour of the latter.”[1661] According to M. Godron, the mongrels\r\nhave generally shown a higher degree of fertility than their parent\r\nraces;[1662] and M. Quatrefages asserts that mulattoes are as fruitful\r\nas pure breeds.[1663]\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that so little attention has for some time been\r\npaid to this most important question. The result is that the effects\r\nof the intermixture of races are not much better known now, than they\r\nwere twenty or thirty years ago. The only thing which may be considered\r\ncertain is, that the hypothesis of the depressing influence of crossing\r\nupon fertility, as the theory has generally been propounded, involves\r\na great deal of exaggeration. It is chiefly owing to M. Broca’s\r\ncelebrated essay, ‘Sur l’hybridité,’ that this doctrine has been so\r\nwidely accepted. He asserts that the connections of Europeans with\r\nAustralian women have proved very slightly prolific, and that the\r\nmongrels resulting from them are almost sterile. “No statistical\r\nwriter,” he says, “nor any historian, enumerates cross-breeds among\r\nthe Australian population.”[1664] Yet, this land has for a considerable\r\ntime been inhabited by European colonists, many of whom have not had\r\nopportunities of marrying wives of their own race. It has also been\r\nshown that the cohabitation of whites and native women is very common\r\nin Australia. But the number of mongrels there is, nevertheless,\r\nexceedingly small, so small that in the native dialects there does not\r\nexist a single word to designate them.[1665]\r\n\r\nSupposing that these remarkable statements referred chiefly to the\r\neastern and southern parts of the Australian continent, I asked Bishop\r\nR. Salvado and the Rev. Joseph Johnston, living in West Australia, to\r\ninform me whether, in that country, any mixed race exists, and, if so,\r\nwhether it is fruitful or not. From the former, who has lived among the\r\nWest Australian aborigines for more than forty years, and through an\r\nexcellent work on their life and customs has gained the reputation of\r\na first-rate authority, I had the pleasure of receiving the following\r\nanswer, dated New Norcia, October 17, 1888:—“With regard to the\r\nsterility of the half-caste natives, of which I had no experience when\r\nI wrote my book, I am able now to deny it altogether, except in cases\r\nsimilar to those among the Europeans. I know several cases of husband\r\nand wife, half-caste natives, having at present six and seven and even\r\neight children, and they may in time have more; and I know a good many\r\nEuropeans who, having married native women, have several children. In\r\nfact, in the case of one of those marriages there were six children,\r\nand in another seven, and I could give the name of each of them.”\r\nThe Rev. J. Johnston writes, “There is a school for half-caste boys\r\nand girls at Perth, and they seem bright and intelligent children,\r\nnot unlike Polynesian children. As they grow up, they go out to\r\nservice, and some of the youths are employed as post and telegraph\r\nmessengers.... At the New Norcia mission, there are several half-caste\r\nfamilies, as well as blacks, and they all have children.” The following\r\nstatement of Mr. Taplin referring to the aborigines of the Lower\r\nMurray, goes in the same direction:—“The pure blacks,” he says,\r\n“are not so healthy as the half-castes. Always the children of two\r\nhalf-castes will be healthier and stronger than either the children of\r\nblacks or the children of a black and a half-caste. When a half-caste\r\nman and woman marry, they generally have a large and vigorous family. I\r\ncould point to half a dozen such.”[1666]\r\n\r\nThese statements of highly competent persons are, I think, quite\r\nsufficient to disprove M. Broca’s hypothesis. They show that, if\r\na mixed race is almost wanting in certain parts of Australia, this\r\ndoes not depend upon physiological conditions of the kind suggested.\r\nIt should be remembered that the sexual intercourse of Europeans\r\nwith savage women is most commonly transitory and accidental, and\r\nfrequently takes place with prostitutes or licentious women, who are\r\ngenerally known to be sterile. And, even when the white settler takes\r\na native’s daughter to live with him under his own roof as a wife or\r\na concubine, and accustoms her to a half-civilized manner of living,\r\nher unfruitfulness[1667] may be owing to quite another cause than the\r\nmixture of blood. Mr. Darwin has shown that changed conditions of\r\nlife have an especial power of acting injuriously on the reproductive\r\nsystem. Thus animals, as also plants, when removed from their natural\r\nconditions, are often rendered in some degree infertile or completely\r\nbarren, even when the conditions have not been greatly changed. And\r\nthis failure of animals to breed under confinement cannot, at least\r\nto any considerable extent, depend upon a failure in their sexual\r\ninstincts. “Numerous cases,” says Mr. Darwin, “have been given of\r\nvarious animals which couple freely under confinement, but never\r\nconceive; or, if they conceive and produce young, these are fewer in\r\nnumber than is natural to the species.”[1668] It is reasonable to\r\nsuppose that savage man, when he moves into more civilized conditions,\r\nis subject to the same law. Indeed, statements have been reported to\r\nme, which tend to show that the indigenous women at the Polynesian\r\nmissionary stations have become less fruitful than they were in their\r\nnative state. As to the alleged sterility of crosses between the\r\nEuropean and Australian races, it should be observed that the rarity\r\nof mongrels in certain parts of Australia is more or less owing to\r\nthe natives themselves habitually destroying the half-castes.[1669]\r\nThe Rev. A. Meyer states that, in the Encounter Bay tribe, “nearly\r\nall the children of European fathers used to be put to death;”[1670]\r\nwhilst, among the Narrinyeri, about one-half of the half-caste infants\r\nfell victims to the jealousy of their mothers’ husbands.[1671] But\r\nwith regard to the West Australian aborigines in the neighbourhood of\r\nFremantle, the Rev. J. Johnston writes that he does not think it has\r\nbeen the custom there to destroy the half-caste illegitimate offspring\r\nof black women, as he never heard of such a thing,—a fact which may\r\naccount for the comparatively large number of mongrels in that part of\r\nthe continent.\r\n\r\nOther statements also, adduced as evidence for the hypothesis of\r\nM. Broca, have proved more or less untrustworthy. Thus the alleged\r\nsterility of the mulattoes of Jamaica[1672] has been disputed by other\r\nwriters.[1673] So also v. Görtz’s statement that the children of the\r\nDutch and Malay women in Java (Lipplapps) are only productive to the\r\nthird generation,[1674] has been called in question.[1675]\r\n\r\nYet, although we may consider it certain that the diversities even\r\nbetween the races which least resemble each other are not so great\r\nbut that, under favourable conditions, a mixed race may easily be\r\nproduced, I do not deny the possibility of crossing being, to a certain\r\nextent, unfavourable to fertility. The statements as to the rapid\r\nincrease of some mixed races do not prove the reverse. For the bad\r\nresult of crossing would not necessarily appear at once; and a drop\r\nof pure blood would be sufficient to increase fertility, just as,\r\nwhen a hybrid is crossed with either pure parent species, sterility\r\nis usually much lessened.[1676] It is a remarkable fact that mixed\r\nmarriages between Jews and persons of other races are comparatively\r\ninfertile. In Prussia, these marriages have been separately registered\r\nsince 1875, and between that year and 1881 there was an average of\r\n1·63 to a marriage, whereas, during the same period, pure Jewish\r\nmarriages resulted in an average of 4·41 children or very nearly three\r\ntimes as many. In Bavaria, between 1876 and 1880, the numbers were\r\nonly 1·1 per marriage against 4·7 children to purely Jewish marriages.\r\nAnd this conspicuous infertility implies greater sterility. Among\r\nfifty-six such marriages, with regard to which Mr. Jacobs ascertained\r\nthe results, no fewer than nine were sterile, _i.e._, 18 per cent.,—a\r\nstriking contrast to the number of sterile marriages which he found in\r\nseventy-one marriages between Jewish cousins, where the percentage of\r\nsterility was only 5·4 per cent.[1677] Mr. Jacobs, however, informs\r\nme that it has been suggested that this infertility may be due rather\r\nto the higher age at which such marriages are likely to take place.\r\nThere is still a strong feeling against them among Jews, which is\r\nonly likely to be overcome after independence of thought and position\r\nhas been reached. At the same time Mr. Jacobs does not consider this\r\nsufficient to account for the very great discrepancy. But we must not,\r\nof course, take for granted that the crossing of any two races has the\r\nsame effects as the crossing of Jewish and non-Jewish Europeans seems\r\nto have.\r\n\r\nEven if it could be proved, however, that mixture of races produces\r\nlessened fertility of first crosses and of mongrels, this would not\r\nmake it necessary for us to reject the doctrine of the unity of\r\nmankind. It is true that the domesticated varieties both of animals and\r\nof plants, when crossed, are as a general rule prolific, in some cases\r\neven more so than the purely bred parent varieties; whereas species,\r\nwhen crossed, and their hybrid offspring, are almost invariably in some\r\ndegree sterile. But this rule is not altogether without exceptions.\r\nEven Agassiz condemned the employment of fertility of union as a\r\nlimiting principle. He considered this a fallacy, “or at least a\r\n_petitio principii_, not admissible in a philosophical discussion of\r\nwhat truly constitutes the characteristics of species.”[1678] Thus the\r\nred and yellow varieties of maize are in some degree infertile when\r\ncrossed, and the blue-and the red-flowered forms of the pimpernel,\r\nconsidered by most botanists to be the same species, as they present no\r\ndifferences of form or structure, are, according to Gärtner, mutually\r\nsterile. Moreover, Mr. Darwin’s investigations on dimorphic and\r\ntrimorphic plants have shown that the physiological test of lessened\r\nfertility, both in first crosses and in hybrids, is no safe criterion\r\nof specific distinction.[1679] As for animals, Professor Vogt asserts\r\nthat, in the opinion of experienced breeders, certain races can with\r\ndifficulty be made to pair, and the fertility of the mongrels soon\r\ndiminishes, whilst other races pair readily and are prolific.[1680]\r\nSir J. Sebright says, “Although I believe the occasional intermixture\r\nof different families to be necessary, I do not, by any means, approve\r\nof mixing two distinct breeds, with the view of uniting the valuable\r\nproperties of both: this experiment has been frequently tried by others\r\nas well as by myself, but has, I believe, never succeeded. The first\r\ncross frequently produces a tolerable animal, but it is a breed that\r\ncannot be continued.”[1681]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nPROHIBITION OF MARRIAGE BETWEEN KINDRED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe horror of incest is an almost universal characteristic of mankind,\r\nthe cases which seem to indicate a perfect absence of this feeling\r\nbeing so exceedingly rare that they must be regarded merely as\r\nanomalous aberrations from a general rule.\r\n\r\nYet the degrees of kinship within which intercourse is forbidden, are\r\nby no means everywhere the same. It is most, and almost universally,\r\nabominated between parents and children, especially mother and\r\nson. As an exception to this rule, v. Langsdorf states that, among\r\nthe Kaniagmuts, not only do brothers and sisters cohabit with each\r\nother, but even parents and children.[1682] The Eastern Tinneh, or\r\nChippewyans, occasionally marry their mothers, sisters, or daughters,\r\nbut such alliances are not considered correct by general opinion.[1683]\r\nIn the Indian Archipelago, according to Schwaner, Wilken, and Riedel,\r\nmarriages between brothers and sisters, and parents and children,\r\nare permitted among certain tribes;[1684] and similar unions, it is\r\nsaid, took place among the ancient Persians.[1685] Again, in Nukahiva,\r\nas we are told by Lisiansky, although near kinsfolk are forbidden to\r\nintermarry, it sometimes happens that a father lives with his daughter,\r\nand a brother with his sister; but on one occasion it was looked\r\nupon as a horrible crime when a mother cohabited with her son.[1686]\r\nAmong the Kukis, as described by Rennel, marriages were generally\r\ncontracted without regard to blood-relationship; only a mother might\r\nnot wed her child.[1687] Among the Karens of Tenasserim, “matrimonial\r\nalliances between brother and sister, or father and daughter, are not\r\nuncommon.”[1688] Speaking of the King of the Warua, Mr. Cameron states\r\nthat in his harem are to be found his stepmothers, aunts, sisters,\r\nnieces, cousins, as also his own daughters.[1689] Among the Wanyoro,\r\nbrothers may marry their sisters, and even fathers their daughters; but\r\na son does not marry his own mother, although the other widows of his\r\nfather become his property.[1690]\r\n\r\nUnions between brothers and sisters, who are children of the same\r\nmother as well as the same father, are likewise held in general\r\nabhorrence. The primitive feeling against such connections is strongly\r\nexpressed in the Finnish Kullervo Myth. The unfortunate Kullervo, after\r\ndiscovering that he had committed incest with his sister, wails—\r\n\r\n    “Woe is me, my life hard-fated!\r\n    I have slain my virgin-sister,\r\n    Shamed the daughter of my mother;\r\n    Woe to thee my ancient father!\r\n    Woe to thee, my gray-haired mother!\r\n    Wherefore was I born and nurtured,\r\n    Why this hapless child’s existence?”[1691]\r\n\r\nThe dishonoured sister threw herself into the river, and Kullervo fell\r\nby his own sword.\r\n\r\nThe Californian Nishinam believe that, for the prevention of incest,\r\nat the beginning of the world, not one but two pairs were created from\r\nwhom sprang all the Nishinam.[1692] When the missionary Jellinghaus\r\nonce asked some Munda Kols whether animals knew what is right and\r\nwrong, the answer was, “No, because they do not know mother, sister,\r\nand daughter.”[1693] Yet, as we have seen, there are exceptions to the\r\nrule; and certain peoples who consider intercourse between parents and\r\nchildren incestuous, allow unions between brothers and sisters. Among\r\nthe Kamchadales, says Krasheninnikoff, “marriage is forbidden only\r\nbetween father and daughter, mother and son.”[1694] Not long ago, the\r\nwild Veddahs of Ceylon regarded the marriage of a man with his younger\r\nsister as not only proper and natural, but, in fact, as _the_ proper\r\nmarriage, though marriage with an elder sister or aunt would have been\r\nas incestuous and revolting to them as to us.[1695] Among the Annamese,\r\naccording to a missionary who has lived among them for forty years,\r\nno girl who is twelve years old and has a brother is a virgin.[1696]\r\nLiebich tells us that the Gypsies allow a brother to marry his sister,\r\nthough such marriages are generally avoided by them.[1697] Among the\r\nWa-taïta, says Mr. Thomson, “very few of the young men are able to\r\nmarry for want of the proper number of cows—a state of affairs which\r\nnot unfrequently leads to marriage with sisters, though this practice\r\nis highly reprobated.”[1698] Among the aborigines of Brazil, union with\r\na sister, or a brother’s daughter, is almost universally held to be\r\ninfamous. Such practices are not uncommon in small isolated hordes;\r\n“but the ancient Tupinambases (ancestors of the Tupis) allowed\r\nnothing of the kind openly.”[1699] In a song of the ‘Rig-Veda,’ Yamí\r\nappears in support of the marriage of brother and sister, while the\r\nopposition is personified in Yama.[1700] Buddhist legends mention\r\nvarious cases of such unions;[1701] and it is stated in the ‘Ynglinga\r\nSaga’ that “while Niord was with the Vans he had taken his own sister\r\nin marriage, for that he was allowed by their law.”[1702] But we have\r\nno evidence whatever that such unions were commonly allowed by the\r\nancient Scandinavians. “Among the Asas,” the ‘Ynglinga Saga’ adds,\r\n“it was forbidden for such near relatives to come together.”[1703] In\r\nScandinavia, according to Nordström, as also among the ancient Germans,\r\naccording to Grimm, marriages between parents and children, brothers\r\nand sisters, were prohibited.[1704]\r\n\r\nUnions with sisters, or probably, in most cases, half-sisters, occur\r\nin the royal families of Baghirmi,[1705] Siam,[1706] Burma,[1707]\r\nCeylon,[1708] and Polynesia.[1709] In the Sandwich Islands, brothers\r\nand sisters of the reigning family intermarried, but this incestuous\r\nintercourse was in other cases contrary to the customs, habits, and\r\nfeelings of the people.[1710] And, in Iboína of Madagascar, where the\r\nkings were occasionally united with their sisters, such marriages\r\nwere preceded by a ceremony in which the woman was sprinkled with\r\nconsecrated water, and prayers were recited asking for her happiness\r\nand fecundity, as if there was a fear that the union might call down\r\ndivine anger upon the parties.[1711] Cambyses and other Persian kings\r\nmarried their sisters,[1712] and so did the Ptolemies of Egypt.[1713]\r\nAccording to Sir Gardner Wilkinson, it is not only noticed by Diodorus,\r\nbut is fully authenticated by the inscriptions both of Upper and Lower\r\nEgypt, that the same custom was in force among the Egyptians, from the\r\nearliest times;[1714] but, except in the case of the Ptolemies, I have\r\nseen no clear evidence that marriage took place between brothers and\r\nsisters who had both the same father and the same mother. Garcilasso de\r\nla Vega states that the Incas of Peru, from the first, established it\r\nas a very stringent law that the heir to the kingdom should marry his\r\neldest sister, legitimate both on the side of the father and on that of\r\nthe mother;[1715] whereas, according to Acosta and Ondegardo, it had\r\nalways been held unlawful by the Peruvians to contract marriage in the\r\nfirst degree, until Tupac Inca Yupanqui, at the close of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, married his sister on the fathers side, and decreed “that\r\nthe Incas might marry with their sisters by the father’s side, and no\r\nother.”[1716]\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted that, where the system of exogamy prevails, a\r\nman is allowed to marry his sister either on the father’s or on the\r\nmother’s side, according as descent is reckoned in the female or in\r\nthe male line.[1717] But it will be shown directly that, besides the\r\nrules relating to exogamy, there are commonly others prohibiting\r\nintermarriage of near relations belonging to different tribes or clans.\r\nYet the marriage of half-brother and half-sister is not rare. Among the\r\nOstyaks, for instance, union with a half-sister bearing another family\r\nname is in great repute;[1718] and the South Slavonian Mohammedans\r\nallow marriages between half-brothers and half-sisters who have\r\ndifferent mothers, though seducing a sister is regarded in their songs\r\nas a crime punishable with death, or rather as something which cannot\r\noccur.[1719] From the Book of Genesis we know that Abraham married\r\nhis half-sister, and looked upon the union as lawful, because she had\r\nnot the same mother.[1720] Among the Phœnicians at Tyre, down to the\r\ntime of Achilles Tatius, a man might marry his father’s daughter: and\r\nthe same thing appears at Mecca.[1721] Marriage with half-sisters on\r\nthe father’s side, not on the mother’s, was also allowed among the\r\nAssyrians[1722] and the Athenians.[1723] In Guatemala and Yucatan,\r\non the other hand, no relationship on the mother’s side was a bar to\r\nmarriage: hence a man could marry his sister, provided she was by\r\nanother father.[1724]\r\n\r\nAmong certain peoples the relationships of uncle and niece, and of\r\naunt and nephew, are the remotest degrees of consanguinity which are a\r\nhindrance to intermarriage. This is the case, for instance, with some\r\nof the Dyak tribes;[1725] and among the Copper Indians, according to\r\nFranklin, there is no prohibition of the intermarriage of cousins,\r\nbut a man is forbidden to marry his niece.[1726] On the whole, we may\r\nsay that marriage within these degrees of relationship is even more\r\ncommonly prohibited than intermarriage of cousins, and that, probably\r\nin most cases, the prohibitions refer to persons so related either on\r\nthe father’s or mother’s side.[1727] Yet there are many instances to\r\nthe contrary.[1728] The Ossetes consider a marriage with a mother’s\r\nsister quite a proper thing, though a marriage with a father’s sister\r\nwould be punished as highly incestuous.[1729] Among the Reddies of the\r\nSouth of India, a man marries his sister’s daughter, but a nephew must\r\nnot marry his aunt;[1730] and, among the Brazilian Tupis, an uncle had\r\neven a right to his niece’s hand.[1731] By the Prussian law, marriage\r\nbetween uncle and niece is permitted; whilst, in France, such marriages\r\nmay be sanctioned by the Government, in Italy by the King.[1732]\r\n\r\nIn Europe, first cousins are not restricted from intermarriage,\r\nexcept in Spain, where the old canonical prohibitions are still in\r\nforce; and in Russia, where third cousins are allowed to marry, but\r\nno parties more nearly related.[1733] Among the Mohammedans[1734] and\r\nseveral uncivilized peoples, marriages between cousins, both on the\r\npaternal and maternal side, are permitted. So, apparently, among the\r\nAleuts,[1735] Eskimo at Igloolik,[1736] Apalachites,[1737] Maoris,\r\nBushmans[1738] and Ainos,[1739]—besides the people just referred to.\r\nMore commonly, however, the permission is one-sided, referring either\r\nto the kinsfolk on the father’s, or to those on the mother’s side.\r\nAmong the Arabs, a man has even a right to the hand of his paternal\r\ncousin, who cannot without his consent, become the wife of any other\r\nperson.[1740] Concerning the Moors of Ceylon, Mr. Ahamadu Bawa states\r\nthat in all cases where eligible sons of mothers’ brothers or fathers’\r\nsisters were available for the girls, preference was accorded to them,\r\n“almost as a matter of right.”[1741] Among the savage Miao of China,\r\nthe girls are obliged to marry the mother’s brothers’ sons.[1742] The\r\nGonds consider it correct for the brother’s daughter to marry the\r\nsister’s son, whilst not so much stress is laid on the marriage of the\r\ncousins, if the sister’s child happens to be a girl and the brother’s\r\na boy.[1743] Among the Yerkalas of Southern India, “the first two\r\ndaughters of a family may be claimed by the maternal uncle as wives for\r\nhis sons.”[1744]\r\n\r\nAs a rule, among peoples unaffected by modern civilization the\r\nprohibited degrees are more numerous than in advanced communities, the\r\nprohibitions in a great many cases referring even to all the members of\r\nthe tribe or clan.\r\n\r\nThe Greenlanders, according to Egede, refrained from marrying their\r\nnearest kin, even in the third degree, considering such matches to be\r\n“unwarrantable and quite unnatural;”[1745] whilst Dr. Rink asserts\r\nthat “the Eskimo disapproves of marriages between cousins.”[1746]\r\nThe same is the case with the Ingaliks,[1747] the Chippewas,[1748]\r\nand, as a rule, the Indians of Oregon.[1749] The Californian Gualala\r\naccount it “poison,” as they say, for a person to marry a cousin or\r\nan avuncular relation, and strictly observe in marriage the Mosaic\r\ntable of prohibited affinities.[1750] “By the old custom of the Aht\r\ntribes,” Mr. Sproat remarks, “no marriage was permitted within the\r\ndegree of second cousin;”[1751] and among the Mahlemuts, “cousins,\r\nhowever remote, do not marry.”[1752] Commonly a man and woman belonging\r\nto the same clan are prohibited from intermarrying. The Algonquins tell\r\nof cases where men, for breaking this rule, have been put to death by\r\ntheir nearest kinsfolk;[1753] and, among the Loucheux Indians, if a man\r\nmarries within the clan, he is said to have married his sister, though\r\nthere be not the slightest connection by blood between the two.[1754]\r\nIn some tribes, as Mr. Frazer points out, the marriage prohibition only\r\nextends to a man’s own clan: he may marry a woman of any clan but his\r\nown. But oftener the prohibition includes several clans, in none of\r\nwhich is a man allowed to marry.[1755] Thus, for instance, the Seneca\r\ntribe of the Iroquois was divided into two “phratries,” or divisions\r\nintermediate between the tribe and the clan, each including four clans;\r\nthe Bear, Wolf, Beaver, and Turtle clans forming one phratry, and\r\nthe Deer, Snipe, Heron, and Hawk clans forming the other. Originally\r\nmarriage was prohibited within the phratry, but was permitted with any\r\nof the clans of the other phratry; but the prohibition was long since\r\nremoved, and a Seneca may marry a woman of any clan but his own.[1756]\r\nA like exogamous division existed among the other four tribes of the\r\nIroquois,[1757] as also among the Creeks, Moquis, Choctaws, Chickasaws,\r\nThlinkets, &c.[1758]\r\n\r\nAmong the Pipiles of Salvador, an ancestral tree, with seven main\r\nbranches, denoting degrees of kindred, was painted upon cloth, and\r\nwithin these seven branches or degrees, no one was allowed to marry,\r\nexcept as a recompense for some great public or warlike service\r\nrendered. But within four degrees of consanguinity none, under any\r\npretext, might marry.[1759] In Yucatan, there was a strong prejudice\r\nagainst a man wedding a woman who bore the same name as his own, and\r\nso far was this fancy carried, that he who broke the rule was looked\r\nupon as a renegade and an outcast. Nor could a man marry his mother’s\r\nsister.[1760] Among the Azteks, too, marriages between blood-relations\r\nor those descended from a common ancestor were not allowed.[1761]\r\n\r\nAmong the tribes of Guiana, according to Mr. Im Thurn, marriage is now\r\nalmost always, as formerly it was always, contracted between members\r\nof different families, and, descent being traced through females, no\r\nintermarriage with relations on the mother’s side is permitted.[1762]\r\nThe Mundrucûs are divided into clans, the members of which are strictly\r\nprohibited from forming alliances with others of the same clan. “A\r\nMundrucû Indian,” says Professor Agassiz, “treats a woman of the same\r\norder (clan) with himself as a sister, any nearer relation between them\r\nis impossible.”[1763] The Indians of Peru are restricted from marriage\r\nwithin the first four degrees.[1764] The Guaranies and Abipones abhor\r\nalliances with even the remotest relations.[1765] And as to the Yahgans\r\nof Tierra del Fuego, Mr. Bridges writes to me that “no marriage, no\r\nintercourse ever takes place among blood-relations even to second\r\ncousins.” Such intercourse is held in utter abomination and is never\r\nheard of. Also between half-brothers and half-sisters marriages do not\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nNowhere is marriage bound by more severe laws than among the Australian\r\naborigines. Their tribes are, as a rule—and probably as a rule without\r\nexceptions[1766]—grouped in exogamous subdivisions, the number of which\r\nvaries considerably. There are tribes in which members of any clan\r\nare free to marry members of any clan but their own; but such tribes\r\nare exceptional.[1767] “Often,” says Mr. Frazer, “an Australian\r\ntribe is divided into two (exogamous) phratries, each of which\r\nincludes under it a number of totem clans; and oftener still there\r\nare sub-phratries interposed between the phratry and the clans, each\r\nphratry including two sub-phratries, and the sub-phratries including\r\ntotem clans.”[1768] Most of Mr. Curr’s very numerous correspondents\r\nwho have touched on this question have, however, given the number of\r\nsubdivisions in their neighbourhood as four only.[1769] Before the\r\noccupation of the country by the whites, which quickly breaks down\r\naboriginal customs, any departure from the marriage system founded on\r\nthis division was looked on with absolute horror, and even spoken of\r\nwith reluctance. Indeed, when marriage or sexual intercourse with a\r\nperson of a forbidden clan did occur, the regular penalty inflicted\r\non the parties implicated was death.[1770] And it is a noteworthy\r\nfact, generally overlooked by anthropologists, that besides these\r\nprohibitions arising from the clan-system and, naturally, applying only\r\nto the father’s or, more generally, only to the mother’s relations,\r\nthere is, as it seems everywhere, a law which forbids the marriage of\r\npersons near of kin.[1771] “A man,” says Mr. Curr, “may not marry\r\nhis mother, sister, half-sister, daughter, granddaughter, aunt, niece,\r\nfirst or second cousin.”[1772] Among the Kurnai of Gippsland, according\r\nto Mr. Bulmer, even third cousins are within the prohibited degrees\r\nof relationship.[1773] Moreover, certain tribes, besides having the\r\nclan-system, are entirely exogamous;[1774] and, among the tribes of\r\nWestern Victoria described by Mr. Dawson, the laws also forbid a man to\r\nmarry into his mother’s tribe, or his grandmother’s tribe or into an\r\nadjoining tribe, or one that speaks his own dialect.[1775]\r\n\r\nIn Tasmania, a man was not permitted to marry a woman of his own tribe\r\n(clan?);[1776] and in Polynesia, marriages with blood-relations were\r\neverywhere avoided except in royal families.[1777] Thus in Samoa,\r\naccording to Mr. Turner, so much care was taken to prevent incest\r\nthat a list of what they deemed improper marriages would almost\r\ncompare with the ‘Table of Kindred and Affinity.’ They say that,\r\nof old, custom and the gods frowned upon the union of those in whom\r\nconsanguinity could be closely traced.[1778]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the aborigines of the Melanesian islands, Dr. Codrington\r\nobserves, “In the native view of mankind, almost everywhere in\r\nthe islands which are here under consideration, nothing seems more\r\nfundamental than the division of the people into two or more classes,\r\nwhich are exogamous, and in which descent is counted through the\r\nmother.” Yet “the blood connection with the father and the father’s\r\nnear relations is never out of sight. Consequently the marriage of\r\nthose who are near in blood, though they are not ‘sogoi’ (_i.e._,\r\nkindred), and may lawfully marry, is discountenanced.”[1779] In\r\nNew Britain, if a man were accused of adultery or fornication with\r\na woman, he would at once be acquitted by the public voice if he\r\ncould say, “She is one of us,” _i.e._, she belongs to my totem,\r\nwhich in itself precludes the possibility of any sexual intercourse\r\nbetween us.[1780] In Efate, of the New Hebrides, it would be a crime\r\npunishable with death for a man or woman to marry a person belonging\r\nto his or her mother’s clan, “though they may have no recent relation\r\nof consanguinity to each other, and though neither they nor their\r\nparents may have even seen each other before.”[1781] In Lifu, as I am\r\ninformed by Mr. Radfield, who is a resident of this island, marriages\r\nare forbidden between first, but not second cousins, both on the\r\nmother’s and father’s side, as well as between uncles and nieces,\r\naunts and nephews. Matrimonial alliances between first cousins are\r\nalso prohibited in the Caroline Islands;[1782] whilst, in the Pelew\r\nGroup, intermarriage between any relations on the mother’s side is\r\nunlawful.[1783]\r\n\r\nAmong the Sea Dyaks, it is contrary to custom for a man to wed a first\r\ncousin, who is looked upon as a sister, and no marriage is allowed with\r\naunt or niece. The Land Dyaks permit marriage between second cousins\r\nonly after the payment of a fine of two jars, one being given by the\r\nwoman to the relations of her lover, the other by the lover to her\r\nrelation.[1784] In other tribes of the Malay Archipelago, according\r\nto Mr. Crawfurd, the union of near relatives is prohibited by the\r\nnative laws, and, when such a marriage does take place, the parties are\r\nfined if within the third degree of consanguinity collaterally. In the\r\nascending and descending line marriage is strictly forbidden.[1785]\r\nAmong the Minahassers of Celebes, marriage was not permitted between\r\nascendants and descendants, brothers and sisters, uncles and nieces,\r\naunts and nephews, and cousins, or between kinsfolk connected by\r\ncombinations of these relationships.[1786] The Malays of the uplands\r\nof Padang are forbidden to marry within the mother’s tribe; the Bataks\r\nof Sumatra, Alfura of Ceram and Buru, Niasians, and Timorese, within\r\nthe father’s.[1787] Among the Italones of the Philippines, marriage\r\nbetween blood-relations is not allowed.[1788] The Bugis[1789] and\r\nWatubela Islanders[1790] prohibit the intermarriage of cousins,\r\npaternal and maternal; whilst, among the Orang-Banûwa of Malacca,[1791]\r\nthe Macassars,[1792] and the natives of Aru, near New Guinea,[1793]\r\nchildren of brothers cannot intermarry, though children of sisters,\r\nor of brothers and sisters, can. Again, among the Lettis of the\r\nSerwatty Islands, marriage may take place between brothers’ children,\r\nand between brothers’ and sisters’ children, but not between children\r\nof two sisters;[1794] and, among the Bataks, Rejangs, and natives of\r\nAmboina, a sister’s son is allowed to marry a brother’s daughter,\r\nwhereas a brother’s son must not marry a sister’s daughter.[1795]\r\nThe penalty inflicted on incest is generally very severe in the\r\nArchipelago. Submersion is a common punishment;[1796] and, among the\r\nBataka, the parties were killed and eaten.[1797]\r\n\r\nWith reference to the Karens of Burma, Dr. Bunker informs me that,\r\nthough they never marry outside their own tribe, they avoid marrying\r\nwith near relations, their prohibited degrees being nearly the same\r\nas those of the ancient Hebrews. Among the Kukis, according to\r\nLieutenant Stewart, “the most strict rules exist forbidding too close\r\nintermarriage in families; cousins cannot be so allied.”[1798] The\r\nNagas never permit marriage within the same family;[1799] and, among\r\nthe Chukmas, if near relatives, within certain prohibited degrees, fall\r\nin love with each other, it is usual for both of them to pay a fine of\r\nfifty rupees, corporal punishment being also administered.[1800] Among\r\nthe Kandhs, “intermarriage between persons of the same tribe, however\r\nlarge or scattered, is considered incestuous and punishable with\r\ndeath.”[1801] The Santals make it a rule not to intermarry into the\r\nsame tribe;[1802] and, among the Sakais, a man goes to a considerable\r\ndistance for a wife, generally to a tribe speaking quite a different\r\ndialect.[1803] The Juángs, Hos, Mundas, and other peoples in India are\r\ndivided into clans, and a man is not allowed to marry a girl of his own\r\nclan.[1804] Among the Garos, no one may take to wife a woman of the\r\nsame “mahári,” or motherhood.[1805]\r\n\r\nAccording to Lieutenant-Colonel Tod, no Rajput can marry in his own\r\nclan.[1806] “In all pure Hindu society,” Sir Alfred Lyall states,\r\n“the law which regulates the degrees within which marriage is\r\ninterdicted, proceeds upon the theory that between agnatic relatives\r\n_connubium_ is impossible.”[1807] Hence it is unlawful for a Brahman\r\nto wed a woman whose clan-name is the same as his own, a prohibition\r\nwhich bars marriage among relatives in the male line indefinitely.\r\nBut besides this, connections on the female side are also forbidden\r\nto take place within certain wide limits.[1808] In the ‘Laws of\r\nManu’ we read that a damsel “who is neither a Sapindâ[1809] on the\r\nmother’s side, nor belongs to the same family on the father’s side, is\r\nrecommended to twice-born men for wedlock and conjugal union.”[1810]\r\nYet in the older literature marriage with the daughters of the mother’s\r\nbrother, and sons of the father’s sister, is permitted.[1811] This\r\nstill holds good among the Reddies of Southern India, and, as it seems,\r\namong other tribes belonging to the Hindu stock; whereas children\r\nof fathers’ brothers and mothers’ sisters are considered equal to\r\nbrothers and sisters, and marriage with them is looked upon as highly\r\nincestuous.[1812]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Andamanese, Mr. Man says that “their customs do not\r\npermit of the union of any who are known to be even distantly related;\r\nthe fact of our allowing first cousins to marry seems to them highly\r\nobjectionable and immoral.”[1813] The Sinhalese consider a marriage\r\nbetween the father’s sister’s son and the mother’s brother’s daughter\r\nthe most proper that they can contract; but they would regard a\r\nmarriage with the father’s brother’s daughter as incestuous, first\r\ncousins so related being considered sisters.[1814]\r\n\r\nAs regards the prohibited degrees of the Chinese Penal Code, a very\r\nminute account is given by Mr. Medhurst in his interesting paper on\r\n‘Marriage, Affinity, and Inheritance in China.’[1815] Large bodies\r\nof persons in that country bear the same surname; among the entire\r\nChinese population of the Empire, indeed, there are hardly more\r\nthan 530 surnames. A penalty of sixty blows is inflicted on any one\r\nwho marries a person with the same surname.[1816] The punishment\r\nattached to the intermarriage of nearer relations on the father’s\r\nside is much more severe. Thus, marriage or incestuous intercourse\r\nwith a grand-uncle, a father’s first cousin, a brother, or a nephew,\r\nis punishable by death.[1817] Besides these prohibitions there are\r\nothers applying within a narrower range to relatives on the female\r\nside. A man who marries his mother’s sister or his sister’s daughter\r\nis strangled. Less severe punishment is inflicted on a person who\r\nmarries a uterine half-sister, and still less severe—eighty blows—on\r\nany one who marries his father’s sister’s daughter, mother’s brother’s\r\ndaughter, or mother’s sister’s daughter. An after-clause abrogates this\r\nprohibition, and permits intermarriage between children of brothers and\r\nsisters, or of sisters, but intermarriage between those of brothers\r\nis of course inadmissible.[1818] The Chinese Code also interdicts\r\noccasional intercourse with any of those relatives with whom marriage\r\nis prohibited, the punishment in both cases being the same.[1819]\r\n\r\nAmong the Kalmucks, no man can marry a relation on the father’s side;\r\nand so deeply rooted is this custom among them, that a Kalmuck proverb\r\nsays, “The great folk and dogs know no relationship,”—alluding to the\r\nfact that only a prince may marry a relative.[1820] The Yakuts,[1821]\r\nSamoyedes,[1822] Cheremises,[1823] &c., also avoid marriage within\r\nthe paternal clan, and the ancient Finns did not marry kinsfolk.[1824]\r\nAmong the Ostyaks[1825] and Ossetes,[1826] marriage with a person\r\nof one’s own family name, however distant the relationship, is\r\nentirely prohibited. And in Circassia, according to Bell, not only\r\nare cousins, or the members of the same fraternity restricted from\r\nintermarrying, but even their serfs must wed with the serfs of another\r\nfraternity.[1827]\r\n\r\nAmong the Bogos of Eastern Africa, persons related within the seventh\r\ndegree may not intermarry, whether the relationship be on the paternal\r\nor maternal side.[1828] Some of the clans of the Somals, as we are\r\ninformed by Sir R. F. Burton, refuse maidens of the same or even a\r\nconsanguineous family.[1829] In Western Equatorial Africa and Uganda,\r\nmarriages cannot take place within the clans, however remote the\r\nrelationship may be.[1830] Among the Mpongwé, “every care is taken to\r\navoid marriages of consanguinity.”[1831] With the Bateke, as Dr. Sims\r\nwrites from Stanley Pool, marriages are prohibited between brothers and\r\nsisters of the same mother or father; between first cousins; between\r\nuncle and niece, or aunt and nephew. The Bakongo also, according to Mr.\r\nIngham, hold all unions between near relatives, either on the father’s\r\nor mother’s side, in utter abomination.\r\n\r\nMr. Cousins, to whom I am indebted for a valuable paper on the\r\nCis-Natalian Kafirs, writes that, among them, marriages often take\r\nplace within the tribe and village. But this is avoided, if possible;\r\nlike their chiefs they generally endeavour to marry out of their own\r\ntribe. Among this people, however, there is some kind of class (clan?)\r\ndivision, which Mr. Cousins is not fully acquainted with, and members\r\nof the same class (clan?) do not seem to intermarry. At any rate, near\r\nrelations, paternal and maternal, avoid marriage with each other. No\r\npenalty is attached to such a marriage, but custom is so strong on\r\nthe point that the general rule is seldom broken.[1832] According to\r\nMr. Shooter[1833] and Mr. Dugmore,[1834] a marriage is considered\r\nincestuous if the man and woman are of any known or remembered degree\r\nof relationship by common descent; and, if a man were to take a wife\r\nwithin the degrees prohibited by custom, he would be denounced as an\r\n“evildoer.”[1835] According to Mr. Brownlee, intercourse in such cases\r\nis punished, whether it be by marriage or without marriage.[1836]\r\nAgain, with regard to the Zulus, Mr. Eyles states that there is no\r\nintermarriage between the inhabitants of the village, the members of\r\nwhich are, as a rule, related. All intermarrying with relations is\r\nprohibited by custom, and such a thing is neither heard of nor thought\r\nof. Even if the relationship is only traditional, the custom holds good.\r\n\r\nA somewhat different account of the Bantu race is given by Mr.\r\nMcCall Theal. “A native of the coast region,” he says, “will not\r\nmarry a girl whose relationship by blood to himself can be traced,\r\nno matter how distantly connected they may be. So scrupulous is he\r\nin this respect that he will not marry even a girl who belongs to\r\nanother tribe, if she has the same family name as himself, though the\r\nrelationship cannot be traced. He regards himself as the protector of\r\nthose females whom he would term his cousins and second cousins, but\r\nfor whom he has only the same name as for the daughters of his own\r\nparents, the endearing name of sister. In his opinion, union with one\r\nof them would be incestuous, something horrible, something unutterably\r\ndisgraceful. The native of the mountains, almost as a rule, marries the\r\ndaughter of his father’s brother.”[1837]\r\n\r\nMr. Conder states that, among the Bechuanas, marrying out of their own\r\ntribe seems to be the common practice;[1838] whereas, according to Mr.\r\nCasalis, the Basutos frequently marry cousins. Yet, among them also,\r\nthere are some tribes who consider such marriages incestuous.[1839]\r\nThe Hottentots are said by Kolben to punish alliances between first\r\nand second cousins with death.[1840] In Madagascar, though marriage\r\nbetween brothers’ children is looked upon as the most proper kind\r\nof connection, and brothers’ and sisters’ children can marry on the\r\nperformance of a slight but prescribed ceremony, supposed to remove\r\nany impediment or disqualification arising out of consanguinity, the\r\ndescendants of sisters are not allowed to intermarry down to the fifth\r\nor seventh generation, and a marriage of sisters’ children, when the\r\nsisters have the same mother, is regarded with horror.[1841]\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans, alliances between persons under the same _patria\r\npotestas_—_i.e._, _cognati_ related within the sixth degree—were\r\n_nefariæ et incestuæ nuptiæ_; but these prohibitions were gradually\r\nrelaxed. From the time of the Second Punic War, according to Livy,\r\neven first cousins were allowed to intermarry; and in 49 A.D. the\r\nEmperor Claudius, wishing to marry his niece Agrippina, obtained from\r\nthe Senate a decree that marriage with a brother’s daughter should be\r\nlegal, though marriage with a sister’s daughter remained illegal.[1842]\r\nIn the fourth century, however, Constantius again forbade such unions,\r\non pain of death.[1843] Afterwards, under the influence of the ascetic\r\nideas prevalent in the Church, the prohibited degrees were gradually\r\nextended. Theodosius the Great forbade under the severest penalties the\r\nunion of first cousins, paternal and maternal; and at the end of the\r\nsixth century the prohibition was extended even to the seventh degree.\r\nThis prohibition continued in force until in the Western Church it was\r\nonce more reduced to the fourth degree by the Lateran Council under\r\nInnocent III. in the year 1215; that is, marriage was permitted beyond\r\nthe degree of third cousins.[1844] Such is the nominal law at the\r\npresent time wherever the canon law prevails.[1845]\r\n\r\nBesides the prohibitions relating to actual kinship, there are, among\r\nseveral peoples, others applying to marriage between relatives by\r\nalliance. Among the Andamanese, a man or woman may not marry into\r\nthe family of a brother-in-law or sister-in-law.[1846] The Eastern\r\nGreenlanders and the Eskimo of the north-east coast of America forbid\r\nor disapprove of marriage with two sisters;[1847] and, according to\r\nDr. Daniell, the same rule prevails among the natives of Accra at\r\nthe Gold Coast, who even prohibit a man from marrying two cousins of\r\nthe same parentage.[1848] Again, several tribes in Western Victoria\r\ndo not permit marriage with a deceased wife’s daughter by a former\r\nhusband.[1849] But prohibitions of this sort do not seem to be very\r\ncommon among savage and barbarous races. In many of the Indian tribes\r\nof North America, all the daughters of a family are, as a rule, married\r\nto the same man. A brother very frequently marries his deceased\r\nbrother’s widow; and, in Africa, a son often weds all his father’s\r\nwidows except his own mother.\r\n\r\nAmong civilized peoples, on the other hand, relations by affinity\r\nare frequently regarded in the same light as relations by blood. In\r\nYucatan, a man was not allowed to marry his sister-in-law.[1850]\r\nAccording to the Chinese Code, marriage with a deceased brother’s\r\nwidow is punished with strangulation, whilst marriage with a deceased\r\nwife’s sister is exceedingly common, and has always been regarded\r\nas particularly honourable.[1851] In Japan, intercourse with a\r\nfather’s or a grandfather’s concubine, or a son’s or grandson’s wife,\r\ninvolves the same punishment as intercourse with a paternal aunt or\r\na sister.[1852] The ‘Institutes of Vishnu’ declare that “sexual\r\nconnection with one’s mother, or daughter, or daughter-in-law, are\r\ncrimes in the highest degree,” there being no other way to atone for\r\nthese crimes than to proceed into the flames.[1853] According to the\r\nlaws of Moses[1854] and Mohammed[1855] and the Roman Law[1856] marriage\r\nwas prohibited with mother-in-law, step-mother, daughter-in-law,\r\nand step-daughter—according to Mohammed, however, so far as the\r\nstep-daughter was concerned, only if she were under the guardianship of\r\nher mother’s husband. Moses also forbade marriage with the sister of\r\na wife who was still living,[1857] and with a brother’s wife, if she\r\nwere widowed and had children by the brother; and Mohammed prohibited\r\nmarriage with two sisters at the same time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom very early times thinkers have tried to account for the\r\nprohibition of marriage between near kin. Some, says Mr. Huth, ascribe\r\nthem to a fear lest relationship may become too involved; others to a\r\nfear lest affection may become concentrated within too narrow a circle;\r\nbecause marriage would take place too early; because people would be\r\ninduced to marry each other in order that property might be kept in the\r\nfamily; because such marriages are prohibited by “God’s law”; because\r\nthey outrage “natural modesty”; and, only in modern times, because\r\nthey are supposed to prove injurious to the offspring.[1858]\r\n\r\nComparative ethnography has changed the aspect of the question. The\r\nhorror of incest has been found to prevail among peoples who neither\r\nknow anything of “God’s law,” nor possess property to keep in the\r\nfamily. New hypotheses have therefore been suggested more worthy of\r\nconsideration, as being founded on a much firmer basis of facts.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. McLennan was the first to call attention to the general\r\nprevalence of the rule which forbids the members of a tribe (or clan)\r\nto intermarry with members of their own tribe (or clan). This rule\r\nhe called “exogamy,” in contradistinction to “endogamy,” or the\r\nrule which forbids the members of a tribe to intermarry with members\r\nof other tribes. In his celebrated essay on ‘Primitive Marriage’\r\nhe made an attempt to show that exogamy had arisen from female\r\ninfanticide, “common among savages everywhere.” He assumes that to\r\ntribes surrounded by enemies, and unaided by art, contending with the\r\ndifficulties of subsistence, sons were a source of strength, both for\r\ndefence and in the quest for food, whilst daughters were a source of\r\nweakness. Hence the cruel custom which left the primitive human hordes\r\nwith very few young women, thus seriously disturbing the balance of\r\nthe sexes within the hordes, and forcing them to prey upon one another\r\nfor wives. Usage, induced by necessity, would then in time establish\r\na prejudice among the tribes observing it—a prejudice strong as a\r\nprinciple of religion, as every prejudice relating to marriage is apt\r\nto be—against marrying women of their own tribe.[1859]\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert Spencer has subjected this hypothesis to a searching\r\ncriticism,[1860] and from an article in the ‘Fortnightly Review’ it\r\nappears as if Mr. McLennan himself had in the end some doubts as to its\r\ncorrectness.[1861] To Mr. Spencer’s objections others might be added.\r\n\r\nA minute investigation of the extent to which female infanticide is\r\npractised has convinced me that Mr. McLennan has much exaggerated the\r\nimportance of this custom. It certainly prevails in many parts of the\r\nworld; and it is true that, as a rule, female children are killed\r\nrather than male. But there is nothing to indicate that infanticide\r\nhas ever been so nearly universal, or has anywhere been practised on\r\nso large a scale as Mr. McLennan’s hypothesis presupposes. Among a\r\ngreat many existing savage peoples it is almost unheard of—as, for\r\ninstance, among the Tuski,[1862] Ahts,[1863] Western Eskimo,[1864]\r\nBotocudos,[1865] and in certain tribes of California.[1866] Among some\r\nof these peoples new-born children are killed now and then—in case\r\nof the birth of twins, if the children are weak and deformed, or for\r\nsome other reason—but always, it is said, without distinction of sex.\r\nAmong the Dacotahs and Crees, female infanticide is only occasionally\r\ncommitted.[1867] The Blackfeet, according to Richardson, believe that\r\nwomen who have been guilty of this crime will never reach the happy\r\nmountain after death, but are compelled to hover round the seats\r\nof their crimes, with branches of trees tied to their legs;[1868]\r\nand the Aleuts think that a child-murder brings misfortune on the\r\nwhole village.[1869] Among the Abipones, the women often practised\r\ninfanticide, but it was the boy who was generally thus sacrificed, for\r\nwhen a son grew up it was necessary to buy a wife for him, while a\r\ngrown-up daughter would always command her price.[1870]\r\n\r\nIn Africa I do not know of a single district where the people are in\r\nthe habit of destroying new-born children. Herr Valdau tells us of a\r\nBakundu woman who, accused of such a deed, was condemned to death.[1871]\r\n\r\nUntil the introduction of Christianity, the South Sea Islanders\r\npractised infanticide probably to a greater extent than any other\r\npeople with whose history we are acquainted. But as the motive was\r\noften want of food for the infant, or interference with the personal\r\ncharms of the wife, or the disagreeableness of baby life, boys as\r\nwell as girls were killed. Moreover, in Samoa, in the Mitchell’s and\r\nHervey Groups, and in part of New Guinea, infanticide was quite unheard\r\nof;[1872] whilst, in most of the islands belonging to the Solomon\r\nGroup, it occurs only in extreme cases, such as that of the child being\r\na bastard.[1873] In the Caroline Islands, according to Chamisso, “the\r\nprince would have the unnatural mother punished with death.”[1874]\r\nAnd even in Australia, where, according to Mr. Curr’s belief, the\r\nwomen reared as a rule, only two boys and one girl, the rest being\r\ndestroyed,[1875] there seem to be tribes in which the killing of\r\nchildren rarely happens.[1876]\r\n\r\nThere are other reasons, besides those just given, for doubting whether\r\ninfanticide can ever have been so common as Mr. McLennan suggests. It\r\nmay be assumed, as Mr. Darwin remarks, that during the earliest period\r\nof human development man did not partially lose one of the strongest of\r\ninstincts, common to all the lower animals, namely the love of their\r\nyoung, and consequently did not practise infanticide.[1877] Later\r\non, the women, far from being useless to the savage tribe, rendered\r\nvaluable services as food-providers. Mr. Fison, who has lived among\r\nuncivilized races for many years, thinks it will be found that female\r\ninfanticide is far less common among the lower savages than it is\r\namong the more advanced tribes.[1878] And, speaking of one of the\r\nvery rudest, the Yahgans of Tierra del Fuego, Mr. Bridges states that\r\nit occurred only occasionally among them, and then was almost always\r\nthe deed of the mother, who acted from “jealousy, or hatred of her\r\nhusband, or because of desertion and wretchedness.”[1879] Moreover, it\r\nis very generally asserted that certain Californians never committed\r\ninfanticide before the arrival of the whites;[1880] whilst Ellis thinks\r\nthat there is every reason to suppose that this custom was practised\r\nless extensively by the Polynesians during the early periods of their\r\nhistory than it was afterwards.[1881]\r\n\r\nBut even if Mr. McLennan were right in his assumption that savages\r\neverywhere used to kill female infants, this would not explain the\r\norigin of exogamy. “In time,” he says, “it came to be considered\r\nimproper, because it was unusual, for a man to marry a woman of his\r\nown group.”[1882] But why should such a marriage ever have become\r\nunusual? Why should the men have refrained from marrying those women\r\nof their own tribe who were not killed? Why should they have made\r\nthese beings whom they considered so useless, even more useless than\r\nthey naturally were, by preventing them from becoming mothers of sons\r\nwho would have increased the strength of the tribe? That the men may\r\nhave endeavoured to make up the deficiency of women by capturing wives\r\nfrom foreign tribes is conceivable enough; but it is hard to see why\r\nintercourse with women of their own tribe should on this account have\r\nbeen prohibited, sometimes even on pain of death.\r\n\r\nThat the horror of incest is innate in the human race seems as\r\nimprobable to Mr. Herbert Spencer as to Mr. McLennan. According to Mr.\r\nSpencer, this feeling is a result of evolution gradually acquired.\r\nPrimitive groups of men, he says, are habitually hostile. In all\r\ntimes and places victory is followed by pillage; whatever portable\r\nthings of worth the conquerors find they take. And of course they take\r\nwomen as they take other booty, because women are prized as wives, as\r\nconcubines, or as drudges. A captured woman, besides her intrinsic\r\nvalue, has an extrinsic value: “like a native wife she serves as a\r\nslave, but unlike a native wife, she serves also as a trophy.” Hence\r\nmembers of the tribe thus married to foreign women are held to be\r\nmore honourably married than those married to native women. If the\r\ntribe, becoming successful in war, robs adjacent tribes of their\r\nwomen more frequently, there will then grow up the idea that the now\r\nconsiderable class having foreign wives form the honourable class, and\r\nnon-possession of a foreign wife will come to be regarded as a proof of\r\ncowardice. “An increasing ambition to get foreign wives will therefore\r\narise; and as the number of those who are without them decreases, the\r\nbrand of disgrace attaching to them will grow more decided; until in\r\nthe most warlike tribes, it becomes an imperative requirement that a\r\nwife shall be obtained from another tribe—if not in open war, then by\r\nprivate abduction.”[1883]\r\n\r\nThis interpretation is open to an objection similar to that which\r\nmay be brought against Mr. McLennan’s hypothesis. Even if it became\r\ncustomary for a tribe to rob foreign tribes of their women, we have\r\nno reason to believe that it therefore became customary not to marry\r\nnative women. Plurality of wives is for savage man a source of wealth\r\nand reputation; even the wretched Fuegian endeavours to procure as\r\nmany as possible in order to obtain rowers for his canoe. Hence it\r\ncould scarcely be considered disgraceful to have some native wives\r\nbesides those of foreign birth. If Mr. Spencer’s explanation is the\r\ncorrect one, what a deplorable lot it must have been for a woman to\r\nbelong to a tribe always successful in war! She had of course to live\r\nunmarried till she was fortunate enough to fall into the hands of some\r\nhostile suitor. But this would seldom happen, if the adjacent weaker\r\ntribes were habitually worsted in war. In such tribes, according to\r\nMr. Spencer, “marrying within the tribe will not only be habitual,\r\nbut there will arise a prejudice, and eventually a law, against taking\r\nwives from other tribes.”[1884]\r\n\r\nLeast of all can Mr. Spencer’s hypothesis explain the origin of\r\nprohibitions of marriage between the nearest kin. It presupposes that\r\nthe tribe has been frequently successful in war during so long a period\r\nthat usage has had time to grow into law. But since such prohibitions\r\nare practically common to all mankind, they cannot have originated\r\nin the way suggested, because when there is a vanquisher there must\r\nalso be a vanquished. Moreover, it is impossible to suppose that that\r\npowerful feeling which restrains parents from marrying their children,\r\nbrothers from marrying their sisters, can have been due to man’s vain\r\ndesire to have a trophy in his wife.[1885]\r\n\r\nSir John Lubbock explains the origin of exogamy in a quite different\r\nway. Believing that in man’s primitive state all the men of a tribe\r\nwere married to all the women, and that no one could appropriate one of\r\nthem to himself without infringing on the general rights of the tribe,\r\nhe suggests that women taken in war from a foreign tribe were in a\r\ndifferent position. The tribe, as a tribe, had no right to these women,\r\nand they would become wives in our sense of the term.[1886]\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to say much about this hypothesis, as it stands or\r\nfalls with Sir J. Lubbock’s theory of “communal marriage.” Why should\r\nwomen taken in war have been the men’s personal property, if the women\r\nof the tribe were not so? As Mr. McLennan justly remarks, war-captives\r\nare usually obtained by group-acts, or quasi group-acts; hence capture\r\nwould be recognized as a regular mode of adding women to the group,\r\nsubject to the customary rights of its male members; and every man in\r\nthe group would claim the communal right to women taken by others.[1887]\r\n\r\nAgain, Professor Kohler has expressed his belief in the explanation\r\nthat exogamy was an early method of political self-preservation.[1888]\r\nThat intermarriage is valuable from a political point of view, and has\r\noften taken place in order to increase intertribal or international\r\nfriendship, is beyond doubt.[1889] But it is another question whether\r\nthe strictly prohibitive exogamous rules, the infringement of which\r\nis considered a most heinous crime, can be accounted for in this way.\r\nIt is worth noticing that not only marriage, but also less regular\r\nconnections between members of the same exogamous group are held in\r\nhorror. The Australians, for instance, consider cohabitation between\r\nindividuals belonging to clans that cannot intermarry not less\r\ncriminal than marriage, often punishing such unions with death.[1890]\r\nAmong the Melanesians, says Dr. Codrington, “intercourse within the\r\nlimit which restrains from marriage, where two members of the same\r\ndivision are concerned, is a crime, is incest.”[1891] Holm makes\r\na similar observation on the prohibited degrees among the Eastern\r\nGreenlanders.[1892] Speaking of the Samoans, Mr. Prichard remarks,\r\n“Of all their customs, the most strictly observed, perhaps, was that\r\nwhich forbade the remotest reference to anything, even by way of a\r\njoke, that conveyed the slightest indelicacy in thought or word or\r\ngesture, when brothers and sisters were together. In presence of his\r\nsister, the wildest rake was always modest and moral. In presence\r\nof her brother, the most accommodating _coquette_ was always chaste\r\nand reserved. This custom remains intact to the present day.”[1893]\r\nDr. Tylor remarks that anthropologists have long had before them the\r\nproblem of determining how far clan-exogamy may have been the origin\r\nof the prohibited degrees in matrimony.[1894] But we have seen that it\r\nis practically impossible to trace any distinct limit between these\r\ntwo sets of rules; hence they seem to be fundamentally identical—a\r\nconclusion in which most anthropologists agree. And the prohibitions\r\nof close intermarriage certainly cannot be explained as a “method of\r\npolitical self-preservation.”\r\n\r\nOther writers—and among them Mr. Morgan—have suggested that\r\nprohibitions of the marriage of near kin have arisen from observation\r\nof the injurious results of such unions.[1895] But most investigators\r\nwho have considered the subject believe that this knowledge could be\r\ngained only by lengthened observation, and, to quote Dr. Peschel, is\r\n“unattainable by unsettled and childishly heedless races,” among whom,\r\nnevertheless, a horror of incest is developed most strongly.[1896] Sir\r\nHenry Maine, on the other hand, thinks that the men who discovered\r\nthe use of fire and selected the wild forms of certain animals for\r\ndomestication and of vegetables for cultivation, might also have been\r\nable to find out that children of unsound constitution were born\r\nof nearly related parents.[1897] In the next chapter, I shall have\r\noccasion to mention some instances which possibly may point in this\r\ndirection, but in no case does such knowledge appear to be generally\r\ndiffused among backward races. Mr. Curr has been unable to discover on\r\nwhat ground consanguineous marriages are held to be objectionable by\r\nthe Australians, their replies to questions on this head invariably\r\nbeing, “Our tribe always did as we do in this matter.” Yet they are\r\nwell aware, he says, that the aim of the exogamous restrictions is\r\nto prevent the union of nearly related individuals.[1898] Dr. Sims\r\nwrites that no other reason for the avoidance of marriage between near\r\nrelations has been stated to him by the indigenous Bateke than that of\r\n“shame.” Mr. Bridges informs me that the Yahgans point simply to the\r\nfact of relationship as the reason; and, when Azara asked the Charruas\r\nwhy a brother and sister never intermarried, they replied that they\r\ndid not know why.[1899] It is conceivable that the experience of the\r\ninjurious results of such marriages, once acquired, might afterwards\r\nhave fallen into oblivion, although the prohibition continued to exist.\r\nBut Azara expressly states that the Charruas have no law forbidding\r\nincestuous alliances, yet he has never seen nor heard of any among them.\r\n\r\nWhatever observations may have been made, the prohibition of incest is\r\nin no case founded on experience. Had the savage man discerned that\r\nchildren born of marriage between closely related persons are not so\r\nsound and vigorous as others, he would scarcely have allowed this\r\nknowledge to check his passions. Considering how seldom a civilised\r\nman who has any disease, or tendency to disease, which is likely to be\r\ntransmitted to his descendants, hesitates to marry an equally unhealthy\r\nwoman, it would surely be unreasonable to suppose that savages have\r\ngreater forethought and self-command.[1900] But even if we admit\r\nthat man originally avoided marriage with near kin from sagacious\r\ncalculation, and that he did this during so long a period that usage\r\ngrew into law, we do not advance a step further. All the writers whose\r\nhypotheses have been considered in this chapter, assume that men avoid\r\nincestuous marriages only because they are _taught_ to do so. “It\r\nis probable,” says Mr. Huth, “that, if brothers and sisters were\r\nallowed to marry, they would do so while yet too young.”[1901] But\r\nthough law and custom may prevent passion from passing into action,\r\nthey cannot wholly destroy its inward power. Law may forbid a son to\r\nmarry his mother, a brother his sister, but it could not prevent him\r\nfrom desiring such a union if the desire were natural. Where does\r\nthat appetite exist? The home is kept pure from incestuous defilement\r\nneither by laws, nor by customs, nor by education, but by an _instinct_\r\nwhich under normal circumstances makes sexual love between the nearest\r\nkin a psychical impossibility. An unwritten law, says Plato, defends\r\n“as sufficiently as possible,” parents from incestuous intercourse\r\nwith their children, brothers from intercourse with their sisters:\r\n“ἀλλ’ οὐδ’ ἐπιθυμία ταύτης τῆς συνουσίας τὸ παρ ‘παν εἰσέρχεται τοὺς\r\nπολλοὺς”—“nor does even the desire for this intercourse come at all\r\nupon the masses.”[1902]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nPROHIBITION OF MARRIAGE BETWEEN KINDRED\r\n\r\n(_Concluded_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted that, if there be really an innate horror of\r\nincest, it ought to show itself intuitively when persons are ignorant\r\nof any relationship. But ancient writers state that, in Rome,\r\nincestuous unions often resulted from the exposure of infants who were\r\nreared by slave-dealers. Not long ago Selim Pasha unwittingly married\r\nhis sister, who, like himself, had been a Circassian slave. The story\r\ntold in the ‘Heptameron’ of a double incest was probably true, and\r\nbecame widely spread; and so on. Man has thus no horror of marriage\r\nwith even the nearest kindred if he is unaware of their consanguinity;\r\nconsequently, Mr. Huth concludes, there is no innate feeling against\r\nincest.[1903]\r\n\r\nOf course I agree with Mr. Huth in thinking that there is no innate\r\naversion to marriage with _near relations_. What I maintain is, that\r\nthere is an innate aversion to sexual intercourse between persons\r\nliving very closely together from early youth, and that, as such\r\npersons are in most cases related, this feeling displays itself chiefly\r\nas a horror of intercourse between near kin.\r\n\r\nThe existence of an innate aversion of this kind has been taken\r\nby various writers as a psychological fact proved by common\r\nexperience;[1904] and it seems impossible otherwise to explain the\r\nfeeling which makes the relationships between parents and children,\r\nand brothers and sisters, so free from all sexual excitement. But the\r\nchief evidence is afforded by an abundance of ethnographical facts\r\nwhich prove that it is not, in the first place, by the degrees of\r\nconsanguinity, but by the close living together that prohibitory laws\r\nagainst intermarriage are determined.\r\n\r\nEgede asserts that, among the Greenlanders, it would be reckoned\r\nuncouth and blamable, if a lad and a girl who had served and been\r\neducated in one family, desired to be married to one another;[1905]\r\nand, according to Dr. Nansen, it is preferred that the contracting\r\nparties should belong to different settlements.[1906] Colonel\r\nMacpherson states that, among the Kandhs, marriage cannot take place\r\neven with strangers who have been long adopted into, or domesticated\r\nwith, a tribe.[1907] And Mr. Cousins writes to me that the Cis-Natalian\r\nKafirs dislike marriage between persons who live very closely together,\r\nwhether related or not. In the Northern New Hebrides, a girl betrothed\r\nin childhood is sometimes taken to her future father-in-law’s house and\r\nbrought up there. Dr. Codrington says that “the boy often thinks she\r\nis his sister, and is much ashamed when he comes to know the relation\r\nin which he stands.”[1908]\r\n\r\nMany peoples have a rule of exogamy that does not depend on kinship\r\nat all. Piedrahita relates of the Panches of Bogota that the men and\r\nwomen of one town did not intermarry, as they held themselves to be\r\nbrothers and sisters, and the impediment of kinship was sacred to them;\r\nbut such was their ignorance that, if a sister were born in a different\r\ntown from her brother, he was not prevented from marrying her.[1909]\r\nThe Yaméos, on the river Amazons, will not suffer an intermarriage\r\nbetween members of the same community, “as being friends in blood,\r\nthough no real affinity between them can be proved.”[1910] The Uaupés,\r\naccording to Mr. Wallace, “do not often marry with relations, or\r\neven neighbours, preferring those from a distance, or even from\r\nother tribes.”[1911] The Australian tribe, as Mr. Howitt points out,\r\nis organized in two ways. On the one hand, it is divided socially\r\ninto phratries and clans; and, on the other hand, it is divided\r\ngeographically into hordes. The two organizations are co-existent, but\r\nthe divisions of the one do not correspond with those of the other.\r\nFor while all the people who belong to any given local group are found\r\nin one locality alone, those who belong to any given social group are\r\nto be found distributed among many, if not among all, of the local\r\ngroups. Now, in many tribes, local proximity by birth is quite an\r\ninsuperable obstacle to marriage, a man being absolutely forbidden to\r\nmarry, or have sexual intercourse with, a woman of the same horde or\r\nsub-horde. “However eligible she may be in other respects,” says Mr.\r\nHowitt, “the fact that both parties belong to the same locality is\r\nheld by certain tribes, the Kurnai, for example, to make them ‘too near\r\neach other.’” It is chiefly in tribes where the clan-system has been\r\nweakened, or has become almost extinct, that the local organization\r\nhas assumed such overwhelming preponderance, but even in some of\r\nthe tribes which have a vigorous clan-system, local restraints upon\r\nmarriage are strictly enforced.[1912] In Sumatra, according to Mr.\r\nForbes, the country was originally divided into native districts\r\ncalled “margas,” each marga, as a rule, having its several villages.\r\nEach of these village communities is a collection of families, either\r\nrelated or not to each other by the ties of blood;[1913] and we\r\nknow that, at least among certain tribes, marriage between members\r\nof the same village or village cluster, and in some districts even\r\nbetween those of the same marga, is prohibited.[1914] The Kotars of\r\nthe Neilgherries,[1915] Galela,[1916] Fijians,[1917] Zulus,[1918]\r\nWakamba,[1919] and Kamchadales[1920] avoid, as a rule, marriage with\r\nmembers of the same village. So also do the Nogai, who consider it most\r\nhonest for a man to marry a woman whom he has never seen before.[1921]\r\nIn various of the smaller islands belonging to the Indian Archipelago,\r\naccording to Riedel, women prefer marriage with strangers.[1922] The\r\nAssamese have a national festival named the “Baisakh Bihu,” which is\r\nas gay as a carnival, the women, and especially the maidens, enjoying\r\nunusual liberty as long as it lasts. “For many days before the actual\r\nfestival,” says Colonel Dalton, “the young people in the villages may\r\nbe seen moving about in groups gaily dressed or forming circles, in the\r\nmidst of which the prettiest girls dance with their long hair loose on\r\ntheir shoulders.” But on these occasions the girls “do not like to\r\ndance before the men of their own village.”[1923] Professor Kovalevsky\r\nobserves that, in some parts of Russia, the bride is always taken from\r\nanother village than the bridegroom’s; and, even in provinces in which\r\nno similar custom is known to exist, “the bridegroom is constantly\r\nspoken of as a foreigner (‘choujoy,’ ‘choujaninin’), and his friends\r\nand attendants are represented as coming with him from a distant\r\ncountry, in order to take away the future spouse.”[1924] Sir Richard\r\nBurton says, “As a general rule Somali women prefer _amourettes_\r\nwith strangers, following the well-known Arab proverb, ‘The new comer\r\nfilleth the eye.’”[1925]\r\n\r\nWe have seen how variously defined the prohibited degrees are in the\r\nlaws of nations. Facts show that the extent to which relatives are\r\nnot allowed to intermarry is nearly connected with their close living\r\ntogether. Generally speaking, the prohibited degrees are extended much\r\nfarther among savage and barbarous peoples than in civilized societies.\r\nAs a rule, the former, if they have not remained in the most primitive\r\nsocial condition of man, live, not in separate families, but in large\r\nhouseholds or communities, all the members of which dwell in very close\r\ncontact with each other.\r\n\r\nThe communism in the family life of the exogamous Indians of North\r\nAmerica has been exhaustively illustrated by Mr. Morgan in his work on\r\n‘Houses and House-Life of the American Aborigines.’ “The household of\r\nthe Mandans,” he says, “consisting of from twenty to forty persons,\r\nthe households of the Columbian tribes of about the same number, the\r\nSoshonee household of seven families, the households of the Sauks, of\r\nthe Iroquois, and of the Creeks, each composed of several families,\r\nare fair types of the households of the Northern Indians at the epoch\r\nof their discovery. The fact is also established that these tribes\r\nconstructed, as a rule, large joint tenement houses, each of which was\r\noccupied by a large household composed of several families, among whom\r\nprovisions were in common, and who practised communism in living in the\r\nhousehold.”[1926] Among the Iroquois, each household was made up on\r\nthe principle of kinship through females, so that the married women,\r\nusually sisters, own or collateral, being of the same gens or clan,\r\ntogether with their children made a family circle, within which, as we\r\nhave seen, intermarriage was entirely prohibited.[1927] The Senel in\r\nCalifornia live sometimes from twenty to thirty together in the same\r\nimmense dome-shaped or oblong lodge of willow-poles, including all\r\nwho are blood relations.[1928] According to Egede, the Greenlanders,\r\nwho prohibit marriage between cousins, continue after marriage to\r\nlive in their parents’ house together with other kindred; and what\r\nthey get they all enjoy in common.[1929] The Chippewas, who consider\r\ncousins german in the same light as brothers and sisters, but do not\r\nrecognize relationship beyond this degree, are divided into small bands\r\nconsisting of but few families each.[1930] Among the exogamous Uaupés,\r\nthe houses are the abode of numerous families, and sometimes of a whole\r\nhorde.[1931] Among the Yahgans, who regard marriage between first and\r\nsecond cousins as incestuous, “occasionally as many as five families\r\nare to be found living in a wigwam, but generally two families.”[1932]\r\n\r\nThe Australian aborigines live mostly in small hordes, often consisting\r\nof from thirty to fifty men, women, and children. Such a horde,\r\naccording to Mr. Brough Smyth, “is in fact but an enlargement of\r\na family circle, and none within it can intermarry.”[1933] Among\r\nthe Efatese, in whose clan-system the prohibition of incest is a\r\nfundamental law, each clan is regarded as one family. “A child of\r\n_a_,” says Mr. Macdonald, “calls her own mother mother, and all\r\nher mother’s tribe (clan) sisters mother; and calls by the name of\r\nfather not only her own father but all his tribe (clan) brothers; and\r\nthey all call the child their child.”[1934] The Malays, according\r\nto Professor Wilken, live, as a rule, in large houses containing a\r\ngreat number of differently related persons.[1935] “In Nanusa,”\r\nDr. Hickson remarks, “I understood that marriage was not permitted\r\nbetween members of the same household. The enormous households of the\r\nNanusa archipelago are probably the remnants of a much more complete\r\nsystem of intra-tribal clanships, which has become almost obliterated\r\nin the more highly developed races of Sangir and Siauw.”[1936] Among\r\nthe Nairs, a household, the members of which are strictly prohibited\r\nfrom sexual relation with each other, includes, as a rule, many allied\r\nmen, women, and children, who not only live together in large common\r\nhouses, but possess everything in common.[1937] Among the Kafirs, the\r\ndimensions of a kraal are determined by the number of a man’s family\r\nand dependants, the family consisting of the father together with his\r\nchildren, including married sons.[1938]\r\n\r\nThe South Slavonians live in house-communities, each consisting\r\nof a body of from fifteen to sixty members or even more, who are\r\nblood-relations to the second or third degree, of course only on\r\nthe male side.[1939] These related families associate in a common\r\ndwelling or group of dwellings, governed by a common chief. “At the\r\npresent moment,” Sir Henry Maine remarks, “the common residence of\r\nso many persons of both sexes in the same household may be said to\r\nbe only possible through their belief that any union of kinsmen and\r\nkinswomen would be incestuous. The South Slavonian table of prohibited\r\ndegrees is extremely wide.”[1940] Again, Professor Kohler points out\r\nthe connection between the extensive prohibitions of the Hindus and\r\ntheir large households.[1941] In Wales there existed, as a national\r\ninstitution, a joint-family called “trev,” consisting of four\r\ngenerations. Marriage, says Mr. Lewis, was to be “outside the trev, or\r\nkindred who lived together within one enclosure.”[1942]\r\n\r\nMontesquieu, indeed, observed long ago that marriage between cousins\r\nwas prohibited by peoples among whom brothers and their children used\r\nto live in the same house. “Chez ces peuples,” he says, “le mariage\r\nentre cousins germains doit être regardé comme contraire à la nature;\r\nchez les autres, non.” According to him, this prohibition has the\r\nsame origin as the aversion to sexual relations between brothers and\r\nsisters, _i.e._, “les pères et les mères ayent voulu conserver les\r\nmœurs de leurs enfans et leurs maisons pures.”[1943] Holding a similar\r\nopinion, Dr. Bertillon maintains that, properly speaking, it was not\r\nconsanguinity, but the purity of home, that the ancient legislators\r\nwere thinking of when they forbade close intermarriage.[1944] It\r\nis scarcely necessary to say how far I am from thinking that these\r\nprohibitions are, in the first place, due to the providence of parents\r\nor legislators.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, where the families live more separately such\r\nextensive prohibitions to close intermarrying do not generally\r\nexist. Among the Isánna Indians of Brazil, who prefer marriage with\r\nrelations, cousins with cousins, uncles with nieces, and nephews\r\nwith aunts, each family has a separate house.[1945] The endogamous\r\nMaoris, who frequently marry near relations, have their villages\r\ngenerally scattered over a large plot of ground, the personal rights\r\nof possession being held most sacred.[1946] “There is no national\r\nbond of union amongst them,” says Mr. Yate; “each one is jealous of\r\nthe authority and power of his neighbour; the hand of each individual\r\nis against every man, and every man’s hand against him.”[1947] Among\r\nthe Todas, who live in strict endogamy, families reside in permanent\r\nvillages having each a certain tract of grazing ground around it,\r\nand containing from two to three huts. Most of these huts consist of\r\nonly one room or cabin, and each room holds one entire subdivision of\r\na family.[1948] The Bushmans, among whom no degree of consanguinity\r\nprevents a matrimonial connection, except between brothers and sisters,\r\nparents and children,[1949] live a solitary life in small family huts,\r\nnot high enough to admit even of a Bushman standing upright within\r\nit.[1950] As regards the Wanyoro, whose table of prohibited degrees is\r\nunusually small, Emin Pasha states, “Brother, sister, brother-in-law,\r\nand son-in-law, are the recognized grades of relationship. I have never\r\nnoticed any intimate connection between more distant relations.”[1951]\r\n\r\nThe Sinhalese, who frequently marry their cousins on the paternal\r\nside, have from time immemorial lived either in very small villages,\r\nconsisting of a few houses, or in detached habitations, separated from\r\neach other. Each dwelling is a little establishment in itself, and each\r\nlittle village, so far as its wants are concerned, may be considered\r\nindependent. “They seldom visit each other, except it be to beg or\r\nborrow something. Even near relations manifest no affection to each\r\nother in their visits, but sit with the gravity of strangers.”[1952]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to explain, says Ewald, why, among the Hebrews, marriage\r\nbetween brothers and sisters in the widest sense was forbidden, while\r\nthat between cousins was permitted:—“The latter did not form one\r\nunited household, and the more each house stood strictly by itself\r\nin the ancient fashion, the wider seemed the separation between\r\ncousins.”[1953] Tacitus states that the ancient Germans, whose\r\nprohibitions against incest seem to have included only the nearest\r\nrelations, lived in scattered families at some distance from each\r\nother.[1954] And a comparison between the forbidden degrees of the\r\nGreeks and Romans clearly shows where we have to seek the real cause\r\nof the prohibitions. Among the former, even very close relationship\r\nwas no hindrance to intermarriage, whereas, among the latter, it was\r\nnot allowed between rather distantly related persons. This difference,\r\nas Rossbach justly points out, was due to the fact that the family\r\nfeeling of the Greeks was much weaker than that of the Romans, among\r\nwhom, in early times, a son used to remain in his father’s house even\r\nafter marriage, so that cousins on the father’s side were brought up\r\nas brothers and sisters. Later on, the several families separated from\r\nthe common household, and the prohibited degrees were considerably\r\nretrenched.[1955]\r\n\r\nThe reader may perhaps be disposed to reproach me for selecting only\r\nsuch instances as are in favour of my theory; but statistical data\r\nwill show that such an imputation would be groundless. In speaking of\r\nthe “classificatory system of relationship,” I pointed out that this\r\nsystem springs, to a great extent, from the close living together\r\nof considerable numbers of kinsfolk. Now it is most interesting to\r\nnote that Dr. Tylor, by his method of adhesions, has found the two\r\ninstitutions, exogamy and classificatory relationship, to be in fact\r\ntwo sides of one institution. “In reckoning,” he says, “from the\r\npresent schedules the number of peoples who use relationship names more\r\nor less corresponding to the classificatory systems here considered,\r\nthey are found to be fifty-three, and the estimated number of these\r\nwhich might coincide accidentally with exogamy, were there no close\r\nconnection between them, would be about twelve. But in fact the number\r\nof peoples who have both exogamy and classification is thirty-three,\r\nthis strong coincidence being the measure of the close casual\r\nconnection subsisting between the two institutions. The adherence is\r\neven stronger as to cross-cousin marriage (_i.e._, that the children\r\nof two brothers may not marry, nor the children of two sisters, though\r\nthe child of the brother may marry the child of the sister), of which\r\ntwenty-one cases appear in the schedules, no less than fifteen of the\r\npeoples practising it being also known as exogamous.”[1956] Among\r\nthe Reddies, a father’s elder brother and a mother’s elder sister\r\nare called, respectively, “great-father” and “great mother,” and a\r\nfather’s younger brother and a mother’s younger sister, respectively,\r\n“lesser-father” and “lesser mother”; whereas the father’s sisters and\r\nthe mother’s brothers are denoted by quite different terms. Mr. Kearns\r\nremarks that they consider the difference as well as the distance of\r\nrelationship between these two groups of relations to be so great\r\nthat they think it unlawful and incestuous to marry the daughter of a\r\nfather’s brother or of a mother’s sister, she being equal to a sister,\r\nwhilst it is perfectly legal to marry the daughter of a father’s sister\r\nor of a mother’s brother.[1957]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the prohibitions against incest are very often more\r\nor less one-sided, applying more extensively either to the relations\r\non the father’s side or to those on the mother’s, according as descent\r\nis reckoned through men or women. We have also seen that the line\r\nof descent is intimately connected with local relationships; and\r\nwe may now fairly infer that the same local relationships exercise\r\na considerable influence on the table of prohibited degrees. Among\r\nthe Rejangs of Sumatra, says Marsden, a marriage must not take place\r\nbetween relations within the third degree; “but there are exceptions\r\nfor the descendants of females who, passing into other families, become\r\nas strangers.”[1958] A Chinese woman, on marriage, alienates herself\r\nfrom her own family to be incorporated into that of her husband;\r\nhence, as Mr. Medhurst observes, children of brothers and sisters may\r\nmarry at pleasure, while those of brothers cannot be united on pain of\r\ndeath.[1959]\r\n\r\nIn a large number of cases, prohibitions of intermarriage are only\r\nindirectly influenced by the close living together. Aversion to the\r\nintermarriage of persons who live in intimate connection with each\r\nother has provoked prohibitions of the intermarriage of relations; and,\r\nas kinship is traced by means of a system of names, the name comes to\r\nbe considered identical with relationship. This system, as Dr. Tylor\r\nremarks,[1960] is necessarily one-sided. Though it will keep up the\r\nrecord of descent either on the male or female side, it cannot do both\r\nat once. The other line, not having been kept up by such means of\r\nrecord, even where it is recognized as a line of relationship, is more\r\nor less neglected, and is soon forgotten; hence the prohibited degrees\r\noften extend very far on the one side, but not on the other. We have\r\nseen many instances of a common surname being a bar to intermarriage.\r\nThis is especially the case with peoples among whom the clannish\r\nfeeling is highly developed. Thus even the commonest Chinese are often\r\nable to trace their descent through lines of ancestry more remote than\r\nany that England’s most ancient families can claim.[1961] And, among\r\nthe Ossetes, a man is bound to take blood-revenge for a cousin a\r\nhundred times removed who bears his name, whereas relationship on the\r\nmother’s side is not recognized.[1962]\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the feeling that two persons are intimately\r\nconnected in some way or other may, through an association of ideas,\r\ngive rise to the notion that marriage or intercourse between them is\r\nincestuous. Hence the prohibitions of marriage between relations by\r\nalliance and by adoption. Hence, too, the prohibitions on the ground of\r\nwhat is called “spiritual relationship.” The Emperor Justinian passed\r\na law forbidding any man to marry a woman for whom he had stood as\r\ngodfather in baptism, the tie of the godfather and godchild being so\r\nanalogous to that of the father and child as to make such a marriage\r\nappear improper.[1963] In the Roman Church sponsorship creates a bar to\r\nthe marriage even of co-sponsors, and the restriction can be removed\r\nonly by a dispensation.[1964] In Eastern Europe, the groomsman at a\r\nwedding comes under a set of rules which forbids intermarriage with the\r\nfamily of the bride to exactly the same extent as if he were naturally\r\nthe brother of the bridegroom.[1965] A similar _cognatio spiritualis_,\r\naccording to the old law-books of India, occurs between a pupil and his\r\n“guru,” that is, the teacher who instructs him in the Veda. The pupil\r\nlived in his guru’s house for several years, and regarded him almost\r\nas a father.[1966] Hence adultery with a guru’s wife was considered a\r\nmortal sin.[1967]\r\n\r\nBut how, then, are we to explain the exceptions, apparent or real,\r\nto the rule that close living together inspires an aversion to\r\nintermarriage? How are we to explain the fact that, besides tribes that\r\nare exogamous, there are others that are endogamous, and that, besides\r\npeoples with very extensive laws against intermarriage, there are\r\nothers among whom unions take place between very near relations, such\r\nas brothers and sisters, and even parents and children.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter we shall examine the psychological principle which\r\nunderlies the endogamous marriage. For the present it is sufficient to\r\nsay that endogamy never, except in cases of extreme isolation, seems\r\nto occur among peoples living in very small communities with close\r\nconnections between their members. Concerning the Australians, Mr.\r\nCurr expressly states that those tribes which are endogamous are, as\r\na rule, stronger in numbers than those in which exogamous marriage\r\nobtains.[1968]\r\n\r\nThe marriage of brother and sister means, as we have seen, in most\r\ncases, marriage between a half-brother and a half-sister, having the\r\nsame father but different mothers. Such marriages are not necessarily\r\ncontrary to the principle here laid down. Polygyny breaks up the one\r\nfamily into as many sub-families as there are wives who have children,\r\nand it is not possible for the father of these sub-families to be a\r\nmember of each of them in the same sense as the father is a member of\r\nthe monogamous family. Nor are the children of the different mothers\r\nbrought into such close contact as the children of one mother, every\r\nwife with her own family forming a little separate group, and generally\r\nliving in a separate hut.[1969] On the contrary, hatred and rivalry are\r\nof no rare occurrence among the members of the various sub-families.\r\nIn the Pelew Islands, according to Herr Kubary, it very seldom happens\r\nthat the several wives of the same man even see each other.[1970] After\r\nspeaking of the marriage of half-brother and half-sister allowed among\r\nthe ancient Arabs, Professor Robertson Smith remarks, “Whatever is the\r\norigin of bars to marriage, they certainly are early associated with\r\nthe feeling that it is indecent for housemates to intermarry.”[1971]\r\n\r\nMost of the recorded instances of intermarriage of brother and sister\r\nrefer to royal families, to the exclusion of others; and there is no\r\ndifficulty in accounting for incestuous unions of this sort. Among\r\nlower races, as well as in Europe, it is considered improper for royal\r\npersons to contract marriage with persons of less exalted birth.\r\nBut whilst European princes may go to some friendly Court for their\r\nconsorts, a similar course is not open to African or Asiatic potentates.\r\n\r\nIncestuous unions may also take place on account of necessity, as\r\namong the Wa-taïta, or on account of extreme isolation, as among\r\nthe Karens of the Tenasserim Provinces,[1972] several of the small\r\ntribes of Brazil, and especially the Veddahs of Ceylon. Among the wild\r\nVeddahs, the different families are separated from each other by great\r\ndistances, and it is only accidentally or occasionally that any others\r\nbesides the members of one family are brought together.[1973] The\r\nreason for the practice of marrying a sister, says Professor Virchow,\r\n“was probably the same everywhere, in the royal families as with the\r\nnaked Veddahs, the lack of suitable women or of women altogether.”[1974]\r\n\r\nCertain instances of incestuous connection are evidently the results of\r\nvitiated instincts, the origin of which we are not able to trace. It\r\nis a remarkable fact that several of the peoples among whom incestuous\r\nintercourse is said to be practised are, at the same time, expressly\r\nstated to indulge in bestiality or other unnatural vices.[1975] This\r\nshows that their sexual feelings are altogether in a perverted state.\r\n\r\nMuch stress has been laid by anthropologists on the few instances\r\nof peoples who habitually or occasionally contract unions which we\r\nshould consider criminal. They have been taken for surviving types\r\nof the primitive condition of man, proving that “sentiments such as\r\nthose which among ourselves restrain the sexual instincts are not\r\ninnate.”[1976] But it is obvious that they prove nothing of the\r\nkind. Students of early history have often paid too much regard to\r\nexceptions, and too little to rules, overlooking the fact that there is\r\nno rule which has no exceptions.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that no feeling of incest exists among the lower\r\nanimals.[1977] According to Mr. Huth, incest “is constantly practised\r\nby animals, and habitually by those which are polygamous.”[1978] But,\r\nas we have previously seen, among species that live in families, the\r\nyoung, without exception, leave the family as soon as they are able\r\nto shift for themselves; and Mr. Huth has adduced not the slightest\r\nevidence for his statement that “polygamy among animals means the\r\nclosest incest.”[1979]\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis here advocated can, I think, account for all the facts\r\ngiven in the last chapter. It explains how the horror of incest may be\r\nindependent of experience as well as of education; why the horror of\r\nincest refers not only to relations by blood, but very frequently to\r\npersons not at all so related; why the prohibitions of consanguineous\r\nmarriages vary so considerably with regard to the prohibited degrees,\r\napplying, however, almost universally to persons who live in the\r\nclosest contact with each other; and why these prohibitions are so\r\ncommonly extended much farther on the one side, the paternal or the\r\nmaternal, than on the other. The question now arises:—How has this\r\ninstinctive aversion to marriage between persons living closely\r\ntogether originated?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have seen that a certain degree of similarity as regards the\r\nreproductive system of two individuals is required to make their union\r\nfertile and the progeny resulting from this union fully capable of\r\npropagation. It might, then, be supposed that the highest degree of\r\nsimilarity must be the most beneficial; but in all probability this\r\nis not the case. It seems to be necessary not only that the sexual\r\nelements which unite shall be somewhat like, but that they shall be in\r\nsome way different. The similarity must not be _too_ great.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin, by his careful studies on the effects of cross- and\r\nself-fertilization in the vegetable kingdom, contributed more largely\r\nthan any one else to the discovery of this law. He watched, from\r\ngermination to maturity, more than a thousand individual plants,\r\nproduced by crossing and self-fertilization, belonging to fifty-seven\r\nspecies, fifty-two genera, and thirty large families, and including\r\nnatives of the most various countries.[1980] The result established by\r\nthis research was, that cross-fertilization is generally beneficial,\r\nand self-fertilization injurious; which is shown by the difference in\r\nheight, weight, constitutional vigour, and fertility of the offspring\r\nfrom crossed and self-fertilized flowers, and in the number of seeds\r\nproduced by the parent-plants.[1981] Hence, whenever plants which are\r\nthe offspring of self-fertilization are opposed in the struggle for\r\nexistence to the offspring of cross-fertilization, the latter have the\r\nadvantage. And this follows, according to Mr. Darwin, from individuals\r\nof two distinct kinds having been subjected during previous generations\r\nto different conditions, or to their having varied from some unknown\r\ncause in a manner commonly called spontaneous, because of that innate\r\ntendency to vary and to advance in organization which exists in all\r\nbeings; so that in either case their sexual elements have been in some\r\ndegree differentiated.[1982]\r\n\r\nAs for the animal kingdom, Mr. Darwin remarks that almost all who\r\nhave bred many kinds of animals, and have written on the subject,\r\nhave expressed the strongest conviction on the evil effects of close\r\ninterbreeding.[1983] “Indeed,” says Sir J. Sebright, “I have no\r\ndoubt but that, by this practice being continued, animals would, in\r\ncourse of time, degenerate to such a degree as to become incapable of\r\nbreeding at all.... I have tried many experiments by breeding in-and-in\r\nupon dogs, fowls, and pigeons; the dogs became, from strong spaniels,\r\nweak and diminutive lap-dogs, the fowls became long in the legs, small\r\nin the body, and bad breeders.”[1984] Mr. Huth, on the other hand,\r\ndenies that breeding in-and-in, however close, has proved to be in\r\nitself hurtful, and quotes the evidence of numerous breeders whose\r\nchoicest stocks have always been so bred. But in these cases, as Mr.\r\nWallace remarks, “there has been rigid selection by which the weak or\r\nthe infertile have been eliminated, and with such selection there is\r\nno doubt that the ill effects of close interbreeding can be prevented\r\nfor a long time; but this by no means proves that no ill effects\r\nare produced.”[1985] The consensus of opinion on this point among\r\neminent breeders is indeed overwhelming, and cannot be reasoned away.\r\nAccording to Crampe’s experiment with the brown rat (_Mus decumanus_),\r\nthirty-nine animals out of 153 born by related parents, _i.e._, 25·5\r\nper cent., died soon after birth, whereas of 299 animals of parents\r\nnot related this was the case with twenty-eight only, _i.e._, 8·4 per\r\ncent. The animals of incestuous broods were much smaller and lighter\r\nthan others, and their fecundity was diminished.[1986] Mr. Huth himself\r\nobserved, when breeding rabbits in-and-in, that “after the fourth\r\ngeneration there was a diminution of fecundity analogous to the disgust\r\nthat the stomach would feel at the same diet long continued,” though he\r\nfound no evil effect in any other way. On the contrary, the in-and-in\r\nbred offspring were somewhat heavier than the non-related parent\r\nanimals.[1987] Professor Preyer has made a similar observation with\r\nregard to guinea-pigs: breeding in-and-in produced a considerable loss\r\nof fertility, but was accompanied with an increase of weight.[1988]\r\nThis seems to indicate that the effects of close interbreeding are not\r\nalways the same.\r\n\r\nThere are certainly breeders who prefer connecting together the animals\r\nnearest allied in blood to one another. But, as Dr. Mitchell observes,\r\n“when breeding in-and-in has been practised with so-called good\r\nresults, the issue is nothing but the development of a saleable defect,\r\nwhich, from the animal’s point of view, must be regarded as wholly\r\nunnatural and artificial, and not calculated to promote its well-being\r\nor natural usefulness.”[1989]\r\n\r\nMany writers suppose that all the evils from close interbreeding depend\r\nupon the combination and consequent increase of morbid tendencies\r\ncommon to both parents, the state of whose health decides whether union\r\nwould be favourable or not to the offspring. “If the parents are\r\nperfectly healthy,” says M. Pouchet, “and exempt from all commencing\r\ndegeneracy, they can only give birth to children _at least_ as healthy\r\nas themselves.... But if the same degeneracy has already tainted both\r\nthe parents, the offspring will show it in a greater degree, and will\r\ntend towards entire disappearance.”[1990] The same opinion is held by\r\nSir John Sebright. But being, as an experienced breeder, well aware of\r\nthe injurious results which almost always follow from interbreeding\r\nanimals too closely, he adds that, according to his belief, there never\r\ndid exist an animal without some defect, in constitution, in form, or\r\nin some other essential quality, or that at least a tendency to the\r\nsame imperfection generally prevails in the same family.[1991]\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin, however, has shown it to be highly probable that, though\r\nthe injury has often partly resulted from the combination of morbid\r\ntendencies, the general cause is different. Considering the number of\r\nself-fertilized plants that were tried, he thinks it is nothing less\r\nthan absurd to suppose that in all these cases the mother-plants,\r\nthough not appearing in any way diseased, were weak or unhealthy in so\r\npeculiar a manner that their self-fertilized seedlings, many hundreds\r\nin number, were rendered inferior in height, weight, constitutional\r\nvigour, and fertility to their crossed offspring.[1992] Moreover,\r\nself-fertilization and close interbreeding induce sterility, and this\r\nindicates something quite different from the augmentation of morbid\r\ntendencies common to both parents.[1993] Hence it seems to be almost\r\nbeyond doubt that, just as the sterility of distinct species when\r\nfirst crossed, and of their hybrid offspring, depends on their sexual\r\nelements having been differentiated in too great a degree, the evils of\r\nclose interbreeding, or self-fertilization in plants, result chiefly\r\nfrom their sexual elements not having been sufficiently differentiated.\r\nBut we do not know why a certain amount of differentiation is necessary\r\nor favourable for the fertilization or union of two organisms, any more\r\nthan for the chemical affinity or union of two substances.[1994] It\r\nmust, however, be observed that no case of complete sterility is met\r\nwith in self-fertilized seedlings, as is so common with hybrids,[1995]\r\nand that interbreeding even of the nearest relations may sometimes,\r\nunder very favourable circumstances, be continued through several\r\ngenerations without any evil results making their appearance.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to believe that a law which holds good for the rest of\r\nthe animal kingdom, as well as for plants, does not apply to man also.\r\nBut it is difficult to adduce direct evidence for the evil effects of\r\nconsanguineous marriages. We cannot expect very conspicuous results\r\nfrom other alliances than those between the nearest relations—between\r\nbrothers and sisters, parents and children. And the injurious results\r\neven of such unions would not necessarily appear at once. Sir J.\r\nSebright remarks that there may be families of domestic animals which\r\ngo through several generations without sustaining much injury from\r\nhaving been bred in-and-in,[1996] and the offspring of self-fertilized\r\nplants do not always show any loss of vigour in the first generations.\r\nMan cannot, in this respect, be subjected to experiments like those\r\ntried in the case of other animals, and habitual intermarriage of the\r\nvery nearest relations is, as we have seen, exceedingly rare. Mr. Adam\r\nargues that there is no proof of the physical deterioration of those\r\ndivisions of mankind amongst whom incestuous unions are known more or\r\nless to have prevailed—as the Egyptians and Persians.[1997] But among\r\nthese nations marriage certainly did not always take place between\r\nclosely related persons; and breeders of domestic animals inform us\r\nthat the mixing-in even of a drop of unrelated blood is sufficient\r\nalmost to neutralize the injurious effects of long continued close\r\ninterbreeding. Again, Mr. Huth asserts that, though the Ptolemies\r\nhabitually married their sisters, nieces, and cousins, they were\r\nneither sterile nor particularly short-lived.[1998] Mr. Galton, on the\r\ncontrary, sees in Ptolemaic experience a proof that close intermarriage\r\nis followed by sterility.[1999] In ten marriages between brothers and\r\nsisters, uncles and nieces, or between first-cousins, the average\r\nnumber of children was not quite two, and three of the unions were\r\nentirely sterile.[2000]\r\n\r\nThe Veddahs of Ceylon are probably the most in-and-in bred people that\r\never existed. Among them, the practice of a man marrying his younger\r\nsister did not occur only occasionally; according to Mr. Bailey, it\r\nwas _the_ proper marriage. Among the Bintenne Veddahs, it may be said\r\nto have been, for perhaps two generations or so, extinct, whilst among\r\nthose of Nilgala, it is at most only disappearing. Mr. Bailey believes\r\nthat this practice is quite sufficient to account for the short stature\r\nas well as the weak and vacant expression of this people. He did not\r\nfind many traces of insanity, idiocy, and epilepsy—maladies which\r\nsuch marriages, according to a common belief, might be supposed to\r\nproduce. “But in other respects,” he says, “the injurious effects of\r\nthis custom would seem to be plainly discernible. The race is rapidly\r\nbecoming extinct; large families are all but unknown, and longevity\r\nis very rare. I have been at some pains to obtain reliable data to\r\nelucidate these points. Out of seventy-two Veddahs in Nilgala, fifty\r\nwere adults, and twenty-two children. In one small sept, or family,\r\nthere were nine adults and one child; in another, one child and eight\r\nadults; and so on. In Bintenne, out of three hundred and eight Veddahs,\r\na hundred and seventy-five were adults and a hundred and thirty-three\r\nchildren. Here the disproportion is not so marked; but in one of the\r\nsmaller tribes, more isolated than the rest, there were twenty adults,\r\nand but four children. The paucity of children, I think, must be\r\nascribed to the degeneracy produced by such close intermarriages, for\r\nI have never heard a suspicion of infanticide existing among them.\r\nOut of fifty adults in Nilgala, only one appeared to have numbered\r\nseventy years, and but eight to have exceeded fifty. In Bintenne, of a\r\nhundred and seventy-five adults, two only seemed to have reached their\r\nseventieth, and but fourteen to have exceeded their fiftieth year. Such\r\nstatistics seem to show the practical results of such connections.\r\nThe Nilgala Veddahs, who still maintain an almost total isolation\r\nfrom other people, are rapidly disappearing. The Veddahs of Bintenne,\r\nwho have abandoned the pernicious custom which I have described, and\r\nstill intermarry among themselves, are becoming extinct, though more\r\ngradually.”[2001]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of this case, the closest kind of intermarriage\r\nwhich we have opportunities of studying is that between first cousins.\r\nUnfortunately, the observations hitherto made on the subject are\r\nfar from decisive. Several writers, as M. Périer, Dr. Voisin, and\r\nMr. Huth, believe that there are no injurious results at all from\r\nthose marriages, unless the parents are afflicted with the same\r\nhereditary morbid tendencies,[2002] whilst others, as M. Devay and\r\nM. Boudin, express the most alarming opinions as to the bad effects\r\nof consanguineous marriages. Such alliances are supposed to bring\r\nevils of many different kinds upon a population, as sterility,\r\nidiocy, epilepsy, insanity, deaf-muteism, congenital malformations\r\nin the offspring, cretinism, albinoism,[2003] &c. But how little the\r\nstatements of the various writers agree with each other appears,\r\nfor instance, from the fact that M. Boudin found the proportion\r\nof deaf-mutes born in consanguineous marriages, in the Imperial\r\nInstitution of Deaf-Mutes at Paris, to be 28·35 per cent., whereas,\r\naccording to Dr. Mitchell, it amounts to 5·17 per cent. in Scotch and\r\nEnglish institutions.[2004]\r\n\r\nAs it is impossible to dwell here upon the investigations of the\r\nseveral writers, of which Mr. Huth has given so complete an account,\r\nI shall confine myself to a statement of the general results attained\r\nby those investigators who have founded their inquiries on a more\r\ntrustworthy statistical basis.\r\n\r\nAdopting a method different from that of his predecessors, Professor\r\nG. H. Darwin has endeavoured first to discover the proportion of\r\nconsanguineous marriages in the whole population, and then to find out\r\nwhether the offspring of those marriages exhibit a greater percentage\r\nof individuals, defective in one way or another, than the offspring\r\nof non-consanguineous marriages. His investigations tend decidedly to\r\ninvalidate the exaggerated conclusions of many previous writers, but\r\nhe thinks that “there are nevertheless grounds for asserting that\r\nvarious maladies take an easy hold of the offspring of consanguineous\r\nmarriages.”[2005] He did not find evidence that the marriage of\r\nfirst cousins had any effect in the production of infertility,\r\ndeaf-muteism, insanity, or idiocy, but he observed a slightly lowered\r\nvitality amongst the offspring of first cousins, and a somewhat\r\nhigher death-rate than amongst the families of non-consanguineous\r\nmarriages.[2006] Moreover, the numbers of boating men belonging to the\r\ntwenty boats at Oxford and thirty at Cambridge, in the first and second\r\ndivision, and those of selected athletes from some schools in England,\r\njustified, to some extent, the belief “that offspring of first cousins\r\nare deficient physically, whilst at the same time they negative the\r\nviews of alarmist writers on the subject.”[2007] It is curious that, in\r\nspite of such unambiguous statements, Mr. Darwin’s paper has generally\r\nbeen quoted as an evidence of the perfect harmlessness of first cousin\r\nmarriages.\r\n\r\nM. Stieda has found that, in the departments of France, the number\r\nof bodily or mentally infirm people increases almost constantly in\r\nproportion to the number of consanguineous marriages, as will be seen\r\nfrom the following table:—\r\n\r\n                                  Number of\r\n                Number of       consanguineous          Number of\r\n    Group.     departments.      marriages in        infirm people in\r\n                                each thousand         each thousand\r\n                                  marriages.           inhabitants.\r\n\r\n      I.           10                 5·4                 2·3\r\n     II.           10                 8·3                 2·8\r\n    III.           14                 9·95                3\r\n     IV.           10                11·2                 2·4\r\n      V.           13                12·5                 2·8\r\n     VI.            8                13·8                 3\r\n    VII.           14                15·8                 3·5\r\n   VIII.           10                19·2                 3·25\r\n  —————————————————————————————————-———————————-———————————-—————-—\r\n  I.—IV.          44                 9·2                 2·65\r\n  V.—VIII.        45                14·8                 3·1[2008]\r\n\r\nThe Danish physician, Dr. Mygge, published in 1879 a book on ‘Marriage\r\nbetween Blood-Relations,’ which unfortunately has received much less\r\nattention than it deserves.[2009] Thanks to the trustworthiness of the\r\nmethod, the number of cases considered, and the author’s impartiality,\r\nit is probably the most important statistical contribution hitherto\r\nissued on this subject. Dr. Mygge found, from the information he\r\nreceived from various parts of Denmark, that in that country, or at\r\nleast in the parishes of it which came under his observation, there\r\noccur, among the children of related persons, comparatively more\r\nidiots, lunatics, epileptics, and deaf-mutes than among others. He\r\nconsiders it probable, too, though not proved, that such children die\r\nin a higher ratio and are more liable to certain diseases. But, on the\r\nother hand, he did not notice any perceptible difference in fertility\r\nbetween consanguineous and crossed marriages.[2010]\r\n\r\nIn these inquiries, Dr. Mygge followed the method applied by the\r\nNorwegian physician Ludvig Dahl twenty years earlier. Through careful\r\ninvestigation of 246 marriages, eighty-five of which were between\r\nfirst cousins and four between still nearer relations, this inquirer\r\nwas led to the conclusions that consanguineous marriages are somewhat\r\nless fertile than crossed marriages; that they produce comparatively\r\nmany more still-born and sickly children; and that insanity, idiocy,\r\ndeaf-dumbness, and epilepsy occur about eleven times as often among the\r\noffspring of relations, as among the offspring of unrelated parents.\r\nBut he admitted that the numbers compared were too small to make his\r\nconclusions decisive.[2011]\r\n\r\nThese results are of course to a great extent conjectural. But it is\r\nnoteworthy that, of all the writers who have discussed the subject,\r\nthe majority, and certainly not the least able of them, have expressed\r\ntheir belief in marriages between first cousins being more or less\r\nunfavourable to the offspring.[2012] And no evidence which can stand\r\nthe test of scientific investigation has hitherto been adduced against\r\nthis view.\r\n\r\nSome writers have, indeed, cited instances of communities where\r\nconsanguineous marriages have occurred constantly without any evil\r\neffects having appeared. Thus the Pitcairn Island, uninhabited till the\r\nyear 1790, was at that time peopled by nine white men, and six men and\r\ntwelve women of Tahiti. In 1800 the population consisted of one man,\r\nfive women, and nineteen children; and the descendants of these persons\r\nare stated by later travellers to be strong and healthy without any\r\ntraces of degeneration. Omitting whatever else may be said against\r\nthis case as evidence for the harmlessness of consanguineous marriages,\r\nI need only call attention to the facts that, since the colonization\r\nof this island, a few strangers have joined the little colony; that it\r\nwas once removed to Norfolk Island, and that, of those who returned,\r\none was a Norfolk Islander who had married a Pitcairn girl; that the\r\nisland has frequently been visited by ships with their crews;[2013] and\r\nthat, as Beechey expressly states, the same restrictions with regard to\r\nintermarriage of relations exist here as in England.[2014]\r\n\r\nThere are several isolated communities—in Java, Peru, Great Britain,\r\nFrance, Scandinavia, &c.—which intermarry solely among themselves\r\nwithout any evil effects being discernible. An often-quoted case is\r\nthe community of Batz (3,300 persons), situated near Croisic on a\r\npeninsula. The inhabitants of this community have been in the habit\r\nof closely intermarrying among themselves from time immemorial.\r\nNevertheless, they are almost all very well in health without any\r\nhereditary affection. But Dr. Voisin observes, “Les conditions\r\nclimatériques de la commune de Batz, son voisinage de la mer, l’hygiène\r\net les habitudes de ses habitants, semblent s’accorder pour empêcher\r\nla dégénérescence de l’espèce et paraissent expliquer l’innocuité\r\ndes mariages entre consanguins qui s’y pratiquent depuis plusieurs\r\nsiècles.”[2015] In other isolated communities the population is not so\r\nnumerous, and the sanitary conditions are not perhaps so favourable:\r\nbut in any case we may say that this local endogamy is generally\r\nsomething quite different from marriage with near relations. Dr.\r\nMitchell found that, in almost all the isolated communities along\r\nthe coasts of Scotland, which had been given as instances of close\r\ninterbreeding, such marriages were comparatively rare. According to\r\nDr. Mygge, the like is true of the population of Lyø and Strynø in\r\nDenmark.[2016] And Dr. Andrew Wood states, of the fisher-folk of\r\nNewhaven, that, though they keep themselves much segregated, they are\r\nvery careful regarding intermarriage, and look upon the union of\r\nrelatives as an infringement of the laws of morality.[2017]\r\n\r\nMoreover, even if it could be proved that, in particular cases, close\r\nintermarrying, though continued for a long time, has been followed by\r\nno bad consequences, this would be no evidence that consanguineous\r\nmarriages are as a rule innocuous. In some parishes of Denmark Dr.\r\nMygge found no evil effects of such marriages, whilst in others they\r\nwere very conspicuous.[2018] And from the investigations of Mr. Darwin\r\nit appears that, notwithstanding the injury which most plants suffer\r\nfrom self-fertilization, a few have almost certainly been propagated\r\nin a state of nature for thousands of generations without having been\r\nonce intercrossed. It is impossible to understand, he says, why some\r\nindividuals even of the _same species_ are sterile, whilst others are\r\nquite fertile, with their own pollen.[2019]\r\n\r\nThere is evidence that the bad consequences of self-fertilization\r\nand close interbreeding may almost fail to appear under favourable\r\nconditions of life. In-and-in bred plants, when allowed enough space\r\nand good soil, frequently show little or no deterioration: whereas,\r\nwhen placed in competition with another plant, they often perish or\r\nare much stunted.[2020] Crampe’s experiments with brown rats proved\r\nthat the breeding in-and-in was much less injurious, if the offspring\r\nof the related parents were well fed and taken care of, than if it was\r\notherwise.[2021] And this is in striking accordance with Dr. Mitchell’s\r\nobservations as to consanguineous marriages in Scotland. The results\r\nthere appear to be least grave, and are frequently almost _nil_, if\r\nthe parents and children live in tolerable comfort, without anxiety or\r\nmuch thought for the morrow, and easily earning enough to procure good\r\nfood and clothing—in short, when they work, but do not struggle for\r\nexistence. On the other hand, when they are “poor, pinched for food,\r\nscrimp of clothing, badly housed, and exposed to misery; when they have\r\nto toil and struggle for the bare necessaries of life—never having\r\nenough for to-day and being always fearful of to-morrow,”—the evil may\r\nbecome very marked.[2022]\r\n\r\nIf this is the case, we must expect to find that consanguineous\r\nmarriages are much more injurious in savage regions, where the struggle\r\nfor existence is often very severe, than they have proved to be in\r\ncivilized society, especially as it is among the well-off classes that\r\nsuch marriages occur most frequently.[2023] In England, according to\r\nMr. G. H. Darwin, cousin-marriages among the aristocracy are probably\r\n4½ per cent.; among the middle and upper middle class, or among the\r\nlanded gentry, 3½ per cent.; but in London, comprising all classes,\r\nthey are probably only 1½ per cent.[2024] He thinks that the slightness\r\nof the evils which he found to result from first-cousin marriages\r\nperhaps depends upon the fact that a large majority of Englishmen live\r\nunder what are on the whole very favourable circumstances.[2025] We\r\nmust also, however, remember that there has been a great mixture of\r\nraces in Europe, and that this necessarily makes marriage of kinsfolk\r\nless injurious, so far as the evil results of such unions depend upon\r\ntoo great a likeness between the sexual elements.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion that closely related marriages produce more destructive\r\neffects among savage than civilized peoples, derives perhaps, some\r\nadditional probability from certain ethnological facts. These facts\r\nmay, at least, serve to show that such marriages, and the experience\r\nof isolated communities, are not everywhere in favour of Mr. Huth’s\r\nconclusions. Several statements on the subject have, indeed, scarcely\r\nany value as direct evidence for the harmfulness of consanguineous\r\nmarriages, but to two or three considerable weight must be attached.\r\n\r\nAccording to v. Martius, who is a great authority on Brazilian\r\nethnography, it is a well-established fact, observed everywhere, that\r\nthe smaller and more isolated of the Indian communities, scarcely any\r\nmembers of which marry members of other communities, are much more\r\nliable to every kind of deterioration than the larger groups.[2026]\r\n“It is probable,” Mr. Bates, another most capable judge, remarks with\r\nreference to the savage tribes on the Upper Amazons, “that the strange\r\ninflexibility of the Indian organization, both bodily and mental, is\r\nowing to the isolation in which each small tribe has lived, and to\r\nthe narrow round of life and thought, and close intermarriages for\r\ncountless generations, which are the necessary results. Their fecundity\r\nis of a low degree, for it is very rare to find an Indian family having\r\nso many as four children, and we have seen how great is their liability\r\nto sickness and death on removal from place to place.”[2027] Touching\r\nthe Isánna Indians, Mr. Wallace asserts that they are said not to be\r\nnearly so numerous, nor to increase so rapidly, as the Uaupés; which\r\nmay perhaps be owing to their marrying with relations, while the latter\r\nprefer strangers.[2028] And v. Tschudi supposes that the low fecundity\r\nof the Botocudos is caused by their endogamous habits; for when their\r\nwomen marry out of their own horde, especially with whites or negroes,\r\nthey are generally very fertile.[2029]\r\n\r\nThe Calidonian Indians of the Isthmus of Darien, according to Mr.\r\nGisborne, are bound never to cross the breed with foreigners;\r\nhence intermarriage is very constant, and, as he remarks, the race\r\ndegenerates.[2030] The Pueblos in New Mexico, too, are said to\r\ndeteriorate because of their constant intermarriage in the same\r\nvillage.[2031] As regards the Hottentots, Barrow remarks, “The\r\nimpolitic custom of hording together in families, and of not marrying\r\nout of their own kraals, has no doubt tended to enervate this race of\r\nmen, and reduced them to their present degenerated condition, which is\r\nthat of a languid, listless phlegmatic people, in whom the prolific\r\npowers of nature seem to be almost exhausted.” Few of the women have\r\nmore than two or three children, and many of them are barren. But this\r\nis not the case when a Hottentot woman is connected with a white man.\r\n“The fruit of such an alliance,” says Barrow, “is not only in general\r\nnumerous, but they are beings of a very different nature from the\r\nHottentot.”[2032]\r\n\r\nIn too early marriages, the licentious habits of both sexes, and\r\nthe intermarriage of near relatives, the Rev. J. Sibree finds the\r\ncauses of the infertility of the women of Madagascar.[2033] Among\r\nthe Garos, the chiefs have, in comparison with the lower classes,\r\ndegenerated physically, and Colonel Dalton is inclined to think that\r\nthis degeneration is a result of close interbreeding.[2034] The\r\nLundu Sea Dyaks, according to Sir Spenser St. John, have decreased\r\ngreatly in numbers—from a thousand families to ten. “They complain\r\nbitterly,” he says, “that they have no families, that their women are\r\nnot fertile; indeed, there were but three or four children in the\r\nwhole place. The men were fine-looking and the women well-favoured and\r\nhealthy—remarkably clean and free from disease. We could only account\r\nfor their decreasing numbers by their constant intermarriages.”[2035]\r\nMr. Foreman thinks that the low intellect and mental debility\r\nperceptible in many families among the domesticated natives of the\r\nPhilippines are due to consanguineous marriages.[2036] Mr. Bachelor\r\nconnects the rapid decrease of the Ainos with their endogamous\r\nhabits.[2037] And Mr. Meade remarks, with regard to the Maoris, that\r\none of the principal causes of the diminishing population is said to be\r\ntheir intermarriages, which cause barrenness among the women.[2038]\r\n\r\nOf no little interest to us are the Todas of the Neilgherry Hills. Mr.\r\nMarshall remarks that, among them, relationship is intimate far beyond\r\nthat witnessed in any country approaching civilization—“intimate to\r\nsuch a degree, that the whole tribe, where not parents and children,\r\nbrothers and sisters, are all first cousins, descended from lines of\r\nfirst cousins prolonged for centuries.”[2039] As regards the general\r\nappearance of the people, a large proportion of both sexes and of all\r\nages are doubtless in excellent health, and their fecundity, according\r\nto Dr. Shortt, is by no means of a low degree.[2040] Nevertheless, the\r\nTodas are dying out. In infancy the mortality is so great that, as a\r\nrule, there is in each family only a small number of children.[2041]\r\n“It is rarely that there are more than two or three children,” says\r\nthe missionary Metz, “and it is not at all an uncommon thing to\r\nfind only a single child, while many families have none at all.” The\r\nnumbers of the Todas have, consequently, for years past been gradually\r\ndeclining, and probably the time is not far distant when they will have\r\npassed away.[2042] Of course, we do not know whether this depends upon\r\ntheir close intermarriages, but there is, at any rate, some reason to\r\nsuspect that this is the case. That the intermarrying has not produced\r\nmore evil effects on the population, may possibly be owing to the\r\nwealth for which the Neilgherry Hills are remarkable, and to their\r\nclimate, which, for mildly invigorating properties and equable seasonal\r\nchanges throughout the year, is perhaps unrivalled anywhere within the\r\ntropics.[2043]\r\n\r\nAnother very much in-and-in bred people are the Persians. Among them,\r\nhusband and wife are generally of the same family, and very often\r\ncousins. Yet Dr. Polak who has lived in Persia for nine years, partly\r\nas a teacher in the medical school of Teheran, partly as physician to\r\nthe Shah, and during this residence has had excellent opportunities of\r\nacquainting himself with the conditions of the people, has not observed\r\nthat the diseases which are supposed to result from consanguineous\r\nmarriages prevail more frequently there than elsewhere. Nor has he\r\nfound that the Persian women are generally less fertile than others.\r\nYet the families are exceedingly small, as the mortality among children\r\nis enormous. Of six, perhaps two as a rule survive, but very often none\r\nat all, most of them dying in their second year. Dr. Polak believes,\r\nindeed, that, on an average, scarcely more than one living child comes\r\nto each woman. A princess in Teheran was looked upon quite as a wonder\r\nbecause she had eight children alive, and the European physician\r\nwas asked if he ever before, in his own country, had seen a similar\r\ncase.[2044]\r\n\r\nMore important than any of these statements is the following testimony\r\nconcerning the Karens of Burma, for which I am indebted to the Rev.\r\nDr. Alonzo Bunker, who has been a resident among that people during\r\nmore than twenty years. He says that, in some of their villages,\r\nexogamy prevails, in others endogamy, but marriages between parents\r\nand children, brothers and sisters, are prohibited everywhere, and\r\neven first cousins very seldom marry, though there is no law against\r\nsuch connections. There is a striking difference with regard to\r\nstature, health, strength and fecundity, between the inhabitants of\r\nthe exogamous and those of the endogamous villages, the latter being\r\nmuch inferior in all these respects. Dr. Bunker has no doubt that this\r\ninferiority is owing to the intermarriage of kinsfolk, and he asserts\r\nthat even the natives themselves ascribe it to this cause, though they\r\nobstinately keep up the old custom, regarding marriages out of their\r\nown village as highly unbecoming. In cases in which missionaries have\r\nbeen able to persuade young men to choose wives from another village,\r\nDr. Bunker assures me that the good effects of a cross appeared at\r\nonce.[2045]\r\n\r\nThere are some other peoples who ascribe evil results to close\r\nintermarriage. Mr. Cousins informs me that the Cis-Natalian Kafirs\r\nbelieve “that their offspring would be of a more sickly nature if\r\nsuch were allowed”; and Mr. Eyles writes that the Zulus, on the border\r\nof Pondoland, regard sterility and deformity as consequences of\r\nconsanguineous unions. The Australian Dieyerie, according to Mr. Gason,\r\nhave a tradition that, after the creation, fathers, mothers, sisters,\r\nbrothers, and others of the closest kin intermarried promiscuously,\r\nuntil the bad effects of these marriages became manifest. A council of\r\nthe chiefs was then assembled to consider in what way the evil might be\r\naverted, and the result of their deliberations was a petition to the\r\nMuramura, or Good Spirit. In answer to this he ordered that the tribe\r\nshould be divided into branches, and distinguished one from the other\r\nby different names, after objects animate and inanimate, such as dogs,\r\nmice, emu, rain, and so forth, and that the members of any such branch\r\nshould be forbidden to marry other members of the same branch.[2046]\r\nAgain, touching the Kenai, in the north-western part of North America,\r\nRichardson states, “It was the custom that the men of one stock should\r\nchoose their wives from another, and the offspring belonged to the race\r\nof the mother. This custom has fallen into disuse, and marriages in the\r\nsame tribe occur; but the old people say that mortality among the Kenai\r\nhas arisen from the neglect of the ancient usage.”[2047]\r\n\r\nIn a Greenland Eskimo tale, the father of Kakamak, finding that all his\r\ngrandchildren have died before reaching the age of puberty, suggests to\r\nhis son-in-law, “Perhaps we are too near akin.”[2048] Two Mohammedan\r\ntravellers of the ninth century tell us that the Hindus never married\r\na relation, because they thought alliances between unrelated persons\r\nimproved the offspring.[2049] In Hadîth, the collection of Mohammedan\r\ntraditions, it is said, “Marry among strangers; thus you will not\r\nhave feeble posterity.” “This view,” says Goldziher, “coincides\r\nwith the opinion of the ancient Arabs that the children of endogamous\r\nmarriages are weakly and lean. To this class also belongs the proverb\r\nof Al-Meydânî, ‘ ... Marry the distant, marry not the near’ (in\r\nrelationship).” A poet, praising a hero, says, “He is a hero, not\r\nborne by the cousin (of his father), he is not weakly; for the seed of\r\nrelations brings forth feeble fruit.”[2050]\r\n\r\nIn opposition to the view that these opinions are the results of\r\nexperience, it may be urged that any infraction of the customs or\r\nlaws of ancestors is commonly thought to call down divine vengeance.\r\nFather Veniaminof tells us that, among the early Aleuts, incest,\r\nwhich was considered the gravest crime, was believed to be always\r\nfollowed by the birth of monsters with walrus-tusks, beard, and other\r\ndisfiguration;[2051] and among the Kafirs, according to Mr. Fynn, it\r\nis a general belief that the offspring of an incestuous union will be\r\na monster—“a punishment inflicted by the ancestral spirit.”[2052]\r\nBut whatever may be said of the other cases referred to, no such\r\nexplanation can possibly hold good for the Arabs. Among them, marriage\r\nwith a near relation involved no infringement of their marriage\r\nregulations. On the contrary, in spite of the opinions in favour of\r\nexogamy, the preference for marriage with a cousin was dominant among\r\nthem, and a man had even a right to the hand of his “bint ‘amm,” the\r\ndaughter of a paternal uncle.[2053]\r\n\r\nTaking all these facts into consideration, I cannot but believe that\r\nconsanguineous marriages, in some way or other, are more or less\r\ndetrimental to the species. And here, I think, we may find a quite\r\nsufficient explanation of the horror of incest; not because man at an\r\nearly stage recognized the injurious influence of close intermarriage,\r\nbut because the law of natural selection must inevitably have operated.\r\nAmong the ancestors of man, as among other animals, there was no doubt\r\na time when blood-relationship was no bar to sexual intercourse. But\r\nvariations, here as elsewhere, would naturally present themselves;\r\nand those of our ancestors who avoided in-and-in breeding would\r\nsurvive, while the others would gradually decay and ultimately perish.\r\nThus an instinct would be developed which would be powerful enough,\r\nas a rule, to prevent injurious unions. Of course it would display\r\nitself simply as an aversion on the part of individuals to union with\r\nothers with whom they lived; but these, as a matter of fact, would\r\nbe blood-relations, so that the result would be the survival of the\r\nfittest.\r\n\r\nWhether man inherited the feeling from the predecessors from whom he\r\nsprang, or whether it was developed after the evolution of distinctly\r\nhuman qualities, we do not know. It must necessarily have arisen at\r\na stage when family ties became comparatively strong, and children\r\nremained with their parents until the age of puberty, or even longer.\r\nExogamy, as a natural extension of this instinct, would arise when\r\nsingle families united in small hordes. It could not but grow up if\r\nthe idea of union between persons intimately associated with one\r\nanother was an object of innate repugnance. There is no real reason\r\nwhy we should assume, as so many anthropologists have done,[2054] that\r\nprimitive men lived in small endogamous communities, practising incest\r\nin every degree. The theory does not accord with what is known of the\r\ncustoms of existing savages; and it accounts for no facts which may not\r\nbe otherwise far more satisfactorily explained.\r\n\r\nThe objection will perhaps be made that the aversion to sexual\r\nintercourse between persons living very closely together from early\r\nyouth is too complicated a mental phenomenon to be a true instinct,\r\nacquired through spontaneous variations intensified by natural\r\nselection. But there are instincts just as complicated as this\r\nfeeling, which, in fact, only implies that disgust is associated with\r\nthe idea of sexual intercourse between persons who have lived in a\r\nlong-continued, intimate relationship from a period of life at which\r\nthe action of desire is naturally out of the question. This association\r\nis no matter of course, and certainly cannot be explained by the mere\r\nliking for novelty. It has all the characteristics of a real, powerful\r\ninstinct, and bears evidently a close resemblance to the aversion to\r\nsexual intercourse with individuals belonging to another species.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBesides the horror of incest, there is another feeling to which\r\nreference may here be made. “L’amour,” says Bernardin de\r\nSaint-Pierre, “ ... ne résulte que des contrastes; et plus ils sont\r\ngrands, plus il a d’énergie. C’est ce que je pourrois prouver par\r\nmille traits d’histoire.... L’influence des contrastes en amour est si\r\ncertaine, qu’en voyant l’amant on peut faire le portrait de l’objet\r\naimé sans l’avoir vu, pourvu qu’on sache seulement qu’il est affecté\r\nd’une forte passion.”[2055] Schopenhauer likewise observes that every\r\nperson requires from the individual of the opposite sex a one-sidedness\r\nwhich is the opposite of his or her own. The most manly man will seek\r\nthe most womanly woman, and _vice versa_. Weak or little men have a\r\ndecided inclination for strong or big women, and strong or big women\r\nfor weak or little men. Blondes prefer dark persons, or brunettes;\r\nsnub-nosed persons, hook-nosed; persons with excessively slim, long\r\nbodies and limbs, those who are stumpy and short; and so on.[2056]\r\nA similar view is held by M. Prosper Lucas, Mr. Alexander Walker,\r\nProfessor Mantegazza, Mr. Grant Allen, and other writers.[2057] “In\r\nthe love of the sexes,” says Professor Bain, “the charm of disparity\r\ngoes beyond the standing differences of sex; as in contrasts of\r\ncomplexion, and of stature.”[2058]\r\n\r\nSome writers have suggested that love thus excited by differences is\r\nfavourable to fecundity, those marriages in which it exists being more\r\nprolific than others.[2059] Thus Mr. Andrew Knight, a most experienced\r\nbreeder, remarks, “I am disposed to think that the most powerful\r\nhuman minds will be found offspring of parents of different hereditary\r\nconstitutions. I prefer a male of a different colour from the breed of\r\nthe female, where that can be obtained, and I think that I have seen\r\nfine children produced in more than one instance, where one family\r\nhas been dark and the other fair. I am sure that I have witnessed the\r\nbad effects of marriages between two individuals very similar to each\r\nother in character and colour, and springing from ancestry of similar\r\ncharacter. Such have appeared to me to be like marriages between\r\nbrothers and sisters.”[2060]\r\n\r\nThese statements, of course, prove nothing, but they may perhaps\r\nderive some value from the fact that they are made by so many different\r\nobservers. The statistical investigation of Professor Alphonse de\r\nCandolle, bearing upon the same question, rests on firmer ground. He\r\nhas found, from facts collected in Switzerland, North Germany, and\r\nBelgium, that marriages are most commonly contracted between persons\r\nwith different colours of the eye, except in the case of brown-eyed\r\nwomen, who are generally considered more attractive than others.[2061]\r\nHe has noted, further, that the number of children is considerably\r\nsmaller in families where the parents have the same colour of the eye\r\nthan where the reverse is the case.[2062] But Professor Wittrock could\r\nnot, in Sweden, find any such difference in fecundity between the two\r\ncategories of marriages;[2063] and Mr. Galton observes, “Whatever may\r\nbe the sexual preferences for similarity or for contrast, I find little\r\nindication in the average results obtained from a fairly large number\r\nof cases, of any single measurable personal peculiarity, whether it be\r\nstature, temper, eye-colour or artistic tastes, influencing marriage\r\nselection to a notable degree.”[2064]\r\n\r\nIf contrasts instinctively seek each other, this may partly account\r\nfor the readiness with which love awakens love. Every one knows some\r\nunhappy lover who has never been able to win the heart of the person\r\nhe adores; but in most cases, I should say, love is mutual. And this,\r\nperhaps, is owing not only to the contagiousness of the passion, but\r\nalso to the attractive power of contrasts, which acts equally upon both\r\nparties. Thus we might explain, to some extent, the extreme variation\r\nof tastes, and the fact that, besides the general standard of beauty\r\ncommon to the whole race, there exists a more detailed ideal special to\r\neach individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nSEXUAL SELECTION AS INFLUENCED BY AFFECTION AND SYMPATHY, AND BY\r\nCALCULATION\r\n\r\n\r\nSexual love is the passion which unites the sexes. The stimulating\r\nimpressions produced by health, youth, and beauty, and ornaments\r\nand other artificial means of attraction, are all elements of this\r\nfeeling. The antipathy to sexual intercourse with individuals of\r\nanother species, and the horror of incest, belong to the same\r\nphenomenon. But the psychology of love is by no means exhausted by\r\nthis. “Simple et primitif comme toutes les forces colossales,” says\r\nProfessor Mantegazza, “l’amour paraît pourtant formé des éléments de\r\ntoutes les passions humaines.”[2065] Around the sexual appetite as the\r\nleading element there are aggregated many different feelings, such as\r\nadmiration, pleasure of possession, love of freedom, self-esteem, and\r\nlove of approbation.[2066] A complete analysis of love would fill a\r\nvolume. Here I shall discuss only one of the most important elements of\r\nthis highly compound feeling, the sentiment of affection.\r\n\r\nIn the lower stages of human development sexual affection is much\r\ninferior in intensity to the tender feelings with which parents\r\nembrace their children; and among several peoples it seems to be almost\r\nunknown. Thus, speaking of the Hovas in Madagascar, Mr. Sibree says\r\nthat, among them, until the spread of Christianity, there was “no lack\r\nof strong affection between blood-relations—parents and children,\r\nbrothers and sisters, grandparents and grandchildren;” but the idea of\r\nlove between husband and wife was hardly thought of.[2067] On the Gold\r\nCoast, says Major Ellis, “love, as understood by the people of Europe,\r\nhas no existence.”[2068] At Winnebah, according to Mr. Duncan, “not\r\neven the appearance of affection exists between husband and wife;”\r\nand almost the same is asserted by M. Sabatier with reference to the\r\nKabyles, by Signor Bonfanti with reference to the Bantu race.[2069]\r\nMunzinger says that, among the Beni-Amer, it is considered even\r\ndisgraceful for a wife to show any affection for her husband.[2070]\r\nThe Chittagong Hill tribes, according to Captain Lewin, have “no idea\r\nof tenderness, nor of chivalrous devotion.” Marriage is among them\r\nregarded as merely a convenient and animal connection.[2071] In the\r\nIsland of Ponapé, according to Dr. Finsch, love in our sense of the\r\nterm is entirely unknown.[2072] As regards the Eskimo of Newfoundland,\r\nHeriot asserts, “Like all other men in the savage state, they treat\r\ntheir wives with great coldness and neglect, but their affection\r\ntowards their offspring is lively and tender.”[2073] In Greenland, a\r\nman thought nothing of beating his wife, but it was an heinous offence\r\nfor a mother to chastise her children.[2074] Almost the same is said\r\nof the Kutchin by Mr. Jones, and of the Eskimo of Norton Sound by Mr.\r\nDall.[2075] According to Mr. Morgan, the refined passion of love is\r\nunknown to the North American Indians in general.[2076]\r\n\r\nSuch statements, however, may easily be misleading. The love of a\r\nsavage is certainly very different from the love of a civilized man;\r\nnevertheless, we may discover in it traces of the same ingredients.\r\nThere are facts which tend to show that even very rude savages may have\r\nconjugal affection; nay, that among certain uncivilized peoples it has\r\nreached a remarkably high degree of development.\r\n\r\nAmong the wretched Bushmans, according to Mr. Chapman, there is love\r\nin all their marriages.[2077] Among the races of the Upper Congo, love\r\nis ennobled by a certain poetry;[2078] and with the Touaregs, there is\r\na touch of almost chivalrous sentiment in the relations between men\r\nand women.[2079] Regarding the man-eating Niam-Niam, Dr. Schweinfurth\r\nasserts that they display an affection for their wives which is\r\nunparalleled among other natives of an equally low grade.[2080]\r\n\r\nThe Hos are good husbands and wives, and although they have no terms\r\nin their own language to express the higher emotions, “they feel\r\nthem all the same.”[2081] The missionary Jellinghaus found tokens of\r\naffectionate love between married people among the Munda Kols, Mr.\r\nFawcett among the Savaras, Sir Spenser St. John among the Sea Dyaks,\r\nMr. Man among the Andamanese.[2082] In New Caledonia, says M. Moncelon,\r\n“l’amour existe, et j’ai vu des suicides par amour.”[2083] In Samoa,\r\nstories of affectionate love between husband and wife are preserved\r\nin song.[2084] In Tonga, according to Mariner, most of the women\r\nwere much attached to their husbands;[2085] and in Fiji, says Dr.\r\nSeemann, “even widowers, in the depth of their grief, have frequently\r\nterminated their existence, when deprived of a dearly beloved\r\nwife.”[2086] In several of the Australian tribes, married people are\r\noften much attached to each other, and continue to be so even when they\r\ngrow old.[2087] Concerning the aborigines of Victoria, Daniel Bunce\r\nsays it is an error to suppose that there exists no settled love or\r\nlasting affection between the sexes; among the Narrinyeri, Mr. Taplin\r\nhas known as well-matched and loving couples as he has among Europeans;\r\nand, according to Mr. Bonney, husband and wife among the natives of the\r\nRiver Darling, rarely quarrel, and “they show much affection for each\r\nother in their own way.”[2088]\r\n\r\nAmong the Eskimo of the north-east coast of North America, visited\r\nby Lyon, “young couples are frequently seen rubbing noses, their\r\nfavourite mark of affection, with an air of tenderness.”[2089]\r\nThe Tacullies, as Harman informs us, are remarkably fond of their\r\nwives.[2090] And Mr. Catlin goes even so far as to deny that the\r\nNorth American Indians are “in the least behind us in conjugal, in\r\nfilial, and in paternal affection,”[2091]—a statement with which Mr.\r\nMorgan does not agree. Mr. Brett asserts that, among the natives of\r\nGuiana, instances of conjugal attachment are very frequent.[2092] Azara\r\nand Mantegazza found tokens of it among some other South American\r\ntribes;[2093] and the rude Fuegians are said to “show a good deal of\r\naffection for their wives.”[2094]\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, impossible to believe that there ever was a time when\r\nconjugal affection was entirely wanting in the human race. Though\r\noriginally of far less intensity than parental love, especially on the\r\nmother’s side, as being of less importance for the existence of the\r\nspecies, yet it seems, in its most primitive form, to have been as\r\nold as marriage itself. It must be a certain degree of affection that\r\ninduces the male to defend the female during her period of pregnancy;\r\nbut often it is the joint care of the offspring, more than anything\r\nelse, that makes the married couple attached to each other. With\r\nreference to the Dacotahs, Mr. Prescott remarks that “as children\r\nincrease, the parents appear to be more affectionate.”[2095]\r\n\r\nOf course it is impossible to suppose that mutual love can generally\r\nbe the motive which leads to marriage when the wife is captured or\r\npurchased from a foreign tribe. In the main, Mr. Hall’s assertion\r\nas to the Eskimo visited by him, that “love—if it come at all—comes\r\nafter the marriage,”[2096] holds good for many savage peoples. Among\r\nthe Australians, for instance, according to Mr. Brough Smyth, love\r\nhas often no part in the preparations for marriage. “The bride is\r\ndragged from her home—she is unwilling to leave it; and if fears are\r\nentertained that she will endeavour to escape, a spear is thrust\r\nthrough her foot or her leg. A kind husband will, however, ultimately\r\nevoke affection, and fidelity and true love are not rare in Australian\r\nfamilies.”[2097]\r\n\r\nThe affection accompanying the union of the sexes has gradually\r\ndeveloped in proportion as altruism in general has increased. Thus\r\nlove has only slowly become the refined feeling it is in the heart of\r\na highly civilized European. In Eastern countries with their ancient\r\ncivilization there exists even now but little of that tenderness\r\ntowards the woman which is the principal charm of our own family life.\r\nIn China, up to recent times, it was considered “good form” for a\r\nman to beat his wife, and, if the Chinaman of humble rank spared her\r\na little, he did so only in order not to come under the necessity of\r\nbuying a successor.[2098] In Hindu families, according to Dubois,\r\nsincere mutual friendship is rarely met with. “It is in vain,” he\r\nsays, “to expect, between husband and wife, that reciprocal confidence\r\nand kindness which constitute the happiness of a family. The object for\r\nwhich a Hindu marries is not to gain a companion to aid him in enduring\r\nthe evils of life, but a slave to bear children and be subservient to\r\nhis rule.”[2099] The love of which the Persian poets sing has either\r\na symbolic or a very profane meaning.[2100] Among the Arabs, says\r\nBurckhardt, “the passion of love is, indeed, much talked of by the\r\ninhabitants of towns; but I doubt whether anything is meant by them\r\nmore than the grossest animal desire.”[2101] Mr. Finck remarks that\r\nin the whole of the Bible there is not a single reference to romantic\r\nlove.[2102] And even in Greece, according to some authorities, the love\r\nof the sexes was little more than sexual instinct.[2103]\r\n\r\nIt is also obvious that marriage cannot be contracted from affection\r\nwhere the young women before marriage are kept quite apart from the\r\nmen, as is done in Eastern countries. In China it often happens that\r\nthe parties have not even seen each other till the wedding-day; and,\r\nin Greece, custom was scarcely less rigorous in this respect.[2104] In\r\nvain Plato urged that young men and women should be more frequently\r\npermitted to meet one another, so that there should be less enmity and\r\nindifference in the married life.[2105] Plutarch hopes that love will\r\ncome after marriage.[2106]\r\n\r\nThe feeling which makes husband and wife true companions for better and\r\nworse can grow up only in societies where the altruistic sentiments\r\nof man are strong enough to make him recognize woman as his equal,\r\nand where she is not shut up as an exotic plant in a green-house, but\r\nis allowed to associate freely with men. In this direction European\r\ncivilization has been advancing for centuries, and there can be no\r\nreason to fear that it will ever be permanently diverted from the path\r\nby which alone some of the most important of its ends can be attained.\r\n\r\nWhen affection came to play a more prominent part in human sexual\r\nselection, higher regard was paid to intellectual, emotional, and moral\r\nqualities, through which the feeling is chiefly provoked. Later on, we\r\nshall see how great are the consequences which spring from this fact.\r\nFor the present it may be enough to say that the preference given\r\nto higher qualities by civilized men contributes much to the mental\r\nimprovement of the race. Dr. Stark observes that the intemperate,\r\nprofligate, and criminal classes do not commonly marry; and the like is\r\nto a large extent true of persons who are very inferior in intellect,\r\nemotions, and will.[2107]\r\n\r\nAffection depends in a very high degree upon sympathy. Though distinct\r\naptitudes, these two classes of emotions are most intimately connected:\r\naffection is strengthened by sympathy, and sympathy is strengthened by\r\naffection. Community of interests, opinions, sentiments, culture, and\r\nmode of life, as being essential to close sympathy,[2108] is therefore\r\nfavourable to warm affection. If love is excited by contrast, it is so\r\nonly within certain limits. The contrast must not be so great as to\r\nexclude sympathy.\r\n\r\nGreat difference of age is fatal to close sympathy. Wieland noted that\r\nmost people who fall in love do so with persons of about their own\r\nage;[2109] and statistics prove the observation to be correct. Men who\r\nmarry comparatively late in life usually avoid too great difference in\r\nage.[2110] The foundation of this admiration and preference, modified\r\nby age, says Mr. Walker, “appears to be the similarity of objects\r\nand interests which are inseparable from similar periods of life, the\r\nassociation of these with a similar intensity of sexual desire, the\r\nconsequent production of similar sympathy, and the resolve that it\r\nshall be permanent.”[2111]\r\n\r\nA very important factor is similarity in the degree of cultivation. It\r\nseldom happens that a “gentleman” falls in love with a peasant-girl,\r\nor an artizan with a “lady.” This does more than almost anything else\r\nto maintain the separation of the different classes, and to preserve\r\nthe existing distribution of wealth among the various groups of society.\r\n\r\nWant of sympathy prevents great divisions of human beings—such\r\nas different races or nations, hereditary castes, classes, and\r\nadherents of different religions—from intermarrying, even where\r\npersonal affection plays no part in the choice of the mate. Thus many\r\nuncivilized peoples carefully avoid marrying out of their own tribe,\r\nthe chief reason being, I think, the strong dislike which distinct\r\nsavage and barbarous nations have for one another. Mr. McLennan called\r\nsuch peoples “endogamous,” in contradistinction to peoples who are\r\n“exogamous,” _i.e._, do not marry within their own tribe or clan.\r\nBut this classification has caused much confusion, “exogamy” and\r\n“endogamy” not being real contraries. For there exists among every\r\npeople an outer circle—to use Sir Henry Maine’s very appropriate\r\nterminology—out of which marriage is either prohibited, or generally\r\navoided; as well as an inner circle, including the clan, or, at any\r\nrate, the very nearest kinsfolk, within which no marriage is allowed.\r\n\r\nLike the inner circle, the outer circle varies considerably in extent.\r\nRengger states that many of the Indian races of Paraguay are too\r\nproud to intermarry with any race of a different colour, or even of a\r\ndifferent stock.[2112] In Guiana and elsewhere, Indians do not readily\r\nintermix with negroes, whom they despise.[2113] Among the Isthmians\r\nof Central America, “marriage was not contracted with strangers or\r\npeople speaking a different language”;[2114] and in San Salvador,\r\naccording to Palacio, a man who had intercourse with a foreign woman\r\nwas killed.[2115] Mr. Powers informs us of a Californian tribe who\r\nwould put to death a woman for committing adultery with or marrying a\r\nwhite man;[2116] and among the Barolongs, a Bechuana tribe, the same\r\npunishment was formerly inflicted on any one who had intercourse with a\r\nEuropean.[2117] Among the Kabyles, “le mariage avec une négresse n’est\r\npas défendu en principe; mais la famille s’opposerait à une pareille\r\nunion.”[2118]\r\n\r\nThe Chinese, according to Mr. Jamieson, refuse marriage with the\r\nsurrounding barbarous tribes, with whom, as a rule, they have no\r\ndealings, either friendly or hostile.[2119] The black and fairer\r\npeople of the Philippines have from time immemorial dwelt in the same\r\ncountry without producing an intermediate race;[2120] the Bugis of\r\nPerak have kept themselves very distinct from the people among whom\r\nthey live;[2121] and, in Sumatra, it is a rare thing for a Malay man to\r\nmarry a Kubu woman.[2122] The Munda Kols severely punish a girl who is\r\nseduced by a Hindu, whereas intercourse with a man of their own people\r\nis regarded by most of them as quite a matter of course.[2123] And,\r\nin Ceylon, even those Veddahs who live in settlements, although they\r\nhave long associated with their neighbours, the Sinhalese, have not yet\r\nintermarried with them.[2124]\r\n\r\nCount de Gobineau remarks that not even a common religion and country\r\ncan extinguish the hereditary aversion of the Arab to the Turk, of\r\nthe Kurd to the Nestorian of Syria, of the Magyar to the Slav.[2125]\r\nIndeed, so strong, among the Arabs, is the instinct of ethnical\r\nisolation, that, as a traveller relates, at Djidda, where sexual\r\nmorality is held in little respect, a Bedouin woman may yield herself\r\nfor money to a Turk or European, but would think herself for ever\r\ndishonoured if she were joined to him in lawful wedlock.[2126]\r\n\r\nMarriages between Lapps and Swedes very rarely occur, being looked upon\r\nas dishonourable by both peoples. They are equally uncommon between\r\nLapps and Norwegians, and it hardly ever happens that a Lapp marries\r\na Russian.[2127] At various times, Spaniards in Central America,\r\nEnglishmen in Mauritius, Frenchmen in Réunion and the Antilles, and\r\nDanish traders in Greenland, have been prevented by law from marrying\r\nnatives.[2128] Among the Hebrews, during the early days of their\r\npower and dominion, marriages with aliens seem to have been rare\r\nexceptions.[2129] The Romans were prohibited from marrying barbarians;\r\nValentinian inflicted the penalty of death for such unions.[2130]\r\nTacitus was of opinion that the Germans refused marriage with foreign\r\nnations,[2131] and the like seems to have been the case with the\r\nSlavs.[2132]\r\n\r\nAmong several peoples marriage very seldom, or never, takes place even\r\noutside the territory of the tribe or community. This is the case\r\nwith many tribes of Guatemala,[2133] the Ahts,[2134] Navajos,[2135]\r\nand Pueblos.[2136] In the village of Schawill, in Southern Mexico,\r\naccording to Mr. Stephens, “every member must marry within the rancho,\r\nand no such thing as a marriage out of it had ever occurred. They\r\nsaid it was impossible, it could not happen.... This was a thing so\r\nlittle apprehended that the punishment for it was not defined in their\r\npenal code; but being questioned, after some consultations, they said\r\nthat the offender, whether man or woman, would be expelled.”[2137]\r\nSpeaking of the Chaymas in New Andalusia, among whom marriages are\r\ncontracted between the inhabitants of the same hamlet only,[2138]\r\nv. Humboldt says, “Savage nations are subdivided into an infinity\r\nof tribes, which, bearing a cruel hatred toward each other, form no\r\nintermarriages, even when their languages spring from the same root,\r\nand when only a small arm of a river, or a group of hills, separates\r\ntheir habitations.”[2139] This holds good especially for several of\r\nthe Brazilian tribes.[2140] In ancient Peru it was not lawful for the\r\nnatives of one province or village to marry those of another.[2141]\r\n\r\nIn Equatorial Africa, according to Mr. Du Chaillu, the non-cannibal\r\ntribes do not intermarry with their cannibal neighbours, whose peculiar\r\npractices are held in abhorrence.[2142] Barrow states that the\r\nHottentots always marry within their own kraal;[2143] and a Bushman\r\nwoman would regard intercourse with any one out of the tribe, no matter\r\nhow superior, as a degradation.[2144] Among the Hovas, the different\r\ntribes, clans, and even families as a rule do not intermarry, as Mr.\r\nSibree says, “in order to keep landed property together, as well as\r\nfrom a strong clannish feeling.”[2145] Mr. Swann informs me that, among\r\nthe Waguha, of West Tanganyika, marriages out of the tribe are avoided,\r\nthough not prohibited; and Archdeacon Hodgson writes that this is very\r\noften the case in Eastern Central Africa.\r\n\r\nIn India there are several instances of tribe-or clan-endogamy.[2146]\r\nThe Tipperahs and Abors, for example, view with abhorrence the idea of\r\ntheir girls marrying out of their own clan,[2147] and Colonel Dalton\r\nwas gravely assured that, “when one of the daughters of Pádam so\r\ndemeans herself, the sun and the moon refuse to shine, and there is\r\nsuch a strife in the elements that all labour is necessarily suspended,\r\ntill by sacrifice and oblation the stain is washed away.”[2148] The\r\nAinos not only despise the Japanese as much as the Japanese despise\r\nthem, but are not very sociable even among themselves: one village\r\ndoes not like to marry into another.[2149] The same may be said of\r\nthe Sermatta Islanders;[2150] whilst the Minahassers,[2151] the\r\nDyaks,[2152] and the natives of New Guinea[2153] and New Britain,[2154]\r\nas a general rule, marry within their own tribe. Among the New\r\nZealanders, according to Mr. Yate, “great opposition is made to any\r\none taking, except for some political purpose, a wife from another\r\ntribe,” and marriage generally takes place between relatives.[2155]\r\nIn Australia there are groups of tribes, so-called associated tribes,\r\ngenerally speaking the same dialect, who are in the habit of uniting\r\nfor common defence and other purposes. Marriage between the members\r\nof associated tribes is the rule,[2156] but many tribes are mostly\r\nendogamous.[2157]\r\n\r\nIn ancient Wales, according to Mr. Lewis, marriage was to be within\r\nthe clan.[2158] At Athens, at least in its later history, if an alien\r\nlived as a husband with an Athenian woman, he was liable to be sold\r\nas a slave, and to have his property confiscated; and, if an Athenian\r\nlived with a foreign woman, she was liable to like consequences, and he\r\nto a penalty of a thousand drachmæ.[2159] Marriage with foreign women\r\nwas unlawful for all Spartans, and was made unlawful for the Heraclidæ\r\nby a separate rhetra.[2160] At Rome, any marriage of a citizen with\r\na woman who was not herself a Roman citizen, or did not belong to a\r\ncommunity possessing the privilege of _connubium_ with Rome—which was\r\nalways expressly conferred—was invalid; no legitimate children could\r\nbe born of such a marriage.[2161] In early times it was even customary\r\nfor a father to seek, for his daughter, a husband from his own _gens_,\r\nmarriage out of it being mentioned as an extraordinary thing.[2162]\r\n\r\nProhibitions of intermarriage do not refer only to persons belonging\r\nto different nations or tribes; very often they relate also to persons\r\nbelonging to different classes or castes of the same community. Yet\r\nin many, perhaps most, cases these prohibitions originally coincided.\r\nCastes are frequently, if not always, the consequences of foreign\r\nconquest and subjugation, the conquerors becoming the nobility, and the\r\nsubjugated the commonalty or slaves. Thus, before the Norman conquest,\r\nthe English aristocracy was Saxon; after it, Norman. The descendants of\r\nthe German conquerors of Gaul were, for a thousand years, the dominant\r\nrace in France; and until the fifteenth century all the higher nobility\r\nwere of Frankish or Burgundian origin.[2163] The Sanskrit word for\r\ncaste is “varna,” _i.e._, colour, which shows how the distinction\r\nof high and low caste arose in India. That country was inhabited by\r\ndark races before the fairer Aryans took possession of it; and the\r\nbitter contempt of the Aryans for foreign tribes, their domineering\r\nspirit, and their strong antipathies of race and of religion, found\r\nvent in the pride of class and caste distinctions. Even to this day\r\na careful observer can distinguish the descendants of conquerors and\r\nconquered. “No sojourner in India,” says Dr. Stevenson, “can have\r\npaid any attention to the physiognomy of the higher and lower orders\r\nof natives without being struck with the remarkable difference that\r\nexists in the shape of the head, the build of the body, and the colour\r\nof the skin between the higher and the lower castes into which the\r\nHindu population is divided.”[2164] This explanation of the origin\r\nof Indian castes is supported by the fact that it is in some of the\r\nlatest Vedic hymns that we find the earliest references to those four\r\nclasses—the Brahmans, the Kshatriyas, the Vaiśyas, and the Śudras—to\r\nwhich all the later castes have been traced back.[2165] The Incas\r\nof Peru were known as a conquering race; and the ancient Mexicans\r\nrepresented the culture-heroes of the Toltecs as white.[2166] Among the\r\nBeni-Amer, the nobles are mostly light coloured, while the commoners\r\nare blackish.[2167] The Polynesian nobility have a comparatively fair\r\ncomplexion,[2168] and seem to be the descendants of a conquering\r\nor superior race. “The chiefs, and persons of hereditary rank and\r\ninfluence in the islands,” says Ellis, “are, almost without exception,\r\nas much superior to the peasantry or common people, in stateliness,\r\ndignified deportment, and physical strength, as they are in rank\r\nand circumstances; although they are not elected to their station\r\non account of their personal endowments, but derive their rank and\r\nelevation from their ancestry. This is the case with most of the\r\ngroups of the Pacific, but particularly so in Tahiti and the adjacent\r\nislands.”[2169] Among the Shans, according to Dr. Anderson, “the\r\nmajority of the higher classes seemed to be distinguished from the\r\ncommon people by more elongated oval faces and a decidedly Tartar type\r\nof countenance.”[2170] In America, at the time of the earliest European\r\nimmigration, a kind of caste distinction arose, white blood being\r\nsynonymous with nobility; and, in La Plata, Spaniards, Mestizoes, and\r\nIndians were separated from each other even in church.[2171]\r\n\r\nAs descendants of different ancestors, members of noble families\r\nkeep up their separate position, and remain almost as foreigners to\r\nthe people among whom they live. Speculating on the want of sympathy\r\namong the various classes in societies in which such distinctions\r\nare recognized, Count de Tocqueville says, “Each caste has its own\r\nopinions, feelings, rights, manners, and modes of living. Thus the\r\nmen of whom each caste is composed do not resemble the mass of their\r\nfellow-citizens; they do not think or feel in the same manner, and they\r\nscarcely believe that they belong to the same human race.... When the\r\nchroniclers of the Middle Ages, who all belonged to the aristocracy by\r\nbirth or education, relate the tragical end of a noble, their grief\r\nflows apace; whereas they tell you at a breath, and without wincing,\r\nof massacres and tortures inflicted on the common sort of people. Not\r\nthat these writers felt habitual hatred or systematic disdain for the\r\npeople; war between the several classes of the community was not yet\r\ndeclared. They were impelled by an instinct rather than by a passion;\r\nas they had formed no clear notion of a poor man’s sufferings, they\r\ncared but little for his fate.” Then, in proof of this, the writer\r\ngives extracts from Madame de Sévigné’s letters, displaying a cruel\r\njocularity which, in our day, “the harshest man writing to the most\r\ninsensible person of his acquaintance” would not venture wantonly to\r\nindulge in; and yet Madame de Sévigné was not selfish or cruel: she was\r\npassionately attached to her children, and ever ready to sympathize\r\nwith her friends, and she treated her servants and vassals with\r\nkindness and indulgence.[2172]\r\n\r\nIt is to this want of affection and sympathy between the different\r\nlayers of society, together with the vain desire of keeping the blood\r\npure, that the prohibition of marriage out of the class, or the general\r\navoidance of such marriages, owes its origin. Among the Ahts, for\r\ninstance, who take great pride in honourable birth, a patrician loses\r\ncaste unless he marries a woman of corresponding rank, in his own or\r\nanother tribe.[2173] Among the Isthmians of Central America, the lords\r\nmarried only the daughters of noble blood; and, in Guatemala, marriage\r\nwith a slave reduced the freeman to a slave’s condition.[2174] The\r\ntribes of Brazil also consider such alliances highly disgraceful.[2175]\r\n\r\nNowhere are the different orders of society more distinctly separated\r\nfrom each other than in the South Sea Islands. In the Marianne group,\r\nit was the common belief that only the nobles were endowed with an\r\nimmortal soul; and a nobleman who married a girl of the people was\r\npunished with death.[2176] In Polynesia also, the commoners were looked\r\nupon by the nobility almost as a different species of beings.[2177]\r\nHence in the higher ranks marriage was concluded only between persons\r\nof corresponding position; and if, in Tahiti, a woman of condition\r\nchose an inferior person as a husband, the children he had by her were\r\nkilled.[2178] In the Indian Archipelago, marriages between persons\r\nof different rank are, as a rule, disapproved, and in some places\r\nthey are prohibited.[2179] Among the Hovas of Madagascar, the three\r\ngreat divisions—the nobles, the commoners, and the slaves,—with few\r\nexceptions, cannot intermarry; neither do the three different classes\r\nof slaves marry each other.[2180] Almost the same rule holds good for\r\nthe different orders of the Beni-Amer and Marea;[2181] whilst, among\r\nthe Tedâ, the smiths form an hereditary and utterly despised caste by\r\nthemselves, being obliged to marry solely with members of their own\r\ncaste.[2182] By several African peoples, however, slaves and freemen\r\nare allowed to intermarry.[2183]\r\n\r\nThe Aenezes of Arabia never intermarry with the “szona,”\r\nhandicraftsmen or artizans; nor do they ever marry their daughters to\r\nFellahs, or to inhabitants of towns.[2184] In India, intermarriage\r\nbetween different castes was in Manu’s time permissible, but is now\r\naltogether prohibited. Of the original four castes, the Brahmans\r\nalone have retained their purity to any extent, but there is an almost\r\nendless number of trade-castes, resulting chiefly from associations\r\nof men engaged in the same occupation.[2185] Moreover, as Sir Monier\r\nWilliams remarks, “we find castes within castes, so that even the\r\nBrahmans are broken up and divided into numerous races, which again\r\nare subdivided into numerous tribes, families, or sub-castes ... which\r\ndo not intermarry.”[2186] Class-endogamy prevails in Ceylon,[2187]\r\nSiam,[2188] and Corea;[2189] and in the Chittagong district, when a\r\nslave marries, the person chosen must be a slave.[2190] In China,\r\nplay-actors, policemen, boatmen, and slaves are not allowed to\r\nmarry women of any other class than that to which they respectively\r\nbelong.[2191] And in Japan, before the year 1868, when a new order\r\nof things was introduced, the different classes of nobles were not\r\npermitted to intermarry with each other or with common people.[2192]\r\n\r\nIn Europe there have been similar prohibitions. In Rome, plebeians\r\nand patricians could not intermarry till the year 455 B.C., nor were\r\nmarriages allowed between patricians and clients. Cicero himself\r\ndisapproved of intermarriages of _ingenui_ and freedmen, and, though\r\nsuch alliances were generally permitted under the Emperors, yet a\r\nsenator could not marry a freed-woman, nor a patroness her liberated\r\nslave. Between freemen and slaves _contubernium_ could take place, but\r\nnot marriage.[2193] Among the Teutonic peoples, in ancient times, any\r\nfreeman who had intercourse with a slave was punished with slavery, and\r\na woman guilty of such a crime might be killed. In the Scandinavian\r\ncountries, slavery came to an end at a comparatively early period, but\r\nin Germany it was succeeded by serfdom; and equality of birth continued\r\nto be regarded as an indispensable condition of lawful marriage. As\r\nlate as the thirteenth century any German woman who had intercourse\r\nwith a serf lost her liberty.[2194] From the class of freemen, both\r\nin Germany and in Scandinavia, the nobility gradually emerged as a\r\ndistinct order, and marriages between persons of noble birth and\r\npersons who, although free, were not noble, came to be considered\r\nmisalliances.[2195] In Sweden, in the seventeenth century, such\r\nmarriages were punished.[2196]\r\n\r\nModern civilization tends to pull down the barriers which separate\r\nthe various classes of society, just as it tends to diminish the\r\ndifferences in interests, habits, sentiments, and knowledge. Birth no\r\nlonger determines to the same extent as before a man’s social position,\r\nand nobility has become a shadow of what it was. Thus there survive\r\nbut few traces of the former class-endogamy. According to German Civil\r\nLaw, the marriage of a man belonging to the high nobility with a woman\r\nof inferior birth is still regarded as a _disparagium_; and the woman\r\nis not entitled to the rank of her husband, nor is the full right of\r\ninheritance possessed by her or by her children.[2197] Although in\r\nno way prevented by law, marriages out of the class are generally\r\navoided by custom. “The outer or endogamous limit, within which a man\r\nor woman must marry,” says Sir Henry Maine, “has been mostly taken\r\nunder the shelter of fashion or prejudice. It is but faintly traced in\r\nEngland, though not wholly obscured. It is (or perhaps was) rather more\r\ndistinctly marked in the United States, through prejudices against the\r\nblending of white and coloured blood. But in Germany certain hereditary\r\ndignities are still forfeited by a marriage beyond the forbidden\r\nlimits; and in France, in spite of all formal institutions, marriages\r\nbetween a person belonging to the _noblesse_ and a person belonging\r\nto the _bourgeoisie_ (distinguished roughly from one another by the\r\nparticle ‘de’) are wonderfully rare, though they are not unknown.[2198]\r\n\r\nDifferent nations, like the different classes of society, have been\r\ngradually drawing nearer to each other. National prejudices have\r\ndiminished, and international sympathy has increased. During the\r\nMiddle Ages a foreigner was called in Germany “ein Elender,” because\r\nhe stood outside the law;[2199] to-day he enjoys the protection of\r\nthe law in all civilized countries, and is not as a foreigner an\r\nobject of prejudice. This widening of sympathy, and improved means of\r\ncommunication, have of course made intermarriages between the several\r\nnations much more common than they used to be.\r\n\r\nReligion, finally, has formed a great bar to intermarriage. In British\r\nIndia, the descendants of all the Mohammedan races—Arab, Iranian,\r\nTuranian, Mongol, and Hindu converts—intermarry, but there are few\r\nunions between Christian men and Mohammedan women.[2200] Indeed,\r\naccording to Mr. Lane, such a marriage is not permitted under any\r\ncircumstances, and cannot take place otherwise than by force. On the\r\nother hand, it is held lawful for a Mohammedan to marry a Christian or\r\na Jewish woman, if induced to do so by excessive love of her, or if he\r\ncannot obtain a wife of his own religion. In this case, however, the\r\noffspring must follow the father’s faith, and the wife does not inherit\r\nwhen the husband dies.[2201] Marriage with a heathen woman is never\r\npermitted to a Mussulman.[2202]\r\n\r\nIt is mainly religion that has kept the Jews a relatively pure race.\r\n“The Jew,” says Dr. Neubauer, “has no preference for, or any aversion\r\nfrom, one race or another, provided he can marry a woman of his\r\nreligion, and _vice versa_.”[2203] Indeed, the Jewish law does not\r\nrecognize marriage with a person of another belief,[2204] though there\r\nare instances of such marriages in the early days of Israel.[2205]\r\nDuring the Middle Ages, marriage between Jews and Christians was\r\nprohibited by the Christians also, and universally avoided.[2206]\r\n“The folk-lore of Europe,” Mr. Jacobs remarks, “regarded the Jews as\r\nsomething infra-human, and it would require an almost impossible amount\r\nof large toleration for a Christian maiden of the Middle Ages to regard\r\nunion with a Jew as anything other than unnatural.” Mr. Jacobs thinks\r\nit may be doubted whether even at the present day there is one mixed\r\nmarriage to five hundred pure Jewish marriages.[2207]\r\n\r\nSt. Paul indicates that a Christian was not allowed to marry a\r\nheathen,[2208] and Tertullian calls such an alliance fornication.[2209]\r\nIn early times, the Church often encouraged marriages of this sort as\r\na means of propagating Christianity, and it was only when its success\r\nwas beyond doubt that it actually prohibited them.[2210] The Council\r\nof Elvira expressly forbade Christian parents to give their daughters\r\nin marriage to heathens, ordering that those who did so should be\r\nexcommunicated.[2211]\r\n\r\nEven the adherents of different Christian confessions have been\r\nprohibited from intermarrying. In the Roman Church the prohibition of\r\nmarriage with heathens and Jews (_impedimentum cultus disparitatis_)\r\nwas soon followed by the prohibition of “mixed marriages”\r\n(_impedimentum mixtae religionis_); and the Protestants also originally\r\nforbade such unions. The Greek Church, on the other hand, made in this\r\nrespect a distinction between _schismatici_, or those who dissent from\r\nthe Church in non-essential points only, and _haeretici_, or those who\r\ndissent from its fundamental doctrines.[2212] Mixed marriages are not\r\nnow contrary to the civil law either in Roman Catholic or in Protestant\r\ncountries; but in countries belonging to the Orthodox Greek Church the\r\necclesiastical restrictions have been adopted by the State. In Russia,\r\nGreece, and Servia, Roman Catholics and Protestants are regarded as\r\n_schismatici_ but in the Turkish countries as _haeretici_.[2213] It is\r\nnoteworthy that, in countries which are partly Roman Catholic, partly\r\nProtestant, mixed marriages form only a comparatively small percentage\r\nof the whole number of marriages.[2214]\r\n\r\nIn no respect has modern civilization acted more beneficently than as\r\na promoter of religious toleration. In our time difference of faith\r\ndiscourages sympathy to a much less extent than it did in former ages.\r\nHence the number of mixed marriages everywhere tends to increase. In\r\nBavaria, for instance, they amounted in 1835-1850 to 2·8 per cent.\r\nof the whole number of marriages, in 1850-1860 to 3·6 per cent., in\r\n1860-1870 to 4·4 per cent., in 1870-1875 to 5·6 per cent., and in\r\n1876-1877 to 6·6 per cent.[2215]\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, civilization has narrowed the inner limit, within\r\nwhich a man or woman must not marry, it has widened the outer limit\r\nwithin which a man or woman _may_ marry, and generally marries.\r\nThe latter of these processes has been one of vast importance in\r\nman’s history. Originating in race-or caste-pride, or in religious\r\nintolerance, the endogamous rules have, in their turn, helped to keep\r\nup and strengthen these feelings. Law is by nature conservative,\r\nmaintaining sentiments developed under past conditions. It is only\r\nby slow degrees that the ideas of a new time become strong enough to\r\nrelease mankind from ancient prejudices.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto dealt only with the poetry of sexual selection—love;\r\nnow something is to be said of its prose—dry calculation. And we may\r\nconveniently begin with man’s appreciation of woman’s fertility,\r\nas this has some of the characteristics of an instinct. Desire for\r\noffspring is universal in mankind. Abortion, indeed, is practised now\r\nand then, and infanticide frequently takes place among many savage\r\npeoples; but these facts do not disprove the general rule.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Crees, Chippewyans, and other Indians on the eastern\r\nside of the Rocky Mountains, Harmon says that “all Indians are\r\nvery desirous of having a numerous offspring.”[2216] Among the\r\nIngaliks, “children are anxiously desired, even when women have\r\nno husbands.”[2217] Among the Mayas, disappointed couples prayed\r\nearnestly, and brought many offerings to propitiate the god whose\r\nanger was supposed to have deferred their hopes.[2218] “Be numerous\r\nin offspring and descendants,” is a frequent marriage benediction or\r\nsalutation in Madagascar; for to die without posterity is looked upon\r\nas a great calamity, and is termed “dead as regards the eye.”[2219] A\r\nnegro considers childlessness the greatest disaster which can happen\r\nto him;[2220] Bosman once asked one of the king’s captains in Fida how\r\nmany children he had, and he answered, sighing, that he was so unhappy\r\nas not to have many—he could not pretend to have had above seventy,\r\nincluding those who were dead. Among the Waganda and Wanyoro, great\r\nrejoicings take place in the case of the birth of twins.[2221] The\r\nShaman heathens of Siberia regarded an abundance of children and cattle\r\nas the most essential condition of a man’s happiness.[2222] “Honest\r\npeople have many children,” a Japanese proverb says;[2223] the Chinese\r\nregard a large family of sons as a mark of the divine favour;[2224]\r\nand to become the father of a son is described in Indian poems as the\r\ngreatest happiness which may fall to the share of a mortal.[2225] In\r\nPersia, childlessness is considered the most horrible calamity.[2226]\r\nOne of the chief blessings that Moses in the name of God promised the\r\nIsraelites was a numerous progeny; and the ancient Romans regarded the\r\nprocreation of legitimate children as the real end of marriage.[2227]\r\n“He who has no children, has no happiness either,” the South\r\nSlavonians say;[2228] and German folk-lore compares a marriage without\r\noffspring with a world without sun.[2229]\r\n\r\nA woman therefore is valued not only as a wife but as a mother.\r\nNowhere has greater stress been laid on this idea than in ancient\r\nLacedaemon. A husband, if he considered that the unfruitfulness of\r\nthe marriage was owing to himself, gave his matrimonial rights to a\r\nyounger man, whose child then belonged to the husband’s family; and\r\nto the wives of men who, for example, fell in battle before having\r\nchildren, other men, probably slaves, were assigned, that there might\r\nbe heirs and successors to the deceased husband.[2230] Among many\r\npeoples the respect in which a woman is held is proportionate to\r\nher fecundity,[2231] and a barren wife is frequently despised as an\r\nunnatural and useless being.[2232] In Angola, according to Livingstone,\r\nin the native dances, “when any one may wish to deride another, in the\r\naccompanying song a line is introduced, 'So and so has no children, and\r\nnever will get any.’” The offended woman feels the insult so keenly\r\nthat it is not uncommon for her to rush away and commit suicide.[2233]\r\nAmong the Creeks, a man always calls his wife his son’s mother;[2234]\r\nand, among the Todas, in addressing a man with the casual question,\r\n“Are you married?” the ordinary way of putting it would be to say,\r\n“Is there a son?”[2235]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, then, that fecundity must be one of the qualities which\r\na man most eagerly requires from his bride. Mr. Reade tells us that,\r\nin certain parts of Africa, especially in malarious localities, where\r\nwomen are so frequently sterile, no one cares to marry a girl till she\r\nhas borne a child; and among the Votyaks, according to Dr. Buch, a girl\r\ngets married sooner if she is a mother.[2236]\r\n\r\nWe have seen several instances of husband and wife not living together\r\nas married people before the birth of a child. Among the Creeks,\r\nmarriages were contracted for a year, but if they proved fruitful,\r\nthey were, as a rule, renewed.[2237] Again, with regard to an order of\r\nthe Essenes, Josephus states that, considering succession to be the\r\nprincipal part of human life, they tried their spouses for three years,\r\nand then married them only if there was a prospect of the union being\r\nfruitful.[2238] Among many peoples it is the practice for a man to\r\nrepudiate a barren wife.\r\n\r\nThe desire for offspring, with its consequence, the appreciation of\r\nfemale fecundity, is due to various causes. First, there is in man\r\nan instinct for reproduction. Mr. Marshall remarks, “Of this desire\r\nfor progeny I have seen many examples amongst the Todas, so strongly\r\nmarked, but to all appearances apart from the sense of personal\r\nambition, and separate from any demands of religion or requirements for\r\nsupport in old age, as to give the impression that it was the primitive\r\nfaculty of Philoprogenitiveness, acting so insensibly, naturally, as\r\nto have the character more of a plain instinct, than of an intelligent\r\nhuman feeling.”[2239] With this instinct a feeling of parental pride\r\nis associated. “Children,” says Hobbes, “are a man’s power and his\r\nhonour.”[2240]\r\n\r\nAmong the Hebrews and the ancient Aryan nations, the desire for\r\noffspring, particularly sons, had its root chiefly in religious belief,\r\nbeing a natural outcome of the idea that the spirits of the dead were\r\nmade happy by homage received at the hands of their male posterity.\r\nThe same is the case with the Chinese[2241] and Japanese,[2242] and\r\nperhaps, to a certain extent, with some peoples at a lower stage of\r\ncivilization. The savage believes that the life which goes on after\r\ndeath, differs in nothing from this life, that wants and pursuits\r\nremain as before, that consequently the dead man’s spirit eats and\r\ndrinks, and needs fire for warmth and cooking. It is, of course, his\r\nsurviving descendants who have to see that he is well provided for in\r\nthese respects. Hence the offerings to deceased ancestors for various\r\nperiods after death and the feasts for the dead.[2243] Among the\r\nThlinkets according to Holmberg, it sometimes happens that a man spends\r\nhis whole fortune as well as his wife’s marriage portion on such a\r\nfeast, and has to live as a poor man for the rest of his life.[2244]\r\n\r\nBut no doubt children are most eagerly longed for by savage men because\r\nthey are of use to him in his lifetime. They are easily supported when\r\nyoung, and in times of want they may be left to die or be sold. When\r\na few years old, the sons become able to hunt, fish, and paddle, and\r\nlater on they are their father’s companions in war. The daughters help\r\ntheir mother to provide food, and, when grown up, they are lucrative\r\nobjects of trade. Finally, when old, the parents would often suffer\r\nwant had they not their children to support them.[2245] Hence, in\r\na savage condition of life, children are the chief wealth of the\r\nfamily. And the same is the case at somewhat higher stages of social\r\ndevelopment. Mr. Lane remarks that, in Egypt, “at the age of five or\r\nsix years, the children become of use to tend the flocks and herds; and\r\nat a more advanced age, until they marry, they assist their fathers in\r\nthe operations of agriculture. The poor in Egypt have often to depend\r\nentirely upon their sons for support in their old age; but many parents\r\nare deprived of these aids, and consequently reduced to beggary, or\r\nalmost to starvation.”[2246] To a certain extent, this holds good for\r\nthe uneducated classes in Europe also.\r\n\r\nWith the progress of civilization the desire for offspring has\r\nbecome less intense. The religious motive has of course died out in\r\nthe Christian world, and, in proportion as social life becomes more\r\ncomplicated, and a professional education becomes more necessary for\r\nsuccess in the struggle for existence, children, at least in “the\r\nupper classes” and among towns-people, put their parents to expense\r\ninstead of being a source of wealth. A childless couple may indeed,\r\ndeplore the absence of children; but a woman is no longer held in\r\nrespect only, or principally, as a mother; and marriage, according to\r\nmodern ideas, is something more than an institution for the procreation\r\nof legitimate offspring. Yet it is remarkable that, in Switzerland,\r\nalthough barrenness is no sufficient reason for a man to repudiate his\r\nwife, two-fifths of the total number of divorces take place between\r\nmarried people who have no children whilst the sterile marriages amount\r\nonly to one-fifth of the number of marriages.[2247]\r\n\r\nA wife is of use to her husband not merely because she gives him\r\nlabourers, but also because she herself is a labourer. Drying\r\nand preparing fish and meat, lighting and attending to the fire,\r\ntransporting baggage, picking berries, dressing hides and making\r\nclothes, cooking food and taking care of the children—these are, in\r\nthe savage state, the chief pursuits of a wife. Among agricultural\r\nand cattle-farming peoples, she has besides, to cultivate the soil\r\nand to tend the cattle. A wife, therefore, is chosen partly because\r\nof her ability to perform such duties. Thus, among the Greenlanders,\r\ncleverness in sewing and skill in the management of household affairs\r\nare the most attractive qualities of a woman.[2248] Among other Eskimo\r\ntribes and in Tierra del Fuego, middle-aged men will connect themselves\r\nwith old women who are best able to take care of their common\r\ncomforts.[2249] The Inland Columbians, according to Mr. Bancroft, make\r\n“capacity for work the standard of female excellence;”[2250] and,\r\namong the Turkomans, young widows fetch double the price of spinsters,\r\nbecause they are more accustomed to hard labour, and more experienced\r\nin household concerns.[2251]\r\n\r\nA husband’s function is to protect his family from enemies and to\r\nprevent them falling into distress. A woman, as we have already seen,\r\neven instinctively prefers a courageous and strong man to one who is\r\ncowardly and feeble. But reflection also makes her choose a man who\r\nis well able to defend her and to provide food. Among the Comanches,\r\nsays Mr. Parker, “young girls are not averse to marry very old men,\r\nparticularly if they are chiefs, as they are always sure of something\r\nto eat.”[2252]\r\n\r\nAt more advanced stages of civilization, money and inherited property\r\noften take the place of skill, strength, and working ability. Thus,\r\nwife-purchase and husband-purchase, still persist in modern society,\r\nthough in disguised forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE BY CAPTURE AND MARRIAGE BY PURCHASE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe practice of capturing wives prevails in various parts of the world,\r\nand traces of it are met with in the marriage ceremonies of several\r\npeoples, indicating that it occurred much more frequently in past ages.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the inhabitants of Unimak, Coxe says that they invaded the\r\nother Aleutian islands, and carried off women—the chief object of their\r\nincursions.[2253] Among the Ahts, a man occasionally steals a wife\r\nfrom the women of his own tribe;[2254] whilst the Bonaks of California\r\nusually take women in battle from other tribes, and the Macas Indians\r\nof Ecuador acquire wives by purchase, if the woman belongs to the\r\nsame tribe, but otherwise by force.[2255] All the Carib tribes used\r\nto capture women from different peoples and tribes, so that the men\r\nand women nowhere spoke the same tongue;[2256] and v. Martius states\r\nthat, in Brazil, “some tribes habitually steal their neighbours’\r\ndaughters.”[2257]\r\n\r\nAmong the Mosquito Indians, after the wedding is all arranged and\r\nthe presents paid, the bridegroom seizes his bride and carries her\r\noff, followed by her female relatives, who pretend to try to rescue\r\nher.[2258] The Araucanians considered the carrying off of the bride by\r\npretended violence an essential prerequisite to the nuptials, and,\r\naccording to Mr. E. R. Smith, it is even “a point of honour with the\r\nbride to resist and struggle, however willing she may be.”[2259] The\r\nUaupés “have no particular ceremony at their marriages, except that of\r\nalways carrying away the girl by force, or making a show of doing so,\r\neven when she and her parents are quite willing.”[2260] Almost the same\r\nis said of the Fuegians, though among them the capture is sometimes\r\nmore than a ceremony.[2261]\r\n\r\nAndersson remarks that, among the Bushmans, woman is only too often\r\n_belli teterrima causa_.[2262] Speaking of the Bechuanas, Mr. Conder\r\nsays, “As regards wedding ceremonies, there is one of casting an\r\narrow into the hut by the bridegroom, which is worthy of notice\r\nas symbolic.”[2263] Among the Wakamba, marriage is an affair of\r\npurchase, but the bridegroom “must then carry off the bride by force\r\nor stratagem.”[2264] The Wa-taïta and Wa-chaga of Eastern Equatorial\r\nAfrica have also a marriage ceremony of capture;[2265] and the like is\r\nthe case with the Inland Negroes mentioned by Lord Kames,[2266] and the\r\nAbyssinians.[2267] Among the tribes of Eastern Central Africa described\r\nby Mr. Macdonald, marriage by capture occurs not as a symbol only.[2268]\r\n\r\nAccording to a common belief, the Australian method of obtaining\r\nwives is capture in its most brutal form.[2269] But contrary to Mr.\r\nHowitt,[2270] Mr. Curr informs us that only on rare occasions is a wife\r\ncaptured from another tribe, and carried off.[2271] The possession of\r\na stolen woman would lead to constant attacks, hence the tribes set\r\nthemselves very generally against the practice.[2272] Even elopements,\r\naccording to Mr. Mathew, are now usually more fictitious than\r\nreal;[2273] but there are strong reasons for believing that formerly,\r\nwhen the continent was only partially occupied, elopements from within\r\nthe tribe frequently occurred.[2274]\r\n\r\nIn Tasmania the capture of women for wives from hostile and alien\r\ntribes was generally prevalent.[2275] Among the Maoris, the ancient and\r\nmost general way of obtaining a wife was for the man to get together\r\na party of his friends and carry off the woman by force, apparent or\r\nactual.[2276] A similar practice occurs on the larger islands of the\r\nFiji Group,[2277] in Samoa,[2278] Tukopia,[2279] New Guinea,[2280]\r\nand extremely frequently in the Indian Archipelago,[2281] and among\r\nthe wild tribes of India.[2282] Among the Arabs,[2283] Tartars,[2284]\r\nand other peoples of Central Asia, as also in European Russia,[2285]\r\ntraces of capture occur in the marriage ceremony, whilst the\r\nTangutans,[2286] Samoyedes,[2287] Votyaks,[2288] &c.,[2289] are still\r\nin the habit of stealing wives, or elope with their sweethearts, if\r\nthe bridegroom cannot afford to pay the fixed purchase-sum. Among\r\nthe Laplanders,[2290] Esthonians,[2291] and Finns,[2292] marriage\r\nby capture occurred in former days, and in some parts of Finland\r\nsymbolical traces of it in the marriage ceremony have been found in\r\nmodern times.[2293]\r\n\r\nThe same practice prevailed among the peoples of the Aryan race.\r\nAccording to the ‘Laws of Manu,’ one of the eight legal forms of\r\nthe marriage ceremony was the Râkshasa rite, _i.e._, “the forcible\r\nabduction of a maiden from her home, while she cries out and weeps,\r\nafter her kinsmen have been slain or wounded, and their houses broken\r\nopen.” This rite was permitted for the Kshatriyas by the sacred\r\ntradition.[2294] According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, marriage by\r\ncapture was at one time customary throughout ancient Greece;[2295]\r\nand, as Plutarch informs us, it was retained by the Spartans as an\r\nimportant symbol in the marriage ceremony.[2296] Even now, according\r\nto Sakellarios, capture of wives occasionally occurs in Greece.[2297]\r\nAmong the Romans, the bride fled to the lap of her mother, and was\r\ncarried off by force by the bridegroom and his friends.[2298] In the\r\nhistorical age this was a ceremony only, but at an earlier time the\r\ncapture seems to have been a reality. “Les premiers Romains,” says\r\nM. Ortolan, “d’après leurs traditions héroïques, ont été obligés\r\nde recourir à la surprise et à la force pour enlever leurs premières\r\nfemmes.”[2299] The ancient Teutons frequently captured women for\r\nwives.[2300] Speaking of the Scandinavian nations, Olaus Magnus says\r\nthat they were continually at war with one another, “propter raptas\r\nvirgines aut arripiendas.”[2301] Among the Welsh, on the morning of the\r\nwedding-day, the bridegroom, accompanied by his friends on horseback,\r\ncarried off the bride.[2302] The Slavs in early times, according to\r\nNestor, practised marriage by capture;[2303] and in the marriage\r\nceremonies of the Russians and other Slavonian nations, reminiscences\r\nof this custom still survive.[2304] Indeed, among the South Slavonians,\r\ncapture _de facto_ was in full force no longer ago than the beginning\r\nof the present century.[2305] According to Olaus Magnus, it prevailed\r\nin Muscovy, Lithuania, and Livonia;[2306] and, according to Seignior\r\nde Gaya, the symbol of it occurred in his time in Poland, Prussia, and\r\nSamogithia.[2307]\r\n\r\nThe list of peoples among whom marriage by capture occurs, either as\r\na reality or as a symbol, might easily be enlarged.[2308] There are\r\npeoples, however, who seem to have nothing of the kind. As regards the\r\nChinese, Mr. Jamieson says, “Of the capture of wives there is, as far\r\nas I am aware, historically no trace, nor is the form to be found among\r\nany of the ceremonies of marriage with which I am acquainted.”[2309]\r\nMoreover, it is doubtful whether the ceremonies given as instances of\r\nsymbolical capture are, in every case, survivals of capture _de facto_,\r\nin the real sense of the term, that is, taking the woman against not\r\nonly her own will, but that of her parents. Mr. Spencer suggests\r\nthat one origin of the form of capture may be the resistance of the\r\npursued woman, due to coyness, partly real and partly assumed;[2310]\r\nand, though this suggestion has been much attacked, it can scarcely be\r\ndisproved. On the East Coast of Greenland, according to Dr. Nansen,\r\nthe only method of contracting a marriage is still for the man to\r\ngo to the girl’s tent, catch her by the hair or anything else which\r\noffers a hold, and drag her off to his dwelling without further ado.\r\nViolent scenes are often the result, as single women always affect the\r\nutmost bashfulness and aversion to any proposal of marriage, lest they\r\nshould lose their reputation for modesty. But “the woman’s relations\r\nmeanwhile stand quietly looking on, as the struggle is considered a\r\npurely private affair, and the natural desire of the Greenlander to\r\nstand on a good footing with his neighbour prevents him from attempting\r\nany interference with another’s business.”[2311] Again, according to\r\nMr. Abercromby, marriage _with_ capture—by which he understands capture\r\nof a bride, associated with some other form of marriage, such as that\r\nby purchase—may be regarded rather as a result of the innate universal\r\ndesire to display courage, than as a survival of a still older practice\r\nof taking women captive in time of war.[2312]\r\n\r\nMr. McLennan thinks that marriage by capture arose from the rule of\r\nexogamy. But there are peoples—the Maoris, Ahts, &c.—among whom this\r\npractice occurs or has remained as a symbol, who are, nevertheless,\r\nwhat Mr. McLennan would call endogamous. We are not entitled to say\r\nthat, “wherever exogamy can be found, we may confidently expect\r\nto find, after due investigation, at least traces of a system of\r\ncapture.”[2313] On reckoning up the peoples among whom the combination\r\nof capture and exogamy is met with, Dr. Tylor observes that the number,\r\n“though enough to show that they coexist freely, falls short of what\r\nwould justify the inference that they are cause and effect.”[2314]\r\n\r\nIt seems to me extremely probable that the practice of capturing\r\nwomen for wives is due chiefly to the aversion to close\r\nintermarriage—existing, as we have seen, among endogamous tribes\r\nalso,—together with the difficulty a savage man has in procuring a\r\nwife in a friendly manner, without giving compensation for the loss\r\nhe inflicts on her father. Being something quite different from the\r\nwrestling for wives, already mentioned as the most primitive method\r\nof courtship, marriage by capture flourished at that stage of social\r\ngrowth when family ties had become stronger, and man lived in small\r\ngroups of nearly related persons, but when the idea of barter had\r\nscarcely occurred to his mind.[2315] From the universality of the\r\nhorror of incest, and from the fact that primitive hordes were in a\r\nchronic state of warfare with one another, the general prevalence of\r\nthis custom may be easily explained. But as it is impossible to believe\r\nthat there ever was a time when friendly negotiations between families\r\nwho could intermarry were altogether unknown, we cannot suppose that\r\ncapture was at any period the exclusive form of contracting marriage,\r\nalthough it may have been the normal form. In Australia, where\r\nmarriage by capture takes place between members of hostile communities\r\nonly,[2316] we are aware of no tribe—exogamous or endogamous—living in\r\na state of absolute isolation. On the contrary, every tribe entertains\r\nconstant relations, for the most part amicable, with one, two, or\r\nmore tribes; and marriages between their members are the rule.[2317]\r\nMoreover, the custom, prevalent among many savage tribes, of a husband\r\ntaking up his abode in his wife’s family seems to have arisen very\r\nearly in man’s history. And Dr. Tylor’s schedules show that there are\r\nin different parts of the world even twelve or thirteen well-marked\r\nexogamous peoples among whom this habit occurs.[2318]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs appears from the instances quoted, the practice of capturing wives\r\nis, in the main, a thing of the past. Among most existing uncivilized\r\npeoples a man has, in some way or other, to give compensation for his\r\nbride.[2319] Marriage by capture has been succeeded by marriage by\r\npurchase.\r\n\r\nThe simplest way of purchasing a wife is no doubt to give a kinswoman\r\nin exchange for her. “The Australian male,” says Mr. Curr, “almost\r\ninvariably obtains his wife or wives, either as a survivor of a\r\nmarried brother, or in exchange for his sisters, or later on in life\r\nfor his daughters.”[2320] A similar exchange is sometimes effected in\r\nSumatra.[2321]\r\n\r\nMuch more common is the custom of obtaining a wife by services rendered\r\nto her father. The man goes to live with the family of the girl for a\r\ncertain time, during which he works as a servant. This practice, with\r\nwhich Hebrew tradition has familiarized us, is widely diffused among\r\nthe uncivilized races of America,[2322] Africa,[2323] Asia,[2324] and\r\nthe Indian Archipelago.[2325] Often it is only those men who are too\r\npoor to pay cash that serve in the father-in-law’s house till they have\r\ngiven an equivalent in labour; but sometimes not even money can save\r\nthe bridegroom from this sort of servitude.[2326] In some cases he has\r\nto serve his time before he is allowed to marry the girl; in others he\r\ngets her in advance. Again, among several peoples, already mentioned,\r\nthe man goes over to the woman’s family or tribe to live there for\r\never; but Dr. Starcke suggests that this custom has a different origin\r\nfrom the other, being an expression of the strong clan sentiment, and\r\nnot a question of gain.[2327]\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Spencer, the obtaining of wives by services\r\nrendered, instead of by property paid, constitutes a higher form\r\nof marriage, and is developed along with the industrial type of\r\nsociety. “This modification,” he says, “practicable with difficulty\r\namong rude predatory tribes becomes more practicable as there arise\r\nestablished industries affording spheres in which services may be\r\nrendered.”[2328] But it should be noticed that, even at a very low\r\nstage of civilization, a man may help his father-in-law in fishing and\r\nhunting, whilst industrial work promotes accumulation of property, and\r\nconsequently makes it easier for the man to acquire his wife by real\r\npurchase. We find also the practice of serving for wives prevalent\r\namong such rude races as the Fuegians and the Bushmans; and, in the\r\n‘Eyrbyggja Saga,’ Vîgstyr says to the berserk Halli, who asked for the\r\nhand of his daughter Âsdî, “As you are a poor man, I shall do as the\r\nancients did and let you deserve your marriage by hard work.”[2329] It\r\nseems then, almost probable that marriage by services is a more archaic\r\nform than marriage by purchase; but generally they occur simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThe most common compensation for a bride is property paid to her owner.\r\nHer price varies indefinitely. A pretty, healthy, and able-bodied girl\r\ncommands of course a better price than one who is ugly and weak;[2330]\r\na girl of rank, a better price than one who is mean and poor;[2331] a\r\nvirgin, generally a better than a widow or a repudiated wife.[2332]\r\nAmong the Californian Karok, for instance, a wife is seldom purchased\r\nfor less than half a string of dentalium shell, but “when she\r\nbelongs to an aristocratic family, is pretty, and skillful in making\r\nacorn-bread and weaving baskets, she sometimes costs as high as two\r\nstrings.”[2333] The bride-price however, varies most according to the\r\ncircumstances of the parties, and according to the value set on female\r\nlabour. In British Columbia and Vancouver Island, the value of the\r\narticles given for the bride ranges from £20 to £40 sterling.[2334]\r\nThe Indians of Oregon buy their wives for horses, blankets, or buffalo\r\nrobes.[2335] Among the Shastika in California, “a wife is purchased\r\nof her father for shell-money or horses, ten or twelve cayuse ponies\r\nbeing paid for a maid of great attractions.”[2336] Again, the Navajos\r\nof New Mexico consider twelve horses so exorbitant a price for a wife,\r\nthat it is paid only for “one possessing unusual qualifications, such\r\nas beauty, industry, and skill in their necessary employments”;[2337]\r\nand the Patagonians give mares, horses, or silver ornaments for the\r\nbride.[2338]\r\n\r\nIn Africa, not horses but cattle are considered the most proper\r\nequivalent for a good wife. Among the Kaffirs, three, five, or ten\r\ncows are a low price, twenty or thirty a rather high; but, according\r\nto Barrow, a man frequently obtained a wife for an ox or a couple of\r\ncows.[2339] The Damaras are so poor a people that they are often glad\r\nto take one cow for a daughter.[2340] Among the Banyai, many heads of\r\ncattle or goats are given to induce the parents of the girl “to give\r\nher up,” as it is termed, _i.e._, to forgo all claim on her offspring,\r\nfor if nothing is given, the family from which she comes can claim\r\nthe children as part of itself.[2341] In Uganda, the ordinary price\r\nof a wife is either three or four bullocks, six sewing needles, or a\r\nsmall box of percussion caps, but Mr. Wilson was often offered one in\r\nexchange for a coat or a pair of shoes.[2342] In the Mangoni country,\r\ntwo skins of a buck are considered a fair price,[2343] and among the\r\nNegroes of Bondo, a goat;[2344] whereas, among the Mandingoes, as\r\nwe are told by Caillié, no wife is to be had otherwise than by the\r\npresentation of slaves to the parents of the mistress.[2345]\r\n\r\nThe Chulims paid from five to fifty roubles for a wife, the Turalinzes\r\nusually from five to ten.[2346] Rich Bashkirs pay sometimes even\r\n3,000 roubles, but the poorest may buy a wife for a cart-load of wood\r\nor hay.[2347] In Tartary, parents sell a daughter for some horses,\r\noxen, sheep, or pounds of butter; among the Samoyedes and Ostyaks,\r\nfor a certain number of reindeer.[2348] Among the Indian Kisáns,\r\n“two baskets of rice and a rupee in cash constitute the compensatory\r\noffering given to the parents of the girl.”[2349] Among the Mishmis, a\r\nrich man gives for a wife twenty mithuns (a kind of oxen), but a poor\r\nman can get a wife for a pig.[2350] In Timor-laut, according to Mr.\r\nForbes, “no wife can be purchased without elephants’ tusks.”[2351]\r\nIn the Caroline Islands, “the man makes a present to the father of\r\nthe girl whom he marries, consisting of fruits, fish, and similar\r\nthings!”[2352] In Samoa, the bride-price included canoes, pigs, and\r\nforeign property of any kind which might fall into their hands;[2353]\r\nand, among the Fijians, “the usual price is a whale’s tooth, or a\r\nmusket.”[2354]\r\n\r\nAmong some peoples marriage may take place on credit, though,\r\ngenerally, the wife and her children cannot leave the parental home\r\nuntil the price is paid in full.[2355] In Unyoro, according to Emin\r\nPasha, when a poor man is unable to procure the cattle required for\r\nhis marriage at once, he may, by agreement with the bride’s father,\r\npay them by instalments; the children, however, born in the meantime\r\nbelong to the wife’s father, and each of them must be redeemed with a\r\ncow.[2356]\r\n\r\nMarriage by exchange or purchase is not only generally prevalent among\r\nexisting lower races; it occurs, or formerly occurred, among civilized\r\nnations as well. In Central America and Peru, a man had to serve for\r\nhis bride.[2357] In China, a present is given by the father of the\r\nsuitor, the amount of which is not left to the goodwill of the parties,\r\nas the term “present” would suggest, but is exactly stipulated for\r\nby the negotiators of the marriage; hence, as Mr. Jamieson remarks,\r\nit is no doubt a survival of the time when the transaction was one of\r\nordinary bargain.[2358] In Japan, the proposed husband sends certain\r\nprescribed presents to his future bride, and this sending of presents\r\nforms one of the most important parts of the marriage ceremony. In\r\nfact, when once the presents have been sent and accepted, the contract\r\nis completed, and neither party can retract. Mr. Küchler says he has\r\nbeen unable to find out the exact meaning of these presents: the\r\nnative books on marriage are silent on the subject, and the Japanese\r\nthemselves have no other explanation to give than that the custom has\r\nbeen handed down from ancient times.[2359] But from the facts recorded\r\nin the next chapter it is evident that the sending of presents is a\r\nrelic of a previous custom of marrying by purchase.\r\n\r\nIn all branches of the Semitic race men had to buy or serve for\r\ntheir wives, the “mohar” or “mahr” being originally the same as a\r\npurchase-sum.[2360] In the Books of Ruth and Hosea, the bridegroom\r\nactually says that he has bought the bride;[2361] and the modern\r\nJews, according to Michaelis, have a sham purchase among their\r\nmarriage ceremonies, which is called “marrying by the penny.”[2362]\r\nIn Mohammedan countries marriage differs but little from a real\r\npurchase.[2363] The same custom prevailed among the Chaldeans,\r\nBabylonians,[2364] and Assyrians.[2365]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the ancient Finns, the Finnish philologist and traveller,\r\nCastrén, remarks, “There are many reasons for believing that a cap\r\nfull of silver and gold was one of the best proxies in wooing among our\r\nancestors.”[2366] Evident traces of marriage by purchase are, indeed,\r\nfound in the ‘Kalevala’ and the ‘Kanteletar’;[2367] and, in parts of\r\nFinland, symbols of it are still left in the marriage ceremony.[2368]\r\nAmong the East Finnish peoples, marriage by purchase exists even now,\r\nor did so till quite lately.[2369]\r\n\r\nWife purchase, as Dr. Winternitz remarks, was the basis of\r\nIndo-European marriage before the separation of peoples took\r\nplace.[2370] The Hindu bride, in Vedic times, had to be won by rich\r\npresents to the future father-in-law;[2371] and one of the eight\r\nforms of marriage mentioned, though disapproved of, by Manu—the Âsura\r\nform—was marriage by purchase. According to Dubois, to marry and to\r\nbuy a wife are in India synonymous terms.[2372] Aristotle tells us\r\nthat the ancient Greeks were in the habit of purchasing wives,[2373]\r\nand in the Homeric age a maid was called “ἀλφεσίβοια,” _i.e._, one\r\n“who yields her parents many oxen as presents from her suitor.”\r\nAmong the Thracians, according to Herodotus, marriage was contracted\r\nby purchase.[2374] So also throughout Teutonic antiquity.[2375] The\r\nancient Scandinavians believed that even the gods had bought their\r\nwives.[2376] In Germany, the expression “to purchase a wife” was in\r\nuse till the end of the Middle Ages, and we find the same term in\r\nChristian IV.'s Norwegian Law of 1604.[2377] As late as the middle of\r\nthe sixteenth century the English preserved in their marriage ritual\r\ntraces of this ancient legal procedure;[2378] whilst in Thuringia,\r\naccording to Franz Schmidt, the betrothal ceremony even to this day\r\nindicates its former occurrence.[2379]\r\n\r\nPurchase, as Dr. Schrader remarks, cannot with equal certainty be\r\nestablished as the oldest form of marriage on Roman soil.[2380] But\r\nthe symbolical process of _coemptio_—the form of marriage among the\r\nplebeians—preserved a reminiscence of the original custom in force\r\nif not at Rome, at least among the ancestors of the Romans.[2381] In\r\nIreland and Wales, in ancient times, the bride-price consisted usually\r\nof articles of gold, silver, and bronze, sometimes even of land.[2382]\r\nThe Slavs, also, used to buy their wives;[2383] and, among the South\r\nSlavonians, the custom of purchasing the bride still partially\r\nprevails, or recently did so. In Servia, at the beginning of the\r\npresent century, the price of girls reached such a height that Black\r\nGeorge limited it to one ducat.[2384]\r\n\r\nIn spite of this general prevalence of marriage by purchase, we have\r\nno evidence that it is a stage through which every race has passed. It\r\nmust be observed, first, that in sundry tribes the presents given by\r\nthe bridegroom are intended not exactly to compensate the parents for\r\nthe bride, but rather to dispose them favourably to the match. Colonel\r\nDalton says, for example, that, among the Pádams, one of the lowest\r\npeoples of India, it is customary for a lover to show his inclinations\r\nwhilst courting by presenting his sweetheart and her parents with small\r\ndelicacies, such as field mice and squirrels, though the parents seldom\r\ninterfere with the young couple’s designs, and it would be regarded as\r\nan indelible disgrace to barter a child’s happiness for money.[2385]\r\nThe Ainos of Yesso, says Mr. Bickmore, “do not buy their wives, but\r\nmake presents to the parents of saki, tobacco, and fish;”[2386] and the\r\namount of these gifts is never settled beforehand.[2387] The game and\r\nfruits given by the bridegroom immediately before marriage, among the\r\nPuris, Coroados, and Coropos, seem to v. Martius to be rather a proof\r\nof his ability to keep a wife than a means of exchange; whereas the\r\nmore civilized tribes of the Brazilian aborigines carry on an actual\r\ntrade in women.[2388]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Yukonikhotana, a tribe of Alaska, Petroff states\r\nthat the custom of purchasing wives does not exist among them.[2389]\r\nThe Californian Wintun, who rank among the lower types of the race,\r\ngenerally pay nothing for their brides.[2390] The Niam-Niam and some\r\nother African peoples,[2391] most of the Chittagong Hill tribes,[2392]\r\nthe aboriginal inhabitants of Kola and Kobroor, of the Aru Archipelago,\r\nwho live in trees or caves,[2393] and apparently also the Andamanese\r\nare in the habit of marrying without making any payment for the bride.\r\nAmong the Veddahs, according to M. Le Mesurier, no marriage presents\r\nare given on either side,[2394] but Mr. Hartshorne states that “a\r\nmarriage is attended with no ceremony beyond the presentation of some\r\nfood to the parents of the bride.”[2395]\r\n\r\nIn Ponapé, says Dr. Finsch, marriage is not based on purchase;[2396]\r\nbut this is contrary to the general custom in the Carolines,[2397]\r\nas also in the adjacent Pelew Islands,[2398] where women are bought\r\nas wives by means of presents to the father. In the Kingsmill Group,\r\naccording to Wilkes, “a wife is never bought, but it is generally\r\nsupposed that each party will contribute something towards the\r\nhousehold stock.”[2399] With regard to the Hawaiians, Ellis remarks,\r\n“We are not aware that the parents of the woman received anything from\r\nthe husband, or gave any dowry with the wife.”[2400] And Mr. Angas even\r\nasserts that the practice of purchasing wives is not generally adopted\r\nin Polynesia.[2401] But the statement is doubtful, as, at least in\r\nSamoa,[2402] Tahiti,[2403] and Nukahiva,[2404] the bridegroom gains the\r\nbride by presents to her father. And in Melanesia marriage by purchase\r\nis certainly universal.[2405] Among the South Australian Kurnai,\r\naccording to Mr. Howitt, marriages were brought about “most frequently\r\nby elopement, less frequently by capture, and least frequently by\r\nexchange or by gift.”[2406]\r\n\r\nPurchase of wives may, with even more reason than marriage by capture,\r\nbe said to form a general stage in the social history of man. Although\r\nthe two practices often occur simultaneously, the former has, as a\r\nrule, succeeded the latter, as barter in general has followed upon\r\nrobbery. The more recent character of marriage by purchase appears\r\nclearly from the fact that marriage by capture very frequently occurs\r\nas a symbol where marriage by purchase occurs as a reality. Moreover,\r\nthere can be little doubt that barter and commerce are comparatively\r\nlate inventions of man.\r\n\r\nDr. Peschel, indeed, contends that barter existed in those ages in\r\nwhich we find the earliest signs of our race. But we have no evidence\r\nthat it was in this way that the cave-dwellers of Périgord, of the\r\nreindeer period, obtained the rock crystals, the Atlantic shells, and\r\nthe horns of the Polish Saiga antelope, which have been found in their\r\nsettlements; and we may not in any case, conclude that “commerce has\r\nexisted in all ages, and among all inhabitants of the world.”[2407]\r\nThere are even in modern times instances of savage peoples who seem to\r\nhave a very vague idea of barter, or perhaps none at all. Concerning\r\ncertain Solomon Islanders, Labillardière states, “We could not learn\r\nwhether these people are in the habit of making exchanges; but it is\r\nvery certain that it was impossible for us to obtain anything from\r\nthem in this way; ... yet they were very eager to receive everything\r\nthat we gave them.”[2408] For some time after Captain Weddell began\r\nto associate with the Fuegians, they gave him any small article he\r\nexpressed a wish for, without asking any return; but afterwards they\r\n“acquired an idea of barter.”[2409] Nor did the Australians whom Cook\r\nsaw, and the Patagonians visited by Captain Wallis in 1766, understand\r\ntraffic, though they now understand it.[2410] Again, with regard to the\r\nAndamanese Mr. Man remarks, “They set no fixed value on their various\r\nproperties, and rarely make or procure anything with the express\r\nobject of disposing of it in barter. Apparently they prefer to regard\r\ntheir transactions as presentations, for their mode of negotiating\r\nis to _give_ such objects as are desired by another in the hope of\r\nreceiving in return something for which they have expressed a wish, it\r\nbeing tacitly understood that unless otherwise mentioned beforehand,\r\nno ‘present’ is to be accepted without an equivalent being rendered.\r\nThe natural consequence of this system is that most of the quarrels\r\nwhich so frequently occur among them originate in failure on the part\r\nof the recipient in making such a return as had been confidently\r\nexpected.”[2411] It must also be noted that those uncivilized peoples\r\namong whom marriage by purchase does not occur are, for the most part,\r\nexceedingly rude races.\r\n\r\nAs M. Koenigswarter[2412] and Mr. Spencer[2413] have suggested, the\r\ntransition from marriage by capture to marriage by purchase was\r\nprobably brought about in the following way: abduction, in spite\r\nof parents, was the primary form; then there came the offering of\r\ncompensation to escape vengeance; and this grew eventually into the\r\nmaking of presents beforehand. Thus, among the Ahts, according to Mr.\r\nSproat, when a man steals a wife, a purchase follows, “as the friends\r\nof the woman must be pacified with presents.”[2414] In New Guinea[2415]\r\nand Bali,[2416] as also among the Chukmas[2417] and Araucanians,[2418]\r\nit often happens that the bridegroom carries off, or elopes with, his\r\nbride, and afterwards pays a compensation-price to her parents. Among\r\nthe Bodo and Mech, who still preserve the form of forcible abduction in\r\ntheir marriage ceremony, the successful lover, after having captured\r\nthe girl, gives a feast to the bride’s friends and with a present\r\nconciliates the father, who is supposed to be incensed.[2419] The same\r\nis reported of the Maoris,[2420] whilst among the Tangutans, according\r\nto Prejevalsky, the ravisher who has stolen his neighbour’s wife pays\r\nthe husband a good sum as compensation, but keeps the wife.[2421]\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of no importance in this connection that among certain\r\npeoples, the price of the bride is paid not to the father, but to\r\nsome other nearly related person, especially an uncle,[2422] or to\r\nsome other relatives as well as to the father.[2423] In any case\r\nthe price is to be regarded as a compensation for the loss sustained\r\nin the giving up of the girl, and as a remuneration for the expenses\r\nincurred in her maintenance till the time of her marriage.[2424]\r\nSometimes, as among several negro peoples, daughters are trained for\r\nthe purpose of being disposed of at a profit; but this is a modern\r\ninvention, irreconcilable with savage ideas. Thus, among the Kafirs,\r\nthe practice of making an express bargain about women hardly prevailed\r\nin the first quarter of this century, and the verb applied to the act\r\nof giving cattle for a girl, according to Mr. Shooter, involves not the\r\nidea of an actual trade, but rather that of reward for her birth and\r\nnurture.[2425]\r\n\r\nTo most savages there seems nothing objectionable in marriage by\r\npurchase. On the contrary, Mr. Bancroft states that the Indians in\r\nColumbia consider it in the highest degree disgraceful to the girl’s\r\nfamily, if she is given away without a price;[2426] and, in certain\r\ntribes of California, “the children of a woman for whom no money was\r\npaid are accounted no better than bastards, and the whole family are\r\ncontemned.”[2427] It was left for a higher civilization to raise women\r\nfrom this state of debasement. In the next chapter we shall consider\r\nthe process by which marriage ceased to be a purchase contract, and\r\nwoman an object of trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE DECAY OF MARRIAGE BY PURCHASE. THE MARRIAGE PORTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has often been said that the position of women is the surest gauge\r\nof a people’s civilization. This assertion, though not absolutely,\r\nis approximately true. The evolution of altruism is one of the chief\r\nelements in human progress, and consideration for the weaker sex is one\r\nof the chief elements in the evolution of altruism.\r\n\r\nAccording as more elevated ideas regarding women grew up among the\r\nso-called civilized peoples, the practice of purchasing wives was\r\ngradually abandoned, and came to be looked upon as infamous. The\r\nwealthier classes took the first step, and poorer and ruder persons\r\nfollowed their example. It is of no little interest to follow the\r\ncourse of this process.\r\n\r\nIn India, in ancient times, the Âsura form, or marriage by purchase,\r\nwas lawful for all the four castes. Afterwards it fell into disrepute,\r\nand was prohibited among the Brahmans and Kshatriyas, but it was\r\napproved of in the case of a Vaiśya and of a Śudra. Manu forbade it\r\naltogether.[2428] “No father who knows the law,” he says, “must take\r\neven the smallest gratuity for his daughter; for a man who, through\r\navarice, takes a gratuity, is a seller of his offspring.”[2429]\r\nPurchase survived as a symbol only in the Ârsha form, according to\r\nwhich the bridegroom sent a cow and a bull or two pairs to the\r\nbride’s father.[2430] Manu expressly condemns those who call this\r\ngift a gratuity;[2431] hence the Ârsha form was counted by Manu and\r\nother lawgivers as one of the legitimate modes of marriage.[2432]\r\nThe Greeks of the historical age had ceased to buy their wives; and\r\nin Rome, _confarreatio_, which suggested no idea of purchase, was in\r\nthe very earliest known time the form of marriage in force among the\r\npatricians. Among clients and plebeians also, the purchase of wives\r\ncame to an end in remote antiquity, surviving as a mere symbol in their\r\n_coemptio_.[2433] Among the Germans, according to Grimm, it was only\r\nChristianity that abolished marriage by purchase.[2434] Laferrière\r\nand Koenigswarter think it prevailed among the Saxons as late as the\r\nreign of Charles the Great, and that in England it was prohibited by\r\nCnut.[2435] In _Lex Alamannorum_, _Lex Ripuariorum_, ‘Grâgâs,’ and\r\nthe Norwegian laws, real purchase money is not spoken of; and there is\r\nreason to believe that the “mundr,” mentioned in the elder ‘Gula-lag’\r\nhad gradually lost its original meaning of price for a bride.[2436]\r\n\r\nIn the Talmudic law, the purchase of wives appears as merely symbolic,\r\nthe bride-price being fixed at a nominal amount.[2437] The Mohammedan\r\n“mahr” is also frequently merely nominal.[2438] Among the Finns,\r\nthe purchase of wives had disappeared in the remote times when their\r\npopular songs originated.[2439] Though it still was usual for a\r\nbridegroom to give presents to his bride and her parents, passages\r\nin the songs indicate that not even the memory of a real purchase\r\nsurvived.[2440] In China, although marriage presents correspond\r\nexactly to purchase-money in a contract of sale, the people will not\r\nhear of their being called a “price”;[2441] which shows that, among\r\nthem also, some feeling of shame is attached to the idea of selling a\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nWe may discern two different ways in which this gradual disappearance\r\nof marriage by purchase has taken place. It has been suggested that the\r\nsum with which the bridegroom bought the bride became a payment for\r\nthe guardianship of her.[2442] However this may be, the purchase-money\r\nbecame in time smaller and smaller, and took in many cases the form of\r\nmore or less arbitrary presents. Only a relic of the ancient custom, as\r\nwe have seen, was left, often appearing as a sham sale in the marriage\r\nceremonies. Another mode of preserving the symbol of sale was the\r\nreceipt of a gift of real value, which was immediately returned to the\r\ngiver. This arrangement is said by Âpastamba to have been prescribed\r\nby the Vedas “in order to fulfil the law”—that is, the ancient law\r\nby which the binding form of marriage was a sale.[2443] Generally,\r\nhowever, not the same but another gift is presented in return. Thus,\r\nat Athens, at some time which cannot be determined, but which was\r\nundoubtedly earlier than the age of Solon, the dower in the modern\r\nsense arose; and, as has been suggested,[2444] this portioning of the\r\nbride by her father or guardian very probably implied originally a\r\nreturn of the price paid. Again, in China, exchange of presents takes\r\nplace between the guardians of the bridegroom and the guardians of the\r\nbride; and this exchange forms the subject of a long section in the\r\npenal code, for, “the marriage articles and betrothal presents once\r\nexchanged, the parties are considered irrevocably engaged.”[2445] In\r\nJapan, the bride gives certain conventional presents to her future\r\nhusband and his parents and relatives, and, as to the value of these\r\npresents, she should always be guided by the value of those brought by\r\nthe bridegroom.[2446] Among the ancient Germans, according to Tacitus,\r\nthe wife in her turn presented the husband with some kind of arms,\r\nand this mutual exchange of gifts formed the principal bond of their\r\nunion.[2447] Grimm also suggests that the meaning of the Teutonic dowry\r\nwas partly that of a return gift.[2448]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the purchase-sum was transformed into the morning\r\ngift and the dotal portion. A part—afterwards the whole—was given\r\nto the bride either directly by the bridegroom or by her father.\r\nManu says, “When the relatives do not appropriate for their use the\r\ngratuity given, it is not a sale; in that case the gift is only a token\r\nof respect and of kindness towards the maidens.”[2449] This gift was\r\ncalled “çulka,” or her fee; but its close connection with a previous\r\npurchase appears from the fact that it passed in a course of devolution\r\nto the woman’s brothers, and one rendering of the text of Gautama\r\nwhich regulates this succession, even allowed the fee to go to her\r\nbrothers during her life.[2450] In modern India, according to Dubois,\r\nmen of distinction do not appropriate the money acquired by giving a\r\ndaughter in marriage, but lay it out in jewels, which they present to\r\nthe lady on the wedding-day.[2451] Among the Greeks of the Homeric age,\r\nthe father did not always keep the wedding-presents for his own use,\r\nbut bestowed them, wholly or in part, on the daughter as her marriage\r\nportion. At a later period, the bridegroom himself gave the presents\r\nto his wife, when he saw her unveiled for the first time, or after the\r\nνὺξ μυστική.[2452] Among the Teutons the same process of development\r\ntook place. Originally, the purchase-sum went to the guardian of the\r\nbride, partly, perhaps, to her whole family; but by-and-by it came\r\nto be considered her own property,[2453] as Tacitus says, “Dotem non\r\nuxor marito sed uxori maritus offert.”[2454] This was the case among\r\nthe Scandinavians at the date of the inditing of their laws, and among\r\nthe Langobardi from the seventh century.[2455] “La dot,” says M.\r\nGinoulhiac, “n’est autre chose que le prix de la coemption en usage\r\ndans la loi salique; elle fut donnée à la femme au lieu de l’être à\r\nses parents, qui ne reçurent plus que le _solidum_ et _denarium_,\r\nou le prix fictif, et après la mort de l’épouse, une partie de la\r\ndot.”[2456] In _Lex Alamannorum_ and _Lex Ripuariorum_, only a _dos_\r\nwhich the wife receives directly from her husband is spoken of.[2457]\r\nAnd it seems probable that the morning gift, which has survived very\r\nlong in Europe,[2458] originated in the purchase-sum, or formed a\r\npart of it,[2459] though it has often been considered a _pretium\r\nvirginitatis_.[2460] According to ancient Irish law, a part of the\r\n“coibche,” or bridal gift, went to the bride’s father, or, if he was\r\ndead, to the head of her tribe;[2461] but another part was given by the\r\nbridegroom to the bride herself after marriage. The same was the case\r\nwith the Welsh “cowyll”;[2462] and the Slavonic word for bride-price,\r\n“vĕno,” came to be frequently used for _dos_.[2463]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the ancient Babylonians, Herodotus says that “the\r\nmarriage portions were furnished by the money paid for the beautiful\r\ndamsels.”[2464] Among the Hebrews, as it seems the “mohar,” or a\r\npart of it, was given to the bride herself.[2465] We read in the\r\nBook of Genesis that Abraham’s servant “brought forth jewels of\r\nsilver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebecca: he\r\ngave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.”[2466]\r\nProfessor Robertson Smith is inclined to believe that, in Arabia,\r\nbefore Mohammed, a custom had established itself by which the husband\r\nordinarily made a gift—under the name of “sadâc”—to his wife upon\r\nmarriage, or by which a part of the “mahr” was customarily set aside\r\nfor her use.[2467] But under Islam the difference between “mahr”\r\nand “sadâc” disappeared, the price paid to the father becoming the\r\nproperty of the woman.[2468]\r\n\r\nBut it is not only in the history of the great civilized nations that\r\nwe find marriage by purchase falling into decay. Among several peoples\r\nwho are still in a savage or semi-civilized state, the custom of\r\npurchasing the wife has been modified, and of a few it is expressly\r\nstated that they consider such a traffic disgraceful.[2469] The change\r\nhas taken place in exactly the same way as we have seen to be the case\r\nwith higher races.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the purchase has become more or less a symbol. In some\r\ncases the gift no longer represents the actual value of the girl, in\r\nothers it is followed by a return gift. Thus, in Oregon, “the wife’s\r\nrelations always raise as many horses (or other property) for her\r\ndower, as the bridegroom has sent the parents, but scrupulously take\r\ncare not to turn over the same horses or the same articles.”[2470] The\r\nAhts consider it a point of honour that the purchase-money given for\r\na woman of rank shall, some time or other, be returned in a present\r\nof equal value.[2471] Similar statements are made with reference\r\nto the Patagonians,[2472] Mishmis,[2473] and certain tribes in the\r\nIndian Archipelago.[2474] Among the Bagobos of the Philippines, if the\r\nnewly-married couple are satisfied with each other, the father of the\r\nwife gives the half of the purchase-sum back to the husband;[2475]\r\nwhilst, in Saraë, the girl’s father, at the wedding, has to return even\r\nfive times the price which he received from the bridegroom’s father at\r\nthe espousals, the return gift, however, becoming the common property\r\nof the married couple.[2476] Among the Badagas of the Neilgherries\r\nalso, the return gift is generally greater in value than the sum which\r\nhas been paid for her.[2477] Several other peoples contract marriages\r\nby an exchange of presents.[2478]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand there are peoples among whom the purchase-sum, or\r\na part of it, is given to the bride either by her father or by the\r\nbridegroom himself. But, as this may be an indirect way of compensating\r\nthe bridegroom for the price he has paid, it is in many cases almost\r\nimpossible to distinguish between this custom and the one last\r\nmentioned. It is equally hard to distinguish between the cases in which\r\nthe bride receives a part of the price from her father, and those in\r\nwhich she receives a gift from the bridegroom directly. But perhaps the\r\ngreatest difficulty of all is to make out whether the presents obtained\r\nfrom the bridegroom formed originally a part of the bride-price or were\r\nonly a means of gaining her own consent. Among the Eskimo, the lover\r\npresents clothes to the lady, who puts them on, and is thenceforth\r\nhis wife.[2479] Among the Dacotahs, men ask for consent to marriage\r\nby sending the price of the girl, and in addition often give presents\r\nto the object of their esteem.[2480] Speaking of the South American\r\nGuanas, Azary says, “Toutes les cérémonies du mariage se réduisent à\r\nun petit présent que le mari fait à sa prétendue.”[2481] Again, among\r\nthe Javanese,[2482] Kalmucks,[2483] and Ahl el Shemál, a Bedouin tribe\r\nof Syria,[2484] the money or articles which the father receives for\r\nhis daughter are generally looked upon as a settlement or provision\r\nfor the wife; and among the Pelew Islanders,[2485] Mishmis,[2486]\r\nBashkirs,[2487] Votyaks,[2488] &c.,[2489] she receives a larger or\r\nsmaller part of the bride-price.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom marriage by purchase we have thus reached the practice of dower,\r\nwhich is apparently the very reverse of it. But, as we have seen, the\r\nmarriage portion derives its origin partly from the purchase of wives.\r\nWhere, as among the Marea,[2490] the endowment becomes the exclusive\r\nproperty of the husband, it is, no doubt, intended to be a compensation\r\nfor the bride-price; whilst, among other peoples, money or goods for\r\nwhich the man has bought his wife are handed over to her by the father\r\nas a marriage portion which, in a certain way, belongs to her. Yet, as\r\nwe shall see directly, the dowry does not in every case spring from a\r\nprevious purchase.\r\n\r\nThe marriage portion serves different ends, often indissolubly mixed\r\nup together. It may have the meaning of a return gift. It may imply\r\nthat the wife as well as the husband is expected to contribute to the\r\nexpenses of the joint household. It is also very often intended to be a\r\nsettlement for the wife in case the marriage be dissolved through the\r\nhusband’s death or otherwise. But as, in such instances, the husband\r\ngenerally has the usufruct of the portion, as long as the union lasts,\r\nit is in many cases impossible to discern whether the original meaning\r\nwas that of a return gift to the man or of a settlement for the woman.\r\n\r\nWe read in the ‘Laws of Manu,’ “What was given before the nuptial\r\nfire, what was given on the bridal procession, what was given in token\r\nof love, and what was received from her brother, mother, or father,\r\nthat is called the sixfold property of a woman. Such property, as well\r\nas a gift subsequent and what was given to her by her affectionate\r\nhusband, shall go to her offspring, even if she dies in the lifetime of\r\nher husband.”[2491] The Hindu law recognizes the dominion of a married\r\nwoman over this property (her “strîdhan”),[2492] but the husband has\r\nnevertheless power to use and consume it in case of distress.[2493]\r\nAt Athens, the administration of the dower certainly belonged to the\r\nhusband, who might defray with it the expenses of the marriage, and\r\neven had a right to alienate the movable objects forming a part of the\r\nmarriage portion.[2494] But it did not become his property. If the\r\nmarriage tie was dissolved through divorce or through the husband’s\r\ndeath, the dower had to be restored to the woman, who, as a security\r\nfor this restitution, had a mortgage, consisting generally of a piece\r\nof real property;[2495] or if, in case of divorce, the husband did not\r\nrestore the dower, he paid, whilst it was retained, nine oboli every\r\nmonth as interest.[2496] The Roman _dos_ was intended to be the wife’s\r\ncontribution towards the expenses of the marriage state.[2497] It\r\nbecame the husband’s property, as if it were a patrimony which he had\r\na right not only to administer, but even to dispose of independently\r\nof the will of his wife.[2498] This confusion of the dower with the\r\npatrimony was tolerable as long as marriage was contracted for life,\r\nbut became very disastrous during the period when divorces were\r\nfrequent. At the end of the Republican era, therefore, the husband’s\r\nright to dispose of his wife’s marriage portion was limited. It had to\r\nbe restored in case of divorce, as also in case of the marriage being\r\ndissolved through the husband’s death. The _Lex Julia de adulteriis_\r\nprevented him from alienating dotal land without the wife’s consent, or\r\nmortgaging it even with her consent; and the legislation of Justinian\r\nprevented alienation with the wife’s consent, and declared the law on\r\nthe subject applicable to provincial land.[2499] The general tradition\r\nof the Roman _dos_ was carried on by the Church, the practical object\r\nbeing to secure for the wife a provision of which the husband could\r\nnot wantonly deprive her, and which would remain to her after his\r\ndeath.[2500] The Roman dotal right, more or less modified in the laws\r\nof the different countries, underlies modern European legislation; the\r\nhusband generally administers and has the use of his wife’s dotation,\r\nbut it remains _her_ property.[2501]\r\n\r\nAmong the Germans of early times, the bride-price which was handed\r\nover to the woman as her marriage portion became her exclusive\r\nproperty, of which the husband could not dispose.[2502] Besides this\r\n_dos_, she received from her parents an endowment, as a sort of\r\ncompensation for her inheritance, or as an advance on it. This also\r\nwas her private property, at least so far that it went to her if\r\nthe marriage was dissolved.[2503] Among the Slavs, the dower seems\r\noriginally to have been given to the wife as a security in the event of\r\nher needing independent support; and, among the Poles and Bohemians,\r\nthe husband could make no use of it, unless he left his own goods as\r\na deposit.[2504] In Wales, a woman received not only a part of the\r\nbride-price, “cowyll,” but also a marriage portion from her father,\r\ncalled “agweddi” (representing the “tincur” of the Irish), which,\r\nduring cohabitation, belonged to husband and wife jointly. In case\r\nthey separated before the end of seven years, the wife was to receive\r\nthis portion back; and in any case, even if she left her husband for\r\nno reason before the seventh year, she had her “cowyll.” If the\r\nseparation took place after this period, the property which the wife\r\nbrought with her was divided.[2505]\r\n\r\nThe Hebrews, in early times, generally gave daughters as a dowry only a\r\npart of the “mohar.” Afterwards a woman who married was endowed with\r\na portion called “nedunia,” of which the husband had the usufruct as\r\nlong as the marriage lasted.[2506] The Mohammedans, as a rule, settle\r\nvery large dowers on their wives; and it is generally stipulated that\r\ntwo-thirds of the dowry shall be paid immediately before the marriage\r\ncontract is made, whilst the remaining third is held in reserve, to be\r\npaid to the wife in case of her being divorced against her own consent,\r\nor in case of the husband’s death.[2507] And whatever property the\r\nwife receives from her parents or any other person on the occasion of\r\nher marriage, or otherwise, is entirely at her own disposal, and not\r\nsubject to any claim of her husband or his creditors.[2508] Speaking\r\nof newly-married people among the Mexicans, Acosta says, “When\r\nthey went to house they made an inventory of all the man and wife\r\nbrought together, of provisions for the house, of land, of iewells\r\nand ornaments, which inventories every father kept, for if it chanced\r\nthey made any devorce (as it was common amongest them when they agree\r\nnot), they divided their goods according to the portion that every one\r\nbrought.”[2509]\r\n\r\nAmong races at a lower stage of civilization[2510] the dowry commonly\r\nsubserves a similar end—that is, in case of separation or divorce, the\r\nwife gets back her marriage portion, though the husband, as it seems in\r\nmost cases, has the usufruct of it as long as marriage lasts. But, in\r\nsavage life, the dowry plays no important part. Often nothing of the\r\nkind exists,[2511] and, where it does, the portion generally consists\r\nof some food, clothes, household goods, or other trifles,[2512] and\r\noccasionally of cattle.[2513] Ultimately, as we have seen, the dowry is\r\ndue to a feeling of respect and sympathy for the weaker sex, which, on\r\nthe whole, is characteristic of a higher civilization.[2514] And, as\r\nwe have spoken of a stage of marriage by capture and another stage of\r\nmarriage by purchase, we may now speak of a third, where fathers are\r\nbound by law or custom to portion their daughters.\r\n\r\nThus the Hebrews[2515] and Mahommedans[2516] consider it a religious\r\nduty for a man to give a dower to his daughter. In Greece the dowry\r\ncame to be thought almost necessary to make the distinction between\r\na wife and a concubine παλλακή;[2517] and Isaeus says that no decent\r\nman would give his legitimate daughter less than a tenth of his\r\nproperty.[2518] Indeed, so great were the dowers given that, in\r\nthe time of Aristotle, nearly two-fifths of the whole territory of\r\nSparta were supposed to belong to women.[2519] In Rome, even more\r\nthan in Greece, the marriage portion became a mark of distinction\r\nfor a legitimate wife.[2520] It was the duty of the wife to\r\nprovide her husband with _dos_, and a woman herself had a legal\r\nclaim to be provided with a dower by her father or other paternal\r\nascendants.[2521] And, though later on, Justinian in several of his\r\nconstitutions declares that _dos_ is obligatory for persons of high\r\nrank only,[2522] the old custom did not fall into desuetude.[2523] The\r\nPrussian ‘Landrecht’ still prescribes that the father, or eventually\r\nthe mother, shall arrange about the wedding and fit up the house of\r\nthe newly-married couple.[2524] According to the ‘Code Napoléon,’\r\non the other hand, parents are not bound to give a dower to their\r\ndaughters,[2525] and the same principle is generally adopted by modern\r\nlegislation. Yet there is still a strong feeling, especially in the\r\nso-called Latin countries, in favour of dotation. This feeling, as\r\nSir Henry Maine remarks, is the principal source of those habits of\r\nsaving and hoarding, which characterize the French people, and is\r\nprobably descended, by a long chain of succession, from the obligatory\r\nprovisions of the marriage law of the Emperor Augustus.[2526]\r\n\r\nIn this course of development, the marriage portion has often become\r\nsomething quite different from what it was originally. It has in many\r\ncases become a purchase-sum by means of which a father buys a husband\r\nfor his daughter, as formerly a man bought a wife from her father.\r\nEuripides, transferring to the heroic age the practice of his own time,\r\nmakes Medea complain that her sex had to purchase husbands with great\r\nsums of money.[2527] “Pars minima est ipsa puella sui,” the Latin poet\r\nsings. And, in our days, a woman without a marriage portion, unless she\r\nhas some great natural attractions, runs the risk of being a spinster\r\nfor ever. This state of things naturally grows up in a society where\r\nmonogamy is prescribed by law, where the adult women outnumber the\r\nadult men, where many men never marry, and where married women too\r\noften lead an indolent life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE CEREMONIES AND RITES\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong primitive men marriage was, of course, contracted without any\r\nceremony whatever; and this is still the case with many uncivilized\r\npeoples. Among the Eskimo, visited by Captain Hall, “there is no\r\nwedding ceremony at all, nor are there any rejoicings or festivities.\r\nThe parties simply come together, and live in their own tupic or\r\nigloo.”[2528] The Bonaks of California, according to Mr. Johnston,\r\nhave no marriage ceremony. The man simply speaks to the girl’s\r\nparents, and to the girl herself; and, if the couple live together for\r\nsome time harmoniously, they are considered husband and wife.[2529]\r\nAmong the Comanches, too, “there is no marriage ceremony of any\r\ndescription;”[2530] and the same is said of several other aboriginal\r\ntribes of America,[2531] as also of the Outanatas of New Guinea,[2532]\r\nthe Solomon Islanders,[2533] and the Tasmanians.[2534] In Australia,\r\nwedding ceremonies are unknown in most tribes, but it is said that\r\nin some there are a few unimportant ones.[2535] In the Hill Tribes\r\nof North Aracan, marriage “is a simple contract unaccompanied\r\nby ceremony.”[2536] So also among the Khasias,[2537] Chalikata\r\nMishmis,[2538] Aino,[2539] Negroes of Bondo,[2540] &c.\r\n\r\nMarriage ceremonies arose by degrees and in various ways. When the\r\nmode of contracting a marriage altered, the earlier mode, from having\r\nbeen a reality, survived as a ceremony. Thus, as we have seen, the\r\ncustom of capture was transformed into a mere symbol, after purchase\r\nwas introduced as the legal form of contracting a marriage. In other\r\ninstances the custom of purchase has survived as a ceremony, after it\r\nhas ceased to be a reality.\r\n\r\nAccording as marriage was recognized as a matter of some importance,\r\nthe entering into it came, like many other significant events in human\r\nlife, to be celebrated with certain ceremonies. Very commonly it is\r\naccompanied by a wedding feast. Among the Nufi people, for example,\r\nthe nuptials consist of the payment of the bride-price followed\r\nby eating and drinking.[2541] Among the Wanyoro, the wedding is\r\ncelebrated by a great deal of feasting, and the bride is taken by a\r\nprocession of friends to her new lord.[2542] Often the feast continues\r\nfor several days, a week, or even longer.[2543] In Mykonos, of the\r\nCyclades, according to Mr. Bent, ten or fifteen days of festivity\r\nusually accompany a marriage.[2544] Among some peoples, the expenses\r\nare defrayed by the bridegroom,[2545] in others by the father of the\r\nbride.[2546] Probably, in the former cases, the feast is considered\r\nalmost a part of the purchase sum, whilst in the latter it is, perhaps,\r\noccasionally regarded as a compensation for the bride-price.\r\n\r\nThe marriage ceremony often indicates in some way the new relation\r\ninto which the man and woman enter to each other. Sometimes it\r\nsymbolizes sexual intercourse,[2547] but far more frequently the living\r\ntogether, or the wife’s subjection to her husband. Among the Navajos,\r\nthe ceremony merely consisted in eating maize pudding from the same\r\nplatter;[2548] and among the Santals, says Colonel Dalton, “the social\r\nmeal that the boy and girl eat together is the most important part of\r\nthe ceremony, as by the act the girl ceases to belong to her father’s\r\ntribe, and becomes a member of her husband’s family.”[2549] Eating\r\ntogether is, in the Malay Archipelago, the chief and most wide-spread\r\nmarriage ceremony.[2550] The same custom occurs among the Hovas,\r\nHindus, Esthonians, in Ermland in Prussia, and in Sardinia.[2551] Again\r\nin some Brazilian tribes, marriage is contracted by the husband and\r\nwife drinking brandy together.[2552]\r\n\r\nIn Japan, where the ceremony seems to be regarded as the least\r\nimportant part of the whole proceeding, it consists in the drinking by\r\nboth parties, after a prescribed fashion, of a fixed number of cups of\r\nwine.[2553] In Scandinavia, the couple used to drink the contents of a\r\nsingle beaker—a custom which also occurs in Russia.[2554] The joining\r\nof hands, or the bridegroom’s taking the bride by the hand, is, as Dr.\r\nWinternitz remarks, one of the most important marriage ceremonies\r\namong all Indo-European peoples.[2555] The same custom occurs among\r\nthe Orang-Banûwa of Malacca;[2556] whilst, among the Orang-Sakai,\r\n“the little finger of the right hand of the man is joined to that of\r\nthe left hand of the woman.”[2557] At Khasia weddings, “the couple\r\nabout to be married merely sit together in one seat, and receive their\r\nfriends, to whom they give a dinner or feast.”[2558] Among the Veddahs\r\nof Ceylon, the bride ties a thin cord of her own twisting round the\r\nbridegroom’s waist, and they are then husband and wife. This string is\r\nemblematic of the marriage tie, and, “as he never parts with it, so he\r\nclings to his wife through life.”[2559] The Hindu bride and bridegroom,\r\nagain, have their hands bound together with grass.[2560] Among the\r\nGonds and Korkús, the actual marriage ceremonies consist, in part,\r\nof “eating together, tying the garments together, dancing together\r\nround a pole, being half drowned together by a douche of water, and\r\nthe interchange of rings,—all of which may be supposed to symbolize\r\nthe union of the parties.”[2561] In many parts of India, bride and\r\nbridegroom are, for the same reason, marked with one another’s\r\nblood,[2562] and Colonel Dalton believes this to be the origin of the\r\ncustom, now so common, of marking with red-lead. Thus, the Parkheyas\r\nuse a red powder called “sindúr,” the bridegroom sealing the compact\r\nby touching and marking with it the forehead of his bride.[2563]\r\n\r\nAmong the Australian Narrinyeri, on the other hand, a woman is\r\nsupposed to signify her consent to the marriage by carrying fire to\r\nher husband’s hut, and making his fire for him.[2564] The Negroes of\r\nLoango contract their marriages by the bridegroom’s eating from two\r\ndishes, which the bride has cooked for him in his own hut.[2565] In\r\nDahomey, according to Mr. Forbes, there is no ceremony in marriage,\r\nexcept where the king confers the wife, “in which instance the maiden\r\npresents her future lord with a glass of rum.”[2566] In Croatia, the\r\nbridegroom boxes the bride’s ears in order to indicate that henceforth\r\nhe is her master.[2567] And in ancient Russia, as part of the marriage\r\nceremony, the father took a new whip, and after striking his daughter\r\ngently with it, told her that he did so for the last time, and then\r\npresented the whip to the bridegroom.[2568]\r\n\r\nMany of the ceremonies observed at our own weddings belong to the\r\nclasses here noticed. The “best man” seems originally to have been the\r\nchief abettor of the bridegroom in the act of capture; the nuptials are\r\ngenerally celebrated with a feast in the house of the bride’s father,\r\nand the wedding-ring is a symbol of the close union which exists\r\nbetween husband and wife.[2569] Even the religious part of the ceremony\r\nhas its counterpart among many Pagan nations.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that a religious character should be given to nuptials,\r\nas well as to other events of importance, by the invoking of divine\r\nhelp for the future union. In Hudson’s Island, says Turner, “hardly\r\nanything could be done without first making it known to the gods\r\nand begging a blessing, protection, or whatever the case might\r\nrequire.”[2570] Among the Dyaks, one of the eldest male members of\r\nthe assembled party smears at the wedding the hands of the bridegroom\r\nand bride with the blood of a pig and a fowl, implores the protection\r\nof the male spirit, Baak, and the female spirit, Hiroeh Bakak, and\r\nrecommends the married couple to their care, wishing them all sorts\r\nof earthly blessings.[2571] Among the Gonds, sacrifice to the gods,\r\nand unlimited gorging and spirit drinking are usually the wind-up of\r\nthe wedding.[2572] In Patagonia, the husband, after having brought\r\nthe bride into his hut, makes a sacrifice to the foul spirit; and the\r\nMacatecas, a tribe subject to the Mexican empire “fasted, prayed,\r\nand sacrificed to their gods for the space of twenty days after their\r\nmarriage.”[2573]\r\n\r\nMost commonly a priest is called to perform the religious rite. “The\r\nmarriages of the Fijians,” Wilkes says, “are sanctioned by religious\r\nceremonies.... The Ambati, or priest, takes a seat, having the\r\nbridegroom on his right and the bride on the left hand. He then invokes\r\nthe protection of the god or spirit upon the bride, after which he\r\nleads her to the bridegroom, and joins their hands with injunctions to\r\nlove, honour, and obey, to be faithful and die with each other.”[2574]\r\nThis, however, happens principally among the chiefs; among the common\r\npeople, the marriage rites are less ceremonious, the priest of the\r\ntribe only coming to the house and invoking happiness upon the\r\nunion.[2575] The Tahitians, too, considered the sanction of the gods\r\nessential to the marriage contract. The preliminaries being adjusted,\r\nthe parties repaired to the temple, where the priest addressed the\r\nbridegroom usually in the following terms:—“Will you not cast away\r\nyour wife?” to which the bridegroom answered, “No.” Turning to the\r\nbride, he proposed to her a like question, and received a similar\r\nanswer. The priest then addressed them both, saying, “Happy will it be\r\nif thus with you two.” He then offered a prayer to the gods on their\r\nbehalf, imploring that they might live in affection, and realize the\r\nhappiness marriage was designed to secure.[2576] In the Kingsmill\r\nIslands, the priest presses the foreheads of the young couple together,\r\nand pours on their heads a little cocoa-nut oil; then he takes a branch\r\nof a tree, dips it in water, and sprinkles their faces, at the same\r\ntime praying for their future happiness and prosperity.[2577] Among the\r\nKukis, the young couple are led before the Thémpoo, or priest, “who\r\npresents them with a stoup of liquor out of which they both drink,\r\nwhile he continues muttering some words in his unknown language;”[2578]\r\nand, among the Khyoungtha[2579] and Garos,[2580] a priest beseeches the\r\ngods to bless the union. Among the Igorrotes of Luzon it is a priestess\r\nthat performs the marriage ceremony, praying to the spirits of the\r\ndeceased in the presence of all the kinsfolk of the couple.[2581] The\r\nJakuts require the shaman’s assistance for their nuptials,[2582] and so\r\ndid formerly the Kalmucks.[2583]\r\n\r\nThe religious ceremonies connected with marriage are not limited to\r\nprayers, sacrifices, and other means of pleasing the gods; efforts are\r\nalso made to ascertain their will beforehand. In Siam, the parents of\r\nthe parties solicit the opinion of some fortune-teller on the point\r\nwhether the year, month, and day of the week when the couple were born,\r\nwill allow of their living happily together as husband and wife.[2584]\r\nAmong the Chukmas, “omens are carefully observed, and many a promising\r\nmatch has been put a stop to by unfavourable auguries.”[2585] The same\r\nis the case with other peoples of India,[2586] the Mongols,[2587]\r\nsome Turkish nations,[2588] &c. In several countries it is considered\r\na thing of the utmost importance to find out the right day for the\r\nwedding, by consulting the stars or otherwise.[2589]\r\n\r\nAmong civilized nations marriage is almost universally contracted\r\nwith religious ceremonies either with or without the assistance of a\r\npriest. The ancient Mexicans were married by their priests,[2590] and\r\nso were the Chibchas[2591] and Mayas.[2592] In Nicaragua, the priest,\r\nin performing the ceremony of marriage, took the parties by the little\r\nfinger, and led them to a fire which was kindled for the occasion. He\r\ninstructed them in their duty, and, when the fire became extinguished,\r\nthe parties were looked upon as husband and wife.[2593]\r\n\r\nBy Buddhist monks marriage is regarded only as a concession to human\r\nfrailty, and, in Buddhistic countries, it is therefore a simple civil\r\ncontract;[2594] nevertheless, it is commonly contracted with some\r\nreligious ceremony, and often with the assistance of a lama.[2595] In\r\nChina, the bridal pair are conducted to the ancestral hall, where they\r\nprostrate themselves before the altar, on which the ancestral tablets\r\nare arranged.[2596] Among the Hebrews, marriage was no religious\r\ncontract, and there is no trace of a priestly consecration of it either\r\nin the Scriptures or in the Talmud. Yet, according to Ewald, it may\r\nbe taken for granted that a consecration took place on the day of\r\nbetrothal or wedding, though the particulars have not been preserved in\r\nany ancient description.[2597] Among the Mohammedans also, marriage,\r\nthough a mere civil contract, is concluded with a prayer to Allah.[2598]\r\n\r\n“Les lois des peuples de l’antiquité,” M. Glasson says, “avaient un\r\ncaractère à la fois religieux et civil; il n’est donc pas étonnant\r\nqu’elles aient le plus souvent fait du mariage un acte à la fois\r\nreligieux et civil.”[2599] In Egypt, at least during the Ptolemaic\r\nperiod, the wedding is supposed to have been accompanied by a religious\r\nceremony.[2600] Among the ancient Persians, the betrothal was performed\r\nby a priest, who joined the hands of the couple whilst reading some\r\nprayers.[2601] The Hindus used by prayers and sacrifices to invoke\r\nthe help of the gods at their weddings.[2602] According to Sir W. H.\r\nMacnaghten, marriage is among them “not merely a civil contract, but a\r\nsacrament, forming the last of the ceremonies prescribed to the three\r\nregenerate classes, and the only one for Śudras; and an unmarried\r\nman has been declared to be incapacitated from the performance of\r\nreligious duties.”[2603] In Greece, marriages were generally, though\r\nnot always, contracted at the divine altars and confirmed by oaths,\r\nthe assistance of a priest, however, not being requisite. Before the\r\nmarriage was solemnized, the gods were consulted and their assistance\r\nimplored by prayers and sacrifices, which were usually offered to\r\nsome of the deities that superintended the union of the sexes, by the\r\nparents or other relations of the persons to be married. For marriage,\r\nas Musonius says, “stands under the protection of great and powerful\r\ngods;” and Plato teaches us that a man shall cohabit only with a woman\r\nwho has come into his house with holy ceremonies.[2604] From the\r\nHomeric age we have no instances of marriages being contracted with\r\nsacrifices and religious rites, but we must not therefore take for\r\ngranted that they were entirely wanting.[2605] The Teutons, according\r\nto Weinhold, looked upon marriage as an important and holy undertaking,\r\nabout which it was necessary that the gods should be consulted; and\r\nofferings were probably in use among all peoples of this branch of the\r\nAryan race.[2606] The Romans, at their nuptials, made a sacrifice,\r\nnamed _libum farreum_, to the gods, and the couple were united with\r\nprayer.[2607] In the mode of marriage called _confarreatio_, the\r\nPontifex Maximus seems to have instructed them in the formulas, and\r\nsome modern authorities even believe that he performed the marriage\r\nceremony. But Rossbach thinks that this was scarcely the case in early\r\ntimes, when every house-father himself was a priest.[2608] Besides\r\nsacrifices and prayers, auspices formed a very important part of a\r\nRoman wedding; and, if the gods were found to be opposed to the match,\r\nthe nuptials were put off or the match was abandoned. Even Cicero\r\nconsidered it wicked to marry without auspices.[2609]\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that, among primitive Aryans, religious\r\nceremonies were requisite for the validity of marriage.[2610] This was\r\ncertainly not the case in historical times either among the Greeks\r\nor among the Teutons; and at Rome such ceremonies were obligatory\r\nonly in _confarreatio_.[2611] But this form of marriage peculiar\r\nto the patricians, derived its origin from a very early period,\r\nand Rossbach remarks that the farther back we go in antiquity, the\r\nmore strictly we find the religious ceremonies attended to.[2612]\r\nIn _confarreatio_ they were essential even in the eye of the law,\r\nwhilst in _coemptio_ and _usus_ sacrifices and auspices were merely\r\nof secondary importance.[2613] Later on, when indifference to the old\r\nfaith increased, they became more and more uncommon, till at the end of\r\nthe period of the Pagan Emperors, they were almost exceptional, being\r\nregarded as a matter of no significance.[2614]\r\n\r\nChristianity gave back to marriage its religious character. The\r\nfounder of the Christian Church had not prescribed any ceremonies\r\nin connection with it, but in the earliest times the Christians, of\r\ntheir own accord, asked for their pastors’ benediction. This was not,\r\nindeed, a necessity, and for widows sacerdotal nuptials were not\r\neven allowed.[2615] Yet from St. Paul’s words, “Τὸ μυστήριον τοῦτο\r\nμέγα ἐστίν”[2616]—in the Vulgate translated, “Sacramentum hoc magnum\r\nest,”—the dogma that marriage is a sacrament was gradually developed.\r\nThough this dogma was fully recognized in the twelfth century,[2617]\r\nmarriage was, nevertheless, considered valid without ecclesiastical\r\nbenediction till the year 1563, when the Council of Trent made it an\r\nessentially religious ceremony.\r\n\r\nLuther’s opinion that all matrimonial affairs belong not to the\r\nChurch, but to the jurists, was not accepted by the legislators of the\r\nProtestant countries. Marriage certainly ceased to be thought of as a\r\nsacrament, but continued to be regarded by the Protestants as a Divine\r\ninstitution; hence sacerdotal nuptials remained as indispensable as\r\never.\r\n\r\nIt was the French Revolution that first gave rise to an alteration in\r\nthis respect. The constitution of the 3rd September, 1791, declares\r\nin its seventh article, title ii., “La loi ne considère le mariage\r\nque comme contrat civil. Le pouvoir législatif établira pour tous\r\nles habitants, sans distinction, le mode par lequel les naissances,\r\nmariages et décès seront constatés et il désignera les officiers\r\npublics qui en recevront les actes.”[2618] To this obligatory civil act\r\na sacerdotal benediction may be added, if the parties think proper.\r\n\r\nSince then civil marriage has gradually obtained a footing in the\r\nlegislation of most European countries, in proportion as liberty of\r\nconscience has been recognized. The French system has lately been\r\nadopted in Germany and Switzerland; whilst other nations have been\r\nless radical. “Tantôt,” says M. Glasson, “on a le choix entre le\r\nmariage civil ou le mariage religieux, en ce sens que l’union bénie à\r\nl’église vaut en même temps, d’après la loi, comme mariage civil: c’est\r\nce qui a lieu en Angleterre et en Espagne. Tantôt le mariage religieux\r\nest une condition de la validité du mariage civil, comme en Roumanie.\r\nEn Italie, on peut indifféremment célébrer l’une ou l’autre des deux\r\nunions la première. Enfin, il y a des pays où le mariage civil joue\r\nun rôle purement secondaire: en Autriche, en Portugal, en Suède, en\r\nNorwége, il est subsidiaire; en Russie il n’a été établi que pour les\r\nsectaires.”[2619]\r\n\r\nCivil marriage, implying the necessity of the union being sanctioned\r\nby secular authority, is not a merely European institution. Among the\r\nancient Peruvians, the king convoked annually, or every two years, at\r\nCuzco all the marriageable young men and maidens of his family. After\r\ncalling them by name, he joined their hands, and delivered them to\r\ntheir parents. Such marriages among that class were alone denominated\r\nlawful; and the governors and chiefs were, by their offices, obliged\r\nto marry, after the same formalities, the young men and women of the\r\nprovinces over which they presided.[2620] In Nicaragua also, marriage\r\nwas “a civil rite, performed by the cacique.”[2621] And among the\r\nsavage Pomo of California, who have two chiefs, a “war-chief” and a\r\n“peace-chief,” the latter, as being a kind of _censor morum_, has to\r\nperform the marriage ceremonies, so far as they extend, _i.e._, he\r\ncauses the parties to enter into a simple covenant in presence of their\r\nparents and friends.[2622] Again, among certain tribes no marriage\r\nis permitted without the chief’s approval. But such cases seem to be\r\nexceptions among non-European peoples, especially those of a lower\r\nculture, marriage being generally considered a private matter, with\r\nwhich the authorities or the community have nothing to do, if only it\r\ntakes place between persons who, by law or custom, are permitted to\r\nintermarry.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter reference has often been made to the validity of\r\nmarriage. A lawful marriage is, indeed, quite a different thing from\r\na marriage in the natural history sense of the term. The former,\r\nwhich is contracted under the formalities and in accordance with\r\nthe stipulations prescribed by the written or unwritten laws of the\r\ncountry, implies the recognition by society both of the validity of the\r\nunion and the legitimacy of the children. Every people is not so happy\r\nas the Nukahivans, among whom, according to Lisiansky, no such thing as\r\nillegitimacy is known.[2623] The Greeks regarded a union into which the\r\nwoman entered without dowry as concubinage, rather than as marriage.\r\nAmong other peoples purchase is the only way of contracting a valid\r\nmarriage. So it was with the ancient Germans and Scandinavians.[2624]\r\nSo it is with the Californian Karok, among whom the children of a\r\nwoman who is not purchased are accounted no better than bastards and\r\nconstitute a class of social outcasts who can intermarry only among\r\nthemselves.[2625] Often certain ceremonies are required for a marriage\r\nto be legal. Thus the Romans considered an alliance made without\r\n_sponsalia_, _nuptiæ_, and _dos_, concubinage.[2626] Among the Nez\r\nPercés in Oregon, the consent of the parents is all that is necessary\r\nfor a marriage to be valid; sometimes, when the parents refuse their\r\nconsent, a run-away match occurs, “but it is not regarded as a legal\r\nmarriage, and the woman thereafter is considered a prostitute, and is\r\ntreated accordingly.”[2627]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE FORMS OF HUMAN MARRIAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the lower animal species are by instinct either monogamous or\r\npolygynous. With man, every possible form of marriage occurs. There are\r\nmarriages of one man with one woman (monogamy), of one man with many\r\nwomen (polygyny), of many men with one woman (polyandry), and, in a few\r\nexceptional cases, of many men with many women.\r\n\r\nPolygyny was permitted by most of the ancient peoples with whom history\r\nacquaints us, and is, in our day, permitted by several civilized\r\nnations and the bulk of savage tribes.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Chibchas practised polygyny to a large extent.[2628] Among\r\nthe Mexicans[2629] and the Peruvian Incas,[2630] a married man might\r\nhave, besides his legitimate wife, less legitimate wives or concubines.\r\nThe same is the case in China and Japan, where the children of a\r\nconcubine have the same legal rights as the children of a wife.[2631]\r\nIn Corea, the mandarins are even bound by custom, besides having\r\nseveral wives, to retain several concubines in their “yamen.”[2632]\r\n\r\nTradition shows polygyny and concubinage to have been customary among\r\nthe Hebrews during the patriarchal age. Esau married Judith and\r\nBasemath, Jacob married Leah and Rachel.[2633] Later on, we read of\r\nSolomon, who had “seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred\r\nconcubines;”[2634] and of Rehoboam, who “took eighteen wives and\r\nthreescore concubines.”[2635] Indeed, polygyny was so much a matter of\r\ncourse that the law did not even criticize it.[2636] According to the\r\nTalmudic right also, it was permitted, though the number of legitimate\r\nwives was restricted to four.[2637] Among European Jews, it was still\r\npractised during the Middle Ages, and, among Jews living in Mohammedan\r\ncountries, it occurs even to this day.[2638] The Korân allows a man to\r\ntake four legitimate wives,[2639] and he may take as many concubines as\r\nhe likes. Between a wife and a concubine the difference is, indeed, not\r\ngreat: the former has her father as her protector, whilst the latter is\r\ndefenceless against the husband.[2640] A slave, on the other hand, is\r\nnot permitted to have more than two wives at the same time.[2641]\r\n\r\nDiodorus Siculus informs us that the Egyptians were not restricted to\r\nany number of wives, but that everyone married as many as he chose,\r\nwith the exception of the priesthood, who were by law confined to\r\none consort.[2642] The Egyptians had concubines also, most of whom\r\nappear to have been foreign women—war-captives or slaves; and these\r\nwere members of the family, ranking next to the wives and children\r\nof their lord, and probably enjoying a share of the property after\r\nhis death.[2643] With regard to the Assyrians, Professor Rawlinson\r\nstates that, so far as we have any real evidence, their kings appear\r\nas monogamists; but he thinks it is probable that they had a certain\r\nnumber of concubines.[2644] In Media, on the other hand, polygyny\r\nwas commonly practised among the more wealthy classes;[2645] and the\r\nPersian kings, particularly in later times, had a considerable number\r\nof wives and concubines.[2646]\r\n\r\nNone of the Hindu law-books restricts the number of wives whom a man is\r\npermitted to marry.[2647] We find undoubted cases of polygyny in the\r\nhymns of the ‘Rig-Veda,’[2648] and several passages in the ‘Laws of\r\nManu’ provide for a plurality of wives without any restriction.[2649]\r\nSpeaking of the modern Hindus, Mr. Balfour says, “By the law a Hindu\r\nmay marry as many wives, and by custom keep as many concubines, as he\r\nmay choose.”[2650]\r\n\r\nThe Greeks of the Homeric age frequently had concubines, who lived\r\nin the same house as the man’s family, and were regarded half as\r\nwives.[2651] Polygyny, in the fullest sense of the term, appears to be\r\nascribed to Priam, but to no one else.[2652] At a later period a kind\r\nof concubinage seems to have been recognized in Greece by law, and\r\nscarcely proscribed by public opinion;[2653] and bigamy was practised\r\nby the tyrants in some of the Greek colonies.[2654] The Romans were\r\nmore strictly monogamous. Among them, concubinage was always well\r\ndistinguished from legal marriage, and, according to Rossbach, was much\r\nless common in early times than subsequently.[2655]\r\n\r\nAmong the Teutons, at the beginning of their history, we come across\r\nplurality of wives in the West,[2656] and especially in the North.\r\nThe Scandinavian kings indulged in polygyny,[2657] and it does not\r\nseem to have been restricted to them only.[2658] Nor was it unknown to\r\nthe pagan Russians.[2659] In the Finnish poems, though polygyny is not\r\nmentioned, there are passages which seem to indicate that it was not\r\nentirely unheard of among the Finns of early times.[2660]\r\n\r\nEven in the Christian world open polygyny has occasionally been\r\npermitted, or at least tolerated. It was frequently practised by the\r\nMerovingian kings, and one law of Charles the Great seems to imply\r\nthat it was not unknown even among priests.[2661] Soon after the Peace\r\nof Westphalia, bigamy was allowed in some German States where the\r\npopulation had been largely reduced during the Thirty Years’ War. And\r\nin modern Europe polygyny, as Mr. Spencer remarks, long survived in the\r\ncustom which permitted princes to have many mistresses; “polygyny in\r\nthis qualified form remaining a tolerated privilege of royalty down to\r\nlate times.”[2662] Moreover, St. Augustin said expressly that he did\r\nnot condemn polygyny;[2663] and Luther allowed Philip the Magnanimous\r\nof Hessen, for political reasons, to marry two women. Indeed, he openly\r\ndeclared that, as Christ is silent about polygyny, he could not forbid\r\nthe taking of more than one wife.[2664] The Mormons, as all the world\r\nknows, regard polygyny as a divine institution.\r\n\r\nAmong many savage peoples polygyny is developed to an extraordinary\r\nextent. In Unyoro, according to Emin Pasha, it would be absolutely\r\nimproper for even a small chief to have fewer than ten or fifteen\r\nwives, and poor men have three or four each.[2665] Serpa Pinto tells\r\nus of a minister in the Barôze, who at the time of his visit to that\r\ncountry had more than seventy wives.[2666] In Fiji, the chiefs had from\r\ntwenty to a hundred wives;[2667] and, among all of the North American\r\ntribes visited by Mr. Catlin, “it is no uncommon thing to find a chief\r\nwith six, eight, or ten, and some with twelve or fourteen wives in\r\nhis lodge.”[2668] The King of Loango is said to have seven thousand\r\nwives.[2669]\r\n\r\nIt is a more noteworthy fact that among not a few uncivilized peoples,\r\npolygyny is almost unknown, or even prohibited. The Wyandots, according\r\nto Heriot, restricted themselves to one wife;[2670] and, among the\r\nIroquois, polygyny was not permitted, nor did it ever become a\r\npractice.[2671] It is said that, among the Californian Kinkla and\r\nYurok, no man has more than one wife.[2672] The Karok do not allow\r\nbigamy even to the chief; and, though a man may own as many women\r\nfor slaves as he can purchase, he brings obloquy upon himself if he\r\ncohabits with more than one.[2673] Nor does polygyny occur among the\r\nSimas, the Coco-Maricopas, and several other tribes on the banks of\r\nthe Gila and the Colorado;[2674] nor among the Moquis in New Mexico,\r\nand certain nations who inhabit the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.[2675] And,\r\nin several tribes of South America, the men are stated to have but one\r\nwife.[2676]\r\n\r\nThe Guanches of the Canary Islands, except the inhabitants of\r\nLancerote, lived in monogamy;[2677] and the same is the case with the\r\nQuissama tribe in Angola, the Touaregs, and the Beni-Mzab.[2678] Among\r\nall the Moorish tribes in the Western Sahara, Vincent did not meet a\r\nsingle man who had a plurality of wives.[2679]\r\n\r\nIn Asia we find many instances of strictly monogamous peoples. The\r\nVeddahs in Ceylon are so rigorous in this respect that infidelity\r\nnever seems to occur among them.[2680] In the Andaman Islands,\r\naccording to Mr. E. H. Man, “bigamy, polygamy, polyandry, and divorce\r\nare unknown;”[2681] and the Nicobar Islanders—at least those on the\r\nmost northern island, Car Nicobar—“have but one wife, and look upon\r\nunchastity as a very deadly sin.”[2682] Among the Koch and Old Kukis,\r\npolygyny and concubinage are forbidden;[2683] whilst, among the Pádams,\r\nMikris, and Munda Kols, a man, though not expressly forbidden to have\r\nmany wives, is blamed if he has more than one.[2684] The Badagas of\r\nthe Neilgherry Hills, the Nagas of Upper Assam, the Kisáns, and Meches\r\nconfine themselves to one consort at the same time;[2685] and so do\r\nthe Mrús and Toungtha, who do not consider it right for a master to\r\ntake advantage of his position even with regard to the female slaves\r\nin his house.[2686] Among the Santals, says Mr. E. G. Man, a woman\r\nreigns alone in her husband’s wigwam, “as there is seldom, if ever, a\r\nsecond wife or concubine to divide his affections—polygamy, although\r\nnot exactly prohibited, being not very popular with the tribe.”[2687]\r\nAmong the Karens of Burma,[2688] and certain tribes of Indo-China, the\r\nMalay Peninsula, and the Indian Archipelago, polygyny is said either\r\nto be forbidden[2689] or unknown.[2690] The Igorrotes of Luzon are\r\nso strictly monogamous, that, in case of adultery, the guilty party\r\ncan be compelled to leave the hut and the family for ever.[2691] The\r\nHill Dyaks marry but one wife, and a chief who once broke through this\r\ncustom lost all his influence; adultery is entirely unknown among\r\nthem.[2692] The Alfura of Minahassa were formerly monogamists, and the\r\noccasional occurrence of polygyny in later times, according to Dr.\r\nHickson, was a degeneration from the old customs, brought about perhaps\r\nby Mohammedan influence.[2693]\r\n\r\nIn Santa Christina or Tauata (Marquesas Islands), monogamy is said\r\nto be the exclusive form of marriage.[2694] Among the Papuans of\r\nDorey, not only is polygyny forbidden, but concubinage and adultery\r\nare unknown.[2695] In Australia, Mr. Curr has discovered some truly\r\nmonogamous tribes. In the Eucla tribe, “none of the men have more than\r\none wife;”[2696] among the Karawalla and Tunberri tribes, dwelling on\r\nthe Lower Diamantina, polygyny is not allowed;[2697] and in the Birria\r\ntribe, “the possession of more than one wife is absolutely forbidden,\r\nor was so before the coming of the whites.”[2698]\r\n\r\nIn certain American tribes the chiefs alone are permitted to have a\r\nplurality of wives.[2699] A similar exclusive privilege seems to have\r\nbeen granted to the nobility in ancient Peru.[2700] Among the Ainos\r\nof Yessy, according to v. Siebold only the chief of the village, and,\r\nin some places, the wealthier men are allowed to have more than one\r\nwife.[2701]\r\n\r\nEven where polygyny is permitted by custom or law, it is by no means\r\nso generally practised as is often supposed. Almost everywhere it is\r\nconfined to the smaller part of the people, the vast majority being\r\nmonogamous. We are told that, in the New Hebrides, “all the men are\r\npolygamists, generally having three or four wives apiece;”[2702] that\r\namong certain Kafir tribes, “the average number of wives to each\r\nmarried man amongst the common people is about three;”[2703] that,\r\namong the Masai, a poor man has generally two wives.[2704] But there\r\nis sufficient evidence that such peoples form exceptions to an almost\r\nuniversal rule.\r\n\r\nIn a ‘Sociological Study’ on the Lower Congo, Mr. Phillips remarks,\r\n“It is a mistaken opinion that in a polygamous society most men\r\nhave more than one wife: the relative numbers of the sexes forbid\r\nthe arrangement being extended to the whole population; really only\r\nthe wealthier can indulge in a plurality of wives, the poorer having\r\nto be content with one or often with none.”[2705] Proyart says the\r\nsame of the people of Loango, adding that the rich, who can use the\r\nprivilege of having many wives, are far from being numerous;[2706]\r\nand like statements are made with reference to several other negro\r\npeoples.[2707] Among many Kafir tribes,[2708] the Bechuanas,[2709]\r\nHottentots,[2710] and Eastern Central Africans,[2711] monogamy is the\r\nrule; whilst, amongst the Touaregs,[2712] Tedâ,[2713] Marea,[2714]\r\nBeni-Amer,[2715] &c.,[2716] polygyny is expressly stated to be confined\r\nto a few men only. “La plupart des Kabyles,” say Messrs. Honateau and\r\nLetournex, “n’ont ... qu’une femme;”[2717] and in Egypt, according to\r\nMr. Lane, not more than one husband in twenty has two wives.[2718] We\r\nmay, indeed, say with Munzinger[2719] that even in Africa, the chief\r\ncentre of polygynous habits, polygyny is an exception.\r\n\r\nIt is so among all Mohammedan peoples, in Asia and Europe, as well\r\nas in Africa.[2720] “In India,” says Syed Amír’ Alí, “more than\r\nninety-five per cent. of Mohammedans are at the present moment,\r\neither by conviction or necessity, monogamists. Among the educated\r\nclasses versed in the history of their ancestors, and able to compare\r\nit with the records of other nations, the custom is regarded with\r\ndisapprobation amounting almost to disgust. In Persia, according to\r\nColonel Macgregor’s statement, only two per cent. of the population\r\nenjoy the questionable luxury of a plurality of wives.[2721] Moreover,\r\nalthough polygyny is sanctioned by custom among the Cochin Chinese,\r\nthe Siamese, the Hindus, and many other races of India, the mass of\r\nthese peoples are in practice monogamous.[2722] In China, among the\r\nlabouring classes, it is rare to find more than one woman to one man,\r\nand Dr. Gray thinks that, in the earliest ages, concubinage was a\r\nprivilege of the wealthy classes only.[2723] Among the peoples of\r\nCentral and Northern Asia and, generally, among all the uncivilized or\r\nsemi-civilized peoples belonging to the Russian Empire, polygyny is,\r\nor, before the introduction of Christianity, was, an exception.[2724]\r\n\r\nIn the Indian Archipelago, says Mr. Crawfurd, polygyny and concubinage\r\nexist only among a few of the higher ranks, and may be looked upon\r\nas a kind of vicious luxury of the great, for it would be absurd to\r\nregard either one or the other as an institution affecting the whole\r\nmass of society.[2725] The truth of this assertion is fully confirmed\r\nby Raffles, as regards the Javanese; by Low and Boyle, as regards\r\nthe Malays of Sarawak; by Marsden, Wilken, and Forbes as regards the\r\nSumatrans; by Schadenberg, as regards the Aëtas of the Philippines; and\r\nso on.[2726]\r\n\r\nIn various parts of the Australian continent monogamy is said to be the\r\nrule.[2727] In the Larrakía tribe (Port Darwin), for instance, only\r\nabout ten per cent. of those who are married have two wives.[2728] In\r\nTasmania, polygyny, if not unknown, was quite exceptional.[2729] Among\r\nthe Maoris, according to Dieffenbach, it is “very uncommon.”[2730] In\r\nthe Sandwich Islands, it was practised only by the chiefs, whose means\r\nenabled them to maintain a plurality of wives.[2731] Indeed, in almost\r\nevery group of the Pacific Islands polygyny is expressly stated to be\r\nan exception.[2732]\r\n\r\nThe same is the case with the American aborigines.[2733] Dalager states\r\nthat, on the west coast of Greenland, in his time, hardly one man in\r\ntwenty had two wives, and it was still more uncommon for one man to\r\nhave three or four.[2734] Among the Thlinkets, as a rule, a man had but\r\none wife.[2735] The aborigines of Hispaniola, with the exception of\r\nthe king or chief, seemed to Columbus to live in monogamy.[2736] And\r\nMr. Bridges writes that, in Tierra del Fuego, polygyny is practised\r\n“in some districts very rarely, in others more frequently, but in no\r\npart generally.”\r\n\r\nAll the statements we have from the ancient world seem to indicate that\r\npolygyny was an exception. Speaking of the Hebrews, Dr. Scheppig says\r\nthat, although our information about the marital affairs of common\r\nHebrews is too scanty to entitle us to conclude, from the scarcity of\r\ncases of polygyny recorded, that such cases were actually rare, we may\r\nassume that keeping up several establishments was too expensive for any\r\nbut the rich.[2737] In Egypt, as we may infer from the numerous ancient\r\npaintings illustrative of domestic life in that country, polygyny\r\nwas of rare occurrence; and Herodotus expressly affirms that it was\r\ncustomary for the Egyptians to marry only one wife.”[2738] Spiegel\r\nthinks that the ancient Persians were as a rule monogamous,[2739]\r\nand Sir Henry Maine and Dr. Schrader make a similar suggestion as to\r\nthe early Indo-Europeans in general.[2740] Among the West Germans,\r\naccording to Tacitus, only a few persons of noble birth had a plurality\r\nof wives;[2741] and, in India, polygyny as a rule was confined to kings\r\nand wealthy lords.[2742] In a hymn of the ‘Rig-Veda,’ which dwells\r\nupon the duality of the two Aświns, the pairs of deities are compared\r\nwith pairs of almost everything that runs in couples, including a\r\nhusband and wife, and two lips uttering sweet sounds.[2743]\r\n\r\nWhere polygyny occurs, it is modified, as a rule, in ways that tend\r\ntowards monogamy: first, through the higher position granted to one\r\nof the wives, generally the first married; secondly, through the\r\npreference given by the husband to his favourite wife as regards sexual\r\nintercourse.\r\n\r\nAmong the Greenlanders,[2744] Thlinkets,[2745] Kaniagmuts,[2746]\r\nCrees,[2747] and probably most of the North American tribes who\r\npractise polygyny,[2748] the first married wife is the mistress of\r\nthe house. The Aleuts distinguish the first or real wife from the\r\nsubsequent wives by a special name.[2749] Among the Ahts, the children\r\nof a chief’s extra wives have not the father’s rank.[2750] The\r\nAlgonquins, says Heriot, permit two wives to one husband, but “the\r\none is considered of a rank superior to the other, and her children\r\nalone are accounted legitimate.”[2751] Among the Mexicans,[2752]\r\nMayas,[2753] Chibchas,[2754] and Peruvians,[2755] the first wife took\r\nprecedence of the subsequent wives, or, strictly speaking, they had\r\nonly one “true and lawful wife,” though as many concubines as they\r\nliked. In Nicaragua, bigamy, in the juridical sense of the term,\r\nwas punished by exile and confiscation of property;[2756] and, in\r\nMexico, neither the wives of “second rank” nor their children could\r\ninherit property.[2757] Among the Mosquitoes, Tamanacs, Uaupés,\r\nMundrucûs,[2758] and other South American peoples,[2759] the first\r\nwife generally has superiority in domestic affairs. Among the Brazilian\r\naborigines, however, no difference in rights exist between the children\r\nof different wives.[2760]\r\n\r\nThe first wife is superior in authority to the others among the\r\nWestern Victorians, Narrinyeri, Maoris,[2761] &c.[2762] In Samoa, a\r\nchief had, besides his wife, one, two, or three concubines;[2763] and\r\nin Tahiti, according to Ellis, it was rather a system of concubinage\r\nthan a plurality of wives, that prevailed among the higher chiefs, the\r\nwoman to whom the chief was first united in marriage, or whose rank\r\nwas nearest his own, being generally considered his wife in the proper\r\nsense of the term, while the others held an inferior position.[2764]\r\n\r\nIn the Indian Archipelago, according to Mr. Crawfurd, the wife of the\r\nfirst marriage is always the real mistress of the family; the rest are\r\noften little better than her hand-maids.[2765] The same holds good for\r\nthe Burmese, according to Lieutenant-General Fytche; for the Santals,\r\naccording to Colonel Dalton.[2766] In Siam, “the wife who has been the\r\nobject of the marriage ceremony ‘khan mak’ takes precedence of all\r\nthe rest, and she and her descendants are the only legal heirs to the\r\nhusband’s possessions.”[2767] Among the Khamtis, Samoyedes,[2768] and\r\nother Asiatic peoples,[2769] the first wife is always the mistress of\r\nthe household and the most respected in the family; whilst, among the\r\nAinos,[2770] Mongols, and Tangutans,[2771] one man can take only one\r\nlawful wife, though as many concubines as he pleases. But, except among\r\nthe Ainos, the children of concubines are illegitimate and have no\r\nshare in the inheritance.\r\n\r\nThe polygyny of China is a legalized concubinage, and the law actually\r\nprohibits the taking of a second wife during the lifetime of the\r\nfirst.[2772] The wife is invested with a certain amount of power over\r\nthe concubines, who may not even sit in her presence without special\r\npermission.[2773] She addresses her partner with a term corresponding\r\nto our “husband,” whilst the concubines call him “master.”[2774]\r\nThese are generally women with large feet and of low origin, not\r\nunfrequently slaves or prostitutes; whereas the wife is almost\r\ninvariably, except of course in the case of Tartar ladies, a woman\r\nwith small feet.[2775] A wife cannot be degraded to the position of\r\na concubine, nor can a concubine be raised to the position of a wife\r\nso long as the wife is alive, under a penalty in the one case of a\r\nhundred, in the other of ninety blows.[2776] But the question upon\r\nwhich the legitimacy of the offspring depends, is not whether the woman\r\nis wife or concubine, but whether she has been received into the house\r\nof the man or not.[2777] In Mohammedan countries, in households where\r\ntwo or more wives belong to one man, the first married generally enjoys\r\nthe highest rank; she is called “the great lady,” and is commonly\r\nunited with her husband for life. But all the children of the man are\r\nconsidered equally legitimate, even those born of female slaves.[2778]\r\n\r\nAmong the negro peoples, the principal wife, to whom the housekeeping\r\nand command over all the rest are intrusted, is in most cases the one\r\nfirst married. She has certain privileges, and in many cases can be\r\nrepudiated only if she has been unfaithful to her husband.[2779] Among\r\nthe Edeeyahs of Fernando Po, it was for the first wife alone that a\r\nman had to serve several years with his father-in-law.[2780] Speaking\r\nof the Eastern Central African tribes, Mr. Macdonald says, “As a\r\nrule, a man has one wife that is free, while the other three or four\r\nare slaves.... The chief wife is generally the woman that was married\r\nfirst.... The chief wife has the superintendence of the domestic and\r\nagricultural establishment. She keeps the others at their work, and\r\nhas power to exercise discipline upon them.” Generally, it is only by\r\ninheriting the possessions of an elder brother that a man procures more\r\nthan one free wife.[2781] Among the Damaras and other South African\r\ntribes, the eldest son of the principal or first wife inherits his\r\nfather’s property.[2782] Speaking of the Basutos, Mr. Casalis observes,\r\n“A very marked distinction exists between the first wife and those\r\nwho succeed her. The choice of the ‘great’ wife (as she is always\r\ncalled) is generally made by the father, and is an event in which all\r\nthe relations are interested. The others, who are designated by the\r\nname of ‘serete’ (heels), because they must on all occasions hold an\r\ninferior position to the mistress of the house, are articles of luxury,\r\nto which the parents are not obliged to contribute.” The chief of the\r\nBasutos, when asked by foreigners how many children he has, alludes in\r\nhis answer only to those of his first wife; and, if he says he is a\r\nwidower, this means that he has lost his real wife, and has not raised\r\nany of his concubines to the rank she occupied.[2783] Among the Zulus,\r\nthe chief wife is the one first married,[2784] and this is often, but\r\nnot always, the case among the Kafirs.[2785] According to Rochon,\r\npolygyny in Madagascar is, in fact, a sort of concubinage.[2786]\r\n\r\nEber suggests that the kings of ancient Egypt, although they might\r\nhave many concubines, had only one real wife, as there is no\r\ninstance of two consorts given in the inscriptions.[2787] Professor\r\nRawlinson makes a similar remark as to the polygyny of the Persian\r\nkings.[2788] Regarding the Hindus, Mr. Mayne says, “A peculiar\r\nsanctity ... seems to have been attributed to the first marriage, as\r\nbeing that which was contracted from a sense of duty, and not merely\r\nfor personal gratification. The first married wife had precedence\r\nover the others, and her first-born son over his half-brothers. It\r\nis probable that originally the secondary wives were considered as\r\nmerely a superior class of concubines, like the hand-maids of the\r\nJewish patriarchs.”[2789] It was necessary that the first married\r\nwife should be of the same caste as her husband.[2790] She sat by him\r\nat marriages and other religious ceremonies, was head of the family,\r\nand entitled to adopt a son if she had no sons at the time of her\r\nhusband’s death.[2791] The modified polygyny of the ancient Assyrians\r\nand Greeks has been already noted. The ancient Scandinavians had\r\nalmost always only one legitimate wife, though as many concubines\r\nas they chose.[2792] Touching the Pagan Russians, Ewers says that\r\nof the wives of a prince one probably had precedence.[2793] Among\r\nthe Mormons, Sir R. F. Burton observes, “the first wife, as among\r\npolygamists generally, is _the_ wife and assumes the husband’s name and\r\ntitle.”[2794]\r\n\r\nThe difference in the position held by the several wives belonging to\r\none man, shows itself also in the demand of various peoples that the\r\nfirst wife shall be of the husband’s rank, whilst the succeeding wives\r\nmay be of lower birth.[2795]\r\n\r\nAs just mentioned, there is another way in which polygyny is modified.\r\nAmong certain peoples the husband is bound by custom or law to cohabit\r\nwith his wives in turn. The Caribs, when they married several sisters\r\nat the same time, lived a month with each in her separate hut.[2796]\r\nAmong the wild Indians of Chili, according to Mr. Darwin, the cazique\r\nlives a week in turn with each of his wives.[2797] The Kafirs have an\r\nold traditional law requiring a husband who has many wives to devote\r\nthree succeeding days and nights to each of them.[2798] A Mohammedan\r\nis obliged to visit his four legal wives by turns;[2799] and the same\r\ncustom prevails, according to Krasheninnikoff, in Kamchatka.[2800]\r\nThe negroes often follow a like rule in order to keep peace in the\r\nfamily.[2801] And, in Samoa, the system adopted when a person has\r\nseveral wives, “is to allow each wife to enjoy three days’ supremacy\r\nin rotation.”[2802] But such arrangements are, no doubt, exceptions,\r\nand it is doubtful whether, in these cases, theory and practice\r\ncoincide.[2803] A marriage may, in fact, be monogamous, though, from a\r\njuridical point of view, it is polygynous.\r\n\r\n“It is not uncommon for an Indian,” says Carver, “although he takes\r\nto himself so many wives, to live in a state of continence with many of\r\nthem for several years,” and those who do not succeed in pleasing the\r\nhusband may “continue in their virgin state during the whole of their\r\nlives.”[2804] Among the Apaches, the chiefs “can have any number of\r\nwives they choose, but one only is the favourite.”[2805] In Bokhara,\r\na rich man generally has two, three, or four wives; yet, according\r\nto Georgi, one of them, as a rule, holds precedence in the husband’s\r\nlove.[2806] Speaking of the modern Egyptians, Mr. Lane says, “In\r\ngeneral, the most beautiful of a man’s wives or slaves is, of course,\r\nfor a time his greatest favourite; but in many—if not most—cases,\r\nthe lasting favourite is not the most handsome.”[2807] Sometimes the\r\nwife who has proved most fruitful and given birth to the healthiest\r\nchildren is most favoured by the husband;[2808] and, among the Indians\r\nof Western Washington and North-Western Oregon, according to Dr. Gibbs,\r\nthe man usually lives with his first wife, at least after his interest\r\nin subsequent wives has cooled down.[2809] But it is generally the\r\nyoungest wife who is the favourite. An Arabian Sheik said to Sir S. W.\r\nBaker, “I have four wives; as one has become old, I have replaced\r\nher with a young one; here they all are (he now marked four strokes\r\nupon the sand with his stick). This one carries water; that grinds the\r\ncorn; this makes the bread; the last does not do much, as she is the\r\nyoungest, and my favourite.”[2810] In Guiana, “an Indian is never\r\nseen with two young wives; the only case in which he takes a second\r\nis when the first has become old.” The first wife certainly retains\r\nthe management of domestic affairs, but she no longer possesses the\r\nhusband’s love.[2811] Statements to a similar effect are made regarding\r\nthe Arabs of the Sahara, Tahitians, Central Asiatic Turks, Mormons,\r\n&c.[2812]\r\n\r\nBigamy is the most common form of polygyny, and a multitude of wives is\r\nthe luxury of a few despotic rulers or very wealthy men. The Eskimo,\r\nfor example, have rarely more than two wives, and a Greenlander who\r\ntook a third or fourth was blamed by his countrymen, as we are told\r\nby Cranz.[2813] The tribes of Oregon generally confine themselves to\r\na couple of wives.[2814] Bishop Salvado never knew a West Australian\r\nnative with more than two—“à moins peut-être que par générosité un\r\nhomme ne prenne sous sa protection la femme de son ami ou parent\r\nabsent; ou bien que par voie d’hérédité il n’adopte les veuves de son\r\nfrère.”[2815] Rich Kafirs are stated to have commonly two or three\r\nwives;[2816] and Colonel Dalton does not recollect that, among the\r\nKhamtis, he ever met with a case in which more than two women were\r\nmarried to one husband.[2817] The Hebrews who indulged in polygyny were\r\ngenerally bigamists.[2818]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPolyandry is a much rarer form of marriage than polygyny. In\r\nOonalashka, one of the Aleutian Islands, according to v. Langsdorf, a\r\nwoman sometimes lived with two husbands who agreed between themselves\r\nupon the conditions on which they were to share her.[2819] Among the\r\nKaniagmuts, two or three men occasionally had a wife in common;[2820]\r\nand Veniaminoff tells us that in ancient times a Thlinket woman,\r\nbesides her real husband, could have a legal paramour, who usually\r\nwas the brother of the husband.[2821] Among the Eskimo also, “two men\r\nsometimes marry the same woman.”[2822] Father Lafitau writes, “Par\r\nune suite de la Gynécocratie, la polygamie, qui n’est pas permise aux\r\nhommes, l’est pourtant aux femmes chez les Iroquois Tsonnontouans,\r\noù il en est, lesquelles ont deux maris, qu’on regarde comme\r\nlégitimes.”[2823] Among the Avanos and Maypurs, along the Orinoco, v.\r\nHumboldt found that brothers often had but one wife;[2824] according to\r\nMr. Brett, the Warraus do not consider the practice of one woman having\r\ntwo husbands to be bad; and he mentions an instance of a woman amongst\r\nthem having even three.[2825]\r\n\r\nIn Nukahiva, as we are told by Lisiansky, in rich families every\r\nwoman had two husbands, of whom one might be called the assistant\r\nhusband.[2826] In New Caledonia, according to M. Moncelon, polyandry\r\ndoes not seem to have been entirely unknown;[2827] and Mr. Radfield\r\nwrites to me from Lifu that an old man knew of three cases of\r\npolyandrous marriage having occurred in that island, but the husbands\r\nwere despised by the rest of the natives. In two of these cases the\r\nhusbands were brothers, in the third they were unrelated. It is said\r\nthat, among the Tasmanians, “polyandry, or something very like it,\r\nexisted;”[2828] but this statement, if correct, refers to altogether\r\nexceptional cases.\r\n\r\nBontier and Le Verrier assert that, in the island of Lancerote, of the\r\nCanaries, most women had three husbands.[2829] Thunberg observes that,\r\namong the Hottentots, there were women who married two men.[2830] Dr.\r\nFritsch mentions the existence of polyandry among the Damaras, and\r\nMr. Theal among the mountain tribes of the Bantu race.[2831] The Hovas\r\nof Madagascar have a word to express the leave given to a wife to have\r\nintercourse with another man during a husband’s prolonged absence from\r\nhome.[2832]\r\n\r\nUntil prohibited by the governor, Sir Henry Ward, about the year 1860,\r\npolyandry prevailed among the Sinhalese throughout the interior of\r\nCeylon, one woman having in many cases three or four husbands, and\r\nin others five or six or even seven. It is recorded that the same\r\npractice was at one time universal throughout the island, except among\r\nthe Veddahs,[2833] and even now it occurs in spite of government\r\ninterdict.[2834] The husbands are usually members of the same family,\r\nand most frequently brothers.\r\n\r\nAmong the Todas, all brothers of one family, be they many or few, live\r\nin mixed cohabitation with one or more wives. “If there be four or\r\nfive brothers,” says Dr. Shortt, “and one of them, being old enough,\r\ngets married, his wife claims all the other brothers as her husbands,\r\nand, as they successively attain manhood, she consorts with them; or,\r\nif the wife has one or more younger sisters, they in turn, on attaining\r\na marriageable age, become the wives of their sister’s husband or\r\nhusbands.... Owing, however, to the great scarcity of women in this\r\ntribe, it more frequently happens that a single woman is wife to\r\nseveral husbands, sometimes as many as six.”[2835] The same practice\r\noccurs among the Kurgs of Mysore.[2836] Among the Nairs of Malabar,\r\nit is the custom for one woman “to have attached to her two males,\r\nor four, or perhaps more, and they cohabit according to rules.”[2837]\r\nPolyandry is also found among the Miris, Dophlas, Butlas,[2838]\r\nSissee Abors,[2839] Khasias,[2840] and Santals.[2841] It prevails\r\nin the Siwalik mountains, Sirmore,[2842] Ladakh,[2843] the Jounsar\r\nand Bawar hill districts attached to the Doon,[2844] Kunawar,[2845]\r\nKotegarh,[2846] and, especially, in Tibet. This custom exists, as\r\nMr. Wilson asserts, “all over the country of the Tibetan-speaking\r\npeople; that is to say, from China to the dependencies of Kashmir\r\nand Afghanistan, with the exception of Sikkim, and some other of the\r\nprovinces on the Indian side of the Himalaya, where, though the Tibetan\r\nlanguage may in part prevail, yet the people are either Aryan in race,\r\nor have been much influenced by Aryan ideas.”[2847] Polyandry is said\r\nto occur among the Saporogian Cossacks;[2848] and Mr. Ravenstein\r\nquotes a statement of a Japanese traveller that it prevails among the\r\nSmerenkur Gilyaks in Eastern Siberia.[2849]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Nairs, Khasias, and Saporogian Cossacks, the\r\nhusbands in almost every one of these cases are stated to be brothers.\r\nA colonel who lived among the Kulus of Kotegarh for twenty-five\r\nyears assures us that, among that people, the husbands are always\r\nbrothers;[2850] and, so far as Mr. Wilson could learn, the polyandry\r\nof Central Asia must be limited to the marriage of one woman to two or\r\nmore brothers, no other form being found there.[2851]\r\n\r\nA very curious kind of polyandry prevails, according to Dr. Shortt,\r\namong the Reddies. It often happens that a young woman of sixteen\r\nor twenty years of age is married to a boy of five or six years, or\r\neven of a tenderer age. After marriage the wife lives with some other\r\nman, a near relation on the maternal side, frequently an uncle, and\r\nsometimes with her boy-husband’s own father, the progeny so begotten\r\nbeing affiliated to the boy-husband. When he comes of age he finds his\r\nwife an old woman, and perhaps past child-bearing. So he, in his turn,\r\ntakes possession of the wife of some other boy, who will nominally be\r\nthe father of her children.[2852] A similar custom is said to exist\r\namong the Vellalah caste in the Coimbore district,[2853] and prevailed,\r\ntill the emancipation of the serfs, among the Russian peasants, the\r\nfather being in the habit of cohabiting with the wife of his son during\r\nthe son’s minority.[2854] Ahlqvist mentions the occurrence of the same\r\npractice among the Ostyaks,[2855] v. Haxthausen among the Ossetes.[2856]\r\n\r\nPassing to ancient nations, we find indications of polyandry in a hymn\r\nin the ‘Rig-Veda,’ which is addressed to the two Aświns,[2857], and\r\nin the Mahâbhârata, where Draupadi is represented as won at an archery\r\nmatch by the eldest of the five Pandava princes, and as then becoming\r\nthe wife of all. According to Strabo, polyandry occurred in Media, and\r\nin Arabia Felix, where all male members of the same family married\r\none woman.[2858] Ma-touan-lin states that, among the Massagetæ, the\r\nbrothers had one wife in common, and when a man had no brothers he\r\nassociated with other men, as otherwise he was obliged to live single\r\nthrough the whole of his life.[2859] We have in the Irish Nennius\r\ndirect evidence of the existence of polyandry among the Picts,[2860]\r\nand of the ancient Britons Cæsar says that “by tens and by twelves\r\nhusbands possessed their wives in common, and especially brothers\r\nwith brothers, and parents with children.”[2861] Among the ancient\r\nScandinavians we possibly find a trace of this custom in the mythic\r\nstatement that the goddess Frigg, during the absence of her husband\r\nOdin, was married to his brothers Vili and Ve.[2862]\r\n\r\nAmong the peoples of America, Africa, and the Pacific Islands, just\r\nreferred to, polyandry, in almost every case, is confined to a very\r\nsmall part of the population; and among the polyandrous nations\r\nof India and Central Asia it is by no means the exclusive form\r\nof marriage. Sir Emerson Tennent says that, in Ceylon, polyandry\r\nprevails chiefly among the wealthier classes, whilst, according to\r\nDr. Davy, it is “more or less general among the high and low, the\r\nrich and poor,” other forms of marriage, however, being by no means\r\nexcluded.[2863] Among the Todas, “any degree of complication in\r\nperfectly lawful wedded life may be met with, from the sample of\r\nthe single man living with the single wife, to that of the group of\r\nrelatives married to a group of wives.”[2864] Mr. Balfour says that\r\n“the practice of polyandry does not seem to have ever prevailed\r\ngenerally amongst the Nairs and many of the Teeyer of North Malabar,\r\nfrom Kurumbranad to Mangalore.”[2865] Among the Miris there are only\r\na few instances of this custom.[2866] Of the Dophlas those who can\r\nafford it are polygynists.[2867] Among the Khasias, polyandry “can be\r\nsaid to prevail only among the poorer sort, with whom, too, it would\r\noften seem to mean rather facility of divorce than the simultaneous\r\nadmission of a plurality of husbands.”[2868] Among the Santals, the\r\nwife of the eldest brother _may_ be at the same time a wife for the\r\nyounger brothers also.[2869] The Sissee Abors have often as many wives\r\nas they can afford to buy;[2870] and in the Kunawar valley, polyandry\r\nis common only in the upper part of the valley, whilst polygyny\r\nprevails in the lower part.[2871] In the Kotegarh valley, according\r\nto Dr. Stulpnagel, the practice of polyandry is not universal; it\r\ncan scarcely be said to be even very common. “If diligently searched\r\nfor,” he observes, “single cases of polyandry will be found in the\r\nKôtgadh parganâ, in Kulu, in the territory of the Rânâs of Komarsen\r\nand Kaneti, and in Bussahir.... Though common enough in Kunawar at\r\nthe present day, it exists side by side with polygamy and monogamy.\r\nIn one house there may be three brothers with one wife; in the next\r\nthree brothers with four wives, all alike in common; in the next house\r\nthere may be a man with three wives to himself; in the next a man with\r\nonly one wife.”[2872] Among the Butias, or Botis, of Ladakh, according\r\nto Sir Alexander Cunningham, polyandry prevails “only among the\r\npoorer classes, for the rich, as in all Eastern countries, generally\r\nhave two or three wives, according to their circumstances.”[2873]\r\nIn the Jounsar and Bawah pargannahs, polyandry is almost universal,\r\nbut it is apparently unknown in the hills of Garhwal on the east,\r\nor those of the Simla superintendency on the west.[2874] Nowhere,\r\nexcept perhaps in the Neilgherry Hills, has polyandry prevailed more\r\nextensively than in Tibet; but it is not the only form of marriage.\r\nAccording to Captain J. D. Cunningham, “even among the Lamaic\r\nTibetans any casual influx of wealth, as from trade or other sources,\r\nimmediately leads to the formation of separate establishments by the\r\nseveral members of a house.”[2875] We may thus take for granted that\r\npolyandry, although frequently practised in certain parts of India and\r\nCentral Asia,[2876] nowhere excludes the simultaneous occurrence of\r\nother forms of marriage. The instances of ancient Aryan polyandry in\r\nIndia evidently form exceptions to the general rule among the people\r\nof the Vedic period. The father of Draupadi is represented by the\r\ncompilers of the epic as shocked at the proposal of the princes to\r\nmarry his daughter:—“You who know the law,” he says, “must not commit\r\nan unlawful act which is contrary to usage and the Vedas.” In the\r\nRâmâyana, the giant Virâdha attacks the two divine brothers Râma and\r\nLakshmana and their wife Sítâ, saying, “Why do you two devotees remain\r\nwith one woman? Why are you, O profligate wretches, corrupting the\r\ndevout sages?”[2877] And in the ‘Aitareya Brâhmana’ we read that “one\r\nman has many wives, but one wife has not many husbands at the same\r\ntime.”[2878] Indeed, with the exception of the Massagetæ, the account\r\nof whom cannot be critically checked, there is no people among whom\r\npolyandry is stated to be the only recognized form of marriage.\r\n\r\nLike polygyny, polandry is modified in directions tending towards\r\nmonogamy. As one, usually the first married, wife in polygynous\r\nfamilies is the chief wife, one, usually the first, husband in\r\npolyandrous families is the chief husband. This was the case with\r\nthe Aleuts, among whom, according to Erman, the secondary husband\r\nwas generally a hunter or wandering trader; and with the Kaniagmuts,\r\namong whom, as we have already seen, he acted as husband and master\r\nof the house during the absence of the true lord. Upon the latter’s\r\nreturn, the deputy not only yielded to him his place, but became in\r\nthe meantime his servant.[2879] In Nukahiva, the subordinate partner\r\nsometimes was chosen after marriage, “but in general,” says Lisiansky,\r\n“two men present themselves to the same woman, who, if she approves\r\ntheir addresses, appoints one for the real husband, and the other\r\nas his auxiliary; the auxiliary is generally poor, but handsome and\r\nwell-made.”[2880]\r\n\r\nIn Ladakh, according to Moorcraft and Trebeck, should there be several\r\nbrothers in a family, the juniors, if they agree to the arrangement,\r\nbecome inferior husbands to the wife of the elder; all the children,\r\nhowever, are supposed to belong to the head of the family. The younger\r\nbrothers have, indeed, no authority; they wait upon the elder as his\r\nservants, and can be turned out of doors at his pleasure, without\r\nits being incumbent upon him to provide for them. On the death of\r\nthe eldest brother, his property, authority, and widow devolve upon\r\nhis next brother.[2881] In Kamaon, too, where the brothers of a\r\nfamily all marry one wife, the children are attributed to the eldest\r\nbrother.[2882] The same is the case in the Jounsar district, as it\r\nwas formerly with the Massagetæ.[2883] Touching the polyandrous\r\ntribes of Arabia Felix, Strabo tells us that the eldest brother was\r\nthe ruler of the family, and that the common wife spent the nights\r\nwith him.[2884] Among the ancient Britons, as described by Cæsar, the\r\nchildren were regarded as belonging to him who had first taken the\r\nvirgin to wife.[2885] In Tibet, the choice of a wife is the right of\r\nthe elder brother, and the contract he makes is understood to involve\r\na marital contract with all the other brothers, if they choose to\r\navail themselves of it. The children call the eldest husband father,\r\nthe younger husbands uncles.[2886] Among the Todas also, the eldest\r\nbrother seems to be the real husband. “If the husband has brothers or\r\nvery near relatives, all living together,” says Mr. Marshall, “they\r\nmay each, if both she and he consent, participate in the right to be\r\nconsidered her husband also, on making up a share of the dowry that has\r\nbeen paid.”[2887] Again, in Spiti, where polyandry no longer prevails,\r\nthe same object is attained by the custom of primogeniture, by which\r\nonly the eldest son marries, while the younger sons become monks.[2888]\r\nSpeaking of the Khyoungtha, a Chittagong Hill tribe, Captain Lewin\r\nobserves, “After marriage a younger brother is allowed to touch the\r\nhand, to speak and laugh with his elder brother’s wife; but it is\r\nthought improper for an elder even to look at the wife of his younger\r\nbrother. This is a custom more or less among all hill tribes; it is\r\nfound carried to even a preposterous extent among the Santals.”[2889]\r\nIn this custom there is perhaps a trace of ancient polyandry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSumming up the results reached in this chapter, we may safely say that,\r\nalthough polygyny occurs among most existing peoples, and polyandry\r\namong some, monogamy is by far the most common form of human marriage.\r\nIt was so also among the ancient peoples of whom we have any direct\r\nknowledge. Monogamy is the form which is generally recognized as\r\nlegal and permitted. The great majority of peoples are, as a rule,\r\nmonogamous, and the other forms of marriage are usually modified in a\r\nmonogamous direction.\r\n\r\nWe have still to inquire how the matter stood in early times, and to\r\ntrace the general development of the forms of human marriage. But, in\r\naccordance with our method of investigation, we must first examine the\r\ncauses by which these forms have been influenced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE FORMS OF HUMAN MARRIAGE\r\n\r\n(_Continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has also been asserted that monogamy is the natural form of human\r\nmarriage because there is an almost equal number of men and women. But\r\nthis is by no means the case. The numerical proportion between the\r\nsexes varies, and in some cases varies greatly, among different peoples.\r\n\r\nIn the whole district of Nutka, it seemed to Meares that there were\r\nnot so many women as men, whereas, further north, the women decidedly\r\npreponderated.[2890] Among the Kutchin, according to Kirby, women\r\nform the minority;[2891] and they seem to hold the same position\r\namong the Upper Californians and Western Eskimo.[2892] But as a rule,\r\namong the North American aborigines, the opposite is apparently the\r\ncase. Thus there are more women than men among certain Eskimo tribes,\r\naccording to Dr. King; among the natives of the Sitka Islands,\r\naccording to Lisiansky; among the Californian Shastika, according to\r\nMr. Powers.[2893] The census of the Creeks taken in the year 1832\r\nshowed 6,555 men and 7,142 women; that of the Indian population around\r\nLakes Superior, Huron, Michigan, the Upper Mississippi, &c., in\r\nthe same year, 3,144 men and 3,571 women, excluding children, that\r\nof the Nez Percés in Oregon, taken in 1851 by Dr. Dart, 698 men and\r\n1,182 women.[2894] Among the Blackfeet and Shiyann, according to Mr.\r\nMorgan—among the Puncahs and some other tribes, according to Mr.\r\nCatlin—the number of women is said to be twice as large as that of men,\r\nand in some cases even three times as large.[2895]\r\n\r\nIn Yucatan, according to Stephens, there are two women to one man;\r\namong the Guaranies, according to Azara, fourteen women to thirteen\r\nmen; in Cochabamba, according to Gibbon, even five to one.[2896]\r\nAmong the Zapotecs and other nations of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec,\r\nthe women are greatly in excess of the men;[2897] whereas, among the\r\nTarumas,[2898] Avanos, Maypurs,[2899] and Guanas,[2900] the men are\r\nstated to be more numerous than the women. Von Martius says that among\r\nthe Indians of Brazil, the number varied in some villages in favour of\r\nthe male sex, in others in favour of the female.[2901]\r\n\r\nIn Australia the men seem generally to be in the majority.[2902]\r\nSpeaking of the Australian natives, the Rev. L. Fison says, “I think\r\nwe may suppose that the number of males generally exceeds that of\r\nfemales among the lower savages; at least, quite a number of observers\r\ndeclare that such is the fact.”[2903] Among the Western Australians,\r\naccording to Mr. Oldfield, at all times the males are in excess of the\r\nother sex.”[2904] Wilhelmi makes a similar statement with regard to\r\nseveral other tribes;[2905] but this rule does not apply to all the\r\nAustralians. “On Herbert River,” says Herr Lumholtz, “the women are\r\nmore numerous than the men; this is also the case among the tribes\r\nsouth-west of the Carpentarian Gulf and elsewhere. But, according to\r\naccurate observations, the opposite is the case in a large part of\r\nAustralia.”[2906] In some tribes of the interior, Mr. Sturt found that\r\namong children there were about two girls to one boy.[2907]\r\n\r\nIn Tasmania, according to Breton, the men greatly exceeded the women\r\nin number.[2908] So also in Tahiti, where, at the time of Mr. Ellis’s\r\narrival, there were probably four or five men to one woman;[2909] in\r\nMaupiti, where the disproportion between the sexes among adults was\r\nat the rate of three men to two women;[2910] and in Easter Island,\r\nwhere, according to the estimates of Cook and La Pérouse, the men\r\nwere twice as numerous as the women.[2911] In the Sandwich Islands,\r\nNukahiva, and some islands belonging to the Solomon Group, the male\r\nsex predominated;[2912] and among the Maoris, according to a census\r\ntaken in the year 1881, there were 24,370 men and 19,729 women.[2913]\r\nIn Makin Island, of the Kingsmill Group, on the other hand, Wood\r\nrepresented the women as outnumbering the men.[2914] The same was to a\r\nvery great extent the case in Tukopia;[2915] and d’Albertis says that\r\nin Naiabui, a village in New Guinea with 300 inhabitants, “there are\r\nmore women than men by about a third.”[2916] Both sexes are nearly\r\nequally represented at Port Moresby,[2917] and according to Marsden,\r\nin Sumatra.[2918] In Sarawak the women are less numerous than the\r\nmen.[2919]\r\n\r\nIn Ceylon a considerable disparity is exhibited by the returns.\r\nAccording to Pridham, it is found in the greatest degree among the\r\nSinhalese, among whom the surplus of men averages twelve per cent.,\r\nbut it is also observable in the case of the Malabar population in\r\nthe northern province, where the surplus of men averages six per\r\ncent.[2920] Robert Orme states that, in India, the number of women\r\nexceeds that of men;[2921] but this is certainly not the case in every\r\npart of the country. In a census of the North-West Provinces, taken\r\nduring the year 1866, the proportions between the sexes were found to\r\nbe 100 men to 86·6 women, and, in the Panjab, even 100 to 81·8.[2922]\r\nIn some districts of the Himalayas there is a surplus of males, in\r\nothers of females.[2923] In Kashmir, the proportion of men to women\r\nis as three to one.[2924] In the Buddhist country of Ladakh, says Sir\r\nA. Cunningham, “it will be observed that the females outnumber the\r\nmales, while the reverse is the case in the Mussulman districts along\r\nthe Indus.”[2925] In Malwa, in Central India, the number of women\r\nsurpasses the number of men,[2926] and the same, according to Sir John\r\nBowring, is to a great extent the case in China.[2927] The Todas of\r\nthe Neilgherry Hills, on the other hand, amounted in the year 1867,\r\naccording to Mr. Breeks, to 455 males and 249 females of all ages,\r\nwhilst Mr. Marshall some few years ago found the Toda males of all\r\nages bear the proportion to females of all ages of 100 to 75.[2928]\r\nAmong the Mongols, as we are informed by Prejevalsky, “the women\r\nare far less numerous than the men;”[2929] and the same is said to\r\nhave been the case with the Massagetæ, and to be the case still in\r\nKamchatka.[2930]\r\n\r\nAs for the peoples of Africa, I have found two cases only of an excess\r\nof men, the one among the population of Galega, to the north-east of\r\nMadagascar, the other among the Quissama tribe in Angola.[2931] The\r\nreverse seems decidedly to be the rule. Thus, from Morocco Dr. Churcher\r\nwrites to me that “there appears to be a striking disproportion,\r\nthough there is no such thing as statistics in this land.” In Ma\r\nBung, in the Timannee country, Major Laing counted three women to one\r\nman.[2932] A census taken in Lagos in 1872 showed among the population\r\nof African origin, 27,774 men and 32,353 women.[2933] Among the Negroes\r\nof the Gold Coast, according to Bosman; in Latúka, according to Emin\r\nPasha; among the Waguha of West Tanganyika, according to Mr. A. J.\r\nSwann; among the Wa-taïta, according to Mr. Joseph Thomson, women\r\npredominate.[2934] Mr. Cousins is inclined to think that the same is\r\nthe case with the Cis-Natalian Kafirs, “as there are few bachelors,\r\nand the majority of men have more than one wife.”[2935] In Uganda, says\r\nthe Rev. C. T. Wilson, “the female population is largely in excess of\r\nthe male, the proportion being about three and a half to one.”[2936]\r\n\r\nIn European countries, the number of men and of women from fifteen to\r\ntwenty years of age is generally almost the same; but in an earlier\r\nperiod of life there are more men than women, and, in a later, more\r\nwomen than men.[2937]\r\n\r\nThis disparity in the numbers of the sexes is due to various causes.\r\nThe preponderance of women depends to a great extent upon the higher\r\nmortality of men. Dr. Sutherland found that the average age of 109\r\nEskimo was nearly 22 years—that of the females 24·5, that of the males\r\n19·3 years.[2938] The men pass most of their time at sea, in snow and\r\nrain, heat and cold, and many of them are drowned. The result of this\r\ntroublesome and dangerous life is that few of them attain the age of\r\nfifty, whereas many women reach the age of seventy or even eighty.\r\nThis, according to Dr. King, is the reason why, among this people,\r\nthere are generally fewer men than women.[2939] Mr. Bancroft states\r\nthat, among the Ingaliks near the mouth of the Yukon, some of the\r\nwomen reach sixty, while the men rarely attain more than forty-five\r\nyears.[2940] In Europe, the death-rate is higher among men than among\r\nwomen, partly because of the greater dangers they are exposed to. Among\r\nmany savage and barbarous peoples, however, the greater mortality of\r\nthe male population depends chiefly upon the destructive influence of\r\nwar.[2941] “As all nations of Indians in their natural condition,”\r\nsays Mr. Catlin, “are unceasingly at war with the tribes that are\r\nabout them, ... their warriors are killed off to that extent, that in\r\nmany instances two, or sometimes three women to a man are found in a\r\ntribe.”[2942] According to Ellis, it is supposed by the Missionaries\r\nin Madagascar that, in consequence of the destructive ravages of war,\r\nin some of the provinces there are among the free portion of the\r\ninhabitants five, and in other three, women to one man, whilst the\r\nproportion of the sexes seems to be equal at birth.[2943] But I am\r\ninclined to think that this cause operates principally at tolerably\r\nadvanced stages of civilization, and only in a smaller degree among\r\nthe rudest savages, who, devoid of any definite tribal organization,\r\nlive a wandering life, scattered in families or hordes consisting of\r\na few persons. Thus, with regard to the Yahgans of Tierra del Fuego,\r\nMr. Bridges writes to me, “On several occasions when some hundreds\r\nof natives have been gathered together, I have taken censuses of\r\nthem, and have always found the sexes equal or nearly so.... War was\r\nunknown, though fightings were frequent, but women took part in them as\r\nenergetically as the men, and suffered equally with them—if anything,\r\nmore.” Among the Australians also, as we have seen, wars do not cause\r\nany disproportion between the sexes.\r\n\r\nThe surplus of males is often due to female infanticide;[2944] and\r\namong certain peoples there is another cause which must be taken into\r\naccount. Captain Lewin states that, among the Toungtha, women die at a\r\ncomparatively early age because of the constant labour which their sex\r\nentails upon them, whereas the men live very long.[2945] And the same\r\nis said by Mr. Kirby with regard to the Kutchin.[2946]\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is a disproportion between the sexes at birth. Among\r\nsome peoples more boys are born, among others more girls; and the\r\nsurplus is often considerable. Mr. Ross thinks that, among the Eastern\r\nTinneh, “the proportion of births is rather in favour of females,”\r\nwhilst the Aht women seem to have more boys than girls.[2947] Von\r\nHumboldt found by examining baptismal registers, that more boys than\r\ngirls were born in some communities of New Spain.[2948] The same,\r\naccording to M. Belly, is the case among the Indians of Guatemala and\r\nNicaragua.[2949]\r\n\r\nIn the interior of Australia, Mr. Sturt met with several smaller tribes\r\nin which the number of girls was considerably greater than the number\r\nof boys, though in other tribes the proportion of births is in favour\r\nof males.[2950] Sir. G. Grey drew up a list of 222 births, and of these\r\n93 were females, 129 males.[2951] In Tasmania, where the men were more\r\nnumerous than the women, female infanticide was very rare.[2952] The\r\nsame is the case with the Sinhalese. They hold in abhorrence the crime\r\nof exposing children, says Dr. Davy; and it is never committed except\r\nin some of the wildest parts of the country, and even there only when\r\nthe parents themselves are on the brink of starvation, and must either\r\nsacrifice a part of the family or die.[2953] Haeckel assures us that\r\namong this people there is a permanent disproportion between male and\r\nfemale births, ten boys being born, on the average, to eight or nine\r\ngirls.[2954] Among the Todas, as we are informed by Mr. Marshall, the\r\nmale children under fourteen years of age bear to the female children\r\nof the same period—ages estimated from their personal appearance—the\r\nratio of 100 to 80·0,[2955] though female infanticide is never\r\npractised, having long since become extinct through the action of the\r\nBritish Government.[2956] Mr. Man’s inquiries tended to show that,\r\namong the Andamanese, there is a slight predominance of female over\r\nmale births.[2957]\r\n\r\nBruce observes, “From a diligent inquiry into the South and\r\nScripture-part of Mesopotamia, Armenia, and Syria, from Mousul (or\r\nNineveh) to Aleppo and Antioch, I find the proportion to be fully\r\ntwo women born to one man. There is indeed, a fraction over, but\r\nnot a considerable one. From Latikea, Laodicea ad mare, down the\r\ncoast of Syria to Sidon, the number is very nearly three, or two and\r\nthree-fourths to one man. Through the Holy Land, the country called\r\nHoran, in the Isthmus of Suez, and the parts of the Delta, unfrequented\r\nby strangers, it is something less than three. But from Suez to the\r\nStraits of Babelmandeb, which contains the three Arabias, the portion\r\nis fully four women to one man, which, I have reason to believe, holds\r\nas far as the Line, and 30° beyond it.” The manner in which Bruce\r\ncame to these conclusions he describes as follows:—“Whenever I went\r\ninto a town, village, or inhabited place, dwelt long in a mountain,\r\nor travelled journeys with any set of people, I always made it my\r\nbusiness to inquire how many children they had, or their fathers, their\r\nnext neighbours, or acquaintance. This not being a captious question,\r\nor what any one would scruple to answer, there was no interest to\r\ndeceive.... I say, therefore, that a medium of both sexes arising from\r\nthree or four hundred families indiscriminately taken, shall be the\r\nproportion in which one differs from the other.”[2958]\r\n\r\nThis statement has been contradicted, but, so far as I know, it has not\r\nbeen proved to be wholly without foundation. It is to some extent made\r\ncredible by what Dr. Churcher informs me regarding the disproportion\r\nof the sexes among the Moors of Morocco. As the result of his own\r\nobservation, and that of a Mohammedan friend of his, he writes, “There\r\nis certainly a disproportion also at birth.... It would be safe to say\r\nthat the female births are in the proportion of three females to one\r\nmale; this partly accounts for the great rejoicing when a son is born.\r\nIt reacts, however, in this way, that the people say, ‘Allah has given\r\nus more women than men, hence it is evident that polygamy is of God.’”\r\nIn the Monbuttu country, according to Emin Pasha, “far more female\r\nchildren are born than males.”[2959] And, regarding the disproportion\r\nbetween the sexes in Uganda, Mr. Wilson says, “Careful observation\r\nhas established the fact that there are a good many more female births\r\nthan male, and, on taking the groups of children playing by the\r\nroadside, there will always be found to be more girls than boys.”[2960]\r\nConfronted by these definite statements, and by the fact that, in many\r\nAfrican countries, there is a striking excess of women, we cannot with\r\nSüssmilch and Chervin[2961] dismiss as wholly groundless Montesquieu’s\r\nwell-known assertion that in the hot regions of the Old World more\r\ngirls are born than boys,[2962] although such disproportion certainly\r\ndoes not exist in every tropical country.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the average male births outnumber the female by about five\r\nper cent., the still-born being excluded. But the rate varies in the\r\ndifferent countries. Thus, in Russian Poland, only 101 boys are born\r\nto 100 girls, whilst, in Roumania and Greece, the proportion is 111 to\r\n100.[2963] The excess of male over female births is less when they are\r\nillegitimate than when legitimate.[2964]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEver since Aristotle’s days inquirers have sought to discover the\r\ncauses which determine the sex of the offspring; but no conclusion\r\ncommanding general assent has yet been arrived at. The law of Hofacker\r\nand Sadler, according to which more boys are born if the husband\r\nis older than the wife, more girls if the wife is older than the\r\nhusband, has attracted the greatest number of adherents.[2965] But\r\nNoirot and Breslau have lately come to the opposite result, and, from\r\nthe data of Norwegian statistics, Berner has shown that the law is\r\nuntenable.[2966] Dr. Goehlert has modified it so far that he holds the\r\nsex to be influenced, not by the relative, but by the absolute ages\r\nof the parents.[2967] But W. Stieda has found from the registers of\r\nbirths in Alsace-Lorraine, that neither the relative nor the absolute\r\nages of the parents exercise this sort of influence.[2968] Again,\r\nPlatter, in a paper in ‘Statistische Monatsschrift’ (Vienna) for 1875,\r\nconcludes from the examination of thirty million births that the less\r\nthe difference in the age of the parents the greater is the probability\r\nof boys being born.[2969]\r\n\r\nIt has, further, been suggested that polygyny leads to the birth\r\nof a greater proportion of female infants.[2970] Dr. J. Campbell,\r\nhowever, who carefully attended to this subject in the harems of Siam,\r\nconcludes that the proportion of male to female births is the same\r\nas from monogamous unions.[2971] It has also been maintained, in a\r\npaper read before the “Anthropological Institute of Great Britain\r\nand Ireland” by Mr. John Sanderson, that, among the Kafirs resident\r\nin Natal and the adjoining countries, there was no surplus of female\r\nbirths in polygynous families.[2972] The mass of facts collected by\r\nMr. Sanderson is, however, too small to warrant any positive general\r\ndeductions, and the like must be said of the information on the subject\r\nwhich Mr. Cousins and Mr. Eyles have sent me from the same part of\r\nSouth Africa. According to M. Remy and Mr. Hyde, on the other hand, the\r\ncensuses of the Mormons show a great excess of female births.[2973]\r\nBut it is impossible to believe that polygynous intercourse _per se_\r\ncan cause such an excess. Hardly any animal, as Mr. Darwin remarks,\r\nhas been rendered so highly polygynous as English race-horses;\r\nnevertheless, their male and female offspring are almost exactly equal\r\nin number.[2974]\r\n\r\nOf all the theories relating to this subject, the one set forth by\r\nDr. Düsing[2975] is by far the most important. According to him, the\r\ncharacters of animals and plants which influence the formation of\r\nsex are due to natural selection. In every species, the proportion\r\nbetween the sexes has a tendency to keep constant, but the organisms\r\nare so well adapted to the conditions of life that, under anomalous\r\ncircumstances, they produce more individuals of that sex of which\r\nthere is the greatest need. When nourishment is abundant, strengthened\r\nreproduction is an advantage to the species, whereas the reverse is\r\nthe case when nourishment is scarce. Hence—the power of multiplication\r\ndepending chiefly upon the number of females—organisms, when unusually\r\nwell nourished, produce comparatively more female offspring; in the\r\nopposite case, more male. Dr. Düsing and, before him, Dr. Ploss,[2976]\r\nhave adduced several remarkable facts which seem to indicate that such\r\na connection between abundance and the production of females, and\r\nbetween scarcity and the production of males, actually exists. It is,\r\nfor example, a common opinion among furriers that rich regions give\r\nmore female furs, poor regions more male.[2977] It is an established\r\nfact that male births are in greater excess in country districts,\r\nthe population of which is often badly fed, than in towns, where the\r\nconditions of life are shown to be, as a rule, more luxurious.[2978] A\r\nsimilar excess is found among poor people as compared with the well-off\r\nclasses.[2979] Especially remarkable is Dr. Ploss’s statement that in\r\nhighlands comparatively more boys are born than in lowlands. He found\r\nthat, in Saxony, in the years 1847-1849, the proportion between male\r\nand female births was 105·9 to 100 in the region not exceeding 500\r\nParis feet above the level of the sea; 107·3 to 100, at a height of\r\nbetween 1,001 and 1,500 feet; and 107·8 to 100, at a height of between\r\n1,501 and 2,000.[2980]\r\n\r\nThe evidence adduced by Dr. Ploss and Dr. Düsing is certainly not\r\nstrong enough to permit us to regard their inference otherwise than as\r\nan hypothesis. But it is an hypothesis in which there seems to be some\r\ntruth. There are ethnological facts which fully harmonize with it.\r\n\r\nAccording to the census made by the collectors of districts in 1814,\r\nthe whole population of the old English possessions in Ceylon formed\r\na grand total of 475,883 souls, the males outnumbering the females\r\nby 27,193. Above the age of puberty there were 156,447 males, and\r\n142,453 females; below that age, 95,091 males, and 81,892 females.\r\nDavy, who thinks that the census is not far from the truth, remarks,\r\n“The disproportion appears to be greatest in the poorest parts of the\r\ncountry, where the population is thinnest, and it is most difficult\r\nto support life; and smallest where there is least want. Indeed, in\r\nsome of the fishing villages, where there is abundance of food, the\r\nnumber of females rather exceeds that of the males. May it not be a\r\nwise provision of provident Nature to promote, by extreme poverty, the\r\ngeneration of males rather than of females?”[2981]\r\n\r\nVery remarkable is the striking coincidence of polyandry with the\r\ngreat poverty of the countries in which it prevails. It seems to be\r\nbeyond doubt that this practice, as a rule, is due to scarcity of\r\nwomen. This is the view taken by most of the authorities to whom we\r\nowe our knowledge of polyandrous peoples.[2982] And this disproportion\r\nbetween the sexes cannot, at least in many instances, be explained\r\nas a result of female infanticide. It was formerly said that the\r\nexcess of men among the Todas was owing to the fact that all the\r\ngirls beyond a certain number were destroyed in the cradle; but later\r\ninvestigations, as we have seen, show that the excess depends upon a\r\nstriking disproportion between male and female births. Dr. Seemann\r\nstates that, among those Eskimo tribes who practise polyandry, and\r\namong whom men are more numerous than women, female infanticide seems\r\nto be unknown.[2983] With regard to the inhabitants of the Jounsar\r\ndistrict of the Himalayas, Mr. Dunlop says, “Wherever the practice of\r\npolyandry exists, there is a striking discrepance in the proportions of\r\nthe sexes among young children as well as adults; thus, in a village\r\nwhere I have found upwards of four hundred boys, there were only one\r\nhundred and twenty girls, yet the temptations to female infanticide,\r\nowing to expensive marriages and extravagant dowers which exist among\r\nthe Rajputs of the plains, are not found in the hills where the\r\nmarriages are comparatively inexpensive, and where the wife, instead\r\nof bringing a large dowry, is usually purchased for a considerable\r\nsum from her parents. In the Garhwal Hills, moreover, where polygamy\r\nis prevalent, there is a surplus of female children.... I am inclined\r\nto give more weight to Nature’s adaptability to national habit, than\r\nto the possibility of infanticide being the cause of the discrepance\r\nfound in Jounsar.”[2984] Female infants are killed only where they\r\nare a burden to the family or community to which they belong. But it\r\nwill be shown subsequently that this is by no means the case with the\r\ninhabitants of the Himalayas. Hence it seems almost probable that,\r\namong the polyandrous peoples of these regions, as among the Todas and\r\nSinhalese, more boys are born than girls.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Tibetan polyandry depends upon the scarcity of\r\nwomen in a marriageable state, and that this scarcity is due to the\r\nLama nunneries absorbing so many of the girls.[2985] But Koeppen clears\r\nthe religion of Tibet of any responsibility for polyandry, showing\r\nthat the practice existed in the country before the introduction\r\nof Buddhism.[2986] Mr. Baber states the very remarkable fact that\r\n“polygamy obtains in valleys, while polyandry prevails in the\r\nuplands.”[2987] According to Mr. Rockhill, “female infanticide is not\r\npractised in Tibet, except among the women married to Chinese;”[2988]\r\nand Grosier and Du Halde expressly assert that more males than females\r\nare born there.[2989]\r\n\r\nMuch stress must be laid on the fact that polyandry prevails chiefly\r\nin poor countries. “Polyandry,” says Lieutenant Cunningham, “appears\r\nto be essential in a country in which the quantity of cultivable land\r\nis limited, and in which pastures are not extensive, in which there\r\nare but few facilities for carrying on commerce, and in which there\r\nis no mineral wealth readily made available.”[2990] “Il est connu,”\r\nsays M. Vinson, “que sur la côte de Malabar la polyandrie a été\r\nétablie pour obvier à la pénurie des subsistances.”[2991] The Santals\r\nlive in a country a great part of which is poor and sterile.[2992]\r\nRegarding the Kunawari, Miss Gordon Cumming remarks, “There is a\r\ncurious distinction in the social customs of the people in the upper\r\nand lower part of this valley. Below Wangtu it is said that polygamy\r\nprevails, as elsewhere; every man buying his wives from their parents\r\nfor a given number of rupees.... Farther up the valley, however, where\r\nthe people are very poor, and the tiny ridges of cultivation will not\r\nsupport large families, polyandry is common.”[2993] Speaking of the\r\nBotis of Ladakh, Sir A. Cunningham asserts that polyandry “was a most\r\npolitic measure for a poor country which does not produce sufficient\r\nfood for its inhabitants.”[2994] Mr. Bellew holds the same view with\r\nregard to polyandry in Lammayru in Ladakh:—“The population is kept\r\ndown to a proportion which the country is capable of supporting. For\r\nthe only parts of it which are habitable are the narrow valleys through\r\nwhich its rivers flow, and the little nooks in the mountains which\r\nare watered by their torrent tributaries.”[2995] According to Mr.\r\nWilson, even one of the Moravian missionaries defended the polyandry\r\nof the Tibetans “as good for the heathen of so sterile a country,”\r\nsince superabundant population in an unfertile country, would be a\r\ngreat calamity and produce “eternal warfare or eternal want.”[2996]\r\nA similar opinion is pronounced by Koeppen, Turner, de Ujfalvy, and\r\nWilson.[2997]\r\n\r\nIt is commonly asserted that this coincidence of polyandry with poverty\r\nof material resources depends upon the intention of the people to check\r\nan increase of population, or upon the fact that the men are not rich\r\nenough to support or buy wives for themselves. But the accuracy of\r\nthese assumptions is very doubtful. Among no polyandrous people, except\r\nthe Tibetans with their nunneries do we know of a class of unmarried\r\nwomen. Moreover, even if a woman is sometimes a burden to her husband\r\nin a tribe that lives by hunting, her position is very different among\r\na pastoral or agricultural people. In the Himalayas, as Mr. Fraser\r\nremarks, women are useful in the fields and in domestic labours, and\r\nfully earn their own subsistence.[2998] Again, Turner, who had many\r\nopportunities of seeing Western Tibet, asserts that polyandry there is\r\nnot confined to the lower ranks alone, but is frequently found in the\r\nmost opulent families,—a statement with which Mr. Wilson agrees.[2999]\r\nIn Ceylon, as we have seen, it prevails chiefly among the wealthier\r\nclasses.[3000] And in the villages of the Kotegarh district in the\r\nHimalayas, according to Dr. Stulpnagel, most of the cases of polyandry\r\nare found among well-to-do peoples. “It is the poor,” he says, “who\r\nprefer polygamy, on account of the value of the women as household\r\ndrudges.”[3001] All these facts are certainly in favour of Dr. Düsing’s\r\ntheory; and Dr. Floss’s statement as to the excess of male births in\r\nthe highlands of Saxony becomes very important when we consider that\r\npolyandry chiefly occurs among mountaineers—in South Africa, as we have\r\nseen, as well as in Asia.\r\n\r\nDr. Düsing has, moreover, inferred that incest is less common in\r\nproportion as the number of males is great. The more males, he says,\r\nthe farther off they have to go from their birthplace to find mates.\r\nIncest is injurious to the species; hence incestuous unions have a\r\ntendency to produce an excess of male offspring.[3002] Thus, according\r\nto Dr. Nagel, certain plants, when self-fertilized, produce an excess\r\nof male flowers. According to Dr. Goehlert’s statistical investigation,\r\nin the case of horses, the more the parent animals differ in colour,\r\nthe more the female foals outnumber the male.[3003] Among the Jews,\r\nmany of whom marry cousins, there is a remarkable excess of male\r\nbirths. In country districts where, as we have seen, comparatively\r\nmore boys are born than in towns, marriage more frequently takes place\r\nbetween kinsfolk. It is for a similar reason, says Dr. Düsing, that\r\nillegitimate unions show a tendency to produce female births.[3004]\r\n\r\nThe evidence given by Dr. Düsing for the correctness of his deduction\r\nis, then, exceedingly scanty—if, indeed, it can be called evidence.\r\nNevertheless, I think his main conclusion holds good. Independently\r\nof his reasoning, I had come to exactly the same result in a purely\r\ninductive way. There is some ground for believing that mixture of\r\nrace produces an excess of female births. In his work on the ‘Tribes\r\nof California,’ Mr. Powers observes, “It is a curious fact, which\r\nhas frequently come under my observation, and has been abundantly\r\nconfirmed by the pioneers, that among half-breed children a decided\r\nmajority are girls.... Often I have seen whole families of half-breed\r\ngirls, but never one composed entirely of boys, and seldom one wherein\r\nthey were more numerous.”[3005] When I mentioned this statement to a\r\ngentleman who had spent many years in British Columbia and other parts\r\nof North America, he replied that he himself had made exactly the same\r\nobservation. Mr. Starkweather has found that, according to the United\r\nStates statistical tables of the sex of mulattoes born in the Southern\r\nStates, there is an excess of from 12 to 15 per cent. of female mulatto\r\nchildren, whilst, taking the whole population together, the male births\r\nshow an excess of 5 per cent.[3006] In Central America, according to\r\nColonel Galindo, “an extraordinary excess is observable in the births\r\nof white and Ladino females over those of the males, the former being\r\nin proportion to the latter as six, or at least as five, to four: among\r\nthe Indians the births of males and females are about equal.”[3007] Mr.\r\nStephens asserts that, among the Ladinos of Yucatan, the proportion is\r\neven as two to one.[3008] Taken in connection with the fact mentioned\r\nby Mr. Squier, that the whites in Central America are as one to eight\r\nin comparison with the mixed population,[3009] these statements\r\naccord well with the following observation of M. Belly as regards\r\nNicaragua:—“Ce qui me paraît être le fait général,” he says, “c’est\r\nque dans les villes où l’élément blanc domine, il se procrée en effet\r\nplus de filles que de garçons.... Mais dans les campagnes et partout\r\noù la race Indienne l’emporte, c’est le contraire qui se produit,\r\net dès lors la prépondérance du sexe masculin se maintient par la\r\nprépondérance de l’élément indigène. Le même phénomène avait déjà été\r\nobservé au Mexique.”[3010]\r\n\r\nConcerning the proportion of the sexes at birth among the mixed races\r\nof South America, I have unfortunately no definite statements at my\r\ndisposal. But Mr. J. S. Roberton informs me, from Chañaral in Chili,\r\nthat in that country, with its numerous mongrels, more females are born\r\nthan males. According to the list of the population of the capitaina\r\nof São Paulo, in the year 1815, given by v. Spix and v. Martius—a list\r\nwhich includes more than 200,000 persons,—the proportion between women\r\nand men is, among the mulattoes, 114·65 to 100; among the whites,\r\n109·3 to 100; among the blacks, 100 to 129.[3011] But this last\r\nproportion is of no consequence, as we have no account of the number\r\nof negro slaves annually imported into the capitaina. Sir R. F. Burton\r\nfound, from the census returns of 1859 for the town of São João d’El\r\nRei, where there is a large intermixture of the white race with the\r\ncoloured women, an excess of nearly 50 per cent. of women as compared\r\nwith men.[3012] A census of the population in the Province of Rio,\r\ntaken in the year 1844, also shows a considerable excess of women, not\r\nonly, however, among the mixed population, but among the Indian and\r\nnegro creoles as well;[3013] and M. de Castelnau was astonished at the\r\ndisproportionately large number of females in Goyaz.[3014]\r\n\r\nIn the northern parts of the United States, according to Kohl, female\r\nchildren predominate in the families of the cross-breeds arising from\r\nthe intercourse of Frenchmen with Indian women.[3015] This statement\r\nis very much like Graf v. Görtz’s, that the families of the offspring\r\nof Dutchmen and Malay women in Java (Lipplapps) consist chiefly of\r\ndaughters.[3016] A census taken in the eighteenth century, given by\r\nSüssmilch, proves also that among these mongrels there is a great\r\nexcess of women over men.[3017] From Stanley Pool in Congo, Dr. Sims\r\nwrites to me, “It is the subject of general remark here, that the\r\nhalf-caste children are generally girls; out of ten I can count, two\r\nonly are boys.” At the same time he states that, among the native\r\nBateke people, no disproportion between the sexes is observable. Mr.\r\nCousins informs me that, in the western province of Cis-Natalian\r\nKafirland, in the “Karoo” district from Caledon up to Mossel Bay,\r\nthere is a half-caste or mixed race called “Bruin Menschen,” generally\r\nknown as bastards, among whom more females than males are born. Dr.\r\nFelkin found that, among the foreign women imported to Uganda, the\r\nexcess of females in the first births was enormous, _viz._, 510 females\r\nto 100 males, as compared with 102 females to 100 males in first births\r\nfrom pure Waganda women; whilst in subsequent pregnancies of these\r\nimported women the ratio was 137 females to 100 males. As a matter of\r\nfact, in the families of the poorer classes of Uganda, who “do all\r\nin their power to marry pure Waganda women,” the sexes are as evenly\r\nbalanced as in Europe, whereas this is certainly not the case among\r\nthe children of chiefs and wealthy men who have large harems supplied\r\nmainly with foreign wives. “I found,” says Dr. Felkin, “that of the\r\nwomen captured by the slave-raiders in Central Africa, and brought down\r\nto the East Coast, either near Zanzibar or through the Soudan to the\r\nRed Sea, those who had been impregnated on the way usually produced\r\nfemale children. Hence the Soudan slave-dealers, instead of having only\r\none slave to sell, have a woman and a female child.”[3018] Dr. Felkin\r\nsuggests, as an explanation of this excess of female births, that the\r\ntemporarily superior parent produces the opposite sex; but the facts\r\nstated seem strongly to corroborate the theory that intermixture of\r\nrace is in favour of female births. Very remarkable are two statements\r\nin the Talmud, that mixed marriages produce only girls.[3019] Mr.\r\nJacobs informs me that his collection of Jewish statistics includes\r\ndetails of 118 mixed marriages; of these 28 are sterile, and in the\r\nremainder there are 145 female children and 122 male—that is, 118·82 to\r\n100 males.\r\n\r\nWe must not, of course, take for granted that what applies to certain\r\nraces of men holds good for all of them; but it should be observed that\r\nthe cases mentioned refer to mongrels of very different kinds. It is\r\nindeed scarcely probable that anything else than the crossing can be\r\nthe cause of this excess of females, as facts tend to show that unions\r\nbetween related individuals or, generally, between individuals who are\r\nvery like each other, produce a comparatively great number of male\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\nIn all the in-and-in bred stocks of the Bates herd at Kirklevington,\r\naccording to Mr. Bell, the number of bull calves was constantly very\r\nfar in excess of the heifers.[3020] Of the in-and-in bred Warlaby\r\nbranch of short-horns, Mr. Carr says that it “appears to have a most\r\ndestructive propensity to breed bulls.”[3021] Dr. Goehlert’s statement\r\nas regards horses, just referred to, is corroborated by Crampe’s\r\ninvestigations, which included more than two thousand different cases,\r\nall tending to prove that female foals predominate in proportion as the\r\nparent animals differ in colour.[3022]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the Todas of the Neilgherry Hills are probably the\r\nmost in-and-in bred people of whom anything is known, and we have\r\nalso seen how, among them, the disproportion between male and female\r\nbirths is strikingly in favour of the males. Among the Badagas, a\r\nneighbouring people, who, like the Todas, have numerous subdivisions\r\nof caste, each of which differs in some social or ceremonial\r\ncustom,[3023] and all of which, probably, are endogamous, there is also\r\na considerable surplus of men.[3024] Now it is very remarkable that\r\nin another tribe inhabiting the same hill ranges, the Kotars, who do\r\nnot intermarry with the inhabitants of their own village, but always\r\nseek a wife from another “kotagiri,” women are not so scarce as among\r\nthe Todas and the Badagas.[3025] Among the endogamous Maoris, the\r\nmen outnumber the women. So also among the Sinhalese, who consider\r\nmarriage between the father’s sister’s son and the mother’s brother’s\r\ndaughter the most proper union. Among the polyandrous Arabs mentioned\r\nby Strabo, marriage between cousins was the rule. The polyandrous\r\nmountaineer of South Africa, in almost every case, marries a daughter\r\nof his father’s brother.[3026] And with the Jews, among whom cousin\r\nmarriages occur perhaps three times as often as among the surrounding\r\npopulations,[3027] the proportion of births is probably more in favour\r\nof the males than among the non-Jewish population of Europe.[3028]\r\nAll these facts, taken together, seem to render it probable that\r\nthe degree of differentiation in the sexual elements of the parents\r\nexercises some influence upon the sex of the offspring, so that, when\r\nthe differentiation is unusually great, the births are in favour of\r\nfemales; when it is unusually small, in favour of males.\r\n\r\nWe certainly cannot, from the numerical proportion of the sexes,\r\nespecially at birth, draw any inference as to the form of marriage\r\ncharacteristic of the species. Among birds living in a state of nature,\r\npolyandry is almost unheard of, though, according to Dr. Brehm, the\r\nmales are generally more numerous than the females.[3029] As for\r\nman, there are several non-polyandrous peoples among whom the men\r\nare considerably in excess of the women; whilst among other peoples\r\npolygyny is forbidden, though the women are in excess of the men.\r\nNevertheless, the form of marriage depends to a great extent upon\r\nthe proportion between the male and female population. Polyandry, as\r\nalready said, is due chiefly to a surplus of men, though it prevails\r\nonly where the circumstances are otherwise in favour of it. And, as\r\nregards polygyny, I cannot agree with M. Chervin that it is quite\r\nindependent of the proportion between the sexes.[3030] It has been\r\nobserved that, in India, polyandry occurs in those parts of the country\r\nwhere the males outnumber the females, polygyny in those where the\r\nreverse is the case.[3031] Indeed, in countries unaffected by European\r\ncivilization, polygyny seems to prevail wherever women form the\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nThus the causes which determine the proportion of the sexes exercise\r\nsome influence also upon the form of marriage. Among the Eskimo, for\r\ninstance, who, according to Armstrong, take more than one wife when\r\nthe women are sufficiently numerous,[3032] polygyny results chiefly\r\nfrom the dangerous life the men have to lead in order to gain their\r\nsubsistence. Among the Indians of North America, it is, to a large\r\nextent, due to the wars which destroy many of the male population. In\r\ncertain countries it seems to be furthered by physiological conditions\r\nleading to an excess of female births. As for polyandry, we have some\r\nreason to believe that it is due, on the one hand, to poor conditions\r\nof life, on the other to close intermarrying. As a matter of fact, the\r\nchief polyandrous peoples either live in sterile mountain regions, or\r\nare endogamous in a very high degree.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons why a man may desire to possess more than\r\none wife. First, monogamy requires from him periodical continence. He\r\nhas to live apart from his wife, not only for a certain time every\r\nmonth,[3033] but, among many peoples, during her pregnancy also.[3034]\r\nAmong the Shawanese, for instance, “as soon as a wife is announced to\r\nbe in a state of pregnancy, the matrimonial rights are suspended, and\r\ncontinency preserved with a religious and mystical scrupulosity.”[3035]\r\nThis suspension of matrimonial rights is usually continued till a\r\nconsiderable time after child-birth. Among the Northern Indians, a\r\nmother has to remain in a small tent placed at a little distance from\r\nthe others during a month or five weeks;[3036] and similar customs\r\nare found among many other peoples.[3037] Very commonly, in a state\r\nof savage and barbarous life, the husband must not cohabit with his\r\nwife till the child is weaned.[3038] And this prohibition is all the\r\nmore severe, as the suckling-time generally lasts for two, three,\r\nfour years, or even more. In Sierra Leone, it was looked upon as a\r\ncrime of the most heinous nature if a wife cohabited with her husband\r\nbefore the child was able to run alone.[3039] Among the Makonde, in\r\nEastern Africa, says Mr. Joseph Thomson, “when a woman bears a child,\r\nshe lives completely apart from her husband till the child is able to\r\nspeak, as otherwise it is believed that harm, if not death, would come\r\nto the infant.”[3040] In Fiji, “the relatives of a woman take it as a\r\npublic insult if any child should be born before the customary three or\r\nfour years have elapsed.”[3041] This long suckling-time is due chiefly\r\nto want of soft food and animal milk.[3042] But when milk can be\r\nobtained,[3043] and even when the people have domesticated animals able\r\nto supply them with it,[3044] this kind of food is often avoided. The\r\nChinese, who are a Tartar people, and must have descended at one time\r\nfrom the “Land of Grass,” entirely eschew the use of milk.[3045]\r\n\r\nProfessor Bastian suggests that it is on hygienic grounds, though\r\nalmost instinctively, that a man abstains from cohabitation with his\r\nwife during her pregnancy, and as long as she suckles her child.[3046]\r\nBut the reason seems rather to be of a religious character. Diseases\r\nare generally attributed by savages to the influence of some evil\r\nspirit.[3047] Among many peoples the attainment of the age of puberty\r\nis marked by most superstitious ceremonies.[3048] A woman, during the\r\ntime of menstruation, is looked upon with a mystic detestation.[3049]\r\nIt is therefore quite in accordance with primitive ideas that the\r\nappearance of a new being should be connected in some way with\r\nsupernatural agencies. Among the Ashantees, according to Mr. Reade,\r\n“when conception becomes apparent, the girl goes through a ceremony\r\nof abuse, and is pelted down to the sea, where she is cleansed. She is\r\nthen set aside; charms are bound on her wrists, spells are muttered\r\nover her, and, by a wise sanitary regulation, her husband is not\r\nallowed to cohabit with her from that time until she has finished\r\nnursing her child.”[3050] A woman in child-bed is very commonly\r\nconsidered unclean.[3051] In China, a man of the upper classes does not\r\nspeak to his wife within the first month after the birth of a child,\r\nand no visitor will enter the house where she lives.[3052] According to\r\nearly Aryan traditions, as v. Żmigrodzki remarks, a witch and a woman\r\nin child-bed are persons so intimately connected, that it is impossible\r\nto make any distinction between them.[3053]\r\n\r\nOne of the chief causes of polygyny is the attraction which female\r\nyouth and beauty exercise upon man. Several instances have already\r\nbeen mentioned of a fresh wife being taken when the first wife grows\r\nold. Indeed, when a man, soon after he has attained manhood, marries\r\na woman of similar age—not to speak of such countries as China and\r\nCorea, where the first wife is generally a woman from three to eight\r\nyears older than her husband[3054]—he will still be a man in the prime\r\nof life, when the youthful beauty of his wife has passed away for\r\never. This is especially the case among peoples at the lower stages of\r\ncivilization, among whom, as a rule, women get old much sooner than in\r\nmore advanced communities.\r\n\r\nThus in California, according to Mr. Powers, women are rather handsome\r\nin their free and untoiling youth, but after twenty-five or thirty they\r\nbreak down under their heavy burdens and become ugly.[3055] Among the\r\nMandans, the beauty of the women vanishes soon after marriage.[3056]\r\nThe Kutchin women get “coarse and ugly as they grow old, owing to\r\nhard labour and bad treatment.”[3057] Patagonian women are said to\r\nlose their youth at a very early age, “from exposure and hard work;”\r\nand among the Warraus, according to Schomburgk, “when the woman has\r\nreached her twentieth year, the flower of her life is gone.”[3058]\r\nIn New Zealand, Tahiti, Hawaii, and other islands of the South Sea,\r\nthe beauty of women soon decays—“the result,” says Mr. Angas, “of\r\nhard labour in some cases, and in others of early intercourse with\r\nthe opposite sex, combined with their mode of living, which rapidly\r\ndestroys their youthful appearance.”[3059]\r\n\r\n“Women of fifty in Europe,” Stavorinus observes, “look younger and\r\nfresher than those of thirty in Batavia.”[3060] At two and twenty,\r\nDyak beauty “has already begun to fade, and the subsequent decay is\r\nrapid.”[3061] Among the Manipuris and Garos, the women, pretty when\r\nyoung, soon become “hags”;[3062] and this is true also of the Aino\r\nwomen in Yesso, partly, it is said, because of the exposed life they\r\nlead as children, partly because of the early age at which they marry\r\nand become mothers, and partly because of the hard life they continue\r\nto lead afterwards.[3063]\r\n\r\nIn Africa female beauty fades quickly. The Egyptian women, from the age\r\nof about fourteen to that of eighteen or twenty, are generally models\r\nof loveliness in body and limbs, but, when they reach maturity, their\r\nattractions do not long survive.[3064] In Eastern Africa, according\r\nto Sir R. F. Burton, the beauty of women is less perishable than in\r\nIndia and Arabia; but even there charms are on the wane at thirty, and,\r\nwhen old age comes on, the women are no exceptions to “the hideous\r\ndecrepitude of the East.”[3065] Arab girls in the Sahara preserve\r\nonly till about their sixteenth year that youthful freshness which\r\nthe women of the north still possess in the late spring of their\r\nlife;[3066] and, among the Ba-kwileh, women have no trace of beauty\r\nafter twenty-five.[3067] Speaking of the Wolofs, Mr. Reade remarks that\r\nthe girls are very pretty with their soft and glossy black skin, but,\r\n“when the first jet of youth is passed, the skin turns to a dirty\r\nyellow and creases like old leather; their eyes sink into the skull,\r\nand the breasts hang down like the udder of a cow, or shrivel up like a\r\nbladder that has burst.”[3068] Among the Damaras, Ovambo, and Kafirs,\r\nwomen, soon after maturity, begin to wither, as we are told, on account\r\nof hard labour;[3069] and the Bushman women, it is said, soon become\r\nsterile from the same cause.[3070] Among the Fulah, it is rare for a\r\nwoman older than twenty to become a mother; and in Unyoro Emin Pasha\r\nnever saw a woman above twenty-five with babies.[3071]\r\n\r\nEarly intercourse with the opposite sex is adduced by several writers\r\nas the cause of the short prime of savage women. But I am disposed to\r\nthink that physical exertion has a much greater influence. Even from a\r\nphysiological point of view hard labour seems to shorten female youth.\r\nStatistics show that, among the poorer women of Berlin, menstruation\r\nceases at a rather earlier age than among the well-off classes.[3072]\r\nIt has been suggested that in hot countries women lose their beauty\r\nmuch sooner than in colder regions,[3073] whereas men are not affected\r\nin the same way by climate. But, so far as I know, we are still in want\r\nof exact information on this point.\r\n\r\nA further cause of polygyny is man’s taste for variety. Merolla da\r\nSorrento asserts that the Negroes of Angola, who used to exchange their\r\nwives with each other for a certain time, excused themselves, when\r\nreproved, on the ground that “they were not able to eat always of the\r\nsame dish.”[3074] And in Egypt, according to Mr. Lane, “fickle passion\r\nis the most evident and common motive both to polygamy and repeated\r\ndivorces.”[3075]\r\n\r\nMotives due to man’s passions are not, however, the only causes of\r\npolygyny. We must also take into account his desire for offspring,\r\nwealth, and authority.\r\n\r\nThe barrenness of a wife is a very common reason for the choice of\r\nanother partner. Among the Greenlanders, for instance, who considered\r\nit a great disgrace for a man to have no children, particularly no\r\nsons, a husband generally took a second wife, if the first one could\r\nnot satisfy his desire for offspring.[3076] Among the Botis of Ladakh,\r\nsays Lieutenant Cunningham, “should a wife prove barren, a second can\r\nbe chosen, or should she have daughters only, a second can be chosen\r\nsimilarly.”[3077] In the Mutsa tribe of Indo-China, polygyny is allowed\r\nonly if the wife is sterile;[3078] and, among the Patuah or Juanga,\r\nthe Eskimo at Prince Regent’s Bay, and several other peoples, already\r\nreferred to, a man scarcely ever takes a second wife if the first wife\r\ngives him children.[3079] Among the Tuski, “if a man’s wife bears only\r\ngirls, he takes another until he obtains a boy, but no more.”[3080]\r\nIn China and Tonquin, and among the Munda Kols of Chota Nagpore, it\r\nsometimes happens that the barren wife herself advises her husband to\r\ntake a fresh partner,[3081] as Rachel gave Jacob Bilhah.[3082]\r\n\r\nThe polygyny of the ancient Hindus seems to have been due chiefly to\r\nthe fact that men dreaded the idea of dying childless, and M. Le Play\r\nobserves that even now in the East the desire for offspring is one of\r\nthe principal causes of polygyny.[3083] Dr. Gray makes the same remark\r\nas to the Chinese,[3084] Herr Andree as to the Jews.[3085] In Egypt,\r\nsays Mr. Lane, “a man having a wife who has the misfortune to be\r\nbarren, and being too much attached to her to divorce her, is sometimes\r\ninduced to take a second wife, merely in the hope of obtaining\r\noffspring.”[3086]\r\n\r\nThe more wives, the more children; and the more children, the\r\ngreater power. Man in a savage and barbarous state is proud of a\r\nlarge progeny, and he who has most kinsfolk is most honoured and\r\nfeared.[3087] Regarding certain Indians of North America, among whom\r\nthe dignity of chief was elective, Heriot remarks that “the choice\r\nusually fell upon him who had the most numerous offspring, and who\r\nwas therefore considered as the person most deeply interested in the\r\nwelfare of the tribe.”[3088] Among the Chippewas, says Mr. Keating,\r\n“the pride and honour of parents depend upon the extent of their\r\nfamily.”[3089] Speaking of African polygyny, Sir R. F. Burton observes\r\nthat the “culture of the marriage tie is necessary among savages and\r\nbarbarians, where, unlike Europe, a man’s relations and connections are\r\nhis only friends; besides which, a multitude of wives ministers to his\r\npride and influence, state and pleasure.”[3090] Bosman tells us of a\r\nviceroy tributary to the negro king of Fida, who, assisted only by his\r\nsons and grandsons with their slaves, repulsed a powerful enemy who\r\ncame against him. This viceroy, with his sons and grandsons, could make\r\nout the number of two thousand descendants, not reckoning daughters or\r\nany that were dead.[3091] Moreover, in a state of nature, next to a\r\nman’s wives, the real servant, the only one to be counted upon, is the\r\nchild.[3092]\r\n\r\nA husband’s desire for children often leads to polygyny in countries\r\nwhere the fecundity of women is at a low rate. More than a hundred\r\nyears ago, Dr. Hewit observed that women are naturally less prolific\r\namong rude than among polished nations.[3093] This assertion, though\r\nnot true universally,[3094] is probably true in the main. “It\r\nis a very rare occurrence for an Indian woman,” says Mr. Catlin,\r\n“to be ‘blessed’ with more than four or five children during her\r\nlife; and, generally speaking, they seem contented with two or\r\nthree.”[3095] This statement is confirmed by the evidence of several\r\nother authorities;[3096] and it holds good not only for the North\r\nAmerican Indians, but, upon the whole, for a great many uncivilized\r\npeoples.[3097] Some writers ascribe this slight degree of prolificness\r\nto hard labour,[3098] or to unfavourable conditions of life in\r\ngeneral.[3099] That it is partly due to the long period of suckling is\r\nhighly probable, not only because a woman less easily becomes pregnant\r\nduring the time of lactation, but also on account of the continence\r\nin which she often has to live during that period. The mortality of\r\nchildren is very great among savages,[3100] and this, co-operating with\r\nother causes to keep the family small, makes polygyny seem to many\r\npeoples absolutely necessary. Speaking of the Equatorial Africans, Mr.\r\nReade says, “Propagation is a perfect struggle; polygamy becomes a law\r\nof nature; and even with the aid of this institution, so favourable to\r\nreproduction, there are fewer children than wives.”[3101]\r\n\r\nA man’s fortune is increased by a multitude of wives not only through\r\ntheir children, but through their labour. An Eastern Central African,\r\nsays Mr. Macdonald, finds no difficulty in supporting even hundreds of\r\nwives. “The more wives he has, the richer he is. It is his wives that\r\nmaintain him. They do all his ploughing, milling, cooking, &c. They\r\nmay be viewed as superior servants who combine all the capacities of\r\nmale servants and female servants in Britain—who do all his work and\r\nask no wages.”[3102] Manual labour among savages is undertaken chiefly\r\nby women; and, as there are no day-labourers or persons who will work\r\nfor hire, it becomes necessary for any one who requires many servants\r\nto have many wives. Mr. Wood remarks that, when an Indian can purchase\r\nfour or five wives, their labour in the field is worth even more to\r\nthe household than his exertions in hunting.[3103] “The object of\r\nthe Kutchin,” says Mr. Kirby, “is to have a greater number of poor\r\ncreatures whom he can use as beasts of burden for hauling his wood,\r\ncarrying his meat, and performing the drudgery of his camp.”[3104] A\r\nModok defends his having several wives on the plea that he requires\r\none to keep house, another to hunt, another to dig roots.[3105] In the\r\nSolomon Islands in New Guinea, at the Gold Coast, and in other places\r\nwhere the women cultivate the ground, a plurality of wives implies a\r\nrich supply of food;[3106] whilst, among the Tartars, according to\r\nMarco Polo, wives were of use to their husbands as traders.[3107]\r\n\r\nA multitude of wives increases a man’s authority, not only because it\r\nincreases his fortune and the number of his children, or because it\r\nmakes him able to be liberal and keep open doors for foreigners and\r\nguests,[3108] but also because it presupposes a certain superiority\r\nin personal capabilities, wealth, or rank. Statements such as “a\r\nman’s greatness is ever proportionate to the number of his wives,” or\r\n“polygamy is held to be the test of his wealth and consequence,” are\r\nvery frequently met with in books of travels. Thus the Apache “who can\r\nsupport or keep, or attract by his power to keep, the greatest number\r\nof women, is the man who is deemed entitled to the greatest amount of\r\nhonour and respect.”[3109]\r\n\r\nHowever desirable polygyny may be from man’s point of view, it is,\r\nas we have seen, altogether prohibited among many peoples, and, in\r\ncountries where it is an established institution, it is practised, as a\r\nrule to which there are few exceptions, only by a comparatively small\r\nclass. The proportion between the sexes partly accounts for this. But\r\nthere are other causes of no less importance.\r\n\r\nIn ethnographical descriptions it is very often stated that a man\r\ntakes as many wives as he is able to maintain. Where the amount of\r\nfemale labour is limited, where life is supported by hunting, where\r\nagriculture is unknown, and no accumulated property worth mentioning\r\nexists, it may be extremely difficult for a man to keep a plurality of\r\nwives. Among the Patagonians, for instance, it is chiefly those who\r\npossess some property who take more than one wife.[3110] Regarding\r\nthe Tuski, Mr. Hooper states that “each man has as many wives as\r\nhe can afford to keep, the question of food being the greatest\r\nconsideration.”[3111] In Oonalashka, according to v. Langsdorf, a\r\nman who had many wives, if his means decreased, sent first one, then\r\nanother back to their parents.[3112]\r\n\r\nAgain, where female labour is of considerable value, the necessity\r\nof paying the purchase-sum for a wife very often makes the poorer\r\npeople content with monogamy. Thus among the Zulus, Mr. Eyles writes,\r\nmany men have but one wife because cattle have to be paid for women.\r\nAmong the Gonds and Korkús, according to Mr. Forsyth, “polygamy\r\nis not forbidden, but, women being costly chattels, it is rarely\r\npractised.”[3113] Among the Bechuanas, says Andersson, there is no\r\nlimit, but his means of purchase, to the number of wives a man may\r\npossess.[3114] And the same is observed with reference to a great many\r\nother peoples, especially in Africa, where the woman-trade is at its\r\nheight. Polygyny is, moreover, checked to some extent by the man’s\r\nobligation to serve for his wife for a certain number of years, and\r\neven more by his having to settle down with his father-in-law for the\r\nwhole of his life.\r\n\r\nSo far as the woman is allowed to choose, she prefers, other things\r\nbeing equal, the man who is best able to support her, or the man of the\r\ngreatest wealth or highest position. Naturally, therefore, wherever\r\npolygyny prevails, it is the principal men—whether they owe their\r\nposition to birth, skill, or acquired wealth—who have the largest\r\nnumber of wives; or it may be that they alone have more than one wife.\r\nSpeaking of the Ainos of Yesso, Commander H. C. St. John says that a\r\nsuccessful or expert hunter or fisher sometimes keeps two wives; and,\r\nif a woman finds her husband an unsuccessful Nimrod, she abandons\r\nhim.[3115] Among the Aleuts, “the number of wives was not limited,\r\nexcept that the best hunters had the greatest number.”[3116] Among the\r\nKutchin, “polygamy is practised generally in proportion to the rank\r\nand wealth of the man;”[3117] and, among the Brazilian aborigines and\r\nthe Araucanians, polygyny occurs only or chiefly among rich men and\r\nchiefs.[3118] Touching the Equatorial Africans, Mr. Reade remarks,\r\n“The bush-man can generally afford but one wife, who must find him\r\nhis daily bread.... But the rich man can indulge in the institutions\r\nof polygamy and domestic slavery.”[3119] In Dahomey, as we are told,\r\n“the king has thousands of wives, the nobles hundreds, others tens;\r\nwhile the soldier is unable to support one.”[3120] In the New Hebrides,\r\npolygyny prevails especially among the chiefs; in Naiabui of New\r\nGuinea, “the head men only have more than two or three wives;” and, in\r\nSouth Australia, “the old men secure the greatest number.”[3121]\r\n\r\nThus polygyny has come to be associated with greatness, and is\r\ntherefore, as Mr. Spencer remarks, thought praiseworthy, while\r\nmonogamy, as associated with poverty, is thought mean.[3122] Indeed,\r\nplurality of wives has everywhere tended to become a more or less\r\ndefinite class distinction, the luxury being permitted, among some\r\npeoples, only to chiefs or nobles.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important of the influences which determine the form of\r\nmarriage is the position of women, or rather the respect in which they\r\nare held by men. For polygyny implies a violation of woman’s feelings.\r\n\r\nSeveral statements tend to show that jealousy and rivalry do not\r\nalways disturb the peace in polygynous families. It sometimes happens\r\nthat the first wife herself brings her husband a fresh wife or a\r\nconcubine, or advises him to take one, when she becomes old herself,\r\nor if she proves barren, or has a suckling child, or for some other\r\nreason.[3123] In Equatorial Africa, according to Mr. Reade, the women\r\nare the stoutest supporters of polygyny:—“If a man marries,” he says,\r\n“and his wife thinks that he can afford another spouse, she pesters\r\nhim to marry again, and calls him ‘a stingy fellow’ if he declines to\r\ndo so.”[3124] Speaking of the Makalolo women, Livingstone observes,\r\n“On hearing that a man in England could marry but one wife, several\r\nladies exclaimed that they would not like to live in such a country:\r\nthey could not imagine how English ladies could relish our custom, for,\r\nin their way of thinking, every man of respectability should have a\r\nnumber of wives, as a proof of his wealth. Similar ideas prevail all\r\ndown the Zambesi.”[3125] Among the Californian Modok also, according\r\nto the Hon. A. B. Meacham, the women are opposed to any change in the\r\npolygynous habits of the men.[3126] But such statements may easily\r\nbe misinterpreted. Often the wives live peacefully together only in\r\nconsequence of the strict discipline of the husband.[3127] They put up\r\nwith polygyny, thanks to long custom; they even approve of it where\r\nit procures them advantages. The consideration of the whole family,\r\nand especially of the first wife, is increased by every new marriage\r\nthe husband concludes.[3128] Where the wife is her husband’s slave,\r\npolygyny implies a greater division of labour. This is the reason\r\nwhy, among the Apaches, the women do not object to it; why, among the\r\nBagobos of the Philippines, they rejoice at the arrival of a new wife;\r\nwhy, in the Mohammedan East, they themselves encourage the husband to\r\nmarry more wives.[3129] Among the Arabs of Upper Egypt, says Baker,\r\none of the conditions of accepting a suitor is, that a female slave\r\nis to be provided for the special use of the wife, although the\r\nslaves of the establishment occupy, at the same time, the position of\r\nconcubines.[3130] Von Weber tells us of a Kafir woman who, on account\r\nof her heavy labour, passionately urged her husband to take another\r\nwife.[3131] Nevertheless, polygyny is an offence against the feelings\r\nof women, not only among highly civilized peoples, but even among the\r\nrudest savages. For jealousy is not exclusively a masculine passion,\r\nalthough it is generally more powerful in men than in women.[3132]\r\n\r\nThe Greenlanders have a saying that “whales, musk-oxen, and reindeer\r\ndeserted the country because the women were jealous at the conduct of\r\ntheir husbands.”[3133] Regarding the Northern Indians, Hearne says,\r\n“The men are in general very jealous of their wives, and I make no\r\ndoubt but the same spirit reigns among the women, but they are kept\r\nso much in awe of their husbands, that the liberty of thinking is the\r\ngreatest privilege they enjoy.”[3134] Franklin tells us of an Indian\r\nwoman who committed suicide by hanging herself, in a fit of jealousy;\r\nand another woman threw herself into the Mississippi with her child,\r\nwhen her husband took a new wife.[3135] As regards the Dacotahs, Mr.\r\nPrescott says that “polygamy is the cause of a great deal of their\r\nmiseries and troubles. The women, most of them, abhor the practice,\r\nbut are overruled by the men. Some of the women commit suicide on this\r\naccount.”[3136] The natives of Guiana, according to the Rev. W. H.\r\nBrett, live in comfort, as long as the man is content with one wife,\r\nbut, when he takes another, “the natural feelings of woman rebel at\r\nsuch cruel treatment, and jealousy and unhappiness have, in repeated\r\ninstances, led to suicide.”[3137] Among the Tamanacs, says v. Humboldt,\r\n“the husband calls the second and third wife the ‘companions’ of\r\nthe first; and the first treats these ‘companions’ as rivals and\r\n‘enemies’ (‘ipucjatoje’).”[3138] Among the Charruas, it often happens\r\nthat a woman abandons her husband if he has a plurality of wives, as\r\nsoon as she is able to find another man who will take her as his only\r\nwife.[3139] And, when a Fuegian has as many as four women, his hut is\r\nevery day transformed into a field of battle, and many a young and\r\npretty wife must even atone with her life for the precedence given her\r\nby the common husband.[3140]\r\n\r\nIn the islands of the Pacific similar scenes occur. The missionary\r\nWilliams’s wife once asked a Fiji woman who was _minus_ her nose, “How\r\nis it that so many of your women are without a nose?” “It is due to\r\na plurality of wives,” was the answer; “jealousy causes hatred, and\r\nthen the stronger tries to cut or bite off the nose of the one she\r\nhates.”[3141] In Tukopia, many a wife who believed another woman to be\r\npreferred by the husband committed suicide.[3142] Among the Australian\r\naborigines, the old wives are extremely jealous of their younger\r\nrivals, so that “a new woman would always be beaten by the other wife,\r\nand a good deal would depend on the fighting powers of the former\r\nwhether she kept her position or not.”[3143] Among the Narrinyeri,\r\naccording to the Rev. A. Meyer, the several wives of one man very\r\nseldom agree well with each other; they are continually quarrelling,\r\neach endeavouring to be the favourite.[3144] “The black women,” says\r\nHerr Lumholtz, “are also capable of being jealous.”[3145]\r\n\r\nAmong the Sea Dyaks, according to Sir Spenser St. John, the wife is\r\nmuch more jealous of her husband than he is of her.[3146] In China,\r\nmany women dislike the idea of getting married, as they fear that,\r\nshould their husbands become polygynists, there would remain for them\r\na life of unhappiness. Hence, some become Buddhist or Taouist nuns,\r\nand others prefer death by suicide to marriage.[3147] Mr. Balfour\r\nasserts that, among the Mohammedans and ruling Hindu races who permit\r\nand practise polygyny, it causes much intriguing and disquiet in\r\nhomes.[3148] According to Mr. Tod, it “is the fertile source of evil,\r\nmoral as well as physical, in the East.”[3149] The same view is taken\r\nby Pischon and d’Escayrac de Lauture with regard to the polygyny of\r\nthe Mohammedans.[3150] In Persia, says Dr. Polak, a married woman\r\ncannot feel a greater pain than if her husband takes a fresh wife, whom\r\nhe prefers to her; then she is quite disconsolate.[3151] In Egypt,\r\nquarrels between the various women belonging to the same man are very\r\nfrequent, and often the wife will not even allow her female slave or\r\nslaves to appear unveiled in the presence of her husband.[3152] In\r\nthe description, in the Book of Proverbs, of domestic happiness, it is\r\nassumed that the husband has only one wife;[3153] and, in the latter\r\npart of the ‘Rig-Veda,’ there are hymns in which wives curse their\r\nfellow-wives.[3154]\r\n\r\nThe Abyssinian women are described as very jealous; and in the\r\npolygynous families of the Eastern Africans, Zulus, Basutos, &c.,\r\nquarrels frequently arise.[3155] The Hova word for polygyny is\r\nderived from the root “ràfy,” which means “an adversary.” “So\r\ninvariably,” says the Rev. J. Sibree, “has the taking of more wives\r\nthan one shown itself to be a fruitful cause of enmity and strife in\r\na household, that this word, which means ‘the making an adversary,’\r\nis the term always applied to it.... The different wives are always\r\ntrying to get an advantage over each other, and to wheedle their\r\nhusband out of his property; constant quarrels and jealousy are the\r\nresult, and polygamy becomes inevitably the causing of strife, ‘the\r\nmaking an adversary.’”[3156] Statements of this kind cannot but shake\r\nour confidence in the optimistic assertions of Dr. Le Bon and other\r\ndefenders of polygyny.[3157]\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent quarrels and fights between the wives, the husband\r\nfrequently gives each of them a separate house. It is probably in\r\npart for the same reason that, among several peoples, wives are\r\nusually chosen from one family. In general, says Domenech, when\r\nan Indian wishes to have many wives, he chooses before all others,\r\nif he can, sisters, because he thinks he can thus secure more\r\ndomestic peace.[3158] This is true of many of the North American\r\naborigines;[3159] a man who marries the eldest daughter of a family\r\nsecures in many cases the right to marry all her sisters as soon as\r\nthey are old enough to become his wives.[3160] The same practice is\r\nsaid to prevail in Madagascar,[3161] and, combined with polyandry,\r\namong certain peoples of India. But it is obvious that the evils of\r\npolygyny are not removed by such arrangements.\r\n\r\nWhere women have succeeded in obtaining some power over their\r\nhusbands, or where the altruistic feelings of men have become refined\r\nenough to lead them to respect the feelings of those weaker than\r\nthemselves, monogamy is generally considered the only proper form of\r\nmarriage. Among monogamous savage or barbarous races the position of\r\nwomen is comparatively good; and the one phenomenon must be regarded\r\nas partly the cause, partly the effect of the other. The purely\r\nmonogamous Iroquois, to quote Schoolcraft, are “the only tribes in\r\nAmerica, north and south, so far as we have any accounts, who gave\r\nto woman a conservative power in their political deliberations. The\r\nIroquois matrons had their representative in the public councils;\r\nand they exercised a negative, or what we call a veto power, in the\r\nimportant question of the declaration of war. They had the right also\r\nto interpose in bringing about a peace.”[3162] Moreover, they had\r\nconsiderable privileges in the family.[3163] Among the Nicaraguans—a\r\npeople almost wholly monogamous,—the husbands are said to have been\r\nso much under the control of their wives that they were obliged to do\r\nthe housework, while the women attended to the trading.[3164] Among\r\nthe Zapotecs and other nations inhabiting the Isthmus of Tehuantepec,\r\nwho do not permit polygyny, “gentleness, affection, and frugality\r\ncharacterize the marital relations.”[3165] In New Hanover[3166] and\r\namong the Dyaks,[3167] the wife seems to have a kind of authority;\r\nand among the Minahassers, according to Dr. Hickson, “the woman is,\r\nand probably has been for many generations, on a footing of equality\r\nwith her husband.”[3168] Mr. Man states that, in the Andaman Islands,\r\n“the consideration and respect with which women are treated might\r\nwith advantage be emulated by certain classes in our own land.”[3169]\r\nThe Pádam wives are treated by their husbands with a regard that seems\r\nsingular in so rude a race. “But I have seen,” says Colonel Dalton,\r\n“other races as rude who in this respect are an example to more\r\ncivilized people. It is because with these rude people the inclination\r\nof the persons most interested in the marriage is consulted, and\r\npolygamy is not practised.”[3170] The Munda Kols of Chota Nagpore\r\ncall a wife “the mistress of the house,” and she takes up a position\r\nsimilar to that of a married woman in Europe.[3171] The Santal\r\nwomen, who enjoy the advantage of reigning alone in the husband’s\r\nwigwam, according to Mr. E. G. Man, hold a much higher _status_ in\r\nthe family circle than their less fortunate sisters in most Eastern\r\ncountries.[3172] The Kandhs, Bodo, and Dhimáls treat their wives\r\nand daughters with confidence and kindness, and consult them in all\r\ndomestic concerns.[3173] Among the monogamous Moors of the Western\r\nSoudan, the women exercise a considerable influence on the men, who\r\ntake the greatest pains to pay them homage.[3174] The Touareg wives’\r\nauthority is so great that, although Islam permits polygyny, the men\r\nare forced to live in monogamy.[3175] Among the monogamous Tedâ, the\r\nwomen hold a very high position in the family.[3176] As for European\r\nmonogamy, there can be no doubt that it owes its origin chiefly to the\r\nconsideration of men for the feelings of women.\r\n\r\nThe form of marriage is, further, influenced by the quality of the\r\npassions which unites the sexes. When love depends entirely on external\r\nattractions, it is necessarily fickle; but when it implies sympathy\r\narising from mental qualities, there is a tie between husband and wife\r\nwhich lasts long after youth and beauty are gone.\r\n\r\nIt remains for us to note the true monogamous instinct, the absorbing\r\npassion for one, as a powerful obstacle to polygyny. “The sociable\r\ninterest,” Professor Bain remarks, “is by its nature diffused: even\r\nthe maternal feeling admits of plurality of objects; revenge does\r\nnot desire to have but one victim; the love of domination needs many\r\nsubjects; but the greatest intensity of love limits the regards to\r\none.”[3177] The beloved person acquires, in the imagination of the\r\nlover, an immeasurable superiority over all others. “The beginnings of\r\na special affection,” the same psychologist says, “turn upon a small\r\ndifference of liking; but such differences are easily exaggerated; the\r\nfeeling and the estimate acting and re-acting, till the distinction\r\nbecomes altogether transcendent.”[3178] This absorbing passion for one\r\nis not confined to the members of civilized societies. It is found\r\nalso among savage peoples, and even among some of the lower animals.\r\nHermann Müller, Brehm, and other good observers have proved that\r\nit is experienced by birds; and Mr. Darwin found it among certain\r\ndomesticated mammals.[3179] The love-bird rarely survives the death\r\nof its companion, even when supplied with a fresh and suitable\r\nmate.[3180] M. Houzeau states, on the authority of Frédéric Cuvier,\r\n“Lorsque l’un des ouistitis (_Harpale jacchus_) du Jardin des Plantes\r\nde Paris vint à mourir l’époux survivant fut inconsolable. Il caressa\r\nlongtemps le cadavre de sa compagne; et quand à la fin il fut convaincu\r\nde la triste réalité, il se mit les mains sur les yeux, et resta sans\r\nbouger et sans prendre de nourriture, jusqu’à ce qu’il eût lui-même\r\nsuccombé.”[3181]\r\n\r\nAmong the Indians of Western Washington and North-Western Oregon, says\r\nDr. Gibbs, “a strong sensual attachment undoubtedly often exists,\r\nwhich leads to marriage, as instances are not rare of young women\r\ndestroying themselves on the death of a lover.”[3182] The like is said\r\nof other Indian tribes, in which suicide from unsuccessful love has\r\nsometimes occurred even among men.[3183] Colonel Dalton represents the\r\nPahária lads and lasses as forming very romantic attachments; “if\r\nseparated only for an hour,” he says, “they are miserable.”[3184]\r\nDavis tells us of a negro who, after vain attempts to redeem his\r\nsweetheart from slavery, became a slave himself rather than be\r\nseparated from her.[3185] In Tahiti, unsuccessful suitors have been\r\nknown to commit suicide;[3186] and even the rude Australian girl sings\r\nin a strain of romantic affliction—\r\n\r\n  “I never shall see my darling again.”[3187]\r\n\r\nAs a man, under certain circumstances, desires many wives, so a woman\r\nmay have several reasons for desiring a plurality of husbands. But the\r\njealousy of man does not readily suffer any rivals, and, as he is the\r\nstronger, his will is decisive. Hence, where polyandry occurs, it is\r\nonly exceptionally a result of the woman’s wishes.\r\n\r\nVarious causes have been adduced for this revolting practice.\r\nThe difficulty of raising the sum for a wife, and the expense of\r\nmaintaining women may perhaps in part account for it.[3188] Regarding\r\npolyandry in Kunawar, the Rev. W. Rebsch says that the cause assigned\r\nis not poverty, but a desire to keep the common patrimony from being\r\ndistributed among a number of brothers.[3189] Some writers believe\r\nthat polyandry subserves the useful end of preventing the woman from\r\nbeing exposed to danger and difficulty, when she is left alone in her\r\nremote home during the prolonged absences of her lord.[3190] According\r\nto the Sinhalese, the practice originated in the so-called feudal\r\ntimes, when the enforced attendance of the people on the king and the\r\nhigher chiefs would have led to the ruin of the rice lands, had not\r\nsome interested party been left to look after the tillage. But Sir\r\nEmerson Tennent remarks that polyandry is much more ancient than the\r\nsystem thus indicated: it is shown to have existed at a period long\r\nantecedent to “feudalism.”[3191] To whatever other causes the practice\r\nmay be attributed, the chief immediate cause is, no doubt, a numerical\r\ndisproportion between the sexes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE FORMS OF HUMAN MARRIAGE\r\n\r\n(_Concluded_)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the history of the forms of human marriage, two inferences\r\nregarding monogamy and polygyny may be made with absolute certainty:\r\nmonogamy, always the predominant form of marriage, has been more\r\nprevalent at the lowest stages of civilization than at somewhat higher\r\nstages; whilst, at a still higher stage, polygyny has again, to a great\r\nextent, yielded to monogamy.\r\n\r\nAs already said, wars, often greatly disturbing the proportion of\r\nthe sexes among peoples with a highly developed tribal organization,\r\nexercise a much smaller influence in that respect in societies of a\r\nruder type. As in such societies all men are nearly equal, and, to\r\nquote Mr. Wallace, “each man scrupulously respects the rights of\r\nhis fellow, and any infraction of those rights rarely or never takes\r\nplace,”[3192] no great scope is left for polygynous habits.\r\n\r\nPlurality of wives has comparatively few attractions for the men of\r\nrude communities, where life is supported chiefly by hunting, and\r\nfemale labour is of slight value. In societies of a higher kind, the\r\ncase is different. True, in such societies a man has to buy his wife,\r\nand women are often costly chattels; but this obstacle to polygyny\r\nis more than counterbalanced by the accumulation of wealth and the\r\ndistinction of classes.\r\n\r\nNothing, indeed, is more favourable to polygyny than social\r\ndifferentiation. “In its highest and regulated form,” Mr. Morgan\r\njustly observes, “it presupposes a considerable advance of society,\r\ntogether with the development of superior and inferior classes, and of\r\nsome kinds of wealth.”[3193] Speaking of the Iroquois, Colden long ago\r\nremarked that, “in any nation where all are on a par as to riches and\r\npower, plurality of wives cannot well be introduced.”[3194] According\r\nto Waitz, the reason why polygyny is very rare among the Hottentots\r\nis, that they do not know of any disparity in rank and wealth.[3195]\r\nThe Rock Veddahs have no class distinction, and, though each party\r\namong them has a headman—the most energetic senior of the tribe,—he\r\nexercises scarcely any authority.[3196] Almost the same may be said of\r\nmost of the monogamous savage peoples whom we have mentioned. Thus,\r\namong the Pádams, all, except slaves, are equal in rank;[3197] and of\r\nthe Kukis it is said that all eat and drink together, and that “one\r\nman is as good as another.”[3198] This is true of the Chittagong Hill\r\ntribes in general, who enjoy a perfect social equality, their nomadic\r\nlife precluding any great accumulation of wealth.[3199] Among the\r\nHill Dyaks, as Mr. Spencer observes, chiefs are unable to enforce\r\ngenuine subordination; the headman of each Bodo and Dhimál village has\r\nbut nominal authority; and the governor of a Pueblo town is annually\r\nelected.[3200] In Tana, where the authority of a chief does not seem\r\nto extend a gunshot beyond his own dwelling, few chiefs have more than\r\nthree wives, and most of them have only one or two.[3201] On the other\r\nhand, throughout Africa, polygyny and great class distinctions occur\r\nsimultaneously. We may therefore safely conclude that polygyny became\r\nmore prevalent in proportion as differentiation increased with the\r\nprogress of civilization.\r\n\r\nIt is a notable fact that the higher savages and barbarians indulge in\r\nthis practice to a greater extent than the very lowest races. These,\r\nwith few exceptions, are either strictly monogamous, or but little\r\naddicted to polygyny. The lowest forest tribes in Brazil and the\r\ninterior of Borneo are monogamous. Among the Veddahs and Andamanese,\r\nmonogamy is as rigidly insisted upon as anywhere in Europe. According\r\nto Captain Lewin, the monogamous Toungtha are “unamenable to the\r\nlures of civilization,” and he thinks it will be found difficult, if\r\nnot impossible, to wean them from their savage life.[3202] The Mrús\r\nare despised as wild men by the polygynous Khyoungtha;[3203] and the\r\nCalifornians, who, according to Mr. Powers, were far less addicted to\r\npolygyny than the Atlantic Indians, are “a humble and a lowly race,\r\n... one of the lowest on earth.”[3204]\r\n\r\nCertain peoples who were originally monogamous are known to have\r\nadopted polygyny under the influence of a higher civilization. Thus,\r\naccording to Professor Vámbéry, there is not a single indication\r\nthat polygyny was an institution of the primitive Turco-Tartars,\r\nand even now it is almost unknown among the nomadic peoples of that\r\nrace.[3205] Dr. Mason and Mr. Smeaton state that, among the Karens,\r\nit is occasionally practised only by those who are brought much in\r\ncontact with the Burmese.[3206] Among the Hindus, according to Mr.\r\nDutt, polygyny seems to have grown in the latter part of the Vedic age,\r\nas there are scarcely any allusions to it in the earlier hymns.[3207]\r\nGoguet observes that “fables which can be traced back to the earliest\r\ntimes give us no instance of any man’s having more than one lawful\r\nwife.”[3208] Although the majority of the heroes in the writings of\r\nKalidasa are described as polygynists,[3209] the principal divinities\r\nwhom the Hindus acknowledge are represented as married to but one\r\nlegitimate wife.[3210] The higher position so generally granted to the\r\n_first_ married wife in polygynous families seems to indicate in most\r\ncases a transition from monogamous to polygynous habits, and not _vice\r\nversa_, as has often been suggested.[3211]\r\n\r\nMonogamy is the more likely to have prevailed almost exclusively among\r\nour earliest human ancestors, since it does so among the man-like apes.\r\nMr. Darwin certainly mentions the Gorilla as a polygamist;[3212] but\r\nthe majority of statements we have regarding this animal are to the\r\nopposite effect. Relying on the most trustworthy authorities, Professor\r\nHartmann says, “The Gorilla lives in a society consisting of male and\r\nfemale and their young of varying ages.”[3213]\r\n\r\nWe may thus take for granted that civilization up to a certain point is\r\nfavourable to polygyny; but it is equally certain that in its higher\r\nforms it leads to monogamy.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief advantages of civilization is the decrease of\r\nwars. The death-rate of men has consequently become less, and the\r\nconsiderable disproportion between the sexes which, among many warlike\r\npeoples, makes polygyny almost a law of nature, no longer exists\r\namong the most advanced nations. No superstitious belief keeps the\r\ncivilized man apart from his wife during her pregnancy and whilst she\r\nsuckles her child; and the suckling time has become much shorter since\r\nthe introduction of domesticated animals and the use of milk. To a\r\ncultivated mind youth and beauty are by no means the only attractions\r\nof a woman; and civilization has made female beauty more durable. The\r\ndesire for offspring as we have seen, has become less intense. A large\r\nfamily, instead of being a help in the struggle for existence, is often\r\nconsidered an insufferable burden. A man’s kinsfolk are not now his\r\nonly friends, and his wealth and power do not depend upon the number\r\nof his wives and children. A wife has ceased to be a mere labourer,\r\nand for manual labour we have to a great extent substituted the work\r\nof domesticated animals and the use of implements and machines.[3214]\r\nPolygyny has thus, in many ways, become less desirable for the\r\ncivilized man than it was for his barbarian and savage ancestors. And\r\nother causes have co-operated to produce the same result.\r\n\r\nWhen the feelings of women are held in due respect, monogamy will\r\nnecessarily be the only recognized form of marriage. In no way does\r\nthe progress of mankind show itself more clearly than in the increased\r\nacknowledgment of women’s rights, and the causes which, at lower stages\r\nof development, may make polygyny desired by women themselves, do not\r\nexist in highly civilized societies. The refined feeling of love,\r\ndepending chiefly upon mutual sympathy and upon appreciation of mental\r\nqualities, is scarcely compatible with polygynous habits; and the\r\npassion for one has gradually become more absorbing.\r\n\r\nWill monogamy be the only recognized form of marriage in the future?\r\nThis question has been answered in different ways. According to Mr.\r\nSpencer, “the monogamic form of the sexual relation is manifestly\r\nthe ultimate form; and any changes to be anticipated must be in the\r\ndirection of completion and extension of it.”[3215] Dr. Le Bon, on the\r\nother hand, thinks that European laws will, in the future, legalize\r\npolygyny;[3216] and M. Letourneau remarks that, although we may now\r\nlook upon monogamy as superior to any other form of marriage yet\r\nknown, “we need not consider it the Ultima Thule in the evolution of\r\nconnubial ceremonies.”[3217] But we may without hesitation assert that,\r\nif mankind advance in the same direction as hitherto; if, consequently,\r\nthe causes to which monogamy in the most progressive societies owes\r\nits origin continue to operate with constantly growing force; if,\r\nespecially, altruism increases, and the feeling of love becomes more\r\nrefined, and more exclusively directed to one,—the laws of monogamy can\r\nnever be changed, but must be followed much more strictly than they are\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. McLennan suggests that, in early times, polyandry was the rule\r\nand monogamy and polygyny exceptions. According to his view, the\r\nonly marriage law in which female kinship could have originated was\r\npolyandry—polyandry of “the ruder sort,” in which the husbands are\r\nnot kinsmen. And it is, he says, impossible not to believe that the\r\nLevirate—that is, the practice of marrying a dead brother’s widow—is\r\nderived from polyandry.[3218] The fallacy of the first inference, which\r\nassumes the system of “kinship through females only” to depend upon\r\nuncertainty as to fathers, has already been shown. The second inference\r\nwill be found to be equally erroneous.\r\n\r\nThe Levirate is undoubtedly a wide-spread custom;[3219] and, if it\r\ncould be proved to be a survival of polyandry, we should be compelled\r\nto conclude that this form of marriage was at one time very common.\r\nWhere women are regarded as property, they are, of course, inherited\r\nlike other possessions.[3220] In many cases the brother, or, in\r\ndefault of a brother, the nearest male relation, is expressly stated\r\nto be _entitled_ to have the widow; and, if he does not marry her, he\r\nhas nevertheless, the guardianship over her, and may give her away\r\nor sell her to some other man.[3221] But there are several peoples\r\nwho consider the Levirate a duty rather than a right.[3222] Among\r\nthe Thlinkets, for example, when a husband dies, his brother or his\r\nsister’s son must marry the widow, and the neglect of this obligation\r\nhas occasioned bloody feuds.[3223] The law requiring a man to take care\r\nof a sister-in-law is analogous to other duties devolving on kinsfolk,\r\nsuch as the vendetta, &c. Mr. McLennan lays stress on the fact that it\r\nis the deceased husband’s _brother_ who inherits his widow. “How came\r\nthe right of succession,” he says, “to open, as in the ruder cases,\r\nto the brother in preference to the son of the deceased? We repeat\r\nthat the only explanation that can be given of this is, that the law\r\nof succession was derived from polyandry.”[3224] But among many of\r\nthe peoples who have the custom of the Levirate, sons either inherit\r\nnothing or are preceded by brothers in succession.[3225] Among the\r\nSantals, for instance, “when the elder brother dies, the next younger\r\ninherits the widow, children, and all the property.”[3226] Among a few\r\npeoples, the widow together with the other property of the dead man\r\ngoes either to his brother or to his sister’s son.[3227] But it is\r\nmore natural, where succession runs in the female line, that the widow\r\nshould be married by the brother than by the nephew, because, as a\r\nrule, she is much older than the nephew, and he, in many cases, is too\r\nyoung to marry and to maintain her properly.\r\n\r\nEven when a son inherits the other property of his father, it is easy\r\nto understand why he does not inherit the widow. To inherit her is,\r\ngenerally speaking, to marry her. But nowhere is a son allowed to\r\nmarry his own mother; hence it is natural, at least where monogamy\r\nprevails, that the right of succession in this case should belong to\r\nthe brother. In polygynous families, on the other hand, it often\r\nhappens that the eldest son, or all the sons, inherit the father’s\r\nwidows, the mother being in each case excepted.[3228] Among the\r\nBakalai, a tribe in Equatorial Africa, widows are permitted to marry\r\nthe son of their deceased husband, and, if there be no son, they may\r\nlive with the deceased husband’s brother.[3229] As regards the Negroes\r\nof Benin, Bosman states that, if the mother of the eldest son, the only\r\nheir, be alive, he allows her a proper maintenance, but his father’s\r\nother widows, especially those who have not had children, the son\r\ntakes home, if he likes them, and uses as his own; but if the deceased\r\nleaves no children, the brother inherits all his property.[3230] Among\r\nthe Mishmis, the heir obtains the wives, with the exception of his\r\nown mother, who goes to the next male relation.[3231] Concerning the\r\nKafirs of Natal, Mr. Shooter observes that, “when a man dies, those\r\nwives who have not left the kraal remain with the eldest son. If they\r\nwish to marry again, they must go to one of their late husband’s\r\nbrothers.”[3232] The rules of succession are thus modified according\r\nto circumstances, and they are not uniform even among the same people.\r\nIt frequently happens that the brother succeeds to the chieftainship,\r\nwhilst the son inherits the property of the dead man[3233]—no doubt\r\nbecause the brother, being older and more experienced, is generally\r\nbetter fitted for command than the son.[3234]\r\n\r\nMr. McLennan calls attention to the fact that, among certain peoples,\r\nthe children begotten by the brother are accounted the children of\r\nthe brother deceased.[3235] “It is obvious,” he says, “that it\r\ncould more easily be feigned that the children belonged to the brother\r\ndeceased, if already, at a prior stage, the children of the brotherhood\r\nhad been accounted the children of the eldest brother, _i.e._, if we\r\nsuppose the obligation to be a relic of polyandry.”[3236] But this\r\nexplanation is very far-fetched. As Dr. Starcke justly observes, a\r\nman may, from a juridical point of view, be the father of a child,\r\nthough he is not so in fact.[3237] In New Guinea, says M. Bink, “à\r\nla mort du père, c’est l’oncle (frère du père) qui se charge de la\r\ntutelle; si l’enfant devient orphelin, il reconnaît son oncle comme son\r\npère.”[3238] In Samoa, the brother of a deceased husband considered\r\nhimself entitled to have his brother’s wife, and to be regarded by\r\nthe orphan children as their father.[3239] And, among the Kafirs of\r\nNatal, the children of a deceased man’s widow born in marriage with\r\nhis brother, belong to his son.[3240] Quite in accordance with these\r\nfacts, the children of a widow may be considered to belong to her\r\nformer husband. Indeed, where death without posterity is looked upon as\r\na horrible calamity, the ownership of the children is a thing of the\r\nutmost importance for the dead man. It is only when the deceased has no\r\noffspring that the Jewish, Hindu, and Malagasy laws prescribe that the\r\nbrother shall “raise up seed” to him.\r\n\r\nMr. McLennan has thus failed in his attempt to prove that polyandry has\r\nformed a general stage in the development of marriage institutions; and\r\nwe may almost with certainty infer that it has always been exceptional.\r\nWe have already pointed out the groundlessness of Mr. McLennan’s\r\nsuggestion that in all, or nearly all, the primitive hordes there was\r\na want of balance between the sexes, the men being in the majority\r\non account of female infanticide.[3241] Moreover, though polyandry\r\nis due to an excess of men, it would be a mistake to conclude that\r\nan excess of men always causes polyandry. This practice presupposes\r\nan abnormally feeble disposition to jealousy—a peculiarity of all\r\npeoples among whom polyandry occurs. The Eskimo are described as a\r\nrace with extraordinarily weak passions.[3242] Among the Sinhalese,\r\nsays Dr. Davy, jealousy is not very troublesome among the men, and\r\nthe infidelity of a woman is generally easily forgiven.[3243] The\r\npeople of Ladakh are a mild, timid, and indolent race.[3244] The Kulu\r\nhusbands “sont très peu jaloux.”[3245] The same is said by Mr. Fraser\r\nwith regard to the people of Sirmore. The women are “entirely at the\r\nservice of such as will pay for their favours, without feeling the\r\nslightest sense of shame or crime in a practice from which they are not\r\ndiscouraged by early education, example, or even the dread of their\r\nlords, who only require a part of the profit.”[3246] The Tibetans\r\nare represented as very little addicted to jealousy,[3247] being, as\r\nMr. Wilson remarks, a race of a peculiarly placid and unpassionate\r\ntemperament.[3248] But such a lack of jealousy, as we have seen, is a\r\nrare exception in the human race, and utterly unlikely to have been\r\nuniversal at any time.\r\n\r\nPolyandry seems, indeed, to presuppose a certain amount of\r\ncivilization. We have no trustworthy account of its occurrence among\r\nthe lowest savage races. Mr. Bridges writes that the Yahgans of Tierra\r\ndel Fuego consider it utterly abominable. With regard to the Veddahs,\r\nMr. Bailey states, “Polyandry is unknown among them. The practice\r\nis alluded to with genuine disgust. I asked a Veddah once what the\r\nconsequence would be if one of their women were to live with two\r\nhusbands, and the unaffected vehemence with which he raised his axe,\r\nand said, ‘A blow would settle it,’ showed conclusively to my mind the\r\nnatural repugnance with which they regard the national custom of their\r\nKandyan neighbours.”[3249] These neighbours are much superior to the\r\nVeddahs in civilization; and the other peoples practising polyandry\r\nhave left the lowest stages of development far behind them. The Eskimo\r\nare a rather advanced race, and so are the polyandrous nations of\r\nthe Asiatic continent. Speaking of the people of Sirmore, Mr. Fraser\r\nobserves, “It is remarkable that a people so degraded in morals, and\r\nmany of whose customs are of so revolting a nature, should in other\r\nrespects evince a much higher advancement in civilization than we\r\ndiscover among other nations, whose manners are more engaging, and\r\nwhose moral character ranks infinitely higher. Their persons are better\r\nclad and more decent; their approach more polite and unembarrassed;\r\nand their address is better than that of most of the inhabitants of\r\nthe remote Highlands of Scotland; ... and their houses, in point of\r\nconstruction, comfort and internal cleanliness, are beyond comparison\r\nsuperior to Scottish Highland dwellings.”[3250] On the arrival of the\r\nSpaniards, the polyandrous inhabitants of Lancerote were distinguished\r\nfrom the other Canarians, who were strictly monogamous, by marks of\r\ngreater civilization.[3251]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in polyandrous families the husbands are generally\r\nbrothers, and that the eldest brother, at least in many cases, has the\r\nsuperiority, the younger husbands having almost the position, if the\r\nterm may be used, of male concubines. It is a fair conclusion that, in\r\nsuch instances, polyandry was originally an expression of fraternal\r\nbenevolence on the part of the eldest brother, who gave his younger\r\nbrothers a share in his wife, if, on account of the scarcity of women,\r\nthey would otherwise have had to live unmarried. If additional wives\r\nwere afterwards acquired, they would naturally be considered the common\r\nproperty of all the brothers. In this way the group-marriage of the\r\nToda type seems to have been evolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE DURATION OF HUMAN MARRIAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time during which marriage lasts, varies very considerably among\r\ndifferent species. According to Dr. Brehm, most birds pair for\r\nlife,[3252] while among the mammals, with the exception of man and\r\nperhaps the anthropomorphous apes, the same male and female scarcely\r\never live together longer than a year.[3253] In human marriage every\r\ndegree of duration is met with—from unions which, though legally\r\nrecognized as marriages, do not endure long enough to deserve to be so\r\ncalled, to others which are dissolved only by death.\r\n\r\nThere are a few remarkable instances of peoples among whom separation\r\nis said to be entirely unknown. In the Andaman Islands, according to\r\nMr. Man, “no incompatibility of temper or other cause is allowed to\r\ndissolve the union.”[3254] The same is said of certain Papuans of New\r\nGuinea,[3255] and of several tribes of the Indian Archipelago who\r\nhave remained in their native state, and continue to follow ancient\r\ncustom.[3256] The Veddahs of Ceylon have a proverb that “death alone\r\nseparates husband and wife;” and Mr. Bailey assures us that they\r\nfaithfully act on this principle.[3257]\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, however, human marriage is not necessarily\r\ncontracted for life. The Indians of North America dissolve their\r\nunions as readily as they enter into them. The Wyandots had, it\r\nis said, marriages upon trial, which were binding for a few days\r\nonly.[3258] In Greenland, husband and wife sometimes separate after\r\nliving together for half a year.[3259] Among the Creeks, “marriage\r\nis considered only as a temporary convenience, not binding on the\r\nparties more than one year,” the consequence being that “a large\r\nportion of the old and middle-aged men, by frequently changing, have\r\nhad many different wives, and their children, scattered around the\r\ncountry, are unknown to them.”[3260] Speaking of the Botocudos, Mr.\r\nKeane remarks that their marriages “are all of a purely temporary\r\nnature, contracted without formalities of any sort, dissolved on the\r\nslightest pretext, or without any pretext, merely through love of\r\nchange or caprice.”[3261] In Ruk, it frequently happens that newly\r\nmarried husbands repudiate their wives;[3262] and, in the Pelew and\r\nKingsmill Groups, and among the aborigines of Northern Queensland,\r\ndivorces are of common occurrence.[3263] “Tasmanian lords,” says Dr.\r\nMilligan, “had no difficulty, and made no scruple, about a succession\r\nof wives.”[3264] Again, in Samoa, “if the marriage had been contracted\r\nmerely for the sake of the property and festivities of the occasion,\r\nthe wife was not likely to be more than a few days, or weeks, with her\r\nhusband.”[3265] In several of the Islands of the Indian Archipelago,\r\n“in the regular marriages the parties are always betrothed to each\r\nother for a longer or shorter time, sometimes not for more than a month\r\nand at others for a period of years.”[3266] Among the Dyaks, there\r\nare few middle-aged men who have not had several wives, and instances\r\nhave been known of young women of seventeen or eighteen who had already\r\nlived with three or four husbands.[3267] Among the Yendalines in\r\nIndo-China, it is rare for any woman to arrive at middle age without\r\nhaving a family by two or more husbands.[3268] The Maldivians, as we\r\nare informed by Mr. Rosset, are so fond of change that many a man\r\nmarries and divorces the same woman three or four times in the course\r\nof his life.[3269] Among the Sinhalese, according to Knox, “both men\r\nand women have frequently to marry four or five times before they can\r\nsettle down contented;”[3270] and Father Bourien says of the Mantras of\r\nthe interior of the Malay Peninsula, that it is not uncommon to meet\r\nindividuals who have married even forty or fifty different times.[3271]\r\nAmong the Munda Kols, Khasias, Tartars,[3272] and most Mohammedan\r\npeoples,[3273] divorces are very frequent. According to Dr. van der\r\nBerg, an even more fatal influence is exercised on family life in\r\nthe East by this laxity of the marriage tie than by polygyny.[3274]\r\nBurckhardt knew Bedouins forty-five years old who had had more than\r\nfifty wives.[3275] A “Sighe” wife in Persia is taken in marriage for\r\na certain legally stipulated period, which may vary from one hour to\r\nninety-nine years.[3276] In Cairo, according to Mr. Lane, there are not\r\nmany persons who have not divorced one wife, if they have been married\r\nfor a long time; and many men in Egypt have in the course of two years\r\nmarried as many as twenty, thirty, or more wives; whilst there are\r\nwomen, not far advanced in age, who have been wives to a dozen or\r\nmore men successively. Mr. Lane has even heard of men who have been in\r\nthe habit of marrying a new wife almost every month.[3277] In Morocco,\r\nDr. Churcher writes to me, a terrible state of things springs from the\r\nease with which divorce is obtained; a man repudiates his wife on the\r\nslightest provocation and marries again. “One of the servants here,”\r\nhe continues, “is reported to have had nineteen wives already, though\r\nhe is still only middle-aged.” Indeed, among the Moors of the Sahara,\r\naccording to Mr. Reade, it is considered “low” for a couple to live\r\ntoo long together, and “the leaders of fashion are those who have\r\nbeen the oftenest divorced.”[3278] Lobo tells us that, in Abyssinia,\r\nmarriage was usually entered upon for a term of years;[3279] and,\r\namong the Somals, separation is exceedingly common.[3280] Many negro\r\npeoples marry upon trial or for a fixed time.[3281] Among the Negroes\r\nof Bondo, a man may so often send away his wife and take a new one that\r\nit is difficult to know who is the father of the children born.[3282]\r\nRegarding the ancient Persians, Professor Rawlinson observes that the\r\neasiness of divorce among the Magians was in accordance with Eranian\r\nnotions on the subject of marriage—“notions far less strict than those\r\nwhich have commonly prevailed among civilized nations.”[3283] Among the\r\nGreeks, especially the Athenians,[3284] and among the Teutons,[3285]\r\ndivorce often occurred; and in Rome, at the close of the Republic\r\nand the commencement of the Empire, it prevailed to a frightful\r\nextent.[3286]\r\n\r\nAmong uncivilized races, as a rule, and among many advanced peoples, a\r\nman may divorce his wife whenever he likes. The Aleuts used to exchange\r\ntheir wives for food and clothes.[3287] In Tonga, a husband divorces\r\nhis wife by simply telling her that she may go.[3288] Among the Hovas\r\nof Madagascar, until the spread of Christianity, marriage was compared\r\nto a knot so lightly tied that it could be undone with the slightest\r\npossible touch.[3289] In Yucatan, a man might divorce his wife for the\r\nmerest trifle, even though he had children by her.[3290] Among the\r\nancient Hebrews,[3291] Greeks,[3292] Romans,[3293] and Germans,[3294]\r\ndislike was considered a sufficient reason for divorce, which was\r\nregarded as merely a private act.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, among a great many peoples, although a husband may\r\ndivorce his wife, he does so only under certain exceptional conditions,\r\nmarriage, as a rule, being concluded for life.[3295] The Greenlanders\r\nseldom repudiate wives who have had children.[3296] Among the\r\nCalifornian Wintun, according to Mr. Powers, it is very uncommon for\r\na man to expel his wife. “In a moment of passion he may strike her\r\ndead, or ... ignominiously slink away with another, but the idea of\r\ndivorcing and sending away a wife does not occur to him.”[3297] Among\r\nthe Naudowessies, divorce is so rare that Carver had no opportunity\r\nof learning how it is accomplished.[3298] Speaking of several tribes\r\non the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, Harmon remarks that\r\nseparation between husband and wife is seldom permanent, the parties,\r\nafter a few days’ absence from one another, generally having an\r\ninclination to come together again.[3299] The Iroquois, in ancient\r\ntimes, regarded separation as discreditable to both man and woman,\r\nhence it was not frequently practised.[3300] If an Uaupé takes a new\r\nwife, the elder one is never turned away, but remains the mistress of\r\nthe house.[3301] Among the Charruas and Patagonians, marriage lasts,\r\nas a rule, during the whole of life, if there are children.[3302]\r\nAnd, concerning the Yahgans, Mr. Bridges writes that there have been\r\nmany instances amongst them of husband and wife living together until\r\nseparated by death. The same is the case in Lifu, as I am informed\r\nby Mr. Radfield. In Tonga, according to Mariner, more than half of\r\nthe number of married women were parted from their husbands only by\r\ndeath.[3303] Among the Maoris[3304] and the Solomon Islanders,[3305]\r\nand in New Guinea,[3306] divorce is exceptional; and, even in\r\nTahiti, the birth of children generally prevented the dissolution of\r\nmarriage.[3307] In many of the islands of the Indian Archipelago,\r\ndivorce may, by law or custom, be readily obtained, but Mr. Crawfurd\r\nsays that it is very rarely sued for.[3308] The Garos, according to\r\nColonel Dalton, “will not hastily make engagements, because, when they\r\ndo make them, they intend to keep them.”[3309] Among the Karens, Dr.\r\nBunker writes, separations, save by death, are rare. Mr. Ingham informs\r\nme that, among the Bakongo, there are plenty of instances of husband\r\nand wife living together till death. Archdeacon Hodgson states the\r\nsame regarding the Eastern Central Africans, Mr. Swann regarding the\r\nWaguha, Mr. Eyles regarding the Zulus. Among the Cis-Natalian Kafirs,\r\naccording to Mr. Cousins, marriage, in the majority of instances, is\r\ncontracted for life.[3310] In the early days of Hebrew history, says\r\nEwald, it was only in exceptional cases that husbands made an evil use\r\nof the right to divorce a wife.[3311] Among the Greeks of the Homeric\r\nage, divorce seems to have been almost unknown, though it afterwards\r\nbecame an everyday event in Greece;[3312] and in Rome, in the earliest\r\ntimes, it was probably very little used.[3313]\r\n\r\nAmong many peoples custom or law has limited the husband’s power to\r\ndispose of his wife, permitting divorce only under certain conditions.\r\nThus, among the Kukis, “if a woman has a son by her husband, the\r\nmarriage is indissoluble,” though, if they do not agree, and have\r\nno son, the husband can cast off his wife and take another.[3314]\r\nThe Red Karens in Indo-China allow divorce if there are no children;\r\n“but should there be one child, the parents are not permitted to\r\nseparate.”[3315] In the tribes of Western Victoria, described by Mr.\r\nDawson, a man can divorce a childless wife for serious misconduct,\r\nbut in every case the charge against her must first be laid before\r\nthe chiefs of his own and his wife’s tribes, and their consent to\r\nher punishment obtained. If the wife has children, she cannot be\r\ndivorced.[3316] Among the Santals and the Tipperahs, divorce can be\r\neffected only with the consent of the husband’s clansmen, or a jury of\r\nvillage elders.[3317] Several tribes of the Indian Archipelago do not\r\nallow a man to repudiate his wife, except in case of adultery;[3318]\r\nand certain negro peoples have a similar rule, so far as the chief\r\nor first wife is concerned.[3319] Among the Hottentots, according to\r\nKolben, a man may divorce his wife only “upon showing such cause as\r\nshall be satisfactory to the men of the kraal where they live.”[3320]\r\nMr. Casalis states that, among the Basutos, “sterility is the\r\nonly cause of divorce which is not subject to litigation;”[3321]\r\nand, according to Toda custom, the separation of married couples\r\ndoes not seem to be lightly tolerated.[3322] Among certain lower\r\nraces the consent of the wife appears generally to be necessary for\r\nseparation.[3323]\r\n\r\nCivilized nations, more commonly than savages, consider marriage a\r\nunion which must not be dissolved by the husband except for certain\r\nreasons stipulated by law. Among the Aztecs, it was looked upon as a\r\ntie binding for life, and divorce was always discouraged both by the\r\nmagistrates and the community. The husband could repudiate even his\r\nconcubines only for just cause and with the sanction of the courts, and\r\nthe chief wife only for malevolence, dirtiness, or sterility.[3324]\r\nIn Nicaragua, the sole offence for which a wife could be divorced\r\nwas adultery.[3325] The Chinese code enumerates seven just causes of\r\ndivorce—barrenness, lasciviousness, inattention to parents-in-law,\r\nloquacity, thievishness, ill-temper, and inveterate infirmity,—and\r\na husband, except for one of these reasons, may not put away his\r\nwife on pain of receiving eighty blows.[3326] But these pretexts for\r\ndivorce are very elastic. In one of the old Chinese books we read,\r\n“When a woman has any quality that is not good, it is but just and\r\nreasonable to turn her out of doors.... Among the ancients a wife was\r\nturned away if she allowed the house to be full of smoke, or if she\r\nfrightened the dog with her disagreeable noise.”[3327] Nevertheless,\r\naccording to Mr. Medhurst, divorce is rare in China.[3328] In Japan\r\na man might repudiate his wife for the same reasons as in China.\r\nBut Professor Rein remarks that the Japanese seldom made use of\r\nthis privilege, especially if there were children, as education and\r\ncustom required that, in such cases, the wife should be treated with\r\nkindness and consideration.[3329] In Arabia, Mohammed regulated the\r\nlaw of divorce. “In the absence of serious reasons,” says Ibrâhîm\r\nHalebî, “no Mussulman can justify divorce in the eyes either of\r\nreligion or the law. If he abandon his wife or put her away from\r\nsimple caprice, he draws down upon himself the divine anger, for ‘the\r\ncurse of God,’ said the Prophet, 'rests on him who repudiates his wife\r\ncapriciously.’”[3330] Practically, however, a Mohammedan may, whenever\r\nhe pleases, without assigning any reason, say to his wife, “Thou art\r\ndivorced,” and she must return to her parents or friends.[3331]\r\n\r\nAccording to the ‘Laws of Manu,’ a wife “who drinks spirituous\r\nliquor, is of bad conduct, rebellious, diseased, mischievous, or\r\nwasteful, may at any time be superseded by another wife. A barren\r\nwife may be superseded in the eighth year; one whose children all\r\ndie, in the tenth; one who bears only daughters, in the eleventh; but\r\none who is quarrelsome, without delay.”[3332] At present, in Southern\r\nIndia, divorce is common among many of the lower castes; but it is\r\nnot practised at all among the Brahmans and Kshatriyas, or among the\r\nhigher classes of Śudras.[3333] In Rome under the Christian Emperors,\r\nthe husband’s right to put away his wife was restricted by imperial\r\nconstitutions, which pointed out what were considered just causes of\r\ndivorce.[3334] The dogma of the indissoluble nature of marriage, early\r\nvindicated by many Fathers in accordance with the injunction, “What\r\nGod hath joined together, let not man put asunder,” came into full\r\nforce only by degrees. The Council of Trent definitely suppressed the\r\nlast traces of divorce as a legal practice[3335]—a decree which has\r\nexercised a powerful influence on the legislation of Roman Catholic\r\nnations. In Spain, Portugal, and Italy, a husband can demand a judicial\r\nseparation, a divorce a _mensâ et thoro_, but the marriage contract\r\ncannot be dissolved; in France divorce was reintroduced by the law of\r\n27th July, 1884. In all Protestant countries divorce is allowed. In\r\nevery one of them a man may be divorced from a wife who has committed\r\nadultery, but the other legal grounds on which a divorce, in most\r\nof them, may be obtained, vary in different States. According to\r\nthe Prussian ‘Landrecht,’ the list includes, among other causes,\r\ndrunkenness and a disorderly life, insanity lasting longer than a\r\nyear, and the mutual consent of the husband and wife, if they have no\r\nchildren;[3336] in Norway and Denmark, mutual consent, if the parties\r\nhave been judicially separated for three years previously;[3337] in\r\nAustria, aversion proved to be invincible through several preceding\r\ndivorces from bed and board.[3338] The French law recognizes as causes\r\nof divorce, besides adultery, “excès, sévices, injures graves,” as\r\nalso “condamnation à une peine afflictive et infamante.”[3339]\r\n\r\nMarriage may be dissolved not only by the man but by the woman.\r\nIn Madagascar, says Mr. Sibree, although “the power of divorce is\r\nlegally in the husband’s hand, a wife can practically divorce herself\r\nin several cases.[3340] The like holds true for many of the lower\r\nraces;[3341] whilst, among others, custom or law seems to permit a\r\nwife to separate at least under certain conditions.[3342] Among the\r\nInland Columbians, according to Mr. Bancroft, “either party may\r\ndissolve the marriage at will.”[3343] If a Bonak wife gets up and\r\nleaves the man, he has no claim ever after on her.[3344] Among the\r\nNavajos, when a woman marries, “she becomes free, and may leave her\r\nhusband for sufficient cause.”[3345] Regarding the Guanas, Azara\r\nstates, “Le divorce est libre aux deux sexes, comme tout le reste, et\r\nles femmes y sont très-portées.”[3346] In the Sandwich Islands, “a man\r\nand woman live together as long as they please, and may, at any time,\r\nseparate, and make choice of other partners.”[3347] In Tahiti, parts\r\nof New Guinea, and in the Marianne Group, the marriage tie may, it is\r\nsaid, be dissolved whenever either of the parties desires it.[3348]\r\nIn some of the smaller islands of the Indian Archipelago, a wife can\r\nsue for divorce if her husband ill-treats her, if he is unfaithful, or\r\nfor other reasons.[3349] Among the Shans, “should the husband take\r\nto drinking, or otherwise misconducting himself, the woman has the\r\nright to turn him adrift, and to retain all the goods and money of the\r\npartnership.”[3350] In Burma, if one of the parties is unwilling to\r\nseparate, “the other is free to go, provided all property except the\r\nclothes in wear is left behind;” and a wife can demand a divorce for\r\nill-treatment, or if her husband cannot properly maintain her.[3351]\r\nAmong the Irulas of the Neilgherries, the option of remaining in union,\r\nor of separating, rests principally with the woman.[3352] According to\r\nKandh custom, a wife can return to her father’s house within six months\r\nafter the marriage, on the articles which had been paid for her being\r\nrestored; and, if childless, she can at any time quit her husband. “In\r\nno case,” says Sir W. W. Hunter, “can the husband forcibly reclaim\r\nher, but a wife separated on any grounds whatsoever from her husband\r\ncannot marry again.”[3353] In Eastern Central Africa, divorce may be\r\neffected if the husband neglects to sew his wife’s clothes, or if the\r\npartners do not please each other.[3354] And, among the Garenganze,\r\naccording to Mr. Arnot, a wife “may leave her husband at any time, if\r\nshe cares to do so.”[3355]\r\n\r\nPassing to more advanced nations, we find that, among the ancient\r\nMexicans, the wife, as well as the husband, might sue for\r\nseparation.[3356] In Guatemala, she could leave him on grounds as\r\nslight as those on which he could leave her.[3357] In China, on the\r\nother hand, a woman cannot obtain legal separation; and the same was\r\nthe case in Japan till the year 1873.[3358] According to the Talmudic\r\nLaw, the wife is authorized to demand a divorce if the husband refuses\r\nto perform his conjugal duty, if he continues to lead a disorderly\r\nlife after marriage, if he proves impotent during ten years, if he\r\nsuffers from an insupportable disease, or if he leaves the country\r\nfor ever.[3359] According to Mohammedan legislation, divorce may, in\r\ncertain cases, take place at the instance of the wife, and, if cruelly\r\ntreated or neglected by her husband, she has the right of demanding\r\na divorce by authority of justice.[3360] The ancient Hindus[3361]\r\nand Teutons[3362] allowed a wife to separate from her husband only\r\nin certain exceptional cases. According to Gallic laws, a wife could\r\nquit her husband without losing her _dos_, “si leprosus sit vir; si\r\nhabeat fetidum anhelatum, et si cum ea concumbere non possit.”[3363]\r\nAmong the Saxons and Danes in England, marriage might be dissolved\r\nat the pleasure of either party, the wife, however, being obliged to\r\nreturn the price paid for her, if she deserted the husband without\r\nhis consent.[3364] At Athens, a woman could demand a divorce if she\r\nwas ill-treated by her husband, in which case she had merely to\r\nannounce her wish before the ἄρχων.[3365] Rossbach thinks that, in\r\nRome, a marriage with _manus_ could be dissolved by the husband only,\r\na marriage without _manus_ by the wife’s father also.[3366] But Lord\r\nMackenzie observes that, whatever effect _conventio in manum_ may\r\nhave had in ancient times, it did not, in the age of Gaius, limit the\r\nwife’s freedom to seek divorce.[3367] In those Christian States of\r\nEurope where absolute divorce is permitted, the grounds on which it may\r\nbe sued for are nearly the same for the man and the woman—except in\r\nEngland, where the husband must be accused of one or other of several\r\noffences besides adultery. In Italy, Spain, and Portugal, a judicial\r\nseparation may always be decreed on the ground of the adultery of the\r\nwife, but, on the ground of the adultery of the husband, only if it has\r\nbeen committed under certain aggravating circumstances.[3368]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe causes by which duration of human marriage is influenced are, on\r\nthe whole, the same as those which determine the form of marriage.\r\n\r\nMan’s appetite for youth and beauty often induces him to repudiate\r\na wife who has grown old and ugly. According to Cook, it was much\r\nmore common for a Tahitian to cast off the first wife and take a more\r\nyouthful partner than to live with both.[3369] Among the Aleuts, when\r\na wife “ceases to possess attractions or value in the eyes of her\r\nproprietor, she is sent back to her friends.”[3370] A Malay, in many\r\ncases, turns away his wife as soon as she becomes ugly from hard work\r\nand maternal cares.[3371] In Switzerland, marriage is much oftener\r\ndissolved through divorce when the wife is the husband’s senior, than\r\nwhen the reverse is the case.[3372]\r\n\r\nDr. Béringer-Féraud observes that the Moors in the region of the\r\nSenegal “divorcent avec une facilité extrême, non seulement sous le\r\nprétexte le plus futile, mais souvent, et même uniquement, pour le\r\nplaisir de changer.”[3373] According to v. Oettingen, the statistics of\r\ndivorce and remarriage in Europe prove that the taste for variety is\r\noften the chief cause of the dissolution of marriage.[3374]\r\n\r\nAs the desire for offspring is a frequent cause of divorce,[3375]\r\nso the birth of children is generally the best guarantee for the\r\ncontinuance of the marriage tie. Speaking of some Indian tribes of\r\nNorth America, Schoolcraft says, “The best protection to married\r\nfemales arises from the ties of children, which, by bringing into play\r\nthe strong natural affections of the heart, appeal at once to that\r\nprinciple in man’s original organization which is the strongest.”[3376]\r\n\r\nWhere women are regarded almost as beasts of burden, it often happens\r\nthat a wife who is a bad worker is divorced. The Dyak husbands “coolly\r\ndismiss their helpmates when too lazy or too weak to work, and select\r\npartners better qualified to undergo the toils of life.”[3377] Among\r\nthe Sinhalese, according to Mr. Bailey, sickness is perhaps the\r\nmost common reason why a husband repudiates his wife. The heartless\r\ndesertion of a sick wife, he says, is “the worst trait in the Kandyan\r\ncharacter, and the cool and unconcerned manner in which they themselves\r\nallude to it, shows that it is as common as it is cruel.”[3378]\r\n\r\nHowever desirable separation, in many cases, may be for the husband,\r\nthere are various circumstances which tend to prevent him from\r\nrecklessly repudiating his wife. In many instances divorce implies for\r\nthe man a loss of fortune. Though not, as a rule,[3379] obliged to\r\nprovide the divorced wife with the full means of subsistence, he must,\r\nas already mentioned, usually give her what she brought with her into\r\nthe house, and, among several peoples, a certain proportion—often the\r\nhalf—of the common wealth.[3380] Among the Karens, if a man leaves\r\nhis wife, the rule is that the house and all the property belong to\r\nher, nothing being his but what he takes with him.[3381] Among the\r\nManipuris, according to Colonel Dalton, a wife who is put away without\r\nfault on her part, takes all the personal property of the husband,\r\nexcept one drinking cup and the cloth round his loins.[3382] Similar\r\nrules prevail among the Galela, and in the Marianne Group.[3383] As\r\nto the ancient Teutons, M. Glasson observes, “Les lois barbares\r\nvoulaient d’ailleurs que, sauf le cas d’adultère, la femme répudiée eût\r\nson existence assurée. Le mari devait lui laisser la maison et tout ce\r\nqu’elle contenait; il était même obligé de lui abandonner l’équivalent\r\ndu _mundium_ et de payer une amende au fisc s’il répudiait sa femme\r\nsans aucun motif sérieux.”[3384]\r\n\r\nThe practice of purchasing wives forms a very important obstacle\r\nto frequent repudiation.[3385] If the wife proves barren, or is\r\nunfaithful, or otherwise affords sufficient cause of divorce, the\r\nhusband generally receives back what he has paid for her;[3386] but,\r\nif he repudiates her without satisfactory grounds, the purchase sum\r\nis usually forfeited.[3387] “Cases of divorce are very frequent,”\r\nsays Mr. Casalis, “where the price of the wife is of small value.\r\nAmong the Basutos, where it is of considerable amount, the dissolution\r\nof marriage is attended with much difficulty.”[3388] And Dr. Finsch\r\nascribes the frequency of divorce in Ponapé to the fact that\r\nwife-purchase does not exist there.[3389]\r\n\r\nMoreover, when he divorces his wife, a man very often loses his\r\nchildren at the same time. Among several peoples they remain the\r\nproperty of the father.[3390] Among others, they are taken in some\r\ncases by the man, in others by the woman.[3391] In Samoa, the young\r\nchildren followed the mother, the more advanced the father;[3392]\r\nwhilst, among the Sinhalese, boys are taken by the latter, girls by the\r\nformer.[3393] But among many uncivilized peoples, all the children,\r\nif young, follow the mother,[3394] as Colden says, “according to the\r\nnatural course of all animals.”[3395]\r\n\r\nAnother factor which has much influence upon the stability of marriage,\r\nis the position held by women. When some regard is paid to their\r\nfeelings, a husband does not, of course, put his wife away for trivial\r\nreasons, divorce meaning for her, in many cases, misery and distress.\r\nDr. Churcher informs me from Morocco that “the divorced woman too\r\noften goes to swell the ranks of the prostitutes.” And the same is the\r\ncase in China and among the Arabs of the Sahara.[3396]\r\n\r\nWhen a man and woman unite with one another from love, there is, of\r\ncourse, more security that the marriage contract will be lasting. The\r\nMantras, says Father Bourien, “frequently marry without previously\r\nknowing one another, and live together without loving. Is it, then,\r\nastonishing that they part without regret, and that divorce is frequent\r\namong them?”[3397] The facility of Mohammedan divorce, as Mr. Bosworth\r\nSmith remarks, is the necessary consequence of the separation of the\r\nsexes. “A man would never embark in the hazardous lottery of Eastern\r\nmarriage, if he had not the escape of divorce from the woman whom he\r\nhas never seen, and who may be in every way uncongenial to him.”[3398]\r\nA union with a first cousin, among Mohammedans, is generally lasting,\r\nbecause early associations may have led to an attachment at a tender\r\nage.[3399] Separation is especially rare when the uniting passion is\r\nnot merely of a sensual nature, but involves mutual sympathy depending\r\nupon mental qualities.\r\n\r\nMany of the factors which influence the duration of marriage, so far as\r\nit depends upon the will of the husband, operate also in cases where\r\nmarriage may be dissolved by the wife. But the woman’s subordinate\r\nposition and her inability to support herself, makes separation more\r\ndifficult for her than for the man.[3400] Moreover, if the woman claims\r\na divorce, the purchase-sum paid for her has to be returned,[3401] and\r\nshe may even, in certain cases, forfeit her dowry and whatever property\r\nshe brought with her at marriage.[3402] If she must lose her children\r\nalso, she will naturally shrink from the idea of separation.\r\n\r\nSince the causes which influence the duration of marriage are, to\r\nso great an extent, the same as those which influence the form of\r\nmarriage, so far as monogamy and polygyny are concerned, we might\r\nexpect strict monogamy to be associated with stability of marriage,\r\nand extensive polygyny with instability. But this is only partly the\r\ncase. When monogamy is chiefly due to the man’s inability to support\r\nmany wives, or when he secures no economical advantage by a plurality\r\nof wives, he tries in many cases to make up for the inconveniences of\r\nmonogamy by a frequent change of mate. Mr. Bickmore thinks that the\r\nreason why polygyny is not more generally practised by the Mohammedan\r\nMalays is to be found in the facility with which divorce is obtained\r\nand a new marriage contracted.[3403] And the Arabs of Asia and the\r\nMoors of the Western Sahara, according to Burckhardt and Chavanne,\r\nindemnify themselves through a succession of wives for their monogamous\r\nhabits.[3404] Considering, further, that the proportion between the\r\nsexes, and the monogamous instinct which man in early times probably\r\nshared with others of the higher primates, have affected the forms\r\nof human marriage, but scarcely at all its duration, we may infer\r\nthat the development of the latter, at least at the lower stages of\r\ncivilization, has been somewhat different from that of the former.\r\n\r\nAs has already been pointed out, it is extremely probable that, among\r\nprimitive men, the union of the sexes lasted till after the birth of\r\nthe offspring. We have also perhaps some reason to believe that the\r\nconnection lasted for years. Lieutenant de Crespigny met Orang-utan\r\nfamilies consisting of male, female, and two young ones, and v.\r\nKoppenfels saw similar groups of the Gorilla; but whether the male\r\nwas the father of both the young ones, it is of course impossible to\r\ndecide. In any case, there is abundant evidence that marriage has, upon\r\nthe whole, become more durable in proportion as the human race has\r\nrisen to higher degrees of cultivation, and that a certain amount of\r\ncivilization is an essential condition of the formation of life-long\r\nunions.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that, at the early stage of development at which\r\nwomen first became valuable as labourers, a wife was united with\r\nher husband by a new bond more lasting than youth and beauty. The\r\ntie was strengthened by the bride-price and the marriage portion.\r\nAnd greater consideration for women, a higher development of the\r\npaternal feeling, better forethought for the children’s welfare, and\r\na more refined love-passion have gradually made it stronger, until\r\nit has become, in many cases, almost indissoluble. A husband in the\r\nmost advanced societies is no longer permitted to repudiate his wife\r\nwhenever he likes; a wife cannot, without more ado, divorce herself\r\nfrom her husband. Marriage has become a contract the keeping of which\r\nis superintended by the State, and which may be dissolved only under\r\ncertain stipulated conditions.\r\n\r\nAlthough there can be no doubt that the psychical causes which have\r\nstrengthened the marriage tie tend to become more potent, we must\r\nnot conclude that divorce will in future be less frequent and more\r\nrestricted by the laws than it is now in European countries. It must\r\nbe remembered that the laws of divorce in Christian Europe owe their\r\norigin to an idealistic religious commandment which, interpreted in its\r\nliteral sense, gave rise to legal prescriptions far from harmonizing\r\nwith the mental and social life of the mass of the people. The powerful\r\nauthority of the Roman Church was necessary to enforce the dogma that\r\nmarriage is indissoluble. The Reformation introduced somewhat greater\r\nliberty in this respect, and modern legislation has gone further in the\r\nsame direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\nOur investigation has now come to an end. The development of human\r\nmarriage in all its aspects has been examined, according to the method\r\nsuggested in the introductory chapter. Many of the conclusions are more\r\nor less hypothetical, but not a few, I think, are necessary deductions\r\nfrom trustworthy evidence. As they are based on a great accumulation of\r\nfacts, it may be well to present a general view of the argument as a\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nWe defined marriage as a more or less durable connection between\r\nmale and female, lasting beyond the mere act of propagation till\r\nafter the birth of the offspring. It is found among many of the lower\r\nanimals, it occurs as a rule among the anthropomorphous apes, and it\r\nis universal among mankind. It is closely connected with parental\r\nduties: the immediate care of the children belongs chiefly to the\r\nmother, whilst the father is the protector and guardian of the family.\r\nBeing a necessary requirement for the existence of certain species,\r\nit obviously owes its origin to an instinct developed through the\r\npowerful influence of natural selection. If, as seems probable, there\r\nwas a human pairing season in early times, the continued excitement of\r\nthe sexual instinct cannot have played a part in the origin of human\r\nmarriage—assuming that the institution existed among primitive men.\r\nAnd it is highly probable that it did exist, as the marriage of the\r\nPrimates seems to be due to the small number of young and the long\r\nperiod of infancy. Later on, when mankind became chiefly carnivorous,\r\nthe assistance of an adult male became still more necessary for the\r\nsubsistence of the children, as the chase everywhere devolves on the\r\nman. The suggestion that, in olden times, the natural guardian of the\r\nchildren was not the father, but the maternal uncle, has no foundation\r\nin fact; neither has the hypothesis that all the males of the tribe\r\nindiscriminately were their guardians. All the evidence we possess\r\ntends to show that among our earliest human ancestors the family, not\r\nthe tribe, formed the nucleus of every social group, and, in many\r\ncases, was itself perhaps the only social group. The man-like apes are\r\nnot gregarious, and the solitary life they generally lead is almost\r\ncertainly due chiefly to the difficulty they experience in getting\r\nsufficient quantities of food. We may infer that our fruit-eating human\r\nor half-human ancestors were not more gregarious than they. Afterwards,\r\nwhen man passed beyond his frugivorous stage, he continued, as a rule,\r\nthis solitary kind of life, as gregariousness is a disadvantage to all\r\nlarge animals who live chiefly on flesh. Even now there are savage\r\npeoples of the lowest type who live rather in separate families than in\r\ntribes, and facts indicate that the chief reason for this is want of\r\nsufficient food. The sociability of man, therefore, sprang in the main\r\nfrom progressive intellectual and material civilization, whilst the tie\r\nthat kept together husband and wife, parents and children, was, if not\r\nthe only, at least the principal factor in the earliest forms of man’s\r\nsocial life. Human marriage, in all probability, is an inheritance from\r\nsome ape-like progenitor.\r\n\r\nMost anthropologists who have written on prehistoric customs believe,\r\nindeed, that man lived originally in a state of promiscuity or\r\n“communal marriage”; but we have found that this hypothesis is\r\nessentially unscientific. The evidence given for it consists of notices\r\nof some savage nations said to live promiscuously, and of some curious\r\ncustoms which are assumed to be survivals from a time when marriage\r\ndid not exist. Many of the assertions made as to peoples living in\r\npromiscuous intercourse have, however, been shown to be erroneous, and\r\nthe accuracy of the others is at least open to question. But even if\r\nsome of the statements were true, it would be a mistake to infer that\r\nthese quite exceptional cases represent a stage of development through\r\nwhich all mankind have passed; and it is certainly not among the lowest\r\npeoples that sexual relations most nearly approach to promiscuity.\r\nEqually unwarranted is the inference of a primitive condition of\r\n“communal marriage” from the fact that in some parts of the world the\r\nsexes may cohabit freely before marriage. There are numerous savage\r\nand barbarous peoples among whom sexual intercourse out of wedlock is\r\nof rare occurrence, unchastity on the part of the woman being looked\r\nupon as a disgrace or a crime. Contact with a “higher culture” has\r\nproved pernicious to the morality of savage peoples; and we have some\r\nreason to believe that irregular connections between the sexes have, on\r\nthe whole, exhibited a tendency to increase along with the progress of\r\ncivilization. Moreover, free sexual intercourse previous to marriage\r\nis quite different from promiscuity, which involves a suppression of\r\nindividual inclinations. The most general form of it is prostitution,\r\nwhich is rare among peoples living in a state of nature, untouched\r\nby foreign influence. Customs which have been interpreted as acts of\r\nexpiation for individual marriage—a sort of religious prostitution\r\nfound in the East; the _jus primae noctis_ granted to the friends of\r\nthe bridegroom, or to all the guests at a marriage, or to a particular\r\nperson, a chief or a priest; and the practice of lending wives to\r\nvisitors—may be far more satisfactorily explained otherwise. This is\r\ntrue also of the fact that, among certain peoples, courtesans are held\r\nin greater estimation than women married to a single husband. Mr.\r\nMorgan’s view—that the former prevalence of “marriage in a group” and\r\npromiscuity are proved by the “classificatory system of relationship”\r\nin force among many peoples—presupposes that the nomenclature was\r\nfounded on blood-relationship, as near as the parentage of individuals\r\ncould be known. But it can scarcely be doubted that the terms for\r\nrelationships were originally mere terms of address, given chiefly\r\nwith reference to sex and age, as also to the external, or social,\r\nrelationship in which the speaker stood to the person whom he or she\r\naddressed. It has been suggested that the system of “kinship through\r\nfemales only”— implying, chiefly, that children are named after their\r\nmothers, not after their fathers, and that property and rank succeed\r\nexclusively in the female line—is due to the uncertain paternity which\r\nresulted from early promiscuity. But the ties of blood have exercised a\r\nfar less direct influence on this system than is generally assumed. We\r\nhave seen that there may be several reasons for naming children after\r\nthe mother rather than after the father, apart from any consideration\r\nof relationship. The custom in accordance with which, among many\r\npeoples, a man, on marrying, goes to live with his wife in the house of\r\nher father deserves special notice in this connection. It is probable\r\nthat the causes which make children take their mother’s name have also\r\ndirectly influenced the rules of succession, but the power of the name\r\nitself seems to have been of even higher importance. Moreover, so\r\nfar as we know, there is no general coincidence of what we consider\r\nmoral and immoral habits with the prevalence of the male and female\r\nline among existing savages; and among various peoples the male line\r\nprevails, although paternity is often actually uncertain on account of\r\ntheir polyandrous marriage customs. Avowed recognition of kinship in\r\nthe female line only, by no means implies an unconsciousness of male\r\nkinship. Finally, there are many rude peoples who exhibit no traces at\r\nall of a system of “kinship through females only.” Thus the facts put\r\nforward in support of the hypothesis of promiscuity do not entitle us\r\nto assume that promiscuity has ever been the prevailing form of sexual\r\nrelations even among a single people, whilst the hypothesis is opposed\r\nto all the correct ideas we are able to form with regard to the early\r\nstate of man. Promiscuous intercourse between the sexes tends to a\r\npathological condition very unfavourable to fecundity; and the almost\r\nuniversal prevalence of jealousy among peoples unaffected by foreign\r\ninfluence, as well as among the lower mammals, makes it most unlikely\r\nthat promiscuity ever prevailed at any stage of human development. As\r\nwe have seen, the idea that a woman belongs exclusively to one man\r\nis so deeply rooted among various peoples that it has led to several\r\nrevolting practices.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on ‘Marriage and Celibacy’ we noted that the single\r\nstate is comparatively rare among savage and barbarous races, who,\r\nas a rule, marry earlier than civilized men. A celibate is, indeed,\r\nlooked upon almost as an unnatural being. Very much the same was the\r\ncase with the ancient civilized nations both of the Old World and the\r\nNew, as is still the case in the East. In modern civilization, on\r\nthe other hand, there are several factors—partly economical, partly\r\npsychical—unfavourable to marriage. As a consequence, the proportion of\r\nunmarried people has been gradually increasing in Europe, and the age\r\nat which people marry has risen. A curious kind of celibacy, met with\r\namong various peoples at different stages, is the enforced celibacy of\r\npersons devoted to religion. This evidently depends upon the notion\r\nthat sexual intercourse is impure—a notion which seems to have grown\r\nup originally from the instinctive feeling against intercourse between\r\nmembers of the same family or household.\r\n\r\nIn the courtship of almost all animal species the male plays the most\r\nactive part, and has generally to fight with other males for the\r\npossession of the female. The same was no doubt the case with our early\r\nhuman ancestors, and this mode of courtship survives even now among\r\nsome of the lower races. Much more commonly, however, courtship means\r\non the part of the man a prolonged making of love; and the woman is far\r\nfrom being completely passive. We have seen how savage men and women in\r\nvarious ways endeavour to make themselves attractive to the opposite\r\nsex:—by ornamenting, mutilating, painting, and tattooing themselves.\r\nThat these practices essentially subserve this end appears chiefly from\r\nthe fact that the time selected for them is the age of puberty. It\r\nseems also probable that clothing, at least in a great many cases, was\r\noriginally adopted for a similar reason, and that the feeling of shame,\r\nfar from being the original cause of man’s covering his nakedness, is,\r\non the contrary, a result of this custom.\r\n\r\nWhilst the men are generally the courters, the women may in many,\r\nperhaps most, cases accept or refuse their proposals at pleasure.\r\nThough a daughter among the lower races is regarded as an object of\r\nproperty, and is in many instances betrothed in her earliest youth,\r\nwomen are not, as a rule, married without having any voice of their\r\nown in the matter. Among existing savages their liberty of selection\r\nis very considerable, and under more primitive conditions—when every\r\ngrown-up individual earned his or her own living, when there was,\r\nstrictly speaking, no labour, and when a daughter consequently was\r\nneither a slave nor an object of trade—woman was doubtless even more\r\nfree in that respect than she is now among most of the lower races.\r\nAt a latter stage the case was different. Among peoples who have\r\nreached a relatively high degree of civilization the father’s power,\r\nin connection with a more fully developed system of ancestor-worship,\r\nhas invariably become more extensive, more absolute. Not only the\r\nfull-grown daughter, but the full-grown son, who among savages enjoys\r\nperfect independence, stands so much in awe of the father that, among\r\nmany of these peoples, no marriage is concluded without his consent. We\r\nhave given some account of this strengthened paternal authority among\r\nvarious nations; we have found that it has formed only a transitional\r\nstage in the history of human institutions; and we have indicated the\r\nstages of its gradual decline.\r\n\r\nThe important subject of sexual selection has necessarily claimed a\r\ngood deal of attention. In an introductory chapter we pointed out the\r\ncontradiction between Mr. Darwin’s theories of natural and sexual\r\nselection, and endeavoured to show that the sexual selection of the\r\nlower animals is entirely subordinate to the great law of the survival\r\nof the fittest. From the way in which the sexual colours, odours, and\r\nsounds of animals are distributed among different species, we drew the\r\nconclusion that, though they are always to a certain extent hurtful to\r\nthe species, they are upon the whole advantageous, inasmuch as they\r\nmake it easier for the sexes to find each other; whereas if we accept\r\nMr. Darwin’s theory, we are compelled to suppose that the inexplicable\r\næsthetic sense on which his hypothesis is founded, has been developed\r\nin the way most dangerous to the species. We also found that there are\r\nfacts incompatible with Mr. Darwin’s explanation of the connection\r\nbetween love and beauty in mankind, and of the origin of the different\r\nhuman races. There is an ideal of beauty common to the whole human\r\nrace; but this ideal is a mere abstraction, as general similarities\r\nin taste are accompanied by specific differences. Men and women find\r\nbeauty in the full development of the visible characteristics belonging\r\nto the human organism in general; of those peculiar to the sex; of\r\nthose peculiar to the race. As a certain kind of constitution is best\r\nsuited for certain conditions of life, and the racial type is on the\r\nwhole that which best harmonizes with the external relations in which\r\nthe respective peoples live, we may infer that the full development\r\nof racial characters indicates health, that a deviation from them\r\nindicates disease. Physical beauty is therefore in every respect the\r\noutward manifestation of physical perfection, and the development of\r\nthe instinct which prefers beauty to ugliness, healthiness to disease,\r\nis evidently within the power of natural selection. According to Mr.\r\nDarwin, racial differences are due to the different standards of\r\nbeauty, whereas, according to the theory indicated in this book, the\r\ndifferent standards of beauty are due to racial differences. We have\r\nseen that the racial peculiarities stand in some connection with the\r\nexternal circumstances in which the various races live. But, as we\r\ndo not know that acquired characters are transmitted from parent to\r\noffspring, it is exceedingly doubtful whether the differences are the\r\ninherited effects of conditions of life to which previous generations\r\nhave been subject. It seems most probable that they are due to natural\r\nselection, which has preserved and intensified such congenital\r\nvariations as were most in accordance with the conditions under which\r\nthe various races lived.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of the ‘Law of Similarity’ we dealt with the powerful\r\ninstinct which, as a rule, keeps animals from pairing with individuals\r\nbelonging to another species, and found the origin of this aversion\r\nin the infertility of first crosses and hybrids. No such instinct can\r\nbe said to keep the various human races apart from one another; and\r\nit is not known that the diversities even between the races which\r\nleast resemble each other are not so great but that, under favourable\r\nconditions, a mixed race may be produced. Closely akin to the horror\r\nof bestiality is the horror of incest, which, almost without exception,\r\nis a characteristic of the races of men, though the degrees within\r\nwhich intercourse is forbidden vary in an extraordinary degree. It is\r\nnearly universally abominated between parents and children, generally\r\nbetween brothers and sisters, often between cousins, and, among a\r\ngreat many peoples uninfluenced by modern civilization, between all\r\nthe members of the tribe or clan. We criticized the theories set forth\r\nby various writers as to the origin of such prohibitions. To each of\r\nthese theories there are special objections; and all of them presuppose\r\nthat men avoid incestuous marriages only because they are taught to\r\ndo so. As a matter of fact, the home is kept pure from incestuous\r\nintercourse neither by laws, nor by customs, nor by education, but by\r\nan instinct which under normal circumstances makes sexual love between\r\nthe nearest kin a psychical impossibility. Of course there is no innate\r\naversion to marriage with near relations; but there is an innate\r\naversion to marriage between persons living very closely together from\r\nearly youth, and, as such persons are in most cases related, this\r\nfeeling displays itself chiefly as a horror of intercourse between\r\nnear kin. The existence of an innate aversion of this kind is proved,\r\nnot only by common experience, but by an abundance of ethnographical\r\nfacts which show that it is not in the first place by degrees of\r\nconsanguinity, but by close living together, that prohibitory laws\r\nagainst intermarriage are determined. Thus many peoples have a rule of\r\nlocal exogamy, which is quite independent of kinship. The extent to\r\nwhich, among various nations, relatives are not allowed to intermarry,\r\nis obviously nearly connected with their close living together. There\r\nis so strong a coincidence (as statistical data prove) between exogamy\r\nand the “classificatory system of relationship”—which system springs,\r\nto a great extent, from the close living together of considerable\r\nnumbers of kinsfolk—that they must, in fact, be regarded as two sides\r\nof one institution. Prohibitions of incest are very often more or\r\nless one-sided, applying more extensively either to the kinsfolk on\r\nthe father’s side or to those on the mother’s, according as descent\r\nis reckoned through men or women; and we have seen that the line of\r\ndescent is intimately connected with local relationships. In a large\r\nnumber of cases, however, prohibitions of intermarriage are only\r\nindirectly influenced by the close living together. Aversion to the\r\nintermarriage of persons who live in intimate connection with each\r\nother has provoked prohibitions of the intermarriage of relations; and,\r\nas kinship is traced by means of a system of names, the name comes to\r\nbe considered identical with relationship. Generally speaking, the\r\nfeeling that two persons are intimately connected in some way or other\r\nmay, through an association of ideas, give rise to the notion that\r\nintercourse between them is incestuous. There are exceptions to the\r\nrule that close living together inspires an aversion to intermarriage.\r\nBut most of the recorded instances of intermarriage of brother and\r\nsister refer to royal families, and are brought about simply by pride\r\nof birth. Incestuous unions may also take place on account of extreme\r\nisolation, and certain instances of such connection are evidently the\r\nresults of vitiated instincts. Marriage between a half-brother and a\r\nhalf-sister, however, is not necessarily contrary to the principle here\r\nlaid down, as polygyny breaks up each family into as many sub-families\r\nas there are wives who have children. The question arose:—Why is a\r\nfeeling of disgust associated with the idea of marriage between persons\r\nwho have lived in a long-continued, intimate relationship from a period\r\nof life at which the action of desire is naturally out of the question?\r\nWe found an answer in the evil effects resulting from consanguineous\r\nmarriages. It seems to be necessary for the welfare of the species\r\nthat the sexual elements which unite shall be somewhat different from,\r\nas it is necessary that they shall be in some way similar to, one\r\nanother. The injurious results of self-fertilization among plants and\r\nof close interbreeding among animals appear to prove the existence of\r\nsuch a law, and it is impossible to believe that it does not apply\r\nto man also. We stated several facts pointing in this direction,\r\nand found reason to believe that consanguineous marriages are much\r\nmore injurious in savage regions, where the struggle for existence\r\nis often very severe, than they have proved to be in civilized\r\nsociety. We also observed that no evidence which can stand the test of\r\nscientific investigation has hitherto been adduced against the view\r\nthat consanguineous marriages, in some way or other, are more or less\r\ndetrimental to the species. Through natural selection an instinct must\r\nhave been developed, powerful enough, as a rule, to prevent injurious\r\nunions. This instinct displays itself simply as an aversion on the part\r\nof individuals to union with others with whom they have lived, but as\r\nthese are for the most part blood-relations, the result is the survival\r\nof the fittest.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded to consider sexual selection as influenced by affection,\r\nsympathy, and calculation. We found that love has only slowly become\r\nthe refined feeling it is in the minds of cultivated persons in modern\r\ntimes, although conjugal affection is far from being unknown, even\r\namong very rude savages. The endogamous rules which prevent different\r\nraces, nations, or tribes, hereditary castes, classes, and adherents\r\nof different religions from intermarrying are due to want of sympathy,\r\nand have gradually lost their importance according as altruism and\r\nreligious toleration have increased, and civilization has diminished\r\nthe barriers which separate different nations and the various classes\r\nof society.\r\n\r\nAs regards the mode of contracting marriage, we inferred—from the\r\nuniversality of the horror of incest, and from the difficulty a savage\r\nman has in procuring a wife in a friendly manner without making up\r\nfor the loss he inflicts on her father—that marriage by capture must\r\nhave been very common at that stage of social development when family\r\nties had become stronger, and man lived in small groups of nearly\r\nrelated persons, but when the idea of barter had scarcely presented\r\nitself to his mind. We saw that marriage by capture was succeeded by\r\nmarriage by purchase, as barter in general has followed upon robbery.\r\nAgain, at a later stage, some feeling of shame was attached to the\r\nidea of selling a daughter, and marriage by purchase was abandoned.\r\nIts gradual disappearance took place in two different ways. On the one\r\nhand, the purchase became a symbol, appearing as a sham sale in the\r\nmarriage ceremonies or as an exchange of presents; on the other hand,\r\nthe purchase-sum was transformed into the morning gift and the dotal\r\nportion, a part—afterwards the whole—being given to the bride either\r\ndirectly by the bridegroom or by her father. These transformations\r\nof marriage by purchase have taken place, not only in the history of\r\nthe great civilized nations, but among several peoples who are still\r\nin a savage or semi-civilized state. As a rule, however, the marriage\r\nportion plays no important part in savage life, being chiefly due\r\nto a feeling of respect and sympathy for the weaker sex, which, on\r\nthe whole, is characteristic of a higher civilization. Very often it\r\nis intended to be a settlement for the wife in case the marriage be\r\ndissolved through the husband’s death or otherwise, although it may\r\nhave the meaning of a return gift, or it may imply that the wife as\r\nwell as the husband is expected to contribute to the expenses of the\r\njoint household.\r\n\r\nHaving noted the growth of marriage ceremonies and religious rites,\r\nwe passed to the forms of human marriage. Polygyny was permitted by\r\nmost of the ancient peoples within the historic period, and is at\r\npresent permitted by several civilized nations and by the majority\r\nof savage tribes. Yet, among not a few savage and barbarous races it\r\nis almost unknown, or even prohibited; and almost everywhere it is\r\nconfined to the smaller part of the people, the vast majority being\r\nmonogamous. Moreover, where polygyny occurs, it is modified, as a\r\nrule, in two ways that tend towards monogamy: through the higher\r\nposition granted to one of the wives, generally the first married,\r\nand through the favour constantly shown by the husband to the wife\r\nhe likes best. Among certain peoples polyandry occurs, and, like\r\npolygyny, is modified in a monogamous direction, the first husband\r\nusually being the chief husband. Among the causes by which the forms\r\nof marriage are influenced, the numerical proportion between the\r\nsexes plays an important part. In some countries there are more men\r\nthan women, in others more women than men. This disproportion is due\r\nto various causes, such as female infanticide, war, and disparity in\r\nthe number of the sexes at birth. There are facts which seem to show\r\nthat in rough mountainous countries more boys are born than girls,\r\nand that consanguineous marriages produce a considerable excess\r\nof male births. If this be so, it can hardly be a mere coincidence\r\nthat polyandry occurs chiefly among mountaineers and peoples who are\r\nendogamous in a very high degree. As for polygyny, there are several\r\nreasons why a man may desire to possess more than one wife. Among\r\nmany peoples the husband has to live apart from his wife during her\r\npregnancy, and as long as she suckles her child. Female youth and\r\nbeauty have for men a powerful attraction, and among peoples at the\r\nlower stages of civilization women generally become old much sooner\r\nthan in more advanced communities. The liking of men for variety is\r\nalso a potent factor; and to have many wives is to have many labourers.\r\nThe barrenness of a wife is another very common reason for the choice\r\nof a new partner, as desire for offspring, for various reasons, is\r\nuniversal in mankind. In a savage and barbarous state a man’s power and\r\nwealth are proportionate to the number of his offspring. Nevertheless,\r\nhowever desirable polygyny may be from the man’s point of view, it\r\nis prohibited among many peoples, and among most of the others it is\r\nexceptional. Where the amount of female labour is limited, and no\r\naccumulated property exists, it may be very difficult for a man to keep\r\na plurality of wives. Again, where female labour is of considerable\r\nvalue, the necessity of paying the purchase-sum for a wife is a\r\nhindrance to polygyny, which can be overcome only by the wealthier\r\nmen. Polygyny implies a violation of the feelings of women; hence,\r\nwhere due respect is paid to these, monogamy is considered the only\r\nproper form of marriage. The refined passion of love, which depends\r\nnot only on external attractions, but on sympathy arising from mental\r\nqualities, forms a tie between husband and wife which lasts for life;\r\nand the true monogamous instinct, the absorbing passion for one, is a\r\npowerful obstacle to polygynous habits. It is certain that polygyny\r\nhas been less prevalent at the lowest stages of civilization—where\r\nwars do not seriously disturb the proportion of the sexes; where life\r\nis chiefly supported by hunting, and female labour is consequently\r\nof slight value; where there is no accumulation of wealth and no\r\ndistinction of class—than it is at somewhat higher stages; and it seems\r\nprobable that monogamy prevailed almost exclusively among our earliest\r\nhuman ancestors. But, though civilization up to a certain point is\r\nfavourable to polygyny, its higher forms invariably and necessarily\r\nlead to monogamy. We have noted that polygyny has, in many ways, become\r\nless desirable for the civilized man than it was for his barbarian and\r\nsavage ancestors, and that other causes have co-operated to produce\r\nthe same result. Again, polyandry, being due to an excess of men and\r\npresupposing an abnormally feeble disposition to jealousy, must at\r\nall times have been exceptional; there is no solid evidence for the\r\ntheory that in early times it was the rule. On the contrary, this form\r\nof marriage seems to require a certain degree of civilization. It was\r\nprobably, in most cases, an expression of fraternal benevolence on the\r\npart of the eldest brother, and, if additional wives were afterwards\r\nacquired, it led to group marriages of the Toda type.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, human marriage is not necessarily contracted for\r\nlife, and among most uncivilized and many advanced peoples, a man\r\nmay divorce his wife whenever he likes. Nevertheless, divorce is an\r\nexception among a great many races, even among races of the lowest\r\ntype; and numerous nations consider, or have considered, marriage a\r\nunion which must not be dissolved by the husband, except for certain\r\nreasons stipulated by custom or law. We also noted instances in which\r\nthe wife may separate from her husband. The causes by which the\r\nduration of human marriage is influenced are, on the whole, but not\r\nexactly the same as those which determine the form of marriage; and,\r\nthough monogamy frequently coexists with great stability of marriage,\r\nthis is scarcely the case in the rudest condition of man. Marriage,\r\ngenerally speaking, has become more durable in proportion as the human\r\nrace has advanced.\r\n\r\nMarriage has thus been subject to evolution in various ways, though\r\nthe course of evolution has not been always the same. The dominant\r\ntendency of this process at its later stages has been the extension of\r\nthe wife’s rights. A wife is no longer the husband’s property; and,\r\naccording to modern ideas, marriage is, or should be, a contract on\r\nthe footing of perfect equality between the sexes. The history of\r\nhuman marriage is the history of a relation in which women have been\r\ngradually triumphing over the passions, the prejudices, and the selfish\r\ninterests of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORITIES QUOTED.[3405]\r\n\r\n\r\n Abercromby (John), ‘Marriage Customs of the Mordvins;’ in\r\n ‘Folk-Lore,’ vol. i.

A. R.  WALLACE_\r\n\r\n                     Third Edition. 8vo. 14s. net.\r\n\r\n\r\n           Some Opinions of the Press on the First Edition:—\r\n\r\n\r\n_Edward B. Tylor in_ =The Academy=, _October 3, 1891_.\r\n\r\n“A volume which at once takes an important place in the much debated\r\nproblem of primitive society.... The distinguishing character of\r\nDr. Westermarck’s whole treatise is his vigorous effort to work the\r\nbiology-side and the culture-side of anthropology into one connected\r\nsystem; and there can be no doubt of the value of the resulting\r\ndiscussions, which will develop further as the inquiry goes on in this\r\ndirection.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Spectator=, _February 13, 1892_.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Wallace’s eulogium of the author’s clearness of style and command\r\nof English will be echoed by every reader. But the book is much more\r\nthan a clever literary performance. It is by far the most important\r\ncontribution to our knowledge of a profoundly interesting chapter in\r\nhuman history that has yet appeared.... Not a page is without its\r\ninterest.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Athenæum=, _August 8, 1891_.\r\n\r\n“We are inclined to concur in Mr. Wallace’s opinion. It must be added\r\nthat the work is written in excellent English, that it deals with\r\ndelicate and difficult questions in a tone of faultless taste, that its\r\nstyle is clear and its matter exceedingly well arranged, and that it is\r\nreadable from beginning to end.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mind=, _October, 1891_.\r\n\r\n“The author’s equipment, logical as well as psychological, for his\r\ntask is of a very exceptional order.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Westminster Review=, _August, 1891_.\r\n\r\n“A very able volume on the subject of human marriage, which, in our\r\nopinion, is calculated to set the world thinking again with a view to\r\ncorrecting preconceived ideas.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Times=, _July 2, 1891_.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Westermarck brings to the treatment of his subject the\r\naccumulated results of very extensive study and the dialectical\r\nresources of a powerful and logical mind.... In this judgment (Mr.\r\nWallace’s) we fully concur.... Mr. Westermarck propounds views which\r\nare at once novel and ingenious, and supports them with great variety\r\nof illustrations and great cogency of reasoning.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Scotsman=, _July 6, 1891_.\r\n\r\n“Scientific precision has rarely been attained in a style more\r\nagreeable and elegant by any indigenous writer. Mr. Westermarck’s\r\nbook would have been deeply interesting even if it had been less well\r\nwritten.... The results of his erudition form a mountain of wealth.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=St. James’s Gazette=, _July 20, 1891_.\r\n\r\n“Of the value of his (the author’s) researches ... we cannot speak\r\ntoo highly. His book is in every way deserving of the high eulogy\r\npronounced on it by Mr. Wallace.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Manchester Guardian=, _July, 1891_.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Westermarck has established his position among the first of\r\nhistorical anthropologists, he has thrown light upon many of the\r\nunsolved mysteries in the history of the human race, and he has swept\r\nout of the way several theories which have hitherto blocked the path to\r\na right solution of the main question at issue.... The book affords a\r\nmodel for future investigators in this field. It is no small compliment\r\nto English anthropology that the author has chosen to write his book in\r\nEnglish.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Anti-Jacobin=, _July 18, 1891_.\r\n\r\n“Certainly the most valuable of recent contributions to the literature\r\nof a deeply interesting theme.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_From a leading article in_ =Liverpool Daily Post=, _July 24, 1891_.\r\n\r\n“There is every reason to suppose that this deeply interesting book\r\nwill find a host of readers even among those who are attracted by facts\r\nfor their own sake rather than for the theories that may be drawn from\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Guardian=, _November 11, 1891_.\r\n\r\n“Not only profoundly learned but delightfully readable.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Warrington Guardian=, _September 16, 1891_.\r\n\r\n“A monumental book.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=National Observer=, _August 1, 1891_.\r\n\r\n“An invaluable contribution to science, ... and we confidently\r\nrecommend Mr. Westermarck’s _History of Human Marriage_, not only to\r\nall anthropologists, but to all them that love good reading.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sussex Daily News=, _October 7, 1891_.\r\n\r\n“One of the most readable works in the whole range of scientific\r\nwriting.... A comparatively unknown student until the publication of\r\nthis work, Dr. Westermarck has now taken his position in the very\r\nfront rank of historical anthropologists. No library of any scientific\r\npretentions can dispense with the _History of Human Marriage_, and\r\nevery public library in the country should possess a copy.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Critic= (_New York_), _September, 12, 1891_.\r\n\r\n“A work of the first importance.... The excellence of expression\r\ncorresponds to the elevation of sentiment apparent throughout.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_L. Marillier, in_ =Revue générale des Sciences=, _September 15, 1892_.\r\n\r\n“Le livre de M. Westermarck est, sans contredit, l’une des meilleurs\r\nmonographies sociologiques qui aient été faites, et c’est à l’heure\r\nactuelle l’ouvrage le plus complet, le plus riche en informations que\r\nl’on possède sur cette question du mariage et celui où l’on trouve la\r\nplus sûre et la plus pénétrante critique.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_M. Boule, in_ =L’Anthropologie=, _November-December, 1892_.\r\n\r\n“Je ne connais pas un volume où plus de faits, plus de recherches,\r\nplus de science, soient accumulés.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_René de Kérallain, in_ =Revue générale du Droit, de la Législation et\r\nde la Jurisprudence=, _May-June, 1893_.\r\n\r\n“M. Westermarck s’est trouvé du coup écrire un livre qui s’est placé\r\nau premier rang du genre, qui a surpris ses contradicteurs et qui déjà\r\nfait autorité.... Selon nous, ce livre doit faire époque.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prof. Lujo Brentano, in_ =Zeitschrift für Social und\r\nWirthschaftsgeschichte=, 1893.\r\n\r\n“Ein Werk von erstaunlicher Gelehrsamkeit und ungewöhnlichem\r\nScharfsinn....

It must not be understood that a Melanesian regards\r\nall women who are not of his own division as, in fact, his wives, or\r\nconceives himself to have rights which he may exercise in regard to\r\nthose women of them who are unmarried; but the women who may be his\r\nwives by marriage and those who cannot possibly be so, stand in a\r\nwidely different relation to him.'\r\n\r\n[280] Curr, _loc. cit._ vol. i. p.  126.\r\n\r\n[281] _Ibid._, vol. i. p.  142.\r\n\r\n[282] Mathew, in ‘Jour.

Nowhere has this distortion appeared in an odder way\r\nthan in Professor Bernhöft’s pamphlet, entitled ‘Verwandtschaftsnamen\r\nund Eheformen der nordamerikanischen Volksstämme.’ The author, misled\r\nby the systems of nomenclature, asserts that even now group-marriages\r\nare extremely common (have ‘eine ungeheure Verbreitung’) not only\r\namong the Australians, but also throughout America and Africa,\r\nand in many parts of Asia (pp. 8, 16). In a paper of more recent\r\ndate (‘Altindische Familien-Organisation,’ in ‘Zeitschr. f. vgl.\r\nRechtswiss.,’ vol. ix. p. 7), however, Professor Bernhöft admits that\r\nthe actual practice has _mostly_ become different from that which\r\nthe terms indicate, and that the progress to individual marriage has\r\nalready often taken place.\r\n\r\n[504] Lubbock, _loc. cit._ pp. 196, _et seq._ Morgan, ‘Systems,’ p. 35\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n[505] Morgan, ‘Systems,’ p. 36, note.\r\n\r\n[506] ‘Das Mutterrecht.'\r\n\r\n[507] McLennan, _loc. cit._ p. 88.\r\n\r\n[508] See, besides the works of Bachofen and McLennan, Lubbock,\r\n_loc. cit._ pp. 151-156; Giraud-Teulon, _loc. cit._ ch. vii.-x.;\r\n_Idem_, ‘La Mère chez certains peuples de l’antiquité;’ Bastian,\r\n‘Rechtsverhältnisse,’ pp. 183, _et seq._; Lippert, ‘Die Geschichte\r\nder Familie,’ sec. i.; _Idem_, ‘Kulturgeschichte,’ vol. ii.\r\nch. ii.; Dargun, ‘Mutterrecht und Raubehe,’ pp. 2-9; Post,\r\n‘Geschlechtsgenossenschaft,’ pp. 93, _et seq._; _Idem_, ‘Der\r\nUrsprung des Rechts,’ pp. 37, _et seq._; _Idem_, ‘Baustiene,’ vol.\r\ni. pp. 77, _et seq._; Starcke, ‘The Primitive Family,’ sec. i. ch.\r\ni.-v.; Wilken, in ‘De Indische Gids,’ 1881, vol. li. pp. 244-254;\r\nFriedrichs, ‘Ueber den Ursprung des Matriarchats,’ in ‘Zeitschr. f.\r\nvgl.

Anthr. Inst.,’ vol. vi. p. 400. Short hair is often regarded\r\nas a symbol of chastity. Every Buddhist ‘novice’—that is, a person\r\nadmitted to the first degree of monkhood—has to cut off his hair, in\r\norder to prove that ‘he is ready to give up the most beautiful and\r\nhighly-prized of all his ornaments for the sake of a religious life’\r\n(Monier Williams, ‘Buddhism,’ p. 306); and, in Mexico, the religious\r\nvirgins, as also men who decided upon a life of chastity, had their\r\nhair cut (Acosta, _loc. cit._ vol. ii. p. 333; Bancroft, _loc. cit._\r\nvol. ii. pp. 251, _et seq._). A similar idea probably underlies the\r\ncustom which requires that women, when they marry, shall be deprived\r\nof their hair, the husband trying in this way to preserve the fidelity\r\nof his wife (see Wilkes, _loc. cit._ vol. iii. p. 354; Waitz-Gerland,\r\n_loc. cit._ vol. vi. p. 567; Palmer, in ‘Jour. Anthr. Inst.,’ vol.\r\nxiii. p. 286; de Rubruquis, _loc. cit._ p. 32; Heriot, _loc. cit._\r\np. 335); whilst many men in New Guinea and Bornu deprive their wives\r\nof all ornaments (‘Ymer,’ vol. vi. p. 154; Barth, ‘Reisen,’ vol.\r\niii. p. 31, note). Even at Sparta and Athens, as well as among the\r\nAnglo-Saxons, the bride or newly-married wife had her hair cut short\r\n(Rossbach, _loc. cit._ p. 290). Mr. Wright suggests (‘Womankind in\r\nWestern Europe,’ p. 68) that, among the people last mentioned, this was\r\ndone in order to show that she had accepted a position of servitude\r\ntowards her husband, as the cutting of hair in either sex indicated\r\nslavery. But that this explanation cannot be applied to every case of\r\nhair-cutting appears from the fact, reported by Heriot (_loc. cit._ p.\r\n333), that, among the Tlascalans, it was customary to shave the head\r\nof a newly-married couple, both man and woman, ‘to denote that all\r\nyouthful sports ought in that state to be abandoned.'\r\n\r\n[1044] Sparrman, ‘Voyage to the Cape of Good Hope,’ vol. ii. p. 80.\r\n\r\n[1045] Bonwick, ‘Daily Life of the Tasmanians,’ pp. 25, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[1046] v.

Herr Joest, who\r\nis an experienced ethnographer, has come to the same conclusion as\r\nmyself regarding the origin of this practice. He says that ‘der\r\nhauptsächliche Trieb, welcher beide Geschlechter bewegt, sich zu\r\ntätowiren, _der_ ist, ihre Reize in den Augen des andern Geschlechts\r\nzu erhöhen’ (p. 56). He also observes:—‘Je weniger sich ein Mensch\r\nbekleidet, desto mehr tätowirt er sich, und je mehr er sich bekleidet,\r\ndesto weniger thut er letzteres’ (pp. 56, _et seq._).\r\n\r\n[1086] Mr. Walker observes (‘Beauty,’ p. 41) that ‘an essential\r\ncondition of all excitement and action in animal bodies, is a greater\r\nor less degree of novelty in the objects impressing them.'\r\n\r\n[1087] Waitz, ‘Introduction to Anthropology,’ p. 305.\r\n\r\n[1088] Dobrizhoffer, _loc. cit._ vol. ii. p. 15.\r\n\r\n[1089] Schweinfurth, ‘Im Herzen von Afrika,’ vol. ii. pp. 7, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[1090] Barth, ‘Reisen,’ vol. ii. p. 475.\r\n\r\n[1091] Franklin, ‘Second Expedition,’ p. 197 (_cf._ Mackenzie, _loc.\r\ncit._ p. 126).

Ich habe sehr häufig bemerkt, dass ein\r\nKleid irgend einer Dame, welches nicht nach der allgemeinen Mode\r\ngeschnitten war, mir stärker auffiel als mir der gänzliche Mangel an\r\nBekleidung der Eingeborenen der tropischen Inseln aufgefallen ist; dazu\r\nkommt noch, dass die Leute dem Beobachter durchaus keine Veranlassung\r\ngeben, an etwas unschickliches zu denken.

In the second edition, Mr. Huth\r\nseems to have given up this most unfortunate hypothesis, as he says (p.\r\n18) that ‘the prohibition of marriage with those who were regarded\r\nas near of kin was derived from the same causes which made exogamy\r\nimperative,’ that is, the causes suggested by Mr. Spencer.\r\n\r\n[1886] Lubbock, ‘The Origin of Civilisation,’ pp. 135, _et seq_.\r\nProfessor Wilken (in ‘De Indische Gids,’ 1880, vol. ii. p. 612)\r\naccepts this explanation of the origin of exogamy, and considers\r\nit certain (_ibid._, pp. 618, 619, 623) that prohibitions of close\r\nintermarriage have everywhere originated in true exogamy.\r\n\r\n[1887] McLennan, ‘Studies,’ &c., p. 345.

As. Soc. Japan,’ vol. xiii. p.\r\n121), ancient Mexicans (Waitz, _loc. cit._ vol. iv. p. 132). In this\r\nconnection should also be noticed the ‘lucky days,’ when matrimony\r\nin general is concluded under the best auspices. In China, these are\r\nespecially marked in the almanacks (Montgomery, _loc. cit._ vol.\r\nii. p. 268). The spring season and the last month in the year are\r\nregarded as the most fortunate nuptial periods in that country (Wells\r\nWilliams, vol. i. p.  791), whereas the ninth month is considered very\r\nunpropitious (Gray, _loc. cit._ vol. i. p.  187). Among the Bedouins\r\nof Mount Sinai (Burckhardt, _loc. cit._ p. 152), the Egyptians (Lane,\r\n_loc. cit._ vol. i. pp. 222, _et seq._), and the Mohammedan negroes of\r\nSenegambia (Reade, _loc. cit._ p. 453), Friday is esteemed the most\r\nfortunate day for marriage; while the Copts generally marry on the\r\nnight preceding Sunday (Lane, vol. ii. p. 331). In India, the month\r\nPhalguna was considered the luckiest period (v. Bohlen, _loc. cit._\r\nvol. ii. p. 148), and in Morocco, as I am informed by Dr. Churcher,\r\nthe month called Moolood (birth of Mohammed). Again, in Thuringia,\r\nmarriages are generally contracted at the time of the full moon\r\n(Schmidt, ‘Sitten und Gebräuche in Thüringen,’ p. 28); whilst in\r\nOrkney and Esthonia, no couple would consent to marry except at the\r\ntime of the crescent moon. The same superstition prevailed among the\r\nancient Hindus, Greeks, and Germans (v. Schroeder, _loc. cit._ p. 50).\r\nIn Scotland, formerly, nearly all avoided contracting marriage in\r\nMay, and the Lowlanders were disinclined to marry on Friday (Rogers,\r\n_loc. cit._ p. 112). The Romans considered May and the first half of\r\nJune an unlucky period (Rossbach, _loc. cit._ p. 265). In Egypt, it\r\nis a common belief that, if any one make a marriage contract in the\r\nmonth of Moharram, the marriage will be unhappy and soon dissolved,\r\nhence few persons do so (Lane, vol. i. p.  219, note *).

Mr. Jacobs\r\nthinks that English Jews marry their first cousins to the extent of 7·5\r\nper cent. of all marriages, against a proportion of about 2 per cent.\r\nfor England generally, as calculated by Professor G. H.  Darwin. M.\r\nStieda, in his ‘Eheschliessungen in Elsass-Lothringen’ (1872-1876),\r\ngives the proportion of consanguineous marriages among Jews as 23·02\r\nper thousand, against 1·86 for Protestants, and 9·97 for Catholics\r\n(Jacobs, ‘Studies in Jewish Statistics,’ p. 53).\r\n\r\n[3028] According to Mr. Jacob’s comprehensive manuscript collection\r\nof Jewish statistics, which he has kindly allowed me to examine, the\r\naverage proportion of male and female Jewish births registered in\r\nvarious countries is 114·50 males to 100 females, whilst the average\r\nproportion among the non-Jewish population of the corresponding\r\ncountries is 105·25 males to 100 females. But Mr. Jacobs thinks that\r\nthe accuracy of these statistics may be called in question, as the\r\nabnormal figures for Austria (128 to 100, in the years 1861-1870)\r\nand Russia (129 to 100, in the years 1867-1870), when compared with\r\nthose for Posen (108 to 100, in the years 1819-1873) and Prussia (108\r\nto 100, in the years 1875-1881), render it likely that some uniform\r\nerror occurs in the registration of Jewish female children in Eastern\r\nEurope. It has also been suggested that less care is taken in the\r\nregistration of females among poor Jews. Moreover, still-born children\r\nare not included in the rates of births, and this certainly affects the\r\nfigures as to sex, because, parturition being more difficult in the\r\ncase of males than in that of females, there are not so many still-born\r\nfemales as still-born males (v. Oettingen, _loc. cit._ p. 57). E. Nagel\r\nattributes the excess of male births among Jews to the greater care\r\nwhich Jewish wives take of their health during pregnancy, as also to\r\nthe smaller number of illegitimate births. But Mr. Jacobs believes that\r\nthe ratio of male births is greater among Jews than among non-Jewish\r\nEuropeans, even if we take this objection into account.\r\n\r\n[3029] Brehm, ‘Bird-Life,’ p. 270.
