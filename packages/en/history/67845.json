PEOPLE FROM THE EARLIEST PERIOD TO\r\nTHE ADVENT OF THE REFORMATION IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n  Prefatory—Territorial Divisions of Ireland—Physical Features of the\r\n          Country—Peculiarities of Soil, Climate, and Scenery\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT famous English Republican, Thomas Paine—whose political pamphlets\r\nhave been admired quite as much as his theological works have been\r\ncensured—uttered in “Common Sense,” published in 1776, while he was\r\nserving under Washington in the Continental Army, this striking\r\naphorism: “Europe, and not England, is the parent country of America.”\r\nHis object was to stimulate the patriotic pride of such American\r\ncolonists—and they were many—as were not of English birth or descent,\r\nand to proclaim that the other great branches of the human race, settled\r\nin America, must, of necessity, have a vital interest in the successful\r\nissue of the War for Independence. No other great country of the world\r\nhas a population made up of so many divers “previous nationalities,” all\r\ncombined into one gigantic political whole, as the United States of\r\nAmerica. Most of the notable nations of the Old World are here\r\nrepresented not by hundreds or thousands, but by millions of citizens,\r\n“racy of the soil,” and proud to call themselves Americans. A French\r\npatriot once said, speaking in the Chamber of Deputies: “There is no\r\nFrench race. France is a grand political entity which all true\r\nFrenchmen, of whatever race, worship.” This fine sentiment can be even\r\nmore logically applied to America and Americans, for both are still in\r\nthe formative period. Several centuries hence, perhaps, a race of people\r\ndistinctively American in all respects may occupy this country, but\r\nwhile the great stream of European immigration continues to flow toward\r\nthe setting sun there can not exist such a racial condition in this\r\nRepublic, except in those remote districts in which the immigrant rarely\r\nseeks a home.\r\n\r\nMost Americans have read something of the political misfortunes of\r\nIreland, but very many among us have not made her history even a partial\r\nstudy, and have often taken their views of it, at second hand, from\r\nsources that could not fail to be partial and, therefore, prejudicial.\r\nWe do not need to apologize for seeking to throw more light, in a simple\r\nyet comprehensive manner, on the history of that beautiful island the\r\nblood of whose exiled children flows in the veins of not less than\r\n20,000,000 of the American people. The Irish race owes much to America,\r\nand America, in turn, owes much to it. Truly has it been said of the\r\nAmerican Irish that they were with the Republic at its birth, guarded\r\nits infancy, rejoiced in its growth and prosperity, and will endure with\r\nit until the end, which comes, in the fulness of time, to even the\r\ngreatest among nations. Thomas Francis Meagher (Mä’her or Marr)—the\r\nyoung Irish patriot and orator of 1848, and afterward a famous Union\r\ngeneral of the Civil War—in one of the brilliant speeches he delivered\r\nin this country, said: “When, in 1849, I was a political captive on\r\nboard an English battleship, I beheld, one bright morning, through the\r\nporthole of my cabin, while we were anchored in an Australian harbor,\r\nthe Stars and Stripes floating from the mast of a stately American\r\nfrigate and hailed Liberty at my prison-gate!” And this is the sentiment\r\nof every honest immigrant who seeks the shelter of our flag.\r\n\r\nIreland, called poetically, because of its perennial verdure, the\r\nEmerald Isle, lies in the Atlantic Ocean, immediately westward of the\r\nlarger island of Great Britain, from which it is separated by, in most\r\nparts, a wide and deep strait, varying in width from 14 miles, where the\r\nheadlands of Antrim approach the western coast of Scotland, to about 125\r\nmiles, which is the maximum distance from the coast of England. This\r\nstrait is called, running from north to south consecutively, the North\r\nChannel, the Irish Sea, and St. George’s Channel. The high shore of\r\nScotland is always visible, in clear weather, from the northeast coast\r\nof Ireland, and the mountains of Wales, about 65 miles distant, may be\r\nseen, under similar conditions, from Bray Head and other points on the\r\nLeinster coast, but no part of England can be seen at any time from the\r\nIrish shore. Ireland, considered geographically, is of an irregular\r\nrhomboidal shape, by some writers compared to an oblong shield, and is\r\nsituated between Latitude 51° 26´ and 55° 21´ North, and Longitude 5°\r\n21´ and 10° 26´ West, projecting farther into the Atlantic Ocean, to the\r\nwestward, than any other portion of European soil. Its total area,\r\nincluding many small islands close to the coast, is about 32,500 square\r\nmiles, or 19,000 less than England, 2,000 more than Scotland, 25,000\r\nmore than Wales, and nearly 2,000 less than our inland State of Indiana.\r\nIreland would make, almost to a fraction, thirty-two States the size of\r\nRhode Island, which has a Legislature of its own—a privilege the Green\r\nIsle does not, at present, enjoy.\r\n\r\nThe island is divided into four provinces—in ancient times it had five;\r\nnamely, Leinster in the east, Ulster in the north, Connaught in the\r\nwest, and Munster in the south. These are, again, divided into\r\ntwo-and-thirty counties—a system of Anglo-Norman, or English, invention,\r\nand, according to the learned Doctor Joyce, savant and historian, they\r\ngenerally represent the older native territories and sub-kingdoms. King\r\nJohn, “Lord” of Ireland, formed twelve of them in the twelfth\r\ncentury—Dublin, Kildare, Meath, Uriel (or Louth), Carlow, Kilkenny,\r\nWexford, Waterford, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, and Tipperary. Henry VIII\r\ndivided Meath proper into two counties and called one Westmeath. King’s\r\nand Queen’s Counties were formed in the reign of Mary I, who married\r\nPhilip II of Spain, out of the old districts of Leix and Offaly. Hence\r\ntheir capitals are called, respectively, Philipstown and Maryborough.\r\nThe county Longford was formed out of the territory of Annaly, by Deputy\r\nSir Henry Sydney, about 1565. The same official divided Connaught into\r\nsix counties—Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Roscommon, Leitrim, and Clare. The\r\nlatter county, although situated on the Connaught bank of the river\r\nShannon, was subsequently given to Munster, because it had formed a part\r\nof that province in ancient times. Antrim and Down were organized into\r\ncounties early in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and Lord Deputy Perrott,\r\nabout 1584, formed seven others out of Ulster; namely, Armagh, Monaghan,\r\nTyrone, Coleraine (now Derry), Donegal, Fermanagh, and Cavan. Dublin\r\nCounty, at first, included Wicklow, but, in 1605, during the reign of\r\nJames I, Sir Arthur Chichester made the latter a separate county.\r\n\r\nThe existing division of the counties among the provinces is as follows:\r\nMunster comprises Clare, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary, and\r\nWaterford; Ulster contains Antrim, Armagh, Cavan, Donegal, Down,\r\nFermanagh, Derry, Monaghan, and Tyrone; Connaught has Galway, Leitrim,\r\nMayo, Roscommon, and Sligo; Leinster comprises Carlow, Dublin, Kildare,\r\nKilkenny, King’s County, Longford, Louth, Meath, Queen’s County,\r\nWestmeath, Wexford, and Wicklow.\r\n\r\nThe reader ought to know, however, that a majority of the Ulster and\r\nConnaught counties, and some in Leinster and Munster, did not recognize\r\ntheir English designations, or yield to English law, in any shape, until\r\nafter the accession of James I to the British throne, in 1603. They were\r\ngoverned by their own princes, chiefs, and judges, under the old Brehon\r\nlaw, until “the Peace of Mellifont” in that year.\r\n\r\nWhile the Irish counties differ very materially in extent, the provinces\r\nshow the following proportions: Munster, 6,064,579 acres; Ulster,\r\n5,475,458; Leinster, 4,871,118; Connaught, 4,392,043. The island is\r\nfurther subdivided into 316 baronies, 2,532 parishes, and 60,760\r\ntownlands, which average about 300 acres each. These are figures with\r\nwhich every student of Irish history should be familiar.\r\n\r\nThe country is, in general, very fertile, and grows cereals luxuriantly.\r\nThe green crops, such as turnips, parsnips, cabbages, and kindred\r\nvegetables, are unexcelled. Its grazing capacity is very great, and\r\nIrish horses, homed cattle, sheep, and swine are among the choicest in\r\nEurope. Apples, pears, plums, and the smaller fruits grow abundantly in\r\nthe mild, moist climate, but the Irish sun will not ripen peaches,\r\ngrapes, or tomatoes, unless they are under glass. Poultry thrive\r\nwondrously, and there is a large exportation of fowl and eggs to the\r\nBritish markets. Irish butter ranks high also. Yet the country is poor,\r\nchiefly because of the scarcity of manufactures, and for other reasons\r\nthat will be explained as we proceed.\r\n\r\nThe Irish climate is equable, but, in general, damp, when compared with\r\nthat of America. Neither summer heat nor winter cold produces\r\ndiscomfort, except at very rare intervals. Violent storms are\r\ninfrequent, except along the western coast, and electrical disturbances\r\nare much rarer than in our atmosphere. Only one cyclonic storm, that of\r\nJanuary 6, 1839, visited Ireland during the nineteenth century, and it\r\nis known to this day as “the Big Wind.”\r\n\r\nIrish scenery is peculiar in character—soft, yet bold of outline, as\r\nregards its mountain regions. The cliffs on the Connaught, Ulster, and\r\nMunster coasts are tall and beetling—those of Moher, in Clare, and those\r\nthat flank the Giants’ Causeway—a remarkable basaltic formation in\r\nAntrim—being the most notable. All the elevations that rise above a\r\nthousand feet are clothed with the heather, which is also peculiar to\r\nScotland, and this plant changes its hue with every season so that there\r\nis a constant shifting of color, which adds much to the charm of the\r\nlandscape. The Irish sky, too, is changeful, so much so that an Irish\r\npoet, in paying tribute to the beauty of his wife, wrote:\r\n\r\n           “Eyes like the skies of dear Erin, our mother,\r\n            Where shadow and sunshine are chasing each other!”\r\n\r\nSnow generally disappears from the summits of the Irish mountains about\r\nthe second week of May. The mildness of the climate in a latitude so far\r\ntoward the north is due to the powerful influence of the warm Gulf\r\nStream, and this also explains the verdure of the country at almost all\r\nperiods of the year. A striking characteristic of the Irish mountains is\r\nthat they, in general, rise abruptly from the plain, which gives them an\r\nappearance of greater altitude than they really possess; the highest\r\npeak in the island—that of Carn Tual in Kerry—being only a trifle over\r\n3,400 feet. There is still another peculiarity of the Irish mountain\r\nsystem which strikes all tourists—the highland chains, for the most\r\npart, rise near the coast, and follow its course, thus making it one of\r\nthe boldest and grandest in Europe, while some detached groups, such as\r\nthe Galtee and Slieve Bloom ranges in Munster and Leinster, the Curlews\r\nin Connaught and Slieve Snacht (Snowy range) in Ulster, seem to be\r\nindependent formations.\r\n\r\nThe Irish lakes are numerous and, in general, picturesque. Lough Neagh\r\n(Nay) in the north, Lough Corrib in the west, and Lough Dearg—an expanse\r\nof the Shannon—are the largest, but the most famed for scenery are those\r\nof Killarney in Kerry, Lough Dan in Wicklow, and Lough Gill in Sligo.\r\nThe Irish rivers are many, and, in the main, beautiful streams. The\r\nShannon is the greatest river in the realm of Great Britain and Ireland,\r\nwhile the Suir, the Barrow, the Nore, the Slaney, the Corrib, the Erne,\r\nthe Foyle, the Boyne, and the Liffey are also considerable rivers and\r\npossess enough waterpower, were it scientifically utilized, to turn the\r\nwheels of the world’s machinery. The Munster Blackwater, celebrated,\r\nlike its sister river, the Suir, in the charming poetry of Edmund\r\nSpenser, is called, because of its peculiar loveliness, “the Irish\r\nRhine.” After a winding and picturesque course through the south of\r\nMunster, it falls into the ocean at Youghal—a town of which the famous\r\nSir Walter Raleigh, of Queen Elizabeth’s Court, was once mayor.\r\n\r\nOne-seventh of the surface of Ireland is computed to be under\r\nbogs—semi-spongy formations, claimed by some naturalists to be the\r\ndecomposed relics of mighty forests with which Ireland was covered in\r\nremote ages. The aspect of these “moors,” as they are called by the\r\nBritish, is dreary enough in winter, but at other periods they have\r\ntheir charms; the heather and mosses with which they are, in many\r\nplaces, thickly clothed, changing hue, as on the mountains, with every\r\nseason. Nearly all of these bogs are capable of being reclaimed for\r\nagricultural uses, but the people do not desire their reclamation, for\r\nthe reason that they furnish cheap fuel to most of the rural districts,\r\nwhere there is neither coal nor timber supply. Owing to the mildness of\r\nthe climate, the cut and dried sods of “peat,” called “turf,” which\r\nresemble brown bricks, take the place of coal and wood, and make quite a\r\ncomfortable fire. “Stone turf,” produced by artificial pressure, and an\r\nextra drying process, makes almost as hot a fire as anthracite, but is\r\nmuch dearer than the ordinary article, which is softer and lighter.\r\nIndeed, the common Irish turf would be almost useless in our fierce\r\nwinter weather. These fuel “reservoirs” can not be exhausted for ages to\r\ncome. It is claimed that, by some mysterious process of nature, they\r\nrenew themselves from time to time, after they have been “given a rest”\r\nby the turf-cutters. Many large bogs occupy the summits and sides of the\r\nmountains, and seem to be of the same character as those on the level\r\nland. Occasionally the high morasses shift their positions, like\r\nglaciers, only with a much quicker movement, and overwhelm, like the\r\navalanche, everything in their path. These are called “the moving bogs.”\r\nThe last phenomenon of the kind occurred in the County Kerry a few years\r\nago, when much property was destroyed and several lives were lost.\r\nScientists claim that these bogs are undermined by bodies of water,\r\nwhich, when flooded, lift the crust and carry it with them, in their\r\neffort to find their natural level. It is well known in Ireland that\r\nseveral small, but deep, lakes now occupy places that were formerly\r\ncovered by these strange formations. We will devote a separate chapter\r\nto other features of this interesting country.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n Further of the Characteristics and Resources of the Island—Present Form\r\n                              of Government\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLD, silver, copper, lead, iron, and other malleable minerals are found\r\nin Ireland. The gold is discovered in small quantities, at least in\r\nmodern times, but the beautiful ornaments, composed of that precious\r\nmetal, and much used by the ancient Irish nobility, preserved in the\r\nMuseum of the Royal Irish Academy, Dublin, and elsewhere in Ireland and\r\nGreat Britain, would indicate that it was at one time plentiful in the\r\nisland. Silver is found in paying quantities in several districts, and\r\nsilver mines are now in operation in the northern portion of Munster.\r\nThe lead, copper, and iron deposits have never been seriously worked,\r\nand, therefore, it is impossible to arrive at any satisfactory estimate\r\nof their extent. Coal is found in many counties, but the most extensive\r\nfields are in Ulster. Much light is thrown on this subject by Kane’s\r\n“Resources of Ireland,” which can be found, most likely, in the public\r\nlibraries. It gives most interesting statistics, but they would be far\r\ntoo heavy for our more condensed narrative.\r\n\r\nIreland possesses over seventy harbors. Fourteen are of the first class\r\nand can shelter the very largest sea-going vessels, whether naval or\r\nmercantile. Unhappily, excepting those of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, and\r\nBelfast, they are comparatively little used for commerce, for reasons\r\nthat will present themselves in succeeding chapters.\r\n\r\nAlthough in olden times a thickly wooded country, Ireland of to-day is\r\nrather bare of forests. There are numerous luxuriant groves and\r\nwoodlands, and many of the highroads are bordered with stately trees.\r\nThe “quick-set hedges,” planted with thorn shrubs, give, particularly in\r\nsummer, a well-furnished appearance to the country, except in a few\r\nrather barren districts, where stone walls, as in portions of New\r\nEngland, are quite common. Irish farms are nearly all divided and\r\nsubdivided by these formidable fences, quick-set or stone, so that, when\r\nviewed from any considerable height, the surrounding country looks like\r\na huge, irregular checker-board—a much more picturesque arrangement of\r\nthe landscape than our American barbed-wire obstructions, but at the\r\ncost of a vast amount of good land, in the aggregate.\r\n\r\nThe island contains many populous, finely built cities, well governed\r\nunder local municipal rule. Dublin, the capital, contains, including\r\nsuburbs, about 300,000 people, and is considered a very handsome\r\nmetropolis. It is surrounded by enchanting hamlets, and the sea-bathing\r\nresorts in the neighborhood are delightful. Belfast, the great\r\ncommercial city of Ulster, is almost as populous as Dublin, and has many\r\nof the thrifty characteristics of an American municipality. Cork,\r\nWaterford, Limerick, Galway, Sligo, Londonderry, and Drogheda are still\r\nplaces of much importance, although some of them have greatly declined,\r\nboth in wealth and population, during the last century.\r\n\r\nOwing to persistent agitation, and some fierce uprisings, which caused\r\nthe imperial government to listen to the voice of reason, the social and\r\npolitical conditions of the Irish people have been somewhat improved of\r\nlate years. The Irish Church was disestablished by the Gladstone\r\nMinistry, in 1869, and, under the leadership of Isaac Butt, Parnell,\r\nDavitt, and other Irish patriots, Protestant as well as Catholic, the\r\nharsh land laws have been greatly modified, and the Irish people have a\r\nbetter “hold on their soil,” and are much less subject to the capricious\r\nwill of their landlords than formerly. They are, also, much better\r\nlodged and fed than in the last generation, and education, of a\r\npractical kind, has become almost universal. The national school system\r\nhas many features in common with our own, and is improving year by year.\r\nIn the higher branches of education, Ireland is well supplied. Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin, the Alma Mater of many celebrated men, has existed\r\nsince the reign of Queen Elizabeth, but, until the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, was not open to Catholics. Maynooth College, in Kildare, is the\r\ngreat Catholic ecclesiastical seminary of Ireland, and there is also a\r\nCatholic university in Dublin. Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, and other\r\ncities have Catholic colleges, and there are Protestant seats of\r\nlearning in Ulster and other provinces. Cork, Belfast, and Galway have\r\neach branch universities, called “Queen’s Colleges,” which are conducted\r\non a non-sectarian basis. These are only a few of Ireland’s educational\r\ninstitutions, but they serve to illustrate the agreeable fact that a\r\ndearth of opportunity for acquiring learning is no longer a reproach to\r\nthe Irish people, or, rather, to their English law-makers. The taxes\r\nwhich support the institutions maintained by Government are paid by\r\nIreland into the Imperial Treasury, so that Great Britain is not\r\nburdened by them, as many suppose. Recently, a commission appointed by\r\nthe British Parliament to inquire into the financial relations between\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland reported back that the latter country was\r\novertaxed annually to the amount of $15,000,000. This grievance,\r\nalthough complained of by all classes, has not yet been redressed.\r\nDublin, Belfast, and other leading Irish cities possess very choice and\r\nextensive libraries. That of Trinity College, in the first-mentioned\r\ncity, is considered one of the best in Europe, and it is particularly\r\nrich in ancient Irish manuscripts, some of which have been translated\r\nfrom the original Gaelic into English by the late Dr. John O’Donovan,\r\nProfessor Eugene O’Curry, and other Irish savants. There are many large\r\ncirculating libraries in all the principal municipalities, and most of\r\nthe smaller towns. These are patronized, in the main, by poor people of\r\nliterary taste, who can not afford satisfactory libraries of their own.\r\nThere is now a revival of Irish literature in Great Britain as well as\r\nin Ireland itself. Many English and Scotch firms have taken to printing\r\nIrish prose and poetry in the English tongue, so that Irish authors are\r\nno longer confined, as they were, with a few exceptions, of old, to an\r\ninsular constituency. Irish literary work of merit, when not strongly\r\npatriotic, sells readily in Great Britain to-day. This is due, partly,\r\nto a growing appreciation of Irish talent among the more liberal classes\r\nof the English people, and still more, perhaps, to the very large Irish\r\npopulation that has developed itself on the soil of “the predominant\r\npartner” within the last half of the nineteenth century. There is a\r\nstrong Chartist, or republican, element in England friendly to the Irish\r\nclaim of legislative independence, and this element, which we hear\r\ncomparatively little of in America, for reasons it is not necessary to\r\ndiscuss in this history, is growing more powerful as time rolls by, and\r\nsome day, not very distant, perhaps, is bound to greatly modify the\r\nexisting governmental system of the British Empire, and render it more\r\npopular.\r\n\r\nIreland is very rich in monastic and martial ruins. The round towers\r\nwhich sentinel the island are declared by many antiquaries to antedate\r\nthe Christian period, and are supposed to have been pagan temples\r\ndedicated to the worship of the sun, which, some historians claim, was\r\nIreland’s chief form of the Druidic belief.\r\n\r\n      “The names of their founders have vanished in the gloom,\r\n       Like the dry branch in the fire, or the body in the tomb,\r\n       But to-day, in the ray, their shadows still they cast—\r\n       These temples of forgotten gods, these relics of the past.”\r\n\r\nThe grass-grown circular raths, or “forts,” as the peasantry call them,\r\nvarying greatly in diameter, are supposed to be remnants of the Danish\r\ninvasion, but many archæologists place them at a much earlier date, and\r\ngive them not a Danish but a Danaan origin—the latter tribe being\r\nclaimed as among the first settlers of Ireland. The largest “fort” or\r\n“dun” in the island is that near Downpatrick, which is sixty feet high\r\nand three-quarters of a mile in circumference. Much of the stately\r\narchitecture seen in the ruins of abbeys, churches, and chapels belongs\r\nto the Anglo-Norman period, as does also the military architecture,\r\nwhich survives in such types as the keeps of Limerick, Nenagh, and Trim;\r\nbut the Celtic type of church construction is preserved, after the lapse\r\nof more than a thousand years, in its primitive purity, at Glendalough\r\nin Wicklow, Clonmacnois in King’s County, and Cong in Galway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  (_Click on the map to see a larger version._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThree hundred years of warfare with the pagan Danes, and five hundred\r\nwith the Anglo-Normans and Anglo-Saxons, made Ireland the Island of\r\nRuins, as well as the Island of Saints and Scholars.\r\n\r\nBefore January 1, 1801, Ireland was a distinct and separate kingdom,\r\nhaving a Parliament of her own and connected with Great Britain by what\r\nhas been called “the golden link of the crown.” How that Parliament was,\r\nunfortunately for all concerned, abolished will appear in its proper\r\norder. Since 1801 Ireland has been governed by the Imperial Parliament,\r\nsitting in London, composed of representatives from England, Scotland,\r\nIreland, and Wales—670 in all, of whom 103 are Irish members. Of these\r\nlatter, 82 are Nationalists, or Repealers of the Act of Union, while 21\r\nare Unionists, or adherents of the present political connection. The\r\npreponderating vote of Great Britain hopelessly overwhelms the Irish\r\nrepresentation, and hence the work of reform, as far as Ireland is\r\nconcerned, is slow and difficult. The executive functions are intrusted\r\nto a Lord Lieutenant, who is appointed by each succeeding Ministry, to\r\nrepresent the monarch of Great Britain. He is assisted in his duties by\r\na Chief Secretary, two Under Secretaries, a Lord Chancellor, a Lord\r\nChief Justice, a Master of the Rolls, a Chief Baron of the Exchequer,\r\nmany less prominent officers, and a Privy Council, which comprises\r\nseveral of the officials mentioned, together with the leading supporters\r\nof the crown in the capital and throughout the country. Some of the\r\nofficial members of this Council are not natives of Ireland; and the\r\nLord Lieutenant himself is almost invariably an English or Scotch\r\naristocrat of high rank and liberal fortune. No Catholic can fill the\r\noffice of Viceroy of Ireland. The authority of the latter is, to all\r\nintents and purposes, absolute. In seasons of political agitation, even\r\nwhen there is no violence, he can suspend the ordinary law without\r\nhaving recourse to Parliament. This power has been frequently exercised\r\neven in this generation. The Lord Lieutenant’s official residence is\r\nDublin Castle, but he has also a commodious viceregal lodge in the\r\nPhœnix Park. His salary is $100,000 per annum—just twice that of our\r\nPresident—but, in general, he spends much more out of his private\r\nfortune, as he is, nearly always, chosen for his wealth as much as for\r\nhis rank. When he goes among the people, he is, almost invariably,\r\nattended by a strong cavalry escort and a dashing staff of\r\naides-de-camp, glittering in silver, steel, and gold. The military\r\ngarrison of Dublin is strong, not often under 10,000 men, and at the\r\nCurragh Camp, about twenty miles distant, in Kildare, there is a much\r\nlarger force. Most of the large towns are also heavily garrisoned. Thus,\r\nafter an occupation, either nominal or actual, of seven and one-third\r\ncenturies, England still finds it expedient to govern Ireland as a\r\nmilitary district—a sad commentary on the chronic misgovernment of ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                  The Original Inhabitants of Ireland\r\n\r\n\r\nVAGUE poetical tradition flings a mystical veil over the origin of the\r\nearliest inhabitants of Ireland. The historian, McGee, who would seem to\r\nhave made a serious study of the subject, says that the first account\r\ngiven by the bards and the professional story-tellers attributes the\r\nsettlement of the island to Parthalon of the race of Japhet, who, with a\r\nnumber of followers, reached it by way of the Mediterranean and\r\nAtlantic, “about three hundred years after the Universal Deluge.” The\r\ncolonists, because of the unnatural crimes of their leader, were, we are\r\ntold, “cut off to the last man by a dreadful pestilence.”\r\n\r\nThe second colony, also a creature of tradition, was said to have been\r\nled by a chief called Nemedh from the shores of the Black Sea across\r\nMuscovy to the Baltic, and from that sea they made their way to the\r\nIrish shore. In Ireland, they encountered a stronger race, said to have\r\nbeen of African origin, called Formorians, with whom they had many\r\nsevere battles and were by them finally defeated and either killed or\r\ndriven from the country, to which some of their descendants returned in\r\nafter years.\r\n\r\nAfter Nemedh came the Firbolgs, or Belgæ, under the five sons of their\r\nking, Dela, who divided the island into five parts and held it\r\nundisputedly until the Tuatha de Danaans, said to be descended from\r\nNemedh, and having magical power to quell storms, invaded the island,\r\ncarrying with them the “lia fail,” or “Stone of Destiny,” from which\r\nIreland derived its fanciful title of “Innis fail,” or the “Island of\r\nDestiny.” The Danaans are said to have been of the Greek family. In any\r\ncase, it is claimed, they subdued the Belgæ and made them their serfs.\r\nThey ruled mightily, for a time, but, in turn, were compelled to give\r\nway to a stronger tide of invasion.\r\n\r\nThis was formed by a people who called themselves, according to most\r\nIrish annalists, Gaels, from an ancient ancestor; Milesians, from the\r\nappellation of their king, who ruled in distant Spain, and Scoti, or\r\nScots, from Scota, the warlike mother of King Milesius. These Milesians\r\nare said to have come into Spain from the region of the Caucasus, and\r\nall agree that they were formidable warriors. Tradition says that\r\nIreland was first discovered, as far as the Milesians were concerned, by\r\nIth, uncle of the Spanish king, who, while on a voyage of exploration,\r\nsighted the island, and, attracted by its beauty, landed, but was\r\nattacked by the Danaans and mortally wounded. His followers carried him\r\nto his galley, and he died at sea, but the body was brought back to\r\nSpain. His son, Loci, who had accompanied Ith, summoned all the Milesian\r\nfamily to avenge their kinsman’s death and conquer the Promised Island\r\nof their race. Milesius, or Miledh, had expired before Loci’s return,\r\nbut his sons, Heber the Fair, Amergin, Heber the Brown, Colpa, Ir, and\r\nHeremon rallied to the call of vengeance and conquest, set sail for\r\nIreland, landed there, and, in spite of Danaan witchcraft and Firbolgian\r\nvalor, beat down all opposition and became masters of the beautiful\r\nisland. Thomas Moore, in his immortal Irish Melodies, thus deals with\r\nthis legendary event:\r\n\r\n              “They came from a land beyond the sea,\r\n                 And now o’er the Western main,\r\n               Set sail in their good ships gallantly\r\n                 From the sunny land of Spain.\r\n               ‘Oh, where’s the isle we’ve seen in dreams,\r\n                 Our destined home or grave?’\r\n               Thus sang they as, by the morning’s beams,\r\n                 They swept the Atlantic wave.\r\n\r\n              “And, lo, where afar o’er ocean shines\r\n                 A sparkle of radiant green,\r\n               As though in that deep lay emerald mines\r\n                 Whose light through the wave was seen.\r\n              ‘’Tis Innisfail! ’tis Innisfail!’\r\n                 Rings o’er the echoing sea,\r\n               While bending to heaven the warriors hail\r\n                 That home of the brave and free.\r\n\r\n              “Then turned they unto the Eastern wave,\r\n                 Where now their Day-God’s eye\r\n               A look of such sunny omen gave\r\n                 As lighted up sea and sky,\r\n               Nor frown was seen through sky or sea,\r\n                 Nor tear on leaf or sod,\r\n               When first on their Isle of Destiny\r\n                 Our great forefathers trod.”\r\n\r\nThe migration of those Celto-Iberians to Ireland is generally placed at\r\nfrom 1500 to 2000 years before the birth of Christ; but there is not\r\nmuch certainty about the date; it stands wholly on tradition. On one\r\npoint, at least, a majority of Irish annalists seem to be agreed—namely,\r\nthat the Milesians were of Celtic stock and Scythian origin, but the\r\nroute they took from Scythia to Spain, as well as the date of their\r\nexodus, remains an undetermined question. Celtic characteristics, both\r\nmental and physical, are still deeply stamped on the Irish people,\r\nnotwithstanding the large admixture of the blood of other races,\r\nresulting from the numerous after invasions, both pagan and Christian.\r\nThomas Davis, the leading Irish national poet of the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century, sums up the elements that constitute the present\r\nIrish population, truly and tersely, thus:\r\n\r\n                   “Here came the brown Phœnician,\r\n                      The man of trade and toil;\r\n                    Here came the proud Milesian\r\n                      A-hungering for spoil;\r\n                    And the Firbolg, and the Kymry,\r\n                      And the hard, enduring Dane,\r\n                    And the iron lords of Normandy,\r\n                      With the Saxons in their train.\r\n\r\n                    And, oh, it were a gallant deed\r\n                      To show before mankind,\r\n                    How every race, and every creed,\r\n                      Might be by love combined;\r\n                    Might be combined, yet not forget\r\n                      The fountains whence they rose,\r\n                    As filled by many a rivulet\r\n                      The stately Shannon flows!”\r\n\r\nAnd the fine verses of the Irish poet may be applied with almost equal\r\npropriety to the cosmopolitan population of the United States—more\r\nvaried in race than even that of Ireland. No good citizen is less of an\r\nAmerican simply because he scorns to forget, or to allow his children to\r\nforget, “the fountains whence they rose.” Anglo-Americans never forget\r\nit, nor do Franco-Americans, or Americans of Teutonic origin; or, in\r\nfact, Americans of any noted race. Americans of Irish birth or origin\r\nhave quite as good a right to be proud of their cradle-land and their\r\nancient ancestry as any other element in this Republic; and the study of\r\nimpartial Irish history by pupils of all races would do much to soften\r\nprejudices and remove unpleasant impressions that slanderous, partial\r\nhistorians have been mainly instrumental in creating.\r\n\r\nThe language—Gaelic, or Erse, as it is called in our day—spoken by the\r\nMilesian conquerors of Ireland so many thousand years ago, is not yet\r\nnearly extinct on Irish soil; and it is often used by Irish emigrants in\r\nvarious parts of the world. More than thirty centuries have faded into\r\neternity since first its soft, yet powerful, accents were heard on\r\nIreland’s shore, but still nearly a million people out of four and a\r\nhalf millions speak it, and hundreds of thousands have more or less\r\nknowledge of the venerable tongue in its written form. Great efforts\r\nhave been put forth of late years to promote its propagation throughout\r\nthe island, and it is a labor of love in which all classes, creeds, and\r\nparties in Ireland cordially work together. It is not intended, of\r\ncourse, to supplant the English language, but to render Gaelic co-equal\r\nwith it, as in Wales—a thoroughly Celtic country, in which the native\r\nlanguage—Kymric—has been wondrously revived during the past and present\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n The Religion of Ancient Ireland—Many Writers say it was Worship of the\r\n                        Sun, Moon, and Elements\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have mentioned that sun-worship was one of the forms of ancient Irish\r\npaganism. There is much difference of opinion on this point, and the\r\nlate learned Gaelic expert, Professor Eugene O’Curry, holds that there\r\nis no reliable proof of either sun-worship or fire-worship in antique\r\nIrish annals. On the other hand, we have the excellent historian, Abbé\r\nMcGeoghegan, chaplain of the famous Franco-Irish Brigade of the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, supported by other authorities,\r\ninstancing the sun as, at least, one of the objects of Irish pagan\r\nadoration. Other writers, including the painstaking McGee, seem to\r\naccept the startling assertion that human victims were occasionally\r\nsacrificed on the pagan altars. This, however, is open to doubt, as the\r\nIrish people, however intense in their religious convictions, have never\r\nbeen deliberately cruel or murderously fanatical. We quote on these\r\nsensitive subjects—particularly sensitive where churchmen are\r\nconcerned—from McGeoghegan and McGee, both strong, yet liberal, Catholic\r\nhistorians. On page 63 of his elaborate and admirable “History of\r\nIreland,” McGeoghegan remarks: “Great honors were paid to the Druids and\r\nBards among the Milesians, as well as to those among the Britons and\r\nGauls. The first, called Draoi in their language, performed the duties\r\nof priest, philosopher, legislator, and judge. Cæsar has given, in his\r\nCommentaries, a well-detailed account of the order, office,\r\njurisdiction, and doctrine of the Druids among the Gauls. As priests,\r\nthey regulated religion and its worship; according to their will, the\r\nobjects of it were determined, and the ‘divinity’ often changed; to\r\nthem, likewise, the education of youth was intrusted. Guided by the\r\nDruids, the Milesians generally adored Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Apollo,\r\nthe sun, moon, and wind; they had also their mountain, forest, and river\r\ngods. These divinities were common to them and to other nations of the\r\nworld.... According to the Annals of Ulster, cited by Ware, the\r\nantiquarian, the usual oath of Laegore (Leary) II, King of Ireland, in\r\nthe time of St. Patrick, was by the sun and wind.”\r\n\r\nMcGee, writing of the same subject, on pages 5 and 9 of his “Popular\r\nHistory of Ireland,” says: “The chief officers about the kings, in the\r\nfirst ages, were all filled by the Druids or pagan priests; the Brehons,\r\nor judges, were usually Druids, as were also the Bards, the historians\r\nof their patrons. Then came the Physicians, the Chiefs who paid tribute\r\nto or received annual gifts from the sovereign, the royal Stewards, and\r\nthe military leaders, or Champions.... Their religion in pagan times was\r\nwhat the moderns call Druidism, but what they called it themselves we\r\nnow know not. It was probably the same religion anciently professed by\r\nTyre and Sidon, by Carthage and her colonies in Spain; the same religion\r\nwhich the Romans have described as existing in great part of Gaul, and,\r\nby their accounts, we learn the awful fact that it sanctioned, nay,\r\ndemanded, human sacrifices. From the few traces of its doctrines which\r\nChristian zeal has permitted to survive in the old Irish language, we\r\nsee that Belus or Crom, the god of fire, typified by the sun, was its\r\nchief divinity—that two great festivals were held in his honor on days\r\nanswering to the first of May and last of October. There were also\r\nparticular gods of poets, champions, artificers, and mariners, just as\r\namong the Romans and Greeks. Sacred groves were dedicated to these gods;\r\npriests and priestesses devoted their lives to their service; the arms\r\nof the champion and the person of the king were charmed by them; neither\r\npeace nor war was made without their sanction; their own persons and\r\ntheir pupils were held sacred; the high place at the king’s right hand\r\nand the best fruits of the earth and the water were theirs. Old age\r\nrevered them, women worshiped them, warriors paid court to them, youth\r\ntrembled before them, princes and chiefs regarded them as elder\r\nbrethren. So numerous were they in Erin, and so celebrated, that the\r\naltars of Britain and Western Gaul, left desolate by the Roman legions,\r\nwere often served by hierophants from Ireland, which, even in those\r\npagan days, was known to all the Druidic countries as the Sacred\r\nIsland.”\r\n\r\nThe two greatest battles fought in Ireland during the early Milesian\r\nperiod were that near Tralee, in Kerry, where the Milesian queen-mother,\r\nScota, perished, and the conflict at Taltean, in Meath, where the three\r\nDanaan kings, with their wives and warriors, were slain. After these\r\nevents, Heber and Heremon divided Ireland between them, but eventually\r\nquarreled. A battle ensued, in which Heber fell, and Heremon was\r\nthereafter, for many years, undisputed monarch of all Ireland. A large\r\nmajority of the Celtic families of the island are descended from the two\r\nroyal brothers and bitter rivals. Their most famous Milesian successors\r\nin pagan times were Tuathal (Too-hal), the Legitimate, who formed the\r\nroyal province of Meath, which existed for many ages, and is now\r\nrepresented, but on a much smaller scale, by the modern counties of\r\nMeath and Westmeath. The province itself was dismembered centuries ago,\r\nand, since then, Ireland has had but four provincial divisions instead\r\nof five. Tuathal is also credited with having originated the Borumah\r\n(Boru) or “Cow Tribute,” which he imposed on Leinster as a penalty for a\r\ncrime committed against two of his daughters by the king of that\r\nprovince. This tribute was foredoomed to be a curse to the Irish nation\r\nat large, and its forceful imposition by successive Ard-Righs caused\r\ntorrents of blood to be shed. It was abolished toward the end of the\r\nseventh century by the Christian king of all Ireland, Finacta II,\r\nsurnamed the Hospitable. “Conn of the Hundred Battles” made a record as\r\na ruler and a warrior. Cormac MacArt, because of his great wisdom, was\r\ncalled the Lycurgus of Ireland. Niall of the Nine Hostages—ancestor of\r\nthe O’Neills—was a formidable monarch, who carried the terror of his\r\narms far beyond the seas of Ireland. His nephew, King Dathi (Dahy) was\r\nalso a royal rover, and, while making war in northern Italy, was killed\r\nby a thunderbolt in an alpine pass. Dathi was the last king of pagan\r\nIreland, but not the last pagan king. His successor, Leary, son of the\r\ngreat Niall, received and protected St. Patrick, but never became a\r\nChristian. After Leary’s death, no pagan monarch sat on the Irish\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nAncient Ireland was known by several names. The Greeks called it Iernis\r\nand Ierni; said to have meant “Sacred Isle”; the Romans Hibernia, the\r\nderivation and meaning of which are involved in doubt, and the Milesians\r\nInnisfail, said to mean “the Island of Destiny,” and Eire, or Erinn, now\r\ngenerally spelled Erin, said to signify “the Land of the West.” Many\r\nlearned writers dispute these translations, while others support them.\r\nWithin the last six centuries, the island has been known as Ireland,\r\nsaid to signify West, or Western, land, but, as the savants differ about\r\nthis translation also, we will refrain from positive assertion.\r\n\r\nThe Roman legions never trod on Irish soil, although they conquered and\r\noccupied the neighboring island of Britain, except on the extreme north,\r\nduring four hundred years. Why the Romans did not attempt the conquest\r\nof the island is a mystery. That they were able to conquer it can hardly\r\nbe doubted. Strange as the statement may seem to some, it was\r\nunfortunate for Ireland that the Romans did not invade and subdue it.\r\nHad they landed and prevailed, their great governing and organizing\r\ngenius would have destroyed the disintegrating Gaelic tribal system,\r\nwhich ultimately proved the curse and bane of the Irish people. They\r\nwould also have trained a nation naturally warlike in the art of arms,\r\nin which the Romans had no superiors and few peers. With Roman training\r\nin war and government, the Irish would have become invincible on their\r\nown soil, after the inevitable withdrawal of the Legions from the\r\nisland, and the Anglo-Normans, centuries afterward, could not have\r\nachieved even their partial subjection.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n   Advent of St. Patrick—His Wonderful Apostolic Career in Ireland—A\r\n     Captive and a Swineherd for Years, he Escapes and becomes the\r\n                    Regenerator of the Irish Nation\r\n\r\n\r\nA MAJORITY of learned historians claim that Christianity was introduced\r\ninto Ireland by Catholic missionaries from the continent of Europe long\r\nbefore the advent of the accepted national apostle, St. Patrick, who, in\r\nhis boyhood, was captured on the northern coast of Ireland, while\r\nengaged in a predatory expedition with the Gauls, or some other foreign\r\nadventurers. In regard to this period of the future apostle’s career, we\r\nare mainly guided by tradition, as the saint left no memoirs that would\r\nthrow light on his first Irish experience. Such expeditions were not\r\nuncommon in the age in which he lived, nor were they for ages that\r\nfollowed. It seems certain that his captors offered him no bodily harm,\r\nand he was sent to herd swine amid the hills of Down. This inspired boy,\r\ndestined to be one of the greatest among men and the saints of God,\r\nremained a prisoner in the hands of the pagan Irish—whom he found to be\r\na generous, and naturally devotional, people—for many years, and thus\r\nacquired a thorough knowledge of their laws, language, and character.\r\nWhether he was finally released by them, or managed to escape, is a\r\nquestion of some dispute, but it is certain that he made his way back to\r\nGaul—now known as France—which, according to many accounts, was his\r\nnative land, although Scotland claims him also, and thence proceeded to\r\nRome, where, having been ordained a priest, he obtained audience of Pope\r\nCelestine, and was by him encouraged and commissioned to convert the\r\ndistant Irish nation to Christianity. Filled with a holy zeal, Patrick\r\nrepaired as rapidly as possible to his field of labor, and, after\r\nsuffering many checks and rude repulses, at last, about the year 432,\r\nfound himself back in Ulster, where he fearlessly preached the Gospel to\r\nthose among whom he had formerly lived as a serf, with miraculous\r\nsuccess. Afterward, he proceeded to the royal province of Meath, and on\r\nthe storied hill of Slane, “over against” that of Tara, where the Irish\r\nmonarch, Leary, was holding court, lighted the sacred fire in defiance\r\nof the edict of the Druid high-priest, who worshiped the fires of Baal\r\nand forbade all others to be kindled, and, by its quenchless flame,\r\nflung the sacred symbol of the Cross against the midnight skies of pagan\r\nIreland. The pagan king summoned the daring apostle to his presence, and\r\nasked him concerning his sacred mission. Patrick explained it, and,\r\nhaving obtained the royal consent, proceeded to preach with an eloquence\r\nthat dazzled king, princes, chiefs, and warriors. He even captivated\r\nsome of the Druid priests, but the high-priest, who dreaded the\r\napostle’s power of words, would have stopped him at the outset, had not\r\nKing Leary extended to him his favor and protection, although he himself\r\nremained a pagan to the end of his life. The saint, having made a deep\r\nimpression and converted many of high and low degree, took to baptizing\r\nthe multitude, and tradition says that the beautiful river Boyne was the\r\nJordan of Ireland’s great apostle. It was while preaching at Tara that\r\nSt. Patrick’s presentation of the mystery of the Blessed Trinity was\r\nchallenged by the Druid priests. He immediately stooped to the emerald\r\nsod, plucked therefrom a small trefoil plant called the shamrock—some\r\nsay it was the wood sorrel—and, holding it up before the inquisitive and\r\ninterested pagans, proved how possible it was to an infinite Power to\r\ncombine three in one and one in three. Since that far-distant day, the\r\nshamrock has been recognized as the premier national symbol of Ireland,\r\nalthough the “sunburst” flag, emblematic of the Druidic worship, it is\r\npresumed, precedes it in point of antiquity. The harp, which is another\r\nof Ireland’s symbols, was adopted at a later period, in recognition of\r\nher Bardic genius.\r\n\r\nSt. Patrick, or rather Patricius, his Roman name, which signifies a\r\nnobleman, lived and labored for many, many years after he preached at\r\nTara, and made many circuits of the island, adding tribe after tribe to\r\nthe great army of his converts. So deep was the impression he made in\r\nthe country that now, after the lapse of fourteen hundred years, which\r\nwere perioded by devastating wars and fearful religious and social\r\npersecutions, his memory is as green and as hallowed as if he had died\r\nbut yesterday. Mountains, rivers, lakes, islands, and plains are\r\nassociated with his name, and thousands of churches, in Ireland and\r\nthroughout the world, are called after him, while millions of Ireland’s\r\nsons are proud to answer to the glorious name of Patrick. He died at a\r\npatriarchal age, in the abbey of Saul, County Down, founded by himself,\r\nA.D. 493, and the anniversary of his departure from this life is\r\ncelebrated by Irishmen of all creeds, and in every land, on each 17th\r\nday of March, which is called, in his honor, St. Patrick’s Day.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that the Irish apostle is so well remembered and highly\r\nhonored. Since the disciples preached by the shores of the Galilee,\r\nthere has been no such conversion of almost an entire people from one\r\nform of belief to another. The Druid priests, with some exceptions,\r\nstruggled long and bitterly against the rising tide of Christianity in\r\nIreland, but, within the century following the death of the great\r\nmissionary, the Druidic rites disappeared forever from the land, and\r\n“Green Erin” became known thenceforth, for centuries, as the Island of\r\nSaints. Romantic tradition attributes to St. Patrick the miracle of\r\ndriving all venomous reptiles out of Ireland. It is certain, however,\r\nthat neither snakes nor toads exist upon her soil, although both are\r\nfound in the neighboring island of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nAccording to Nennius, a British writer quoted by Dr. Geoffrey Keating,\r\nSt. Patrick founded in Ireland “three hundred and fifty-five churches,\r\nand consecrated an equal number of bishops; and of priests, he ordained\r\nthree thousand.” “Let whomsoever may be surprised,” says Dr. Keating,\r\n“at this great number of bishops in Ireland, contemporary with St.\r\nPatrick, read what St. Bernard says in his Life of St. Malachias, as to\r\nthe practice in Ireland with regard to its bishops. He there says that\r\n‘the bishops are changed and multiplied at the will of the metropolitan,\r\nor archbishop, so that no single diocese is trusting to one, but almost\r\nevery church has its own proper bishop.’” After this statement of St.\r\nBernard no one can be astonished at the number of prelates mentioned\r\nabove, for the Church was then in its young bloom. The number of bishops\r\nthere mentioned will appear less wonderful on reading her domestic\r\nrecords. In them we find that every deaconry in Ireland was, formerly,\r\npresided over by a bishop. Irish annals show, also, that St. Patrick\r\nconsecrated in Ireland two archbishops, namely, an archbishop of Armagh,\r\nas Primate of Ireland, and an archbishop of Cashel. After the great\r\napostle’s death, a long and illustrious line of native Irish\r\nmissionaries took up his sacred work and completed his moral conquest of\r\nthe Irish nation. Nor did their labors terminate with the needs of their\r\nown country. They penetrated to the remotest corners of Britain, which\r\nit is said they first converted to the Christian faith, and made holy\r\npilgrimages to the continent of Europe, founding in every district they\r\nvisited abbeys, monasteries, and universities. Ireland herself became\r\nfor a long period the centre of knowledge and piety in insular Europe,\r\nand the ecclesiastical seminaries at Lismore, Bangor, Armagh,\r\nClonmacnois, and other places attracted thousands of students, both\r\nnative and alien, to her shores. Gaelic, the most ancient, it is claimed\r\nby many savants, of the Aryan tongues, was the national language, and\r\ncontinued so to be for more than a thousand years after the era of\r\nPatrick; but Latin, Greek, and Hebrew formed important parts of the\r\ncollegiate curriculum, and the first-named tongue was the ordinary means\r\nof communication with the learned men of other countries.\r\n\r\nThe art of illuminated writing on vellum was carried to unrivaled\r\nperfection in the Irish colleges and monasteries, and the manuscripts of\r\nthis class preserved in Dublin and London, facsimilies of which are now\r\nplaced in many American public libraries, as well as in those of\r\nEuropean universities, bear witness to the high state of civilization\r\nattained by the Irish people during the peaceful and prosperous\r\ncenturies that followed the coming of St. Patrick and continued until\r\nthe demoralizing Danish invasion of the eighth century.\r\n\r\nThe roll of the Irish saints of the early Christian period is a large\r\none, and contains, among others, the names of St. Columba, or\r\nColumbkill, St. Finn Barr, St. Brendan, the Navigator; St. Kieran, of\r\nOssory; St. Kevin, of Glendalough; St. Colman, of Dromore; St. Canice,\r\nof Kilkenny; St. Jarlath, of Tuam; St. Moling, of Ferns; St. Comgall, of\r\nBangor; St. Carthage, of Lismore; St. Finian, of Moville; St. Kieran, of\r\nClonmacnois; St. Laserian, of Leighlin; St. Fintan; St. Gall, the\r\nApostle of the Swiss; St. Columbanus, the Apostle of Burgundy; St.\r\nAidan, Apostle of Northumbria; St. Adamnan, Abbot of Iona; St. Rumold,\r\nApostle of Brabant; St. Feargal, Bishop of Salzburg. These are only a\r\nfew stars out of the almost countless galaxy of the holy men of ancient\r\nIreland. Of her holy women, also numerous, the chief were St. Bridget,\r\nBrighid, or Bride, of Kildare; St. Monina, St. Ita, St. Syra, St.\r\nDympna, and St. Samthan. The premier female saint was, undoubtedly, St.\r\nBridget, which signifies, in old Gaelic, “a fiery dart.” Modern slang\r\noften degrades the noble old name into “Biddy.” Although thought to be a\r\npurely Irish appellation, it has been borne by, at least, two English\r\nwomen of note. The Lady Bridget Plantagenet, youngest daughter of King\r\nEdward IV, and “Mistress,” or Miss, Bridget Cromwell, daughter of the\r\nLord Protector of the English Commonwealth. Lady Plantagenet, who, in\r\naddition to being the daughter of a monarch, was the sister of Edward V\r\nand Elizabeth, Queen of Henry VII; the niece of Richard III and the aunt\r\nof Henry VIII, died a nun in the convent of Dartford, England, long\r\nafter the House of York had ceased to reign. “Mistress” Cromwell became\r\nthe wife of one of her father’s ablest partisans, and lived to see the\r\nend of the Protectorate, from which her brother, Richard, was deposed,\r\nand the restoration of the House of Stuart to the English throne.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                Ancient Laws and Government of the Irish\r\n\r\n\r\nIRELAND, ages before she was Christianized, possessed a legal code of\r\ngreat merit, generally called the Brehon Laws. These remained more or\r\nless in force, from the earliest historic period down to the days of\r\nJames I, who, because of the wars and conquests of the armies of his\r\npredecessor, Queen Elizabeth, was the first of the English monarchs that\r\nsucceeded in thoroughly breaking up the old system of Irish law and\r\ngovernment. The Brehon Laws were of Irish origin and contained many\r\nprovisions more in harmony with humanity and wisdom than some of the\r\nboasted English enactments. In common with many other ancient countries\r\nof Europe, Ireland did not impose the death penalty on a homicide, but,\r\ninstead, collected an eric, or blood fine, from him and his relatives,\r\nfor the benefit of the family of the man slain by his hand. The best and\r\nbriefest work on these interesting laws, which need more attention than\r\nthey can be given in a general history, was recently issued by an\r\nEnglish publishing house for the industrious author, Lawrence Ginnell,\r\nlawyer, of the Middle Temple, London. In writing of the ancient form of\r\nIrish monarchy, which, as we have already noted, was elective, Mr.\r\nGinnell says: “The Irish always had a man, not an assembly, at the head\r\nof the state, and the system of electing a Tanist (heir-apparent) while\r\nthe holder of the office was living, in addition to its making for peace\r\non the demise of the Crown, made an interregnum of more rare occurrence\r\nthan in countries which had not provided a Tanist in advance.” The same\r\nauthor divides the classes of Irish kings thus: The lowest was the\r\nRigh-Inagh (Ree-eena), or king of one district, the people of which\r\nformed an organic state. Sometimes two or three of these, nearly related\r\nand having mutual interests, did not hesitate to combine for the public\r\ngood under one king. The next in rank was the Righ-Mor-Tuah\r\n(Ree-More-Tooa), who ruled over a number of districts, and often had\r\nsub-kings under him. The next class of monarch was the Righ-Cuicidh\r\n(Ree-Cooga), a title which signified that he had five of the preceding\r\nclass within his jurisdiction. This was the rank of a provincial king.\r\nAnd, highest of all, as his title implied, was the Ard-Righ (Ard-Ree),\r\nmeaning High, or Over, King, who had his seat of government for many\r\nages at the national palace and capital, established on the “royal hill\r\nof Tara” in Meath. The king of each district owed allegiance and tribute\r\nto the Righ-Mor-Tuah. The latter owed allegiance and tribute to the\r\nRigh-Cuicidh; and he, in turn, owed allegiance and tribute to the\r\nArd-Righ.\r\n\r\nAlthough the ancient Irish monarchy was, except where forceful\r\nusurpation occasionally prevailed, elective, the candidate for the\r\nTanistry, or heir-apparency, was required to be of the “blood royal.”\r\nMinors were seldom or never recognized as being eligible. At rare\r\nintervals one might win popular recognition by displaying a precocious\r\nwisdom, or prowess. The ablest and bravest male member of the reigning\r\nfamily was almost invariably chosen Ard-Righ, and the provincial and\r\ndistrict rulers were chosen on the same principle. Meath was the High\r\nKing’s own province, and the lesser monarchs swayed over Ulster,\r\nMunster, Leinster, and Connaught, subsidiary to, yet in a measure\r\nindependent of, the Ard-Righ, who held his court at Tara until A.D. 554,\r\nwhen St. Ruadan, because of sacrilege committed by the reigning monarch,\r\nDermid, in dragging a prisoner from the saint’s own sanctuary and\r\nkilling him, pronounced a malediction on the royal hill and palaces.\r\nThenceforth Tara ceased to be the residence of the Ard-Righs of Ireland,\r\nand total ruin speedily fell upon it. All that now remains of its\r\nlegendary splendor is comprised in the fast vanishing mounds on which\r\nonce stood the palaces, assembly halls, and other public buildings of\r\nIreland’s ancient monarchs. No man or woman of Irish race can gaze\r\nunmoved on the venerable eminence, rising proudly still above the rich\r\nplains of Meath, which has beheld so many fast succeeding vicissitudes\r\nof a nation’s rise, agony, and fall.\r\n\r\n                 “No more to chiefs and ladies bright\r\n                     The harp of Tara swells;\r\n                  The chord alone which breaks at night\r\n                     Its tale of ruin tells:\r\n                  Thus, Freedom now so seldom wakes,\r\n                     The only throb she gives\r\n                  Is when some heart indignant breaks\r\n                     To show that still she lives.”\r\n\r\nThe most famous and powerful of the royal families of Ireland were the\r\nO’Neills of Ulster, who enjoyed the High Kingship longest of all; the\r\nO’Briens of Munster, the O’Conors of Connaught, the MacMurroughs of\r\nLeinster, and the McLaughlins of Meath. Their descendants are simply\r\nlegion, for all the Irish clansmen were kindred to their kings and\r\nchiefs, and assumed, as was their blood right, their surnames when these\r\ncame into fashion. When the Irish septs, about the end of the tenth\r\ncentury, by the direction of King Brian the Great, chose their family\r\ndesignations, the prefix “Mac” was taken as indicating the son, or some\r\nimmediate descendant of the monarch, prince, or chief of that particular\r\ntribe, while that of “Ui” or “O,” as it is now universally written in\r\nEnglish, signified a grandson or some more remote kinsman of the\r\noriginal founder of the name. Thus, the families bearing the prefix\r\n“Mac” generally hold that they descend from the elder lines of the royal\r\nfamily, or the leading chiefs, while those who bear the “O” descend from\r\nthe younger lines. And so it has come to be a national proverb, founded\r\non more than mere fancy, that every Irishman is the descendant of a\r\nking. The Irish prefixes, however, are a genuine certificate of\r\nnobility, if by that term is meant long descent. An old rhyme puts the\r\nmatter in homely but logical manner thus:\r\n\r\n                  “By ‘Mac’ and ‘O’ you’ll surely know\r\n                     True Irishmen, they say;\r\n                   But if they lack both ‘O’ and ‘Mac’\r\n                     No Irishmen are they.”\r\n\r\nMany families of Irish origin in this and other countries have foolishly\r\ndropped the Celtic prefixes from their names, and thus destroyed their\r\nbest title to respectability. They should remember that “Mac” and “O”\r\nindicate a longer and nobler pedigree than either Capet, Plantagenet,\r\nTudor, Stuart, Guelph, or Wettin—all distinguished enough in their way,\r\nbut quite modern when compared with the Gaelic patronymics. The Scotch\r\nHighlanders, who are of the junior branch of the Irish race, according\r\nto the most reliable historians, use the “Mac” very generally, while the\r\n“O” is rarely found among them. On this account, as well as others, some\r\nof the Scottish savants have attempted to argue that Ireland was\r\noriginally peopled by immigrants from Scotland, but this argument is\r\nfallacious on its face, because Ireland was known to the ancients as\r\n“Scotia Major”—greater or older Scotland; while the latter country was\r\ndesignated “Scotia Minor”—smaller or younger Scotland. The Irish and\r\nScotch were alike called “Scots” until long after the time of St.\r\nPatrick, and the kindred nations were close friends and helpful allies,\r\nfrom the earliest historical period down to the reign of Edward III of\r\nEngland, and even later. It was in Ireland that Robert Bruce, his\r\nbrother Edward—afterward elected and crowned king of that country—and\r\ntheir few faithful retainers sought and found friends and a refuge just\r\nbefore their final great victory at Bannockburn, A.D. 1314. Sir Walter\r\nScott mentions this fact in his graphic “Tales of a Grandfather,” and\r\nalso in his stirring poem, “The Lord of the Isles.” Keating quotes Bede,\r\nwho lived about 700 hundred years after Christ, as saying in his\r\n“History of the Saxons,” “Hibernia is the proper fatherland of the\r\nScoti” (Scots). So also Calgravius, another ancient historian, who, in\r\nwriting of St. Columba, says: “Hibernia (Ireland) was anciently called\r\nScotia, and from it sprang, and emigrated, the nation of the Scoti,\r\nwhich inhabits the part of Albania (Scotland) that lies nearest to Great\r\nBritain (meaning England), and that has been since called Scotia from\r\nthe fact.”\r\n\r\n“Marianus Scotus, an Alban (_i.e._ Scotch) writer,” says Keating, “bears\r\nsimilar testimony in writing on the subject of St. Kilian. Here are his\r\nwords: ‘Although the part of Britannia which borders upon Anglia\r\n(England) and stretches toward the north, is at present distinctively\r\ncalled Scotia (Scotland), nevertheless, the Venerable Bede (already\r\nquoted) shows that Hibernia was formerly known by that name; for he\r\ninforms us that the nation of the Picti (Picts) arrived in Hibernia from\r\nScythia, and that they found there the nation of the Scoti.’\r\n\r\n“Serapus, in certain remarks which he makes in writing about St.\r\nBonifacius, is in perfect accord with the above cited writers. He says\r\nthat ‘Hibernia, likewise, claimed Scotia as one of her names, but,\r\nhowever, because a certain part of the Scotic nation emigrated from this\r\nsame Hibernia and settled in those parts of Britannia in which the Picti\r\nwere then dwelling, and was there called the nation of the Dal-Riada,\r\nfrom the name of its leader, as the Venerable Bede relates, and because\r\nthis tribe afterward drove the Picti from their homes, and seized upon\r\nthe entire northern region for themselves, and gave it the ancient name\r\nof their own race, so that the nation might remain undivided; in this\r\nmanner has the name of Scotia become ambiguous—one, the elder, and\r\nproper, Scotia being in Hibernia, while the other, the more recent, lies\r\nin the northern part of Britannia.’ From the words of the author I draw\r\nthese conclusions: (1) that the Irish were, in strict truth, the real\r\nScoti; (2) that the Dal-Riada was the first race, dwelling in Scotland,\r\nto which the name of Scoti was applied; (3) that Ireland was the true,\r\nancient Scotia, and that Alba (Scotland) was the New Scotia, and also\r\nthat it was the Kinéscuit, or Tribe of Scot, that first called it\r\nScotia.”\r\n\r\nThere were numerous after invasions of Alba by the Milesian Irish, who\r\nestablished new colonies—the most formidable of which was that founded\r\nby the brothers Fergus, Andgus, and Lorne in the beginning of the sixth\r\ncentury. For nearly a hundred years this colony paid tribute to Ireland,\r\nbut, in 574, the Scotch King Aedan, who was brother to the King of\r\nLeinster, declined to pay further tribute. A conference of the monarchs\r\nwas held—all being close kindred of the Hy-Nial race—and St. Columba,\r\ntheir immortal cousin, came from his monastery in Iona to take counsel\r\nwith them. The result was a wise and generous abrogation of the tribute\r\nby the Irish nation, and Scotland became independent, but remained, for\r\nlong centuries, as before stated, the cordial friend and ally of her\r\nsister country. The Scots then became paramount in Scotia Minor, and\r\nbrought under subjection all the tribes who were hostile to the royal\r\nline, founded by Fergus, from whom descended the Stuarts and other\r\nmonarchical houses of Great Britain. This convention also lessened the\r\nnumber and power of the Bards, who had become arrogant and exacting in\r\ntheir demands upon the kings, princes, and chiefs, who feared their\r\nsarcastic talent, and paid exorbitant levies, rather than endure their\r\nabuse and ridicule.\r\n\r\nAfter the abandonment of Tara as a royal residence, in the sixth\r\ncentury, the High Kings held court at Tailltenn, now Telltown, and\r\nTlachtga, now the Hill of Ward, in Meath, and at Ushnagh (Usna) in\r\nWestmeath. The Ulster monarchs had seats at Emain, near Armagh (Ar’-ma’)\r\nGreenan-Ely, on the hill of Ailech, in Donegal; and at Dun-Kiltair—still\r\na striking ruin—near Downpatrick. The kings of Leinster had their\r\npalaces at Naas in Kildare, Dunlavin in Wicklow, Kells in Meath, and\r\nDinnree, near Leighlin Bridge, in Catherlough (Carlow). The Munster\r\nrulers held high carnival, for ages, at Cashel of the Kings and Caher,\r\nin Tipperary; at Bruree and Treda-na-Rhee—still a most picturesque\r\nmound, showing the ancient Celtic method of fortification, in Limerick;\r\nand at Kinkora, situated on the right bank of the Shannon, in Clare. The\r\nO’Conors, kings of Connaught, had royal residences at Rathcroaghan\r\n(Crohan) and Ballintober—the latter founded by “Cathal Mor of the Wine\r\nRed Hand,” in the thirteenth century—in the present county of Roscommon;\r\nand at Athunree, or Athenry—Anglice, “the Ford of the Kings,” in Galway.\r\nBallintober, according to tradition, was the finest royal residence in\r\nall Ireland, and the remains of Cathal Mor’s castle are still pointed\r\nout in the vicinity of the town. It was to it Clarence Mangan alluded in\r\nhis “Vision of Connaught in the Thirteenth Century,” thus:\r\n\r\n               “Then saw I thrones and circling fires,\r\n                  And a dome rose near me as by a spell,\r\n                Whence flowed the tone of silver lyres\r\n                  And many voices in wreathèd swell.\r\n                    And their thrilling chime\r\n                      Fell on mine ears\r\n                  Like the heavenly hymn of an angel band—\r\n                   ‘It is now the time\r\n                     We are in the years\r\n                  Of Cathal Mor of the Wine Red Hand.’”\r\n\r\nOne of the great institutions of ancient Ireland, vouched for by Dr.\r\nGeoffrey Keating and many other learned historians, was the Fiann, or\r\nNational Guard, of the country, first commanded by Finn MacCumhail\r\n(MacCool), “the Irish Cid” of pagan times. This force was popular and\r\nlived by hunting, when not actively engaged in warfare, to preserve\r\ninternal government, or repel foreign aggression. When so engaged, they\r\nwere quartered upon and supported by the people of the localities in\r\nwhich they rendered service. Their organization was simple, and bore\r\nmuch resemblance to the regimental and company formations of the present\r\nday. Their drill and discipline were excessively severe. Four\r\ninjunctions were laid upon every person who entered this military order.\r\nThe first was “to receive no portion with a wife, but to choose her for\r\ngood manners and virtue.” The second was “never to offer violence to any\r\nwoman.” The third enjoined on the member “never to give a refusal to any\r\nmortal for anything of which one was possessed.” The fourth was “that no\r\nsingle warrior of their body should ever flee before nine champions.”\r\n\r\nOther stipulations were of a more drastic character. No member of the\r\nFiann could allow his blood, if shed, to be avenged by any other person\r\nthan himself, if he should survive to avenge; and his father, mother,\r\nrelatives, and tribe had to renounce all claim for compensation for his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nNo member could be admitted until he became a Bard and had mastered the\r\nTwelve Books of Poesy.\r\n\r\nNo man could be allowed into the Fiann until a pit or trench deep enough\r\nto reach to his knees had been dug in the earth, and he had been placed\r\ntherein, armed with his shield, and holding in his hand a hazel staff of\r\nthe length of a warrior’s arm. Nine warriors, armed with nine javelins,\r\nwere then set opposite him, at the distance of nine ridges; these had to\r\ncast their nine weapons at him all at once, and then, if he chanced to\r\nreceive a single wound, in spite of his shield and staff, he was not\r\nadmitted to the Order.\r\n\r\nAnother rule was that the candidate must run through a wood, at full\r\nspeed, with his hair plaited, and with only the grace of a single tree\r\nbetween him and detailed pursuers. If they came up with him, or wounded\r\nhim, he was rejected.\r\n\r\nHe was also rejected “if his arms trembled in his hands”; or if, in\r\nrunning through the wood, “a single braid of his hair had been loosened\r\nout of its plait.”\r\n\r\nHe was not admitted if, in his flight, his foot had broken a single\r\nwithered branch. Neither could he pass muster “unless he could jump over\r\na branch of a tree as high as his forehead, and could stoop under one as\r\nlow as his knee, through the agility of his body.” He was rejected,\r\nalso, if he failed “to pluck a thorn out of his heel with his hand\r\nwithout stopping in his course.” Each member, before being admitted to\r\nthe Order, was obliged to swear fidelity and homage to the Righ-Feinnedh\r\n(Ree-Feena) or king of the Fenians, which is the English translation of\r\nthe title.\r\n\r\nThere were also other military bodies—not forgetting the more ancient\r\n“Red Branch Knights,” whom Moore has immortalized in one of his finest\r\nlyrics, but the Fenians and their redoubtable chief hold the foremost\r\nplace of fame in Irish national annals.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that a kind of loose federal compact existed, from time to\r\ntime, between the High King and the other monarchs, but, unfortunately,\r\nthere does not appear to have been a very strong or permanent bond of\r\nunion, and this fatal defect in the Irish Constitution of pre-Norman\r\ntimes led to innumerable disputes about succession to the Ard-Righship\r\nand endless civil wars, which eventually wrecked the national strength\r\nand made the country the comparatively easy prey of adventurous and\r\nambitious foreigners. The monarchical system was, in itself, faulty.\r\nWhere a monarchy exists at all, the succession should be so regulated\r\nthat the lineal heir, according to primogeniture, whether a minor or\r\nnot, must succeed to the throne, except when the succession is, for some\r\ngood and sufficient reason, set aside by the legislative body of the\r\nnation. This was done in England in the case of Henry IV, who, with the\r\nconsent of Parliament, usurped the crown of Richard II; and also in the\r\ncase of William and Mary, who were selected by the British Parliament of\r\ntheir day to supplant James II, the father-in-law and uncle of the\r\nformer and father of the latter. The act of settlement and succession,\r\npassed in 1701, ignored the male line of the Stuarts, chiefly because it\r\nwas Catholic, and placed the succession to the throne, failing issue of\r\nWilliam and Mary and Anne, another daughter of the deposed King James,\r\nin a younger, Protestant branch of the female line of Stuart—the House\r\nof Hanover-Brunswick—which now wears the British crown. But, in general,\r\nas far as the question of monarchy is concerned, the direct system of\r\nsuccession has proven most satisfactory, and has frequently prevented\r\nconfusion of title and consequent civil war. We can recall only one\r\nhighly important occasion when it provoked that evil—the sanguinary\r\nthirty years’ feud between the kindred royal English, or, rather,\r\nNorman-French, Houses of York and Lancaster. Even in that case the\r\nquarrel arose from the original bad title of Henry IV, who was far from\r\nbeing the lineal heir to the throne. Our own democratic system of\r\nchoosing a chief ruler is, no doubt, best of all. We elect from the body\r\nof the people a President whose term of office is four years. In some\r\nrespects he has more executive power than most hereditary monarchs, but\r\nif at the end of his official term he fails to suit a majority of the\r\ndelegates of his party to the National Convention, some other member of\r\nit is nominated in his stead. The opposition party also nominates a\r\ncandidate, and very often succeeds in defeating the standard-bearer of\r\nthe party in power. Sometimes there are three or more Presidential\r\ncandidates in the field, as was the case in 1860, when Abraham Lincoln\r\nwas elected. Succession to the Presidency, therefore, is not confined to\r\nany one family, or its branches, in a republic, and the office of\r\nPresident of the United States may be competed for by any eligible male\r\ncitizen who can control his party nomination. The example of Washington,\r\nwho refused a third term, has become an unwritten law in America, and it\r\ndefeated General Grant’s aspiration to succeed Mr. Hayes in the\r\nRepublican National Convention of 1880. In France, under Napoleon, every\r\nFrench soldier was supposed to carry a marshal’s baton in his knapsack.\r\nIn the United States, every native-born schoolboy carries the\r\nPresidential portfolio in his satchel.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                       Period of Danish Invasion\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Irish people, having settled down to the Christian form of worship,\r\nwere enjoying “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,” building\r\nchurches and colleges, and sending out a stream of saints and scholars\r\nto the rest of Europe, when, about the end of the eighth century, the\r\nrestless Norsemen, universally called “Danes” in Ireland, swept down in\r\ntheir galleys by thousands on the Irish coasts, and, after many fierce\r\nconflicts, succeeded in establishing colonies at the mouths of many of\r\nthe great rivers of the island. There they built fortified towns, from\r\nwhich they were able to sally forth by sea or land to change their base\r\nof operations and establish new conquests. Dublin at the mouth of the\r\nLiffey, Drogheda at the mouth of the Boyne, Wexford at the mouth of the\r\nSlaney, Waterford at the mouth of the Suir, and Limerick at the estuary\r\nof the Shannon, are all cities founded by the Danes, who were natural\r\ntraders and fierce warriors. They did not confine their attentions\r\nexclusively to Ireland, but, about the same period, conquered Saxon\r\nEngland, ruling completely over it; and they established a strong colony\r\non the north coast of France, which is called Normandy to this day, and\r\nfrom which sprang, by a combination of Scandian with Gallic blood, the\r\ngreatest race of warriors—the Romans, perhaps, excepted—the world has\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nThe native Irish met their fierce invaders with dauntless courage, but\r\nthey had been so long at peace that they were no longer expert in the\r\nuse of arms, and the Danes were all-powerful on the seas. Those Norsemen\r\nwere pagans, and had no respect for revealed religion, literature, works\r\nof art, architecture, or, in, short, anything except land-grabbing and\r\nplunder. It must be remembered that most of northern Europe, at the\r\nperiod written of, was in a benighted state, and that Great Britain\r\nitself was barely emerging from the intellectual and spiritual gloom of\r\nthe Dark Ages. The Norse invaders, whenever successful in their\r\nenterprises against the Irish chiefs, invariably demolished the churches\r\nand colleges, murdered the priests, monks, and nuns—often, however,\r\ncarrying the latter into captivity—and burned many of the priceless\r\nmanuscripts, the pride and the glory of the illustrious scholarship of\r\nancient Ireland. In the middle portion of the ninth century—about\r\n840—when Nial III was Ard-Righ of Ireland, came the fierce Dane\r\nTurgesius, at the head of an immense fleet and army. He at once\r\nproceeded to ravage the exposed portions of the coast, and then forced\r\nhis way inland, laying the country under tribute of all kinds as he\r\nadvanced. He made prisoners of Irish virgins and married them, by main\r\nforce, to his barbarous chiefs. He even occupied the celebrated\r\nmonastery of Clonmacnois and its university as a headquarters, converted\r\nthe great altar into a throne, and issued his murderous edicts from that\r\nholy spot. Clonmacnois, translated into English, means “the Retreat of\r\nthe Sons of the Noble,” and was the Alma Mater of the princes and\r\nnobility of Ireland. This crowning outrage, coupled with insults offered\r\nto Irish ladies, finally aroused the spirit of burning vengeance in the\r\nbreasts of the Irish people. Tradition says that thirty handsome young\r\nmen, disguised as maidens, attended a feast given at Clonmacnois by\r\nTurgesius and his chiefs. When the barbarians were sated and had fallen\r\ninto a drunken stupor, the youths rose upon and slew them all. The body\r\nof Turgesius, with a millstone tied around the neck, was thrown into a\r\nneighboring lake. Then the nation, under the brave Nial III, rose and\r\ndrove the Norsemen back to the seacoast, where they rallied. Another\r\nraid on the interior of the island was attempted, but repelled. Sad to\r\nrelate, the gallant King Nial, while attempting to save the life of a\r\nretainer who fell into the Callan River, was himself drowned, to the\r\ngreat grief of all Ireland. The name of the river in which he perished\r\nwas changed to the Ownarigh (Ownaree) or King’s River—a designation\r\nwhich, after the lapse of ages, it still retains.\r\n\r\nA period of comparative repose followed. Many of the Danes became\r\nconverts to Christian doctrine, and there was, probably, more or less of\r\nintermarriage among the higher classes of the rival races. But the\r\nNorsemen retained much of their old-time ferocity, and, occasionally,\r\nthe ancient struggle for supremacy was renewed, with varying success. It\r\nis humiliating for an Irish writer to be obliged to admit that some of\r\nthe Irish Christian princes, jealous of the incumbent Ard-Righ, did not\r\nremain faithful to their country, and actually allied themselves with\r\nthe Danes, participating in their barbarous acts. This explains why, for\r\na period of about three hundred years, in spite of repeated Irish\r\nvictories, the Norsemen were able to hold for themselves a large portion\r\nof Ireland, especially the districts lying close to the sea, where they\r\nhad no difficulty in receiving supplies and reinforcements from Denmark\r\nand Norway. Many of those old Irish princes were, indeed, conscienceless\r\ntraitors, but the people, as a whole, never abandoned the national\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nThe feuds of the Munster chiefs, toward the end of the tenth century,\r\nhad the unlooked-for effect of bringing to the front the greatest ruler\r\nand warrior produced by ancient Ireland. Because of a series of\r\ntragedies in which the hero himself bore no blameful part, Brian of\r\nKinkora, son of Kennedy and brother of Mahon, both of whom had reigned\r\nas kings of Thomond, or North Munster, ascended the throne of that\r\nprovince. Mahon, progenitor of the southern MacMahons—from whom\r\ndescended the late President of the French Republic, Maurice Patrice\r\nMacMahon, Marshal of France and Duke of Magenta—was murdered by Prince\r\nDonovan, a faithless ally. His younger brother, Brian, afterward called\r\nBorumah or “Boru”—literally, “Brian of the Cow Tribute”—fiercely avenged\r\nhis assassination on the treacherous Donovan, and on the Danish settlers\r\nof Limerick, who were the confederates of that criminal in his evil\r\nacts. Brian, young, powerful, and destitute of fear, after disposing of\r\nDonovan, killed with his own brave hand Ivor, the Danish prince,\r\ntogether with his two sons, although these fierce pagans had taken\r\nrefuge in the Christian sanctuary on Scattery Island, in the Shannon,\r\nand then swept the remaining conspirators, both Irish and Danes, off the\r\nface of the earth. Prince Murrough, Brian’s heir, then a mere boy, slew\r\nin single combat the villanous chief, Molloy, who, as the base\r\ninstrument of Donovan and Ivor, actually killed his uncle, King Mahon.\r\nAfterward, Brian reigned for a brief period, quietly, as King of\r\nThomond. He had a profound insight and well knew that only a strong,\r\ncentralized government could unite all Ireland against the foreigners,\r\nand he designed to be the head of such a government. He had only one\r\nrival in fame and ability on Irish soil—the reigning Ard-Righ, Malachy\r\nII. This monarch had scourged the warrior Northmen in many bloody\r\ncampaigns. In one battle he slew two Danish princes, and took from one a\r\ngolden collar, and from the other a priceless sword. The poet Moore\r\ncommemorates the former exploit in the well-known melody, “Let Erin\r\nRemember the Days of Old.”\r\n\r\nBrian of Kinkora, fiery of mood, enterprising, ambitious, and, we fear,\r\nsomewhat unscrupulous in pursuit of sovereignty, a born general and\r\ndiplomat, as either capacity might suit his purpose, burned to possess\r\nhimself of the supreme sceptre. His ambition led, as usual under such\r\nconditions, to acts of aggression on his part, and, finally, to civil\r\nwar between Malachy and himself. A terrible struggle raged in Ireland\r\nfor twenty years, until, at last, Ard-Righ Malachy was forced to\r\ncapitulate, and his rival became High King of Ireland in his place. The\r\nDanes, naturally, took advantage of the civil strife to re-establish\r\ntheir sway in the island, and gained many advantages over the Irish\r\ntroops. Moved by the danger of his country, the noble Malachy allied\r\nhimself with Brian, and, together, they marched against the Norsemen and\r\ndrove them back to their seacoast forts. But those bold and restless\r\nspirits did not, therefore, cease to war upon Ireland. Again and yet\r\nagain they placed new armies in the field, only to be again baffled and\r\nrouted by either the skilful Brian or the devoted Malachy.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n Battle of Clontarf, A.D., 1014—Total Overthrow of the Danish Army and\r\n                            Power in Ireland\r\n\r\n\r\nMANY of the princes of Leinster, more especially the MacMurroughs\r\n(MacMurro) were generally, in some measure, allied to the Danes, and\r\nfought with them against their own countrymen. After several years of\r\nwarfare, a peace was, at length, patched up with the MacMurrough, and he\r\nbecame a guest of King Brian at Kinkora. In those days chess was the\r\nnational game of the Irish princes and chiefs, and while engaged in it\r\nwith the Leinster guest, Prince Murrough (Murro), Brian’s eldest son, in\r\na fit of anger, hurled a taunt at the former in regard to his recent\r\nalliance with the invaders of his country. This action was, of course,\r\nrude, and even brutal, on the part of Prince Murrough, although\r\nMacMurrough had been guilty of treasonable offences. The Leinster\r\npotentate rose immediately from the table at which they were playing,\r\npale from rage, and, in a loud voice, called for his horse and\r\nretainers. He was obeyed at once and left the palace. The wise King\r\nBrian, on learning of the quarrel and departure, sent messengers after\r\nthe King of Leinster to bring him back, but his anger was so great that\r\nhe would not listen to their representations, so that they went back\r\nwithout him to Kinkora. MacMurrough immediately re-allied himself with\r\nthe Danes, and so the flames of war were rekindled with a vengeance.\r\nMany other princes and chiefs of Leinster made common cause with their\r\nking and his foreign allies. Reinforcements for the latter poured into\r\nIreland from Scandinavia, from Britain, from the neighboring islands,\r\nfrom every spot of earth on which an invader could be mustered—all\r\ninflamed against Ireland, and all expecting to wipe King Brian and his\r\narmy from the Irish soil. But Brian had his allies, too; the armies of\r\nMunster, Connaught, part of Ulster, and most of the heroic clans of\r\nLeinster flocked to his standard, the latter led by the ever-faithful\r\nMalachy and his tributary chiefs. All of the MacMurrough interest, as\r\nalready stated, sided with the Danes. A majority of the Ulster princes,\r\njealous of Brian’s fame and supreme power, held back from his support,\r\nbut did not join the common enemy.\r\n\r\nBrian was now an old man, and even his bold son, Murrough, the primary\r\ncause of the new trouble, was beyond middle age. The hostile armies\r\nhurried toward Dublin, the principal Danish stronghold, and on Good\r\nFriday morning, April 23, 1014, were face to face on the sands of\r\nClontarf, which slope down to Dublin Bay. We have no correct account of\r\nthe numbers engaged, but there were, probably, not less than thirty\r\nthousand men—large armies for those remote days—on each side. It was a\r\nlong and a terrible battle, for each army appeared determined to conquer\r\nor die. Under King Brian commanded Prince Murrough and his five\r\nbrothers: Malachy, Kian, Prince of Desmond, or South Munster; Davoren,\r\nof the same province; O’Kelly, Prince of Hy-Many, East Connaught;\r\nO’Heyne, the Prince of Dalaradia, and the Stewards of Mar and Lennox in\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nThe Danes and their allies were commanded by Brodar, the chief admiral\r\nof the Danish fleet; King Sitric, of Dublin;[1] the Danish captains,\r\nSigurd and Duvgall, and the warrior Norwegian chiefs, Carlos and Anrud.\r\nThe Lord of the Orkney Islands also led a contingent, in which Welsh and\r\nCornish auxiliaries figured.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  Sitric, according to some writers, was not in the battle.\r\n\r\nThus, it will seem, the cause was one of moment, as the fate of a\r\ncountry was to be decided, and the ablest captains of Ireland and\r\nScandinavia led the van of the respective hosts. The struggle was long\r\nand murderous, for the armies fought hand to hand. Brian, too feeble to\r\nsit his war-horse and bear the weight of even his light armor, worn out,\r\nmoreover, by the long march and the marshaling of his forces, was\r\nprevailed upon to retire to his pavilion and rest. He placed the active\r\ncommand of the Irish army in the hands of King Malachy and his son,\r\nPrince Murrough O’Brien. The conflict lasted from daylight until near\r\nthe setting of the sun. Every leader of note on the Danish side, except\r\nBrodar, was killed—many by the strong hand of Prince Murrough and his\r\nbrave young son, Turlough O’Brien, after his father the person most\r\nlikely to be elected to the chief kingship of Ireland. On the Irish side\r\nthere fell Prince Murrough, his gallant son, the Scottish chiefs of Mar\r\nand Lennox, who came, with their power, to fight for Ireland, and many\r\nother leaders of renown. King Brian himself, while at prayer in his\r\ntent, which stood apart and unguarded, was killed by Brodar, the flying\r\nDanish admiral, who was pursued and put to death by a party of Irish\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nThe slaughter of the minor officers and private men, on both sides, was\r\nimmense, and the little river Tolka, on the banks of which the main\r\nbattle was fought, was choked with dead bodies and ran red with blood.\r\nBut the Danes and their allies were completely broken and routed, and\r\nthe raven of Denmark never again soared to victory in the Irish sky.\r\nMany Danes remained in the Irish seaport towns, but they became Irish in\r\ndress, language, and feeling, and thousands of their descendants are\r\namong the best of Irishmen to-day.\r\n\r\nIreland, although so signally victorious at Clontarf, sustained what\r\nproved to be a deadly blow in the loss of her aged king and his two\r\nimmediate heirs. Brian, himself, unwittingly opened the door of discord\r\nwhen he took the crown forcibly from the Hy-Niall family, which had worn\r\nit so long. His aim was to establish a supreme and perpetual Dalcassian\r\ndynasty in himself and his descendants—a wise idea for those times, but\r\none balked by destiny. Now all the provincial Irish monarchs aspired to\r\nthe supreme power, and this caused no end of jealousy and intrigue.\r\nBrian, in his day of pride, had been hard on the Ossorians, and their\r\nchief, Fitzpatrick, Prince of Ossory, basely visited his wrath, as an\r\nally of the Danes, on the Dalcassian contingent of the Irish army\r\nreturning from Clontarf encumbered by their wounded. But these dauntless\r\nwarriors did not for a moment flinch. The hale stood gallantly to their\r\narms, and the wounded, unable to stand upright, demanded to be tied to\r\nstakes placed in the ground, and thus supported they fought with\r\nmagnificent desperation. The treacherous Ossorian prince was routed, as\r\nhe deserved to be, and has left behind a name of infamy. Many noble\r\npatriots of the house of Fitzpatrick have since arisen and passed away,\r\nbut that particular traitor ranks with Iscariot, MacMurrough, Monteith,\r\nand Arnold in the annals of treachery. Who that has read them has not\r\nbeen thrilled by the noble lines of Moore which describe the sacrifice\r\nof the wounded Dalcassians?\r\n\r\n         “Forget not our wounded companions who stood\r\n            In the day of distress by our side;\r\n          When the moss of the valley grew red with their blood\r\n            They stirred not, but conquered and died!\r\n          That sun which now blesses our arms with his light,—\r\n            Saw them fall upon Ossory’s plain,\r\n          O! let him not blush when he leaves us to-night\r\n            To find that they fell there in vain.”\r\n\r\nThe glorious King Malachy, although ever in the thickest of the battle,\r\nsurvived the carnage of Clontarf. Unable to agree upon a candidate from\r\nany of the provincial royal families because of their bitter rivalries,\r\nthe various factions, having confidence in Malachy’s wisdom and\r\npatriotism, again elected him High King of Ireland, the last man who\r\nheld that title without dispute. He reigned but eight years after his\r\nsecond elevation to the supreme throne of his country and died at a good\r\nold age about the middle of September, 1022, in the odor of sanctity,\r\nand sincerely lamented by the Irish nation, excepting a few ambitious\r\nprinces who coveted the crown his acts had glorified. In the whole range\r\nof Irish history he was the noblest royal character, and his name\r\ndeserves to be forever honored by the nation he sought to preserve.\r\n\r\nAfter the good king’s death, a younger son of Brian Boru, Prince Donough\r\n(Dunna), made an attempt to be elected Ard-Righ, and, failing in that,\r\nsought to hold the crown by force. But the provincial monarchs refused\r\nto recognize his claims, as he did not appear to inherit either the\r\nmilitary prowess or force of character of his great father. After some\r\nfutile attempts to maintain his assumed authority, he was finally\r\ndeposed by his abler nephew, Turlough O’Brien, who occupied the throne,\r\nnot without violent opposition, for a period. Poor Donough proceeded to\r\nRome and presented his father’s crown and harp to the Pope, probably\r\nbecause he had no other valuable offerings to bestow. This circumstance\r\nwas afterward made use of by the Anglo-Normans to make it appear that\r\nthe presentation made by the deposed and discredited Donough to the\r\nPontiff carried with it the surrender of the sovereignty of Ireland to\r\nhis Holiness. No argument could be more absurd, because, as has been\r\nshown, the crown of Ireland was elective, not hereditary, except with\r\nwell understood limitations, which made the blood royal a necessity in\r\nany candidate. Donough, in any case, was never acknowledged as High King\r\nof Ireland, and could not transfer a title he did not possess. In fact\r\nall the Irish monarchs may be best described not as Kings of Ireland,\r\nbut Kings of the Irish. They had no power to alienate, or transfer, the\r\ntribe lands from the people, and held them only in trust for their\r\nvoluntary subjects. Modern Irish landlordism is founded on the feudal,\r\nnot the tribal, system. Hence its unfitness to satisfy a people in whom\r\nlingers the heredity of the ancient Celtic custom. King Brian, the most\r\nabsolute of all the Irish rulers, is described by some annalists as\r\n“Emperor of the Irish.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                 Desolating Civil Wars Among the Irish\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM the deposition of Donough O’Brien down to the period of the Norman\r\ninvasion of the island—about a century and a half—Ireland was cursed by\r\nthe civil wars which raged interminably, because of disputes of royal\r\nsuccession, between the McLoughlins of Ulster—a branch of the Hy-Niall\r\ndynasty—and the descendants of King Brian of Kinkora, in which the\r\nlatter were finally worsted. Then the successful family fell out with\r\nroyal O’Conors of Connaught. One of the latter, a brave and ambitious\r\nman, called Turlough Mor, aimed at the chief sovereignty and proved\r\nhimself an able general and a wise statesman. He reigned in splendor\r\nover Connaught, and terrorized his enemies of Ulster and Munster by his\r\nsplendid feats of arms. He held his court at Rathcroghan, in Roscommon,\r\nand often entertained as many as 3,000 guests on occasions of festival.\r\nHis palace, fortified after the circular Celtic fashion, dominated more\r\nthan four hundred forts, or duns, which were the strongholds of his\r\nchiefs, in the territory of Roscommon alone; he founded churches and was\r\ngenerous to the clergy and to the poor. In spite of all this, however,\r\nhe was unable to attain to the High Kingship, and only succeeded in\r\npaving the way to the national throne for his son and successor, Rory,\r\ncommonly called Roderick, O’Conor, whose reign was destined to behold\r\nthe Anglo-Normans in Ireland. Dr. Joyce, in dealing with this troubled\r\nperiod of Irish history, says that during the one hundred and fifty\r\nyears comprised in it, there were eight Ard-Righs “with opposition”—that\r\nis, some one of the provinces, perhaps more, would refuse to recognize\r\ntheir jurisdiction. There was also chaos among the minor royal families.\r\nAs regarded the High King, it was not unusual to have two of them using\r\nthat title at once, as was the case with Donal O’Loughlin, King of\r\nUlster, and Murtough O’Brien, King of Munster. Both these claimants\r\nterminated their careers in monasteries. A similar condition existed,\r\nalso, between Turlough Mor O’Conor, before mentioned, and Murtough\r\nO’Loughlin, King of Ulster, and the strife was only ended by the death\r\nof Turlough Mor, in 1156. His son, Roderick, then attempted to wrest the\r\nArd-Righship from the Ulster monarch, but was defeated. On the death of\r\nthe latter, in 1166, Roderick, who was not opposed by any candidate of\r\ninfluence, was elected High King—the last of the title who reigned over\r\nall Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, why did not the clansmen—the rank and file of the Irish\r\npeople—put a stop to the insane feuds of their kings, princes, and\r\nchiefs? Because, we answer, they were accustomed to the tribal system\r\nand idea. Doubtless, they loved Ireland, in a general way, but were much\r\nmore attached to their family tribe-land, and, above all, they adored\r\nthe head of their sept and followed where he led, asking no questions as\r\nto the ethics of his cause. Had they been more enlightened regarding the\r\nart of government, they might have combined against their selfish\r\nleaders and crushed them. But the tribal curse was upon them, and is not\r\nyet entirely lifted.\r\n\r\nThe Danes held the crown of England for about a quarter of a century\r\nafter they were driven from power in Ireland. At last, after great\r\ndifficulty, they were driven from the throne and the saintly Edward the\r\nConfessor, of the old Saxon line, was raised to the kingship of England.\r\nHis successor, King Harold—a brave but, we fear, not a very wise man—is\r\nsaid by English historians to have “done homage”—an evil custom of those\r\ndays—to William, Duke of Normandy, while on a visit to that country. At\r\nall events, William claimed the crown, which Harold, very properly,\r\ndeclined to surrender. William was an able and resolute, but fierce and\r\ncruel, warrior. He speedily organized a force of 60,000 mercenaries,\r\nmainly French-Normans, but with thousands of real Frenchmen among them,\r\nand, having provided himself with an immense flotilla—a wondrous\r\nachievement in that age of the world—succeeded in throwing his entire\r\nforce on the English coast. Harold, nothing daunted, met him on a heath\r\nnear Hastings, in Sussex, where the Saxon army had strongly intrenched\r\nitself, and would, perhaps, have been victorious had not it abandoned\r\nits position to pursue the fleeing Normans, who, with their accustomed\r\nmartial skill, turned upon their disordered pursuers and repulsed them\r\nin return. The centre of the great conflict is marked by the ruins of\r\nBattle Abbey. The two armies were about equal in strength and fought the\r\nwhole length of an October day before the combat was decided. Prodigies\r\nof valor were performed, but, at last, the brave Harold fell, and the\r\nremains of the Saxon army fled from that fatal field. William, soon\r\nafterward, occupied London. The Saxons made but small show of\r\nresistance, after Hastings, and, within a few years, “fair England” was\r\nparceled out among William’s Norman-French captains, who thus laid the\r\nfoundation of the baronial fabric that, with one brief interval, has\r\ndominated England ever since. A few of the Saxon nobles managed,\r\nsomehow, to save their domains—probably by swearing allegiance to\r\nWilliam and marrying their lovely daughters to his chiefs—but, as a\r\nwhole, the Saxon people became the serfs of the Norman barons, and were\r\nscarcely recognized even as subjects, until the long and bloody wars\r\nwith France, in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries,\r\nmade them necessary, in a military sense, to the Plantagenet kings, who\r\nemployed them chiefly as archers. Under Norman training, their skill\r\nwith the deadly long bow made them perhaps the most formidable infantry\r\nof the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nThe Normans in England, very wisely, accommodated themselves to the new\r\nconditions and made up their minds to live upon and enjoy the lands they\r\nhad won by the sword. They rapidly became more English than Norman, and\r\nafter the accession of the House of Anjou to the throne, in the person\r\nof Henry II, began to call themselves “Englishmen.” Sir Walter Scott, in\r\nhis noble historical romance of “Ivanhoe,” draws a splendidly vivid\r\npicture of that period.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, as we have seen, the series of distracting civil wars, all\r\ngrowing out of questions of succession to the national and provincial\r\nthrones, still progressed, and, owing to the unceasing discord,\r\nprosperity waned, and some historians claim that Church discipline was\r\nrelaxed, although not to any such extent as is asserted by the Norman\r\nchroniclers. But the reigning Pontiff, hearing of the trouble, summoned\r\nsome of the leading hierarchs of the Irish Church to Rome, where they\r\nexplained matters satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that Henry II, in virtue of his descent from the\r\nConqueror, through his mother, daughter of Henry I, assumed the English\r\ncrown, the Papal chair was occupied by Adrian the Fourth, whose worldly\r\nname was Nicholas Breakspeare, an Englishman by birth, and the only man\r\nof that nationality who ever wore the tiara. He, too, had been informed\r\nby Norman agents of the disorders in Ireland, where, among other things,\r\nit was claimed that the people in general had neglected to pay to the\r\nPapacy the slight tribute known as “Peter’s Pence.” This circumstance,\r\nno doubt, irritated the Pontiff, and when Henry, who had his ambitious\r\nheart set on acquiring the sovereignty of Ireland, laid open his design,\r\nPope Adrian, according to credible authority, gave him a document called\r\na “bull,” in which, it would appear, he undertook to “bestow” Ireland on\r\nthe English king, with the understanding that he should do his utmost to\r\nreform the evils in Church and State said to exist in that country, and\r\nalso compel the regular payment of the Papal tribute. All of which Henry\r\nagreed to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n     The Norman-Welsh Invasion of Ireland—Their Landing in Wexford\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPE ADRIAN’S “gift” of Ireland to Henry II, absurd as it may appear in\r\nthis age, was not without precedent in the Middle Ages, when the Roman\r\nPontiff was regarded as supreme arbiter by nearly all of Christendom.\r\nSuch “gifts” had been made before the time of Adrian, and some\r\nafterward, but they were not considered bona fide by the countries\r\ninvolved. So also with the Irish people as a majority. They respected,\r\nas they still respect, the Pope in his spiritual capacity, but rightly\r\nconceived that he had no power whatever to make a present of their\r\ncountry to any potentate, whether native or alien, without their\r\nconsent. An influential minority held otherwise, with most unfortunate\r\nresults, as we shall see. Some superzealous Catholic writers have sought\r\nto discredit the existence of the “bull” of Adrian, but weight of\r\nevidence is against them, and, in any case, it was “confirmed,” at\r\nHenry’s urgent request, by Pope Alexander III. The king was engaged in\r\ncivil war with his own sons—in every way worthy of their rapacious\r\nfather—during most of his reign, for he held under his sway Normandy,\r\nAquitaine, and other parts of France, which they wanted for themselves.\r\nThus no chance to push his long meditated Irish scheme presented itself\r\nuntil about A. D. 1168. Fifteen years prior to that date, Dermid, or\r\nDermot, MacMurrough (Mac Murro), King of Leinster, a very base and\r\ndissolute ruler, had carried off the wife of O’Ruarc, Prince of Breffni,\r\nwhile the latter was absent on a pious pilgrimage. The lady was a\r\nwilling victim, and added the dowry she brought her husband to the\r\ntreasure of her paramour. When Breffni returned to his castle and found\r\nthat his wife had betrayed him, he was overpowered by grief and anger,\r\nand, not having sufficient military force himself to punish his enemy,\r\nhe called on Turlough Mor O’Conor, then titular Ard-Righ, to assist him\r\nin chastising MacMurrough. O’Conor did so to such purpose that,\r\naccording to Irish annals, Dervorgilla, which was the name of O’Ruarc’s\r\nwife, together with her dowry, was restored to her husband, who,\r\nhowever, discarded her, and she died penitent, it is said, forty years\r\nafterward in the cloisters of Mellifont Abbey. But Dermid’s evil conduct\r\ndid not end with his outrage against O’Ruarc. He entertained the most\r\ndeadly animosity to the O’Conor family on account of the punishment\r\ninflicted on him by Turlough Mor, and when on the death in battle of\r\nArd-Righ Murtagh McLaughlin, Roderick, son of Turlough Mor, claimed the\r\nnational crown, MacMurrough refused him recognition, although nearly all\r\nthe other sub-kings had acknowledged him as supreme ruler of Ireland.\r\nIncensed at his stubbornness, King Roderick, who had with him O’Ruarc\r\nand other princes of Connaught, marched against Dermid, who, seeing that\r\nhe was overmatched, burned his palace of Ferns, and, taking to his\r\ngalley, crossed the Irish Sea to England and sought out King Henry II at\r\nhis Court of London. On arriving there he was informed that the king was\r\nin Aquitaine, and thither he at once proceeded. The politic founder of\r\nthe Plantagenet dynasty received him quite graciously and listened\r\ncomplacently to his story. Henry was secretly well pleased with the\r\ntreasonable errand of his infamous guest, which was to demand\r\nAnglo-Norman aid against his own monarch, regardless of the after\r\nconsequences to the fortunes of his country. He enumerated his\r\ngrievances at the hands of the O’Conors, father and son, and related how\r\nhe had been the faithful ally of the former in his long war with one of\r\nthe Thomond O’Briens. Turlough Mor, he considered, had treated him badly\r\nfor the sake of O’Ruarc, and his son, Roderick, had been quite as\r\nhostile, forcing him to seek Henry’s protection against further invasion\r\nof his hereditary patrimony. The Anglo-Norman king said, in reply, that\r\nhe could not aid MacMurrough in person as he was then engaged in a war\r\nwith one or more of his own sons, but he consented to give him\r\ncommendatory letters to certain Norman chiefs, brave but needy, who were\r\nsettled in Wales and the West of England, and had there made powerful\r\nmatrimonial alliances. The traitor gladly accepted the letters, “did\r\nhomage” to Henry, and took his leave elated at the partial success of\r\nhis unnatural mission. Landing in Wales, he found himself within a short\r\ntime in the presence of Richard De Clare, surnamed “Strongbow,” a brave,\r\nadventurous, and unscrupulous Norman noble, who bore the title of Earl\r\nof Pembroke. He also made the acquaintance of other Norman knights—among\r\nthem Robert Fitzstephen, Maurice De Prendergast, Maurice Fitzgerald,\r\nancestor of the famous Geraldine houses of Kildare and Desmond; Meyler\r\nFitzHenry and Raymond Le Gros—all tried warriors, all in reduced\r\ncircumstances, and all ready and willing to barter their fighting blood\r\nfor the fair hills and rich valleys of Ireland. They listened eagerly\r\nwhile MacMurrough unfolded his precious plot of treason and black\r\nrevenge. The daring adventurers seized upon the chance of fortune at\r\nonce, and the traitor was sent back to Ireland to prepare his hereditary\r\nfollowing for the friendly reception of “the proud invaders,” his newly\r\nmade allies. Before leaving Wales he had made bargains with the alien\r\nadventurers which were disgraceful to him as a native-born Irishman. In\r\na word, he had, by usurped authority, mortgaged certain tracts of the\r\nland of Leinster for the mercenary aid of the Anglo-Normans, or, to be\r\nmore historically exact, the Norman-Welsh.\r\n\r\nSoon after the departure of Dermid for Ireland, Robert Fitzstephen, the\r\nreadiest of the warlike plotters, and the first of the invaders, sailed\r\nfor that country at the head of thirty knights, sixty men in armor, and\r\nthree hundred light-armed archers. In the fragrant ides of May, 1169,\r\nthey landed on the Wexford coast, near Bannow, and thus,\r\ninconsequentially, began the Norman invasion of Ireland. De Prendergast\r\narrived the following day with about the same number of fighting men.\r\nOnly a few years ago, in removing some débris—the accumulation of\r\nages—near Bannow, the laborers found the traces of the Norman camp-fires\r\nof 1169 almost perfectly preserved. The two adventurers sent tidings of\r\ntheir arrival to MacMurrough without delay, and he marched at once, with\r\na powerful force of his own retainers to join them. All three, having\r\nunited their contingents, marched upon the city of Wexford, many of\r\nwhose inhabitants were lineal descendants of the Danes. They made a\r\ngallant defence, but were finally outmanœuvred, overpowered, and\r\ncompelled to capitulate. Other towns of less importance submitted under\r\nprotest to superior force. Indeed there seemed to be a total lack of\r\nmilitary foresight and preparedness in all that section of Ireland in\r\n1169. Fitzpatrick, Prince of Ossory, descended from that ally of the\r\nDanes who attacked the Dalcassians returning from Clontarf, alone\r\nopposed to the invaders a brave and even formidable front. He committed\r\nthe mistake of accepting a pitched battle with MacMurrough and his\r\nallies, and was totally defeated. King Roderick O’Conor, hearing of the\r\ninvasion, summoned the Irish military bodies to meet him at Tara. Most\r\nof them responded, but the Prince of Ulidia, MacDunlevy, took offence at\r\nsome remark made by a Connaught prince, and, in consequence, most of the\r\nUlster forces withdrew from the Ard-Righ. King Roderick, with the troops\r\nthat remained, marched to attack MacMurrough at his favorite stronghold\r\nof Ferns, where he lay with the Normans, or a part of them, expecting a\r\nvigorous siege. Instead of assaulting the enemy’s lines at once, when\r\nhis superior numbers would, most likely, have made an end of the traitor\r\nand his Norman allies, O’Conor weakly consented to a parley with Dermid,\r\nwho was a most thorough diplomat. The Ard-Righ consented, further, to a\r\ntreaty with MacMurrough, who, of course, designed to break it as soon as\r\nthe main body of the Normans, under Strongbow in person, should arrive\r\nfrom Wales. He did not, nevertheless, hesitate to bind himself by a\r\nsecret clause of the treaty with the king to receive no more foreigners\r\ninto his army, and even gave one of his sons as a hostage to guarantee\r\nthe same. The Ard-Righ retired from Ferns satisfied that the trouble was\r\nended. The royal army was scarcely out of sight of the place when\r\nMacMurrough learned that Maurice Fitzgerald, at the head of a strong\r\nparty of Normans, had also arrived on the Wexford coast. He now thought\r\nhimself strong enough to lay claim to the High Kingship and negotiated\r\nwith the Danes of Dublin for recognition in that capacity. Meanwhile,\r\nstill another Norman contingent under Raymond Le Gros landed at the\r\nestuary of Waterford, on the Wexford side thereof, and occupied\r\nDundonolf Rock, where they intrenched themselves and eagerly awaited the\r\ncoming of Strongbow with the main body of the Norman army.\r\n\r\nBy this time Henry II began to grow jealous of the success of his\r\nvassals in Ireland. He wanted to conquer the country for himself, and,\r\ntherefore, sent orders to Strongbow not to sail. But that hardy soldier\r\npaid no attention to Henry’s belated command, and sailed with a powerful\r\nfleet and army from Milford Haven, in Wales, arriving in Waterford\r\nHarbor on August 23, 1171. The Normans, under Raymond Le Gros, joined\r\nhim without loss of time, and the combined forces attacked the old\r\nDanish city. The Danes and native Irish made common cause against the\r\nnew enemy and a desperate and bloody conflict occurred. The Normans were\r\nseveral times repulsed, with great loss, but, better armed and led than\r\ntheir brave opponents, they returned to the breach again and yet again.\r\nAt last they gained entrance into the city, which they set on fire. An\r\nawful massacre ensued. Three hundred of the leading defenders were made\r\nprisoners, their limbs broken and their maimed bodies flung into the\r\nharbor. King MacMurrough, who had already pledged his daughter’s hand to\r\nStrongbow—a man old enough to have been her father—arrived just after\r\nthe city fell. In order to celebrate the event with due pomp and\r\ncircumstance, he caused the Princess Eva to be married to the Norman\r\nbaron in the great cathedral, while the rest of the city was burning,\r\nand the blood of the victims of the assault still smoked amid the ruins!\r\nAn ominous and fatal marriage it proved to Ireland.\r\n\r\nAnd now, at last, the blood of the native Irish was stirred to its\r\ndepths and they began, when somewhat late, to realize the danger to\r\ntheir liberty and independence. In those far-off days, when there were\r\nno railroads, no electric wires, no good roads or rapid means of\r\ncommunication of any kind, and when newspapers were unknown,\r\ninformation, as a matter of course, traveled slowly even in a small\r\ncountry, like Ireland. The woods were dense, the morasses fathomless,\r\nand, in short, the invaders had made their foothold firm in the east and\r\nsouth portions of the island before the great majority of the\r\nCeltic-Irish comprehended that they were in process of being subjugated\r\nby bold and formidable aliens. There had existed in Ireland from very\r\nancient times five main roads, all proceeding from the hill of Tara to\r\nthe different sections of the country. That called “Dala” ran through\r\nOssory into the province of Munster. The road called “Assail” passed on\r\ntoward the Shannon through Mullingar. The highway from Tara to Galway\r\nfollowed the esker, or small hill range, as it does in our own day, and\r\nwas called “Slighe Mor,” or great road; the road leading from Tara to\r\nDublin, Bray, and along the Wicklow and Wexford coasts was called\r\n“Cullin”; the highway leading into Ulster ran, probably, through\r\nTredagh, or Drogheda, Dundalk, Newry, and Armagh, but this is not\r\npositive. As it was the route followed by the English in most of their\r\nUlster wars, it is quite probable that they picked out a well-beaten\r\npath, so as to avoid the expense and labor of making a new causeway.\r\nMcGee tells us that there were also many cross-roads, known by local\r\nnames, and of these the Four Masters, at different dates, mentioned no\r\nless than forty. These roads were kept in repair, under legal enactment,\r\nand the main highways were required to be of sufficient width to allow\r\nof the passage of two chariots all along their course. We are further\r\ninformed that the principal roads were required by law to be repaired at\r\nseasons of games and fairs, and in time of war. At their best, to judge\r\nby the ancient chroniclers, most of them would be considered little\r\nbetter than “trails” through the mountains, moors, and forests in these\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nMacMurrough and Strongbow did not allow the grass to sprout under their\r\nfeet before marching in great force on Dublin. King Roderick, leading a\r\nlarge but ill-trained army, attempted to head them off, but was\r\noutgeneraled, and the enemy soon appeared before the walls of Leinster’s\r\nstronghold. Its Dano-Celtic inhabitants, cowed by the doleful news from\r\nWaterford, tried to parley; but Strongbow’s lieutenants, De Cogan and Le\r\nGros, eager for carnage and rich plunder, surprised the city, and the\r\nhorrors of Waterford were, in a measure, repeated. The Danish prince,\r\nOsculph, and most of his chief men escaped in their ships, but the\r\nNormans captured Dublin, and the English, except for a brief period in\r\nthe reign of James II, have held it from that sad day, in October, 1171,\r\nto this.\r\n\r\nRoderick O’Conor, that weak but well-meaning prince and bad general,\r\nretired into Connaught and sent word to MacMurrough to return to his\r\nallegiance, if he wished to save the life of his son, held as a hostage.\r\nThe brutal and inhuman traitor refused, and King Roderick, although\r\nhumane almost to a fault, had the unfortunate young man decapitated.\r\nThis was poor compensation for the loss of Waterford and Dublin. Those\r\npages of Irish history are all besmeared with slaughter.\r\n\r\nMany of the Irish chroniclers, who are otherwise severe on Norman\r\nduplicity, relate a story of chivalry, worthy of any age and people, in\r\nconnection with Maurice de Prendergast and the Prince of Ossory.\r\nStrongbow had deputed the former to invite the latter to a conference.\r\nThe Irish prince accepted. While the conference was in progress, De\r\nPrendergast learned that treachery was intended toward his guest. He\r\nimmediately rushed into Strongbow’s presence and swore on the hilt of\r\nhis sword, which was a cross, that no man there that day should lay\r\nhands on the Prince of Ossory. The latter was allowed to retire\r\nunmolested, and Prendergast and his followers escorted him in safety to\r\nhis own country. De Prendergast has been known ever since in Irish\r\nannals as “the Faithful Norman,” and his fidelity has made him the theme\r\nof many a bardic song and romantic tale.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n          Superior Armament of the Normans—Arrival of Henry II\r\n\r\n\r\nALTHOUGH two of the chief Irish cities had fallen to the invaders, the\r\nstruggle was not entirely abandoned by the Irish nation. Ulster and most\r\nof Connaught remained intact, and even in Munster and Leinster there\r\nwas, from time to time, considerable, although desultory, resistance to\r\nthe Anglo-Normans. The latter, clad in steel armor from head to foot,\r\nand possessing formidable weapons, had a great advantage over the\r\ncloth-clad Irish, although, of course, the latter greatly outnumbered\r\nthem. The weapons of the Irish were the skian, or short-sword—resembling\r\nthe Cuban machete—the javelin, and the battle-axe—the latter a terrible\r\narm at close quarters; but even the axe could not cope with the\r\nponderous Norman sword and the death-dealing long bow, with its\r\ncloth-yard shaft. In discipline and tactics, also, the Irish were\r\novermatched. In short, they were inferior to their enemies in everything\r\nbut numbers and courage. But all would have been redeemed had they but\r\nunited against the common foe.\r\n\r\nWhy they did not may be justly, as we think, attributed to the tribal\r\nsystem which taught the clans and tribes to be loyal to their particular\r\nchiefs rather than to their country as a whole; the absence of a fully\r\nrecognized federal head, and the vacillations of an honest and patriotic\r\nArd-Righ, who, noble and amiable of character, as he undoubtedly was,\r\nproved himself to be a bungling diplomat and an indifferent general. Had\r\nhis able and determined father, Turlough Mor, been on the Irish throne,\r\nand in the vigor of his life, when Strongbow landed, he would have made\r\nshort work of the Norman filibusters. The king seemed ever behind time\r\nin his efforts to stem the tide of invasion. He had rallied still\r\nanother army, and gained some advantages, when he was confronted by a\r\nnew enemy in the person of Henry II. This king, determined not to be\r\noutdone by his vassals, had ordered Strongbow, who, because of his\r\nmarriage with Eva MacMurrough, had assumed the lordship of Leinster, to\r\nreturn with all his chief captains to England, the penalty of refusal\r\nbeing fixed at outlawry. Strongbow attempted to placate the wrathful\r\nking and sent to him agents to explain his position, but the fierce and\r\ncrafty Plantagenet was not a man to be hoodwinked. He collected a\r\npowerful fleet and army, set sail from England, in October, 1171, and,\r\ntoward the end of that month, landed in state at Waterford, where\r\nStrongbow received him with all honor and did homage as a vassal. This\r\nwas the beginning of Ireland’s actual subjugation, for had the original\r\nNorman invaders refused to acknowledge Henry’s sovereignty, and, uniting\r\nwith the natives, kept Ireland for themselves, they would eventually, as\r\nin England, have become a component and formidable part of the nation,\r\nand proved a boon, instead of a curse, to the distracted country. The\r\nlanding of Henry put an end to such a hope, and with his advent began\r\nthat dependency on the English crown which has been so fatal to the\r\nliberty, the happiness, and the prosperity of “the most unfortunate of\r\nnations.”\r\n\r\nHenry having “graciously” received the submission of Strongbow and his\r\nconfederates, proceeded, at once—for he was a monarch of great energy—to\r\nmake a “royal progress” through the partially subdued portions of\r\nMunster and Leinster. He took care, in doing this, to show Pope Adrian’s\r\nmischievous “bull” to the Irish prelates and princes, some of whom, to\r\ntheir discredit be it confessed, bowed slavishly to the ill-considered\r\nmandate of the Pontiff. Many of the princes were even base enough to\r\ngive Henry “the kiss of peace,” when, instead, they should have rushed\r\nto arms to defend the honor and independence of their country. The\r\nprelates, trained to ecclesiastical docility, disgusted with the\r\neverlasting civil contentions of the country, and fearful of further\r\nunavailing bloodshed, had some feeble excuse for their ill-timed\r\nacquiescence, but what are we to say of those wretched Irish princes who\r\nso weakly and wickedly betrayed their nation to the foreign usurper?\r\nThey were by no means ignorant men, as times went, but they were\r\nambitious, vain, and jealous of the half-acknowledged authority of High\r\nKing Roderick, who, poor man, seems to have been the Henry VI of\r\nIreland. Those treasonable princes deserve enduring infamy, and foremost\r\namong them were Dermid McCarthy, King of Desmond, and Donald O’Brien,\r\nKing of Thomond. Both lived to regret most bitterly their cowardice and\r\ntreason.\r\n\r\nHenry II was a politic monarch. He flattered the pliable Irish bishops\r\nand spoke to them gently about Church reforms, while he palavered the\r\ndespicable Irish princes, and, at the same time, pretended to favor the\r\ncommon people and affected to check the rapacity of his Norman subjects.\r\nHostilities ceased for a time, except on the borders of Leinster and\r\nConnaught, where King Roderick, deserted by many of his allies, and\r\ndeeply depressed at the absence of national union against the invaders,\r\nkept up an unavailing resistance. In this he was encouraged and aided by\r\nthe patriotic Archbishop of Dublin, St. Lorcan O’Tuhill, who appears to\r\nhave been the only man among the entire Irish hierarchy who comprehended\r\nthe iron grip the Normans had on the throat of Ireland. Had all the\r\nprelates been like St. Lorcan, and preached a war of extermination\r\nagainst the invaders at the outset, Ireland could, undoubtedly, have\r\nthrown off the yoke, because the princes would have been forced by their\r\npeople, over whom the bishops had great moral sway, to heal their feuds\r\nand make common cause for their country. King Roderick, despite his\r\nerrors, deserves honor for his patriotic spirit. The Ulster princes,\r\ntoo, with few exceptions, stood out manfully against the foreigner, and\r\na long period elapsed before the Anglo-Norman power found a secure\r\nfooting amid the rugged glens and dense forests of the western and\r\nnorthern portions of the invaded island.\r\n\r\nGeraldus Cambrensis, or Gerald Barry, a Norman priest of Welsh birth,\r\naccompanied, A.D. 1185, King Henry’s son, John, as chronicler, to\r\nIreland. Like nearly every man of his race, he hated the native Irish,\r\nbut, occasionally, as if by accident, spoke well of some of them. In\r\ngeneral, however, his book is a gross libel on the Irish Church and the\r\nIrish people. He purports to give Roderick O’Conor’s address to his army\r\non the eve of battle with the Anglo-Normans, and the concluding words of\r\nthe speech are alleged to have been as follows: “Let us then,” said the\r\nIrish king, “following the example of the Franks, and fighting bravely\r\nfor our country, rush against our enemies, and as these foreigners have\r\ncome over few in numbers, let us crush them by a general attack. Fire,\r\nwhile it only sparkles, may be speedily quenched, but when it has burst\r\ninto a flame, being fed with fresh materials, its power increases with\r\nthe bulk, and it can not be easily extinguished. It is always best to\r\nmeet difficulties half way, and check the first approaches of disease,\r\nfor (the Latin quotation of the king is here translated)\r\n\r\n              “Too late is medicine, after long delay,\r\n               To stop the lingering course of slow decay.\r\n\r\nWherefore, defending our country and liberty, and acquiring for\r\nourselves eternal renown, let us, by a resolute attack, and the\r\nextermination of our enemies, though they are but few in number, strike\r\nterror into the many, and, by their defeat, evermore deter foreign\r\nnations from such nefarious attempts.”\r\n\r\nHenry’s astute policy disarmed, for a time, even Roderick himself. The\r\nAnglo-Norman monarch, who would have made an admirable modern\r\npolitician, does not seem to have desired the absolute ruin of the Irish\r\nnation, but his greedy Norman captains were of a different mind, and\r\nwhen Henry, after having wined and dined the Irish princes to their\r\nhearts’ content, in Dublin and other cities, at last returned to\r\nEngland, in the fall of 1173, the Norman leaders showed their teeth to\r\nthe Irish people, and forced most of those who had submitted into fierce\r\nrevolt. As a result, the Norman forces were crushed in the field.\r\nStrongbow, himself, was shut up in Waterford, and his comrades were\r\nsimilarly placed in Dublin, Drogheda, and Wexford. Henry, incensed at\r\nthis unlooked-for sequel to his Irish pilgrimage, sent over a commission\r\nto inquire into the facts. The result was that an Irish delegation went\r\nto London to explain, and, at Windsor, where Henry held his court, a\r\ntreaty was entered into, finally, between King Roderick and himself, by\r\nwhich the former acknowledged Henry as “suzerain,” and Roderick was\r\nrecognized as High King of Ireland, except the portions thereof held by\r\nthe Normans under Henry. This was a sad ending of Roderick’s heroic\r\nbeginning. As usual with English monarchs, when dealing with the Irish\r\npeople, Henry, urged by his greedy dependants in Ireland, soon found\r\nmeans to grossly violate the Treaty of Windsor, as the compact between\r\nthe representatives of Roderick and himself was called, thus vitiating\r\nit forever and absolving the Irish nation from observing any of its\r\nprovisions. Another fierce rebellion followed, in which the southern and\r\nwestern Irish—the Anglo-Normans having now grown more numerous and\r\npowerful—were remorselessly crushed. Roderick’s rascally son, Prince\r\nMurrough O’Conor, who thought his father should be satisfied with the\r\ntitular High Kingship, and that he himself should be King of Connaught,\r\nrose in revolt and attempted to seize the provincial crown. The\r\nConnacians, indignant at his baseness, stood by the old king. Murrough\r\nwas defeated and received condign punishment. This bad prince must have\r\nbeen familiar with the unseemly course pursued by the sons of Henry II\r\nin Normandy, for he allied himself with his country’s, and his father’s,\r\nenemies, the Anglo-Normans, under the treacherous De Cogan, and this\r\nact, more even than his filial impiety, inflamed the minds of his\r\ncountrymen against the unnatural miscreant. King Roderick, unhappy man,\r\nwhose pride was mortally wounded, and whose paternal heart, tender and\r\nmanly, was wrung with sorrow at the crime of his son and its\r\npunishment—decreed by the Clans and not by himself—disgusted, besides,\r\nwith the hopeless condition of Irish affairs, made up his mind to retire\r\nfrom the world, its pomps and vexations. He repaired to the ancient\r\nmonastery of Cong, in Galway, and there, after twelve years of pious\r\ndevotion, on the 29th day of November, 1198, in the 82d year of his age,\r\nthis good and noble but irresolute monarch surrendered his soul to God.\r\nHe was not buried at Cong, as some annalists have asserted, but in the\r\nchancel of the Temple Mor, or Great Church, of Clonmacnois, in the\r\npresent King’s County, where he was educated. Tradition has failed to\r\npreserve the location of the exact place of sepulture within the ruined\r\nshrine. And so ended the last Ard-Righ, or High King, that had swayed\r\nthe sceptre of an independent Ireland.\r\n\r\nKing Henry’s claim that the Irish Church needed great reformation is\r\ndisproved by the enactments of his own reign in that connection, viz.:\r\n1. That the prohibition of marriage within the canonical degrees of\r\nconsanguinity be enforced. 2. That children should be regularly\r\ncatechized before the church door in each parish. 3. That children\r\nshould be baptized in the public fonts of the parish churches. 4. That\r\nregular tithes should be paid to the clergy, rather than irregular\r\ndonations from time to time. 5. That church lands should be exempt from\r\nthe exaction of livery and other burdens. 6. That the clergy should not\r\nbe liable to any share of the eric, or blood fine, levied off the\r\nkindred of a man guilty of homicide. 7. A decree regulating the making\r\nof wills.\r\n\r\nSurely, this was small ground on which to justify the invasion of an\r\nindependent country and the destruction of its liberty!\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n Prince John “Lackland” Created “Lord” of Ireland—Splendid Heroism of Sir\r\n                            Armoricus Tristram\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY II, whatever may have been his original intentions toward Ireland\r\nand the Irish, soon after his return to England assumed the tone of a\r\nconqueror and dictator. He forgot, or appeared to forget, the treaty he\r\nhad concluded with King Roderick’s representatives at Windsor, which\r\ndistinctly recognized the tributary sovereignty of the Irish monarch,\r\nand left the bulk of the Irish people under the sway of their own native\r\nlaws and rulers. Now, however, he, in defiance of the commonest law of\r\nhonor, proclaimed his weakest and worst son, the infamous John, “Lord”\r\nof Ireland—a title retained by the English kings down to the reign of\r\nHenry VIII, who, being a wily politician, contrived to get himself\r\n“elected” as “King of Ireland.” This title remained with the English\r\nmonarchs until January 1, 1801, when the ill-starred legislative union\r\nwent into effect, and George III of England became king of the so-called\r\n“United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.”\r\n\r\nHenry II died in 1189, preceding the Irish king he had so deeply wronged\r\nto the grave by about nine years. His last hours were doubly imbittered\r\nby the discovery that his youngest son, John, who was also his favorite,\r\nand in whom he had concentrated all his paternal love and confidence,\r\nwas leagued with his enemies. An able, but thoroughly bad, man, Henry\r\nPlantagenet died a miserable death—his heart filled with rage against\r\nhis own rebellious offspring, who, no doubt, only practiced the\r\nperfidious policy inculcated by their miserable father. The death scene\r\noccurred at Chinon, in Aquitaine, and his last words, uttered in the\r\nFrench tongue, and despite the vehement protests of the surrounding\r\necclesiastics, were, “Accursed be the day on which I was born, and\r\naccursed of God be the sons I leave after me!” His curse did not fall on\r\nsticks and stones. All of his guilty sons, except John, died violent and\r\nuntimely deaths. Lackland, the exception, died of an overdose of pears\r\nand fresh cider, added to grief over the loss of his treasure, which\r\nsunk in a quicksand while he was marching with his guard along the\r\nEnglish coast. Henry’s curse remained with the Plantagenets to the end,\r\nand most of the princes of that family met a horrible doom, from Edward\r\nII, foully murdered in Berkeley Castle, to the last male Plantagenet, of\r\nlegitimate origin, the Earl of Warwick, beheaded by order of Henry VII\r\nin 1499. Strongbow, Henry’s chief tool in the acquirement of Ireland,\r\ndied of a dreadful blood malady, which, the doctors said, resembled\r\nleprosy, some years before the king. He is buried in Christ Church\r\nCathedral, Dublin, and beside him are said to rest the relics of his\r\nonly son, killed by the ferocious father’s hand, because he fled from\r\nthe Irish in some border battle.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this chapter we may be allowed to remark that Richard\r\nIII, when he had his nephews murdered in the Tower of London, in 1483,\r\ncame legitimately by his cruel nature. John Lackland was the progenitor\r\nof all the Plantagenets who succeeded him on the English throne, and,\r\nlike his direct descendant, Richard Crookback, was a usurper, because\r\nPrince Arthur, son of his elder brother, Geoffrey Plantagenet, was\r\nlineal heir to the throne. History and tradition agree in saying that\r\nJohn caused Prince Arthur to be murdered, and some historians say that\r\nhe was the actual murderer. He was the only coward of his race, and was,\r\nalso, frivolous and deliberately ill-mannered. When on a visit to\r\nIreland, in the supposed interest of his father, he caused a revolt\r\namong the Irish chiefs who called upon him, by pulling their long beards\r\nand otherwise insulting them. Those cringing chiefs deserved the\r\ntreatment they received, but John Lackland, as he was dubbed, is not,\r\ntherefore, excusable for having acted toward them as a boor and a\r\nruffian. Later on, when he became King of England, he again visited\r\nIreland, and built many strong castles. That of Limerick, called King\r\nJohn’s Castle, is still almost perfectly preserved, and is a superb\r\nrelic of Norman military architecture. As the Irish were not provided\r\nwith armament, or appliances, for making a successful siege, the\r\nfortresses built by King John were, so far as they were concerned,\r\nvirtually impregnable. Whenever the Normans were vanquished in the\r\nfield, they retired to their castles, which were amply provisioned, and\r\ndefied the vengeance of their foes.\r\n\r\nIn the last year of the reign of Henry II, there occurred in Ireland one\r\nof those memorable combats which deserve a lasting place in history, not\r\nso much because of any important reform or social or political blessing\r\nof any kind resulting from them, but as tending to show that warrior\r\nmen, in all ages, have often been chivalrous and self-sacrificing. The\r\nNorman race—glorious as has been its record all over Europe and\r\nPalestine—never evinced greater bravery than on the Woody field of\r\nKnocktuagh (Nockthoo), “the Hill of Axes,” in Galway, A.D. 1189. Sir\r\nJohn De Courcy, hard pressed in Ulster by the fiercely resisting septs\r\nof the north, asked aid from his sworn friend and comrade, Sir Armoricus\r\nTristram—ancestor of the family of St. Lawrence, Earls of Howth—then\r\nserving in Connaught. Tristram had with him, according to some accounts,\r\nthirty knights, one hundred men-at-arms, mounted, and one hundred\r\nlight-armed infantry; according to other statements, he had under his\r\ncommand thirty cavalry and two hundred foot. This force Cathal O’Conor,\r\nafterward known as “the Red-Handed,” Prince of the royal house of\r\nConnaught—a most valiant and skilful general, who was younger brother,\r\nborn out of wedlock, of King Roderick, then virtually in the retirement\r\nof the cloisters of Cong Abbey—led into an ambush, and attacked with a\r\nsuperior force. Sir Armoricus saw at a glance that escape was hopeless,\r\nand that only one refuge was left for him and his following—to die with\r\nhonor. Some of his horsemen, tradition says, proposed to cut their way\r\nout and leave the infantry to their fate. Against this mean proposition\r\nSir Armor’s brother and other knights vehemently protested. “We have\r\nbeen together in many dangers,” they said; “now let all of us fight and\r\ndie together.” Sir Armor, by way of answer, alighted from his steed,\r\ndrew his sword and, with it, pierced the noble charger to the heart. All\r\nthe other horsemen, except two youths, who were detailed to watch the\r\nfight from a distant hill, and report the result to De Courcy in Ulster,\r\nimmediately followed their glorious leader’s example. Tradition asserts\r\nthat the two young men who made their escape, by order, were Sir\r\nArmoricus’s son and the squire of De Courcy, who brought the latter’s\r\nmessage to Tristram. Having completed the slaughter of their horses, the\r\nlittle band of Normans formed themselves in a phalanx, and marched\r\nboldly to attack the outnumbering Irish. The latter met the shock with\r\ntheir usual courage, but the enemy, clad in armor, cut their way deeply\r\nand fatally into the crowded ranks of their cloth-clad foes. The Irish\r\npoet, Arthur Gerald Geoghegan (Geh’ogan), thus graphically and\r\ntruthfully describes the dreadful encounter:\r\n\r\n “Then rose the roar of battle loud, the shout, the cheer, the cry!\r\n  The clank of ringing steel, the gasping groans of those who die;\r\n  Yet onward still the Norman band right fearless cut their way,\r\n  As move the mowers o’er the sward upon a summer’s day.\r\n\r\n “For round them there, like shorn grass, the foe in hundreds bleed;\r\n  Yet, fast as e’er they fall, each side, do hundreds more succeed;\r\n  With naked breasts undaunted meet the spears of steel-clad men,\r\n  And sturdily, with axe and skian, repay their blows again.\r\n\r\n “Now crushed with odds, their phalanx broke, each Norman fights alone,\r\n  And few are left throughout the field, and they are feeble grown,\r\n  But high o’er all, Sir Tristram’s voice is like a trumpet heard,\r\n  And still, where’er he strikes, the foemen sink beneath his sword.\r\n\r\n “But once he raised his visor up—alas, it was to try\r\n  If Hamo and his boy yet tarried on the mountain nigh,\r\n  When sharp an arrow from the foe pierced right through his brain,\r\n  And sank the gallant knight a corse upon the bloody plain.\r\n\r\n “Then failed the fight, for gathering round his lifeless body there,\r\n  The remnant of his gallant band fought fiercely in despair;\r\n  And, one by one, they wounded fell—yet with their latest breath,\r\n  Their Norman war-cry shouted bold—then sank in silent death.”\r\n\r\nWhen Cathal Mor finally became King of Connaught, he caused a monastery,\r\nwhich he called “the Abbey of Victory,” but which has been known to the\r\nIrish of Connaught for ages as “Abbey Knockmoy,” to be erected on or\r\nnear the site of the battle. Tradition, not a very reliable guide, fails\r\nto exactly define the scene of Cathal’s victory over the Normans.\r\nKnocktuagh, an inconsiderable eminence, is within a few miles of the\r\ncity of Galway, whereas Knockmoy, where stands the historic abbey, is\r\nfully twelve miles east of that ancient borough, on the highroad to\r\nAthlone. Cathal of the Red Hand fought many battles and won many\r\nsplendid victories, although he occasionally sustained defeats at the\r\nhands of the Normans and their traitorous native allies; his greatest\r\nvictory was won over his bitter rival, albeit his nephew, Caher Carragh\r\nO’Conor, whom he encountered somewhere in the county of Galway. There\r\nwas an awful slaughter on both sides, but Cathal prevailed, and, no\r\ndoubt, built the abbey on the spot where Caher and his leading\r\nchieftains, Irish and Norman, fell. De Courcy was the only foreigner\r\nallied with Cathal Mor in this great battle. Abbey Knockmoy is one of\r\nthe most interesting of Irish ruins, and contains friezes and frescoing\r\nmost creditable to Irish art in the thirteenth century. The victory gave\r\nCathal Mor the undisputed sway of Connaught. Adopting the policy of the\r\ninvaders, for the benefit of his country, he used Norman against Norman;\r\nallied himself with Meyler FitzHenry, the last of Strongbow’s\r\nlieutenants, to punish Connaught’s inveterate foe, William de Burgo,\r\nancestor of the Clanricardes in Limerick, and to humble the pride of the\r\nambitious De Lacys in Leinster. In 1210, this gallant Irish monarch\r\ncompelled King John of England to treat with him as an independent\r\nsovereign, and, while he lived, no Norman usurper dared to lord it over\r\nhis kingdom of Connaught. Like his royal father and brother, he was a\r\nchampion of the Irish Church, and was a liberal founder and endower of\r\nreligious houses. Had the Connacian kings who followed been of his moral\r\nand military calibre, the Normans could never have ruled in Connaught.\r\nNor did this great Irishman confine himself to his native kingdom alone;\r\nhe also assisted the other provinces in resisting foreign encroachment.\r\nEven in his old age, when the De Lacys tried to embarrass his reign by\r\nfortifying Athleague, so as to threaten him in flank, the dauntless\r\nhero, at the head of his hereditary power, marched from his palace of\r\nBallintober, made two crossings of the river Suck, and, by a bold\r\nmanœuvre, came on the rear of the enemy, compelling them to retreat in\r\nall haste across the Shannon into Leinster. He did not fail to raze\r\ntheir forts at Athleague to the ground. This was the last of his\r\ncountless exploits. His time was drawing nigh, and, according to the\r\nFour Masters, “signs appeared in the heavens” which foretold his death.\r\nIn 1223, Cathal’s load of age and care became too heavy, and he resigned\r\nthe crown of Connaught to his son, Hugh. The old king, assuming the\r\nhabit of the Franciscans, retired to the Abbey of Knockmoy, and there\r\nexpired, mourned by his country and respected by its enemies, A.D. 1224.\r\nTradition still points to his tomb amid the majestic ruins of that\r\nvenerable pile. His death was the signal for the rise of Norman power in\r\nConnaught, and for the final deposition by the alien De Burgos of the\r\nroyal race of O’Conor.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n Ireland Under the Earlier Edwards—The Younger Bruce Elected King by the\r\n         Irish—Battle of Athenry—Death of Bruce at Faughart Hill\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER the death of King John, affairs in Ireland proceeded tamely enough\r\nuntil the repeated encroachments of the Anglo-Norman settlers and their\r\nprogeny, who occupied chiefly a comparatively small district called “the\r\nPale,” which consisted of most of the present counties of Dublin, Louth,\r\nMeath, Westmeath, Kildare, and Kilkenny, forced the native Irish to rise\r\n“in rude but fierce array” against them. The Norman family of De Lacy\r\ndisputed supremacy in Leinster with the Fitzgeralds, or Geraldines, but\r\nthe latter, finally, outshone their rivals both in court and camp. The\r\nDe Courcys, headed by the bold and chivalrous Sir John, “of that ilk,”\r\nmade some impression on the coast of Ulster. The De Burgos, ancestors of\r\nall the Irish Burkes, became powerful in Connaught, and the old Irish,\r\nheaded by the O’Conors, fought against them fiercely from time to time.\r\nBut the gallant, if covetous, Norman captains beheld the Irish maidens,\r\nand saw that they were fair. Love-making, despite frequent feuds,\r\nprogressed between Norman lord and Celtic virgin; and not uncommonly\r\nbetween Irish prince and Norman lady. Many “mixed marriages” resulted,\r\nand, naturally, racial animosities became greatly softened, “for love\r\nwill still be lord of all.” Very soon the warrior Normans, who\r\nacknowledged but a doubtful allegiance to the English monarch, began to\r\nassume Irish manners, wear the Irish costume, and speak in the Gaelic\r\ntongue. All this did not suit the English policy, and the Norman Irish\r\nwere often described by their kindred across the sea as “Degenerate\r\nEnglish.” It was written of the Fitzgeralds, in particular, that they\r\nhad grown “more Irish than the Irish.” This alarmed England, for it\r\nbegan to look as if Norman and Celt in Ireland would soon make common\r\ncause against her power. But many Norman chiefs were land hungry, and\r\nmany of the Irish princes were fierce and filled with a just wrath\r\nagainst their invaders. Gradually, therefore, the Geraldines swept all\r\nbefore them in Kildare and Desmond, for they were very warlike, and many\r\nnative Irish joined their fortunes to theirs, because of “fosterage” and\r\nother interests. The Butlers possessed themselves of large tracts of\r\ncountry in the present counties of Kilkenny and Tipperary, and became\r\nEarls of Ormond; and the De Burgos, as Earls of Clanricarde, became, in\r\ngreat part, masters of Galway, Mayo, and other parts of the province of\r\nConnaught. Factions among the Celtic chiefs made their conquests easy.\r\nThe Normans, wily as they were brave, fostered these feuds, and were\r\nparticularly delighted when the formidable O’Neills and O’Donnells of\r\nUlster wasted their strength in internecine strife. The politic\r\nforeigners occasionally allied themselves to either one of the\r\ncontending septs, and generally succeeded in outwitting both\r\ncontestants. Yet, as time wore on, the Norman warriors, forgetting their\r\nfathers’ speech, shouted their battle cries in the Gaelic tongue, and,\r\nexcept for their armor, could hardly be distinguished from the Celts.\r\n\r\nHenry III paid but small attention to Irish affairs. He ascended the\r\nEnglish throne a minor, and his mature years were spent mainly in\r\nrepeated civil wars with his barons, who finally compelled him to extend\r\nand confirm the Magna Charta of his father. His son, Edward I, nicknamed\r\n“Long Shanks,” the ablest king of the Plantagenet race, was almost\r\nconstantly occupied, during his stirring reign, in wars of conquest\r\nagainst Wales and Scotland, and he succeeded in annexing the first-named\r\ncountry to the English crown. His son and successor, Edward II, was the\r\nfirst English Prince of Wales. This Edward inherited the Scotch war\r\nwhich his father had left unfinished, after great effusion of blood. In\r\n1314, his great English army, said to have numbered 100,000 knights,\r\narchers, and men-at-arms, was disastrously routed at Bannockburn\r\n(“Oaten-cake rivulet”), near Sterling, by King Robert Bruce, of\r\nScotland, who had under his command not more than 30,000 men, horse and\r\nfoot. This great victory did not entirely end the Anglo-Scotch wars,\r\nwhich were always bitter and bloody down to the close of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, but it preserved the independence of Scotland for nearly four\r\nhundred years. That country ceased to be a separate nation in 1707. Many\r\nIrish clans of Ulster aided Bruce at Bannockburn, and some Connaught\r\nsepts, under one of the O’Conors, fought on the English side, and were\r\nnearly exterminated, which “served them right.” As the Irish princes\r\ncould not settle on one of their own number for High King, they, at the\r\nsuggestion of the wise and generous Donald O’Neill, King of Ulster,\r\nagreed to elect Edward Bruce, brother of the Scotch monarch, king of all\r\nIreland. Their proffer of the Irish throne was accepted by the Bruces,\r\nand Edward was duly crowned in 1315. This provoked a destructive three\r\nyears’ war. Brave King Robert came to Ireland to aid his brother, and,\r\nin the field, they swept all before them, particularly in Munster. But\r\nthe Norman-Irish fought them bitterly, notably the Geraldines, the\r\nBerminghams, and De Burgos. Felim O’Conor, the young and gallant king of\r\nConnaught, was forced into a repugnant alliance with De Burgo, who was\r\npowerful in the west. His heart, however, was with the Bruce, and he\r\nsoon found an opportunity to break away from his repugnant Norman ally.\r\nSummoning all his fighting force, he marched upon the fortified town of\r\nAthunree, or Athenry, “the Ford of the Kings,” in Galway, and came up\r\nwith the Anglo-Norman army, arrayed outside the walls, on the morning of\r\nAugust 10, 1316. De Burgo and De Bermingham, two able veteran soldiers,\r\nheaded the Anglo-Normans. The conflict was fierce and the slaughter\r\nappalling, particularly on the Irish side, because the heroic clansmen\r\ndid not have, like their foes, the advantage of chain armor and long bow\r\narchery. Night closed upon a terrible scene. The Irish refused to fly\r\nand died in heaps around the lifeless body of their chivalric young\r\nking, who, with twenty-eight princes of his house, proudly fell on that\r\nbloody field. Most of the Irish army perished—the loss being usually\r\nestimated at 10,000 men. The Anglo-Normans also suffered severely, but\r\ntheir armor proved the salvation of most of them. Connaught did not\r\nrecover from this great disaster for many generations. Athenry proved\r\nfatal to the cause of Bruce, although, gallantly seconded by Donald\r\nO’Neill, he fought on for two years longer, but was at last killed in\r\nbattle on Faughart Hill, in Louth, A.D. 1318. With him disappeared, for\r\nthat century at least, the hope of an independent Ireland.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Athenry, the power of the De Burgo family, and of\r\nall the allies of their house, became predominant in Connaught, but all\r\nthese Anglo-Norman chiefs became, also, much more Irish in manners and\r\nsympathy than they had ever been before. The desperate bravery displayed\r\nby O’Conor’s clansmen had aroused the admiration of those born warriors,\r\nand they felt that to ally themselves in marriage with so martial a race\r\nwas an honor, not a degradation, such as the English sought to make it\r\nappear. Ulster maintained its independence, and so also did much of\r\nConnaught and portions of Munster and Leinster, and there were\r\nperiodical raids upon the Pale and carrying off of “Saxon” flocks and\r\nherds, followed by feasts and general jubilation. The Palesmen, whenever\r\ntoo weak to meet the Celts in the field, would resort to their\r\ntime-honored strategy of shutting themselves up in their strongholds,\r\nand making, whenever opportunity offered, fierce retaliatory raids on\r\nthe Irish territory. This kind of warfare was unfortunate for Ireland,\r\nbecause it kept the English feeling strong in the hearts of the\r\nPalesmen, who were constantly recruited by fresh swarms of adventurers\r\nfrom England. Outside of the Pale, however, the Old Irish and the\r\nNormans continued to affiliate and intermarry, as we have already said.\r\nFosterage—a peculiarly Irish custom, which meant that the children of\r\nthe king, prince, or chief should be nursed by the wives of the\r\nclansmen, instead of their own mothers—grew apace, and nearly every\r\nNorman lord had his heirs suckled by the women of the Celtic race, thus\r\ncreating a bond of “kinship”—if so it may be termed—in many instances\r\nstronger than even the brotherhood of blood.\r\n\r\nIrish tradition abounds in examples of the devotion of foster-brethren\r\nto each other; and in all written history there is given but one\r\ninstance of treachery in this connection, and that instance does not\r\ninvolve a man of Celtic, but of Latin, lineage. We refer to the betrayal\r\nof Lord Thomas Fitzgerald by Parez in the reign of Henry VIII, which\r\nwill be dealt with in the proper place.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n      Prince Lionel Viceroy for Edward III—The Statute of Kilkenny\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD III, that valiant, vigorous, and ambitious “English” king—he was\r\nalmost a pure-blooded Frenchman and about the last Norman monarch who\r\noccupied the throne of England that did not speak with fluency the\r\nlanguage of the people he governed—was so occupied with his unjust wars\r\nagainst France that he gave but small heed to Irish affairs and never\r\nvisited the island at all. But he sent over his third son, Prince\r\nLionel, ancestor of the royal house of York and Clarence, as viceroy.\r\nLionel had with him a well-equipped army of native-born English, but he\r\ntreated his Anglo-Irish allies so contemptuously that many fell away\r\nfrom him and joined the ranks of the Old Irish. His English army,\r\nunaccustomed to the Irish climate and mode of warfare, made but a poor\r\nfigure in the field, and was everywhere beaten by the dauntless Irish\r\nclansmen. At last he was compelled to lower his imperious tone to the\r\nAnglo-Irish and these foolishly helped him out of his scrape. It is said\r\nthat a more than doubtful campaign in the present county of Clare\r\nprocured for him, from his flatterers, the title of Duke of Clarence—a\r\ntitle, by the way, which brought more or less misfortune to every\r\nEnglish prince who has borne it, except William IV, from his day to our\r\nown.\r\n\r\nLionel was particularly jealous of the friendship which seemed to exist\r\nbetween old Anglo-Irish and the old Celtic-Irish, and his small mind\r\nconceived a method of putting an end to it. He summoned a parliament to\r\nmeet at Kilkenny, and there it was enacted, among other things, “that\r\nall intermarriages, fosterings, gossipred, and buying or selling with\r\nthe (Irish) enemy shall be accounted treason; that English names,\r\nfashions, and manners (most of these having disappeared) shall be\r\nresumed under penalty of confiscation of the delinquent’s lands; that\r\nMarch laws (Norman) and Brehon laws (Irish) are illegal, and that there\r\nshall be no laws but English laws; that the Irish shall not pasture\r\ntheir cattle on English lands; that the English shall not entertain\r\nIrish rhymers, minstrels, or newsmen, and, moreover, that no ‘mere\r\nIrishman’ shall be admitted to any ecclesiastical benefice or religious\r\nhouse (England was then all Catholic) situated within the English\r\ndistrict.”\r\n\r\nOther provisions of the Statute of Kilkenny, as this precious “law” is\r\ncalled in Irish history, forbade the wearing of long hair, mustaches,\r\nand cloaks, after the manner of the Irish, and the use of the Gaelic\r\nspeech was also forbidden, under heavy penalties. With their usual\r\nsubserviency to English demands, the Anglo-Irish barons of the Pale—the\r\nportion of Ireland held by the English settlers, as already\r\nexplained—passed this barbarous enactment without opposition, although\r\nthey themselves were the chief “offenders” against it, in the eyes of\r\nthe tyrannical viceroy.\r\n\r\nTo the honor of the Anglo-Normans and Celtic-Irish be it remembered, the\r\nbase statute became almost immediately inoperative, and the Norman lords\r\nand Irish ladies, and the Irish princes and the Norman ladies,\r\nintermarried more numerously than before—an example generally followed\r\nby their dependants. The gallant house of Fitzgerald, or Geraldine, as\r\nusual, set the example of disregard.\r\n\r\n  “These Geraldines! These Geraldines! Not long her air they breathed—\r\n  Not long they fed on venison in Irish water seethed—\r\n  Not often had their children been by Irish mothers nursed,\r\n  When from their full and genial hearts an Irish feeling burst!\r\n  The English monarch strove in vain, by law and force and bribe,\r\n  To win from Irish thoughts and ways this ‘more than Irish’ tribe;\r\n  For still they clung to fosterage—to Brehon, cloak, and bard—\r\n  No king dare say to Geraldine: ‘Your Irish wife discard!’”\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of the Statute of Kilkenny was to temporarily unite\r\nmost of the Irish clans against the common enemy. They fell fiercely\r\nupon the Pale and again shut up the Normans in their fortresses. Prince\r\nLionel returned to England grieved and humiliated. His viceroyalty had\r\nbeen a signal failure.\r\n\r\nThroughout the viceroyalty of Clarence and his successor, William de\r\nWindsor, the desultory war between the Old Irish and the Anglo-Normans\r\nmade many districts, in all the provinces, red with slaughter. The power\r\nof the De Burgos declined in Connaught after the death of the warlike\r\nRed Earl, who was the scourge of the O’Conors, and the latter family\r\nbrought his descendants, who had assumed the name of MacWilliam, under\r\ntheir sway. The fierce tribes of Wicklow, Wexford, and Carlow harried\r\nthe Pale, and were frequently joined by the O’Mores of Leix, and the\r\nFitzpatricks of Ossory. In Ulster, Niel O’Neill, Prince of Tyrone,\r\nattacked and defeated the English armies and garrisons with so much\r\nsuccess that he cleared Ulster of all foreigners, and won the title of\r\nNiel the Great. The Earl of Desmond met with a severe defeat at the\r\nhands of O’Brien, Prince of Thomond, who assailed him near the abbey of\r\nAdare in Limerick, and routed his army with terrible carnage. Desmond\r\nhimself was mortally wounded and died upon the field. The Earl of\r\nKildare, Desmond’s kinsman, attempted to avenge his rout, but met with\r\nscant success, because the Irish had, by this time, grown used to the\r\nNorman method of warfare, and, in many cases, improved upon the tactics\r\nof their oppressors.\r\n\r\nEdward III, just before his death in 1376, attempted to get the\r\nsettlements of the Pale to send representatives to London to consult\r\nabout the affairs of Ireland, but they demurred, saying that it was not\r\ntheir custom to deliberate outside of their own country. However, they\r\nsent delegates to explain matters to the king, who did not further\r\ninsist on convening a Pale Parliament in the English capital. It is\r\nstrange that so able a monarch as Edward was, even in his declining\r\nyears, never thought of visiting Ireland. Of course, most of his reign\r\nwas taken up with the wars in France, in which he proved so signally\r\nvictorious, and he had but little time for other occupations. In truth,\r\nEdward III, although nominally English, was, in reality, a Frenchman in\r\nthought and speech, and his dearest dream was to rule over the country\r\nof his Plantagenet ancestors, with England as a kind of tributary\r\nprovince. Of course, the English people would never have acquiesced in\r\nthis arrangement, for, however willing to impose their yoke on other\r\npeoples, they are unalterably opposed to having any foreign yoke imposed\r\nupon themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n             Richard II’s Invasions—Heroic Art MacMurrough\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE first half of the fourteenth century passed away quietly enough in\r\nIreland, except for occasional conflicts between the Anglo-Normans and\r\nthe Celtic tribes, or an odd encounter of the latter with one another.\r\nEdward III had so many quarrels with Scotland and France that he could\r\ndo nothing in Ireland, even were he so inclined, and the sad experience\r\nof the Duke of Clarence in that country warned succeeding viceroys to\r\nlet well enough alone. The Irish nation, Celtic, Norman, and Saxon, was\r\ngradually fusing and would soon have developed a composite strength\r\nnearly equal to that of England herself. In the wars with France, many\r\nAnglo-Irish septs fought under the orders of Edward, and, probably, some\r\nof the Celtic septs also joined his standard, rather as allies, through\r\nthe bad policy of their chiefs, than as mercenaries.\r\n\r\nBy the time that Edward completed, or nearly so, the conquest of France,\r\nthe English power in Ireland had so shrunken as to be almost nominal.\r\nDublin, Drogheda, Kilkenny, and Waterford were the chief garrisons of\r\nthe English. The Lacys, Burkes, Fitzgeralds, and other Norman-Irish\r\nhouses and clans were scarcely to be distinguished from the Milesian\r\nfamilies and septs. Such fighting as they indulged in between themselves\r\nwas comparatively trivial. The island, blessed with partial peace, began\r\nto grow more populous and prosperous. Edward, the Black Prince, having\r\ncrowned himself with glory in France, died before he could inherit the\r\ncrown of England. Edward III, not so old as worn out by ceaseless\r\nwarfare, died in 1377, and after him came to the English throne Richard,\r\nson of the Black Prince, a handsome boy of sixteen, who, at first, gave\r\npromise of great deeds, but who subsequently proved himself a weakling\r\nand voluptuary. In Ireland, Ulster, Connaught, and Munster remained\r\ntranquil for the most part, but, in Leinster, the royal house of\r\nMacMurrough—lineal descendants of the traitor of Strongbow’s time—showed\r\na determination to drive the remnant of the English garrison into the\r\nsea. They were as loyal to Ireland as their accursed ancestor had been\r\nfaithless. King Art I, after a long series of successes and failures,\r\ndied, and was succeeded on the Leinster throne by King Art II—one of the\r\nbravest, wisest, and truest characters in Irish history. He continued\r\nthe war his father had begun. Richard II, like all of his race, was vain\r\nand greedy of military glory. As the war with France had closed for a\r\nperiod, he thought Ireland a good field in which to distinguish himself\r\nas a general. He had heard of “MacMore,” as he called MacMurrough, and\r\nlonged to measure swords with him. Accordingly, in the summer of 1394,\r\nhe landed at Waterford with a large army. The historian McGee estimates\r\nit at 35,000 horse and foot, but we are inclined to think it was much\r\nless. That it was formidable, for those times, all historians who have\r\ndealt with the subject are agreed upon. He was accompanied, also, by a\r\nlarge retinue of nobility, among them Roger Mortimer, the young Earl of\r\nMarch, who, because of the childlessness of Richard, was heir to the\r\nBritish throne, through descent from the Duke of Clarence, in the female\r\nline. Richard did not wait long in Waterford, but proceeded on his march\r\nto Dublin, unfurling the banner of Edward the Confessor, for whom the\r\nIrish were supposed to have a deep veneration. MacMurrough, however,\r\nshowed scant courtesy to the Confessor’s ensign, not because it was the\r\nbanner of a saint, but because, for the time, it represented the\r\nrapacity of England. Richard was met boldly at every point. His bowmen\r\ngot tangled up in the woods. His horsemen floundered in the bogs.\r\nMacMurrough’s army hovered in his front, on his flanks, and in rear. Not\r\na single success did the English monarch gain. He summoned MacMurrough\r\nto a conference when he reached Dublin—having lost a third of his army\r\nwhile en route—and the Leinster king, having accepted the invitation,\r\nwas ruthlessly thrown into prison. After a time, a treaty of some kind\r\nwas patched up between King Richard and himself, and the Irish prince\r\nwas allowed to go free. Richard then returned to England, leaving Roger\r\nMortimer in command. Soon afterward, MacMurrough, objecting to the\r\nEnglish encroachments in his territory, again rose in arms. He\r\nencountered Mortimer and the English army on the banks of the King’s\r\nRiver at Kenlis or Kells in Westmeath, and utterly routed them.\r\nEngland’s heir-apparent was among the slain. This circumstance had much\r\nto do with bringing about the bloody Wars of the Roses in the succeeding\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Art MacMurrough and his chief bard, who, as was then the\r\nIrish custom, accompanied his patron everywhere, were invited to a\r\nbanquet by one of the Norman lords, who treacherously pretended\r\nfriendship. The invitation was accepted. While seated at a window of the\r\nbanquet-hall, the bard perceived a mustering of troops around the\r\ncastle, and at once seized his harp and struck the chords to an ancient\r\nIrish air. The Gaelic words which accompanied the measure fell upon the\r\nears of Art MacMurrough and warned him of his danger. His sword and\r\nbuckler hung near by. On some trivial pretext, he arose and seized them,\r\nthe bard having, meanwhile, armed himself. The two made a sudden\r\nonslaught and, surprising their foes, cut their way to the courtyard,\r\nwhere, fortunately, their horses still stood. They sprang upon them,\r\nand, before the astonished men-at-arms could rally, made good their\r\nescape. Art MacMurrough never again trusted the English, and remained\r\ntheir consistent foe to his latest hour.\r\n\r\nBut King Richard, maddened by the death of Mortimer, which he felt was\r\ndangerous to himself, raised another great army, and, in 1398, again\r\ninvaded Ireland. He was accompanied by a younger son of his uncle, John\r\nof Gaunt, “time-honored Lancaster,” and also by Prince Henry, eldest son\r\nof Henry of Hereford and afterward Henry V, the hero of Agincourt. The\r\nboy was only in his twelfth year, but well grown and brave as a lion. In\r\nthe first encounter with the formidable MacMurrough, in the glens of\r\nCarlow, he so distinguished himself that Richard II knighted him on the\r\nfield. This march from Waterford to Dublin proved, in the end, even more\r\ndisastrous than the former one. MacMurrough kept up his harassing\r\ntactics, as usual. The rain poured down in torrents. The Irish drove all\r\nthe cattle away from the English line of march, and destroyed the\r\ngrowing crops. Nearly all the baggage-animals of the invading force died\r\nfor want of forage, and the army was in a state of famine and revolt,\r\nwhen it finally reached the seacoast near the present town of Arklow,\r\nwhere some English ships, laden with provisions, saved it from actual\r\nstarvation. The remnant made its way to Dublin, where other disastrous\r\nnews awaited King Richard. Henry of Hereford, eldest son of John of\r\nGaunt, whom he had unjustly exiled, and whose lands he had seized, now,\r\non the death of his father, having become Duke of Lancaster, came back\r\nfrom the continent, having heard of Richard’s misfortunes in Ireland,\r\nand laid claim to the crown. Richard, after ordering young Prince Henry\r\nand his uncle to be imprisoned in the castle of Trim—still one of the\r\nfinest Norman keeps in Ireland—set sail for England. Henry, who had by\r\nthis time raised a large army, made him prisoner and sent him to\r\nPontefract Castle, in Yorkshire, where, soon afterward, he was starved\r\nto death, or otherwise foully made away with. Prince Henry and his uncle\r\nwere immediately released when the Duke of Lancaster ascended a usurped\r\nthrone as Henry IV of England. And thus was laid the bloody foundation\r\nof the dreadful after wars between the rival royal houses of York and\r\nLancaster, which ended in the extermination of the legitimate\r\nPlantagenets. An illegitimate branch, directly descended from John of\r\nGaunt, still survives in the ducal house of Beaufort.\r\n\r\nArt MacMurrough remained a conqueror to the end, and kept up the war\r\nwith the Normans. In 1404, he defeated at Athcroe (Ford of Slaughter),\r\nnear Dublin, Lord Thomas of Lancaster, brother of the king, putting most\r\nof the English to the sword, and desperately wounding the prince\r\nhimself. Only a few years ago, Irish laborers, excavating for a railroad\r\nat Athcroe, came upon nearly a thousand bent swords, some of them badly\r\ndecomposed by rust, buried in the river bed. They were the swords taken\r\nfrom the dead English, in 1404, and bent across the knees of the\r\nvictorious Irish, according to their custom in those days.\r\n\r\nMacMurrough’s career of glory continued until 1417, when, having\r\ncaptured all the important towns of Leinster, except Dublin and\r\nDrogheda, he died at his capital of New Ross—then the second city in\r\nIreland—as some say by poison, in the sixtieth year of his age and\r\nforty-fourth of his reign. Taken for all in all, he was not alone the\r\nbravest, but the ablest, of Irish princes and warriors since the days of\r\nKing Brian, and it was a sad day for Ireland when the word went through\r\nLeinster and rang around the island that King Art was dead. Many a dark\r\ngeneration passed away before such another chief, or any one worthy to\r\nbe mentioned as a rival of his fame, arose in that unfortunate land.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                  Ireland During the Wars of the Roses\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER the premature death of Henry IV, an able but unscrupulous\r\nsovereign, in 1413, the attention of England was again directed to the\r\nconquest of France by the chivalrous and skilful Henry V. His capture of\r\nHarfleur and marvelous victory of Agincourt, against overwhelming odds,\r\nin 1415, stamp him as one of the world’s great military leaders. During\r\nthe nine years of his reign, he succeeded in subduing France, and,\r\nfinally, married Catherine, heiress of Charles VI, an almost imbecile\r\nking, and had himself declared regent and next in succession to the\r\nthrone after his father-in-law. France was stupefied, but God,\r\ninfinitely stronger than French arms, decreed Henry’s early death. He\r\ndied in the conquered country in 1422, leaving an only son, Henry VI, an\r\ninfant of nine months, to succeed him, under the regency of his uncle,\r\nHumphrey, Duke of Gloucester, who, for a wonder, considering the history\r\nof the Plantagenets, remained faithful to his trust. John, Duke of\r\nBedford, a younger brother of Henry, and a very brilliant soldier,\r\nbecame regent of France. This was the period of the inspired\r\npeasant-girl, Joan of Arc, whose story of victory and death belongs to\r\nthe history of France, although, after having performed prodigies, she\r\ndied at the stake to which the English, into whose hands she had fallen,\r\ncondemned her. The Dauphin, as Charles VII, succeeded to his legitimate\r\nthrone, and, about 1453, the English were expelled from France, except\r\nthe old town of Calais, which remained in their possession until 1558.\r\nIn Ireland, meanwhile, the chief feuds were those between the Geraldines\r\nand the Butlers and the De Burgos and the Connaught chiefs. There were\r\nalso minor feuds in different parts of the island, but, as a rule, the\r\nIrish people had things pretty much their own way, and might have thrown\r\noff the English yoke utterly, if they had had an Edward Bruce or Art\r\nMacMurrough to arouse and lead them to victory. Unfortunately they had\r\nnot, and, as the English fetter was very light on Ireland during the\r\nWars of the Roses, which began in 1455, they imagined, perhaps, that the\r\nold enemy, having plenty of fighting to do on their own account, might\r\nleave them alone for evermore—a vain hope if it were seriously\r\nentertained.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of six years, the Wars of the Roses—so-called because\r\nthe red rose was the badge of the House of Lancaster and the white that\r\nof the House of York—broke out more violently than before, because Henry\r\nVI, who had been declared imbecile and unfit to reign, suddenly\r\nrecovered his intellect, and Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York, who\r\nclaimed a prior right to the throne, and had been appointed Regent, with\r\nthe right of succession, refused to give up his authority. Henry had a\r\nson by his brave wife, Margaret of Anjou. He might be called a weakling,\r\nbut she summoned the people to defend the rights of her son. York was\r\ndefeated, captured, and beheaded at Wakefield, in 1461, but his son\r\nEdward, Earl of March, routed the queen’s army immediately afterward and\r\nascended the throne as Edward IV. Struggle succeeded struggle, but the\r\nHouse of York achieved a crowning triumph at Tewkesbury and again at\r\nBarnet Heath, where Warwick, the King Maker, fell. The direct male line\r\nof the House of Lancaster perished at Tewkesbury, where, it is alleged,\r\nthe gallant Prince Edward, son of Henry VI, was murdered, after having\r\nbeen made prisoner, by Edward IV and George, Duke of Clarence—the same\r\nafterward drowned in a butt of wine by order of his cruel brother. King\r\nEdward IV, after a reign of twenty-two years, marked by slaughter of his\r\nfoes and some of his friends, notorious immorality, and swinish\r\ndebauchery, died of a fever brought on by his excesses, in 1483, and his\r\nvile younger brother, the Duke of Gloucester, succeeded the boy-king,\r\nEdward V, by process of murder, in the same year. The last battle of the\r\nWars of the Roses was fought at Bosworth, near Leicester, August 22,\r\n1485. Richard, last king of the Plantagenet family, fell and was\r\nsucceeded by his rival, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, descended, in the\r\nfemale line, from John of Gaunt, who ascended the throne as Henry VII.\r\n\r\nThus, you will see, Ireland was left pretty much to herself, during\r\nthose thirty years of English civil war, in which twelve murderous\r\npitched battles were fought. Most of the old nobility were killed in\r\nbattle or executed, or otherwise destroyed, and more than one hundred\r\nthousand Englishmen of the middle and lower classes were immolated on\r\nthe smoking altars of family pride and savage ambition. Every prince of\r\nthe race of Plantagenet was exterminated when, in 1599, Henry VII\r\nordered the beheading of the young Earl of Warwick, son of the Duke of\r\nClarence. Many of the Anglo-Irish lords and their followings took part\r\nin the English wars, mainly on the side of the House of York, and the\r\nGeraldines, in particular, got sadly mixed up in them, for which they\r\nsuffered amply in after days. No reigning king of England had set foot\r\nin Ireland since Richard II sailed to his death from Dublin, and Henry\r\nVII proved to be no exception to the rule. He, however, interfered in\r\nthe quarrel between the Fitzgeralds and the Butlers—as bitter and\r\nprolonged as that between the Camerons and Campbells in Scotland—and\r\nmade the Earl of Kildare viceroy. The Desmonds, the powerful southern\r\nbranch of the Geraldines, were also eternally at variance with the\r\nButlers. It is related that, on one occasion, the Earl of Desmond was\r\nwounded and made prisoner. While being borne on a litter to Butler’s\r\nstronghold, one of the bearers insolently and brutally demanded, “Where\r\nis the great Earl of Desmond now?” To which the heroic captive\r\nimmediately replied—“Where he ought to be” (alluding to the litter in\r\nwhich he was carried by his foes): “still on the necks of the Butlers!”\r\n\r\nThe most memorable event of Henry VII’s reign, as far as Ireland was\r\nconcerned, was the coming over from England of Sir Edward Poynings, as\r\nLord Deputy during the temporary retirement of Kildare. The English\r\ncolonists of the Pale, almost from their first settlement of that\r\ndistrict, possessed an independent parliament, modeled on that of\r\nEngland. It was, in general, oppressive toward the Celtic-Irish, but\r\nmade good laws enough for the Palesmen. Poynings, soon after his\r\narrival, called this parliament to assemble at Drogheda and there (1495)\r\nthe Statute of Kilkenny was reaffirmed, except as regarded the\r\nprohibition of Gaelic, which had come into general use, even in the Pale\r\nitself. The main enactment—the first uttered in the English tongue in\r\nIreland—was that known as 10 Henry VII, otherwise Poynings’ Law, which\r\nprovided that no legislation should be, thereafter, proceeded with in\r\nIreland unless the bills were first submitted for approval or rejection\r\nto the monarch and privy council of England. In case of approval they\r\nwere to be attested by the great seal of the English realm. It was, to\r\nbe sure, a most unjust and insolent measure, and it seems almost\r\nincredible that even the Pales people—mere hybrids, neither English nor\r\nIrish—should have tamely submitted to its infamous provisions. It\r\nremained in force 287 years, or until 1782, when it was repealed under\r\ncircumstances that will appear hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe close of this reign witnessed a bloody struggle between the Kildares\r\nand Clanricardes, in which many Celtic tribes also bore a part, and in\r\nwhich thousands of men lost their lives to no good purpose. In the two\r\nprincipal battles, those of Knockdoe and Monabraher (1507-10), artillery\r\nand musketry were first made use of on Irish soil.\r\n\r\nAs most of the Irish Palesmen, including the House of Kildare, were\r\npartisans of the House of York during the Wars of the Roses, the two\r\npretenders—prepared by Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy, sister of Edward\r\nIV, to impersonate, respectively, Edward, Earl of Warwick, only son and\r\nheir of the late Duke of Clarence, and Richard, Duke of York, the second\r\nson of Edward IV, who was murdered in the Tower, by order, it is said,\r\nof his base uncle, Richard III, together with his brother, the boy-king,\r\nEdward V—found adherents when they landed on Irish soil. Indeed, Lambert\r\nSimnel, the first of these pretenders, a handsome young Englishman, who\r\nresembled the princes of the House of York, was crowned king, as “Edward\r\nVI,” in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin. Many Pales Irish followed him\r\nto England, where Henry VII defeated and made him prisoner. The real\r\nWarwick was taken from the Tower and paraded through the streets-a sad\r\nspectacle of physical comeliness marred, and intellect clouded, by long\r\nand harsh confinement. Having been sufficiently exhibited to satisfy the\r\npublic of Simnel’s imposture, the poor boy was returned to his cell.\r\nSimnel, himself, was made a “turnspit” in the royal kitchen, afterward\r\nraised to the post of falconer, and ended his days in that humble\r\nposition. The second pretender, Perkin Warbeck, a Belgian by birth, had\r\nless support from Ireland than his predecessor, but involved some of the\r\nnobles of the Pale with King Henry. But his adherents, remembering the\r\nimposition of the bogus Edward VI, soon fell away, and Perkin went to\r\nScotland, where James IV received him, as if he were a genuine prince,\r\nand gave him his cousin, the lovely Lady Catherine Gordon, in marriage.\r\nPeace being concluded between James and Henry, Warbeck and his beautiful\r\nbride went to Cornwall. There the pretender, who was really a man of\r\nnoble presence and great ability, rallied 3,000 men to his standard.\r\nSuccessful at first, he proved himself a false Plantagenet by basely\r\ndeserting his confiding followers on the eve of decisive battle. He shut\r\nhimself up in the sanctuary of Beaulieu, in the New Forest, but soon\r\nsurrendered himself, and was shown by the king to the populace of\r\nLondon. He was well treated for a time, but his position was mortifying.\r\nHe ran off to another sanctuary, was again forced to give himself up,\r\nwas placed in the public stocks, confessed he was an impostor, and was\r\nfinally sent to the Tower, to keep company with the unhappy Warwick.\r\nThis circumstance enabled the crafty Henry to get up a so-called plot,\r\nof which it was easy to convict two helpless prisoners. Warwick—last\r\nmale of the Plantagenets—lost his head on Tower Hill, and Warbeck died\r\nby the rope at Tyburn. His charming widow became lady-in-waiting to the\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\nMany abbeys and monasteries were built in Ireland during this\r\ncomparatively tranquil period, and the passion for learning revived to a\r\ngreat extent among the native Irish nobility. Pilgrimages, as of old,\r\nwere made to distant lands for the purpose of worshiping at famous\r\nshrines. Irish teachers and scholars began again to be numerous in\r\nSpain, Germany, and Italy. Henry VII, engaged in saving the wreck of\r\nEngland’s almost extinguished nobility, and in hoarding money, for which\r\nhe had a passion, took little account of Ireland and the Irish. But,\r\nalready, low on the horizon, a blood-red cloud was forming, and it\r\ngradually thickened and extended until, at last, it broke in a crimson\r\ntorrent on the fated Irish nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK II\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATING OF IRISH AFFAIRS FROM THE PERIOD OF THE REFORMATION TO THE\r\nEXILE AND DEATH OF THE ULSTER PRINCES IN THE REIGN OF JAMES I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n           The “Reformation”—New Cause of Discord in Ireland\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE bitterness of race hatred had almost died out when the Reformation,\r\nas the opponents of the Church of Rome called the great schism of the\r\nsixteenth century, began to shake Europe like an earthquake. Luther, and\r\nother dissenters from Catholic faith, carried most of the north of\r\nEurope with them. The Latin countries, South Germany, all of Ireland,\r\nand most of England, clung to the old faith, and Henry VIII, who\r\nsucceeded his father at an early age, and was quite learned in theology,\r\nwrote a pamphlet defending the Catholic dogmas against Luther and the\r\nothers. This work procured for him from the Pope the title of the\r\n“Defender of the Faith,” which still, rather inappropriately, belongs to\r\nthe sovereign of England. But Henry was a good Catholic only so long as\r\nreligion did not interfere with his passions and ambitions. He had been\r\nmarried in early life to Catherine of Aragon, who had been the nominal\r\nwife of his elder brother, another Prince of Wales, who died uncrowned.\r\nAfter many years, Henry, who was a slave to his passions, tired of\r\nCatherine, and pretended to believe that it was sinful to live with his\r\nbrother’s widow, even though the latter relationship was but nominal. In\r\ntruth, he had fallen in love with Anne Boleyn, one of Queen Catherine’s\r\nmaids-of-honor. The Pope was appealed to for a divorce and refused to\r\ngrant it, after having carefully examined into the case. Then Henry\r\nsevered England’s spiritual connection with Rome, and declared himself\r\nhead of the English “Reformed” Church. In this he was sustained by\r\nWolsey, Cromwell, and other high churchmen, all of whom were either\r\nambitious or afraid of their heads, for Henry never hesitated, like his\r\ngrand-uncle, Richard III, at the use of the axe, when any subject,\r\nclerical or lay, opposed his will. But the tyrant, while refusing\r\nallegiance to the Pope, still maintained the truth of Catholic dogma,\r\nand he murdered with studied impartiality those who gave their adhesion\r\nto the Holy See and those who denied its doctrines; no Englishman of\r\nnote felt his head safe in those red days. As for the common people,\r\nnobody of “rank” ever gave them a thought. Henry now seized upon the\r\nChurch property, and, therewith, bribed the great lords to take his side\r\nof the controversy. The boors followed the lords, and so most of England\r\nfollowed Henry’s schism and prepared to go farther.\r\n\r\nHenry married Anne Boleyn when he had “divorced” Queen Catherine. After\r\nthe Princess Elizabeth was born, he tired of his new wife, had her tried\r\nfor faithlessness and high treason and beheaded. Scarcely was she dead\r\nwhen the inhuman brute married Lady Jane Seymour, of the great Somerset\r\nfamily. She gave birth to Prince Edward and died. Then he married Anne\r\nof Cleves, but, not liking her person, “divorced” her and sent her back\r\nto Germany. For “imposing” her on him, he disgraced, and finally\r\nbeheaded, the Lord Chancellor, Thomas Cromwell, who had been his great\r\nfriend. The monster next espoused Lady Catherine Howard, of the House of\r\nSurrey, but he had her beheaded, on charges almost similar to those\r\nurged against Anne Boleyn, within the year. At last he married a widow\r\nof two experiences, Lady Catharine Parr, who, being a woman of tact and\r\ncleverness, managed to save her head, although frequently in danger,\r\nuntil the ferocious king, who must have been somewhat insane, finally\r\nfell a victim to his own unbridled vices. “The plain truth,” says\r\nCharles Dickens, in his “Child’s History,” “is that Henry VIII was a\r\nmost intolerable ruffian, a disgrace to human nature, and a blot of\r\nblood and grease upon the history of England.”\r\n\r\nThis was the crowned “fiend in human shape” who sought to effect his\r\n“Reformation in Ireland,” where both the Old Irish and the Old English\r\nhad united against his tyranny. The weight of his wrath fell first upon\r\nthe Leinster Geraldines, whom he dreaded. He contrived to pick a quarrel\r\nwith Gerald, ninth Earl of Kildare, who had been for many years his\r\nfavorite viceroy in Ireland, and summoned him to London in hot haste, on\r\nflimsy, notoriously “trumped-up” charges of treason. He flung him into a\r\ndungeon in the Tower of London. Lord Thomas Fitzgerald, son of the Earl,\r\ncalled “Silken Thomas,” because of the beauty of his person and the\r\nsplendor of his apparel, was appointed deputy by his father, who thought\r\nhis absence in England might be brief. Lord Thomas was young, brave, and\r\nrash, and, in short, the very man to fall an easy victim to the wiles of\r\nhis House’s enemies. Tradition says that the false news of Earl Gerald’s\r\nexecution, by order of King Henry, was spread in Dublin by one of the\r\nButlers. The privy council, over which he usually presided, was already\r\nin session at St. Mary’s Abbey, when “Silken Thomas” heard the story.\r\nHe, at once, with a large escort, proceeded to the abbey, renounced his\r\nallegiance to the English monarch, and, seizing the sword of state from\r\nthe sword-bearer, threw it, with violent gesture, on the council table,\r\n“the English Thanes among.” Protests availed nothing. He rushed to arms,\r\nand for nearly two years held at bay Henry’s power. Had he but laid his\r\nplans with care and judgment, he would, no doubt, have ended the rule of\r\nEngland over Ireland, which, although not his primary, became his\r\nultimate, object. In the end, his stronghold of Maynooth Castle was\r\nbetrayed into the hands of the English general, Sir William Skeffington,\r\nby Lord Thomas’s foster-brother, Parez, for a sum in gold. General\r\nSkeffington paid the money on the surrender of the castle, and\r\nimmediately hanged the traitor. For this act of chivalric justice, the\r\nname of that stern Englishman is still held in respect by all readers of\r\nIrish history. The loss of Maynooth depleted the strength of “Silken\r\nThomas.” He struggled on for some time longer, but, at last, accepted\r\nthe terms of Lord Deputy Gray, who offered him his life and guaranteed\r\nthe safety of his five uncles—two, at least, of whom had had no hand in\r\nthe outbreak. They were invited to a banquet by the Lord Deputy, and\r\nthere, while drinking with their false hosts, were treacherously seized,\r\nplaced in irons, and sent to England in a ship called the _Cow_. One of\r\nthe uncles, hearing the name of the vessel, said: “We are lost! I have\r\ndreamed that six of us, Geraldines, would be carried to England in the\r\nbelly of a cow and there lose our heads!” The augury was fulfilled.\r\nHenry VIII, with his usual disregard of terms, had them beheaded\r\nimmediately after their arrival in London, at Tyburn. The old Earl of\r\nKildare had not been executed after all, but died of a broken heart in\r\nthe Tower on learning of the revolt and misfortunes of his son. Only one\r\nheir-male of the noble House of Kildare now survived, and for him,\r\nalthough only twelve years old, Henry sought, through his agents, with\r\nthe relentless ferocity of a Herod. The boy was related to the great\r\nCeltic houses, for the Geraldines of that period preferred Irish wives,\r\nand his mother was a princess of the House of O’Neill of Ulster. By her,\r\nand by other noble Irish ladies, he was concealed and protected until he\r\nwas enabled to escape to France. Thence he proceeded to Rome, where he\r\nwas educated as befitted his rank and lineage. This young Gerald was\r\nrestored to his titles and estates by Queen Mary I, but he accepted\r\nProtestantism when Elizabeth came to the throne, because, otherwise, he\r\ncould not have saved land and title—a most unworthy motive, but one very\r\ncommon in that violent and sanguinary era. In his descendants the elder\r\nGeraldine branch still lives in Ireland—the present head of the family\r\nbeing Maurice Fitzgerald, “the boy-Duke” of Leinster.\r\n\r\n“Bluff King Hal,” as the English called their royal Bluebeard, never did\r\nanything by halves, if he could help it. He did not think the title of\r\n“Lord of Ireland” sufficient for his dignity, and set about intriguing\r\nto be elected king. Accordingly, he caused to be summoned a parliament,\r\nor rather what we of to-day would call a convention, composed of\r\nAnglo-Irish barons and Celto-Irish chiefs, to meet in Dublin, A.D. 1541.\r\nThis parliament or convention, at which the great Ulster princes,\r\nO’Neill and O’Donnell, did not attend, voted Henry the crown of\r\nIreland—something the Irish chiefs, at least, had no power to do, as\r\nthey held their titles by election of their clans and not by right of\r\nheredity. The outcome was, however, that Henry became King of\r\nIreland—the first English monarch to achieve that distinction. In order\r\nto emphasize his power, he at once decreed that the old titles of the\r\nIrish princes should give way to English ones. Thus “The O’Brien” became\r\n“Earl of Thomond”; “The MacWilliam,” “Earl of Clanricarde”; “The\r\nMacMurrough” became “Baron of Ballynun,” and changed his family name to\r\nKavanagh. Shameful to relate, O’Neill and O’Donnell, both old men,\r\nbroken in health, “came in” and joined the titled serfs. The former\r\nbecame “Earl of Tyrone” and the latter “Earl of Tyrconnel.”\r\n\r\nWhen the news reached the Irish clansmen, there was a general revolt and\r\nnew chiefs of the same families, with the old Irish designations\r\nunchanged, were elected. The English interest supported “the King’s\r\nO’Donnell” and the others of his type, while the bulk of the Irish\r\npeople stood for the newly chosen leaders. Thus was still another\r\nfirebrand cast by English policy among the Irish people, and there was\r\ncivil war, thenceforth, for generations in the clans themselves.\r\n\r\nNor was Henry satisfied with mere civil supremacy in Ireland. He also\r\nset himself up as head of the Irish Church. Many Anglo-Irish Catholic\r\nbishops basely acquiesced in his policy, but the Celtic bishops, almost\r\nto a man, spurned his propositions. The masses of the Irish nation,\r\nwhether of Celtic, Norman, or Saxon origin, remained steadfastly\r\nCatholic, although, in the past, they had had little cause to be pleased\r\nwith the political action of the Vatican, which had generally sided with\r\nthe Catholic monarchs of England against Ireland’s aspirations after\r\nindependence. Now, however, the favored country had become Rome’s most\r\ndeadly enemy in Europe, while Ireland, inhabited by a highly spirited\r\nand stubborn people, who venerated the creed taught their fathers by St.\r\nPatrick, became the foremost European champion of the old faith.\r\n\r\nWe can not dwell at greater length on this lurid dawn of the Reformation\r\nin Ireland, because, fierce as was the persecution under Henry, it was\r\ntrivial compared with what followed his reign, and made the distracted\r\nisland a veritable den of outrage and slaughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n The Reformation Period Continued—Edward VI, Mary I, Elizabeth, and “John\r\n                                the Proud”\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Edward VI, another boy-king, came to the throne, in 1547, Ireland\r\nwas pretty well distracted, owing to the seeds of discord sown by his\r\nferocious father. The young monarch was under the absolute control of\r\nhis maternal kinsmen, the Seymours, and all that was done to forward the\r\nReformation in Ireland during his brief reign may be justly attributed\r\nto them. On his death, in 1553, Mary, daughter of Henry VIII and\r\nCatherine of Aragon, and wife of Philip II of Spain, succeeded. She was\r\na bigoted Catholic and soon made things decidedly warm for the\r\nProtestants in England. Many of these fled for safety to Ireland, where\r\nthe Catholic people—incapable of cruelty until demoralized by the\r\nruthless tyranny of religious persecution—received and sheltered them—a\r\nnoble page of Anglo-Irish history.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation, of course, came to a standstill in Ireland, during\r\nthis queen’s reign, but the plunder and persecution of the Irish\r\npeople did not, therefore, abate. There were raids and massacres and\r\nconfiscations, as usual. Of course there were bloody reprisals on the\r\npart of the Irish, also—as was but natural. Some of the old Irish\r\ndistricts—particularly Leix and Offaly—were, under the sway of Mary,\r\ncalled the King’s and Queen’s Counties—the chief town of the one being\r\nnamed Philipstown, after the queen’s Spanish husband, and the capital\r\nof the other Maryborough, after herself. The Irish Reformers “laid\r\nlow,” as was prudent in them, during Mary’s period of power, because\r\nshe had the unpleasant Tudor habit of putting to death, by divers\r\nviolent modes of punishment, those who presumed to differ from her\r\nrather strong opinions. The English, who sincerely rejoiced when,\r\nafter reigning about five years, she passed to her account, nicknamed\r\nher “Bloody Mary,” although she was not a whit “bloodier” than her\r\nawful father, and had a very formidable rival for sanguinary “honors”\r\nin her younger half-sister, Elizabeth. Mary Tudor was the last\r\n_avowed_ Catholic monarch who reigned in England, except the ill-fated\r\nJames II. In this reign, the English law of primogeniture was first\r\ngenerally introduced into the Celtic districts annexed to the Pale,\r\nwhich had been divided into “shire-ground,” and this was the cause of\r\nmuch internal disorder among the Irish tribes that clung to the old\r\nelective system of chieftaincy.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, called by her admiring English subjects “Good Queen Bess,” on\r\nvery insufficient grounds, ascended the throne in 1558. She had,\r\napparently, “conformed” to Catholicity during the lively reign of her\r\nhalf-sister, fearing, no doubt, for her head in case of refusal. Henry\r\nVIII’s daughter, by Anne Boleyn, she inherited great energy of\r\ncharacter, a masculine intellect, superabundant vanity, a passion for\r\nempire, and a genius for intrigue. Her morals were none of the best,\r\naccording to many historians. She was, for that age, highly educated,\r\ncould speak divers tongues, and possessed many of the polite\r\naccomplishments. Indeed, she was somewhat of a female pedant. In person,\r\nwhile yet young, she was not ill-favored, being well-formed and of good\r\nstature. Her complexion was fair, her hair auburn, and her eyes small,\r\nbut dark and sparkling. Her temper was irritable; she swore when angry,\r\nand, at times, her disposition was as ferocious as that of “Old Hal”\r\nhimself. Like his, her loves were passing passions, and her friendship\r\ndangerous to those on whom she lavished it most freely. Flattery was the\r\nsurest way by which to reach her consideration, but, in affairs of\r\nstate, not even that could cloud her powerful understanding or balk her\r\nresolute will. She resolved to finish what her father and brother had\r\nbegun, and finish it to the purpose—namely, the Reformation—in both\r\nEngland and Ireland. In the former country, her will soon became law,\r\nand Rome ceased to be considered, for generations, as a factor in\r\nEnglish affairs. In Ireland, it was different. The people there refused,\r\nas a great majority, to conform to the new order of things. They obeyed\r\nthe Pope, as their spiritual chief, and went to mass and received the\r\nsacraments as usual. In Ulster, particularly, the people, headed by John\r\nO’Neill, Prince of Tyrone, surnamed “The Proud,” resisted all English\r\nencroachments, civil and religious. A bloody war resulted. The English\r\ngenerals and some of the Anglo-Irish lords were commissioned by\r\nElizabeth to force the new religion down the throats of the Irish people\r\nat the point of the sword. The Liturgy, she proclaimed, must be read in\r\nEnglish, the mass abandoned, and she herself be recognized as Pope in\r\nIreland, as well as in England. Accordingly, the English armies burned\r\nthe Catholic churches and chapels, assassinated the clergy, and\r\nbutchered the people wherever resistance was offered. But John O’Neill\r\nwas a great soldier and managed, for many years, to defend his country\r\nwith great success, defeating the best of the English captains in\r\nseveral fierce conflicts. Elizabeth, struck with his bravery and\r\nability, invited him to visit her at her palace of Greenwich. The\r\ninvitation was sent through Gerald of Kildare, O’Neill’s cousin. The\r\nIrish prince accepted and proceeded to court with a following of three\r\nhundred galloglasses, or heavy infantry, clad in saffron-colored\r\njackets, close-fitting pantaloons, heavy shoes, short cloaks, and with\r\ntheir hair hanging down their backs, defiant of Poynings’ Law, and all\r\nother English enactments. They were gigantic warriors—all more than six\r\nfeet tall—and with huge mustaches, the drooping ends of which touched\r\ntheir collarbones. They also carried truculent-looking daggers and\r\nimmense battle-axes, such as might have won the admiration of Richard\r\nCœur de Lion himself. The English courtiers—pigmies compared with the\r\ngalloglasses—might have been inclined to make fun of their costumes, but\r\nthose deadly appearing axes inspired awe, and no unpleasant incident\r\noccurred during the visit. “Shane the Proud” made a deep impression on\r\nElizabeth, for he was physically magnificent and as fierce as her\r\ndreaded father. “By what right do you oppose me in Ulster?” she asked.\r\n“By very good right, madam,” he answered. “You may be queen here, but I\r\nam king in Ulster, and so have been the O’Neills for thousands of\r\nyears!” Then she offered to make him Earl of Tyrone by letters patent.\r\n“Earl me no earls, madam,” he replied. “The O’Neill is my title! By it I\r\nstand or fall!” There was nothing more to be said, so the queen made him\r\nrich presents, after asking him to be her “good friend,” which, being a\r\ngallant, he promised, and then he went back to Ulster.\r\n\r\nBut Shane, although a good general and a great fighter, was a bad\r\nstatesman, and by no means a conscientious character. He oppressed the\r\nneighboring Irish chiefs, being, indeed, half mad with pride, and made a\r\nmost unjust and unnecessary attack on the Clan O’Donnell, next to the\r\nO’Neills the most powerful of Ulster tribes. He not alone ruined the\r\nO’Donnell, but also dishonored him, by carrying his wife away and making\r\nher his mistress, in mad disregard of Irish public opinion. He also\r\nquarreled with the old MacDonald colony of Antrim—said by some writers\r\nto be Irish, not Scotch, in their origin—and used them with extreme\r\nharshness. In the end, his misconduct produced a revolt even among his\r\nown followers. His enemies, including the injured O’Donnells, speedily\r\nmultiplied, and he who had been fifty times victorious over the English,\r\nwas, at last, signally defeated by his own justly indignant\r\nfellow-countrymen. In this extremity, he fled with his mistress and a\r\nfew followers for refuge to the MacDonalds, who, at first, received the\r\nfugitives hospitably, but soon, instigated, it is said, by one Captain\r\nPiers, an Englishman, fell upon O’Neill at a banquet and stabbed him to\r\ndeath. Had he loved his own people as much as he hated the English, he\r\nmight have lived and died a conqueror. The MacDonalds did not respect\r\nthe body of this dead lion. They severed the head from the trunk,\r\npickled it, and sent the ghastly present to the English Lord Deputy in\r\nDublin, who caused it to be spiked on the tower of Dublin Castle.\r\nO’Neill’s death, in the very prime of his military genius, relieved\r\nElizabeth of her most dangerous Irish enemy. But another scion of that\r\nwarrior race was under the queen’s “protection” in London, and was\r\ndestined to raise the Bloody Hand, the cognizance of his house, to a\r\nprouder eminence than it had attained in Irish annals since the far-off\r\ndays of Nial of the Hostages.\r\n\r\nTreacherous massacres of Irish chieftains dangerous to England’s\r\nsupremacy in their country would appear to have been a special feature\r\nof Elizabeth’s reign. Under the Lord Deputy Sydney’s régime, A.D. 1577,\r\nSir Francis Cosby, the English general commanding in the ancient\r\nterritories of Leix and Offaly, unable to obtain the submission of the\r\nnative chiefs by force of arms, invited several hundred of them to a\r\nbanquet at the rath of Mullaghmast, in the present county of Kildare.\r\nThe principal families represented were the O’Mores, O’Nolan’s,\r\nO’Kelly’s, and Lalors. The rath, or fort, was fitted up for the\r\noccasion, and, through the entrance, the unsuspecting Irish chieftains\r\nand their friends rode with happy hearts and smiling faces. But one of\r\nthe Lalors who was rather belated, had his suspicions aroused by the\r\ndead silence which seemed to prevail in the rath, and by the peculiar\r\ncircumstance that none of those who had entered came out to welcome the\r\nlater arrivals. He bade the few friends who had accompanied him to\r\nremain outside, while he entered the fort to investigate. He took the\r\nprecaution to draw his sword before he went in. Proceeding with caution,\r\nhe was horrified at stumbling over the dead bodies of some of his\r\nneighbors just beyond the entrance. He retreated at once, but was set\r\nupon by assassins placed there to murder him. A powerful man, he wielded\r\nhis blade with such good effect that he cut his way out, mounted his\r\nhorse, and set off with his horrified associates at full gallop to his\r\nhome at Dysart. More than four hundred confiding Irish gentlemen had\r\nentered the rath that day, and of all of them, only the sagacious Lalor\r\nescaped. The tribe of O’More alone lost nearly two hundred of its\r\nforemost members, but was not entirely exterminated. Rory Oge O’More,\r\nson of the slaughtered head of the tribe, made relentless war on the\r\nEnglish Pale, and never desisted until he had more than avenged his\r\nkindred slain in the foul massacre of Mullaghmast.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n        The Geraldine War—Hugh O’Neill and “Red Hugh” O’Donnell\r\n\r\n\r\nULSTER was subdued, for a time, but, in Munster, the younger branch of\r\nthe Geraldines, known as Earls of Desmond, rose against the edicts of\r\nElizabeth and precipitated that long, sanguinary, and dreary conflict\r\nknown as the Geraldine War. Most of the Irish and Anglo-Irish chiefs of\r\nthe southern province bore a part in it, and it only terminated after a\r\nmurderous struggle, stretching over nearly seven years. The Desmonds and\r\ntheir allies gained many successes, but lack of cohesion, as always,\r\nproduced the inevitable result—final defeat. South Munster became a\r\ndesert. Elizabeth’s armies systematically destroyed the growing crops,\r\nand, at last, famine accomplished for England what the sword could not\r\nhave done. The Munster Geraldines were mainly led by Sir James\r\nFitzmaurice, a kinsman of the earl, who was a brave man and an\r\naccomplished soldier. The earl himself, and his brother, Sir John\r\nFitzgerald, had been summoned to London by the queen, and were made\r\nprisoners and placed in the Tower, after the usual treacherous fashion.\r\nAfter a period of detention, they were transferred, as state prisoners,\r\nto Dublin Castle, but managed to effect their escape (doubtless by the\r\nconnivance of friendly officials) on horseback and reached their own\r\ncountry in due time. The earl, foolishly, held aloof from Fitzmaurice\r\nuntil a dangerous crisis was reached, when he threw himself into the\r\nstruggle and, in defence of his country and religion, lost all he\r\npossessed. The Pope and King of Spain, in the Catholic interest, sent\r\nmen and money, but the Papal contingent, led by an English military\r\nadventurer, named Stukley, was diverted from its purpose, and never\r\nreached Ireland. The Spanish force—less than a thousand men—was brought\r\nto Ireland by Fitzmaurice himself. He had made a pilgrimage to Spain for\r\nthat purpose. Smerwick Castle, on the Kerry coast, was their point of\r\ndebarkation. With unaccountable timidity, Earl Desmond made no sign of\r\nan alliance, and Fitzmaurice was in search of other succor, when he\r\nfell, in a petty encounter with the De Burgos of Castle Connell. The\r\nSpaniards, who occupied Smerwick, were besieged by a large Anglo-Irish\r\nforce, under the Earl of Ormond and other veteran chiefs. They made a\r\ngallant and desperate defence, but they were invested by land and sea,\r\nand were perfectly helpless against the shower of shot and shell rained\r\nupon them night and day by the English batteries. Seeing that further\r\nresistance was useless, the Spanish commander finally surrendered at\r\ndiscretion, but, disgraceful to relate, Lord Deputy De Grey refused\r\nquarter and the hapless Spaniards were butchered to the last man. It is\r\nnot pleasant to have to state that among the fierce besiegers were the\r\ncelebrated Sir Walter Raleigh, the great English poet Edmund Spenser,\r\nand Hugh O’Neill, then serving Elizabeth, “for policy’s sake,” in a\r\nsubordinate capacity, but afterward destined to be the most formidable\r\nof all her Irish foes. The Munster Geraldines were exterminated, except\r\nfor a few collateral families—the Knight of Kerry, the Knight of Glin,\r\nand some other chiefs whose titles still survive. But the great House of\r\nDesmond vanished forever from history, when Garret Fitzgerald, the last\r\nearl, after all his kinsmen had fallen in the struggle, was betrayed and\r\nmurdered by a mercenary wretch, named Moriarty, in a peasant’s hut in\r\nKerry, not far from Castle Island. The assassin and his brutal\r\nconfederates decapitated the remains and sent the poor old head to\r\nElizabeth, in London, who caused it to be spiked over the “traitor’s\r\ngate” of the Tower. So ended the Geraldine revolt, which raged in\r\nMunster from 1578 to 1584, until all that fair land was a desert and a\r\nsepulchre. The bravest battle fought during its continuance was that of\r\nGlendalough, in the summer of 1580. This was on the soil of Leinster,\r\nand the victory was won by the heroic Clan O’Byrne, of Wicklow, led by\r\nthe redoubtable chief, Fiach MacHugh. The English, who were led by Lord\r\nDe Grey in person, suffered a total rout, and the Lord Deputy, at the\r\nhead of the few terrified survivors, fled in disgrace to Dublin, leaving\r\nbehind him the dead bodies of four of his bravest and ablest\r\ncaptains—Audley, Cosby, Carew, and Moore.\r\n\r\n “Carew and Audley deep had sworn the Irish foe to tame,\r\n  But thundering on their dying ear his shout of victory came;\r\n  And burns with shame De Grey’s knit brow and throbs with rage his eye,\r\n  To see his best, in wildest rout, from Erin’s clansmen fly.”\r\n\r\nThe defeat and death of “Shane the Proud” had left Ulster, temporarily,\r\nwithout a military chief competent to make head against the English,\r\nand, therefore, the Desmonds were left, practically, without help from\r\nthe northern province. Notwithstanding, the new Lord Deputy, Perrott,\r\nkept his eyes fixed steadily on Ulster, the fighting qualities of whose\r\nsons he knew only too well. In Tyrconnel young Hugh Roe, or Red Hugh,\r\nO’Donnell, was growing fast to manhood, and his fame as an athlete, a\r\nhunter, and hater of the English, spread throughout Ireland. Hugh\r\nO’Neill, the son of Matthew, Baron of Dungannon, was enjoying himself at\r\nElizabeth’s court, where he made the acquaintance of Cecil, Essex,\r\nBacon, Marshal Bagnal, Mountjoy, and numerous other celebrities, and\r\nbasked in the sunshine of the royal favor, which he took particular\r\npains to cultivate. He was a handsome young man, of middle size, rigidly\r\ntrained to arms, and “shaped in proportion fair.” The queen’s object was\r\nto make him an instrument in her hands for the final subjugation of\r\nIreland. He seemed to enter readily into her plans, which his quick\r\nintellect at once comprehended, and he met her wiles with a\r\ndissimulation as profound as her own. If any man ever outwitted\r\nElizabeth, politically, that man was Hugh O’Neill, whom she finally\r\ncreated Earl of Tyrone—a title which, in his inmost heart, he despised,\r\nmuch preferring his hereditary designation of “The O’Neill.” But it was\r\nnot Hugh’s immediate purpose to quarrel with Elizabeth about titles, or,\r\nin fact, anything else. He was graciously permitted to raise a bodyguard\r\nof his own clansmen, and to arm and drill them at his pleasure. Nay,\r\nmore, the queen allowed him to send from England shiploads of lead\r\nwherewith to put a new roof on his castle of Dungannon. And he went to\r\nIreland to look after his interests in person. Soon, rumors reached\r\nElizabeth that O’Neill, when he had sufficiently drilled one batch of\r\nclansmen, substituted another; and that enough lead had been shipped by\r\nhim from England to Tyrone to roof twenty castles. It was further\r\nrumored that the clanswomen of Tyrone were employed casting bullets at\r\nnight, instead of spinning and weaving. O’Neill, learning of these\r\nrumors from English friends, repaired to London, and, at once, reassured\r\nthe queen as to his “burning loyalty and devotion to her person.” So he\r\nwas permitted to return to Dungannon unmolested. Unlike his fierce\r\nkinsman, John the Proud, Hugh cultivated the friendship of all the\r\nUlster chiefs, within reach, and more particularly that of the brave and\r\nhandsome young Red Hugh O’Donnell. Nor did he confine his friendly\r\nrelations to the chiefs of Ulster. He also perfected good understandings\r\nwith many in the other three provinces, and managed to keep on good\r\nterms with the English also. Indeed, he did not hesitate to take the\r\nfield occasionally “in the interest of the queen,” and, on one occasion,\r\nduring a skirmish in Munster, received a wound in the thigh. How could\r\nElizabeth doubt that one who shed his blood for her could be otherwise\r\nthan devoted to her service? O’Neill, no doubt, liked the queen, but he\r\nloved Ireland and liberty much better. In his patriotic deceit he only\r\nfollowed the example set him at the English court. He kept “open house”\r\nat Dungannon Castle for all who might choose or chance to call. Among\r\nothers, he received the wrecked survivors of the Spanish Armada cast\r\naway on the wild Ulster coast, and shipped them back to Spain, at his\r\nown expense, laden with presents for their king. A kinsman, Hugh of the\r\nFetters—an illegitimate son of John the Proud by the wife of O’Donnell,\r\nalready mentioned—betrayed his secret to the English Government. He\r\nexplained his action to the satisfaction of the Lord Deputy, for he had\r\na most persuasive tongue. Having done so, he exercised his hereditary\r\nprivilege of the chief O’Neill, arrested Hugh of the Fetters, had him\r\ntried for treason, and, it is said, executed him with his own hand,\r\nbecause he could find no man in Tyrone willing to kill an O’Neill, even\r\nthough proven a craven traitor.\r\n\r\nLord Deputy Perrott, in 1587, or thereabout, concocted a plan by which\r\nhe got the young O’Donnell, whose rising fame he dreaded, into his\r\npower. A sailing-vessel, laden with wine and other merchandise, was sent\r\naround the coast of Ireland from Dublin and cast anchor in Lough Swilly,\r\nat a point opposite to Rathmullen. Red Hugh and his friends, young like\r\nhimself, were engaged in hunting and fishing when the vessel appeared in\r\nthe bay. The captain, in the friendliest manner, invited O’Donnell and\r\nhis companions on board. They consented, and were plied with wine. By\r\nthe time they were ready to return to shore, they found the hatches\r\nbattened down and the ship under way for Dublin. And thus, meanly and\r\nmost treacherously, was the kidnapping of this noble youth and his\r\nfriends accomplished by, supposedly, an English gentleman.\r\n\r\nO’Donnell, after a confinement of three years in Dublin Castle, managed\r\nto effect his escape, in company with some fellow captives. But they\r\nmissed their way, and were overtaken and captured in the territory of\r\nO’Tuhill, at a place now called Powerscourt, in the county Wicklow. A\r\nsecond attempt, made two years later on, proved more successful, and the\r\nescaping party managed to reach the tribe-land of the O’Byrnes, whose\r\nbrave chief, Fiach MacHugh, received and sheltered them. Art O’Neill,\r\none of Red Hugh’s companions, perished of cold and hunger—the season\r\nbeing winter—on the trip; and O’Donnell’s feet were so badly frozen that\r\nhe was partially disabled for life. This fact did not, however,\r\ninterfere with his warlike activity. O’Byrne at once informed Hugh\r\nO’Neill of Red Hugh’s escape and whereabouts, and the Ulster chief sent\r\na guide, who brought him safely to Dungannon, where he was royally\r\nentertained and admitted to the knowledge of O’Neill’s secret policy,\r\nwhich, as may have been surmised, aimed at the overthrow of English rule\r\nin Ireland.\r\n\r\nAfter resting sufficiently, O’Donnell proceeded to Tyrconnel, where he\r\nwas joyfully received by his people. His father, old and unenterprising,\r\ndetermined to abdicate the chieftaincy in his favor, and, accordingly,\r\nRed Hugh was proclaimed “The O’Donnell,” with all the ancient forms. He\r\nproceeded with characteristic rigor to baptize his new honors in the\r\nblood of his foes. Old Turlough O’Neill had weakly permitted an English\r\ngarrison to occupy his castle of Strabane. O’Donnell attacked it\r\nfuriously and put all of the garrison to the sword. He followed up this\r\nwarlike blow with many others, and soon struck terror into the hearts of\r\nall the “Englishry” and their much more despicable Irish allies, on the\r\nborders of Ulster and Connaught. His most active and efficient ally in\r\nthese stirring operations was Hugh McGuire, Prince of Fermanagh—the best\r\ncavalry commander produced by either party during the long and\r\ndevastating Elizabethan wars.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n    Confiscation of Desmond’s Domains—English Plantation of Munster\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE had been, of course, a general “confiscation to the Crown”—that\r\nis, to the English “carpet-baggers”—of the broad domains of the defeated\r\nDesmonds, and their allies, and among the aliens who profited greatly\r\nthereby, for a time, at least, were the poetic Edmund Spenser, who\r\nobtained the castle and lands of Kilcolman, in Cork, and Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh, who fell in for extensive holdings in Youghal, at the mouth of\r\nthe southern Blackwater, and its neighborhood. In the garden of Myrtle\r\nGrove House, Sir Walter’s Youghal residence, potatoes, obtained from\r\nVirginia, were first planted in Ireland, and the first pipeful of\r\ntobacco was smoked. In connection with the latter event, a story is told\r\nthat a servant-girl, about to scrub the floors, seeing smoke issuing\r\nfrom Sir Walter’s nose and mouth, conceived him to be on fire, and\r\nemptied the contents of her pail over him, in order, as she explained,\r\n“to put him out.” Sir Walter, we may be sure, did not relish her method\r\nof fighting “the fire fiend.”\r\n\r\nThe Desmond confiscation was by no means the first case of the kind on\r\nrecord in Ireland. The original Geraldines took the lands by force from\r\nthe Celtic tribes, but they speedily amalgamated with the natives, and,\r\nwithin a few generations, became full-fledged Irish in every\r\ncharacteristic, except their family name. Neither was this great\r\nconfiscation the last, or greatest, as will be seen in the progress of\r\nthis narrative. The queen’s ministers caused letters to be written to\r\nthe officers of every “shire” in England, “generously” offering\r\nDesmond’s plundered lands in fee simple—that is, practically, free of\r\ncost—to all younger brothers, of good families, who would undertake the\r\nplantation of Munster. Each of these favored colonists was allowed to\r\n“plant” a certain number of British, or Anglo-Irish, families, but it\r\nwas specifically provided that none of the native—that is, the Celtic\r\nand Catholic and the Norman-Catholic—Irish were to be admitted to the\r\nprivilege. The country had been made “a smoking desert” before this\r\nplantation of foreigners was begun. Most of the rightful owners had\r\nperished by famine and the sword, and those who still survived,\r\n“starvation being, in some instances, too slow, crowds of men, women,\r\nand children were sometimes driven into buildings, which were then set\r\non fire” (Mitchel’s “Life of Hugh O’Neill,” page 68). “The soldiers were\r\nparticularly careful to destroy all Irish infants, ‘for, if they were\r\nsuffered to grow up, they would become Popish rebels.’” (_Ibid._ pp. 68,\r\n69.) It is related by the historian Lombard that “women were found\r\nhanging upon trees, with their children strangled in the mother’s hair.”\r\n\r\nAnd all this was done in the name of the “reformed religion.” In good\r\ntruth, although Elizabeth herself may have wished to make the Irish\r\npeople Protestant in order that they might become more obedient to her\r\nspiritual and temporal sway, her agents in Ireland wished for nothing of\r\nthe kind. They wished the Irish masses to remain Catholic. Otherwise,\r\nthey would have had no good pretext for destroying them and usurping\r\ntheir lands. And this, too, satisfactorily explains why, for a very long\r\nperiod, the Irish national resistance to England was considered and\r\ndescribed as a purely Catholic, sectarian movement. Protestantism, in\r\nthe period of which we write, meant, to the average Irish mind,\r\nEngland’s policy of conquest and spoliation in Ireland. It is hardly\r\nwonderful, therefore, that there grew up between the followers of the\r\nold and new creeds an animosity doubly bitter—the animosity of race\r\nsupplemented by that of religion. In our own days, we have seen the same\r\nresult in the Polish provinces of Russia and the Turkish principalities\r\nin the Danubian region of Europe. Well might the poet ask—\r\n\r\n                 “And wherefore can not kings be great,\r\n                    And rule with man approving?\r\n                  And why should creeds enkindle hate\r\n                    And all their precepts loving?”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n           Conditions in Ulster Before the Revolt of O’Neill\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE first jury “trial” in Ulster was that of Hugh Roe MacMahon,\r\nchieftain of Monaghan, who became entangled with Lord Deputy Fitzwilliam\r\nin some one-sided “alliance,” and, failing in some slight particular to\r\nkeep his side of the contract, was “tried” by twelve soldiers in\r\nElizabeth’s pay, condemned to death and shot at his own door. This and\r\nother brutal murders, attested by the English historian, Moryson, filled\r\nthe north with rage, and the very name of English “law” became a menace\r\nand a terror throughout the length and breadth of Ulster. From that\r\nbloody period dates the hatred and distrust of English “justice” which\r\nstill survives among the Irish people. Indeed, instances of judicial\r\nmurder, almost rivaling that of MacMahon Roe, might be cited by living\r\nIrishmen as having occurred within their own experience. Elizabeth’s\r\ndeputy, Fitzwilliam, who was a consummate scoundrel and jobber in\r\nbribes, and would have made a champion modern “boodle alderman,”\r\nsucceeded in making the very name of “shire,” or county, land detested\r\nin Ireland. When he informed McGuire, the bold chief of Fermanagh, that\r\nhe was about to send a sheriff into his “county” to “empanel juries,”\r\nthe chief answered grimly, “Let him come; but, first, let me know his\r\neric (price of his blood), so that, if my people should cut off his\r\nhead, I may levy it on the country.” This was the Irish method under the\r\nBrehon law. No sheriff appeared in Fermanagh for many a year after\r\nMcGuire’s significant statement.\r\n\r\nRed Hugh O’Donnell continued to make things exceedingly lively for the\r\nEnglish garrisons in Ulster and Connaught, and made them take to the\r\ncover of their strong places after nearly every encounter. Near\r\nInniskillen, the gallant Hugh McGuire, aided by a small body of the\r\nclansmen of Tyrone, who came “on the quiet,” under the command of\r\nO’Neill’s brother, Cormac, met a large English escort, who were\r\nconveying supplies to the town, to which Red Hugh O’Donnell had laid\r\nsiege, at a ford of the river Erne. The English suffered a total rout,\r\nand their bread-wagons having been lost in the current, or overturned in\r\nthe shallows, the spot is known to this day as Bael-atha-an-Biscoid—in\r\nEnglish “the Ford of Biscuits.” Red Hugh, who had gone to Derry to meet\r\na body of the Antrim Scots, who were coming to his aid, was necessarily\r\nabsent when the battle was fought, and, on hearing of the victory,\r\nremarked he was “sorry he had not been in the fight, as he would have\r\nprevented the escape of so many of the English.” The latter began to\r\nperceive, by this time, that they had to “strip for the combat” in\r\nearnest if they meant to retain their foothold on the borders of Ulster.\r\n\r\nRumors of O’Neill’s disaffection had again reached the queen, and again\r\nhe journeyed to London and reassured her of his “loyalty.” He even made\r\ngreat show of accepting the English title of Earl of Tyrone, and\r\nreturned to Dungannon encumbered with the gold chain symbolical of his\r\nnew “rank.” This did not please his clansmen, who could not see into his\r\ndissembling schemes, so he was obliged to placate them by consenting to\r\nbe installed as The O’Neill—a title he very much preferred to his\r\nEnglish one of Earl—at the rath of Tulloghoge (Hill of the Youths), in\r\nhis native Tyrone. Thomas Davis, the poet of Young Ireland—a party of\r\nIrish literary men and high-souled patriots who flourished from 1842\r\nuntil 1848—in his fine ballad of the “True Irish King,” gives a vivid\r\npicture of the scene in the following lines:\r\n\r\n        “Unsandaled he stands on the foot-dinted rock;\r\n         Like a pillar-stone fixed against every shock.\r\n         Round, round as the rath, on a far-seeing hill,\r\n         Like his blemishless honor and vigilant will.\r\n         The graybeards are telling how chiefs by the score\r\n         Had been crowned on the rath of the kings heretofore:\r\n         While crowded, yet ordered, within its green ring,\r\n         Are the dynasts and priests round the True Irish King.\r\n\r\n        “The chronicler read him the laws of the clan,\r\n         And pledged him to bide by their blessing and ban.\r\n         His skian and his sword are unbuckled to show\r\n         That they only were meant for a foreigner foe;\r\n         A white willow wand has been put in his hand—\r\n         A type of pure, upright, and gentle command,\r\n         While hierarchs are blessing, the slipper they fling\r\n         And O’Cahan proclaims him a True Irish King.\r\n\r\n        “Thrice looked he to heaven with thanks and with prayer,\r\n         Thrice looked to his borders with sentinel stare—\r\n         To the waves of Lough Neagh, to the heights of Strabane;\r\n         And thrice to his allies, and thrice to his clan—\r\n         One clash on their bucklers—one more—they are still—\r\n         What means the deep pause on the crest of the hill?\r\n         Why gaze they above him? A war eagle’s wing!\r\n        ‘’Tis an omen—hurrah for the True Irish King!’”\r\n\r\nThose who may condemn the apparently tortuous policy of O’Neill must\r\nbear in mind that he was only practicing against the enemies of his\r\ncountry the double-dealing and subtle acts they had themselves taught\r\nhim, in order to make him a more facile instrument in their hands for\r\nthat country’s subjugation. The dark and crooked policy inculcated by\r\nMachiavelli was then in vogue at all the European courts, and at none\r\nwas it practiced more thoroughly than at that of Elizabeth of England.\r\nIt must be admitted that the English found in Hugh O’Neill a very apt\r\npupil—a true case of “diamond cut diamond.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n       O’Neill Draws the Sword—Victories of Clontibret and Armagh\r\n\r\n\r\nMARSHAL SIR HENRY BAGNAL—one of Elizabeth’s most potent military\r\ncommanders—had never liked Hugh O’Neill, whom he had often met in London\r\nand Dublin, but this hatred of the Irish prince was not shared by the\r\nmarshal’s fair sister, the Lady Mabel Bagnal, who presided over his\r\nmansion at Newry, where were established the headquarters of the English\r\narmy in Ulster. Lady Mabel was one of the most beautiful of women, and\r\nO’Neill, who had become a widower, grew desperately enamored of her. He\r\nmanaged to elude the vigilance of the hostile brother, and, assisted by\r\na friendly “Saxon,” succeeded in eloping with and making her his wife.\r\nThe elopement filled Sir Henry with fury. He entered into a conspiracy\r\nagainst O’Neill with other Englishmen and Palesmen. A new Lord Deputy\r\nhad come over from England in the person of Sir William Russell. Charges\r\nagainst O’Neill were laid before him. He communicated with the Court of\r\nLondon and commands soon came to arrest the Chief of Tyrone without\r\ndelay. O’Neill, as usual, had means of secret information and soon knew\r\nall about the plot laid for his destruction. Instead of being dismayed,\r\nhe hastened, at once, to Dublin and surprised his treacherous accusers\r\nin the midst of their deliberations. His old-time friend, the Earl of\r\nOrmond, stood by him and refused to be a party to the treachery planned\r\nby the new Lord Deputy. When a similar order had reached Ormond himself\r\nfrom Lord Burleigh—ancestor of the late Prime Minister of England—the\r\nearl replied scornfully in these words: “My lord, I will never use\r\ntreachery to any man, for it would both touch her Highness’s honor and\r\nmy own credit too much; and whosoever gave the queen advice thus to\r\nwrite is fitter for such base service than I am. Saving my duty to her\r\nMajesty, I would I might have revenge by my sword of any man that thus\r\npersuadeth the queen to write to me.” Noble words, gallant Ormond!\r\n\r\nThe earl, feeling convinced that Lord Russell, who was not much affected\r\nby honorable scruples, would obey the order from the queen and arrest\r\nO’Neill, advised the latter to fly from Dublin the very night of his\r\narrival. The Ulster prince thought this very good advice and accepted\r\nOrmond’s friendly offices. He managed to make his way in safety to\r\nDungannon and at once set about perfecting his preparations for open\r\nwarfare with the generals of Elizabeth. The latter were not idle either,\r\nfor Russell surmised O’Neill’s intention and sent Sir John Norreys\r\n(Norris), an experienced general, just returned from the wars in\r\nFlanders, to command against him. The remainder of the year 1594, as\r\nwell as some of the succeeding year, was spent in useless negotiations,\r\nfor both parties well knew that war was now inevitable. O’Donnell,\r\nMcGuire, and some other chiefs kept up a fierce, but rather desultory,\r\nwarfare, greatly annoying the English garrisons in the border\r\nstrongholds. At last, in the early summer of 1595, O’Neill threw off the\r\nmask, unfurled the Red Hand of Ulster, and marched against the Castle of\r\nMonaghan, held by the enemy. In the midst of a siege but feebly carried\r\non for lack of a battering train, he heard that Norreys, with a powerful\r\nforce, was advancing northward to raise the siege. O’Neill at once\r\ndecided to anticipate his movement and moved to Clontibret, about five\r\nmiles off, and there took post. Norreys soon appeared, and, being a hot\r\nsoldier, attacked at once. He was met with a veteran firmness that\r\nastonished him, and both he and his brother, Sir Thomas Norreys, were\r\nwounded in the main attack on the Irish battle-line. At the moment when\r\nall seemed lost for England, Colonel Segrave, an Anglo-Norman of Meath,\r\ncharged the Irish home, with a body of horse, and, for a time, restored\r\nthe battle. Segrave, himself, rushed madly on O’Neill and the two\r\nleaders fought hand to hand for some time, while both armies stood still\r\nto witness the result. Mr. Mitchel thus eloquently describes what\r\nfollowed: “Segrave again dashed his horse against the chief, flung his\r\ngiant frame upon his enemy, and endeavored to unhorse him by the weight\r\nof his gauntleted hand. O’Neill grasped him in his arms, and the\r\ncombatants rolled, in that fatal embrace, to the ground.\r\n\r\n               ‘Now, gallant Saxon! hold thine own—\r\n                No maiden’s hand is round thee thrown!\r\n                That desperate grasp thy frame might feel\r\n                Through bars of brass and triple steel.’\r\n\r\n“There was a moment’s deadly wrestle and a death groan. The shortened\r\nsword of O’Neill was buried in the Englishman’s groin beneath his mail.\r\nThen from the Irish ranks rose such a wild shout of triumph as those\r\nhills had never echoed before. The still thundercloud burst into a\r\ntempest; those equestrian statues became as winged demons, and with\r\ntheir battle-cry of Lamh-dearg-ahoo! (‘The Red Hand to Victory’), and\r\ntheir long lances poised in eastern fashion above their heads, down\r\nswept the chivalry of Tyrone upon the astonished ranks of the Saxon. The\r\nbanner of St. George wavered and went down before that furious charge.\r\nThe English turned their bridle-reins and fled headlong over the stream\r\n(which they had crossed to attack the Irish), leaving the field covered\r\nwith their dead, and, worse than all, leaving with the Irish that proud\r\nred-cross banner, the first of their disgraces in those Ulster wars.\r\nNorreys hastily retreated southward, and the castle of Monaghan was\r\nyielded to O’Neill.”\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, Red Hugh O’Donnell “prevailed mightily” in the\r\nwest, “so that,” says Mitchel, “at the close of the year 1595, the Irish\r\npower predominated both in Ulster and Connaught.” O’Neill followed up\r\nhis success by laying siege to Armagh, which he captured by an ingenious\r\nstratagem. Colonel Stafford had been appointed to the command of the\r\nEnglish in the old city, and he proved himself equal to the occasion, so\r\nfar as fighting bravely to hold it went. But provisions were running\r\nlow, and it was known to Stafford that Norreys was sending to him, from\r\nDundalk, a large convoy of provisions. O’Neill’s scouts had the same\r\ninformation, so a body of Irish was detached to attack the convoy and\r\ncapture the rations. The movement proved successful. About three hundred\r\nEnglish soldiers were made prisoners. O’Neill ordered them to be\r\nstripped of their red surtouts, and bade the same number of his clansmen\r\nto put the garments on their own backs. Then he commanded the convoy to\r\nmarch toward Armagh as if nothing had happened. Meanwhile, he had caused\r\nhis relative, Con O’Neill, to occupy an old ruined abbey near the main\r\ngate of the city. All this was accomplished under cover of the night. At\r\nsunrise, Stafford and his hungry soldiers, from the ramparts, gazed\r\nwistfully southward, and, to their great joy, beheld, as they imagined,\r\nthe convoy marching rapidly to their relief. Almost on the instant, it\r\nwas, seemingly, attacked by the Irish army. Volleys—blank cartridges\r\nbeing used—were exchanged, and many men appeared to fall on both sides.\r\nAt last, the supposititious English seemed about to give way. Stafford\r\nand his famished men could stand the sight no longer. They rushed\r\nthrough the now open gate to the aid of their countrymen, as they\r\nthought. To their amazement, both red coats and saffron shirts fell upon\r\nthem, and they perceived they had been tricked. A brave attempt was made\r\nby them to re-enter the town, but Con O’Neill and his party, rushing\r\nfrom the old ruin, seized the gate. All the English outside the walls\r\nwere captured. Soon afterward, the city itself surrendered to the Irish\r\nleader. O’Neill made humane use of his victory. He disarmed and paroled\r\nthe English prisoners and sent them, under safe escort, back to General\r\nNorreys. He was a man of strict honor, and, no doubt, the terms of the\r\ncapitulation were properly observed. The Irish dismantled Armagh, as\r\nO’Neill had no need of fortresses, but, during his absence elsewhere,\r\nsome English made their way to the place and refortified it; only,\r\nhowever, to have it retaken by the Irish army.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n   Ireland Still Victorious—Battles of Tyrrell’s Pass and Drumfluich\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE year 1597 witnessed the recall of Lord Deputy Russell from the\r\ngovernment of Ireland, and the substitution of Lord De Burgh. A\r\ntemporary truce was entered into by the belligerents, and neither side\r\nlost any time in augmenting its strength. All Ulster was practically\r\nfreed from English rule, but they had garrisons shut up in the castles\r\nof Carrickfergus, Newry, Dundrum, Carlingford, Greencastle, and\r\nOlderfleet—all on the coast. When the truce came to an end, the Palesmen\r\norganized a large force and prepared to send it northward, to aid those\r\ngarrisons, under young Barnewall, son of Lord Trimleston. O’Neill\r\ndetached a force of 400 men under the brave Captain Richard Tyrrell and\r\nhis lieutenant, O’Conor, to ambush and destroy it. Tyrrell moved\r\npromptly to accomplish his mission, and rapidly penetrated to the\r\npresent county of Westmeath. There, at a defile now known as Tyrrell’s\r\nPass, not far from Mullingar, he awaited the coming of the Palesmen. In\r\nthe narrow pass, the latter could not deploy, so that the battle was\r\nfought by the heads of columns, which gave the advantage to the Irish.\r\nSome of the latter managed to get on the flanks of the Palesmen, and a\r\nterrible slaughter ensued. Of the thousand Palesmen, only Barnewall\r\nhimself and one soldier escaped the swords of the vengeful natives. The\r\nformer was brought a prisoner to O’Neill, who held him as a hostage, and\r\nthe soldier carried the dread news of the annihilation of the Meathian\r\nforce to Mullingar.\r\n\r\nBut the Lord Deputy and the Earl of Kildare, with all the force they\r\ncould muster, were in full march for Ulster. Sir Conyers Clifford,\r\nanother veteran Englishman, attempted to join them from the side of\r\nConnaught, but was met by Red Hugh O’Donnell and compelled to go back\r\nthe way he came, leaving many of his men behind him. At a place called\r\nDrumfluich, the Lord Deputy and Kildare, who were en route to recapture\r\nPortmore, which had fallen into the hands of O’Neill, encountered the\r\nIrish army. The latter was strongly posted on the banks of the northern\r\nBlackwater, but the English attacked with great resolution, drove its\r\nvanguard across the river and took possession of Portmore. O’Neill,\r\nhowever, held his main body well in hand, and while De Burgh was\r\ncongratulating himself on his success, fiercely attacked the English who\r\nhad crossed to the left bank of the river, and inflicted on them a most\r\ndisastrous defeat. The Lord Deputy and the Earl of Kildare were both\r\nmortally wounded, and died within a few hours. The English army was\r\npractically destroyed. Red Hugh O’Donnell had arrived in the nick of\r\ntime to complete the victory, and, with him, the Antrim MacDonalds,\r\nwhose prowess received due honor. The historian of Hugh O’Neill says,\r\nsuccinctly: “That battlefield is called Drumfluich. It lies about two\r\nmiles westward from Blackwater-town (built on the site of Portmore), and\r\nBattleford-bridge marks the spot where the English reddened the river in\r\ntheir flight.”\r\n\r\nBut Captain Williams, a valiant “Saxon,” held Portmore, in spite of\r\nO’Neill’s great victory, and this fortress, in the heart of his country,\r\nproved a thorn in the side of Tyrone, who, as we have already mentioned,\r\nwas destitute of battering appliances for many a day. The result at\r\nDrumfluich struck dismay into the hearts of the stoutest soldiers of the\r\nEnglish interest, and the dreaded names of O’Neill and the Blackwater\r\nwere on every trembling lip throughout the Pale. The queen, in London,\r\ngrew very angry, and rated her ministers with unusual vehemence. It was\r\nfortunate for De Burgh and Lord Kildare that they died on the field of\r\nhonor. Otherwise, they would have been disgraced, as was General Norreys\r\nfor his defeat at Clontibret. He died of a broken heart soon after being\r\ndeprived of his command in Ulster.\r\n\r\nThe English were also unfortunate in Connaught and Munster, and when the\r\nEarl of Ormond assumed the government of Ireland, by appointment, after\r\nthe defeat and death of De Burgh, the English interest had fallen lower\r\nin the scale than it had been since the days of Richard II. The earl\r\nentered into a two months’ armistice with O’Neill, and negotiations for\r\na permanent peace were begun. O’Neill’s conditions were: perfect freedom\r\nof religion not only in Ulster but throughout Ireland; reparation for\r\nthe spoil and ravage done upon the Irish country by the garrisons of\r\nNewry and other places, and, finally, entire and undisturbed control by\r\nthe Irish chiefs over their own territories and people. (Moryson,\r\nMcGeoghegan, and Mitchel.)\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth was enraged at these terms, when transmitted to her by\r\nOrmond, and sent a list of counter-terms which O’Neill could not\r\npossibly entertain. He saw there was nothing for it but the edge of the\r\nsword, and grew impatient at the tardiness of King Philip of Spain in\r\nnot sending him aid while he was prosecuting the war for civil and\r\nreligious liberty so powerfully. The English Government, in order to\r\ndiscourage the Catholic powers and keep them from coming to the aid of\r\nIreland, concealed or minimized O’Neill’s splendid victories. Lombard,\r\ncited by McGeoghegan—a most conscientious historian—avers that an\r\nEnglish agent was employed, at Brussels, “to publish pretended\r\nsubmissions, treaties, and pardons, so that the Spanish governor of\r\nFlanders might report to his master that the power of the Irish\r\nCatholics was broken and their cause completely lost.” (Mitchel.) The\r\nsame charge has been made against England in our own day—only in a\r\ndifferent connection. Germany, France, and Russia have semi-officially\r\ndeclared that English agents at Berlin, Paris, and St. Petersburg have\r\npersistently misrepresented the attitude of those countries toward\r\nAmerica during the recent Spanish War. Whatever may have been the truth\r\nregarding the Brussels agent, it is undeniable that King Philip\r\nabandoned Ireland to her fate until it was too late to hinder her ruin;\r\nand that, when Spanish troops landed at Kinsale, in 1601, they proved\r\nmore of a hindrance than a help. O’Neill gave up all hope of assistance\r\nfrom Philip in the fall of 1597 and resolved to stake all on his genius\r\nas a commander, and on the tried valor of the glorious clansmen of\r\nTyrone and Tyrconnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n  Irish Victory of the Yellow Ford, Called the Bannockburn of Ireland\r\n\r\n\r\nWE dwell at greater length on the Elizabethan era in Ireland than,\r\nperhaps, on any other, because then began the really fatal turn in the\r\nfortunes of the Irish nation. Notwithstanding splendid triumphs in the\r\nfield, cunning and treachery were fated to overcome patriotism and\r\nheroic courage. But, before this great cloud gloomed upon her, Ireland\r\nwas still destined to witness many days of glory, and to win her most\r\nrenowned victory.\r\n\r\nThe spring and early summer of 1598 saw Captain Williams still holding\r\nPortmore, on the Blackwater, stubbornly for England, but his rations\r\nwere nearly exhausted and he managed to get word of his desperate\r\ncondition to Marshal Bagnal, who, at the head of a splendidly appointed\r\narmy of veteran troops, horse and foot, marched northward from Newry to\r\nhis succor. His first operations were successful and he came very near\r\nto capturing O’Neill himself, at a place called Mullaghbane, not far\r\nfrom Armagh. Then Bagnal pushed on to raise the siege of Portmore, where\r\nWilliams was living on his starved horses and suffering all the pangs of\r\nhunger.\r\n\r\nO’Neill, having been fully informed of Marshal Bagnal’s progress,\r\nsummoned O’Donnell and his other allies to join him immediately, which\r\nthey did. He left Portmore to the famine-stricken garrison, and turned\r\nhis face southward fully resolved to give battle to his redoubted\r\nbrother-in-law before he could reach the Blackwater. Thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the character of the country through which the English\r\nwere to pass, he had no difficulty in choosing his ground. He took post,\r\ntherefore, in the hilly, wooded, and marshy angle formed by the Callan\r\nand Blackwater Rivers, at a point where a sluggish rivulet runs from a\r\nlarge bog toward the main river, and which is called, in the Gaelic\r\ntongue, Beal-an-atha-buidhe, in English, “the Mouth of the Yellow Ford,”\r\ndestined to give title to the Irish Bannockburn. This field is about two\r\nand one-half miles N.W. from Armagh.\r\n\r\nThe superb English array, all glittering in steel armor and with their\r\narms flashing back pencils of sunlight, Bagnal himself in the van,\r\nappeared at the opening of the wooded pass, which, all unknown to the\r\nmarshal, was garrisoned by five hundred Irish kerns early on the sultry\r\nmorning of August 10th—T. D. McGee says the 15th—1598. The head of the\r\ncolumn was attacked immediately by the Celtic infantry, who, however,\r\nobedient to orders, soon fell back on the main body, which was drawn up\r\nbehind a breastwork, in front of which was a long trench, dug pretty\r\ndeep, and concealed by wattles (dry sticks) and fresh-cut sods—a\r\nstratagem borrowed by O’Neill from the tactics of Bruce, so successfully\r\nput in practice at Bannockburn, nearly three centuries before. Having\r\nfinally cleared the pass, not without copious bloodshed, Bagnal\r\ndebouched from it, and deployed his forces on the plain in face of the\r\nIrish army. His cavalry, under Generals Brooke, Montacute, and Fleming,\r\nshouting, “St. George for England!” charged fiercely up to the Irish\r\ntrench, where the horses floundered in the covered trap set for them,\r\nand then the Irish foot, leaping over their breastwork, piked to death\r\nthe unfortunate riders. Bagnal, in no wise daunted, pressed on with his\r\nchosen troops, animating them by shout and gesture. A part of the Irish\r\nworks, battered by his cannon, was carried, and the English thought the\r\nbattle won. They were preparing to follow up their success when,\r\nsuddenly, O’Neill himself appeared, at the head of his main body, who\r\nhad abandoned their slight defences, and came on to meet the English\r\nwith flashing musketry and “push of pike.” Bagnal’s artillery, with\r\nwhich he was well provided, did much damage to O’Neill’s men, but\r\nnothing could withstand the Irish charge that day. O’Donnell’s dashing\r\nclan nobly seconded their kinsmen of Tyrone, and a most desperate\r\nconflict ensued. Bagnal and his soldiers deported themselves bravely, as\r\nbecame tried warriors, but, in the crisis of the fight, the marshal\r\nfell, a wagon-load of powder exploded in the English lines, their ranks\r\nbecame confused, and few of their regiments preserved their formation.\r\nThe Irish cavalry destroyed utterly what remained of the English horse.\r\n“By this time,” says Mitchel, “the cannon were all taken; the cries of\r\n‘St. George’ had failed or were turned to death-shrieks, and once more,\r\nEngland’s royal standard sank before the Red Hand of Tyrone.” The\r\nEnglish rout was appalling, and the chronicler of O’Donnell says: “They\r\nwere pursued in couples, in threes, in scores, in thirties, and in\r\nhundreds.” At a point where the carnage was greatest, the country people\r\nstill show the traveler the Bloody Loaming (lane) which was choked with\r\ncorpses on that day of slaughter. Two thousand five hundred English\r\nsoldiers perished in the battle and flight; and among the fallen were\r\nthe marshal, as already related, twenty-two other superior officers, and\r\na large number of captains, lieutenants, and ensigns. The immediate\r\nspoils of the victory were 12,000 gold pieces, thirty-four standards,\r\nall the musical instruments and cannon, and an immense booty in wagons,\r\nloaded with clothing and provisions. The Irish army lost 200 in killed\r\nand three times that number wounded. By O’Neill’s orders, the dead of\r\nboth sides were piously buried. (Irish annals cited by Curry and\r\nMitchel.)\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott, in his graphic poem of “Rokeby,” which should be read\r\nby all students, as it deals with a stirring period of English history,\r\nthus refers to the battle of the Yellow Ford:\r\n\r\n                “Who has not heard, while Erin yet\r\n                 Strove ’gainst the Saxon’s iron bit,\r\n                 Who has not heard how brave O’Neill\r\n                 In English blood imbrued his steel;\r\n                 Against St. George’s cross blazed high\r\n                 The banners of his tanistry—\r\n                 To fiery Essex gave the foil\r\n                 And reigned a prince on Ulster soil?\r\n                 But chief arose his victor pride\r\n                 When that brave marshal fought and died,\r\n                 And Avonduff[2] to ocean bore\r\n                 His billows red with Saxon gore.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Blackwater.\r\n\r\nThe survivors of Bagnal’s heroic, if defeated, army, fled to Armagh,\r\nwhich had again fallen into the possession of the English, and there\r\ntook shelter. O’Neill invested the place and, being now provided with\r\nartillery, captured from the enemy, speedily compelled its surrender.\r\nThe gallant Williams, starved out at Portmore, also capitulated.\r\nO’Neill, with his customary magnanimity, after depriving the prisoners\r\nof both places of their arms, took their parole and sent them in safety\r\nto the Pale, and, for a time, all English power whatever vanished from\r\nthe soil of Ulster.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n How O’Neill Baffled Essex—O’Donnell’s Victory of the Curlew Mountains\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE limits of this simple narrative of Irish history will not permit us\r\nto go into the details of the numerous “risings” of the Irish and\r\nencounters with the disheartened English in the other three provinces.\r\nO’Donnell swept through Connaught, like a very besom of destruction,\r\ndrove the English generals into their castles, and other strong places,\r\nand carried Athenry by storm, “sword in hand.” He also made a raid into\r\nMunster, and punished a degenerate O’Brien of Inchiquin for accepting an\r\nEnglish title, and hugging his English chain as “Earl of Thomond.” Then\r\nhe returned to Connaught and finished up what English garrisons still\r\nremained there, with few exceptions. O’Neill himself also made a visit\r\nto Munster, said his prayers at the noble shrine of Holy Cross Abbey, on\r\nthe winding Suir, and, the legitimate—according to English notions—Earl\r\nof Desmond being dead, set up an earl of his own. He “put heart into”\r\nthe rather slow and cautious Catholic Anglo-Normans of this province,\r\nand caused them to join hands with their Celtic brothers in defence of\r\ncountry and creed. Under the new earl, they attacked the English with\r\ngreat spirit, and, although occasionally beaten, managed to hold the\r\nupper hand in most cases.\r\n\r\nIn Leinster, the O’Mores, the O’Byrnes, the O’Tuhills, and the Kavanaghs\r\nhad also risen in arms, and never had Ireland presented so united a\r\nmilitary front, since the first landing of the English on her shore.\r\nThere was fighting everywhere, but, outside of O’Neill and O’Donnell,\r\nand, perhaps, the new Desmond, there would not seem to have been a\r\nconcerted military plan—probably owing to the rather long distances\r\nbetween the respective bodies and the difficulty of communication.\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth, when she heard of the Irish triumph at the Yellow Ford,\r\nwas violently exasperated, and stormed against Ormond, her Lord\r\nLieutenant, for remaining in Leinster, skirmishing with the O’Mores and\r\nother secondary forces, and leaving everything in the hands of O’Neill\r\nin Ulster. She was now an aged woman, but still vain and thirsty for\r\nadmiration. Her reigning favorite was the brilliant Robert Devereux,\r\nEarl of Essex, who had made a reputation in the Spanish wars. In the\r\nmiddle of 1599, this favored warrior, accompanied by a picked force of\r\nat least 20,000 men, landed in Dublin and assumed chief command. Instead\r\nof at once moving with his fine army, reinforced by the Palesmen and the\r\nrelics of Norreys’ and Bagnal’s troops, against O’Neill, he imitated the\r\ndilatory tactics of Ormond and wasted away his strength in petty\r\nencounters with the hostile tribes of Leinster and the Anglo-Irish of\r\nMunster, most of whom sided, because of common religious belief, with\r\ntheir Celtic neighbors. He also committed the grave fault of bestowing\r\nhigh command on favorites who possessed no capacity for such duties.\r\nWhile marching to besiege Cahir Castle, in the present county of\r\nTipperary, he was obliged to pass through a wooded defile in Leix\r\n(Queen’s County), where his rearguard of cavalry was attacked by the\r\nfierce O’Mores and cut to pieces. The Irish tore the white plumes from\r\nthe helmets of the fallen English troopers, as trophies, and so great\r\nwas their number that the gorge has been called, ever since that\r\ntragical day, Bearna-na-cleite—in English, the “Pass of Plumes.” Essex,\r\nnotwithstanding this disaster, which he made no immediate effort to\r\navenge, marched to Cahir and took the castle; but, in subsequent\r\nencounters with the Munster Irish, he suffered severe reverses. Near\r\nCroom, in Limerick, he was met by the Geraldines and their allies and\r\nbadly defeated. Sir Thomas Norreys, Lord President of Munster—brother of\r\nthe defeated English commander at Clontibret—was among the slain. Thus\r\nbaffled, the haughty Essex made his way sadly back to Dublin, pursued\r\nfor a whole week by the victorious Geraldines. Smarting under his\r\ndisgrace, he caused the decimation of an English regiment that had fled\r\nfrom the O’Mores—something he himself had also been in the habit of\r\ndoing. He had no heart to try conclusions with the terrible O’Neill in\r\nhis Ulster fastnesses, and sent many letters of excuse to the queen, in\r\nwhich he dwelt on the strength and courage of the Irish clansmen in war,\r\nand asked for further reinforcements, before venturing against O’Neill.\r\nThese were sent him, to the number of several thousand, and, at length,\r\nhe seemed ready to move. Sir Conyers Clifford, a very brave and skilful\r\nofficer, commanded for Elizabeth in Connaught. Essex ordered him to\r\nmarch into Ulster and seize certain strategic points that would open the\r\nway for the main army when it should finally appear in the North.\r\nClifford obeyed his orders with veteran promptitude. He was soon at\r\nBoyle, in the present county of Roscommon, where he went into camp near\r\nthe beautiful abbey, whose ruins are still the admiration of\r\nantiquarians. Thence, he marched northward through the passes of the\r\nCorslibh, or Curlew, Mountains, bent upon penetrating into Ulster. But,\r\nin a heavily timbered ravine, he was fallen upon by the fierce clansmen\r\nof Red Hugh O’Donnell, commanded by their fiery chief in person. When\r\nthe English heard the terrible war-cry of “O’Donnell Aboo!” “O’Donnell\r\nto Victory”) echoing along the pass, they knew their hour had come.\r\nHowever, they met their fate like brave men, worthy of their gallant\r\ncommander, and fought desperately, although in vain. They were soon\r\ntotally broken and fell in heaps under the stalwart blows of the Clan\r\nO’Donnell. General Clifford and his second in command, Sir Henry\r\nRatcliffe, were killed, and their infantry, unable to stem the tide of\r\nbattle, fled in disorder, carrying with them the cavalry, under General\r\nJephson, a cool commander who displayed all the qualities of a good\r\nsoldier although completely overmatched. Had he not gallantly covered\r\nthe retreat, hardly a man of the English infantry would have reached\r\nBoyle in safety. But the valor of Jephson did not extend to all of his\r\nmen, some of whom abandoned the field rather precipitately. The English\r\nhistorian, Moryson, excuses them on the ground that “their ammunition\r\nwas all spent.” Sligo, the key of North Connaught, fell to O’Donnell, as\r\none result of this sharp engagement.\r\n\r\nThe defeat and death of Clifford would seem to have utterly demoralized\r\nEssex. He again hesitated to advance against O’Neill, and, instead of\r\ndoing so, weakly sought a parley with his able enemy. O’Neill agreed to\r\nthe proposal, and they met near Dundalk, on the banks of a river and in\r\npresence of their chief officers. The Irish general, with chivalrous\r\ncourtesy, spurred his charger half-way across the stream, but Essex\r\nremained on the opposite bank. This, however, did not prevent the two\r\nleaders from holding a protracted conversation, in the course of which\r\nthe wily O’Neill completely outwitted the English peer. They called five\r\nofficers on both sides into the conference, and O’Neill repeated the\r\nterms he offered after the victory of Clontibret, in 1595. The\r\nEnglishman said he did not think them extravagant, but his sincerity was\r\nnever tested. Soon afterward, angered by an epistolary outburst from the\r\nold queen, he threw up his command, and returned to the London court,\r\nwhere Elizabeth swore at him, ordered him under arrest, had him tried\r\nfor treason, and, finally, beheaded—the only cruel act of her stormy\r\nlife she ever repented of. The axe that severed the head of Essex from\r\nhis body left a scar in Elizabeth’s withered heart that never healed.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n  King Philip Sends Envoys to O’Neill—The Earl of Mountjoy Lord Deputy\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIP II of Spain died in September, 1598, and was succeeded by his son\r\nPhilip III, who, it would seem, took more interest in the Irish struggle\r\nagainst Elizabeth’s temporal and spiritual power than did his father.\r\nPhilip, in all likelihood, cared very little about Ireland’s national\r\naspirations, but, like all of his race, he was a zealous Catholic, and\r\nrecognized the self-evident fact that the Irish were, then, fighting not\r\nalone their own battle but also that of the Church, with heroic vigor.\r\nO’Neill began negotiations with the young monarch immediately after his\r\naccession, and Philip responded by sending two envoys to the Irish\r\ngeneral—Don Martin de la Cerda and the Most Rev. Matthias de Oriedo, who\r\nhad been appointed by the Pope Archbishop of Dublin—a purely titular\r\noffice, seeing that the English were in full possession of that capital.\r\nThe bishop presented O’Neill with “a Phœnix plume,” blessed by his\r\nHoliness, and also with 22,000 pieces of gold—a generous contribution in\r\nthat age, when money was much more valuable in proportion than it is\r\nnow. (O’Sullivan, Moryson, and Mitchel.)\r\n\r\nO’Neill, having sufficiently awed the English generals for a period,\r\nmade a sort of “royal progress” through Munster and Leinster, visiting\r\nholy places, settling feuds, and inspecting military forces. He met\r\nwith, practically, no opposition, but, near Cork, had the misfortune to\r\nlose his gallant cavalry commander, Hugh McGuire, chief of Fermanagh.\r\nThe latter was leading a body of horse on a reconnoitring mission, when\r\nsuddenly there appeared a force of English cavalry, bent on a similar\r\nerrand, under Sir Warham St. Leger and Sir Henry Power, Queen’s\r\nCommissioners, acting in place of Sir Thomas Norreys. St. Leger rode up\r\nto McGuire and discharged a horse pistol at close range. The heroic\r\nIrish chief reeled in his saddle from a mortal wound, but, before\r\nfalling, struck St. Leger a crushing blow on the head with his\r\ntruncheon, and killed him on the spot. McGuire, having avenged himself\r\non his enemy, died on the instant. These were the only two who fell. The\r\nEnglish retreated to Cork and kept within its walls until O’Neill had\r\nleft the neighborhood. The Ulster prince turned back through Ormond and\r\nWestmeath and arrived in his own country, “without meeting an enemy,\r\nalthough there was then in Ireland a royal army amounting, after all the\r\nhavoc made in it during the past year, to 14,400 foot and 1,230\r\nhorse”—this, too, exclusive of irregular forces. (Moryson.) This force\r\nwas well provided with artillery and all military stores. (Mitchel.)\r\n\r\nBut O’Neill’s days of almost unclouded triumph were drawing to a close.\r\nHe was, at last, about to meet an English commander who, if not as able\r\nas himself, was infinitely more cunning and unscrupulous. This was\r\nCharles Blount, Earl of Mountjoy, a trained soldier, a veteran diplomat,\r\na fierce Protestant theologian, and a ripe scholar. His motto, on\r\nassuming the duties of Lord Deputy in Ireland, would seem to have been\r\n“Divide and Conquer.” Mountjoy saw, at once, that steel alone could not\r\nnow subdue Ireland, and he was determined to resort to other methods,\r\nmore potent but less manly. About the same time, there also came to\r\nIreland two other famous English generals, Sir George Carew and Sir\r\nHenry Dowcra. The new deputy brought with him large reinforcements, so\r\nthat the English army in Ireland was more powerful than it had ever been\r\nbefore; and Mountjoy’s orders were, in effect, that Ulster, in\r\nparticular, should be honeycombed with royal garrisons, especially along\r\nits coast-line. Although Mountjoy himself was checked, at the outset, by\r\nO’Neill’s army, Sir Henry Dowcra, with a powerful force, transported by\r\nsea from Carrickfergus, occupied and fortified the hill of Derry, on the\r\nFoyle—the ground on which now stands the storied city of Londonderry.\r\nOther border garrisons were strengthened by the Lord Deputy, and\r\neverything was made ready for a vigorous prosecution of the war. The\r\npenal laws against the Irish Catholics were softened, so as, if\r\npossible, to detach the Anglo-Irish Catholics from the Celtic Catholic\r\nIrish, and also to impress the weak-kneed among the latter with “the\r\nfriendly intentions of her Majesty’s government”—very much like the\r\ncourt language in use to-day. The bait took, as might have been\r\nexpected—for every good cause has its Iscariots—and we soon hear of\r\njealous kinsmen of the patriot chiefs “coming over to” the queen’s\r\n“interest” and doing their utmost—the heartless scoundrels—to divide and\r\ndistract the strength of their country, engaged in a deadly struggle for\r\nher rights and liberty. These despicable wretches are foul blotches on\r\nthe pages of Ireland’s history. But for them, she could have finally\r\nshaken off the English yoke, which would have saved Ireland centuries of\r\nmartyrdom and England centuries of shame. And so we find Sir Arthur\r\nO’Neill becoming “the queen’s O’Neill”—his branch of the family had long\r\nbeen in the English interest; Connor Roe McGuire becoming “the queen’s\r\nMcGuire,” and so on _ad nauseam_. These creatures had no love for\r\nEngland or Elizabeth, but simply hoped to further their own selfish ends\r\nby disloyalty to their chiefs and treason to their country. We confess\r\nthat this is a chapter of Irish history from which we would gladly turn\r\nin pure disgust did not our duty, as a writer of history, compel us to\r\ndwell upon it yet a while longer. Dermot O’Connor, who held a command\r\nunder O’Neill’s Desmond in Munster, yielded to the seductions of Carew\r\nand turned upon his leader, in the interest of his brother-in-law, son\r\nof the “great earl,” who was held as a hostage in London Tower by\r\nElizabeth, and was now used as a firebrand to stir up feud and faction\r\namong the Munster Irish. Mountjoy had not been many months in Ireland,\r\nwhen, to use the words of the historian Mitchel, “a network of English\r\nintrigue and perfidy covered the land, until the leaders of the (Irish)\r\nconfederacy in Munster knew not whom to trust, or where they were safe\r\nfrom treason and assassination.” Dermot O’Connor was willing to\r\nsurrender Desmond, whom he had kidnapped, to Mountjoy, for a thousand\r\npounds, but, before he could receive his blood-money, the “Suggawn\r\n(hay-rope) Earl,” as he was called in derision by the English faction,\r\nwas rescued by his kinsman, Pierce Lacy. But the White Knight—frightful\r\nmisnomer—another relative of the earl—was more fortunate than O’Connor.\r\nHe managed to receive the thousand pounds, delivered Desmond to Carew,\r\nand earned enduring infamy. The “Suggawn Earl” was sent to London and\r\ndied a miserable prisoner in the Tower.\r\n\r\nThus, the policy of the Lord Deputy was doing its deadly work in Munster\r\nand also in Leinster, where the Irish were of mixed race, and where\r\nracial animosity could be more easily worked upon than in Ulster and\r\nConnaught, where most of the ancient clans still remained unbroken and\r\nuncontaminated by foreign influences. Yet Ulster and Connaught had their\r\nBenedict Arnolds, too, as we have shown in the cases of O’Neill and\r\nMcGuire, and will show in other cases which yet remain to be mentioned.\r\nBut in these provinces the war was national as well as religious, while\r\nin Munster it was almost entirely religious. Most of the Catholic\r\nAnglo-Irish would have fought with the English rather than the\r\nCeltic-Irish, if their religion had been tolerated from the first. Among\r\nthe Celtic Irish chiefs who went over to the English in Munster, were\r\nO’Sullivan More and McCarthy More (the Great). The latter had the\r\ncowardly excuse that his strong-minded wife had coerced him into\r\ntreason, and refused to live with him until he came to terms with the\r\nenemy. Was there ever anything more disgraceful in the history of\r\nmanhood and womanhood? They were, indeed, a couple entirely worthy of\r\neach other. The Lord Deputy, in the meantime, had ravaged the\r\n“rebellious” portions of Leinster, burning houses and crops, and doing\r\nother evil things common to the savage warfare of that period. His\r\ngreatest piece of luck, however, was the killing of the brave O’More of\r\nLeix in a skirmish. (Mitchel.)\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n Ireland’s Fortunes Take a Bad Turn—Defeat of O’Neill and O’Donnell at\r\n                                Kinsale\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE English force in Ireland was now (1600-1601) overwhelming, and as\r\nthe Irish had no fleet whatever, the English were enabled to plant\r\ngarrisons, almost wherever they wished to, around the Ulster coast, and\r\nsometimes posts were also established in the interior of the country.\r\nThus Derry, Dun-na-long, Lifford, and numerous other places held strong\r\ngarrisons, and these sallied forth at will—the small Irish army being\r\nactively engaged elsewhere—and inflicted heavy damage on the harmless\r\npeople of the surrounding districts. The process of crop-burning was in\r\nfull blast again, and such Irish people as escaped the sword and the\r\nhalter had the horrible vision of perishing by famine ever before their\r\neyes. O’Neill and O’Donnell were aware of all this, and did the best\r\nthey could, under such discouraging circumstances. They were almost at\r\nthe end of their resources, and awaited anxiously for the aid, in men\r\nand money, solemnly promised them by the envoy of Philip of Spain. To\r\nadd to their ever-growing embarrassment, Niall Garbh (“the Rough”)\r\nO’Donnell, cousin of Red Hugh, and the fiercest warrior of Clan-Conal,\r\nrevolted, because of some fancied slight, and also, no doubt, inflamed\r\nby unworthy ambition, against the chief, and went over to the enemy.\r\nUnfortunately, some of the clansmen, who did not look beyond personal\r\nattachment, followed his dishonored fortunes, but this was about the\r\nonly serious case of clan defection. The great body of the Irish\r\ngalloglasses and kerns—heavy and light infantry—remained true to their\r\ncountry and their God, and died fighting for both to the last.\r\n\r\nNiall Garbh, after allying himself with the English, occupied the\r\nbeautiful Franciscan monastery of Donegal, in which the Annals of the\r\nFour Masters, Ireland’s chronological history, were compiled. Red Hugh,\r\nfiercely indignant, marched against the sacrilegious traitor and laid\r\nsiege to him in the holy place. After three months’ investment, it was\r\ntaken by storm, and utterly destroyed by fire, except for a few walls\r\nwhich still remain. The traitor’s brother, Conn O’Donnell, and several\r\nof the misguided clansmen were killed in the conflict, but,\r\nunfortunately, Niall Garbh himself escaped, to still further disgrace\r\nthe heroic name of O’Donnell and injure the hapless country that gave\r\nbirth to such a monster.\r\n\r\nMountjoy, after frequent indecisive skirmishes with O’Neill, amused\r\nhimself by offering a reward of £2,000 for that chieftain’s head, and\r\nsmaller amounts for those of his most important lieutenants. But no man\r\nwas found among the faithful clansmen of Tyrone to murder his chief for\r\nthe base bribe of the Lord Deputy. Yet Mountjoy continued to gain ground\r\nin Ulster, little by little, and he built more forts, commanding\r\nimportant passes, and garrisoned them in great force. He also caused\r\nmost of the woods to be cut away, and thus laid the O’Neill territory\r\nwide open for a successful invasion. O’Neill was an admirable officer,\r\nand still, assisted by Hugh O’Donnell, presented a gallant front to\r\nMountjoy, but he could do little that was effective against an enemy who\r\nhad five times the number of soldiers that he had, and could thus man\r\nimportant posts, filled with all the munitions of war, without sensibly\r\nweakening his force in the field. Destitute of foundries and powder\r\nfactories, he could make no progress in the matter of artillery, and\r\nsuch cannon as he had were destitute of proper ammunition. All this the\r\nSpaniards could have supplied, but their characteristic dilatoriness, in\r\nthe end, ruined everything. Another circumstance also militated against\r\nthe success of the brave O’Neill—the English and their allies were\r\nsolidly unified for the destruction of the Irish, while the latter, as\r\nwe have seen, were fatally divided by corruption, ambition,\r\njealousy—fostered by their enemies—and endless English intrigue. No\r\nwonder that his broad brow grew gloomy and that his sword no longer\r\nstruck the blows it dealt so fiercely at Clontibret and the Yellow Ford.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, out of the dark clouds that surrounded his fortunes,\r\nthere flashed one sun-ray of hope and joy. News suddenly reached the\r\nnorth, as well as the Lord Deputy, that a Spanish fleet had landed in\r\nKinsale Harbor, on the coast of Cork. It carried a small force—less than\r\n6,000 men, mostly of poor quality—under the command of the arrogant and\r\nincompetent Don Juan de Aguila. He occupied Kinsale and the surrounding\r\nforts at once, but was disappointed when the Munster Irish—already all\r\nbut crushed by Mountjoy—did not flock at once, and in great numbers, to\r\nhis standard. Of all the Munster chiefs there responded only O’Sullivan\r\nBeare, O’Connor Kerry, and the brave O’Driscoll. They alone redeemed, in\r\nas far as they could, the apathy of South Munster, and were justified in\r\nresenting the Spanish taunt, bitterly uttered by Don Juan himself, that\r\n“Christ had never died for such people.” The Spaniard did not, of\r\ncourse, take into consideration, because he did not know, the exhaustion\r\nof South Munster after the Geraldine war and the wars which succeeded\r\nit. Constant defeat is a poor tonic on which to build up a boldly\r\naggressive patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe news of the landing at Kinsale reached Red Hugh O’Donnell while he\r\nwas in the act of besieging his own castle of Donegal, surreptitiously\r\nseized by Niall Garbh, “the Queen’s O’Donnell,” while he was absent “at\r\nthe front,” with O’Neill. He instantly raised the siege, and, summoning\r\nall of his forces, marched southward without an hour’s delay, as became\r\nhis ardent and gallant nature. Neither did O’Neill hesitate to abandon\r\n“the line of the Blackwater,” which guarded his own castle of Dungannon,\r\nto its fate, and at once marched his forces toward Kinsale. The\r\nClan-Conal marched at “the route step,” through Breffni and Hy-Many,\r\ncrossing the Shannon near where it narrows at the east end of Lough\r\nDearg. On through the Ormonds, where “the heath-brown Slieve Bloom”\r\nmountains rise in their beauty, they pressed, burning, at every\r\nfootstep, to reach Kinsale, join the Spaniards, and “have it out” with\r\nMountjoy and the English. O’Donnell, marching in lighter order and by a\r\ndifferent route, outstripped his older confederate, but narrowly escaped\r\nbeing intercepted in Tipperary by a superior English force, under\r\nGeneral Carew, detached by the Lord Deputy for that purpose. As Red Hugh\r\nhad no intention of giving battle until reinforced by O’Neill, or he had\r\njoined the Spaniards, he made a clever flank movement, by forced march,\r\nover the Slieve Felim Hills, which interposed between him and Limerick.\r\nBut the rains had been heavy of late, the mountain passes were boggy,\r\nand neither horses nor carriages (wagons) could pass. Fortunately, it\r\nwas the beginning of winter, and, one night, there came a sharp frost,\r\nwhich sufficiently hardened the ground, and the Irish army, taking\r\nadvantage of the kindness of Providence, marched ahead throughout the\r\ndark hours, and, by morning, had left Carew and his army hopelessly in\r\nrear. O’Donnell made thirty-two miles (Irish), about forty-two English\r\nmiles, in that movement and halted at Croom, having accomplished the\r\ngreatest march, with baggage, recorded in those hard campaigns. (Pacata\r\nHibernia, cited by Mitchel.)\r\n\r\nHis coming among them, as well as the news of the arrival of the\r\nSpaniards, put fresh life into the Irish of West Munster, and, indeed,\r\nRed Hugh stood on scant ceremony with such degenerate Irish as refused\r\nto fight for their country, so that wherever he marched, fresh patriots,\r\neager to “save their bacon,” in many cases, sprang up like crops of\r\nmushrooms. At Castlehaven he formed a junction with 700 newly arrived\r\nSpanish troops, and, together, they marched toward Kinsale, which\r\nMountjoy and Carew were preparing to invest. O’Neill and his brave\r\nlieutenant, Richard Tyrrell, did not pursue the route taken by\r\nO’Donnell, but had to fight their way through Leinster and North Munster\r\nwith considerable loss. At Bandon, in South Munster, they fell in with\r\nO’Donnell and the Spaniards, and all marched to form an immediate\r\njunction with De Aguila. Mitchel, quoting from O’Sullivan’s narrative,\r\ngives the total strength of the force under O’Neill and O’Donnell at\r\n6,000 foot and 500 horse. The Irish leader was opposed to risking a\r\ngeneral engagement with so small a command, although O’Donnell, when he\r\nbeheld Mountjoy’s troops beleaguering the town, wanted to attack, which,\r\njudging by after events, might have been the better plan. O’Neill\r\nargued, however, that the inclement season would soon destroy a good\r\npart of the English soldiers and counseled delay. O’Donnell yielded\r\nreluctantly, and then the Irish, very badly provided, intrenched\r\nthemselves and began “besieging the besiegers.” Prudence, on this\r\noccasion, ruined the cause of Ireland—so often ruined by rashness,\r\nbefore and since; for, three days after O’Neill’s policy had been\r\nacceded to, that is on Christmas eve, 1601, accident brought on an\r\nengagement, in the dark, which neither party seems to have anticipated.\r\nThe tragedy is best related by Mitchel in his life of O’Neill, thus:\r\n“Before dawn, on the morning of the 24th (December), Sir Richard Graham,\r\nwho commanded the night guard of horse, sent word to the deputy that the\r\nscouts had discovered the matches (matchlock muskets were used at this\r\nperiod) flashing in great numbers in the darkness, and that O’Neill must\r\nbe approaching the camp in force. Instantly the troops were called to\r\narms; messengers were despatched to the Earl of Thomond’s quarter, with\r\norders to draw out his men. The deputy (Mountjoy) now advanced to meet\r\nthe Irish, whom he supposed to be stealing on his camp, and seems to\r\nhave effectually surprised them, while endeavoring to prevent a surprise\r\nupon himself. The infantry of O’Neill’s army retired slowly about a mile\r\nfurther from the town, and made a stand on the bank of a ford, where\r\ntheir position was strengthened by a bog in flank. Wingfield, the\r\nmarshal, thought he saw some confusion in their ranks, and entreated the\r\ndeputy that he might be allowed to charge. The Earl of Clanricarde\r\njoined the marshal and the battle became general. O’Neill’s cavalry\r\nrepeatedly drove back both Wingfield and Clanricarde, until Sir Henry\r\nDanvers, with Captains Taaffe and Fleming, came up to their assistance,\r\nwhen, at length, the Irish infantry fell into confusion and fled.\r\nAnother body of them, under Tyrrell, was still unbroken, and long\r\nmaintained their ground on a hill, but at length, seeing their comrades\r\nrouted, they also gave way and retreated in good order after their main\r\nbody. The northern cavalry covered the retreat, and O’Neill and\r\nO’Donnell, by amazing personal exertions, succeeded in preserving order\r\nand preventing it from becoming a total rout.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the unfortunate battle of Kinsale—the most disastrous, perhaps,\r\nin Irish annals. It was not even well fought, because the Irish troops,\r\nsurprised in their sleep, owing to lack of vigilance on the part of the\r\nsentinels, had lost most of their effective arms, their baggage, and\r\ncolors at the outset. Their camp, also, came into immediate possession\r\nof the enemy. Thus, they were discouraged—the Irish character being\r\nmercurial, like the French—if not badly demoralized, and they did not,\r\nin this ill-fated action, fight with a resolution worthy of the fame\r\nthey had rightfully earned as soldiers of the first class, nor did they\r\nfaithfully respond, as heretofore, to the military genius of their\r\njustly renowned leaders. They were mostly the troops of Ulster, far from\r\nhome, and lacking the inspiration that comes to all men when conscious\r\nthat they are fighting to defend their own hearths against the spoiler.\r\nUlster, in that day, was almost alien to the southern province, although\r\nthe soldiers of both were fighting in a common cause. Kinsale was,\r\ncertainly, not a battle to which Ireland can look back with feelings of\r\npride, but she may be thankful that there are few such gloomy failures\r\nrecorded in her military annals. Yet the bitter fact remains that\r\nKinsale clouded forever the glory achieved by the troops of O’Neill and\r\nO’Donnell on so many fields of victory. The Spaniards, who had joined\r\nO’Donnell on the march, refused to fly and were almost all destroyed.\r\nTheir commander, Del Campo, two officers, and forty soldiers were all\r\nthat survived out of seven hundred men, and they were made prisoners of\r\nwar. (Mitchel.) In a note, this author, quoting Pacata Hibernia, says:\r\n“The most merciless of all Mountjoy’s army that day was the Anglo-Irish\r\nand Catholic Earl of Clanricarde. He slew twenty of the Irish with his\r\nown hand, and cried aloud to ‘spare no rebels.’ Carew (the English\r\ngeneral and writer) says that ‘no man did bloody his sword more than his\r\nlordship that day.’” This episode shows how well Mountjoy’s policy of\r\n“Divide and Conquer” and temporary toleration of the Catholics worked\r\nfor the English cause. Had the penal laws not been mitigated this\r\nAnglo-Irish and Catholic Earl of Clanricarde would have fought on the\r\nside of Ireland.\r\n\r\nDe Aguila, seeing that the Irish army was defeated, and that another\r\neffort on the part of O’Neill was rendered impossible by the loss of his\r\nmunitions and the lateness of the season, proposed to capitulate. The\r\nEarl of Mountjoy offered him honorable terms, and De Aguila agreed to\r\nsurrender to the English all the Irish castles on the coast to which\r\nSpanish garrisons had been admitted, “and shortly after,” says Mitchel,\r\n“set sail for Spain, carrying with him all his artillery, treasure, and\r\nmilitary stores.” Some of the Irish chiefs, notably the O’Sullivan\r\nBeare, refused to ratify that part of De Aguila’s capitulation which\r\nagreed to surrender their castles, occupied by Spanish troops, to the\r\nEnglish. The fortresses had been thrown open to the Spaniards in good\r\nfaith, and General de Aguila had no moral right to give them up. The\r\nmost he could agree to do was to withdraw his men from the Irish castles\r\nand take them back with him to Spain. And this was the view taken by the\r\nIrish chiefs, with bloody, but glorious, result, as we shall see.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n        Sad Death of O’Donnell in Spain—Heroic Defence of Dunboy\r\n\r\n\r\nO’NEILL, when he perceived the hopelessness of the Irish situation in\r\nMunster, conducted what remained of his defeated army back to the north\r\nand cantoned it along the Blackwater for the winter months, where he\r\nfelt quite sure the English, worn out by their exertions at the siege\r\nand battle of Kinsale, would not attack him. Red Hugh O’Donnell,\r\nexasperated beyond endurance at the disregard of his bold advice to\r\nattack the beleaguering English, in conjunction with the Spaniards, on\r\nthe first arrival of the Irish army before Kinsale, gave up the command\r\nof his clan to his brother, Roderick, and, with a few followers, sailed\r\nfor Spain, in search of further aid. He resolved to ask King Philip for\r\nan army, not a detachment. The chief landed at Coruna, and was received\r\nwith high honors by the Spanish authorities. He finally reached the\r\nSpanish Court and placed the whole Irish situation clearly before\r\nPhilip, who promised a powerful force and actually gave orders to\r\nprepare at once for a new expedition to Ireland. The sad sequel is well\r\ntold in the eloquent words of Mitchel:\r\n\r\n“But that armament never sailed, and poor O’Donnell never saw Ireland\r\nmore; for news reached Spain, a few months after, that Dunboy Castle,\r\nthe last stronghold in Munster that held out for King Philip, was taken,\r\nand Beare-haven, the last harbor in the South that was open to his\r\nships, effectually guarded by the English; and the Spanish preparations\r\nwere countermanded; and Red Hugh was once more on his journey to court\r\nto renew his almost hopeless suit, and had arrived at Samancas, two\r\nleagues from Valladolid, when he suddenly fell sick. His gallant heart\r\nwas broken and he died there on the 10th of September, 1602. He was\r\nburied by order of the king with royal honors, as befitted a prince of\r\nthe Kinel-Conal; and the stately city of Valladolid holds the bones of\r\nas noble a chief and as stout a warrior as ever bore the wand of\r\nchieftaincy or led a clan to battle.”\r\n\r\nWhile we do not believe in “painting the devil blacker than he is,” we\r\nthink it proper to state here that more recent researches would seem to\r\nhave fixed the crime of assassination on the Earl of Mountjoy. In an\r\naccount, quoted in several lectures by Frank Hugh O’Donnell, ex-member\r\nof the British Parliament, it is definitely stated that Red Hugh\r\nO’Donnell was poisoned at the inn in Samancas, where he died, by a hired\r\nmurderer, named Blake, who acted for the English Lord Deputy. Such, if\r\nthe statement is true, were the political ethics of the Elizabethan era.\r\n\r\nDonal O’Sullivan Beare, the bravest of all the Munster leaders, wrested\r\nhis castle of Dun-buidhe (Dunboy), in English, “Yellow Fort,” from the\r\nSpaniards after De Aguila had agreed to surrender it to the English. He\r\njustified his conduct to the King of Spain in a pathetic letter in which\r\nhe said: “Among other places that were neither yielded nor taken to the\r\nend that they might be delivered to the English, Don Juan tied himself\r\nup to deliver my castle and haven, the only key to mine inheritance,\r\nwhereupon the living of many thousand persons doth rest, that live some\r\ntwenty leagues upon the seacoast, into the hands of my cruel, cursed,\r\nmisbelieving enemies.”\r\n\r\nThe defence of this castle by the Irish garrison of one hundred and\r\nforty-three men, commanded by O’Sullivan’s intrepid lieutenant,\r\nMcGeoghegan, was one of the finest feats of arms recorded in history.\r\nAlthough only a square tower, with outworks, it held out against General\r\nCarew, the Lord President, for fifteen days. It was bombarded by the\r\nfleet from the haven, and battered by artillery from the land side.\r\nIndeed, Carew had an army of 4,000 veteran soldiers opposed to\r\nMcGeoghegan’s 143 heroes. A breach was finally effected in the castle,\r\nbut the storming parties were repeatedly repulsed. The great hall was\r\nfinally carried, and the little garrison, under the undaunted\r\nMcGeoghegan, retreated to the vaults beneath it, where they sustained\r\nthe unequal conflict for four-and-twenty hours, and, by the exertion of\r\nunexampled prowess, at last cleared the hall of the English. The latter\r\nreplied with an overwhelming cannonade, and the walls of the castle\r\ncrumbled about the ears of its heroic defenders. The latter made a\r\ndesperate sortie with only forty men and all perished. The survivors in\r\nthe castle continued the defence, but, in the end, their noble\r\ncommander, McGeoghegan, was mortally wounded and they laid down their\r\narms. While their wounded chief lay gasping in the agonies of\r\napproaching death, on the floor of the vault, he saw the English enter\r\nthe place. The sight seemed to renew his life and energy. He sprang to\r\nhis feet, seized a torch, and made a rush for an open barrel of powder,\r\nintending to blow assailants and assailed into the sky. But an English\r\nsoldier was too quick for the dying hero. He seized him in his arms, and\r\na comrade wrested the torch from the failing hand and extinguished it.\r\nThen they ran their swords through McGeoghegan’s body, and his glorious\r\ndeeds and great sufferings were at an end. It should have been stated\r\nthat ten of the garrison, who were of the party that made the sortie, on\r\nthe failure of their bold effort, attempted to reach the mainland by\r\nswimming across the haven. This movement was anticipated by the English\r\ncommander. Soldiers were stationed in boats to intercept the swimmers,\r\nand all were stabbed or shot, as if they had been beasts of prey. The\r\nsurvivors of the band of Irish Spartans, who made Dunboy forever\r\nmemorable in the annals of martial glory, were instantly hanged by order\r\nof Carew, so that not one of the heroic 143 was left. Ruthless as he\r\nwas, the Lord President himself, in an official letter, bore this\r\ntestimony to their valor: “Not one man escaped; all were slain,\r\nexecuted, or buried in the ruins, and so obstinate a defence hath not\r\nbeen seen within this kingdom.” The defence of Dunboy Castle deserves to\r\nrank in history with Thermopylæ and the Alamo of Texas, and the butchery\r\nof its surviving defenders, in cold blood, was a disgrace to English\r\nmanhood. How differently the gallant O’Neill treated the English\r\nprisoners taken at Armagh, Portmore, and other places in Ulster during\r\nthe period of his amazing victories. It is cruelties of this character\r\nthat made the English name abhorred in Ireland, not the prowess, or even\r\nthe bloodthirstiness, of the English soldiery in the heat of battle. The\r\nmassacre at Dunboy is an indelible stain on the memory of Lord President\r\nCarew.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n  Wane of Irish Resistance—O’Neill Surrenders to Mountjoy at Mellifont\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH the fall of Dunboy, Ireland’s heroic day was almost at an end for\r\nthat generation. O’Sullivan and some other Munster chiefs still held\r\nout, but their efforts were only desultory. O’Neill, accompanied by\r\nRichard Tyrrell, the faithful Anglo-Irish leader, rallied the remnants\r\nof his clan and attempted to hold again the line of the Blackwater. But\r\nthe English were now too many to be resisted by a handful of brave men.\r\nThey closed upon him from every side, and advanced their posts through\r\nthe country, so as to effectually cut him off from communication with\r\nTyrconnel, whose chief on hearing of the death of his noble brother, Red\r\nHugh, in Spain, made terms with the Lord Deputy. So, also, did many\r\nother Ulster chiefs, who conceived their cause to be hopeless. O’Neill,\r\nstill hoping against hope, and thinking that a Spanish army might yet\r\ncome to his aid, burned his castle of Dungannon to the ground, and\r\nretired to the wooded and mountainous portions of his ancient\r\nprincipality, where he held out doggedly. But the Lord Deputy resorted\r\nto his old policy of destroying the growing crops, and, very soon,\r\nTyrone, throughout its fairest and most fertile regions, was a blackened\r\nwaste. Still the Red Hand continued to float defiantly throughout the\r\nblack winter of 1602-3; but, at length, despair began to shadow the once\r\nbright hopes of the brave O’Neill. His daring ally, Donal O’Sullivan\r\nBeare, having lost all he possessed in Munster, set out at this\r\ninclement season on a forced march from Glengariff, in Cork, to Breffni,\r\nin Leitrim, fighting his enemies all the way, crossing the Shannon in\r\nboats extemporized from willows and horsehides; routing an English\r\nforce, under Colonel Malby, at the “pass of Aughrim,” in Galway,\r\ndestined to be more terribly memorable in another war for liberty; and,\r\nfinally, reached O’Ruarc’s castle, where he was hospitably welcomed,\r\nwith only a small moiety of those who followed him from their homes,\r\n\r\n                                  “—Marching\r\n              Over Murkerry’s moors and Ormond’s plain,\r\n            His currochs the waves of the Shannon o’erarching\r\n              And pathway mile-marked with the slain.”\r\n\r\nEven the iron heart of Hugh O’Neill could not maintain its strength\r\nagainst conditions such as those thus described by Moryson, the\r\nEnglishman, who can not be suspected of intensifying the horrid picture\r\nat the expense of his own country’s reputation: “No spectacle,” he says,\r\n“was more frequent in the ditches of towns, and especially of wasted\r\ncountries, than to see multitudes of poor people dead, with their mouths\r\nall colored green, by eating nettles, docks, and all things they could\r\nrend up above ground.” There were other spectacles still more terrible,\r\nas related by the English generals and chroniclers themselves, but we\r\nwill spare the details. They are too horrible for the average civilized\r\nbeing of this day to contemplate, although the age is by no means\r\nlacking in examples of human savagery which go to prove that the wild\r\nbeast in the nature of man has not yet been entirely bred out.\r\n\r\nBaffled by gold, not by steel, by the torch rather than the sword,\r\ndeprived of all his resources, deserted by his allies, and growing old\r\nand worn in ceaseless warfare, it can hardly be wondered at that O’Neill\r\nsent to the Lord Deputy, at the end of February, 1603, propositions of\r\nsurrender. Mountjoy was glad to receive them—for the vision of a\r\npossible Spanish expedition, in great force, still disquieted him—and\r\narranged to meet the discomfited Irish hero at Mellifont Abbey, in\r\nLouth, where died, centuries before, old, repentant, and despised, that\r\nfaithless wife of O’Ruarc, Prince of Breffni, whose sin first caused the\r\nNormans to set foot in Ireland. So anxious was Mountjoy to conclude a\r\npeace, that nearly all of O’Neill’s stipulations were concurred in, even\r\nto the free exercise of the Catholic religion in the subjugated country.\r\nHe and his allies were allowed to retain, under English “letters\r\npatent,” their original tribe-lands, with a few exceptions in favor of\r\nthe traitors who had fought with the English against their own kindred.\r\nIt was insisted, however, by the Deputy, that all Irish titles,\r\nincluding that of “The O’Neill,” should be dropped, thenceforth and\r\nforever, and the English titles of “nobility” substituted. All the Irish\r\nterritory was converted into “shire-ground.” The ancient Brehon Law was\r\nabolished, and, for evermore, the Irish clans were to be governed by\r\nEnglish methods. Queen Elizabeth had died during the progress of the\r\nnegotiations, and a secret knowledge of this fact no doubt influenced\r\nMountjoy in hurrying the treaty to its conclusion, and granting such,\r\ncomparatively, favorable conditions to Hugh O’Neill and the other\r\n“rebellious” Irish chiefs. Therefore, it was to the representative of\r\nKing James I that Tyrone, at last, yielded his sword—not to the general\r\nof Elizabeth. It is said that in the bitter last moments of that\r\nsovereign, her almost constant inquiry was: “What news from Ireland and\r\nthat rascally O’Neill?” The latter’s most elaborate historian estimates\r\nthat the long war “cost England many millions in treasure, and the blood\r\nof tens of thousands of her veteran soldiers, and, from the face of\r\nIreland, it swept nearly one-half of the entire population.” (Mitchel.)\r\nAnd, he continues: “From that day (March 30, 1603, when O’Neill\r\nsurrendered at Mellifont), the distinction of ‘Pale’ and ‘Irish country’\r\nwas at an end; and the authority of the kings of England and their\r\n(Anglo) Irish parliaments became, for the first time, paramount over the\r\nwhole island. The pride of ancient Erin—the haughty struggle of Irish\r\nnationhood against foreign institutions and the detested spirit of\r\nEnglish imperialism, for that time, sunk in blood and horror, but the\r\nIrish nation is an undying essence, and that noble struggle paused for a\r\nseason, only to recommence in other forms and on wider ground—to be\r\nrenewed, and again renewed, until—Ah! quousque, Domine, quousque?”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n   Treachery of James I to the Irish Chiefs—“The Flight of the Earls”\r\n\r\n\r\nAT the outset of his reign, James I, of England, and VI of Scotland,\r\ncollateral descendant of that Edward Bruce who had been crowned King of\r\nthe Irish in the beginning of the fourteenth century, promised to rule\r\nIreland in a loving and paternal spirit. He had received at his London\r\ncourt, with great urbanity, Hugh O’Neill and Roderick O’Donnell, and had\r\nconfirmed them in their English titles of Earl of Tyrone and Earl of\r\nTyrconnel, respectively. They had accompanied Mountjoy to England, to\r\nmake their “submissions” in due form before the king, and, while en\r\nroute through that country, were grossly insulted at many points by the\r\ncommon people, who could not forget their relatives lying dead in heaps\r\nin Irish soil, because of the prowess of the chieftains who were now the\r\nguests of England. It is most remarkable that the English people have\r\nalways honored and hospitably entertained the distinguished “rebels” of\r\nall countries but Ireland. Refugees from Poland, from Austria, from\r\nHungary, from France, from Italy—many of them charged with using\r\nassassin methods—have been warmly welcomed in London, and even protected\r\nby the courts of law, as in the case of the Orsini-infernal-machine\r\nconspirators against Napoleon III, in 1859; but no Irish “rebel” has\r\never been honored, or sheltered, or defended by the English people, or\r\nthe English courts of law; although individual Englishmen, like Lord\r\nByron, Percy Shelley, and a few others of their calibre, have written\r\nand spoken in assertion of Ireland’s right to a separate existence. Of\r\ncourse, the reason is that all the other “rebels” fought in “good\r\ncauses,” and, according to English political ethics, no cause can\r\npossibly be just in which the right of England to govern any people\r\nwhatever against their will is contested. America learned that bitter\r\nlesson nearly two centuries after O’Neill and O’Donnell were hooted and\r\nstoned by the English populace for having dared to defend the rights and\r\nthe patrimony of their people.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic religion continued to be tolerated by James until 1605,\r\nwhen, suddenly, a penal statute of the time of Elizabeth was unearthed\r\nand put into operation with full force. Treaty obligations of England\r\nwith the Irish chiefs were also systematically violated. The lands of\r\nUlster were broad and fair, and the great body of military adventurers\r\nwho had come into Ireland from England during the long wars of the\r\npreceding reign, were greedy for spoil. These and the Irish traitors—Art\r\nO’Neill, Niall Garbh O’Donnell, the false McGuire, and the rest—pestered\r\nthe government and made never-ending charges of plots and “treasons”\r\nagainst “the earls,” as the Irish leaders of the late war now came to be\r\ncalled. The plotters were ably assisted by Robert Cecil, Earl of\r\nSalisbury, ancestor of the late Marquis of Salisbury, who was also his\r\nnamesake. Another able English conspirator against the Irish chiefs was\r\nSir Arthur Chichester, who became one of the chief beneficiaries of the\r\nsubsequent “confiscations,” and whose descendants still hold, as “titled\r\nnobility,” a very comfortable slice of ancient Ulster. Some “Reformed”\r\nbishops also took great interest in getting the earls into hot water\r\nwith the government. Finally an alleged plot on the part of O’Neill and\r\nO’Donnell to overthrow the King of England’s government in Ulster—an\r\nabsurdity on its face, considering their fallen and helpless\r\ncondition—was made the pretext for summoning them to appear before the\r\nEnglish courts established in Ireland, in whose justice they had no\r\nconfidence, remembering the ghastly fate of MacMahon Roe. A hired\r\nperjurer, named O’Cahan—the unworthy scion of a noble house—was to be\r\nchief “witness” against O’Neill, and no secret was made of the fact that\r\nothers would be forthcoming, hired by Chichester, to finish the work\r\nbegun by the principal informer. Meanwhile the free exercise of the\r\nCatholic religion—so solemnly guaranteed by Mountjoy—was strictly\r\nprohibited, under the penal enactment of Elizabeth, known as the “Act of\r\nUniformity,” already referred to; and again began those horrid religious\r\npersecutions, for politics’ and plunder’s sake, which had no termination\r\nin Ireland, except for one brief period, during nearly two centuries.\r\nSuch Catholics as desired to practice their faith had to betake\r\nthemselves to the mountain recesses, or the caves of the seacoast,\r\nwhere, before rude altars, Mass was celebrated by priests on whose heads\r\na penal price was set. Sheriffs and judges, attended by large bands of\r\nsoldiers, made circuit of the new Ulster “counties” and succeeded in\r\ncompletely terrifying the unfortunate Catholic inhabitants. Education,\r\nas far as Catholics were concerned, was prohibited, and then began that\r\nexodus of Irish ecclesiastical students to the Continent of Europe,\r\nwhich continued down to the reign of William IV, notwithstanding the\r\npartial mitigation of the penal laws, in the reign of his father, and\r\nthe passage of the Catholic Emancipation Bill during his brother’s\r\nreign, A.D. 1829.\r\n\r\nThe persecuted earls clearly saw there was no hope of peace for them in\r\nIreland, and that their presence only wrought further ill to their\r\nfaithful clansmen, now reduced, for the first time, to the condition of\r\n“subjects” of the King of England. Lord Howth, a powerful Catholic noble\r\nof the Pale, was suspected of having given information to the Lord\r\nDeputy of a meeting held at Maynooth the previous Christmas at which the\r\nearls and several Anglo-Catholic noblemen were present. It was claimed\r\nthat the enforcement of the Act of Uniformity was there discussed, and\r\nthat another effort to overthrow the English power would be made by the\r\nparties to the meeting. This “plot,” if there were any at all, was\r\ncommunicated to the Clerk of the Privy Council by an anonymous letter\r\ndropped at the Castle of Dublin in March, 1607. “O’Neill,” says McGee,\r\n“was with Chichester, at Slane, in September when he received a letter\r\nfrom the McGuire—not the traitor of that title—who had been abroad,\r\nconveying some startling information upon which Tyrone seems to have\r\nacted at once. He took leave of the Lord Deputy, as if to prepare for a\r\njourney to London, whither he had been summoned on some false pretext;\r\nand, after spending a few days with his old friend, Sir Garrett Moore,\r\nat Mellifont, repaired to his seat of Dungannon, where he, at once,\r\nassembled all of his immediate family and all proceeded to the shores of\r\nLough Swilly, at Rathmullen, where they were joined by Roderick\r\nO’Donnell and all of his household. They embarked immediately on the\r\nFrench ship which had conveyed McGuire to Ireland, and set sail for\r\nFrance, where, on landing, they were warmly welcomed and royally\r\nentertained by the chivalric King Henry IV, who, as became a stout\r\nsoldier and able captain, greatly admired the prowess displayed in the\r\nUlster wars by Hugh O’Neill. There sailed to France with the latter his\r\nlast countess, daughter of McGenniss of Iveagh; his three sons, Hugh,\r\nJohn, and Brian; his nephew, Art O’Neill, son of Cormac, and many of\r\nlesser note. With O’Donnell sailed his brother Cathbar; his fair sister,\r\nNuala, wife of Niall Garbh, who had, in righteous indignation, forsaken\r\nthe traitor when he drew the sword against Ireland and her noble\r\nbrother, Red Hugh; the lady Rose O’Doherty, wife of Cathbar, and, after\r\nhis death, of Owen O’Neill; McGuire, Owen MacWard, the chief bard of\r\nTyrconnel, and several others. It proved to be a fatal voyage, for it\r\nexiled forever the best and bravest of the Irish chiefs. Well might the\r\nFour Masters in their Annals of the succeeding generation say: “Woe to\r\nthe heart that meditated, woe to the mind that conceived, woe to the\r\ncouncil that decided on the project of voyage, without knowing whether\r\nthey should to the end of their lives be able to return to their ancient\r\nprincipalities and patrimonies.” And, adds the graphic Mitchel, “with\r\ngloomy looks and sad forebodings, the clansmen of Tyrconnel gazed upon\r\nthat fatal ship, ‘built in the eclipse and rigged with curses dark,’ as\r\nshe dropped down Lough Swilly, and was hidden behind the cliffs of Fanad\r\nHead. They never saw their chieftains more.”\r\n\r\nEverything was now settled in Ulster, for the English interest, except\r\nfor the brief “rebellion” of Sir Cahir O’Doherty, the young chief of\r\nInishowen, who fell out with Sir George Powlett of Derry, and flew at\r\nonce to arms. He made a brave struggle of some months’ duration, but, as\r\nno aid reached him from any outside quarter, he was speedily penned up\r\nin his own small territory, and, fighting to the last, died the death of\r\na soldier—the noblest death he could have died, surrounded by the armies\r\nof Marshal Wingfield and Sir Oliver Lambert, on the rock of Doon, near\r\nKilmacrenan, in August, 1608. Thus went out the last spark of Ulster\r\nvalor for a generation.\r\n\r\nKing James, having used Niall Garbh O’Donnell for all he was worth to\r\nthe English cause, grew tired of his importunities and had him conveyed\r\nto England, under guard, together with his two sons. All three were\r\nimprisoned in the Tower of London from which the traitor, at least,\r\nnever emerged again. He met a fate he richly merited. Cormac O’Neill,\r\nthe brave captor of Armagh, and the legitimate O’Cahan, both of whom had\r\nincurred the hatred of Chichester, also perished in the same gloomy\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nAnd now all that remained to be done was to parcel out the lands of the\r\nconquered Ultonians and others of “the Meer Irish” between the captains\r\nof the new conquest. Chichester was given the whole of O’Doherty’s\r\ncountry, the peninsula of Inishowen, and to this was added O’Neill’s\r\nformer borough of Dungannon, with 1,300 acres of valuable land in the\r\nneighborhood of the town. Wingfield was created Lord Powerscourt and\r\nobtained the beautiful district of Fercullen, near Dublin—one of the\r\nmost charming domains in all Europe. Lambert became Earl of Cavan and\r\nhad several rich estates, including that of Carrig, bestowed upon him in\r\naddition. All the counties of Ulster were declared forfeited to the\r\nCrown of England. The primate and other Protestant prelates of Ulster\r\nclaimed, and received, 43,000 acres. Trinity College, Dublin, received\r\n30,000 acres, in Tyrone, Derry, and Armagh, together with six advowsons,\r\nor Church beneficies, in each county. The various guilds, or trades, of\r\nthe city of London, England, obtained the gross amount of 209,800 acres,\r\nincluding the city of Derry, to which the name of “London” was then\r\nprefixed. Grants to individuals were divided into three classes of\r\n2,000, 1,500, and 1,000 acres each. Catholic laborers were required to\r\ntake the oath of supremacy—acknowledging King James as spiritual head of\r\nthe Church—which they, notwithstanding all their misfortunes, nobly\r\nrefused to do. In the end, seeing that the fields would remain\r\nuncultivated for the most part, the English and Scotch “undertakers,” or\r\nsettlers, for prudence’ sake, rather than from liberal motives,\r\npractically made this tyrannical requirement a dead letter. But the\r\nCatholic tillers of the soil were driven from the fertile plains and\r\nforced to cultivate miserable patches of land in the bogs or on the\r\nmountains. When these became in any degree valuable, an exorbitant\r\n“rent” was charged, and the poor Catholics, utterly unable to pay it,\r\nwere again compelled to move to some even more unpromising location,\r\nwhere the same procedure again and again produced the same wretched\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that the ancient Irish clans, and families, were actually\r\nrobbed, in spite of solemn treaties and royal pledges, of their rightful\r\ninheritance, and that strangers and “soulless corporations” became lords\r\nof their soil. It was the beginning, in Ulster at least, of that system\r\nof “felonious landlordism” which is the curse of all Ireland, in spite\r\nof recent remedial measures, even in this day. So, too, began that\r\nEnglish garrison in Ireland—pitting race against race and creed against\r\ncreed—which has divided, distracted, and demoralized the Irish nation\r\never since. The “Plantation of Ulster” was the most fatal measure ever\r\ncarried into effect by English policy in Ireland. Some of the Irish\r\nprinces did not long survive their exile. From France they had proceeded\r\nto Rome and were very kindly received by the Pontiff, who placed\r\nresidences commensurate with their rank and fame at their disposal.\r\nRoderick O’Donnell died in the Eternal City in July, 1608. McGuire died\r\nat Genoa, while en route to Spain in August, and, in September, Cathbar\r\nO’Donnell also passed away, and was laid in the same grave with his\r\ngallant brother, on St. Peter’s Hill. (McGee.) O’Neill’s fate was sadder\r\nstill. The historian just quoted says of him: “He survived his comrades\r\nas he did his fortunes, and, like another Belisarius, blind and old, and\r\na pensioner on the bounty of strangers, he lived on eight weary years in\r\nRome.” Death came to his relief, according to a historian of his own\r\nperiod, in 1616, when he must have been over seventy years of age. He\r\nsleeps his last sleep amid the consecrated dust of ages, beneath the\r\nflagstones of the convent of St. Isidore; and there, in the words of the\r\nIrish orator and American general, Meagher, “the fiery hand that rent\r\nthe ensign of St. George on the plains of Ulster has mouldered into\r\ndust.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK III\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORDING THE DOINGS OF THE ENGLISH AND IRISH, IN IRELAND, FROM THE TIME\r\nOF JAMES I TO THE JACOBITE WARS IN THE DAYS OF JAMES II AND WILLIAM III\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n      Confiscations and Penal Laws—The Iron Rule of Lord Strafford\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE first Anglo-Irish Parliament held within a period of twenty-seven\r\nyears was summoned to meet in Dublin on May 18, 1613, and,\r\nnotwithstanding the Act of Uniformity, it would appear that quite a\r\nlarge number of Catholics, styled in the language of the times\r\n“recusants,” because of their opposition to the spiritual supremacy of\r\nthe king, were elected to serve in that body. They would have had a\r\nmajority but for the creation of some forty “boroughs,” each entitled to\r\na member, under the patronage of some Protestant peer. This was the\r\nbeginning of that “rotten borough” system which finally led to the\r\nabolition of the sectarian Irish Parliament of after times. Scenes of\r\ngreat disorder occurred in this Parliament of 1613, chiefly occasioned\r\nby the intolerant, and even violent, proceedings of the anti-Catholic\r\nparty, unreasonable bigots, having an eye to the main chance in the\r\nmatter of confiscated property, to whom the presence of any “Papist” in\r\nthat body was as gall and wormwood. This bitter prejudice led finally to\r\nthe utter exclusion of all Catholics from the Anglo-Irish Parliament,\r\nand even the few Catholic commoners previously entitled to a vote were\r\ndeprived of that privilege, or rather right, until the last decade of\r\nthe eighteenth century. Still, the Catholic minority in the Parliament\r\nof 1613 succeeded in preventing ultra-tyrannical legislation, and,\r\nreally, made the first stand for the constitutional rights of Ireland,\r\nfrom the colonial standpoint. It was finally adjourned in October, 1615,\r\nand no other Parliament was called to meet in Ireland until 1635, when\r\nCharles I had already been ten years on the throne. “Government,”\r\nmeanwhile, had been carried on arbitrarily, without constitutional\r\nrestraint of any kind, as under the Tudor sovereigns—only with far less\r\nability. The Tudors, at least—particularly Henry and Elizabeth—were\r\nintellectual tyrants, which their immediate successors were not. Never\r\nwas so shameful a system of public spoliation carried out as in the\r\nreigns of James I, and his equally despotic, and still more\r\nunscrupulous, son Charles I. The viceroy was not responsible to any\r\npower whatever, except that of the English monarch. Chichester was\r\nsucceeded by Lord Grandison, and under his régime the infamous\r\n“Commission for the Discovery of Defective Titles” was organized, of\r\nwhich the surveyor-general, Sir William Parsons, ancestor of the Earls\r\nof Rosse, was the head. This Commission, “aided by a horde of clerkly\r\nspies, employed under the name of Discoverers (McGee), ransacked Old\r\nIrish tenures in the archives of Dublin and London with such good\r\neffect, that in a very short time 66,000 acres in Wicklow and 385,000\r\nacres in Leitrim, Longford, the Meaths, and Kings and Queens Counties\r\nwere ‘found by inquisition to be vested in the crown.’ The means\r\nemployed by the Commissioners in some cases to elicit such evidence as\r\nthey required were of the most revolting description. In the Wicklow\r\ncase, courts-martial were held, before which unwilling witnesses were\r\ntried on charge of treason, and some actually put to death. Archer, one\r\nof the number, had his flesh burned with red-hot iron, and was placed on\r\na gridiron over a charcoal fire till he offered to testify anything that\r\nwas necessary. Yet on evidence so obtained, whole counties and towns\r\nwere declared forfeited to the crown.” (_Ibid._) Is it any wonder,\r\ntherefore, that a people so scourged, plundered, and degraded should\r\ncherish in their hearts fierce thoughts of reprisal when opportunity\r\noffered? These wholesale land robberies were not confined to the Celtic\r\nIrish alone, but were practiced on all Irishmen, of whatever descent,\r\nwho professed the Catholic faith. Add to these the bitter memories of\r\nthe murder and persecution of many bishops and innumerable priests and\r\ncommunicants of that faith, and the only wonder is that the Irish\r\nCatholic people of the seventeenth, and most of the succeeding, century,\r\nretained any of the milder and nobler characteristics of the human\r\nfamily. They were stripped of their property, education, civil rights,\r\nand, in short, of all that makes life worth living, including freedom of\r\nconscience—that dearest privilege of a people naturally idealistic and\r\ndevotional. The idea of religious toleration never seems to have entered\r\ninto the minds of what may be called the “professional Protestant”\r\nascendency, except, as we have seen, for purposes of diplomacy which\r\ntended to weaken and divide Irish national opposition to foreign rule.\r\nIn addition to the grievances we have enumerated, the office of Master\r\nof Wards was bestowed upon Sir William Parsons, and thus “the minor\r\nheirs of all the Catholic proprietors were placed, both as to, person\r\nand property, at the absolute disposal of one of the most intense\r\nanti-Catholic bigots that ever appeared on the scene of Irish affairs.”\r\n(McGee.) This was one of the pernicious influences that, not for\r\nconscience’ sake, but for sordid gain, changed the religion of so many\r\nof the ancient families of Ireland from the old to the new form of\r\nbelief; and no English policy was more bitterly resented and vengefully\r\nremembered by the Irish Catholic masses. And because of this dishonest\r\nsystem of proselytizing, carried on by one process or another from the\r\nperiod of the Reformation to the reign of Victoria, the Irish Catholic\r\npeasant has associated “conversion” of any of his neighbors to the\r\nProtestant belief with personal degradation. The Irish Catholic peasant\r\nhas no feeling but that of utter contempt and aversion for a “turn-coat”\r\nCatholic; but he is most liberal in his feelings toward all Protestants\r\n“to the manor born,” as has been frequently and emphatically manifested\r\nby his choice of Protestant leaders, from Grattan to Parnell. Whatever\r\nof religious bigotry may linger in the warm heart of the Catholic\r\npeasant may be justly charged to outrageous misgovernment, not to his\r\nnatural disposition, which, in the main, is both loving and charitable.\r\nThe faults we can trace in the Irish character to-day are partially\r\nthose of human nature, which averages much the same in all civilized\r\npeoples, but many of them, and the gravest, can be attributed, without\r\nundue prejudice, to the odious penal laws which were sufficient to\r\ndistort the characteristics of angels, not to speak of mortal men.\r\n\r\nCharles I, of England, was a thorough Stuart in despotic character,\r\nwavering policy, base ingratitude, and fatuous obstinacy. His reign was\r\nto furnish to Ireland one of the most consummate tyrants and highway\r\nrobbers that ever cursed a country with his cruelty and greed. This\r\nmoral monster was the infamous Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford,\r\nwhose “tiger jaws” closed on the unfortunate country with the grip of a\r\ndragon. This dishonorable “noble” counseled King Charles to commit an\r\nact of moral delinquency which, in our day, would be rightly, if\r\ncoarsely, called “a confidence game.” The Irish Catholics, in convention\r\nassembled, had drawn up a sort of Bill of Rights, which they urged the\r\nking to confirm, and agreed to pay into the royal treasury the sum of\r\n£100,000, which they could ill spare, to show their “loyalty,” and also,\r\nno doubt, to influence Charles, who, like all of his family, dearly\r\nloved money, to grant “the graces” prayed for. Strafford advised the\r\nbase king to take the money, but to manage matters so that the\r\nconcessions he had solemnly promised should never go into effect! And\r\nthe ignominious Stuart actually acted on the advice of this ignoble\r\nmentor. And so the poor Irish Catholic “gentry” lost both their money\r\nand their “concessions.” When we read this chapter of Irish history, we\r\nare tempted to feel less sympathy for the fate of Charles I, who was\r\nafterward sold to Cromwell and the English Parliament by the Scottish\r\nmercenary army of General Leslie, with which the king had taken shelter,\r\nfor back pay, amounting to £200,000 (see Sir Walter Scott’s “Tales of a\r\nGrandfather”). This miserable monarch so far degraded himself, further,\r\nas to cause writs for the election of a Parliament to grant the Catholic\r\nclaims issued in Ireland, but privately instructed Lord Falkland to have\r\nthe documents informally prepared, so that the election might prove\r\ninvalid; and, meanwhile, his Lords Justices went on confiscating\r\nCatholic property in Ireland and persecuting prelates, priests, and\r\npeople almost as savagely as in the worst days of Mountjoy and\r\nChichester. Strafford came to Ireland as Lord Deputy in July, 1633, and\r\nentered at once on his “thorough” policy, as he called it; and, to\r\nprepare himself for the task he had set himself to perform, he through\r\nthe “Lords Justices” extracted a “voluntary contribution” of £20,000\r\nadditional out of the terrorized Catholic “nobility and gentry” of the\r\n“sister” island, who, no doubt, wrung it, in turn, out of the sweat of\r\nthe faces of their peasant retainers. But this was a mere bagatelle to\r\nwhat followed. He compelled Ireland to pay subsidies to the amount of\r\n£200,000 in 1634, and imposed £100,000 more in the succeeding year. He\r\ncarried the war of wholesale confiscation into Connaught, and compelled\r\ngrand juries, specially “packed” for the work, to give the King of\r\nEngland title to the three great counties of Mayo, Sligo, and Roscommon.\r\nThe grand jury of Galway County refused to return such a verdict. They\r\nwere summoned to the court of the Castle Chamber in Dublin, and\r\nsentenced to pay a fine of £4,000 each to the crown. The sheriff who\r\nempaneled them was fined £1,000. (McGee.) The very lawyers who pleaded\r\nfor the actual proprietors were stripped of their gowns; “the sheriff\r\ndied in prison and the work of spoliation proceeded.” (_Ibid._) Similar,\r\nif not quite so general, robberies went on in Kildare, Kilkenny, Cork,\r\nand other counties. It must be said, however, that Strafford was, in a\r\nmanner, impartial, and robbed, his master granting full approval,\r\nwithout distinction of creed. We can not help feeling thankful that the\r\nLondon companies which swallowed, in the reign of King James, the lands\r\nof Tyrone and Tyrconnel, were compelled by “Black Tom,” as the earl was\r\nnicknamed, to pay £70,000 “for the use of the king.” Out of all this\r\nplunder, and much more beside, Strafford was enabled to maintain in\r\nIreland 10,000 infantry and 1,000 excellently equipped horse, “for the\r\nservice of his royal master.” When this great robber visited London in\r\n1639, fresh from his crimes in Ireland, the king, on whom so much\r\nill-deserved sympathy has been wasted, assured him, in person, that his\r\nactions in Ireland had his (Charles’) “most cordial approval” (McGee),\r\nand even urged the earl to “proceed fearlessly in the same course.” To\r\nstill further mark his approbation of Strafford’s policy, the king\r\npromoted him to the rank of Viceroy of Ireland. Strafford took the king\r\nat his word and did proceed so fearlessly in Ireland that his name of\r\nterror has been overshadowed in that country by only one other—that of\r\nOliver Cromwell. Every Parliament called to meet by the tyrant in the\r\nconquered country—for so the earl regarded Ireland—was used simply as an\r\ninstrument wherewith to extort still more tribute from the impoverished\r\nIrish people. This terrible despot, having accomplished his deadly\r\nmission in Ireland, returned to England and there, as before, became\r\nchief adviser to the weak and wicked monarch. He counseled the latter to\r\nignore, as far as he dared, the action of Parliament, and was imprudent\r\nenough to remark that he (Strafford) had an army in Ireland to support\r\nthe royal will. He was, soon afterward, impeached by the House of\r\nCommons, led by stern John Pym, for treasonable acts in seeking to\r\nchange the constitutional form of the English Government. This method of\r\nprocedure was abandoned, however, and Parliament passed a bill of\r\nattainder, to which the “false, fleeting, perjured” Charles, frightened\r\nby popular clamor, which accused himself of being implicated in a plot\r\nto admit soldiers to the Tower for the rescue of Strafford, gave the\r\n“royal assent.” The earl, on learning this, placed a hand upon his heart\r\nand exclaimed, “Put not your trust in Princes!” And thus the master he\r\nhad but too faithfully served consigned Strafford to the block. He was\r\nbeheaded on Tower Hill, May 12, 1641. When the hour of his similar doom\r\napproached, nearly eight years thereafter, Charles said that the only\r\nact of his reign he repented of was giving his assent to the bill which\r\ndeprived his favorite minister of life.\r\n\r\nSome Irish historians, McGee of the number, claim that, outside of his\r\nland robberies and tributary exactions, the Earl of Strafford made an\r\nable ruler of Ireland, and that trade and commerce flourished under his\r\nsway. While this may be, to a certain extent, true, nothing can palliate\r\nthe crimes against justice and liberty of which he was guilty. He was\r\nonly a degree less contemptible than the treacherous master who finally\r\nbetrayed and abandoned him.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n    Irish Military Exiles—Rory O’More Organizes a Great Insurrection\r\n\r\n\r\nSINCE Sir Cahir O’Doherty fell on the rock of Doon, in 1608, no Irish\r\nchief or clan had risen against the English interest throughout the\r\nlength and breadth of the island. The masses of the Irish people had,\r\napparently, sunk into a condition of political torpor, but the fires of\r\nformer generations still smouldered amid the ashes of vanquished hopes,\r\nand needed but a breath of inspiration to fan them into fierce,\r\nrebellious flame. Most of the ancient Celtic and many of the\r\nAnglo-Norman families of Catholic persuasion had military\r\nrepresentatives in nearly all the camps of Europe. One Irish legion\r\nserved in the army of Philip III of Spain, and was commanded\r\nsuccessively by two of the sons of Hugh O’Neill, victor of the Yellow\r\nFord—Henry and John. In it also served the hero’s gallant nephew, Owen\r\nRoe O’Neill, who rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and made a\r\nbrilliant defence of Arras in France, besieged by Marshal de Meilleraye,\r\nin 1640. Of this able soldier we shall hear more in the future. The\r\nEnglish Government never lost sight of those Irish exiles, and, about\r\nthis time, one of its emissaries on the Continent reported that there\r\nwere in the Spanish Netherlands alone “twenty Irish officers fit to be\r\ncolonels and a hundred fit to be captains.” The same agent reported,\r\nfurther, that the Irish military throughout Europe had long been\r\nprocuring arms for an attempt upon Ireland, and had 6,000 stand laid up\r\nin Antwerp for that design, and that these had been bought out of the\r\ndeduction of their “monthly pay.” At the defence of Louvain against the\r\nFrench, the Irish legion, 1,000 strong, commanded by Colonel Preston, of\r\na distinguished Anglo-Irish family, received honorable mention, and\r\nagain at the capture of Breda. These are only a few of the stirring\r\nevents abroad which raised the martial reputation of the Irish people in\r\nthe eyes of all Europe, and the fame of those exploits, reaching Ireland\r\nby means of adventurous recruiting officers or courageous priests, who\r\ndefied the penal laws and all their terrors, found a responsive echo in\r\nmany a humble home, where the hope of one day throwing off the foreign\r\nyoke was fondly cherished. The exiled priesthood, many of whose members\r\nbecame prelates of high rank abroad, aided the sentiment of the military\r\nat the Catholic courts, and thus was prepared the way for the breaking\r\nout of the great insurrection of 1641, which, but for the foolish\r\nover-confidence of an Irish chief and the dastardly treason of an\r\nobscure drunkard, might have been gloriously successful.\r\n\r\nThe moving spirit in the new project was Roger, or Rory O’More, of the\r\nancient family of Leix, who had been educated in Spain and was,\r\nvirtually, brought up at the Spanish court, in company with the sons of\r\nHugh O’Neill, of Tyrone. O’More would seem to have been a born\r\norganizer, and a man of consummate tact and discretion. It is a pity\r\nthat but little is known of his early career, and, indeed, the precise\r\ntime of his return to Ireland remains an unsettled question, but it is\r\ncertain that he returned quietly there, and took up his residence,\r\nwithout parade, on his estate of Ballynagh in Leinster. He never\r\nappeared in Dublin, or any other populous centre, unless on some public\r\noccasion, that would be sure to attract the attendance of the principal\r\nmen of the country. Thus, during the Parliamentary session of 1640, we\r\nare told by McGee and other Irish annalists, he took lodgings in Dublin,\r\nand succeeded in drawing into his plan for a general insurrection,\r\nConnor McGuire, MacMahon, Philip O’Reilly, Turlough O’Neill, and other\r\nprominent gentlemen of Ulster. He made a habit, also, of visiting the\r\ndifferent towns in which courts of assize were being held, and there\r\nbecoming acquainted with influential men, to whom, after due sounding,\r\nhe outlined his plans for the final overthrow of the English government\r\nin Ireland, and the restoration to the Irish people of the lands and\r\nrights of which they had been robbed. On one of these tours, we are\r\ntold, he made the acquaintance of Sir Phelim O’Neill, of Kinnaird, in\r\nTyrone—head of the branch of that great family still tolerated by the\r\nascendency Sir Connor MCGennis of Down, Colonel Hugh MacMahon of\r\nMonaghan, and the Right Rev. Heber MacMahon, Administrator of Clogher,\r\nby connivance or toleration, for, during the penal laws, there was no\r\n“legal” recognition of a Catholic prelacy, although, under Charles I,\r\nespecially about this period, there was no very rigid enforcement of the\r\nAct of Uniformity, probably because the king and government had enough\r\ntrouble on their hands in vainly trying to force Protestant episcopacy\r\non the Scotch covenanters.\r\n\r\nO’More did not confine his operations exclusively to Ulster. He also\r\nmade a tour of Connaught, with his usual success; for he was a man of\r\nfine person, handsome countenance, and courtly manners. Tradition still\r\npreserves his memory green among the Irish people of all classes. He was\r\nequally courteous to the lord and to the peasant. In the castles and\r\nmansions of the aristocracy he was ever the favored guest, and he\r\ncharmed all his entertainers with the brilliancy of his conversational\r\npowers and the versatility of his knowledge. Among the poor, he was\r\nlooked upon as “some glorious guardian angel,” who had come as a\r\nmessenger from the God of Freedom to rid them of their galling chains.\r\nIt is a singular fact that, although he must have taken thousands, high\r\nand low, into his confidence, not a man seems to have betrayed him to\r\nthe Castle Government, which remained in profound ignorance of his plot\r\nuntil the very eve of insurrection. Robert Emmet, in after times,\r\npracticed the methods of O’More, but with far less wisdom, although\r\ninfluenced by the same lofty principles of patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe records of the times in which he lived do not show that O’More went\r\nextensively into Munster, but he did excellent missionary work among the\r\nAnglo-Catholic nobles of his own native province of Leinster. He found\r\nthem, as a majority, very lukewarm toward his project, influenced, no\r\ndoubt, by fears of the consequences to themselves should the\r\ncontemplated revolution prove abortive. Although not a trained soldier,\r\nO’More had keen military foresight. The army raised by Strafford in\r\nIreland was mainly made up of Catholics—for he does not seem to have\r\ndiscriminated very much in the matter of creed—and these troops were, in\r\nconsequence, regarded with distrust, and even intense hatred, by the\r\npeople of England, to whom the very name of Catholic was, in those days,\r\nodious. The vacillating king, influenced by the prejudices of his\r\nEnglish subjects, resolved to get rid of his Irish army, and gave such\r\nof the regiments as might so elect permission to enter the service of\r\nSpain. Some did volunteer, but O’More prevailed on many of the officers\r\nto keep their battalions together, and thus secured the nucleus of a\r\nwell-trained military force at the very outset of hostilities. Among the\r\ninfluential Irish officers who acted on O’More’s suggestion were Colonel\r\nPlunket, Colonel Sir James Dillon, Colonel Byrne, and Captain Fox.\r\nThese, with O’More, constituted the first Directory of the Irish\r\nConfederates of Leinster. Meanwhile active communication was kept up\r\nwith their friends on the Continent, and emissaries were coming and\r\ngoing all the time between the two organizations. The head of the\r\nmovement abroad appears to have been John O’Neill, Earl of Tyrone, who,\r\nhowever, died suddenly—some writers aver by the hand of a poisoner—early\r\nin 1641; and the military exiles immediately transferred their\r\nallegiance to his cousin, Colonel Owen Roe O’Neill, with whom we have\r\nalready made acquaintance. It was agreed among the allies that the\r\nuprising for Irish liberty should occur about the 1st of November, and\r\nOctober 23, 1641, was finally decided upon as the fateful day. The date\r\nwas made known to only the most trusted chiefs of the projected\r\ninsurrection.\r\n\r\nEverything appeared to prosper with the plans of the patriots until the\r\nactual eve of the rising. On that night (October 22), as fate would have\r\nit, there dined with Colonel Hugh MacMahon—to whom was intrusted the\r\ncommand of 200 picked men who were to surprise the Castle—several Irish\r\nofficers concerned in the conspiracy. Among the guests was one Owen\r\nO’Connolly, an unworthy creature for whom MacMahon would appear to have\r\nentertained an unaccountable friendship. According to tradition,\r\nO’Connolly remained with Colonel MacMahon after the other guests had\r\ngone to their several abodes, and, in a moment of inexcusable weakness,\r\nthe unhappy host, who must have been rendered reckless by wine, confided\r\nto his traitor-guest the secret so momentous to Ireland. O’Connolly was\r\nmore than half intoxicated, but, unknown to MacMahon, he was in the\r\nservice of a strong government supporter, named Sir John Clotworthy, and\r\nthe danger which menaced his patron made the fellow sober enough to\r\noutwit his foolish informant. In order to divert suspicion, he\r\npretended, after a time, that he wished to retire, and left his sword in\r\nMacMahon’s room. He managed to reach the rear door of the lodgings, and\r\nmade his way over all kinds of obstacles, in the dark, to the castle,\r\nwhere, after much trouble, he succeeded in getting audience of Sir\r\nWilliam Parsons, to whom he related what Colonel MacMahon had revealed\r\nto him. Parsons, observing that O’Connolly was still under the influence\r\nof strong drink, at first refused to believe him; and was on the point\r\nof turning him out of doors, when something in the rascal’s earnestness\r\nmade him pause and consider. As a result of his musing, he sent for his\r\ncolleague, Sir John Borlaise, Master of the Ordnance; the latter\r\nimmediately advised the summoning of the council. Several members of\r\nthat body soon appeared, and the deposition of the informer was formally\r\ntaken. A squad of soldiers surrounded MacMahon’s lodgings and captured\r\nhim. Lord McGuire was also taken, but Colonels Plunket and O’Byrne, Rory\r\nO’Moore, and Captain Fox, who were also in the city, succeeded in making\r\ngood their escape. MacMahon, on being arraigned before the Privy Council\r\nin the Castle, at daylight on the memorable 23d, defiantly acknowledged\r\nhis share in the plot, and declared that it was then too late for the\r\npower of man to prevent the revolution. He showed great courage, as did\r\nalso his colleague, Lord McGuire, but MacMahon’s bravery could have been\r\nmuch better spared than his discretion, the want of which sent himself\r\nand his companion in misfortune to the scaffold, and, undoubtedly, lost\r\nto Ireland the best chance she had ever had of severing the connection\r\nwith Great Britain. This unhappy result teaches a harsh, but useful,\r\npolitical lesson: Never to confide a secret that concerns a great cause\r\nto a dubious “hanger-on,” and to avoid the cup that inebriates when one\r\nis the possessor of such a secret, or whether one is or not.\r\nO’Connolly’s treachery was rewarded by a grant of lands from “the\r\ncrown,” and he was afterward a colonel in Cromwell’s army. His ultimate\r\nfate is involved in obscurity. But his name is embalmed in the annals of\r\nenduring infamy.\r\n\r\nThe Lords Justices of England, in Dublin, once made aware of the\r\nsituation, lost no time in putting the Castle and city at large in a\r\nposture of defence. The guards were doubled and reinforcements were\r\nsummoned, by special messengers, from neighboring garrisons. Two tried\r\nsoldiers were invested with the military power—Sir John Willoughby, who\r\nhad been Governor of Galway, assumed command of the Castle; and Sir\r\nCharles Coote—one of the blackest names in Irish annals—was made\r\nmilitary governor of the city. The Earl of Ormond—afterward Duke—was\r\nsummoned from Carrick-on-Suir to assume chief command of the royal army.\r\nThus, the Irish capital was again preserved, through folly and treason,\r\nto the English interest.\r\n\r\nMacMahon made no vain boast before the Privy Council, when he declared\r\nthat the rising was beyond the power of man to prevent. Ulster did its\r\nfull duty, and, on the morning of October 23, the forts of Mountjoy and\r\nCharlemont and the town and castle of Dungannon were in the hands of Sir\r\nPhelim O’Neill or his chief officers. Sir Connor MacGennis captured\r\nNewry; the MacMahons took Carrickmacross and Castleblaney, the\r\nO’Hanlon’s, Tandragee, while O’Reilly and McGuire—a relative of the lord\r\nof that name—“raised” Cavan and Femanagh. (McGee.) Rory O’More\r\nsupplemented a brief address of the northern chiefs, wherein they\r\ndeclared they bore no hostility to the king, or to his English or Scotch\r\nsubjects, “but only for the defence and liberty of themselves and the\r\nnative Irish of the kingdom,” with one more elaborate, in which he ably\r\nshowed that a common danger threatened the Protestants of the Episcopal\r\nChurch with Roman Catholics. In all the manifestos of the time, there\r\nwas entirely too much profession of “loyalty” to a king who was\r\nconstitutionally incapacitated for keeping faith with any body of men\r\nwhatsoever. Never was the adage that “Politics makes strange bedfellows”\r\nmore forcibly illustrated than during this period of Irish history. The\r\nmanliest of all the declarations issued was that of Sir Connor\r\nMacGennis, from “Newry’s captured towers.” “We are in arms,” wrote he,\r\n“for our lives and liberties. We desire no blood to be shed, but if you\r\n(the English and their allies) mean to shed our blood, be sure we shall\r\nbe as ready as you for that purpose.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n Horrors of Civil War in Ulster—Battle of Kilrush—Rory O’More Disappears\r\n                               from History\r\n\r\n\r\nAT first the civil war in Ulster—for in the main it was the Old Irish\r\nagainst the Anglo-Irish settlers of the Elizabethan régime, or their\r\nimmediate descendants—was carried on without ferocity, but the Scottish\r\ngarrison of Carrickfergus, in the winter of 1641, raided Island Magee,\r\nin the neighborhood, and put to the sword or drove over the cliffs, to\r\nperish in the breakers beneath them, or be dashed to pieces on the\r\nrocks, 3,000 of the Celtic-Catholic inhabitants, without regard to age\r\nor sex. Protestant historians claim that acts of cruelty had been\r\ncommitted on the Anglo-Irish settlers by the Celtic Irish before this\r\nterrible massacre was accomplished. There may have been some isolated\r\ncases of murder and rapine—for bad and cruel men are to be found in all\r\narmies—but nothing that called for the wholesale slaughter at Island\r\nMagee by fanatical Scottish Covenanters, who made up a majority of the\r\nCarrickfergus garrison. Christians, not to mention Mohammedans and\r\nsavage heathens, have shed oceans of blood in fierce persecution of each\r\nother, as if they were serving a furious devil, rather than a merciful\r\nGod. They forget, in their unreasoning hatred, that the gentle Messiah,\r\nwhose teachings they profess to follow, never made the sword the ally of\r\nthe Cross. The man made mad by religious bigotry is a wild beast, no\r\nmatter what creed he may profess. Let us, as Americans, be thankful that\r\nwe live under a government which recognizes the equal rights of all the\r\ncreeds, and permits every citizen to worship God in peace, after his own\r\nfashion. May the day never come when it shall be different in this\r\nRepublic!\r\n\r\nThe frightful event we have chronicled naturally aroused the worst\r\npassions of the angered Catholic population of Ulster, and some cruel\r\nreprisals resulted. We are sorry to be obliged to state that credible\r\nhistory ascribes most of the violence committed on the Irish side to Sir\r\nPhelim O’Neill; but no charge of the kind is made against O’More,\r\nMacGennis, McGuire, Plunket, O’Byrne, or any of the other noted chiefs\r\nof the period. It is impossible to arrive at any accurate statement of\r\nthe number of those who perished on both sides, outside of the numerous\r\nbattlefields of the long struggle; but it is certain they have been\r\ngrossly exaggerated, particularly by English writers, who took for\r\ngranted every wild statement made at the period. But, even granting that\r\nall the charges made were true, which, of course, we do not admit, the\r\nfact would not stamp the charge of cruelty on the Irish nation. It was\r\nan age of cruelty—the age of the Thirty Years’ War in Germany, which\r\ngave to the world the horrors of the sack of Magdeburgh; the age of the\r\nwars of the Fronde in France, and almost that of the Spanish atrocities\r\nin the Netherlands. And Cromwell was soon to appear upon the scene in\r\nIreland, to leave behind him a name more terrible than that of Tilly in\r\nGermany or of Alva in the Low Countries. In fact, in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, Europe, from east to west, was just emerging from Middle-Age\r\nbarbarism, and Ireland, most likely, was neither better nor worse than\r\nmost of her sister states. We love and respect the Irish race, but we do\r\nnot believe in painting it whiter than it is. The nation, plundered and\r\noutraged, was goaded to madness, and whatever crimes were committed\r\nunder such circumstances may well be attributed to the workings of\r\ntemporary insanity. It is, however, regrettable that around the history\r\nof the Irish insurrection of 1641 there should linger blood-red clouds,\r\nwhich even the lapse of two and a half centuries has not been able to\r\ndissipate.\r\n\r\nOn the Anglo-Irish side of the conflict, the name of Sir Charles Coote\r\nstands out in bloody pre-eminence. Like Sir Phelim, he had the grand\r\nvirtue of physical courage—he feared nothing in mortal shape—but in all\r\nelse he was a demon-brute, and his memory is still execrated throughout\r\nthe length and breadth of the land he scourged with scorpions. His\r\nsoldiers are accused of having impaled Irish infants on their\r\npikes—their mothers having been dishonored and butchered—without rebuke\r\nfrom their inhuman commander. On the contrary, McGee, a very painstaking\r\nand impartial historian, quotes Sir Charles Coote as saying that “he\r\nliked such frolics.” (McGee’s “History of Ireland,” Volume I, p. 502.)\r\nIt is not unpleasant to note that, after a career of the most aggressive\r\ncruelty, he was finally killed by a musket-shot during a petty skirmish\r\nin the County Meath, and it is popular belief that the shot was fired by\r\none of his own band of uniformed assassins.\r\n\r\nThe war proceeded in a rather desultory manner, chiefly because of lack\r\nof skill in the Irish generals—only a few of whom had seen service—and\r\nthe promised Irish military leaders had not yet sailed from the\r\nContinent. Sir Phelim O’Neill made an unsuccessful attack on Drogheda,\r\nand was also repulsed at other fortified places, owing to the lack of a\r\nsuitable battering train. English reinforcements kept pouring into\r\nDublin by the shipload, until a fine army of not less than 25,000 men,\r\nwith a numerous and well-served artillery, was in the field. The Irish\r\narmy amounted, nominally, to 30,000 men, but only a third of it was\r\narmed and properly trained.\r\n\r\nThe excesses of the English army in the peaceful Anglo-Catholic\r\ndistricts of Leinster aroused the resentment of the hitherto apathetic\r\nnobility and “gentry” of that fine province. They appointed Sir John\r\nRead to bear a protest to the king, but, while en route, he was\r\narrested, confined in Dublin Castle and put to the rack by the\r\nParliamentary Government. Even this outrage did not drive the\r\naristocrats of Leinster into immediate warfare. Other outrages followed\r\nin quick succession. Finally, Lord Gormanstown called a meeting of the\r\nCatholic peers and gentlemen to assemble at the hill of Crofty, in the\r\nCounty Meath. They met there accordingly, headed by the caller of the\r\ngathering. Other distinguished Palesmen present were the Earl of Fingal,\r\nLords Dunsany, Louth, Slane, Trimleston, and Netterville; Sir\r\nChristopher Bellew, Sir Patrick Barnewall, Nicholas Darcy, Gerald\r\nAylmer, and many others. While these personages were still deliberating,\r\nthey observed a group of horsemen, bearing arms, approaching at a rapid\r\npace. They were attended by a guard of musketeers, and proved to be the\r\ninsurgent chiefs of Roger O’More, Philip O’Reilly, Costello MacMahon,\r\nCaptains Byrne and Fox, and other leaders of the people. The party on\r\nthe hill immediately galloped on horseback to meet them, and Lord\r\nGormanstown, in loud and stern tones, asked: “Who are you, and why come\r\nyou armed into the Pale?” To this question O’More replied: “We represent\r\nthe persecuted people of the Catholic faith, and we come here for the\r\nassertion of the liberty of conscience, the maintenance of the royal\r\nprerogative, which we understand to be abridged, and the making of the\r\nsubjects in this Kingdom of Ireland as free as those of England.”\r\n“Then,” replied Gormanstown, “seeing that these be your true end and\r\nobject, we will likewise join with you!” The leaders on both sides then\r\njoined hands, amid the applause of their followers. A more formal\r\nmeeting was arranged for at the hill of Tara, and at that gathering,\r\nheld the next month, the alliance was formally concluded.\r\n\r\nThe faulty training of the Irish army was painfully illustrated soon\r\nafterward, when the forces of the newly made allies encountered those of\r\nLord Ormond at a place called Kilrush, near the town of Athy, in\r\nKildare, April 13, 1642. The numbers were about equal—perhaps 7,000 men\r\neach. The Irish were commanded by a brave but inexperienced officer,\r\nLord Mountgarret, and with him were Lords Dunboyne and Ikerrin, Rory\r\nO’More, Colonel Hugh O’Byrne, and Sir Morgan Kavanagh. Mountgarret\r\nfailed to occupy in time a difficult pass through which Ormond must\r\nmarch on his way to Dublin, and this failure compelled him to rearrange\r\nhis plan of battle. Confusion—as is always the case when this experiment\r\nis tried with raw soldiers—resulted. The Irish fought bravely for a\r\ntime, but were soon outmanœuvred and outflanked. The Anglo-Irish cavalry\r\ntook them in reverse. Colonel Kavanagh, fighting desperately at the head\r\nof his regiment, met a hero’s death. His fall discouraged his troops,\r\nwho broke and fled to a neighboring bog, whither the hostile cavalry\r\ncould not safely pursue them. The other Irish troops, surrounded on all\r\nsides, made a rush for the morass also, broke through the enemy’s ranks\r\nand joined their vanquished comrades. On the Irish side, 700 officers\r\nand men fell in this untoward affair. The loss of the Anglo-Irish was\r\nmuch smaller, and Ormond was enabled to proceed in a species of triumph\r\nto Dublin, where the news of his victory preceded his arrival.\r\n\r\nIt is passing strange that, after the battle of Kilrush, the great\r\norganizer of the insurrection, Roger O’More, is heard of never more in\r\nhis country’s troubled annals. All accounts agree that, during the\r\ncombat, he acted his part like a true soldier, but he failed to reappear\r\nin the Irish ranks during subsequent conflicts. His was certainly a\r\nmysterious and unaccountable disappearance.\r\n\r\nThe late Rev. C. P. Meehan, author of “The Confederation of Kilkenny,”\r\nwho gave more attention to that period of his country’s story than any\r\nother writer, says, on page 26 of his interesting work: “After the\r\nbattle of Kilrush, one bright name disappears [he mentions O’More in a\r\nfoot-note]; the last time the inspiriting war-shout of his followers\r\nfell on his ear was on that hillside. What reasons there may have been\r\nfor the retirement of the gallant chief, whose name was linked with that\r\nof God and Our Lady, are not apparent; but it is said, upon authority,\r\nthat he proceeded to Ferns, and devoted the rest of his days to peaceful\r\npursuits in the bosom of his family.” The historian Coote says that he\r\ndied at Kilkenny. This was, surely, a “lame and impotent conclusion” to\r\nsuch a career. The defeat of his countrymen may have destroyed his\r\nhopes, or he may have had reason to doubt the loyalty of his allies of\r\nthe Pale. We are inclined to believe an old Leinster tradition, which\r\nsays that he died of a broken heart immediately after the lost battle,\r\non which he had built such high hopes. Such a spirit as his could not\r\nhave remained inactive during the nine long years of the struggle,\r\ninaugurated by himself, which followed the disaster at Kilrush.\r\n\r\nWe can not dismiss this extraordinary man from our pages without quoting\r\nthe following introduction to a ballad dealing with his career in Edward\r\nHayes’s remarkable collection of poetry, called “The Ballads of\r\nIreland,” vol. I, page 173:\r\n\r\n“Roger, or Rory, O’More, is one of the most honored and stainless names\r\nin Irish annals. Writers who concur in nothing else agree in\r\nrepresenting him as a man of the loftiest motives and the most\r\npassionate patriotism. In 1640, when Ireland was weakened by defeat and\r\nconfiscation, and guarded with a jealous care, constantly increasing in\r\nstrictness and severity, O’More, then a private gentleman with no\r\nresources beyond his intellect and courage, conceived the vast design of\r\nrescuing her from England, and accomplished it. In three years England\r\ndid not retain a city in the island but Dublin and Drogheda. For eight\r\nyears her power was merely nominal, the land was possessed and the\r\nsupreme authority exercised by the Confederation created by O’More.\r\nHistory contains no stricter instance of the influence of an individual\r\nmind. Before the insurrection broke out the people had learned to know\r\nand expect their Deliverer, and it became a popular proverb, and the\r\nburden of national songs, that the hope of Ireland was in ‘God, the\r\nVirgin, and Rory O’More.’ It is remarkable that O’More, in whose courage\r\nand resources the great insurrection had its birth, was a descendant of\r\nthe chieftains of Leix, massacred by English troops at Mullaghmast a\r\ncentury before. But if he took a great revenge, it was a magnanimous\r\none. None of the excesses which stained the first rising in Ulster is\r\ncharged upon him. On the contrary, when he joined the northern army, the\r\nexcesses ceased, and strict discipline was established, as far as it was\r\npossible, among men unaccustomed to control, and wild with wrongs and\r\nsufferings.” Says De Vere, in his sadly beautiful dirge, which assumes\r\nthat the great leader died in 1642, as the people of Leinster have been\r\ntaught to believe—\r\n\r\n        “’Twas no dream, Mother Land! ’Twas no dream, Innisfail!\r\n         Hope dreams but grief dreams not—the grief of the Gael!\r\n         From Leix and Ikerrin to Donegal’s shore,\r\n         Rolls the dirge of thy last and thy bravest O’More!”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n Proceedings of the Confederation of Kilkenny—Arrival of Owen Roe O’Neill\r\n                              and Rinuccini\r\n\r\n\r\nOUT of the chaos of a popular uprising, and a number of minor councils,\r\nwhich could decide only for localities, there sprang into existence the\r\nNational Synod, composed of clerics and laymen of the Catholic\r\npersuasion, because, at this period, few, if any of the Irish\r\nProtestants were in sympathy with the insurrection, or revolution, which\r\nis a more fitting term. The “oath of association” was formulated by the\r\nvenerable Bishop Rothe, and, somewhat unnecessarily, seeing that the\r\nKing of England was using all the forces at his disposal to crush “the\r\nrebellion,” pledged true faith and allegiance to Charles I and his\r\nlawful successors. The fundamental laws of Ireland and the “free\r\nexercise of the Roman Catholic faith and religion” were to be\r\nmaintained. Then came the second, and most important, part of the solemn\r\nand, as some thought, stringent obligation, which bound all Confederate\r\nCatholics never to accept or submit to any peace without the consent and\r\napprobation of their own general assembly.\r\n\r\nA constitution was framed which declared the war just and\r\nconstitutional, condemned racial distinctions such as “New” and “Old”\r\nIrish, ordained an elective council for each of the four provinces, and\r\na national council for the whole kingdom, condemned, as excommunicate,\r\nall who might violate the oath of association, or who should be guilty\r\nof murder, assault, cruelty, or plunder under cover of the war.\r\n\r\nThe bishops and priests, very wisely, decided that a layman should be\r\nelected president of the National Council, and Lord Mountgarret was so\r\nchosen, with Richard Belling, lawyer and litterateur, as secretary. Both\r\nwere men of moderate opinion and free from any taint of prejudice.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that the Supreme, or National, Council should hold its\r\nfirst session in the city of Kilkenny on October 23, 1642, the\r\nanniversary of the rising; and “the choice of such a date,” says McGee,\r\n“by men of Mountgarret’s and Belling’s moderation and judgment, six\r\nmonths after the date of the alleged ‘massacre,’ would form another\r\nproof, if any were now needed, that none of the alleged atrocities (of\r\n1641) were yet associated with that particular day.”\r\n\r\nBetween the adjournment of the National Synod, in May, and the meeting\r\nof the Council in October, many stirring events occurred. The\r\nconfederate general in Munster, the aged Barry, made an unsuccessful\r\nattempt to capture Cork, but had better success at Limerick, which\r\nsurrendered to the Irish army on June 21. Soon afterward the Anglo-Irish\r\nleader, General St. Ledger, died at Cork, and the command devolved upon\r\nMurrough O’Brien, Baron of Inchiquin, who had been brought up from an\r\nearly age as one of Parsons’ chancery wards, and had, therefore, become\r\na Protestant. Furthermore, he had grown to be an anti-Irish Irishman of\r\nthe blackest and bloodiest type. In Irish history, he is known as “Black\r\nMurrough the Burner,” because the torch, under his brutal sway, kept\r\nsteady company with the sword, and both were rarely idle. He served the\r\nking as long as the royal policy suited his views, but, when it did not,\r\nhis services were at the disposal of the opposition. Murrough had served\r\nhis military apprenticeship under Sir Charles Coote and was a past\r\nmaster in all the cruelties practiced by his infamous instructor. The\r\ncurse of the renegade was strong upon him, for he hated his own kin more\r\nbitterly than if he were an alien and a Briton. Of the ancient royal\r\nhouses of Ireland, those of MacMurrough and O’Brien present the\r\nstrongest contrasts of good and evil.\r\n\r\nThe Irish forces succeeded in taking the castles of Loughgar and\r\nAskeaton, but Inchiquin inflicted a severe defeat upon them at\r\nLiscarroll, where the loss was nearly a thousand men on the side of\r\nIreland, whereas the victor boasted that there fell only a score on his\r\nside. There were also some skirmishes in Connaught, where the peculiar\r\ninactivity of Lord Clanricarde produced discontent, and led to a popular\r\noutbreak in the town of Galway which General Willoughby speedily\r\nsuppressed, with every circumstance of savage brutality. Affairs in\r\nLeinster continued rather tranquil. Ormond was raised by the king to the\r\ndignity of marquis, but does not seem to have been trusted by the\r\nPuritan Lords Justices, Parsons and Borlaise. The fall of the year was\r\nsignalized, however, by the landing in Ireland of three able generals,\r\nall of whom fought on the national side—Right Hon. James Touchet, Earl\r\nof Castlehaven, who had been imprisoned as a suspect in Dublin Castle,\r\nbut managed to effect his escape; Colonel Thomas Preston, the heroic\r\ndefender of Louvain, who debarked at Wexford, bringing with him 500\r\nofficers of experience, several siege guns, a few light field-pieces,\r\nand a limited quantity of small arms; and last, but most welcome to\r\nIreland, arrived from Spain Colonel Owen Roe O’Neill, who made a landing\r\non the Donegal coast with 100 officers, a company of Irish veterans, and\r\na quantity of muskets and ammunition. He immediately proceeded to the\r\nfort of Charlemont, held by his fierce kinsman, Sir Phelim O’Neill, who,\r\nwith commendable patriotic self-sacrifice, resigned to him, unsolicited,\r\nthe command of the Irish army of the North, and became, instead of\r\ngeneralissimo, “President of Ulster.”\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the arrival of Owen Roe, General Lord Leven came\r\ninto Ireland from Scotland with 10,000 Puritan soldiers. He had met\r\nO’Neill in the foreign wars and expressed publicly his surprise that he\r\nshould be “engaged in so bad a cause”—to which Owen replied that he had\r\na much better right to come to the rescue of Ireland, his native\r\ncountry, than Lord Leven had to march into England against his\r\nacknowledged monarch. Leven did not remain long in Ireland, and the\r\ncommand of his troops fell to General Monroe—a brave but slow man, on\r\nwhom the advice of his predecessor to act with vigor was thrown away.\r\nMonroe’s dilatory tactics enabled O’Neill, who had wonderful talent for\r\nmilitary organization, to recruit, drill, and equip a formidable force,\r\nmainly made up of the men of Tyrone and Donegal—as fine a body of troops\r\nas Ireland had ever summoned to her defence. The valorous clansmen were\r\nspeedily molded into a military machine by their redoubted chief, who\r\nset the example of activity to all of his command.\r\n\r\nWhen the Supreme Council of the Irish Confederation met in Kilkenny,\r\naccording to agreement, one of its most important acts was the\r\nappointing of generals to command in the several provinces. It named\r\nOwen O’Neill commander-in-chief in Ulster, General Sir Thomas Preston in\r\nLeinster, General Barry in Munster, and General Sir John Burke in\r\nConnaught. Fighting was resumed with vigor. Preston met with alternate\r\nsuccesses and reverses in his province, but, on the whole, came out\r\nvictorious. Barry and his lieutenants did brilliant work in Munster, and\r\nrouted both Vavassour and Inchiquin. O’Neill played a Fabian game in\r\nUlster, training his army in partial engagements with the enemy and\r\nhusbanding his resources for some great occasion, which, he saw, would\r\nsurely come. But the brightest laurels of the campaign were gathered by\r\nGeneral Sir John Burke, who, after other brilliant exploits, compelled\r\nGeneral Willoughby to surrender the city of Galway to the Irish forces\r\non June 20, 1643; and the national flag waved from the tower of its\r\ncitadel until the last shot of the war was fired nine years thereafter.\r\nClanricarde, who could have had the command in chief, paltered with\r\ntime, and thus lost the opportunity of linking his name with a glorious\r\nexploit.\r\n\r\nAll the Irish armies, and particularly that under O’Neill, occupied\r\nexcellent strategic positions, and the hopes of the military chiefs and\r\nthe nation rose high when, suddenly, there came a blight upon those\r\nhopes in the shape of a cessation of hostilities—in other words, a\r\nprolonged armistice—agreed to between the Anglo-Catholic majority in the\r\nNational Council on the one side, and the Marquis of Ormond,\r\nrepresenting the King of England, on the other. The Anglo-Catholics were\r\nagain duped by pretences of liberality toward their religion, as their\r\nfathers had been in the days of Elizabeth; and this ill-considered truce\r\nwrested from Ireland all the advantages won in the war—which had already\r\nlasted two years—by the ability of her generals and the courage of her\r\ntroops. Vain was the protest of O’Neill, of Preston, of Burke, of Barry,\r\nof the Papal Nuncio, of the majority of the Irish nation. Charles was in\r\nstraits in England, fighting the Parliamentary forces arrayed against\r\nhis acts of despotism, and Ormond promised everything in order to end\r\nthe war in Ireland, temporarily at least, and so be enabled to send\r\nneeded succor to a sovereign whom he loved and served much better than\r\nhe did God and country. With incredible fatuity, the Anglo-Catholic\r\nmajority in the National Council listened to the voice of Ormond, and\r\nvoted men and money to support the cause of the bad king who had let\r\nStrafford loose upon Ireland! We are glad to be able to say that the\r\n“Old Irish” element, represented by the brave and able O’Neill, was in\r\nnowise responsible for this act of weakness and folly. O’Neill saw into\r\nfuturity, and frightful must have been that vision to the patriot-hero,\r\nfor it included the horrors of Drogheda and Wexford, where the thirsty\r\nsword of Cromwell bitterly avenged on Ireland the foolish and fatal\r\n“truce of Castlemartin”; another lesson to nations, if indeed another\r\nwere needed, to avoid mixing up in the quarrels of their neighbors.\r\nIreland invited ruin on that dark day when she voted to draw the sword\r\nfor the ungrateful Charles Stuart against the Parliament of England. The\r\ntemporary concession of Catholic privileges—designed to be withdrawn\r\nwhen victory perched on the royal banner—was poor compensation for the\r\nloss of advantages gained at the price of the blood of brave men, and\r\nthe sowing of a wind of vengeance which produced the Cromwellian\r\nwhirlwind. If King Charles had ever done a fair or manly act by\r\nIreland—even by the Anglo-Catholics of Ireland—the folly of that country\r\nmight be, in a measure, excusable, but his whole policy had been, on the\r\ncontrary, cold-blooded, double-faced, and thoroughly ungrateful. In this\r\ninstance, the Anglo-Irish Catholics brought all their subsequent\r\nmisfortunes on themselves. As if to emphasize its imbecility, the\r\nNational Council placed Lord Castlehaven, an English Catholic, in\r\nsupreme command over O’Neill in Ulster. Owen Roe was, of course,\r\ndisgusted, but was also too good a soldier and too zealous a patriot to\r\nresign his command and go back to Spain, as a man of less noble nature\r\nmight have done. Meanwhile, Monroe and his army of 10,000 Lowland Scotch\r\nand Ulster “Undertakers” kept gathering like a thundercloud in the\r\nnorth. In Scotland a body of 3,000 Antrim Irish, under Alister\r\nMacDonald, called Cal-Kitto, or “the Left-handed,” were covering\r\nthemselves with glory, fighting under the great Marquis of Montrose in\r\nthe unworthy royal cause. And we read that the Irish Confederate\r\ntreasury, about this time, is somewhat replenished by funds sent from\r\nSpain and Rome. Even the great Cardinal Richelieu, of France, to show\r\nhis sympathy with Ireland, invited Con, the last surviving son of the\r\ngreat O’Neill, to the French court, and permitted the shipment of much\r\nneeded cannon to Ireland. But all of those good foreign friends of the\r\nIrish cause were sickened and discouraged by the miserable policy of\r\narmistice, so blindly consented to by the lukewarm “Marchmen of the\r\nPale” who had assembled in Kilkenny.\r\n\r\nMany Irish Protestants, particularly the High Church element, were\r\nardent royalists and refused to take the oath of the Covenanters\r\nprescribed in Ulster by General Monroe. They were driven with violence\r\nfrom their homes, and many fled for succor to their Catholic brethren,\r\nwho treated them with hospitable consideration. In Munster, the\r\nferocious Inchiquin, and still more savage Lord Broghill, son of Boyle,\r\nfirst Earl of Cork, foiled in their ambitious schemes by some royal\r\nrefusal, broke out most violently, pretending the armistice was\r\nviolated, and seized upon three leading Southern towns—Cork, Kinsale,\r\nand Youghal, where their excesses were too horrible for narration—murder\r\nand arson being among the lightest of their crimes. Ormond, in his\r\npeculiarly adroit way, succeeded in still further prolonging the truce,\r\nand stated that he had power from the king to come to a permanent\r\nagreement with the Confederates. The cause of Ireland about this time\r\nlost a true and ardent friend and champion in the death of the good Pope\r\nUrban VIII, who was succeeded by Innocent X—a Pontiff whose noble\r\ngenerosity is still gratefully remembered by the Irish nation. It was to\r\none of their worthy predecessors, in the time of the Elizabethan wars,\r\nO’Donnell’s bard referred, when addressing Ireland, in allegorical\r\nfashion, he sang:\r\n\r\n                  “O! my dark Rosaleen!\r\n                    Do not sigh, do not weep—\r\n                   The priests are on the ocean green—\r\n                    They march along the deep!\r\n                   There’s wine from the Royal Pope,\r\n                    Upon the ocean green,\r\n                   And Spanish ale to give you hope,\r\n                    My dark Rosaleen!”\r\n\r\nNathless the truce, those two bad Irishmen, Inchiquin and Broghill,\r\ncontinued to do base work in the South, where their cold-blooded\r\natrocities struck terror into the wretched people of Munster. They even\r\ncorrupted old Lord Esmond, commandant of Duncannon fort, which partly\r\ncommanded the important harbor of Waterford from the Wexford side.\r\nEsmond was blind and almost senile, and, perhaps, too, was terrorized by\r\nthe brutal threats of Inchiquin. But Lord Castlehaven and the\r\nConfederate Irish immediately laid siege to the place, and, after ten\r\nweeks of beleaguerment, succeeded in retaking it. The traitorous\r\ncommandant perished in the assault, and thus escaped an ignominious\r\ndeath, which his crime had richly merited. Several other Munster towns,\r\nheld by Inchiquin and his officers, were successively attacked and taken\r\nby the Confederates. In Connaught, however, the latter met with serious\r\nreverses. The town of Sligo was captured by Sir Charles Coote, Jr.—a\r\nworse scourge than even his infamous father—and, in an attempt to\r\nrecover it, several gallant Irishmen perished. Archbishop O’Healy, of\r\nTuam, fell into the hands of Coote and was barbarously tortured to\r\ndeath, Sunday, October 26, 1645. It must be remembered that these\r\nhostilities were the work of the Parliamentary forces, which were\r\nopposed by the “Old Irish” party. The royal troops had been sent to\r\nEngland to assist Charles, or else lay supine in their garrisons, as did\r\nalso the Anglo-Irish, waiting for further developments.\r\n\r\nThe king sent the Earl of Glamorgan, an English Catholic, who had\r\nintermarried with the O’Brien family, to Ireland to negotiate a new\r\ntreaty with the Confederates. He succeeded in having a preliminary\r\ndocument drawn up, signed by himself for Charles, and by Lord\r\nMountgarret and Muskerry on behalf of the Confederates. Ormond, with his\r\ncustomary dilatoriness, haggled over the provisions regarding toleration\r\nof the Catholic Church in the kingdom, and thus frittered away much\r\nvaluable time, which the Parliamentary forces made good use of. Ormond\r\ncaused the treaty to be greatly modified, and while the negotiators were\r\nworking on it at Kilkenny, there arrived in Ireland a new Papal Nuncio,\r\nin the person of the famous John Baptist Rinuccini, Archbishop of Ferns,\r\nand, afterward, Cardinal. He came to represent Pope Innocent X, who sent\r\nalso substantial aid. The Irish in exile and their friends sent, through\r\nFather Luke Wadding, a further contribution of $36,000. The Nuncio\r\ncomplained that he had been unreasonably detained in France—it was\r\ngreatly suspected by the intrigues of Cardinal Mazarin, who had\r\nsucceeded Richelieu, Ireland’s true friend. In spite of this trickery,\r\nhowever, he managed to purchase, with Pope Innocent’s funds, a 26-gun\r\nfrigate, which he called the _San Pietro_, 2,000 muskets, 2,000\r\ncartridge boxes, 4,000 swords, 2,000 pike-heads, 800 horse pistols,\r\n20,000 pounds of powder, and other much needed supplies. (McGee.) A\r\nludicrous cause of one of his delays in France was the obstinacy of the\r\nwife of Charles I, Henrietta Maria, daughter of Henry of Navarre, who\r\ninsisted that she would not receive the Papal Nuncio unless he uncovered\r\nin her presence. Rinuccini was proud and fiery, and, as representing the\r\nPope, declined to remove his biretta, which so angered the queen that,\r\nafter six weeks’ parleying on this point of etiquette, the pair\r\nseparated without coming to an interview. Such is the farcical folly of\r\n“royal minds.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n Treason of Ormond to the Catholic Cause—Owen Roe O’Neill, Aided by the\r\n                       Nuncio, Prepares to Fight\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Papal Nuncio, although only in the prime of life, was in feeble\r\nhealth, and had to be borne on a litter by relays of able-bodied men,\r\nfrom his landing-place, at Kenmare in Kerry, to the city of Limerick,\r\nwhere he was received with all the ceremony due to his high rank, noble\r\ncharacter, and chivalrous mission. From Limerick he proceeded by the\r\nsame mode of conveyance to Kilkenny, the Confederate capital, where\r\nhonors almost regal in their splendor awaited him. Lord Mountgarret,\r\nPresident of the National Council—a veteran soldier who had participated\r\nin the wars of Hugh O’Neill against Elizabeth—met the Papal dignitary,\r\nsurrounded by a guard of honor, composed of the youthful chivalry of the\r\nConfederation, in the picture gallery of the Castle of Kilkenny—the\r\npalatial residence of the Duke of Ormond, the most politic nobleman of\r\nthe age. The so-called Glamorgan treaty proceeded smoothly enough until\r\ncertain demands of the exiled English Catholics, made through the\r\nNuncio, were included in its provisions. Armed with the amended\r\nparchment, Glamorgan and the representatives of the Confederates\r\nreturned to Dublin and laid the matter before Ormond. The latter acted\r\nin so strange a manner as to take the Confederate delegates completely\r\nby surprise. He had Glamorgan arrested while at dinner, on charge of\r\nhaving exceeded his instructions, and threw him into prison. The\r\nConfederate envoys were sent back to Kilkenny, charged to inform the\r\nPresident and Council that the clauses concerning the English Catholics\r\nwere inadmissible and never could be entertained by the English people\r\nwho supported the cause of Charles. Lord Mountgarret and his associates\r\nbroke off all negotiations with Ormond pending the release of Glamorgan,\r\nwhich they firmly demanded. Ormond required bail to the amount of\r\n£40,000, and the bond was furnished by the Earls of Kildare and\r\nClanricarde. When Glamorgan was enlarged, he proceeded to Kilkenny,\r\nwhere, to the amazement of the Confederates and the Nuncio he defended,\r\nrather than censured, Ormond’s course toward himself. On which McGee\r\ngrimly remarks: “To most observers it appeared that these noblemen\r\nunderstood each other only too well.”\r\n\r\nFrequent bickerings occurred at Kilkenny between Mountgarret’s\r\nfollowers, or the Anglo-Irish, and the Nuncio’s followers, the “Old\r\nIrish,” who were in the minority. Rinuccini’s heart was with the latter,\r\nfor, by instinct as well as observation, he recognized that they were\r\nthe only real national party among the Irish factions. The rest he put\r\ndown, with good reason, as time-servers and provincialists—ever ready to\r\ngo back to their gilded cages the moment the English power filled their\r\ncups with Catholic concessions. With a little more knowledge of Ireland\r\nand her people, the Nuncio would have been a marvelous leader. As it\r\nwas, he did the very best he could for Ireland—according to his\r\nlights—and he was one of the very few foreigners who, on coming in close\r\ncontact with the situation—remained true to the Irish cause through good\r\nand evil report. He was, of course, a devoted Catholic, but in no sense\r\na bigot. Irishmen should always hold his name in high honor. Any\r\nmistakes the Nuncio committed were due to lack of familiarity with\r\nsurrounding conditions, very excusable in an alien.\r\n\r\nBut the Glamorgan treaty would appear to have been taken up at Rome,\r\nwhere Sir Kenelm Digby and the pontifical ministers concluded a truce\r\nfavorable to the interests of both Irish and English Catholics. The king\r\nneeded the 10,000 Irish troops which he knew the Confederates could\r\nplace at his disposal. In March, 1646, a modified Glamorgan treaty was\r\nfinally signed by Ormond for King Charles, and by Lord Muskerry and\r\nother Confederate leaders for their party. “These thirty articles,”\r\ncomments McGee, “conceded, in fact, all the most essential claims of the\r\nIrish; they secured them equal rights as to property, the army, the\r\nuniversities, and the bar. They gave them seats in both Houses and on\r\nthe bench. They authorized a special commission of Oyer and Terminer,\r\ncomposed wholly of Confederates. They declared that ‘the independency of\r\nthe Parliament of Ireland on that of England’ should be decided by\r\ndeclaration of both Houses, agreeably to the laws of the Kingdom of\r\nIreland. In short, the final form of Glamorgan’s treaty gave the Irish\r\nCatholics, in 1646, all that was subsequently obtained, either for the\r\nChurch or the country, in 1782, 1793, and 1829. Though some conditions\r\nwere omitted, to which the Nuncio and a majority of the prelates\r\nattached importance, Glamorgan’s treaty was, upon the whole, a charter\r\nupon which a free church and a free people might well have stood, as the\r\nfundamental law of their religious and civil liberties.”\r\n\r\nThese concessions proved to be a new “delusion, mockery, and snare.”\r\nOrmond tricked the Confederates, and the poltroon king, just before his\r\nfatal flight to the camp of the mercenary Scots’ army of General Lord\r\nLeven, which promptly sold him to the English Parliament, for the amount\r\nof its back pay, disclaimed the Glamorgan treaty in toto—a policy\r\nentirely in keeping with his unmanly, vacillating nature.\r\n\r\nOwen Roe O’Neill, notwithstanding many and grievous vexations, chiefly\r\narising from the absurd jealousy of General Preston, had his army well\r\nin hand on the borders of Leinster and Ulster, prepared to strike a blow\r\nat the enemy wherever it might be most needed. He was in free\r\ncommunication with the Nuncio, who, according to all the historians of\r\nthe period, supplied him with the necessary means for making an\r\naggressive movement. The Anglo-Scotch army of General Monroe presented\r\nthe fairest mark for O’Neill’s prowess, and against that force his\r\nmovements were, accordingly, directed.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n The Famous Irish Victory of Benburb—Cruel Murder of the Catholic Bishop\r\n                                 of Ross\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE forces of the belligerents were not large, according to our more\r\nmodern standards. In his comprehensive “History of Ireland,” the Rev.\r\nAbbe McGeoghegan credits Owen Roe with only 5,000 infantry and 500\r\nhorse, while he calls Monroe’s force 6,000 foot and 800 cavalry. The\r\nobjective of both generals was the ancient city of Armagh, and the\r\ngrand-nephew of the great Hugh O’Neill was destined to win one of\r\nIreland’s proudest victories in the immediate neighborhood of his\r\ngrand-uncle’s most famous battlefield—the Yellow Ford. Marching\r\nnorthward from the borders of Leinster, Owen Roe crossed the historic\r\nBlackwater and took position at a place called Benburb, in the present\r\ncounty of Tyrone. Monroe advanced to attack him, and ordered his younger\r\nbrother, George Monroe, who commanded a strong detachment, to join\r\nforces with the main body without delay. O’Neill, apprised by his scouts\r\nof this movement, sent two regiments, under Colonels MacMahon and\r\nMacNenay, to intercept young Monroe at a pass through which he would be\r\ncompelled to defile his troops in order to form a junction with his\r\nbrother. The two colonels obeyed their orders so strictly that George\r\nMonroe’s force was so utterly broken and routed that it was unable to\r\nrender any service to the Puritan general during the remainder of the\r\ncampaign. The victors immediately rejoined O’Neill, who, in the interim,\r\nhad detached Colonel Ricard O’Ferrall to obstruct the elder Monroe’s\r\nmarch from Kinnaird to Caledon, where he had crossed the Blackwater. The\r\nScotchman’s cannon proved too much for O’Ferrall, who could only reply\r\nwith musketry, but he retired in admirable order, although closely\r\npressed by Monroe’s stronger vanguard. The battle of Benburb began on\r\nthe morning of June 16th, new style, 1646. O’Neill’s post was near the\r\nriver, his flanks protected by two small hills, and his rear by a\r\nwood—all held by chosen troops. Throughout most of the day, the Scots,\r\nwho had both sun and wind at their backs, seemed to have the advantage,\r\nin so far as partial demonstrations could determine the question.\r\nO’Neill, in expectation of a reinforcement from the direction of\r\nColeraine, “amused” the Scotch general until the sun had shifted\r\nposition and no longer shone full and dazzlingly in the faces of the\r\nIrish soldiers. Almost at this propitious moment, the expected auxiliary\r\nforce reached the field, and took up position in O’Neill’s line of\r\nbattle. Rev. C. P. Meehan, historian of the “Confederation of Kilkenny,”\r\nwho quotes Monroe’s despatch, Rinuccini’s letters, and other\r\ncontemporaneous authorities, says: “It was the decisive moment. The\r\nIrish general, throwing himself into the midst of his men, and, pointing\r\nout to them that retreat must be fatal to the enemy, ordered them to\r\ncharge and pursue vigorously. A far resounding cheer rose from the Irish\r\nranks. ‘Myself,’ said he, ‘with the aid of Heaven, will lead the way.\r\nLet those who fail to follow me remember that they abandon their\r\ngeneral.’ This address was received with one unanimous shout by the\r\narmy. The Irish colonels threw themselves from their horses, to cut\r\nthemselves off from every chance of retreat, and charged with incredible\r\nimpetuosity.” Some musketry was used, but the victory was decided in\r\nIreland’s favor by her ancient and favorite weapon, the deadly pike,\r\nwhich may be called the parent of the bayonet. Monroe’s cavalry charged\r\nboldly that bristling front of spears, but was overthrown in an instant\r\nand all but annihilated. Vain, then, became the fire of the vaunted\r\ncannon of the Scotch commander and the crashing volleys of his small\r\narms. Vainly he himself and his chosen officers, sword in hand, set an\r\nexample of courage to their men. With the shout of “Lamh Dearg Aboo!”\r\nwhich, fifty years before, had sounded the death-knell of Bagnal,\r\nKildare, and De Burgh, on the banks of the same historic river, the\r\nIrish clansmen rushed upon their foes. The struggle was brief and\r\nbitter. Lord Blaney’s English regiment perished almost to the last man,\r\nfighting heroically to the end. The Scottish cavalry was utterly broken\r\nand fled pell-mell, leaving the infantry to their fate. Lord\r\nMontgomery’s regiment alone retired in good order, although with\r\nconsiderable loss, but Montgomery himself, fifty other officers, and\r\nsome two hundred soldiers, were made prisoners. Monroe fled, without hat\r\nor wig, and tradition says he lost his sword in swimming his horse\r\nacross the Blackwater. Of the Anglo-Scotch army, there died upon the\r\nfield 3,243 officers and men, and many more perished during the vengeful\r\npursuit of the victors, who do not appear to have been in a forgiving\r\nmood. O’Neill acknowledged a loss of seventy men killed and several\r\nhundred wounded. The Scottish army lost all of its baggage, tents,\r\ncannon, small arms, military chest, and, besides, thirty-two stand of\r\nbattle-flags. Fifteen hundred draught horses and enough food supplies to\r\nlast the Irish army for many months also fell into the hands of the\r\nvanquishers. Monroe’s army was, virtually, destroyed, and he sullied a\r\npreviously honorable record by plundering and burning many villages and\r\nisolated houses to gratify his spite against the people whose soldiers\r\nhad so grievously humiliated him.\r\n\r\nO’Neill’s fine military instinct impelled him to follow up his success\r\nby giving Monroe no rest until he had driven him from Ulster, but,\r\nunfortunately, there came at this crisis a request, which really meant\r\nan order, from the Nuncio, to march the Ulster army into Leinster in\r\norder that it might support those who were opposed in the Council at\r\nKilkenny to entering into further peace negotiations with the bigoted\r\nOrmond and the now impotent king. O’Neill could hardly decline this\r\nmisdirected mission, but it proved to be, in the end, a fatal act of\r\nobedience. From that hour the Irish cause began to decline. General\r\nPreston, O’Neill’s fierce Anglo-Irish rival, and fanatically devoted to\r\nthe cause of Charles, engaged in battle with the Parliamentary general,\r\nMichael Jones, at Dungan Hill in Meath, and was totally routed, with\r\nimmense loss. It is only proper to remark here, that the “Old” Irish did\r\nthe best fighting during this war, because their hearts were in the\r\nstruggle, while the Anglo-Irish, who mainly composed the armies under\r\nPreston and Lord Taaffe—the latter of whom was ignominiously defeated at\r\nKnockinoss, near Mallow in Cork—were only half-hearted in their efforts.\r\nTaaffe’s defeat was aggravated by the cruel murder of the brave\r\n“Left-handed” MacDonnell of Antrim, who, after having been made\r\nprisoner, was barbarously put to death by order of the murderous\r\nrenegade, “Murrough the Burner,” who commanded the victors. This\r\nbloody-minded wretch further signalized his cruelty by storming the city\r\nof Cashel and sacking the grand cathedral, founded by one of his own\r\nprincely ancestors, in the twelfth century. Hundreds of non-combatants\r\nof all ages and both sexes, who had taken refuge in the holy place, were\r\nruthlessly massacred, and twenty priests were dragged from under the\r\nhigh altar and wantonly butchered. Lord Broghill emphasized his\r\nbrutality in Cork County by hanging before the walls of Macroom Castle\r\nthe saintly Bishop MacEagan of Ross, who refused to counsel the Irish\r\ngarrison to surrender. Dr. Madden, a gifted poet, summed up the noble\r\nrefusal and its tragical consequences in the following lines:\r\n\r\n          “The orders are given, the prisoner is led\r\n            To the castle, and round him are menacing hordes:\r\n           Undaunted, approaching the walls, at the head\r\n            Of the troopers of Cromwell, he utters these words:\r\n\r\n          “‘Beware of the cockatrice—trust not the wiles\r\n            Of the serpent, for perfidy skulks in its folds!\r\n           Beware of Lord Broghill the day that he smiles!\r\n            His mercy is murder!—his word never holds!\r\n\r\n          “Remember, ’tis writ in our annals of blood,\r\n            Our countrymen never relied on the faith\r\n           Of truce, or of treaty, but treason ensued—\r\n            And the issue of every delusion was death!’\r\n\r\n          “He died on the scaffold in front of those walls,\r\n            Where the blackness of ruin is seen from afar,\r\n           And the gloom of their desolate aspect recalls\r\n            The blackest of Broghill’s achievements in war.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n Ormond’s Treacherous Surrender of Dublin—Ireland’s Choice of Two Evils\r\n\r\n\r\nORMOND would seem to have been the evil genius of the Irish nation at\r\nthis period of its history. He was suspected by the Confederates and\r\ndistrusted by the Parliamentarians. The former, convinced that he meant\r\nto betray Dublin, which was poorly fortified, to the latter, ordered\r\nO’Neill and Preston to unite their forces and take it from Ormond.\r\nPreston, who was, to all appearance, more of a royalist Palesman than an\r\nIrishman, threw obstacles in the way of the intended assault, and\r\nproposed to parley with Ormond before assuming the aggressive. Owing to\r\nthis dilatoriness, and because of a false alarm, the combined Irish\r\nforces retired from before the city without accomplishing anything.\r\nThere was mutual distrust between the unwilling allies, and, as usual,\r\nIreland was the sufferer. Preston’s jealousy of O’Neill amounted to a\r\nfrenzy, and, before an accommodation could be arrived at, Ormond\r\nsurrendered the city to the Parliamentary forces, under General Jones,\r\nand fled to France, where, unaccountably, considering his suspicious\r\nconduct, he was favorably received. After a year’s absence, he returned\r\nto Ireland, and, finding the royal cause desperate, concluded a peace\r\nbetween the king’s supporters, the Confederates, and the National party,\r\nheaded by Owen O’Neill. This treaty was, virtually, a revival of that\r\nsubmitted by Glamorgan, and fully recognized, when all too late, the\r\njustice of the Catholic claims to liberty of conscience. Had the\r\noriginal instrument been adopted, Charles could have held Ireland\r\nagainst the Parliament. But his days were now numbered, and he died on\r\nthe scaffold, in front of his own palace of Whitehall, on January 30,\r\n1649.\r\n\r\nThe Royalist party at once recognized his heir as Charles II. They were\r\nreinforced by many Parliamentarian Protestants who were shocked and\r\nhorrified by the decapitation of the king; and so Old Irish and New\r\nIrish, Confederates and Ormondists, made common cause against the\r\nParliament, which was defended in Dublin by the redoubtable General\r\nJones, and in Derry by the ferocious younger Coote. Even the sanguinary\r\nInchiquin again became a Royalist and captured several towns of strength\r\nand importance from his recent allies. Ormond massed his army and, aided\r\nby Major-General Purcell, made an attempt to storm Dublin. But Michael\r\nJones made a night sortie from the city and scattered Ormond and Purcell\r\nand their followers to the winds of heaven. The Irish generals mutually\r\nblamed each other and there was much bitter crimination and\r\nrecrimination, but all this could not remedy the disaster that\r\nincapacity and over-confidence had brought about. Owen O’Neill kept his\r\narmy, which fronted Coote, near Derry, intact, but lost his best friend\r\nwhen the impetuous Nuncio, who had spared neither denunciation nor\r\nexcommunication in dealing with the trimming Anglo-Catholic leaders,\r\ndisgusted with the whole wretched business, suddenly departed for the\r\nport of Galway and sailed in his own ship for Rome. Had this good man\r\nhad to deal with leaders like Owen O’Neill, faithful, sensible, and\r\nunselfish, Ireland would have been an independent nation ere he returned\r\nto the Eternal City. His retirement placed O’Neill and the “Old Irish”\r\nin great perplexity as regarded a military policy. Ormond, the\r\ntreacherous, was, nominally at least, commander-in-chief of the royal\r\narmy, and his trusted lieutenants, Preston and Inchiquin, were O’Neill’s\r\nbitter foes.\r\n\r\nUnder such disadvantages, we are not surprised to learn that O’Neill\r\nadopted a policy of his own, at once bold and original. He temporized\r\nwith the Parliamentarians, and actually entered into a three months’\r\ntruce with General George Monck, who had succeeded to the unlucky\r\nMonroe’s command in the North. The distrust and hatred of Ormond, whose\r\nmilitary power waned immediately after his crushing defeat by General\r\nJones, already mentioned, were so great that both Galway and Limerick\r\nrefused to admit his garrisons. He and his wretched ally, Inchiquin,\r\nbecame utterly discredited with the Old Irish party, and soon fled the\r\nkingdom their infamies had cursed. Ormond returned to England after the\r\nRestoration and was one of Charles II’s intimates. It can hardly be\r\nwondered at, therefore, that, to use McGee’s language, “the singular\r\nspectacle was exhibited of Monck forwarding supplies to O’Neill to be\r\nused against Ormond and Inchiquin, and O’Neill coming to the rescue of\r\nCoote and raising for him the siege of Derry.” It was unfortunate that\r\nall of the Parliamentary generals were not possessed of the chivalric\r\nqualities of Monck and that hard fortune again compelled Owen Roe to\r\ndraw the sword for the cause of the ingrate Stuarts. As for the\r\nAnglo-Irish, whether of the Church of Rome or the Church of England,\r\nthey clung to the fortunes, or rather the misfortunes, of Charles II as\r\nfaithfully and vehemently as to those of his infatuated father. This was\r\nall the more noteworthy, as the younger Charles had even less to\r\nrecommend him to public estimation than his sire. He lived to be a\r\ndisgrace to even the throne of England, which has been filled too often\r\nby monarchs of degraded and dissolute character. The second Charles of\r\nEngland was destitute of every virtue, except physical courage. He had,\r\nin a high degree, that superficial good nature which distinguished his\r\nrace, but he was a libertine, an ingrate, and a despicable time-server.\r\nBut Ireland did not learn these truths about his character until long\r\nafter the period of his checkered career here dealt with. It must be\r\nborne in mind, however, that in the middle of the seventeenth century\r\nthe divinity which is alleged to hedge a king was much more apparent to\r\nthe masses of the people than it is in our own generation, when the\r\nmicroscopic eye of an educated public opinion is turned upon the throne\r\nand detects the slightest flaw, in the “fierce light” which beats upon\r\nit. The Old Irish party cared little for Charles, but when it came to a\r\nchoice between him and Cromwell, there was nothing left them but to\r\nthrow their swords into the scale for the youthful monarch, who was not\r\nnearly as “merry” then as he became in after days, when he quite forgot\r\nthe friends of his adversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n “The Curse of Cromwell”—Massacres of Drogheda and Wexford—Death of Sir\r\n                             Phelim O’Neill\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEIR adherence to the cause of the young Stuart brought upon the Irish\r\nnation the blighting “curse of Cromwell,” so terribly remembered down to\r\nthe present hour in every nook of Ireland visited by his formidable and\r\nremorseless legions. The English Parliament well knew that a general of\r\nthe first class was needed to crush the Irish army in field and fort,\r\nand so Oliver Cromwell, commander of the famous “Ironsides,” or\r\nParliamentary cuirassiers, the greatest and most relentless soldier of\r\nthat age, was sent to Ireland, commissioned to work his will upon her.\r\nHe landed in Dublin with an army of 4,000 cavalry and 9,000 infantry,\r\naugmented by the forces already in the island, on August 14, 1649.\r\nPlentifully supplied with money and military stores, he at once made\r\nready for a vigorous campaign. His second in command was General Ireton,\r\na son-in-law and pupil, who is remembered in Ireland only a degree less\r\nbitterly than the great regicide himself. The latter marched his\r\nformidable army, after a very brief rest, from Dublin to Drogheda, which\r\nwas held for Charles II by a garrison of about 3,000 men, burdened with\r\nmany helpless non-combatants, under the orders of Sir Arthur Aston, a\r\nbrave and experienced officer, who had suffered the loss of a leg in the\r\nContinental wars. He spurned Cromwell’s insolent summons to surrender,\r\nand successfully repulsed two furious assaults, led by the English\r\ngeneral in person. A third attack, made September 10, 1649, was\r\nsuccessful. General Aston fell, and the Puritan soldiers quarreled over\r\nhis artificial leg, which was said to be made of gold. Examination\r\nproved it to be of wood—a much less costly and tempting material. The\r\ngarrison, seeing their leader fall, laid down their arms, believing that\r\nquarter would be extended. But Cromwell, by his own admission (see his\r\nletters compiled by Thomas Carlyle), refused this accommodation, on the\r\nflimsy pretext that Drogheda did not, at once, surrender on summons; and\r\nthe Puritan army was let loose upon the doomed city. For five dreadful\r\ndays and nights there ensued a carnival of rapine and slaughter. The\r\naffrighted people fled to cellars, many sought refuge in churches, and\r\nsome climbed even to the belfries in the vain hope of escaping the\r\ngeneral massacre. But they were relentlessly pursued, sabred,\r\nsuffocated, or burned to death in the places in which they hoped to\r\nobtain shelter. The few miserable survivors—less than one hundred—were\r\nspared, only to be shipped as slaves to the Barbadoes. (See Cromwell’s\r\nLetters, per Carlyle.)\r\n\r\nCromwell, in his despatch to the speaker of the English Parliament,\r\ncalled this brutal achievement “an exceeding great mercy,” and,\r\nblasphemously, gave all the praise of the universal slaughter to the\r\nmost High God! There is absolutely no excuse for the regicide’s\r\noutrageous conduct at Drogheda, although Froude, Carlyle, and other\r\nBritish historians have vainly sought to make apology for his inhuman\r\nactions. Many of the garrison were English and Protestant, so that race\r\nand creed did not entirely influence him, as the same considerations\r\nundoubtedly did at other places in Ireland. His cold-blooded idea was to\r\n“strike terror” into Ireland at the outset of the campaign; and in this\r\nhe certainly succeeded only too well. It made his subsequent task of\r\nsubjugation much easier than it would, otherwise, have been. Having\r\naccomplished his work in the fated city, and left it a smoking ruin, he\r\ncounter-marched to Dublin, rested there for some days, and then marched\r\ntoward Wexford, capturing several small towns, which offered but feeble\r\nresistance, on his way. His lieutenants had, meanwhile, added Dundalk,\r\nCarlingford, and Newry to his conquests in the North. Wexford prepared\r\nfor a brave defence, but was basely betrayed by Captain James Stafford,\r\nan officer of English ancestry, who surrendered the outer defences,\r\nwithout the knowledge of his chief, Colonel David Sennott. Quarter was\r\nrefused, as at Drogheda, and three hundred maids and matrons, many of\r\nthe latter with infants in their arms, who fled to the market square,\r\nand took refuge, as they thought, under the sacred shadow of the\r\ngigantic cross which stood there, were butchered, notwithstanding their\r\npleadings for mercy. Nearly all of these people were Catholic in creed,\r\nif not all of Celtic race, so that Cromwell manifested what may be\r\ncalled an impartial spirit of cruelty on both bloody occasions. His\r\nhatred for the English Protestant royalists was as hot, to all\r\nappearance, as that which he entertained toward the Irish Catholics, who\r\nhad embraced the Stuart cause. But his remorseless policy of general\r\nconfiscation of the lands of the vanquished, and the sending into\r\nbanishment, as veritable slaves, of the unhappy survivors, have left a\r\ndeeper scar on the heart of Ireland than all the blood he so cruelly,\r\nand needlessly, shed on her soil.\r\n\r\nThe tidings from Drogheda and Wexford soon spread throughout the\r\ncountry, and the faint-hearted governors of many strong towns\r\nsurrendered without attempting to make an honorable defence. Kilkenny\r\nproved an exception. There a brave stand was made, and garrison and\r\ninhabitants received favorable terms of surrender. But Cromwell’s most\r\ndifficult task was in front of “rare Clonmel,” in Tipperary, which was\r\ngarrisoned by a few regiments of the aboriginal Ulster Irish—among the\r\nbravest men that ever trod a battlefield or manned a breach—under the\r\ncommand of Major-General Hugh Duff (Black) O’Neill, nephew and pupil of\r\nthe glorious Owen Roe. This brave and skilful officer repulsed, with\r\nmuch carnage, several of Cromwell’s fiercest assaults, and the siege\r\nwould, undoubtedly, have been raised only for failure of ammunition in\r\nthe Irish army. O’Neill, having satisfied himself that this was the\r\nunfortunate fact, evacuated the city on a dark midnight of May, 1649,\r\nand retreated to Limerick. Cromwell, ignorant of this movement, demanded\r\nthe surrender of Clonmel next morning. Favorable terms were requested\r\nand granted. There was no massacre, and Cromwell’s sardonic nature made\r\nhim rather enjoy the masterly trick played upon him by young O’Neill.\r\nSome years afterward, when the latter, after a most noble defence of\r\nLimerick, fell into the hands of Ireton and was condemned to death, we\r\nare informed that Cromwell, then virtually Lord Protector, caused his\r\nsentence to be commuted and allowed him to return to the Continent. Such\r\nis the effect true courage produces on even the most brutal natures.\r\n\r\nOwen Roe O’Neill, who, of all the Irish generals, was alone fitted, both\r\nby nature and experience, to combat the able Cromwell, died soon after\r\nthat tyrant’s arrival in Ireland, as some say by poison. He was on the\r\nmarch to attack the English army, when he surrendered to death at Clough\r\nOughter Castle, in Cavan, bitterly mourned by all who had dreamed of an\r\nindependent Ireland. How beautifully Thomas Davis laments him:\r\n\r\n     “We thought you would not die—we were sure you would not go,\r\n      And leave us in our utmost need to Cromwell’s cruel blow!\r\n      Sheep without a shepherd, when the snow shuts out the sky,\r\n      Oh, why did you leave us, Owen, why did you die?\r\n\r\n     “Soft as woman’s was your voice, O’Neill! bright was your eye,\r\n      O! why did you leave us, Owen? why did you die?\r\n      Your troubles are all over, you’re at rest with God on high;\r\n      But we’re slaves and we’re orphans, Owen! why did you die?”\r\n\r\nImmediately after the capitulation of Clonmel, Cromwell, summoned by\r\nParliament to operate against the royalists of Scotland, set sail for\r\nEngland, leaving behind him Ireton and Ludlow to continue his bloody\r\nwork. By Oliver’s direction, confiscation followed confiscation, and,\r\nwhen he became Protector of the English Commonwealth, many thousands of\r\ninnocent boys and girls were shipped from Ireland to the West Indies and\r\nother colonies of England, where most of them perished miserably. Ireton\r\ndied in Limerick, which yielded to his arms, after a desperate\r\nresistance, in 1651. Tradition says that he rotted from the plague, and\r\nthat his last hours were horrible to himself and to all who surrounded\r\nhis repulsive deathbed. He had caused to be killed in the city a bishop,\r\nmany priests, and a multitude of other non-combatants; and these\r\natrocities appalled his craven soul at the moment of dissolution.\r\nLudlow, an equally ferocious soldier, concluded the work of conquest in\r\nIreland, and, in 1652, the whole island was again rendered “tranquil.”\r\n“Order reigned in Warsaw,” but it was not the order that succeeds\r\ndissolution. Ireland, as subsequent events proved, was not dead, but\r\nsleeping. The close of “the great rebellion,” which had lasted eleven\r\nyears, was signalized by the ruthless executions of Bishop Heber\r\nMacMahon—the warrior prelate who led Owen Roe’s army after that hero’s\r\ndeath—and Sir Phelim O’Neill, who was offered his life on the steps of\r\nthe scaffold, if he consented to implicate the late King Charles I in\r\nthe promotion of the Irish revolt. This, the English historians inform\r\nus, he “stoutly refused to do,” and died, in consequence, like a soldier\r\nand a gentleman. He had his faults—this fierce Sir Phelim. He was by no\r\nmeans a saint, or even an exemplary Christian—but he acted, “according\r\nto his lights,” for the best interests of his native country, and lost\r\neverything, including life, in striving to make her free. A gifted Irish\r\npoet (T. D. McGee) sings of him as “In Felix Felix,” thus:\r\n\r\n            “He rose the first—he looms the morning star\r\n             Of that long, glorious unsuccessful war;\r\n             England abhors him! has she not abhorr’d\r\n             All who for Ireland ventured life or word?\r\n             What memory would she not have cast away\r\n             That Ireland keeps in her heart’s heart to-day?\r\n\r\n            “If even his hand and hilt were so distained,\r\n             If he was guilty as he has been blamed,\r\n             His death redeemed his life—he chose to die\r\n             Rather than get his freedom with a lie.\r\n             Plant o’er his gallant heart a laurel tree,\r\n             So may his head within the shadow be!\r\n\r\n            “I mourn for thee, O hero of the North—\r\n             God judge thee gentler than we do on earth!\r\n             I mourn for thee and for our land, because\r\n             She dare not own the martyrs in her cause;\r\n             But they, our poets, they who justify—\r\n             They will not let thy memory rot or die!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n Sad Fate of the Vanquished—Cruel Executions and Wholesale Confiscations\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE subsequent fate of other chief actors in this great political and\r\nmilitary drama is summed up by a learned historian thus: “Mountgarret\r\nand Bishop Rothe died before Galway (the last Irish stronghold of this\r\nwar) fell. Bishop MacMahon, of Clogher, surrendered to Sir Charles\r\nCoote, and was executed like a felon by one he had saved from\r\ndestruction a year before at Derry. Coote, after the Restoration, became\r\nEarl of Mountrath, and Broghill, Earl of Orrery. Clanricarde died\r\nunnoticed on his English estate, under the Protectorate. Inchiquin,\r\nafter many adventures in foreign lands, turned Catholic in his old age;\r\nand this burner of churches bequeathed an annual alms for masses for his\r\nsoul. A Roman patrician did the honors of sepulture for Father Luke\r\nWadding. Hugh Duff O’Neill, the heroic defender of Clonmel and Limerick,\r\nand the gallant though vacillating Preston, were cordially received in\r\nFrance, while the consistent (English) Republican, General Ludlow, took\r\nrefuge as a fugitive (after the Restoration) in Switzerland.”\r\n\r\nThe same accomplished authority (T. D. McGee) informs us that under\r\nOliver Cromwell’s Protectorate, “A new survey of the whole island was\r\nordered, under the direction of Sir William Petty, the fortunate\r\neconomist who founded the House of Lansdowne. By him the surface of the\r\nkingdom was estimated at ten and a half million plantation acres, three\r\nmillions of which were deducted for waste and water. Of the remainder,\r\nabove 5,000,000 acres were in Catholic hands in 1641; 300,000 acres were\r\ncollege lands, and 2,000,000 acres were in possession of the Protestant\r\nsettlers of the reigns of James I and Elizabeth. Under the Cromwellian\r\nProtectorate, 5,000,000 acres were confiscated. This enormous spoil,\r\ntwo-thirds of the whole island (as then computed), went to the soldiers\r\nand adventurers who had served against the Irish or had contributed to\r\nthe military chest since 1641—except 700,000 acres given in ‘exchange’\r\nto the banished in Clare and Connaught, and 1,200,000 confirmed to\r\n‘innocent Papists’ who had taken no part in the warfare for their\r\ncountry’s liberty. And,” continues our authority already quoted,\r\n“Cromwell anticipated the union of the kingdoms by a hundred and fifty\r\nyears, when he summoned, in 1653, that assembly over which ‘Praise-God\r\nBare-bones’ presided. Members for Ireland and Scotland sat on the same\r\nbenches with the Commons of England. Oliver’s first deputy in the\r\ngovernment of Ireland was his son-in-law, Fleetwood, who had married the\r\nwidow of Ireton, but his real representative was his fourth son, Henry\r\nCromwell, commander-in-chief of the army. In 1657, the title of Lord\r\nDeputy was transferred from Fleetwood to Henry, who united the supreme\r\ncivil and military authority in his own person, until the eve of the\r\nRestoration, of which he became an active partisan. We may thus embrace\r\nthe five years of the Protectorate as the period of Henry Cromwell’s\r\nadministration.” High Courts of Justice were appointed for dealing with\r\nthose who had been actively in arms, and many cruel executions resulted.\r\nCommissions were also appointed for the expatriation of the people,\r\nparticularly the young. “Children under age, of both sexes, were\r\ncaptured by the thousands, and sold as slaves to the tobacco planters of\r\nVirginia and the West Indies. Secretary Thurloe informs Henry Cromwell\r\nthat ‘the Council have authorized 1,000 girls, and as many youths, to be\r\ntaken up for that purpose.’ Sir William Petty mentions 6,000 Irish boys\r\nand girls shipped to the West Indies. Some contemporary accounts make\r\nthe total number of children and adults, so transported, 100,000 souls.\r\nTo this decimation we may add 34,000 men of fighting age, who had\r\npermission to enter the armies of foreign powers at peace with the\r\nCommonwealth.”\r\n\r\nAs there was no Irish Parliament called under Cromwell’s régime, the\r\n“government” of Ireland consisted, during that period, of the deputy,\r\nthe commander-in-chief, and four commissioners—the Puritan leaders,\r\nLudlow, Corbett, Jones, and Weaver—all of whom looked upon the\r\nCeltic-Catholic Irish, and, in fact, all classes of the Irish people,\r\nwith bigoted hatred and insolent disdain. And these men had, until the\r\nRestoration, absolute dominion over the lives and liberty, the rights\r\nand properties of the nation they hated!\r\n\r\nThe Act of Uniformity, which played such a terrible part in the reigns\r\nof Elizabeth and James, was put into relentless force. The Catholics\r\nwere crushed, as it were, into the earth, and Ireland again became a\r\nveritable counterpart of the infernal regions. Priests, of all ranks,\r\nwere hunted like wild beasts, and many fell victims to their heroic\r\ndevotion to their flocks. Catholic lawyers were rigidly disbarred and\r\nCatholic school-teachers were subjected to deadly penalties. “Three\r\nbishops and three hundred ecclesiastics” perished violently during the\r\nProtectorate. “Under the superintendence of the commissioners,” says\r\nMcGee, “the distribution made of the soil among the Puritans ‘was nearly\r\nas complete as that of Canaan by the Israelites.’ Such Irish gentlemen\r\nas had obtained pardons were obliged to wear a distinctive mark on their\r\ndress under pain of death. Those of inferior rank were obliged to wear a\r\nround black spot on the right cheek, under pain of the branding iron and\r\nthe gallows. If a Puritan lost his life in any district inhabited by\r\nCatholics, the whole population were held subject to military execution.\r\nFor the rest, whenever ‘Tory’ (nickname for an Irish royalist) or\r\nrecusant fell into the hands of these military colonists, or the\r\ngarrisons which knitted them together, they were assailed with the\r\nwar-cry of the Jews—‘That thy feet may be dipped in the blood of thy\r\nenemies, and that the tongues of thy dogs may be red with the same.’\r\nThus, penned in (according to the Cromwellian penal regulation) between\r\n‘the mile line’ of the Shannon and the ‘four-mile line’ of the sea, the\r\nremnant of the Irish nation passed seven years of a bondage unequaled in\r\nseverity by anything which can be found in the annals of Christendom.”\r\n\r\nWhen the news of Oliver Cromwell’s death, which occurred on September 3,\r\n1658, reached Ireland, a sigh of intense relief was heaved by the\r\npersecuted nation. Many a prayer of thankfulness went up to the throne\r\nof God from outraged Irish fathers and mothers, whose children were\r\nsweltering as slaves under tropical suns. Cromwell himself had passed\r\naway, but the “curse of Cromwell” remained with Ireland for many a black\r\nand bitter day thereafter.\r\n\r\nWhat followed after his death until the Restoration belongs to English\r\nhistory. Under his son Richard, and his associates, or advisers, the\r\nProtectorate proved a failure. Then followed the negotiations with\r\nGeneral Monck, and the restoration of the monarchy under Charles II, who\r\nlanded on English soil, at Dover, May 22, 1660, proceeded to London,\r\nwhere he was cordially welcomed, and renewed his interrupted reign over\r\na country which, at heart, despised and distrusted him and all of his\r\nfated house.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n     Ireland Further Scourged Under Charles II—Murder of Archbishop\r\n                     Plunket—Accession of James II\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Irish Catholics had built high hopes on the restoration of Charles,\r\nbut were not very jubilant when they learned that he had appointed as\r\nLords Justices, in Dublin, their ancient foes and persecutors, Coote and\r\nBroghill, the latter now called the Earl of Orrery. In the Irish\r\n(provincial) Parliament, the “Undertaking” element was in the ascendant,\r\nand the Protestants, barely one-fifth of the nation, had, in the House\r\nof Lords, 72 peers of their faith to 21 Catholics. In the Commons the\r\nsame disparity existed, there being 198 Protestant to 64 Catholic\r\nmembers. In England, the defenders of the crown, who had fought against\r\nCromwell, were, in most cases, treated with justice, and many had their\r\npossessions restored to them. In Ireland, the Royalists, of all creeds\r\nand classes, were treated by the king and his advisers with shameful\r\ningratitude. Most of the confiscations of the Cromwell period were\r\nconfirmed, but the Catholic religion was tolerated, to a certain extent,\r\nand the lives of priests and schoolmasters were not placed in jeopardy\r\nas much as formerly. The Catholics made a good fight for the restoration\r\nof their property, and were faithfully aided by the Earl of Kildare in\r\nIreland and by Colonel Richard Talbot—afterward Earl of Tyrconnel—in\r\nEngland. But the Cromwellian settlers maintained the advantage in\r\nproperty they had gained. In 1775, they still held 4,500,000 acres\r\nagainst 2,250,000 acres held by the original proprietors. The figures,\r\naccording to the most reliable authorities, were almost exactly the\r\nreverse before the Cromwellian settlement. An attempt on the part of the\r\nCatholics, to be allowed greater privileges than they possessed, was met\r\nin a most unfriendly spirit in England. One of their delegates, Sir\r\nNicholas Plunkett, was mobbed by the Londoners and forbidden the royal\r\npresence by the order of the Council, while Colonel Talbot, because of\r\nhis bold championship of the Catholic cause, was sent for a period to\r\nthe Tower. The Irish Catholics were, finally, forbidden to make any\r\nfurther address in opposition to the Bill of Settlement—as the act\r\nconfirming the confiscations was called—and the perfidious Charles\r\nsigned it without compunction, although he well knew he was beggaring\r\nhis own and his father’s friends. An English tribunal, appointed to sit\r\nin Dublin and hear the Irish claims, declared in favor of the plundered\r\nnative proprietors, but as it was met immediately by the intrigues of\r\nthe ruthless Ormond, who again became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the\r\nduration of this honest English tribunal was limited to a certain day,\r\nwhen only about 800 out of 3,000 cases had been heard. A measure called\r\n“An Act of Explanation” was then passed (1665), by which it was decreed\r\nthat “no Papist who had not been adjudged innocent under the former act\r\ncould be so adjudged thereafter, or entitled to claim any lands or\r\nsettlements.” “Thus,” remarks a historian, “even the inheritance of\r\nhope, and the reversion of expectation, were extinguished forever for\r\nthe sons and daughters of the ancient gentry of the kingdom.”\r\n\r\nAn attempt made by the titled Catholic laity and the prelates and\r\npriests of that faith to establish their true position in regard to\r\ntheir spiritual and secular allegiance was also met in a hostile manner\r\nby Ormond, who so managed as to excite a bitter controversy in regard to\r\na document called “The Remonstrance,” which was supposed to embody the\r\nCatholic idea of the period. The viceroy succeeded to the top of his\r\nbent. Dissension prevailed at a meeting of the surviving prelates of the\r\nChurch, and the superiors of regular orders, held in Dublin, and Ormond\r\nmade the failure of the gathering an excuse for persecuting the prelates\r\nand priests, whom he bitterly hated as a body he could not use, with\r\npenal severities, which the selfish and sensual king, who was himself a\r\nCatholic in secret, allowed to pass without interference.\r\n\r\nIn this same year (1666) the importation of Irish cattle into England\r\nwas declared, by Parliamentary enactment, “a nuisance,” for the reason\r\nthat when the Londoners were starving, at the time of the Great Fire,\r\nIreland contributed for their relief 15,000 fat steers. Instead of being\r\ngrateful for the generous gift, the English lawmakers pretended to\r\nbelieve it a scheme to preserve the trade in cattle between the two\r\nkingdoms. The Navigation Act—invented by Cromwell—which put fetters on\r\nIrish commerce, was also enforced, and these two grievances united, for\r\na time, the Puritans and the Old Irish, as both suffered equally from\r\nthe restrictions placed upon industry. Ormond showed favor to the\r\ndiscontented Puritans, and was recalled in consequence. His retirement\r\nlasted nine years, and during that period he became a patron of Irish\r\nmanufactures, especially in the county of Kilkenny. A bogus “Popish\r\nplot”—an offshoot of that manufactured in England, during this reign, by\r\nthat arch-impostor and perjurer, Titus Oates—was trumped up in Ireland\r\nfor purposes of religious and political terrorism. The attempt to fasten\r\nit upon the masses of the people happily failed, but, without even the\r\nshadow of proof, the aged and venerated archbishop of Armagh, Oliver\r\nPlunkett, was accused of complicity in it, arrested and confined,\r\nwithout form of trial, for ten months in an Irish prison. Finally he was\r\nremoved to London and placed on trial. One of his “judges” was the\r\nnotorious Jeffreys—the English Norbury—a man destitute of a heart. Even\r\none of the paid perjurers, called a crown agent, stung by remorse,\r\noffered to testify in behalf of the unfortunate archbishop. All was in\r\nvain, however. The judges charged the jury against the accused,\r\nviolating every legal form, and the hapless prelate was found guilty. He\r\nwas sentenced to be “hanged, drawn, and quartered” on July 1, 1681. This\r\nsentence was carried out in all its brutal details. When the Earl of\r\nEssex appealed to the king to save the illustrious martyr, Charles\r\nreplied: “I can not pardon him, because I dare not. His blood be upon\r\nyour conscience. You could have saved him if you pleased!” And this\r\ncraven king, a few years afterward, on his deathbed, called for the\r\nministrations of a priest of the Church outraged by the murder of an\r\ninnocent prelate! The slaughter of Oliver Plunkett was the most\r\natrocious political assassination in English history, which reeks with\r\nsuch crimes. The shooting of Duc d’Enghien by Napoleon did not approach\r\nit in cold-blooded infamy. The king, the minister, the court, the\r\njury—everybody—believed the archbishop innocent, and yet he was\r\nsacrificed that his blood might satisfy the rampant bigotry of the\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe Catholics were ferociously pursued in Ireland after this shameful\r\ntragedy. Proclamations were issued against them by Ormond, who had yet\r\nagain become Lord Lieutenant. They were forbidden to enter fortresses or\r\nto hold fairs, markets, or gatherings within the walls of corporate\r\ntowns. They were also forbidden the use of arms—an old English expedient\r\nin Ireland—and they were commanded to kill or capture any “Tory” or\r\n“outlaw” relative within fourteen days from the date of proclamation,\r\nunder penalty of being arrested and banished from Ireland. This was the\r\nsetting of brother against brother with a vengeance. Few of the Irish\r\npeople were found base enough to comply with the unnatural order, but\r\nCount Redmond O’Hanlon, one of the few Irish chiefs of ancient family\r\nwho still held out against English penal law in Ireland, was\r\nassassinated in a cowardly manner by one of Ormond’s ruthless tools. The\r\nblood stains from the heart of the brave O’Hanlon will sully forever the\r\nescutcheon of the Irish Butlers.\r\n\r\nJust as the spirit of persecution of Catholics began to subside both in\r\nEngland and Ireland, Charles II, who had been much worried by the\r\npolitical contentions in his English kingdom, which resulted in the\r\nbanishment of Monmouth and the execution of Lord William Russell and\r\nAlgernon Sidney, had a stroke of apoplexy, which resulted in his death\r\non February 6, 1685. In his last moments he was attended by the Rev.\r\nFather Huddlestone, who received him into the Catholic Church, which he\r\nhad betrayed so foully. He was immediately succeeded by his Catholic\r\nbrother, the Duke of York, who ascended the throne under the title of\r\nJames II. James was a man of resolute purpose, good intentions, no\r\ndoubt, but had a narrow intellect and sadly lacked discretion—at least\r\nin the moral sense. His physical courage has been questioned, although\r\nthe famous Marshal Turenne certified to it, when he, in his fiery youth,\r\nserved in the French armies. He was destined, as we shall see, to ruin\r\nhis friends, exalt his enemies, and wreck the ancient Stuart dynasty.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n Well-Meant but Imprudent Policy of King James—England Invites William of\r\n                       Orange to Assume the Throne\r\n\r\n\r\nALTHOUGH the final outcome of his policy was disastrous to Ireland, we\r\nfeel justified in saying that James II meant well by all his subjects.\r\nHe was a friend of religious equality—an idea hateful to the English and\r\na large portion of the Scottish nation at that period. In Ireland, too,\r\nthe Protestant minority resented it, because, to their minds, it meant\r\nCatholic ascendency and the restoration of stolen estates. But James\r\nwent about his reforms so awkwardly, and imprudently, that he brought on\r\nhimself almost immediately the all but unanimous ill-will of his English\r\nsubjects. He dared to profess his Catholic faith openly—an unforgivable\r\noffence in England at that time. He sought to equalize the holding of\r\noffice by the abolition of the Test Act, aimed against Catholics, so\r\nthat English, Scotch, and Irish Catholics should have the same rights\r\nand privileges in that respect as their Protestant brethren. This, also,\r\nwas an idea hateful to the English mind of the period. The king\r\nundertook to regulate the judiciary, the privy council, the army, the\r\ncivil list—every public appointment—according to his own notions. This\r\nmeant recognition of the Catholics and produced an uproar in England. He\r\nrecalled Ormond from the viceroyalty of Ireland and sent Lord Clarendon\r\nto take his place. Finally, Clarendon resigned and Richard Talbot, who\r\nhad been created Duke of Tyrconnel, was made Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.\r\nThis appointment alarmed the Irish Protestants, who, as usual, feared\r\nthat the Catholics would get back their lands under a friendly\r\nexecutive, such as Tyrconnel—whose former exertions in regard to the\r\nCatholic claims were not forgotten—was well known to be. He was\r\ninjudicious enough, at the outset, to dismiss many Protestant officers\r\nfrom the Irish military establishment and place Catholics in their\r\npositions. Although this was done by proportion, Protestant jealousy was\r\naroused and the seeds of revolt were deeply planted.\r\n\r\nIn England, popular feeling against the king was at fever heat. His\r\nillegitimate Protestant nephew—putative son of Charles II—the Duke of\r\nMonmouth, who had been exiled, returned to England and organized a\r\nrebellion against him. This ill-starred movement culminated at\r\nSedgemoor, in Somersetshire, in the summer of 1685. A battle was fought\r\nthere between the unorganized English peasants, under “King Monmouth,”\r\nas they called him, and the royal army, under the Earl of Feversham. The\r\nrebels fought with commendable courage, but were badly commanded and\r\nsuffered an overwhelming defeat. Monmouth escaped from the field, but\r\nwas captured soon afterward, tried, found guilty, and beheaded on Tower\r\nHill, of bloody memory, July 15, 1685. He had appealed in vain to James\r\nfor mercy, and appealed in a manner so craven and undignified that he\r\naroused the disgust of his stern uncle. But the blood of the vanquished\r\ndid not cease to flow when Monmouth died. The “Bloody Assizes,”\r\nconducted by Jeffreys, the “great crimson toad,” as Dickens describes\r\nhim, and four assistant judges, spread death and terror throughout the\r\nEnglish districts recently in revolt. This period of English history\r\nbore a striking resemblance to the 1798 period in Ireland, when other\r\n“great crimson toads” hanged the hapless peasantry, and some of higher\r\nrank, by the hundred and thousand. All this butchery made James\r\nunpopular with a vast majority of the English people, but, as he had no\r\nmale heir, the nation hesitated to rise against him, especially as\r\nMonmouth himself had been the aggressor. But James, while Duke of York,\r\nhad married a young wife, the Princess Mary, sister of the Duke of\r\nModena, who bore him a son—afterward called by the Hanoverian faction\r\nthe Pretender—in June, 1688. This altered the whole aspect of affairs\r\nand a revolution became imminent immediately. Mary of Modena, although\r\nan intelligent and amiable woman, was of a haughty and somewhat\r\npunctilious disposition at times. This made her almost as unpopular with\r\nthe English people as was her husband. Sir Walter Scott relates that,\r\nwhile Duchess of York, she accompanied her husband to Scotland, whither\r\nhe went at the behest of his brother, King Charles. James got along very\r\nwell with the Scotch, particularly the Highlanders, who adored him, and\r\nwhose loyalty to his family remained unshaken until after Culloden. He\r\ninvited an old Continental veteran, Sir Thomas Dalzell, to dine with\r\nhim. The duchess had the bad taste to object to the company of a\r\ncommoner. “Make yourself easy on that head, madam,” remarked Sir Thomas;\r\n“I have sat at a table where your father might have stood behind my\r\nchair!” He alluded to a dinner given him and others by the Emperor of\r\nAustria, who was the suzerain of the Duke of Modena. The latter, if\r\ncalled upon by the emperor, would have had to act in the capacity of an\r\nhonorary waiter. All students of history are, doubtless, familiar with\r\nthe romantic chivalry displayed by Edward the Black Prince, when he\r\nwaited upon his captive, King John of France, whom he had vanquished at\r\nPoitiers. Mary of Modena was, we may be sure, not formed by nature to\r\nmake friends for her husband, as the brave Margaret of Anjou did for the\r\nphysically and mentally degenerate Plantagenet, Henry VI. Had Mary been\r\na Margaret, William of Orange might never have occupied the throne of\r\n“the Three Kingdoms.” The climax of King James’s political\r\nimprudences—they can not, in the light of modern ideas of religious\r\nequality, be called errors—was reached when he issued his famous\r\ndeclaration against test oaths and penal laws, and decreed that it\r\nshould be read from the altars of the Protestant, as well as the\r\nCatholic, churches throughout England. Six Protestant prelates, headed\r\nby the Archbishop of Canterbury, made protest by petition and even\r\nvisited the king in his bedchamber to dissuade him from his purpose. But\r\nhe persisted, as was usual with him.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday following the bishops’ call, out of 10,000 English\r\nclergymen only 200 complied with the royal decree. Of course we,\r\nAmericans, who have equal laws for all creeds and classes, can not\r\nconsistently condemn King James for advocating what we ourselves\r\npractice, but we can afford to lament the fatuity which led him to dare\r\nProtestant resentment by seeking to make Protestant pulpits the mediums\r\nof his radical policy. It was playing with fire. Had he stopped short at\r\nthis point, James might have still held his crown, but, with incurable\r\nobstinacy, he insisted on prosecuting the recalcitrant bishops before\r\nthe Court of King’s Bench, and they were finally committed by the Privy\r\nCouncil to the Tower of London. All England was now ablaze with fierce\r\nresentment. At the Tower the right reverend prisoners were treated more\r\nlike royal personages than captives. The officers and soldiers of the\r\narmy—excepting the Irish regiments raised by Tyrconnel for James, and\r\nsent to do garrison duty in England—openly drank to their speedy\r\nrelease. When they came to trial in the King’s Bench, the jury, after\r\nbeing out on the case all night, found the six prelates not guilty on\r\nthe charge of censuring the king’s government and defying the king’s\r\nmandate, and they were immediately released amid popular acclamation.\r\n\r\nThe “loyal” Protestant majority had succeeded in placing the Catholic\r\nminority, their own fellow-countrymen, in a position of political\r\nnonentity, simply because they worshiped God according to their belief.\r\nWho could, then, have imagined that the England which refused equality\r\nin the holding of office to Catholic subjects would, about two hundred\r\nyears later, have a Catholic for Lord Chief Justice and an Irish\r\nCatholic (Lord Russell of Killowen) at that? Five generations have done\r\nmuch toward a change of sentiment in England. But King James, we are\r\ntold, on hearing the shouts of the people when the acquittal was\r\nannounced, asked of Lord Feversham, who happened to be with him: “What\r\ndo they shout for?” And Feversham replied, carelessly: “Oh, nothing—only\r\nthe acquittal of the bishops!” “And you call that nothing?” cried the\r\nking. “So much the worse for them,” meaning the people. These latter\r\nwere excited by the Protestant lords and gentry, who much feared a\r\nCatholic succession, now that the king had an heir-male to the throne.\r\nBoth of his daughters—Mary, married to William, Prince of Orange, the\r\nking’s nephew, and Anne, who became the wife of the Prince of\r\nDenmark—were Protestants, their mother having brought them up in that\r\nbelief. William, half a Stuart and half a Dutchman, brave, resolute, and\r\nwise withal, seemed to the English malcontents to be the\r\n“heaven-appointed” man to supplant his own uncle and father-in-law.\r\nWilliam was nothing loth, and Mary, who was to share the throne with\r\nhim, made no objection to this most unfilial proceeding. Neither did\r\nAnne, who, like the unnatural creature she was, fled from her father’s\r\npalace, guided and guarded by the Protestant Bishop of London, as soon\r\nas she heard of William’s almost unobstructed march on the capital. That\r\npersonage had landed at Torbay, in Devonshire, on November 5—the\r\nanniversary of the Gunpowder Plot of the days of James I—convoyed by an\r\nimmense fleet, which carried to the shores of England a picked veteran\r\narmy of 15,000 men. This army was commanded, under William, by the\r\nMarshal Duke of Schomberg, Count Solmes, General De Ginkel, and other\r\nofficers of European renown. The principal plotters who invited William\r\nto seize the crown of England were the Earls of Danby, Shrewsbury,\r\nDevonshire, the Bishop of London, Lord Lumley, Admiral Russell, and\r\nColonel Sidney. Just a little while before the coming of William, James\r\ntook the alarm and attempted to make concessions to the Protestants. He\r\nalso decreed the strengthening of the army, and the enlistment of Irish\r\nCatholics and Scotch Highlanders, most of whom had retained the old\r\nfaith, was encouraged.\r\n\r\nAt the news of William’s arrival in Exeter, whither he had marched from\r\nTorbay, the English aristocracy became wildly excited and hastened to\r\njoin his standard. The faculty of the University of Oxford sent him word\r\nthat, if he needed money to carry out his enterprise, the plate of that\r\ninstitution would be melted down to furnish him with a revenue. An\r\nagreement of the nobility and gentry was drawn up and signed, and in it\r\nthey promised to stand by William of Orange and each other, “in defence\r\nof the laws and liberties of the three kingdoms and the Protestant\r\nreligion.” Thus, it will be noticed, Protestant interests was the cry of\r\nthe majority in England, opposed to James, who, as we have said, aimed\r\nat equality of all creeds before the law, while in Ireland, where the\r\nold faith “prevailed mightily,” Catholic interests, or civil and\r\nreligious liberty, became, also, the war-cry of the majority. In England\r\nthe Catholic minority remained mostly supine during this period and\r\nuntil long afterward. In Scotland the Catholics and many Episcopalians\r\nrallied for James under the leadership of the implacable and brilliant\r\nClaverhouse, afterward created Viscount Dundee. They took the field for\r\n“James VII of Scotland,” as they called the exiled king, at the first\r\ntap of the war drum. The Catholic majority in Ireland naturally\r\nrecognized in the unfortunate monarch a friend who offered them\r\nreligious and political liberty, and so they resolved to place their\r\n“lives, fortunes, and sacred honor” at his disposal.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Catholics can not be justly blamed for their devotion to the\r\ncause of James, who, whatever his motives, was the first King of England\r\nwho ever attempted to do them even ordinary justice. Tyrconnel, like\r\nStrafford in a preceding reign, although with a very different\r\nintention, began the organization of a formidable Irish army, which was\r\ndesigned to be composed of twenty regiments of horse, fifty of foot, and\r\nartillery in the usual proportion. There were men for the mere asking,\r\nbut arms, ammunition, and equipments were sadly lacking. The weakest arm\r\nof the military branch of the public service was the artillery, and this\r\ncontinued to be the fact throughout all of the subsequent war. As\r\nWilliam drew nearer to London, the bulk of the native English army,\r\nfollowing the example of the highest officers—including Colonel John\r\nChurchill, afterward the great Duke of Marlborough—went over to him.\r\nThis determined James to abandon his capital, yet his friends induced\r\nhim to return for a period. But the still nearer approach of “the\r\nDeliverer,” as the English called William of Orange, again induced him\r\nto fly from London. He had previously provided for the safety of the\r\nqueen and the infant heir to the now forfeited crown, who had taken\r\nrefuge in France. The date of his final departure from Whitehall Palace\r\nwas December 11. After not a few perilous adventures, he reached the\r\ncourt of his cousin, Louis XIV, at Versailles, on Christmas Day, 1688.\r\nHe was most honorably and hospitably received, and Louis placed at his\r\ndisposal the royal palace of St. Germain, in the neighborhood of Paris.\r\nWhen James heard of the desertion of his youngest daughter, Anne, to his\r\nenemies, the wretched parent, who has been called “the modern Lear,”\r\nexclaimed in the anguish of his soul: “God help me! My very children\r\nhave deserted me!”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n  Irish Soldiers Ill-Treated in England—Policy of Tyrconnel—King James\r\n                       Chosen by the Irish Nation\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCH Irish soldiers as had remained in England after the flight of James\r\nwere mobbed, insulted, and even murdered by the unthinking multitude, so\r\neasily excited to deeds of cruelty. These men had done the English\r\npeople no wrong—they had shed no English blood, and they even wore the\r\nEnglish uniform. Many fell in savage combats with the furious mobs, but\r\nthe majority fought their way to the seaports, where they, by some\r\nmeans, obtained shipment to Ireland, carrying with them many a bitter\r\nmemory of England and her people. Many of these persecuted troops were\r\nwell-trained cavalry, who afterward manifested splendid prowess at the\r\nBoyne and in other engagements. Their colonels were all members of the\r\nancient Irish nobility, Celtic or Norman, and they were quite incapable\r\nof the crimes the credulous English mobs were taught to believe they\r\nwere ready to commit at the earliest opportunity. Although the English\r\npeople, in their normal condition, are a steady and courageous race,\r\nthey are, when unduly excited, capable of entertaining sentiments and\r\nperforming acts discreditable to them as a nation. A people so ready to\r\nresent any imposition, real or fancied, on themselves, should be a\r\nlittle less quick to punish others for following their example. It is\r\nnot too much to say that the English, as a majority, have been made the\r\nvictims of more religious and political hoaxes—imposed upon them by\r\nevil-minded knaves—than any other civilized nation. It was of the\r\nEnglish, rather than ourselves, the great American showman, Barnum,\r\nshould have said: “These people love to be humbugged!”\r\n\r\nFrom the French court, which entirely sympathized with him, James\r\nentered into correspondence with his faithful subject and friend,\r\nTyrconnel, in Ireland. The viceroy sent him comforting intelligence, for\r\nall the Catholics of fighting age were willing to bear arms in his\r\ndefence. James sent Tyrconnel about 10,000 good muskets, with the\r\nrequisite ammunition, to be used by the new levies. These were obtained\r\nfrom the bounty of the King of France. As Tyrconnel was convinced that\r\nIreland, of herself, could hardly make headway against William of\r\nOrange, backed as he was by most of Great Britain and half of Europe, he\r\nconceived the idea of placing her, temporarily at least, under a French\r\nprotectorate, in the shape of an alliance defensive and offensive, if\r\nnecessary. He had the tact to keep King James in ignorance of this\r\nagreement, because he did not wish him to jeopardize his chance of\r\nregaining the British crown, which a consenting to the French\r\nprotectorate would have utterly forfeited. Tyrconnel’s policy, under the\r\ncircumstances in which Ireland was placed, may have been a wise one,\r\nalthough, in general, any dependency of one country upon another is\r\nfatal to the liberty of the dependent nation. Ireland, contrary to\r\ngeneral belief, is large enough to stand alone, if she had control of\r\nher own resources. To illustrate briefly, she is within a few thousand\r\nsquare miles of being as large as Portugal, and is much more fertile;\r\nwhile she is almost a third greater in area than Holland and Belgium\r\ncombined. Her extensive coast line, numerous safe harbors, and exceeding\r\nproductiveness amply compensate for the comparative smallness of her\r\narea.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1689, the national conventions of England and Scotland, by\r\nvast majorities, declared that King James had abdicated and offered the\r\ncrown to William and Mary, who, as might have been expected, accepted it\r\nwith thanks. Ireland had nothing to say in the matter, except by the\r\nvoices of a few malcontents who had fled to Britain. Nevertheless, the\r\nnew sovereigns finally assumed the rather illogical title of “William\r\nand Mary, ‘by the grace of God,’ King and Queen of England, Scotland,\r\nFrance, and Ireland.” In France they held not a foot of ground; and in\r\nIreland four-fifths of the people acknowledged King James. James Graham,\r\nof Claverhouse (Viscount Dundee), expressed his dissent from the\r\nmajority in the convention of Scotland. Sir Walter Scott has\r\nimmortalized the event in the stirring lyric which begins thus:\r\n\r\n     “To the Lords of Convention ‘twas Claverhouse spoke,\r\n     ’Ere the king’s crown shall fall, there are crowns to be broke,\r\n      So let each cavalier, who loves honor and me,\r\n      Come follow the bonnet of Bonnie Dundee!”\r\n\r\nJames had some strong partisans in England also—mostly among the Roman\r\nCatholic and Episcopalian High Church elements, but they were powerless\r\nto stem the overwhelming tide of public opinion against him. Ireland was\r\nwith him vehemently, except the small Protestant minority, chiefly\r\nresident in Ulster, which was enthusiastic for William and Mary.\r\nRepresentatives of this active element had closed the gates of Derry in\r\nthe face of the Earl of Antrim, when he demanded the town’s surrender,\r\nin the name of the deposed king, in December, 1688. This incident proved\r\nthat the Irish Protestants, with the usual rule-proving exceptions,\r\nmeant “war to the knife” against the Catholic Stuart dynasty. Thus civil\r\nwar, intensified by foreign intervention, became inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe towns of Inniskillen, Sligo, Coleraine, and the fort of Culmore, on\r\nthe Foyle, either followed the example of Derry, or were seized without\r\nceremony by the partisans of William and Mary in Ulster and Connaught.\r\nThese partisans, headed by Lord Blaney, Sir Arthur Rawdon, and other\r\nAnglo-Irishmen, invited William to come into the country, “for the\r\nmaintenance of the Protestant religion and the dependency of Ireland\r\nupon England.” Thus, again, was the Protestant religion made the pretext\r\nof provincializing Ireland, and because of this identification of it\r\nwith British supremacy the new creed has remained undeniably unpopular\r\nwith the masses of the Irish people. The latter are very ardent\r\nCatholics, as their long and bloody wars in defence of their faith have\r\namply proven, but while this statement is undeniable, it can not be\r\ndenied either that had the so-called Reformation not been identified\r\nwith English political supremacy, it might have made much greater\r\ninroads among the Irish population than it has succeeded in doing.\r\nIreland was treated not a whit better under the Catholic rulers of\r\nEngland, from 1169 to the period of Mary I—Henry VIII was a schismatic\r\nrather than a Protestant—than under her Protestant rulers, until James\r\nII appeared upon the scene, and his clemency toward the Irish was based\r\nupon religious rather than national grounds. Even in our own day, the\r\nEnglish Catholics are among the strongest opponents of Irish legislative\r\nindependence, and in the category of such opponents may be classed the\r\nlate Cardinal Vaughan and the present Duke of Norfolk.\r\n\r\nKing James, at the call of the Irish majority, left his French retreat,\r\nand sailed from Brest with a fleet provided by King Louis, which saw him\r\nin safety to memorable Kinsale, where he landed on March 12, old style,\r\n1689. He was accompanied by about 1,200 veteran troops, French and\r\nIrish, with a sprinkling of royalists, Scotch and English, and several\r\nofficers of high rank, including Lieutenant-General De Rosen,\r\nLieutenant-General Maumont, Major-General De Lery, Major-General\r\nPusignan, Colonel Patrick Sarsfield, afterward the renowned Earl of\r\nLucan, and the king’s two natural sons, the Duke of Berwick and Grand\r\nPrior Fitzjames. There came with him also fifteen Catholic chaplains,\r\nmost of whom could speak the Gaelic tongue, and these gentlemen were\r\nvery useful to him on a mission such as he had undertaken. The progress\r\nof the ill-fated monarch through Ireland, from Kinsale to Dublin was, in\r\nevery sense, a royal one. The Irish masses, ever grateful to any one who\r\nmakes sacrifices, or who even appears to make them, in their behalf,\r\nturned out in all their strength. A brilliant cavalcade, headed by the\r\ndashing Duke of Tyrconnel, escorted the king from town to town. His\r\ncollateral descent from King Edward Bruce, freely chosen by Ireland\r\nearly in the fourteenth century, was remembered. James was, therefore,\r\nreally welcomed as King of Ireland. The Irish cared nothing for his\r\nBritish title. If the choice of the majority of a nation makes regal\r\ntitle binding, then James II was as truly elected King of Ireland, in\r\n1689, as Edward Bruce was in 1315. And we make this statement thus\r\nplainly, because it will enable non-Irish and non-Catholic readers to\r\nunderstand why Catholic Ireland fought so fiercely and devotedly for an\r\nEnglish ruler who had lost his crown in the assertion of Catholic rights\r\nand privileges. There was still another cause for this devotion of the\r\nmajority of the Irish people to King James. He had consented to the\r\nsummoning of a national Irish parliament, in which Protestants as well\r\nas Catholics were to be represented in due proportion, and this decision\r\non his part made many of the Episcopalian Irish either neutral in the\r\ncivil conflict or active on his side. The number of such persons as were\r\ncomprised in the latter class was comparatively insignificant—just\r\nenough to mitigate the curse of absolute sectarianism in the contest.\r\nThe Dissenting or non-conforming Irish were, almost to a unit, hostile\r\nto the Jacobite cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK IV\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONICLING IMPORTANT EVENTS IN IRELAND FROM THE ARRIVAL OF JAMES II IN\r\nTHAT COUNTRY UNTIL THE DEPARTURE OF THE DUKE OF BERWICK TO FRANCE AFTER\r\nTHE FIRST SIEGE OF LIMERICK, IN 1690\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n    King James in Ireland—Enthusiastic Reception of Him by the Irish\r\n                       People—Military Operations\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTHING could exceed the enthusiasm with which the Irish people welcomed\r\nKing James. In the cities and towns, flowers were strewn in his path,\r\ncorporation officials turned out in their robes of state, and speeches\r\nof welcome were delivered in English or read in Latin. The entry into\r\nDublin was a magnificent spectacle. The whole city was in gala dress,\r\nand the different trades paraded before him. Harpers played at the\r\ntriumphal arches under which he passed. Beautiful young girls, costumed\r\nin pure white, and coroneted with wreaths, danced the ancient Irish\r\nnational dance, known as the Rinka, in the progress of which flowers\r\nwere profusely scattered by the fair performers. The religious orders\r\nwere out in force, a great cross being borne at their head. The viceroy,\r\nlord mayor, and members of the corporation, on horseback or in\r\ncarriages, made up an imposing part of the procession. When he reached\r\nthe Castle, the sword of state was presented to him by the Lord\r\nLieutenant, and the Recorder handed him, according to an old custom, the\r\nkeys of the city. “Te Deum” was sung in the Chapel Royal, one of the\r\narchitectural creations of the Duke of Tyrconnel. From the flagstaff on\r\nthe tower of the Castle itself, floated an Irish national flag, with a\r\ngolden harp upon its folds; and on this broad ensign were inscribed the\r\ninspiring and sadly prophetic words, “Now or Never! Now and Forever!”\r\nWherever the king appeared in public, he was greeted with enthusiastic\r\nshouts, in Gaelic, of “Righ Seamus!—Righ Seamus, Go Bragh”! (“King\r\nJames—King James, Forever!”)\r\n\r\nThe military situation of King James’s adherents in Ireland could not be\r\ncalled encouraging when he took up his residence in Dublin. As usual,\r\narms and ammunition were scarce. Some 30,000 men had volunteered to\r\nfight for Ireland, and there were not more than 20,000 stand of arms,\r\nall told, to place in their hands. And of this small supply, fully\r\nthree-fourths were antiquated and worthless. While there were,\r\nnominally, fifty regiments of infantry enrolled, the only serviceable\r\nregiments of horse were those of Galmoy, Tyrconnel, and Russell. There\r\nwas one regiment of dragoons, and of cannon only eight field-pieces had\r\nbeen collected. The two best-equipped bodies of Irish troops were the\r\ncommand of General Richard Hamilton, in Ulster—about 3,000 men; and that\r\nof General Justin McCarthy, Lord Mountcashel, in Munster—slightly more\r\nnumerous. Derry and Inniskillen held out for William of Orange, and\r\nnotwithstanding some successes of General Hamilton in the North, there\r\nseemed no immediate prospect of reducing them. The stubborn attitude of\r\nInniskillen delayed the junction of Mountcashel’s and Hamilton’s forces,\r\nwhich had been ordered by the Duke of Tyrconnel, commander-in-chief of\r\nthe Irish army, with General De Rosen as his second in command. The\r\nsmaller places occupied by the Williamite forces were abandoned as being\r\nuntenable, and the little garrisons fell back on Londonderry, which had\r\nnow become the main objective of the Jacobite army. The military\r\ngovernor, Lundy, was suspected of being, at heart, a Stuart sympathizer,\r\nbut he was soon virtually superseded, first by Governor Baker and\r\nafterward by the celebrated Rev. George Walker, rector of the living of\r\nDonoughmore, to whom history awards the glory of the long, desperate,\r\nbrilliant, and successful defence of Derry against the armies of King\r\nJames. It is a pity that the ability and bravery displayed by Dr. Walker\r\nhave been made causes of political and religious irritation in the north\r\nof Ireland for upward of two centuries. Lundy, when his authority was\r\ndefied, escaped from the city at night, in the disguise of a laborer,\r\nand cut no further figure in Irish history. Before his flight, King\r\nJames’s flatterers in Dublin had persuaded him to advance against Derry\r\nin person and demand its surrender. Tyrconnel opposed the idea in vain.\r\nHe well knew that Lundy was in correspondence with Hamilton and De Rosen\r\nfor the surrender of the city. It is quite probable that Derry would\r\nhave finally surrendered, on honorable terms, had James taken\r\nTyrconnel’s advice; but, with his usual fatuity, the obstinate king took\r\nthe advice of the shallow courtiers, and did actually present himself\r\nbefore the walls of Derry and demand its unconditional surrender! The\r\nreply was a cannon shot, which killed an officer at James’s side. The\r\nking retired with precipitation, and the citizens sent after him the\r\n“Prentice Boys’” shout of “No surrender!” Mortified by his rather\r\nignominious failure, James retired to Dublin, and summoned Parliament to\r\nmeet on the lines already indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n    Jacobites Foiled at Londonderry—Mountcashel Defeated at Newtown\r\n                  Butler—King James’s Irish Parliament\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE siege of Derry was continued under the supervision of Maumont and\r\nHamilton, who had quite a large force at their disposal. It is\r\nregrettable to have to state that the Protestant population of Ulster\r\nwas further inflamed against the Stuart cause by the needless excesses\r\nof Galmoy and the barbaric severity of De Rosen, who placed a crowd of\r\nhelpless women and children between two fires under the ramparts of\r\nDerry, in the hope of compelling the garrison to surrender. The\r\nbrilliant victories obtained over the Williamites at Coleraine and\r\nCladysford, by General Hamilton, in the earlier part of the campaign,\r\nwere more than offset by the overwhelming defeat inflicted by General\r\nWolseley, at Newtown Butler, on the Jacobite army under Mountcashel. It\r\nwas Irish against Irish, but the Inniskilleners, who made up the bulk of\r\nWolseley’s force, were seasoned soldiers, well armed and well directed.\r\nMountcashel’s men were chiefly green levies, and the battle was really\r\nlost through their faulty manœuvring. One brigade mistook an order to\r\nchange front, so as to form a new line against a flank attack of the\r\nenemy, for an order to retreat, and so spread a panic that proved fatal.\r\nMountcashel himself was dangerously wounded and made prisoner. He lost\r\n2,000 men in killed and wounded, and 400 fugitives, completely\r\nsurrounded, surrendered at some distance from the field. This battle was\r\nfought on July 31, 1689, and, on the same day, Derry was relieved by an\r\nEnglish fleet, which succeeded in breaking the boom that had been\r\nconstructed by the Jacobite engineers across the mouth of the harbor.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the gates of the city were closed against\r\nLord Antrim on December 7, 1688. Hamilton’s bombardment of the place\r\nbegan on the 17th of April, 1689, and lasted for three months. There was\r\na total blockade for three weeks, and provisions became so scarce that\r\nthe defenders actually devoured dogs, cats, rats, mice—anything, however\r\nrevolting, that might satisfy the cravings of absolute hunger. The\r\nbesiegers also suffered from bad weather and the shots from the hostile\r\nbatteries. A rough computation places the total loss of the defenders at\r\nabout 4,000 men, and that of the assailants at 6,000—the latter loss\r\nchiefly by disease. The relief of Derry was a mortal blow to the cause\r\nof King James, and soon afterward he lost every important post in\r\nUlster, except Carrickfergus and Charlemont. Yet, as an Irish writer has\r\nwell remarked, Ulster was bestowed by the king’s grandfather “upon the\r\nancestors of those who now unanimously rejected and resisted him.” His\r\ncause also received a fatal stroke in Scotland by the death of the brave\r\nDundee, who fell, vainly victorious, over the Williamite general,\r\nMackay, at the battle of Killecrankie, fought July 26, 1689. Duke\r\nSchomberg arrived in Belfast Lough with a large fleet and army on August\r\n13th. Count Solmes was his second in command. He laid siege to\r\nCarrickfergus, which capitulated on fair terms after eight days’\r\nbombardment. Charlemont, defended by the brave and eccentric Colonel\r\nTeague O’Regan, held out till the following May, when it surrendered\r\nwith the honors of war. It is said that King William, on his arrival in\r\nIreland, knighted O’Regan in recognition of the brilliancy of his\r\ndefence. The young Duke of Berwick made a gallant stand in the\r\nneighborhood, but was finally compelled to yield ground to the superior\r\nforces of Schomberg. Critics of the latter’s strategy hold that he\r\ncommitted a grave military error in failing to march on the Irish\r\ncapital, which was not in a good posture of defence, immediately after\r\nlanding in Ulster. Had he done so, King James must have had to evacuate\r\nDublin and fall back on the defensive line of the Shannon, as Tyrconnel\r\nand Sarsfield did at a later period. Then Schomberg, it is claimed,\r\nwould not have lost more than half of his army, by dysentery, at his\r\nmarshy camp near Dundalk, where King James, in the autumn, bearded and\r\ndefied him to risk battle with the stronger and healthier Jacobite\r\nforces. There would have been no occasion for the Battle of the Boyne,\r\nthe memory of which has divided and distracted Irishmen for more than\r\ntwo centuries, had the challenge been accepted.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament summoned by James met in the Inn’s Court, Dublin, in the\r\nsummer of 1689. It was composed of 46 peers and 228 commoners. Of the\r\nformer body, several were High Church Protestants, but, in the Lower\r\nHouse, there were comparatively few members of the “reformed religion.”\r\nThis, however, was not the fault of the king or his advisers, as they\r\nwere sincere in their desire to have a full Protestant representation in\r\nthat Parliament. But, perhaps naturally, the Protestants were suspicious\r\nof the king’s good intentions, and so the majority held aloof from the\r\nParliamentary proceedings. The most important acts passed by that\r\nParliament were one establishing liberty of conscience, which provided,\r\namong other things, that Catholics should not be compelled to pay tithes\r\nto Protestant clergymen, and _vice versa_; another act established the\r\njudicial independence of Ireland, by abolishing writs of error and\r\nappeal to England. The Act of Settlement was repealed, under protest by\r\nthe Protestant peers, who did not, for obvious reasons, wish the\r\nquestion of land titles obtained by fraud and force opened up. An act of\r\nattainder, directed against persons in arms against their sovereign in\r\nIreland, was added to the list of measures. Heedless of the advice of\r\nhis wisest friends, James vetoed the bill for the repeal of the infamous\r\nPoynings’ Law, which made the Irish Parliament dependent upon that of\r\nEngland; and also declined to approve a measure establishing Inns of\r\nCourt for the education of Irish law students. In the first-mentioned\r\ncase, James acted from a belief that his own prerogative of vetoing\r\nIrish measures in council was attacked, but his hostility to the measure\r\nfor legal education has never been satisfactorily explained. Taken as a\r\nwhole, however, King James’s Irish Parliament was a legislative success;\r\nand it enabled the Protestant patriot and orator, Henry Grattan, when\r\nadvocating Catholic claims in the Irish Parliament a hundred years\r\nafterward, to say: “Although Papists, the Irish Catholics were not\r\nslaves. They wrung a Constitution from King James before they\r\naccompanied him to the field.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n        King James’s Imprudent Acts—Witty Retort of a Protestant\r\n                 Peer—Architectural Features of Dublin\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR last chapter showed that Ireland, although her population was\r\noverwhelmingly Catholic, began her struggle for civil liberty by a\r\nnon-sectarian enactment, which left the exercise of religion free. Yet,\r\nstrange to say, this wise and liberal policy did not win her the\r\nsympathy of Europe, Protestant or Catholic, outside of France, whose\r\nking had personal reasons for his friendliness. Louis XIV was both hated\r\nand feared by the sovereigns of continental, as well as insular, Europe.\r\nA combination, called the League of Augsburg, was formed against him,\r\nand of this League the Emperor of Germany was the head and William of\r\nOrange an active member. Spain, Savoy, and other Catholic states were as\r\nzealous against Louis as the Protestant states of Sweden and North\r\nGermany. Even the Pope was on the side of the French king’s foes. In\r\nfact, when Duke Schomberg landed, the war had resolved itself into a\r\nconflict between the rest of Europe, except Muscovy and Turkey and their\r\ndependencies, and France and Ireland. It was a most unequal struggle,\r\nbut most gallantly maintained, with varying fortune, on Irish soil\r\nchiefly, for two long and bloody years.\r\n\r\nKing James made enemies among his warmest supporters by increasing the\r\nsubsidy voted him by Parliament to twice the original amount, payable\r\nmonthly. He also debased the currency, by issuing “brass money,” which\r\nled to the demoralization of trade, and Tyrconnel, after James’s\r\ndeparture from Ireland, was compelled to withdraw the whole fraudulent\r\nissue in order to stop the popular clamor. Some Protestant writers,\r\nnotably Dr. Cooke Taylor, have warmly commended the king’s judicial\r\nappointments in Ireland, with few exceptions. In short, to sum up this\r\nportion of his career, James II acted in Ireland the part of despot\r\nbenevolently inclined, who thought he was doing a wise thing in giving\r\nthe people a paternal form of government. But the Irish people can not\r\nlong endure one-man rule, unless convinced that the one man is much\r\nwiser than the whole mass of the nation, which is not often the case. It\r\ncertainly was not in the case of King James. His establishment of a bank\r\nby proclamation and his decree of a bank restriction act annoyed and\r\nangered the commercial classes, whose prices for goods he also sought to\r\nregulate. But his crowning act of unwisdom was interference with the\r\ngovernment of that time-honored educational institution, Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin, on which, notwithstanding its statutes, he sought to\r\nforce officers of his own choosing. He also wished to make fellowships\r\nand scholarships open to Catholics—a just principle, indeed, but a rash\r\npolicy, considering that every act of the kind only multiplied his\r\nenemies among the Protestants of Ireland, who were already sufficiently\r\nhostile. Had King James proceeded slowly in his chosen course, he might\r\nhave come down to posterity as a successful royal reformer.\r\nUnfortunately for his fame, posterity in general regards him as a\r\nconspicuous political as well as military failure.\r\n\r\nAmong King James’s chosen intimates and advisers during his residence in\r\nDublin, the most distinguished were the Duke of Tyrconnel, the Earl of\r\nMelfort, Secretary of State; Count D’Avaux, the French Ambassador; Lord\r\nMountcashel, Colonel Sarsfield, afterward so famous; Most Rev. Dr.\r\nMcGuire, Primate of Ireland, and Chief Justice Lord Nugent. He generally\r\nattended Mass every morning in the Chapel Royal, and, on Sundays,\r\nassisted at solemn High Mass. One Sunday, he was attended to the\r\nentrance of the chapel by a loyal Protestant lord, whose father had been\r\na Catholic, as James’s had been a Protestant. As he was taking his\r\nleave, the king remarked, rather dryly: “My lord, your father would have\r\ngone farther.” “Very true, sire,” responded the witty nobleman, “but\r\nyour Majesty’s father would not have gone so far!”\r\n\r\nThe Dublin of that time was not, in any sense, the attractive city it is\r\nto-day. Beyond the great cathedrals and the ancient Castle, there was\r\nlittle to attract the eye, except the beauty of the surroundings, which\r\nare still the admiration of all visitors. A century after the reign of\r\nKing James, Dublin, from an architectural standpoint, became one of the\r\nmost classical of European capitals; and the Houses of Parliament, the\r\nFour Courts, the Custom House, and other public buildings, became the\r\npride of the populace. These monuments of Irish genius still exist,\r\nalthough shorn of their former glory; but they serve, at least, to\r\nattest what Ireland could accomplish under native rule. There is not a\r\npenny of English money in any of these magnificent structures. All the\r\ncredit of their construction belongs to the Irish Parliaments of the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n       Composition of the Hostile Armies—King William Arrives in\r\n            Ireland—Narrowly Escapes Death on Eve of Battle\r\n\r\n\r\nDURING the spring and early summer of 1690, the war clouds began to mass\r\nthemselves heavily in the northeastern portion of the island, where Duke\r\nSchomberg, his depleted army somewhat recruited, still held his ground\r\nat Dundalk, with small garrisons posted throughout Ulster. But it was\r\nsoon known that William of Orange, in person, was to command in chief in\r\nthis fateful campaign. Several engagements, with varying fortune, had\r\noccurred between the rival armies in different parts of the north\r\ncountry, where the Duke of Berwick waged a vigorous campaign against the\r\nWilliamites. James, dissatisfied with the French Ambassador, D’Avaux,\r\nand Lieutenant-General De Rosen, demanded, and obtained, their recall by\r\nKing Louis. By an arrangement between the two monarchs, Mountcashel’s\r\ncommand of 6,000 men was exchanged for 6,000 French troops, under\r\nLieutenant-General De Lauzun, who eventually proved to be even a greater\r\nmarplot and blunderer than the odious De Rosen. Mountcashel’s force\r\nformed the Old Irish Brigade, of immortal memory, in the French service,\r\nand almost immediately after its arrival in France was sent to operate\r\nunder the famous Lieutenant-General St. Ruth in Savoy. It also served in\r\nseveral campaigns under the great Marshal Catinat, “Father Thoughtful,”\r\nas he was fondly called by the French army. The exchange proved a bad\r\nbargain for Ireland, as will be seen in the course of this narration.\r\nJames hoped much from the skill and daring of the French contingent, but\r\nwas doomed to bitter disappointment. “His troops,” says McGee, “were\r\nchiefly Celtic and Catholic. There were four regiments commanded by\r\nO’Neills, two by O’Briens, one each by McCarthy More, Maguire, O’More,\r\nO’Donnell, McMahon, and Magennis, chiefly recruited among their own\r\nclansmen. There were also the regiments of Sarsfield, Nugent, De Courcy,\r\nFitzgerald, Grace, and Burke, chiefly Celts in the rank and file. On the\r\nother hand, Schomberg led into the field the famous Blue and White Dutch\r\nregiments; the Huguenot regiments of Schomberg (the Younger), La\r\nMillinier, Du Cambon, and La Caillemotte; the English regiments of Lords\r\nDevonshire, Delamere, Lovelace, Sir John Lanier, Colonels Langston,\r\nVilliers, and others; the Anglo-Irish regiments of Lords Meath,\r\nRoscommon, Kingston, and Drogheda, with the Ulstermen under Brigadier\r\nWolseley and Colonels Gustavus Hamilton, Mitchellburn, Lloyd, White, St.\r\nJohn, and Tiffany.”\r\n\r\nThe absence of a fleet, the entire navy having gone over to William,\r\nplaced James at a great disadvantage, and explains why there were no sea\r\nfights of importance in British and Irish waters during this war.\r\nIsolated French squadrons could not be expected to make headway against\r\nthe united navies of Britain and Holland. William, on the contrary, had\r\nthe seas wide open to him, and, on June 14, 1690, he landed at\r\nCarrickfergus with reinforcements and supplies for his army in Ireland,\r\nand accompanied by the Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt, Prince George of\r\nDenmark, the Duke of Ormond, the Earls of Portland, Manchester, Oxford,\r\nand Scarborough; General Mackay, General Douglas, and many other\r\nwarriors well known to British and Continental fame. He established\r\nheadquarters at Belfast and caused a muster of all his forces, which\r\nshowed him to be at the head of about 40,000 men, mostly veterans, and\r\nmade up of contingents from Scandinavia, Holland, Switzerland,\r\nBrandenburg, England, Scotland, Ulster, together with the exiled\r\nHuguenot regiments of France and the Anglo-Irish battalions of the Pale.\r\nAllowing for detachments, William had under him an army of, at least,\r\n36,000 effective men, officered by the best military talent of the\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nJames, according to all Irish and some British authorities, commanded a\r\nforce of 17,000 Irish, of whom alone the cavalry, numbering, probably,\r\nfrom five to six thousand men, were considered thoroughly trained. In\r\naddition, he had 6,000 well-appointed French infantry, under De Lauzun,\r\nwhich brought his total up to some 23,000 men, with only twelve pieces\r\nof cannon. William, on the other hand, possessed a powerful and\r\nwell-appointed artillery. Once again, James was advised not to oppose\r\nhis comparatively weak and ill-disciplined army to an encounter with the\r\nveteran host of William, and again the advantages of the defensive line\r\nof the Shannon were pointed out to him. But he would not listen to the\r\nvoice of prudence, and marched northward to meet his rival, almost\r\nimmediately after learning of his debarkation at Carrickfergus. The\r\nStuart army reached Dundalk about June 22, when William was reported to\r\nbe at Newry. His scouts were soon seen on the neighboring heights, and\r\nthe Franco-Irish forces fell back on the river Boyne, and took post on\r\nthe southern bank, within a few miles of Drogheda. The Irish camp was\r\npitched immediately below the hill of Donore and near the small village\r\nof Oldbridge, in the obtuse salient, pointing northwestward, formed by\r\nthe second bend in the river in its course from Slane—about six miles\r\nfrom Oldbridge—to the sea. In the chart of the battle, published by the\r\nRev. George Story, King William’s chaplain, in 1693, three strong\r\nbatteries are shown in front of the right of the Irish army, on the\r\nsouth bank of the Boyne, and one protecting its left opposite to the\r\npoint where the Mattock rivulet falls into the main river. But no Irish\r\naccount mentions these batteries. Some critics have thought it strange\r\nthat the Williamites, instead of making a long and tedious movement by\r\nSlane, did not endeavor to attack both sides of the river salient at\r\nonce, and thus place the Irish army between two fires. The water,\r\napparently, was no deeper above than below the rivulet, but even were it\r\ndeeper, William had with him a well-appointed bridge train, and the\r\nfeeble battery, if any existed at all, would be insufficient to check\r\nthe ardor of his chosen veterans. On the summit of Donore Hill, which\r\nslopes backward for more than a mile from the river, stood a little\r\nchurch, with a graveyard and some huts beside it. Even in 1690, it was\r\nan insignificant ruin, but it is noted in Anglo-Irish history as marking\r\nthe headquarters of King James during the operations on the Boyne.\r\n\r\nThe right wing of the Irish army extended itself toward that smaller\r\npart of Drogheda which is situated on the south bank of the river, in\r\nthe County Meath. The centre faced the fords in front of Oldbridge,\r\nwhere several small shoals, or islands, as marked in Story’s map,\r\nrendered the passage of an attacking force comparatively easy of\r\naccomplishment. The left wing stretched in the direction of Slane, where\r\nthere was a bridge, and, nearer to the Irish army, a ford practicable\r\nfor cavalry. James was urged to strengthen this wing of his army, sure\r\nto be attacked, the day before the battle, but he could only be induced\r\nto send out some cavalry patrols to observe the ground. When the tide,\r\nwhich backs the water up from below Drogheda, is out, many points on the\r\nriver in front of the Irish position are easily fordable, and there has\r\nbeen little or no change in the volume of the current during the last\r\ntwo centuries. Therefore, the Boyne presented no such formidable\r\nobstacle to a successful crossing as some imaginative historians have\r\nsought to make out. Neither did nature, in other respects, particularly\r\nfavor the Irish in the choice of their ground. Their army occupied a\r\nfairly good defensive position, if its advantages had been properly\r\nutilized. King James interfered with the plans of his generals, as it\r\nwas his habit to interfere in every department of his government, not at\r\nall to the advantage of the public service. An able general, such as\r\nWilliam or Schomberg was, might have made the Irish ground secure; that\r\nis, with sufficient cannon to answer the formidable park brought into\r\naction by the enemy. The Irish army was in position on June 29, and on\r\nthe following day, King William, accompanied by his staff and escort,\r\nappeared on the opposite heights. His main army was concealed behind the\r\nhills in the depression now known as King William’s Glen. With his\r\ncustomary daring activity, the astute Hollander immediately proceeded to\r\nreconnoitre the Jacobite position, of which he obtained a good view,\r\nthough some of the regiments were screened by the irregularities of the\r\nground. Although within easy range of the Irish lines, he was not\r\nmolested for some time. Having concluded his observations, William, with\r\nhis officers, dismounted. Lunch was spread on the grass by the\r\nattendants, and the party proceeded to regale themselves. They were\r\nallowed to finish in peace, but when they remounted and turned toward\r\ntheir camp, the report of a field-piece came from the Irish side. A\r\nround shot ricochetted and killed a member of the escort. A second ball\r\ncaught the king upon the shoulder, tore his coat and broke the skin\r\nbeneath it. He fell forward on his horse, but immediately recovered\r\nhimself, and the entire party rode rapidly out of range. The Irish\r\nofficers, who had observed the confusion caused by the second shot,\r\nimagined that William had been killed. The news was circulated in the\r\ncamp, speedily traveled to Dublin, and soon found its way to Great\r\nBritain and the Continent. But William was not dead. After the surgeons\r\nhad dressed his wound, he insisted on again mounting his horse, and,\r\nlike Napoleon when he was wounded in front of Ratisbon, in 1809, showed\r\nhimself to the army, whose shouts of joy speedily informed the Irish\r\ntroops that their able enemy was still in the saddle. A brisk cannonade,\r\nwhich did but little damage, was then exchanged between the two armies.\r\nIt was the noisy prelude of a much more eventful drama. On the morrow\r\nwas to be decided the fate not alone of the ancient Stuart dynasty, but\r\nalso of Ireland, with all Europe for witnesses. Night put an end to the\r\nartillery duel, and the hostile hosts, except the sentinels, disposed\r\nthemselves to sleep. History fails to record the watchword of King\r\nJames’s army, but Chaplain Story is authority for the statement that the\r\nword in William’s camp was “Westminster.” The soldiers on both sides, to\r\nuse the military phrase, “slept upon their arms.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n     Battle of the Boyne—Death of Marshal Schomberg—Valor of Irish\r\n                Cavalry—Inexcusable Flight of King James\r\n\r\n\r\nTUESDAY morning, July 1, old style, dawned beautifully on the river\r\nBoyne. Both of the royal hosts were drawn out in all their bravery, and\r\nthe early sun glittered on their burnished arms. We have no good account\r\nof their uniforms, but, judging by prints of the period, the British, in\r\ngeneral, wore scarlet and the Continental allies blue. Some of the\r\nFrench regiments allied to the Irish army wore white and others blue\r\ncoats, which were the favorite colors of the Bourbon kings. The Irish\r\narmy must surely have worn scarlet—the livery of the House of\r\nStuart—because, we are informed by George Story and other historians,\r\nthey bore white badges in their hats, to distinguish themselves from the\r\nWilliamites, who wore green boughs in theirs. The white cockade, or\r\nrosette, was the emblem of the Dukes of York—a title borne by James, as\r\nwill be remembered, before his accession. The irony of fate, surely, was\r\nmade manifest by the circumstance of William’s soldiers wearing\r\nIreland’s national color, as now generally recognized, on the occasion\r\nof her most fateful, although not bloodiest, defeat.\r\n\r\nAt 6 o’clock A.M., William took the initiative by ordering above 10,000\r\nhorse and foot, under General Douglas, Schomberg, Jr., and Lords\r\nPortland and Overkirk, to march along the river bank toward Slane, cross\r\nat, or near, that point, and so turn the left flank of the Irish army.\r\nThis manœuvre was plainly seen and understood by James and his\r\nlieutenants. Sir Neal O’Neill, at the head of his dragoons, was detached\r\nto check the movement. The brave leader was in time to charge the\r\nenemy’s cavalry, which had crossed nearer to Oldbridge than was\r\noriginally designed, as they had found a practicable ford. The main body\r\ncrossed higher up, at Slane. O’Neill, according to all accounts of the\r\nengagement on this flank of the Jacobite army, must have made a most\r\ngallant fight, because it was well on toward 9 o’clock before the enemy\r\nwas able to secure a footing on the Irish bank of the Boyne, and then\r\nonly after the brave O’Neill had been mortally wounded, and his\r\nsurviving soldiers discouraged by his fall. Notwithstanding, the Irish\r\ndragoons drew off the field in excellent order, bearing their dying\r\ngeneral along with them. With his latest breath, O’Neill sent word to\r\nKing James of how matters stood on his left wing, to which Douglas’s\r\nwhole imposing force had now formed itself perpendicularly, that is, at\r\nright angles, threatening not alone the left of the Irish line of\r\nbattle, but also the rear, or line of retreat, on the pass of Duleek,\r\nwhich was the gateway to Dublin. James, observing this, became\r\ndemoralized. Instead of using the French veterans at Oldbridge ford,\r\nwhere he must have seen the main attack was to be delivered, he placed\r\nin the hedges, and other defences which covered it, untried Irish\r\nlevies, badly weaponed, brave enough, it is true, but at absolute\r\ndisadvantage when placed in opposition to the splendid armament and\r\nperfect discipline of William’s veterans, many of whom had been in a\r\nscore of pitched battles. Lauzun and his French were sent toward the\r\nIrish left, accompanied by Sarsfield, with a weak squadron of horse. But\r\nDouglas had formed his troops in such strong array that Lauzun, in spite\r\nof the direct orders of King James, declined to attack him, or receive\r\nhis attack. Instead, he manœuvred so as to place a morass between his\r\ntroops and the enemy, and then began falling back on the pass of Duleek,\r\nfearing to be outflanked and cut off by young Schomberg’s powerful\r\ncavalry. Sarsfield, according to his custom, charged the hostile horse\r\nboldly, but his men were too few, and he was reluctantly compelled to\r\nfollow the retrograde movement of the French. In this operation he lost\r\none cannon, which got stuck in the mud of a bog that intervened between\r\nthe river and Donore. At the latter point he rejoined the king. James\r\nseemed to think only of his line of retreat. Had he thought of his line\r\nof advance, everything might still have been rectified. His army\r\nremained unshaken, except by his own wretched fears. The dread of being\r\nmade a prisoner was his bane. He had sent most of the baggage and half\r\nthe cannon toward Dublin at the first news of the reverse at Slane—a\r\nremarkable way by which to raise the spirits of an army already sadly\r\nconscious of the incompetency of its royal commander, and its own\r\ninferiority to the Williamite host in everything but ardent zeal and\r\nknightly courage.\r\n\r\nWilliam, on learning of the success of his right wing, immediately\r\nordered Marshal Schomberg, at the head of the formidable Dutch guards,\r\ntwo regiments of Huguenots, two of Inniskilleners, Sir John Hammer’s\r\nregiment, and several others on that front, including the Danes, to ford\r\nthe Boyne in hot haste. They plunged in bravely, opposite to Oldbridge,\r\nand so dense were their columns, according to Chaplain Story, that the\r\nwater rose perceptibly. Still it could not have risen much above the\r\nknees of the shortest soldier, for the historian, Haverty—a scrupulous\r\nwriter—says, in his admirable work, that the water did not reach to the\r\ndrums of the bands that accompanied the attack. The unseasoned Irish\r\ndragoons and infantry, armed with old fusils and half-pikes, received\r\nthe enemy with a hasty and ill-directed fire, which did little damage.\r\nWilliam’s troops replied with overpowering volleys, and his batteries\r\nthrew balls into the defences. It would seem that little was done at\r\nthis point to rally the defenders, for they soon broke and abandoned the\r\nhedges, but formed again in the lanes of Oldbridge and the fields in its\r\nvicinity. The shout of triumph from Schomberg’s men was answered by a\r\nroar of anger that seemed to come from the battle-clouds above the\r\nriver. There was a sound as of many waters, a terrific crashing of\r\nhoofs, a flashing of sabres, dying groans—Richard Hamilton, at the head\r\nof the superb Irish cavalry, was among the Williamite regiments, dealing\r\ndeath-strokes right and left. Even the Dutch Blues reeled before the\r\nshock—the Danes and Huguenots were broken and driven back across the\r\nstream. Old Duke Schomberg, in trying to restore order, was killed near\r\nthe Irish side of the river, and there, too, fell Caillemotte, the\r\nHuguenot hero, and Bishop Walker, the defender of Derry. It was a\r\nsplendid charge, and, had it been sustained by the whole Irish army,\r\nmight have saved the day. But King James’s eyes were not turned toward\r\nOldbridge ford, but to the pass of Duleek. Fresh bodies of hostile\r\ninfantry continued to cross the stream, and were charged and driven back\r\nseveral times by the Irish horse. This part of the battle began about\r\n10.15 o’clock and continued until nearly noon.\r\n\r\nKing William now took a hand in the fight, and crossed with most of his\r\ncavalry nearer to Drogheda. It is said that the tide had risen so high,\r\nhe was obliged to swim his horse, which, also, got “bogged” on the Irish\r\nbank, and was extricated with difficulty. When the animal was freed,\r\nWilliam remounted, and, although his shoulder was still stiff and sore\r\nfrom contact with the cannon-ball on the previous day, he drew his sword\r\nand placed himself at the head of such of his horse as had crossed with\r\nhim. He also rallied some foot-soldiers who had been scattered by\r\nHamilton’s furious charges. Nor were these yet over. Hardly had William\r\nplaced his men in order, when Hamilton came down again, with a whirlwind\r\nrush, and Chaplain Story says, with great simplicity: “Our horse were\r\nforced to give ground, although the king was with them!” William, on\r\nrecovering his breath, observed the Inniskillen regiment of cavalry at a\r\nshort distance, rode up in front of them and said, in his blunt fashion:\r\n“What will _you_ do for me?” They answered with a cheer, and rode to\r\nmeet the Irish cavalry, who were again coming on at a fierce gallop,\r\nurged by Hamilton. The shock was terrible, but again the presence and\r\nthe leadership of the warlike William proved unavailing, and the\r\nInniskilleners, sadly cut up, followed the routed Williamite ruck down\r\nthe hill toward the river. Cool in the moment of danger, William of\r\nOrange retired slowly and managed to rally some foot and horse to his\r\nassistance. By this time more of his cavalry had crossed, under Ruvigny\r\nand Ginkel. The former captured some colors, according to Story, but\r\nGinkel’s force was routed and he, himself, did not conceal his vexation\r\nat their want of firmness. He kept in their rear, in order to prevent\r\nthem from bolting at sight of the Irish horse.\r\n\r\nKing James was urged by all of those about him who had regard for his\r\nhonor, including the brave General Sheldon and the ever gallant\r\nSarsfield, to place himself at the head of his reserve of cavalry and\r\ncharge full upon William as he ascended toward Donore. The unfortunate\r\nman, more of a moral than a physical coward, seemed unable to collect\r\nhis faculties; and, instead of doing what became him, yielded to the\r\nadvice of the timid, and, even while the battle raged hotly below him,\r\nturned his horse, and, accompanied by his disgusted officers and\r\nastonished troopers, rode toward the pass of Duleek, held by the French\r\nand some of the Irish, who repulsed every effort of General Douglas to\r\nforce it. Hamilton’s cavalry still continued to charge the Williamite\r\nadvance, and thus enabled the Irish infantry to retire slowly on Donore,\r\nwhere the bold Duke of Berwick rallied them and presented an unbroken\r\nfront to King William. Then, in turn, they retired toward Duleek.\r\nHamilton made a final furious charge, in which his horse was killed and\r\nfell upon him. He was also wounded in the head and made prisoner. He was\r\ntaken before William, who said: “Well, sir, is this business over with,\r\nor will your horse show more fight?” Hamilton responded: “Upon my honor,\r\nsir, I think they will.” The king, who was incensed against the general\r\nfor having sided with James and Tyrconnel against himself, looked\r\naskance at the gallant prisoner and muttered: “Your honor! Your honor!”\r\nAnd this was all that passed between them.\r\n\r\nChaplain Story, from whose book we have taken many of our facts, was a\r\nmost graphic and interesting writer, but a sad hater of the Irish,\r\nagainst whom he seems to have borne a grudge, perhaps because they\r\nkilled his brother, an English officer, in action. He never said a good\r\nword for them if he could avoid doing so. Yet, in spite of this failing,\r\nthe truth would escape him occasionally. Many English writers leave the\r\nimpression that the Irish army was defeated at the Boyne within an hour\r\nor so after the engagement began. We have seen that the first movement\r\nwas made about daylight, and that the battle near Slane opened about 8\r\no’clock. In front of Oldbridge the attack was made at 10:15, and\r\ncontinued hotly until nearly noon, when King William himself took\r\ncommand, crossed the river with his left wing and was bravely checked by\r\nHamilton. Duleek is not more than three miles from the fords of\r\nOldbridge. Therefore, the Irish must have fought very obstinately when\r\nChaplain Story makes the following admission on page 23 of his\r\n“Continuation of the Wars of Ireland”: “Our army then pressed hard upon\r\nthem, but meeting with a great many difficulties in the ground, and\r\nbeing obliged to pursue in order, our horse had only the opportunity of\r\ncutting down some of their foot, and most of the rest got over the pass\r\nat Duleek; then night coming on[3] prevented us from making so entire a\r\nvictory of it as could have been wished for.” Thus, on the testimony of\r\nthis Williamite partisan and eye-witness, the battle of the Boyne,\r\ncounting from its inception to its close, lasted about fifteen hours.\r\nEvidently the overpowered Irish army did not retreat very fast.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  In Ireland, at that season, there is a strong twilight until nearly 9\r\n  o’clock.—_Author._\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the principal men who fell on the Williamite\r\nside. On the Jacobite side there fell Lords Dungan and Carlingford, Sir\r\nNeal O’Neill and some other officers of note, together with some 1,200\r\nrank and file killed or wounded. Few prisoners were taken. Mr. Story, as\r\nusual, underestimates William’s loss, when he places it at “nigh four\r\nhundred.” More candid English estimates place it at nearer a thousand,\r\nand this was, probably, the true figure. The Chaplain, in dwelling on\r\nthe casualties, says plaintively: “The loss of Duke Schomberg, who was\r\nkilled soon after the first of our forces passed the river near\r\nOldbridge, was much more considerable than all that fell that day on\r\nboth sides.”\r\n\r\nDrogheda, occupied by an Irish garrison of 1,500 men, surrendered, on\r\nsummons, the day after the battle. Had their commander made a spirited\r\nsortie on William’s left wing, as it was crossing the river, good might\r\nhave resulted for the cause of James. It would seem that, like himself,\r\nmany of his officers lacked the daring enterprise that can alone win the\r\nsmiles of Bellona.\r\n\r\nKing James, shamefully for himself, deserted the battlefield, or,\r\nrather, the outer edge of it, before the fight at the fords was over. An\r\nIrish Protestant poet, the late Dr. W. R. Wilde, of Dublin, says of the\r\nincident:\r\n\r\n                “But where is James? What! urged to fly,\r\n                   Ere quailed his brave defenders!\r\n                 Their dead in Oldbridge crowded lie,\r\n                   But not a sword surrenders!”\r\n\r\nHe reached Dublin at 9 o’clock that evening, while still the Irish army\r\nexchanged shots with William’s troops across the Nannywater at the pass\r\nof Duleek! Tradition says that, meeting Lady Tyrconnel at the Castle, he\r\nexclaimed: “Your countrymen run well, madam!” The spirited Irishwoman at\r\nonce replied: “I congratulate your Majesty on having won the race!”\r\n\r\nEnglish historians, in general, taking their cue from Story, are\r\nungenerous to the Irish in connection with the Boyne. English troops had\r\ncomparatively little hand in obtaining the victory. The French writers,\r\nalso, in order to screen the misconduct, and possibly treason, of De\r\nLauzun, seek to throw all the blame for the loss of the battle on their\r\nIrish allies. Not so, many of the Irish Protestant writers, whose\r\ncoreligionists bore a great deal of the brunt of the fighting on\r\nWilliam’s side, and were thus enabled to know the truth. Among those\r\nwriters may be mentioned Colonel William Blacker, poet-laureate of the\r\nOrange Order in Ireland, who wrote at the beginning of the last century,\r\nand, in his poem, “The Battle of the Boyne,” gives full credit to his\r\nCatholic fellow-countrymen for their valor, thus:\r\n\r\n   “In vain the sword Green Erin draws and life away doth fling—\r\n    Oh! worthy of a better cause and of a braver king!\r\n    In vain thy bearing bold is shown upon that blood-stained ground;\r\n    Thy towering hopes are overthrown—thy choicest fall around.\r\n\r\n   “Hurrah! hurrah! the victor shout is heard on high Donore!\r\n    Down Plottin’s Vale, in hurried rout, thy shattered masses pour.\r\n    But many a gallant spirit there retreats across the plain,\r\n    Who ‘change but kings’ would gladly dare that battlefield again!”\r\n\r\nThe expression, in regard to exchanging monarchs, alluded to in the\r\nballad, is founded on a saying attributed to Sarsfield, who, on being\r\ntaunted by a British officer at the Duleek outposts the night of the\r\nengagement, exclaimed: “Change kings with us, and we will fight the\r\nbattle over again with you!”\r\n\r\nJames, after his defeat, remained but one day in Dublin. He summoned the\r\nState Council and the Lord Mayor, bade them farewell, and left the\r\ngovernment of the kingdom and the command of the army in the hands of\r\nTyrconnel. Then, accompanied by a small staff, he rode to Bray and\r\nthence by easy stages to Waterford, where he embarked for France and\r\nreached that kingdom in safety. He was generously received by King\r\nLouis. In justice to a monarch who is alleged to have spoken harshly and\r\nunjustly of his Irish troops and subjects after the battle of the Boyne,\r\nwe must state that his published Memoirs, as also those of his son, the\r\nheroic Duke of Berwick, bear the very highest testimony to the bravery\r\nand devotion of the Irish army, particularly in dealing with the closing\r\ncampaign in Ireland, when it crowned itself with glory. Remembering\r\nthis, we may join with the poet in saying—\r\n\r\n                 “Well, honored be the graves that close\r\n                    O’er every brave and true heart,\r\n                  And sorrows sanctified repose\r\n                    Thy dust, discrownèd Stuart!”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n  Irish Army Retires on “The Line of the Shannon”—Douglas Repulsed at\r\n   Athlone—King William Begins Siege of Limerick—Sarsfield’s Exploit\r\n\r\n\r\nTYRCONNEL, Sarsfield, Berwick, De Lauzun, and their forces immediately\r\nevacuated Dublin and its neighborhood, and, practically, gave up all of\r\nLeinster to the enemy, while they retired on the Shannon and heavily\r\ngarrisoned Athlone, Limerick, and Galway—the latter a most important\r\nseaport at that time. The flight of James demoralized Tyrconnel, who was\r\naging fast, and further discontented Lauzun, but Sarsfield and Berwick\r\nremained steadfast, and were determined not to give up Ireland without a\r\nbitter and bloody struggle. Most of the officers agreed with them. If\r\nthey had lost a king, their country still remained, and they would\r\ndefend it to the last.\r\n\r\nWilliam’s first attempt was made against Athlone, which is the most\r\ncentral fortified place in Ireland, situated masterfully on the river\r\nShannon, the commerce of which it commands for many miles. The garrison\r\nwas commanded by an aged veteran of the Confederate war, Colonel Richard\r\nGrace, to whom fear was unknown. General Douglas, with 12,000 men and a\r\nfine battering train, including several mortars, was detached from the\r\nWilliamite army at Dublin to attack the town. He appeared before it on\r\nJuly 17, and sent an offensive message for immediate surrender to the\r\ngovernor. Colonel Grace discharged a pistol over the head of the\r\nstartled envoy, and said: “That is my answer!” The siege began when the\r\nmessenger returned. Athlone, divided by the Shannon, is partly in\r\nWestmeath and partly in Roscommon. The latter portion alone was\r\ndefensible. Colonel Grace abandoned the Leinster side, called\r\n“Englishtown,” after leveling the works. He also destroyed the bridge,\r\nthus confining himself to “Irishtown,” where still stands the strong\r\ncastle. Douglas bombarded it furiously. Grace responded fiercely and\r\nhonors were about even, when news arrived in the English camp that\r\nSarsfield, at the head of a powerful Irish force, was en route from\r\nLimerick to raise the siege. For seven days the English general rained\r\nballs and bombshells on Athlone, but, on the seventh day, the\r\nindomitable Grace hung out a red flag on the castle, to indicate that\r\nthe fight was to be to a finish, and that quarter would be neither taken\r\nnor given. The English doubled their efforts to subdue the place, but\r\nmade no impression. Finally Douglas, in abject fear of Sarsfield, raised\r\nthe siege and left the town amid the cheers of the defenders of the\r\nConnaught side. The garrison and people gave Governor Grace an ovation,\r\nwhich, indeed, no warrior, young or old, better deserved.\r\n\r\nKing William reserved for himself, as he thought, the honor and pleasure\r\nof capturing Limerick, which, in the days of Ireton, had won celebrity\r\nby the obstinacy of its defence. Toward the end of July, 1690, he\r\nmarched from the capital, at the head of his main army, toward that\r\nfortress. He was joined by the defeated Douglas, with his depleted\r\ndivision, at Caherconlish, within a short distance of Limerick, on the\r\n8th of August. This junction brought his force up to 38,000 men, not to\r\nspeak of a siege train and other warlike appliances. The Irish force\r\nconsisted of 10,000 infantry within the city, and 4,000 horse, encamped\r\non the Clare side of the Shannon. There was, as at Athlone, an Irishtown\r\nand Englishtown—the former situated on the Limerick side of the stream,\r\nand the latter on an island, called King’s Island, formed by the two\r\nbranches of the great river. In addition to an infantry force, some\r\nregiments of Irish dragoons, intended to fight either on foot or\r\nhorseback, occupied Englishtown. The defences were in a wretched\r\ncondition. Lauzun, who seems to have been the wet blanket of the period,\r\ndeclared that “King Louis could take them with roasted apples.”\r\nTyrconnel and he were for surrendering the city “on terms,” but\r\nSarsfield, ably seconded by the brave and youthful Duke of Berwick—the\r\nbest of the Stuarts—made fierce protest. De Boisseleau, a French officer\r\nof engineers, who sympathized with the Irish people, became their ally,\r\nand agreed to reconstruct the works, with the aid of the soldiery and\r\nthe citizens. De Lauzun, eager to return to the delights of Paris,\r\nabandoned the city and marched with his French contingent to Galway. It\r\nwould appear, from contemporaneous accounts, that his troops were not\r\nall native Frenchmen. Many were Swiss and German—a kind of Foreign\r\nLegion in the French service. Louvois, the elder, at that time Louis’s\r\nMinister of War, detested Lauzun—King James’s appointee—and would not\r\ngive him a corps of choice troops. The Swiss and Germans were courageous\r\nsoldiers, but their hearts were not in the cause they were engaged in,\r\nand many of them deserted to the Williamites after the battle of the\r\nBoyne. Lauzun remained in Galway until he heard of King William’s\r\nunsuccessful attempt on Limerick, when he and his forces sailed for\r\nFrance, the old Duke of Tyrconnel accompanying them. The Duke, on\r\nreaching Paris, made charges of insubordination and general misconduct\r\nagainst Lauzun, who, thereby, lost the favor of the French monarch. His\r\ndownfall followed, and, in after years, he was one of the unfortunates\r\ndoomed to captivity in the Bastile. He deserves no sympathy, as his\r\nwhole conduct in Ireland made him more than suspected of having been a\r\ntraitor.\r\n\r\nJohn C. O’Callaghan, the noted historian of the Williamite wars, in his\r\n“Green Book,” written in refutation of Voltaire, Lord Macaulay, and\r\nother libelers of the Irish nation, says that the Louvois, father and\r\nson, who held in succession the portfolio of war in France, during the\r\ntime when James was struggling to regain his crown, were inimical to his\r\ncause, and did all they could to thwart the friendly efforts of King\r\nLouis in his behalf. Louvois, Sr., it is explained, wished the command\r\nof the French troops sent to Ireland conferred upon his son; but James\r\npreferred Lauzun. Thus originated the feud which, no doubt, led to the\r\nutter ruin of the Stuart dynasty. The hostility of the Louvois also\r\nexplains the miserable quality of the arms, equipments, and clothing\r\nsent by the French Government to Ireland. How fatal a choice James made\r\nin preferring Lauzun has already appeared. By universal consent, De\r\nBoisseleau was made military governor of Limerick. Berwick, in the\r\nabsence of Tyrconnel, was recognized as commander-in-chief, mainly\r\nbecause of his kinship with the king, while the able and trusty\r\nSarsfield was second in command, and, as will be seen, did the lion’s\r\nshare of the fighting. King William, with his formidable army, arrived\r\nwithin sight of Limerick and “sat down before it” on August 9, confining\r\nhis attentions mostly to the southern defences of Irishtown, which\r\nappeared to offer the most favorable point of assault. Although he had\r\nwith him a powerful artillery, he did not hope to reduce the city\r\nwithout a further supply of heavy ordnance. Before leaving the Irish\r\ncapital, he had ordered a great siege train to be put in readiness, so\r\nthat it might reach him about the time he would be ready to begin the\r\ninvestment of Limerick. He knew, therefore, that it was near at hand.\r\nBut another soldier, even bolder than himself, knew also of the close\r\napproach of the siege train from Dublin, and that it was escorted by a\r\nstrong cavalry force. This was Sarsfield, who, at the head of five\r\nhundred chosen horse, left the camp on the Clare side of the river on\r\nSunday night, August 10, rode along the right bank toward Killaloe, and,\r\nnear that town, crossed into the County Tipperary by a deep and\r\ndangerous ford, seldom used and never guarded. He chose it in preference\r\nto the bridge at Killaloe, because the utmost secrecy had to be\r\npreserved, so that the Williamites might have no information of his\r\ndesign to intercept the train. His guide was a captain of irregular\r\nhorse—called Rapparees—and he bore the sobriquet of “Galloping O’Hogan.”\r\nDawn found the adventurous force in the neighborhood of the picturesque\r\nvillage of Silvermines, at the foot of the Keeper Mountain. In the deep\r\nglen, which runs along its eastern base, Sarsfield concealed his party\r\nall day of the 11th; but sent his scouts, under O’Hogan, southward\r\ntoward the County Limerick border, to locate the siege train. The\r\npeasantry of the locality still point out the exact spot where the Irish\r\ngeneral awaited impatiently, and anxiously, news from the scouts. The\r\nhorses were kept saddled up, ready for immediate action, and, while they\r\ngrazed, the men held their bridle-reins. Pickets were posted behind the\r\ncrests of every vantage point, to prevent surprise, because the patrols\r\nof King William’s army were ceaseless in their vigilance and might come\r\nupon the bold raiders at any moment. The scouts returned at nightfall\r\nand reported that the siege train and its escort had gone into camp near\r\nthe castle of Ballyneety, about two miles from the village of Cullen, in\r\nthe County Limerick, and twelve miles, by English measurement, in rear\r\nof the Williamite army. Sarsfield immediately put his troops in motion,\r\nand, after a laborious journey, reached the neighborhood of the rock and\r\nruined castle of Ballyneety some hours before daybreak. The convoy,\r\nthinking itself secure, kept a careless look-out, and, besides,\r\nSarsfield, in some mysterious manner, secured the password, which\r\nhappened to be his own name. Tradition of the neighborhood says that, as\r\nhe approached the camp, the noise of the horses’ hoofs startled one of\r\nthe English sentinels, who, immediately, leveled his piece at the Irish\r\nleader, and demanded the password. “Sarsfield is the word!” replied the\r\ngeneral, “and Sarsfield is the man!” Before the sentry could fire off\r\nhis musket, he was cloven down, and, at a fierce gallop, the Irish horse\r\nfell upon the sleeping escort, nearly all of whom were sabred on the\r\nspot. The captured cannon, charged with powder to their full extent,\r\nwere placed, muzzle downward, over a mine filled with the same\r\nexplosive, and the tin boats of a pontoon train, which was also bound\r\nfor William’s camp, were piled up near them. The Irish force, humanely\r\ntaking the English wounded with them, drew away to witness the result of\r\nthe coming explosion with greater security. Soon all was ready; the\r\ntrain was ignited, and cannon and pontoons were blown into the sky. The\r\nreport was heard and the shock felt for twenty miles around, and\r\nstartled even the phlegmatic King William in his tent. He divined at\r\nonce, with military sagacity, what had taken place. There was no\r\nmistaking it. Already, on the information of an Irish Williamite, named\r\nManus O’Brien, who had accidentally encountered Sarsfield’s cavalcade on\r\nthe Clare side, the king had sent Sir John Lanier, with five hundred\r\ndragoons, to the rescue. Sarsfield eluded the latter and got back to his\r\ncamp, recrossing the Shannon much higher up than Killaloe, without the\r\nloss of a man. When the news was confirmed to King William, by General\r\nLanier, he said, simply, “It was a bold movement. I did not think\r\nSarsfield capable of it.” Some authors affirm that Sarsfield himself\r\nsaid to a wounded English officer, whom he had captured, “If this\r\nenterprise had failed, I should have gone to France.” He was destined to\r\ndo other stout service for Ireland before he finally shed his life-blood\r\nfor the French lilies on a Belgian battlefield.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n  William’s Assault on Limerick Repulsed with Slaughter—Heroism of the\r\n           Irish Women—Irish Humanity to the English Wounded\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM was not discouraged by the loss of his siege material. He found\r\nthat two of the cannon captured by Sarsfield had failed to explode. Some\r\nheavy pieces, with mortars, also reached him, within a few days, from\r\nWaterford, and these, with the ordnance he had brought with him from\r\nDublin, made a formidable array of breach-producing engines. The siege,\r\naccordingly, was vigorously pressed, as against the Irishtown and King’s\r\nIsland, but hardly any demonstration was made against the Clare section,\r\nconnected with Limerick by Thomond bridge, probably because of the loss\r\nof the pontoon train.\r\n\r\nThe Irish soldiery and the citizens of Limerick, encouraged by De\r\nBoisseleau, Berwick, and Sarsfield, had made considerable improvement in\r\nthe defences of Limerick before William came up, and, even after his\r\narrival, continued to repair the breaches made in the walls by his\r\ncannon. Their batteries vigorously replied to those of the enemy,\r\nalthough much inferior in number and weight of metal, and the\r\nWilliamites suffered quite heavy losses in officers and rank and file.\r\nThe Irish leaders had sent many non-combatants to the safer side of the\r\nShannon, but most of the women refused to leave and worked at the\r\nearthworks like the men. Many of them were killed by the English fire\r\nwhile so occupied.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the morning of August 27, the Williamite engineers declared\r\nthe breach in the neighborhood of St. John’s Gate and the Black Battery\r\non the south side of the town practicable. Some authorities say it was\r\ntwelve yards wide, and others, including Thomas Davis, one of Ireland’s\r\nmost accurate writers, six perches, which would make quite a difference.\r\nFive hundred British grenadiers, drawn from the right flank companies of\r\nthe line regiments, as was then and for long afterward the custom,\r\nconstituted the forlorn hope. Their immediate reserves were a battalion\r\nof the Blue Dutch Guards—the heroes of the Boyne—and the regiments of\r\nDouglas, Stuart, Meath, Lisburn, and Brandenburg. The whole army stood\r\nready to support these picked troops. The signal, three cannon shots,\r\nwas given from Cromwell’s Fort, where William witnessed the operation,\r\nat 3.30 P.M. Story tells us the day was torrid. The orders to the\r\nstormers were to seize the Irish counterscarp—the exterior slope of the\r\nditch—and maintain it. The assault was delivered with great spirit, the\r\ngrenadiers leaping out of their trenches, advancing at a run, firing\r\ntheir pieces and throwing their hand grenades among the Irish in the\r\nworks. The attack was fierce and sudden—almost in the nature of a\r\nsurprise—but the Irish met it boldly, for, says Chaplain Story, in his\r\nthrilling narrative of the event, “they had their guns all ready and\r\ndischarged great and small shot on us as fast as ‘twas possible. Our men\r\nwere not behind them in either, so that, in less than two minutes, the\r\nnoise was so terrible that one would have thought the very skies ready\r\nto rent in sunder. This was seconded with dust, smoke, and all the\r\nterrors the art of man could invent to ruin and undo one another; and,\r\nto make it more uneasie, the day itself was so excessive hot to the\r\nbystanders, and much more, sure, in all respects to those upon action.\r\nCaptain Carlile, of my Lord Drogheda’s regiment, ran on with his\r\ngrenadiers to the counterscarp, and tho’ he received two wounds between\r\nthat and the trenches, yet he went forward and commanded his men to\r\nthrow in their grenades, but in the leaping into the dry ditch below the\r\ncounterscarp an Irishman below shot him dead. Lieutenant Barton,\r\nhowever, encouraged the men and they got upon the counterscarp, and all\r\nthe rest of the grenadiers were as ready as they.”\r\n\r\nIt would seem that, at this point of the attack, some of the Irish\r\nsoldiers began to draw off and made for the breach, which the\r\nWilliamites entered with them. Half of the Drogheda regiment and some\r\nothers actually got into the town. The city seemed nearly won, as the\r\nsupports came up promptly to the assistance of their comrades. But the\r\nIrish troops rallied immediately and fell vehemently on their pursuers.\r\nThese, in their turn, retreated from the breach, “but some were shot,\r\nsome were taken, and some came out again, but very few without being\r\nwounded.” The Williamite chaplain thus describes the outcome, still\r\npreserving his tone of contemptuous hatred of the brave Irish soldiery:\r\n“The Irish then ventured (_sic_) upon the breach again, and from the\r\nwalls and every place so pestered us upon the counterscarp, that after\r\nnigh three hours resisting bullets, stones (broken bottles from the very\r\nwomen, who boldly stood in the breach and were nearer our men than their\r\nown), and whatever ways could be thought on to destroy us, our\r\nammunition being spent, it was judged safest to return to our trenches!\r\nWhen the work was at the hottest, the Brandenburg regiment (who behaved\r\nthemselves very well) were got upon the Black Battery, where the\r\nenemies’ powder happened to take fire and blew up a great many of them,\r\nthe men, fagots, stones, and what not flying into the air with a most\r\nterrible noise.... From half an hour after three, until after seven,\r\nthere was one continued fire of both great and small shot, without any\r\nintermission; in so much that the smoke that went from the town reached\r\nin one continued cloud to the top of a mountain [Keeper Hill, most\r\nlikely] at least six miles off. When our men drew off, some were brought\r\nup dead, and some without a leg; others wanted arms, and some were blind\r\nwith powder; especially a great many of the poor Brandenburgers looked\r\nlike furies, with the misfortune of gunpowder.... The king [William]\r\nstood nigh Cromwell’s Fort all the time, and the business being over, he\r\nwent to his camp very much concerned, as, indeed, was the whole army;\r\nfor you might have seen a mixture of anger and sorrow in every bodie’s\r\ncountenance. The Irish had two small field-pieces planted in the King’s\r\nIsland, which flankt their own counterscarp, and in our attack did us no\r\nsmall damage, as did, also, two guns more that they had planted within\r\nthe town, opposite to the breach and charged with cartridge shot.\r\n\r\n“We lost, at least, five hundred on the spot, and had a thousand more\r\nwounded, as I understood by the surgeons of our hospitals, who are the\r\nproperest judges. The Irish lost a great many by our cannon and other\r\nways, but it can not be supposed that their loss should be equal to\r\nours, since it is a much easier thing to defend walls than ’tis by plain\r\nstrength to force people from them, and one man within has the advantage\r\nof four without.”\r\n\r\nMr. Story acknowledges fifty-nine officers of the English regiments\r\nengaged killed and wounded. Fifteen died upon the ground and several\r\nafterward of their injuries. “The Grenadiers are not here included,”\r\ncontinues the English annalist, “and they had the hottest service; nor\r\nare there any of the foreigners, who lost full as many as the English.”\r\n\r\nWe have quoted this English authority, prejudiced though he was, because\r\nthe testimony of an eye-witness is much more valuable than the\r\nallegations of writers who give their information at second hand. We may\r\nadd, however, that all Irish historians have declared that the Black\r\nBattery was mined for such an emergency as destroyed the Brandenburg\r\nregiment, and some of them assert that Sarsfield, in person, fired the\r\nmine. As he was the Ajax of the campaign, on the Irish side, it seems\r\nquite natural that every extraordinary feat of skill or valor should\r\nhave been credited to him. His own merits made him the idol of his\r\npeople, and he was farther endeared to them, as being the son of Anna\r\nO’More, daughter of the famous organizer of the Irish insurrection of\r\n1641. On the paternal side, he was of Norman stock. His father had been\r\na member of the Irish House of Commons, and was proscribed and exiled\r\nbecause he had sided with the patriots in the Parliamentary wars.\r\nGeneral Sarsfield—the rank he held at the first siege of Limerick—had\r\nseen hot service on the Continent, during the early part of his career,\r\nand commanded a regiment of the royal cavalry at the battle of\r\nSedgemoor, where the unfortunate Duke of Monmouth met with his fatal\r\ndefeat at the hands of Lord Feversham. In stature, he was\r\ntall—considerably over six feet—fair and strikingly handsome. His\r\nflowing wig—in the queer fashion of the period—fell in massive ringlets\r\nover the corselet of a cuirassier, and, in the rush of battle, he must\r\nhave been the counterpart of Murat, Napoleon’s “Emperor of Dragoons.”\r\nIrish poets have called him “headlong Sarsfield.” “Long-headed\r\nSarsfield” would have been a better sobriquet, for, had his advice been\r\ntaken by his royal master and the generals sent by the latter to command\r\nover him, Ireland would never have bowed her head to the yoke of\r\nWilliam. Even the most envenomed of English historians against the\r\nadherents of King James—including Lord Macaulay—do ample justice to the\r\ncourage, talents, and virtues of Patrick Sarsfield.\r\n\r\nThe heroic women of Limerick, who fought and bled in the breach, are\r\ncomplimented by Chaplain Story, as we have seen, at the expense of their\r\ncountrymen, but the glorious military record of the Irish race in the\r\nwars of Europe and of this continent, since that period, would make any\r\ndefence of the conduct of the heroes of Limerick-breach superfluous. The\r\nwomen, too, deserve immortal honor; because, in defence of their country\r\nand hearthstones, they dared the storm of war, and “stalked with\r\nMinerva’s step where Mars might quake to tread.”\r\n\r\nThe Irish loss in killed and wounded was about four hundred. Many lives,\r\non both sides, were lost by sickness—dysentery and enteric fever\r\nchiefly—during this siege. A conservative estimate places William’s\r\nloss, by wounds and sickness, at 5,000, and the Irish at 3,000.\r\n\r\nThe day after his bloody repulse, King William sent a flag of truce to\r\nDe Boisseleau asking the privilege of burying his dead. After\r\nconsultation with Berwick and Sarsfield, the French governor refused the\r\nrequest, as he suspected a ruse of some kind behind it. All the dead\r\nwere buried by the Irish as quickly as possible, because the heat was\r\nintense, and, aside from feelings of humanity, they dreaded a plague\r\nfrom the decomposition of the corpses left above ground. We are informed\r\nby the late Mr. A. M. Sullivan, M.P., in his admirable “Story of\r\nIreland,” that, during the pursuit by the Irish of King William’s men\r\nfrom the breach to their trenches, the temporary hospital established by\r\nthe king for his wounded caught fire. The Irish troops immediately\r\npaused in their fierce pursuit, and devoted themselves to saving their\r\nhelpless foes in the hospital, who, otherwise, must have perished\r\nmiserably in the flames.\r\n\r\nKing William, after carefully considering the situation, and taking\r\ncounsel with his chief officers, decided that there was no hope of\r\ncapturing Limerick that year. Therefore, he declared the siege\r\nraised—that is, abandoned—and, on August 30th, the entire Williamite\r\narmy drew off from before Limerick, posting strong rear-guards at points\r\nof vantage, so as to baffle pursuit. The king, leaving Baron De Ginkel\r\nin command, retired to Waterford. There he embarked for England, bidding\r\nIreland what proved to be an eternal farewell. Although this gloomy\r\nmonarch was not quite as ferocious as some of his contemporaries, and\r\nwas a marked improvement on Cromwell, Ireton, and Ludlow in Ireland, he\r\nis charged by careful Irish historians—like McGee, O’Callaghan, and\r\nSullivan—with having, like his lieutenant, General Douglas, permitted\r\nmany outrages on the people, both in person and property, on his march\r\nfrom Dublin to Limerick. Making due allowance for the difficulty of\r\nrestraining a mercenary army, filled with hatred of the people they\r\nmoved among, from committing excesses, it is regrettable that the\r\nmartial renown of William of Orange is sullied by this charge of cruelty\r\nin Ireland, as, afterward, in connection with the foul massacre of the\r\nMacdonalds of Glencoe in Scotland. Brave men are rarely cruel, but we\r\nfear, in these instances, William was an exception to the rule.\r\n\r\nThe story of the first defence of Limerick, in the Williamite war, reads\r\nlike a chapter from a military romance, and yet it was, indeed, a stern\r\nand bloody reality. It was, in truth, a magnificent defence against a\r\npowerful foe, not surpassed even by that of Saragossa against the\r\nFrench. Limerick, like Saragossa, was defended by the citizens, men and\r\nwomen, quite as much as by the soldiery. All took equal risks, as in the\r\ncase of Londonderry. The latter was also a brilliant defence—more,\r\nhowever, in the matter of splendid endurance than in hand-to-hand\r\nconflict. Londonderry wears the crown for fortitude and\r\ntenacity—Limerick and Saragossa for heroic prowess and matchless\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n Fall of Cork and Kinsale—Lauzun, the French General, Accused by Irish\r\n  Writers—Sarsfield’s Popularity—Tyrconnel Returns to Ireland—Berwick\r\n                                Departs\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE successful defence of Limerick by the Irish was somewhat offset in\r\nthe following month of September by the victorious expedition from\r\nEngland, against Cork and Kinsale, led by John Churchill, afterward Duke\r\nof Marlborough, the greatest general of that age. Cork, under the\r\nmilitary governor, McEligott, defended itself vigorously during a siege\r\nof five days, but the defences and garrison were both weak, and,\r\neventually, the city capitulated on honorable conditions. These were\r\nsubsequently violated by some soldiers and camp-followers of the English\r\narmy, but Marlborough suppressed, in as far as he could, the disorders\r\nas soon as he heard of them. The English lost the Duke of\r\nGrafton—natural son of Charles II—and many other officers and private\r\nmen during the siege. Marlborough, with characteristic promptitude,\r\nmoved at once on Kinsale. The old town and fort, not being defensible,\r\nwere, after some show of resistance, abandoned by the Irish troops, who\r\ntook post in the new fort, commanding the harbor, which they held with\r\ncreditable tenacity, during fourteen days. They, at last, capitulated,\r\ntheir ammunition having run low, and were allowed, in recognition of\r\ntheir valor, to retire to Limerick, the garrison in that city being thus\r\naugmented by 1,200 tried warriors. Marlborough accomplished his task\r\nwithin five weeks, and returned to England a popular idol. The loss of\r\nCork and Kinsale, particularly the latter, was a severe blow to the\r\nIrish army, as it was, thereby, deprived of the most favorable seaports\r\nby which supplies from France could reach it. It should have been stated\r\nthat Marlborough, in the capture of those towns, was materially assisted\r\nby the English fleet. His army was a very formidable one, consisting of\r\n9,000 picked men from England, and a detachment, nearly equal in\r\nnumbers, which joined him, under the Duke of Wurtemburg and General\r\nScravenmore. The latter body consisted of troops who had fought at the\r\nBoyne and Limerick. Wurtemburg, on account of his connection with\r\nroyalty, claimed the command in chief. Marlborough, who was as great a\r\ndiplomat as he was a general, agreed to command alternately, but he was,\r\nall through the operations, the real commander. Students of history will\r\nremember that, in after wars on the Continent, Marlborough and Prince\r\nEugene of Savoy commanded on alternate days. But there was a great\r\ndifference in this case, Eugene having been regarded as nearly as good a\r\ngeneral as Marlborough himself.\r\n\r\nO’Callaghan attributes the failure of the main Irish army to succor the\r\nCork and Kinsale garrisons to the misconduct of Lauzun in deserting\r\nIreland, with his remaining 5,000 French troops, at this critical\r\nperiod. He quotes King James’s and Berwick’s memoirs, the Rawdon papers,\r\nand other authorities, to show that the Duke of Berwick had advanced\r\nwith 7,000 men as far as Kilmallock, in Limerick County, to raise the\r\nsiege of Cork, when he found himself destitute of cannon, which had been\r\ncarried off by the French general, and could not expose his inferior\r\nforce, destitute of artillery, to the formidable force under his uncle,\r\nMarlborough. He was, therefore, most reluctantly compelled to abandon\r\nthe enterprise. Lauzun, it is further claimed, carried off most of the\r\npowder stored in Limerick, and, had it not been for Sarsfield’s exploit\r\nat Ballyneety, that city must have fallen if a second assault had been\r\ndelivered by William, as only fifty barrels of powder remained after the\r\nfight of August 27th.\r\n\r\nThe autumn and winter of 1690-91 were marked by constant bloody\r\nskirmishes between the cavalry and infantry outposts of the two armies.\r\nHardly a day passed without bloodshed. Considerable ferocity was\r\nexhibited by both parties, and neither seemed to have much the advantage\r\nof the other. Story’s narrative of this period is one unbroken tale of\r\ndisorder and strife. His narration, if taken without a grain of salt,\r\nwould lead us to believe that nearly all the able-bodied Celtic-Irish\r\nwere put to the sword, at sight, by his formidable countrymen and their\r\nallies, although he does admit, occasionally, that the Irish succeeded\r\nin killing a few, at least, of their enemies. The most considerable of\r\nthese lesser engagements occurred between Sarsfield and the Duke of\r\nBerwick on the Irish side and General Douglas and Sir John Lanier on the\r\nside of the Williamites. The Irish leaders made an attack on Birr Castle\r\nin September, and were engaged in battering it, when the English, under\r\nLanier, Douglas, and Kirk, marched to relieve it. They were too many for\r\nBerwick and Sarsfield, who retired on Banagher, where there is a bridge\r\nover the Shannon. The English pursued and made a resolute attempt to\r\ntake the bridge, but the Irish defended it so steadily, and with such\r\nloss to the enemy, that the latter abandoned the attempt at capture and\r\nretired to Birr. Sarsfield possessed one great advantage over all the\r\nhigher officers of King James’s army. He could speak the Irish (Gaelic)\r\nlanguage fluently, having learned it from the lips of his mother, Anna\r\nO’More. This gave him vast control over the Celtic peasantry, who fully\r\ntrusted him, as he did them, and they kept him informed of all that was\r\npassing in their several localities. The winter was exceptionally\r\nsevere—so much so that, at some points, the deep and rapid Shannon was\r\nall but frozen across. Besides, there were several bridges that, if\r\ncarelessly guarded, could be easily surprised and taken by the invaders.\r\nSarsfield’s Celtic scouts, in December, observed several parties of\r\nBritish cavalry moving along the banks of the river. Their suspicions\r\nwere excited, and they, at once, communicated with their general. The\r\nlatter had no sooner taken the alarm than one English force, under\r\nDouglas, showed itself at Jamestown, and another, under Kirk and Lanier,\r\nat Jonesboro. The English commanders were astonished at finding the\r\nIrish army prepared to receive them warmly at both points. After severe\r\nskirmishing, they withdrew. The cold had become so severe that foreign\r\ntroops were almost useless, while the Irish became, if possible, more\r\nalert. Sarsfield, at the head of his formidable cavalry, harassed the\r\nretreat of the Williamites to their winter quarters.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Tyrconnel, who had, according to O’Callaghan, and other\r\nannalists, sailed from Galway with Lauzun, and, according to other\r\nauthorities from Limerick, with De Boisseleau, after William’s repulse,\r\nreturned from France, in February, accompanied by three men-of-war well\r\nladen with provisions. They carried but few arms and no reinforcements,\r\nbut the aged duke, who seemed to be in good spirits, said that the\r\nlatter would speedily follow. The amount of money he brought with him\r\nwas comparatively insignificant—only 14,000 louis d’or—which he devoted\r\nto clothing for the army, as most of the men were nearly in rags, and\r\nhad received no pay in many months. He had deposited 10,000 louis,\r\nadditional, at Brest for the food supply of the troops.\r\n\r\nHe found unholy discord raging in the Irish ranks. Sarsfield had\r\ndiscovered that some members of the Senate, or Council, appointed by\r\nTyrconnel before he left for France, had been in treasonable\r\ncorrespondence with the enemy, and that this treachery had led to the\r\nattempt at the passage of the Shannon made by the English in December.\r\nThe Council consisted of sixteen members, four from each province, and\r\nwas supposed to have supreme direction of affairs. Through the influence\r\nof Sarsfield, Lord Riverston and his brother, both of whom were strongly\r\nsuspected of treason, were dismissed from that body, and Judge Daly,\r\nanother member, whose honesty was doubted, was placed under arrest in\r\nthe city of Galway. A difference had also arisen between Sarsfield and\r\nBerwick, although they were generally on good terms, because the former\r\ndid not always treat the latter with the deference due an officer higher\r\nin rank. Berwick was an admirable soldier, but he lacked Sarsfield’s\r\nexperience, and, naturally, did not understand the Irish people quite as\r\nwell as the native leader did. In fact, Sarsfield was the hero of the\r\ntime in the eyes of his countrymen, and, had he been unduly ambitious,\r\nmight have deposed Berwick, or even Tyrconnel, and made himself\r\ndictator. But he was too good a patriot and true a soldier to even\r\nharbor such a thought. After all his splendid services, he was\r\nungratefully treated. He deserved the chief command, but it was never\r\ngiven him, and he received, instead, the barren title of Earl of Lucan,\r\nthe patent of which had been brought over from James by Tyrconnel. But\r\nit was gall and wormwood for Sarsfield to learn from the duke that a\r\nFrench commander-in-chief, Lieutenant-General the Marquis de St. Ruth,\r\nhad been chosen by Louis and James to take charge of military matters in\r\nIreland forthwith. Already he ranked below Tyrconnel and Berwick,\r\nalthough having much more ability than the two combined, as he had\r\nproven on many occasions.\r\n\r\nGeneral St. Ruth, if we are to believe Lord Macaulay and other\r\nWilliamite partisans, was more distinguished for fierce persecution of\r\nthe French Protestants, called Huguenots, than anything else in his\r\ncareer. He had served in the French army, in all its campaigns, under\r\nTurenne, Catinat, and other celebrated soldiers, since 1667, and, while\r\nyet in vigorous middle life, had won the rank of lieutenant-general. He\r\nhad married the widow of old Marshal De Meilleraye, whose page he had\r\nbeen in his boyhood, and, according to St. Simon’s gossipy memoirs, the\r\ncouple led a sort of cat-and-dog existence, the king having been often\r\ncompelled to interfere between them. Of St. Ruth’s person, St. Simon\r\nsays: “He was tall and well-formed, but, as everybody knew, extremely\r\nugly.” The same authority says the general was “of a brutal temper,” and\r\nused to baton his wife whenever she annoyed him. It is well known that\r\nSt. Simon was a venomous detractor of those who had incurred his\r\nresentment, or that of his friends, and this may account for his\r\nuncomplimentary references to St. Ruth. Irish tradition says that the\r\nlatter was hard-featured, but of commanding person, with a piercing\r\nglance and a voice like a trumpet. It is certain that he had an\r\nimperious disposition and was quick to fly into a rage. When appointed\r\nto the command in Ireland, he had just returned from a successful\r\ncampaign in Savoy, where Mountcashel’s Irish Brigade, as already stated,\r\nhad formed a portion of his victorious forces. He had learned to\r\nappreciate Irish courage and constancy during that campaign, and was, on\r\nthat account as much as any other, deemed the fit man to lead the Irish\r\nsoldiers on their own soil to victory.\r\n\r\nTyrconnel had accepted St. Ruth from Louis and James, because he could\r\nnot help himself, and, also, because he was jealous of Sarsfield. The\r\nviceroy was no longer popular in Ireland. He was aged, infirm, and\r\nincompetent, and it would seem his temper had grown so bad that he could\r\nnot get along peaceably with anybody. One faction from the Irish camp\r\nhad sent representatives to James in the palace of St. Germain, begging\r\nthat Tyrconnel be recalled and the command placed in the hands of\r\nSarsfield. But Tyrconnel, because of old association, was all-powerful\r\nwith the exiled king, and his cause, therefore, prevailed. Soon\r\nafterward the gallant Duke of Berwick, who subsequently won the battle\r\nof Almanza and placed Philip V—King Louis’s grandson—on the throne of\r\nSpain, unable to agree with either Tyrconnel or Sarsfield, was relieved\r\nof command in Ireland and joined his father in France. This was an\r\nadditional misfortune for Ireland. Berwick, the nephew of the great Duke\r\nof Marlborough, was, both by nature and training, a thorough soldier. He\r\nwas the very soul of bravery, and could put enthusiasm into an Irish\r\narmy by his dashing feats of arms. He was missed in the subsequent\r\nbattles and sieges of that war. His career in the French army was long\r\nand brilliant. After rising to the rank of marshal, he was killed by a\r\ncannon shot while superintending the siege of Philipsburg, in 1734. The\r\naristocratic French family of Fitzjames is lineally descended from the\r\nDuke of Berwick, and that house, although of illegitimate origin,\r\nrepresents the male Stuart line, just as the House of Beaufort, in\r\nEngland, represents, with the bend sinister shadowing its escutcheon,\r\nthe male line of the Plantagenets. Strange to say, the Duke of Berwick’s\r\ngreat qualities as a general were not even suspected by his associates,\r\neither French, English, or Irish, in Ireland. When Tyrconnel left him in\r\ncommand, leading officers of the Irish army declared that they would not\r\nserve, unless he consented to be governed by a council more national in\r\ncomposition than that nominated by Tyrconnel. After some strong\r\nprotests, Berwick yielded the point, but never afterward made any\r\nattempt at bona-fide command. He felt that he was but a figurehead, and\r\nwas glad when Tyrconnel’s return led to his recall from a position at\r\nonce irksome and humiliating. Had he been King James’s legitimate son,\r\nthe House of Stuart would probably have found in him a restorer. He\r\ninherited the Churchill genius from his mother, Arabella, who was King\r\nJames’s mistress when that monarch was Duke of York. She was not\r\nhandsome of feature, but her figure was perfect, and the deposed king,\r\nto judge by his selections, must have had a penchant for plain women.\r\nO’Callaghan, in his “History of the Irish Brigades,” says of the Duke of\r\nBerwick: “He was one of those commanders of whom it is the highest\r\neulogium to say that to such, in periods of adversity, it is safest to\r\nintrust the defence of a state. Of the great military leaders of whose\r\nparentage England can boast, he may be ranked with his uncle,\r\nMarlborough, among the first. But to his uncle, as to most public\r\ncharacters, be was very superior as a man of principle. The Regent Duke\r\nof Orleans, whose extensive acquaintance with human nature attaches a\r\nsuitable value to his opinion, observed: ‘If there ever was a perfectly\r\nhonest man in the world, that man was the Marshal Duke of Berwick.’” We\r\nhave also the testimony of his French and other contemporaries that he\r\nwas a man of majestic appearance—much more “royal” in that respect than\r\nany other scion of his race.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 BOOK V\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORDING IMPORTANT EVENTS FROM THE ARRIVAL OF GENERAL ST. RUTH IN\r\nLIMERICK TO HIS GLORIOUS DEATH AT THE BATTLE OF AUGHRIM, IN JULY, 1691\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n   General St. Ruth Arrives at Limerick to Command the Irish Army—His\r\n       Marvelous Activity—Brave and Able, but Vain and Obstinate\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE garrison of Limerick was beginning to despair of any farther succor\r\nfrom France, and murmurs against the viceroy became loud and deep, when\r\nrunners arrived from the southwestern coast, announcing that a French\r\nfleet had been sighted off the Kerry coast, and that it was, probably,\r\nsteering for the estuary of the Shannon. This was in the first week of\r\nMay, and, on the 8th of that month, the French men-of-war cast anchor in\r\nthe harbor of Limerick. On board was Lieutenant-General St. Ruth, with\r\nMajor-General D’Usson, Major-General De Tesse, and other officers. He\r\nbrought with him, in the ships, provisions, a supply of indifferent\r\nclothing, and a quantity of ammunition, but no reinforcements of any\r\nkind. The general, however, had a large personal staff and a retinue of\r\nservants and orderlies. He was received, on landing, by Tyrconnel,\r\nSarsfield, Sheldon, and other army leaders. He and his officers attended\r\npontifical High Mass at St. Mary’s Cathedral, where Te Deum was chanted.\r\nMacaulay, a somewhat imaginative authority, informs us that St. Ruth was\r\ndisappointed, if not disgusted, by the conditions then existing in\r\nLimerick. He had been accustomed to command troops perfectly uniformed\r\nand equipped. The Irish army was poorly dressed and indifferently armed.\r\nHe had seen the splendid legions of Mountcashel in Savoy, dressed\r\nscrupulously and bearing the best arms of that day, and he was quite\r\nunprepared to behold the undeniable poverty of the brave defenders of\r\nAthlone and Limerick. But he was a practical soldier, and at once set\r\nabout what an American general would call “licking his army into shape.”\r\nDissatisfied with the cavalry mounts, he resorted to a ruse to supply\r\nthe deficiency. The “gentry” of the surrounding districts were summoned\r\nto King’s Island to deliberate on the question of national defence. They\r\ncame in large numbers—every man, as was the custom of the times, mounted\r\non a strong and spirited horse. When all had assembled, St. Ruth,\r\nthrough an interpreter, addressed them in spirited words. One of the\r\nchief needs of the hour was cavalry horses. The gentlemen were invited\r\nto dismount and turn over their horses to the public service. This most\r\nof them did cheerfully, while others were chagrined. However, St. Ruth\r\ngained his point, and the Irish troopers were as well mounted as any in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe new French general, although much given to pleasure, was a man of\r\nextraordinary energy. He gave balls to honor the country gentlemen and\r\ntheir families, and the French uniform became very familiar in all the\r\naristocratic Catholic circles of Munster and Connaught. St. Ruth\r\nparticipated in the dancing and feasting, but was always “up betimes,”\r\nand away on horseback, attended by his staff and interpreters, to\r\ninspect the posts held by the Irish along the Shannon and Suck. It was\r\nduring one of those rides, tradition says, he noticed the hill of\r\nKilcommodan, rising above the little hamlet of Aughrim, near\r\nBallinasloe, and, casting a glance at the position, exclaimed to his\r\nofficers, in French, “That is the choicest battleground in all Europe!”\r\nWe shall hear more about Aughrim, and what there befell Monsieur St.\r\nRuth and the Irish army.\r\n\r\nThat brave army, at Limerick, Athlone, and Galway, was put through a\r\ncourse of drilling, such as it had never received before, under the\r\norders of the ardent and indefatigable Frenchman. He repressed disorder\r\nwith an iron hand, and made such examples, under martial law, as seemed\r\nnecessary. It is said he was severe to his officers and contemptuous to\r\nthe rank and file of his army, but these assertions come mainly from\r\nChaplain Story and chroniclers of his class. The haughty Irish\r\naristocrats would have run St. Ruth through the body with their swords\r\nif he had dared to be insulting toward them. He was necessarily strict,\r\nno doubt, and this strictness bore glorious fruit when the reorganized\r\narmy again took the field. One of the chief embarrassments of the time\r\nwas lack of money. Lauzun, while in Ireland, had played into the hands\r\nof the English by crying down King James’s “brass money,” as it was\r\ncalled, issued on the national security. The poor devoted Irish soldiers\r\ntook it readily enough, but the trading and commercial classes, always\r\nsensitive and conservative where their interests are affected, were slow\r\nto take the tokens in exchange for their goods. King Louis had promised\r\na large supply of “good money,” but, somehow, it was not forthcoming,\r\nexcept in small parcels, which did little good. We may be sure, however,\r\nthat St. Ruth, accustomed to Continental forced loans, did not stand on\r\nceremony, and, under his vigorous régime, the Irish army was better\r\narmed, better fed, and better clad than it had been since the outbreak\r\nof the war. Old Tyrconnel ruled Ireland nominally. The real ruler, after\r\nhe had, by repeated representations and solicitations, obtained\r\nunrestricted military command, was St. Ruth himself. Unhappily for\r\nIreland, he slighted Tyrconnel, who was a very proud man, and did not\r\nget along smoothly with Sarsfield, whose sage advice, had he taken it,\r\nwould have saved him from a fatal disaster.\r\n\r\nBaron De Ginkel, commander-in-chief for William, marched with an army\r\ncomputed at 19,000 men from Dublin to open the campaign against the\r\nIrish on the line of the Shannon, on May 30, 1691. On June 7, he reached\r\nthe fort of Ballymore, held by a small Irish force under\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Ulick Burke, and summoned it to surrender. Burke\r\nanswered defiantly, and Ginkel immediately opened upon his works. A\r\ndetached post, held by a sergeant and a few men, was defended\r\ndesperately and caused the Williamites serious loss. It was finally\r\ncaptured, and De Ginkel, with inexcusable cruelty, hanged the brave\r\nsergeant, for doing his duty, as O’Callaghan says, on the shallow\r\npretext that he had defended an untenable position. Colonel Burke,\r\nnothing daunted, continued his defence of Ballymore, although Ginkel\r\nthreatened him with the unfortunate sergeant’s fate. The fire of\r\neighteen well-served pieces of heavy artillery speedily reduced the fort\r\nto a ruin. The Irish engineer officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Burton, was\r\nkilled, and many men had also fallen. Burke hung out a flag of truce and\r\ndemanded the honors of war if he were to surrender the place. Ginkel\r\nrefused and called for immediate submission. The utmost time he would\r\ngrant was two hours, and he agreed to allow the women and children to\r\ndepart within that period. Once he proceeded to storm the position, he\r\nsaid, the garrison need expect no quarter. Colonel Burke declined to be\r\nintimidated and the work of destruction began anew—the women and\r\nchildren still remaining in the beleaguered fort. The latter was\r\nsituated near the town of the same name, in the County Westmeath, on a\r\npeninsula which jutted into a small loch, or lake, and was too far from\r\nsupport to make a successful defence. It stood about midway between\r\nMullingar and Athlone on the road from Dublin. Finally, Ginkel managed\r\nto assail it on the water front, breaches were made, and further\r\nresistance was useless. Therefore, Governor Burke finally surrendered.\r\nHe and his command were made prisoners of war, and, in the sinister\r\nwords of Story, the four hundred women and children, destitute of food,\r\nshelter, and protection, were “set at liberty.” What subsequently became\r\nof them is not stated. Colonel Burke was exchanged and fell in battle,\r\nat Aughrim, soon afterward. Seven days were occupied by De Ginkel in\r\nagain putting Ballymore into a state of defence. He then resumed his\r\nmarch on Athlone, and, on June 18, was joined at Ballyburn Pass by the\r\nDuke of Wurtemburg and Count Nassau, at the head of 7,000 foreign\r\nmercenaries, and these, according to O’Callaghan, the most painstaking\r\nof historical statisticians, brought his force up to “between 26,000 and\r\n27,000 men of all arms.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n      De Ginkel Besieges Athlone—Memorable Resistance of the Irish\r\n  Garrison—The Battle at the Bridge—St. Ruth’s Fatuous Obstinacy—Town\r\n                           Taken by Surprise\r\n\r\n\r\nST. RUTH had been advised by the Irish officers of his staff not to\r\nattempt the defence of the “Englishtown” of Athlone, on the Leinster\r\nbank of the Shannon; but, rather, to confine himself to the defence of\r\nthe Connaught side, as Governor Grace had done so successfully in the\r\npreceding year. He paid no attention to their counsel, considering,\r\nafter reflection, that the Williamite army should be met and beaten back\r\nfrom the Englishtown, and believing that the bridge, which, in the event\r\nof abandonment, must be destroyed, might prove useful in future military\r\noperations. Accordingly, Colonel John Fitzgerald was appointed governor\r\nof this portion of Athlone, and, with a very insufficient force,\r\nprepared to do his duty. Ginkel, his well-fed ranks, according to\r\nMacaulay, “one blaze of scarlet,” and provided with the finest artillery\r\ntrain ever seen in Ireland, appeared before Athlone on the morning of\r\nJune 19th. His advance was most gallantly disputed and retarded by a\r\ndetachment of Irish grenadiers, selected by Governor Fitzgerald, for\r\nthat important duty. He took command of them in person, and they fought\r\nso bravely and obstinately, that the enemy were delayed in their\r\nprogress for several hours, so that the Irish garrison was well prepared\r\nto receive them, when they finally appeared within gunshot of the walls.\r\nThe attack on Englishtown began immediately, Ginkel planting such of his\r\ncannon as had already come up with great judgment; and Fitzgerald\r\nreplied to his fire with the few and inefficient pieces he possessed.\r\nBut his Irish soldiers performed prodigies of heroism. Their deeds of\r\nunsurpassed valor are thus summed up by Mr. O’Callaghan in an epitaph\r\nwhich he suggested, in his “Green Book,” should be engraved on a\r\nmemorial stone in the locality of the action to be revered by the Irish\r\npeople of all creeds and parties:\r\n\r\n“Be it remembered that, on the 19th and 20th of June, 1691, a little\r\nband, of between three hundred and four hundred Irishmen, under Colonel\r\nFitzgerald, contested against an English army of about 26,000 men, under\r\nLieutenant-General Ginkel, the passes leading to, and the English town\r\nof, Athlone. And though the place had but a slender wall, in which the\r\nenemy’s well-appointed and superior artillery soon made a large breach,\r\nand though its few defenders were worn down by forty-eight hours’\r\ncontinual exertion, they held out till the evening of the second day,\r\nwhen, the breach being assaulted by a fresh body of 4,000 Dutch, Danish,\r\nand English troops, selected from above 26,000 men, who fought in\r\nsuccessive detachments, against but three hundred or four hundred, with\r\nno fresh troops to relieve them, these gallant few did not abandon the\r\nbreach before above two hundred of their number were killed or disabled.\r\nThen, in spite of the enemy, the brave survivors made their way to the\r\nbridge over the Shannon, maintained themselves in front of it till they\r\ndemolished two arches behind them, and finally retired across the river\r\nby a drawbridge into the Irish town, which was preserved by their\r\nheroism till the coming up, soon after, of the Irish main army under\r\nLieutenant-General St. Ruth.”\r\n\r\nHaving at last attained possession of Englishtown, Baron De Ginkel\r\nproceeded without delay to bombard the Connaught, and stronger, section\r\nof Athlone. His cannonade knocked a portion of the grim old castle to\r\npieces, and did considerable other damage, but produced no depressing\r\neffect on the resolute Irish garrison, commanded by two such heroes as\r\nColonel John Fitzgerald and the veteran Colonel Grace, who acted as a\r\nvolunteer. The experienced Dutch general, fearing the appearance on the\r\nscene of St. Ruth, with a relieving army, became a prey to anxiety.\r\nImpressed by the spirit displayed by the Irish troops, he knew there was\r\nlittle chance of forcing the mutilated bridge by a direct assault, and\r\nhe looked for some means of flanking the place, either by a ford or a\r\nbridge of boats. He did not have, at first, sufficient material for the\r\nlatter, so he “demonstrated” with detachments of horse, toward\r\nLanesborough, east of Athlone, and Banagher west of it. The vigilance of\r\nthe Irish patrols at both points baffled his design.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, St. Ruth, who had been on the march from Limerick for some\r\ndays, at the head of 15,000 men, if we are to believe King James’s\r\nMemoirs, appeared beyond the Shannon and went into camp on a rising\r\nground about a mile and a half from the town. He was soon made aware of\r\nthe condition of affairs, and strengthened the castle garrison. He also\r\nhad an earthen rampart constructed to protect the bridge and ford. The\r\nlatter was practicable at low water only, and the summer of 1691 was\r\nexceptionally dry. The river had never been known to be so shallow\r\nwithin the memory of living man. This fact alone should have warned the\r\nFrench general to be exceptionally vigilant. He retired the brave\r\nFitzgerald from the governorship, to which he appointed General\r\nWauchop—a good soldier, but not an Irishman—and the French officers,\r\nGenerals D’Usson and De Tesse, were made joint commandants in the town.\r\nThe apologists for St. Ruth’s mistakes in front of Athlone claim that\r\nthe ill-fated chief gave orders to the French commandants to level all\r\nthe useless old walls near the bridge, but that his orders were\r\nneglected. As is usual in such cases, disobedience led to tragical\r\nresults. Foiled in his attempt at flank operations, Ginkel determined to\r\nassault the partially destroyed bridge across the Shannon, which, under\r\ncover of a tremendous cannon fire, he did. But it was defended with\r\nSpartan tenacity. Attack after attack failed. Movable covered galleries\r\nwere tried, and these contained planks wherewith to restore the broken\r\narches. Not less than nine English batteries, armed with heavy guns,\r\nrained death on the Irish army, but still it stood unmoved, although\r\nlosing heavily. Under cover of the fire of nearly fifty great guns, the\r\nEnglish pontoniers, protected also by their galleries, succeeded in\r\nlaying planks across the broken arches. They accounted their work done,\r\nwhen suddenly out of the Irish trenches leaped eleven men clad in armor,\r\nled by Sergeant Custume, or Costy, who, according to Sullivan, called on\r\nthem “to die with him for Ireland.” They rushed upon the bridge and\r\nproceeded to tear away the planks. Instantly, all the English cannon and\r\nmuskets sent balls and bullets crashing upon them. The whole eleven fell\r\ndead—shattered by that dreadful fire. Some planks still remained upon\r\nthe arches. Eleven more Irish soldiers leaped from their works, and,\r\nfollowing the example of their fallen comrades, gained the bridge and\r\nsought to throw the planks into the river. Nine of these heroes were\r\nkilled before their work was accomplished. But the planks were floating\r\ndown the Shannon, and two heroic survivors of twenty-two Homeric heroes\r\nregained the Irish lines! Pity it is that their names have not come down\r\nto us. Aubrey de Vere, in his fine poem, commemorating the exploit,\r\ntells us that St. Ruth, who, with Sarsfield, witnessed the glorious\r\ndeed, rose in his stirrups and swore he had never seen such valor\r\ndisplayed in the Continental wars. Chaplain Story, with incredible\r\nmeanness, tries to steal the glory of this deed from the Irish army by\r\nsaying that the heroes were “bold Scots of Maxwell’s regiment.” The\r\nslander has been sufficiently refuted by O’Callaghan, Boyle, and other\r\nwriters. Maxwell was a Scotchman, but he commanded Irish troops\r\nexclusively, and there was not a single Scotch battalion in the service\r\nof King James in Ireland from first to last. For further information on\r\nthis point, the reader can consult O’Callaghan’s “Green Book” and\r\n“History of the Irish Brigades,” and also Dalton’s “King James’s Irish\r\nArmy List,” which gives the roster of the field, line, and staff\r\nofficers of each Irish regiment, including Maxwell’s. The defence of the\r\nbridge occurred on the evening of June 28. On the morning of the 29th\r\nanother attempt was to have been made, but, owing to some\r\nmiscalculation, was deferred for some hours. St. Ruth was ready for it\r\nwhen it came, and, after another murderous struggle at the bridge, where\r\nthe English and their allies were led by the Scottish General Mackay,\r\nthe assailants were again beaten off, their covered gallery destroyed,\r\nand their bridge of boats, which they bravely attempted to construct in\r\nface of the Irish fire, broken up. St. Ruth commanded the Irish army in\r\nperson and displayed all the qualities of a good general. Success,\r\nhowever, would seem to have rendered him over-confident. The conflict\r\nover, he led his main body back to camp, and is said to have given a\r\nball and banquet at his quarters—a country house now in a neglected\r\ncondition and popularly known as “St. Ruth’s Castle.” The Roscommon\r\npeasants still speak of it as “the owld house in which the French\r\ngeneral danced the night before he lost Athlone.”\r\n\r\nBy some unaccountable fatality, St. Ruth, instead of leaving some\r\nveteran troops to occupy the works near the bridge, committed them to\r\nnew and untrained regiments, which were placed under the command of\r\nActing Brigadier Maxwell. The latter, who has been—unjustly,\r\nperhaps—accused of treason by Irish writers, would seem to have shared\r\nthe fatal over-confidence of St. Ruth. Therefore, no extraordinary\r\nprecautions were adopted to prevent a surprise—something always to be\r\nanticipated when a baffled enemy grows desperate. Colonel Cormac\r\nO’Neill, of the great Ulster family of that ilk, happened to be on duty\r\nat the defences of the river front during the night and morning of June\r\n29-30, and noticed suspicious movements among the English troops\r\noccupying the other side of the Shannon. Becoming alarmed, he\r\nimmediately communicated his suspicions to Maxwell, observing, at the\r\nsame time, that he would like a supply of ammunition for his men.\r\nMaxwell sneered and asked, “Do your men wish to shoot lavrocks (larks)?”\r\nHowever, O’Neill’s earnest manner impressed him somewhat, and, in the\r\ngray of the morning, he visited the outer lines, and, from what he saw,\r\nat once concluded that De Ginkel had some serious movement in\r\ncontemplation. He sent immediately to St. Ruth for a regiment of veteran\r\ninfantry, at the same time giving his reasons for the request. St. Ruth,\r\nit is said, sent back a taunting reply, which reflected on Maxwell’s\r\ncourage. We are told that Sarsfield remonstrated with St. Ruth, who\r\ndeclared he did not believe Ginkel would make an attempt to surprise the\r\ntown, while he was so near with an army to relieve it. English\r\nhistorians say that, upon this, Sarsfield apostrophized British valor\r\nand remarked that there was no enterprise too perilous for it to\r\nattempt. The discussion—if, indeed, it ever took place—was cut short by\r\nthe ringing of bells and firing of cannon in the town. “Athlone is\r\nsurprised and taken!” Sarsfield is credited with having said, as he\r\nobserved the untrained fugitives running from the Irish trenches.\r\n“Impossible!” St. Ruth is represented to have replied, “Ginkel’s master\r\nshould hang him if he attempts the capture of the place, and mine should\r\nhang me if I were to lose it!” But the uproar from the city soon showed\r\nthe Frenchman that something terrible had occurred. When too late, he\r\ngave orders to rectify his mistake. The English were already in the\r\nworks and could not be dislodged. Maxwell’s men had fled in disorder,\r\nmost of them being surprised in their sleep, and the general and some of\r\nhis officers became prisoners of war. It was the most complete and\r\nsuccessful surprise recorded in military annals, except, perhaps, that\r\nof Mannheim by General, afterward Marshal, Ney, in 1799. It would seem\r\nthat Ginkel, by the advice of Mackay, and other officers, looked for a\r\nford, and found it by the aid of three Danish soldiers who were under\r\nsentence of death, and were offered their lives if they succeeded. They\r\nfound the ford, and the Irish, seeing them approach the bank of the\r\nriver fearlessly, concluded they were deserters and refrained from\r\nfiring. After them plunged in sixty armored English grenadiers, led by\r\nCaptain Sandys, a noted military dare-devil, and these were followed by\r\nthe main body under Mackay, another experienced commander. The hour was\r\nsix in the morning of June 30, and, after one of the bravest defences of\r\nwhich we have record, Athlone, through the infatuation of St. Ruth, was\r\nin English hands before noon on that eventful day. And so it came to\r\npass, that after a conflict of more than a year, the defensive line of\r\nthe Shannon was, at last, broken. It is estimated by most historians\r\nthat Ginkel’s total loss amounted to 1,200 men and that of St. Ruth was\r\nsomewhat greater, owing to the surprise. Among those killed in St.\r\nRuth’s army were two colonels, named McGinness, Colonel MacMahon,\r\nColonel O’Gara, Colonel Richard Grace, who fell in defence of the bridge\r\non the 29th, and the French adjutant-general. Few officers of note fell\r\non the English side. Ginkel, during the siege, “expended 50 tons of\r\ngunpowder, 12,000 cannon balls, 600 bombshells, and innumerable tons of\r\nstone, hurled from the mortars, when the shells were exhausted.” After\r\nthe capture, the English found only a mass of ruins, and it took De\r\nGinkel several days to put the place in some kind of repair.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n The Irish Army Falls Back and Takes Post at Aughrim—Description of the\r\n  Field—Disposition of the Irish Forces—Baal Dearg O’Donnell’s Apathy\r\n\r\n\r\nBOTH history and tradition affirm that St. Ruth and Sarsfield almost\r\ncame to swords’ points over the loss of Athlone, and it is still\r\nbelieved, in that section of Ireland, that the Irish general, indignant\r\nat the criminal blunder that had been committed by his superior, took\r\nall of his cavalry from under the Frenchman’s command and marched to\r\nLimerick. But this tradition is more than doubtful. It is, however,\r\ncertain that the two leaders, who should have been so united in council,\r\nhad a bitter altercation over the disaster, and were hardly on speaking\r\nterms during the few momentous days they were destined to serve\r\ntogether. St. Ruth was filled with rage and mortification. He felt that\r\nhe had committed a grievous error, and dreaded the anger of King Louis,\r\nwho was a severe judge of those who served him ill. He declared his\r\ndetermination to hazard all on a pitched battle. Against this resolve,\r\nTyrconnel, who had come to the camp from Limerick, and others,\r\nprotested, but in vain. St. Ruth was in no humor to be balked. Tyrconnel\r\nleft the camp in dudgeon and retired once more to Limerick, which he was\r\ndestined never to leave again. Having made up his mind to fight, St.\r\nRuth at once broke camp and moved by Milton Pass, where he halted for a\r\nnight, toward Ballinasloe, which stands on the river Suck and in the\r\ncounty of Galway. The cavalry covered the retreat, but no attempt\r\nwhatever was made at pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe army took post along the fords of the Suck, as if it intended to\r\nfight in front of Ballinasloe, which was considered quite defensible,\r\nbut St. Ruth’s previous knowledge of the country would appear to have\r\ndetermined him to retire about three and a half miles south by west of\r\nhis first position, as soon as reinforcements, drawn from the abandoned,\r\nor reduced, posts along the Shannon, had joined him. In his retreat from\r\nAthlone, some of the Connaught troops, disgusted by the loss of that\r\ntown and doubtful of the general’s motives, deserted, and these had to\r\nbe replaced by the soldiers of the Irish garrisons broken up or\r\ndepleted. About July 9, old style, St. Ruth decamped from Ballinasloe,\r\nand a few hours afterward his devoted army, which, according to our best\r\ninformation, consisted of about 15,000 foot and 5,000 horse and\r\ndragoons, with only nine field-pieces, defiled by the causeways of\r\nUrachree and Aughrim to the slopes of Kilcommodan Hill, where the new\r\ncamp was established, on the eastern side of the eminence, facing toward\r\nGarbally and Ballinasloe. Kilcommodan, at that period, was almost\r\nsurrounded by red bog, and, on the front by which De Ginkel must\r\napproach, ran a small stream, with several branches, which made the\r\nmorass impracticable for horse and difficult for infantry. In our day,\r\nthis morass has become meadow-land, but it is about the only natural\r\nfeature that has undergone considerable change since the period of the\r\nbattle. From north to south, the hill is estimated to be a little more\r\nthan a mile in length, and its mean elevation is about 350 feet. The bog\r\nlay closer up to Aughrim, where stand the ruins of an old castle which\r\ncommanded the narrow and difficult pass, than to Urachree, where there\r\nis another pass not particularly formidable to a determined assailant.\r\nThe road through the pass of Aughrim ran then, and still runs, by\r\nKilconnell Abbey and village—after which the French have named the\r\nbattle—to Athenry, Loughrea, and Galway. The road through the pass of\r\nUrachree connects Ballinasloe with Lawrencetown, Eyrecourt, and Banagher\r\nBridge, and also, by a branch route, with Portumna; and these were the\r\nnatural lines of retreat for the Irish army in the event of disaster.\r\nNear the crest of Kilcommodan Hill are the remains of two so-called\r\nDanish raths, circular in shape, and in the one nearest to Aughrim\r\nCastle St. Ruth is said to have pitched his tent.\r\n\r\nMost of the elevation was then a wild common, but at its base, on the\r\nIrish front, were many fields under tillage, and these small inclosures\r\nwere divided from each other by thick, “quick-set” hedges, or, rather,\r\nfences, such as are still common in Ireland—formidable against the\r\nencroachments of cattle, but still more formidable when applied to\r\nmilitary purposes. The French general had found his intrenchments\r\nready-made, and proceeded to use them to the best possible advantage.\r\nWeak points in them were strengthened, and passageways connecting one\r\nwith the other, from front to rear and from right to left, were\r\nconstructed. The design was to enable the formidable Irish cavalry to\r\naid the infantry when a crisis should arrive. In the direction of\r\nUrachree, St. Ruth caused the construction of regular breastworks,\r\nconceiving that his point of danger lay to the right, and having, as a\r\nmilitary writer has well observed, “a fatal confidence in the strength\r\nof his left flank,” resting as it did on an old castle and “a narrow,\r\nboggy trench through which two horsemen could hardly ride abreast.” All\r\nhis arrangements were completed by the 10th of July, and, according to\r\nBoyle, the author of “The Battlefields of Ireland,” his line of battle,\r\nwhich contemporaneous accounts say covered a front of about two miles,\r\nhad its right resting on Urachree and its left upon Aughrim. The London\r\n“Gazette” of July, 1691, says that this wing of the Irish army “extended\r\ntoward the Abbey of Kilconnell,” which was considerably to the left and\r\nalmost in rear of Kilcommodan Hill. The Irish centre rested on the mid\r\nslope of the elevation, “between its camp and the hedgerows.” Each\r\ndivision consisted of two front and two rear lines; the former of\r\ninfantry and the latter of cavalry. Of St. Ruth’s nine brass pieces, two\r\nwere devoted to the defence of Aughrim Castle; a battery of three pieces\r\nwas constructed on the northeastern slope of Kilcommodan, so as to rake\r\nthe castle pass, a part of the morass, and the firmer ground beyond it,\r\nand thus prevent any hostile troops from deploying there and so threaten\r\nhis left. His other battery, of four pieces, was planted on his right\r\nand swept the pass leading to Urachree. It is said that a strong reserve\r\nof horse, under Sarsfield, was posted on the west side of the hill, out\r\nof view of the approaching enemy, but that Sarsfield had been\r\nparticularly enjoined by St. Ruth to make no movement whatever without a\r\ndirect order from himself. Story, who ought to know, says that Sarsfield\r\nwas second in command, but neither to him nor to any other of his\r\nsubordinate generals did St. Ruth communicate his plan of battle, so\r\nthat, if he were doomed to fall, the conflict could still be waged as he\r\nhad from the first ordained it. This was St. Ruth’s most fatal error, as\r\nit placed the fate of Ireland on the life or death of a single man. He\r\nhad no cannon with which to arm a battery on his centre, nor does he\r\nseem to have wanted any for that purpose—his apparent plan being to let\r\nthe English infantry cross at that point, where he felt confident the\r\nIrish foot and dragoons would soon make an end of them. Although King\r\nJames’s memoirs aver that St. Ruth had “a mean [_i.e._ poor] opinion” of\r\nthe Irish infantry, until it developed its prowess in the battle, his\r\ndisposition of this arm at Aughrim would not convey that opinion to the\r\nobserving mind. Most of the Irish foot lacked discipline, in the strict\r\nsense of the term, but no general who had seen them fight, as St. Ruth\r\ndid, at the bridge of Athlone, could doubt their courage. His\r\nexpectation that the English troops sent against his centre would be\r\nroughly handled was not doomed to disappointment.\r\n\r\nOwing to many untoward causes, a full and correct list of the Irish\r\nregiments that fought at Aughrim is not to be obtained, but Boyle holds\r\nthat Colonel Walter Bourke and his brother, Colonel David Bourke, held\r\nthe position in and around the castle of Aughrim; that Lord Bophin,\r\nBrigadier Henry Luttrell, and Colonels Simon Luttrell and Ulick Bourke\r\ncommanded on the left; that Major-General Dorrington, Major-General H.\r\nM. J. O’Neill, Brigadier Gordon O’Neill, Colonel Felix O’Neill, and\r\nColonel Anthony Hamilton held the centre; and that Lords Kilmallock,\r\nGalmoy, Galway, Clare, and Colonel James Talbot commanded on the right,\r\ntoward Urachree. Thus it may be inferred, says the historian, that the\r\nMunster troops were on the right, the Leinster and Ulster contingents in\r\nthe centre, and the soldiers of Connaught were posted on the left. The\r\ngeneral in command of the entire infantry was William Mansfield Barker,\r\nand Major-General John Hamilton was in chief command of the horse. The\r\ndiscord among the chief officers in the Irish camp must have been\r\nsomething unusual, when to none of the distinguished commanders\r\nenumerated did the French commander-in-chief reveal his order of battle.\r\nBut the historian recently quoted says, in reviewing the character of\r\nthe unfortunate Frenchman: “Whatever were the foibles of St. Ruth, from\r\nhis advent in the country to his retreat from Athlone, we have now to\r\nlook on an entirely different character. He had learned, though at a\r\nfearful cost, that his name had no fears for his potent adversary; that\r\ndeeds alone were to be the test of high emprise, and that his folly had\r\nnarrowed down the campaign, and in fact the whole war, to the last\r\nresource of fallen heroes—death or victory. With this feeling, all that\r\nwas vainglorious in his character at once disappeared; the mist was\r\nremoved from his mind, and it shone out to the end of his short career\r\nas that of a true hero in adversity. Unlike his French predecessors, he\r\nscorned to hide his faults behind the shield of calumny; he candidly\r\nacknowledged his error and bitterly lamented it. He became courteous to\r\nhis officers, affable to his soldiers, changed at once from the despot\r\nto the patriarch, and, touched by his sorrows, as much as by their own\r\ncalamity, they again rallied round him and determined on a final throw\r\nfor religion and liberty.”\r\n\r\nA proclamation issued by the English Lords Justices, in the name of\r\nWilliam and Mary, immediately after the fall of Athlone, offered\r\ninducements, in the shape of promotion and money, to such officers and\r\nsoldiers of the Irish army as would desert their colors and accept\r\nservice with De Ginkel. Very few traitors availed themselves of the\r\noffer, but many of those who were indignant with St. Ruth abandoned the\r\ncamp and joined the irregular forces of the military Hiberno-Spanish\r\nadventurer, Baal Dearg O’Donnell, who claimed to be of the noble House\r\nof Tyrconnel, and had lately come from Spain, apparently without a\r\nsettled purpose or principle. Instead of uniting his 7,000 irregulars\r\nwith the regular Irish army under St. Ruth, who had no French troops\r\nwhatever with him, O’Donnell assumed the airs of a hereditary Irish\r\nprince, affected to despise James as well as William, and established\r\nhis camp and court in the country between Tuam and Athenry, within two\r\nshort marches, if made even in ordinary time, of the Irish encampment on\r\nKilcommodan Hill. St. Ruth summoned him to his aid, but the adventurer,\r\nwhose selfish conduct some Irish writers, notably Mr. Haverty, have\r\nsought to explain and excuse, made no reply, and, to this day, he is\r\nremembered in Ireland with detestation not unmingled with contempt. His\r\nduty, when within sound of the cannon of Aughrim, was to hasten to the\r\nfield and spare the fate of his gallant countrymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n  De Ginkel Marches After St. Ruth—The Latter Prepares to “Conquer or\r\n        Die”—His Speech to the Irish Army on the Eve of Fighting\r\n\r\n\r\nREINFORCEMENTS continued to reach De Ginkel’s camp near Athlone, where\r\nhe lingered much longer than he originally intended, owing to the utter\r\nruin which the bombardment had wrought. Another cause of his delay was\r\nhis anxiety to obtain fresh supplies of ammunition, and he judged\r\ncorrectly that St. Ruth, rendered desperate by his late misfortune,\r\nwould give him decisive battle at the very first opportunity. But, about\r\nJuly 10, all was in readiness, and leaving in Athlone a powerful\r\ngarrison, the Dutch general and his fine army set out in pursuit of St.\r\nRuth, who had now so many days “the start” of his enemy. The English\r\nhalted that night at Kilcashel, on the road to Ballinasloe. On the 11th\r\nthey reached the fords of the Suck, and the scouts reported the Irish\r\npickets in full view on the heights of Garbally—now the domain of the\r\nEarl of Clancarty, whose ancestor distinguished himself as an\r\nartillerist on the English side at Aughrim. De Ginkel, taking with him a\r\nformidable force of cavalry, crossed the river by the ford and rode\r\nforward to reconnoitre St. Ruth’s position. The Irish pickets fell back\r\nas he advanced, and, reaching the crest of the heights, he beheld,\r\nthrough his field-glass, on an opposite elevation, about a mile and a\r\nhalf distant, the Irish army drawn up in “battle’s magnificently stern\r\narray,” matches lighted at the batteries, and their colors advanced,\r\nchallenging to combat. He rode forward farther still, to get a closer\r\nview, and St. Ruth allowed him to gratify his curiosity unmolested,\r\nalthough he came within less than half a mile of the Irish lines. What\r\nhe saw made De Ginkel thoughtful. His military glance showed him the\r\nstrength of the Irish position, and St. Ruth’s reputation as a competent\r\ngeneral stood high in all the camps of Europe. He rode back to his camp\r\nand called a council of his officers, Mackay, Ruvigny, Talmash, and the\r\nrest. Having explained the situation, he asked for their opinion. Some\r\nwere for trying a flank movement, which would draw St. Ruth from his\r\nchosen ground, but the bolder spirits said they had gone too far to turn\r\naside without loss of honor, and a forward movement was decided on. The\r\ncamp, guarded by two regiments, was left undisturbed. All superfluous\r\nclothing was laid aside, and, in light marching order, De Ginkel’s army\r\ncrossed the Suck, the movement being visible to St. Ruth from\r\nKilcommodan Hill, “the foot,” as Story has it, “over the bridge; the\r\nEnglish and French [Huguenot] horse over the ford above, and the Dutch\r\nand Danes over two fords below.” It was six o’clock in the morning of\r\nSunday, July 12, 1691 (July 23, new style), while the early church bells\r\nwere ringing in Ballinasloe, when they prepared to march on Aughrim.\r\nEnglish annalists, intending, perhaps, to minimize the prowess of the\r\nIrish army, place De Ginkel’s strength at 18,000 men of all arms, but\r\nthe roster of his regiments, as given by Story and other contemporaneous\r\nwriters, shows conclusively that his force could not have been less than\r\nfrom 25,000 to 30,000 men, nearly all seasoned veterans. The Williamite\r\nchaplain’s map of Ginkel’s order of battle shows over seventy (70)\r\nregimental organizations, not including Lord Portland’s horse, which\r\njoined after the line was formed. Some of the bodies shown as regiments\r\nmay have been battalions or squadrons, but, making due allowance for\r\nthese, and counting 400 men as the average of seventy distinct\r\nformations, which is an almost absurdly low estimate, the Williamite\r\narmy could not, possibly, have been less than 28,000 men. Its artillery\r\nwas formidable, and the cavalry—British, Dutch, Danish, German, and\r\nHuguenot—was accounted the best in Europe. As this fine force advanced\r\ntoward its objective, the scared rural folk fled before it, remembering,\r\nno doubt, the excesses committed by the armies of William and Douglas in\r\nLeinster and Munster during the preceding year. The writer lived for\r\nsome years almost within sight of Kilcommodan Hill, and heard from the\r\nsimple, but intelligent, peasantry, whose great-grandfathers had spoken\r\nwith soldiers of King James’s army, how De Ginkel’s troops defiled in\r\nfour great, glittering columns of scarlet and blue and steel, horse,\r\nfoot, and cannoneers, over the Suck and took up their positions on the\r\nGalway side of the river. Their brass field-pieces shone like burnished\r\ngold in the morning sun. They halted where the road from Ballinasloe,\r\nrunning west by south, branches around the north side of Kilcommodan,\r\ntoward Kilconnell, Athenry, and Galway, and around the south end of that\r\nelevation toward Kiltormer, Lawrencetown, and Clonfert. The Irish\r\npickets fell back before them, firing as they retired, from the heights\r\nof Knockdunloe, Garbally, and Liscappel. De Ginkel marshaled his army\r\ninto two lines of battle, corresponding almost exactly to the Irish\r\nformation, the infantry in the front line, and strongest, finally,\r\ntoward the centre, and the cavalry on the flanks, supported by the\r\ncannon.\r\n\r\nUp to about 7.30 o’clock, tradition says, the morning remained\r\nbeautifully clear, and the Irish camp, on the rising ground, was plainly\r\nvisible to the enemy. St. Ruth’s army, except the officers and men on\r\nduty and the few non-Catholic Jacobites who followed its fortunes, was\r\nobserved to be assisting at mass—altars having been erected by the\r\nchaplains at the head of every regiment. It was, according to the\r\nimposing French custom, which St. Ruth closely followed, military High\r\nMass, during which, at the elevation of the Host, there was rolling of\r\nthe drums and blare of trumpets, instead of the pealing of cathedral\r\nbells. The horses of the Irish cavalry were “on herd” along the grassy\r\nhillside, under guard; but, when the English advance was sighted, the\r\nbugles sounded “To Horse,” and there was “mounting in hot haste” of\r\nSarsfield’s and Galmoy’s and Kilmallock’s bronzed and bearded\r\ntroopers—the paladins of the Boyne and Ballyneety. Divine service over,\r\nthe Irish army at once occupied the positions assigned to the several\r\ncorps by their general on the preceding day. Story and some other\r\nEnglish writers claim that, on that day, also, St. Ruth addressed to his\r\narmy a pompous, vainglorious, and rather insulting speech, which he\r\ncaused to be translated into English and Irish, by his interpreters, for\r\nthe benefit of those to whom it was directed. But Irish chroniclers aver\r\nthat he spoke to the troops with paternal consideration, reminded them\r\nof their country’s sufferings, and their own duty, and called upon them,\r\nin words of nervous eloquence, in the name of honor, religion, and\r\nliberty, and for Ireland’s military glory, to conquer or die.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n Decisive Battle of Aughrim—It Opens Favorably for the Irish—Desperate\r\n  Fighting in the Centre and at Urachree—Fortune or Treason Favors De\r\n                                 Ginkel\r\n\r\n\r\nBUT the fog, “arising from the moist valley of the Suck,” had,\r\nmeanwhile, gathered so densely that the rival armies, for a time, lost\r\nsight of each other, and De Ginkel’s forward movement was suspended; but\r\nhis soldiers rested in the positions previously determined on, although\r\nthe formation had to be somewhat modified later in the day. It was about\r\nnoon when the fog finally rolled away, and Ginkel’s line of battle moved\r\nslowly onward, until, at last, to use the graphic words of Lord\r\nMacaulay, the rival armies “confronted each other, with nothing but the\r\nbog and the breastwork between them.” The Irish historian, John Boyle,\r\nstates, in his fine account of the conflict at Aughrim, that, at sight\r\nof the Williamite array, on the other side of the morass, the Irish army\r\nbroke into loud shouts of defiance, which were vigorously responded to\r\nby their foes. There was a mutual mortal hatred expressed in those\r\ncheers. It meant “war to the knife,” and, as at our own Buena Vista,\r\n\r\n                  “Who heard the thunder of the fray\r\n                     Break o’er the field beneath,\r\n                   Well knew the watchword of that day\r\n                     Was ‘Victory or death!’”\r\n\r\nObserving the strength of the Irish left at Aughrim Castle, De Ginkel\r\nresolved to manœuvre toward Urachree, where his horse had a better\r\nchance, and, about one o’clock, began the battle with a cavalry advance\r\nin the direction of the latter point. The first charge was made by a\r\nDanish troop on an Irish picket. The latter met the shock so fiercely\r\nthat the Danes, although superior in numbers, by the admission of Story,\r\nfled in great haste. Another party was sent forward, and still\r\nanother—the Irish responding with fresh bodies of their own, until, at\r\nlast, Cunningham’s dragoons, Eppinger’s cavalry, and Lord Portland’s\r\nhorse—all under the veteran General Holztapfel—were drawn in on the\r\nEnglish side. They charged furiously, and, for a moment, the Irish\r\ncavalry gave ground, drawing their opponents after them. The English,\r\ncarried away by apparent success, rode at a gallop past the house of\r\nUrachree and were immediately charged in flank by the brave Lord Galmoy.\r\nA murderous conflict followed, but, as at the Boyne, the Irish horsemen\r\nshowed their superiority, and their gallant enemies were forced to fall\r\nback in terrible disorder, leaving hundreds of their comrades dead or\r\ndying on the ensanguined field. Many of the Irish troopers fell also,\r\nand, on both sides, every man was killed or wounded by the sabre. The\r\nEnglish left their heroic commander, General Holztapfel, among their\r\ndead. When De Ginkel saw his chosen cavalry repelled with slaughter from\r\nUrachree, he became profoundly anxious. There had been, up to this time,\r\nonly a few partial demonstrations by the Anglo-Dutch infantry which had\r\nproduced no impression whatever on St. Ruth’s sturdy foot, who lay\r\nquietly in their works, waiting for their foes to advance to closer\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nDe Ginkel, in deep distress of mind, summoned a council of war, which\r\ndebated whether it were better to defer the battle until next day or\r\nrenew the attack immediately. At one time, during the discussion, it was\r\ndetermined upon to send back to Ballinasloe for the tents, and encamp\r\nfor the night where the army stood. This decision was afterward set\r\naside, and, says Chaplain Story, “it was agreed to prosecute the battel\r\non the enemies’ right, by that means proposing to draw part of their\r\nstrength from Aghrim [so he spells it] Castle, nigh which their main\r\nbody was posted, that so our right might have the easier passage over to\r\nattack their left, and then our whole army might have opportunity to\r\nengage. This, I am told, was the advice of Major-General Mackay, a man\r\nof great judgment and long experience, and it had its desired success.”\r\n\r\nWe will take the Williamite chaplain’s account of the movement against\r\nthe Irish right wing, which immediately followed the council of war:\r\n“About half an hour past four in the afternoon, a part of our left wing\r\nmoved toward the enemy, and, at five o’clock, the battel began afresh. A\r\nparty of our foot marched up to their ditches, all strongly guarded with\r\nmusketiers, and their horse posted advantageously to sustain them: here\r\nwe fired one upon the other for a considerable time, and the Irish\r\nbehaved themselves like men of another nation [mark the ungracious\r\nsneer], defending their ditches stoutly; for they would maintain one\r\nside till our men put their pieces over at the other, and then, having\r\nlines of communication from one ditch to another, they would presently\r\npost themselves again, and flank us. This occasioned great firing on\r\nboth sides, which continued on the left nigh an hour and a half, ere the\r\nright of our army or the centre engaged, except with their cannon, which\r\nplayed on both sides. All this time, our men were coming up in as good\r\norder as the inconveniency of the ground would allow, and now General\r\nMackay and the rest, seeing the enemy draw off several bodies of horse\r\nand foot from the left, and move toward their right, when our men\r\npressed them very hard; they [the English generals] laid hold on that\r\nadvantage, and ordered the foot to march over the bogg, which fronted\r\nthe enemies’ main battel. Colonel Earl, Colonel Herbert, Colonel\r\nCreighton, and Colonel Brewer’s regiments went over at the narrowest\r\nplace, where the hedges on the enemies’ side run farthest into the bogg.\r\nThese four regiments were ordered to march to the lowest ditches,\r\nadjoining to the side of the bogg, and there to post themselves till our\r\nhorse could come about by Aghrim Castle and sustain them, and till the\r\nother foot marched over the bogg below, where it was broader, and were\r\nsustained by Colonel Foulk’s and Brigadier Stewart’s [forces]. Colonel\r\nEarl advanced with his regiment, and the rest after him, over the bogg,\r\nand a rivulet that ran through it, being most of them up to their\r\nmiddles in mudd and water. The Irish at their near approach to the\r\nditches fired upon them, but our men contemning all disadvantages,\r\nadvanced immediately to the lowest hedges, and beat the Irish from\r\nthence. The enemy, however, did not retreat far, but posted themselves\r\nin the next ditches before us, which our men seeing and disdaining\r\n[_sic_] to suffer their lodging so near us, they would needs beat them\r\nfrom thence also, and so from one hedge to another, till they got very\r\nnigh the enemies’ main battel. But the Irish had so ordered the matter\r\nas to make an easy passage for their horse amongst all those hedges and\r\nditches, by which means they poured in great numbers both of horse and\r\nfoot upon us: which Colonel Earl seeing, encouraged his men by advancing\r\nbefore them, and saying: ‘There is no way to come off but to be brave!’\r\nAs great an example of true courage and generosity as any man this day\r\nliving {1693}. But, being flanked and fronted, as also exposed to the\r\nenemies’ shot from the adjacent ditches, our men were forced to quit\r\ntheir ground, and betake themselves to the bogg again, whither they were\r\nfollowed, or rather drove [_sic_] down by main strength of horse and\r\nfoot, and a great many killed. Colonel Earl and Colonel Herbert were\r\nhere taken prisoners; the former, after twice taking and retaking, got\r\nfree at last, tho’ not without being wounded.\r\n\r\n“While this was doing here, Colonel St. John, Colonel Tiffin, Lord\r\nGeorge Hambleton, the French [Huguenots] and other regiments were\r\nmarching below on the same bogg. The Irish, in the meantime, laid so\r\nclose in their ditches that several were doubtful whether they had any\r\nmen at that place or not; but they were convinced of it at last; for no\r\nsooner were the French and the rest got within twenty yards, or less, of\r\nthe ditches, but the Irish fired most furiously upon them, which our men\r\nas bravely sustained, and pressed forwards, tho’ they could scarce see\r\none another for the smoak [_sic_]. And now the thing seemed so doubtful,\r\nfor some time, that the bystanders would rather have given it on the\r\nIrish side, for they had driven our foot in the centre so far back that\r\nthey were got almost in a line with some of our great guns, planted near\r\nthe bogg, which we had not the benefit of at that juncture, because of\r\nthe mixture of our men and theirs.\r\n\r\n“Major-General Ruvigny’s French horse and Sir John Lanier’s, being both\r\nposted on the right, were afterward drawn to the left, where they did\r\nvery good service. And the right wing of our horse, in the meantime,\r\nwere making what haste they could to succor our foot; for, seeing the\r\ndanger, and, in fact, that all was in hazard by reason of the difficulty\r\nof the pass, they did more than men, in pressing and tumbling over a\r\nvery dangerous place, and that amongst showers of bullets, from a\r\nregiment of dragoons and two regiments of foot, posted conveniently\r\nunder cover by the enemy, to obstruct our passage. Our horse at this\r\nplace were sustained by Major-General Kirke and Colonel Gustavus\r\nHambleton’s foot, who, after we had received the enemies’ fire for a\r\nconsiderable time, marched under the walls of the castle, and lodged\r\nthemselves in a dry ditch, in the throng of the enemies’ shot [globular\r\nbuttons cut from their jackets, when their ammunition failed], and some\r\nother old walls and ditches adjoining.”\r\n\r\nCommenting on the foregoing account of the Williamite chaplain, Mr.\r\nO’Callaghan, in his “Green Book,” page 224, says: “He [Story] has the\r\nsame fraudulent coloring I have previously exposed respecting this [the\r\nHuguenot] portion of the English left having ‘kept their ground.’ The\r\nHuguenot narrative [of the battle] is only wrong in the supposition that\r\nLa Forest [Huguenot general] on the English left was successful with the\r\nFrench [Huguenot] infantry, before Ruvigny [Huguenot general], with his\r\nhorse, had conquered in the centre; the first progress of the English\r\nhaving been on their right opposite Aughrim ... where Sir Francis\r\nCompton with the van and Mackay with the rest of the English horse\r\nsucceeded in forcing a passage; secondly, on the centre, where Talmash\r\nnext to Mackay, and Ruvigny next to Talmash advanced; and, thirdly, on\r\nthe left, where La Forest first, and then the Danish horse and foot were\r\nenabled to cross.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n Battle of Aughrim Continued—Its Crisis—The English Turn Irish Left—St.\r\n  Ruth Killed by Cannon Ball—Confusion and Final Defeat of Irish Army\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE lodgment made by the English, or, rather, Ulster regiment of\r\nGustavus Hamilton in the dry ditch, as described by Chaplain Story,\r\ntogether with another lodgment made in front of the Irish left centre by\r\nsome of the infantry who escaped the slaughter when they were so\r\ngallantly repulsed at that point shortly before, however effected, threw\r\nthe chances of victory, for the first time that day, heavily on the side\r\nof De Ginkel. St. Ruth, whose sharp attention was, doubtless, mainly\r\ndrawn off toward his centre and right, where the battle had raged\r\nfiercely and continuously for nearly two hours, soon became aware of the\r\nmovement inaugurated by the enemy’s cavalry at the castle pass. He\r\nseemed astonished, conceiving that the point was strongly garrisoned,\r\nand asked of his officers: “What do they mean?” The reply was: “They\r\nmean to pass there and flank our left!” St. Ruth observed them for a\r\nmoment, laughed incredulously, having still “that fatal confidence in\r\nthe strength of his left flank,” and exclaimed in his impetuous fashion:\r\n“Pardieu! but they are brave! What a pity they should be so exposed!” A\r\nfew minutes previously, exhilarated by the splendid prowess of the Irish\r\ninfantry, in the centre and at Urachree, he threw his plumed hat in the\r\nair and shouted: “Well done, my children! The day is ours! Now we will\r\nbeat them back even to the gates of Dublin!”\r\n\r\nThe unlooked-for passage of the English horse on the Irish left has been\r\nvariously explained, or, rather, sought to be explained. Almost every\r\nIrish writer, the careful O’Callaghan included, attributes the disaster\r\nto a lack of proper ammunition on the part of Colonel Walter Bourke’s\r\nregiment, to which was committed the defence of the castle. Having\r\nexhausted their original supply, the soldiers opened the barrels in\r\nreserve and found that the bullets were cast for the calibre of the\r\nEnglish guns which they had used earlier in the war, and were too large\r\nfor the bore of the French muskets, which they carried at Aughrim. Other\r\nauthors aver that when the Irish left was weakened, to strengthen the\r\nright, the front instead of the rear line of the covering brigade (Henry\r\nLuttrell’s) was withdrawn, thus enabling the infantry that accompanied\r\nSir Francis Compton’s horse—who were twice repulsed, but, being heavily\r\nreinforced, again advanced—to post themselves in “the dry ditch”\r\nreferred to by Chaplain Story; while General Talmash made a\r\ncorresponding lodgment, with his rallied foot, on the right centre.\r\nGross carelessness, deliberate treason, or both combined, contributed to\r\nthe Irish disaster. St. Ruth himself, however, would not seem to have\r\nbeen much concerned by the apparition of the English cavalry forming\r\ntoward his left flank, in the small area of firm ground, just across\r\nfrom the old castle. On the contrary, like Napoleon before the final\r\ncharge at Waterloo, “the flash of victory passed into his eyes,” and, as\r\nhe observed the enemy forming with some difficulty in that narrow space,\r\nwhile the single infantry regiment in the dry ditch cowering under the\r\nrain of Irish bullets, cried out to his staff, “We have won the battle,\r\ngentlemen! They are beaten. Now let us beat them to the purpose!” His\r\nbodyguard was formed in rear of the staff and he had already ordered his\r\ncavalry reserve to report to him. Therefore, these formidable squadrons\r\ncame up at a trot that shook the ground over the hill behind him. We are\r\nnot informed of the name of the officer who led them—fortunately for his\r\nfame, for he must have been either a dastard or a traitor. Instead of\r\ncommitting the command to a subordinate general, as he should have done,\r\nSt. Ruth prepared to lead the attack in person, and the mass of\r\nhorsemen, proud and confident, began to move slowly down the slope in\r\nthe direction of the disheartened but still determined enemy. The\r\ngeneral, dismounting, halted for a brief space at the battery which\r\ndefended that flank of the army, addressed some remarks to the officer\r\nin command, and, it is said, directed the fire of one of the cannon,\r\nwith his own hand, toward a particular point of the causeway leading to\r\nthe castle. Then he remounted his superb gray charger—the third he had\r\nridden that fatal day—and, dressed as he was in full uniform, made a\r\nconspicuous mark for the English gunners. He drew his sword, his hard\r\nfeatures, according to tradition, kindling with enthusiasm, and was\r\nabout to utter the command to charge Compton’s and Levinson’s cavalry—a\r\ncharge that must have given the victory to Ireland, because, according\r\nto Macaulay, De Ginkel already meditated a retreat—when, right before\r\nthe eyes of his horrified followers, his head was dashed from his\r\nshoulders by a cannon shot, fired from the English battery at the other\r\nside of the bog! His sword remained firmly gripped in his right hand,\r\nbut his affrighted horse galloped down the hill, the body of the rider\r\nremaining erect in the saddle, until it was knocked off by the\r\noverhanging branches of a tree whose remnants are still pointed out to\r\nthe traveler. A general paralysis of the Irish left wing, chiefly among\r\nthe horse, would seem to have immediately followed the sudden and\r\nghastly death of St. Ruth. The French attendants at once threw a cloak\r\nover the headless trunk, with the well-meant, but, as it turned out,\r\nill-considered object of concealing the general’s unlooked-for fall from\r\nthe all but victorious Irish army.\r\n\r\nSt. Ruth’s bodyguard halted the moment he fell, and, when the servants\r\nbore the body over the hill toward the rear, they acted as escort. The\r\nIrish horse, through the timidity or treachery of their chief, halted\r\nalso, and, unaccountably, followed the movement in retreat of the\r\nbodyguard. The single word “Charge!” uttered by any general officer,\r\nbefore the cavalry retired, would have saved the day; but it was never\r\nuttered. The stubborn Mackay and his lieutenants, from their position\r\nnear the castle below, divined, from the confusion they observed on the\r\nnear hillside, that something fatal had occurred. They took fresh heart.\r\nMore of their cavalry, strongly supported by infantry, came up. All\r\nthese reheartened troops began to push forward beyond the pass, and even\r\non their beaten centre and left the long-baffled British and their\r\nallies again assumed the offensive. No orders reached the Irish\r\ntroops—mainly foot—still in position on the right and centre and even on\r\na portion of the left—for the order of battle had perished with St.\r\nRuth. Was it possible that, impressed by repeated dissensions, he\r\ndoubted the fidelity of his chiefs and feared to take any of them into\r\nhis confidence? He must have misjudged most of them sorely if this was\r\nthe case. Mere selfishness or vanity can not explain his fateful\r\nomission. The English cavalry, now practically unopposed, poured through\r\nthe pass, penetrated to the firm ground on the north slope of the hill,\r\nand, finally, appeared in rear of the infantry of the Irish left wing.\r\nTheir foot, too, had succeeded in making firm lodgment in the lowest\r\nditches. The Irish still continued to fight bravely, “but without order\r\nor direction.” At the sight of the repeatedly routed British infantry\r\ncrossing the bog in the centre, and the cavalry threatening their left\r\nand rear, it is averred by Boyle that a cry of “Treason!” rang through\r\nthe ranks of the regiments so placed as to be able to observe the\r\nhostile movements.\r\n\r\nThe enemy now vigorously attacked the Irish right and centre, but were\r\nas vigorously met, and again and again repulsed. For a long time, on the\r\nright particularly, they were unable to advance, and it would appear\r\nthat the Irish soldiers in their front were totally ignorant of what had\r\noccurred in other parts of the field. The Irish infantry on the left,\r\ndestitute of ammunition and having expended even their buttons and\r\nramrods for projectiles, retired within the castle, where nearly all of\r\nthem were finally slaughtered; or else broke off to the left, toward\r\nKilconnell, and made for the large, red bog, which almost surrounded\r\nthat flank, where many of them found refuge from the sabres of the\r\npursuing cavalry. But even still the devoted centre and right, although\r\nfuriously assaulted, refused to give way. At last, the uproar toward\r\nAughrim, and the bullets of the outflanking enemy in the left rear,\r\ntaking them in reverse, warned these brave troops that their position\r\nhad become desperate. Twilight had already set in—it was more than an\r\nhour after the fall of St. Ruth—when the English horse and foot appeared\r\nalmost behind them, toward the northwest; while the Dutch, Danish, and\r\nHuguenot cavalry, so long repelled at Urachree, supported by the foot\r\nthat had, at long run, crossed the morass, began to hem them in on all\r\nsides. Their bravest leaders had fallen, but this admirable infantry\r\nretired slowly from inclosure to inclosure, fighting the fight of\r\ndespair, until they reached their camp, where the tents were still\r\nstanding in the order in which they were pitched. Here they made their\r\nlast heroic stand, but were, at length, broken and fled toward the red\r\nbog already mentioned. The English leveled the tents, so as to render\r\npursuit more open, and then a dreadful slaughter of the broken Irish\r\nfoot followed. Few of these brave men, worthy of a better fate, escaped\r\nthe swords of the hostile horse. “Our foreigners, and especially the\r\nDanes, make excellent pursuers,” writes Chaplain Story grimly. Irish\r\nhistorians say that two of the Irish regiments, disdaining to fly, took\r\nposition in a ravine, and there waited “till morning’s sun should rise\r\nand give them light to die.” They were discovered by the enemy next\r\nmorning and perished to a man! The spot where they died is still pointed\r\nout and is called by the peasantry “the glen of slaughter.”\r\n\r\nWe have, unhappily, no better authority than tradition for stating that,\r\ntoward the end of the battle, a part of the Irish cavalry, led by\r\nSarsfield, covered the retreat of the survivors of the Irish foot on\r\nLoughrea and Limerick. In fact there seems to be a complete mystery\r\nabout the action of the Irish cavalry after the death of the French\r\ngeneral. Certain it is that this force did not act with the vigor it\r\nshowed in the early part of the combat on the right or with the spirit\r\nit displayed at the Boyne; and this fact deepens the doubt as to whether\r\nSarsfield was in the fight or not. Had it not been, as we are informed\r\nby the learned Abbé McGeoghegan, in his able “History of Ireland,” for\r\none O’Reilly, the almoner of a regiment, who caused the charge to be\r\nsounded as the fugitives passed through a boggy defile on the line of\r\nretreat, the entire Irish infantry might have been destroyed. They were\r\nalso aided by darkness, caused by “a thick misty rain,” brought on, no\r\ndoubt, by the detonations of the firearms, acting on a humid atmosphere.\r\nNumbers of small arms and other munitions were abandoned in the flight;\r\nall the cannon, most of the colors, and the whole camp material fell\r\ninto the hands of the enemy. Aughrim was to Ireland what Culloden was to\r\nScotland and Waterloo to France—an irretrievable military disaster,\r\nredeemed only by the desperate valor of the defeated army. Even the most\r\nbitter and partisan of the English annalists admit, although with\r\nmanifest reluctance, that the Irish army fought heroically in this\r\nmurderous battle. Its losses are placed by Story, who witnessed the\r\nconflict throughout, at 7,000 killed on the spot and 500, including\r\nofficers, made prisoners. This statement of his shows conclusively that\r\nalmost all of the Irish wounded were put to the sword. Other writers,\r\nincluding King James himself, make the Irish loss somewhat less, but we\r\nare inclined to think that Story, in this case, came pretty near to the\r\ntruth. He says in his interesting narrative, “looking amongst the dead\r\nthree days after, when all of ours and some of theirs were buried, I\r\nreckoned in some small inclosures 150, in others 120, etc., lying most\r\nof them in the ditches where they were shot, and the rest from the top\r\nof the hill, where their camp had been, looked like a great flock of\r\nsheep, scattered up and down the country for almost four miles round.”\r\nThe bodies had been stripped by the camp-followers, which accounts for\r\nthe white appearance to which Story makes allusion. Most of these\r\ncorpses were inhumanly left above ground, to be the prey of birds and\r\nbeasts, by the conquerors, and thus Aughrim is known to the Irish people\r\nas the “Field of our Unburied Dead.” It was customary a generation ago,\r\nand may be so in our day, for the Catholic peasantry passing along the\r\nroads that wind around Kilcommodan, to uncover their heads reverently\r\nand offer up prayers for the souls of the heroes of their race who died\r\nthere for faith, land, and liberty.\r\n\r\nStory says he never could find out what became of St. Ruth’s corpse,\r\n“some say that it was left stripped amongst the other dead when our men\r\npursued beyond the hill, and others that it was thrown into a bog.” In\r\nthe neighborhood of Aughrim it was long believed that while still the\r\nleft of the Irish army remained in position, the French staff officers\r\nlaid the remains to rest under the chancel floor of the adjacent Abbey\r\nof Kilconnell. Other traditions are to the effect that they were buried\r\nin Loughrea Abbey, or beside those of Lord Galway, who fell in the same\r\nbattle, in the ruined church of Athenry. Boyle, after mentioning the two\r\nlast-named probabilities, says: “There is, however, reason to doubt\r\nboth, and the writer is aware that the people of the locality where the\r\nbattle was fought, directed by tradition, point to a few stunted white\r\nthorns, to the west of the hill toward Loughrea, beneath which, they\r\nsay, rest the ashes of that great but unfortunate general.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n Mortality Among Officers of Rank on Both Sides—Acknowledged English Loss\r\n        at Aughrim—English and Irish Comments on Conduct of Battle\r\n\r\n\r\nBESIDES St. Ruth, the chief officers killed on the Irish side were,\r\naccording to Story’s account, General Lord Kilmallock, General Lord\r\nGalway, Brigadier-General Connel (O’Connell), Brigadier-General W.\r\nMansfield Barker, Brigadier-General Henry M. J. O’Neill, Colonel Charles\r\nMoore, his lieutenant-colonel and major; Colonel David Bourke, Colonel\r\nUlick Bourke, Colonel Connor McGuire, Colonel James Talbot, Colonel\r\nArthur, Colonel Mahony, Colonel Morgan, Major Purcell, Major O’Donnell,\r\nMajor Sir John Everard, with several others of superior rank, “besides,\r\nat least, five hundred captains and subordinate officers.” This latter\r\nstatement has been challenged by Irish historians, who claim that\r\nnon-commissioned officers were included in the list. Story omitted from\r\nthe number of superior officers slain the name of Colonel Felix O’Neill,\r\nJudge-Advocate-General of the Irish army, whose body was found on the\r\nfield. Of the less than five hundred Irish prisoners taken, twenty-six\r\nwere general or field officers, including General Lord Duleek, General\r\nLord Slane, General Lord Bophin, General Lord Kilmaine, General\r\nDorrington, General John Hambleton (Hamilton), Brigadier-General Tuite,\r\nColonel Walter Bourke, Colonel Gordon O’Neill, Colonel Butler, Colonel\r\nO’Connell (ancestor of Daniel O’Connell), Colonel Edmund Madden,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel John Chappel, Lieutenant-Colonel John Butler,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Baggot, Lieutenant-Colonel John Border,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel McGinness, Lieutenant-Colonel Rossiter,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel McGuire, Major Patrick Lawless, Major Kelly, Major\r\nGrace, Major William Bourke, Major Edmund Butler, Major Edmund Broghill,\r\nMajor John Hewson, “with 30 captains, 25 lieutenants, 23 ensigns, 5\r\ncornets, 4 quartermasters, and an adjutant.”\r\n\r\nChaplain Story, to whom, with all his faults, we are much indebted for\r\nthe details of this momentous battle—one of the few “decisive battles”\r\nof the world—says: “We [the English and their allies] lost 73 officers,\r\nwho were killed in this action, with 111 wounded, as appears by the\r\ninserted lists [_vide_ his History of the “Wars in Ireland”] of both\r\nhorse and foot, given in two days after by the general’s command, and\r\nsent to the king.” The lists referred to acknowledged, also, 600\r\nsoldiers killed and 906 wounded. The allied losses were, no doubt,\r\nunderestimated for political effect in England, which had been taught\r\nthat one Englishman could kill any number of Irishmen without much fear\r\nof a fatal result to himself. And this superstition was useful, we\r\nbelieve, to the morale of the British soldiers of the period, whose\r\nstomachs failed them so notably when they were “up against” the defences\r\nof Limerick, as will be seen hereafter. Captain Taylor, a Williamite\r\nwriter, who was present at the battle and published a graphic account of\r\nit, says that the loss of the allies (British, Dutch, Danes, Germans,\r\nand Huguenots) was little less than that of the Irish, most of the\r\nlatter having fallen in the retreat after the death of General St. Ruth.\r\nOf the Anglo-Dutch troopers, there were killed by the Irish cavalry at\r\nthe pass of Urachree, in the early part of the fight, 202, and wounded\r\n125, thus showing the superior strength, reach of arm, and dexterity of\r\nthe Irish horsemen. In hand-to-hand conflicts, whether mounted or on\r\nfoot, the Irish soldiery, in whatever service, ever excelled, with sword\r\nor battle-axe, pike or bayonet. Clontibret and the Yellow Ford, Benburb\r\nand Fontenoy, Almanza and Albuera, Inkerman and Antietam bear witness to\r\nthe truth of this assertion. As a charging warrior, the Irishman has\r\nnever been surpassed, and, no matter how bloodily repulsed, an Irish\r\nregiment or an Irish army is ever willing to try again. There may be\r\nsoldiers as brave as they, but none are braver, even when they fight in\r\ncauses with which they have no natural sympathy. It may be set down as a\r\nmilitary axiom that the Irish soldier is, by force of untoward\r\ncircumstances, frequently a mercenary, but rarely, or never, a coward.\r\n\r\nThe principal officers who fell on the English side, at Aughrim, were\r\nMajor-General Holztapfel, who commanded Lord Portland’s horse at\r\nUrachree; Colonel Herbert, killed in the main attack on the Irish\r\ncentre; Colonel Mongatts, who died among the Irish ditches while trying\r\nto rally his routed command; Major Devonish, Major Cornwall, Major Cox,\r\nand Major Colt. Many other officers of note died of their wounds at the\r\nfield hospital established on the neighboring heights of Garbally—now\r\nconverted into one of the most delightful demesnes in Europe; and some\r\nwho survived the field hospital died in the military hospitals of\r\nAthlone and Dublin. Those who fell in the battle were buried on the\r\nfield, with the usual military honors.\r\n\r\nCaptain Parker, who fought in the English army in this battle, and who\r\nhas left a narrative, frequently quoted by O’Callaghan, Haverty, Boyle,\r\nand other historians, says: “Our loss was about 3,000 men in killed and\r\nwounded,” and, as he was in the thick of the fight and came out\r\nunwounded, he had full opportunity, after the battle closed, to verify\r\nhis figures. He certainly could have no object in exaggerating the\r\nEnglish loss, for the tendency of all officers is to underrate the\r\ncasualties in their army. And Captain Parker says, further: “Had it not\r\nbeen that St. Ruth fell, it were hard to say how matters would have\r\nended, for, to do him justice, notwithstanding his oversight at Athlone,\r\nhe was certainly a gallant, brave man, and a good officer, as appeared\r\nby the disposition he made of his army this day.... His centre and right\r\nwing [after his fall] still held their ground, and had he lived to order\r\nSarsfield down to sustain his left wing, it would have given a turn to\r\naffairs on that side”—“or,” O’Callaghan says in comment, “in other\r\nwords, have given the victory to the Irish.”\r\n\r\nLord Macaulay—anti-Irish as all his writings prove him to have been—says\r\nin his “History of England”: “Those [the Irish] works were defended with\r\na resolution such as extorted some words of ungracious eulogy even from\r\nmen who entertained the strongest prejudices against the Celtic race.”\r\nHe then quotes Baurnett, Story, and, finally, the London “Gazette,” of\r\nJuly, 1691, which said: “The Irish were never known to fight with more\r\nresolution.”\r\n\r\nIn his interesting, but partial, “Life of William III,” published in the\r\nbeginning of the seventeenth century, Mr. Harris, a fierce\r\nanti-Jacobite, says: “It must, in justice, be confessed that the Irish\r\nfought this sharp battle with great resolution, which demonstrates that\r\nthe many defeats before this sustained by them can not be imputed to a\r\nnational cowardice with which some, without reason, impeached them; but\r\nto a defect in military discipline and the use of arms, or to a want of\r\nskill and experience in their commanders. And now, had not St. Ruth been\r\ntaken off, it would have been hard to say what the consequence of this\r\nday would have been.”\r\n\r\nNow we will give a few comments of the Irish historians upon this\r\nHastings of their country: O’Halloran, who was born about the time the\r\nbattle was fought, and who, as a native of Limerick, must have been, at\r\nleast, as familiar with soldiers who fought in the Williamite wars as we\r\nare with the Union and Confederate veterans, in Vol. I, page 106, of his\r\n“History of Ireland,” replying to some slurs cast by the Frenchman,\r\nVoltaire, on the Irish people, says: “He should have recollected that,\r\nat the battle of Aughrim, 15,000 Irish, ill paid and worse clothed,\r\nfought with 25,000 men highly appointed and the flower of all Europe,\r\ncomposed of English, Dutch, Flemings, and Danes, vieing with each other.\r\nThat, after a most bloody fight of some hours, these began to shrink on\r\nall sides, and would have received a most complete overthrow but for the\r\ntreachery of the commander of the Irish horse, and the death of their\r\ngeneral [St. Ruth] killed by a random shot.”\r\n\r\nOn pages 532-533 of the same work, the historian says: “Sir John\r\nDalrymple tells us that [at Aughrim] the priests ran up and down amongst\r\nthe ranks, swearing some on the sacrament, encouraging others, and\r\npromising eternity to all who should gallantly acquit themselves to\r\ntheir country that day. Does he mean this by way of apology for the\r\nintrepidity of the Irish, or to lessen the applause they were so well\r\nentitled to on that day? Have they required more persuasions to fight\r\nthe battles of foreign princes than the native troops, or are they the\r\nonly soldiers who require spiritual comfort on the day of trial? I never\r\nthought piety was a reproach to soldiers, and it was, perhaps, the\r\nenthusiasm of Oliver’s troops that made them so victorious. This battle\r\nwas, certainly, a bloody and decisive one. The stake was great, the\r\nIrish knew the value of it, and, though very inferior to their enemies\r\nin numbers and appointments, and chagrined by repeated losses, yet it\r\nmust be owned they fought it well. Accidents which human wisdom could\r\nnot foresee, more than the superior courage of their flushed enemies,\r\nsnatched from them that victory, which already began to declare in their\r\nfavor. Their bones yet (1744) lie scattered over the plains of Aughrim,\r\nbut let that justice be done to their memories which a brave and\r\ngenerous enemy never refuses.”\r\n\r\nAbbé McGeoghegan, who wrote about 1745, and was chaplain of the\r\nFranco-Irish Brigade, says in his “History of Ireland,” page 603: “The\r\nbattle began at one o’clock, with equal fury on both sides, and lasted\r\ntill night. James’s infantry performed prodigies of valor, driving the\r\nenemy three times back to their cannon.”\r\n\r\nRev. Thomas Leland, an Irish Protestant divine, who published a history\r\nof Ireland about 1763, after describing the catastrophe which befell St.\r\nRuth, says: “His [St. R.’s] cavalry halted, and, as they had no orders,\r\nreturned to their former station. The Irish beheld this retreat with\r\ndismay; they were confounded and disordered. Sarsfield, upon whom the\r\ncommand devolved, had been neglected by the proud Frenchman ever since\r\ntheir altercation at Athlone. As the order of battle had not been\r\nimparted to him, he could not support the dispositions of the late\r\ngeneral. The English, in the meantime, pressed forward, drove the enemy\r\nto their camp, pursued the advantage until the Irish, after an\r\nengagement supported with the fairest prospect of success, while they\r\nhad a general to direct their valor, fled precipitately.”\r\n\r\nThe Right Rev. Dr. Fitzgerald, Episcopalian bishop, in his “History of\r\nLimerick,” published some sixty years ago, says: “It [Aughrim] was the\r\nbravest battle ever fought on Irish soil.” The bishop, evidently, had\r\nnot read the lives of Art MacMurrough, Hugh O’Neill, Hugh O’Donnell, and\r\nOwen Roe O’Neill, when he penned the words.\r\n\r\n“Such,” writes O’Callaghan, at the conclusion of his account of it, in\r\nthe “Green Book,” page 230, “was the battle of Aughrim, or Kilconnell,\r\nas the French called it, from the old abbey to the left of the Irish\r\nposition; a battle unsuccessful, indeed, on the side of the Irish, but a\r\nChæronea, or a Waterloo, fought with heroism and lost without dishonor.”\r\n\r\nA. M. Sullivan, in his fascinating “Story of Ireland” (American edition,\r\npage 458), says, or rather, quotes from a Williamite authority: “The\r\nIrish infantry were so hotly engaged that they were not aware either of\r\nthe death of St. Ruth or of the flight of the cavalry, until they\r\nthemselves were almost surrounded. A panic and confused flight were the\r\nresult. The cavalry of the right wing, who were the first in action that\r\nday, were the last to quit the ground.... St. Ruth fell about sunset\r\n[8.10], and about 9, after three hours’ [nearer four hours’] hard\r\nfighting, the last of the Irish army [who were not killed, wounded, or\r\ncaptured] had left the field.”\r\n\r\nJohn Boyle, in his “Battlefields of Ireland,” quotes Taylor, an English\r\nmilitary author who fought at Aughrim, as saying: “Those [the Irish\r\ndead] were nearly all killed after the death of St. Ruth, for, up to\r\nthat, the Irish had lost scarcely a man;” and, says he, further, “large\r\nnumbers were murdered, after surrender and promise of quarter, by order\r\nof General Ginkel, and among those, so murdered, in cold blood, were\r\nColonel O’Moore and that most loyal gentleman and chivalrous soldier,\r\nLord Galway.” This same able writer, in concluding his graphic story of\r\nthe famous battle, remarks, with indignant eloquence: “It is painful to\r\nspeculate on the cause that left the Irish army without direction after\r\nthe death of St. Ruth. Many have endeavored to explain it, but all—as\r\nwell those who doubt Sarsfield’s presence on the field as those who\r\nmaintain the contrary—are lost in conjecture, and none who participated\r\nin the battle, and survived it, has placed the matter beyond\r\nspeculation. So leaving that point as time has left it, what appears\r\nmost strange in the connection is the absence of all command at such a\r\nconjuncture. The disposition of the Irish troops, though dexterous, was\r\nsimple. The day was all but won. The foiling of Talmash (Mackay) would\r\nhave been the completion of victory. A force sufficient was on his\r\nfront; a reserve more than ample to overwhelm him was on its way to the\r\nground—nay, drawn up and even ready for the word. The few British troops\r\nthat held a lodgment in the hedges, at the base of the hill, were\r\ncompletely at the mercy of those above them. It required no omniscient\r\neye to see this, nor a voice from the clouds to impel them forward, and,\r\nsurely, no military etiquette weighed a feather in opposition to the\r\nfate of a nation. Any officer of note could have directed the movement,\r\nand many of experience and approved courage witnessed the crisis. Yet,\r\nin this emergency, all the hard-won laurels of the day were tarnished,\r\nand land and liberty were lost by default! Nor can the rashness of St.\r\nRuth, his reticence as to his plans, his misunderstanding with\r\nSarsfield, nor the absence of the latter, justify the want of intrepid\r\naction among those present. This stands unexplained and inexplicable,\r\nnor will the flippant appeal to Providence, whose ways are too\r\nfrequently offered as an excuse for human misconduct, answer here. The\r\nwant of ammunition at such a moment was, no doubt, of some import, but\r\nthe concurrence of events too plainly indicates that Aughrim was won by\r\nthe skill of St. Ruth and the gallantry of his troops, and that it was\r\nlost through want of decision in his general officers, at a moment the\r\nmost critical in the nation’s history.”\r\n\r\nDe Ginkel’s army remained in the neighborhood of the field of battle\r\nlong enough to give it an opportunity of burying all of the Irish dead,\r\nwere it so disposed. The country-people remained away, in terror of\r\ntheir lives and poor belongings—particularly cattle—until decomposition\r\nhad so far advanced as to make the task of sepulture particularly\r\nrevolting. And thus it came to pass that nearly all the Irish slain were\r\nleft above ground, “exposed to the birds of the air and the beasts of\r\nthe field; many dogs frequenting the place afterward, and growing so\r\nfierce by feeding upon man’s flesh that it became dangerous for any\r\nsingle man to pass that way. And,” continues Story in his narrative so\r\nfrequently quoted, “there is a true and remarkable story of a greyhound\r\n[meaning the large, rapacious, and ferocious, Irish Wolf Dog that\r\nexisted in those days, although extinct since the last century]\r\nbelonging to an Irish officer: the gentleman was killed and stripped in\r\nthe battle, whose body the dog remained by night and day, and tho’ he\r\nfed on other corps [es] with the rest of the dogs, yet he would not\r\nallow them, or anything else, to touch that of his master. When all the\r\ncorps [es] were consumed, the other dogs departed, but he used to go in\r\nthe night to the adjacent villages for food, and presently to return\r\nagain to the place where his master’s bones were only then left; and\r\nthus he continued till January following, when one of Colonel Foulk’s\r\nsoldiers, being quartered nigh hand, and going that way by chance, the\r\ndog, fearing he came to disturb his master’s bones, flew upon the\r\nsoldier, who, being surprised at the suddenness of the thing, unslung\r\nhis piece, then upon his back, and killed the poor dog.”\r\n\r\nIreland’s national poet, Thomas Moore, in the beautiful words, set to\r\nthat weirdly mournful air: “The Lamentation of Aughrim,” thus pours out\r\nin deathless melody the heart of his unfortunate country:\r\n\r\n               “Forget not the field where they perished,—\r\n                  The truest; the last of the brave—\r\n                All gone and the bright hopes we cherished\r\n                  Gone with them and sunk in the grave.\r\n\r\n               “Oh, could we from death but recover\r\n                  Those hearts as they bounded before,\r\n                In the face of high heaven to fight over\r\n                  That combat for freedom once more.\r\n\r\n               “Could the chain for a moment be riven\r\n                  Which Tyranny flung round us then—\r\n                No, ’tis not in man, nor in heaven,\r\n                  To let Tyranny bind it again!\r\n\r\n               “But ’tis past; and tho’ blazoned in story\r\n                  The name of our victor may be;\r\n                Accurst is the march of that glory\r\n                  Which treads on the hearts of the free!\r\n\r\n               “Far dearer the grave, or the prison,\r\n                  Illumed by one patriot name,\r\n                Than the trophies of all who have risen\r\n                  On liberty’s ruin to fame!”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK VI\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATING OF THE PERIOD FROM THE SECOND SIEGE OF LIMERICK, IN 1691, TO\r\nTHE DISSOLUTION OF THE EXILED FRANCO-IRISH BRIGADE A CENTURY LATER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n  Second Siege of Limerick—Terrific Bombardment—The English, Aided by\r\n        Treachery, Cross the Shannon—Massacre of Thomond Bridge\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE decisive battle having been lost by Ireland, what followed in this\r\ncampaign became almost inevitable. Louis XIV and his ministers were\r\ncriminally culpable in encouraging the Irish people to resistance when\r\nthey did not mean to give them effective aid. Ireland had proved, in\r\nbreach and field, that she needed no foreign troops to do her fighting,\r\nbut she badly needed arms, ammunition, quartermaster’s supplies, and a\r\nmoney-chest. Perhaps the egotism of the French monarch and his advisers\r\nled them to underrate the importance of Ireland as a factor in the\r\naffairs of Europe, and the slanders of the perfidious Lauzun and his\r\nlieutenants had poisoned the mind of the ruler of France in regard to\r\nIrish valor. James, in his panic flight, had also carried with him to\r\nthe French court a most unfavorable impression, and some Irish\r\nwriters—among them Mr. Boyle—aver that Louis bitterly reproached the\r\nfallen king for his ignominious abandonment of Ireland after the affair\r\nof the Boyne. James, however, managed to conciliate his haughty cousin,\r\nand the latter made him still more promises of effective assistance.\r\n\r\nDe Ginkel, whose immediate objective, as before the great battle, was\r\nGalway, broke up his camp at Aughrim and marched to Loughrea, on July\r\n16. He reached Athenry the following day, and Oranmore on the 18th. At\r\nthis point he learned that Lord Dillon was Governor of Galway town, and\r\nthat the French general, D’Usson, commanded the garrison. Baal Dearg\r\nO’Donnell, with what remained of his irregular force, hovered about the\r\ncity, but failed to throw himself into it. It has been stated, on\r\nseemingly good authority, that the Irish officials within the town\r\ndistrusted him, as, indeed, was not unreasonable, seeing that Chaplain\r\nStory tells us that “his [O’Donnell’s] design was to keep amongst the\r\nmountains till he could make terms for himself, upon which account he\r\nwrit [wrote] the general, De Ginkel, before our army removed from\r\nGalway.” He followed up this treason in a practical manner, and, some\r\nmonths later on, as the Chaplain circumstantially informs us, the\r\nadventurer entered the service of William in the Continental wars, and\r\nalso received a pension of £500 per annum, for life, from the English\r\ntreasury. The same consideration was subsequently given to Brigadier\r\nHenry Luttrell, on whom popular Irish tradition has fixed the odium of\r\nhaving “sold the pass at Aughrim.” It is certain that twenty-six years\r\nafterward, A.D. 1717, this treacherous “general of the Irish horse” was\r\nshot to death in a sedan chair, while being carried through the streets\r\nof Dublin. No doubt remains among the Irish people that the deed was\r\ndone in reprisal for Luttrell’s villanous conduct in the campaign of\r\n1691, and some have gone so far as to charge him with having been the\r\nofficer who ordered the Irish cavalry off the field immediately after\r\nthe death of St. Ruth on Kilcommodan Hill.\r\n\r\nGalway, before which De Ginkel appeared on the 19th, after a respectable\r\nshow of resistance, surrendered with the honors of war, and sundry\r\nliberal civil provisions, on the 22d. On the 26th it was evacuated by\r\nthe Irish garrison, which marched to Limerick. This capitulation\r\nvirtually ended Irish resistance in Connaught, except for the town of\r\nSligo, which was stubbornly held by the gallant Sir Teague O’Regan, the\r\nhero of Charlemont, against a strong detachment of the English army,\r\nunder Lord Granard, until the following September 16, when he, too,\r\nhaving done all that a brave commander might, yielded his post with\r\nhonor, and was allowed to join the main Irish army in Limerick town. The\r\nadventurer, O’Donnell, assisted the English against Sligo. De Ginkel,\r\nafter garrisoning Galway, moved toward Limerick by way of Athenry,\r\nLoughrea, Eyrecourt, Banagher Bridge, Birr, Nenagh, and Caherconlish,\r\nmeeting but feeble resistance on his route. He halted at the\r\nlast-mentioned place to refresh and reinforce his army, and to provide\r\nhimself with a stronger siege train. This he finally brought up to the\r\nnumber of sixty “great guns,” none of them less than a twelve-pounder,\r\nand about a score of mortars for the throwing of large shells. About\r\nthis time, he issued several proclamations, and continued to do so\r\nthroughout the subsequent operations, with the design of seducing the\r\nIrish officers and soldiers from their allegiance to a desperate cause.\r\nIn this effort he was by no means successful, but several clever Irish\r\nspies passed themselves off as deserters, and gave him plenty of\r\nmisinformation regarding the condition of affairs at Limerick. While in\r\nthis camp at Caherconlish, the Dutch general’s attention was called to\r\nthe cupidity of the sutlers and other camp-followers, who appear to have\r\nbeen as greedy and conscienceless as their successor of our own times.\r\nThe gossipy Chaplain informs us, in this connection, that General Ginkel\r\n“sent out an order that all ale from Dublin and Wicklow should be sold\r\nat 6 pence [12 cents] per quart; all other ale, coming above forty\r\nmiles, at 5 pence, and all under forty miles at 4 pence; white bread to\r\nbe sold at 3 pence per pound; brown bread at 2 pence; claret at 2\r\nshillings and 6 pence, and Rhenish at 3 shillings [per quart]; brandy at\r\n12 shillings [$2.88] per gallon, etc.; and that no person should presume\r\nto exceed these rates on the penalty of forfeiting all his goods, and\r\nsuffering a month’s imprisonment. But they promptly found out a trick\r\nfor this,” continues Mr. Story in disgust, “and called _all_ drink that\r\ncame to the camp Dublin or Wicklow ale!” This “touch of nature” shows\r\nhow little mankind has changed in principle and practice after a lapse\r\nof more than six generations.\r\n\r\nDe Ginkel appeared in front of Limerick on August 25, and the city was\r\nimmediately invested on the south, east, and north. The Clare side,\r\nconnected by Thomond Bridge with Englishtown, or King’s Island, still\r\nremained unattacked, as no English force had passed the river. The Irish\r\nhorse and dragoons were all quartered on that side, while the infantry\r\ngarrisoned the threatened portions of the city.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the imposing array of Ginkel’s superb army and powerful\r\nsiege equipment as they approached the walls of their city, neither the\r\npeople nor the garrison of Limerick seem to have been much concerned by\r\nthe spectacle. The walls were much stronger than they had been in the\r\nprevious siege, and the soldiers were seasoned to hardship and peril.\r\nD’Usson, the French lieutenant-general, was in chief command, with his\r\nfellow-countryman, general, the Chevalier De Tessé, second, and\r\nSarsfield, it appears from the order of signature in the subsequent\r\ntreaty, was third in rank, with the Scotch general, Wauchop, fourth. The\r\nDuke of Tyrconnel had died of apoplexy—Story hints at poison\r\nadministered in wine—after dining heartily with the French generals and\r\nother officers on August 14. The misfortunes of his country, in the\r\nopinion of many writers, had more to do with hastening the end than any\r\nother cause. His remains lie under a nameless flagstone in the aisle of\r\nSt. Mauchin’s church in Limerick, but we are informed not even Irish\r\ntradition, usually so minute, can point out the exact place of\r\nsepulture. The powerful English batteries, raking the town on three\r\nsides, poured in torrents of bombs and red-hot cannon balls, day and\r\nnight, and the place caught fire at several points. Most of the women\r\nand children had to be removed to the cavalry camp on the Clare bank,\r\nand the casualties among the defenders were numerous. The Irish replied\r\nspiritedly, but they were very deficient in weight of metal, and, also,\r\nbecause of the comparative shortness of supply, had to be sparing of\r\ntheir ammunition, whereas the English were always sure of a fresh supply\r\nboth from the interior and their men-of-war on the adjacent coasts. The\r\nChaplain, under date of September 8, 1691, relates how the “new\r\nbatteries were all ready—one to the left with ten field-pieces to shoot\r\nred-hot ball; another to the right of 25 guns, all 24 and 18-pounders;\r\nand in the centre were placed 8 mortars, from 18¾ to 10½ inches in\r\ndiameter; these stood all together on the northeast of the town, nigh\r\nthe island; then there were 8 guns of 12-pound ball each, planted at\r\nMackay’s fort, and some also toward the river on the southwest, where\r\nthe Danes were posted. These fell to work all the time and put the Irish\r\ninto such a fright [more partisan venom] that a great many of them\r\nwished themselves at another place, having never heard such a noise\r\nbefore, nor I hope never shall in that kingdom.”\r\n\r\nThree days later the reverend chronicler tells us that “the breach was\r\nwidened at least forty paces, and, floats being prepared, there were\r\ngreat debates amongst the chief officers whether it should be attempted\r\nby storm.... Though indeed we could not do the enemy a greater pleasure,\r\nnor ourselves a greater prejudice, in all probability, than in seeking\r\nto carry the town by a breach, before those within [the Irish, to wit]\r\nwere more humbled, either by sword or sickness.” No finer tribute than\r\nthis, coming from such a source, could be paid to Irish constancy and\r\ncourage, after such treasons and disasters as marked the capture of\r\nAthlone and the loss of Aughrim.\r\n\r\nThoroughly convinced that he could not hope to carry Limerick by direct\r\nassault, De Ginkel now resolved to test the never-failing weapon of\r\ntreachery and surprise on this stubborn foe. He had information that\r\nthere was a strong peace-at-any-price party within the town, and that,\r\ncould he but land a strong force on the Clare bank of the Shannon, the\r\ncity would speedily capitulate. He, therefore, determined to construct,\r\nin all secrecy, a pontoon bridge across the river above St. Thomas\r\nIsland, near a place called Annaghbeg, where Brigadier Robert Clifford\r\ncommanded a strong body of Irish dragoons and infantry, quite\r\nsufficient, if only properly directed, to foil any hostile movement. On\r\nthe night of the 15th of September, the bridge was laid—the most\r\nfavorable point having been revealed by some fishermen, who, the\r\nhistorian O’Callaghan relates, were bribed to betray their country. It\r\nis much more probable, however, that they were forced to turn traitors\r\nunder threat of death. However, on the morning of the 16th the bridge\r\nwas completed and a formidable English force of horse and foot, under\r\nGenerals Talmash and Scravenmore, succeeded in crossing. Apparently\r\ntaken by surprise—although distinctly charged with treason by numerous\r\nIrish historians—General Clifford, at this important juncture, displayed\r\nneither zeal, courage, nor capacity. He brought his men up in a state of\r\nunreadiness and in detachments, instead of in a solid formation, and, of\r\ncourse, was easily put to rout. To show the criminal carelessness, to\r\nsay no worse, of this commander, his cavalry horses were “out at grass”\r\ntwo miles from his camp, when the English attack was made! Such\r\n“generalship” would have demoralized an army of Spartans, and the Irish\r\nrank and file can hardly be blamed if, on this occasion, they did not\r\nmanifest their customary intrepidity. Europe never beheld in the field a\r\nbraver body of men than King James’s Irish army, and the world never\r\nfurnished a more incompetent staff of general officers, whether French\r\nor Irish, than that which commanded and, finally, wrecked it. We wish to\r\nexcept St. Ruth and Sarsfield and Boisseleau, who were able and gallant\r\nsoldiers, thoroughly devoted to the cause in which they had embarked. De\r\nGinkel’s bold movement resulted in the partial turning of Thomond\r\nBridge—the key to King’s Island—and the capture of St. Thomas Island,\r\nanother important Irish post above the city. He, therefore, felt\r\njustified in issuing, that same day, a proclamation inviting the\r\ngarrison of Limerick to surrender on honorable conditions, but the\r\nIrish, although now under a veritable rain of fire and iron from every\r\npoint of the compass, paid no heed to it, whereat the phlegmatic, but\r\nskilful, Dutch strategist greatly marveled.\r\n\r\nBut, although the river had been successfully passed, Ginkel was so\r\ndiscouraged by the firm countenance of the Irish garrison that he called\r\na Council of War on the 17th, when it was, at first, decided to cross\r\nthe whole English army into Clare, destroy the Irish resources of food\r\nand forage in that county, and then convert the siege into a blockade\r\nthat might last indefinitely. Reflection, however, changed this\r\ndecision. Winter was approaching, and the wet Irish winter meant\r\nwholesale death to the soft and pampered English and their foreign\r\nallies. Ginkel, then, resolved to again try his favorite manœuvre—a\r\nturning movement. Accordingly, on September 22, at the head of the\r\ngreater portion of the allied army, he crossed the pontoon bridge and,\r\ncommanding in person, made a sudden and tremendous attack on the small\r\nfort which commanded Thomond Bridge, and was garrisoned by about 800\r\nIrish soldiers. The English cannon soon covered this fort with red-hot\r\nprojectiles. Everything inflammable in the soldiers’ quarters caught\r\nfire, and the desperate garrison made a sortie with the object of\r\ncrossing into King’s Island by Thomond Bridge. The connection was by\r\nmeans of a draw. A little over a hundred of the Irish had crossed in\r\nsafety, when the French major in command at the drawbridge, fearing, it\r\nis said, that the English might enter the town with the fugitives,\r\ncaused it suddenly to be raised. The men behind were not able to see\r\nwhat had happened, and the foremost ranks that stood on the western\r\nabutment were forced over the gulf and nearly all perished in the river.\r\nThe others put up white handkerchiefs in token of surrender, but the\r\nsavage victors showed no mercy. Story, who saw the whole sickening\r\nbutchery, paints the scene in ghastly fashion thus: “Before the killing\r\nwas over, they [the Irish] were laid in heaps upon the bridge, higher\r\nthan the ledges of it.” Out of 800 men, only the five score and odd that\r\ngained the drawbridge in time, and the few strong ones who swam the\r\nriver, escaped. It, on a smaller scale, resembled the disaster at\r\nLeipsic, in 1813, when the French Major of Engineers, Montfort, caused\r\nthe bridge over the Elster to be blown up, while yet the corps of\r\nMacDonald and Poniatowski, which formed Napoleon’s rearguard, were on\r\nthe hostile bank of the river. Thus, through the stupidity, or panic, of\r\na subordinate officer, the emperor lost the Polish marshal, who was one\r\nof his best generals, and 20,000 of his choicest troops. A fool or\r\ncoward commanding at a bridge over which an army is compelled to\r\nretreat, is more deadly to his friends than all the bullets and sabres\r\nof the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n  Capitulation of Limerick—Terms of the Famous “Violated Treaty”—Cork\r\n                             Harbor Tragedy\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Irish cavalry, which would seem to have been inefficiently commanded\r\nby General Sheldon during the late operations, and now completely\r\noutnumbered, fell back to Six-Mile-Bridge in Clare, dejected and almost\r\nhopeless. The men had lost faith in their commanders, and that meant a\r\nspeedy end of effective resistance. When it became known in Limerick\r\nthat the enemy had been successful beyond the river, the peace party\r\nbegan again to clamor loudly for a capitulation. A party eager for\r\nsurrender within a beleaguered city is the very best ally a besieging\r\nforce can have. In this case, their treason or pusillanimity proved the\r\ndestruction of their country. De Ginkel had positive information that a\r\ngreat French fleet, under a renowned admiral, Count Chateau-Renaud, was\r\nfitting out at Brest for the relief of Limerick. Therefore he was ready\r\nto promise almost anything in order to gain the timely surrender of the\r\nplace, for he knew that if the French once landed in force, all the\r\nfruits of his recent victories would be irretrievably spoiled. The\r\nbuoyant Irish would rally again more numerously than ever, better\r\ndrilled, equipped, and thoroughly inured to war. His good opinion of\r\ntheir fighting qualities was unequivocally shown in his eagerness to\r\nenlist them as soldiers under the banner of King William. He felt\r\nmorally certain that Sarsfield and the other chief Irish officers were\r\nentirely ignorant of the preparations going on in France. They imagined\r\nthemselves absolutely deserted by that power. Irish tradition credits\r\nGeneral Sarsfield with a disposition to hold out to the last, while it\r\nis believed, on the same rather unreliable authority, that the French\r\ngenerals, D’Usson and De Tessé, favored an honorable and immediate\r\nsurrender. It is certain that most of the Anglo-Irish officers were\r\ntired of the war and desired to have an end of it on any reasonable\r\nterms. Ginkel was still over the river in Clare, when, on the evening of\r\nSeptember 23, the Irish drums, from several points in the town, beat a\r\nparley. The siege had lasted almost a month, and the English officers\r\nwere delighted at the near prospect of peace. They received Sarsfield,\r\nWauchop, and their escort, under a flag of truce, with military\r\ncourtesy, and directed them where to find the general-in-chief. The\r\nIrish officers crossed the Shannon in a rowboat, and found Ginkel in his\r\ncamp by Thomond Bridge. He received them favorably, and a temporary\r\ncessation of hostilities was agreed upon. Next morning, it was decided\r\nto extend it three days. Then it was determined that the Irish officers\r\nand commands separated from the Limerick garrison should be communicated\r\nwith, and that all, if terms were agreed upon, would surrender\r\nsimultaneously. Meanwhile the English and Irish officers exchanged\r\ncourtesies and frequently dined together, although the French generals\r\nheld aloof, for some reason that has never been satisfactorily\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nBut now the ultra peace party having, in a measure, the upper hand,\r\nsought to commit the Irish army to a dishonorable and ungrateful\r\npolicy—the abandonment of France, which, with all its faults, was\r\nIreland’s sole ally. Hostages were exchanged by the two armies, those\r\nfor England being Lord Cutts, Sir David Collier, Colonel Tiffin, and\r\nColonel Piper; and for Ireland Lords Westmeath, Iveagh (whose entire\r\nregiment afterward passed over to William), Trimelstown, and Louth.\r\nFollowing the arrival of the latter in the English camp came the peace\r\nparty’s proposals, which stipulated for the freedom of Catholic worship\r\nand the maintenance of civil rights, and then basely proposed that “the\r\nIrish army be kept on foot, paid, et cetera, the same as the rest of\r\ntheir majesties’ forces, in case they were willing to serve their\r\nmajesties against France or any other enemy.”\r\n\r\nThe Irish army, nobly chivalrous and patriotic, with the usual base\r\nexceptions to be found in every considerable body of men, was not\r\nwilling “to serve their majesties” as intimated, as will be seen further\r\nalong. Ginkel, who was thoroughly coached by the “royal commissioners”\r\nfrom Dublin, who were rarely absent from his camp, rejected the\r\nPalesmen’s propositions, chiefly because of the Catholic claims put\r\nforward in them. There is no evidence whatever that Sarsfield\r\ncountenanced the policy attempted to be carried out by this contemptible\r\nfaction.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th all the parties in Limerick town came to an agreement in\r\nregard to what they would propose to and accept from De Ginkel. The\r\nlatter, who was quite a diplomatic as well as military “bluffer,” began\r\nopenly to prepare his batteries for a renewal of the bombardment—the\r\nthree days’ cessation having nearly come to an end. But, on the day\r\nstated, there came to him, from out of Limerick, Generals Sarsfield\r\n(Lord Lucan), Wauchop, the Catholic Primate, Baron Purcell, the\r\nArchbishop of Cashel, Sir Garret Dillon, Sir Theobald (“Toby”) Butler,\r\nand Colonel Brown, “the three last counselors-at-law, with several other\r\nofficers and commissioners.” Baron De Ginkel summoned all of his chief\r\ngenerals to meet them, and “after a long debate, articles were agreed\r\non, not only for the town of Limerick, but for all the other forts and\r\ncastles in the kingdom, then in the enemies’ possession.” In compliance\r\nwith the wish of the Irish delegation, De Ginkel agreed to summon the\r\nLords Justices from Dublin to ratify the treaty. These functionaries,\r\nauthoritatively representing King William and Queen Mary, soon arrived\r\nat the camp and signed the instrument in due form. The French generals,\r\nalthough they did not accompany the Irish commissioners on their visit\r\nto Ginkel, signed the terms of capitulation with the rest, the names\r\nappearing in the following order: D’Usson, Le Chevalier de Tessé, Latour\r\nMonfort, Mark Talbot, Lucan (Sarsfield), Jo Wauchop, Galmoy, M. Purcell.\r\nFor England there signed Lords Justices Charles Porter and Thomas\r\nConyngsby, Baron De Ginkel, and Generals Scravenmore, Mackay, and\r\nTalmash.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Limerick was thus consummated on October 3, 1691, with all\r\nthe required forms and ceremonies, so that no loophole of informality\r\nwas left for either party to this international compact. In the treaty\r\nthere were 29 military and 13 civil articles. As they were quite\r\nlengthy, we will confine ourselves to a general summary, thus:\r\n\r\nAll the adherents of King James in Ireland were given permission to go\r\nbeyond the seas to any country they might choose to live in, except\r\nEngland and Scotland. Volunteers and rapparees were included in this\r\nprovision, as well as the officers and soldiers of the Irish regular\r\narmy. These voluntary exiles were allowed to depart from Ireland in\r\n“whole bodies, companies, or parties;” and it was provided that, if\r\nplundered by the way, the English Government would grant compensation\r\nfor such losses as they might sustain. It was agreed that fifty ships of\r\n200 tons burden each should be provided for their transportation, and\r\ntwenty of the same tonnage in addition, if it should be found necessary,\r\nand that “said ships should be furnished with forage for horses and all\r\nnecessary provisions to subsist the officers, troopers, dragoons, and\r\n[foot] soldiers, and all other persons [meaning families and followers]\r\nthat are shipped to be transported into France.” In addition, two\r\nmen-of-war were placed at the disposal of the principal officers for the\r\nvoyage, and suitable provision was made for the safe return of all\r\nvessels when their mission of transportation was accomplished. The\r\nthrifty De Ginkel further stipulated that the provisions supplied to the\r\nmilitary exiles should be paid for by their government as soon as the\r\nIrish troops were landed on French soil. Article XXV provided: “That it\r\nshall be lawful for the said garrison [of Limerick] to march out at\r\nonce, or at different times, as they can be embarked, with arms,\r\nbaggage, drums beating, match lighted at both ends, bullet in mouth,\r\ncolors flying, six brass guns, such as the besieged shall choose, two\r\nmortar pieces, and half the ammunition that is now in the magazines of\r\nthe said place.” This provision, which, as can be seen, included the\r\nfull “honors of war,” was also extended to the other capitulated Irish\r\ngarrisons. Another significant provision was that all Irish officers and\r\nsoldiers who so desired could join the army of King William, retaining\r\nthe rank and pay they enjoyed in the service of King James.\r\n\r\nOf the civil articles, the first read as follows: “The Roman Catholics\r\nof this kingdom shall enjoy such privileges in the exercise of their\r\nreligion as are consistent with the laws of Ireland, or as they did\r\nenjoy in the reign of King Charles II; and their Majesties, as soon as\r\ntheir affairs will permit them to summon a Parliament in this kingdom,\r\nwill endeavor to procure the said Roman Catholics such further security\r\nin that particular as may preserve them from disturbance upon the\r\naccount of their said religion.”\r\n\r\nThe second article guaranteed protection in the possession of their\r\nestates and the free pursuit of their several professions, trades, and\r\ncallings to all who had served King James, the same as under his own\r\nrégime, on the taking of the subjoined oath of allegiance prescribed by\r\nstatute: “I —— do solemnly promise and swear that I will be faithful and\r\nbear true allegiance to their Majesties, King William and Queen Mary: so\r\nhelp me God.” A subsequent article provided that “the oath to be\r\nadministered to such Roman Catholics as submit to their Majesties’\r\ngovernment shall be the oath aforesaid and no other”—thus doing away, as\r\nthe Irish honestly supposed, with the odious penal “Test oaths,” which\r\nwere an outrage on Catholic belief and a glaring insult to the Catholics\r\nof the whole world.\r\n\r\nThe third article extended the benefit of the first and second articles\r\nto Irish merchants “beyond the seas” who had not borne arms since the\r\nproclamation issued by William and Mary in the preceding February, but\r\nthey were required to return to Ireland within eight months.\r\n\r\nArticle IV granted like immunity to Irish officers in foreign lands,\r\nabsent in pursuance of their military duties, and naming, specially,\r\nColonel Simon Luttrell (the loyal brother of the traitor, Henry),\r\nColonel Rowland White, Colonel Maurice Eustace, of Gormanstown, and\r\nMajor Cheviers (Chevers) of Maystown, “commonly called Mount Leinster.”\r\n\r\nArticle V provided that all persons comprised in the second and third\r\narticles should have general pardon for all “attainders, outlawries,\r\ntreasons (?), misprisions of treasons, præmunires, felonies, trespasses,\r\nand other crimes and misdemeanors whatsoever, committed by them, or any\r\nof them since the beginning of the reign of James II; and if any of them\r\nare attainted by Parliament, the Lords Justices and the General will use\r\ntheir best endeavors to get the same repealed by Parliament, and the\r\noutlawries to be reversed gratis, all but writing-clerk’s fees.”\r\n\r\nArticle VI provided general immunity to both parties for debts or\r\ndisturbances arising out of the late war. This provision applied also to\r\nrates and rents.\r\n\r\nArticle VII provided that “every nobleman and gentleman comprised in the\r\nsecond and third articles shall have liberty to ride with a sword and\r\ncase of pistols, if they [_sic_] think fit, and keep a gun in their\r\nhouses for the defence of the same, or for fowling.”\r\n\r\nThe eighth article granted leave to the inhabitants, or residents, of\r\nLimerick, and other Irish garrisons, to remove their goods and chattels,\r\nif so disposed, without interference, search, or the payment of duties,\r\nand they were privileged to remain in their lodgings for six weeks.\r\n\r\nThe tenth article declared that “no person, or persons, who shall at any\r\ntime hereafter break these articles, or any of them, shall thereby make\r\nor cause any other person or persons to forfeit or lose the benefit of\r\nthe same.”\r\n\r\nArticle XII read thus: “The Lords Justices and the General do undertake\r\nthat their Majesties will ratify these articles within the space of\r\nthree months, or sooner, and use their utmost endeavors that the same\r\nshall be ratified and confirmed in the Parliament.”\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth, and final, article made provision for the protection\r\nfrom financial loss of Colonel John Browne, commissary-general of the\r\nIrish army, who, during the war, had seized the property of certain\r\nWilliamites for the public use, charging the debt, pro rata, on the\r\nCatholic estates secured to their owners under the treaty; and requiring\r\nGeneral (Lord Lucan) to certify the account with Colonel Browne within\r\n21 days.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered, in examining the religious provisions of the\r\nTreaty of Limerick, that Catholic worship in the reign of Charles II was\r\npermitted by connivance rather than by law. Many of the worst of the\r\npenal laws, although in abeyance, might be revived at any time by law\r\nofficers tyrannically disposed toward the Catholics. The latter were\r\nonce again to discover that it is one thing to obtain a favorable treaty\r\nfrom a formidable enemy, while they have arms in their hands and a still\r\ninviolate fortress at their backs, but quite a different matter to make\r\nthe foe live up to the provisions of the treaty when the favorable\r\nconditions for the capitulators have passed away. But of this hereafter.\r\n\r\nNot many days subsequent to the surrender of Limerick, Count\r\nChateau-Renaud, with a powerful French fleet, having on board arms,\r\ncannon, and all kinds of military supplies, together with a veteran\r\ncontingent of 3,000 men and 200 officers, cast anchor in Dingle Bay, on\r\nthe southern coast, without once coming in contact with the naval might\r\nof England. Were the Irish a dishonorable people, they could have then,\r\nwith great advantage, repudiated the treaty, but the national honor was\r\nirrevocably plighted, and, consequently, there was an end of the\r\nstruggle. Many honest Irish writers have blamed the precipitancy of\r\nSarsfield and the other leaders in signing the articles of capitulation,\r\nand not without good cause. Lord Lucan should have court-martialed and\r\nshot the leaders of the peace-at-any-price traitors when they first\r\nshowed their hands. Hugh O’Neill, Red Hugh O’Donnell, or Owen Roe\r\nO’Neill would have done so without hesitation, but, then, Sarsfield was\r\nonly half a Celt, and had an unfortunate tenderness for his fellows of\r\nthe Pale. It is regrettable that none of the French generals has left a\r\nclear statement of the events that led to the premature surrender of the\r\ntown; but we know that King Louis, who subsequently honored Sarsfield,\r\nheld D’Usson responsible, for Story tells us, on page 280 of his\r\n“Continuation of the History of the Wars in Ireland,” that “the French\r\nking [Louis XIV] was so far from thanking him for it [the capitulation]\r\nthat, after some public indignities, he sent him to the Bastile.”\r\n\r\nViewed in the light of after events, the Treaty of Limerick, from the\r\nIrish standpoint, looks like a huge game of confidence, and is an\r\nineradicable blot on English military and diplomatic honor. The civil\r\narticles were ignored, or trampled under foot, almost immediately. The\r\nmilitary articles were better observed, except that provision which\r\nrelated to transportation to France, which was grossly violated and led\r\nto the drowning in Cork Harbor of a number of the wives of the Irish\r\nsoldiery, who, unable to find room on board, owing to De Ginkel’s\r\nalleged faithlessness, or the perfidy of his lieutenants, clung to the\r\nropes, when the ships set sail, and were dragged beneath the waves to\r\ntheir death.\r\n\r\nMitchel, in his able “History of Ireland,” page 3, writing of this\r\npainful incident, defends Sarsfield against an imputation cast upon that\r\nofficer by Lord Macaulay, in his brilliant but unreliable “History of\r\nEngland,” thus: “As to General Sarsfield’s proclamation to the men ‘that\r\nthey should be permitted to carry their wives and families to France,’\r\nhe made the statement on the faith of the First and several succeeding\r\narticles of the treaty, not yet being aware of any design to violate it.\r\nBut this is not all: The historian who could not let the hero go into\r\nhis sorrowful exile without seeking to plunge his venomous sting into\r\nhis reputation, had before him the ‘Life of King William,’ by Harris,\r\nand also Curry’s ‘Historical Review of the Civil Wars,’ wherein he must\r\nhave seen that the Lords Justices and General Ginkel are charged with\r\nendeavoring to defeat the execution of the First Article. For, says\r\nHarris, ‘as great numbers of the officers and soldiers had resolved to\r\nenter into the service of France, and to carry their families with them,\r\nGinkel would not suffer their wives and children to be shipped off with\r\nthe men, not doubting that by detaining the former he would have\r\nprevented many of the latter from going into that service. This, I say,\r\nwas confessedly an infringement of the articles.’\r\n\r\n“To this we may add,” continues Mitchel, “that no Irish officer or\r\nsoldier in France attributed the cruel parting at Cork to any fault of\r\nSarsfield, but always and only to a breach of the Treaty of Limerick.\r\nAnd if he had deluded them in the manner represented by the English\r\nhistorian, they would not have followed him as enthusiastically [as they\r\nafterward did] on the fields of Steinkirk and Landen.”\r\n\r\nMr. Mitchel did Lord Macaulay an unintentional injustice in attributing\r\nthe original charge against Sarsfield to him. It originated with\r\nChaplain Story, and can be found on pages 291-293 of his Continuation,\r\nin these words: “Those [of the Irish] who were now embarking had not\r\nmuch better usage on this side of the water [he had alluded to the\r\nalleged ill-treatment of the first contingent on its arrival in France],\r\nfor a great many of them, having wives and children, they made what\r\nshift they could to desert, rather than leave their families behind to\r\nstarve, which my Lord Lucan and Major-General Wauchop perceiving, they\r\npublish a declaration that as many of the Irish as had a mind to’t\r\nshould have liberty to transport their families along with themselves.\r\nAnd, accordingly, a vast rabble of all sorts were brought to the\r\nwater-side, when the major-general [Wauchop], pretending to ship the\r\nsoldiers in order, according to their lists, they first carried all the\r\nmen on board; and many of the women, at the second return of the boats\r\nfor the officers, catching hold to be carried on board, were dragged\r\noff, and, through fearfulness, losing their hold, were drowned; but\r\nothers who held faster had their fingers cut off, and so perished in\r\nsight of their husbands or relatives, tho’ those of them that did get\r\nover [to France], would make but a sad figure, if they were admitted to\r\ngo to the late queen’s court at St. Germain.... Lord Lucan finding he\r\nhad ships enough for all the Irish that were likely to go with him, the\r\nnumber that went before and these shipped at this time, being, according\r\nto the best computation, 12,000 of all sorts [a palpable underestimate],\r\nhe signs the following releasement:\r\n\r\n    “‘Whereas, by the Articles of Limerick, Lieutenant-General\r\n    Ginkel, commander-in-chief of the English army, did engage\r\n    himself to furnish 10,000 tons of shipping for the transporting\r\n    of such of the Irish forces to France as were willing to go\r\n    thither; and to facilitate their passage to add 4,000 tons more\r\n    in case the French fleet did not come to this kingdom to take\r\n    off some of these forces; and whereas the French fleet has been\r\n    upon the coast and carried away some of the said forces, and the\r\n    lieutenant-general has provided ships for as many of the rest as\r\n    are willing to go as aforesaid, I do hereby declare that the\r\n    said lieutenant-general is released from any obligation he lay\r\n    under from the said articles, to provide vessels for that\r\n    purpose, and do quit and renounce all farther claim and\r\n    pretension on this account, etc. Witness my hand this 8th day of\r\n    December, 1691.\r\n\r\n                                                            “‘LUCAN.\r\n\r\n       “‘_Witnesses_:\r\n         MARK TALBOT,\r\n         F. H. DE LA FOREST, SUSANNEL.’”\r\n\r\nFrom the same authority we learn that “on December 22, my Lord Lucan,\r\nand the rest of the Irish great officers, went on board the transport\r\nships [bound for France], leaving hostages at Cork for the return of the\r\nsaid ships.”\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to reconcile the circumstantial statement of the\r\nWilliamite historian, Harris, in regard to Ginkel’s faithlessness, with\r\nthe official document, signed by Sarsfield, as Earl of Lucan, which\r\npractically exonerates the Dutch general. Would Sarsfield have signed\r\nsuch a release if Ginkel had been guilty of the treachery ascribed to\r\nhim by Harris? Story’s book was published a year before Lord Lucan fell\r\nin Flanders, and must have been read by that general and the officers\r\nwho served with him at Limerick. One thing about the question is\r\ncertain—if Sarsfield ever issued the proclamation, in conjunction with\r\nGeneral Wauchop, ascribed to him by the English chaplain, he must have\r\nbeen grossly deceived by somebody. All writers of his own times, and of\r\nafter times, describe Sarsfield as the soul of honor, but some have\r\nasserted that he was rather easy-going in business affairs, and a little\r\ntoo ready to sign any document placed before him.\r\n\r\nWe have been unable to find any contemporary confirmation of the\r\nromantic Irish tradition that the Treaty of Limerick was signed on the\r\nhistoric bowlder, now preserved by pedestal and railing near Thomond\r\nBridge, on the Clare bank of the Shannon. But tradition is often more\r\naccurate than written history. Therefore, the Irish people having\r\naccepted the story through more than six generations, we accept with\r\nthem the legend of “the Treaty Stone.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n  The Irish Troops, as a Majority, Enter the French Service—King James\r\n  Receives Them Cordially—His Testimony of Their Devotion and Courage\r\n\r\n\r\nIMMEDIATELY after the signing of the treaty, it was fixed upon between\r\nDe Ginkel and Sarsfield that, on October 6, the Irish infantry would\r\nmarch out of the King’s Island by Thomond Bridge, into the County Clare,\r\nand there and then make a choice of service with England or France. It\r\nwas arranged that those who chose the former service were to turn to the\r\nleft at a certain point, where an English flag was planted, while those\r\nwho decided for France were to march straight onward to a more distant\r\npoint marked by the French standard. They were, in all, about 15,000\r\nmen, and, quite naturally, the respective leaders awaited the result\r\nwith burning anxiety. They were not left long in doubt. The first body\r\nto march was the Royal Irish regiment of Foot Guards, fourteen hundred\r\nstrong, of which Mr. Story remarks wofully, it “seemed to go all entire\r\n[for France] except seven men, which the general was much concerned at,\r\nthen my Lord Iveagh’s regiment of Ulster Irish came off entire to our\r\nside.” In all a little over 1,000 officers and men ranged themselves\r\nunder the flag of King William, while nearly 13,000 mustered under the\r\nFleur-de-Lis. A few days afterward, the Irish horse, now much reduced,\r\nmade choice in the same fashion, and with about the same proportionate\r\nresult. The same privilege was granted the outlying bodies of King\r\nJames’s army, and all decided for France in the proportion of about ten\r\nto one. Of the Irish general officers, more or less under the suspicion\r\nof the army since the disasters of Aughrim and Annaghbeg, we find\r\nGenerals Luttrell and Clifford, Baron Purcell, “and a great many more of\r\nthe Irish nobility and gentry going toward Dublin,” which means that\r\nthey made terms with the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt was well along in the month of December before the Irish soldiers who\r\nhad volunteered to go beyond the seas were entirely transported to\r\nFrance. The foot, for the most part, sailed from Limerick, many of them\r\nin the returning fleet of Chateau-Renaud, and the cavalry from Cork,\r\nwhere occurred the tragical event we have already related. In\r\nall—including the capitulated troops from every Irish garrison—20,000\r\nmen from Ireland landed in the French ports, and these, together with\r\nMountcashel’s Brigade, which had been in the French service since before\r\nthe battle of the Boyne, made up a force of 25,000 veterans, who were\r\nmostly in the pay of King Louis, but all of whom were sworn to support\r\nKing James in any effort he might put forth to recover his crown.\r\n\r\nAs much injustice has been done the memory of King James II by Irish\r\nwriters, who have taken too much for granted on traditional “hearsay,”\r\nwe deem it only fair to place before the readers of this history the\r\nsentiments of the unfortunate monarch toward his Irish defenders. We\r\nquote from his Memoirs, Vol. II, pp. 465-467: “Thus was Ireland [he\r\nalluded to the fall of Limerick], after an obstinate resistance in three\r\nyears’ campaigns, by the power and riches of England, and the revolt of\r\nalmost all its [Ireland’s] own Protestant subjects torn from its natural\r\nsovereign, who, tho’ he was divested of the country, was not wholly\r\ndeprived of the people, for the greatest part of those who were then in\r\narms for the defence of his right, not content with the service already\r\nrendered, got leave [as was said] to come and lose their lives, after\r\nhaving lost their estates, in defence of his title, and brought by that\r\nmeans such a body of men into France as by their generous comportment in\r\naccepting the pay of the country [much less than British or Irish pay]\r\ninstead of that which is usually allowed there [in France] to strangers\r\nand their inimitable valor and service during the whole course of the\r\nwar, might justly make their prince pass for an ally, rather than a\r\npensioner, or burden, to his Most Christian Majesty, whose pay, indeed,\r\nthey received, but acted by the king’s, their master’s, commission,\r\naccording to the common method of other auxiliary troops. As soon as the\r\nking [James] heard of their arrival [in France] he writ to the commander\r\n[General Sheldon, who went with the first contingent] to assure him how\r\nwell he was satisfied with the behavior and conduct of the officers, and\r\nthe valor and fidelity of the soldiers, and how sensible he should ever\r\nbe of their service, which he would not fail to reward when it should\r\nplease God to put him in a capacity of doing it.”\r\n\r\nFollowing is the full text of the letter addressed to the Irish troops\r\nthrough their general by King James, as given in Story’s Continuation,\r\npage 289:\r\n\r\n    “JAMES REX.\r\n\r\n    “Having been informed of the capitulation and surrender of\r\n    Limerick, and the other places which remained to us in our\r\n    Kingdom of Ireland, and of the necessities which forced the\r\n    Lords Justices and general officers of our forces thereunto: we\r\n    will not defer to let you know, and the rest of the officers\r\n    that came along with you, that we are extremely satisfied with\r\n    your and their conduct, and of the valor of the soldiers during\r\n    the siege, but most particularly of your and their declaration\r\n    and resolution to come and serve where we are. And we assure\r\n    you, and order you to assure both officers and soldiers that are\r\n    come along with you, that we shall never forget this act of\r\n    loyalty, nor fail, when in a capacity to give them, above\r\n    others, particular marks of our favor. In the meantime, you are\r\n    to inform them that they are to serve under our command, and by\r\n    our commissions; and if we find that a considerable number [of\r\n    them] is come with the fleet, it will induce us to go personally\r\n    to see them, and regiment them: Our brother, the King of France,\r\n    hath already given orders to clothe them and furnish them with\r\n    all necessaries, and to give them quarters of refreshment. So we\r\n    bid you heartily farewell.\r\n\r\n    “Given at our Court at St. Germain the 27th of November [Dec.\r\n    7], 1691.”\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of his promise, King James made two fatiguing trips from\r\nSt. Germain to Bretagne and return, regimented the gallant exiles at\r\nVannes, Brest, and other points, and in every possible way showed his\r\nmarked appreciation of their devotion. He was accompanied by his son,\r\nthe Duke of Berwick.\r\n\r\nIn accepting French pay, the Irish soldiery exposed themselves almost to\r\npenury, and their officers submitted to be reduced in rank, almost\r\nwithout a murmur. Major-generals became colonels; colonels, captains;\r\ncaptains, lieutenants, and many of the latter sergeants. This was\r\nabsolutely necessary, as there was room for only a certain number in the\r\nFrench establishment. Many reduced officers served also as volunteers,\r\nwithout pay of any kind, waiting patiently for death or promotion. The\r\ntotal amount of property sacrificed by these brave men in the Jacobite\r\ncause was 1,060,792 acres, and this new confiscation placed fully\r\nseven-eighths of the soil of Ireland in the hands of the supporters of\r\nthe English interest.\r\n\r\nWilliam and Mary formally ratified the Articles of the Treaty of\r\nLimerick within the specified three months, but the English Parliament,\r\ninfluenced by motives of greed and bigotry, shamefully refused to\r\nacquiesce, and as William and Mary did not endanger their crown by\r\noffering a vigorous opposition, the civil articles of Limerick were,\r\nfrom that moment, a dead letter. Then redescended on Ireland “the long,\r\nblack night of the penal laws,” and we gladly turn from it, for a\r\nperiod, to follow the brilliant but bloody fortunes of the Irish Brigade\r\nin the service of France.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n Early Exploits of the Irish Brigade in the Service of France—At Landen,\r\n      Cremona, and Blenheim—Tribute Paid it by an English Historian\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the preceding chapter we indicated that we would deal with the\r\nhistory of the Irish brigades in the French service, from 1692 to 1792,\r\nbefore touching on the terrible penal period in Ireland. Their services\r\nhave won a fame so world-wide that no history of Europe is complete that\r\nomits them from its pages. They were prominently engaged in the reign of\r\nLouis XIV in the War of the League of Augsburg, which was hotly waged by\r\nnearly all Europe against him, from 1688 to the Peace of Ryswick, in\r\n1697; in the War of the Spanish Succession—waged by Louis to support his\r\ngrandson, Philip of Anjou, on the Spanish throne—commenced in 1700 and\r\nconcluded by the Peace of Utrecht and Treaty of Rastadt in 1713-14, and\r\nunder Louis XV in numerous minor wars with Germany, and especially in\r\nthe War of the Austrian Succession—France supporting the claim of\r\nCharles VII, of Bavaria, against Maria Theresa, Queen of Hungary,\r\ndaughter of the last Hapsburg Emperor of Germany, Charles VI. This war\r\nwas begun in 1740. France took sides in 1743, and it was concluded by\r\nthe Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748. In each of these contests France\r\nand England were on opposite sides—a circumstance favorable to the\r\nbloody development of Irish hatred. After the last of the wars\r\nspecified, the Irish Brigade, having no warlike food on which to\r\nflourish, covered with laurels and “worn out with glory,” faded from the\r\nfields of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn another place we have alluded to the campaign of Savoy, 1690-91, in\r\nwhich the ill-starred St. Ruth was chief in command. Mountcashel’s,\r\nknown as the “Old Brigade,” scaled every Alpine fortress, drove the\r\nvengeful “Vaudois” from their rugged hills, and laid the country under\r\nfire and sword, leaving a reputation for military prowess fresh, at this\r\nday, amid the mountains of Savoy.\r\n\r\nIn Flanders, in 1692, under Sarsfield and Lord Clare, the “New” Brigade\r\nwon great honor at Steinkirk, where Luxemburg routed King William. At\r\nLanden, or Neerwinden, in July, 1693, William held his ground\r\ndesperately against the bravest efforts of the French. Luxemburg was in\r\ndespair, when the fierce war-cry, “Remember Limerick!” rent the clouds,\r\nand the Royal Irish Foot Guards, led by Colonel John Barrett, shattered\r\nthe English centre, broke into Neerwinden, opened a path to victory for\r\nthe French Household, and William was hurled into the river Gette, while\r\nthe Irish shout of victory shook the plain like a clap of thunder.\r\nSarsfield, like the brave Barrett, received his death wound, but his\r\ndying gaze beheld the sight he most loved to see—the English flag in\r\nsullen flight.\r\n\r\nThis same year, in Italy, under Catinat, the “Old” Brigade made its mark\r\nat Marsaglia, where it defeated the Savoyard centre, drew the whole\r\nFrench army after it, and chased Victor Amadeus almost to the gates of\r\nTurin.\r\n\r\nThenceforth, Lord Mountcashel having died of his wounds, the two\r\nbrigades were united as one. The younger Schomberg, son of the hero of\r\nthe Boyne, fell before the Irish bayonets at Marsaglia. At the battle of\r\nMontgry, in Spain, fought in 1694, by the French against the Spanish,\r\nthe “Brigade,” under Marshal de Noailles, renewed its laurels, and the\r\nIrish charge proved potent in bringing the Spaniards to terms.\r\n\r\nThis war terminated gloriously for France by the Peace of Ryswick.\r\n\r\nThe War of the Spanish Succession broke out in 1700. England and Austria\r\nsupported the Archduke Charles against Philip of Anjou, the Bourbon\r\nheir. This struggle brought upon the stage the Duke of Marlborough, for\r\nEngland, and Prince Eugene, of Savoy, for Austria, two of the greatest\r\ngenerals of modern times. Marshals, the Duke of Berwick, Catinat,\r\nVilleroy, Vendome, Villairs, Boufflers, and Noailles, commanded the\r\narmies of France. In this frightful struggle, the Irish flag always\r\nblazed in the vanguard of victory, in the rearguard of defeat, and the\r\nIrish name became the synonym of valor.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1702, the citadel of Cremona, in northern Italy, was\r\nheld for France by Marshal Villeroy, with a strong garrison. The French\r\ngave themselves up to revelry, and the walls were poorly guarded.\r\nCaissioli, an Italian, informed Prince Eugene, the Austrian commander,\r\nof the state of affairs. The traitor agreed to let in a portion of the\r\nenemy by means of a sewer running from outside the walls under his\r\nhouse. At the same time the French sentinels at the gate of St.\r\nMargaret, badly defended, were to be drawn off, so that Eugene himself,\r\nwith a strong body of cuirassiers, might enter and join the other party.\r\nCount Merci was to attack the “Gate of the Po,” defended by an Irish\r\ncompany, and Prince Vaudemont and Count Freiberg were to support the\r\nattack with the cavalry of their respective commands. The attack was\r\nmade at midnight, and the plans were admirably executed. The Austrians\r\nwere in possession of the town before the garrison was alarmed. Count\r\nMerci, however, met bad fortune at the “Gate of the Po.” The Irish\r\nguard, chatting over old times by the Shannon, the Barrow, or the Suir,\r\nkept faithful watch. The clatter of hoofs aroused them, as Merci,\r\nattended by several regiments of dragoons, rode up to the gate and\r\ncalled upon them to surrender. The Irish replied with a sharp volley,\r\nwhich laid some of the Austrians out in the roadway. The fire aroused\r\nthe sleeping Irish regiments of Dillon and Burke, who, in their shirts\r\nonly, as they sprang from bivouac, grasped their muskets and hastened to\r\nthe rescue. They were met in the square by Eugene’s cuirassiers, who\r\ncharged them fiercely. Major O’Mahoney formed his Irish into a square\r\nand let the Austrians have a fusillade. The cuirassiers, urged by Eugene\r\nand Freiberg, dashed madly at the Irish battalions, but, despite the\r\nbravest efforts of this iron cavalry, the Irish actually routed them and\r\nslew their leader, Baron Freiberg. Marshal Villeroy was made prisoner by\r\nMacdonald, an Irishman in the Austrian service, and the French general\r\nsecond in command shared the same fate. But the Irish still held out,\r\nfighting desperately and losing half their men. This prolonged\r\nresistance alarmed the French, who now, thoroughly aroused, gallantly\r\nseconded their Irish comrades, and, after a terrible carnage of eight\r\nhours’ duration, Prince Eugene, with all that remained of the flower of\r\nthe Austrian cavalry, gave up in despair, and was hurled pell-mell\r\nthrough the gates of St. Margaret, by the victorious garrison. This\r\nexploit of the Irish saved northern Italy to the French monarch—the\r\nAustrians retreated to the Alps. All Europe rang applause. Louis raised\r\nthe pay of his Irish troops, and made O’Mahoney a general. He also\r\ndecreed that Irishmen, who deserved the honor, should thenceforth be\r\nrecognized as French citizens, without undergoing the form of\r\nnaturalization.\r\n\r\nAt the first battle of Blenheim, Bavaria, in 1703, the Irish, under\r\nMarshal Tallard, contributed to that victory. The regiment of Clare,\r\nencountering the Austrian guards, was, for a moment, overpowered, but,\r\nimmediately rallying, it counter-charged with such fury that it not\r\nalone recovered its own flag, but gained two colors from the enemy!\r\n\r\nThe second Blenheim, so disastrous to France, was fought in 1704.\r\nMarlborough commanded the English right, facing Marshal Tallard, and\r\nEugene commanded the allied left, facing Marshal de Marcin, with whom\r\nwas the Irish Brigade. Tallard was dreadfully beaten, and Marcin fared\r\nlittle better. The French suffered great slaughter, and were badly\r\nworsted. The Brigade, however, would not lose heart. Closing up its\r\nranks, it made a superb charge on Prince Eugene’s lines, broke through\r\nthem—being one of the few corps in the French army that saved their\r\ncolors that day—and covered the retreat of France to the Rhine!\r\n\r\nThe English professor, E. S. Creasy of Cambridge University, writing of\r\nthe conduct of the Irish in this great battle, says, on page 318 of his\r\n“Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World”: “The [French] centre was\r\ncomposed of fourteen battalions of infantry, including the celebrated\r\nIrish Brigade. These were posted in the little hamlet of Oberglau, which\r\nlies somewhat nearer to Lutzingen than to Blenheim.” And, on page 320 of\r\nthe same work, the professor continues: “The Prince of Holstein Beck\r\nhad, with eleven Hanoverian battalions, passed the Nebel opposite to\r\nOberglau when he was charged and utterly routed by the Irish Brigade,\r\nwhich held that village. The Irish drove the Hanoverians back with heavy\r\nslaughter, broke completely through the line of the allies, and nearly\r\nachieved a success as brilliant as that which the same Brigade afterward\r\ngained at Fontenoy. But at Blenheim their ardor in pursuit led them too\r\nfar. Marlborough came up in person and dashed in on the exposed flank of\r\nthe Brigade with some squadrons of British cavalry. The Irish reeled\r\nback, and, as they strove to regain the heights of Oberglau, their\r\ncolumn was raked through and through by the fire of three battalions of\r\nthe allies, which Marlborough had summoned up from the reserve.”\r\nCompetent military critics have observed that had the French cavalry\r\nseconded the charge of the Irish infantry, Blenheim would have been a\r\nFrench victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n   The Irish Brigade in the Campaigns of North Italy and Flanders—Its\r\n   Strength at Various Periods—Count Dillon’s Reply to King Louis XV\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the summer of 1705, the Irish again, at the battle of Cassano, where\r\nthey fought under Marshal Vendome, paid their respects to Prince Eugene.\r\nThey fought with a bravery that electrified the French and paralyzed the\r\nAustrians. Vendome’s flank was badly annoyed by a hostile battery on the\r\nfarther bank of the river Adda. The stream was broad and deep, but two\r\nIrish regiments, under cover of the smoke, swam across it, and, under\r\nthe very nose of the great Eugene, captured the Austrian cannon and\r\nturned their fire upon the enemy! This intrepid action decided the day,\r\nand France was once more triumphant, by her Irish arm.\r\n\r\nConspicuous in this brilliant action, as also at Cremona, was the famous\r\n“Regiment of Burke”—the last to yield at Aughrim. Of it the\r\nScotch-Canadian poet and novelist, William McLennan, has written:\r\n\r\n   “Would you read your name on honor’s roll?\r\n     Look not for royal grant—\r\n    It is written in Cassano,\r\n     Alcoy and Alicant!\r\n    Saragossa, Barcelona,\r\n     Wherever dangers lurk,\r\n    You will find in the van the blue and the buff\r\n     Of the Regiment of Burke!\r\n    All Spain and France and Italy\r\n     Have echoed to our name—\r\n    The burning suns of Africa\r\n     Have set our arms aflame!\r\n    But to-night we toast the morn that broke and wakened us to fame—\r\n     The day we beat Prince Eugene in Cremona!”\r\n\r\nMarshal Villeroy, in May, 1706, allowed himself to be cooped up by the\r\nDuke of Marlborough in the village of Ramillies, in Flanders. The French\r\nwere utterly overwhelmed, and many thousands of prisoners were taken.\r\nLord Clare formed the Brigade into a column of attack and broke through\r\nthe victorious enemy. The regiment of Clare, in this charge, met the\r\nEnglish regiment of Churchill—now the Third Buffs—full tilt, crushed it\r\nhopelessly, captured its battle-flags, and served a Scotch regiment, in\r\nthe Dutch service, which endeavored to support the British, in the same\r\nmanner. The Brigade then effected its retreat on Ypres, where, in the\r\nconvent of the Benedictine nuns, it hung up the captured colors—“sole\r\ntrophies of Ramillies’ fray”—where they have waved, for many a\r\ngeneration, a fitting memento of the faith and fame of the Irish exiles.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1707, the Brigade next distinguished itself, at the battle of\r\nAlmanza, in Spain, where it fought in the army of Marshal the Duke of\r\nBerwick. The English and Austrians were commanded by Ruvigny—the\r\nWilliamite Earl of Galway—who signalized himself at Aughrim. The Brigade\r\npaid him back that day. It charged with a fury never excelled in any\r\nfight. The allies were overthrown, Ruvigny disgraced, and the crown of\r\nSpain was placed on the brow of Philip V.\r\n\r\nIn defeat, as in victory, the bayonets of the Brigade still opened up\r\nthe road to honor. When the French retreated from Oudenarde, in July,\r\n1708, Marlborough felt the Irish steel, as the gallant fellows hung\r\ndoggedly behind the retiring French, kept the fierce pursuers at bay,\r\nand enabled Vendome to reorganize his beaten army. The battle of\r\nMalplaquet, fought September, 1709, was the bloodiest of this most\r\nsanguinary war. The French fought with unusual desperation, and the\r\nEnglish ranks, led by Marlborough and seconded by Eugene, were\r\ndecimated. It was an unmitigated slaughter. At length Marshal Villairs,\r\nwho commanded the French, was wounded and Marshal Boufflers ordered a\r\nretreat. Again the Irish Brigade, which fought with its usual courage\r\nall through that dreadful day, had the honor of forming the French\r\nrearguard, and, although many flags, captured from France, were laid at\r\nthe feet of the victor, no Irish color graced the trophies of\r\nMarlborough, who, with the ill-judged battle of Malplaquet, virtually\r\nended his grand career as a soldier. After that fight the war was feebly\r\nwaged—France being completely exhausted—until the Peace of Utrecht and\r\nTreaty of Rastadt, 1713-14, closed the bloody record.\r\n\r\nIt would be almost impossible to enumerate the sieges and minor actions\r\nin which the Irish Brigade of France participated within the limits of\r\nthis history. The facts we have given, and are to give, rest on the\r\nauthority of the French war records, and the testimony of English and\r\nother writers, carefully compiled by Matthew O’Conor, in his “Military\r\nHistory of the Irish People,” and by John C. O’Callaghan in his\r\ninvaluable “History of the Irish Brigades”—works which should ensure for\r\ntheir able and careful authors a literary immortality, and which people\r\nof the Irish race should treasure among their most precious heirlooms.\r\nIt would be equally difficult to follow the career of those Irish\r\nsoldiers who, at the peace, transferred their swords from France to\r\nSpain, because Louis XV, who succeeded his grandfather while yet a\r\nchild, could not employ them all. In Spain, as in France, their swords\r\nwere sharpest where the English were their foes, always, it must be\r\nadmitted, worthy of their steel.\r\n\r\nThe subjoined statement of the strength of the Irish forces in the\r\nFrench service during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is taken\r\nfrom the authorities already quoted:\r\n\r\nFrom 1690 to 1692, three regiments of foot; 1692 to 1698, thirteen\r\nregiments of infantry, three independent companies, two companies of\r\ncavalry, and two troops of horse guards; 1698 to 1714, eight regiments\r\nof infantry and one regiment of horse; 1714 to 1744, five regiments of\r\ninfantry and one of cavalry; 1744 to 1762, six regiments of infantry and\r\none of horse; 1762 to 1775, five regiments of infantry; 1775 to 1791—the\r\nperiod of the dissolution of the Brigade—three regiments of foot.\r\n\r\nFrom the fall of Limerick, in 1691, to the French Revolution, according\r\nto the most reliable estimate, there fell in the field for France, or\r\notherwise died in her service, 480,000 Irish soldiers. The Brigade was\r\nkept recruited by military emigrants, borne from Ireland—chiefly from\r\nthe province of Munster—by French smugglers, under the romantic and\r\nsignificant title of “Wild Geese”—in poetical allusion to their eastward\r\nflight. By this name the Brigade is best remembered among the Irish\r\npeasantry.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Louis XIV, the Irish Brigade had comparatively little\r\nwholesale fighting to keep them occupied, until the War of the Austrian\r\nSuccession, thirty years later. They made many expeditions to the\r\nsmaller states on the Rhenish frontier, with which France was in a\r\nchronic state of war, under the Duke of Berwick. In every combat they\r\nserved with honor, and always appeared to best advantage where the hail\r\nof death fell thickest. At times, like most of their countrymen, they\r\nwere inclined to wildness, but the first drum-roll or bugle blast found\r\nthem ready for the fray. On the march to attack Fort Kehl, in 1733,\r\nMarshal Berwick—who was killed two years afterward at the siege of\r\nPhilipsburg—found fault with Dillon’s regiment for some breach of\r\ndiscipline while en route. He sent the colonel with despatches to Louis\r\nXV, and, among other matters, in a paternal way—for Berwick loved his\r\nIrishmen—called the king’s attention to the indiscreet battalion. The\r\nmonarch, on reading the document, turned to the Irish officer, and, in\r\nthe hearing of the whole court, petulantly exclaimed: “My Irish troops\r\ncause me more uneasiness than all the rest of my armies!” “Sire,”\r\nimmediately rejoined the noble Count Dillon—subsequently killed at\r\nFontenoy—“all your Majesty’s enemies make precisely the same complaint.”\r\nLouis, pleased with the repartee, smiled, and, like a true Frenchman,\r\nwiped out his previous unkindness by complimenting the courage of the\r\nBrigade.\r\n\r\nThe great War of the Austrian Succession inaugurated the fateful\r\ncampaigns of 1743 and 1745, respectively signalized by the battles of\r\nDettingen and Fontenoy. The former was a day of dark disaster to France,\r\nand Fontenoy was a mortal blow to British arrogance.\r\n\r\nAt Dettingen the Earl of Stair commanded the English and Hanoverians,\r\nalthough George II and his son, Cumberland, were present on the field.\r\nMarshal de Noailles commanded the French, and was badly worsted, after a\r\ndesperate engagement. The Irish Brigade, summoned from a long distance,\r\narrived too late to restore the battle, and met the French army in full\r\nretreat, hotly pursued by the allies. The Brigade, under the orders of\r\nLord Clare, opened their ranks and allowed the French to retire, and\r\nthen, closing steadily up, they uttered their charging cry, and, with\r\nleveled bayonet, checked the fierce pursuers. Thus, once again, the\r\nIrish Brigade formed the French rearguard, as the Fleur-de-Lis retired\r\nfrom the plains of Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n The Austrian Succession—Campaign of 1745—Magnificent Achievement of the\r\n       Irish Brigade at Fontenoy—Prince Louis’s Adieu to the Heroes\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE famous battle of Fontenoy was fought on the soil of Belgium, in the\r\nancient province of Hainault, within some thirty miles of the memorable\r\nplains of Waterloo, on May 11, new style, 1745. France, as we have\r\nalready noted, championed the cause of Charles of Bavaria, who laid\r\nclaim to the Austrian throne, while England, Holland, Hanover, and\r\nAustria took the side of Maria Theresa, who eventually, owing to the\r\nunexpected death of Charles, won the fiercely disputed crown.\r\n\r\nThe French were besieging Tournay with 18,000 men. A corps of 6,000\r\nguarded the bridges over the Scheldt, on the northern bank of which\r\nMarshal Saxe, accompanied by Louis XV and the Dauphin, having with him\r\n45,000 men, including the Irish Brigade, took post, to cover the siege\r\nof Tournay, and prevent the march of the allies, English, Dutch, and\r\nGermans, under the Duke of Cumberland and Prince Waldeck, to its relief.\r\nThe duke was a brave soldier, but fierce and cruel as a tiger. History\r\nknows him by the well-won title of “the butcher Cumberland.” His\r\nbusiness was to raise the siege of Tournay and open a road to Paris. He\r\nhad under his command 55,000 veteran troops, including the English\r\nHousehold regiments.\r\n\r\nThe French lines extended from the village of Rhamecroix, behind De\r\nBarri’s Wood, on the left, to the village of Fontenoy, in the centre,\r\nand from the latter position to the intrenchments of Antoine, on the\r\nright. This line of defence was admirably guarded by “fort and flanking\r\nbattery.” The Irish Brigade—composed that day of the infantry regiments\r\nof Clare, Dillon, Bulkeley, Roth, Berwick, and Lally—Fitz-James’s horse\r\nbeing with the French cavalry in advance—was stationed, in reserve, near\r\nthe wood, supported by the brigades of Normandie and De Vassieux.\r\n\r\nPrince Waldeck commanded the allied left, in front of Antoine. Brigadier\r\nIngoldsby commanded the British right, facing the French redoubt at De\r\nBarri’s Wood, while Cumberland, chief in command, was with the allied\r\ncentre, confronting Fontenoy.\r\n\r\nThe battle opened with a furious cannonade, at 5 o’clock in the morning.\r\nAfter some hours spent in this manner, Ingoldsby attempted to carry the\r\nredoubt, but was ignominiously repulsed, and could not be induced to\r\nrenew the attempt. This refusal subsequently led to his dismissal from\r\nthe army on a charge of cowardice. Prince Waldeck fared no better at\r\nAntoine, being defeated in two attempts to force the lines. The Duke of\r\nCumberland, grown impatient because of repeated failures, loaded the\r\nunfortunate commanding officers with imprecations. He took the resolve\r\nof beating the French at any cost by a concentrated attack on their left\r\ncentre, through a gap of about 700 yards, which occurred between the\r\nFontenoy redoubts and the work vainly attacked by Ingoldsby in the edge\r\nof the wood of Barri. For this purpose, he formed his reserves and least\r\nbattered active battalions, including the English guards, several\r\nBritish line regiments, and a large body of picked Hanoverian troops,\r\ninto three columns, aggregating 16,000 men, preceded and flanked by\r\ntwenty pieces of cannon, all drawn by hand, to avoid the confusion\r\nincident on the killing and wounding of the battery horses. But\r\nsubsequent developments compelled the Duke to change the original\r\nformation to one massive, solid oblong wedge, the British on the right\r\nand the Hanoverians on the left. Lord Charles Hay, the boldest soldier\r\nin the allied army, drew his sword and led the attacking column.\r\nMeanwhile, Cumberland renewed the attack all along the line, in order to\r\ncover the advance of his human battering-ram. Thus, the French were\r\npressed hard at every point, but their batteries and battalions replied\r\nwith spirit, and Antoine held out heroically in spite of all the efforts\r\nof Waldeck and his Dutch and Austrian troops against it. These latter\r\nwere badly cut up by the fire of a French battery planted beyond the\r\nScheldt. Up to this period, about the noon hour, everything had gone\r\nfavorably for the French.\r\n\r\nBut the decisive moment had now arrived, and the great Anglo-Hanoverian\r\ncolumn received the command—“Forward, march!” “In front of them, as it\r\nchanced,” says Mitchel, “were four battalions of the French guards, with\r\ntwo battalions of Swiss on their left and two other French regiments on\r\ntheir right. The French officers seem to have been greatly surprised\r\nwhen they saw the English battery taking up position on the summit of\r\nthe rising ground. ‘English cannon!’ they cried. ‘Let us go and take\r\nthem!’ They mounted the slope with their grenadiers, but were astonished\r\nto find an army on their front. A heavy discharge, both of artillery and\r\nmusketry, made them quickly recoil with heavy loss.” On, then, swept the\r\nEnglish column, with free and gallant stride, between Fontenoy and De\r\nBarri’s wood, whose batteries plowed them from flank to flank at every\r\nstep. But in the teeth of the artillery, the musketry and the bombshells\r\nwhich rose, circled and fell among them, killing and wounding scores at\r\neach explosion; charged by the cavalry of the royal household, and\r\nexposed to the iron hail of the French sharpshooters, that\r\nblue-and-scarlet wave of battle rolled proudly against the serried ranks\r\nof France. Falling by the hundred, they finally got beyond the\r\ncross-fire from the redoubts, crossed the slope and penetrated behind\r\nthe village of Fontenoy—marching straight on the headquarters of the\r\nking! The column was quickly in the middle of the picked soldiers of\r\nFrance, tossing them haughtily aside with the ready bayonet, while the\r\ncheers of anticipated victory resounded from their ranks far over the\r\nbloody field. Marshal Saxe, ill, and pale with rage and vexation,\r\nsprang, unarmored, upon his horse, and seemed to think the battle lost,\r\nfor he ordered the evacuation of Antoine, in order that the bridges\r\nacross the Scheldt might be covered and the king’s escape assured. At\r\nthis moment, Count Lally, of the Irish Brigade, rode up to Duke\r\nRichelieu, Saxe’s chief aide, and said to him: “We have still four\r\nfield-pieces in reserve—they should batter the head of that column. The\r\nIrish Brigade has not yet been engaged. Order it to fall on the English\r\nflank. Let the whole army second it—let us fall on the English like\r\nforagers!” Richelieu, who, afterward, allowed the suggestion to appear\r\nas if coming from himself, went at once to Saxe and gave him the\r\nsubstance of Lally’s proposal. The king and Dauphin, who were present,\r\napproved of it. The order to evacuate Antoine was countermanded, and\r\naides immediately galloped to the rear of the wood of Barri to order up\r\nthe Irish Brigade, commanded by Lord Clare, and its supporting\r\nregiments. These brave men, rendered excited and impatient by the noise\r\nof the battle, in which they had not yet been allowed to participate,\r\nreceived the command with loud demonstrations of joy. Their officers\r\nimmediately led them toward the point of danger.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the English column, marching and firing steadily—that\r\n“infernal, rolling fire,” so characteristic of the British mode of\r\nfighting—kept on its terrible course, and crushed every French\r\norganization that stood in its path. Had the Dutch and Austrians\r\nsucceeded in carrying Antoine at this moment, Cumberland must have been\r\nvictorious and the French army could not have escaped. Already the\r\ncolumn, still bleeding at every stride, was within sight of the royal\r\ntent. The English officers actually laid their canes along the barrels\r\nof the muskets to make the men fire low. Suddenly, the fire from the\r\nfour reserve French cannon opened on the head of the column, and the\r\nforemost files went down. The English guns replied stoutly and the march\r\nwas renewed. But now there came an ominous sound from the side of De\r\nBarri’s wood that made Lord Hay, brave and bold as he was, start, pause,\r\nand listen. It swelled above the crash of artillery and the continuous\r\nrattle of musketry. “Nearer, clearer, deadlier than before,” that fierce\r\nhurrah bursts upon the ear of battle! The English have heard that shout\r\nbefore and remember it to their cost. The crisis of the conflict has\r\ncome, and the command, by voice and bugle, “Halt! halt!” rang from front\r\nto rear of the bleeding column. The ranks were dressed hastily, and the\r\nEnglish prepared to meet the advancing enemy with a deadly volley from\r\ntheir front and long right flank. They looked anxiously in the direction\r\nof the wood and beheld long lines and bristling columns of men in blue\r\nand red—the uniform of the Irish Brigade—coming on at the charging step,\r\nwith colors flying and “the generals and colonels on horseback among the\r\nglittering bayonets.” They did not fire a single shot as they came on.\r\nBehind them were masses of men in blue and white. These were the French\r\nsupports. Again the British officers laid their canes across the barrels\r\nof the muskets, and, as the Brigade came within close range, a murderous\r\nvolley rolled out. Hundreds of the Irish fell, but the survivors,\r\nleaping over the dead, dying, and wounded, never paused for a moment.\r\nThey closed the wide gaps in their ranks and advanced at a run until\r\nthey came within bayonet thrust or butt-stroke of the front and right of\r\nthe English column, which they immediately crushed out of military\r\nshape; while their fierce war-shout, uttered in the Irish\r\ntongue—“Revenge! Remember Limerick and English treachery!” sounded the\r\ndeath-knell of Cumberland’s heroic soldiers. While the clubbed muskets\r\nof the Brigade beat down the English ranks, that furious war-cry rang\r\neven unto the walls of old Tournay. The French regiments of Normandie\r\nand Vassieux bravely seconded the Irish charge, and they and other\r\nGallic troops disposed of the Hanoverians. Within ten minutes from the\r\ntime when the Brigade came in contact with the English column, no\r\nBritish soldiers, except the dead, wounded, and captured, remained on\r\nthe slope of Fontenoy. Bulkeley’s Irish regiment nearly annihilated the\r\nColdstream Guards and captured their colors.\r\n\r\nThis victory saved France from invasion, but it cost the Irish dear.\r\nCount Dillon was slain, Lord Clare disabled, while one-third of the\r\nofficers and one-fourth of the men were killed or wounded. King Louis,\r\nnext morning, publicly thanked the Irish, made Lally a general, and Lord\r\nClare was, soon afterward, created a marshal of France. England met\r\nretribution for her cruelty and faithlessness to Ireland, and King\r\nGeorge vehemently cursed the laws which drove the Irish exiles to win\r\nglory and vengeance on that bloody day.\r\n\r\nThe losses in the battle were nearly equal—the French, Swiss, and Irish\r\nlosing altogether 7,139 men killed, wounded, and missing; while the\r\nEnglish, Hanoverians, Dutch, and Austrians acknowledged a total loss of\r\n7,767 men, said by O’Callaghan to be an underestimate. Fontenoy was one\r\nof the greatest of French victories, and led, in the same campaign, to\r\nnumerous other successes. Among the latter may be enumerated the triumph\r\nat Melle, the surprise of Ghent, the occupation of Bruges, and the\r\ncapture of Oudenarde, Dendermonde, Ostend, Nieuport, and Ath.\r\n\r\nSeveral officers of the Irish Brigade went with Prince Charles Edward\r\nStuart to Scotland, when he made his gallant but ill-fated attempt to\r\nrestore the fallen fortunes of his luckless father, called by the\r\nJacobites James VIII of Scotland and James III of England and Ireland,\r\nin 1745-46. The Hanoverian interest called James the “Old” and Charles\r\nEdward the “Young” Pretender. The Irish officers formed “Prince\r\nCharles’s” chosen bodyguard when he was a fugitive amid the Highlands\r\nand Western Isles after Culloden. One of the last great field exploits\r\nof the Irish Brigade was its victorious charge at Laffeldt, in Flanders,\r\nin 1747, when, for the second time, it humiliated Cumberland, and, in a\r\nmeasure, avenged his base massacre of the gallant Scottish Highland\r\nclans, in 1746. The victory of Laffeldt led to the Peace of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, which was favorable to France, in 1748. The Brigade\r\ntook part in each succeeding war in which France was involved down to\r\nthe period of the Revolution. Some of its regiments served also in India\r\nand America. Under Count Dillon, several Irish battalions distinguished\r\nthemselves in the dashing, but unsuccessful, attack on the British at\r\nSavannah, Ga., in 1779, when the brave Count Pulaski, who led the\r\nassault, was killed on the ramparts. By that time, however, the volume\r\nof recruits from Ireland had greatly diminished, owing to the gradual\r\nrelaxation of the penal code, and a majority of the officers and\r\nsoldiers of the Brigade were, although of Irish blood, French by birth.\r\nSome of the officers were French by both birth and blood, and, among\r\nthem, in 1791, was the great-grandson of St. Ruth. The Brigade, as\r\nbecame it, remained faithful to the last to the Bourbon dynasty.\r\nUnfortunately this fidelity led the feeble remnant, under Colonel\r\nO’Connell, to take service in the West Indies, beneath the British flag,\r\nafter the Revolution. In extenuation of their fault, it must be\r\nremembered that they were, to a man, monarchists; that the Stuart cause\r\nwas hopelessly lost, and that both tradition and education made them the\r\ninevitable enemies of the new order of things in France. Still, an Irish\r\nhistorian may be pardoned for remarking that it were much better for the\r\nfame of the Brigade of Cremona and Fontenoy if its senile heir-at-law\r\nhad refrained from accepting the pay of the country whose tyranny had\r\ndriven the original organization into hopeless exile.\r\n\r\nBut the active career of the bold Brigade terminated in a blaze of\r\nglory. The hand of a prince, destined to be a monarch, inscribed its\r\nproud epitaph when, in 1792, the Comte de Provence, afterward Louis\r\nXVIII, presented to the surviving officers a drapeau d’adieu, or flag of\r\nfarewell—a gold harp wreathed with shamrocks and fleur-de-lis, on a\r\nwhite ground, with the following touching words:\r\n\r\n    “Gentlemen: We acknowledge the inappreciable services that\r\n    France has received from the Irish Brigade in the course of the\r\n    last hundred years—services that we shall never forget, though\r\n    under an impossibility of requiting them. Receive this standard\r\n    as a pledge of our remembrance, a monument of our admiration and\r\n    our respect, and, in future, generous Irishmen, this shall be\r\n    the motto of your stainless flag—\r\n\r\n                             “‘1692-1792.’\r\n                       “Semper et Ubique Fidelis!\r\n                  (“Ever, and everywhere, faithful.”)\r\n\r\nNever did military body receive a nobler discharge from service.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, well might the haughty Bourbon prince so express himself. In\r\ndefence of his house, there died beneath the golden lilies, in camp and\r\nbreach and field, nearly 500,000 of Ireland’s daring manhood. It is no\r\nwonder that with those heroes departed much of her warlike spirit and\r\nspringing courage. Her “wild geese,” as she fondly called them, will\r\nnever fly again to her bosom across the waves that aided their flight to\r\nexile and to glory. The cannon of all Europe pealed above their gory\r\ngraves, on many a stricken field, the soldier’s requiem.\r\n\r\n         “They fought as they reveled, fast, fiery, and true,\r\n          And, tho’ victors, they left on the field not a few;\r\n          And they who survived fought and drank as of yore,\r\n          But the land of their hearts’ hope they saw nevermore:\r\n          For, in far foreign fields, from Dunkirk to Belgrade,\r\n          Lie the soldiers and chiefs of the Irish Brigade!”\r\n\r\nIts successor in the French army was the Irish Legion, composed in the\r\nmain of refugees who had participated in the “rebellion” of 1798 and the\r\n“rising” of 1803. This fine body of soldiers was organized by Napoleon\r\nhimself, wore a distinctively Irish uniform of green and gold, and\r\ncarried French and Irish colors. To it, also, was intrusted an eagle—the\r\nonly foreign force that was so honored by the greatest of generals. The\r\nLegion fought for the Emperor, with splendid fidelity, from 1805 to\r\n1815, participating in most of the great battles of that warlike period.\r\n\r\nIt was naturally expected that Louis XVIII, on his final restoration to\r\nthe throne, would revive the old Irish Brigade, so highly praised by\r\nhim, when Comte de Provence, in 1792, but he was under too many\r\nobligations to England, and, in fact, his treaty with that power, after\r\nthe second exile of Napoleon, made it obligatory on him not to accept an\r\nIrish military contingent under any consideration. His acquiescence in\r\nthis ignoble compact makes more emphatic the venerable adage, “Put not\r\nyour trust in Princes.”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK VII\r\n\r\n\r\nNARRATING THE MANY PENAL STATUTES AGAINST THE CATHOLICS, AND CARRYING\r\nTHE STORY DOWN TO THE ACQUIREMENT OF A FREE COMMERCE BY THE IRISH\r\nPARLIAMENT, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF GRATTAN, A.D. 1780\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n       Anti-Catholic Penal Laws—Their Drastic, Brutal and Absurd\r\n       Provisions—Professional Informers, Called “Priest-Hunters”\r\n\r\n\r\nWE now approach a period of Irish history from which we would gladly\r\nescape, if we could; a period degrading to Ireland, disgraceful to\r\nEngland, and shocking to humanity. We are about to deal with the dark\r\nand bloody period of the revived penal code, in Ireland, following fast\r\nupon the capitulation of Limerick. Many writers have extolled the\r\nfair-mindedness and liberality of William III, but his course toward\r\nIreland does not sustain the justice of their eulogies. That he was an\r\nindifferentist in matters of religion is not doubted, yet he permitted\r\npersecution for conscience’ sake in his Irish dominion. That he was an\r\nable man has not been disputed, yet he permitted English jealousy to\r\ndestroy the trade and industries of His own supporters in Ireland,\r\nthereby driving thousands on thousands of the Irish dissenters to the\r\nAmerican colonies, which their descendants, in 1775-83, did so much to\r\nmake “free and independent.” We can find nothing to admire in the Irish\r\npolicy of William III. Had he been an honest bigot, a fanatic on the\r\nsubject of religion, we could understand his toleration of the\r\nlegislative abominations which made the Irish Catholic a helot on his\r\nnative soil. Had he been an imbecile we could understand how English\r\nplausibility might have imposed upon him in the matter of Irish\r\nProtestant commerce. However, not much of moral stamina could be\r\nexpected from a man who estranged his wife and his sister-in-law, Anne,\r\nfrom their own father; or from a nephew, and son-in-law, that did not\r\nscruple to play the cuckoo and eject his own uncle and father-in-law\r\nfrom the royal nest of England. Add to this his heartless policy toward\r\nthe Macdonalds of Glencoe, in Scotland, the order for whose massacre he\r\ncountersigned himself, and we find ourselves utterly unable to give\r\nWilliam of Orange credit for sincerity, liberality, or common humanity.\r\nHe was personally courageous, a fair general, and a cautious statesman.\r\nThese about summed up his good qualities. But he interposed no objection\r\nwhen, notwithstanding the solemn civil articles of Limerick, he\r\npermitted the estates of the adherents of King James, to whom his Lords\r\nJustices, by royal sanction, guaranteed immunity, to be confiscated.\r\n\r\nMitchel, a Protestant in belief, says in his “History of Ireland,” page\r\n3: “The first distinct breach of the Articles of Limerick was\r\nperpetrated by King William and his Parliament in England, just two\r\nmonths after those articles were signed. King William was in the\r\nNetherlands when he heard of the surrender of Limerick, and, at once,\r\nhastened to London. Three days later he summoned a Parliament. Very\r\nearly in the session, the English House of Commons, exercising its\r\ncustomary power of binding Ireland by acts passed in London, sent up to\r\nthe House of Lords a bill providing that no person should sit in the\r\nIrish Parliament, nor should hold any Irish office, civil, military, or\r\necclesiastical, nor should practice law or medicine in Ireland, till he\r\nhad first taken the oaths of allegiance _and supremacy_, and subscribed\r\nto the declaration against transubstantiation. The law was passed, only\r\nreserving the right [of practice] to such lawyers and physicians as had\r\nbeen within the walls of Galway and Limerick when those towns\r\ncapitulated.” Thenceforward there were repeated violations of the\r\ntreaty, during the reign of William and Mary, although the penal laws\r\ndid not reach the acme of their crushing severity until the reigns of\r\ntheir immediate successors, Queen Anne, George I, and George II. Lord\r\nMacaulay himself, who does not admit that William III was ever wrong,\r\nacknowledges, in his “History of England,” that “the Irish Roman\r\nCatholics complained, and with but too much reason, that, at a later\r\nperiod, the Treaty of Limerick was violated.” The main opposition to the\r\nconfirmation of the treaty came, as might be expected, from the party of\r\nProtestant ascendency in Ireland, which had in view “the glory of God,”\r\nand wholesale confiscation of Catholic property. Their horror of what\r\nthey called “Popery” was strongly influenced by a pious greed for cheap\r\nreal estate. There were, of course, many noble exceptions to this\r\nmercenary rule among the Protestants of Ireland, even in the blackest\r\nperiod of “the penal days.” If there had not been, the Catholics must\r\nhave been exterminated. It is only fair to say that the majority of the\r\npoorer Protestant Irish—particularly the Dissenters—had little or no\r\npart in framing the penal code, and that many members of the Irish House\r\nof Lords, including Protestant bishops, indignantly protested against\r\nthe formal violation of the Articles of Limerick, contained in the act\r\nof the “Irish” Parliament, passed in 1695.\r\n\r\nLord Sydney, William’s Lord Lieutenant in Ireland, summoned the first\r\nIrish Parliament of his master’s reign, in 1692, and this was the only\r\nParliament, except that called together by King James in 1689, which had\r\nmet in Ireland in six-and-twenty years. No act of Catholic\r\ndisqualification for Parliament existed in Ireland at that time, and,\r\ntherefore, a few Catholic lords and commoners presented themselves, on\r\nsummons, and took their seats. They had forgotten that the “paternal”\r\nEnglish Parliament had, in 1691, provided for such an emergency, and\r\nwere taken aback when the clerks of Parliament presented to them “the\r\noath of supremacy, declaring the King of England to be head of the\r\nChurch, and affirming the sacrifice of the Mass to be damnable.” Mitchel\r\nsays, further, of what followed: “The oath was put to each member of\r\nboth Houses, and the few Catholics present at once retired, so that the\r\nParliament, when it proceeded to business, was purely Protestant. Here,\r\nthen, ended the last vestige of constitutional right for the Catholics;\r\nfrom this date, and for generations to come, they could no longer\r\nconsider themselves a part of the existing body politic of their native\r\nland, and the division [of the Irish] into two nations became definite.\r\nThere was the dominant nation, consisting of the British colony, and the\r\nsubject nation, consisting of five-sixths of the population, who had,\r\ntherefore, no more influence upon public affairs than have the red\r\nIndians of the United States.” In order to more fully reduce the\r\nCatholics of Ireland to the condition described, an act was passed by\r\nthe Irish Parliament in 1697 which provided that “a Protestant marrying\r\na Catholic was disabled from sitting or voting in either House of\r\nParliament.” We may add that, following up this policy, the same\r\nParliament, thirty years later, fearing that the Catholics were not even\r\nyet sufficiently effaced from political life, passed another bill by\r\nwhich it was enacted that “no Catholic shall be entitled, or admitted,\r\nto vote at the election of any member to serve in Parliament, as a\r\nknight, citizen, or burgess; or at the election of any magistrate for\r\nany city or other town corporate; any law, statute, or usage to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding.”\r\n\r\nMitchel, commenting on the severity of the penal laws, presents a\r\ncuriously contradictory situation in the Ireland of King William’s time\r\nwhen he says: “But though the inhabitants of Ireland were now, counting\r\nfrom 1692, definitively divided into two castes, there arose\r\nimmediately, strange to say, a strong sentiment of Irish\r\nnationality—not, indeed, among the depressed Catholics; they were done\r\nwith national sentiment and aspiration for a time—but the Protestants of\r\nIreland had lately grown numerous, wealthy, and strong. Their numbers\r\nhad been largely increased by English settlers coming to enjoy the\r\nplunder of the forfeited estates, and very much by conversions, or\r\npretended conversions, of Catholics, who had recanted their faith to\r\nsave their property or their position in society, and who generally\r\naltered or disguised their family names when these had too Celtic a\r\nsound. The Irish Protestants also prided themselves on having saved the\r\nkingdom for William and the ‘Ascendancy,’ and having now totally put\r\ndown the ancient nation under their feet, they aspired to take its\r\nplace, to rise from a colony to a nation, and to assert the dignity of\r\nan independent kingdom.”\r\n\r\nEven the Irish Protestant Parliament of 1692 quarreled with Lord\r\nLieutenant Sydney over a revenue bill, which originated in London, and\r\nwhich it rejected, although it passed another bill, having a like\r\norigin, on the ground of emergency. During the debate on these measures,\r\nseveral members denied the right of England to tax Ireland without her\r\nconsent, and insisted that all revenue bills, which called for Irish\r\ntaxation, should originate in Ireland, not in England. This bold spirit\r\nangered Lord Sydney, who immediately prorogued that Parliament, not,\r\nhowever, before he made an overbearing speech, in which he rebuked the\r\naction of the members and haughtily asserted the supremacy of the\r\nBritish Parliament over that of Ireland. His remarks left a sting in\r\nProtestant Ireland and served to strengthen, rather than weaken, the\r\nnational sentiment alluded to by Mitchel.\r\n\r\nIn 1693, King James the Vacillating, then a pensioner of the King of\r\nFrance, at St. Germain, issued a declaration to his former subjects of\r\nEngland in which he made humiliating promises, at variance with his\r\nprevious record, and in which, among other things, he promised if\r\nrestored to the throne to keep inviolate the Act of Settlement, which\r\ndeprived his Catholic supporters in Ireland of their estates! This\r\nperfidious document aroused great indignation among the Irish military\r\nexiles, and James, through his English advisers in France, attempted to\r\nsmooth matters over by promising that, in the event of his success, he\r\nwould recompense all who might suffer by his act, by giving them\r\nequivalents. Lord Middleton, a Scotch peer, is held chiefly responsible\r\nfor having led King James into this disgraceful transaction—the most\r\nblameful of his unfortunate career. “There was no such promise [of\r\nrecompense] in the declaration” (to the English), says the historian\r\nrecently quoted, “but, in truth, the Irish troops in the army of King\r\nLouis were, at that time, too busy in camp and field, and too keenly\r\ndesirous to meet the English in battle, to pay much attention to\r\nanything coming from King James. They had had enough of ‘Righ Seamus’ at\r\nthe Boyne Water.”\r\n\r\nLord Sydney, although inimical to the claim of Irish Parliamentary\r\nindependence, was rather friendly to the persecuted Irish Catholics, and\r\nwas, therefore, at the request of the “Ascendancy” faction, speedily\r\nrecalled, not, however, before, after two proroguements, he had\r\ndissolved the Parliament convened in 1692. Three Lords Justices—Lord\r\nCapel, Sir Cyril Wyche, and Mr. Duncombe—were given the government of\r\nIreland in his stead, but, owing to serious dissensions among\r\nthemselves, Capel was finally appointed Lord Lieutenant, and, in 1695,\r\nsummoned a new Parliament to meet in Dublin. This assembly was destined\r\nto be infamous. Its first act was to bring up the articles of the Treaty\r\nof Limerick for “confirmation,” and it “confirmed” them by vetoing all\r\nthe important and agreeing to all the trivial provisions. The\r\nenumeration of all the penal laws passed by this Parliament would be\r\ntedious in the extreme, and a bare outline will suffice to show their\r\ndemoralizing tendency. It was enacted that Catholic schoolmasters were\r\nforbidden to teach, either publicly or privately, under severe penalty;\r\nand the parents of Catholic children were prohibited from sending them\r\nto be educated abroad. All Catholics were required to surrender their\r\narms, and, in order to enforce the act more thoroughly, “right of\r\nsearch” was given to magistrates, so that Catholic householders could be\r\ndisturbed at any hour of the day or night, their bedrooms invaded, and\r\nthe women of their family subjected to exposure and insult.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the clause in the Treaty of Limerick which was supposed\r\nto secure the Catholic landholders in certain counties in the possession\r\nof their property, Parliament made a clean sweep by confiscating the\r\nproperty of all, to the extent of over a million acres, so that now, at\r\nlong run, after three series of confiscations, there remained in\r\nCatholic hands _less than one-seventh_ of the entire surface of the\r\nisland. The Protestant one-sixth owned all the rest.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed not to seriously disturb the parish priests, who were\r\nincumbents at the time of the treaty, but no curates were allowed them,\r\nand they were compelled to register their names, like ticket-of-leave\r\nmen, in a book furnished by government. They had, also, to give security\r\nfor their “good conduct,” and there were other insulting exactions—the\r\nemanation of bitter hearts and narrow brains. All Catholic prelates, the\r\nJesuits, monks, and “regular clergy,” of whatever order, were\r\nperemptorily ordered to quit Ireland by May 1, 1698. If any returned\r\nafter that date, they were to be arrested for high treason, “tried,”\r\nand, of course, condemned and executed. The object was to leave the\r\nCatholic people without spiritual guides, except Protestants, after the\r\n“tolerated” parish priests had passed away; but, in spite of the penal\r\nenactment, a large number of devoted proscribed bishops and priests\r\nremained in Ireland, and the prelates administered holy orders to young\r\nclerical students, who, like themselves, had defied penalties and risked\r\ntheir lives for the service of God and the consolation of their\r\nsuffering people.\r\n\r\nIn order to still further humiliate the unfortunate Irish Catholics,\r\nthis Parliament of bigots decreed that no Catholic chapel should be\r\nfurnished with either bell or belfry. Such smallness would seem\r\nincredible in our age, but the enactments stand out, in all their\r\nhideousness, in the old statutes of the Irish Parliament, still\r\npreserved in the government archives in Dublin and London. It was this\r\nParliament that decreed, further, that no Catholic could possess a horse\r\nof or over the value of £5 sterling. On offering that sum, or anything\r\nover it, any Protestant could become owner of the animal.\r\n\r\nThe Irish peers who protested against this tyranny were Lords\r\nLondonderry, Tyrone, and Duncannon, the Barons Ossory, Limerick,\r\nKillaloe, Kerry, Howth, Kingston, and Strabane, and the Protestant\r\nbishops of Kildare, Elphin, Derry, Clonfert, and Killala—to whom be\r\neternal honor.\r\n\r\nBut the penal laws were not yet completed. They had just about begun. In\r\n1704, when the Duke of Ormond, grandson of the Ormond of Cromwellian\r\ndays, became viceroy for Queen Anne, another Irish Ascendancy Parliament\r\nenacted, among other things, that the eldest son of a Catholic, by\r\nbecoming Protestant, could become the owner of his father’s land, if he\r\npossessed any, and the father become only a life tenant. If any child,\r\nof any age above infancy, declared itself a Protestant, it was ordered\r\nplaced under Protestant guardianship, and the father was compelled to\r\npay for its education and support. If the wife of a Catholic turned\r\nProtestant, she could claim a third of his property and separate\r\nmaintenance. Catholics were prohibited from being guardians of their own\r\nchildren, to the end that, when they died, the helpless ones might be\r\nbrought up as Protestants.\r\n\r\nCatholics were debarred from buying land, or taking a freehold lease for\r\nlife, or a for a longer period than thirty-one years. No Catholic heir\r\nto a former owner was allowed to accept property that came to him by\r\nright of lineal descent, or by process of bequest. If any Protestant\r\ncould prove that the profit on the farm of a Catholic exceeded one-third\r\nof the rent paid by the latter, the informer could take immediate\r\npossession of the land.\r\n\r\nWe have already alluded to the measures taken to exclude Catholics from\r\ncivil and military service, by operation of the odious test oaths, which\r\nwere also used to prevent them from entering Parliament, and from even\r\nvoting for members of Parliament, although the latter had to be\r\nProtestants in order to be eligible. The Irish Dissenters—Presbyterians\r\nand others—were also subjected to the test-oath indignity, which,\r\ntogether with the tyrannical restrictions on trade, imposed by the\r\nEnglish and servile Irish Parliament, drove many thousands of them to\r\nAmerica. The Irish Presbyterians, in particular, resented the “test” and\r\n“schism” acts, and refused to apply to Episcopal bishops for license to\r\nteach in schools; or to receive the sacrament after the fashion of the\r\nChurch of England. Rewards were held out for all who would reveal to the\r\ngovernment the names of Catholics, or others, who might violate the\r\nprovisions of the barbaric laws summarized in this chapter. The scale of\r\nthe rewards, as given by McGee and other authors, is a curious study.\r\nThus, “for discovering an archbishop, bishop, vicar-general, or other\r\nperson exercising any foreign ecclesiastical jurisdiction, £50; for\r\ndiscovering each ‘regular’ clergyman and each ‘secular’ clergyman, not\r\nregistered, £20, and for discovering each ‘Popish’ schoolmaster, or\r\nusher, £10.” If any person refused to give evidence of the residence of\r\nany proscribed person, he was fined £20, or else had to go to prison for\r\na year. Many noble-hearted Protestants who, in spite of penal laws,\r\nloved their Catholic fellow-countrymen, suffered pains and penalties,\r\nunder these enactments, and became objects of hatred to the more\r\nmalignant section of their co-religionists, who were after the Catholic\r\nspoils. Thus, public distrust became epidemic, and the infamous “reward”\r\npolicy begot, as a natural result, a host of professional informers,\r\nwhose shocking avocation was mainly exercised in the spying out of the\r\nplaces of concealment of proscribed prelates and priests, and who are\r\nstill remembered in Ireland as “priest-hunters.” These malignants also\r\ndirected their efforts vigorously against the teachers of\r\n“hedge-schools”—that is to say, schools held in the open air, generally\r\nunder the shelter of a tall hedge, or on the edge of a wood, and\r\npresided over by some wandering schoolmaster, who bravely risked\r\nliberty, and often life, in teaching the Catholic youth of Ireland the\r\nrudiments of education.\r\n\r\nThere existed a mean “toleration” of Catholic worship, in parishes whose\r\npriests were “registered,” according to the provisions of the penal\r\ncode, but, in parishes where the priests were not registered, and they\r\nwere numerous, priests and people, who wished to celebrate and assist at\r\nthe consoling sacrifice of the Mass, had to retire to ocean cave, or\r\nmountain summit, or rocky gorge, in order to guard against surprise and\r\nmassacre. The English government of the day did not scruple to lend its\r\nsoldiers to the priest-hunters, to enable the latter to more effectively\r\naccomplish their odious mission; just as in our day it has lent the\r\nmilitary to the sheriffs to carry out those cruel evictions which the\r\nlate Mr. Gladstone called “sentences of death.” It was the custom to\r\nplace sentinels around the places where Mass was being celebrated, but,\r\ndespite of this precaution, the human sleuthhounds occasionally crept\r\nunobserved upon their unarmed victims—for then, as now, the Irish were\r\nsystematically disarmed—and often slew priest and people at the rude\r\naltar stones, called still by the peasantry “Mass rocks.”\r\n\r\nSo great was the enforced exodus of priests from Ireland, at this awful\r\nperiod of its history, that, says McGee, “in Rome 72,000 francs annually\r\nwere allotted for the maintenance of the fugitive Irish clergy, and,\r\nduring the first three months of 1699, three remittances from the Holy\r\nFather, amounting to 90,000 livres, were placed in the hands of the\r\nNuncio at Paris for the temporary relief of the fugitives in France and\r\nFlanders. It may also be added here that, till the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, an annual charge of 1,000 crowns was borne by the Papal\r\ntreasury for the encouragement of Catholic poor schools in Ireland.”\r\n\r\nOf the penal code which produced this dreadful condition of affairs, in\r\nand out of Ireland, Dr. Samuel Johnson, the great English scholar and\r\nphilosopher, said, “They are more grievous than all the Ten Pagan\r\npersecutions of the Christians.”\r\n\r\nEdmund Burke, the illustrious Irish statesman, who passed most of his\r\ncareer in the British Parliament, and was, of course, a Protestant, or\r\nhe could not have sat there, denounced them, substantially, as the most\r\ndiabolical engine of oppression and demoralization ever used against a\r\npeople or ever devised by “the perverted ingenuity of man.”\r\n\r\nAnd the Protestant and English historian, Godkin, who compiled Cassell’s\r\n“History of Ireland,” for English readers, says of the penal laws: “The\r\neighteenth century was the era of persecution in which the law did the\r\nwork of the sword, more effectually and more safely. There was\r\nestablished a code framed with almost diabolical ingenuity, to\r\nextinguish natural affection, to foster perfidy and hypocrisy, to\r\npetrify conscience, to perpetuate brutal ignorance, to facilitate the\r\nwork of tyranny, by rendering the vices of slavery inherent and natural\r\nin the Irish character, and to make Protestantism almost irredeemably\r\nodious as the monstrous incarnation of all moral perversions.” This\r\nhonest Englishman grows indignant when he says, in continuation, “Too\r\nwell did it accomplish its deadly work on the intellects, morals, and\r\nphysical condition of a people, sinking in degeneracy from age to age,\r\ntill all manly spirit, all virtuous sense of personal independence and\r\nresponsibility, was nearly extinct, and the very features, vacant,\r\ntimid, cunning, and unreflective, betrayed the crouching slave\r\nwithin.... Having no rights or franchises, no legal protection of life\r\nand property, disqualified to handle a gun, even as a common soldier or\r\na gamekeeper, forbidden to acquire the elements of knowledge at home or\r\nabroad, forbidden even to render to God what conscience dictated as His\r\ndue, what could the Irish be but abject serfs? What nation in their\r\ncircumstances could have been otherwise? Is it not amazing that any\r\nsocial virtue could have survived such an ordeal?—that any seeds of\r\ngood, any roots of national greatness, could have outlived such a long\r\nand tempestuous winter?”\r\n\r\nBut the seeds of good, although chilled, did not decay, and the manly\r\nspirit of the Old Irish race—the Celto-Norman stock, with the former\r\nelement in preponderance—survived all its persecutions, and\r\n\r\n                    “—Exiled in those penal days,\r\n                     Its banners over Europe blaze!”\r\n\r\nThe great American orator and philanthropist, Wendell Phillips,\r\nlecturing on Ireland, and alluding to the enforced ignorance of a former\r\nperiod, said: “When the old-time ignorance of the Catholic Irish people\r\nis reproachfully alluded to by the thoughtless, or illiberal, it is not\r\nIreland but England that should bow her head in the dust and put on\r\nsackcloth and ashes!”\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n        Restrictions on Irish Trade and Manufactures—All Creeds\r\n          Suffer—Presbyterian Exodus to America—Death of Royal\r\n                    Personages—Accession of George I\r\n\r\n\r\nSINCE the days of Charles II, and probably before his reign, a\r\ncontemptible jealousy of the growth of Irish commerce had taken\r\npossession of the commercial element in England. We have already said\r\nsomething about the crushing of the Irish cattle trade, while yet the\r\n“Merry Monarch” was on the throne; but a far deadlier blow was struck at\r\nIrish prosperity when, in 1698, the English manufacturers had the\r\nassurance to petition Parliament against the Irish woolen industry—then\r\namong the most prosperous in Europe. This petition was strongly indorsed\r\nby the English House of Lords, in an address to King William, wherein\r\nthey, unconsciously, perhaps, paid a high tribute to Irish manufacturing\r\ngenius. They virtually admitted that the superiority of Irish woolen\r\nfabrics made the English traders apprehensive that the farther growth of\r\nthe Irish woolen industry “might greatly prejudice the said manufacture\r\nin his Majesty’s Kingdom of England.” Not content with this display of\r\nmean selfishness, the English fisheries’ interest protested against\r\nIrish fishermen catching herrings on the eastern coast of their own\r\nisland, “thereby coming into competition with them [the English].” The\r\nColonial Parliament of Ireland basely yielded to English coercion, and,\r\nin 1699, actually stabbed the industries of their own country in the\r\nback, by placing ruinous export duties on fine Irish woolens, friezes,\r\nand flannels! And this hostile legislation was aimed, not against the\r\nCatholic Irish, who had no industries, but against the Protestant Irish,\r\nwho possessed all of them!\r\n\r\nThe English Parliament, thus secured against effective opposition,\r\nimmediately passed an act whereby the Irish people were forbidden to\r\nexport either the raw material for making woolen goods, or the goods\r\nthemselves, to any foreign port, except a few English ports, and only\r\nsix of the numerous Irish seaports were allowed even this poor\r\nprivilege. The natural result followed. Irish prices went up in England,\r\nand, in spite of the acknowledged excellence of Irish manufactures, the\r\nEnglish people would not purchase them at an advanced cost. The Irish\r\ntraders could not afford to sell them at a moderate price, and, within a\r\nfew years, most of the latter were absolutely ruined. Dr. P. W. Joyce,\r\nin his “History of Ireland,” estimates that “40,000 Irish\r\nProtestants—all prosperous working people—were immediately reduced to\r\nidleness and poverty—the Catholics, of course, sharing in the misery, so\r\nfar as they were employed, and 20,000 Presbyterians and other\r\nNonconformists left Ireland for New England. Then began the emigration,\r\nfrom want of employment, that continues to this day. But the English\r\nParliament professed to encourage the Irish linen trade, for this could\r\ndo no harm to English traders, as flax growing and linen manufacture had\r\nnot taken much hold in England.”\r\n\r\nThis, according to Dr. Joyce, was the beginning of that smuggling trade\r\nwith France which Ireland carried on for more than a century, and a\r\nclose acquaintance, therefore, sprang up between the French and Irish\r\ntraders and sailors. Ireland could sell her surplus wool to great\r\nadvantage in France, and received from that country many luxuries,\r\nwhich, otherwise, she could not have enjoyed. French wines became common\r\nat Irish tables, above those of the working-class, and French silks\r\ndecorated the fair persons of Irish maids and matrons. Moreover, this\r\nadventurous trade developed a hardy race of Irish sailors, and, by means\r\nof the Irish smugglers and their French copartners, the Irish priests\r\nfound a convenient avenue of transit to and from the Continent; and\r\nbrave young Irish spirits, registered as “Wild Geese,” found their way\r\nto the ranks of “the bold Brigade,” whose fame was then a household word\r\nin Europe. But the Irish masses, both Catholic and Nonconformist, were\r\nreduced to abject poverty, and each succeeding year brought fresh\r\ncommercial restrictions, until, finally, almost every Irish industry,\r\nexcept the linen, was totally extirpated in the island. The smuggling\r\ntrade, alone, kept some vitality in the commercial veins of the ruined\r\ncountry, and, in defiance of English and Anglo-Irish enactments against\r\nit, it continued to flourish down to the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nWell-meaning foreign writers, who did not make a study of Anglo-Irish\r\nrelations in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, have\r\nexpressed astonishment at the paucity of Irish industries, outside of\r\nlinen, and have ascribed it to Irish non-adaptability to manufacturing\r\npursuits! Not alone did England compel Ireland to fine her own traders,\r\nby levying export duties on their output, but she also, as we have seen,\r\nby her own Parliament, limited such exports to the meanest possible\r\nproportions! Of course, at this slavish period of the old so-called\r\nIrish Parliament, duties to limit the importation of English goods and\r\nto foster home industries were not allowed. Ireland was stripped of\r\neverything but linen and “homespun,” and then left a beggar. This is a\r\nmost disgraceful chapter in the history of the political connection of\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland—one that led to untold bitterness, and that\r\ncaused the great orator, Grattan, in after years to exclaim,\r\nprophetically, in the Irish House of Commons: “What England tramples in\r\nIreland will rise to sting her in America!” He alluded to the\r\nPresbyterian and Catholic exodus, which so materially aided the American\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nThe last hope of King James again attaining the throne of the “Three\r\nKingdoms” disappeared with the terrible defeat inflicted on the French\r\nfleet at the battle of La Hogue, 1692, and, thereafter, his life was\r\npassed sadly—for he had ample time to ruminate on his misfortunes—at St.\r\nGermain, until he died, in 1701. His rival, William III, whose wife,\r\nQueen Mary II, had preceded him to the grave, died from the effects of a\r\nhorseback accident, in March, 1702. He was immediately succeeded by\r\nQueen Anne, the last of the Stuart line who occupied the throne of\r\nEngland. Her reign was one of glory for Great Britain and one of hate\r\nand horror for Ireland. We have already mentioned some of the penal laws\r\npassed while she held sway. Her ministers, of course, were responsible\r\nfor her acts, because she herself possessed only moderate ability.\r\nUnlike most of the Stuart family, she swam with the current, and so got\r\nalong smoothly with her English subjects. The most important domestic\r\nevent of her reign was the legislative union of England with\r\nScotland—which virtually extinguished Scotland as a nation. This event\r\noccurred in May, 1707, and was accompanied by acts of the most shameless\r\npolitical profligacy on the part of the English minister and the Scotch\r\nlords and commons. In fact, the independence of Scotland, like that of\r\nIreland ninety-three years later, was sold for titles, offices,\r\npensions, and cold cash. The masses of the people, to do them justice,\r\nhad little to do with this nefarious transaction, which was subsequently\r\nsatirized by the great Scottish poet, Robert Burns, in his lyric, one\r\nverse of which runs thus:\r\n\r\n                 “What English force could not subdue\r\n                   Through many warlike ages,\r\n                  Is sold now by a craven few\r\n                   For hireling traitors’ wages!\r\n                  The English steel we could disdain—\r\n                   Secure in valor’s station—\r\n                  But English gold has been our bane—\r\n                   Such a parcel of rogues in a nation!”\r\n\r\nThe deeds in arms of Anne’s great general, Marlborough, who was a\r\ntraitor to both King James and King William, have been partially related\r\nin the chapters bearing on the career of the Franco-Irish Brigade and\r\nneed no farther mention in this history.\r\n\r\nIn the days of William III appeared a pamphlet called “The Case of\r\nIreland Stated,” which was written by William Molyneux, a member of\r\nParliament, for the Dublin University. It appeared in 1698, and made, at\r\nonce, a powerful impression on the public mind. It, in brief, took the\r\nground that Ireland—that is, Protestant, colonial Ireland—was, of right,\r\na separate and independent kingdom; that England’s original title of\r\nconquest, if she had any, was abrogated by charters granted to Ireland\r\nfrom time to time, and, finally, denied that the king and Parliament of\r\nEngland had power to bind the kingdom and people of Ireland by\r\nEnglish-made laws. The English Parliament was, of course, greatly\r\nshocked and scandalized at the idea of a “mere Irishman” putting forth\r\nsuch theories, and solemnly ordered his book to be burned, publicly, by\r\n“the common hangman”—a functionary always in high favor when Ireland\r\nneeds to be “disciplined.” The book was burned accordingly, but its\r\nspirit did not die then, nor is it yet dead, or likely to die, while\r\nIreland contains a population. King William, in replying to the English\r\nParliament’s address on the subject of Molyneux’s utterance, assured its\r\nmembers that “he would enforce the laws securing the dependence of\r\nIreland on the imperial crown of Great Britain.”\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on the penal laws, many of the enactments of the reign of\r\nAnne have been summarized. Her sway was a moral nightmare over Ireland,\r\nand it is a remarkable historical coincidence that the Green Isle\r\nsuffered more, materially and morally, under the English female than the\r\nmale sovereigns. Under Elizabeth and Anne, the Irish Catholics were\r\npersecuted beyond belief. Under Victoria’s rule, which the British\r\nstatistician, Mulhall, has called “the deadliest since Elizabeth,” they\r\nstarved to death by the hundred thousand or emigrated by the million.\r\n\r\nThe régime of Queen Anne, like that of her predecessors and successors\r\non the throne, gave the government of Ireland into the hands of\r\nEnglishmen, who held all the important offices, from the viceroyalty\r\ndownward, and who chose their sub-officers from among the least national\r\nelement of the Irish people. This system, although somewhat modified,\r\ncontinues to the present day. In the Irish Parliament, there was an\r\noccasional faint display of sectarian nationality, but it proved of\r\nlittle advantage when the English wanted matters in that body to go as\r\nthey wished. Ireland then, as a majority ruled by a minority, “stood on\r\nher smaller end,” and so it is even in our own times, notwithstanding\r\noccasional “concessions” and “ameliorations.”\r\n\r\nBut, from the day when the pamphlet, or book, of Molyneux saw the light,\r\na Patriot party began to grow up in the Irish Parliament. The old Irish\r\nnation had, indeed, disappeared, for a period, but the new one soon\r\nbegan to manifest a spirit that roused the bitter hatred of England.\r\nSuch infatuated Irish Protestants as still believed that they would be\r\nmore gently treated on account of common creed with the stronger people\r\nwere soon bitterly undeceived.\r\n\r\nThe death of Queen Anne, all of whose children by the Prince of Denmark\r\nhad died before her, occurred in July, 1714. It is said that she\r\nsecretly favored the succession of her half-brother, acknowledged by\r\nLouis XIV, and the Jacobite party in Great Britain, as James III of that\r\nrealm, but the last Duke of Ormond, the Earl of Orrery, Bishop\r\nAtterbury, and Lord Bolingbroke, the Jacobite leaders in England, lost\r\ntheir nerve after the Queen’s death and allowed the golden opportunity\r\nof proclaiming the exiled Stuart king to pass away. The Hanoverian\r\nfaction, which called James “the Pretender,” took advantage of their\r\nvacillation to proclaim the Elector of Hanover, who derived his claim\r\nfrom the Act of Succession or Settlement (which ignored the Stuart male\r\nline, or any of its Catholic collateral branches, and excluded them from\r\nthe throne), under the title of George I. He derived his claim, such as\r\nit was, from James I, whose daughter, the Princess Elizabeth, had\r\nmarried the King of Bohemia. Her daughter, Sophia, married the Elector\r\nof Hanover and became mother of King George, who was a thorough German\r\nin speech, manner, and habit, although not in person or in manly\r\ncharacteristics. But he was a Protestant, and that sufficed for England.\r\nOn August 1, 1714, he was proclaimed in London and Edinburgh, and on the\r\n8th of that month in Dublin. The Scotch Jacobites ridiculed his\r\naccession in a racy “skit,” which began with—\r\n\r\n                 “Oh, wha the deil hae we got for a king\r\n                  But a wee, wee German lairdie!”\r\n\r\nIreland, broken in spirit and disgusted by the memory of King James II,\r\nremained quiescent, but, in 1715, Scotland and a portion of the north of\r\nEngland rose in rebellion, the former under the Earl of Mar and the\r\nlatter under young Lord Derwentwater. They were not heartily supported.\r\nBoth met with defeat, and Derwentwater, together with several English\r\nand Scotch adherents of note, was captured, beheaded, and had his\r\nestates confiscated to the “crown.” The English Parliament offered a\r\nreward of £50,000 ($250,000) for the “apprehension” of “the Pretender,”\r\nwho had been previously “attainted,” but there were no takers, “the\r\nPretender” aforesaid being safely housed in Paris. This bloody episode\r\nended Jacobite “risings” in Great Britain for a generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n      Further Commercial Restrictions—Continued Exodus of Working\r\n  People—Jonathan Swift—“The Patriot Party”—Tyranny of Primate Boulter\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEING that Ireland had taken no part in the attempted Stuart revolution\r\nat the beginning of his reign, it might be imagined that George I showed\r\nsome favor to the Irish people, but he did nothing of the kind. On the\r\ncontrary, the penal laws were enforced with greater virulence than ever,\r\nand several new enactments of a most oppressive character—chiefly\r\nbearing on the franchise—were passed. In 1719, the Patriot party in the\r\nIrish Parliament threw down a challenge to English supremacy. The Irish\r\nHouse of Lords annulled, on appeal, from the Dublin Court of Exchequer,\r\na judgment in favor of one Annesley and gave it to the opposition\r\nlitigant, Hester Sherlock. The former appealed to the English lords, who\r\noverrode the decision of the Irish House, by reversing judgment in favor\r\nof Annesley. As the sheriff in whose jurisdiction (Kildare) the writ ran\r\nrefused to obey the English decree, he was heavily fined. The Irish\r\nHouse retaliated by remitting the fine, applauding the sheriff and\r\narresting the judges of the Dublin court who had decided for Annesley.\r\nThe anger of England became boundless, as it usually does when Ireland\r\nasserts itself, and the English Parliament, without color of right,\r\npassed the drastic enactment, known as the 6th of George I, which\r\ndefinitively bound Ireland by English enactments, and took the right of\r\nappeal away from the Irish House of Peers. Thus was the chain begun by\r\nthe Poynings’ Law, in the reign of Henry VII, made complete, and, at one\r\nfell swoop, Ireland was reduced to a provincial status. Thenceforth,\r\nuntil 1780, the Irish Parliament was merely a machine for registering\r\nthe will of England, in the matter of Irish government.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, England continued her war on the few remaining Irish\r\nindustries—nothing seemed to satisfy the jealousy and covetousness of\r\nher merchants. The glaring outrages committed against the business of\r\nIreland aroused the ire of the famous Jonathan Swift, Protestant Dean of\r\nSt. Patrick’s, who was the son of an Englishman. He wrote, anonymously,\r\nseveral bitter pamphlets against the selfish policy of England, and\r\nurged the Irish people to use nothing but native manufactures. In one of\r\nthese fulminations, he used the memorable phrase: “Burn everything that\r\ncomes from England, except the coal!” But his patriotic influence rose\r\nto the zenith when he attacked “Wood’s half-pence”—base money coined to\r\nmeet a financial emergency—in 1723. His philippics became known as the\r\n“Drapier’s letters” from the signature attached to them, and, in the\r\nend, he compelled the government to cancel the contract with Wood.\r\nEngland foamed with rage, and had the printer of the letters prosecuted.\r\nHowever, no judge or jury in Dublin was found vile enough to convict\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nSwift, although an Irish patriot, was a Protestant bigot, and detested\r\nthe Celtic Catholics quite as much as he did the English, whom, from a\r\npolitical standpoint, he hated. Yet, he was the idol, during his long\r\nlifetime, of the Catholics, because he had stood by Ireland against the\r\ncommon enemy. This brilliant man, whose writings have made him immortal,\r\nand whose private sorrows can not be estimated, finally “withered at the\r\ntop,” and died insane, after having willed his property to be used for\r\nthe building of a lunatic asylum. In a poem written some time before his\r\nsad death, he alludes to his bequest in the following lines:\r\n\r\n                  “He left what little wealth he had\r\n                   To build a house for fools and mad—\r\n                   To show, by one sarcastic touch,\r\n                   No nation needed one so much!”\r\n\r\nNo writer better knew how to enrage the English. He took a savage\r\ndelight in tormenting them, wounding their vanity, and exposing their\r\nweaknesses. Neither did he spare the Irish; and, as for the Scotch, he\r\nrivaled Dr. Samuel Johnson in his dislike of that people. In our day,\r\nthe average summer-up of merits and demerits would describe Jonathan\r\nSwift as “a gifted crank.”\r\n\r\nAssociated with him in the moral war against English interference in\r\nIreland’s domestic concerns were such other shining lights of the period\r\nas Dr. Sheridan, ancestor of Richard Brinsley, and others of that\r\nbrilliant “ilk”: Dr. Stopford, the able Bishop of Cloyne, and Doctors\r\nJackson, Helsham, Delaney, and Walmsley, nearly all men of almost pure\r\nEnglish descent. McGee also credits “the three reverend brothers\r\nGrattan”—a name subsequently destined to immortality—with good work in\r\nthe same connection.\r\n\r\nWhatever the private faults of Swift, Ireland must ever hold his memory\r\nin reverence, with those of many other Irish non-Catholic patriots, who,\r\nalthough they had little or no Celtic blood in their veins, and were\r\nbrought up under English influences, nobly preferred the interests of\r\ntheir unfortunate native country to the smiles and favors of her\r\noppressors. And so Ireland, considering these things, blesses\r\n\r\n                      “—The men of patriot pen,\r\n                       Swift, Molyneux, and Lucas,”\r\n\r\nas fervently as if they belonged to the race of the Hy-Niall or\r\nKinel-Conal.\r\n\r\nNor must it be supposed that the Patriot element, led by Swift, escaped\r\npersecution at the hands of the Protestant oligarchy, although they,\r\ntoo, were of the Established Church. Swift himself was discriminated\r\nagainst all his life, because of his advocacy of Irish manufactures, his\r\ndiscrediting of Wood’s “brass money,” and his defeat of the mischievous\r\nnational bank project, which was germane to it. As diocese after diocese\r\nbecame vacant in Ireland, he saw dullards promoted to the sees, while he\r\nwas deliberately overlooked, simply because he had advocated justice to\r\nIreland! This injustice afterward passed into a proverb. Said an Irish\r\norator, in after years, speaking of another great Irishman who had also\r\nsuffered from English resentment: “The curse of Swift was upon him—to\r\nhave been born an Irishman, to have been blessed with talents, and to\r\nhave used those talents for the benefit of his country!”\r\n\r\nBut Swift was not the only sufferer. There were other distinguished\r\noffenders against English sentiment. It is true they had not provoked\r\nthe government by their writings to offer a reward of £300 for their\r\nidentity, as was Swift’s fortune, but they had done enough to be made\r\n“horrible examples” of. Thus, Right Rev. Dr. Browne, Protestant Bishop\r\nof Cork, had been threatened with deprivation for protesting against the\r\ninsulting language toward Catholics contained in the notorious Orange\r\ntoast to the memory of William III; and Dr. Sheridan was deprived of his\r\n“living” in Munster, because, says McGee, “he accidentally chose for his\r\ntext on the anniversary of King George’s coronation: ‘Sufficient for the\r\nday is the evil thereof!’ Such,” he continues, “was the intolerance of\r\nthe oligarchy toward their own clergy. What must it have been to\r\nothers!”\r\n\r\nAbout this period, too, the differences between Episcopalians and\r\nNonconformists—the latter having again repudiated the test oaths—became\r\nmore bitter than ever. Swift took sides against the Dissenters, whom, as\r\na fierce Church of England champion, he despised. “They were glad,” he\r\nsaid, they or their fathers, “to leave their barren hills of Lochaber\r\nfor the fruitful vales of Down and Antrim.” He denied to them, with\r\nbitter scorn, the title they had assumed of “Brother Protestants,” and\r\nas to the Papists they affected to contemn, they were, in his opinion,\r\n“as much superior to the Dissenters as a lion, though chained and\r\nclipped of its claws, is a stronger and nobler animal than an angry cat,\r\nat liberty to fly at the throats of true churchmen.” Of course, the\r\nChurch of England faction triumphed and the exodus of the Nonconformists\r\nfrom Ireland received a fresh impetus. “Outraged,” says McGee, “in their\r\ndearest civil and religious rights, thousands of the Scoto-Irish of\r\nUlster, and the Milesian and Anglo-Irish of the other provinces,\r\npreferred to encounter the perils of the wild Atlantic rather than abide\r\nunder the yoke and lash of such an oligarchy. In the year 1729, five\r\nthousand six hundred Irish landed at the single port of Philadelphia; in\r\nthe next ten years they furnished to the Carolinas and Georgia the\r\nmajority of their immigrants; before the end of this reign [George I]\r\nseveral thousands of heads of families, all bred and married in Ireland,\r\nwere rearing up a free posterity along the slopes of the Blue Ridge in\r\nVirginia and Maryland, and even as far north as the valleys of the\r\nHudson and the Merrimac. In the ranks of the thirteen United Colonies,\r\nthe descendants of those Irish Nonconformists were to repeat, for the\r\nbenefit of George III, the lesson and example their ancestors had taught\r\nto James II at Inniskillen and Derry.”\r\n\r\nWe do not purpose entering into a chronological account of the several\r\nviceroys—most of them rather obscure—who represented English\r\nmisgovernment in Ireland during the reigns of the early Georges. They\r\nsimply followed out the old programme of oppression and repression with\r\ntiresome monotony. No matter who “held court” in Dublin Castle, the\r\npolicy of England toward Ireland remained unchanged. If ever there came\r\na lull in the course of systematic persecution, it followed immediately\r\non some reverse of the English arms on the Continent of Europe. An\r\nEnglish victory meant added taxes and further coercion for the Irish\r\nCatholics and Dissenters.\r\n\r\nGeorge I had died in 1727, leaving behind him an unsavory moral\r\nreputation, and regretted by nobody in England, except his Hanoverian\r\nmistresses, who were noted for their pinguid ugliness. He was succeeded\r\nwithout opposition by his son, who mounted the throne as George II. He,\r\ntoo, was small of stature, un-English in language and appearance, and\r\ninherited the vices of his father. He was not deficient in personal\r\nbravery, as he proved at Dettingen, and elsewhere, in after times, and\r\nhe had the distinction of being the last king of England who appeared\r\nupon a field of battle.\r\n\r\nThe penal code was continued in full force during most of this reign,\r\nalthough it had lost favor among the English governing class in the time\r\nof the king’s father, when the Protestant Ascendency party in the Irish\r\nCommons brazenly proposed to the English Privy Council the passage of an\r\nact whereby a proscribed prelate or priest arrested in Ireland would be\r\nmade to suffer indecent mutilation. Bad as the English privy councilors\r\ngenerally were, where Ireland was concerned, they would not stomach such\r\nrevolting savagery, and the hideous proposition was heard of no more.\r\nAnd yet England, knowing the ferocious character of the fanatics who\r\nproposed it, left Ireland virtually helpless in their hands! She could\r\nhave, at any time, put an end to the intolerable persecutions visited\r\nupon the masses of the people by a heartless oligarchy, actuated about\r\nequally by cupidity and fierce intolerance. Had she done so, she might\r\nhave won the Irish heart, as France won that of German Alsace and\r\nItalian Corsica, but she preferred to use one section of the Irish\r\npeople against the other, in her lust of empire, and “Divide and\r\nConquer” became, as in the Elizabethan times, the pith of her Irish\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nThe great English minister, Sir Robert Walpole, impressed by the\r\nnecessity of breaking down the spirit of independence evoked by Swift\r\nand his able and patriotic colleagues, who had indeed “breathed a new\r\nsoul” into the Ireland of their day, appointed that inveterate\r\npolitician and corrupt diplomat, Lord Carteret, viceroy. He also\r\npromoted the Right Rev. Hugh Boulter, Bishop of Bristol, also an\r\nEnglishman of the virulent type, to the Archbishopric of Armagh—the\r\nprimal see of Ireland. Boulter was Castlereagh’s precursor in policy.\r\nPossessed of high office and vast wealth, he did not hesitate to use\r\nboth prestige and money in the interests of England, and his corruption\r\nof many members of the Irish Parliament was so open and flagrant as to\r\nscandalize even the brazen chiefs of the atrocious “Court party”—the\r\nPrætorean guard of Lord Carteret. This unscrupulous churchman was the\r\nvirtual head of the English interest in Ireland for eighteen years, and,\r\nwithin that period, overshadowing even viceregal authority, he made the\r\nEnglish name more hated among not alone the Celtic, but the Scoto and\r\nAnglo-Irish than it had been for a century. He was the greatest\r\npersecutor of the Catholics that had appeared since the period of\r\nCromwell, and he it was who manipulated the machinery of Parliament to\r\ndeprive them of the last vestige of their civil and religious liberty in\r\nthe closing days of the brutal reign, in Ireland, of George I. Nor did\r\nthe Presbyterians and other dissenters fare much better at his hands.\r\nHis black career terminated in 1742, and a weight of horror was lifted\r\nfrom Ireland’s heart when the welcome news of his death spread rapidly,\r\nfar and wide, over the persecuted country.\r\n\r\nWhat made “Primate Boulter” particularly odious to the Catholic people\r\nof Ireland was his institution of the “Charter Schools”—used openly and\r\ninsultingly for the perversion of the majority of the population from\r\nthe Roman Catholic faith. Since that period, English politicians have\r\nnot hesitated to use the influence of the Roman See, with more or less\r\nsuccess, to curb political movements in Ireland. Even then, when England\r\nwas enforcing the penal laws against the Irish Catholics with fire and\r\nsword, she was the ally of Catholic Austria against the French, and\r\nglibly advocated toleration for the Protestants of the Hapsburg empire,\r\nwhile her “priest-hunters” industriously earned their putrid “blood\r\nmoney” in unfortunate, Catholic Ireland. We may say, in passing, that\r\nPrimate Boulter was succeeded in the primacy by another Englishman,\r\nRight Rev. George Stone, who proved himself worthy of his predecessor.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n           Official Extravagance—Charles Lucas, Leader of Irish\r\n Opposition—Chesterfield Viceroy—His Recall—Dorset’s Vile Administration\r\n\r\n\r\nAN attempt made in 1729 to place an extortionate estimate on the public\r\nexpenses, and which emanated from “the Castle of Dublin,” had the effect\r\nof consolidating the Irish opposition in Parliament. These legislators\r\nprotested in a dignified manner against extravagance in public\r\nexpenditure. Under the administration of the Duke of Devonshire, in\r\n1737, they set their faces against his method of corrupting the public\r\nconscience by a display of lavish generosity, which is always popular in\r\na capital where trade depends to a great extent on courtly favor. The\r\nleaders in the House of Commons were Sir Edward O’Brien, of the House of\r\nInchiquin; his son, Sir Lucius; the Speaker, Henry Boyle, and Mr.\r\nAnthony Malone, whose father had been an efficient ally of Sir Toby\r\nButler, in defending Catholic rights under the articles of Limerick.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen were ably assisted by Dr. Charles Lucas, who, although\r\nnot a member of the House, possessed a vast outside influence, because\r\nof his great talent and moral worth. The doctor was also a druggist by\r\nprofession, but could use a virile pen even better than he could a\r\npestle and mortar. In 1741, he began hammering the government in public\r\nprints, on the lines of Molyneux and Swift, and with almost as great\r\nsuccess. But “the Castle” censor came down upon him, and he was\r\ncompelled to leave Ireland for a period. Like Swift, he was rather\r\nantagonistic to Catholic claims, but, as in the case of the great Dean,\r\nthe Catholics forgave him because he was true to Ireland. After some\r\nyears of exile, he returned to Dublin, was elected to Parliament, and\r\nbecame a leader of the Patriots in the House of Commons. In the House of\r\nLords, the Earl of Kildare, afterward first Duke of Leinster, was the\r\nPatriot leader.\r\n\r\nThe famous Earl of Chesterfield became Viceroy of Ireland in 1745, and\r\nshowed, from the first, a thorough disgust for the penal laws and the\r\noligarchs who supported them. He connived at Catholic toleration to such\r\nan extent that he became an object of suspicion, if not of hatred, to\r\nthe Ascendency faction. The government of England, with habitual\r\ncunning, had selected this finished courtier to rule in Ireland, because\r\nof disquieting rumors of an invasion of Great Britain contemplated by\r\nCharles Edward Stuart, son of “the Pretender,” James III. Also, about\r\nthe same time, came the stirring news of the victory of the Irish\r\nBrigade, in alliance with the French, over the Duke of Cumberland’s\r\ncolumn at glorious Fontenoy. “Accursed,” old George II is said to have\r\nexclaimed, on being told of the Franco-Irish victory, “accursed be the\r\nlaws that deprive _me_ of such soldiers!” But Chesterfield was, in\r\nreality, friendly to the Irish. He liked their wit and esprit and took\r\nno pains to conceal the fact, greatly to the disgust of the Ascendency\r\nclique. But Charles Edward’s attempt to recover the British crown\r\nutterly failed. Highland Scotland fought for him heroically. The\r\nJacobites of England held, for the most part, aloof, and, beyond the\r\nofficers of the Irish Brigade, who went with him from France, Ireland\r\nhardly furnished a man to aid his hardy and romantic enterprise—thus\r\nshowing how completely her spirit was subdued during that momentous\r\ncrisis. Charles Edward was a leader that, in the preceding century, the\r\nIrish would have been proud to follow. He was a great improvement on\r\nboth his sire and grandsire, although he ended miserably, in his old\r\nage, a career begun so gloriously in his youth.\r\n\r\nChesterfield remained only eight months in his Irish office. He was\r\nrecalled within ten days after the battle of Culloden. There was no\r\nfurther need, for the time being, to conciliate the Irish. The heir of\r\nthe unhappy Stuarts was a houseless wanderer in the land over which his\r\nforefathers had reigned for centuries and their cause was hopelessly\r\nlost. The Earl and Countess of Chesterfield, on their departure from\r\nDublin, received “a popular ovation.” They walked on foot, arm in arm,\r\nfrom the viceregal residence to the wharf, where lay the vessel that was\r\nto bear them back to England, and the warm-hearted, “too easily deluded\r\npeople” prayed loud and fervently for their speedy return. They came\r\nback no more, but Chesterfield was enabled to assure George II, when he\r\nreached London, that the only “dangerous Papist” he had seen in Ireland\r\nwas the lovely Miss Ambrose, afterward Mrs. Palmer, Dublin’s reigning\r\nbeauty of the period. Chesterfield made much of her at “the Castle,” and\r\nlaughed politely at the bigots who looked upon her as a species of\r\nDelilah. As Miss Ambrose enjoyed, also, the friendship of Lady\r\nChesterfield, her enemies could evoke no scandal from the platonic\r\nintimacy. The earl’s mild, insinuating system of government had enabled\r\nhim to spare four regiments from Ireland for service in Scotland, during\r\nthe Jacobite insurrection. His “Principles of Politeness,” practically\r\napplied, were much more effective in the cause of the House of Hanover\r\nthan all the repressive enactments of the vicious bigots of the party of\r\nAscendency.\r\n\r\nThe last Jacobite expedition was organized in France, in 1759, and was\r\nunder orders of an admiral named Conflans, who, when a short distance\r\nout from Brest, was encountered by an English fleet under Admiral Hawke\r\nand totally defeated. A wing of this expedition, under Commodore Thurot,\r\nwhose real name was O’Farrell, did not arrive in time to take part in\r\nthe battle, but succeeded in entering the British Channel without\r\ninterruption. A storm arose which drove Thurot’s five frigates to seek\r\nshelter in Norway and the Orkney Islands, where they wintered. In the\r\nspring, one frigate made its way back to France. Another sailed with a\r\nsimilar object, but was never heard from afterward. The remaining three,\r\nunder Thurot, made for the Irish coast and entered Lough Foyle, but made\r\nno attempt on Londonderry. They soon headed for Belfast Lough, and\r\nappeared before Carrickfergus about the end of February, 1760. Thurot\r\ndemanded the surrender of the place, which was stoutly refused by the\r\nmilitary governor, Colonel Jennings. The Franco-Irish sailor immediately\r\nlanded his fighting men and took the town by a rapid and furious\r\nassault. Then he levied on the place for supplies and again put to sea.\r\nOff the Isle of Man he fell in with three newly commissioned ships of\r\nwar under the English Commodore, Elliott. A sanguinary encounter\r\nfollowed. Thurot, alias O’Farrell, and three hundred of his marines and\r\nsailors were killed. The French vessels were fearful wrecks, and the\r\nvictorious English towed them in a sinking condition into Ramsay. Thus\r\nterminated one of the most gallant naval episodes of the eighteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nWhen the Earl of Harrington, afterward Duke of Devonshire, became Lord\r\nLieutenant some time after the recall of Lord Chesterfield, the odious\r\nPrimate Stone—accused both in England and Ireland of unspeakable\r\nimmorality—ruled Ireland as completely as had his less filthy\r\npredecessor, Primate Boulter. Ireland, at the outset of the new régime,\r\nwas astonished to find a respectable surplus in her treasury, and Lord\r\nChesterfield, who always, while he lived, took a deep interest in Irish\r\naffairs, sent a congratulatory letter on the seeming prosperity of the\r\ncountry to his friend, the Bishop of Waterford. The Patriot party in the\r\nCommons, led by the sagacious and eloquent Malone, advocated the\r\nexpenditure of the surplus on public works and needed public buildings\r\nthroughout Ireland and in the capital. But Stone and the Castle ring\r\nfought the proposition bitterly, contending that the money belonged to\r\nthe crown and could be drawn by royal order on the vice-treasurer,\r\nwithout regard to Parliament. When the Duke of Dorset succeeded\r\nHarrington as viceroy, in 1751, the question had reached an acute stage.\r\nOpposition to the royal claim on the Irish surplus had led to the\r\nexpulsion of Dr. Lucas from Ireland. But Malone and Speaker Boyle kept\r\nup the fight in the Commons, and, after having sustained one defeat, on\r\na full vote, finally came out victorious by having the supply bill,\r\nwhich covered all government service in the kingdom, thrown out by a\r\nvote of 122 to 117. Government showed its resentment by canceling\r\nMalone’s patent of precedence as Prime Sergeant, and striking Speaker\r\nBoyle’s name from the list of privy-councilors. This was outrageous\r\nenough, but what followed was still more so. The king (George II) by\r\nadvice of Dorset, Stone, and their clique, overrode the action of the\r\nIrish Parliament and despotically, by operation of a king’s letter,\r\nwithdrew the long-disputed surplus from the Irish national treasury.\r\nThis crowning infamy was consummated in 1753, and so great became public\r\nindignation that Stone and the obnoxious ministers were mobbed, and the\r\nDuke of Dorset could not appear on the streets of Dublin without being\r\nhooted at and otherwise insulted. Anglo-Ireland seemed on the brink of\r\nrevolution, but the popular leaders took a conservative attitude and\r\nthus avoided a violent crisis. Dorset, alarmed by the tempest he had\r\nhimself created, virtually fled from Dublin, followed by the execration\r\nof the multitude. He left the government in the hands of three Lords\r\nJustices, one of whom was Primate Stone, whose very name was hateful to\r\nthe incensed people.\r\n\r\nThe viceroy was followed to England by the popular leader of the Irish\r\nHouse of Lords, James Fitz-Gerald, 20th Earl of Kildare, who had married\r\nthe daughter of the Duke of Richmond, and, consequently, had a powerful\r\nEnglish backing. Kildare presented to King George, in person, a memorial\r\nin which he strongly denounced the misgovernment of Ireland by Dorset,\r\nStone, and Lord George Sackville, Dorset’s intermeddling son. This\r\nmemorial has been described as “the boldest ever addressed by a subject\r\nto a sovereign.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Lord Holderness, an English courtier, in a letter to Chancellor\r\nJocelyn, says that the bold Geraldine “was but ill-received and very\r\ncoolly dismissed” by the king, Kildare’s policy soon prevailed in\r\nIreland. Dorset was recalled in the succeeding year, and Primate Stone,\r\nwith whom Kildare refused to act as Lord Justice, was removed from the\r\nministry of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Devonshire, formerly Lord Harrington, or Hartington,\r\nsucceeded Dorset, and immediately began the congenial work, to an\r\nEnglish statesman, of breaking up, and rendering harmless, the Irish\r\nPatriot party. Boyle was made Chancellor of the Exchequer and was raised\r\nto the peerage as the Earl of Shannon, receiving also a pension of\r\n£2,000 per annum for thirty-one years. Malone would have accepted the\r\nLord Chancellorship gladly, but was restrained by both private and\r\npublic opinion from doing so openly. But Mitchel says that while Boyle\r\nremained nominal chancellor, Malone quietly pocketed the profits of the\r\nposition, and his patriotic eloquence declined in proportion to the\r\ngrowth of his profits. Other leaders of the Patriot party were also\r\n“taken care of,” and England managed to get rid of one of her most\r\ntroublesome “Irish difficulties.”\r\n\r\nThe purchased Patriots, however, may be fairly credited with having\r\nforced the beginning of the public works, such as canals and highways,\r\nin Ireland, and the construction of some of those splendid official\r\nedifices which still, even in their decay, “lend an Italian glory to the\r\nIrish metropolis.”\r\n\r\nLord Kildare stands accused of having entered into the negotiations with\r\nthe new viceroy for the “placation” of the Patriot party in the Commons.\r\nSuch, however, were the political “morals” of the times, and the offices\r\nwere, nominally at least, Irish and, therefore, quasi, not fully,\r\nnational—seeing that Ireland was what might be called a semi-independent\r\ncolonial province, distrustful of England, but without strength or\r\nresolution to snap her chains. The earl soon became Marquis of Kildare,\r\nand, subsequently, Duke of Leinster, but he is best remembered as the\r\nfather of the gallant, unselfish, and devoted Lord Edward Fitzgerald, of\r\n1798 fame.\r\n\r\nAn attempt made, in March, 1756, to pass a bill in the Irish Commons to\r\nvacate the seats of such members as should accept “any pension or civil\r\noffice of profit from the crown,” was defeated by a vote of 85 to\r\n59—thus giving plain notice to the English viceroy that the Parliament\r\nwas up for auction, and, within less than fifty years from that date, it\r\nwas, accordingly, like that of Scotland, “knocked down to the highest\r\nbidder.” How could it be otherwise? When, as Mitchel truly says in his\r\nContinuation of McGeoghegan’s “History of Ireland,” “The English\r\nProtestant colony in Ireland, which aspired to be a nation, amounted to\r\nsomething under half a million of souls, in 1754. It was out of the\r\nquestion that it should be united on a footing of equality with its\r\npotent mother country by ‘the golden link of the crown,’ because the\r\nwearer of that crown was sure to be guided in his policy by English\r\nministers, in accordance with English interests; and, as the army was\r\nthe king’s army, he could always enforce that policy. The fatal weakness\r\nof the colony was that it would not amalgamate with the mass of the\r\nIrish people (_i.e._ the Catholics) so as to form a true nation, but set\r\nup the vain pretension to hold down a whole disfranchised people with\r\none hand and defy all England with the other.” And this insensate policy\r\nwas pursued, with little modification, to the end, and in the end proved\r\nfatal to both “the colony” and the nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n      More Persecution of Catholics Under George II—Secret Committee\r\n Formed—Snubbed by the Speaker—Received by the Viceroy—Anti-Union Riot in\r\n                                  Dublin\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Duke of Bedford became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1757, and came\r\nas a “conciliator,” with a smile on his face “and a bribe in his\r\npocket.” His mission was to “soften” the penal laws, which had again\r\nbecome too scandalous for the “liberal” and “civilized” reputation of\r\nEngland on the Continent. One Miss O’Toole, a Catholic, had been pressed\r\nby some Protestant friends to “conform” to the Established Church, so as\r\nto avoid persecution, and fled to the house of a relative named Saul,\r\nwho resided in Dublin, in order to escape disagreeable importunity. Mr.\r\nSaul was prosecuted and convicted, under the penal code, and the judge\r\nwho “tried” the case said, in his charge, that “Papists had no rights,”\r\nbecause the “law” under which poor Saul was punished “did not,” in the\r\nlanguage of the court, “presume a Papist to exist in the kingdom, nor\r\ncould Papists so much as breathe the air without the connivance of\r\ngovernment!” This judge, harsh as his language may now seem, did not\r\nmisstate the case, for such, indeed, was the barbarous “law of the land”\r\nat that period, and for a considerable time afterward.\r\n\r\nThe bigots in the Irish Commons, soon after the arrival of the Duke of\r\nBedford in Dublin, had prepared a new and even more drastic bill of\r\npenalties against Catholics than already existed, and so intolerable\r\nwere its proposals that several leading Catholics among “the nobility,\r\ngentry, and professional [clandestinely] classes” got together, and,\r\nafter a time, formed, in out-of-the-way meeting places, the first\r\n“Catholic Committee” of Ireland—the precursor, by the way, of the many\r\nsimilar organizations conducted by John Keogh, Daniel O’Connell, and\r\nother Catholic leaders of succeeding generations.\r\n\r\nThe chief men of this committee were Charles O’Conor, the Irish\r\nscholar and antiquary; Dr. Curry, the historical reviewer; Mr. Wyse, a\r\nleading merchant of the city of Waterford; Lords Fingal, Devlin,\r\nTaaffe, and some others less known to fame. These amiable gentlemen\r\nwere, at first, frightened by the sound of their own voices, but they\r\ngradually grew bolder, although they did not proceed far enough to\r\nbring down upon their heads the full wrath of “government.” Indeed,\r\nthey were, on most occasions, obsequiously “loyal” to the “crown,”\r\nwhich meant the English king and connection. But the iron had entered\r\ntheir souls, and the stain of its corrosion lingered long in their\r\nveins. When the Duke of Bedford, by the instructions of the elder Pitt\r\n(Chatham), who acted for King George, informed the Irish Parliament\r\nthat France contemplated a new invasion and called upon the Irish\r\npeople to show their loyalty to the House of Hanover, Charles O’Conor\r\ndrew up an abjectly “loyal” address, which was signed by 300 leading\r\nCatholics, and had it presented at the bar of the House of Commons\r\n(Dublin) by Messrs. Antony MacDermott and John Crump. The speaker, Mr.\r\nPonsonby, received the document in dead silence, laid it on the table\r\nin front of him, and coolly bowed the delegation out. The Duke of\r\nBedford, however, took “gracious” notice of the address, and caused\r\nhis answer thereto, which was appreciative—England being then in\r\nmortal terror of the French—to be printed in the Dublin “Gazette,”\r\nwhich was the “government’s” official organ. And the poor Catholic\r\ngentlemen, who had signed the cringing document, went into convulsions\r\nof joy because of this “official recognition” of their slavish\r\nprofessions of “loyalty” to a foreign king, who cared less for them\r\nthan for the blacks of the West Indies!\r\n\r\nBut Mitchel, the Protestant historian, who understood his country’s sad\r\nstory better, perhaps, than any writer who ever dealt with it, makes for\r\nthe Catholic committee this ingenious apology: “We may feel indignant,”\r\nsays he, “at the extreme humility of the proceedings of the committee,\r\nand lament that the low condition of our countrymen at that time left no\r\nalternative but that of professing a hypocritical ‘loyalty’ to their\r\noppressors; for the only other alternative was secret organization to\r\nprepare an insurrection for the total extirpation of the English colony\r\nin Ireland, and, carefully disarmed as the Catholics were [and still\r\nare], they, doubtless, felt this to be an impossible project. Yet, for\r\nthe honor of human nature, it is necessary to state the fact that this\r\nprofession of loyalty, to a king of England, was, in reality, insincere.\r\nHypocrisy, in such a case, is less disgraceful than would have been a\r\ngenuine canine attachment to the hand that smote and to the foot that\r\nkicked.”\r\n\r\nBut Bedford, in his policy of conciliation, had even a deeper motive\r\nthan fear of France. The statesmen of England, jealous of even the poor\r\nand almost impotent colonial Parliament of Ireland, so early as 1759,\r\ncontemplated that “legislative union,” which was to be effected in later\r\ntimes. Bedford’s design was the truly English one of arraying the Irish\r\nCatholics against the Protestant nationalists, who had, with England’s\r\nwilling aid, so cruelly persecuted them. When this project got mooted\r\nabroad, the Protestant mob of Dublin—the Catholics were too cowed at the\r\ntime to act, and their leaders were committed to Bedford by their\r\naddress—rose in their might, on December 3, 1759, surrounded the Houses\r\nof Parliament and uttered tumultuous shouts of “No Union! no Union!”\r\nThey stopped every member of Parliament, as he approached to enter the\r\nHouse, and made him swear that he would oppose the union project. They\r\nviolently assaulted the Lord Chancellor, whom they believed to be a\r\nUnionist, together with many other lords, spiritual and secular, and\r\n“ducked” one member of the Privy Council in the river Liffey. The\r\nSpeaker and Secretary of the House of Commons had to appear in the\r\nportico of the House and solemnly assure the people that no union was\r\ncontemplated. Even this assurance did not quell the tumult, and,\r\nfinally, a fierce charge of dragoons and the bayonets of a numerous\r\ninfantry, accompanied by a threat of using cannon, cleared the streets.\r\nFollowing up the policy of “conciliation,” the Catholic leaders, with\r\nslavish haste, repudiated the actions of the Protestant mob, and thus\r\nproduced a contemptuous bitterness in the Protestant mind, which\r\naggravated the factious feeling in the unfortunate country. England’s\r\nwork was well done. She had planted, as a small seed, the idea of\r\nabsorbing the Irish Parliament some day, and was willing to let it take\r\nits own time to ripen into Dead Sea fruit for Ireland. The Catholic\r\nhelot had been cunningly played off against his Protestant oppressor,\r\nand thus the subject nation had been made the forger of its own\r\nfetters—at least in appearance, although England was the real artificer.\r\nMany Catholics in humble life may have joined in the Dublin anti-union\r\nriots, but the Catholic chiefs, who had their own axe to grind, were\r\nresolved to appear “loyal”—all the more so because some of the\r\nProtestant leaders in the late disorders sought to fasten the\r\nresponsibility on the members of the proscribed faith. The outbreak, as\r\nwas well known, was mainly the work of the followers of Dr. Lucas, then\r\nin exile, but soon to be a Member of Parliament, and the fiercest\r\nopponent of a legislative union with Great Britain.\r\n\r\n“It deserves remark,” says a historian of the period, “that on this\r\nfirst occasion, when a project of a legislative union was really\r\nentertained by an English ministry, the Patriot party which opposed it\r\nwas wholly and exclusively of the Protestant colony, and that the\r\nCatholics of Ireland were totally indifferent, and, indeed, they could\r\nnot rationally be otherwise, as it was quite impossible for them to feel\r\nan attachment to a national legislature in which they were not\r\nrepresented, and for whose members they could not even cast a vote.”\r\n\r\nGeorge II died of “rupture of the heart”—probably from the bursting of\r\nan arterial aneurism in that region—in 1760. He was never popular in\r\nEngland, because of his German ways and affections, and the Irish people\r\nregarded him with indifference. They had never seen him, and he was\r\nabout as much of a stranger in his Irish realm as the Shah of Persia or\r\nthe Khan of Tartary. His reign had lasted twenty-eight years, and, in\r\nall that period, the estimated population of Ireland—for there was no\r\nregular census—increased only 60,000. Presbyterian and Catholic\r\nemigration to the colonies—superinduced by the penal laws against\r\nboth—was mainly the cause of this remarkable stagnation. There had been\r\ntwo famines also, and the victims of artificial scarcity—a condition\r\nproduced by restrictions on trade and manufacture—were numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n  Accession of George III—His Character—Boasts of Being “a Briton”—Death\r\n of Dr. Lucas—Lord Townsend’s Novel Idea of Governing Ireland—Septennial\r\n                            Parliament Refused\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE long reign of George III, grandson of the late monarch, began in the\r\nmonth of October, 1760, when he had attained the age of 22 years. His\r\nfather, Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales, was a dissolute and almost\r\nimbecile person, and was hated by his own father, George II, with a most\r\nunnatural hatred. No doubt he, in great measure, deserved it, for a\r\nmember of his own family described Frederick Louis as being “the\r\ngreatest brute and ass in Christendom.” George III, when he mounted the\r\nEnglish throne, was a dull, commonplace young man, without pronounced\r\npersonal vices, but exceedingly obstinate and subject to spells of\r\ntemper, when strongly opposed, that gave assurance of future mental\r\nweakness. He was not, by nature, cruel, but circumstances developed\r\ngross cruelty under his régime, in India, in America, and in Ireland. He\r\nhad enough of the Stuart blood in him to be a stickler for “the right\r\ndivine” of kings, and he was enough of a Guelph to have his own way with\r\neven his most persuasive ministers. His father’s politics, so far as he\r\nhad any, leaned toward Whiggery, but after that prince’s death his\r\nmother had placed him under the tutelage of the Marquis of Bute, who was\r\nan ardent Tory. Consequently, the young king had had the advantage of\r\nbeing taught in the two great English schools of policy, but, in the\r\nlong run, the Tory in his nature prevailed over the Whig, and George III\r\nfinally developed into a fierce and intolerant despot. All that could be\r\nsaid in his favor was that, after he married—and he married young—his\r\ncourt became, at once, a model of propriety and dulness. The painted\r\nharlots, fostered by his grandfather and great-grandfather, were not\r\nsucceeded by others of their kind, and the prudent mothers of England no\r\nlonger feared to allow their handsome daughters to enter the precincts\r\nof the royal palace. The English masses were, at first, greatly\r\nastonished at the personal purity of their sovereign, but, after a\r\nwhile, became reconciled to the belief that a monarch need not,\r\nnecessarily, be a libertine.\r\n\r\nKing George evidently borrowed a leaf from the book of Queen Anne when\r\nhe assumed the crown. She had assured her subjects that hers was “an\r\nentirely English heart.” George’s first address from the throne opened\r\nwith the words, “Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name\r\nof Briton.” Coming from a king, this sentiment, addressed to a people in\r\ngeneral so fervidly “loyal” as the English, produced a most favorable\r\neffect, and, to the end of his long reign, was never forgotten, even\r\nwhen his mule-like obstinacy wellnigh goaded them to desperation. George\r\nIII, from first to last, in his love of domination, impatience of\r\nopposition, carelessness of the rights of other peoples, egotism,\r\nintolerance, and commercial greed, stood for John Bull. Behind John Bull\r\nstood England, very much as she still stands to-day. The address\r\ncontinued by declaring that the civil and religious rights of his\r\n“loving subjects” were equally dear to him with the most valuable\r\nprerogatives of the crown. It was his fixed purpose, he said, to\r\ncountenance and encourage the practice of true religion and virtue. The\r\neyes of all Europe, he declared, were on that Parliament and from it\r\n“the _Protestant_ interest hoped for protection.” At the end of the\r\nspeech, King George intimated that the toleration of the Catholics—that\r\nis, connivance at their existence, particularly in Ireland—would not be\r\ninterfered with. But the penal statutes remained unrepealed, and the\r\nIrish Catholics continued to be persecuted, although rather less\r\nbrutally, particularly as regarded their religious observances, in their\r\nown country. They were not allowed to vote, or hold office, or have any\r\nsay whatever in public affairs, although they were subject to taxes and\r\nfines. They could not be educated, and were debarred from practicing any\r\nprofession under long-established penalties. In short, they were very\r\nlittle better off during the earlier years of George III’s reign than\r\nunder the sway of his two immediate predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Protestant mind, however, did not lose its patriotic impulse,\r\nbecause of the interested silence of Malone, Boyle, and the former\r\nleaders of the Patriot party. Members of Parliament had hitherto been\r\nelected to serve during the life of the sovereign, and, in the beginning\r\nof the reign of George III, the new Irish Parliament began an earnest\r\nagitation for octennial Parliaments. Among the able men—of them destined\r\nto be famous—who were elected to the new body were Hussey Burgh, Dennis\r\nBowes Daly, Henry Flood, and Dr. Lucas. It should have been stated that\r\nthe original Irish demand was for a seven years’ Parliament, and bills\r\nwere passed, in 1761 and 1763, embodying the proposition, but the king\r\nand English Privy Council, to whom they had to be submitted, under the\r\nPoynings’ Act, coolly “pocketed” them, and they were heard of no more.\r\nThis arbitrary conduct of an alien monarch, and advisory body, aroused\r\ngreat public indignation, and the clamor became so loud, in 1767, that,\r\nfinally, the bill was returned from England, changed to octennial, or\r\neight years, and, with this amendment, it passed the Irish Parliament\r\nand received the royal sanction in February of the succeeding year.\r\nUnder the new act, a Parliament was elected in 1768, and all the\r\nadvocates of the new dispensation were re-elected. Where all did noble\r\nwork, it is not detracting from their merit to remark that Dr. Lucas was\r\nthe real leader of the movement, and was generally recognized as such.\r\nHe lived only two years after his great triumph, and was almost\r\nuniversally mourned—the only exceptions being the members of the corrupt\r\nCourt party. He was formally eulogized in the Irish House of Commons,\r\nand at his funeral the pall-bearers were Lord Kildare, Lord Charlemont,\r\nHenry Flood, Sir Lucius O’Brien, Hussey Burgh, and Speaker Ponsonby.\r\n\r\nThe Patriot party continued, in the new Parliament, under the\r\nadministration of Lord Townsend, a vigorous opposition to unjust pension\r\nlists, and other evils which afflicted the nation. The Lord Lieutenant,\r\nwho was jolly and persuasive, also corrupt, attempted to break up the\r\nopposition after the good old English fashion, but made no impression on\r\nthe able phalanx led by Flood, who, after the death of Lucas, was looked\r\nupon as the chief of the Patriot element in the Commons. Kildare,\r\nnotwithstanding his peculiar action in the days of Malone, _et al._,\r\ncontinued to champion the popular cause in the House of Peers.\r\nResistance to the supply bill, which changed the Irish military\r\nestablishment from 12,000 to 15,000 men, brought about the prorogation\r\nof Parliament session after session for nearly two years. Meanwhile, the\r\nCastle was quietly “seeing” the members, and, in spite of Flood and\r\nSpeaker Ponsonby, an address of confidence, carried by a bare majority,\r\nwas passed by the Commons. The Speaker refused to present it and\r\nresigned his post. A Mr. Perry was elected to succeed him, and, for a\r\ntime, it looked as if the Patriots might be broken up. But Mr. Perry, in\r\nspite of his suspicious conduct in accepting the speakership, vacated by\r\nhis friend, Mr. Ponsonby, remained faithful to Irish interests and the\r\nranks of the opposition became even more formidable than before.\r\n\r\nLord Townsend, the jolly old corruptionist, became so unpopular that\r\nnearly every public print in Dublin was filled with lampoons upon him,\r\nand, finally, he requested retirement and was succeeded by Lord\r\nHarcourt, in 1772. He began well, but ended badly, as is usual with\r\nEnglish viceroys in Ireland, who have seldom failed to fall eventually\r\nunder Dublin Castle influences. He attempted to throw unjust burdens on\r\nIreland, but was resisted at every point, particularly when he sought to\r\nmake the supply bill extend over two years instead of one. Henry Flood\r\ndelivered one of his best speeches in opposition to this dishonest\r\ninnovation. Hussey Burgh promised that if any member in future brought\r\nin such a bill he would move his expulsion. But the climax was reached\r\nwhen the Hon. George Ogle, of Wexford, author of the well-known lyric,\r\n“Molly Astore,” which has retained its popularity for more than a\r\ncentury, proposed that the bill, as introduced, be burned by the\r\nhangman. The Speaker reminded Mr. Ogle that the document was decorated\r\nwith the great seal. “Then,” replied the witty poet, “it will burn all\r\nthe better!” Mr. Ogle’s suggestion was not carried out, but the bill was\r\nsubsequently modified to suit the ideas of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n The Peace of Paris—Agrarian Warfare in Ireland—Judicial Murder of Father\r\n      Sheehy—All who Swore Against Him Die Violent Deaths—Societies\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Peace of Paris, 1763, brought the Seven Years’ War to a conclusion\r\non the Continent of Europe. Frederick the Great retained Silesia,\r\nformerly an Austrian province, to which he had no just title; and there\r\nwere other territorial changes of less importance. England had triumphed\r\nover the French interest in America; for Wolfe’s victory of the Plains\r\nof Abraham, at Quebec, in September, 1759, decided the game of war in\r\nfavor of the British, although other battles were fought by the opposing\r\nforces after that event.\r\n\r\nAgrarian oppression in Ireland, particularly in the South, had caused\r\nthe peasantry to organize themselves into secret societies for mutual\r\nprotection. It was thus that the famous “White Boys” of the last\r\ncentury—so-called from wearing linen shirts, or white woolen jackets,\r\nover their other clothes, so as to give them a uniform appearance—came\r\ninto existence. Their methods were crude, wild, often fierce and\r\nsometimes cruel. They defied the law because they had found no element\r\nof protection in it. Rather had they found it, as administered by the\r\nlandlord oligarchy, in whose hands it was placed by the evil genius of\r\nEngland, an instrument of intolerable oppression. No justice was to be\r\nobtained by any appeal they might make to their tyrants, and so they\r\nresorted to what an Irish orator has called “the wild justice of\r\nrevenge.” As usual, some naturally bad men found their way into these\r\norganizations, and often vented their malice on individuals in the name\r\nof the trampled people. The landlords took advantage of the commission\r\nof crime to get up another “Popish plot” scare, and succeeded in making\r\nshallow and timid people accept the slander as truth. The real object of\r\nthe “White Boys” was to secure low rentals on tillage land, and to\r\npreserve “commonage rights”—that is, grazing lands in common at a\r\nnominal cost, or else free, something that had long been the usage—for\r\ntheir stock. The landlords, not satisfied with levying exorbitant rents,\r\nand grown, if possible, harder and more greedy than ever, finally\r\nabolished and fenced in “the commons.” This action aroused the fury of\r\nthe peasantry, particularly in the Munster counties, and they collected\r\nin large bodies and demolished the landlords’ fences. This gave the\r\ntyrants an excuse to call for military aid—the argument being that the\r\npeople were in arms against “the crown,” which, of course, was false.\r\nThe poor peasantry struck at their nearest and most visible oppressors,\r\nand never thought about “the crown.” The king was, to them, very like a\r\nmyth. It would seem that many of the poorer Protestants joined with the\r\nCatholics in the demonstration against the inclosures, which, of course,\r\nshowed the absurdity of the “Popish plot” story. Still, the affair was\r\nnot to terminate until it begot a cruel tragedy. The parish priest of\r\nClogheen, County Tipperary, in 1765, was the Rev. Nicholas Sheehy, a\r\nhigh-minded and saintly man, whose heart was deeply touched by the\r\nsufferings of the poor tenants, whose ardent and eloquent champion he\r\nbecame. The Cromwellian “aristocracy” of the county, headed by the\r\nBagnals, the Maudes, the Bagwells, the Tolers, and a parson named\r\nHewitson, resolved to get rid of Father Sheehy, and only waited for a\r\ngood chance to insnare him in their toils. Two years previous to the\r\ndate already given, they had had the young priest arrested on a charge\r\nof swearing in “White Boys,” but, because of insufficient evidence, he\r\nwas acquitted. Soon after he was released, one Bridge, who had been a\r\nprincipal witness against him, mysteriously disappeared. The oligarchs\r\nhad the priest arrested immediately on a charge of murder. The witnesses\r\nemployed to appear against him were a horse-stealer, named Toohey, a\r\nvagrant youth named Lonergan, and an immoral woman, named Dunlea. He had\r\nlain in Clonmel jail, heavily ironed, for several months before he was\r\nbrought to trial. The prosecution did not have their witnesses fully\r\ninstructed. At last, March 12, 1765, Father Sheehy was brought up for\r\ntrial. He succeeded in proving an alibi, but that was of no avail. His\r\ndestruction was determined upon, and, on March 15, he suffered execution\r\nby hanging and subsequent decapitation. This atrocious murder aroused\r\nthe anger of the country. Protestants and Catholics alike joined in\r\nexecrating the crime. Yet, he was not the only victim. In May of the\r\nsame year, Edward Sheehy, a cousin, and two other young farmers, were\r\nconvicted and hanged on the same testimony that had sent Father Sheehy\r\nto his untimely grave. McGee says: “The fate of their enemies is\r\nnotorious; with a single exception, they met deaths violent, loathsome,\r\nand terrible. Maude died insane, Bagwell in idiocy; one of the jury\r\ncommitted suicide, another was found dead in a privy, a third was killed\r\nby his horse, a fourth was drowned, a fifth shot, and so through the\r\nentire list. Toohey was hanged for felony, the prostitute, Dunlea, fell\r\ninto a cellar and was killed, and the lad, Lonergan, after enlisting as\r\na soldier, died of a loathsome disease in a Dublin infirmary.”\r\n\r\nAnother attempt at persecution of the priests was made in 1767, but\r\nEdmund Burke, the illustrious statesman, and other liberal Protestants,\r\ncame to the rescue with funds for the defence of the accused, and the\r\noligarchy were unable to secure the conviction of their intended\r\nvictims. The fate of the perjured informers, who swore away the lives of\r\nFather Sheehy and his fellow-sufferers, was well known throughout the\r\ncountry, and, no doubt, had a wholesome effect on other wretches who\r\nmight have been bribed into following their example.\r\n\r\nThe “White Boys” were not the only secret organization formed in Ireland\r\nat that period. Some were composed of Protestants, mostly of the\r\nPresbyterian sect, who combated in Ulster the exactions of the\r\nlandlords. They bore such names as “Hearts of Steel,” because they were\r\nsupposed to show no mercy to “the petty tyrants of their fields”; “Oak\r\nBoys,” because they carried oaken boughs, or wore oak leaves in their\r\nhats. The “Peep o’ Day Boys” were political rather than agrarian, and\r\nprofessed the peculiar principles afterward adopted by the Orange\r\nAssociation. They confined themselves mainly to keeping up the\r\nanniversary of the Boyne and making occasional brutal attacks on\r\ndefenceless Catholics. The respectable Protestant element kept\r\nscrupulously away from association with these rude fanatics. The\r\nsuccessors of the “White Boys” in Munster were the equally dreaded\r\n“Terry Alts,” who existed down to a very recent period, and belonged,\r\nmainly, to the County Tipperary. Like the “White Boys,” they raided the\r\nhouses of “the gentry” and their retainers for arms, and severe, often\r\nfatal, conflicts resulted from their midnight visitations. They also\r\nkilled, from time to time, obnoxious landlords and their agents, and\r\nwere hanged by the score in retaliation. The government was not\r\nover-particular regarding their guilt or innocence. The object was to\r\navenge the slain land-grabbers, and also to “strike terror.” As usual,\r\nmany base informers were found to betray their fellows, but, in justice\r\nto the “White Boys” and “Terry Alts,” it may be stated that the\r\nbetrayers of their secrets were mostly Castle spies, or detectives,\r\nemployed for the purpose of entrapping the unwary. Very few of the\r\nregular members, who lived among their own relatives, accepted blood\r\nmoney. In many cases, the peasantry committed unnecessary acts of\r\nviolence, but, in general, they only visited with severe punishment\r\nlandlords or their agents who were notorious evictors, or farmers who\r\n“took the land” over the heads of the evicted tenants.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Church was the consistent opponent of the agrarian\r\norganizations, because of the mutual bloodshed between them and the\r\nlandlord element, but, much as the Catholic peasants held their bishops\r\nand priests in reverence, the admonitions of the latter had small effect\r\non the young men of their flocks while wholesale evictions were in\r\nprogress. The “boys,” with rough logic, would say, among themselves:\r\n“The clergy mean well, but we had better be hanged than starved to\r\ndeath, and, besides, revenge on our tyrants is sweet.” There is hardly\r\nanything in Old World history more ghastly than the long, desultory, and\r\ndeadly war of tenant against landlord in Ireland, from the days of\r\nGeorge II to the latter part of Victoria’s reign. It is a chapter we\r\ngladly turn away from, with the remark that the cruel oligarchy, who\r\nwantonly provoked a naturally humane people to crime, were infinitely\r\nmore criminal than the poor, oppressed peasants they made desperate.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n     Flood and Grattan—Sudden Rise of the Latter—Speaks for a Free\r\n     Commerce—The Volunteer Movement—England Yields to Irish Demand\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was unfortunate for both America and Ireland that Henry Grattan, who\r\nhad entered Parliament in December, 1775, had not attained to the\r\nleadership of the Patriot party when the colonies revolted against the\r\ntyranny of George III. Flood held that position when hostilities\r\nappeared imminent, and his influence, somewhat ignorantly exerted, had\r\nmuch to do with voting 4,000 troops from the Irish establishment for\r\nservice against the Americans. At the time, the American case was not as\r\nwell understood in Ireland as it was later on, and, besides, an\r\naccommodation was hoped for. In the course of his speech supporting the\r\npolicy of the government, Flood said that the troops from Ireland were\r\n“armed negotiators”—a most unfortunate phrase, which Grattan, in after\r\ndays, turned against him to good effect, when he uttered that fierce\r\nphilippic against his quondam friend during an acrimonious debate which\r\narose soon after the Irish Parliamentary triumph over England in 1782.\r\nIt must be remembered by American readers that the Irish Parliament\r\nwhich voted men to put down the American revolutionists was Protestant\r\nin creed and mainly English in blood. Not a Catholic sat in it, and but\r\nfew men of Celtic origin. The sympathies of the Catholic and dissenting\r\nmasses were unmistakably with the Americans, and Grattan in the Irish\r\nLegislature, and Burke and Brinsley Sheridan in the English House of\r\nCommons, were their eloquent champions. Flood, although a man of fine\r\nintellect and an accomplished orator, soon found himself rather\r\noutclassed by Grattan, who was young, ardent, and animated by a\r\n“pentecostal fire,” which prompted him to utter some of the most\r\ninspiring speeches that ever flowed from the lips of man. Flood,\r\nfollowing the example of Malone at another period, had accepted office\r\nunder the Harcourt administration, and it was openly charged by his\r\nenemies, and probably with some degree of truth, that he had been\r\ninfluenced in his action against America by the circumstance. He had\r\nalso supported the embargo measure, imposed by order in council, which\r\ndebarred Irish food products from exportation to the American colonies\r\nin revolt. Naturally, conduct of this kind produced dissatisfaction\r\namong his friends and followers, and his popularity immediately\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\nThe decline of Flood as a Patriot leader left a free field for Grattan\r\nand his best-known competitors for oratorical honors, Hussey Burgh,\r\nBowes Daly, and Yelverton. At first, Grattan was rather chary of speech\r\nin the House, but, gradually, he gained confidence in himself, and,\r\nalthough his gestures were awkward and his elocution generally faulty,\r\nthe matter of his addresses was so full of fire, energy, and logic that\r\nhe soon became the acknowledged chief of what Byron happily termed in\r\nhis “Irish Avatar” the eloquent war. The restrictions on Irish commerce\r\ndemanded his first attention, and his earlier utterances in Parliament\r\nwere mostly devoted to that question. It has been erroneously stated\r\nthat Henry Grattan was a “free trader” in the American and British sense\r\nof that term. On the contrary, he believed in a moderate tariff for the\r\nprotection of Irish industries, and also for the accumulation of a\r\nrevenue, and this was fully exemplified by the action of the Irish\r\nParliament, when, from 1782 to 1800, it became virtually independent, in\r\nenacting tariff laws for the objects stated. It is true the tariff in\r\nregard to English imports was comparatively low, but still high enough\r\nto give the Irish manufacturer a good chance to compete with the\r\nmanufactures of the richer country. What Grattan and his followers\r\nwanted was free commerce—an exemption from the export duties, which\r\ncrippled Irish merchants; and freedom to export Irish goods, without\r\nhindrance from English customs officers, to any country of the world.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the battle of Saratoga and surrender of Burgoyne to the\r\nAmerican army reached Ireland, in 1777, it produced a profound\r\nimpression. Grattan, who always favored the American cause, moved an\r\naddress to the throne in favor of retrenchment, which meant reduction of\r\nthe military establishment, while Bowes Daly moved, and had carried,\r\nanother address, which deplored the continuance of the American war, but\r\nprofessed fidelity to the royal person. As usual, when England got the\r\nworst of it abroad, small concessions were made to the Irish Catholics,\r\nand the Irish Parliament was permitted to pass a bill “authorizing\r\nPapists to loan money on mortgages, to lease lands for any period not\r\nexceeding 999 years, and to inherit and bequeath real property.” This\r\nbill had “a rider” which abolished the test oath as regarded the\r\nDissenters, and, no doubt, this provision had much to do with the\r\nsuccess of the bill as a whole, which did not, however, pass without\r\nstrenuous opposition.\r\n\r\nAn attempt made by Lord Nugent in the English Parliament to mitigate the\r\nseverity of the navigation and embargo acts, as regarded Ireland, was\r\nhowled down by the English manufacturers, merchants, and tradespeople\r\ngenerally. The knowledge of this action spurred on Grattan and his\r\nfollowers and, thenceforward, “Free Trade” became their rallying cry.\r\n\r\nProtestant Ireland, since the year of Thurot’s bold exploit, had lived\r\nin much terror of another French invasion, on a larger scale. When\r\nFrance, in 1778, became the ally of the United States of America, which\r\nhad declared their independence on July 4, 1776, this feeling of alarm\r\nincreased. Their leaders demanded military protection from the\r\ngovernment, and were informed that the latter had none to give, unless\r\nthey would accept invalids and dismounted cavalrymen. Henry Flood,\r\nseconded by Speaker Perry, had long advocated the formation of a\r\nnational militia, and these gentlemen were cordially supported in the\r\nproposition by Grattan, Lord Charlemont, and other noted leaders of the\r\nPatriot party. A bill authorizing a volunteer militia passed the Irish\r\nParliament in 1778. After a great deal of discussion, it was deemed more\r\nprudent to form the force from independent organizations of volunteers,\r\narmed by the state, but clothed and otherwise equipped by themselves.\r\nThey were left free to elect their own officers. Immediately, a\r\npatriotic impulse permeated the nation, and the Protestant Irish, who\r\nwere alone permitted to bear arms, rallied to the armories and\r\nparade-grounds by the thousand. Belfast and Strabane claimed the honor\r\nof having formed the first companies. The richer among the Catholics\r\nsupplied money to the poor among their Protestant neighbors for the\r\npurchase of uniforms and other necessaries. This patriotic action on\r\ntheir part naturally resulted in an immediate mitigation of the penal\r\ndiscrimination against them and the entrance of hundreds of them into\r\nthe ranks of the volunteers was, at first, connived at, and soon openly\r\npermitted. The result was that, by the spring of 1780, there were, at\r\nleast, 65,000 men under arms for Ireland in her four provinces—Ulster\r\nleading in numbers and enthusiasm. The rank and file were artisans,\r\nfarmers, and clerks, while the officers were, in general, selected from\r\namong the wealthy and aristocratic classes. Many of these officers\r\nequipped their companies, or regiments, at their own expense. The Earl\r\nof Charlemont—a weak but well-meaning nobleman—was elected commander by\r\nthe Ulster volunteers, while the amiable Duke of Leinster—the second of\r\nthat proud title—was chosen by those of Leinster. Munster and Connaught,\r\nnot being quite as well organized as their sister provinces, deferred\r\ntheir selections. All English goods were tabooed by the volunteers,\r\ntheir families, and friends, and a favorite maxim of the period was that\r\nof Dean Swift, already quoted, “Burn everything coming from England,\r\nexcept the coal!”\r\n\r\nThe now feeble shadow of English government, holding court at Dublin\r\nCastle, viewed this formidable uprising with genuine alarm, and did its\r\nutmost to prevent the issuance of arms to the volunteers, but the Irish\r\nleaders were not to be cajoled or baffled, and, in the summer of 1779,\r\nthe new Irish army was thoroughly armed, drilled and ready for any\r\nservice that might be demanded from it. The leaders had now the weapon\r\nto enforce their rights in hand, and did not fail to make good use of\r\nit. They met and formed plans for the coming session of Parliament, and\r\nwere delighted to receive assurances from Flood, and other\r\nofficeholders, that they would support Grattan and his allies in the\r\ndemand that Irish commerce have “free export and import.”\r\n\r\nAn address, covering the points stated, with the amendment “free trade”\r\nsubstituted by Flood for the original phrase, passed the Houses, when\r\nthey met, and on the succeeding day the House of Commons, with the\r\nSpeaker at its head, proceeded to the Castle and presented the address\r\nto the viceroy. The volunteers, commanded by the Duke of Leinster,\r\noccupied both sides of the streets through which the members had to pass\r\nand presented arms to the nation’s representatives, many of whom wore\r\nthe diversified uniforms of the Patriot army. Dublin, in all its varied\r\nhistory, never witnessed a grander or more inspiring spectacle.\r\n\r\nAlderman Horan, of Dublin, precipitated a crisis by demanding freedom of\r\nexport for some Irish woolens to Amsterdam, and he filed his demand, in\r\ndue form, at the custom house. This was in defiance of the prohibitory\r\nenactment of the reign of William III and an English man-of-war was\r\nstationed in Dublin Bay to enforce it. Mr. Horan, not being provided\r\nwith a battleship, was fain to content himself with leaving his demand\r\non file, but he had gained his point by directing public attention to an\r\ninsulting grievance with a stern object lesson. Ireland saw, at once,\r\nthat English monopoly would yield nothing, except to force, or the\r\nthreat of force. Henry Grattan, in the Commons, replied to the shotted\r\nguns of the English frigate in the bay by introducing an amendment to\r\nthe supply bill, which declared that “at this time, it is inexpedient to\r\ngrant new taxes.” This was carried overwhelmingly, and England began to\r\nthink that, after all, Irish votes were a match for English guns.\r\nGrattan gained a further triumph over the government by causing the\r\ndefeat of a bill providing duties for the support of the loan fund.\r\n\r\nLord North, when confronted with the ominous news from Ireland,\r\nremembering his unfortunate experience with the American patriots,\r\ndetermined to back down from his former despotic position. He brought in\r\nresolutions which gave Ireland the right to trade with British colonies\r\nin America and Africa, and granted free export to glass and woolens. The\r\nIrish Parliament adopted similar resolutions, and the main portion of\r\nIreland’s commercial grievances was, thereby, removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           END OF VOLUME ONE\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ● Transcriber’s Notes:\r\n    ○ Missing or obscured punctuation was silently corrected.\r\n    ○ Typographical errors were silently corrected.\r\n    ○ Inconsistent spelling and hyphenation were made consistent only\r\n      when a predominant form was found in this book.\r\n    ○ Text that:\r\n      was in italics is enclosed by underscores (_italics_).",
