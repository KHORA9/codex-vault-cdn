Although the continued discussion of the political rights\r\nof woman during the last thirty years, forms a most important link in\r\nthe chain of influences tending to her emancipation, no attempt at its\r\nhistory has been made. In giving the inception and progress of this\r\nagitation, we who have undertaken the task have been moved by the\r\nconsideration that many of oar co-workers have already fallen asleep,\r\nand that in a few years all who could tell the story will have passed\r\naway.\r\n\r\nIn collecting material for these volumes, most of those of whom we\r\nsolicited facts have expressed themselves deeply interested in our\r\nundertaking, and have gladly contributed all they could, feeling that\r\nthose identified with this reform were better qualified to prepare a\r\nfaithful history with greater patience and pleasure, than those of\r\nanother generation possibly could.\r\n\r\nA few have replied, \"It is too early to write the history of this\r\nmovement; wait until our object is attained; the actors themselves can\r\nnot write an impartial history; they have had their discords,\r\ndivisions, personal hostilities, that unfit them for the work.\"\r\nViewing the enfranchisement of woman as the most important demand of\r\nthe century, we have felt no temptation to linger over individual\r\ndifferences. These occur in all associations, and may be regarded in\r\nthis case as an evidence of the growing self-assertion and\r\nindividualism in woman.\r\n\r\nWoven with the threads of this history, we have given some personal\r\nreminiscences and brief biographical sketches. To the few who, through\r\nill-timed humility, have refused to contribute any of their early\r\nexperiences we would suggest, that as each brick in a magnificent\r\nstructure might have had no special value alone on the road-side, yet,\r\nin combination with many others, its size, position, quality, becomes\r\nof vital consequence; so with the actors in any great reform, though\r\nthey may be of little value in themselves; as a part of a great\r\nmovement they may be worthy of mention--even important to the\r\ncompletion of an historical record.\r\n\r\nTo be historians of a reform in which we have been among the chief\r\nactors, has its points of embarrassment as well as advantage. Those\r\nwho fight the battle can best give what all readers like to know--the\r\nimpelling motives to action; the struggle in the face of opposition;\r\nthe vexation under ridicule; and the despair in success too long\r\ndeferred. Moreover, there is an interest in history written from a\r\nsubjective point of view, that may compensate the reader in this case\r\nfor any seeming egotism or partiality he may discover. As an\r\nautobiography is more interesting than a sketch by another, so is a\r\nhistory written by its actors, as in both cases we get nearer the soul\r\nof the subject.\r\n\r\nWe have finished our task, and we hope the contribution we have made\r\nmay enable some other hand in the future to write a more complete\r\nhistory of \"the most momentous reform that has yet been launched on\r\nthe world--the first organized protest against the injustice which has\r\nbrooded over the character and destiny of one-half the human race.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  PRECEDING CAUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  WOMAN IN NEWSPAPERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  THE WORLD'S ANTI-SLAVERY CONVENTION, LONDON, JUNE 13, 1840.\r\n\r\n  Individualism rather than Authority--Personal appearance of\r\n  Abolitionists--Attempt to silence Woman--Doable battle against the\r\n  tyranny of sex and color--Bigoted Abolitionists--James G.

A\r\nsurvey of the condition of the race through those barbarous periods,\r\nwhen physical force governed the world, when the motto, \"might makes\r\nright,\" was the law, enables one to account, for the origin of woman's\r\nsubjection to man without referring the fact to the general\r\ninferiority of the sex, or Nature's law.\r\n\r\nWriters on this question differ as to the cause of the universal\r\ndegradation of woman in all periods and nations.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest minds of the century has thrown a ray of light on\r\nthis gloomy picture by tracing the origin of woman's slavery to the\r\nsame principle of selfishness and love of power in man that has thus\r\nfar dominated all weaker nations and classes. This brings hope of\r\nfinal emancipation, for as all nations and classes are gradually, one\r\nafter another, asserting and maintaining their independence, the path\r\nis clear for woman to follow. The slavish instinct of an oppressed\r\nclass has led her to toil patiently through the ages, giving all and\r\nasking little, cheerfully sharing with man all perils and privations\r\nby land and sea, that husband and sons might attain honor and success.\r\nJustice and freedom for herself is her latest and highest demand.\r\n\r\nAnother writer asserts that the tyranny of man over woman has its\r\nroots, after all, in his nobler feelings; his love, his chivalry, and\r\nhis desire to protect woman in the barbarous periods of pillage, lust,\r\nand war. But wherever the roots may be traced, the results at this\r\nhour are equally disastrous to woman. Her best interests and happiness\r\ndo not seem to have been consulted in the arrangements made for her\r\nprotection. She has been bought and sold, caressed and crucified at\r\nthe will and pleasure of her master. But if a chivalrous desire to\r\nprotect woman has always been the mainspring of man's dominion over\r\nher, it should have prompted him to place in her hands the same\r\nweapons of defense he has found to be most effective against wrong and\r\noppression.\r\n\r\nIt is often asserted that as woman has always been man's\r\nslave--subject--inferior--dependent, under all forms of government and\r\nreligion, slavery must be her normal condition. This might have some\r\nweight had not the vast majority of men also been enslaved for\r\ncenturies to kings and popes, and orders of nobility, who, in the\r\nprogress of civilization, have reached complete equality. And did we\r\nnot also see the great changes in woman's condition, the marvelous\r\ntransformation in her character, from a toy in the Turkish harem, or a\r\ndrudge in the German fields, to a leader of thought in the literary\r\ncircles of France, England, and America!\r\n\r\nIn an age when the wrongs of society are adjusted in the courts and at\r\nthe ballot-box, material force yields to reason and majorities.\r\n\r\nWoman's steady march onward, and her growing desire for a broader\r\noutlook, prove that she has not reached her normal condition, and that\r\nsociety has not yet conceded all that is necessary for its attainment.\r\n\r\nMoreover, woman's discontent increases in exact proportion to her\r\ndevelopment. Instead of a feeling of gratitude for rights accorded,\r\nthe wisest are indignant at the assumption of any legal disability\r\nbased on sex, and their feelings in this matter are a surer test of\r\nwhat her nature demands, than the feelings and prejudices of the sex\r\nclaiming to be superior. American men may quiet their consciences with\r\nthe delusion that no such injustice exists in this country as in\r\nEastern nations, though with the general improvement in our\r\ninstitutions, woman's condition must inevitably have improved also,\r\nyet the same principle that degrades her in Turkey, insults her in\r\nthis republic. Custom forbids a woman there to enter a mosque, or call\r\nthe hour for prayers; here it forbids her a voice in Church Councils\r\nor State Legislatures. The same taint of her primitive state of\r\nslavery affects both latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe condition of married women, under the laws of all countries, has\r\nbeen essentially that of slaves, until modified, in some respects,\r\nwithin the last quarter of a century in the United States. The change\r\nfrom the old Common Law of England, in regard to the civil rights of\r\nwomen, from 1848 to the advance legislation in most of the Northern\r\nStates in 1880, marks an era both in the status of woman as a citizen\r\nand in our American system of jurisprudence. When the State of New\r\nYork gave married women certain rights of property, the individual\r\nexistence of the wife was recognized, and the old idea that \"husband\r\nand wife are one, and that one the husband,\" received its death-blow.\r\nFrom that hour the statutes of the several States have been steadily\r\ndiverging from the old English codes. Most of the Western States\r\ncopied the advance legislation of New York, and some are now even more\r\nliberal.\r\n\r\nThe broader demand for political rights has not commanded the thought\r\nits merits and dignity should have secured. While complaining of many\r\nwrongs and oppressions, women themselves did not see that the\r\npolitical disability of sex was the cause of all their special\r\ngrievances, and that to secure equality anywhere, it must be\r\nrecognized everywhere. Like all disfranchised classes, they begun by\r\nasking to have certain wrongs redressed, and not by asserting their\r\nown right to make laws for themselves.\r\n\r\nOverburdened with cares in the isolated home, women had not the time,\r\neducation, opportunity, and pecuniary independence to put their\r\nthoughts clearly and concisely into propositions, nor the courage to\r\ncompare their opinions with one another, nor to publish them, to any\r\ngreat extent, to the world.\r\n\r\nIt requires philosophy and heroism to rise above the opinion of the\r\nwise men of all nations and races, that to be unknown, is the highest\r\ntestimonial woman can have to her virtue, delicacy and refinement.\r\n\r\nA certain odium has ever rested on those who have risen above the\r\nconventional level and sought new spheres for thought and action, and\r\nespecially on the few who demand complete equality in political\r\nrights. The leaders in this movement have been women of superior\r\nmental and physical organization, of good social standing and\r\neducation, remarkable alike for their domestic virtues, knowledge of\r\npublic affairs, and rare executive ability; good speakers and writers,\r\ninspiring and conducting the genuine reforms of the day; everywhere\r\nexerting themselves to promote the best interests of society; yet they\r\nhave been uniformly ridiculed, misrepresented, and denounced in public\r\nand private by all classes of society.\r\n\r\nWoman's political equality with man is the legitimate outgrowth of the\r\nfundamental principles of our Government, clearly set forth in the\r\nDeclaration of Independence in 1776, in the United States Constitution\r\nadopted in 1784, in the prolonged debates on the origin of human\r\nrights in the anti-slavery conflict in 1840, and in the more recent\r\ndiscussions of the party in power since 1865, on the 13th, 14th, and\r\n15th Amendments to the National Constitution; and the majority of our\r\nleading statesmen have taken the ground that suffrage is a natural\r\nright that may be regulated, but can not be abolished by State law.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of these liberal principles of republicanism that\r\npervades all classes of American minds, however vaguely, if suddenly\r\ncalled out, they might be stated, woman readily perceives the\r\nanomalous position she occupies in a republic, where the government\r\nand religion alike are based on individual conscience and\r\njudgment--where the natural rights of all citizens have been\r\nexhaustively discussed, and repeatedly declared equal.\r\n\r\nFrom the inauguration of the government, representative women have\r\nexpostulated against the inconsistencies between our principles and\r\npractices as a nation. Beginning with special grievances, woman's\r\nprotests soon took a larger scope. Having petitioned State\r\nlegislatures to change the statutes that robbed her of children,\r\nwages, and property, she demanded that the Constitutions--State and\r\nNational--be so amended as to give her a voice in the laws, a choice\r\nin the rulers, and protection in the exercise of her rights as a\r\ncitizen of the United States.\r\n\r\nWhile the laws affecting woman's civil rights have been greatly\r\nimproved during the past thirty years, the political demand has made\r\nbut a questionable progress, though it must be counted as the chief\r\ninfluence in modifying the laws. The selfishness of man was readily\r\nenlisted in securing woman's civil rights, while the same element in\r\nhis character antagonized her demand for political equality.\r\n\r\nFathers who had estates to bequeath to their daughters could see the\r\nadvantage of securing to woman certain property rights that might\r\nlimit the legal power of profligate husbands.\r\n\r\nHusbands in extensive business operations could see the advantage of\r\nallowing the wife the right to hold separate property, settled on her\r\nin time of prosperity, that might not be seized for his debts. Hence\r\nin the several States able men championed these early measures. But\r\npolitical rights, involving in their last results equality everywhere,\r\nroused all the antagonism of a dominant power, against the\r\nself-assertion of a class hitherto subservient. Men saw that with\r\npolitical equality for woman, they could no longer keep her in social\r\nsubordination, and \"the majority of the male sex,\" says John Stuart\r\nMill, \"can not yet tolerate the idea of living with an equal.\" The\r\nfear of a social revolution thus complicated the discussion. The\r\nChurch, too, took alarm, knowing that with the freedom and education\r\nacquired in becoming a component part of the Government, woman would\r\nnot only outgrow the power of the priesthood, and religious\r\nsuperstitions, but would also invade the pulpit, interpret the Bible\r\nanew from her own stand-point, and claim an equal voice in all\r\necclesiastical councils. With fierce warnings and denunciations from\r\nthe pulpit, and false interpretations of Scripture, women have been\r\nintimidated and misled, and their religious feelings have been played\r\nupon for their more complete subjugation. While the general principles\r\nof the Bible are in favor of the most enlarged freedom and equality of\r\nthe race, isolated texts have been used to block the wheels of\r\nprogress in all periods; thus bigots have defended capital punishment,\r\nintemperance, slavery, polygamy, and the subjection of woman. The\r\ncreeds of all nations make obedience to man the corner-stone of her\r\nreligious character. Fortunately, however, more liberal minds are now\r\ngiving us higher and purer expositions of the Scriptures.\r\n\r\nAs the social and religious objections appeared against the demand for\r\npolitical rights, the discussion became many-sided, contradictory, and\r\nas varied as the idiosyncrasies of individual character. Some said,\r\n\"Man is woman's natural protector, and she can safely trust him to\r\nmake laws for her.\" She might with fairness reply, as he uniformly\r\nrobbed her of all property rights to 1848, he can not safely be\r\ntrusted with her personal rights in 1880, though the fact that he did\r\nmake some restitution at last, might modify her distrust in the\r\nfuture. However, the calendars of our courts still show that fathers\r\ndeal unjustly with daughters, husbands with wives, brothers with\r\nsisters, and sons with their own mothers. Though woman needs the\r\nprotection of one man against his whole sex, in pioneer life, in\r\nthreading her way through a lonely forest, on the highway, or in the\r\nstreets of the metropolis on a dark night, she sometimes needs, too,\r\nthe protection of all men against this one. But even if she could be\r\nsure, as she is not, of the ever-present, all-protecting power of one\r\nstrong arm, that would be weak indeed compared with the subtle,\r\nall-pervading influence of just and equal laws for all women. Hence\r\nwoman's need of the ballot, that she may hold in her own right hand\r\nthe weapon of self-protection and self-defense.\r\n\r\nAgain it is said: \"The women who make the demand are few in number,\r\nand their feelings and opinions are abnormal, and therefore of no\r\nweight in considering the aggregate judgment on the question.\" The\r\nnumber is larger than appears on the surface, for the fear of public\r\nridicule, and the loss of private favors from those who shelter, feed,\r\nand clothe them, withhold many from declaring their opinions and\r\ndemanding their rights. The ignorance and indifference of the majority\r\nof women, as to their status as citizens of a republic, is not\r\nremarkable, for history shows that the masses of all oppressed\r\nclasses, in the most degraded conditions, have been stolid and\r\napathetic until partial success had crowned the faith and enthusiasm\r\nof the few.\r\n\r\nThe insurrections on Southern plantations were always defeated by the\r\ndoubt and duplicity of the slaves themselves. That little band of\r\nheroes who precipitated the American Revolution in 1776 were so\r\nostracised that they walked the streets with bowed heads, from a sense\r\nof loneliness and apprehension. Woman's apathy to the wrongs of her\r\nsex, instead of being a plea for her remaining in her present\r\ncondition, is the strongest argument against it. How completely\r\ndemoralized by her subjection must she be, who does not feel her\r\npersonal dignity assailed when all women are ranked in every State\r\nConstitution with idiots, lunatics, criminals, and minors; when in the\r\nname of Justice, man holds one scale for woman, another for himself;\r\nwhen by the spirit and letter of the laws she is made responsible for\r\ncrimes committed against her, while the male criminal goes free; when\r\nfrom altars where she worships no woman may preach; when in the\r\ncourts, where girls of tender age may be arraigned for the crime of\r\ninfanticide, she may not plead for the most miserable of her sex; when\r\ncolleges she is taxed to build and endow, deny her the right to share\r\nin their advantages; when she finds that which should be her\r\nglory--her possible motherhood--treated everywhere by man as a\r\ndisability and a crime! A woman insensible to such indignities needs\r\nsome transformation into nobler thought, some purer atmosphere to\r\nbreathe, some higher stand-point from which to study human rights.\r\n\r\nIt is said, \"the difference between the sexes indicates different\r\nspheres.\" It would be nearer the truth to say the difference indicates\r\ndifferent duties in the same sphere, seeing that man and woman were\r\nevidently made for each other, and have shown equal capacity in the\r\nordinary range of human duties. In governing nations, leading armies,\r\npiloting ships across the sea, rowing life-boats in terrific gales; in\r\nart, science, invention, literature, woman has proved herself the\r\ncomplement of man in the world of thought and action. This difference\r\ndoes not compel us to spread our tables with different food for man\r\nand woman, nor to provide in our common schools a different course of\r\nstudy for boys and girls. Sex pervades all nature, yet the male and\r\nfemale tree and vine and shrub rejoice in the same sunshine and shade.\r\nThe earth and air are free to all the fruits and flowers, yet each\r\nabsorbs what best ensures its growth. But whatever it is, it requires\r\nno special watchfulness on our part to see that it is maintained. This\r\nplea, when closely analyzed, is generally found to mean woman's\r\ninferiority.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of man, however, does not enter into the demand for\r\nsuffrage, for in this country all men vote; and as the lower orders of\r\nmen are not superior, either by nature or grace, to the higher orders\r\nof women, they must hold and exercise the right of self-government on\r\nsome other ground than superiority to women.\r\n\r\nAgain it is said, \"Woman when independent and self-asserting will lose\r\nher influence over man.\" In the happiest conditions in life, men and\r\nwomen will ever be mutually dependent on each other. The complete\r\ndevelopment of all woman's powers will not make her less capable of\r\nsteadfast love and friendship, but give her new strength to meet the\r\nemergencies of life, to aid those who look to her for counsel and\r\nsupport. Men are uniformly more attentive to women of rank, family,\r\nand fortune, who least need their care, than to any other class. We do\r\nnot see their protecting love generally extending to the helpless and\r\nunfortunate ones of earth. Wherever the skilled hands and cultured\r\nbrain of woman have made the battle of life easier for man, he has\r\nreadily pardoned her sound judgment and proper self-assertion. But the\r\nprejudices and preferences of man should be a secondary consideration,\r\nin presence of the individual happiness and freedom of woman. The\r\nformation of her character and its influence on the human race, is a\r\nlarger question than man's personal liking. There is no fear, however,\r\nthat when a superior order of women shall grace the earth, there will\r\nnot be an order of men to match them, and influence over such minds\r\nwill atone for the loss of it elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAn honest fear is sometimes expressed \"that woman would degrade\r\npolitics, and politics would degrade woman.\" As the influence of woman\r\nhas been uniformly elevating in new civilizations, in missionary work\r\nin heathen nations, in schools, colleges, literature, and in general\r\nsociety, it is fair to suppose that politics would prove no exception.\r\nOn the other hand, as the art of government is the most exalted of all\r\nsciences, and statesmanship requires the highest order of mind, the\r\nennobling and refining influence of such pursuits must elevate rather\r\nthan degrade woman. When politics degenerate into bitter persecutions\r\nand vulgar court-gossip, they are degrading to man, and his honor,\r\nvirtue, dignity, and refinement are as valuable to woman as her\r\nvirtues, are to him.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is said, \"Those who make laws must execute them; government\r\nneeds force behind it,--a woman could not be sheriff or a policeman.\"\r\nShe might not fill these offices in the way men do, but she might far\r\nmore effectively guard the morals of society, and the sanitary\r\nconditions of our cities. It might with equal force be said that a\r\nwoman of culture and artistic taste can not keep house, because she\r\ncan not wash and iron with her own hands, and clean the range and\r\nfurnace. At the head of the police, a woman could direct her forces\r\nand keep order without ever using a baton or a pistol in her own\r\nhands. \"The elements of sovereignty,\" says Blackstone, \"are three:\r\nwisdom, goodness, and power.\" Conceding to woman wisdom and goodness,\r\nas they are not strictly masculine virtues, and substituting moral\r\npower for physical force, we have the necessary elements of government\r\nfor most of life's emergencies. Women manage families, mixed schools,\r\ncharitable institutions, large boarding-houses and hotels, farms and\r\nsteam-engines, drunken and disorderly men and women, and stop street\r\nfights, as well as men do. The queens in history compare favorably\r\nwith the kings.\r\n\r\nBut, \"in the settlement of national difficulties,\" it is said, \"the\r\nlast resort is war; shall we summon our wives and mothers to the\r\nbattle-field?\" Women have led armies in all ages, have held positions\r\nin the army and navy for years in disguise. Some fought, bled, and\r\ndied on the battle-field in our late war. They performed severe labors\r\nin the hospitals and sanitary department. Wisdom would dictate a\r\ndivision of labor in war as well as in peace, assigning each their\r\nappropriate department.\r\n\r\nNumerous classes of men who enjoy their political rights are exempt\r\nfrom military duty. All men over forty-five, all who suffer mental or\r\nphysical disability, such as the loss of an eye or a forefinger;\r\nclergymen, physicians, Quakers, school-teachers, professors, and\r\npresidents of colleges, judges, legislators, congressmen, State prison\r\nofficials, and all county, State and National officers; fathers,\r\nbrothers, or sons having certain relatives dependent on them for\r\nsupport,--all of these summed up in every State in the Union make\r\nmillions of voters thus exempted.\r\n\r\nIn view of this fact there is no force in the plea, that \"if women\r\nvote they must fight.\" Moreover, war is not the normal state of the\r\nhuman family in its higher development, but merely a feature of\r\nbarbarism lasting on through the transition of the race, from the\r\nsavage to the scholar. When England and America settled the Alabama\r\nClaims by the Geneva Arbitration, they pointed the way for the future\r\nadjustment of all national difficulties.\r\n\r\nSome fear, \"If women assume all the duties political equality implies,\r\nthat the time and attention necessary to the duties of home life will\r\nbe absorbed in the affairs of State.\" The act of voting occupies but\r\nlittle time in itself, and the vast majority of women will attend to\r\ntheir family and social affairs to the neglect of the State, just as\r\nmen do to their individual interests. The virtue of patriotism is\r\nsubordinate in most souls to individual and family aggrandizement. As\r\nto offices, it is not to be supposed that the class of men now\r\nelected will resign to women their chances, and if they should to any\r\nextent, the necessary number of women to fill the offices would make\r\nno apparent change in our social circles. If, for example, the Senate\r\nof the United States should be entirely composed of women, but two in\r\neach State would be withdrawn from the pursuit of domestic happiness.\r\nFor many reasons, under all circumstances, a comparatively smaller\r\nproportion of women than men would actively engage in politics.\r\n\r\nAs the power to extend or limit the suffrage rests now wholly in the\r\nhands of man, he can commence the experiment with as small a number as\r\nhe sees fit, by requiring any lawful qualification. Men were admitted\r\non property and educational qualifications in most of the States, at\r\none time, and still are in some--so hard has it been for man to\r\nunderstand the theory of self-government. Three-fourths of the women\r\nwould be thus disqualified, and the remaining fourth would be too\r\nsmall a minority to precipitate a social revolution or defeat\r\nmasculine measures in the halls of legislation, even if women were a\r\nunit on all questions and invariably voted together, which they would\r\nnot. In this view, the path of duty is plain for the prompt action of\r\nthose gentlemen who fear universal suffrage for women, but are willing\r\nto grant it on property and educational qualifications. While those\r\nwho are governed by the law of expediency should give the measure of\r\njustice they deem safe, let those who trust the absolute right\r\nproclaim the higher principle in government, \"equal rights to all.\"\r\n\r\nMany seeming obstacles in the way of woman's enfranchisement will be\r\nsurmounted by reforms in many directions. Co-operative labor and\r\nco-operative homes will remove many difficulties in the way of woman's\r\nsuccess as artisan and housekeeper, when admitted to the governing\r\npower. The varied forms of progress, like parallel lines, move forward\r\nsimultaneously in the same direction. Each reform, at its inception,\r\nseems out of joint with all its surroundings; but the discussion\r\nchanges the conditions, and brings them in line with the new idea.\r\n\r\nThe isolated household is responsible for a large share of woman's\r\nignorance and degradation. A mind always in contact with children and\r\nservants, whose aspirations and ambitions rise no higher than the roof\r\nthat shelters it, is necessarily dwarfed in its proportions. The\r\nadvantages to the few whose fortunes enable them to make the isolated\r\nhousehold a more successful experiment, can not outweigh the\r\ndifficulties of the many who are wholly sacrificed to its\r\nmaintenance.\r\n\r\nQuite as many false ideas prevail as to woman's true position in the\r\nhome as to her status elsewhere. Womanhood is the great fact in her\r\nlife; wifehood and motherhood are but incidental relations.\r\nGovernments legislate for men; we do not have one code for bachelors,\r\nanother for husbands and fathers; neither have the social relations of\r\nwomen any significance in their demands for civil and political\r\nrights. Custom and philosophy, in regard to woman's happiness, are\r\nalike based on the idea that her strongest social sentiment is love of\r\nchildren; that in this relation her soul finds complete satisfaction.\r\nBut the love of offspring, common to all orders of women and all forms\r\nof animal life, tender and beautiful as it is, can not as a sentiment\r\nrank with conjugal love. The one calls out only the negative virtues\r\nthat belong to apathetic classes, such as patience, endurance,\r\nself-sacrifice, exhausting the brain-forces, ever giving, asking\r\nnothing in return; the other, the outgrowth of the two supreme powers\r\nin nature, the positive and negative magnetism, the centrifugal and\r\ncentripetal forces, the masculine and feminine elements, possessing\r\nthe divine power of creation, in the universe of thought and action.\r\nTwo pure souls fused into one by an impassioned love--friends,\r\ncounselors--a mutual support and inspiration to each other amid life's\r\nstruggles, must know the highest human happiness;--this is marriage;\r\nand this is the only corner-stone of an enduring home. Neither does\r\nordinary motherhood, assumed without any high purpose or preparation,\r\ncompare in sentiment with the lofty ambition and conscientious\r\ndevotion of the artist whose pure children of the brain in poetry,\r\npainting, music, and science are ever beckoning her upward into an\r\nideal world of beauty. They who give the world a true philosophy, a\r\ngrand poem, a beautiful painting or statue, or can tell the story of\r\nevery wandering star; a George Eliot, a Rosa Bonheur, an Elizabeth\r\nBarrett Browning, a Maria Mitchell--whose blood has flowed to the\r\nhigher arches of the brain,--have lived to a holier purpose than they\r\nwhose children are of the flesh alone, into whose minds they have\r\nbreathed no clear perceptions of great principles, no moral\r\naspiration, no spiritual life.\r\n\r\nHer rights are as completely ignored in what is adjudged to be woman's\r\nsphere as out of it; the woman is uniformly sacrificed to the wife and\r\nmother. Neither law, gospel, public sentiment, nor domestic affection\r\nshield her from excessive and enforced maternity, depleting alike to\r\nmother and child;--all opportunity for mental improvement, health,\r\nhappiness--yea, life itself, being ruthlessly sacrificed. The weazen,\r\nweary, withered, narrow-minded wife-mother of half a dozen\r\nchildren--her interests all centering at her fireside, forms a painful\r\ncontrast in many a household to the liberal, genial, brilliant,\r\ncultured husband in the zenith of his power, who has never given one\r\nthought to the higher life, liberty, and happiness of the woman by his\r\nside; believing her self-abnegation to be Nature's law.\r\n\r\nIt is often asked, \"if political equality would not rouse antagonisms\r\nbetween the sexes?\" If it could be proved that men and women had been\r\nharmonious in all ages and countries, and that women were happy and\r\nsatisfied in their slavery, one might hesitate in proposing any change\r\nwhatever. But the apathy, the helpless, hopeless resignation of a\r\nsubjected class can not be called happiness. The more complete the\r\ndespotism, the more smoothly all things move on the surface. \"Order\r\nreigns in Warsaw.\" In right conditions, the interests of man and woman\r\nare essentially one; but in false conditions, they must ever be\r\nopposed. The principle of equality of rights underlies all human\r\nsentiments, and its assertion by any individual or class must rouse\r\nantagonism, unless conceded. This has been the battle of the ages, and\r\nwill be until all forms of slavery are banished from the earth.\r\nPhilosophers, historians, poets, novelists, alike paint woman the\r\nvictim ever of man's power and selfishness. And now all writers on\r\nEastern civilization tell us, the one insurmountable obstacle to the\r\nimprovement of society in those countries, is the ignorance and\r\nsuperstition of the women. Stronger than the trammels of custom and\r\nlaw, is her religion, which teaches that her condition is\r\nHeaven-ordained. As the most ignorant minds cling with the greatest\r\ntenacity to the dogmas and traditions of their faith, a reform that\r\ninvolves an attack on that stronghold can only be carried by the\r\neducation of another generation. Hence the self-assertion, the\r\nantagonism, the rebellion of woman, so much deplored in England and\r\nthe United States, is the hope of our higher civilization. A woman\r\ngrowing up under American ideas of liberty in government and religion,\r\nhaving never blushed behind a Turkish mask, nor pressed her feet in\r\nChinese shoes, can not brook any disabilities based on sex alone,\r\nwithout a deep feeling of antagonism with the power that creates it.\r\nThe change needed to restore good feeling can not be reached by\r\nremanding woman to the spinning-wheel, and the contentment of her\r\ngrandmother, but by conceding to her every right which the spirit of\r\nthe age demands. Modern inventions have banished the spinning-wheel,\r\nand the same law of progress makes the woman of to-day a different\r\nwoman from her grandmother.\r\n\r\nWith these brief replies to the oft-repeated objections made by the\r\nopposition, we hope to rouse new thoughts in minds prepared to receive\r\nthem. That equal rights for woman have not long ago been secured, is\r\ndue to causes beyond the control of the actors in this reform. \"The\r\nsuccess of a movement,\" says Lecky, \"depends much less upon the force\r\nof its arguments, or upon the ability of its advocates, than the\r\npredisposition of society to receive it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPRECEDING CAUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs civilization advances there is a continual change in the standard\r\nof human rights. In barbarous ages the right of the strongest was the\r\nonly one recognized; but as mankind progressed in the arts and\r\nsciences intellect began to triumph over brute force. Change is a law\r\nof life, and the development of society a natural growth. Although to\r\nthis law we owe the discoveries of unknown worlds, the inventions of\r\nmachinery, swifter modes of travel, and clearer ideas as to the value\r\nof human life and thought, yet each successive change has met with the\r\nmost determined opposition. Fortunately, progress is not the result of\r\npre-arranged plans of individuals, but is born of a fortuitous\r\ncombination of circumstances that compel certain results, overcoming\r\nthe natural inertia of mankind. There is a certain enjoyment in\r\nhabitual sluggishness; in rising each morning with the same ideas as\r\nthe night before; in retiring each night with the thoughts of the\r\nmorning. This inertia of mind and body has ever held the multitude in\r\nchains. Thousands have thus surrendered their most sacred rights of\r\nconscience. In all periods of human development, thinking has been\r\npunished as a crime, which is reason sufficient to account for the\r\ngeneral passive resignation of the masses to their conditions and\r\nenvironments.\r\n\r\nAgain, \"subjection to the powers that be\" has been the lesson of both\r\nChurch and State, throttling science, checking invention, crushing\r\nfree thought, persecuting and torturing those who have dared to speak\r\nor act outside of established authority. Anathemas and the stake have\r\nupheld the Church, banishment and the scaffold the throne, and the\r\nfreedom of mankind has ever been sacrificed to the idea of protection.\r\nSo entirely has the human will been enslaved in all classes of society\r\nin the past, that monarchs have humbled themselves to popes, nations\r\nhave knelt at the feet of monarchs, and individuals have sold\r\nthemselves to others under the subtle promise of \"protection\"--a word\r\nthat simply means release from all responsibility, all use of one's\r\nown faculties--a word that has ever blinded people to its true\r\nsignificance. Under authority and this false promise of \"protection,\"\r\nself-reliance, the first incentive to freedom, has not only been lost,\r\nbut the aversion of mankind for responsibility has been fostered by\r\nthe few, whose greater bodily strength, superior intellect, or the\r\ninherent law of self-development has impelled to active exertion.\r\nObedience and self-sacrifice--the virtues prescribed for subordinate\r\nclasses, and which naturally grow out of their condition--are alike\r\nopposed to the theory of individual rights and self-government. But as\r\neven the inertia of mankind is not proof against the internal law of\r\nprogress, certain beliefs have been inculcated, certain crimes\r\ninvented, in order to intimidate the masses. Hence, the Church made\r\nfree thought the worst of sins, and the spirit of inquiry the worst of\r\nblasphemies; while the State proclaimed her temporal power of divine\r\norigin, and all rebellion high treason alike to God and the king, to\r\nbe speedily and severely punished. In this union of Church and State\r\nmankind touched the lowest depth of degradation. As late as the time\r\nof Bunyan the chief doctrine inculcated from the pulpit was obedience\r\nto the temporal power.\r\n\r\nAll these influences fell with crushing weight on woman; more\r\nsensitive, helpless, and imaginative, she suffered a thousand fears\r\nand wrongs where man did one. Lecky, in his \"History of Rationalism in\r\nEurope,\" shows that the vast majority of the victims of fanaticism and\r\nwitchcraft, burned, drowned, and tortured, were women. Guizot, in his\r\n\"History of Civilization,\" while decrying the influence of caste in\r\nIndia, and deploring it as the result of barbarism, thanks God there\r\nis no system of caste in Europe; ignoring the fact that in all its\r\ndire and baneful effects, the caste of sex everywhere exists, creating\r\ndiverse codes of morals for men and women, diverse penalties for\r\ncrime, diverse industries, diverse religions and educational rights,\r\nand diverse relations to the Government. Men are the Brahmins, women\r\nthe Pariahs, under our existing civilization. Herbert Spencer's\r\n\"Descriptive Sociology of England,\" an epitome of English history,\r\nsays: \"Our laws are based on the all-sufficiency of man's rights, and\r\nsociety exists to-day for woman only in so far as she is in the\r\nkeeping of some man.\" Thus society, including our systems of\r\njurisprudence, civil and political theories, trade, commerce,\r\neducation, religion, friendships, and family life, have all been\r\nframed on the sole idea of man's rights. Hence, he takes upon himself\r\nthe responsibility of directing and controlling the powers of woman,\r\nunder that all-sufficient excuse of tyranny, \"divine right.\" This same\r\ncry of divine authority created the castes of India; has for ages\r\nseparated its people into bodies, with different industrial,\r\neducational, civil, religious, and political rights; has maintained\r\nthis separation for the benefit of the superior class, and sedulously\r\ntaught the doctrine that any change in existing conditions would be a\r\nsin of most direful magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe opposition of theologians, though first to be exhibited when any\r\nchange is proposed, for reason that change not only takes power from\r\nthem, but lessens the reverence of mankind for them, is not in its\r\nfinal result so much to be feared as the opposition of those holding\r\npolitical power. The Church, knowing this, has in all ages aimed to\r\nconnect itself with the State. Political freedom guarantees religious\r\nliberty, freedom to worship God according to the dictates of one's own\r\nconscience, fosters a spirit of inquiry, creates self-reliance,\r\ninduces a feeling of responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe people who demand authority for every thought and action, who look\r\nto others for wisdom and protection, are those who perpetuate tyranny.\r\nThe thinkers and actors who find their authority within, are those who\r\ninaugurate freedom. Obedience to outside authority to which woman has\r\neverywhere been trained, has not only dwarfed her capacity, but made\r\nher a retarding force in civilization, recognized at last by statesmen\r\nas a dangerous element to free institutions. A recent writer, speaking\r\nof Turkey, says: \"All attempts for the improvement of that nation must\r\nprove futile, owing to the degradation of its women; and their\r\nelevation is hopeless so long as they are taught by their religion\r\nthat their condition is ordained of heaven.\" Gladstone, in one of his\r\npamphlets on the revival of Catholicism in England, says: \"The spread\r\nof this religion is due, as might be expected, to woman;\" thus\r\nconceding in both cases her power to block the wheels of progress.\r\nHence, in the scientific education of woman, in the training of her\r\nfaculties to independent thought and logical reasoning, lies the hope\r\nof the future.\r\n\r\nThe two great sources of progress are intellect and wealth. Both\r\nrepresent power, and are the elements of success in life. Education\r\nfrees the mind from the bondage of authority and makes the individual\r\nself-asserting. Remunerative industry is the means of securing to its\r\npossessor wealth and education, transforming the laborer to the\r\ncapitalist. Work in itself is not power; it is but the means to an\r\nend. The slave is not benefited by his industry; he does not receive\r\nthe results of his toil; his labor enriches another--adds to the power\r\nof his master to bind his chains still closer. Although woman has\r\nperformed much of the labor of the world, her industry and economy\r\nhave been the very means of increasing her degradation. Not being\r\nfree, the results of her labor have gone to build up and sustain the\r\nvery class that has perpetuated this injustice. Even in the family,\r\nwhere we should naturally look for the truest conditions, woman has\r\nalways been robbed of the fruits of her own toil. The influence the\r\nCatholic Church has had on religious free thought, that monarchies\r\nhave had on political free thought, that serfdom has had upon free\r\nlabor, have all been cumulative in the family upon woman. Taught that\r\nfather and husband stood to her in the place of God, she has been\r\ndenied liberty of conscience, and held in obedience to masculine will.\r\nTaught that the fruits of her industry belonged to others, she has\r\nseen man enter into every avocation most suitable to her, while she,\r\nthe uncomplaining drudge of the household, condemned to the severest\r\nlabor, has been systematically robbed of her earnings, which have gone\r\nto build up her master's power, and she has found herself in the\r\ncondition of the slave, deprived of the results of her own labor.\r\nTaught that education for her was indelicate and irreligious, she has\r\nbeen kept in such gross ignorance as to fall a prey to superstition,\r\nand to glory in her own degradation. Taught that a low voice is an\r\nexcellent thing in woman, she has been trained to a subjugation of the\r\nvocal organs, and thus lost the benefit of loud tones and their\r\nwell-known invigoration of the system. Forbidden to run, climb, or\r\njump, her muscles have been weakened, and her strength deteriorated.\r\nConfined most of the time to the house, she has neither as strong\r\nlungs nor as vigorous a digestion as her brother. Forbidden to enter\r\nthe pulpit, she has been trained to an unquestioning reverence for\r\ntheological authority and false belief upon the most vital interests\r\nof religion. Forbidden the medical profession, she has at the most\r\nsacred times of her life been left to the ignorant supervision of male\r\nphysicians, and seen her young children die by thousands. Forbidden to\r\nenter the courts, she has seen her sex unjustly tried and condemned\r\nfor crimes men were incapable of judging.\r\n\r\nWoman has been the great unpaid laborer of the world, and although\r\nwithin the last two decades a vast number of new employments have been\r\nopened to her, statistics prove that in the great majority of these,\r\nshe is not paid according to the value of the work done, but according\r\nto sex. The opening of all industries to woman, and the wage question\r\nas connected with her, are most subtle and profound questions of\r\npolitical economy, closely interwoven with the rights of\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\nThe revival of learning had its influence upon woman, and we find in\r\nthe early part of the fourteenth century a decided tendency toward a\r\nrecognition of her equality. Christine of Pisa, the most eminent woman\r\nof this period, supported a family of six persons by her pen, taking\r\nhigh ground on the conservation of morals in opposition to the general\r\nlicentious spirit of the age. Margaret of Angoulême, the brilliant\r\nQueen of Navarre, was a voluminous writer, her Heptaméron rising to\r\nthe dignity of a French classic. A paper in the _Revue des Deux\r\nMondes_, a few years since, by M. Henri Baudrillart, upon the\r\n\"Emancipation of Woman,\" recalls the fact that for nearly four hundred\r\nyears, men, too, have been ardent believers in equal rights for woman.\r\n\r\nIn 1509, Cornelius Agrippa, a great literary authority of his time,\r\npublished a work of this character. Agrippa was not content with\r\nclaiming woman's equality, but in a work of thirty chapters devoted\r\nhimself to proving \"the superiority of woman.\" In less than fifty\r\nyears (1552) Ruscelli brought out a similar work based on the Platonic\r\nPhilosophy. In 1599, Anthony Gibson wrote a book which in the prolix\r\nphraseology of the times was called, \"A Woman's Worth defended against\r\nall the Men in the World, proving to be more Perfect, Excellent, and\r\nAbsolute, in all Virtuous Actions, than any man of What Quality\r\nSoever.\" While these sturdy male defenders of the rights of woman met\r\nwith many opponents, some going so far as to assert that women were\r\nbeings not endowed with reason, they were sustained by many vigorous\r\nwriters among women. Italy, then the foremost literary country of\r\nEurope, possessed many women of learning, one of whom, Lucrezia\r\nMorinella, a Venetian lady, wrote a work entitled, \"The Nobleness and\r\nExcellence of Women, together with the Faults and Imperfections of\r\nMen.\"\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth century gave birth to many essays and books of a like\r\ncharacter, not confined to the laity, as several friars wrote upon the\r\nsame subject. In 1696, Daniel De Foe wished to have an institute\r\nfounded for the better education of young women. He said: \"We reproach\r\nthe sex every day for folly and impertinence, while I am confident had\r\nthey the advantages of education equal to us, they would be guilty of\r\nless than ourselves.\" Alexander's History of Women, John Paul Ribera's\r\nwork upon Women, the two huge quartos of De Costa upon the same\r\nsubject, Count Ségur's \"Women: Their Condition and Influence,\" and\r\nmany other works showed the drift of the new age.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation, that great revolution in religious thought, loosened\r\nthe grasp of the Church upon woman, and is to be looked upon as one of\r\nthe most important steps in this reform. In the reign of Elizabeth,\r\nEngland was called the Paradise of Women. When Elizabeth ascended the\r\nthrone, it was not only as queen, but she succeeded her father as the\r\nhead of the newly-formed rebellious Church, and she held firm grasp on\r\nboth Church and State during the long years of her reign, bending\r\nalike priest and prelate to her fiery will. The reign of Queen Anne,\r\ncalled the Golden Age of English Literature, is especially noticeable\r\non account of Mary Astell and Elizabeth Elstob. The latter, speaking\r\nnine languages, was most famous for her skill in the Saxon tongue. She\r\nalso replied to current objections made to woman's learning. Mary\r\nAstell elaborated a plan for a Woman's College, which was favorably\r\nreceived by Queen Anne, and would have been carried out, but for the\r\nopposition of Bishop Burnett.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the eighteenth century, there were public\r\ndiscussions by women in England, under the general head of Female\r\nParliament. These discussions took wide range, touching upon the\r\nentrance of men into those industries usually assigned to women, and\r\ndemanding for themselves higher educational advantages, and the right\r\nto vote at elections, and to be returned members of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe American Revolution, that great political rebellion of the ages,\r\nwas based upon the inherent rights of the individual. Perhaps in none\r\nbut English Colonies, by descendants of English parents, could such a\r\nrevolution have been consummated. England had never felt the bonds of\r\nfeudalism to the extent of many countries; its people had defied its\r\nmonarchs and wrested from them many civil rights, rights which\r\nprotected women as well as men, and although its common law, warped by\r\necclesiasticism, expended its chief rigors upon women, yet at an early\r\nday they enjoyed certain ecclesiastical and political powers unknown\r\nto women elsewhere. Before the Conquest, abbesses sat in councils of\r\nthe Church and signed its decrees; while kings were even dependent\r\nupon their consent in granting certain charters. The synod of Whitby,\r\nin the ninth century, was held in the convent of the Abbess Hilda, she\r\nherself presiding over its deliberations. The famous prophetess of\r\nKent at one period communicated the orders of Heaven to the Pope\r\nhimself. Ladies of birth and quality sat in council with the Saxon\r\nWitas--_i.e._, wise men--taking part in the Witenagemot, the great\r\nNational Council of our Saxon ancestors in England. In the seventh\r\ncentury this National Council met at Baghamstead to enact a new code\r\nof laws, the queen, abbesses, and many ladies of quality taking part\r\nand signing the decrees. Passing by other similar instances, we find\r\nin the reign of Henry III, that four women took seats in Parliament,\r\nand in the reign of Edward I. ten ladies were called to Parliament,\r\nwhile in the thirteenth century, Queen Elinor became keeper of the\r\nGreat Seal, sitting as Lord Chancellor in the _Aula Regia_, the\r\nhighest court of the Kingdom. Running back two or three centuries\r\nbefore the Christian era, we find Martia, her seat of power in London,\r\nholding the reins of government so wisely as to receive the surname of\r\nProba, the Just. She especially devoted herself to the enactment of\r\njust laws for her subjects, the first principles of the common law\r\ntracing back to her; the celebrated laws of Alfred, and of Edward the\r\nConfessor, being in great degree restorations and compilations from\r\nthe laws of Martia, which were known as the \"Martian Statutes.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the American colonies began their resistance to English tyranny,\r\nthe women--all this inherited tendency to freedom surging in their\r\nveins--were as active, earnest, determined, and self-sacrificing as\r\nthe men, and although, as Mrs. Ellet in her \"Women of the Revolution\"\r\nremarks, \"political history says but little, and that vaguely and\r\nincidentally, of the women who bore their part in the revolution,\" yet\r\nthat little shows woman to have been endowed with as lofty a\r\npatriotism as man, and to have as fully understood the principles upon\r\nwhich the struggle was based. Among the women who manifested deep\r\npolitical insight, were Mercy Otis Warren, Abigail Smith Adams, and\r\nHannah Lee Corbin; all closely related to the foremost men of the\r\nRevolution. Mrs. Warren was a sister of James Otis, whose fiery words\r\ndid so much to arouse and intensify the feelings of the colonists\r\nagainst British aggression. This brother and sister were united to the\r\nend of their lives in a friendship rendered firm and enduring by the\r\nsimilarity of their intellects and political views. The home of Mrs.\r\nWarren was the resort of patriotic spirits and the headquarters of the\r\nrebellion. She herself wrote, \"By the Plymouth fireside were many\r\npolitical plans organized, discussed, and digested.\" Her\r\ncorrespondence with eminent men of the Revolution was extensive and\r\nbelongs to the history of the country. She was the first one who based\r\nthe struggle upon \"inherent rights,\" a phrase afterward made the\r\ncorner-stone of political authority. Mrs. Warren asserted that\r\n\"'inherent rights' belonged to all mankind, and had been conferred on\r\nall by the God of nations.\" She numbered Jefferson among her\r\ncorrespondents, and the Declaration of Independence shows the\r\ninfluence of her mind. Among others who sought her counsel upon\r\npolitical matters were Samuel and John Adams, Dickinson, that pure\r\npatriot of Pennsylvania, Jefferson, Gerry, and Knox. She was the first\r\nperson who counseled separation and pressed those views upon John\r\nAdams, when he sought her advice before the opening of the first\r\nCongress. At that time even Washington had no thought of the final\r\nindependence of the colonies, emphatically denying such intention or\r\ndesire on their part, and John Adams was shunned in the streets of\r\nPhiladelphia for having dared to hint such a possibility. Mrs. Warren\r\nsustained his sinking courage and urged him to bolder steps. Her\r\nadvice was not only sought in every emergency, but political parties\r\nfound their arguments in her conversation. Mrs. Warren looked not to\r\nthe freedom of man alone, but to that of her own sex also.\r\n\r\nEngland itself had at least one woman who watched the struggle of\r\nAmerica with lively interest, and whose writings aided in the\r\ndissemination of republican ideas. This was the celebrated Catharine\r\nSawbridge Macaulay, one of the greatest minds England has ever\r\nproduced--a woman so noted for her republican ideas that after her\r\ndeath a statue was erected to her as the \"Patroness of Liberty.\"\r\nDuring the whole of the Revolutionary period, Washington was in\r\ncorrespondence with Mrs. Macaulay, who did much to sustain him during\r\nthose days of trial. She and Mrs. Warren were also correspondents at\r\nthat time. She wrote several works of a republican character, for home\r\ninfluence; among these, in 1775. \"An Address to the people of England,\r\nScotland, and Ireland, on the present Important Crisis of Affairs,\"\r\ndesigned to show the justice of the American cause. The gratitude\r\nAmerican's feel toward Edmund Burke for his aid, might well be\r\nextended to Mrs. Macaulay.\r\n\r\nAbigail Smith Adams, the wife of John Adams, was an American woman\r\nwhose political insight was worthy of remark. She early protested\r\nagainst the formation of a new government in which woman should be\r\nunrecognized, demanding for her a voice and representation. She was\r\nthe first American woman who threatened rebellion unless the rights of\r\nher sex were secured. In March, 1776, she wrote to her husband, then\r\nin the Continental Congress, \"I long to hear you have declared an\r\nindependency, and, by the way, in the new code of laws which I suppose\r\nit will be necessary for you to make, I desire you would remember the\r\nladies, and be more generous and favorable to them than your\r\nancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of husbands.\r\nRemember, all men would be tyrants if they could. If particular care\r\nand attention are not paid to the ladies, we are determined to foment\r\na rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound to obey any laws in\r\nwhich we have no voice or representation.\" Again and again did Mrs.\r\nAdams urge the establishment of an independency and the limitation of\r\nman's power over woman, declaring all arbitrary power dangerous and\r\ntending to revolution. Nor was she less mindful of equal advantages\r\nof education. \"If you complain of education in sons, what shall I say\r\nin regard to daughters, who every day experience the want of it?\" She\r\nexpressed a strong wish that the new Constitution might be\r\ndistinguished for its encouragement of learning and virtue. Nothing\r\nmore fully shows the dependent condition of a class than the methods\r\nused to secure their wishes. Mrs. Adams felt herself obliged to appeal\r\nto masculine selfishness in showing the reflex action woman's\r\neducation would have upon man. \"If,\" said she, \"we mean to have\r\nheroes, statesmen, and philosophers, we should have learned women.\"\r\nThus did the Revolutionary Mothers urge the recognition of equal\r\nrights when the Government was in the process of formation. Although\r\nthe first plot of ground in the United States for a public school had\r\nbeen given by a woman (Bridget Graffort), in 1700, her sex were denied\r\nadmission. Mrs. Adams, as well as her friend Mrs. Warren, had in their\r\nown persons felt the deprivations of early educational advantages. The\r\nboasted public school system of Massachusetts, created for boys only,\r\nopened at last its doors to girls, merely to secure its share of\r\npublic money. The women of the South, too, early demanded political\r\nequality. The counties of Mecklenberg and Rowan, North Carolina, were\r\nfamous for the patriotism of their women. Mecklenberg claims to have\r\nissued the first declaration of independence, and, at the centennial\r\ncelebration of this event in May, 1875, proudly accepted for itself\r\nthe derisive name given this region by Tarleton's officers, \"The\r\nHornet's Nest of America.\" This name--first bestowed by British\r\nofficers upon Mrs. Brevard's mansion, then Tarleton's headquarters,\r\nwhere that lady's fiery patriotism and stinging wit discomfited this\r\nGeneral in many a sally--was at last held to include the whole county.\r\nIn 1778, only two years after the Declaration of Independence was\r\nadopted, and while the flames of war were still spreading over the\r\ncountry, Hannah Lee Corbin, of Virginia, the sister of General Richard\r\nHenry Lee, wrote him, protesting against the taxation of women unless\r\nthey were allowed to vote. He replied that \"women were already\r\npossessed of that right,\" thus recognizing the fact of woman's\r\nenfranchisement as one of the results of the new government, and it is\r\non record that women in Virginia did at an early day exercise the\r\nright of voting. New Jersey also specifically secured this right to\r\nwomen on the 2d of July, 1776--a right exercised by them for more than\r\na third of a century. Thus our country started into governmental life\r\nfreighted with the protests of the Revolutionary Mothers against being\r\nruled without their consent. From that hour to the present, women have\r\nbeen continually raising their voices against political tyranny, and\r\ndemanding for themselves equality of opportunity in every department\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, Mary Wollstonecraft's \"Vindication of the Rights of Women,\"\r\npublished in London, attracted much attention from liberal minds. She\r\nexamined the position of woman in the light of existing civilizations,\r\nand demanded for her the widest opportunities of education, industry,\r\npolitical knowledge, and the right of representation. Although her\r\nwork is filled with maxims of the highest morality and purest wisdom,\r\nit called forth such violent abuse, that her husband appealed for her\r\nfrom the judgment of her contemporaries to that of mankind. So exalted\r\nwere her ideas of woman, so comprehensive her view of life, that\r\nMargaret Fuller, in referring to her, said: \"Mary Wollstonecraft--a\r\nwoman whose existence proved the need of some new interpretation of\r\nwoman's rights, belonging to that class who by birth find themselves\r\nin places so narrow that, by breaking bonds, they become outlaws.\"\r\nFollowing her, came Jane Marcet, Eliza Lynn, and Harriet\r\nMartineau--each of whom in the early part of the nineteenth century,\r\nexerted a decided influence upon the political thought of England.\r\nMrs. Marcet was one of the most scientific and highly cultivated\r\npersons of the age. Her \"Conversations on Chemistry,\" familiarized\r\nthat science both in England and America, and from it various male\r\nwriters filched their ideas. It was a text-book in this country for\r\nmany years. Over one hundred and sixty thousand copies were sold,\r\nthough the fact that this work emanated from the brain of a woman was\r\ncarefully withheld. Mrs. Marcet also wrote upon political economy, and\r\nwas the first person who made the subject comprehensive to the popular\r\nmind. Her manner of treating it was so clear and vivid, that the\r\npublic, to whom it had been a hidden science, were able to grasp the\r\nsubject. Her writings were the inspiration of Harriet Martineau, who\r\nfollowed her in the same department of thought at a later period. Miss\r\nMartineau was a remarkable woman. Besides her numerous books on\r\npolitical economy, she was a regular contributor to the London _Daily\r\nNews_, the second paper in circulation in England, for many years\r\nwriting five long articles weekly, also to Dickens' _Household Words_,\r\nand the _Westminster Review_. She saw clearly the spirit and purpose\r\nof the Anti-Slavery Movement in this country, and was a regular\r\ncontributor to the _National Anti-Slavery Standard_, published in New\r\nYork. Eliza Lynn, an Irish lady, was at this time writing leading\r\neditorials for political papers. In Russia, Catharine II., the\r\nabsolute and irresponsible ruler of that vast nation, gave utterance\r\nto views, of which, says La Harpe, the revolutionists of France and\r\nAmerica fondly thought themselves the originators. She caused her\r\ngrandchildren to be educated into the most liberal ideas, and Russia\r\nwas at one time the only country in Europe where political refugees\r\ncould find safety. To Catharine, Russia is indebted for the first\r\nproposition to enfranchise the serfs, but meeting strong opposition\r\nshe was obliged to relinquish this idea, which was carried to fruition\r\nby her great-grandson, Alexander.\r\n\r\nThis period of the eighteenth century was famous for the executions of\r\nwomen on account of their radical political opinions, Madame Roland,\r\nthe leader of the liberal party in France, going to the guillotine\r\nwith the now famous words upon her lips, \"Oh, Liberty, what crimes are\r\ncommitted in thy name!\" The beautiful Charlotte Corday sealed with her\r\nlife her belief in liberty, while Sophia Lapiérre barely escaped the\r\nsame fate; though two men, Siéyes and Condorcét, in the midst of the\r\nFrench Revolution, proposed the recognition of woman's political\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nFrances Wright, a person of extraordinary powers of mind, born in\r\nDundee, Scotland, in 1797, was the first woman who gave lectures on\r\npolitical subjects in America. When sixteen years of age she heard of\r\nthe existence of a country in which freedom for the people had been\r\nproclaimed; she was filled with joy and a determination to visit the\r\nAmerican Republic where the foundations of justice, liberty, and\r\nequality had been so securely laid. In 1820 she came here, traveling\r\nextensively North and South. She was at that time but twenty-two years\r\nof age. Her letters gave Europeans the first true knowledge of\r\nAmerica, and secured for her the friendship of LaFayette. Upon her\r\nsecond visit she made this country her home for several years. Her\r\nradical ideas on theology, slavery, and the social degradation of\r\nwoman, now generally accepted by the best minds of the age, were then\r\ndenounced by both press and pulpit, and maintained by her at the risk\r\nof her life. Although the Government of the United States was framed\r\non the basis of entire separation of Church and State, yet from an\r\nearly day the theological spirit had striven to unite the two, in\r\norder to strengthen the Church by its union with the civil power. As\r\nearly as 1828, the standard of \"The Christian Party in Politics\" was\r\nopenly unfurled. Frances Wright had long been aware of its insidious\r\nefforts, and its reliance upon women for its support. Ignorant,\r\nsuperstitious, devout, woman's general lack of education made her a\r\nfitting instrument for the work of thus undermining the republic.\r\nHaving deprived her of her just rights, the country was new to find in\r\nwoman its most dangerous foe. Frances Wright lectured that winter in\r\nthe large cities of the West and Middle States, striving to rouse the\r\nnation to the new danger which threatened it. The clergy at once\r\nbecame her most bitter opponents. The cry of \"infidel\" was started on\r\nevery side, though her work was of vital importance to the country and\r\nundertaken from the purest philanthropy. In speaking of her\r\npersecutions she said: \"The injury and inconvenience of every kind and\r\nevery hour to which, in these days, a really consistent reformer\r\nstands exposed, none can conceive but those who experience them. Such\r\nbecome, as it were, excommunicated after the fashion of the old\r\nCatholic Mother Church, removed even from the protection of law, such\r\nas it is, and from the sympathy of society, for whose sake they\r\nconsent to be crucified.\"\r\n\r\nAmong those who were advocating the higher education of women, Mrs.\r\nEmma Willard became noted at this period. Born with a strong desire\r\nfor learning, she keenly felt the educational disadvantages of her\r\nsex. She began teaching at an early day, introducing new studies and\r\nnew methods in her school, striving to secure public interest in\r\npromoting woman's education. Governor Clinton, of New York, impressed\r\nwith the wisdom of her plans, invited her to move her school from\r\nConnecticut to New York. She accepted, and in 1819 established a\r\nschool in Watervleit, which soon moved to Troy, and in time built up a\r\ngreat reputation. Through the influence of Governor Clinton, the\r\nLegislature granted a portion of the educational fund to endow this\r\ninstitution, which was the first instance in the United States of\r\nGovernment aid for the education of women. Amos B. Eaton, Professor of\r\nthe Natural Sciences in the Rensselaer Institute, Troy, at this time,\r\nwas Mrs. Willard's faithful friend and teacher. In the early days it\r\nwas her custom, in introducing a new branch of learning into her\r\nseminary, to study it herself, reciting to Professor Eaton every\r\nevening the lesson of the next day. Thus she went through botany,\r\nchemistry, mineralogy, astronomy, and the higher mathematics. As she\r\ncould not afford teachers for these branches, with faithful study she\r\nfitted herself. Mrs. Willard's was the first girls' school in which\r\nthe higher mathematics formed part of the course, but such was the\r\nprejudice against a liberal education for woman, that the first public\r\nexamination of a girl in geometry (1829) created as bitter a storm of\r\nridicule as has since assailed women who have entered the law, the\r\npulpit, or the medical profession. The derision attendant upon the\r\nexperiment of advancing woman's education, led Governor Clinton to say\r\nin his message to the Legislature: \"I trust you will not be deterred\r\nby commonplace ridicule from extending your munificence to this\r\nmeritorious institution.\" At a school convention in Syracuse, 1845,\r\nMrs. Willard suggested the employment of woman as superintendents of\r\npublic schools, a measure since adopted in many States. She also\r\nprojected the system of normal schools for the higher education of\r\nteachers. A scientific explorer as well as student, she wrote a work\r\non the \"Motive Power in the Circulation of the Blood,\" in\r\ncontradiction to Harvey's theory, which at once attracted the\r\nattention of medical men. This work was one of the then accumulating\r\nevidences of woman's adaptation to medical study.\r\n\r\nIn Ancient Egypt the medical profession was in the hands of women, to\r\nwhich we may attribute that country's almost entire exemption from\r\ninfantile diseases, a fact which recent discoveries fully\r\nauthenticate. The enormous death-rate of young children in modern\r\ncivilized countries may be traced to woman's general enforced\r\nignorance of the laws of life, and to the fact that the profession of\r\nmedicine has been too exclusively in the hands of men. Though through\r\nthe dim past we find women still making discoveries, and in the feudal\r\nages possessing knowledge of both medicine and surgery, it is but\r\nrecently that they have been welcomed as practitioners into the\r\nmedical profession. Looking back scarcely a hundred years, we find\r\nscience much indebted to woman for some of its most brilliant\r\ndiscoveries. In 1736, the first medical botany was given to the world\r\nby Elizabeth Blackwell, a woman physician, whom the persecutions of\r\nher male compeers had cast into jail for debt. As Bunyan prepared his\r\n\"Pilgrim's Progress\" between prison walls, so did Elizabeth Blackwell,\r\nno-wise disheartened, prepare her valuable aid to medical science\r\nunder the same conditions. Lady Montague's discovery of a check to the\r\nsmall-pox, Madam Boivin's discovery of the hidden cause of certain\r\nhemorrhages, Madam de Condrày's invention of the manikin, are among\r\nthe notable steps which opened the way to the modern Elizabeth\r\nBlackwell, Harriot K. Hunt, Clemence S. Lozier, Ann Preston, Hannah\r\nLongshore, Marie Jackson, Laura Ross Wolcott, Marie Zakrzewska, and\r\nMary Putnam Jacobi, who are some of the earlier distinguished American\r\nexamples of woman's skill in the healing art.\r\n\r\nMary Gove Nichols gave public lectures upon anatomy in the United\r\nStates in 1838. Paulina Wright (Davis) followed her upon physiology in\r\n1844, using a manikin in her illustrations.[1] Mariana Johnson\r\nfollowed Mrs. Davis, but it was 1848 before Elizabeth Blackwell--the\r\nfirst woman to pass through the regular course of medical\r\nstudy--received her diploma at Geneva.[2] In 1845-6, preceding Miss\r\nBlackwell's course of study, Dr. Samuel Gregory and his brother George\r\nissued pamphlets advocating the education and employment of\r\nwomen-physicians, and, in 1847, Dr. Gregory delivered a series of\r\nlectures in Boston upon that subject, followed in 1848 by a school\r\nnumbering twelve ladies, and an association entitled the \"American\r\nFemale Medical Education Society.\" In 1832, Lydia Maria Child\r\npublished her \"History of Woman,\" which was the first American\r\nstorehouse of information upon the whole question, and undoubtedly\r\nincreased the agitation. In 1836, Ernestine L. Rose, a Polish\r\nlady--banished from her native country by the Austrian tyrant, Francis\r\nJoseph, for her love of liberty--came to America, lecturing in the\r\nlarge cities North and South upon the \"Science of Government.\" She\r\nadvocated the enfranchisement of woman. Her beauty, wit, and eloquence\r\ndrew crowded houses. About this period Judge Hurlbut, of New York, a\r\nleading member of the Bar, wrote a vigorous work on \"Human Rights,\"[3]\r\nin which he advocated political equality for women. This work\r\nattracted the attention of many legal minds throughout that State. In\r\nthe winter of 1836, a bill was introduced into the New York\r\nLegislature by Judge Hertell, to secure to married women their rights\r\nof property. This bill was drawn up under the direction of Hon. John\r\nSavage, Chief-Justice of the Supreme Court, and Hon. John C. Spencer,\r\none of the revisers of the statutes of New York. It was in furtherance\r\nof this bill that Ernestine L. Rose and Paulina Wright at that early\r\nday circulated petitions. The very few names they secured show the\r\nhopeless apathy and ignorance of the women as to their own rights. As\r\nsimilar bills[4] were pending in New York until finally passed in\r\n1848, a great educational work was accomplished in the constant\r\ndiscussion of the topics involved. During the winters of 1844-5-6,\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton, living in Albany, made the acquaintance of\r\nJudge Hurlbut and a large circle of lawyers and legislators, and,\r\nwhile exerting herself to strengthen their convictions in favor of the\r\npending bill, she resolved at no distant day to call a convention for\r\na full and free discussion of woman's rights and wrongs.\r\n\r\nIn 1828, Sarah and Angelina Grimke, daughters of a wealthy planter of\r\nCharleston, South Carolina, emancipated their slaves and came North to\r\nlecture on the evils of slavery, leaving their home and native place\r\nforever because of their hatred of this wrong. Angelina was a natural\r\norator. Fresh from the land of bondage, there was a fervor in her\r\nspeech that electrified her hearers and drew crowds wherever she went.\r\nSarah published a book reviewing the Bible arguments the clergy were\r\nthen making in their pulpits to prove that the degradation of the\r\nslave and woman were alike in harmony with the expressed will of God.\r\nThus women from the beginning took an active part in the Anti-Slavery\r\nstruggle. They circulated petitions, raised large sums of money by\r\nfairs, held prayer-meetings and conventions. In 1835, Angelina wrote\r\nan able letter to William Lloyd Garrison, immediately after the Boston\r\nmob. These letters and appeals were considered very effective\r\nabolition documents.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1837, a National Woman's Anti-Slavery Convention was held in\r\nNew York, in which eight States were represented by seventy-one\r\ndelegates. The meetings were ably sustained through two days. The\r\ndifferent sessions were opened by prayer and reading of the Scriptures\r\nby the women themselves. A devout, earnest spirit prevailed. The\r\ndebates, resolutions, speeches, and appeals were fully equal to those\r\nin any Convention held by men of that period. Angelina Grimke was\r\nappointed by this Convention to prepare an appeal for the slaves to\r\nthe people of the free States, and a letter to John Quincy Adams\r\nthanking him for his services in defending the right of petition for\r\nwomen and slaves, qualified with the regret that by expressing himself\r\n\"adverse to the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia,\" he\r\ndid not sustain the cause of freedom and of God. She wrote a stirring\r\nappeal to the Christian women of the South, urging them to use their\r\ninfluence against slavery. Sarah also wrote an appeal to the clergy of\r\nthe South, conjuring them to use their power for freedom.\r\n\r\nAmong those who took part in these conventions we find the names of\r\nLydia Maria Child, Mary Grove, Henrietta Sargent, Sarah Pugh, Abby\r\nKelley, Mary S. Parker, of Boston, who was president of the\r\nConvention; Anne Webster, Deborah Shaw, Martha Storrs, Mrs. A. L.\r\nCox, Rebecca B. Spring, and Abigail Hopper Gibbons, a daughter of that\r\nnoble Quaker philanthropist, Isaac T. Hopper.\r\n\r\nAbby Kelley was the most untiring and the most persecuted of all the\r\nwomen who labored throughout the Anti-Slavery struggle. She traveled\r\nup and down, alike in winter's cold and summer's heat, with scorn,\r\nridicule, violence, and mobs accompanying her, suffering all kinds of\r\npersecutions, still speaking whenever and wherever she gained an\r\naudience; in the open air, in school-house, barn, depot, church, or\r\npublic hall; on week-day or Sunday, as she found opportunity. For\r\nlistening to her, on Sunday, many men and women were expelled from\r\ntheir churches. Thus through continued persecution was woman's\r\nself-assertion and self-respect sufficiently developed to prompt her\r\nat last to demand justice, liberty, and equality for herself.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, Margaret Fuller published an essay in the _Dial_, entitled\r\n\"The Great Lawsuit, or Man _vs._ Woman: Woman _vs._ Man.\" In this\r\nessay she demanded perfect equality for woman, in education, industry,\r\nand politics. It attracted great attention and was afterward expanded\r\ninto a work entitled \"Woman in the Nineteenth Century.\" This, with her\r\nparlor conversations, on art, science, religion, politics, philosophy,\r\nand social life, gave a new impulse to woman's education as a\r\nthinker.[5]\r\n\r\n\"Woman and her Era,\" by Eliza Woodson Farnham, was another work that\r\ncalled out a general discussion on the status of the sexes, Mrs.\r\nFarnham taking the ground of woman's superiority. The great social and\r\neducational work done by her in California, when society there was\r\nchiefly male, and rapidly tending to savagism, and her humane\r\nexperiment in the Sing Sing (N. Y.), State Prison, assisted by\r\nGeorgiana Bruce Kirby and Mariana Johnson, are worthy of mention.\r\n\r\nIn the State of New York, in 1845, Rev. Samuel J. May preached a\r\nsermon at Syracuse, upon \"The Eights and Conditions of Women,\" in\r\nwhich he sustained their right to take part in political life, saying\r\nwomen need not expect \"to have their wrongs fully redressed, until\r\nthey themselves have a voice and a hand in the enactment and\r\nadministration of the laws.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1847, Clarina Howard Nichols, in her husband's paper, addressed to\r\nthe voters of the State of Vermont a series of editorials, setting\r\nforth the injustice of the property disabilities of married women.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, Lucretia Mott published a discourse on woman, delivered in\r\nthe Assembly Building, Philadelphia, in answer to a Lyceum lecture\r\nwhich Richard H. Dana, of Boston, was giving in many of the chief\r\ncities, ridiculing the idea of political equality for woman. Elizabeth\r\nWilson, of Ohio, published a scriptural view of woman's rights and\r\nduties far in advance of the generally received opinions. At even an\r\nearlier day, Martha Bradstreet, of Utica, plead her own case in the\r\ncourts of New York, continuing her contest for many years. The\r\ntemperance reform and the deep interest taken in it by women; the\r\neffective appeals they made, setting forth their wrongs as mother,\r\nwife, sister, and daughter of the drunkard, with a power beyond that\r\nof man, early gave them a local place on this platform as a favor,\r\nthough denied as a right. Delegates from woman's societies to State\r\nand National conventions invariably found themselves rejected. It was\r\nher early labors in the temperance cause that first roused Susan B.\r\nAnthony to a realizing sense of woman's social, civil, and political\r\ndegradation, and thus secured her life-long labors for the\r\nenfranchisement of woman. In 1847 she made her first speech at a\r\npublic meeting of the Daughters of Temperance in Canajoharie, N. Y.\r\nThe same year Antoinette L. Brown, then a student at Oberlin College,\r\nOhio, the first institution that made the experiment of co-education,\r\ndelivered her first speech on temperance in several places in Ohio,\r\nand on Woman's Rights, in the Baptist church at Henrietta, N. Y. Lucy\r\nStone, a graduate of Oberlin, made her first speech on Woman's Rights\r\nthe same year in her brother's church at Brookfield, Mass.\r\n\r\nNor were the women of Europe inactive during these years. In 1824\r\nElizabeth Heyrick, a Quaker woman, cut the gordian knot of difficulty\r\nin the anti-slavery struggle in England, by an able essay in favor of\r\nimmediate, unconditional emancipation. At Leipsic, in 1844, Helene\r\nMarie Weber--her father a Prussian officer, and her mother an English\r\nwoman--wrote a series of ten tracts on \"Woman's Rights and Wrongs,\"\r\ncovering the whole question and making a volume of over twelve hundred\r\npages. The first of these treated of the intellectual faculties; the\r\nsecond, woman's rights of property; the third, wedlock--deprecating\r\nthe custom of woman merging her civil existence in that of her\r\nhusband; the fourth claimed woman's right to all political emoluments;\r\nthe fifth, on ecclesiasticism, demanded for woman an entrance to the\r\npulpit; the sixth, upon suffrage, declared it to be woman's right and\r\nduty to vote. These essays were strong, vigorous, and convincing. Miss\r\nWeber also lectured in Vienna, Berlin, and several of the large German\r\ncities. In England, Lady Morgan's \"Woman and her Master\" appeared;--a\r\nwork filled with philosophical reflections, and of the same general\r\nbearing as Miss Weber's. Also an \"Appeal of Women,\" the joint work of\r\nMrs. Wheeler and William Thomson--a strong and vigorous essay, in\r\nwhich woman's limitations under the law were tersely and pungently set\r\nforth and her political rights demanded. The active part women took in\r\nthe Polish and German revolutions and in favor of the abolition of\r\nslavery in the British West Indies, all taught their lessons of\r\nwoman's rights. Madam Mathilde Anneke, on the staff of her husband,\r\nwith Hon. Carl Schurz, carried messages to and fro in the midst of\r\ndanger on the battle-fields of Germany.\r\n\r\nThus over the civilized world we find the same impelling forces, and\r\ngeneral development of society, without any individual concert of\r\naction, tending to the same general result; alike rousing the minds of\r\nmen and women to the aggregated wrongs of centuries and inciting to an\r\neffort for their overthrow.\r\n\r\nThe works of George Sand, Frederika Bremer, Charlotte Bronté, George\r\nEliot, Catharine Sedgwick, and Harriet Beecher Stowe, in literature;\r\nMrs. Hemans, Mrs. Sigourney, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, in poetry;\r\nAngelica Kauffman, Rosa Bonheur, Harriet Hosmer, in art; Mary\r\nSomerville, Caroline Herschell, Maria Mitchell, in science; Elizabeth\r\nFry, Dorothea Dix, Mary Carpenter, in prison reform; Florence\r\nNightingale and Clara Barton in the camp--are all parts of the great\r\nuprising of women out of the lethargy of the past, and are among the\r\nforces of the complete revolution a thousand pens and voices herald at\r\nthis hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] As showing woman's ignorance and prejudice, Mrs. Davis used to\r\nrelate that when she uncovered her manikin some ladies would drop\r\ntheir veils because of its indelicacy, and others would run from the\r\nroom; sometimes ladies even fainted.\r\n\r\n[2] The writer's father, a physician, as early as 1843-4, canvassed\r\nthe subject of giving his daughter (Matilda Joslyn Gage) a medical\r\neducation, looking to Geneva--then presided over by his old\r\ninstructor--to open its doors to her. But this bold idea was dropped,\r\nand Miss Blackwell was the first and only lady who was graduated from\r\nthat Institution until its incorporation with the Syracuse University\r\nand the removal of the college to that city.\r\n\r\n[3] Judge Hurlbut, with a lawyer's prejudice, first prepared a paper\r\nagainst the rights of woman. Looking it over, he saw himself able to\r\nanswer every argument, which he proceeded to do--the result being his\r\n\"Human Rights.\"\r\n\r\n[4] In the New York chapter a fuller account of the discussion and\r\naction upon these bills will be given.\r\n\r\n[5] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nWOMAN IN NEWSPAPERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn newspaper literature woman made her entrance at an early period and\r\nin an important manner. The first _daily_ newspaper in the world was\r\nestablished and edited by a woman, Elizabeth Mallet, in London, March,\r\n1702. It was called _The Daily Courant_. In her salutatory, Mrs.\r\nMallet declared she had established her paper to \"spare the public at\r\nleast half the impertinences which the ordinary papers contain.\" Thus\r\nthe first daily paper was made reformatory in its character by its\r\nwise woman-founder.\r\n\r\nThe first newspaper printed in Rhode Island was by Anna Franklin in\r\n1732. She was printer to the colony, supplied blanks to the public\r\nofficers, published pamphlets, etc., and in 1745 she printed for the\r\ncolonial government an edition of the laws comprising three hundred\r\nand forty pages. She was aided by her two daughters, who were correct\r\nand quick compositors. The woman servant of the house usually worked\r\nthe press. The third paper established in America was _The Mercury_,\r\nin Philadelphia. After the death of its founder, in 1742, it was\r\nsuspended for a week, when his widow, Mrs. Cornelia Bradford, revived\r\nit and carried it on for many years, making it both a literary and a\r\npecuniary success. The second newspaper started in the city of New\r\nYork, entitled the _New York Weekly Journal_, was conducted by Mrs.\r\nZeuger for years after the death of her husband. She discontinued its\r\npublication in 1748. The _Maryland Gazette_, the first paper in that\r\ncolony, and among the oldest in America, was established by Anna K.\r\nGreene in 1767. She did the colony printing and continued the business\r\ntill her death, in 1775. Mrs. Hassebatch also established a paper in\r\nBaltimore in 1773. Mrs. Mary K. Goddard published the _Maryland\r\nJournal_ for eight years. Her editorials were of so spirited and\r\npronounced a character that only her sex saved her from sound\r\nfloggings. She took in job work. She was the first postmaster after\r\nthe Revolution, holding the office for eight years. Two papers were\r\nearly published in Virginia by women. Each was established in\r\nWilliamsburg, and each was called _The Virginia Gazette_. The first,\r\nstarted by Clementina Reid, in 1772, favored the Colonial cause,\r\ngiving great offense to many royalists. To counteract its influence,\r\nMrs. H. Boyle, of the same place, started another paper in 1774, in\r\nthe interests of the Crown, and desirous that it should seem to\r\nrepresent the true principles of the colony, she borrowed the name of\r\nthe colonial paper. It lived but a short time. The Colonial _Virginia\r\nGazette_ was the first paper in which was printed the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. A synopsis was given July 19th, and the whole document\r\nthe 26th. Mrs. Elizabeth Timothee published a paper in Charleston,\r\nSouth Carolina, from 1773 to 1775, called _The Gazette_. Anna Timothee\r\nrevived it after the Revolution, and was appointed printer to the\r\nState, holding the office till 1792. Mary Crouch also published a\r\npaper in Charleston, S. C., until 1780. It was founded in special\r\nopposition to the Stamp Act. She afterward removed to Salem, Mass.,\r\nand continued its publication for several years. Penelope Russell\r\nprinted _The Censor_ in Boston, Mass., in 1771. She set her own type,\r\nand was such a ready compositor as to set up her editorials without\r\nwritten copy, while working at her case. The most tragical and\r\ninteresting events were thus recorded by her. The first paper\r\npublished in America, living to a second issue, was the _Massachusetts\r\nGazette and North Boston News Letter_. It was continued by Mrs.\r\nMargaret Draper, two years after the death of her husband, and was the\r\nonly paper of spirit in the colony, all but hers suspending\r\npublication when Boston was besieged by the British. Mrs. Sarah\r\nGoddard printed a paper at Newport, R. I., in 1776. She was a\r\nwell-educated woman, and versed in general literature. For two years\r\nshe conducted her journal with great ability, afterward associating\r\nJohn Carter with her, under the name of Sarah Goddard & Co., retaining\r\nthe partnership precedence so justly belonging to her. _The Courant_\r\nat Hartford, Ct., was edited for two years by Mrs. Watson, after the\r\ndeath of her husband, in 1777. In 1784 Mrs. Mary Holt edited and\r\npublished the _New York Journal_, continuing the business several\r\nyears. She was appointed State printer. In 1798, _The Journal and\r\nArgus_ fell into the hands of Mrs. Greenleaf, who for some time\r\npublished both a daily and semi-weekly edition. In Philadelphia, after\r\nthe death of her father in 1802, Mrs. Jane Aitkins continued his\r\nbusiness of printing. Her press-work bore high reputation. She was\r\nspecially noted for her correctness in proof-reading. The _Free\r\nEnquirer_, edited in New York by Frances Wright in 1828, \"was the\r\nfirst periodical established in the United States for the purpose of\r\nfearless and unbiased inquiry on all subjects.\" It had already been\r\npublished two years under the name of _The New Harmony Gazette_, in\r\nIndiana, by Robert Dale Owen, for which Mrs. Wright had written many\r\nleading editorials, and in which she published serially \"A Few Days in\r\nAthens.\"\r\n\r\nSarah Josepha Hale established a ladies' magazine in Boston in 1827,\r\nwhich she afterward removed to Philadelphia, there associating with\r\nherself Louis Godey, and assuming the editorship of _Godey's Lady's\r\nBook_. This magazine was followed by many others, of which Mrs.\r\nKirkland, Mrs. Osgood, Mrs. Ellet, Mrs. Sigourney, and women of like\r\ncharacter were editors or contributors. These early magazines\r\npublished many steel and colored engravings, not only of fashions, but\r\nreproductions of works of art, giving the first important impulse to\r\nthe art of engraving in this country.\r\n\r\nMany other periodicals and papers by women now appeared over the\r\ncountry. Mrs. Anne Royal edited for a quarter of a century a paper\r\ncalled _The Huntress_. In 1827 Lydia Maria Child published a paper for\r\nchildren called _The Juvenile Miscellany_, and in 1841 assumed the\r\neditorship of _The Anti-Slavery Standard_, in New York, which she ably\r\nconducted for eight years. _The Dial_, in Boston, a transcendental\r\nquarterly, edited by Margaret Fuller, made its appearance in 1840; its\r\ncontributors, among whom were Ralph Waldo Emerson, Bronson Alcott,\r\nTheodore Parker, Wm. H. Channing, and the nature-loving Thoreau, were\r\nsome of the most profound thinkers of the time. Charlotte Fowler\r\nWells, the efficient coadjutor of her brothers and husband for the\r\nlast forty-two years in the management of _The Phrenological Journal_\r\nand Publishing House of Fowler & Wells in New York city, and since her\r\nhusband's death in 1875 the sole proprietor and general manager, has\r\nalso conducted an extensive correspondence and written occasional\r\narticles for the _Journal. The Lowell Offering_, edited by the \"mill\r\ngirls\" of that manufacturing town, was established in 1840, and\r\nexercised a wide influence. It lived till 1849. Its articles were\r\nentirely written by the girl operatives, among whom may be mentioned\r\nLucy Larcom, Margaret Foley, the sculptor, who recently died in Rome;\r\nLydia S. Hall, who at one time filled an important clerkship in the\r\nUnited States Treasury, and Harriet J. Hansan, afterward the wife of\r\nW. S. Robinson (Warrington), and herself one of the present workers in\r\nWoman Suffrage. Harriet F. Curtis, author of two popular novels, and\r\nHarriet Farley, both \"mill girls,\" had entire editorial charge during\r\nthe latter part of its existence. In Vermont, Clarina Howard Nichols\r\nedited the _Windham County Democrat_ from 1843 to 1853. It was a\r\npolitical paper of a pronounced character; her husband was the\r\npublisher. Jane G. Swisshelm edited _The Saturday Visitor_, at\r\nPittsburg, Pa., in 1848. Also the same year _The True Kindred_\r\nappeared, by Rebecca Sanford, at Akron, Ohio. _The Lily_, a temperance\r\nmonthly, was started in Seneca Falls, N. Y., in 1849, by Amelia\r\nBloomer, as editor and publisher. It also advocated Woman's Rights,\r\nand attained a circulation in nearly every State and Territory of the\r\nUnion. _The Sybil_ soon followed, Dr. Lydia Sayre Hasbrook, editor;\r\nalso _The Pledge of Honor_, edited by N. M. Baker and E. Maria\r\nSheldon, Adrian, Michigan.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, _Die Frauen Zeitung_, edited by Mathilde Franceska Anneke,\r\nwas published in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1850, Lydia Jane Pierson\r\nedited a column of the _Lancaster_ (Pa.) _Gazette_; Mrs. Prewett\r\nedited the _Yazoo_ (Miss.) _Whig_, in Mississippi; and Mrs. Sheldon\r\nthe _Dollar Weekly_. In 1851, Julia Ward Howe edited, with her\r\nhusband, _The Commonwealth_, a newspaper dedicated to free thought,\r\nand zealous for the liberty of the slave. In 1851, Mrs. C. C. Bentley\r\nwas editor of the _Concord Free Press_, in Vermont, and Elizabeth\r\nAldrich of the _Genius of Liberty_, in Ohio. In 1852, Anna W. Spencer\r\nstarted the _Pioneer and Woman's Advocate_, in Providence, R. I. Its\r\nmotto was, \"Liberty, Truth, Temperance, Equality.\" It was published\r\nsemi-monthly, and advocated a better education for woman, a higher\r\nprice for her labor, the opening of new industries. It was the\r\nearliest paper established in the United States for the advocacy of\r\nWoman's Rights. In 1853, _The Una_, a paper devoted to the\r\nenfranchisement of woman, owned and edited by Paulina Wright Davis,\r\nwas first published in Providence, but afterward removed to Boston,\r\nwhere Caroline H. Dall became associate editor. In 1855, Anna McDowell\r\nfounded _The Woman's Advocate_ in Philadelphia, a paper in which, like\r\nthat of Mrs. Anna Franklin, the owner, editor, and compositors were\r\nall women. About this period many well-known literary women filled\r\neditorial chairs. Grace Greenwood started a child's paper called _The\r\nLittle Pilgrim_; Mrs. Bailey conducted the _Era_, an anti-slavery\r\npaper, in Washington, D. C., after her husband's death.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, _The Revolution_, a pronounced Woman's Rights paper, was\r\nstarted in New York city; Susan B. Anthony, publisher and proprietor,\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton and Parker Pillsbury, editors. Its motto,\r\n\"Principles, not policy; justice, not favor; men, their rights and\r\nnothing more; women, their rights and nothing less.\" In 1870 it passed\r\ninto the hands of Laura Curtis Bullard, who edited it two years with\r\nthe assistance of Phebe Carey and Augusta Larned, and in 1872 it found\r\nconsecrated burial in _The Liberal Christian_, the leading Unitarian\r\npaper in New York. From the advent of _The Revolution_ can be dated a\r\nnew era in the woman suffrage movement. Its brilliant, aggressive\r\ncolumns attracted the comments of the press, and drew the attention of\r\nthe country to the reform so ably advocated. Many other papers devoted\r\nto the discussion of woman's enfranchisement soon arose. In 1869, _The\r\nPioneer_, in San Francisco, Cal., Emily Pitts Stevens, editor and\r\nproprietor. _The Woman's Advocate_, at Dayton, O., A. J. Boyer and\r\nMiriam M. Cole, editors, started the same year. _The Sorosis_ and _The\r\nAgitator_, in Chicago, Ill., the latter owned and edited by Mary A.\r\nLivermore, and _The Woman's Advocate_, in New York, were all alike\r\nshort-lived. _L'Amérique_, a semi-weekly French paper published in\r\nChicago, Ill., by Madam Jennie d'Héricourt, and _Die Neue Zeit_, a\r\nGerman paper, in New York, by Mathilde F. Wendt, this same year, show\r\nthe interest of our foreign women citizens in the cause of their sex.\r\nIn 1870, _The Woman's Journal_ was founded in Boston, Lucy Stone,\r\nJulia Ward Howe, and Henry B. Blackwell, editors. _Woodhull and\r\nClaflin's Weekly_, an erratic paper, advocating many new ideas, was\r\nestablished in New York by Victoria Woodhull and Tennie C. Claflin,\r\neditors and proprietors. _The New Northwest_, in Portland, Oregon, in\r\n1871, Abigail Scott Duniway, editor and proprietor. _The Golden Dawn_,\r\nat San Francisco, Cal., in 1876, Mrs. Boyer, editor.\r\n\r\n_The Ballot-Box_ was started in 1876, at Toledo, O., Sarah Langdon\r\nWilliams, editor, under the auspices of the city Woman's Suffrage\r\nAssociation. It was moved to Syracuse in 1878, and is now edited by\r\nMatilda Joslyn Gage, under the name of _The National Citizen and\r\nBallot-Box_, as an exponent of the views of the National Woman\r\nSuffrage Association. Its motto, \"Self-government is a natural right,\r\nand the ballot is the method of exercising that right.\" Laura de Force\r\nGordon for some years edited a daily democratic paper in California.\r\nIn opposition to this large array of papers demanding equality for\r\nwoman, a solitary little monthly was started a few years since, in\r\nBaltimore, Md., under the auspices of Mrs. General Sherman and Mrs.\r\nAdmiral Dahlgren. It was called _The True Woman_, but soon died of\r\ninanition and inherent weakness of constitution.\r\n\r\nIn the Exposition of 1876, in Philadelphia, the _New Century_, edited\r\nand published under the auspices of the Woman's Centennial Committee,\r\nwas made-up and printed by women on a press of their own, in the\r\nWoman's Pavilion. In 1877 Mrs. Theresa Lewis started _Woman's Words_\r\nin Philadelphia. For some time, Penfield, N. Y., boasted its\r\nthirteen-year-old girl editor, in Miss Nellie Williams. Her paper, the\r\n_Penfield Enterprise_, was for three years written, set up, and\r\npublished by herself. It attained a circulation of three thousand.\r\n\r\nMany foreign papers devoted to woman's interests have been established\r\nwithin the last few years. The _Women's Suffrage Journal_, in England,\r\nLydia E. Becker, of Manchester, editor and proprietor; the\r\n_Englishwoman's Journal_, in London, edited by Caroline Ashurst Biggs;\r\n_Woman and Work_ and the _Victoria Magazine_, by Emily Faithful, are\r\namong the number. Miss Faithful's magazine having attained a\r\ncirculation of fifty thousand. _Des Droits des Femmes_, long the organ\r\nof the Swiss woman suffragists, Madame Marie Goegg, the head, was\r\nfollowed by the _Solidarite_. _L'Avenir des Femmes_, edited by M. Leon\r\nRicher, has Mlle. Maria Dairésmes, the author of a spirited reply to\r\nthe work of M. Dumas, _fils_, on Woman, as its special contributor.\r\n_L'Ésperance_, of Geneva, an Englishwoman its editor, was an early\r\nadvocate of woman's cause. _La Donna_, at Venice, edited by Signora\r\nGualberti Aläide Beccari (a well-known Italian philanthropic name);\r\n_La Cornelia_, at Florence, Signora Amelia Cunino Foliero de Luna,\r\neditor, prove Italian advancement. Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands\r\nmust not be omitted from the list of those countries which have\r\npublished Woman's Rights papers. In Lima, Peru, we find a paper edited\r\nand controlled entirely by women; its name, _Alborada_, _i.e._, the\r\nDawn, a South American prophecy and herald of that dawn of justice and\r\nequality now breaking upon the world. The Orient, likewise, shows\r\nprogress. At Bukarest, in Romaine, a paper, the _Dekebalos_, upholding\r\nthe elevation of woman, was started in 1874. The _Euridike_, at\r\nConstantinople, edited by Emile Leonzras, is of a similar character.\r\nThe _Bengalee Magazine_, devoted to the interests of Indian ladies,\r\nits editorials all from woman's pen, shows Asiatic advance.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the list of women's fashion papers, with their\r\nwomen editors and correspondents, is numerous and important. For\r\nfourteen years _Harper's Bazaar_ has been ably edited by Mary L.\r\nBooth; other papers of similar character are both owned and edited by\r\nwomen. _Madame Demorest's Monthly_, a paper that originated the vast\r\npattern business which has extended its ramifications into every part\r\nof the country and given employment to thousands of women. As\r\nillustrative of woman's continuity of purpose in newspaper work, we\r\nmay mention the fact that for fifteen years Fanny Fern did not fail to\r\nhave an article in readiness each week for the _Ledger_, and for\r\ntwenty years Jennie June (Mrs. Croly) has edited _Demorest's Monthly_\r\nand contributed to many other papers throughout the United States.\r\nMary Mapes Dodge has edited the _St. Nicholas_ the past eight years.\r\nSo important a place do women writers hold, _Harper's Monthly_\r\nasserts, that the exceptionally large prices are paid to women\r\ncontributors. The spiciest critics, reporters, and correspondents\r\nto-day, are women--Grace Greenwood, Louise Chandler Moulton, Mary\r\nClemmer. Laura C. Holloway is upon the editorial staff of the Brooklyn\r\n_Eagle_. The New York _Times_ boasts a woman (Midi Morgan) cattle\r\nreporter, one of the best judges of stock in the country. In some\r\npapers, over their own names, women edit columns on special subjects,\r\nand fill important positions on journals owned and edited by men.\r\nElizabeth Boynton Harbert edits \"The Woman's Kingdom\" in the\r\n_Inter-Ocean_, one of the leading dailies of Chicago. Mary Forney\r\nWeigley edits a social department in her father's--John W.\r\nForney--paper, the _Progress_, in Philadelphia. The political columns\r\nof many papers are prepared by women, men often receiving the credit.\r\nAmong the best editorials in the New York _Tribune_, from Margaret\r\nFuller to Lucia Gilbert Calhoun, have been from the pens of women.\r\n\r\nIf the proverb that \"the pen is mightier than the sword\" be true,\r\nwoman's skill and force in using this mightier weapon must soon change\r\nthe destinies of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD'S ANTI-SLAVERY CONVENTION, LONDON, JUNE 12, 1840.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Individualism rather than Authority--Personal appearance of\r\n     Abolitionists--Clerical attempt to silence Woman--Double battle\r\n     against the tyranny of sex and color--Bigoted Abolitionists--James\r\n     G. Birney likes freedom on a Southern plantation, but not at his\r\n     own fireside--John Bull never dreamt that Woman would answer his\r\n     call--The venerable Thomas Clarkson received by the Convention\r\n     standing--Lengthy debate on \"Female\" delegates--The \"Females\"\r\n     rejected--William Lloyd Garrison refused to sit in the Convention.\r\n\r\nIn gathering up the threads of history in the last century, and\r\nweaving its facts and philosophy together, one can trace the liberal\r\nsocial ideas, growing out of the political and religious revolutions\r\nin France, Germany, Italy, and America; and their tendency to\r\nsubstitute for the divine right of kings, priests, and orders of\r\nnobility, the higher and broader one of individual conscience and\r\njudgment in all matters pertaining to this life and that which is to\r\ncome. It is not surprising that in so marked a transition period from\r\nthe old to the new, as seen in the eighteenth century, that women,\r\ntrained to think and write and speak, should have discovered that\r\nthey, too, had some share in the new-born liberties suddenly announced\r\nto the world. That the radical political theories, propagated in\r\ndifferent countries, made their legitimate impress on the minds of\r\nwomen of the highest culture, is clearly proved by their writings and\r\nconversation. While in their ignorance, women are usually more\r\nsuperstitious, more devoutly religious than men; those trained to\r\nthought, have generally manifested more interest in political\r\nquestions, and have more frequently spoken and written on such themes,\r\nthan on those merely religious. This may be attributed, in a measure,\r\nto the fact that the tendency of woman's mind, at this stage of her\r\ndevelopment, is toward practical, rather than toward speculative\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nQuestions of political economy lie within the realm of positive\r\nknowledge; those of theology belong to the world of mysteries and\r\nabstractions, which those minds, only, that imagine they have\r\ncompassed the known, are ambitious to enter and explore. And yet, the\r\nquickening power of the Protestant Reformation roused woman, as well\r\nas man, to new and higher thought. The bold declarations of Luther,\r\nplacing individual judgment above church authority, the faith of the\r\nQuaker that the inner light was a better guide than arbitrary law, the\r\nreligious idealism of the Transcendentalists, and their teachings that\r\nsouls had no sex, had each a marked influence in developing woman's\r\nself-assertion. Such ideas making all divine revelations as veritable\r\nand momentous to one soul, as another, tended directly to equalize the\r\nmembers of the human family, and place men and women on the same plane\r\nof moral responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe revelations of science, too, analyzing and portraying the wonders\r\nand beauties of this material world, crowned with new dignity, man and\r\nwoman,--Nature's last and proudest work. Combe and Spurzheim, proving\r\nby their Phrenological discoveries that the feelings, sentiments, and\r\naffections of the soul mould and shape the skull, gave new importance\r\nto woman's thought as mother of the race. Thus each new idea in\r\nreligion, politics, science, and philosophy, tending to individualism,\r\nrather than authority, came into the world freighted with new hopes of\r\nliberty for woman.\r\n\r\nAnd when in the progress of civilization the time had fully come for\r\nthe recognition of the feminine element in humanity, women, in every\r\ncivilized country unknown to each other, began simultaneously to\r\ndemand a broader sphere of action. Thus the first public demand for\r\npolitical equality by a body of women in convention assembled, was a\r\nlink in the chain of woman's development, binding the future with the\r\npast, as complete and necessary in itself, as the events of any other\r\nperiod of her history. The ridicule of facts does not change their\r\ncharacter. Many who study the past with interest, and see the\r\nimportance of seeming trifles in helping forward great events, often\r\nfail to understand some of the best pages of history made under their\r\nown eyes. Hence the woman suffrage movement has not yet been accepted\r\nas the legitimate outgrowth of American ideas--a component part of the\r\nhistory of our republic--but is falsely considered the willful\r\noutburst of a few unbalanced minds, whose ideas can never be realized\r\nunder any form of government.\r\n\r\nAmong the immediate causes that led to the demand for the equal\r\npolitical rights of women, in this country, we may note three:\r\n\r\n1. The discussion in several of the State Legislatures on the property\r\nrights of married women, which, heralded by the press with comments\r\ngrave and gay, became the topic of general interest around many\r\nfashionable dinner-tables, and at many humble firesides. In this way\r\nall phases of the question were touched upon, involving the\r\nrelations of the sexes, and gradually widening to all human\r\ninterests--political, religious, civil, and social. The press and\r\npulpit became suddenly vigilant in marking out woman's sphere, while\r\nwoman herself seemed equally vigilant in her efforts to step outside\r\nthe prescribed limits.\r\n\r\n2. A great educational work was accomplished by the able lectures of\r\nFrances Wright, on political, religious, and social questions.\r\nErnestine L. Rose, following in her wake, equally liberal in her\r\nreligious opinions, and equally well informed on the science of\r\ngovernment, helped to deepen and perpetuate the impression Frances\r\nWright had made on the minds of unprejudiced hearers.\r\n\r\n3. And above all other causes of the \"Woman Suffrage Movement,\" was\r\nthe Anti-Slavery struggle in this country. The ranks of the\r\nAbolitionists were composed of the most eloquent orators, the ablest\r\nlogicians, men and women of the purest moral character and best minds\r\nin the nation. They were usually spoken of in the early days as \"an\r\nilliterate, ill-mannered, poverty-stricken, crazy set of long-haired\r\nAbolitionists.\" While the fact is, some of the most splendid specimens\r\nof manhood and womanhood, in physical appearance, in culture,\r\nrefinement, and knowledge of polite life, were found among the early\r\nAbolitionists. James G. Birney, John Pierpont, Gerrit Smith, Wendell\r\nPhillips, Charles Sumner, Maria Weston Chapman, Helen Garrison, Ann\r\nGreen Phillips, Abby Kelly, Paulina Wright Davis, Lucretia Mott, were\r\nall remarkably fine-looking.\r\n\r\nIn the early Anti-Slavery conventions, the broad principles of human\r\nrights were so exhaustively discussed, justice, liberty, and equality,\r\nso clearly taught, that the women who crowded to listen, readily\r\nlearned the lesson of freedom for themselves, and early began to take\r\npart in the debates and business affairs of all associations. Woman\r\nnot only felt every pulsation of man's heart for freedom, and by her\r\nenthusiasm inspired the glowing eloquence that maintained him through\r\nthe struggle, but earnestly advocated with her own lips human freedom\r\nand equality. When Angelina and Sarah Grimke began to lecture in New\r\nEngland, their audiences were at first composed entirely of women, but\r\ngentlemen, hearing of their eloquence and power, soon began timidly to\r\nslip into the back seats, one by one. And before the public were\r\naroused to the dangerous innovation, these women were speaking in\r\ncrowded, promiscuous assemblies. The clergy opposed to the abolition\r\nmovement first took alarm, and issued a pastoral letter, warning their\r\ncongregations against the influence of such women. The clergy\r\nidentified with anti-slavery associations took alarm also, and the\r\ninitiative steps to silence the women, and to deprive them of the\r\nright to vote in the business meetings, were soon taken. This action\r\nculminated in a division in the Anti-Slavery Association. In the\r\nannual meeting in May, 1840, a formal vote was taken on the\r\nappointment of Abby Kelly on a business committee and was sustained by\r\nover one hundred majority in favor of woman's right to take part in\r\nthe proceedings of the Society. Pending the discussion, clergymen in\r\nthe opposition went through the audience, _urging every woman who\r\nagreed with them, to vote against_ the motion, thus asking them to do\r\nthen and there, what with fervid eloquence, on that very occasion,\r\nthey had declared a sin against God and Scripture for them to do\r\nanywhere. As soon as the vote was announced, and Abby Kelly's right on\r\nthe business committee decided, the men, two of whom were clergymen,\r\nasked to be excused from serving on the committee.\r\n\r\nThus Sarah and Angelina Grimke and Abby Kelly, in advocating liberty\r\nfor the black race, were early compelled to defend the right of free\r\nspeech for themselves. They had the double battle to fight against the\r\ntyranny of sex and color at the same time, in which, however, they\r\nwere well sustained by the able pens of Lydia Maria Child and Maria\r\nWeston Chapman. Their opponents were found not only in the ranks of\r\nthe New England clergy, but among the most bigoted Abolitionists in\r\nGreat Britain and the United States. Many a man who advocated equality\r\nmost eloquently for a Southern plantation, could not tolerate it at\r\nhis own fireside.\r\n\r\nThe question of woman's right to speak, vote, and serve on committees,\r\nnot only precipitated the division in the ranks of the American\r\nAnti-Slavery Society, in 1840, but it disturbed the peace of the\r\nWorld's Anti-Slavery Convention, held that same year in London. The\r\ncall for that Convention invited delegates from all Anti-Slavery\r\norganizations. Accordingly several American societies saw fit to send\r\nwomen, as delegates, to represent them in that august assembly. But\r\nafter going three thousand miles to attend a World's Convention, it\r\nwas discovered that women formed no part of the constituent elements\r\nof the moral world. In summoning the friends of the slave from all\r\nparts of the two hemispheres to meet in London, John Bull never\r\ndreamed that woman, too, would answer to his call. Imagine then the\r\ncommotion in the conservative anti-slavery circles in England, when it\r\nwas known that half a dozen of those terrible women who had spoken to\r\npromiscuous assemblies, voted on men and measures, prayed and\r\npetitioned against slavery, women who had been mobbed, ridiculed by\r\nthe press, and denounced by the pulpit, who had been the cause of\r\nsetting all American Abolitionists by the ears, and split their ranks\r\nasunder, were on their way to England. Their fears of these formidable\r\nand belligerent women must have been somewhat appeased when Lucretia\r\nMott, Sarah Pugh, Abby Kimber, Elizabeth Neal, Mary Grew, of\r\nPhiladelphia, in modest Quaker costume, Ann Green Phillips, Emily\r\nWinslow, and Abby Southwick, of Boston, all women of refinement and\r\neducation, and several, still in their twenties, landed at last on the\r\nsoil of Great Britain. Many who had awaited their coming with much\r\ntrepidation, gave a sigh of relief, on being introduced to Lucretia\r\nMott, learning that she represented the most dangerous elements in the\r\ndelegation. The American clergymen who had landed a few days before,\r\nhad been busily engaged in fanning the English prejudices into active\r\nhostility against the admission of these women to the Convention. In\r\nevery circle of Abolitionists this was the theme, and the discussion\r\ngrew more bitter, personal, and exasperating every hour.\r\n\r\nThe 12th of June dawned bright and beautiful on these discordant\r\nelements, and at an early hour anti-slavery delegates from different\r\ncountries wended their way through the crooked streets of London to\r\nFreemasons' Hall. Entering the vestibule, little groups might be seen\r\ngathered here and there, earnestly discussing the best disposition to\r\nmake of those women delegates from America. The excitement and\r\nvehemence of protest and denunciation could not have been greater, if\r\nthe news had come that the French were about to invade England. In\r\nvain those obdurate women had been conjured to withhold their\r\ncredentials, and not thrust a question that must produce such discord\r\non the Convention. Lucretia Mott, in her calm, firm manner, insisted\r\nthat the delegates had no discretionary power in the proposed action,\r\nand the responsibility of accepting or rejecting them must rest on the\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o'clock, the spacious Hall being filled, the Convention was\r\ncalled to order. The venerable Thomas Clarkson, who was to be\r\nPresident, on entering, was received by the large audience standing;\r\nowing to his feeble health, the chairman requested that there should\r\nbe no other demonstrations. As soon as Thomas Clarkson withdrew,\r\nWendell Phillips made the following motion:\r\n\r\n     \"That a Committee of five be appointed to prepare a correct list\r\n     of the members of this Convention, with instructions to include\r\n     in such list, all persons bearing credentials from any\r\n     Anti-Slavery body.\"\r\n\r\nThis motion at once opened the debate on the admission of women\r\ndelegates.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Phillips: When the call reached America we found that it was\r\n     an invitation to the friends of the slave of every nation and of\r\n     every clime. Massachusetts has for several years acted on the\r\n     principle of admitting women to an equal seat with men, in the\r\n     deliberative bodies of anti-slavery societies. When the\r\n     Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society received that paper, it\r\n     interpreted it, as it was its duty, in its broadest and most\r\n     liberal sense. If there be any other paper, emanating from the\r\n     Committee, limiting to one sex the qualification of membership,\r\n     there is no proof; and, as an individual, I have no knowledge\r\n     that such a paper ever reached Massachusetts. We stand here in\r\n     consequence of your invitation, and knowing our custom, as it\r\n     must be presumed you did, we had a right to interpret \"friends of\r\n     the slave,\" to include women as well as men. In such\r\n     circumstances, we do not think it just or equitable to that\r\n     State, nor to America in general, that, after the trouble, the\r\n     sacrifice, the self-devotion of a part of those who leave their\r\n     families and kindred and occupations in their own land, to come\r\n     three thousand miles to attend this World's Convention, they\r\n     should be refused a place in its deliberations.\r\n\r\n     One of the Committee who issued the call, said: As soon as we\r\n     heard the liberal interpretation Americans had given to our first\r\n     invitation, we issued another as early as Feb. 15, in which the\r\n     description of those who are to form the Convention is set forth\r\n     as consisting of \"gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\n     Dr. Bowring: I think the custom of excluding females is more\r\n     honored in its breach than in its observance. In this country\r\n     sovereign rule is placed in the hands of a female, and one who\r\n     has been exercising her great and benignant influence in opposing\r\n     slavery by sanctioning, no doubt, the presence of her illustrious\r\n     consort at an anti-slavery meeting. We are associated with a body\r\n     of Christians (Quakers) who have given to their women a great,\r\n     honorable, and religious prominence. I look upon this delegation\r\n     from America as one of the most interesting, the most\r\n     encouraging, and the most delightful symptoms of the times. I can\r\n     not believe that we shall refuse to welcome gratefully the\r\n     co-operation which is offered us.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. J. Burnet, an Englishman, made a most touching appeal to the\r\nAmerican ladies, to conform to English prejudices and custom, so far\r\nas to withdraw their credentials, as it never did occur to the British\r\nand Foreign Anti-Slavery Society that they were inviting ladies. It is\r\nbetter, said he, that this Convention should be dissolved at this\r\nmoment than this motion should be adopted.\r\n\r\n     The Rev. Henry Grew, of Philadelphia: The reception of women as a\r\n     part of this Convention would, in the view of many, be not only a\r\n     violation of the customs of England, but of the ordinance of\r\n     Almighty God, who has a right to appoint our services to His\r\n     sovereign will.\r\n\r\n     Rev. Eben Galusha, New York: In support of the other side of this\r\n     question, reference has been made to your Sovereign. I most\r\n     cordially approve of her policy and sound wisdom, and commend to\r\n     the consideration of our American female friends who are so\r\n     deeply interested in the subject, the example of your noble\r\n     Queen, who by sanctioning her consort, His Royal Highness Prince\r\n     Albert, in taking the chair on an occasion not dissimilar to\r\n     this, showed her sense of propriety by putting her Head foremost\r\n     in an assembly of gentlemen. I have no objection to woman's being\r\n     the neck to turn the head aright, but do not wish to see her\r\n     assume the place of the head.\r\n\r\n     George Bradburn, of Mass.: We are told that it would be outraging\r\n     the customs of England to allow women to sit in this Convention.\r\n     I have a great respect for the customs of old England. But I ask,\r\n     gentlemen, if it be right to set up the customs and habits, not\r\n     to say prejudices of Englishmen, as a standard for the government\r\n     on this occasion of Americans, and of persons belonging to\r\n     several other independent nations. I can see neither reason nor\r\n     policy in so doing. Besides, I deprecate the principle of the\r\n     objection. In America it would exclude from our conventions all\r\n     persons of color, for there customs, habits, tastes, prejudices,\r\n     would be outraged by _their_ admission. And I do not wish to be\r\n     deprived of the aid of those who have done so much for this\r\n     cause, for the purpose of gratifying any mere custom or\r\n     prejudice. Women have furnished most essential aid in\r\n     accomplishing what has been done in the State of Massachusetts.\r\n     If, in the Legislature of that State, I have been able to do\r\n     anything in furtherance of that cause, by keeping on my legs\r\n     eight or ten hours day after day, it was mainly owing to the\r\n     valuable assistance I derived from the women. And shall such\r\n     women be denied seats in this Convention? My friend George\r\n     Thompson, yonder, can testify to the faithful services rendered\r\n     to this cause by those same women. He can tell you that when\r\n     \"gentlemen of property and standing\" in \"broad day\" and\r\n     \"broadcloth,\" undertook to drive him from Boston, putting his\r\n     life in peril, it was our women who made their own persons a\r\n     bulwark of protection around him. And shall such women be refused\r\n     seats here in a Convention seeking the emancipation of slaves\r\n     throughout the world? What a misnomer to call this a World's\r\n     Convention of Abolitionists, when some of the oldest and most\r\n     thorough-going Abolitionists in the world are denied the right to\r\n     be represented in it by delegates of their own choice.\r\n\r\nAnd thus for the space of half an hour did Mr. Bradburn, six feet high\r\nand well-proportioned, with vehement gesticulations and voice of\r\nthunder, bombard the prejudices of England and the hypocrisies of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n     George Thompson: I have listened to the arguments advanced on\r\n     this side and on that side of this vexed question. I listened\r\n     with profound attention to the arguments of Mr. Burnet, expecting\r\n     that from him, as I was justified in expecting, I should hear the\r\n     strongest arguments that could be adduced on this, or any other\r\n     subject upon which he might be pleased to employ his talents, or\r\n     which he might adorn with his eloquence. What are his arguments?\r\n     Let it be premised, as I speak in the presence of American\r\n     friends, that that gentleman is one of the best controversialists\r\n     in the country, and one of the best authorities upon questions of\r\n     business, points of order, and matters of principle. What are\r\n     the strongest arguments, which one of the greatest champions on\r\n     any question which he chooses to espouse, has brought forward?\r\n     They are these:\r\n\r\n          1st. That English phraseology should be construed according\r\n          to English usage.\r\n\r\n          2d. That it was never contemplated by the anti-slavery\r\n          committee that ladies should occupy a seat in this\r\n          Convention.\r\n\r\n          3d. That the ladies of England are not here as delegates.\r\n\r\n          4th. That he has no desire to offer an affront to the ladies\r\n          now present.\r\n\r\n     Here I presume are the strongest arguments the gentleman has to\r\n     adduce, for he never fails to use to the best advantage the\r\n     resources within his reach. I look at these arguments, and I\r\n     place on the other side of the question, the fact that there are\r\n     in this assembly ladies who present themselves as delegates from\r\n     the oldest societies in America. I expected that Mr. Burnet\r\n     would, as he was bound to do, if he intended to offer a\r\n     successful opposition to their introduction into this Convention,\r\n     grapple with the constitutionality of their credentials. I\r\n     thought he would come to the question of title. I thought he\r\n     would dispute the right of a convention assembled in\r\n     Philadelphia, for the abolition of slavery, consisting of\r\n     delegates from different States in the Union, and comprised of\r\n     individuals of both sexes, to send one or all of the ladies now\r\n     in our presence. I thought he would grapple with the fact, that\r\n     those ladies came to us who have no slavery from a country in\r\n     which they have slaves, as the representatives of two millions\r\n     and a half of captives. Let gentlemen, when they come to vote on\r\n     this question, remember, that in receiving or rejecting these\r\n     ladies, they acknowledge or despise [loud cries of No, no]. I ask\r\n     gentlemen, who shout \"no,\" if they know the application I am\r\n     about to make. I did not mean to say you would despise the\r\n     ladies, but that you would, by your vote, acknowledge or despise\r\n     the parties whose cause they espouse. It appears we are prepared\r\n     to sanction ladies in the employment of all means, so long as\r\n     they are confessedly unequal with ourselves. It seems that the\r\n     grand objection to their appearance amongst us is this, that it\r\n     would be placing them on a footing of equality, and that would be\r\n     contrary to principle and custom. For years the women of America\r\n     have carried their banner in the van, while the men have humbly\r\n     followed in the rear. It is well known that the National Society\r\n     solicited Angelina Grimke to undertake a mission through New\r\n     England, to rouse the attention of the women to the wrongs of\r\n     slavery, and that that distinguished woman displayed her talents\r\n     not only in the drawing-room, but before the Senate of\r\n     Massachusetts. Let us contrast our conduct with that of the\r\n     Senators and Representatives of Massachusetts who did not disdain\r\n     to hear her. It was in consequence of her exertions, which\r\n     received the warmest approval of the National Society, that that\r\n     interest sprung up which has awakened such an intense feeling\r\n     throughout America. Then with reference to efficient management,\r\n     the most vigorous anti-slavery societies are those which are\r\n     managed by ladies.\r\n\r\n     If now, after the expression of opinion on various sides, the\r\n     motion should be withdrawn with the consent of all parties, I\r\n     should be glad. But when I look at the arguments against the\r\n     title of these women to sit amongst us, I can not but consider\r\n     them frivolous and groundless. The simple question before us is,\r\n     whether these ladies, taking into account their credentials, the\r\n     talent they have displayed, the sufferings they have endured, the\r\n     journey they have undertaken, should be acknowledged by us, in\r\n     virtue of these high titles, or should be shut out for the\r\n     reasons stated.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Phillips, being urged on all sides to withdraw his motion,\r\n     said: It has been hinted very respectfully by two or three\r\n     speakers that the delegates from the State of Massachusetts\r\n     should withdraw their credentials, or the motion before the\r\n     meeting. The one appears to me to be equivalent to the other. If\r\n     this motion be withdrawn we must have another. I would merely ask\r\n     whether any man can suppose that the delegates from Massachusetts\r\n     or Pennsylvania can take upon their shoulders the responsibility\r\n     of withdrawing that list of delegates from your table, which\r\n     their constituents told them to place there, and whom they\r\n     sanctioned as their fit representatives, because this Convention\r\n     tells us that it is not ready to meet the ridicule of the morning\r\n     papers, and to stand up against the customs of England. In\r\n     America we listen to no such arguments. If we had done so we had\r\n     never been here as Abolitionists. It is the custom there not to\r\n     admit colored men into respectable society, and we have been told\r\n     again and again that we are outraging the decencies of humanity\r\n     when we permit colored men to sit by our side. When we have\r\n     submitted to brick-bats, and the tar tub and feathers in America,\r\n     rather than yield to the custom prevalent there of not admitting\r\n     colored brethren into our friendship, shall we yield to parallel\r\n     custom or prejudice against women in Old England? We can not\r\n     yield this question if we would; for it is a matter of\r\n     conscience. But we would not yield it on the ground of\r\n     expediency. In doing so we should feel that we were striking off\r\n     the right arm of our enterprise. We could not go back to America\r\n     to ask for any aid from the women of Massachusetts if we had\r\n     deserted them, when they chose to send out their own sisters as\r\n     their representatives here. We could not go back to Massachusetts\r\n     and assert the unchangeableness of spirit on the question. We\r\n     have argued it over and over again, and decided it time after\r\n     time, in every society in the land, in favor of the women. We\r\n     have not changed by crossing the water. We stand here the\r\n     advocates of the same principle that we contend for in America.\r\n     We think it right for women to sit by our side there, and we\r\n     think it right for them to do the same here. We ask the\r\n     Convention to admit them; if they do not choose to grant it, the\r\n     responsibility rests on their shoulders. Massachusetts can not\r\n     turn aside, or succumb to any prejudices or customs even in the\r\n     land she looks upon with so much reverence as the land of\r\n     Wilberforce, of Clarkson, and of O'Connell. It is a matter of\r\n     conscience, and British virtue ought not to ask us to yield.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Ashurst: You are convened to influence society upon a subject\r\n     connected with the kindliest feelings of our nature; and being\r\n     the first assembly met to shake hands with other nations, and\r\n     employ your combined efforts to annihilate slavery throughout the\r\n     world, are you to commence by saying, you will take away the\r\n     rights of one-half of creation! This is the principle which you\r\n     are putting forward.\r\n\r\n     The Rev. A. Harvey, of Glasgow: It was stated by a brother from\r\n     America, that with him it is a matter of conscience, and it is a\r\n     question of conscience with me too. I have certain views in\r\n     relation to the teaching of the Word of God, and of the\r\n     particular sphere in which woman is to act. I must say, whether I\r\n     am right in my interpretations of the Word of God or not, that my\r\n     own decided convictions are, if I were to give a vote in favor of\r\n     females, sitting and deliberating in such an assembly as this,\r\n     that I should be acting in opposition to the plain teaching of\r\n     the Word of God. I may be wrong, but I have a conscience on the\r\n     subject, and I am sure there are a number present of the same\r\n     mind.\r\n\r\n     Captain Wanchope, R. N., delegate from Carlisle: I entreat the\r\n     ladies not to push this question too far. I wish to know whether\r\n     our friends from America are to cast off England altogether. Have\r\n     we not given £20,000,000 of our money for the purpose of doing\r\n     away with the abominations of slavery? Is not that proof that we\r\n     are in earnest about it?\r\n\r\n     James C. Fuller: One friend said that this question should have\r\n     been settled on the other side of the Atlantic. Why, it was there\r\n     decided in favor of woman a year ago.\r\n\r\n     James Gillespie Birney: It has been stated that the right of\r\n     women to sit and act in all respects as men in our anti-slavery\r\n     associations, was decided in the affirmative at the annual\r\n     meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society in May, 1839. It is\r\n     true the claim was so decided on that occasion, but not by a\r\n     large majority; whilst it is also true that the majority was\r\n     swelled by the votes of the women themselves. I have just\r\n     received a letter from a gentleman in New York (Louis Tappan),\r\n     communicating the fact, that the persistence of the friends of\r\n     promiscuous female representation in pressing that practice on\r\n     the American Anti-Slavery Society, at its annual meeting on the\r\n     twelfth of last month, had caused such disagreement among the\r\n     members present, that he and others who viewed the subject as he\r\n     did, were then deliberating on measures for seceding from the old\r\n     organization.\r\n\r\n     Rev. C. Stout: My vote is that we confirm the list of delegates,\r\n     that we take votes on that as an amendment, and that we\r\n     henceforth entertain this question no more. Are we not met here\r\n     pledged to sacrifice all but everything, in order that we may do\r\n     something against slavery, and shall we be divided on this\r\n     _paltry question_ and suffer the whole tide of benevolence to be\r\n     stopped by a _straw_? No! You talk of being men, then be men!\r\n     Consider what is worthy of your attention.\r\n\r\n     Rev. Dr. Morrison: I feel, I believe, as our brethren from\r\n     America and many English friends do at this moment, that we are\r\n     treading on the brink of a precipice; and that precipice is the\r\n     awaking in our bosoms by this discussion, feelings that will not\r\n     only be averse to the great object for which we have assembled,\r\n     but inconsistent, perhaps, in some degree, with the Christian\r\n     spirit which, I trust, will pervade all meetings connected with\r\n     the Anti-Slavery cause. We have been unanimous against the common\r\n     foe, but we are this day in danger of creating division among\r\n     heartfelt friends. Will our American brethren put us in this\r\n     position? Will they keep up a discussion in which the delicacy,\r\n     the honor, the respectability of those excellent females who have\r\n     come from the Western world are concerned? I tremble at the\r\n     thought of discussing the question in the presence of these\r\n     ladies--for whom I entertain the most profound respect--and I am\r\n     bold to say, that but for the introduction of the question of\r\n     woman's rights, it would be impossible for the shrinking nature\r\n     of woman to subject itself to the infliction of such a discussion\r\n     as this.\r\n\r\nAs the hour was late, and as the paltry arguments of the opposition\r\nwere unworthy much consideration--as the reader will see from the\r\nspecimens given--Mr. Phillips' reply was brief, consisting of the\r\ncorrection of a few mistakes made by different speakers. The vote was\r\ntaken, and the women excluded as delegates of the Convention, by an\r\noverwhelming majority.\r\n\r\n     George Thompson: I hope, as the question is now decided, that Mr.\r\n     Phillips will give us the assurance that we shall proceed with\r\n     one heart and one mind.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Phillips replied: I have no doubt of it. There is no\r\n     unpleasant feeling in our minds. I have no doubt the women will\r\n     sit with as much interest behind the bar[6] as though the\r\n     original proposition had been carried in the affirmative. All we\r\n     asked was an expression of opinion, and, having obtained it, we\r\n     shall now act with the utmost cordiality.\r\n\r\nWould there have been no unpleasant feelings in Wendell Phillips'\r\nmind, had Frederick Douglass and Robert Purvis been refused their\r\nseats in a convention of reformers under similar circumstances? and,\r\nhad _they_ listened one entire day to debates on their peculiar\r\nfitness for plantation life, and unfitness for the forum and public\r\nassemblies, and been rejected as delegates on the ground of color,\r\ncould Wendell Phillips have so far mistaken their real feelings, and\r\nbeen so insensible to the insults offered them, as to have told a\r\nConvention of men who had just trampled on their most sacred rights,\r\nthat \"they would no doubt sit with as much interest behind the bar, as\r\nin the Convention\"? To stand in that august assembly and maintain the\r\nunpopular heresy of woman's equality was a severe ordeal for a young\r\nman to pass through, and Wendell Phillips, who accepted the odium of\r\npresenting this question to the Convention, and thus earned the\r\nsincere gratitude of all womankind, might be considered as above\r\ncriticism, though he may have failed at one point to understand the\r\nfeelings of woman. The fact is important to mention, however, to show\r\nthat it is almost impossible for the most liberal of men to\r\nunderstand what liberty means for woman. This sacrifice of human\r\nrights, by men who had assembled from all quarters of the globe to\r\nproclaim universal emancipation, was offered up in the presence of\r\nsuch women as Lady Byron, Anna Jameson, Amelia Opie, Mary Howitt,\r\nElizabeth Fry, and our own Lucretia Mott. The clergy with few\r\nexceptions were bitter in their opposition. Although, as\r\nAbolitionists, they had been compelled to fight both Church and Bible\r\nto prove the black man's right to liberty, conscience forbade them to\r\nstretch those sacred limits far enough to give equal liberty to woman.\r\n\r\nThe leading men who championed the cause of the measure in the\r\nConvention and voted in the affirmative, were Wendell Phillips, George\r\nThompson, George Bradburn, Mr. Ashurst, Dr. Bowring, and Henry B.\r\nStanton. Though Daniel O'Connell was not present during the\r\ndiscussion, having passed out with the President, yet in his first\r\nspeech, he referred to the rejected delegates, paying a beautiful\r\ntribute to woman's influence, and saying he should have been happy to\r\nhave added the right word in the right place and to have recorded his\r\nvote in favor of human equality..\r\n\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, having been delayed at sea, arrived too late\r\nto take part in the debates. Learning on his arrival that the women\r\nhad been rejected as delegates, he declined to take his seat in the\r\nConvention; and, through all those interesting discussions on a\r\nsubject so near his heart, lasting ten days, he remained a silent\r\nspectator in the gallery. What a sacrifice for a principle so dimly\r\nseen by the few, and so ignorantly ridiculed by the many! Brave, noble\r\nGarrison! May this one act keep his memory fresh forever in the hearts\r\nof his countrywomen!\r\n\r\nThe one Abolitionist who sustained Mr. Garrison's position, and sat\r\nwith him in the gallery, was Nathaniel P. Rogers, editor of the\r\n_Herald of Freedom_, in Concord, New Hampshire, who died in the midst\r\nof the Anti-Slavery struggle. However, the debates in the Convention\r\nhad the effect of rousing English minds to thought on the tyranny of\r\nsex, and American minds to the importance of some definite action\r\ntoward woman's emancipation.\r\n\r\nAs Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton wended their way arm in\r\narm down Great Queen Street that night, reviewing the exciting scenes\r\nof the day, they agreed to hold a woman's rights convention on their\r\nreturn to America, as the men to whom they had just listened had\r\nmanifested their great need of some education on that question. Thus a\r\nmissionary work for the emancipation of woman in \"the land of the\r\nfree and the home of the brave\" was then and there inaugurated. As the\r\nladies were not allowed to speak in the Convention, they kept up a\r\nbrisk fire morning, noon, and night at their hotel on the unfortunate\r\ngentlemen who were domiciled at the same house. Mr. Birney, with his\r\nluggage, promptly withdrew after the first encounter, to some more\r\ncongenial haven of rest, while the Rev. Nathaniel Colver, from Boston,\r\nwho always fortified himself with six eggs well beaten in a large bowl\r\nat breakfast, to the horror of his host and a circle of æsthetic\r\nfriends, stood his ground to the last--his physical proportions being\r\nhis shield and buckler, and his Bible (with Colver's commentaries) his\r\nweapon of defence.[7]\r\n\r\nThe movement for woman's suffrage, both in England and America, may be\r\ndated from this World's Anti-Slavery Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] The ladies of the Convention were fenced off behind a bar and\r\ncurtain, similar to those used in churches to screen the choir from\r\nthe public gaze.\r\n\r\n[7] Some of the English clergy, dancing around with Bible in hand,\r\nshaking it in the faces of the opposition, grew so vehement, that one\r\nwould really have thought that they held a commission from high heaven\r\nas the possessors of all truth, and that all progress in human affairs\r\nwas to be squared by their interpretation of Scripture. At last George\r\nBradburn, exasperated with their narrowness and bigotry, sprang to the\r\nfloor, and stretching himself to his full height, said: \"Prove to me,\r\ngentlemen, that your Bible sanctions the slavery of woman--the\r\ncomplete subjugation of one-half the race to the other--and I should\r\nfeel that the best work I could do for humanity would be to make a\r\ngrand bonfire of every Bible in the Universe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The First Woman's Rights Convention, Seneca Falls, July 19-20,\r\n     1848--Property Rights of Women secured--Judge Fine, George\r\n     Geddes, and Mr. Hadley pushed the Bill through--Danger of\r\n     meddling with well-settled conditions of domestic happiness--Mrs.\r\n     Barbara Hertell's will--Richard Hunt's tea-table--The eventful\r\n     day--James Mott President--Declaration of sentiments--Convention\r\n     in Rochester--Clergy again in opposition with Bible arguments.\r\n\r\nNew York with its metropolis, fine harbors, great lakes and rivers;\r\nits canals and railroads uniting the extremest limits, and controlling\r\nthe commerce of the world; with its wise statesmen and wily\r\npoliticians, long holding the same relation to the nation at large\r\nthat Paris is said to hold to France, has been proudly called by her\r\nsons and daughters the Empire State.\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting fact in her history, to woman, is that she\r\nwas the first State to emancipate wives from the slavery of the old\r\ncommon law of England, and to secure to them equal property rights.\r\nThis occurred in 1848. Various bills and petitions, with reference to\r\nthe civil rights of woman, had been under discussion twelve years, and\r\nthe final passage of the property bill was due in no small measure to\r\ntwo facts. 1st. The constitutional convention in 1847, which compelled\r\nthe thinking people of the State, and especially the members of the\r\nconvention, to the serious consideration of the fundamental principles\r\nof government. As in the revision of a Constitution the State is for\r\nthe time being resolved into its original elements in recognizing the\r\nequality of all the people, one would naturally think that a chance\r\nray of justice might have fallen aslant the wrongs of woman and\r\nbrought to the surface some champion in that convention, especially as\r\nsome aggravated cases of cruelty in families of wealth and position\r\nhad just at that time aroused the attention of influential men to the\r\nwhole question. 2d. Among the Dutch aristocracy of the State there was\r\na vast amount of dissipation; and as married women could hold neither\r\nproperty nor children under the common law, solid, thrifty Dutch\r\nfathers were daily confronted with the fact that the inheritance of\r\ntheir daughters, carefully accumulated, would at marriage pass into\r\nthe hands of dissipated, impecunious husbands, reducing them and their\r\nchildren to poverty and dependence. Hence this influential class of\r\ncitizens heartily seconded the efforts of reformers, then demanding\r\nequal property rights in the marriage relation. Thus a wise\r\nselfishness on one side, and principle on the other, pushed the\r\nconservatives and radicals into the same channel, and both alike found\r\nanchor in the statute law of 1848. This was the death-blow to the old\r\nBlackstone code for married women in this country, and ever since\r\nlegislation has been slowly, but steadily, advancing toward their\r\ncomplete equality.\r\n\r\nDesiring to know who prompted the legislative action on the Property\r\nBill in 1848, and the names of our champions who carried it\r\nsuccessfully through after twelve years of discussion and petitioning,\r\na letter of inquiry was addressed to the Hon. George Geddes of the\r\ntwenty-second district--at that time Senator--and received the\r\nfollowing reply:\r\n\r\n                                     FAIRMOUNT, ONONDAGA CO., N. Y.,}\r\n                                                _November 25, 1880_.}\r\n\r\n     MRS. MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE:\r\n\r\n     _Dear Madam_:--I was much gratified at the receipt of your letter\r\n     of the 22d inst., making inquiries into the history of the law of\r\n     1848 in regard to married women holding property independently of\r\n     their husbands. That the \"truth of history\" may be made plain, I\r\n     have looked over the journals of the Senate and Assembly, and\r\n     taken full notes, which I request you to publish, if you put any\r\n     part of this letter in print.\r\n\r\n     I have very distinct recollections of the whole history of this\r\n     very radical measure. Judge Fine, of St. Lawrence, was its\r\n     originator, and he gave me his reasons for introducing the bill.\r\n     He said that he married a lady who had some property of her own,\r\n     which he had, all his life, tried to keep distinct from his, that\r\n     she might have the benefit of her own, in the event of any\r\n     disaster happening to him in pecuniary matters. He had found much\r\n     difficulty, growing out of the old laws, in this effort to\r\n     protect his wife's interests.\r\n\r\n     Judge Fine was a stately man, and of general conservative\r\n     tendencies, just the one to hold on to the past, but he was a\r\n     just man, and did not allow his practice as a lawyer, or his\r\n     experience on the bench, to obscure his sense of right. I\r\n     followed him, glad of such a leader.\r\n\r\n     I, too, had special reasons for desiring this change in the law.\r\n     I had a young daughter, who, in the then condition of my health,\r\n     was quite likely to be left in tender years without a father, and\r\n     I very much desired to protect her in the little property I might\r\n     be able to leave. I had an elaborate will drawn by my old law\r\n     preceptor, Vice-Chancellor Lewis H. Sandford, creating a trust\r\n     with all the care and learning he could bring to my aid. But when\r\n     the elaborate paper was finished, neither he or I felt satisfied\r\n     with it. When the law of 1848 was passed, all I had to do was to\r\n     burn this will.\r\n\r\n     In this connection I wish to say that the Speaker of the\r\n     Assembly, Mr. Hadley, gave aid in the passage of this law that\r\n     was essential. Very near the end of the session of the\r\n     Legislature he assured me that if the bill passed the Senate, he\r\n     would see that it passed the House. By examining my notes of the\r\n     Assembly's action, you will see that the bill never went to a\r\n     committee of the whole in that body, but was sent directly to a\r\n     select committee to report complete. It was the power of the\r\n     Speaker that in this summary manner overrode the usual\r\n     legislative forms. The only reason Mr. Hadley gave me for his\r\n     zeal in this matter, was that it was a good bill and ought to\r\n     pass.\r\n\r\n     I believe this law originated with Judge Fine, without any\r\n     outside prompting. On the third day of the session he gave notice\r\n     of his intention to introduce it, and only one petition was\r\n     presented in favor of the bill, and that came from Syracuse, and\r\n     was due to the action of my personal friends--I presented it\r\n     nearly two months after the bill had been introduced to the\r\n     Senate.\r\n\r\n     The reception of the bill by the Senate showed unlooked-for\r\n     support as well as opposition. The measure was so radical, so\r\n     extreme, that even its friends had doubts; but the moment any\r\n     important amendment was offered, up rose the whole question of\r\n     woman's proper place in society, in the family, and everywhere.\r\n     We all felt that the laws regulating married women's, as well as\r\n     married men's rights, demanded careful revision and adaptation to\r\n     our times and to our civilization. But no such revision could be\r\n     perfected then, nor has it been since. We meant to strike a hard\r\n     blow, and if possible shake the old system of laws to their\r\n     foundations, and leave it to other times and wiser councils to\r\n     perfect a new system.\r\n\r\n     We had in the Senate a man of matured years, who had never had a\r\n     wife. He was a lawyer well-read in the old books, and versed in\r\n     the adjudications which had determined that husband and wife were\r\n     but one person, and the husband that person; and he expressed\r\n     great fears in regard to meddling with this well-settled\r\n     condition of domestic happiness. This champion of the past made\r\n     long and very able arguments to show the ruin this law must work,\r\n     but he voted for the bill in the final decision.\r\n\r\n     The bill hung along in Committee of the Whole until March 21st,\r\n     when its great opponent being absent, I moved its reference to a\r\n     select Committee, with power to report it complete; that is,\r\n     matured ready for its passage. So the bill was out of the arena\r\n     of debate, and on my motion was ordered to its third reading.\r\n\r\n     In reply to your inquiries in regard to debates that preceded the\r\n     action of 1848, I must say I know of none, and I am quite sure\r\n     that in our long discussions no allusion was made to anything of\r\n     the kind. Great measures often occupy the thoughts of men and\r\n     women, long before they take substantial form and become things\r\n     of life, and I shall not dispute any one who says that this\r\n     reform had been thought of before 1848. But I do insist the\r\n     record shows that Judge Fine is the author of the law which\r\n     opened the way to clothe woman with full rights, in regard to\r\n     holding, using, and enjoying in every way her own property,\r\n     independently of any husband.\r\n\r\n     I add the following extracts taken from the journals of the\r\n     Senate and Assembly of 1848, viz:\r\n\r\n     Senate journal for 1848, p. 35. January 7th. \"Mr. Fine gave\r\n     notice that he would, at an early day, ask leave to introduce a\r\n     bill for the more effectual protection of the property of married\r\n     women.\"\r\n\r\n     Jan. 8th, p. 47. \"Mr. Fine introduced 'the bill,' and it was\r\n     referred to the Judiciary Committee,\" which consisted of Mr.\r\n     Wilkin, Mr. Fine, and Mr. Cole.\r\n\r\n     Feb. 7th, p. 157. Mr. Wilkin reported the bill favorably, and it\r\n     was sent to the Committee of the Whole.\r\n\r\n     Feb. 23d. Mr. Geddes presented the petition of three hundred\r\n     citizens of Syracuse praying for the passage of a law to protect\r\n     the rights of married women.\r\n\r\n     March 1st, p. 242. \"The Senate spent some time in Committee of\r\n     the Whole\" on the bill, and reported progress, and had leave to\r\n     sit again.\r\n\r\n     March 3d, p. 250.

GEDDES.\r\n\r\nWhen the first bill was introduced by Judge Hertell in 1836, he made a\r\nvery elaborate argument in its favor, covering all objections, and\r\nshowing the incontestable justice of the measure. Being too voluminous\r\nfor a newspaper report it was published in pamphlet form. His wife,\r\nBarbara Amelia Hertell, dying a few years since, by her will left a\r\nsum for the republication of this exhaustive argument, thus keeping\r\nthe memory of her husband green in the hearts of his countrywomen, and\r\nexpressing her own high appreciation of its value.\r\n\r\nStep by step the Middle and New England States began to modify their\r\nlaws, but the Western States, in their Constitutions, were liberal in\r\nstarting. Thus the discussions in the constitutional convention and\r\nthe Legislature, heralded by the press to every school district,\r\nculminated at last in a woman's rights convention.\r\n\r\nThe _Seneca County Courier_, a semi-weekly journal, of July 14, 1848,\r\ncontained the following startling announcement:\r\n\r\n                        SENECA FALLS CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n     WOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION.--A Convention to discuss the social,\r\n     civil, and religious condition and rights of woman, will be held\r\n     in the Wesleyan Chapel, at Seneca Falls, N. Y., on Wednesday and\r\n     Thursday, the 19th and 20th of July, current; commencing at 10\r\n     o'clock A.M. During the first day the meeting will be exclusively\r\n     for women, who are earnestly invited to attend. The public\r\n     generally are invited to be present on the second day, when\r\n     Lucretia Mott, of Philadelphia, and other ladies and gentlemen,\r\n     will address the convention.\r\n\r\nThis call, without signature, was issued by Lucretia Mott, Martha C.\r\nWright, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Mary Ann McClintock. At this time\r\nMrs. Mott was visiting her sister Mrs. Wright, at Auburn, and\r\nattending the Yearly Meeting of Friends in Western New York. Mrs.\r\nStanton, having recently removed from Boston to Seneca Falls, finding\r\nthe most congenial associations in Quaker families, met Mrs. Mott\r\nincidentally for the first time since her residence there. They at\r\nonce returned to the topic they had so often discussed, walking arm\r\nin arm in the streets of London, and Boston, \"the propriety of holding\r\na woman's convention.\" These four ladies, sitting round the tea-table\r\nof Richard Hunt, a prominent Friend near Waterloo, decided to put\r\ntheir long-talked-of resolution into action, and before the twilight\r\ndeepened into night, the call was written, and sent to the Seneca\r\nCounty Courier. On Sunday morning they met in Mrs. McClintock's parlor\r\nto write their declaration, resolutions, and to consider subjects for\r\nspeeches.[8] As the convention was to assemble in three days, the time\r\nwas short for such productions; but having no experience in the _modus\r\noperandi_ of getting up conventions, nor in that kind of literature,\r\nthey were quite innocent of the herculean labors they proposed. On the\r\nfirst attempt to frame a resolution; to crowd a complete thought,\r\nclearly and concisely, into three lines; they felt as helpless and\r\nhopeless as if they had been suddenly asked to construct a steam\r\nengine. And the humiliating fact may as well now be recorded that\r\nbefore taking the initiative step, those ladies resigned themselves to\r\na faithful perusal of various masculine productions. The reports of\r\nPeace, Temperance, and Anti-Slavery conventions were examined, but all\r\nalike seemed too tame and pacific for the inauguration of a rebellion\r\nsuch as the world had never before seen. They knew women had wrongs,\r\nbut how to state them was the difficulty, and this was increased from\r\nthe fact that they themselves were fortunately organized and\r\nconditioned; they were neither \"sour old maids,\" \"childless women,\"\r\nnor \"divorced wives,\" as the newspapers declared them to be. While\r\nthey had felt the insults incident to sex, in many ways, as every\r\nproud, thinking woman must, in the laws, religion, and literature of\r\nthe world, and in the invidious and degrading sentiments and customs\r\nof all nations, yet they had not in their own experience endured the\r\ncoarser forms of tyranny resulting from unjust laws, or association\r\nwith immoral and unscrupulous men, but they had souls large enough to\r\nfeel the wrongs of others, without being scarified in their own flesh.\r\n\r\nAfter much delay, one of the circle took up the Declaration of 1776,\r\nand read it aloud with much spirit and emphasis, and it was at once\r\ndecided to adopt the historic document, with some slight changes such\r\nas substituting \"all men\" for \"King George.\" Knowing that women must\r\nhave more to complain of than men under any circumstances possibly\r\ncould, and seeing the Fathers had eighteen grievances, a protracted\r\nsearch was made through statute books, church usages, and the customs\r\nof society to find that exact number. Several well-disposed men\r\nassisted in collecting the grievances, until, with the announcement of\r\nthe eighteenth, the women felt they had enough to go before the world\r\nwith a good case. One youthful lord remarked, \"Your grievances must be\r\ngrievous indeed, when you are obliged to go to books in order to find\r\nthem out.\"\r\n\r\nThe eventful day dawned at last, and crowds in carriages and on foot,\r\nwended their way to the Wesleyan church. When those having charge of\r\nthe Declaration, the resolutions, and several volumes of the Statutes\r\nof New York arrived on the scene, lo! the door was locked. However, an\r\nembryo Professor of Yale College was lifted through an open window to\r\nunbar the door; that done, the church was quickly filled. It had been\r\ndecided to have no men present, but as they were already on the spot,\r\nand as the women who must take the responsibility of organizing the\r\nmeeting, and leading the discussions, shrank from doing either, it was\r\ndecided, in a hasty council round the altar, that this was an occasion\r\nwhen men might make themselves pre-eminently useful. It was agreed\r\nthey should remain, and take the laboring oar through the Convention.\r\n\r\nJames Mott, tall and dignified, in Quaker costume, was called to the\r\nchair; Mary McClintock appointed Secretary, Frederick Douglass, Samuel\r\nTillman, Ansel Bascom, E. W. Capron, and Thomas McClintock took part\r\nthroughout in the discussions. Lucretia Mott, accustomed to public\r\nspeaking in the Society of Friends, stated the objects of the\r\nConvention, and in taking a survey of the degraded condition of woman\r\nthe world over, showed the importance of inaugurating some movement\r\nfor her education and elevation. Elizabeth and Mary McClintock, and\r\nMrs. Stanton, each read a well-written speech; Martha Wright read some\r\nsatirical articles she had published in the daily papers answering the\r\ndiatribes on woman's sphere. Ansel Bascom, who had been a member of\r\nthe Constitutional Convention recently held in Albany, spoke at length\r\non the property bill for married women, just passed the Legislature,\r\nand the discussion on woman's rights in that Convention. Samuel\r\nTillman, a young student of law, read a series of the most\r\nexasperating statutes for women, from English and American jurists,\r\nall reflecting the _tender mercies_ of men toward their wives, in\r\ntaking care of their property and protecting them in their civil\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration having been freely discussed by many present, was\r\nre-read by Mrs. Stanton, and with some slight amendment adopted.\r\n\r\n                       DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS.\r\n\r\n     When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one\r\n     portion of the family of man to assume among the people of the\r\n     earth a position different from that which they have hitherto\r\n     occupied, but one to which the laws of nature and of nature's God\r\n     entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind\r\n     requires that they should declare the causes that impel them to\r\n     such a course.\r\n\r\n     We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women\r\n     are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with\r\n     certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty,\r\n     and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights\r\n     governments are instituted, deriving their just powers from the\r\n     consent of the governed. Whenever any form of government becomes\r\n     destructive of these ends, it is the right of those who suffer\r\n     from it to refuse allegiance to it, and to insist upon the\r\n     institution of a new government, laying its foundation on such\r\n     principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them\r\n     shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.\r\n     Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established\r\n     should not be changed for light and transient causes; and\r\n     accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more\r\n     disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right\r\n     themselves by abolishing the forms to which they were accustomed.\r\n     But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing\r\n     invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under\r\n     absolute despotism, it is their duty to throw off such\r\n     government, and to provide new guards for their future security.\r\n     Such has been the patient sufferance of the women under this\r\n     government, and such is now the necessity which constrains them\r\n     to demand the equal station to which they are entitled.\r\n\r\n     The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and\r\n     usurpations on the part of man toward woman, having in direct\r\n     object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over her. To\r\n     prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.\r\n\r\n     He has never permitted her to exercise her inalienable right to\r\n     the elective franchise.\r\n\r\n     He has compelled her to submit to laws, in the formation of which\r\n     she had no voice.\r\n\r\n     He has withheld from her rights which are given to the most\r\n     ignorant and degraded men--both natives and foreigners.\r\n\r\n     Having deprived her of this first right of a citizen, the\r\n     elective franchise, thereby leaving her without representation in\r\n     the halls of legislation, he has oppressed her on all sides.\r\n\r\n     He has made her, if married, in the eye of the law, civilly dead.\r\n\r\n     He has taken from her all right in property, even to the wages\r\n     she earns.\r\n\r\n     He has made her, morally, an irresponsible being, as she can\r\n     commit many crimes with impunity, provided they be done in the\r\n     presence of her husband. In the covenant of marriage, she is\r\n     compelled to promise obedience to her husband, he becoming, to\r\n     all intents and purposes, her master--the law giving him power to\r\n     deprive her of her liberty, and to administer chastisement.\r\n\r\n     He has so framed the laws of divorce, as to what shall be the\r\n     proper causes, and in case of separation, to whom the\r\n     guardianship of the children shall be given, as to be wholly\r\n     regardless of the happiness of women--the law, in all cases,\r\n     going upon a false supposition of the supremacy of man, and\r\n     giving all power into his hands.\r\n\r\n     After depriving her of all rights as a married woman, if single,\r\n     and the owner of property, he has taxed her to support a\r\n     government which recognizes her only when her property can be\r\n     made profitable to it.\r\n\r\n     He has monopolized nearly all the profitable employments, and\r\n     from those she is permitted to follow, she receives but a scanty\r\n     remuneration. He closes against her all the avenues to wealth and\r\n     distinction which he considers most honorable to himself. As a\r\n     teacher of theology, medicine, or law, she is not known.\r\n\r\n     He has denied her the facilities for obtaining a thorough\r\n     education, all colleges being closed against her.\r\n\r\n     He allows her in Church, as well as State, but a subordinate\r\n     position, claiming Apostolic authority for her exclusion from the\r\n     ministry, and, with some exceptions, from any public\r\n     participation in the affairs of the Church.\r\n\r\n     He has created a false public sentiment by giving to the world a\r\n     different code of morals for men and women, by which moral\r\n     delinquencies which exclude women from society, are not only\r\n     tolerated, but deemed of little account in man.\r\n\r\n     He has usurped the prerogative of Jehovah himself, claiming it as\r\n     his right to assign for her a sphere of action, when that belongs\r\n     to her conscience and to her God.\r\n\r\n     He has endeavored, in every way that he could, to destroy her\r\n     confidence in her own powers, to lessen her self-respect, and to\r\n     make her willing to lead a dependent and abject life.\r\n\r\n     Now, in view of this entire disfranchisement of one-half the\r\n     people of this country, their social and religious\r\n     degradation--in view of the unjust laws above mentioned, and\r\n     because women do feel themselves aggrieved, oppressed, and\r\n     fraudulently deprived of their most sacred rights, we insist that\r\n     they have immediate admission to all the rights and privileges\r\n     which belong to them as citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\n     In entering upon the great work before us, we anticipate no small\r\n     amount of misconception, misrepresentation, and ridicule; but we\r\n     shall use every instrumentality within our power to effect our\r\n     object. We shall employ agents, circulate tracts, petition the\r\n     State and National legislatures, and endeavor to enlist the\r\n     pulpit and the press in our behalf. We hope this Convention will\r\n     be followed by a series of Conventions embracing every part of\r\n     the country.\r\n\r\nThe following resolutions were discussed by Lucretia Mott, Thomas and\r\nMary Ann McClintock, Amy Post, Catharine A. F. Stebbins, and others,\r\nand were adopted:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The great precept of nature is conceded to be, that \"man\r\n     shall pursue his own true and substantial happiness.\" Blackstone\r\n     in his Commentaries remarks, that this law of Nature being\r\n     coeval with mankind, and dictated by God himself, is of course\r\n     superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the\r\n     globe, in all countries and at all times; no human laws are of\r\n     any validity if contrary to this, and such of them as are valid,\r\n     derive all their force, and all their validity, and all their\r\n     authority, mediately and immediately, from this original;\r\n     therefore.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That such laws as conflict, in any way, with the true\r\n     and substantial happiness of woman, are contrary to the great\r\n     precept of nature and of no validity, for this is \"superior in\r\n     obligation to any other.\"\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That all laws which prevent woman from occupying such\r\n     a station in society as her conscience shall dictate, or which\r\n     place her in a position inferior to that of man, are contrary to\r\n     the great precept of nature, and therefore of no force or\r\n     authority.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That woman is man's equal--was intended to be so by\r\n     the Creator, and the highest good of the race demands that she\r\n     should be recognized as such.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the women of this country ought to be\r\n     enlightened in regard to the laws under which they live, that\r\n     they may no longer publish their degradation by declaring\r\n     themselves satisfied with their present position, nor their\r\n     ignorance, by asserting that they have all the rights they want.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That inasmuch as man, while claiming for himself\r\n     intellectual superiority, does accord to woman moral superiority,\r\n     it is pre-eminently his duty to encourage her to speak and teach,\r\n     as she has an opportunity, in all religious assemblies.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the same amount of virtue, delicacy, and\r\n     refinement of behavior that is required of woman in the social\r\n     state, should also be required of man, and the same\r\n     transgressions should be visited with equal severity on both man\r\n     and woman.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the objection of indelicacy and impropriety,\r\n     which is so often brought against woman when she addresses a\r\n     public audience, comes with a very ill-grace from those who\r\n     encourage, by their attendance, her appearance on the stage, in\r\n     the concert, or in feats of the circus.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That woman has too long rested satisfied in the\r\n     circumscribed limits which corrupt customs and a perverted\r\n     application of the Scriptures have marked out for her, and that\r\n     it is time she should move in the enlarged sphere which her great\r\n     Creator has assigned her.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is the duty of the women of this country to\r\n     secure to themselves their sacred right to the elective\r\n     franchise.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the equality of human rights results necessarily\r\n     from the fact of the identity of the race in capabilities and\r\n     responsibilities.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved, therefore_, That, being invested by the Creator with\r\n     the same capabilities, and the same consciousness of\r\n     responsibility for their exercise, it is demonstrably the right\r\n     and duty of woman, equally with man, to promote every righteous\r\n     cause by every righteous means; and especially in regard to the\r\n     great subjects of morals and religion, it is self-evidently her\r\n     right to participate with her brother in teaching them, both in\r\n     private and in public, by writing and by speaking, by any\r\n     instrumentalities proper to be used, and in any assemblies proper\r\n     to be held; and this being a self-evident truth growing out of\r\n     the divinely implanted principles of human nature, any custom or\r\n     authority adverse to it, whether modern or wearing the hoary\r\n     sanction of antiquity, is to be regarded as a self-evident\r\n     falsehood, and at war with mankind.\r\n\r\nAt the last session Lucretia Mott offered and spoke to the following\r\nresolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the speedy success of our cause depends upon the\r\n     zealous and untiring efforts of both men and women, for the\r\n     overthrow of the monopoly of the pulpit, and for the securing to\r\n     woman an equal participation with men in the various trades,\r\n     professions, and commerce.\r\n\r\nThe only resolution that was not unanimously adopted was the ninth,\r\nurging the women of the country to secure to themselves the elective\r\nfranchise. Those who took part in the debate feared a demand for the\r\nright to vote would defeat others they deemed more rational, and make\r\nthe whole movement ridiculous.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Stanton and Frederick Douglass seeing that the power to\r\nchoose rulers and make laws, was the right by which all others could\r\nbe secured, persistently advocated the resolution, and at last carried\r\nit by a small majority.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that the Declaration and resolutions in the very\r\nfirst Convention, demanded all the most radical friends of the\r\nmovement have since claimed--such as equal rights in the universities,\r\nin the trades and professions; the right to vote; to share in all\r\npolitical offices, honors, and emoluments; to complete equality in\r\nmarriage, to personal freedom, property, wages, children; to make\r\ncontracts; to sue, and be sued; and to testify in courts of justice.\r\nAt this time the condition of married women under the Common Law, was\r\nnearly as degraded as that of the slave on the Southern plantation.\r\nThe Convention continued through two entire days, and late into the\r\nevenings. The deepest interest was manifested to its close.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings were extensively published, unsparingly ridiculed by\r\nthe press, and denounced by the pulpit, much to the surprise and\r\nchagrin of the leaders. Being deeply in earnest, and believing their\r\ndemands pre-eminently wise and just, they were wholly unprepared to\r\nfind themselves the target for the jibes and jeers of the nation. The\r\nDeclaration was signed by one hundred men, and women, many of whom\r\nwithdrew their names as soon as the storm of ridicule began to break.\r\nThe comments of the press were carefully preserved,[9] and it is\r\ncurious to see that the same old arguments, and objections rife at the\r\nstart, are reproduced by the press of to-day. But the brave protests\r\nsent out from this Convention touched a responsive chord in the hearts\r\nof women all over the country.\r\n\r\nConventions were held soon after in Ohio, Massachusetts, Indiana,\r\nPennsylvania, and at different points in New York.\r\n\r\nMr. Douglass, in his paper, _The North Star_, of July 28, 1848, had\r\nthe following editorial leader:\r\n\r\n     THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN.--One of the most interesting events of the\r\n     past week, was the holding of what is technically styled a\r\n     Woman's Rights Convention at Seneca Falls. The speaking,\r\n     addresses, and resolutions of this extraordinary meeting were\r\n     almost wholly conducted by women; and although they evidently\r\n     felt themselves in a novel position, it is but simple justice to\r\n     say that their whole proceedings were characterized by marked\r\n     ability and dignity. No one present, we think, however much he\r\n     might be disposed to differ from the views advanced by the\r\n     leading speakers on that occasion, will fail to give them credit\r\n     for brilliant talents and excellent dispositions. In this\r\n     meeting, as in other deliberative assemblies, there were frequent\r\n     differences of opinion and animated discussion; but in no case\r\n     was there the slightest absence of good feeling and decorum.\r\n     Several interesting documents setting forth the rights as well as\r\n     grievances of women were read. Among these was a Declaration of\r\n     Sentiments, to be regarded as the basis of a grand movement for\r\n     attaining the civil, social, political, and religious rights of\r\n     women. We should not do justice to our own convictions, or to the\r\n     excellent persons connected with this infant movement, if we did\r\n     not in this connection offer a few remarks on the general subject\r\n     which the Convention met to consider and the objects they seek to\r\n     attain. In doing so, we are not insensible that the bare mention\r\n     of this truly important subject in any other than terms of\r\n     contemptuous ridicule and scornful disfavor, is likely to excite\r\n     against us the fury of bigotry and the folly of prejudice. A\r\n     discussion of the rights of animals would be regarded with far\r\n     more complacency by many of what are called the _wise_ and the\r\n     _good_ of our land, than would be a discussion of the rights of\r\n     women. It is, in their estimation, to be guilty of evil thoughts,\r\n     to think that woman is entitled to equal rights with man. Many\r\n     who have at last made the discovery that the negroes have some\r\n     rights as well as other members of the human family, have yet to\r\n     be convinced that women are entitled to any. Eight years ago a\r\n     number of persons of this description actually abandoned the\r\n     anti-slavery cause, lest by giving their influence in that\r\n     direction they might possibly be giving countenance to the\r\n     dangerous heresy that woman, in respect to rights, stands on an\r\n     equal footing with man. In the judgment of such persons the\r\n     American slave system, with all its concomitant horrors, is less\r\n     to be deplored than this _wicked_ idea. It is perhaps needless to\r\n     say, that we cherish little sympathy for such sentiments or\r\n     respect for such prejudices. Standing as we do upon the\r\n     watch-tower of human freedom, we can not be deterred from an\r\n     expression of our approbation of any movement, however humble,\r\n     to improve and elevate the character of any members of the human\r\n     family. While it is impossible for us to go into this subject at\r\n     length, and dispose of the various objections which are often\r\n     urged against such a doctrine as that of female equality, we are\r\n     free to say that in respect to political rights, we hold woman to\r\n     be justly entitled to all we claim for man. We go farther, and\r\n     express our conviction that all political rights which it is\r\n     expedient for man to exercise, it is equally so for woman. All\r\n     that distinguishes man as an intelligent and accountable being,\r\n     is equally true of woman; and if that government only is just\r\n     which governs by the free consent of the governed, there can be\r\n     no reason in the world for denying to woman the exercise of the\r\n     elective franchise, or a hand in making and administering the\r\n     laws of the land. Our doctrine is that \"right is of no sex.\" We\r\n     therefore bid the women engaged in this movement our humble\r\n     Godspeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROCHESTER CONVENTION, AUGUST 2, 1848.\r\n\r\nThose who took part in the Convention at Seneca Falls, finding at the\r\nend of the two days, there were still so many new points for\r\ndiscussion, and that the gift of tongues had been vouchsafed to them,\r\nadjourned, to meet in Rochester in two weeks. Amy Post, Sarah D. Fish,\r\nSarah C. Owen, and Mary H. Hallowell, were the Committee of\r\nArrangements. This Convention was called for August 2d, and so well\r\nadvertised in the daily papers, that at the appointed hour, the\r\nUnitarian Church was filled to overflowing.\r\n\r\nAmy Post called the meeting to order, and stated that at a gathering\r\nthe previous evening in Protection Hall, Rhoda De Garmo, Sarah Fish,\r\nand herself, were appointed a committee to nominate officers for the\r\nConvention, and they now proposed Abigail Bush, for President; Laura\r\nMurray, for Vice-President; Elizabeth McClintock, Sarah Hallowell, and\r\nCatherine A. F. Stebbins, for Secretaries. Mrs. Mott, Mrs. Stanton,\r\nand Mrs. McClintock, thought it a most hazardous experiment to have a\r\nwoman President, and stoutly opposed it.\r\n\r\nTo write a Declaration and Resolutions, to make a speech, and debate,\r\nhad taxed their powers to the uttermost; and now, with such feeble\r\nvoices and timid manners, without the slightest knowledge of Cushing's\r\nManual, or the least experience in public meetings, how could a woman\r\npreside? They were on the verge of leaving the Convention in disgust,\r\nbut Amy Post and Rhoda De Garmo assured them that by the same power by\r\nwhich they had resolved, declared, discussed, debated, they could also\r\npreside at a public meeting, if they would but make the experiment.\r\nAnd as the vote of the majority settled the question on the side of\r\nwoman, Abigail Bush took the chair, and the calm way she assumed the\r\nduties of the office, and the admirable manner in which she discharged\r\nthem, soon reconciled the opposition to the seemingly ridiculous\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings were opened with prayer, by the Rev. Mr. Wicher, of\r\nthe Free-will Baptist Church. Even at that early day, there were many\r\nof the liberal clergymen in favor of equal rights for women. During\r\nthe reading of the minutes of the preliminary meeting by the\r\nSecretary, much uneasiness was manifested concerning the low voices of\r\nwomen, and cries of \"Louder, louder!\" drowned every other sound, when\r\nthe President, on rising, said:\r\n\r\n     Friends, we present ourselves here before you, as an oppressed\r\n     class, with trembling frames and faltering tongues, and we do not\r\n     expect to be able to speak so as to be heard by all at first, but\r\n     we trust we shall have the sympathy of the audience, and that you\r\n     will bear with our weakness now in the infancy of the movement.\r\n     Our trust in the omnipotency of right is our only faith that we\r\n     shall succeed.\r\n\r\nAs the appointed Secretaries could not be heard, Sarah Anthony Burtis,\r\nan experienced Quaker school-teacher, whose voice had been well\r\ntrained in her profession, volunteered to fill the duties of that\r\noffice, and she read the reports and documents of the Convention with\r\na clear voice and confident manner, to the great satisfaction of her\r\nmore timid coadjutors.\r\n\r\nSeveral gentlemen took part in the debates of this Convention. Some in\r\nfavor, some opposed, and others willing to make partial concessions to\r\nthe demands as set forth in the Declaration and Resolutions. Frederick\r\nDouglass, William C. Nell, and William C. Bloss advocated the\r\nemancipation of women from all the artificial disabilities, imposed by\r\nfalse customs, creeds, and codes. Milo Codding, Mr. Sulley, Mr.\r\nPickard, and a Mr. Colton, of Connecticut, thought \"woman's sphere was\r\nhome,\" and that she should remain in it; he would seriously deprecate\r\nher occupying the pulpit.\r\n\r\nLucretia Mott replied, that the gentleman from New Haven had objected\r\nto woman occupying the pulpit, and indeed she could scarcely see how\r\nany one educated in New Haven, Ct., could think otherwise than he did.\r\nShe said, we had all got our notions too much from the clergy, instead\r\nof the Bible. The Bible, she contended, had none of the prohibitions\r\nin regard to women; and spoke of the \"honorable women not a few,\"\r\netc., and desired Mr. Colton to read his Bible over again, and see if\r\nthere was anything there to prohibit woman from being a religious\r\nteacher. She then complimented the members of that church for opening\r\ntheir doors to a Woman's Eights Convention, and said that a few years\r\nago, the Female Moral Reform Society of Philadelphia applied for the\r\nuse of a church in that city, in which to hold one of their meetings;\r\nthey were only allowed the use of the basement, and on condition that\r\nnone of the women should speak at the meeting. Accordingly, a D.D. was\r\ncalled upon to preside, and another to read the ladies' report of the\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nNear the close of the morning session, a young bride in traveling\r\ndress,[10] accompanied by her husband, slowly walked up the aisle, and\r\nasked the privilege of saying a few words, which was readily granted.\r\nBeing introduced to the audience, she said, on her way westward,\r\nhearing of the Convention, she had waited over a train, to add her\r\nmite in favor of the demand now made, by the true women of this\r\ngeneration:\r\n\r\n     It is with diffidence that I speak upon this question before us,\r\n     not a diffidence resulting from any doubt of the worthiness of\r\n     the cause, but from the fear that its depth and power can be but\r\n     meagerly portrayed by me.... Woman's rights--her civil\r\n     rights--equal with man's--not an equality of moral and religious\r\n     influence, for who dares to deny her that?--but an equality in\r\n     the exercise of her own powers, and a right to use all the\r\n     sources of erudition within the reach of man, to build unto\r\n     herself a name for her talents, energy, and integrity. We do not\r\n     positively say that our intellect is as capable as man's to\r\n     assume, and at once to hold, these rights, or that our hearts are\r\n     as willing to enter into his actions; for if we did not believe\r\n     it, we would not contend for them, and if men did not believe it,\r\n     they would not withhold them with a smothered silence.... In\r\n     closing, she said: There will be one effect, perhaps unlooked\r\n     for, if we are raised to equal administration with man. It will\r\n     classify intellect. The heterogeneous triflings which now, I am\r\n     very sorry to say, occupy so much of our time, will be neglected;\r\n     fashion's votaries will silently fall off; dishonest exertions\r\n     for rank in society will be scorned; extravagance in toilet will\r\n     be detested; that meager and worthless pride of station will be\r\n     forgotten; the honest earnings of dependents will be paid;\r\n     popular demagogues crushed; impostors unpatronized; true genius\r\n     sincerely encouraged; and, above all, pawned integrity redeemed!\r\n     And why? Because enfranchised woman then will feel the burdens of\r\n     her responsibilities, and can strive for elevation, and will\r\n     reach all knowledge within her grasp.... If all this is\r\n     accomplished, man need not fear pomposity, fickleness, or an\r\n     unhealthy enthusiasm at his dear fireside; we can be as dutiful,\r\n     submissive, endearing as daughters, wives, and mothers, even if\r\n     we hang the wreath of domestic harmony upon the eagle's talons.\r\n\r\nThus for twenty minutes the young and beautiful stranger held her\r\naudience spell-bound with her eloquence, in a voice whose pathos\r\nthrilled every heart. Her husband, hat and cane in hand, remained\r\nstanding, leaning against a pillar near the altar, and seemed a most\r\ndelighted, nay, reverential listener. It was a scene never to be\r\nforgotten, and one of the most pleasing incidents of the Convention.\r\n\r\nSarah Owen read an address on woman's place and pay in the world of\r\nwork. In closing, she said:\r\n\r\n     An experienced cashier of this city remarked to me that women\r\n     might be as good book-keepers as men; but men have monopolized\r\n     every lucrative situation, from the dry-goods merchant down to\r\n     whitewashing. Who does not feel, as she sees a stout, athletic\r\n     man standing behind the counter measuring lace, ribbons, and\r\n     tape, that he is monopolizing a woman's place, while thousands of\r\n     rich acres in our western world await his coming? This year, a\r\n     woman, for the first time, has taken her place in one of our\r\n     regular medical colleges. We rejoice to hear that by her dignity\r\n     of manner, application to study, and devotion to the several\r\n     branches of the profession she has chosen, she has secured the\r\n     respect of her professors and class, and reflected lasting honor\r\n     upon her whole sex. Thus we hail, in Elizabeth Blackwell, a\r\n     pioneer for woman in this profession.\r\n\r\n     It is by this inverted order of society that woman is obliged to\r\n     ply the needle by day and by night, to procure even a scanty\r\n     pittance for her dependent family. Let men become producers, as\r\n     nature has designed them, and women be educated to fill all those\r\n     stations which require less physical strength, and we should soon\r\n     modify many of our social evils. I am informed by the\r\n     seamstresses of this city, that they get but thirty cents for\r\n     making a satin vest, and from twelve to thirty for making pants,\r\n     and coats in the same proportion. Man has such a contemptible\r\n     idea of woman, that he thinks she can not even sew as well as he\r\n     can; and he often goes to a tailor, and pays him double and even\r\n     treble for making a suit, when it merely passes through his\r\n     hands, after a woman has made every stitch of it so neatly that\r\n     he discovers no difference. Who does not see gross injustice in\r\n     this inequality of wages and violation of rights? To prove that\r\n     woman is capable of prosecuting the mercantile business, we have\r\n     a noble example in this city in Mrs. Gifford, who has sustained\r\n     herself with credit. She has bravely triumphed over all obloquy\r\n     and discouragement attendant on such a novel experiment, and made\r\n     for herself an independent living.\r\n\r\n     In the fields of benevolence, woman has done great and noble\r\n     works for the safety and stability of the nation. When man shall\r\n     see the wisdom of recognizing a co-worker in her, then may be\r\n     looked for the dawning of a perfect day, when woman shall stand\r\n     where God designed she should, on an even platform with man\r\n     himself.\r\n\r\nMrs. Roberts, who had been requested to investigate the wrongs of the\r\nlaboring classes, and to invite that oppressed portion of the\r\ncommunity to attend the Convention, and take part in its\r\ndeliberations, made some appropriate remarks relative to the\r\nintolerable servitude and small remuneration paid to the working-class\r\nof women. She reported the average price of labor for seamstresses to\r\nbe from 31 to 38 cents a day, and board from $1.25 to $1.50 per week\r\nto be deducted therefrom, and they were generally obliged to take half\r\nor more in due bills, which were payable in goods at certain stores,\r\nthereby obliging them many times to pay extortionate prices.\r\n\r\nMrs. Galloy corroborated the statement, having herself experienced\r\nsome of the oppressions of this portion of our citizens, and expressed\r\nher gratitude that the subject was claiming the attention of this\r\nbenevolent and intelligent class of community. It did not require much\r\nargument, to reconcile all who took part in the debates, to woman's\r\nright to equal wages for equal work, but the gentlemen seemed more\r\ndisturbed as to the effect of equality in the family. With the old\r\nidea of a divinely ordained head, and that, in all cases, the man,\r\nwhether wise or foolish, educated or ignorant, sober or drunk, such a\r\nrelation to them did not seem feasible. Mr. Sully asked, when the two\r\nheads disagree, who must decide? There is no Lord Chancellor to whom\r\nto apply, and does not St. Paul strictly enjoin obedience to husbands,\r\nand that man shall be head of the woman?\r\n\r\nLucretia Mott replied that in the Society of Friends she had never\r\nknown any difficulty to arise on account of the wife's not having\r\npromised _obedience_ in the marriage contract. She had never known any\r\nmode of decision except an appeal to reason; and, although in some of\r\nthe meetings of this Society, women are placid on an equality, none of\r\nthe results so much dreaded had occurred. She said that many of the\r\nopposers of Woman's Rights, who bid us to obey the bachelor St. Paul,\r\nthemselves reject his counsel. He advised them not to marry. In\r\ngeneral answer she would quote, \"One is your master, even Christ.\"\r\nAlthough Paul enjoins silence on women in the Church, yet he gives\r\ndirections how they should appear when publicly speaking, and we have\r\nscriptural accounts of honorable women not a few who were religious\r\nteachers, viz: Phebe, Priscilla, Tryphena, Triphosa, and the four\r\ndaughters of Philip, and various others.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton thought the gentleman might be easily answered; saying\r\nthat the strongest will or the superior intellect now governs the\r\nhousehold, as it will in the new order. She knew many a woman, who, to\r\nall intents and purposes, is at the head of her family.\r\n\r\nMr. Pickard asked who, after marriage, should hold the property, and\r\nwhose name should be retained. He thought an umpire necessary. He did\r\nnot see but all business must cease until the consent of both parties\r\nbe obtained. He saw an impossibility of introducing such rules into\r\nsociety. The Gospel had established the unity and oneness of the\r\nmarried pair.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton said she thought the Gospel, rightly understood, pointed\r\nto a oneness of equality, not subordination, and that property should\r\nbe jointly held. She could see no reason why marriage by false creeds\r\nshould be made a degradation to woman; and, as to the name, the custom\r\nof taking the husband's name is not universal. When a man has a bad\r\nname in any sense, he might be the gainer by burying himself under the\r\ngood name of his wife. This last winter a Mr. Cruikshanks applied to\r\nour Legislature to have his name changed. Now, if he had taken his\r\nwife's name in the beginning, he might have saved the Legislature the\r\ntrouble of considering the propriety of releasing the man from such a\r\nburden to be entailed on the third and fourth generation. When a slave\r\nescapes from a Southern plantation, he at once takes a name as the\r\nfirst step in liberty--the first assertion of individual identity. A\r\nwoman's dignity is equally involved in a life-long name, to mark her\r\nindividuality. We can not overestimate the demoralizing effect on\r\nwoman herself, to say nothing of society at large, for her to consent\r\nthus to merge her existence so wholly in that of another.\r\n\r\nA well-written speech was read by William C. Nell, which Mrs. Mott\r\nthought too flattering. She said woman is now sufficiently developed\r\nto prefer justice to compliment.\r\n\r\nA letter was read from Gerrit Smith, approving cordially of the object\r\nof the Convention.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton read the Declaration that was adopted at Seneca Falls,\r\nand urged those present who did not agree with its sentiments, to make\r\ntheir objections then and there. She hoped if there were any clergymen\r\npresent, they would not keep silent during the Convention and then on\r\nSunday do as their brethren did in Seneca Falls--use their pulpits\r\nthroughout the city to denounce them, where they could not, of course,\r\nbe allowed to reply.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions[11] were freely discussed by Amy Post, Rhoda De Garmo,\r\nAnn Edgeworth, Sarah D. Fish, and others. While Mrs. Mott and Mrs.\r\nStanton spoke in their favor, they thought they were too tame, and\r\nwished for some more stirring declarations. Elizabeth McClintock read,\r\nin an admirable manner, a spirited poetical reply, from the pen of\r\nMaria Weston Chapman, to \"A Clerical Appeal\" published in 1840. Mrs.\r\nChapman was one of the grand women in Boston, who, during the early\r\ndays of Anti-Slavery, gave her unceasing efforts to that struggle. Her\r\npen was a power in the journals and magazines, and her presence an\r\ninspiration in their fairs and conventions. When Abby Kelly, Angelina\r\nGrimke, and Lucretia Mott first began to speak to promiscuous\r\nassemblies in Anti-Slavery Conventions, \"a clerical appeal\" was issued\r\nand sent to all the clergymen in New England, calling on them to\r\ndenounce in their pulpits this unmannerly and unchristian proceeding.\r\nSermons were preached, portraying in the darkest colors the fearful\r\nresults to the Church, the State, and the home, in thus encouraging\r\nwomen to enter public life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"PASTORAL LETTER.\"\r\n\r\nExtract from a Pastoral Letter of \"the General Association of\r\nMassachusetts (Orthodox) to the Churches under their care\"--1837:\r\n\r\n     III. We invite your attention to the dangers which at present\r\n     seem to threaten the female character with wide-spread and\r\n     permanent injury.\r\n\r\n     The appropriate duties and influence of woman are clearly stated\r\n     in the New Testament. Those duties and that influence are\r\n     unobtrusive and private, but the source of mighty power. When the\r\n     mild, dependent, softening influence of woman upon the sternness\r\n     of man's opinions is fully exercised, society feels the effects\r\n     of it in a thousand forms. The power of woman is her dependence,\r\n     flowing from the consciousness of that weakness which God has\r\n     given her for her protection, (!) and which keeps her in those\r\n     departments of life that form the character of individuals, and\r\n     of the nation. There are social influences which females use in\r\n     promoting piety and the great objects of Christian benevolence\r\n     which we can not too highly commend.\r\n\r\n     We appreciate the unostentatious prayers and efforts of woman in\r\n     advancing the cause of religion at home and abroad; in\r\n     Sabbath-schools; in leading religious inquirers to the pastors\r\n     (!) for instruction; and in all such associated effort as becomes\r\n     the modesty of her sex; and earnestly hope that she may abound\r\n     more and more in these labors of piety and love. But when she\r\n     assumes the place and tone of man as a public reformer, our care\r\n     and protection of her seem unnecessary; we put ourselves in\r\n     self-defence (!) against her; she yields the power which God has\r\n     given her for her protection, and her character becomes\r\n     unnatural. If the vine, whose strength and beauty is to lean upon\r\n     the trellis-work, and half conceal its clusters, thinks to assume\r\n     the independence and the overshadowing nature of the elm, it will\r\n     not only cease to bear fruit, but fall in shame and dishonor into\r\n     the dust. We can not, therefore, but regret the mistaken conduct\r\n     of those who encourage females to bear an obtrusive and\r\n     ostentatious part in measures of reform, and countenance any of\r\n     that sex who so far forget themselves as to itinerate in the\r\n     character of public lecturers and teachers. We especially deplore\r\n     the intimate acquaintance and promiscuous conversation of females\r\n     with regard to things which ought not to be named; by which that\r\n     modesty and delicacy which is the charm of domestic life, and\r\n     which constitutes the true influence of woman in society, is\r\n     consumed, and the way opened, as we apprehend, for degeneracy and\r\n     ruin.\r\n\r\n     We say these things not to discourage proper influences against\r\n     sin, but to secure such reformation (!) as we believe is\r\n     Scriptural, and will be permanent.\r\n\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, in a cordial letter, accompanying the above\r\nextract, which he had copied for us with his own hand from the files\r\nof _The Liberator_, said: \"This 'Clerical Bull' was fulminated with\r\nspecial reference to those two noble South Carolina women, Sarah M.\r\nand Angelina E. Grimke, who were at that time publicly pleading for\r\nthose in bonds as bound with them, while on a visit to Massachusetts.\r\nIt was written by the Rev. Dr. Nehemiah Adams, of Boston, author of 'A\r\nSouth-side View of Slavery.'\"\r\n\r\nMaria Weston Chapman's amusing answer in rhyme, shows that the days\r\nfor ecclesiastical bulls were fast passing away, when women, even,\r\ncould thus make light of them.\r\n\r\n                   MRS. CHAPMAN'S POEM.\r\n\r\n             \"THE TIMES THAT TRY MEN'S SOULS.\"\r\n\r\n    Confusion has seized us, and all things go wrong,\r\n      The women have leaped from \"their spheres,\"\r\n    And, instead of fixed stars, shoot as comets along,\r\n      And are setting the world by the ears!\r\n    In courses erratic they're wheeling through space,\r\n    In brainless confusion and meaningless chase.\r\n\r\n    In vain do our knowing ones try to compute\r\n      Their return to the orbit designed;\r\n    They're glanced at a moment, then onward they shoot,\r\n      And are neither \"to hold nor to bind;\"\r\n    So freely they move in their chosen ellipse,\r\n    The \"Lords of Creation\" do fear an eclipse.\r\n\r\n    They've taken a notion to speak for themselves,\r\n      And are wielding the tongue and the pen;\r\n    They've mounted the rostrum; the termagant elves,\r\n      And--oh horrid!--are talking to men!\r\n    With faces unblanched in our presence they come\r\n    To harangue us, they say, in behalf of the dumb.\r\n\r\n    They insist on their right to petition and pray,\r\n      That St. Paul, in Corinthians, has given them rules\r\n    For appearing in public; despite what those say\r\n      Whom we've trained to instruct them in schools;\r\n    But vain such instructions, if women may scan\r\n    And quote texts of Scripture to favor their plan.\r\n\r\n    Our grandmothers' learning consisted of yore\r\n      In spreading their generous boards;\r\n    In twisting the distaff, or mopping the floor,\r\n      And _obeying the will of their lords_.\r\n    Now, misses may reason, and think, and debate,\r\n    Till unquestioned submission is quite out of date.\r\n\r\n    Our clergy have preached on the sin and the shame\r\n      Of woman, when out of \"her sphere,\"\r\n    And labored _divinely_ to ruin her fame,\r\n      And shorten this horrid career;\r\n    But for spiritual guidance no longer they look\r\n    To Fulsom, or Winslow, or learned Parson Cook.\r\n\r\n    Our wise men have tried to exorcise in vain\r\n      The turbulent spirits abroad;\r\n    As well might we deal with the fetterless main,\r\n      Or conquer ethereal essence with sword;\r\n    Like the devils of Milton, they rise from each blow,\r\n    With spirit unbroken, insulting the foe.\r\n\r\n    Our patriot fathers, of eloquent fame,\r\n      Waged war against tangible forms;\r\n    Aye, _their_ foes were men--and if ours were the same,\r\n      _We_ might speedily quiet their storms;\r\n    But, ah! their descendants enjoy not such bliss--\r\n    The assumptions of Britain were nothing to this.\r\n\r\n    Could we but array all our force in the field,\r\n      We'd teach these usurpers of power\r\n    That their bodily safety demands they should yield,\r\n      And in the presence of manhood should cower;\r\n    But, alas! for our tethered and impotent state,\r\n    Chained by notions of knighthood--we can but debate.\r\n\r\n    Oh! shade of the prophet Mahomet, arise!\r\n      Place woman again in \"her sphere,\"\r\n    And teach that her soul was not born for the skies,\r\n      But to flutter a brief moment here.\r\n    This doctrine of Jesus, as preached up by Paul,\r\n    If embraced in its spirit, will ruin us all.\r\n\r\n                                        --_Lords of Creation_.\r\n\r\nOn reading the \"Pastoral Letter,\" our Quaker poet, John Greenleaf\r\nWhittier, poured out his indignation on the New England clergy in\r\nthrilling denunciations. Mr. Whittier early saw that woman's only\r\nprotection against religious and social tyranny, could be found in\r\npolitical equality. In the midst of the fierce conflicts in the\r\nAnti-Slavery Conventions of 1839 and '40, on the woman question _per\r\nse_, Mr. Whittier remarked to Lucretia Mott, \"_Give woman the right to\r\nvote_, and you end all these persecutions by reform and church\r\norganizations.\"\r\n\r\n              THE PASTORAL LETTER.\r\n\r\n    So, this is all--the utmost reach\r\n      Of priestly power the mind to fetter!\r\n    When laymen think--when women preach--\r\n      A war of words--a \"Pastoral Letter!\"\r\n    Now, shame upon ye, parish Popes!\r\n      Was it thus with those, your predecessors,\r\n    Who sealed with racks, and fire, and ropes\r\n      Their loving-kindness to transgressors?\r\n\r\n    A \"Pastoral Letter,\" grave and dull--\r\n      Alas! in hoof and horns and features,\r\n    How different is your Brookfield bull,\r\n      From him who bellows from St. Peter's!\r\n    Your pastoral rights and powers from harm,\r\n      Think ye, can words alone preserve them?\r\n    Your wiser fathers taught the arm\r\n      And sword of temporal power to serve them.\r\n\r\n    Oh, glorious days--when Church and State\r\n      Were wedded by your spiritual fathers!\r\n    And on submissive shoulders sat\r\n      Yours Wilsons and your Cotton Mathers.\r\n    No vile \"itinerant\" then could mar\r\n      The beauty of your tranquil Zion,\r\n    But at his peril of the scar\r\n      Of hangman's whip and branding-iron.\r\n\r\n    Then, wholesome laws relieved the Church\r\n      Of heretic and mischief-maker.\r\n    And priest and bailiff joined in search,\r\n      By turns, of Papist, witch, and Quaker!\r\n    The stocks were at each church's door,\r\n      The gallows stood on Boston Common,\r\n    A Papist's ears the pillory bore--\r\n      The gallows-rope, a Quaker woman!\r\n\r\n    Your fathers dealt not as ye deal\r\n      With \"non-professing\" frantic teachers;\r\n    They bored the tongue with red-hot steel,\r\n      And flayed the backs of \"female preachers.\"\r\n    Old Newbury, had her fields a tongue,\r\n      And Salem's streets could tell their story,\r\n    Of fainting woman dragged along,\r\n      Gashed by the whip, accursed and gory!\r\n\r\n    And will ye ask me, why this taunt\r\n      Of memories sacred from the scorner?\r\n    And why with reckless hand I plant\r\n      A nettle on the graves ye honor?\r\n    Not to reproach New England's dead\r\n      This record from the past I summon,\r\n    Of manhood to the scaffold led,\r\n      And suffering and heroic woman.\r\n\r\n    No--for yourselves alone, I turn\r\n      The pages of intolerance over,\r\n    That, in their spirit, dark and stern,\r\n      Ye haply may your own discover!\r\n    For, if ye claim the \"pastoral right,\"\r\n      To silence freedom's voice of warning,\r\n    And from your precincts shut the light\r\n      Of Freedom's day around ye dawning;\r\n\r\n    If when an earthquake voice of power,\r\n      And signs in earth and heaven, are showing\r\n    That forth, in the appointed hour,\r\n      The Spirit of the Lord is going!\r\n    And, with that Spirit, Freedom's light\r\n      On kindred, tongue, and people breaking,\r\n    Whose slumbering millions, at the sight,\r\n      In glory and in strength are waking!\r\n\r\n    When for the sighing of the poor,\r\n      And for the needy, God hath risen,\r\n    And chains are breaking, and a door\r\n      Is opening for the souls in prison!\r\n    If then ye would, with puny hands,\r\n      Arrest the very work of Heaven,\r\n    And bind anew the evil bands\r\n      Which God's right arm of power hath riven,--\r\n\r\n    What marvel that, in many a mind,\r\n      Those darker deeds of bigot madness\r\n    Are closely with your own combined,\r\n      Yet \"less in anger than in sadness\"?\r\n    What marvel, if the people learn\r\n      To claim the right of free opinion?\r\n    What marvel, if at times they spurn\r\n      The ancient yoke of your dominion?\r\n\r\n    A glorious remnant linger yet,\r\n      Whose lips are wet at Freedom's fountains,\r\n    The coming of whose welcome feet\r\n      Is beautiful upon our mountains!\r\n    Men, who the gospel tidings bring\r\n      Of Liberty and Love forever,\r\n    Whose joy is an abiding spring,\r\n      Whose peace is as a gentle river!\r\n\r\n    But ye, who scorn the thrilling tale\r\n      Of Carolina's high-souled daughters,\r\n    Which echoes here the mournful wail\r\n      Of sorrow from Edisto's waters,\r\n    Close while ye may the public ear--\r\n      With malice vex, with slander wound them--\r\n    The pure and good shall throng to hear,\r\n      And tried and manly hearts surround them.\r\n\r\n    Oh, ever may the power which led\r\n      Their way to such a fiery trial,\r\n    And strengthened womanhood to tread\r\n      The wine-press of such self-denial,\r\n    Be round them in an evil land,\r\n      With wisdom and with strength from Heaven,\r\n    With Miriam's voice, and Judith's hand,\r\n      And Deborah's song, for triumph given!\r\n\r\n    And what are ye who strive with God\r\n      Against the ark of His salvation,\r\n    Moved by the breath of prayer abroad,\r\n      With blessings for a dying nation?\r\n    What, but the stubble and the hay\r\n      To perish, even as flax consuming,\r\n    With all that bars His glorious way,\r\n      Before the brightness of His coming?\r\n\r\n    And thou, sad Angel, who so long\r\n      Hast waited for the glorious token,\r\n    That Earth from all her bonds of wrong\r\n      To liberty and light has broken--\r\n    Angel of Freedom! soon to thee\r\n      The sounding trumpet shall be given,\r\n    And over Earth's full jubilee\r\n      Shall deeper joy be felt in Heaven!\r\n\r\nIn answer to the many objections made, by gentlemen present, to\r\ngranting to woman the right of suffrage, Frederick Douglass replied in\r\na long, argumentative, and eloquent appeal, for the complete equality\r\nof woman in all the rights that belong to any human soul. He thought\r\nthe true basis of rights was the capacity of individuals; and as for\r\nhimself, he should not dare claim a right that he would not concede to\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nThis Convention continued through three sessions, and was crowded with\r\nan attentive audience to the hour of adjournment. The daily papers\r\nmade fair reports, and varied editorial comments, which, being widely\r\ncopied, called out spicy controversies in different parts of the\r\ncountry. The resolutions and discussions regarding woman's right to\r\nenter the professions, encouraged many to prepare themselves for\r\nmedicine and the ministry. Though few women responded to the demand\r\nfor political rights, many at once saw the importance of equality in\r\nthe world of work.\r\n\r\nThe Seneca Falls Declaration was adopted, and signed by large numbers\r\nof influential men and women of Rochester and vicinity, and at a late\r\nhour the Convention adjourned, in the language of its President, \"with\r\nhearts overflowing with gratitude.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] The antique mahogany center-table on which this historic document\r\nwas written now stands in the parlor of the McClintock family in\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\n[9] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[10] Rebecca Sanford, now Postmaster at Mt.

I revolted in spirit\r\nagainst the customs of society and the laws of the State that crushed\r\nmy aspirations and debarred me from the pursuit of almost every object\r\nworthy of an intelligent, rational mind. But not until that meeting at\r\nSeneca Falls in 1848, of the pioneers in the cause, gave this feeling\r\nof unrest form and voice, did I take action. Then I summoned a few\r\nwomen in our neighborhood together and formed an Equal Suffrage\r\nSociety, and sent petitions to our Legislature; but our efforts were\r\nlittle known beyond our circle, as we were in communication with no\r\nperson or newspaper. Yet there was enough of wrong in our narrow\r\nhorizon to rouse some thought in the minds of all.\r\n\r\nIn those early days a husband's supremacy was often enforced in the\r\nrural districts by corporeal chastisement, and it was considered by\r\nmost people as quite right and proper--as much so as the correction of\r\nrefractory children in like manner. I remember in my own neighborhood\r\na man who was a Methodist class-leader and exhorter, and one who was\r\nesteemed a worthy citizen, who, every few weeks, gave his wife a\r\nbeating with his horsewhip. He said it was necessary, in order to keep\r\nher in subjection, and because she scolded so much. Now this wife,\r\nsurrounded by six or seven little children, whom she must wash, dress,\r\nfeed, and attend to day and night, was obliged to spin and weave cloth\r\nfor all the garments of the family. She had to milk the cows, make\r\nbutter and cheese, do all the cooking, washing, making, and mending\r\nfor the family, and, with the pains of maternity forced upon her every\r\neighteen months, was whipped by her pious husband, \"because she\r\nscolded.\" And pray, why should he not have chastised her? The laws\r\nmade it his privilege--and the Bible, as interpreted, made it his\r\nduty. It is true, women repined at their hard lot; but it was thought\r\nto be fixed by a divine decree, for \"The man shall rule over thee,\"\r\nand \"Wives, be subject to your husbands,\" and \"Wives, submit\r\nyourselves unto your husbands as unto the Lord,\" caused them to\r\nconsider their fate inevitable, and to feel that it would be\r\ncontravening God's law to resist it. It is ever thus; where Theology\r\nenchains the soul, the Tyrant enslaves the body. But can any one, who\r\nhas any knowledge of the laws that govern our being--of heredity and\r\npre-natal influences--be astonished that our jails and prisons are\r\nfilled with criminals, and our hospitals with sickly specimens of\r\nhumanity? As long as the mothers of the race are subject to such\r\nunhappy conditions, it can never be materially improved. Men exhibit\r\nsome common sense in breeding all animals except those of their own\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nAll through the Anti-Slavery struggle, every word of denunciation of\r\nthe wrongs of the Southern slave, was, I felt, equally applicable to\r\nthe wrongs of my own sex. Every argument for the emancipation of the\r\ncolored man, was equally one for that of woman; and I was surprised\r\nthat all Abolitionists did not see the similarity in the condition of\r\nthe two classes. I read, with intense interest, everything that\r\nindicated an awakening of public or private thought to the idea that\r\nwoman did not occupy her rightful position in the organization of\r\nsociety; and, when I read the lectures of Ernestine L. Rose and the\r\nwritings of Margaret Fuller, and found that other women entertained\r\nthe same thoughts that had been seething in my own brain, and realized\r\nthat I stood not alone, how my heart bounded with joy! The arguments\r\nof that distinguished jurist, Judge Hurlburt, encouraged me to hope\r\nthat men would ultimately see the justice of our cause, and concede to\r\nwomen their natural rights.\r\n\r\nI hailed with gladness any aspiration of women toward an enlargement\r\nof their sphere of action; and when, in the early part of 1848, I\r\nlearned that Miss Elizabeth Blackwell had been admitted as a student\r\nto the medical college at Geneva, N. Y., being the first lady in the\r\nUnited States that had attained that privilege, and knowing the tide\r\nof public sentiment she had to stem, I could not refrain from writing\r\nher a letter of approval and encouragement. In return I received the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n                                   PHILADELPHIA, _August 12, 1848_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR MADAM:--Your letter, I can assure you, met with a hearty\r\n     welcome from me. And I can not refrain from writing to you a warm\r\n     acknowledgment of your cordial sympathy, and expressing the\r\n     pleasure with which I have read your brave words. It is true, I\r\n     look neither for praise nor blame in pursuing the path which I\r\n     have chosen. With firm religious enthusiasm, no opinion of the\r\n     world will move me, but when I receive from a woman an approval\r\n     so true-hearted and glowing, a recognition so clear of the\r\n     motives which urge me on, then my very soul bounds at the\r\n     thrilling words, and I go on with renewed energy, with hope, and\r\n     holy joy in my inmost being.\r\n\r\n     My whole life is devoted unreservedly to the service of my sex.\r\n     The study and practice of medicine is in my thought but one means\r\n     to a great end, for which my very soul yearns with in tensest\r\n     passionate emotion, of which I have dreamed day and night, from\r\n     my earliest childhood, for which I would offer up my life with\r\n     triumphant thanksgiving, if martyrdom could secure that glorious\r\n     end:--the true ennoblement of woman, the full harmonious\r\n     development of her unknown nature, and the consequent redemption\r\n     of the whole human race. \"Earth waits for her queen.\" Every noble\r\n     movement of the age, every prophecy of future glory, every throb\r\n     of that great heart which is laboring throughout Christendom,\r\n     call on woman with a voice of thunder, with the authority of a\r\n     God, to listen to the mighty summons to awake from her guilty\r\n     sleep, and rouse to glorious action to play her part in the great\r\n     drama of the ages, and finish the work that man has begun.\r\n\r\n     Most fully do I respond to all the noble aspirations that fill\r\n     your letter. Women are feeble, narrow, frivolous at present:\r\n     ignorant of their own capacities, and undeveloped in thought and\r\n     feeling; and while they remain so, the great work of human\r\n     regeneration must remain incomplete; humanity will continue to\r\n     suffer, and cry in vain for deliverance, for woman has her work\r\n     to do, and no one can accomplish it for her. She is bound to\r\n     rise, to try her strength, to break her bonds;--not with noisy\r\n     outcry, not with fighting or complaint; but with quiet strength,\r\n     with gentle dignity, firmly, irresistibly, with a cool\r\n     determination that never wavers, with a clear insight into her\r\n     own capacities, let her do her duty, pursue her highest\r\n     conviction of right, and firmly grasp whatever she is able to\r\n     carry.\r\n\r\n     Much is said of the oppression woman suffers; man is reproached\r\n     with being unjust, tyrannical, jealous. I do not so read human\r\n     life. The exclusion and constraint woman suffers, is not the\r\n     result of purposed injury or premeditated insult. It has arisen\r\n     naturally, without violence, simply because woman has desired\r\n     nothing more, has not felt the soul too large for the body. But\r\n     when woman, with matured strength, with steady purpose, presents\r\n     her lofty claim, all barriers will give way, and man will\r\n     welcome, with a thrill of joy, the new birth of his sister\r\n     spirit, the advent of his partner, his co-worker, in the great\r\n     universe of being.\r\n\r\n     If the present arrangements of society will not admit of woman's\r\n     free development, then society must be remodeled, and adapted to\r\n     the great wants of all humanity. Our race is one, the interests\r\n     of all are inseparably united, and harmonic freedom for the\r\n     perfect growth of every human soul is the great want of our time.\r\n     It has given me heartfelt satisfaction, dear madam, that you\r\n     sympathize in my effort to advance the great interests of\r\n     humanity. I feel the responsibility of my position, and I shall\r\n     endeavor, by wisdom of action, purity of motive, and unwavering\r\n     steadiness of purpose, to justify the noble hope I have excited.\r\n     To me the future is full of glorious promise, humanity is\r\n     arousing to accomplish its grand destiny, and in the fellowship\r\n     of this great hope, I would greet you, and recognize in your\r\n     noble spirit a fellow-laborer for the true and the good.\r\n\r\n                                             ELIZABETH BLACKWELL.\r\n     MRS. EMILY COLLINS.\r\n\r\nBut, it was the proceedings of the Convention, in 1848, at Seneca\r\nFalls, that first gave a direction to the efforts of the many women,\r\nwho began to feel the degradation of their subject condition, and its\r\nbaneful effects upon the human race. They then saw the necessity for\r\nassociated action, in order to obtain the elective franchise, the only\r\nkey that would unlock the doors of their prison. I wrote to Miss Sarah\r\nC. Owen, Secretary of the Women's Protective Union, at Rochester, as\r\nto the line of procedure that had been proposed there. In reply, under\r\ndate of October 1, 1848, she says:\r\n\r\n     Your letter has just reached me, and with much pleasure I reply\r\n     to the echo of inquiry, beyond the bounds of those personally\r\n     associated with us in this enterprise. It is indeed encouraging\r\n     to hear a voice from South Bristol in such perfect unison with\r\n     our own.\r\n\r\nPossibly, extracts from my next letter to Miss Owen, dated Oct. 23,\r\n1848, will give you the best idea of the movement:\r\n\r\n     I should have acknowledged the receipt of yours of the 1st inst.\r\n     earlier, but wished to report somewhat of progress whenever I\r\n     should write. Our prospects here are brightening. Every lady of\r\n     any worth or intelligence adopts unhesitatingly our view, and\r\n     concurs in our measures. On the 19th inst. we met and organized a\r\n     Woman's Equal Rights Union. Living in the country, where the\r\n     population is sparse, we are consequently few; but hope to make\r\n     up in zeal and energy for our lack of numbers. We breathe a\r\n     freer, if not a purer atmosphere here among the mountains, than\r\n     do the dwellers in cities,--have more independence,--are less\r\n     subject to the despotism of fashion, and are less absorbed with\r\n     dress and amusements.... A press entirely devoted to our cause\r\n     seems indispensable. If there is none such, can you tell me of\r\n     any paper that advocates our claims more warmly than the _North\r\n     Star_?[12] A lecturer in the field would be most desirable; but\r\n     how to raise funds to sustain one is the question. I never really\r\n     wished for Aladdin's lamp till now. Would to Heaven that women\r\n     could be persuaded to use the funds they acquire by their\r\n     sewing-circles and fairs, in trying to raise their own condition\r\n     above that of \"infants, idiots, and lunatics,\" with whom our\r\n     statutes class them, instead of spending the money in decorating\r\n     their churches, or sustaining a clergy, the most of whom are\r\n     striving to rivet the chains still closer that bind, not only our\r\n     own sex, but the oppressed of every class and color.\r\n\r\n     The elective franchise is now the one object for which we must\r\n     labor; that once attained, all the rest will be easily acquired.\r\n     Moral Reform and Temperance Societies may be multiplied _ad\r\n     infinitum_, but they have about the same effect upon the evils\r\n     they seek to cure, as clipping the top of a hedge would have\r\n     toward extirpating it. Please forward me a copy of the petition\r\n     for suffrage. We will engage to do all we can, not only in our\r\n     own town, but in the adjoining ones of Richmond, East Bloomfield,\r\n     Canandaigua, and Naples. I have promises of aid from people of\r\n     influence in obtaining signatures. In the meantime we wish to\r\n     disseminate some able work upon the enfranchisement of women. We\r\n     wish to present our Assemblyman elect, whoever he may be, with\r\n     some work of this kind, and solicit his candid attention to the\r\n     subject. People are more willing to be convinced by the calm\r\n     perusal of an argument, than in a personal discussion....\r\n\r\nOur Society was composed of some fifteen or twenty ladies, and we met\r\nonce in two weeks, in each other's parlors, alternately, for\r\ndiscussion and interchange of ideas. I was chosen President; Mrs.\r\nSophia Allen, Vice-President; Mrs. Horace Pennell, Treasurer; and one\r\nof several young ladies who were members was Secretary. Horace\r\nPennell, Esq., and his wife were two of our most earnest helpers. We\r\ndrafted a petition to the Legislature to grant women the right of\r\nsuffrage, and obtained the names of sixty-two of the most intelligent\r\npeople, male and female, in our own and adjoining towns, and sent it\r\nto our Representative in Albany. It was received by the Legislature as\r\nsomething absurdly ridiculous, and laid upon the table. We introduced\r\nthe question into the Debating Clubs, that were in those days such\r\npopular institutions in the rural districts, and in every way sought\r\nto agitate the subject. I found a great many men, especially those of\r\nthe better class, disposed to accord equal rights to our sex. And,\r\nnow, as the highest tribute that I can pay to the memory of a husband,\r\nI may say that during our companionship of thirty-five years, I was\r\nmost cordially sustained by mine, in my advocacy of equal rights to\r\nwomen. Amongst my own sex, I found too many on whom ages of repression\r\nhad wrought their natural effect, and whose ideas and aspirations were\r\nnarrowed down to the confines of \"woman's sphere,\" beyond whose limits\r\nit was not only impious, but infamous to tread. \"Woman's sphere\"\r\n_then_, was to discharge the duties of a housekeeper, ply the needle,\r\nand teach a primary or ladies' school. From press, and pulpit, and\r\nplatform, she was taught that \"to be unknown was her highest praise,\"\r\nthat \"dependence was her best protection,\" and \"her weakness her\r\nsweetest charm.\" She needed only sufficient intelligence to comprehend\r\nher husband's superiority, and to obey him in all things. It is not\r\nsurprising, then, that I as often heard the terms \"strong-minded\" and\r\n\"masculine\" as opprobrious epithets used against progressive women, by\r\ntheir own sex as by the other; another example only of the stultifying\r\neffect of subjection, upon the mind, exactly paralleled by the\r\nSouthern slaves, amongst many of whom the strongest term of contempt\r\nthat could be used was \"_Free Nigger_.\" Our Equal Rights Association\r\ncontinued to hold its meetings for somewhat over a year, and they were\r\nat last suspended on account of bad weather and the difficulty of\r\ncoming together in the country districts. We, however, continued to\r\nsend petitions to the Legislature for the removal of woman's\r\ndisabilities.\r\n\r\nFrom 1858 to 1869 my home was in Rochester, N. Y. There, by brief\r\nnewspaper articles and in other ways, I sought to influence public\r\nsentiment in favor of this fundamental reform. In 1868 a Society was\r\norganized there for the reformation of abandoned women. At one of its\r\nmeetings I endeavored to show how futile all their efforts would be,\r\nwhile women, by the laws of the land, were made a subject class; that\r\nonly by enfranchising woman and permitting her a more free and\r\nlucrative range of employments, could they hope to suppress the\r\n\"social evil.\" My remarks produced some agitation in the meeting and\r\nsome newspaper criticisms. In Rochester, I found many pioneers in the\r\ncause of Woman Suffrage, and from year to year we petitioned our\r\nLegislature for it.\r\n\r\nSince 1869 I have been a citizen of Louisiana. Here, till recently,\r\npolitical troubles engrossed the minds of men to the exclusion of\r\nevery other consideration. They glowed with fiery indignation at\r\nbeing, themselves, deprived of the right of suffrage, or at having\r\ntheir votes annulled, and regarded it as an intolerable outrage; yet,\r\nat the same time, they denied it to all women, many of whom valued the\r\nelective franchise as highly, and felt as intensely, as did men, the\r\ninjustice that withheld it from them. In 1879, when the Convention met\r\nto frame a new Constitution for the State, we strongly petitioned it\r\nfor an enlargement of our civil rights and for the ballot. Mrs.\r\nElizabeth L. Saxon was indefatigable in her efforts, and went before\r\nthe Convention in person and plead our cause. But the majority of the\r\nmembers thought there were cogent reasons for not granting our\r\npetitions; but they made women eligible to all school offices--an\r\nindication that Louisiana will not be the last State in the Union to\r\ndeny women their inalienable rights.\r\n\r\n                                             EMILY COLLINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe newspaper comments on Elizabeth Blackwell as a physician, both in\r\nthe French and American papers, seem very ridiculous to us at this\r\ndistance of time. _The American_, Rochester, N. Y., July, 1848:\r\n\r\n     A NOVEL CIRCUMSTANCE.--Our readers will perhaps remember that\r\n     some time ago a lady, Miss Elizabeth Blackwell, applied for\r\n     admission as a student in one of the medical colleges of\r\n     Philadelphia, her purpose being to go through an entire course of\r\n     the study of medicine. The application was denied, and the lady\r\n     subsequently entered the Geneva Medical College, where, at the\r\n     Annual Commencement on the 23d instant, she graduated with high\r\n     honors and received the degree of M.D., the subject of her thesis\r\n     being \"ship fever.\" On receiving her diploma she thus addressed\r\n     the President: \"With the help of the Most High, it shall be the\r\n     effort of my life to shed honor on this diploma.\" Professor Lee,\r\n     who delivered the customary oration, complimented the lady by\r\n     saying that she had won the distinction of her class by attending\r\n     faithfully to every duty required of candidates striving for the\r\n     honor. Eighteen young gentlemen received the degree of M.D. at\r\n     the same time.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating with high honors in this country, Dr. Elizabeth\r\nBlackwell went to France to secure still higher advantages of\r\neducation than could be found here. What was thought of her there will\r\nbe seen by the following letter of a Paris correspondent in the New\r\nYork _Journal of Commerce_:\r\n\r\n     AN AMERICAN DOCTRESS.--The medical community of Paris is all agog\r\n     by the arrival of the celebrated American doctor, Miss Blackwell.\r\n     She has quite bewildered the learned faculty by her diploma, all\r\n     in due form, authorizing her to dose and bleed and amputate with\r\n     the best of them. Some of them think Miss Blackwell must be a\r\n     socialist of the most rabid class, and that her undertaking is\r\n     the entering wedge to a systematic attack on society by the whole\r\n     sex. Others, who have seen her, say that there is nothing very\r\n     alarming in her manner; that, on the contrary, she is modest and\r\n     unassuming, and talks reasonably on other subjects. The ladies\r\n     attack her in turn. One said to me a few days since, \"Oh, it is\r\n     too horrid! I'm sure I never could touch her hand! Only to think\r\n     that those long fingers of hers had been cutting up dead people.\"\r\n     I have seen the doctor in question, and must say in fairness,\r\n     that her appearance is quite prepossessing. She is young, and\r\n     rather good-looking; her manner indicates great energy of\r\n     character, and she seems to have entered on her singular career\r\n     from motives of duty, and encouraged by respectable ladies of\r\n     Cincinnati. After about ten days' hesitation, on the part of the\r\n     directors of the Hospital of Maternity, she has at last received\r\n     permission to enter the institution as a pupil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nERNESTINE L. ROSE.\r\n\r\nBY L. E. BARNARD.\r\n\r\nErnestine L. Rose--maiden name Siismund Potoski--was born January 13,\r\n1810, at Pyeterkow, in Poland. Her father, a very pious and learned\r\nrabbi, was so conscientious that he would take no pay for discharging\r\nthe functions of his office, saying he would not convert his duty into\r\na means of gain. As a child she was of a reflective habit, and though\r\nvery active and cheerful, she scarcely ever engaged with her young\r\ncompanions in their sports, but took great delight in the company of\r\nher father, for whom she entertained a remarkable affection.\r\n\r\nAt a very early age she commenced reading the Hebrew Scriptures, but\r\nsoon became involved in serious difficulties respecting the formation\r\nof the world, the origin of evil, and other obscure points suggested\r\nby the sacred history and cosmogony of her people. The reproofs which\r\nmet her at every step of her biblical investigations, and being\r\nconstantly told that \"little girls must not ask questions,\" made her\r\nat that early day an advocate of religious freedom and woman's rights;\r\nas she could not see, on the one hand, why subjects of vital interest\r\nshould be held too sacred for investigation, nor, on the other, why a\r\n\"little girl\" should not have the same right to ask questions as a\r\nlittle boy. Despite her early investigation of the Bible, she was\r\nnoted for her strict observance of all the rites and ceremonies of the\r\nJewish faith, though some of them, on account of her tender age, were\r\nnot demanded of her. She was, however, often painfully disturbed by\r\nher \"carnal reason\" questioning the utility of these multifarious\r\nobservances. As an illustration, she one day asked her father, with\r\nmuch anxiety, why he fasted[13] so much more than others, a habit\r\nwhich was seriously impairing his health and spirits; and being told\r\nthat it was to please God, who required this sacrifice at his hands,\r\nshe, in a serious and most emphatic tone, replied, \"If God is pleased\r\nin making you sick and unhappy, I hate God.\" This idea of the cruelty\r\nof God toward her father had a remarkable influence upon her; and at\r\nthe age of fourteen she renounced her belief in the Bible and the\r\nreligion of her father, which brought down upon her great trouble and\r\npersecution alike from her own Jewish friends and from Christians.\r\n\r\nAt the age of sixteen she had the misfortune to lose her mother. A\r\nyear afterward her father married again, and through misdirected\r\nkindness involved her in a lawsuit, in which she plead her own case\r\nand won it; but she left the property with her father, declaring that\r\nshe cared nothing for it, but only for justice, and that her\r\ninheritance might not fall into mercenary hands. She subsequently\r\ntraveled in Poland, Russia, the Germanic States, Holland, Belgium,\r\nFrance, and England; during which time she witnessed and took part in\r\nsome interesting and important affairs. While in Berlin she had an\r\ninterview with the King of Prussia concerning the right of Polish Jews\r\nto remain in that city. The Jews of Russian Poland were not permitted\r\nto continue in Prussia, unless they could bring forward as security\r\nPrussian citizens who were holders of real estate. But even then they\r\ncould get a permit to tarry only on a visit, and not to transact any\r\nbusiness for themselves. Mlle. Potoski, being from Poland and a\r\nJewess, was subject to this disability. Though she could have obtained\r\nthe requisite security by applying for it, she preferred to stand upon\r\nher natural rights as a human being. She remonstrated against the\r\ngross injustice of the law, and obtained the right to remain as long\r\nas she wished, and to do what she pleased.\r\n\r\nIn Hague, she became acquainted with a very distressing case of a poor\r\nsailor, the father of four children, whose wife had been imprisoned\r\nfor an alleged crime of which he insisted she was innocent. Inquiring\r\ninto the case, Mlle. Potoski drew up a petition which she personally\r\npresented to the King of Holland, and had the satisfaction of seeing\r\nthe poor woman restored to her family. She was in Paris during the\r\nRevolution of July, 1830, and witnessed most of its exciting scenes.\r\nOn seeing Louis Phillipe presented by Lafayette to the people of Paris\r\nfrom the balcony of the Tuilleries, she remarked to a friend, \"That\r\nman, as well as Charles X., will one day have good reason to wish\r\nhimself safely off the throne of France.\"\r\n\r\nIn England she became acquainted with Lord Grosvenor and family, with\r\nFrances Farrar, sister of Oliver Farrar, M.P., the Miss Leeds, and\r\nothers of the nobility; also with many prominent members of the\r\nSociety of Friends, among them Joseph Gurney and his sister Elizabeth\r\nFry, the eminent philanthropist, in whose company she visited Newgate\r\nPrison. In 1832 she made the acquaintance of Robert Owen, and warmly\r\nespoused his principles. In 1834 she presided at the formation of a\r\nsociety called \"The Association of all Classes of all Nations,\r\nwithout distinction of sect, sex, party condition, or color.\" While in\r\nEngland she married William E. Rose, and in the spring of 1836, came\r\nto the United States, and resided in the city of New York. Soon after\r\nher arrival she commenced lecturing on the evils of the existing\r\nsocial system, the formation of human character, slavery, the rights\r\nof woman, and other reform questions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ERNESTINE L. ROSE (with autograph).]\r\n\r\nAt a great public meeting in the Broadway Tabernacle to consider the\r\nnecessity of an improved system of Free Schools, J. S. Buckingham,\r\nM.P., of England, and Rev. Robert Breckenridge, of Kentucky, were\r\namong the speakers. Mrs. Rose, sitting in the gallery, called the\r\nreverend gentleman to order for violating the sense of the audience,\r\nin entirely overlooking the important object which had called the\r\npeople together, and indulging in a violent clerical harangue against\r\na class whom he stigmatized as infidels. This bold innovation of a\r\nwoman upon the hitherto unquestioned prerogatives of the clergy, at\r\nonce caused a tremendous excitement. Loud cries of \"Throw her down!\"\r\n\"Drag her out!\" \"She's an infidel!\" resounded in all parts of the\r\nbuilding. She, however, held her ground, calm and collected while the\r\ntumult lasted, and after quiet was restored, continued her remarks in\r\na most dignified manner, making a deep impression upon all present.\r\nCertain religious papers declared it a forewarning of some terrible\r\ncalamity, that a woman should call a minister to account, and that,\r\ntoo, in a church.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rose has lectured in not less than twenty-three different States\r\nof the Union. Some of them she has visited often, and on several\r\noccasions she has addressed legislative bodies with marked effect,\r\nadvocating the necessity of legal redress for the wrongs and\r\ndisabilities to which her sex are subject. As an advocate of woman's\r\nrights, anti-slavery and religious liberty, she has earned a\r\nworld-wide celebrity. For fifty years a public speaker, during which\r\nperiod she has associated with the influential classes in Europe and\r\nAmerica, and borne an active part in the great progressive movements\r\nwhich mark the present as the most glorious of historical epochs,\r\nErnestine L. Rose has accomplished for the elevation of her sex and\r\nthe amelioration of social conditions, a work which can be ascribed to\r\nfew women of our time.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1854, Mrs. Rose and Miss Anthony took a trip together\r\nto Washington, Alexandria, Baltimore, Philadelphia, speaking two or\r\nthree times in each place. This was after the introduction of the\r\nKansas-Nebraska Bill in Congress, and the excitement of the country\r\nupon the slavery question was intense. Mrs. Rose's third lecture in\r\nWashington was on the \"Nebraska Question.\" This lecture was scarcely\r\nnoticed, the only paper giving it the least report, being _The\r\nWashington Globe_, which, though it spoke most highly of her as a\r\nlecturer, misrepresented her by ascribing to her the arguments of the\r\nSouth. _The National Era_, the only anti-slavery paper in Washington,\r\nwas entirely silent, taking no notice of the fact that Mrs. Rose had\r\nspoken in that city against the further spread of slavery. Whether\r\nthis was due to editorial prejudice against sex, or against freedom of\r\nreligious belief, is unknown.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1855, Mrs. Rose spoke in thirteen of the fifty-four\r\nCounty Conventions upon woman suffrage held in the State of New York,\r\nand each winter took part in the Albany Conventions and hearings\r\nbefore the Legislature, which in 1860 resulted in the passage of the\r\nbill securing to women the right to their wages and the equal\r\nguardianship of their children.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rose was sustained in her work by the earnest sympathy of her\r\nhusband, who gladly furnished her the means of making her extensive\r\ntours, so that through his sense of justice she was enabled to preach\r\nthe Gospel of Woman's Rights, Anti-Slavery, and Free Religion without\r\nmoney and without price.\r\n\r\n_The Boston Investigator_ of January 15, 1881, speaking of a letter\r\njust received from her, says: \"Thirty years ago Mrs. Rose was in her\r\nprime--an excellent lecturer, liberal, eloquent, witty, and we must\r\nadd, decidedly handsome--'the Rose that all were praising.' Her\r\nportrait, life-size and very natural, hangs in Investigator Hall, and\r\nher intelligent-looking and expressive countenance, and black glossy\r\ncurls, denote intellect and beauty. As an anti-slavery lecturer, a\r\npioneer in the cause of woman's rights, and an advocate of Liberalism,\r\nshe did good service, and is worthy to be classed with such devoted\r\nfriends of humanity and freedom as Frances Wright, Harriet Martineau,\r\nLucretia Mott, and Lydia Maria Child, who will long be pleasantly\r\nremembered for their 'works' sake.'\"\r\n\r\n                                   LONDON, _January 9, 1877_.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR MISS ANTHONY:--Sincerely do I thank you for your kind\r\n     letter. Believe me it would give me great pleasure to comply with\r\n     your request, to tell you all about myself and my past labors;\r\n     but I suffer so much from neuralgia in my head and general\r\n     debility, that I could not undertake the task, especially as I\r\n     have nothing to refer to. I have never spoken from notes; and as\r\n     I did not intend to publish anything about myself, for I had no\r\n     other ambition except to work for the cause of humanity,\r\n     irrespective of sex, sect, country, or color, and did not expect\r\n     that a Susan B. Anthony would wish to do it for me, I made no\r\n     memorandum of places, dates, or names; and thirty or forty years\r\n     ago the press was not sufficiently educated in the rights of\r\n     woman, even to notice, much less to report speeches as it does\r\n     now; and therefore I have not anything to assist me or you.\r\n\r\n     All that I can tell you is, that I used my humble powers to the\r\n     uttermost, and raised my voice in behalf of Human Rights in\r\n     general, and the elevation and Rights of Woman in particular,\r\n     nearly all my life. And so little have I spared myself, or\r\n     studied my comfort in summer or winter, rain or shine, day or\r\n     night, when I had an opportunity to work for the cause to which I\r\n     had devoted myself, that I can hardly wonder at my present state\r\n     of health.\r\n\r\n     Yet in spite of hardships, for it was not as easy to travel at\r\n     that time as now, and the expense, as I never made a charge or\r\n     took up a collection, I look back to that time, when a stranger\r\n     and alone, I went from place to place, in high-ways and by-ways,\r\n     did the work and paid my bills with great pleasure and\r\n     satisfaction; for the cause gained ground, and in spite of my\r\n     heresies I had always good audiences, attentive listeners, and\r\n     was well received wherever I went.\r\n\r\n     But I can mention from memory the principal places where I have\r\n     spoken. In the winter of 1836 and '37, I spoke in New York, and\r\n     for some years after I lectured in almost every city in the\r\n     State; Hudson, Poughkeepsie, Albany, Schenectady; Saratoga,\r\n     Utica, Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, Elmira, and other places; in\r\n     New Jersey, in Newark and Burlington; in 1837, in Philadelphia,\r\n     Bristol, Chester, Pittsburg, and other places in Pennsylvania,\r\n     and at Wilmington in Delaware; in 1842, in Boston, Charlestown,\r\n     Beverly, Florence, Springfield, and other points in\r\n     Massachusetts, and in Hartford, Connecticut; in 1844, in\r\n     Cincinnati, Dayton, Zanesville, Springfield, Cleveland, Toledo,\r\n     and several settlements in the backwoods of Ohio, and also in\r\n     Richmond, Indiana; in 1845 and '46, I lectured three times in the\r\n     Legislative Hall in Detroit, and at Ann Arbor and other places in\r\n     Michigan; and in 1847 and '48, I spoke in Charleston and\r\n     Columbia, in South Carolina.\r\n\r\n     In 1850, I attended the first National Woman's Rights Convention\r\n     in Worcester, and nearly all the National and State Conventions\r\n     since, until I went to Europe in 1869. Returning to New York in\r\n     1874, I was present at the Convention in Irving Hall, the only\r\n     one held during my visit to America.\r\n\r\n     I sent the first petition to the New York Legislature to give a\r\n     married woman the right to hold real estate in her own name, in\r\n     the winter of 1836 and '37, to which after a good deal of trouble\r\n     I obtained five signatures. Some of the ladies said the gentlemen\r\n     would laugh at them; others, that they had rights enough; and the\r\n     men said the women had too many rights already. Woman at that\r\n     time had not learned to know that she had any rights except those\r\n     that man in his generosity allowed her; both have learned\r\n     something since that time which they will never forget. I\r\n     continued sending petitions with increased numbers of signatures\r\n     until 1848 and '49, when the Legislature enacted the law which\r\n     granted to woman the right to keep what was her own. But no\r\n     sooner did it become legal than all the women said, \"Oh! that is\r\n     right! We ought always to have had that.\"\r\n\r\n     During the eleven years from 1837 to 1848, I addressed the New\r\n     York Legislature five times, and since 1848 I can not say\r\n     positively, but a good many times; you know all that better than\r\n     any one else.\r\n\r\n                         Your affectionate friend,\r\n                                           ERNESTINE L. ROSE.\r\n\r\nIn collecting the reminiscences of those who took the initiative steps\r\nin this movement, Mrs. Rose was urged to send us some of her\r\nexperiences, but in writing that it was impossible for her to do so,\r\nand yet giving us the above summary of all she has accomplished,\r\n_multum in parvo_, she has in a good measure complied with our\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nAll through these eventful years Mrs. Rose has fought a double battle;\r\nnot only for the political rights of her sex as women, but for their\r\nreligious rights as individual souls; to do their own thinking and\r\nbelieving. How much of the freedom they now enjoy, the women of\r\nAmerica owe to this noble Polish woman, can not be estimated, for\r\nmoral influences are too subtle for measurement.\r\n\r\nThose who sat with her on the platform in bygone days, well remember\r\nher matchless powers as a speaker; and how safe we all felt while she\r\nhad the floor, that neither in manner, sentiment, argument, nor\r\nrepartee, would she in any way compromise the dignity of the occasion.\r\n\r\nShe had a rich musical voice, with just enough of foreign accent and\r\nidiom to add to the charm of her oratory. As a speaker she was\r\npointed, logical, and impassioned. She not only dealt in abstract\r\nprinciples clearly, but in their application touched the deepest\r\nemotions of the human soul.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] Published by Frederick Douglass, the first colored man that\r\nedited a paper in this country.

Being\r\nseparated from the slave border by her river only, Ohio had long been\r\nthe promised land of fugitives, and the battle-ground for many\r\nrecaptured victims, involving much litigation.\r\n\r\nMost stringent laws had been passed, called \"the black laws of Ohio,\"\r\nto prevent these escapes through her territory. Hence, this State was\r\nthe ground for some of the most heated anti-slavery discussions, not\r\nonly in the Legislature, but in frequent conventions. Garrison and his\r\nfollowers, year after year, had overrun the \"Western Reserve,\"\r\ncovering the north-eastern part of the State, carrying the gospel of\r\nfreedom to every hamlet.\r\n\r\nA radical paper, called _The Anti-Slavery Bugle_, edited by Oliver\r\nJohnson, was published in Salem. It took strong ground in favor of\r\nequal rights for woman, and the editor did all in his power to sustain\r\nthe conventions, and encourage the new movement.\r\n\r\nAgain, Abby Kelly's eloquent voice had been heard all through this\r\nState, denouncing \"the black laws of Ohio,\" appealing to the ready\r\nsympathies of woman for the suffering of the black mothers, wives, and\r\ndaughters of the South. This grand woman, equally familiar with the\r\ntricks of priests and politicians, the action of Synods, General\r\nAssemblies, State Legislatures, and Congresses, who could maintain an\r\nargument with any man on the slavery question, had immense influence,\r\nnot only in the anti-slavery conflict, but by her words and example\r\nshe inspired woman with new self-respect.\r\n\r\nThese anti-slavery conventions, in which the most logical reasoners,\r\nand the most eloquent, impassioned orators the world ever produced,\r\nkept their audiences wrought up to the highest pitch of enthusiasm\r\nhour after hour, were the school in which woman's rights found its\r\nready-made disciples. With such women as Frances D. Gage, Hannah Tracy\r\nCutler, Josephine S. Griffing, J. Elizabeth Jones, Mariana Johnson,\r\nEmily Robinson, Maria Giddings, Betsey Cowles, Caroline M. Severance,\r\nMartha J. Tilden, Rebecca A. S. Janney, to listen to the exhaustive\r\narguments on human rights, verily the seed fell on good ground, and\r\nthe same justice, that in glowing periods was claimed for the black\r\nman, they now claimed for themselves, and compelled the law-makers of\r\nthis State to give some consideration to the wrongs of woman.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1850, Ohio held a Constitutional Convention, and these\r\nwomen, thoroughly awake to their rights, naturally thought, that if\r\nthe fundamental laws of the State were to be revised and amended, it\r\nwas a fitting time for them to ask to be recognized.\r\n\r\nIn 1851, Harriet Beecher Stowe commenced the publication of \"Uncle\r\nTom's Cabin\" in the _National Era_, in Washington, D. C., which made\r\nOhio, with its great river, classic soil, and quickened the pulsations\r\nof every woman's heart in the nation.\r\n\r\nReports of the New York Conventions, widely copied and ridiculed in\r\nleading journals, from Maine to Texas, struck the key-note for similar\r\ngatherings in several of the Northern States. Without the least\r\nknowledge of one another, without the least concert of action, women\r\nin Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, sprang up as if by\r\nmagic, and issued calls for similar conventions. The striking\r\nuniformity in their appeals, petitions, resolutions, and speeches;\r\nmaking the same complaints and asking the same redress for grievances,\r\nshows that all were moved by like influences. Those who made the\r\ndemand for political freedom in 1848, in Europe as well as America,\r\nwere about the same age. Significant facts to show that new liberty\r\nfor woman was one of the marked ideas of the century, and that as the\r\nchief factor in civilization, the time had come for her to take her\r\nappropriate place.\r\n\r\nThe actors in this new movement were not, as the London and New York\r\njournals said, \"sour old maids,\" but happy wives and faithful mothers,\r\nwho, in a higher development, demanded the rights and privileges\r\nbefitting the new position. And if they may be judged by the vigor and\r\neloquence of their addresses, and the knowledge of parliamentary\r\ntactics they manifested in their conventions, the world must accord\r\nthem rare common-sense, good judgment, great dignity of character, and\r\na clear comprehension of the principles of government. In order to\r\nshow how well those who inaugurated this movement, understood the\r\nnature of our republican institutions, and how justly they estimated\r\ntheir true position in a republic, we shall give rather more of these\r\nearly speeches and letters than in any succeeding chapters.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, Mrs. Elizabeth Wilson, of Cadiz, Ohio, aroused some attention\r\nto the general question, by the publication of \"A Scriptural View of\r\nWoman's Rights and Duties,\" clearly demonstrating the equality of man\r\nand woman in the creation, as well as the independent, self-reliant\r\ncharacteristics sanctioned in woman, by the examples of the sex given\r\nin the Bible. As woman has ever been degraded by the perversion of the\r\nreligious element of her nature, the scriptural arguments were among\r\nthe earliest presentations of the question. When opponents were\r\nlogically cornered on every other side, they uniformly fell back on\r\nthe decrees of Heaven. The ignorance of women in general as to what\r\ntheir Bibles really do teach, has been the chief cause of their\r\nbondage. They have accepted the opinions of men for the commands of\r\ntheir Creator. The fulminations of the clergy against the\r\nenfranchisement of woman, were as bitter and arrogant as against the\r\nemancipation of the African, and they defended their position in both\r\ncases by the Bible. This led Abolitionists and women to a very careful\r\nstudy of the Scriptures, and enabled them to meet their opponents most\r\nsuccessfully. No clergyman ever quoted Scripture with more readiness\r\nand force than did Lucretia Mott and William Lloyd Garrison, who alike\r\nmade the Bible a power on the side of freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALEM CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 the first convention in Ohio was held at Salem, April 19th and\r\n20th, in the Second Baptist Church.[14] The meeting convened at 10\r\no'clock, and was called to order by Emily Robinson, who proposed\r\nMariana W. Johnson as President _pro tem._, Sarah Coates, Secretary\r\n_pro tem._ On taking the chair, Mrs. Johnson read the following call:\r\n\r\n     We, the undersigned, earnestly call on the women of Ohio to meet\r\n     in Convention, on Friday, the 19th of April, 1850, at 10 o'clock\r\n     A.M., in the town of Salem, to concert measures to secure to all\r\n     persons the recognition of equal rights, and the extension of the\r\n     privileges of government without distinction of sex, or color; to\r\n     inquire into the origin and design of the rights of humanity,\r\n     whether they are coeval with the human race, of universal\r\n     inheritage and inalienable, or merely conventional, held by\r\n     sufferance, dependent for a basis on location, position, color,\r\n     and sex, and like government scrip, or deeds of parchment,\r\n     transferable, to be granted or withheld, made immutable or\r\n     changeable, as caprice, popular favor, or the pride of power and\r\n     place may dictate, changing ever, as the weak and the strong, the\r\n     oppressed and the oppressor, come in conflict or change places.\r\n     Feeling that the subjects proposed for discussion are vitally\r\n     important to the interests of humanity, we unite in most\r\n     earnestly inviting every one who sincerely desires the progress\r\n     of true reform to be present at the Convention.\r\n\r\n     The meeting of a convention of men to amend the Constitution of\r\n     our (?) State, presents a most favorable opportunity for the\r\n     agitation of this subject. Women of Ohio! we call upon you to\r\n     come up to this work in womanly strength and with womanly energy.\r\n     Don't be discouraged at the prospect of difficulties. Remember\r\n     that contest with difficulty gives strength. Come and inquire if\r\n     the position you now occupy is one appointed by wisdom, and\r\n     designed to secure the best interests of the human race. Come,\r\n     and let us ascertain what bearing the circumscribed sphere of\r\n     woman has on the great political and social evils that curse and\r\n     desolate the land. Come, for this cause claims your most\r\n     invincible perseverance; come in single-heartedness, and with a\r\n     personal self-devotion that will yield everything to Right,\r\n     Truth, and Reason, but not an iota to dogmas or theoretical\r\n     opinions, no matter how time-honored, or by what precedent\r\n     established.\r\n\r\n     Randolph--Elizabeth Steadman, Cynthia M. Price, Sophronia\r\n     Smalley, Cordelia L. Smalley, Ann Eliza Lee, Rebecca Everit. New\r\n     Garden--Esther Ann Lukens. Ravenna--Lucinda King, Mary Skinner,\r\n     Frances Luccock.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Convention were: Betsey M. Cowles, President;\r\nLydia B. Irish, Harriet P. Weaver, and Rana Dota, Vice-Presidents.\r\nCaroline Stanton, Ann Eliza Lee, and Sallie B. Gove, Secretaries.\r\nEmily Robinson, J. Elizabeth Jones, Josephine S. Griffing, Mariana\r\nJohnson, Esther Lukens, Mary H. Stanton, Business Committee.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jones read a very able speech, which was printed in full in their\r\npublished report, also a discourse of Lucretia Mott's, \"On Woman,\"\r\ndelivered Dec. 17, 1849, in the Assembly Building in Philadelphia.\r\nInteresting letters were read from Mrs. Mott, Lucy Stone, Sarah Pugh,\r\nLydia Jane Pierson, editor of the Lancaster _Literary Gazette_,\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton, and Harriet N. Torrey.[15] Twenty-two\r\nresolutions, covering the whole range of woman's political, religious,\r\ncivil, and social rights, were discussed and adopted. The following\r\nmemorial to the Constitutional Convention, was presented by Mariana\r\nJohnson:\r\n\r\n                                 MEMORIAL.\r\n\r\n     We believe the whole theory of the Common Law in relation to\r\n     woman is unjust and degrading, tending to reduce her to a level\r\n     with the slave, depriving her of political existence, and forming\r\n     a positive exception to the great doctrine of equality as set\r\n     forth in the Declaration of Independence. In the language of\r\n     Prof. Walker, in his \"Introduction to American Law\": \"Women have\r\n     no part or lot in the foundation or administration of the\r\n     government. They can not vote or hold office. They are required\r\n     to contribute their share, by way of taxes, to the support of the\r\n     Government, but are allowed no voice in its direction. They are\r\n     amenable to the laws, but are allowed no share in making them.\r\n     This language, when applied to males, would be the exact\r\n     definition of political slavery.\" Is it just or wise that woman,\r\n     in the largest and professedly the freest and most enlightened\r\n     republic on the globe, in the middle of the nineteenth century,\r\n     should be thus degraded?\r\n\r\n     We would especially direct the attention of the Convention to the\r\n     legal condition of married women. Not being represented in those\r\n     bodies from which emanate the laws, to which they are obliged to\r\n     submit, they are protected neither in person nor property. \"The\r\n     merging of woman's name in that of her husband is emblematical of\r\n     the fate of all her legal rights.\" At the marriage-altar, the law\r\n     divests her of all distinct individuality. Blackstone says: \"The\r\n     very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during\r\n     marriage, or at least incorporated or consolidated into that of\r\n     her husband.\" Legally, she ceases to exist, and becomes\r\n     emphatically a new creature, and is ever after denied the dignity\r\n     of a rational and accountable being. The husband is allowed to\r\n     take possession of her estates, as the law has proclaimed her\r\n     legally dead. All that she has, becomes legally his, and he can\r\n     collect and dispose of the profits of her labor without her\r\n     consent, as he thinks fit, and she can own nothing, have nothing,\r\n     which is not regarded by the law as belonging to her husband.\r\n     Over her person he has a more limited power. Still, if he render\r\n     life intolerable, so that she is forced to leave him, he has the\r\n     power to retain her children, and \"seize her and bring her back,\r\n     for he has a right to her society which he may enforce, either\r\n     against herself or any other person who detains her\" (Walker,\r\n     page 226). Woman by being thus subject to the control, and\r\n     dependent on the will of man, loses her self-dependence; and no\r\n     human being can be deprived of this without a sense of\r\n     degradation. The law should sustain and protect all who come\r\n     under its sway, and not create a state of dependence and\r\n     depression in any human being. The laws should not make woman a\r\n     mere pensioner on the bounty of her husband, thus enslaving her\r\n     will and degrading her to a condition of absolute dependence.\r\n\r\n     Believing that woman does not suffer alone when subject to\r\n     oppressive and unequal laws, but that whatever affects\r\n     injuriously her interests, is subversive of the highest good of\r\n     the race, we earnestly request that in the New Constitution you\r\n     are about to form for the State of Ohio, women shall be secured,\r\n     not only the right of suffrage, but all the political and legal\r\n     rights that are guaranteed to men.\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion the memorial was adopted. With the hope of\r\ncreating a feeling of moral responsibility on this vital question, an\r\nearnest address[16] to the women of the State was also presented,\r\ndiscussed, and adopted.\r\n\r\n                      ADDRESS TO THE WOMEN OF OHIO.\r\n\r\n     How shall the people be made wiser, better, and happier, is one\r\n     of the grand inquiries of the present age. The various benevolent\r\n     associations hold up to our view special forms of evil, and\r\n     appeal to all the better feelings of our nature for sympathy, and\r\n     claim our active efforts and co-operation to eradicate them.\r\n     Governments, at times, manifest an interest in human suffering;\r\n     but their cold sympathy and tardy efforts seldom avail the\r\n     sufferer until it is too late. Philanthropists, philosophers, and\r\n     statesmen study and devise ways and means to ameliorate the\r\n     condition of the people. Why have they so little practical\r\n     effect? It is because the means employed are not adequate to the\r\n     end sought for. To ameliorate the effects of evil seems to have\r\n     been the climax of philanthropic effort. We respectfully suggest\r\n     that lopping the branches of the tree but causes the roots to\r\n     strike deeper and cling more closely to the soil that sustains\r\n     it. Let the amelioration process go on, until evil is\r\n     exterminated root and branch; and for this end the people must be\r\n     instructed in the Rights of Humanity;--not in the rights of men\r\n     and the rights of women; the rights of the master and those of\r\n     the slave;--but in the perfect equality of the Rights of Man. The\r\n     rights of man! Whence came they? What are they? What is their\r\n     design? How do we know them? They are of God! Those that most\r\n     intimately affect us as human beings are life, liberty, and the\r\n     pursuit of happiness. Their design is happiness. The human\r\n     organization is the charter deed by which we hold them. Hence we\r\n     learn that rights are coeval with the human race, of universal\r\n     heritage, and inalienable; that every human being, no matter of\r\n     what color, sex, condition, or clime, possesses those rights upon\r\n     perfect equality with all others. The monarch on the throne, and\r\n     the beggar at his feet, have the same. Man has no more, woman no\r\n     less.\r\n\r\n     Rights may not be usurped on one hand, nor surrendered on the\r\n     other, because they involve a responsibility that can be\r\n     discharged only by those to whom they belong, those for whom they\r\n     were created; and because, without those certain inalienable\r\n     rights, human beings can not attain the end for which God the\r\n     Father gave them existence. Where and how can the wisdom and\r\n     ingenuity of the world find a truer, stronger, broader basis of\r\n     human rights. To secure these rights, says the Declaration of\r\n     Independence, \"Governments were instituted among men, deriving\r\n     their just powers from the consent of the governed;\" and\r\n     \"whenever any form of government becomes destructive of those\r\n     ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and\r\n     to substitute a new government, laying its foundation on such\r\n     principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them\r\n     shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.\"\r\n     The Government of this country, in common with all others, has\r\n     never recognized or attempted to protect women as persons\r\n     possessing the rights of humanity. They have been recognized and\r\n     protected as appendages to men, without independent rights or\r\n     political existence, unknown to the law except as victims of its\r\n     caprice and tyranny. This government, having therefore exercised\r\n     powers underived from the consent of the governed, and having\r\n     signally failed to secure the end for which all just government\r\n     is instituted, should be immediately altered, or abolished.\r\n\r\n     We can not better describe the political condition of woman, than\r\n     by quoting from a distinguished lawyer of our own State.\r\n     Professor Walker, in his \"Introduction to American Law,\" says\r\n\r\n                              OF HUSBAND AND WIFE,\r\n\r\n          \"We have a few statutory provisions on the subject, but for\r\n          the most part the law of husband and wife is _Common Law_,\r\n          and you will find that it savors of its origin in all its\r\n          leading features. The whole theory is a slavish one,\r\n          compared even with the civil law. I do not hesitate to say,\r\n          by way of arousing your attention to the subject, that the\r\n          law of husband and wife, as you gather it from the books, is\r\n          a disgrace to any civilized nation. I do not mean to say\r\n          that females are degraded in point of fact. I only say, that\r\n          the theory of the law degrades them almost to the level of\r\n          slaves.\" We thank Prof. Walker for his candor. He might have\r\n          added that the practice of the law does degrade woman to the\r\n          level of the slave. He also says: \"With regard to political\r\n          rights, females form a positive exception to the general\r\n          doctrine of equality. They have no part nor lot in the\r\n          formation or administration of government. They can not vote\r\n          or hold office. We require them to contribute their share in\r\n          the way of taxes for the support of government, but allow\r\n          them no voice in its direction. We hold them amenable to the\r\n          laws when made, but allow them no share in making them. This\r\n          language applied to males, would be the exact definition of\r\n          political slavery; applied to females, custom does not teach\r\n          us so to regard it.\"\r\n\r\n     Of married women he says: \"The legal theory is, marriage makes\r\n     the husband and wife one person, and that person is the husband.\r\n     He the substantive, she the adjective. In a word, there is\r\n     scarcely a legal act of any description that she is competent to\r\n     perform. If she leaves him without cause, (legal) he may seize\r\n     and bring her back, for he has a right to her society, which he\r\n     may enforce, either against herself, or any other person. All her\r\n     personality in regard to property becomes the husband's by\r\n     marriage, unless the property has been specially secured to her.\r\n     If the property be not in his possession, he may take measures to\r\n     reduce it to possession. He can thus dispose of it in spite of\r\n     her. If debts were due to her, he may collect them. If he was\r\n     himself the debtor, the marriage cancels the debt. If she has\r\n     earned money during marriage, he may collect it. In regard to\r\n     realty (real estate) he controls the income, and without her\r\n     consent he can not encumber, or dispose of the property beyond\r\n     his own life.\" Women, married or single, have no political rights\r\n     whatever. While single, their legal rights are the same as those\r\n     of men; when married, their legal rights are chiefly suspended.\r\n     \"The condition of the wife may be inferred from what has already\r\n     been said. She is almost at the mercy of her husband; she can\r\n     exercise no control over his property or her own. As a general\r\n     rule, she can make no contracts binding herself or him. Her\r\n     contracts are not merely voidable, but absolutely void. Nor can\r\n     she make herself liable for his contracts, torts, or crimes. Her\r\n     only separate liability is for her own crimes. Her only joint\r\n     liability, is for her own torts committed without his\r\n     participation, and for contracts for which the law authorizes her\r\n     to unite with him. She has no power over his person, and her only\r\n     claim upon his property is for a bare support. In no instance can\r\n     she sue or be sued alone in a civil action; and there are but few\r\n     cases in which she can be joined in a suit with him. In Ohio, but\r\n     hardly anywhere else, is she allowed to make a will, if haply she\r\n     has anything to dispose of.\"\r\n\r\n     Women of Ohio! Whose cheek does not blush, whose blood does not\r\n     tingle at this cool, lawyer-like recital of the gross indignities\r\n     and wrongs which Government has heaped upon our sex? With these\r\n     marks of inferiority branded upon our persons, and interwoven\r\n     with the most sacred relations of human existence, how can we\r\n     rise to the true dignity of human nature, and discharge\r\n     faithfully the important duties assigned us as responsible,\r\n     intelligent, self-controlling members of society? No wonder that\r\n     so many of our politicians are dough-faced serviles, without\r\n     independence or manhood; no wonder our priests are time-serving\r\n     and sycophantic: no wonder that so many men are moral cowards and\r\n     cringing poltroons. What more could be expected of a progeny of\r\n     slaves? Slaves are we, politically and legally. How can we, who,\r\n     it is said, are the educators of our children, present to this\r\n     nation anything else but a generation of serviles, while we,\r\n     ourselves, are in a servile condition, and padlocks are on our\r\n     lips? No! if men would be men worthy of the name, they must cease\r\n     to disfranchise and rob their wives and mothers; they must\r\n     forbear to consign to political and legal slavery their sisters\r\n     and their daughters. And, would we be women worthy the\r\n     companionship of true and noble men, we must cease longer to\r\n     submit to tyranny. Let us rise in the might of self-respect, and\r\n     assert our rights, and by the aid of truth, the instincts of\r\n     humanity, and a just application of the principles of equality,\r\n     we shall be able to maintain them.\r\n\r\n     You ask, would you have woman, by engaging in political party\r\n     bickerings and noisy strife, sacrifice her integrity and purity?\r\n     No, neither would we have men do it.... We hold that whatever is\r\n     essentially wrong for woman to do, can not be right for man. If\r\n     deception and intrigue, the elements of political craft, be\r\n     degrading to woman, can they be ennobling to man? If patience and\r\n     forbearance adorn a woman, are they not equally essential to a\r\n     manly character? If anger and turbulence disgrace woman, what can\r\n     they add to the dignity of man? Nothing; because nothing can be\r\n     morally right for man, that is morally wrong for woman. Woman, by\r\n     becoming the executioner of man's vengeance on his fellow-man,\r\n     could inflict no greater wrong on society than the same done by\r\n     man; but it would create an intenser feeling of shuddering\r\n     horror, and would, we conceive, rouse to more healthful activity\r\n     man's torpid feelings of justice, mercy, and clemency. And so,\r\n     also, if woman had free scope for the full exercise of the\r\n     heavenly graces that men so gallantly award her, truth, love, and\r\n     mercy would be invested with a more sacred charm. But while they\r\n     continue to enforce obedience to arbitrary commands, to encourage\r\n     love of admiration and a desire for frivolous amusements; while\r\n     they crush the powers of the mind, by opposing authority and\r\n     precedent to reason and progress; while they arrogate to\r\n     themselves the right to point us to the path of duty, while they\r\n     close the avenues of knowledge through public institutions, and\r\n     monopolize the profits of labor, mediocrity and inferiority must\r\n     be our portion. Shall we accept it, or shall we strive against\r\n     it?\r\n\r\n     Men are not destitute of justice or humanity; and let it be\r\n     remembered that there are hosts of noble and truthful ones among\r\n     them who deprecate the tyranny that enslaves us; and none among\r\n     ourselves can be more ready than they to remove the mountain of\r\n     injustice which the savagism of ages has heaped upon our sex. If,\r\n     therefore, we remain enslaved and degraded, the cause may justly\r\n     be traced to our own apathy and timidity. We have at our disposal\r\n     the means of moral agitation and influence, that can arouse our\r\n     country to a saving sense of the wickedness and folly of\r\n     disfranchising half the people. Let us no longer delay to use\r\n     them.\r\n\r\n     Let it be remembered too, that tyrannical and illiberal as our\r\n     Government is, low as it places us in the scale of existence,\r\n     degrading as is its denial of our capacity for self-government,\r\n     still it concedes to us more than any other Government on earth.\r\n     Woman, over half the globe, is now and always has been but a\r\n     chattel. Wives are bargained for, bought and sold, as other\r\n     merchandise, and as a consequence of the annihilation of natural\r\n     rights, they have no political existence. In Hindustan, the\r\n     evidence of woman is not received in a court of justice. The\r\n     Hindu wife, when her husband dies, must yield implicit obedience\r\n     to the oldest son. In Burmah, they are not allowed to ascend the\r\n     steps of a court of justice, but are obliged to give their\r\n     testimony outside of the building. In Siberia, women are not\r\n     allowed to step across the footprints of men or reindeer. The\r\n     Mohammedan law forbids pigs, dogs, women, and other impure\r\n     animals to enter the Mosque. The Moors, for the slightest\r\n     offense, beat their wives most cruelly. The Tartars believe that\r\n     women were sent into the world for no other purpose than to be\r\n     useful, convenient slaves. To these heathen precedents our\r\n     Christian brethren sometimes refer to prove the inferiority of\r\n     woman, and to excuse the inconsistency of the only Government on\r\n     earth that has proclaimed the equality of man. An argument worthy\r\n     its source.\r\n\r\n     In answer to the popular query, \"Why should woman desire to\r\n     meddle with public affairs?\" we suggest the following questions:\r\n\r\n     1st. Is the principle of taxation without representation less\r\n     oppressive and tyrannical, than when our fathers expended their\r\n     blood and treasure, rather than submit to its injustice?\r\n\r\n     2d. Is it just, politic, and wise, that universities and colleges\r\n     endowed by Government should be open only to men?\r\n\r\n     3d. Is it easier for Government to reform lazy, vicious,\r\n     ignorant, and hardened felons, than for enlightened\r\n     humanity--loving parents, to \"train up a child in the way it\r\n     should go\"?\r\n\r\n     4th. How can a mother, who does not understand, and therefore can\r\n     not appreciate the rights of humanity, train up her child in the\r\n     way it should go?\r\n\r\n     5th. Whence originates the necessity of a penal code?\r\n\r\n     6th. It is computed that over ten millions of dollars are\r\n     annually expended in the United States for the suppression of\r\n     crime. How much of this waste of treasure is traceable to\r\n     defective family government?\r\n\r\n     7th. Can antiquity make wrong right?\r\n\r\n     In conclusion, we appeal to our sisters of Ohio to arise from the\r\n     lethargy of ages; to assert their rights as independent human\r\n     beings; to demand their true position as equally responsible\r\n     co-workers with their brethren in this world of action. We urge\r\n     you by your self-respect, by every consideration for the human\r\n     race, to arise and take possession of your birthright to freedom\r\n     and equality. Take it not as the gracious boon tendered by the\r\n     chivalry of superiors, but as your _right_, on every principle of\r\n     justice and equality.\r\n\r\n     The present is a most favorable time for the women of Ohio to\r\n     demand a recognition of their rights. The organic law of the\r\n     State is about to undergo a revision. Let it not be our fault if\r\n     the rights of humanity, and not alone those of \"free white male\r\n     citizens,\" are recognized and protected. Let us agitate the\r\n     subject in the family circle, in public assemblies, and through\r\n     the press. Let us flood the Constitutional Convention with\r\n     memorials and addresses, trusting to truth and a righteous cause\r\n     for the success of our efforts.\r\n\r\nThis Convention had one peculiar characteristic. It was officered\r\nentirely by women; not a man was allowed to sit on the platform, to\r\nspeak, or vote. _Never did men so suffer._ They implored just to say a\r\nword; but no; the President was inflexible--no man should be heard. If\r\none meekly arose to make a suggestion he was at once ruled out of\r\norder. For the first time in the world's history, men learned how it\r\nfelt to sit in silence when questions in which they were interested\r\nwere under discussion. It would have been an admirable way of closing\r\nthe Convention, had a rich banquet been provided, to which the men\r\nshould have had the privilege of purchasing tickets to the gallery,\r\nthere to enjoy the savory odors, and listen to the after-dinner\r\nspeeches. However, the gentlemen in the Convention passed through this\r\nsevere trial with calm resignation; at the close, organized an\r\nassociation of their own, and generously endorsed all the ladies had\r\nsaid and done.\r\n\r\nThough the women in this Convention were unaccustomed to public\r\nspeaking and parliamentary tactics, the interest was well sustained\r\nfor two days, and the deliberations were conducted with dignity and\r\norder. It was here Josephine S. Griffing uttered her first brave\r\nwords for woman's emancipation, though her voice had long been heard\r\nin pathetic pleading for the black man's rights. This Convention,\r\nwhich was called and conducted by Mrs. Emily Robinson, with such aid\r\nas she could enlist, was largely attended and entirely successful.\r\n\r\nA favorable and lengthy report found its way into the _New York\r\nTribune_ and other leading journals, both East and West, and the\r\nproceedings of the Convention were circulated widely in pamphlet form.\r\nAll this made a very strong impression upon the public mind. From the\r\nold world, too, the officers of the Convention received warm\r\ncongratulations and earnest words of sympathy, for the new gospel of\r\nwoman's equality was spreading in England as well as America.\r\n\r\n\r\nAKRON CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nThe advocates for the enfranchisement of woman had tripled in that one\r\nshort year. The very complimentary comments of the press, and the\r\nattention awakened throughout the State, by the presentation of \"the\r\nmemorial\" to the Constitutional Convention, had accomplished a great\r\neducational work. Soon after this, another convention was called in\r\nAkron. The published proceedings of the first convention, were like\r\nclarion notes to the women of Ohio, rousing them to action, and when\r\nthe call to the second was issued, there was a generous response. In\r\n1851, May 28th and 29th, many able men and women rallied at the stone\r\nchurch, and hastened to give their support to the new demand, and most\r\neloquently did they plead for justice to woman.\r\n\r\nFrances D. Gage, Hannah Tracy Cutler, Jane G. Swisshelm, Caroline M.\r\nSeverance, Emma R. Coe, Maria L. Giddings, Celia C. Burr (afterward\r\nBurleigh), Martha J. Tilden, and many other noble women who were\r\naccustomed to speaking in temperance and anti-slavery meetings, helped\r\nto make this Convention most successful. Frances D. Gage was chosen\r\nPresident of the Convention. On taking the chair she said:\r\n\r\n     I am at a loss, kind friends, to know whether to return you\r\n     thanks, or not, for the honor conferred upon me. And when I tell\r\n     you that I have never in my life attended a regular business\r\n     meeting, and am entirely inexperienced in the forms and\r\n     ceremonies of a deliberative body, you will not be surprised that\r\n     I do not feel remarkably grateful for the position. For though\r\n     you have conferred an honor upon me, I very much fear I shall not\r\n     be able to reflect it back. I will try.\r\n\r\n     When our forefathers left the old and beaten paths of New\r\n     England, and struck out for themselves in a new and unexplored\r\n     country, they went forth with a slow and cautious step, but with\r\n     firm and resolute hearts. The land of their fathers had become\r\n     too small for their children. Its soil answered not their wants.\r\n     The parents shook their heads and said, with doubtful and\r\n     foreboding faces: \"Stand still, stay at home. This has sufficed\r\n     for us; we have lived and enjoyed ourselves here. True, our\r\n     mountains are high and our soil is rugged and cold; but you won't\r\n     find a better; change, and trial, and toil, will meet you at\r\n     every step. Stay, tarry with us, and go not forth to the\r\n     wilderness.\"\r\n\r\n     But the children answered: \"Let us go; this land has sufficed for\r\n     you, but the one beyond the mountains is better. We know there is\r\n     trial, toil, and danger; but for the sake of our children, and\r\n     our children's children, we are willing to meet all.\" They went\r\n     forth, and pitched their tents in the wilderness. An herculean\r\n     task was before them; the rich and fertile soil was shadowed by a\r\n     mighty forest, and giant trees were to be felled. The Indians\r\n     roamed the wild, wide hunting-grounds, and claimed them as their\r\n     own. They must be met and subdued. The savage beasts howled\r\n     defiance from every hill-top, and in every glen. They must be\r\n     destroyed. Did the hearts of our fathers fail? No; they entered\r\n     upon their new life, their new world, with a strong faith and a\r\n     mighty will. For they saw in the prospection a great and\r\n     incalculable good. It was not the work of an hour, nor of a day;\r\n     not of weeks or months, but of long struggling, toiling, painful\r\n     years. If they failed at one point, they took hold at another. If\r\n     their paths through the wilderness were at first crooked, rough,\r\n     and dangerous, by little and little they improved them. The\r\n     forest faded away, the savage disappeared, the wild beasts were\r\n     destroyed, and the hopes and prophetic visions of their\r\n     far-seeing powers in the new and untried country, were more than\r\n     realized.\r\n\r\n     Permit me to draw a comparison between the situation of our\r\n     forefathers in the wilderness, without even so much as a\r\n     bridle-path through its dark depths, and our present position.\r\n     The old land of moral, social, and political privilege, seems too\r\n     narrow for our wants; its soil answers not to our growing, and we\r\n     feel that we see clearly a better country that we might inhabit.\r\n     But there are mountains of established law and custom to\r\n     overcome; a wilderness of prejudice to be subdued; a powerful foe\r\n     of selfishness and self-interest to overthrow; wild beasts of\r\n     pride, envy, malice, and hate to destroy. But for the sake of our\r\n     children and our children's children, we have entered upon the\r\n     work, hoping and praying that we may be guided by wisdom,\r\n     sustained by love, and led and cheered by the earnest hope of\r\n     doing good.\r\n\r\n     I shall enter into no labored argument to prove that woman does\r\n     not occupy the position in society to which her capacity justly\r\n     entitles her. The rights of mankind emanate from their natural\r\n     wants and emotions. Are not the natural wants and emotions of\r\n     humanity common to, and shared equally by, both sexes? Does man\r\n     hunger and thirst, suffer cold and heat more than woman? Does he\r\n     love and hate, hope and fear, joy and sorrow more than woman?\r\n     Does his heart thrill with a deeper pleasure in doing good? Can\r\n     his soul writhe in more bitter agony under the consciousness of\r\n     evil or wrong? Is the sunshine more glorious, the air more quiet,\r\n     the sounds of harmony more soothing, the perfume of flowers more\r\n     exquisite, or forms of beauty more soul-satisfying to his senses,\r\n     than to hers? To all these interrogatories every one will answer,\r\n     No!\r\n\r\n     Where then did man get the authority that he now claims over\r\n     one-half of humanity? From what power the vested right to place\r\n     woman--his partner, his companion, his helpmeet in life--in an\r\n     inferior position? Came it from nature? Nature made woman his\r\n     superior when she made her his mother; his equal when she fitted\r\n     her to hold the sacred position of wife. Does he draw his\r\n     authority from God, from the language of holy writ? No! For it\r\n     says that \"Male and female created he _them_, and gave _them_\r\n     dominion.\" Does he claim it under law of the land? Did woman meet\r\n     with him in council and voluntarily give up all her claim to be\r\n     her own law-maker? Or did the majesty of might place this power\r\n     in his hands?--The power of the strong over the weak makes man\r\n     the master! Yes, there, and there only, does he gain his\r\n     authority.\r\n\r\n     In the dark ages of the past, when ignorance, superstition, and\r\n     bigotry held rule in the world, might made the law. But the\r\n     undertone, the still small voice of Justice, Love, and Mercy,\r\n     have ever been heard, pleading the cause of humanity, pleading\r\n     for truth and right; and their low, soft tones of harmony have\r\n     softened the lion heart of might, and little by little, he has\r\n     yielded as the centuries rolled on; and man, as well as woman,\r\n     has been the gainer by every concession. We will ask him to yield\r\n     still; to allow the voice of woman to be heard; to let her take\r\n     the position which her wants and emotions seem to require; to let\r\n     her enjoy her natural rights. Do not answer that woman's position\r\n     is now all her natural wants and emotions require. Our meeting\r\n     here together this day proves the contrary; proves that we have\r\n     aspirations that are not met. Will it be answered that we are\r\n     factious, discontented spirits, striving to disturb the public\r\n     order, and tear up the old fastnesses of society? So it was said\r\n     of Jesus Christ and His followers, when they taught peace on\r\n     earth and good-will to men. So it was said of our forefathers in\r\n     the great struggle for freedom. So it has been said of every\r\n     reformer that has ever started out the car of progress on a new\r\n     and untried track.\r\n\r\n     We fear, not man as an enemy. He is our friend, our brother. Let\r\n     woman speak for herself, and she will be heard. Let her claim\r\n     with a calm and determined, yet loving spirit, her place, and it\r\n     will be given her. I pour out no harsh invectives against the\r\n     present order of things--against our fathers, husbands, and\r\n     brothers; they do as they have been taught; they feel as society\r\n     bids them; they act as the law requires. Woman must act for\r\n     herself.\r\n\r\n     Oh, if all women could be impressed with the importance of their\r\n     own action, and with one united voice, speak out in their own\r\n     behalf, in behalf of humanity, they could create a revolution\r\n     without armies, without bloodshed, that would do more to\r\n     ameliorate the condition of mankind, to purify, elevate, ennoble\r\n     humanity, than all that has been done by reformers in the last\r\n     century.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that Mrs. Gage had led the usual arduous domestic\r\nlife, of wife, mother, and housekeeper, in a new country, overburdened\r\nwith the care and anxiety incident to a large family reading and\r\ngathering general information at short intervals, taken from the hours\r\nof rest and excessive toil, it is remarkable, that she should have\r\npresided over the Convention, in the easy manner she is said to have\r\ndone, and should have given so graceful and appropriate an\r\nextemporaneous speech, on taking the chair. Maria L. Giddings,\r\ndaughter of Joshua R. Giddings, who represented Ohio many years in\r\nCongress, presented a very able digest on the common law. Betsey M.\r\nCowles gave a report equally good on \"Labor,\" and Emily Robinson on\r\n\"Education.\"\r\n\r\nIn all the early Conventions the resolutions were interminable. It was\r\nnot thought that full justice was done to the subject, if every point\r\nof interest or dissatisfaction in this prolific theme was not\r\ncondensed into a resolution. Accordingly the Akron Convention\r\npresented, discussed, and adopted fifteen resolutions. At Salem, the\r\nprevious year, the number reached twenty-two.\r\n\r\nLetters were read from Amelia Bloomer, Elizabeth Wilson, Lydia F.\r\nFowler, Susan Ormsby, Elsie M. Young, Gerrit Smith, Henry C. Wright,\r\nPaulina Wright Davis, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Clarina Howard Nichols,\r\nand others. The Hutchinson family enlivened this Convention with such\r\ninspiring songs as \"The Good Time Coming.\" Ever at the post of duty,\r\nthey have sung each reform in turn to partial success. Jesse expressed\r\nhis sympathy in the cause in a few earnest remarks.\r\n\r\nThis Convention was remarkable for the large number of men who took an\r\nactive part in the proceedings. And as we have now an opportunity to\r\nexpress our gratitude by handing their names down to posterity, and\r\nthus make them immortal, we here record Joseph Barker, Marius\r\nRobinson, Rev. D. L. Webster, Jacob Heaton, Dr. K. G. Thomas, L. A.\r\nHine, Dr. A. Brooke, Rev. Mr. Howels, Rev. Geo. Schlosser, Mr. Pease,\r\nand Samuel Brooke. The reports of this Convention are so meagre that\r\nwe can not tell who were in the opposition; but from Sojourner Truth's\r\nspeech, we fear that the clergy, as usual, were averse to enlarging\r\nthe boundaries of freedom.\r\n\r\nIn those early days the sons of Adam crowded our platform, and often\r\nmade it the scene of varied pugilistic efforts, but of late years we\r\ninvite those whose presence we desire. Finding it equally difficult to\r\nsecure the services of those we deem worthy to advocate our cause, and\r\nto repress those whose best service would be silence, we ofttimes find\r\nourselves quite deserted by the \"stronger sex\" when most needed.\r\n\r\nSojourner Truth, Mrs. Stowe's \"Lybian Sibyl,\" was present at this\r\nConvention. Some of our younger readers may not know that Sojourner\r\nTruth was once a slave in the State of New York, and carries to-day as\r\nmany marks of the diabolism of slavery, as ever scarred the back of a\r\nvictim in Mississippi. Though she can neither read nor write, she is a\r\nwoman of rare intelligence and common-sense on all subjects. She is\r\nstill living, at Battle Creek, Michigan, though now 110 years old.\r\nAlthough the exalted character and personal appearance of this noble\r\nwoman have been often portrayed, and her brave deeds and words many\r\ntimes rehearsed, yet we give the following graphic picture of\r\nSojourner's appearance in one of the most stormy sessions of the\r\nConvention, from\r\n\r\n                     REMINISCENCES BY FRANCES D. GAGE.\r\n\r\n                            SOJOURNER TRUTH.\r\n\r\n     The leaders of the movement trembled on seeing a tall, gaunt\r\n     black woman in a gray dress and white turban, surmounted with an\r\n     uncouth sun-bonnet, march deliberately into the church, walk with\r\n     the air of a queen up the aisle, and take her seat upon the\r\n     pulpit steps. A buzz of disapprobation was heard all over the\r\n     house, and there fell on the listening ear, \"An abolition\r\n     affair!\" \"Woman's rights and niggers!\" \"I told you so!\" \"Go it,\r\n     darkey!\"\r\n\r\n     I chanced on that occasion to wear my first laurels in public\r\n     life as president of the meeting. At my request order was\r\n     restored, and the business of the Convention went on. Morning,\r\n     afternoon, and evening exercises came and went. Through all these\r\n     sessions old Sojourner, quiet and reticent as the \"Lybian\r\n     Statue,\" sat crouched against the wall on the corner of the\r\n     pulpit stairs, her sun-bonnet shading her eyes, her elbows on her\r\n     knees, her chin resting upon her broad, hard palms. At\r\n     intermission she was busy selling the \"Life of Sojourner Truth,\"\r\n     a narrative of her own strange and adventurous life. Again and\r\n     again, timorous and trembling ones came to me and said, with\r\n     earnestness, \"Don't let her speak, Mrs. Gage, it will ruin us.\r\n     Every newspaper in the land will have our cause mixed up with\r\n     abolition and niggers, and we shall be utterly denounced.\" My\r\n     only answer was, \"We shall see when the time comes.\"\r\n\r\n     The second day the work waxed warm. Methodist, Baptist,\r\n     Episcopal, Presbyterian, and Universalist ministers came in to\r\n     hear and discuss the resolutions presented. One claimed superior\r\n     rights and privileges for man, on the ground of \"superior\r\n     intellect\"; another, because of the \"manhood of Christ; if God\r\n     had desired the equality of woman, He would have given some token\r\n     of His will through the birth, life, and death of the Saviour.\"\r\n     Another gave us a theological view of the \"sin of our first\r\n     mother.\"\r\n\r\n     There were very few women in those days who dared to \"speak in\r\n     meeting\"; and the august teachers of the people were seemingly\r\n     getting the better of us, while the boys in the galleries, and\r\n     the sneerers among the pews, were hugely enjoying the\r\n     discomfiture, as they supposed, of the \"strong-minded.\" Some of\r\n     the tender-skinned friends were on the point of losing dignity,\r\n     and the atmosphere betokened a storm. When, slowly from her seat\r\n     in the corner rose Sojourner Truth, who, till now, had scarcely\r\n     lifted her head. \"Don't let her speak!\" gasped half a dozen in my\r\n     ear. She moved slowly and solemnly to the front, laid her old\r\n     bonnet at her feet, and turned her great speaking eyes to me.\r\n     There was a hissing sound of disapprobation above and below. I\r\n     rose and announced \"Sojourner Truth,\" and begged the audience to\r\n     keep silence for a few moments.\r\n\r\n     The tumult subsided at once, and every eye was fixed on this\r\n     almost Amazon form, which stood nearly six feet high, head erect,\r\n     and eyes piercing the upper air like one in a dream. At her first\r\n     word there was a profound hush. She spoke in deep tones, which,\r\n     though not loud, reached every ear in the house, and away through\r\n     the throng at the doors and windows.\r\n\r\n     \"Wall, chilern, whar dar is so much racket dar must be somethin'\r\n     out o' kilter. I tink dat 'twixt de niggers of de Souf and de\r\n     womin at de Norf, all talkin' 'bout rights, de white men will be\r\n     in a fix pretty soon. But what's all dis here talkin' 'bout?\r\n\r\n     \"Dat man ober dar say dat womin needs to be helped into\r\n     carriages, and lifted ober ditches, and to hab de best place\r\n     everywhar. Nobody eber helps me into carriages, or ober\r\n     mud-puddles, or gibs me any best place!\" And raising herself to\r\n     her full height, and her voice to a pitch like rolling thunder,\r\n     she asked. \"And a'n't I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm! (and\r\n     she bared her right arm to the shoulder, showing her tremendous\r\n     muscular power). I have ploughed, and planted, and gathered into\r\n     barns, and no man could head me! And a'n't I a woman? I could\r\n     work as much and eat as much as a man--when I could get it--and\r\n     bear de lash as well! And a'n't, I a woman? I have borne thirteen\r\n     chilern, and seen 'em mos' all sold off to slavery, and when I\r\n     cried out with my mother's grief, none but Jesus heard me! And\r\n     a'n't I a woman?\r\n\r\n     \"Den dey talks 'bout dis ting in de head; what dis dey call it?\"\r\n     (\"Intellect,\" whispered some one near.) \"Dat's it, honey. What's\r\n     dat got to do wid womin's rights or nigger's rights? If my cup\r\n     won't hold but a pint, and yourn holds a quart, wouldn't ye be\r\n     mean not to let me have my little half-measure full?\" And she\r\n     pointed her significant finger, and sent a keen glance at the\r\n     minister who had made the argument. The cheering was long and\r\n     loud.\r\n\r\n     \"Den dat little man in black dar, he say women can't have as much\r\n     rights as men, 'cause Christ wan't a woman! Whar did your Christ\r\n     come from?\" Rolling thunder couldn't have stilled that crowd, as\r\n     did those deep, wonderful tones, as she stood there with\r\n     outstretched arms and eyes of fire. Raising her voice still\r\n     louder, she repeated, \"Whar did your Christ come from? From God\r\n     and a woman! Man had nothin' to do wid Him.\" Oh, what a rebuke\r\n     that was to that little man.\r\n\r\n     Turning again to another objector, she took up the defense of\r\n     Mother Eve. I can not follow her through it all. It was pointed,\r\n     and witty, and solemn; eliciting at almost every sentence\r\n     deafening applause; and she ended by asserting: \"If de fust woman\r\n     God ever made was strong enough to turn de world upside down all\r\n     alone, dese women togedder (and she glanced her eye over the\r\n     platform) ought to be able to turn it back, and get it right side\r\n     up again! And now dey is asking to do it, de men better let 'em.\"\r\n     Long-continued cheering greeted this. \"'Bleeged to ye for hearin'\r\n     on me, and now ole Sojourner han't got nothin' more to say.\"\r\n\r\n     Amid roars of applause, she returned to her corner, leaving more\r\n     than one of us with streaming eyes, and hearts beating with\r\n     gratitude. She had taken us up in her strong arms and carried us\r\n     safely over the slough of difficulty turning the whole tide in\r\n     our favor. I have never in my life seen anything like the magical\r\n     influence that subdued the mobbish spirit of the day, and turned\r\n     the sneers and jeers of an excited crowd into notes of respect\r\n     and admiration. Hundreds rushed up to shake hands with her, and\r\n     congratulate the glorious old mother, and bid her God-speed on\r\n     her mission of \"testifyin' agin concerning the wickedness of this\r\n     'ere people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n            WOMAN'S RIGHTS MEETING IN A BARN--\"JOHN'S CONVENTION.\"\r\n\r\n     MRS. M. E. J. GAGE:\r\n\r\n     DEAR MADAM:--Your postal and note requesting items of history of\r\n     the almost forgotten doings of thirty years ago, is at hand.\r\n\r\n     In 1850 Ohio decided by the votes of her male population to\r\n     \"alter and amend her Constitution.\" The elected delegates\r\n     assembled in Cincinnati in the spring of that year.\r\n\r\n     In view of affecting this legislation the \"Woman's Rights\r\n     Convention\" at Salem, Columbiana Co., was called in April, 1850,\r\n     and memorialized the Delegate Convention, praying that Equal\r\n     Rights to all citizens of the State be guaranteed by the new\r\n     Constitution. In May a county meeting was called in\r\n     McConnelsville, Morgan Co., Ohio. Mrs. H. M. Little, Mrs. M. T.\r\n     Corner, Mrs. H. Brewster, and myself, were all the women that I\r\n     knew in that region, even favorable to a movement for the help of\r\n     women. Two of these only asked for more just laws for married\r\n     women. One hesitated about the right of suffrage. I alone in the\r\n     beginning asked for the ballot,[17] and equality before the law\r\n     for all adult citizens of sound minds, without regard to sex or\r\n     color. The Freemasons gave their hall for our meeting, but no men\r\n     were admitted. I drew up a memorial for signatures, praying that\r\n     the words \"white\" and \"male\" be omitted in the new Constitution.\r\n     I also drew up a paper copying the unequal laws on our statute\r\n     books with regard to women. We met, Mrs. Harriet Brewster\r\n     presiding. Some seventy ladies of our place fell in through the\r\n     day. I read my paper, and Mrs. M. T. Corner gave a historical\r\n     account of noted women of the past. It was a new thing. At the\r\n     close, forty names were placed on the memorial For years I had\r\n     been talking and writing, and people were used to my \"craziness.\"\r\n     But who expected Mrs. Corner and others to take such a stand! Of\r\n     course, we were heartily abused.\r\n\r\n     This led to the calling of a county meeting at Chesterfield,\r\n     Morgan County. It was advertised to be held in the M. E. Church.\r\n     There were only present some eight ladies, including the four\r\n     above mentioned We four \"scoffers\" hired a hack and rode sixteen\r\n     miles over the hill, before 10 A.M., to be denied admittance to\r\n     church or school-house Rev. Philo Matthews had found us shelter\r\n     on the threshing-floor of a fine barn, and we found about three\r\n     or four hundred of the farmers, and their wives, sons, and\r\n     daughters, assembled. They were nearly all \"Quakers\" and\r\n     Abolitionists, but then not much inclined to \"woman's rights.\" I\r\n     had enlarged my argument, and there the \"ox-sled\" speech was\r\n     made, the last part of May, 1850, date of day not remembered.\r\n\r\n     A genuine \"Quaker Preacher\" said to me at the close, \"Frances,\r\n     thee had great Freedom. The ox-cart inspired thee.\" The farmers'\r\n     wives brought huge boxes and pans of provisions. Men and women\r\n     made speeches, and many names were added to our memorial. On the\r\n     whole, we had a delightful day. It was no uncommon thing in those\r\n     days for Abolitionist, or Methodist, or other meetings, to be\r\n     held under the trees, or in large barns, when school-houses would\r\n     not hold the people. But to shut up doors against women was a new\r\n     thing.\r\n\r\n     In December of 1851 I was invited to attend a Woman's Rights\r\n     Convention at the town of Mount Gilead, Morrow Co., Ohio. A\r\n     newspaper call promised that celebrities would be on hand, etc. I\r\n     wrote I would be there. It was two days' journey, by steamboat\r\n     and rail. The call was signed \"John Andrews,\" and John Andrews\r\n     promised to meet me at the cars. I went. It was fearfully cold,\r\n     and John met me. He was a beardless boy of nineteen, looking much\r\n     younger. We drove at once to the \"Christian Church.\" On the way\r\n     he cheered me by saying \"he was afraid nobody would come, for all\r\n     the people said nobody would come for his asking.\" When we got to\r\n     the house, there was not one human soul on hand, no fire in the\r\n     old rusty stove, and the rude, unpainted board benches, all\r\n     topsy-turvy. I called some boys playing near, asked their names,\r\n     put them on paper, five of them, and said to them, \"Go to every\r\n     house in this town and tell everybody that 'Aunt Fanny' will\r\n     speak here at 11 A.M., and if you get me fifty to come and hear,\r\n     I will give you each ten cents.\" They scattered off upon the run.\r\n     I ordered John to right the benches, picked up chips and\r\n     kindlings, borrowed a brand of fire at the next door, had a good\r\n     hot stove, and the floor swept, and was ready for my audience at\r\n     the appointed time. John had done his work well, and fifty at\r\n     least were on hand, and a minister to make a prayer and quote St.\r\n     Paul before I said a word. I said my say, and before 1 P.M., we\r\n     adjourned, appointing another session at 3, and one for 7 P.M.,\r\n     and three for the following day. Mrs. C. M. Severance came at 6\r\n     P.M., and we had a good meeting throughout.\r\n\r\n     John's Convention was voted a success after all. He died young,\r\n     worn out by his own enthusiasm and conflicts.\r\n\r\n                                             FRANCES D. GAGE.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1851, a Woman's Temperance Convention was held in\r\nCincinnati, Ohio, in Foster Hall, corner of Fifth and Walnut Streets.\r\nMrs. Mary B. Slough, President; Mrs. George Parcells, Vice-President:\r\nMrs. William Pinkham, Secretary. Resolutions were discussed, and a\r\nDeclaration of Independence adopted. Mrs. Slough was the \"Grand\r\nPresiding Sister of Ohio.\" This meeting was held to raise funds for a\r\nbanner, they had promised the firemen, Co. No. 1, if they would vote\r\nthe Temperance ticket.\r\n\r\nOf the temperance excitement in the State, Mrs. Gage says:\r\n\r\n     In the winter of 1852-53, there was great excitement on the\r\n     Temperance question in this country, originating in Maine and\r\n     spreading West. Some prominent women in Ohio, who were at\r\n     Columbus, the State capital, with their husbands--who were there\r\n     from all parts of the State, as Senators, Representatives,\r\n     jurists, and lobbyists--feeling a great interest, as many of them\r\n     had need to, in the question, were moved to call a public meeting\r\n     on the subject. This resulted in the formation of a \"Woman's\r\n     State Temperance Society,\" which sent out papers giving their\r\n     by-laws and resolutions, and calling for auxiliary societies in\r\n     different parts of the State. This call in many places met with\r\n     hearty responses.\r\n\r\n     In the following autumn, 1853, officers of the State Society,\r\n     Mrs. Professor Coles, of Oberlin, President, called a convention\r\n     of their members and friends of the cause, at the city of Dayton,\r\n     Ohio.\r\n\r\n     The famous \"Whole World's Convention\" had just been held in New\r\n     York City, followed by the \"World's Convention,\" at which the\r\n     Rev. Antoinette L. Brown was expelled from the platform, simply\r\n     because she was a woman. The Hon. Samuel Carey presented a\r\n     resolution, which I quote from memory, something as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That we recognize women as efficient aids and\r\n     helpers in the home, but not on the platform.\"\r\n\r\n     This was not perhaps the exact wording, but it was the purport of\r\n     the resolution, and was presented while Neal Dow, the President\r\n     of the Convention, was absent from the chair, and after much\r\n     angry and abusive discussion, it was passed by that body of great\r\n     men.\r\n\r\n     The Committee of Arrangements, appointed at Dayton, could find no\r\n     church, school-house, or hall in which to hold their convention,\r\n     till the Sons of Temperance consented to yield their lodge-room,\r\n     provided there were no men admitted to their meetings. Alas! the\r\n     Committee consented. I traveled two hundred miles, and, on\r\n     reaching Dayton at a late hour, I repaired at once to the hall.\r\n     Our meeting was organized. But hardly were we ready to proceed\r\n     when an interruption occurred. I had been advertised for the\r\n     first speech, and took my place on the platform, when a column of\r\n     well-dressed ladies, very fashionable and precise, marched in,\r\n     two and two, and spread themselves in a half circle in front of\r\n     the platform, and requested leave to be heard.\r\n\r\n     Our President asked me to suspend my reading, to which I\r\n     assented, and she--a beautiful, graceful lady--bowed them her\r\n     assent. Forthwith they proceeded to inform us, that they were\r\n     delegated by a meeting of Dayton ladies to come hither and read\r\n     to us a remonstrance against \"the unseemly and unchristian\r\n     position\" we had assumed in calling conventions, and taking our\r\n     places upon the platform, and seeking notoriety by making\r\n     ourselves conspicuous before men. They proceeded to shake the\r\n     dust from their own skirts of the whole thing. They discussed\r\n     wisely the disgraceful conduct of Antoinette L. Brown at the\r\n     World's Temperance Convention, as reported to them by Hon. Samuel\r\n     Carey, with more of the same sort, which I beg to be excused from\r\n     trying to recall to mind, or to repeat. When their mission was\r\n     ended, in due form they filed out of the low dark door, descended\r\n     the stair-way, and disappeared from our sight.\r\n\r\n     When we had recovered our equilibrium after such a knock-down\r\n     surprise, Mrs. Bateman requested me to proceed. I rose, and\r\n     asked leave to change my written speech for one not from my pen,\r\n     but from my heart.\r\n\r\n     The protest of the Dayton \"Mrs. Grundys\" had been well larded\r\n     with Scripture, so I added: \"Out of the abundance of the heart\r\n     the mouth speaketh,\" and never before, possibly never since, have\r\n     I had greater liberty in relieving my mind, as the Quakers would\r\n     say. I had been at New York and had boarded with Antoinette L.\r\n     Brown, so I knew whereof I was bearing testimony, when I assured\r\n     my hearers that Samuel Carey had certainly been lying--under a\r\n     mistake. I gave my testimony, not cringingly, but as one who\r\n     knew, and drew a comparison between Antoinette L. Brown, modestly\r\n     but firmly standing her ground as a delegate from her society,\r\n     with politicians and clergymen crying, \"Shame on the woman,\" and\r\n     stamping and clamoring till the dust on the carpet of the\r\n     platform enveloped them in a cloud. Meanwhile, her best friends,\r\n     William H. Channing, William Lloyd Garrison, Oliver Johnson,\r\n     Wendell Phillips and others stood by her, bidding her stand firm.\r\n     The conduct of these ladies in marching through the streets of\r\n     Dayton, in the most crowded thoroughfares, in the midst of a\r\n     State fair, to tell some other women that they were making\r\n     themselves \"conspicuous.\" What I said, or how it was said,\r\n     mattereth not.\r\n\r\n     That evening, the Sons of Temperance Hall, which our committee\r\n     had promised to \"keep clear of men,\" was well filled with women.\r\n     But all around the walls, and between the benches, on the\r\n     platform--and in the aisles, there were men from every part of\r\n     the State. These ladies had given us a grand advertisement.\r\n\r\nThe following is the report of said meeting clipped from the _Evening\r\nPost_ twenty-seven years ago, by Mrs. Gage:\r\n\r\n                       THE OHIO WOMEN'S CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n                                        DAYTON, _Sept. 24, 1853_.\r\n\r\n     To-day the Ohio State Women's Temperance Society held a meeting\r\n     at this place. The attendance was not large, but was respectable,\r\n     both in number and talents. Mrs. Bateman, of Columbus, presided,\r\n     and a good officer she made. Parliamentary rules prevailed in\r\n     governing the assembly, and were enforced with much promptness\r\n     and dignity. She understood enough of these to put both sides of\r\n     the question--an attainment which, I have noticed, many Mr.\r\n     Presidents have often not reached.\r\n\r\n     The enactment of the Maine law in Ohio is the principal object at\r\n     which they appeared to aim. Its constitutionality and effect were\r\n     both discussed, decisions of courts criticised, and all with much\r\n     acuteness and particularly happy illustrations. In reference to\r\n     the practicability of enforcing it, when once passed, one woman\r\n     declared, that \"if the men could not do it, the women would give\r\n     them effectual aid.\"\r\n\r\n     In the course of the meeting, two original poems were read, one\r\n     by Mrs. Gage, formerly of this State, and now of St. Louis, and\r\n     one by Mrs. Hodge, of Oberlin. There were also delivered three\r\n     formal addresses, one by Mrs. Dryer, of Delaware County, Ohio,\r\n     one by Mrs. Griffing, of Salem, Ohio, and the other by Mrs. Gage,\r\n     either of which would not have dishonored any of our public\r\n     orators if we consider the matter, style, or manner of delivery.\r\n     Men can deal in statistics and logical deductions, but women only\r\n     can describe the horrors of intemperance--can draw aside the\r\n     curtain and show us the wreck it makes of domestic love and home\r\n     enjoyment--can paint the anguish of the drunkard's wife and the\r\n     miseries of his children. Wisdom would seem to dictate that those\r\n     who feel the most severely the effects of any evil, should best\r\n     know how to remove it. If this be so, it would be difficult to\r\n     give a reason why women should not act, indeed lead off in this\r\n     great temperance movement.\r\n\r\n     A most exciting and interesting debate arose on some resolutions\r\n     introduced by the Secretary, Mrs. Griffing, condemnatory of the\r\n     action of the World's Temperance Convention in undelegating Miss\r\n     Brown, and excluding her from the platform.\r\n\r\n     These resolutions are so pithy, that I can not refrain from\r\n     furnishing them in full. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That we regard the tyrannical and cowardly\r\n     conformation to the 'usages of society,' in thrusting woman from\r\n     the platform in the late so-called, but mis-called World's\r\n     Temperance Convention, as a most daring and insulting outrage\r\n     upon all of womankind; and it is with the deepest shame and\r\n     mortification that we learn that our own State of Ohio furnished\r\n     the delegate to officiate in writing and presenting the\r\n     resolutions, and presiding at the session when the desperate act\r\n     was accomplished.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That our thanks are due to the Hon. Neal Dow, of\r\n     Maine, the President of the Convention, for so manfully and\r\n     persistently deciding and insisting upon and in favor of the\r\n     right of all the friends of temperance, duly delegated, 10 seats\r\n     and participation in all the proceedings.\"\r\n\r\n     The friends of General Carey rallied, and with real parliamentary\r\n     tact moved to lay the resolutions on the table. There was much\r\n     excitement and some nervousness. The remarks made _pro_ and _con_\r\n     were pithy and to the point. The motion to lay on the table was\r\n     lost by a large majority. Mrs. Griffing supported her resolutions\r\n     with much coolness and conscious strength. The General had few\r\n     defenders, and most of those soon abandoned him to his fate, and\r\n     fell back upon the position of deprecating the introduction of\r\n     what they called the question of Woman's Rights into the\r\n     Convention. All, however, was of no avail; the resolutions passed\r\n     by a large majority, and amid much applause.\r\n\r\n     After recess an attempt was made to reconsider this vote. The\r\n     President urged some one who voted in the affirmative to move a\r\n     reconsideration, that a substitute might be offered, condemning\r\n     the action of the World's Convention in reference to Miss Brown,\r\n     \"as uncourteous, unchristian, and unparliamentary.\" The motion\r\n     was made evidently from mere courtesy; but, when put to vote, was\r\n     lost by a very large majority. The delegates from Oberlin, and\r\n     some others, joined in the following protest:\r\n\r\n     \"We beg leave to request that it be recorded in the minutes of\r\n     the meeting, that the delegation from Oberlin, and some others,\r\n     although we regard as uncourteous, unchristian, and\r\n     unparliamentary, the far-famed proceedings at New York, yet we\r\n     can not endorse the language of censure as administered by our\r\n     most loved and valued sisters.\"\r\n\r\n     Thus fell General Carey, probably mortally wounded. His vitality,\r\n     indeed, must be very great, if he can outlive the thrusts given\r\n     him on this occasion. What rendered his conduct in New York more\r\n     aggravating is the fact that heretofore, he has encouraged the\r\n     women of Ohio in their advocacy of temperance, and promised to\r\n     defend them.\r\n\r\n     It is not, however, for Ohio men to interfere in this matter.\r\n     Ohio women have shown themselves abundantly able to take care of\r\n     themselves and the General too.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS FROM FRIENDS IN OHIO.\r\n\r\nMrs. R. A. S. Janney, in reply to our request for a chapter of her\r\nrecollections, said:\r\n\r\n     The agitation of \"Woman's Rights\" began in Ohio in 1843 and '44,\r\n     after Abby Kelly lectured through the State on Anti-slavery.\r\n\r\n     The status of the public mind at that time is best illustrated by\r\n     the fact that Catharine Beecher, in 1846, gave an address in\r\n     Columbus on education, by sitting on the platform and getting her\r\n     brother Edward to read it for her.\r\n\r\n     In 1849, Lucy Stone and Antoinette L. Brown, then students at\r\n     Oberlin College, lectured at different places in the State on\r\n     \"Woman's Rights.\"\r\n\r\n     In 1850 a Convention was held at Salem; Mariana Johnson presented\r\n     a memorial, which was numerously signed and sent to the\r\n     Constitutional Convention. The same week Mrs. F. D. Gage called a\r\n     meeting in Masonic Hall, McConnellsville, and drew up a memorial,\r\n     which was also largely signed, and presented to the\r\n     Constitutional Convention. Memorials were sent from other parts\r\n     of the State, and other county conventions held.\r\n\r\n     The signatures to the petition for \"Equal Rights,\" numbered\r\n     7,901, and for the Right of Suffrage, 2,106.\r\n\r\n     The discussions in the Constitutional Convention were voted to be\r\n     dropped from the records, because they were so low and obscene.\r\n     Dr. Townsend, of Lorain, and William Hawkins, of McConnellsville,\r\n     were our friends in the Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MRS. CORNER'S LETTER.\r\n\r\n                                   CLEVELAND, O., _Nov. 14, 1876_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR MRS. BLOOMER:--Your postal recalls to mind an event which\r\n     occurred before the women of Ohio had in any sense broken the\r\n     cords which bound them. A wife was not then entitled to her own\r\n     earnings, and if a husband were a drunkard, or a gambler, no\r\n     portion of his wages could she take, without his consent, for the\r\n     maintenance of herself and family.\r\n\r\n     Some small gain has been attained in the letter of the law, and\r\n     much in public opinion. Less stigma rests upon one who chooses an\r\n     avocation suited to her own taste and ability. We have struggled\r\n     for little; but it is well for us to remember that the world was\r\n     not made in a day.\r\n\r\n     The meeting to which you allude was held in Chesterfield, Morgan\r\n     County, Ohio. I went in company with Mrs. Gage, and remember well\r\n     what a spirited meeting it was. When it was found that the church\r\n     could not be had, the ladies of the place secured a barn, made it\r\n     nice and clean, had a platform built at one end of the large\r\n     floor for the speakers and invited guests, and seats arranged in\r\n     every available place.\r\n\r\n     The audience was large and respectful, as well as respectable.\r\n     The leading subjects were: The injustice of the laws, as to\r\n     property and children, in their results to married women; the\r\n     ability of woman to occupy positions of trust now withheld from\r\n     her; her limited means for acquiring an education; etc.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Gage spoke with great enthusiasm and warmth. I think it must\r\n     have been almost her first effort, to be followed by years of\r\n     persistent work by voice and pen, to secure a wider field of\r\n     labor for her sex, and to spur dull woman to do for herself; to\r\n     make use of the means within her grasp; to become fit to bear the\r\n     higher responsibilities which the coming years might impose.\r\n\r\n     Her dear voice is almost silent now, still she lingers as if to\r\n     catch some faint glimpse of hoped-for results, ere she drops this\r\n     mortal coil.\r\n\r\n                                   Very truly yours,\r\n                                                  MARY T. CORNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASSILON CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nOn May 27, 1852, another State Convention was held in Massilon. We\r\ngive the following brief notice from the _New York Tribune_:\r\n\r\n     The third Woman's Rights Convention of Ohio has just closed its\r\n     session. It was held in the Baptist church, in this place, and\r\n     was numerously attended, there being a fair representation of\r\n     men, as well as women; for though the object of these, and\r\n     similar meetings, is to secure woman her rights, as an equal\r\n     member of the human family, neither speaking nor membership was\r\n     here confined to the one sex, but _all_ who had sentiments to\r\n     utter in reference to the object of the Convention--whether for\r\n     or against it--were invited to speak with freedom, and those who\r\n     wished to aid the movement to sit as members, without distinction\r\n     of sex. All honorable classes were represented, from the\r\n     so-called highest to the so-called lowest--the seamstress who\r\n     works for twenty-five cents a day; the daughters of the farmer,\r\n     fresh from the dairy and the kitchen; the wives of the laborer,\r\n     the physician, the lawyer, and the banker, the legislator, and\r\n     the minister, were all there--all interested in one common cause,\r\n     and desirous that every right God gave to woman should be fully\r\n     recognized by the laws and usages of society, that every faculty\r\n     he has bestowed upon her should have ample room for its proper\r\n     development. Is this asking too much? And yet this is the sum and\r\n     substance of the Woman's Rights Reform--a movement which fools\r\n     ridicule, and find easier to sneer at than meet with argument.\r\n\r\nBefore they separated they organized \"The Ohio Woman's Rights\r\nAssociation,\" and chose Hannah Tracy Cutler for President.\r\n\r\nThe first annual meeting of this Association was held at Ravenna, May\r\n25th and 26th, 1853. In the absence of the President, Mrs. Caroline M.\r\nSeverance presided. The speakers were Rev. Antoinette L. Brown, Mrs.\r\nLawrence, Emma R. Coe, Josephine S. Griffing, Martha J. Tilden, and\r\nmany others. Emily Robinson presented an able and encouraging report\r\non the progress of the work. Mrs. Severance was appointed to prepare a\r\nmemorial to the Legislature, which was presented March 23, 1854, laid\r\non the table and ordered to be printed. This document is found in the\r\nJune number of _The Una_, 1854, and is a very carefully written paper\r\non the legal status of woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEVELAND NATIONAL CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nIn 1853, October 6th, 7th, and 8th, the Fourth National Convention was\r\nheld in Cleveland. There were delegates present from New York,\r\nPennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, and\r\nMissouri. The _Plain Dealer_ said all the ladies prominent in this\r\nmovement were present, some in full Bloomer costume. At the appointed\r\ntime Lucretia Mott arose and said:\r\n\r\n     As President of the last National Convention at Syracuse, it\r\n     devolves on me to call this meeting to order. It was decided in a\r\n     preliminary gathering last evening, that Frances D. Gage, of St.\r\n     Louis, was the suitable person to fill the office of President on\r\n     this occasion.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Gage, being duly elected, on taking the chair, said: Before\r\n     proceeding farther, it is proper that prayer should be offered.\r\n     The Rev. Antoinette L. Brown will address the throne of grace.\r\n\r\nShe came forward and made a brief, but eloquent prayer. It was\r\nconsidered rather presumptuous in those days for a woman to pray in\r\npublic, but as Miss Brown was a graduate of Oberlin College, had gone\r\nthrough the theological department, was a regularly ordained preacher,\r\nand installed as a pastor, she felt quite at home in all the forms and\r\nceremonies of the Church.\r\n\r\n     The Cleveland _Journal_, in speaking of her, said: She has one\r\n     distinction, she is the handsomest woman in the Convention. Her\r\n     voice is silvery, and her manner pleasing. It is generally known\r\n     that she is the pastor of a Congregational church in South\r\n     Butler, N. Y.\r\n\r\n     In her opening remarks, Mrs. Gage said: It is with fear and\r\n     trembling that I take up the duties of presiding over your\r\n     deliberations: not fear and trembling for the cause, but lest I\r\n     should not have the capacity and strength to do all the position\r\n     requires of me. She then gave a review of what had been\r\n     accomplished since the first Convention was held in Seneca Falls,\r\n     N. Y., July 19, 1848, and closed by saying: I hope our\r\n     discussions will be a little more extensive than the call would\r\n     seem to warrant, which indicates simply our right to the\r\n     political franchise.\r\n\r\n     To which, Mrs. Mott replied: I would state that the limitation of\r\n     the discussions was not anticipated at the last Convention. The\r\n     issuing of the call was left to the Central Committee, but it was\r\n     not supposed that they would specify any particular part of the\r\n     labor of the Convention, but that the broad ground of the\r\n     presentation of the wrongs of woman, the assertion of her rights,\r\n     and the encouragement to perseverance in individual and combined\r\n     action, and the restoration of those rights, should be taken.\r\n\r\n     After which, Mrs. Gage added: I would remark once for all, to the\r\n     Convention, that there is perfect liberty given here to speak\r\n     upon the subject under discussion, both for and against; and that\r\n     we urge all to do so. If there are any who have objections, we\r\n     wish to hear them. If arguments are presented which convince us\r\n     that we are doing wrong, we wish to act upon them. I extremely\r\n     regret that while we have held convention after convention, where\r\n     the same liberty has been given, no one has had a word to say\r\n     against us at the time, but that some have reserved their hard\r\n     words of opposition to our movement, only to go away and vent\r\n     them through the newspapers, amounting, frequently, to gross\r\n     misrepresentation. I hope every one here will remember, with deep\r\n     seriousness, that the same Almighty finger which traced upon the\r\n     tablets of stone the commands, \"Thou shalt not kill,\" \"Thou shalt\r\n     not steal,\" traced also these words, \"Thou shalt not bear false\r\n     witness against thy neighbor.\"\r\n\r\nThe other officers of the Convention were then elected, as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Vice-Presidents_--Antoinette L. Brown, New York; Lucretia Mott,\r\n     Pennsylvania; Caroline M. Severance, Ohio; Joseph Barker, Ohio;\r\n     Emily Robinson, Ohio; Mary B. Birdsall, Indiana; Sibyl Lawrence,\r\n     Michigan; Charles P. Wood, New York; Amy Post, New York.\r\n\r\n     _Secretaries_--Martha C. Wright, New York; Caroline Stanton,\r\n     Ohio; H. B.

Heaton, Ohio.\r\n\r\nLetters were read from distinguished people. Notably the following\r\nfrom Horace Greeley:\r\n\r\n                                       NEW YORK, _Oct. 2, 1853_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR MADAM:--I have received yours of the 26th, this moment. I do\r\n     not see that my presence in Cleveland could be of any service.\r\n     The question to be considered concerns principally woman, and\r\n     women should mostly consider it. I recognize most thoroughly the\r\n     right of woman to choose her own sphere of activity and\r\n     usefulness, and to evoke its proper limitations. If she sees fit\r\n     to navigate vessels, print newspapers, frame laws, select\r\n     rulers--any or all of these--I know no principle that justifies\r\n     man in interposing any impediment to her doing so. The only\r\n     argument entitled to any weight against the fullest concession of\r\n     the rights you demand, rests in the assumption that woman does\r\n     not claim any such rights, but chooses to be ruled, guided,\r\n     impelled, and have her sphere prescribed for her by man.\r\n\r\n     I think the present state of our laws respecting property and\r\n     inheritance, as respects married women, show very clearly that\r\n     woman ought not to be satisfied with her present position; yet it\r\n     may be that she is so. If all those who have never given this\r\n     matter a serious thought are to be considered on the side of\r\n     conservatism, of course that side must preponderate. Be this as\r\n     it may, woman alone can, in the present state of the controversy,\r\n     speak effectively for woman, since none others can speak with\r\n     authority, or from the depths of a personal experience.\r\n\r\n     Hoping that your Convention may result in the opening of many\r\n     eyes, and the elevation of many minds from light to graver\r\n     themes,\r\n\r\n                              I remain yours,\r\n                                        HORACE GREELEY.\r\n     MRS. C. M. SEVERANCE,\r\n                  Cleveland, Ohio.\r\n\r\nAnd here let us pay our tribute of gratitude to Horace Greeley. In\r\nthose early days when he, as editor of the _New York Tribune_, was one\r\nof the most popular men in the nation, his word almost law to the\r\npeople, his journal was ever true to woman. No ridicule of our cause,\r\nno sneers at its advocates, found a place in _The Tribune_; but more\r\nthan once, he gave columns to the proceedings of our conventions.\r\n\r\nTo this letter, Henry B. Blackwell, brother of Dr. Elizabeth\r\nBlackwell, and the future husband of Lucy Stone, pertinently replied,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n     It is suggested that woman's cause should be advocated by women\r\n     only. The writer of that letter is a true friend of this reform,\r\n     and yet I feel that I owe you no apology for standing on this\r\n     platform. But if I do, this is sufficient, that I am the son of a\r\n     woman, and the brother of a woman. I know that this is their\r\n     cause, but I feel that it is mine also. Their happiness is my\r\n     happiness, their misery my misery.\r\n\r\n     The interests of the sexes are inseparably connected, and in the\r\n     elevation of one lies the salvation of the other. Therefore I\r\n     claim a part in the last and grandest movement of the ages; for\r\n     whatever concerns woman concerns the race. In every human\r\n     enterprise the sexes should go hand in hand. Experience sanctions\r\n     the statement. I know of but few movements in history, which have\r\n     gone on successfully without the aid of woman. One of these is\r\n     war--the work of human slaughter. Another has been the digging of\r\n     gold in California. I have yet to learn what advantages the world\r\n     has derived from either. Whenever the sexes have been severed in\r\n     politics, in business, in religion, the result has been\r\n     demoralization.\r\n\r\nMr. Blackwell spoke with great eloquence for nearly an hour,\r\nadvocating the political, civil, and moral equality of woman. He\r\nshowed the power of the ballot in combating unjust laws, opening\r\ncollege doors, securing equal pay for equal work, dignifying the\r\nmarriage relation, by making woman an equal partner, not a subject. He\r\npaid a glowing eulogy to Mary Wollstonecroft. He said:\r\n\r\n     We need higher ideas of marriage. There is scarcely a young man\r\n     here who does not hope to be a husband and a father; nor a young\r\n     woman who does not expect to be a wife and a mother. But who\r\n     does not revolt at the idea of perpetuating a race inferior to\r\n     ourselves? For myself I could not desire a degenerate family. I\r\n     would not wish for a race which would not be head and shoulders\r\n     above what I had been. Let me say to men, select women worthy to\r\n     be wives. The world is overstocked with these mis-begotten\r\n     children of undeveloped mothers. No man who has ever seen the\r\n     symmetrical character of a true woman, can be happy in a union\r\n     with such. Ladies! the day is coming when men who have seen more\r\n     well-developed women, will scorn the present standard of female\r\n     character. Will you not teach them to do so? You may have to\r\n     sacrifice much, but you will be repaid. This history of the world\r\n     is rich with glorious examples. Mary Wollstonecroft, the writer\r\n     of that brave book, \"The Rights of Woman,\" published two\r\n     generations ago, dared to be true to her convictions of duty in\r\n     spite of the prejudices of the world. What was the result? She\r\n     attained a noble character. She found in Godwin a nature worthy\r\n     of her own, and left a child who became the wife and worthy\r\n     biographer of the great poet Shelley. Let us imitate that child\r\n     of glorious parents--parents who dared to make all their\r\n     relations compatible with absolute right, to give all their\r\n     powers the highest development.\r\n\r\n     People say a married woman can not have ulterior objects; that\r\n     her position is incompatible with a high intellectual culture;\r\n     that her thoughts and sympathies must be restricted to the four\r\n     walls of her dwelling. Why, if I were a woman (I speak only as a\r\n     man) and believed this popular doctrine, that she who is a wife\r\n     and a mother, being that, must be nothing more, but must cramp\r\n     her thoughts into the narrow circle of her own home, and indulge\r\n     no grander aspirations for universal interests--believing that, I\r\n     would forswear marriage. I would withdraw myself from human\r\n     society, and go out into the forest and the prairie to live out\r\n     my own true life in the communion and sympathy of my God. So far\r\n     as I was concerned, the race might become worthily extinct--it\r\n     should never be unworthily perpetuated. I could do no otherwise.\r\n     For we are not made merely to eat and drink, and give children to\r\n     the world. We are placed here upon the threshold of an immortal\r\n     life. We are but the chrysalis of the future. If immortality\r\n     means anything, it means unceasing progress for individuals and\r\n     for the race.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Blackwell complimented those women who were just inaugurating\r\n     a movement for a new costume, promising greater freedom and\r\n     health. He thought the sneers and ridicule so unsparingly\r\n     showered on the \"Bloomers,\" might with more common sense be\r\n     turned on the \"tight waists, paper shoes, and trailing skirts of\r\n     the fashionable classes.\"\r\n\r\nThe facts of history may as well be stated here in regard to the\r\n\"Bloomer\" costume. Mrs. Bloomer was among the first to wear the dress,\r\nand stoutly advocated its adoption in her paper, _The Lily_, published\r\nat Seneca Falls, N. Y. But it was introduced by Elizabeth Smith\r\nMiller, the daughter of the great philanthropist, Gerrit Smith, in\r\n1850. She wore it for many years, even in the most fashionable circles\r\nof Washington during her father's term in Congress. Lucy Stone, Miss\r\nAnthony, and Mrs. Stanton, also wore it a few years. But it invoked so\r\nmuch ridicule, that they feared the odium attached to the dress might\r\ninjure the suffrage movement, of which they were prominent\r\nrepresentatives. Hence a stronger love for woman's political freedom,\r\nthan for their own personal comfort, compelled them to lay it aside.\r\nThe experiment, however, was not without its good results. The dress\r\nwas adopted for skating and gymnastic exercises, in seminaries and\r\nsanitariums. At Dr. James C. Jackson's, in Dansville, N. Y., it is\r\nstill worn. Many farmers' wives, too, are enjoying its freedom in\r\ntheir rural homes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bloomer, editor of _The Lily_, at Seneca Falls, New York, was\r\nintroduced at the close of Mr. Blackwell's remarks, and read a\r\nwell-prepared digest of the laws for married women.\r\n\r\nReporting one of the sessions, the _Plain Dealer_ said:\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Gage, ever prompt in her place, called the Convention to\r\n     order at the usual hour. The Melodean at this time contained\r\n     1,500 people. We think the women may congratulate themselves on\r\n     having most emphatically \"made a hit\" in the forest city.\r\n\r\nOf the _personnel_ of the Convention, it says:\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Mott is matronly-looking, wearing the Quaker dress, and\r\n     apparently a good-natured woman. Her face does not indicate her\r\n     character as a fiery and enthusiastic advocate of reform. Mrs.\r\n     Gage is not a handsome woman, but her appearance altogether is\r\n     prepossessing. You can see genius in her eye. She presided with\r\n     grace at all the sessions of the Convention. The house was\r\n     thronged with intelligent audiences. The President frequently\r\n     contrasted the order, decorum, and kindness of the Cleveland\r\n     audiences, with the noisy and tumultuous demonstrations which\r\n     recently disgraced the city of New York, at the Convention held\r\n     there.\r\n\r\nHon. JOSHUA R. GIDDINGS, on being called to the stand, remarked:\r\n\r\n     That he was present to express, and happy of the opportunity to\r\n     express, his sincere interest in the cause, and regard for the\r\n     actors in this movement; but that on almost any other occasion he\r\n     could speak with less embarrassment than here, with such\r\n     advocates before him; and as he had not come prepared to address\r\n     the Convention, declined occupying its time longer.\r\n\r\nIn reading over the debates of these early Conventions, we find the\r\nspeakers dwelling much more on the wrongs in the Church and the Home,\r\nthan in the State. But few of the women saw clearly, and felt deeply\r\nthat the one cause of their social and religious degradation was their\r\ndisfranchisement, hence the discussions often turned on the\r\nsurface-wrongs of society.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANCES D. GAGE (with autograph).]\r\n\r\nMany of the friends present thought the Convention should issue an\r\noriginal Declaration of Rights, as nothing had been adopted as yet,\r\nexcept the parody on the Fathers' of' 76. Although that, and the one\r\nWilliam Henry Channing prepared, were both before the Convention, it\r\nadjourned without taking action on either.\r\n\r\nAs so many of these noble leaders in the anti-slavery ranks have\r\npassed away, we give in this chapter large space to their brave words.\r\nAlso to the treatment of Miss Brown, in the World's Temperance\r\nConvention, for its exceptional injustice and rudeness.\r\n\r\nMiss Brown read a letter from William H. Channing, in which he\r\nembodied his ideas of a Declaration. Lucy Stone also read a very able\r\nletter from Thomas Wentworth Higginson. Both of these letters contain\r\nvaluable suggestions for the adoption of practical measures for\r\nbringing the wrongs of woman to the notice of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MR. CHANNING'S LETTER.\r\n\r\n                                   ROCHESTER, N. Y., _Oct. 3, 1853_.\r\n\r\n     _To the President and Members of the Woman's Rights Convention:_\r\n\r\n     As I am prevented, to my deep regret, from being present at the\r\n     Convention, let me suggest in writing what I should prefer to\r\n     speak. First, however, I would once again avow that I am with you\r\n     heart, mind, soul, and strength for the Equal Rights of Women.\r\n     This great reform will prove to be, I am well assured, the\r\n     salvation and glory of this Republic, and of all Christian and\r\n     civilized States:\r\n\r\n          \"And if at once we may not\r\n          Declare the greatness of the work we plan,\r\n          Be sure at least that ever in our eyes\r\n          It stands complete before us as a dome\r\n          Of light beyond this gloom--a house of stars\r\n          Encompassing these dusky tents--a thing\r\n          Near as our hearts, and perfect as the heavens.\r\n          Be this our aim and model, and our hands\r\n          Shall not wax faint, until the work is done.\"\r\n\r\n     The Woman's Rights Conventions, which, since 1848, have been so\r\n     frequently held in New York, Ohio, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania,\r\n     etc., have aroused respectful attention, and secured earnest\r\n     sympathy, throughout the United States. It becomes the advocates\r\n     of the Equal Rights of Women, then, to take advantage of this\r\n     wide-spread interest and to press the Reform, at once, onward to\r\n     practical results.\r\n\r\n     Among other timely measures, these have occurred to me as\r\n     promising to be effective:\r\n\r\n     I. There should be prepared, printed, and widely circulated, A\r\n     DECLARATION OF WOMAN'S RIGHTS.\r\n\r\n     This Declaration should distinctly announce the inalienable\r\n     rights of women:\r\n\r\n     1st. As human beings,--irrespective of the distinction of\r\n     sex--actively to co-operate in all movements for the elevation of\r\n     mankind.\r\n\r\n     2d. As rational, moral, and responsible agents, freely to think,\r\n     speak, and do, what truth and duty dictate, and to be the\r\n     ultimate judges of their own sphere of action.\r\n\r\n     3d. As women, to exert in private and in public, throughout the\r\n     whole range of Social Relations, that special influence which God\r\n     assigns as their appropriate function, in endowing them with\r\n     feminine attributes.\r\n\r\n     4th. As members of the body politic, needing the protection,\r\n     liable to the penalties, and subject to the operation of the\r\n     laws, to take their fair part in legislation and administration,\r\n     and in appointing the makers and administrators of the laws.\r\n\r\n     5th. As constituting one-half of the people of these free and\r\n     United States, and as nominally, free women, to possess and use\r\n     the power of voting, now monopolized by that other half of the\r\n     people, the free men.\r\n\r\n     6th. As property holders, numbered and registered in every\r\n     census, and liable to the imposition of town, county, state, and\r\n     national taxes, either to be represented if taxed, or to be left\r\n     untaxed if unrepresented, according to the established precedent\r\n     of No taxation without representation.\r\n\r\n     7th. As producers of wealth to be freed from all restrictions on\r\n     their industry; to be remunerated according to the work done, and\r\n     not the sex of the workers, and whether married or single, to be\r\n     secured in the ownership of their gains, and the use and\r\n     distribution of their property.\r\n\r\n     8th. As intelligent persons, to have ready access to the best\r\n     means of culture, afforded by schools, colleges, professional\r\n     institutions, museums of science, galleries of art, libraries,\r\n     and reading-rooms.\r\n\r\n     9th. As members of Christian churches and congregations, heirs of\r\n     Heaven and children of God, to preach the truth, to administer\r\n     the rites of baptism, communion, and marriage, to dispense\r\n     charities, and in every way to quicken and refine the religious\r\n     life of individuals and of society.\r\n\r\n     The mere announcement of these rights, is the strongest argument\r\n     and appeal that can be made, in behalf of granting them. The\r\n     claim to their free enjoyment is undeniably just. Plainly such\r\n     rights are inalienable, and plainly too, woman is entitled to\r\n     their possession equally with man. Our whole plan of government\r\n     is a hypocritical farce, if one-half the people can be governed\r\n     by the other half without their consent being asked or granted.\r\n     Conscience and common sense alike demand the equal rights of\r\n     women. To the conscience and common sense of their\r\n     fellow-citizens, let women appeal untiringly, until their just\r\n     claims are acknowledged throughout the whole system of\r\n     legislation, and in all the usages of society.\r\n\r\n     And this introduces the next suggestion I have to offer.\r\n\r\n     II. Forms of petition should be drawn up and distributed for\r\n     signatures, to be offered to the State Legislatures at their next\r\n     sessions. These petitions should be directed to the following\r\n     points:\r\n\r\n     1st. That the right of suffrage be granted to the people,\r\n     universally, without distinction of sex; and that the age for\r\n     attaining legal and political majority, be made the same for\r\n     women as for men.\r\n\r\n     2d. That all laws relative to the inheritance and ownership of\r\n     property, to the division and administration of estates, and to\r\n     the execution of Wills, be made equally applicable to women and\r\n     men.\r\n\r\n     3d. That mothers be entitled, equally with fathers, to become\r\n     guardians of their children.\r\n\r\n     4th. That confirmed and habitual drunkenness, of either husband\r\n     or wife, be held as sufficient ground for divorce; and that the\r\n     temperate partner be appointed legal guardian of the children.\r\n\r\n     5th. That women be exempted from taxation until their right of\r\n     suffrage is practically acknowledged.\r\n\r\n     6th. That women equally with men be entitled to claim trial\r\n     before a jury of their peers.\r\n\r\n     These petitions should be firm and uncompromising in tone; and a\r\n     hearing should be demanded before Committees specially empowered\r\n     to consider and report them. In my judgment, the time is not\r\n     distant, when such petitions will be granted, and when justice,\r\n     the simple justice they ask, will be cordially, joyfully\r\n     rendered.\r\n\r\n     I call then for the publication of a Declaration of Woman's\r\n     Rights, accompanied by Forms of Petitions, by the National\r\n     Woman's Rights Convention at their present session. In good hope,\r\n\r\n                                   Your friend and brother,\r\n                                         WILLIAM HENRY CHANNING.\r\n\r\nMiss Brown remarked:\r\n\r\n     There is one of these demands, the fourth, which for myself, I\r\n     should prefer to have amended thus--instead of the word\r\n     \"divorce,\" I would insert \"legally separated.\" The letter\r\n     otherwise meets my cordial and hearty approbation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MR. HIGGINSON'S LETTER.\r\n\r\n                                   WORCESTER, _Sept. 15, 1853_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR FRIEND:--In writing to the New York Woman's Rights\r\n     Convention, I mentioned some few points of argument which no\r\n     opponents of this movement have ever attempted to meet. Suffer\r\n     me, in addressing the Cleveland Convention, to pursue a different\r\n     course, and mention some things which the friends of the cause\r\n     have not yet attempted to do.\r\n\r\n     I am of a practical habit of mind, and have noticed with some\r\n     regret that most of the friends of the cause have rested their\r\n     hopes, thus far, chiefly upon abstract reasoning. This is\r\n     doubtless of great importance, and these reasonings have already\r\n     made many converts; because the argument is so entirely on one\r\n     side that every one who really listens to it begins instantly to\r\n     be convinced. The difficulty is, that the majority have not yet\r\n     begun to listen to it, and this, in great measure, because their\r\n     attention has not been called to the facts upon which it is\r\n     founded.\r\n\r\n     Suppose, now, that an effort were made to develop the facts of\r\n     woman's wrongs. For instance:\r\n\r\n     1st. We say that the laws of every State of this Union do great\r\n     wrong to woman, married and single, as to her person and\r\n     property, in her private and public relations. Why not procure a\r\n     digest of the laws on these subjects, then; prepared carefully,\r\n     arranged systematically, corrected up to the latest improvements,\r\n     and accompanied by brief and judicious commentaries? No such work\r\n     exists, except that by Mansfield, which is now obsolete, and in\r\n     many respects defective.\r\n\r\n     2d. We complain of the great educational inequalities between the\r\n     sexes. Why not have a report, elaborate, statistical, and\r\n     accurate, on the provision for female education, public and\r\n     private, throughout the free States of this Union, at least? No\r\n     such work now exists.\r\n\r\n     3d. We complain of the industrial disadvantages of women, and\r\n     indicate at the same time, their capacities for a greater variety\r\n     of pursuits. Why not obtain a statement, on as large a scale as\r\n     possible, first, of what women are doing now, commercially and\r\n     mechanically, throughout the Union (thus indicating their\r\n     powers); and secondly, of the embarrassments with which they\r\n     meet, the inequality of their wages, and all the other\r\n     peculiarities of their position, in these respects? An essay, in\r\n     short, on the Business Employments and Interests of Women; such\r\n     an essay as Mr. Hunt has expressed to me his willingness to\r\n     publish in his Merchants' Magazine. No such essay now exists.\r\n\r\n     Each of these three documents would be an arsenal of arms for the\r\n     Woman's Rights advocate. A hundred dollars, appropriated to each\r\n     of these, would more than repay itself in the increased\r\n     subscriptions it would soon bring into the treasury of the cause.\r\n     That sum would, however, be hardly sufficient to repay even the\r\n     expenses of correspondence and traveling necessary for the last\r\n     two essays, or the legal knowledge necessary for the first.\r\n\r\n     If there is, however, known to the Convention at Cleveland any\r\n     person qualified and ready to undertake either of the above\r\n     duties for the above sum (no person should undertake more than\r\n     one of the three investigations), I would urge you to make the\r\n     appointment. It will require, however, an accurate, clear-headed,\r\n     and industrious person, with plenty of time to bestow. Better not\r\n     have it done at all, than not have it done thoroughly, carefully,\r\n     and dispassionately. Let me say distinctly, that I can not be a\r\n     candidate for either duty, in my own person, for want of time to\r\n     do it in; though I think I could render some assistance,\r\n     especially in preparing materials for the third essay. I would\r\n     also gladly subscribe toward a fund for getting the work done.\r\n\r\n     Permit me, finally, to congratulate you on the valuable results\r\n     of every Convention yet held to consider this question. I find\r\n     the fact everywhere remarked, that so large a number of women of\r\n     talent and character have suddenly come forward into a public\r\n     sphere. This phenomenon distinguishes this reform from all others\r\n     that have appeared in America, and illustrates with new meaning\r\n     the Greek myth of Minerva, born full-grown from the head of Jove.\r\n     And if (as some late facts indicate) this step forward only\r\n     promotes the Woman's Rights movement from the sphere of contempt\r\n     into the sphere of hostility and persecution--it is a step\r\n     forward, none the less. And I would respectfully suggest to the\r\n     noble women who are thus attacked, that they will only be the\r\n     gainers by such opposition, unless it lead to dissensions or\r\n     jealousies among themselves.\r\n\r\n                                        Yours cordially,\r\n                                             THOMAS WENTWORTH HIGGINSON.\r\n     MISS LUCY STONE.\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE remarked: This letter, you see, proposes that we shall\r\n     find some way, if possible, by which our complaints may be spread\r\n     before the people. We find men and women in our conventions,\r\n     earnest and thoughtful, who are not drawn by mere curiosity, but\r\n     from a conscious want of just such a movement as this. They go\r\n     away and carry to their villages and hamlets the ideas they have\r\n     gathered here; and it is a cause for thankfulness to God that so\r\n     many go away to repeat what they have heard. But we have wanted\r\n     the documents to scatter among the people, as the Tract Society\r\n     scatters its sheets. And now Mr. Higginson proposes that we have\r\n     these essays.\r\n\r\nThe President of Oberlin College, Rev. Asa Mahan, was present during\r\nall the sessions of the Convention, and took part in the debates. On\r\nthe subject of the Seneca Falls Declaration, he said:\r\n\r\n     I can only judge of the effect of anything upon the public mind,\r\n     by its effect upon my own. It has been suggested that that\r\n     Declaration is a parody. Now you can not present a parody,\r\n     without getting up a laugh; and wherever it goes, it will never\r\n     be seriously considered. If a declaration is to be made, it\r\n     should be one that will be seriously considered by the public. I\r\n     would suggest that the Declaration of this Convention be entirely\r\n     independent of the other.\r\n\r\n     I have a remark to make upon a sentiment advanced by Mrs. Rose. I\r\n     have this objection to the Declaration upon which she commented.\r\n     It is asserted there, that man has created a certain public\r\n     sentiment, and it is brought as a charge against the male sex.\r\n     Now I assert, that man never created that sentiment. I say it is\r\n     a wrong state of society totally, when, if woman shall be\r\n     degraded, a man committing the same offense shall not be degraded\r\n     also. There is perfect agreement between us there. But, that\r\n     Declaration charges that sentiment upon man. Now I assert that it\r\n     is chargeable upon woman herself; and that as she was first in\r\n     man's original transgression, she is first here.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ROSE: I heartily agree that we are both in fault; and yet we\r\n     are none in fault. I also said, that woman, on account of the\r\n     position in which she has been placed, by being dependent upon\r\n     man, by being made to look up to man, is the first to cast out\r\n     her sister. I know it and deplore it; hence I wish to give her\r\n     her rights, to secure her dependence upon herself. In regard to\r\n     that sentiment in the Declaration, our friend said that woman\r\n     created it. Is woman really the creator of the sentiment? The\r\n     laws of a country create sentiments. Who make the laws? Does\r\n     woman? Our law-makers give the popular ideas of morality.\r\n\r\n     Mr. BARKER: And the pulpit.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ROSE: I ought to have thought of it: not only do the\r\n     law-makers give woman her ideas of morality, but our pulpit\r\n     preachers. I beg pardon--no, I do not either--for Antoinette L.\r\n     Brown is not a priest. Our priests have given us public sentiment\r\n     called morals, and they have always made or recognized in daily\r\n     life, distinctions between man and woman. Man, from the time of\r\n     Adam to the present, has had utmost license, while woman must not\r\n     commit the slightest degree of \"impropriety,\" as it is termed.\r\n     Why, even to cut her skirts shorter than the fashion, is\r\n     considered a moral delinquency, and stigmatized as such by more\r\n     than one pulpit, directly or indirectly.\r\n\r\n     You ask me who made this sentiment; and my friend yonder, says\r\n     woman. She is but the echo of man. Man utters the sentiment, and\r\n     woman echoes it. As I said before--for I have seen and felt it\r\n     deeply--she even appears to be quite flattered with her cruel\r\n     tyrant, for such he has been made to be--she is quite flattered\r\n     with the destroyer of woman's character--aye, worse than that,\r\n     the destroyer of woman's self-respect and peace of mind--and when\r\n     she meets him, she is flattered with his attentions. Why should\r\n     she not be? He is admitted into Legislative halls, and to all\r\n     places where men \"most do congregate;\" why, then, should she not\r\n     admit him to her parlor? The woman is admitted into no such\r\n     places; the Church casts her out; and a stigma is cast upon her,\r\n     for what is called the slightest \"impropriety.\" Prescribed by no\r\n     true moral law, but by superstition and prejudice, she is cast\r\n     out not only from public places, but from private homes. And if\r\n     any woman would take her sister to her heart, and warm her there\r\n     again by sympathy and kindness, if she would endeavor once more\r\n     to infuse into her the spark of life and virtue, of morality and\r\n     peace, she often dare not so far encounter public prejudice as to\r\n     do it. It requires a courage beyond what woman can now possess,\r\n     to take the part of the woman against the villain. There are few\r\n     such among us, and though few, they have stood forward nobly and\r\n     gloriously. I will not mention names, though it is often a\r\n     practice to do so; I must, however, mention our sister, Lucretia\r\n     Mott, who has stood up and taken her fallen sister by the hand,\r\n     and warmed her at her own heart. But we can not expect every\r\n     woman to possess that degree of courage.\r\n\r\n     ABBY KELLY FOSTER: I want to say here that I believe the law is\r\n     but the writing out of public sentiment, and back of that public\r\n     sentiment, I contend lies the responsibility. Where shall we find\r\n     it? \"'Tis education forms the common mind.\" It is allowed that we\r\n     are what we are educated to be. Now if we can ascertain who has\r\n     had the education of us, we can ascertain who is responsible for\r\n     the law, and for public sentiment. Who takes the infant from its\r\n     cradle and baptizes it \"in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy\r\n     Ghost;\" and when that infant comes to childhood, who takes it\r\n     into Sabbath-schools; who on every Sabbath day, while its mind is\r\n     \"like clay in the hands of the potter,\" moulds and fashions it as\r\n     he will; and when that child comes to be a youth, where is he\r\n     found, one-seventh part of the time; and when he comes to maturer\r\n     age, does he not leave his plow in the furrow, and his tools in\r\n     the shop, and one-seventh part of the time go to the place where\r\n     prayer is wont to be made? On that day no sound is heard but the\r\n     roll of the carriage wheels to church; all are gathered there,\r\n     everything worldly is laid aside, all thoughts are given entirely\r\n     to the Creator; for we are taught that we must not think our own\r\n     thoughts, but must lay our own wills aside, and come to be\r\n     moulded and fashioned by the priest. It is \"holy time,\" and we\r\n     are to give ourselves to be wholly and entirely fashioned and\r\n     formed by another. That place is a holy place, and when we enter,\r\n     our eye rests on the \"holy of holies;\" he within it is a\r\n     \"divine.\" The \"divines\" of the thirteenth century, the \"divines\"\r\n     of the fifteenth century, and the \"divines\" of the nineteenth\r\n     century, are no less \"divines.\" What I say to-day is taken for\r\n     what it is worth, or perhaps for less than it is worth, because\r\n     of the prejudice against me; but when he who educates the people\r\n     speaks, \"he speaks as one having authority,\" and is not to be\r\n     questioned. He claims, and has his claim allowed, to be specially\r\n     ordained and specially anointed from God. He stands mid-way\r\n     between Deity and man, and therefore his word has power.\r\n\r\n     Aye, not only in middle age does the man come, leaving everything\r\n     behind him; but, in old age, \"leaning on the top of his staff,\"\r\n     he finds himself gathered in the place of worship, and though his\r\n     ear may be dull and heavy, he leans far forward to catch the last\r\n     words of duty--of duty to God and duty to man. Duty is the\r\n     professed object of the pulpit, and if it does not teach that,\r\n     what in Heaven's name does it teach? This anointed man of God\r\n     speaks of moral duty to God and man. He teaches man from the\r\n     cradle to the coffin; and when that aged form is gathered within\r\n     its winding-sheet, it is the pulpit that says, \"Dust to dust and\r\n     ashes to ashes.\"\r\n\r\n     It is the pulpit, then, which has the entire ear of the\r\n     community, one-seventh part of the time. If you say there are\r\n     exceptions, very well, that proves the rule. If there is one\r\n     family who do not go to church, it is no matter, its teachings\r\n     are engendered by those who do go; hence I would say, not only\r\n     does the pulpit have the ear of the community one-seventh part of\r\n     the time of childhood, but it has it under circumstances for\r\n     forming and moulding and fashioning the young mind, as no other\r\n     educating influence can have it. The pulpit has it, not only\r\n     under these circumstances; it has it on occasions of marriage,\r\n     when two hearts are welded into one; on occasions of sickness and\r\n     death, when all the world beside is shut out, when the mind is\r\n     most susceptible of impressions from the pulpit, or any other\r\n     source.\r\n\r\n     I say, then, that woman is not the author of this sentiment\r\n     against her fallen sister, and I roll back the assertion on its\r\n     source. Having the public ear one-seventh part of the time, if\r\n     the men of the pulpit do not educate the public mind, who does\r\n     educate it? Millions of dollars are paid for this education, and\r\n     if they do not educate the public mind in its morals, what, I\r\n     ask, are we paying our money for? If woman is cast out of\r\n     society, and man is placed in a position where he is respected,\r\n     then I charge upon the pulpit that it has been recreant to its\r\n     duty. If the pulpit should speak out fully and everywhere, upon\r\n     this subject, would not woman obey it? Are not women under the\r\n     special leading and direction of their clergymen? You may tell\r\n     me, that it is woman who forms the mind of the child; but I\r\n     charge it back again, that it is the minister who forms the mind\r\n     of the woman. It is he who makes the mother what she is;\r\n     therefore her teaching of the child is only conveying the\r\n     instructions of the pulpit at second hand. If public sentiment is\r\n     wrong on this (and I have the testimony of those who have spoken\r\n     this morning, that it is), the pulpit is responsible for it, and\r\n     has the power of changing it. The clergy claim the credit of\r\n     establishing public schools. Granted. Listen to the pulpit in any\r\n     matter of humanity, and they will claim the originating of it,\r\n     because they are the teachers of the people. Now, if we give\r\n     credit to the pulpit for establishing public schools, then I\r\n     charge them with having a bad influence over those schools; and\r\n     if the charge can be rolled off, I want it to be rolled off; but\r\n     until it can be done, I hope it will remain there.\r\n\r\n     Mr. MAHAN: No class of persons had better be drawn into our\r\n     discussions to be denounced, unless there is serious occasion for\r\n     it. I name the pulpit with solemn awe, and unless there is\r\n     necessity for it, charges had better not be made against it. Now,\r\n     I say that no practice and no usage in the Church can be found,\r\n     by which a criminal man, in reference to the crimes referred to,\r\n     may be kept in the Church and a criminal woman cast out. There is\r\n     no such custom in any of the churches of God. After twenty years'\r\n     acquaintance with the Church, I affirm that the practice does not\r\n     exist. Now, in regard to the origin of public sentiment, can a\r\n     pulpit be found, will the lady who has just sat down, name a\r\n     pulpit in the wide world, where the principle is advocated, that\r\n     a criminal woman should be excluded, and the man upheld? Whatever\r\n     faults may be in it, that fault is not there.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ROSE: Not in theory, but in practice.\r\n\r\n     Mr. MAHAN: Neither in theory nor in practice. Where a wrong state\r\n     of society exists, the pulpit may be in fault for not reprobating\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     ABBY K. FOSTER: I do not wish to mention names, or I could do so.\r\n     I could give many cases where ministers have been charged with\r\n     such crimes, and where the evidence of guilt was almost\r\n     insurmountable, and yet they were not disciplined. They were\r\n     afraid it would injure the Church, I remember one minister who\r\n     was brought up for trial, and meantime they suspended him from\r\n     office, and paid him only half his salary, but retained him as a\r\n     church member; when, if it had been the case of a woman, and had\r\n     the slightest shade of suspicion been cast upon her, they would\r\n     not have waited even for trial and judgment. They would have cast\r\n     her out of the church at once.\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON said: I have but a few words to submit to\r\n     the meeting at the present time. In regard to the position of the\r\n     Church and clergy, on the subject of purity, I think it is\r\n     sufficient to remind the people here, that whatever may be the\r\n     external form observed by the Church toward its members,\r\n     pertaining to licentiousness, one thing is noticeable, and that\r\n     is, that the marriage relation is abolished among three and a\r\n     half millions of people; and the abolition of marriage on that\r\n     frightful scale, is in the main sanctioned and sustained by the\r\n     American Church and clergy. And if this does not involve them in\r\n     all that is impure, and licentious, and demoralizing, I know not\r\n     what can do so.\r\n\r\n     As it respects the objection to our adopting the Declaration of\r\n     Independence as put forth at Seneca Falls, on the ground that it\r\n     is a parody, and that, being a parody, it will only excite the\r\n     mirthfulness of those who hear or read it in that form; I would\r\n     simply remark, that I very much doubt, whether, among candid and\r\n     serious men, there would be any such mirthfulness excited. At the\r\n     time that document was published, I read it, but I had forgotten\r\n     it till this morning, and on listening to it, my mind was deeply\r\n     impressed with its pertinacity and its power. It seemed to me,\r\n     the _argumentium ad hominum_, to this nation. It was measuring\r\n     the people of this country by their own standard. It was taking\r\n     their own words and applying their own principles to women, as\r\n     they have been applied to men. At the same time, I liked the\r\n     suggestion that we had better present an original paper to the\r\n     country; and on conferring with the Committee after the\r\n     adjournment, they agreed that it would be better to have such a\r\n     paper; and that paper will undoubtedly be prepared, although we\r\n     are not now ready to lay it before the Convention.\r\n\r\n     It was this morning objected to the Declaration of sentiments,\r\n     that it implied that man was the only transgressor, that he had\r\n     been guilty of injustice and usurpation, and the suggestion was\r\n     also made, that woman should not be criminated, in this only, but\r\n     regarded rather as one who had erred through ignorance; and our\r\n     eloquent friend, Mrs. Rose, who stood on this platform and\r\n     pleaded with such marked ability, as she always does plead in any\r\n     cause she undertakes to speak upon, told us her creed. She told\r\n     us she did not blame anybody, really, and did not hold any man to\r\n     be criminal, or any individual to be responsible for public\r\n     sentiment, as regards the difference of criminality of man and\r\n     woman.\r\n\r\n     For my own part, I am not prepared to respect that philosophy. I\r\n     believe in sin, therefore in a sinner; in theft, therefore in a\r\n     thief; in slavery, therefore in a slaveholder; in wrong,\r\n     therefore in a wrong-doer; and unless the men of this nation are\r\n     made by woman to see that they have been guilty of usurpation,\r\n     and cruel usurpation, I believe very little progress will be\r\n     made. To say all this has been done without thinking, without\r\n     calculation, without design, by mere accident, by a want of\r\n     light; can anybody believe this who is familiar with all the\r\n     facts in the case? Certainly, for one, I hope ever to lean to the\r\n     charitable side, and will try to do so. I, too, believe things\r\n     are done through misconception and misapprehension, which are\r\n     injurious, yes, which are immoral and unchristian; but only to a\r\n     limited extent. There is such a thing as intelligent wickedness,\r\n     a design on the part of those who have the light to quench it,\r\n     and to do the wrong to gratify their own propensities, and to\r\n     further their own interests. So, then, I believe, that as man has\r\n     monopolized for generations all the rights which belong to woman,\r\n     it has not been accidental, not through ignorance on his part;\r\n     but I believe that man has done this through calculation,\r\n     actuated by a spirit of pride, a desire for domination which has\r\n     made him degrade woman in her own eyes, and thereby tend to make\r\n     her a mere vassal.\r\n\r\n     It seems to me, therefore, that we are to deal with the\r\n     consciences of men. It is idle to say that the guilt is common,\r\n     that the women are as deeply involved in this matter as the men.\r\n     Never can it be said that the victims are as much to be blamed as\r\n     the victimizer; that the slaves are to be as much blamed as the\r\n     slaveholders and slave-drivers; that the women who have no\r\n     rights, are to be as much blamed as the men who have played the\r\n     part of robbers and tyrants. We must deal with conscience. The\r\n     men of this nation, and the men of all nations, have no just\r\n     respect for woman. They have tyrannized over her deliberately,\r\n     they have not sinned through ignorance, but theirs is not the\r\n     knowledge that saves. Who can say truly, that in all things he\r\n     acts up to the light he enjoys, that he does not do something\r\n     which he knows is not the very thing, or the best thing he ought\r\n     to do? How few there are among mankind who are able to say this\r\n     with regard to themselves. Is not the light all around us? Does\r\n     not this nation know how great its guilt is in enslaving\r\n     one-sixth of its people? Do not the men of this nation know ever\r\n     since the landing of the pilgrims, that they are wrong in making\r\n     subject one-half of the people? Rely upon it, it has not been a\r\n     mistake on their part. It has been sin. It has been guilt; and\r\n     they manifest their guilt to a demonstration, in the manner in\r\n     which they receive this movement. Those who do wrong ignorantly,\r\n     do not willingly continue in it, when they find they are in the\r\n     wrong. Ignorance is not an evidence of guilt certainly. It is\r\n     only an evidence of a want of light. They who are only ignorant,\r\n     will never rage, and rave, and threaten, and foam, when the light\r\n     comes; but being interested and walking in the light, will always\r\n     present a manly front, and be willing to be taught, and be\r\n     willing to be told they are in the wrong.\r\n\r\n     Take the case of slavery: How has the anti-slavery cause been\r\n     received? Not argumentatively, not by reason, not by entering the\r\n     free arena of fair discussion and comparing notes; the arguments\r\n     have been rotten eggs, and brickbats and calumny, and in the\r\n     southern portion of the country, a spirit of murder, and threats\r\n     to cut out the tongues of those who spoke against them. What has\r\n     this indicated on the part of the nation? What but conscious\r\n     guilt? Not ignorance, not that they had not the light. They had\r\n     the light and rejected it.\r\n\r\n     How has this Woman's Rights movement been treated in this\r\n     country, on the right hand and on the left? This nation ridicules\r\n     and derides this movement, and spits upon it, as fit only to be\r\n     cast out and trampled underfoot. This is not ignorance. They know\r\n     all about the truth. It is the natural outbreak of tyranny. It is\r\n     because the tyrants and usurpers are alarmed. They have been and\r\n     are called to judgment, and they dread the examination and\r\n     exposure of their position and character.\r\n\r\n     Women of America! you have something to blame yourselves for in\r\n     this matter, something to account for to God and the world.\r\n     Granted. But then you are the victims in this land, as the women\r\n     of all lands are, to the tyrannical power and godless ambition of\r\n     man; and we must show who are responsible in this matter. We must\r\n     test everybody here. Every one of us must give an account of\r\n     himself to God. It is an individual testing of character. Mark\r\n     the man or the woman who derides this movement, who turns his or\r\n     her back upon it; who is disposed to let misrule keep on, and you\r\n     will find you have a sure indication of character. You will find\r\n     that such persons are destitute of principles; for if you can\r\n     convict a man of being wanting in principle anywhere, it will be\r\n     everywhere. He who loves the right for its own sake, loves the\r\n     right everywhere. He who is a man of principle, is a man of\r\n     principle always. Let me see the man who is willing to have any\r\n     one of God's rational creatures sacrificed to promote anything,\r\n     aside from the well-being of that creature himself, and I will\r\n     show you an unprincipled man.\r\n\r\n     It is so in this movement. Nobody argues against it, nobody\r\n     pretends to have an argument. Your platform is free everywhere,\r\n     wherever, these Conventions are held. Yet no man comes forward in\r\n     a decent, respectable manner, to show you that you are wrong in\r\n     the charges you bring against the law-makers of the land. There\r\n     is no argument against it. The thing is self-evident. I should\r\n     not know how to begin to frame an argument. That which is\r\n     self-evident is greater than argument, and beyond logic. It\r\n     testifies of itself. You and I, as human beings, claim to have\r\n     rights, but I never think of going into an argument with anybody,\r\n     to prove that I ought to have rights. I have the argument and\r\n     logic here, it is in my own breast and consciousness; and the\r\n     logic of the schools becomes contemptible beside these. The more\r\n     you try to argue, the worse you are off. It is not the place for\r\n     metaphysics, it is the place for affirmation. Woman is the\r\n     counterpart of man; she has the same divine image, having the\r\n     same natural and inalienable rights as man. To state the\r\n     proposition is enough; it contains the argument, and nobody can\r\n     gainsay it, in an honorable way.\r\n\r\n     I rose simply to say, that though I should deprecate making our\r\n     platform a theological arena, yet believing that men are guilty\r\n     of intentional wrong, in keeping woman subject, I believe in\r\n     having them criminated. You talk of injustice, then there is an\r\n     unjust man somewhere. Even Mrs. Rose could talk of the guilt of\r\n     society. Society! I know nothing of society. I know the guilt of\r\n     individuals. Society is an abstract term: it is made up of\r\n     individuals, and the responsibility rests with individuals. So\r\n     then, if we are to call men to repentance, there is such a thing\r\n     as wrong-doing intelligently, sinning against God and man, with\r\n     light enough to convict us, and to condemn us before God and the\r\n     world. Let this cause then be pressed upon the hearts and\r\n     consciences, against those who hold unjust rights in their\r\n     possession.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ROSE: I want to make a suggestion to the meeting. This is\r\n     the afternoon of the last day of our Convention. We have now\r\n     heard here the Bible arguments on both sides, and I may say to\r\n     them that I agree with both, that is, I agree with neither. A\r\n     gentleman, Dr. Nevin, I believe, said this morning that he also\r\n     would reply to Mr. Barker, this afternoon. We have already had\r\n     Mr. Barker answered. If any one else speaks farther on Miss\r\n     Brown's side, somebody will have to reply upon the other. \"There\r\n     is a time and a season for everything,\" and this is no time to\r\n     discuss the Bible. I appeal to the universal experience of men,\r\n     to sustain me in asking whether the introduction of theological\r\n     quibbles, has not been a firebrand wherever they have been\r\n     thrown? We have a political question under discussion; let us\r\n     take that question and argue it with reference to right and\r\n     wrong, and let us argue it in the same way that your fathers and\r\n     mothers did, when they wanted to throw off the British yoke.\r\n\r\n     Dr. NEVIN: It will be unjust, not to permit me to speak.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. MOTT moved that he be allowed, since he had already got the\r\n     floor, without attempting to limit him at all; but that\r\n     immediately after, the Convention should take up the resolutions.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ROSE objected, because, if a third person should speak, then\r\n     a fourth must speak, or plead injustice, if not permitted to do\r\n     so.\r\n\r\nConsiderable confusion ensued, Dr. Nevin, however, persisting in\r\nspeaking, whereupon, the President invited him to the platform. He\r\ntook the stand, assuring the President and officers, as he passed\r\nthem, that he wished only to reply to some misinterpretations of Mr.\r\nBarker's, and would take but little of the time which they so much\r\nneeded for business. After commencing, however, with Bible in hand, he\r\nlaunched out into an irrelevant eulogium upon \"his Christ,\" etc.; from\r\nthat to personalities against Mr. Barker and his associates upon the\r\nplatform, calling him a \"renegade priest,\" \"an infidel from foreign\r\nshores, who had come to teach Americans Christianity!\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. GARRISON rose to a point of order, with regard to the\r\n     speaker's personalities as to the nativity of anybody.\r\n\r\n     Dr. NEVIN retorted: The gentleman has been making personalities\r\n     against the whole priesthood.\r\n\r\n     Mr. BARKER: I expressly and explicitly made exceptions. I only\r\n     wish that Mr. Nevin may not base his remarks upon a phantom.\r\n\r\n     Dr. NEVIN continued wandering on for some time, when Stephen S.\r\n     Foster rose, to a point of order, as follows: \"The simple\r\n     question before us, is whether woman is entitled to all the\r\n     rights to which the other sex is entitled. I want to say, that\r\n     the friend is neither speaking to the general question, nor\r\n     replying to Mr. Barker.\" Mr. Foster continued his remarks\r\n     somewhat, when Dr. Nevin demanded that the Chair protect him in\r\n     his right to the floor. The Chair decided that Mr. Foster was out\r\n     of order, in continuing to speak so long upon his point of order.\r\n\r\n     Mr. FOSTER said he would not appeal to the house from the\r\n     decision of the Chair, because he wished to save time. He\r\n     continued a moment longer, and sat down.\r\n\r\n     Dr. NEVIN proceeded, and in the course of his remarks drew\r\n     various unauthorized inferences, as the belief of Mr. Barker, in\r\n     the doctrines of Christ. Mr. Barker repeatedly corrected him, but\r\n     Dr. Kevin very ingeniously continued to reaffirm them in another\r\n     shape. Finally, Mr. Garrison, in his seat, addressing the\r\n     President, said: \"It is utterly useless to attempt to correct the\r\n     individual. He is manifestly here in the spirit of a blackguard\r\n     and rowdy.\" (A storm of hisses and cries of \"down!\" \"down!\")\r\n\r\n     Dr. NEVIN: I am sorry friend Garrison has thought fit to use\r\n     those words. He has been in scenes and situations like these, and\r\n     has himself stood up and spoken in opposition to the opinions of\r\n     audiences, too often not to have by this time been taught\r\n     patience.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. CLARK: Mr. Garrison is accustomed to call things by their\r\n     right names.\r\n\r\n     Dr. NEVIN: Very well, then I should call him--turning upon Mr.\r\n     G.--worse names than those. Only one word has fallen from woman\r\n     in this Convention, to which I can take exception, and that fell\r\n     from the lips of a lady whom I have venerated from my\r\n     childhood--it was, that the pulpit was the castle of cowards.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. MOTT: I said it was John Chambers' cowards' castle; and I do\r\n     say, that such ministers make it a castle of cowards; but I did\r\n     not wish to make the remark general, or apply it to all pulpits.\r\n\r\n     Dr. NEVIN continued some time longer.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. FOSTER asked, at the close of his remarks, if he believed it\r\n     was right for woman to speak what she believed to be the truth,\r\n     from the pulpit; to which he replied affirmatively, \"there and\r\n     everywhere.\"\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ROSE: I might claim my right to reply to the gentleman who\r\n     has just taken his seat. I might be able to prove from the\r\n     arguments he brought forward, that he was incorrect in the\r\n     statements he made, but I waive that right, the time has been so\r\n     unjustly consumed already. To one thing only, I will reply. He\r\n     charged France with being licentious, and spoke of the degraded\r\n     position of French women, as the result of the infidelity of that\r\n     nation. I throw back the slander he uttered, in regard to French\r\n     women. I am not a French woman, but if there is no other here to\r\n     vindicate them, I will do it. The French women are as moral as\r\n     any other people in any country; and when they have not been as\r\n     moral, it has been because they have been priest-ridden. I love\r\n     to vindicate the rights of those who are not present to defend\r\n     themselves.\r\n\r\n     STEPHEN S. FOSTER: Our \"reverend\" friend spoke of _dragging_\r\n     infidelity into this Convention, as though infidelity had to be\r\n     \"dragged\" here. I want to know if Christianity has been \"dragged\"\r\n     here, when the speakers made it the basis of their arguments. Who\r\n     ever dreamed of \"dragging\" Christianity here when they came to\r\n     advocate the rights of woman in the name of Christ? Why then\r\n     should any one stand up here and charge a speaker with \"dragging\"\r\n     infidelity when he advocates the rights of woman under the name\r\n     of an infidel. I supposed that Greek and Jew, Barbarian and\r\n     Scythian, Christian and Infidel had been invited to this\r\n     platform. One thing I know, we have had barbarians here, whether\r\n     we invited them or not; and I like to have barbarians here; I\r\n     know of no place where they are so likely to be civilized. I have\r\n     never yet been in a meeting managed by men when there was such\r\n     conflict of feelings, where there was not also ten times as much\r\n     confusion. And I think this meeting a powerful proof of the\r\n     superiority of our principles over those who oppose us.\r\n\r\n     Tell me if Christianity has not ever held the reins in this\r\n     country; and what has it done for woman? I am talking now of the\r\n     popular idea of Christianity. What has Christianity done for\r\n     woman for two hundred years past? Why, to-day, in this Christian\r\n     nation, there are a million and a half of women bought and sold\r\n     like cattle; a million and a half of women who can not say who\r\n     are the fathers of their children! I ask, are we to depend on a\r\n     Christianity like that to restore woman her rights? I am speaking\r\n     of your idea of Christianity--of Dr. Nevin's idea of\r\n     Christianity--I shall come to the true Christianity by and by.\r\n\r\n     One of two things is certain. The Church and Government deny to\r\n     woman her rights. There is not a denomination in this country\r\n     which places woman on an equality with man. Not one. Can you deny\r\n     it?\r\n\r\n     Mrs. MOTT: Except the Progressive Friends.\r\n\r\n     Mr. FOSTER: They are not a denomination, they have broken from\r\n     all bands and taken the name of the Friends of Progress. I say\r\n     there is not a religious society, having an organized body of\r\n     ministers, which admits woman's equality in the Gospel. Now, tell\r\n     me, in God's name, what we are to hope from the Church, when she\r\n     leaves a million and a half of women liable to be brought upon\r\n     the auction-block to-day? If the Bible is against woman's\r\n     equality, what are you to do with it? One of two things: either\r\n     you must sit down and fold up your hands, or you must discard the\r\n     divine authority of the Bible. Must you not? You must acknowledge\r\n     the correctness of your position, or deny the authority of the\r\n     Bible. If you admit the construction put upon the Bible by friend\r\n     Barker, to be a false one, or Miss Brown's construction to be the\r\n     true one, what then? Why, then, the priesthood of the country are\r\n     blind leaders of the blind. We have got forty thousand of them,\r\n     Dr. Nevin included with the rest. He stands as an accredited\r\n     Presbyterian, giving the hand of fellowship to the fraternity,\r\n     and withholding it from Garrison and others--he could not even\r\n     pray a few years ago in an anti-slavery meeting. Now, either the\r\n     Bible is against the Church and clergy, or else they have\r\n     misinterpreted it for two hundred years, yes, for six thousand\r\n     years. You must then either discard the Bible or the priesthood,\r\n     or give up Woman's Rights.\r\n\r\n     A friend says he does not regret this discussion. Why, it is the\r\n     only thing we have done effectively since we have been here. When\r\n     we played with jack-straws, we were hail-fellow with those who\r\n     now oppose us. When you come to take up the great questions of\r\n     the movement, when you propose to man, to divide with woman the\r\n     right to rule, then a great opposition is aroused. The ballot-box\r\n     is not worth a straw until woman is ready to use it. Suppose a\r\n     law were passed to-morrow, declaring woman's rights equal with\r\n     those of men, why, the facts would remain the same. The moment\r\n     that woman is ready to go to the ballot-box, there is not a\r\n     Constitution that will stand in the country. In this very city,\r\n     in spite of the law, I am told that negroes go to the ballot-box\r\n     and vote, without let or hindrance; and woman will go when she\r\n     resolves upon it. What we want for woman is the right of speech;\r\n     and in Dr. Nevin's reply to Mrs. Foster, does he mean that he\r\n     would be willing to accord the right of speech to woman and admit\r\n     her into the pulpit? I don't believe he would admit Antoinette\r\n     Brown to his pulpit. I was sorry Mrs. Foster did not ask him if\r\n     he would. I don't believe he dares to do it. I would give him a\r\n     chance to affirm or deny it. I hope some other friend will give\r\n     him that opportunity, and that Antoinette Brown may be able to\r\n     say that she was invited by the pastor of one of the largest\r\n     churches in this beautiful city, to speak to his people in his\r\n     pulpit; but if he does it, he is not merely one among a thousand,\r\n     but one among ten thousand.\r\n\r\n     I wish to have it understood that an infidel is as much at home\r\n     here as a Christian; and that his principles are no more\r\n     \"dragged\" here than those of a Christian. For myself, I claim to\r\n     be a Christian. No man ever heard me speak of Christ or of His\r\n     doctrines, but with the profoundest reverence. Still, I welcome\r\n     upon this platform those who differ as far as possible from me.\r\n     And the Atheist no more \"drags\" in his Atheism, provided he only\r\n     shows that Atheism itself demands woman's equality, and is no\r\n     more out of order than I, when I undertake to show that\r\n     Christianity preaches one law, one faith, and one line of duty\r\n     for all.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. MOTT: We ought to thank Dr. Nevin for his kindly fears, lest\r\n     we women should be brought out into the rough conflicts of life,\r\n     and overwhelmed by infidelity. I thank him, but at the same time\r\n     I must say, that if we have been able this afternoon to sit\r\n     uninjured by the hard conflict in which he has been engaged, if\r\n     we can maintain our patience at seeing him so laboriously build\r\n     up a man of straw, and then throw it down and destroy it, I think\r\n     we may be suffered to go into the world and bear many others\r\n     unharmed.\r\n\r\n     Again, I would ask in all seriousness, by what right does\r\n     Orthodoxy give the invidious name of Infidel, affix the stigma of\r\n     infidelity, to those who dissent from its cherished opinions?\r\n     What right have the advocates of moral reform, woman's rights,\r\n     abolition, temperance, etc., to call in question any man's\r\n     religious opinions? It is the assumption of bigots. I do not want\r\n     now to speak invidiously, and say sectarian bigots, but I mean\r\n     the same kind of bigotry which Jesus rebuked so sharply, when He\r\n     called certain men \"blind leaders of the blind.\"\r\n\r\n     Now, we hold Jesus up as an example, when we perceive the\r\n     assumption of clergymen, that all who venture to dissent from a\r\n     given interpretation, must necessarily be infidels; and thus\r\n     denounce them as infidels; for it was only by inference, that one\r\n     clergyman this afternoon made Joseph Barker deny the Son of God.\r\n     By inference in the same way, he might be made to deny everything\r\n     that is good, and praiseworthy, and true.\r\n\r\n     I want we should consider these things upon this platform. I am\r\n     not troubled with difficulties about the Bible. My education has\r\n     been such that I look to that Source whence all the inspiration\r\n     of the Bible comes. I love the truths of the Bible. I love the\r\n     Bible because it contains so many truths; but I never was\r\n     educated to love the errors of the Bible; therefore it does not\r\n     startle me to hear Joseph Barker point to some of those errors.\r\n     And I can listen to the ingenious interpretation of the Bible,\r\n     given by Antoinette Brown, and am glad to hear those who are so\r\n     skilled in the outward, when I perceive that they are beginning\r\n     to turn the Bible to so good an account. It gives evidence that\r\n     the cause is making very good progress. Why, my friend Nevin has\r\n     had to hear the temperance cause denounced as infidel, and proved\r\n     so by Solomon; and he has, no doubt, seen the minister in the\r\n     pulpit, turning over the pages of the Bible to find examples for\r\n     the wrong. But the Bible will never sustain him in making this\r\n     use of its pages, instead of using it rationally, and selecting\r\n     such portions of it as would tend to corroborate the right; and\r\n     these are plentiful; for notwithstanding the teaching of\r\n     theology, and men's arts in the religious world, men have ever\r\n     responded to righteousness and truth, when it has been advocated\r\n     by the servants of God, so that we need not fear to bring truth\r\n     to an intelligent examination of the Bible. It is a far less\r\n     dangerous assertion to say that God is unchangeable, than that\r\n     man is infallible.\r\n\r\nIn this debate on the Bible-position of woman, Mr. Garrison having\r\nalways been a close student of that Book, was so clear in his\r\npositions, and so ready in his quotations, that he carried the\r\naudience triumphantly with him. The Rev. Dr. Nevin came out of the\r\ncontest so chagrined, that, losing all sense of dignity, on meeting\r\nMr. Garrison in the vestibule of the hall, at the close of the\r\nConvention, he seized him by the nose and shook him vehemently. Mr.\r\nGarrison made no resistance, and when released, he calmly surveyed his\r\nantagonist and said, \"Do you feel better, my friend? do you hope thus\r\nto break the force of my argument?\" The friends of the Rev. Mr. Nevin\r\nwere so mortified with his ungentlemanly behavior that they suppressed\r\nthe scene in the vestibule as far as possible, in the Cleveland\r\njournals, and urged the ladies who had the report of the Convention in\r\ncharge, to make no mention of it in their publication. Happily, the\r\nfact has been resurrected in time to point a page of history.\r\n\r\nA question arising in the Convention as to the colleges, Antoinette\r\nBrown remarked:\r\n\r\n     That much and deeply as she loved Oberlin, she must declare that\r\n     it has more credit for liberality to woman than it deserves.\r\n     Girls are not allowed equal privileges and advantages there; they\r\n     are not allowed instructions in elocution, nor to speak on\r\n     commencement day. The only college in the country that places all\r\n     students on an equal footing, without distinction of sex or\r\n     color, is McGrawville College in Central New York. Probably\r\n     Antioch College, Ohio (President Horace Mann), will also admit\r\n     pupils on the same ground.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ROSE said she knew of no college where both sexes enjoyed\r\n     equal advantages. It matters not, however, if there be. We do not\r\n     deal with exceptions, but with general principles.\r\n\r\n     A sister has well remarked that we do not believe that man is the\r\n     cause of all our wrongs. We do not fight men--we fight bad\r\n     principles. We war against the laws which have made men bad and\r\n     tyrannical. Some will say, \"But these laws are made by men.\"\r\n     True, but they were made in ignorance of right and wrong, made in\r\n     ignorance of the eternal principles of justice and truth. They\r\n     were sanctioned by superstition, and engrafted on society by long\r\n     usage. The Declaration issued by the Seneca Falls Convention is\r\n     an instrument no less great, no less noble than that to which it\r\n     bears a resemblance.\r\n\r\n     In closing she alluded to that portion of Mr. Channing's\r\n     Declaration which referred to the code of morals by which a\r\n     fallen woman is forever ruined, while the man who is the cause\r\n     of, or sharer in her crime, is not visited by the slightest\r\n     punishment. \"It is time to consider whether what is wrong in one\r\n     sex can be right in another. It is time to consider why if a\r\n     woman commits a fault, too often from ignorance, from\r\n     inexperience, from poverty, because of degradation and\r\n     oppression--aye! because of designing, cruel man; being made\r\n     cruel by ignorance of laws and institutions,--why such a being,\r\n     in her helplessness, in her ignorance, in her inexperience and\r\n     dependency--why a being thus situated, not having her mind\r\n     developed, her faculties called out: and not allowed to mix in\r\n     society to give her experience, not being acquainted with human\r\n     nature, is drawn down, owing often to her best and tenderest\r\n     feelings; in consequence also of being accustomed to look up to\r\n     man as her superior, as her guardian, as her master,--why such a\r\n     being should be cast out of the pale of humanity, while he who\r\n     committed the crime, or who is, if not the main, the great\r\n     secondary cause of it,--he who is endowed with superior\r\n     advantages of education and experience, he who has taken\r\n     advantage of that weakness and confiding spirit, which the young\r\n     always have,--I ask, if the victim is cast out of the pale of\r\n     society, shall the despoiler go free?\" The question was answered\r\n     by a thunder of \"No! no! no!\" from all parts of the house. A\r\n     profound sensation was observable. \"And yet,\" said Mrs. Rose, \"he\r\n     does go free!!\"\r\n\r\nErnestine L. Rose, says the _Plain Dealer_, is the master-spirit of\r\nthe Convention. She is described as a Polish lady of great beauty,\r\nbeing known in this country as an earnest advocate of human liberty.\r\nThough a slight foreign accent is perceptible, her delivery is\r\neffective. She spoke with great animation. The impression made by her\r\naddress was favorable both to the speaker and the cause. In speaking\r\nof the _personnel_ of the platform, it says:\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Lydia Ann Jenkins, of New York, who made an effective\r\n     speech, is habited in the Bloomer costume, and appears to much\r\n     advantage on the stage. Her face is amiable, and her delivery\r\n     excellent. She is as fine a female orator as we have heard. The\r\n     address embodied the usual arguments offered in favor of this\r\n     cause, and were put in a forcible and convincing manner. We say\r\n     convincing, because such a speaker would convince the most\r\n     obdurate unbeliever against his will.\r\n\r\n     Miss Stone is somewhat celebrated for an extraordinary enthusiasm\r\n     in the cause of her sex, and for certain eccentricities of speech\r\n     and thought, as well as of outward attire. She is as independent\r\n     in mind as in dress. She is as ready to throw off the restraints\r\n     society seems to have placed on woman's mind, as she is to cast\r\n     aside what she considers an absurd fashion in dress. Without\r\n     endorsing the eliminated petticoats, we can not but admire Miss\r\n     Stone's \"stern old Saxon pluck,\" and her total independence of\r\n     the god, Fashion. Her dress is first a black velvet coat with\r\n     collar, fastened in front with buttons, next a skirt of silk,\r\n     reaching to the knees, then \"she wears the breeches\" of black\r\n     silk, with neat-fitting gaiters. Her hair is cut short and combed\r\n     straight back. Her face is not beautiful, but there is mind in\r\n     it; it is earnest, pleasant, prepossessing. Miss Stone must be\r\n     set down as a lady of no common abilities, and of uncommon energy\r\n     in the pursuit of a cherished idea. She is a marked favorite in\r\n     the Conventions.\r\n\r\nDuring the proceedings, Miss Brown, in a long speech on the Bible,\r\nhad expounded many doctrines and passages of Scripture in regard to\r\nwoman's position, in direct opposition to the truths generally\r\npromulgated by General Assemblies, and the lesser lights of the\r\nChurch. Mrs. Emma R. Coe took an equally defiant position toward the\r\nBench and the Bar, coolly assuming that she understood the spirit of\r\nConstitutions and Statute Laws. Some lawyer had made a criticism on\r\nthe woman's petition then circulating in Ohio, and essayed to give the\r\nConvention some light on the laws of the State, to all of which Mrs.\r\nCoe says:\r\n\r\n     I have very little to say this evening beyond reading a letter,\r\n     received by me to-day. (Here follows the letter). I beg leave to\r\n     inform the gentleman, if he is present, that I believe I\r\n     understand these laws, and this point particularly, very nearly\r\n     as well as himself; and that I am well acquainted with the laws\r\n     passed since 1840, as with those enacted previous to that time. I\r\n     would also inform him that the committee, some of whom are much\r\n     better read in law than myself, were perfectly aware of the\r\n     existence of the statutes he mentions, but did not see fit to\r\n     incorporate them into the petition, not only on account of their\r\n     great length, but because they do not at all invalidate the\r\n     position which the petition affects to establish, viz: the\r\n     inequality of the sexes before the law. Their insertion,\r\n     therefore, would have been utterly superfluous. This letter\r\n     refers, evidently, to that portion of the petition which treats\r\n     of the equalization of property, which I will now read. (Then\r\n     follows the reading of one paragraph of the petition). Again I\r\n     refer you to the letter, the first paragraph of which is as\r\n     follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Mrs. Emma R. Coe, will you look at Vol. 44, General Laws of\r\n     Ohio, page 75, where you will find that the property of the wife\r\n     can not be taken for the debts of her husband, etc.; and all\r\n     articles of household furniture, and goods which a wife shall\r\n     have brought with her in marriage, or which shall have come to\r\n     her by bequest, gift, etc., after marriage, or purchased with her\r\n     separate money or other property, shall be exempt from liability\r\n     for the debts of her husband, during her life, and during the\r\n     life of any heir of her body.\"\r\n\r\n     Very true: we readily admit the law of which the gentleman has\r\n     given an abstract; and so long as the wife holds the property in\r\n     her hands, just as she received it, it can not be taken for the\r\n     husband's debts, but the moment she permits her husband to\r\n     convert that property into another shape, it becomes his, and may\r\n     be taken for his debts. The gentleman I presume will admit this\r\n     at once.\r\n\r\n     The next paragraph of the letter reads thus: \"Also in Vol. 51,\r\n     General Laws of Ohio, page 449, the act regulating descent, etc.,\r\n     provides, that real estate, which shall have come to the wife by\r\n     descent, devise, or gift, from her ancestor, shall\r\n     descend--first, to her children, or their legal representatives.\r\n     Second, if there be no children, or their legal representatives\r\n     living, the estate shall pass to the brothers and sisters of the\r\n     intestate, who may be of the blood of the ancestor from whom the\r\n     estate came, or their legal representatives,\" etc. True again: So\r\n     long as the wife holds real estate in her own name, in title,\r\n     and in title only, it is hers; for her husband even then controls\r\n     its profits, and if she leave it so, it will descend to her heirs\r\n     so long as she has an heir, and so long as she can trace the\r\n     descent. But if she suffers her husband to sell that property and\r\n     receive the money, it instantly becomes his; and instead of\r\n     descending to her heirs, it descends to his heirs. This the\r\n     gentleman will not deny. Now, we readily admit, that while the\r\n     wife abides by the statutes, of which our article has given us an\r\n     abstract, her husband can not take the property from her, he can\r\n     only take the use of it. But the moment she departs from the\r\n     statute, she comes under the provisions of the common law; which,\r\n     when they do not conflict, is equally binding in Ohio, as the\r\n     statute law. And in this case the common and statute laws do not\r\n     conflict. Departing from the statute, that is, suffering her\r\n     property to be exchanged, the provision is thus: (Here follows\r\n     the common law, taken from the petition). I have nothing further\r\n     to add on this point, but will quote the last paragraphs in the\r\n     letter.\r\n\r\n     \"If you would know what our laws are, you must refer to the laws\r\n     passed in Ohio since 1840.\"\r\n\r\n     This has already been answered.\r\n\r\n     \"You said last night, that the property of the wife passed to the\r\n     husband, even to his sixteenth cousin! Will you correct your\r\n     error? And oblige                               A BUCKEYE.\"\r\n\r\n     I should be extremely happy to oblige the gentleman, but having\r\n     committed no error there is nothing to correct; and I do not,\r\n     therefore, see that I can in conscience comply with his request.\r\n     I am, however, exceedingly thankful for any expression of\r\n     interest from that quarter. There are other laws which might be\r\n     mentioned, which really give woman an apparent advantage over\r\n     man; yet, having no relevancy to the subject in the petition, we\r\n     did not see fit to introduce them. One of these is, that no woman\r\n     shall be subject to arrest and imprisonment for debt; while no\r\n     man, that is, no ordinary man, none unless he has a halo of\r\n     military glory around his brow, is held sacred from civil process\r\n     of this kind. But this exemption is of very little benefit to\r\n     woman, since, if the laws were as severe to her as to man, she\r\n     would seldom risk the penalty. For this there are two very good\r\n     reasons. One is, that conscious of her inability to discharge\r\n     obligations of this kind, she has little disposition to run\r\n     deeply into debt; and the other is, that she has not the credit\r\n     to do it if she wished! If, however, she does involve herself in\r\n     this way, the law exempts her from imprisonment. This, perhaps,\r\n     is offered as a sort of palliation for the disabilities which she\r\n     suffers in other respects. The only object of the petition is, I\r\n     believe, that the husband and wife be placed upon a legal and\r\n     political equality. If the law gives woman an advantage over man,\r\n     we deprecate it as much as he can. Partiality to either, to the\r\n     injury of the other, is wrong in principle, and we must therefore\r\n     oppose it. We do not wish to be placed in the position which the\r\n     husband now occupies. We do not wish that control over his\r\n     interests, which he may now exercise over the interests of the\r\n     wife. We would no sooner intrust this power to woman than to man.\r\n     We would never place her in authority over her husband.\r\n\r\n     The question of woman's voting, of the propriety of woman's\r\n     appearing at the polls, is already settled. See what has been\r\n     done in Detroit: On the day of the late election, the women went\r\n     to the offices and stores of gentlemen, asking them if they had\r\n     voted. If the reply happened to be in the negative, as was often\r\n     the case, the next question was, \"Will you be kind enough to take\r\n     this vote, sir, and deposit it in the ballot-box for me?\" Which\r\n     was seldom, if ever, refused. And so, many a man voted for the\r\n     \"Maine Law,\" who would not, otherwise, have voted at all. But\r\n     this was not all; many women kept themselves in the vicinity of\r\n     the polls, and when they found a man undecided, they ceased not\r\n     their entreaties until they had gained him to the Temperance\r\n     cause. More than this, two women finding an intemperate man in\r\n     the street, talked to him four hours, before they could get him\r\n     to promise to vote as they wished. Upon his doing so, they\r\n     escorted him, one on each side, to the ballot-box, saw him\r\n     deposit the vote they had given him, and then treated him to a\r\n     good supper.\r\n\r\n     Now, this is more than any Woman's Rights advocate ever thought\r\n     of proposing. Yet no one thinks of saying a word against it,\r\n     because it was done for temperance. But how much worse would it\r\n     have been for those women to have gone to the polls with a\r\n     brother or husband, instead of with this man? Or to have\r\n     deposited two votes in perhaps five minutes' time, than to have\r\n     spent four hours in soliciting some other person to give one? Why\r\n     is it worse to go to the ballot-box with our male friends, than\r\n     to the church, parties, or picnics, etc.? If a man should control\r\n     the political principles of his wife, he should also control her\r\n     religious principles.\r\n\r\n     CHARLES C. BURLEIGH: Among the resolutions which have been acted\r\n     upon and adopted by this meeting is one which affirms that for\r\n     man to attempt to fix the sphere of woman, is cool assumption. I\r\n     purpose to take that sentiment for the text of a few words of\r\n     remark this evening, for it is just there that I think the whole\r\n     controversy hinges. It is not so much what is woman's appropriate\r\n     sphere; it is not so much what she may do and what she may not\r\n     do, that we have to contend about; as whether one human being or\r\n     one class of human beings is to fix for another human being, or\r\n     another class of human beings, the proper field of action and the\r\n     proper mode of employing the faculties which God has given them.\r\n     If I understand aright the principles of liberty, just here is\r\n     the point of controversy, between the despot and the champion of\r\n     human rights, in any department. Just when one human being\r\n     assumes to decide for another what is that other's sphere of\r\n     action, just then despotism begins. Everything else is but the\r\n     legitimate consequence of this.\r\n\r\n     I have said it is not so much a matter of controversy what woman\r\n     may do or may not do. Why, it would be a hard matter to say what\r\n     has been recognized by men themselves, as the legitimate sphere\r\n     of woman. We have a great deal of contradiction and opposition\r\n     nowadays when woman attempts to do this, that, or the other\r\n     thing, although that very thing has sometime or other, and\r\n     somewhere or other, been performed or attempted to be performed\r\n     by woman, with man's approval. If you talk about politics, why,\r\n     woman's participation in politics is no new thing, is no mere\r\n     assumption on her part, but has been recognized as right and\r\n     proper by men.\r\n\r\n     You have already been told of distinguished women who have borne\r\n     a very prominent part in politics, both in ancient and modern\r\n     times, and yet the multitude of men have believed and\r\n     acknowledged that it was all right; and are now acknowledging it\r\n     with all the enthusiasm of devoted loyalty. They are now\r\n     acknowledging it in the case of an Empire on which it has been\r\n     said that the sun never sets--an Empire, \"The morning drumbeat of\r\n     whose military stations circles the earth with one continued peal\r\n     of the martial airs of England.\" It is recognized, too, not by\r\n     the ignorant and thoughtless only, or the radical and heretical\r\n     alone, but also by multitudes of educated and pious men. That\r\n     bench of Bishops, sitting in the House of Lords, receiving its\r\n     very warrant to act politically, from the hands of a woman,\r\n     listening to a speech from a woman on the throne, endorses every\r\n     day the doctrine that a woman may engage in politics.\r\n\r\n     If you seize the young tree, when it just begins to put forth to\r\n     the air and sunshine and dews, and bend it in all directions for\r\n     fear it will not grow in proper shape, do not hold the tree\r\n     accountable for its distortion. There is no danger that from\r\n     acorns planted last year, pine trees will grow, if you do not\r\n     take some special care to prevent it. There is no danger that\r\n     from an apple will grow an oak, or, from a peach-stone an elm;\r\n     leave nature to work out her own results, or, in other words,\r\n     leave God to work out His own purpose, and be not so anxious to\r\n     intrude yourselves upon Him and to help Him govern the Universe\r\n     He has made. Some of us have too high an estimation of His\r\n     goodness and wisdom to be desirous of thrusting ourselves into\r\n     His government. We are willing to leave the nature of woman to\r\n     manifest itself in its own aptitudes. Try it. Did one ever trust\r\n     in God and meet with disappointment? Never! Tyrants always say it\r\n     is not safe to trust their subjects with freedom. Austria says it\r\n     is not safe to trust the Hungarian with freedom. Man says woman\r\n     is not safe in freedom, she will get beyond her sphere.\r\n\r\n     After having oppressed her for centuries, what wonder if she\r\n     should rebound, and at the first spring, even manifest that law\r\n     of reaction somewhat to your inconvenience, and somewhat even\r\n     beyond the dictates of the wisest judgment. What then? Is the\r\n     fault to be charged to the removal of the restraint; or is it to\r\n     be charged to the first imposition of the restraint? The\r\n     objection of our opponents remind one of the Irishman walking\r\n     among the bushes just behind his companion, who caught hold of a\r\n     branch, and passing on, let it fly back into the face of his\r\n     friend; \"Indade I am thankful to ye!\" said the injured man, \"for\r\n     taking hold of that same; it a'most knocked the brains out of me\r\n     body as it was, an' sure, if ye hadn't caught hold of it, it\r\n     would have kilt me intirely!\"\r\n\r\n     The winds come lashing over your lake, the waters piling upon\r\n     each other, wave rolling upon wave, and you may say what a pity\r\n     we could not bridge the lake over with ice, so as to keep down\r\n     these billows which may rise so high as to submerge us. But stand\r\n     still! God has fixed the law upon the waters, \"thus far shalt\r\n     thou come\"; and as you watch the ever piling floods, it secures\r\n     their timely downfall. When they come as far as their appointed\r\n     limits, the combing crest of the wave tells that the hour of\r\n     safety has arrived, proving that God was wiser than you in\r\n     writing down laws for His creation. We need not bridge over\r\n     woman's nature with the ice of conventionalism, for fear she will\r\n     swell up, aye, and overflow the continent of manhood. There is no\r\n     danger. Trust to the nature God has given to humanity, and do not\r\n     except the nature He has given to this portion of humanity.\r\n\r\n     But I need not dwell upon such an argument before an audience who\r\n     have witnessed the bearing of women in this Convention. It is a\r\n     cool, aye, insolent assumption for man to prescribe the sphere of\r\n     woman. What is the sphere of woman? Clearly, you say, her powers,\r\n     her natural instincts and desires determine her sphere. Who,\r\n     then, best knows those instincts and desires? Is it he who has\r\n     all his knowledge at second-hand, rather than she who has it in\r\n     all her consciousness?\r\n\r\n     If, then, you find in the progress of the race hitherto, that\r\n     woman has revealed herself pure, true, and beautiful, and lofty\r\n     in spirit, just in proportion as she has enjoyed the right to\r\n     reveal herself; if this is the testimony of all past experience,\r\n     I ask you where you will find the beginning of an argument\r\n     against the claim of woman to the right to enlarge her sphere yet\r\n     more widely, than she has hitherto done. Wait until you see some\r\n     of these apprehended evils, aye, a little later even, than that,\r\n     until you see the natural subsidence of the reaction from the\r\n     first out-bound of their oppression, before you tell us it is not\r\n     safe or wise to permit woman the enlargement of her own sphere.\r\n\r\n     The argument which I have thus based upon the very nature of man,\r\n     and of humanity and God, is confirmed in every particular--is\r\n     most impregnably fortified on every point, by the facts of all\r\n     past experience and all present observation; and out of all this\r\n     evidence of woman's right and fitness to determine her own\r\n     sphere, I draw a high prophecy of the future. I look upon this\r\n     longing of hers for a yet higher and broader field, as an\r\n     evidence that God designed her to enter upon it.\r\n\r\n          \"Want, is the garner of our bounteous Sire;\r\n          Hunger, the promise of its own supply.\"\r\n\r\n     I might even add the rest of the passage as an address to woman\r\n     herself, who still hesitates to assert the rights which she feels\r\n     to be hers and longs to enjoy; I might repeat to her in the words\r\n     of the same poet:\r\n\r\n          \"We weep, because the good we seek is not,\r\n          When but for _this_ it is not, that we weep;\r\n          We creep in dust to wail our lowly lot,\r\n          Which were not lowly, if we scorned to creep;\r\n          That which we _dare_ we shall be, when the will\r\n          Bows to prevailing Hope, its would-be to fulfill.\"\r\n\r\n     It can be done. This demand of woman can be nobly and\r\n     successfully asserted. It can be, because it is but the\r\n     out-speaking of the divine sentiment of woman. Let us not then\r\n     tremble, or falter, or despair--I know we shall not. I know that\r\n     those who have taken hold of this great work, and carried it\r\n     forward hitherto, against obloquy, and persecution, and\r\n     contempt, will not falter now. No! Every step is bearing us to a\r\n     higher eminence, and thus revealing a broader promise of hope, a\r\n     brighter prospect of success. Though they who are foremost in\r\n     this cause must bear obloquy and reproach, and though it may seem\r\n     to the careless looker-on, that they advance but little or not at\r\n     all; they know that the instinct which impels them being divine,\r\n     it can not be that they shall fail. They know that every quality\r\n     of their nature, every attribute of their Creator, is pledged to\r\n     their success.\r\n\r\n          \"They never fail who gravely plead for right,\r\n            God's faithful martyrs can not suffer loss.\r\n          Their blazing faggots sow the world with light,\r\n            Heaven's gate swings open on their bloody cross.\"\r\n\r\n     Pres. MAHAN: If I would not be interrupting at all, there are a\r\n     few thoughts having weight upon my mind which I should be very\r\n     happy to express. I have nothing to say to excite controversy at\r\n     all, but there are things which are said, the ultimate bearing of\r\n     which I believe is not always understood. I have heard during\r\n     these discussions, things said which bear this aspect--that the\r\n     relation of ruler and subject is that of master and slave. The\r\n     idea of the equality of woman with man, seems to be argued upon\r\n     this idea. I am not now to speak whether it is lawful for man to\r\n     rule the woman at all; but I wish to make a remark upon the\r\n     principles of governor and governed. The idea seems to be\r\n     suggested that if the wife is subject to the husband, the wife is\r\n     a slave to the man--if He has said, in the sense in which some\r\n     would have it, even that the woman should be subject to the man,\r\n     and the wife to the husband, you will find that in no other\r\n     position will woman attain her dignity; for God has never dropped\r\n     an inadvertent thought, never penned an inadvertent line. There\r\n     is not a law or principle of His being, that whoever penned that\r\n     Book did not understand. There is not a right which that Book\r\n     does not recognize; and there is not a duty which man owes to\r\n     woman, or woman to man, that is not there enjoined. It is my firm\r\n     conviction, that there is but one thing to be done on this\r\n     subject--if the women of this State want the elective franchise,\r\n     they can have it. I don't believe it is in the heart of man to\r\n     refuse it. Only spread the truth, adhere to Woman's Rights, and\r\n     adhere to that one principle, and when the people are convinced\r\n     that her claim is just, it will be allowed.\r\n\r\nOf Charles C. Burleigh the _Plain Dealer_ says:\r\n\r\n     This noble poet had not said much in the Convention. He had taken\r\n     no part in the interferences and interruptions of other\r\n     gentlemen, Mr. Barker and Mr. Nevin for instance.\r\n\r\n     When at length he took the stand he did indeed speak out a noble\r\n     defense of woman's rights. It was the only speech made before the\r\n     Convention by man in which the cause of woman was advocated\r\n     exclusively. When Mr. Burleigh arose, two or three geese hissed;\r\n     when he closed, a shower of applause greeted him.\r\n\r\nWe hope the reader will not weary of these debates. As the efforts of\r\nmany of our early speakers were extemporaneous, but little of what\r\nthey said will be preserved beyond this generation unless recorded\r\nnow. These debates show the wit, logic, and readiness of our women;\r\nthe clear moral perception, the courage, and honesty of our noble\r\nGarrison; the skill and fiery zeal of Stephen Foster; the majesty and\r\nbeauty of Charles Burleigh; and, in Asa Mahan, the vain struggles of\r\nthe wily priest, to veil with sophistry the degrading slavery of\r\nwoman, in order to reconcile her position as set forth in certain\r\nman-made texts of Scripture with eternal justice and natural law. Mr.\r\nMahan would not have been willing himself, to accept even the mild\r\nform of subjection he so cunningly assigns to woman. The deadliest\r\nopponents to the recognition of the equal rights of woman, have ever\r\nbeen among the orthodox clergy as a class.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORLD'S TEMPERANCE CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nJust previous to this, two stormy Conventions had been held in the\r\ncity of New York; one called to discuss Woman's Rights, the other a\r\nWorld's Temperance Convention. Thus many of the leaders of each\r\nmovement met for the first time to measure their powers of logic and\r\npersuasion.\r\n\r\nAntoinette L. Brown was appointed a delegate by two Temperance\r\nassociations. Her credentials were accepted, and she took her seat as\r\na member of the Convention; but when she arose to speak a tempest of\r\nindignation poured upon her from every side. As this page in history\r\nwas frequently referred to in the Cleveland Convention, we will let\r\nMiss Brown here tell her own story:\r\n\r\n     Why did we go to that World's Convention? We went there because\r\n     the call was extended to \"the world.\" On the 12th of May a\r\n     preliminary meeting had been held at New York--the far-famed\r\n     meeting at the Brick Chapel. There, because of the objection\r\n     taken by some who were not willing to have the \"rest of mankind\"\r\n     come into the Convention, a part of those present withdrew. They\r\n     thought they would have a \"Whole World's Temperance Convention,\"\r\n     and they thought well, as the result proved. When it was known\r\n     that such a Convention would be called, that all persons would be\r\n     invited to consider themselves members of the Convention, who\r\n     considered themselves members of the world, some of the leaders\r\n     of the other Convention--the half world's Convention--felt that\r\n     if it were possible, they would not have such a meeting held;\r\n     therefore they took measures to prevent it. Now, let me read a\r\n     statement from another delegate to that Convention, Rev. Wm. H.\r\n     Channing, of Rochester. (Miss Brown read an extract from the\r\n     _Tribune_, giving the facts in regard to her appointment as\r\n     delegate, by a society of long standing, in Rochester, and\r\n     extracts, also, of letters from persons prominent in the Brick\r\n     Chapel meeting, urging Mr. Greeley to persuade his party to\r\n     abandon the idea of a separate Convention, a part of such\r\n     writers pleading that it was an unnecessary movement, as the call\r\n     to the World's Temperance Convention was broad enough, and\r\n     intended to include all). This appointment was made without my\r\n     knowledge or consent, but with my hearty endorsement, when I knew\r\n     it was done. Let me state also, that a society organized and for\r\n     years in existence in South Butler, N. Y., also appointed\r\n     delegates to that Convention, and myself among the number. They\r\n     did so because, though they knew the call invited all the world\r\n     to be present, yet they thought it best to have their delegations\r\n     prepared with credentials, if being prepared would do any good.\r\n\r\n     When we reached New York, we heard some persons saying that women\r\n     would be received as delegates, and others saying they would not.\r\n     We thought we ought to test that matter, and do it, too, as\r\n     delicately and quietly as possible. There were quite a number of\r\n     ladies appointed delegates to that meeting, but it was felt that\r\n     not many would be necessary to make the test of their sincerity.\r\n\r\n     We met at the Woman's Bights Convention on the day of the opening\r\n     of the half world's Temperance Convention, and had all decided to\r\n     be content with our own Temperance Convention, which had passed\r\n     off so quietly and triumphantly. Wendell Phillips and I sat\r\n     reconsidering the whole matter. I referred him to the fact, which\r\n     had come to me more than once during the few last days, that the\r\n     officials of the Convention in session at Metropolitan Hall, and\r\n     others, had been saying that women would be received no doubt;\r\n     that the Brick Chapel meeting was merely an informal preliminary\r\n     meeting, and its decisions of no authority upon the Convention\r\n     proper; and that the women were unjust in saying, that their\r\n     brethren would not accept their co-operation before it had been\r\n     fairly tested. Then, said Phillips, \"Go, by all means; if they\r\n     receive you, you have only to thank them for rebuking the action\r\n     of the Brick Chapel meeting. Then we will withdraw and come back\r\n     to our own meeting. If, on the other hand, they do not receive\r\n     you, we will quietly and without protest, withdraw, and, in that\r\n     case, not be gone half an hour.\" I turned and invited one lady,\r\n     now on this platform, as gentle and lady-like as woman can be,\r\n     Caroline M. Severance, of your own city, to go with me. She said:\r\n     \"I am quite willing to go, both in compliance with your wish, and\r\n     from interest in the cause itself. But I am not a delegate, and I\r\n     have in this city venerated grandparents, whose feelings I\r\n     greatly regard, and would not willingly or unnecessarily wound;\r\n     so that I prefer to go in quietly, but take no active part in\r\n     what will seem to them an antagonistic position for woman, and\r\n     uncalled for on my part. In that way I am quite ready to go.\" And\r\n     so we went out from our own meeting, Mr. Phillips, Mrs. S., and\r\n     myself; none others went with us, nor knew we were going.\r\n\r\n     After arriving at Metropolitan Hall, accompanied by these\r\n     friends, I did quietly what we had predetermined was the best to\r\n     do. The Secretary was sitting upon the platform. I handed him my\r\n     credentials from both societies. He said: \"I can not now tell\r\n     whether you will be received or not. There is a resolution before\r\n     the house, stating, in substance, that they would receive all\r\n     delegates without distinction of color or sex. If this\r\n     resolution is adopted, you can be received.\" I then left my\r\n     credentials in his hands, and went down from the platform. It was\r\n     rather trying, in the sight of all that audience, to go upon the\r\n     platform and come down again; and I shall not soon forget the\r\n     sensations with which I stepped off the platform. After a little\r\n     time they decided that the call admitted all delegates. I thought\r\n     this decision settled my admission, and I went again upon the\r\n     platform. In the meantime a permanent organization was effected.\r\n     I went there, for the purpose of thanking them for their course,\r\n     and merely to express my sympathy with the cause and their\r\n     present movement, and then intended to leave the Hall. I arose,\r\n     and inquired of the President, Neal Dow, if I was rightly a\r\n     member of the Convention. He said, \"Yes, if you have credentials\r\n     from any abstinence societies.\" I told him I had, and then\r\n     attempted to thank him. There was no appeal from the President's\r\n     decision, but yet they would not receive my expression of thanks;\r\n     therefore I took my seat and waited for a better opportunity.\r\n\r\n     And now let me read a paragraph again from this paper, the\r\n     temperance organ of your State. The writer is still Gen. Carey.\r\n     (The extract intimated that Miss Brown, supported and urged on by\r\n     several others, made an unwomanly entrance into the Convention,\r\n     and upon the platform itself, which was reserved for officers,\r\n     and as it would imply, already filled). There were only the two\r\n     other persons I mentioned who went with me to that Convention,\r\n     but they took their seats back among the audience, and did not\r\n     approach the platform. There were friends I found in that\r\n     audience to sustain me, but none others came with me for that\r\n     purpose. The platform was far from being full; it is a large\r\n     platform, and there might a hundred persons sit there, and not\r\n     incommode each other at all.\r\n\r\n     (Here Miss Brown read another extract from the same article, in\r\n     which Gen. Carey implies, that concerted measures had been set on\r\n     foot at the Woman's Rights meeting at the Tabernacle, the evening\r\n     after Miss Brown's first attempt at a hearing before the\r\n     Temperance Convention, for coming in upon them again _en masse_,\r\n     and revengefully).\r\n\r\n     Not a word was said that night upon the subject in the Convention\r\n     at the Tabernacle, except what was said by myself; and I said\r\n     what I did, because some one inquired whether I was hissed on\r\n     going upon the platform. As to that matter, when I went upon the\r\n     platform I was not hissed, at others times I did not know whether\r\n     they hissed me or others, and\r\n\r\n          \"Where ignorance is bliss,'tis folly to be wise.\"\r\n\r\n     I stated some of the facts to our own Convention, but I did not\r\n     refer to this resolution (the one which was to exclude all but\r\n     officers or invited guests from the platform), for I was not\r\n     entirely clear with regard to the nature of it, it was passed in\r\n     so much confusion. I did state this, that there had been a\r\n     discussion raised upon such a resolution, and that it was decided\r\n     that only officers and invited guests should sit upon the\r\n     platform; but that they had received me as a delegate, and had\r\n     thus revoked the action of the Brick Chapel meeting, and that on\r\n     the morrow Neal Dow might invite me to sit upon the platform.\r\n     That was the substance of my remarks, and not one word of\r\n     objection was taken, or reply made by our Convention.\r\n\r\n     I read again from this paper. (An extract implying that among the\r\n     measures taken to browbeat the Convention into receiving Miss\r\n     Brown, was the forming of a society instantly, under the special\r\n     urgency of herself and friends, for this especial object, etc.)\r\n     That again is a statement without foundation. I intend to-night\r\n     to use no harsh words, and I shall say nothing with regard to\r\n     motives. You may draw your own conclusions in regard to all this.\r\n     I shall state dispassionately, the simple, literal facts as they\r\n     occurred, and they may speak for themselves.\r\n\r\n     When Wendell Phillips went out of the Convention, he told persons\r\n     with whom he came in contact, that a delegate had been received\r\n     by the President, and that delegate had been insulted, and nobody\r\n     had risen to sustain her. He said to me, too, \"I shall not go\r\n     to-morrow, but do you go. I can do nothing for you, because I am\r\n     not a delegate.\" There were a few earnest friends in New York,\r\n     however, who felt that the rights of a delegate were sacred. They\r\n     organized a society and appointed just three delegates to that\r\n     Temperance Convention. Those three persons were Wendell Phillips,\r\n     of Boston; Mr. Cleveland, one of the editors of the Tribune; and\r\n     Mr. Gibbon, son-in-law of the late venerated Isaac T. Hopper. The\r\n     last two were men from New York City. The question was already\r\n     decided that women might be received as delegates to that\r\n     Convention; therefore there was no need of appointing any one to\r\n     insist upon woman's right to appear, and no one was appointed for\r\n     that purpose.\r\n\r\n     The next morning we went there with Mr. Phillips, who presented\r\n     his credentials. During the discussion, Mr. Phillips took part,\r\n     and persisted in holding the Convention to parliamentary rules.\r\n     He carried in his hand a book of rules, which is received\r\n     everywhere as authority, and when he saw that they were wrong, he\r\n     quoted the standard authority to them. After a while the\r\n     preliminary business was disposed of, and various resolutions\r\n     were brought forward. I arose, and the President said I had the\r\n     floor. I was invited upon the stand, and was therefore an\r\n     \"invited guest\" within their own rules; but when once there, I\r\n     was not allowed to speak, although the President said repeatedly\r\n     that the floor was mine. The opposition arose from a dozen or\r\n     more around the platform, who were incessantly raising \"points of\r\n     order\"--the extempore bantlings of great minds in great\r\n     emergencies. For the space of three hours I endeavored to be\r\n     heard, but they would not hear me (although as a delegate, and I\r\n     spoke simply as a delegate), I could have spoken but ten minutes\r\n     by a law of the house. Twice the President was sustained in his\r\n     decision by the house; but finally some one insisted that there\r\n     might be persons voting in the house who were not delegates, and\r\n     it was decided that the Hall should be cleared by the police, and\r\n     that those who were delegates might come in, one by one, and\r\n     resume their seats.\r\n\r\n     There were printed lists of the delegates of the Convention, but\r\n     there were several new delegates whose names were not on the\r\n     lists. Wendell Phillips and his colleagues were among them. He\r\n     went to the President and said: \"I rely upon you to be admitted\r\n     to the Hall, for we know that our names are not yet on the list.\"\r\n     The President assented. As the delegates returned, the names\r\n     upon the printed lists were called, and while the rest of us were\r\n     earnest to be admitted to the house, and while they were\r\n     examining our credentials and deciding whether or not we should\r\n     be received, Neal Dow had gone out of the Hall, and Gen. Carey\r\n     had taken the Chair! The action of a part of the delegates who\r\n     were in the house while the other part were shut out, was like to\r\n     nothing that ever had occurred in the annals of parliamentary\r\n     history. Those persons who came in afterward, asked what was the\r\n     business before the house, and on being informed, moved that it\r\n     be reconsidered. The President decided upon putting it to the\r\n     house, that they had not voted in the affirmative, and would not\r\n     reconsider. Gen. Samuel F. Carey is a man of firmness, and I\r\n     could not but admire the firmness with which he presided,\r\n     although I felt that his decisions were wrong. \"Gentlemen,\" said\r\n     he, \"there can be no order when you are raising so many points of\r\n     order; take your seats!\" and they took their seats.\r\n\r\n     Previous to the adjournment, a question was raised about Wendell\r\n     Phillips' credentials, and again next morning they raised it and\r\n     decided it against him, so that he felt all further effort vain,\r\n     and left the Hall. After this, there came up a multitude of\r\n     resolutions, which were passed so rapidly that no one could get\r\n     the opportunity of speaking to them. A resolution also written by\r\n     Gen. Carey, was presented by him, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the common usages have excluded women from the\r\n     public platform,\" etc.\r\n\r\n     That resolution, amid great confusion, was declared as passed. Of\r\n     course, then soon after, I left the Hall. I ought to say, in\r\n     regard to Mr. Phillips' credentials, that they had been referred\r\n     to a committee, who decided that he had not properly been sent to\r\n     the Convention, for no reason in the world, but because the\r\n     society who sent him, had been organized only the night before;\r\n     while I know positively, and others knew, that there were\r\n     societies organized one week before, for the very purpose of\r\n     sending delegates to that Convention; which societies will never\r\n     be heard of again, I fear. But the Neal Dow Association, of New\r\n     York, exists yet. Their society shall not die; so good comes out\r\n     of evil often.\r\n\r\n     A motion was also made by some one, as better justice to Mr.\r\n     Phillips, to refer the credentials of all the delegates of\r\n     Massachusetts to the Committee on Credentials, but for very\r\n     obvious and prudent reasons, it was not suffered to have a\r\n     moment's hearing or consideration. (Miss Brown here read a few\r\n     additional lines from the same article, asserting that she was\r\n     merely the tool of others, and thrust by them upon the platform;\r\n     and charging all the disorder and disturbance of that Convention\r\n     to herself and friends, etc.) I needed no thrusting upon the\r\n     platform. I was able to rise and speak without urging or\r\n     suggestion. And as to the disorder which prevailed throughout the\r\n     Convention, who made that disorder? I said not a word to cause\r\n     it, for they gave me no opportunity to say a word, and the other\r\n     delegates with me, sat quietly. No mention is made in this paper\r\n     that I had credentials. It is stated that throughout Ohio the\r\n     impression is that I had none; and it is generally believed that\r\n     I went there without proper credentials.\r\n\r\n     One word more as to Mr. Carey. He says, \"The negro question was\r\n     not discussed as Greeley & Co. wished it to be. O Greeley, how\r\n     art thou fallen!\" These are Gen. Carey's words, not mine. Mr.\r\n     Greeley has risen greatly in my estimation, and not fallen. A\r\n     colored delegate[18] did take his credentials to the Convention,\r\n     but he was not received. I saw him myself, and asked him what\r\n     could be done about it. He folded up his hands and said it was\r\n     too late. And this was a \"World's Temperance Convention!\"\r\n\r\n     And this paper says that the _New York Tribune_, which has\r\n     usually been an accredited sheet, has most shamefully\r\n     misrepresented the whole affair, and refers to what was said in\r\n     the _Tribune_, as to what the Convention had accomplished: \"The\r\n     first day, crowding a woman from the platform; second day,\r\n     gagging her; and the third day voting she should stay gagged;\"\r\n     and asserts that it is a misrepresentation.\r\n\r\n     The evenings of that Convention were not devoted to this\r\n     discussion, and wore not noisy or fruitless. There were burning\r\n     words spoken for temperance during the evenings; but whether the\r\n     _Tribune's_ report of the day-sessions be correct or not, you\r\n     yourselves can be the judges. I must say, however, the _Tribune_\r\n     did not misrepresent that affair in its regular report; and I\r\n     call upon Gen. Carey, in all kindness and courtesy; to point out\r\n     just what the misstatements are--and upon any one acquainted with\r\n     the facts, to show the false statement, if it can be shown.\r\n\r\n     And now I leave the action of the Convention to say what were our\r\n     motives in going there. From what I have related of the\r\n     circumstances which conspired to induce us to go, and the manner\r\n     of our going, you can but see that no absurd desire for\r\n     notoriety, no coveting of such unenviable fame as we know must\r\n     await us, were the inducements. And as a simple fact, there was\r\n     nothing so very important in a feeble woman's going as a delegate\r\n     to that Convention; but the fact was made an unpleasant one in\r\n     the experience of that delegate, and was blown into notoriety by\r\n     the unmanly action of that Convention itself. But what were our\r\n     reasons for going to that Convention? Did we go there to forward\r\n     the cause of Temperance or to forward the cause of woman, or what\r\n     were our motives in going? Woman was pleading her own cause in\r\n     the Convention at the Tabernacle, and she had no need that any\r\n     should go there to forward her cause for her; and much as I love\r\n     temperance, and love those poor sisters who suffer because of\r\n     intemperance, it was not especially to plead their cause that I\r\n     went there. I went to assert a principle, a principle relevant to\r\n     the circumstances of the World's Convention to be sure, but one,\r\n     at the same time, which, acknowledged, must forward all good\r\n     causes, and, disregarded, must retard them. I went there, asking\r\n     no favor as a woman, asking no special recognition of the\r\n     woman-cause. I went there in behalf of the cause of humanity. I\r\n     went there, asking the indorsement of no ism, and as the exponent\r\n     of no measure, but as a simple item of the world in the name of\r\n     the world, claiming that all the sons and daughters of the race\r\n     should be received in that Convention, if they went there with\r\n     the proper credentials. I simply planted my feet upon the rights\r\n     of a delegate. I asked for nothing more, and dare take nothing\r\n     less. The principle which we were there to assert, was that which\r\n     is the soul of the Golden Rule, the soul of that which says, \"All\r\n     things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye\r\n     even so unto them.\" I went there to see if they would be true to\r\n     their own call, and recognize delegates without distinction of\r\n     color, sex, creed, party, or condition; to see if they would\r\n     recognize each member of the human family, as belonging to the\r\n     human family; to see if they would grant the simple rights of a\r\n     delegate to all delegates.\r\n\r\n     And do you ask, did this not retard the cause of Temperance? No;\r\n     it carried it forward, as it carries every good cause forward. It\r\n     awakened thought, and mankind need only to be aroused to thought,\r\n     to forever destroy all wrong customs, and among them the rum\r\n     traffic. They need only to think to the purpose, and when this\r\n     shall be done, all good causes are bound to go forward together.\r\n     Christianity is the heart and soul of them all, and those reforms\r\n     which seek to elevate mankind and better their condition, cling\r\n     around our Christianity, and are a part of it. They are like the\r\n     cluster of grapes, all clinging about the central stem.\r\n\r\n     A wrong was done in that Convention to a delegate, and many\r\n     people saw and felt that wrong, and they began to inquire for the\r\n     cause of it; and so the causes of things were searched more\r\n     nearly than before, and this was a good which promoted\r\n     temperance. It is absurd to believe that any man or woman is any\r\n     less a temperance man or woman, or a \"Maine law\" man or woman\r\n     now, than before. If ever they loved that cause they love it now\r\n     as before.\r\n\r\n     Water is the very symbol of democracy! a single jet of it in a\r\n     tube will balance the whole ocean. We went there, only to claim\r\n     in the name of Democracy and Christianity, that all be treated\r\n     alike and impartially. The human soul is a holy thing; it is the\r\n     temple of living joy or sorrow. It is freighted with vital\r\n     realities. It can outlengthen Heaven itself, and it should be\r\n     reverenced everywhere, and treated always as a holy thing. We\r\n     only went there in the name of the world, in the name of\r\n     humanity, to promote a good cause; and it is what I pledge myself\r\n     now anew to do, at all times and under all circumstances, when\r\n     the opportunity shall present itself to me. It was a good act, a\r\n     Christian duty, to go there under those circumstances.\r\n\r\n     But let me now leave this matter, and say something which may\r\n     have a direct bearing upon the circumstances of our Convention,\r\n     and show why it is proper to bring up these facts here. Let us\r\n     suppose ourselves gathered in Metropolitan Hall. It is a large\r\n     hall, with two galleries around its sides. I could see men up\r\n     there in checked blouses, who looked as though they might disturb\r\n     a Convention, but they looked down upon the rowdyism of the\r\n     platform, a thing unprecedented before, with simple expressions\r\n     of wonder, while they were quiet. Well, here we are upon the\r\n     platform. The President is speaking.\r\n\r\n     PRESIDENT: \"Miss Brown has the floor.\"\r\n\r\n     A DELEGATE: \"Mr. President, I rise to a point of order.\"\r\n\r\n     PRESIDENT: \"State your point of order.\"\r\n\r\n     It is stated, but at the same time, in the general whirl and\r\n     confusion all around, another voice from the floor exclaims: \"I\r\n     rise to a point of order!\"\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT: \"State it!\"\r\n\r\n     But while these things are going on, a voice arises, \"She sha'n't\r\n     speak!\" another, \"She sha'n't be heard!\" another, \"You raise a\r\n     point of order when he is done, and I will raise another.\" In the\r\n     confusion I hear something almost like swearing, but not\r\n     swearing, for most of those men are \"holy men,\" who do not think\r\n     of swearing. The confusion continues. Most of this time I am\r\n     standing, but presently a chair is presented me, and now a new\r\n     class of comforters gathers around me, speaking smooth, consoling\r\n     words in my ear while upon the other side are angry disputants,\r\n     clinching their fists and growing red in the face. Are the former\r\n     good Samaritans, pouring into my wounded heart the oil and the\r\n     wine? Listen. \"I know you are acting conscientiously; but now\r\n     that you have made your protest, do, for your own sake, withdraw\r\n     from this disgraceful scene.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I can not withdraw,\" I say; \"it is not now the time to withdraw;\r\n     here is a principle at stake.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Well, in what way can you better the cause? Do you feel you are\r\n     doing any good?\" Another voice chimes in with: \"Do you love the\r\n     Temperance cause? Can you continue here and see all this\r\n     confusion prevailing around you? Why not withdraw, and then the\r\n     Convention will be quiet;\" and all this in most mournful,\r\n     dolorous tones. I think if the man cries, I shall certainly cry\r\n     too.\r\n\r\n     But then a new interval of quiet occurs, and so I rise to get the\r\n     floor. I fancy myself in a melting mood enough to beg them, with\r\n     prayers and tears, to be just and righteous; but no, \"this kind\r\n     goeth not out by prayer and fasting,\" and so I stand up again.\r\n     Directly Rev. John Chambers points his finger at me, and calls\r\n     aloud: \"Shame on the woman! Shame on the woman!\" Then I feel cool\r\n     and calm enough again, and sit down until his anger has way.\r\n     Again the \"friends\" gather around me, and there come more appeals\r\n     to me, while the public ear is filled with \"points of order\"; and\r\n     the two fall together, in a somewhat odd, but very pointed\r\n     contrast, somewhere in the center of my brain. \"Do you think,\"\r\n     says one, \"that Christ would have done so?\" spoken with a\r\n     somewhat negative emphasis. \"I think He would,\" spoken with a\r\n     positive emphasis. \"Do you love peace as well as Christ loved it,\r\n     and can you do thus?\"\r\n\r\n     What answer I made I know not, but there came rushing over my\r\n     soul the words of Christ: \"I came not to send peace, but a\r\n     sword.\" It seems almost to be spoken with an audible voice, and\r\n     it sways the spirit more than all things else. I remember that\r\n     Christ's doctrine was, \"first pure, then peaceable;\" that He,\r\n     too, was persecuted. So are my doctrines good; they ask only for\r\n     the simple rights of a delegate, only that which must be\r\n     recognized as just, by the impartial Father of the human race,\r\n     and by His holy Son. Then come these mock pleading tones again\r\n     upon my ear, and instinctively I think of the Judas kiss, and I\r\n     arise, turning away from them all, and feeling a power which may,\r\n     perhaps, never come to me again. There were angry men confronting\r\n     me, and I caught the flashing of defiant eyes; but above me, and\r\n     within me, and all around me, there was a spirit stronger than\r\n     they all. At that moment not the combined powers of earth and\r\n     hell could have tempted me to do otherwise than to stand firm.\r\n     Moral and physical cowardice were subdued, thanks to that\r\n     Washington delegate for the sublime strength roused by his\r\n     question: \"Would Christ have done so?\"\r\n\r\n     That stormy scene is passed; that memorable time when chivalrous\r\n     men forgot the deference, which according to their creed is due\r\n     to woman, and forgot it as they publicly said, because a woman\r\n     claimed a right upon the platform; and so they neither recognized\r\n     her equality of rights, nor her conceded courtesy as a lady. This\r\n     was neither just nor gallant, but to me it was vastly preferable\r\n     to those appeals made to me as a lady--appeals which never would\r\n     have been made to a man under the same circumstances; and which\r\n     only served to show me the estimation in which they held\r\n     womanhood. It reminded me of a remark which was made concerning\r\n     the Brick Chapel meeting: \"If you had spoken words of flattery,\r\n     they would have done what you wanted.\"\r\n\r\n     Let the past be the past. \"Let the dead bury their dead,\"\r\n     contains truths we well may heed. Is God the impartial Father of\r\n     humanity? Is He no respecter of persons? Is it true that there is\r\n     known neither male nor female in Christ Jesus? In my heart of\r\n     hearts, I believe it is all true. I believe it is the foundation\r\n     of the Golden Rule. And now let me tell you in conclusion: if it\r\n     be true, this truth shall steal into your souls like the accents\r\n     of childhood; it shall come like a bright vision of hope to the\r\n     desponding; it shall flash upon the incredulous; it shall twine\r\n     like a chain of golden arguments about the reason of the skeptic.\r\n\r\n     WM. LLOYD GARRISON, having listened to the narration of the\r\n     action of the World's Convention in New York, said: I rise to\r\n     offer some resolutions by which the sense of this Convention may\r\n     be obtained. I happened to be an eyewitness of these proceedings,\r\n     and I bear witness to the accuracy of the account given us this\r\n     evening by Miss Brown. I have seen many tumultuous meetings in my\r\n     day, but I think on no occasion have I ever seen anything more\r\n     disgraceful to our common humanity, than when Miss Brown\r\n     attempted to speak upon the platform of the World's Temperance\r\n     Convention in aid of the glorious cause which had brought that\r\n     Convention together. It was an outbreak of passion, contempt,\r\n     indignation, and every vile emotion of the soul, throwing into\r\n     the shade almost everything coming from the vilest of the vile,\r\n     that I have ever witnessed on any occasion or under any\r\n     circumstances; venerable men, claiming to be holy men, the\r\n     ambassadors of Jesus Christ, losing all self-respect and\r\n     transforming themselves into the most unmannerly and violent\r\n     spirits, merely on account of the sex of the individual who\r\n     wished to address the assembly.\r\n\r\n     Miss Brown was asked while standing on the platform, \"Do you love\r\n     the temperance cause?\" What could have been more insulting than\r\n     such a question as that at that moment? What but the temperance\r\n     cause had brought her to the Convention? Why had she been\r\n     delegated to take her seat in that body except on the ground that\r\n     she was a devoted friend of the temperance enterprise, and had an\r\n     interest in every movement pertaining to the total abstinence\r\n     cause? She had been delegated there by total abstinence societies\r\n     because of her fitness as a temperance woman to advocate the\r\n     temperance cause, so dear to the hearts of all those who love\r\n     perishing humanity. Was it the love of the temperance cause that\r\n     raised the outcry against her? or was it not simply contempt of\r\n     woman, and an unwillingness that she should stand up anywhere to\r\n     bear her testimony against popular wrongs and crimes, the curses\r\n     of the race?\r\n\r\n     MISS BROWN: Allow me to state one incident. A Doctor of Divinity\r\n     was present at the meeting. His son and daughter-in-law stated to\r\n     me the fact. \"I said to my father, you had stormy times at the\r\n     Convention to-day.\" \"Yes,\" said the father, \"stormy times.\" Said\r\n     the son, \"Why didn't you allow her to speak?\" \"Ah,\" said the\r\n     Doctor, \"it was the principle of the thing!\" But it so happened\r\n     that the son and daughter thought the principle a wrong one.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Garrison: Yes, it was the principle that was at stake. It was\r\n     not simply the making of a speech at that Convention, by a woman.\r\n     By her speaking something more was implied, for if woman could\r\n     speak there and for that object, she might speak elsewhere for\r\n     another object, and she might, peradventure, as my friend does,\r\n     proceed to occupy a pulpit and settle over a congregation. In\r\n     fact, there is no knowing where the precedent would lead;\r\n     reminding me of the man who hesitated to leave off his profanity,\r\n     because having left that off he should have to leave off\r\n     drinking, and if he left off drinking he should have to leave off\r\n     his tobacco and other vile habits. He liked symmetry of\r\n     character, and so he was unwilling to take the first step toward\r\n     reform.\r\n\r\n     The principle for which Miss Brown contended, was this: every\r\n     society has a right to determine who shall represent it in\r\n     convention. Invitation was given to the \"whole world\" to meet\r\n     there in convention, to promote the cause of Temperance. Our\r\n     friend needed no credentials under the call. It is true all\r\n     societies were invited to send delegates, but in addition to that\r\n     all the friends of Temperance throughout the world were expressly\r\n     and earnestly invited to be present, and under that last express\r\n     invitation she had a right to come in as an earnest friend of the\r\n     cause, and take her seat in the Convention. When a body like that\r\n     comes together, the principle is this, each delegate stands on\r\n     the same footing as every other delegate, and no one delegate nor\r\n     any number of delegates has a right to exclude any other delegate\r\n     who has been sent there by any like society. Our friend had\r\n     credentials from two societies, and thus was doubly armed; but\r\n     she was put down by a most disgraceful minority of the\r\n     Convention, who succeeded in carrying their point. In view of all\r\n     this, I would present for the action of this Convention the\r\n     following resolutions:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, a cordial invitation having been extended to all\r\n     temperance societies and all the friends of temperance throughout\r\n     the world, to meet personally or by delegates in a \"World's\r\n     Temperance Convention\" in the city of New York, Sept. 6th and\r\n     7th, 1853;\r\n\r\n     And whereas, accepting this invitation in the spirit in which it\r\n     was apparently given, the \"South Butler Temperance Association,\"\r\n     and the \"Rochester Toronto Division of the Sons of Temperance,\"\r\n     duly empowered the Rev. Antoinette L. Brown, to act in that\r\n     Convention as their delegate, representative, and advocate.\r\n\r\n     And whereas, on presenting herself at the time specified, her\r\n     credentials were received by the Committee on the roll of the\r\n     Convention, but on rising to address the assembly (though\r\n     declared by the President to be entitled to the floor, and\r\n     although his decision was repeatedly sustained by a majority of\r\n     the delegates) she was met with derisive outcries, insulting\r\n     jeers, and the most rowdyish manifestations, by a shameless\r\n     minority, led on by the Rev. John Chambers, of Philadelphia, and\r\n     encouraged by Gen. Carey, of Ohio, and other professed friends of\r\n     the temperance cause--so as to make it impossible for her to be\r\n     heard, and thus virtually excluding her from the Convention in an\r\n     ignominious manner, solely on account of her being a woman;\r\n     therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That in the judgment of this Convention, the\r\n     treatment received by the Rev. Antoinette L. Brown in the\r\n     \"World's Temperance Convention\" (falsely so called) was in the\r\n     highest degree disgraceful to that body, insulting to the\r\n     societies whose credentials she bore, worthy only of those who\r\n     are filled with strong drink, and a scandal to the temperance\r\n     movement.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the thanks of this Convention be given to Miss\r\n     Brown, for having accepted the credentials so honorably proffered\r\n     to her by the temperance societies aforesaid, and claiming a\r\n     right, not as a woman, but as a duly authorized delegate, an\r\n     eloquent and devoted advocate of the temperance enterprise, to a\r\n     seat and voice in the \"World's Temperance Convention;\" and for\r\n     the firm, dignified, and admirable manner in which she met the\r\n     storm of opprobrium and insult which so furiously assailed her on\r\n     her attempting to advocate the beneficent movement for the\r\n     promotion of which the Convention was expressly called together.\r\n\r\n     Hon. JOSHUA R. GIDDINGS: Ladies and gentlemen, although I had\r\n     designed to take no active part in the proceedings, I can not\r\n     avoid rising, to second that resolution. When I learned of the\r\n     appointing of this Convention, it brought a thrill of joy to me.\r\n     I had read the transactions to which the lady has made such\r\n     feeling allusion. I had read and mourned over them, and I\r\n     rejoiced that an opportunity was to be given to the people of\r\n     Cleveland, and this Western Reserve, to tender their thanks to\r\n     this Convention, which had been appointed to meet upon the shores\r\n     of Lake Erie; and that they also might see what sort of a\r\n     greeting the friends of the rights of woman would receive here.\r\n     And I now rejoice at the hearty manner in which the Convention\r\n     has proceeded. I rejoice at the treatment the Convention has\r\n     received. Then I was about to say, the fogies of New York, if\r\n     they could see and know all that they might see here, would not\r\n     be like some spirits, whom Swedenborg says he saw in the other\r\n     world. He found spirits who had been departed several years, who\r\n     had not yet learned that they were dead. I think Rev. John\r\n     Chambers would now look down and begin to suspect that he had\r\n     departed.\r\n\r\n     My friends, I know not how the remarks of Miss Brown fell upon\r\n     your ears. I can only say that they struck me with deep feelings\r\n     of mortification, that at this noontide of the nineteenth century\r\n     any human being, who can give her thoughts to an assembly in the\r\n     eloquent manner in which she has spoken to us, has been treated\r\n     as she was; and when this resolution of reproof by my friend from\r\n     Massachusetts was presented, I resolved to rise and second it,\r\n     and express myself willing that it be sent out in the report,\r\n     that I most heartily concur in the expressions contained in these\r\n     resolutions.\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM L. GARRISON: I wish to make one statement in regard to\r\n     General Carey, to show that he does not himself act on consistent\r\n     principles, in this matter. The last number of the _Pennsylvania\r\n     Freeman_ contains an account of a temperance gathering held in\r\n     Kennett Square. That square is for that region the headquarters\r\n     of Abolitionists, Liberals, Come-outers, and so forth. In that\r\n     meeting women were appointed for Vice-Presidents and Secretaries\r\n     with men, and there was a complete mixture throughout the\r\n     committees without regard to sex; and who do you think were those\r\n     who spoke on that occasion recognizing that woman was equal with\r\n     man in that gathering? The first was G. W. Jackson, of Boston,\r\n     who made himself very conspicuous in the exclusion of women from\r\n     the \"World's Convention\"; second, Judge O'Neil, of South\r\n     Carolina, who spoke at New York, and who was also very active in\r\n     the efforts to exclude Miss Brown; last of all was General Carey,\r\n     of Ohio; and three days afterward they wended their way to New\r\n     York, and there conspired with others to prevent a delegate from\r\n     being admitted, on the ground of being a woman; showing that\r\n     while at old Kennett they were willing to conform, finding it\r\n     would be popular; in New York they joined in this brutal\r\n     proscription of a woman, only because she was a woman.\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE: I know it is time to take the question upon these\r\n     resolutions, but I wish to say one word. When a world's\r\n     convention of any kind is called--when the Rev. Drs. Chambers,\r\n     Hewett, Marsh, and I don't know how many more, backed up by a\r\n     part of those who were in that convention, are ready to ignore\r\n     the existence of woman, it should show us something of the amount\r\n     of labor we have to do, to teach the world even to know that we\r\n     are a part of it; and when women tell us they don't want any more\r\n     rights, I want them to know that they are held to have no right\r\n     in any world's convention. I took up a book the other day,\r\n     written by the Rev. Mr. Davis, in which he sketches the events of\r\n     the last fifty years. He states that the Sandwich Islands at one\r\n     time had one missionary at such a station; Mr. Green--and his\r\n     wife! Then he went on to state another where there were nineteen,\r\n     and--their wives! Now these are straws on the surface, but they\r\n     indicate \"which way the wind blows,\" and indicate, in some sense,\r\n     the estimation in which woman is held. I mention these facts so\r\n     that we may see something of the length of the way we must tread,\r\n     before we shall even be recognized.\r\n\r\nThe reader will see from these debates the amount of prejudice,\r\nwickedness, and violence, woman was compelled to meet from all classes\r\nof men, especially the clergy, in those early days, and on the other\r\nhand the wisdom, courage, and mild self-assertion with which she\r\nfought her battle and conquered. There is not a man living who took\r\npart in that disgraceful row who would not gladly blot out that page\r\nin his personal history. But the few noble men--lawyers, statesmen,\r\nclergymen, philanthropists, poets, orators, philosophers--who have\r\nremained steadfast and loyal to woman through all her struggles for\r\nfreedom--have been brave and generous enough to redeem their sex from\r\nthe utter contempt and distrust of all womankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL CONVENTION AT CINCINNATI, OHIO.\r\n\r\nIn 1855, October 17th and 18th, the people of Cincinnati, Ohio, were\r\nsummoned to the consideration of the question of Woman's Rights. A\r\nbrief report in the city journals, is all we can find of the\r\nproceedings. From these we learn that the meetings were held in\r\nNixon's Hall, that some ladies wore bloomers, and some gentlemen\r\nshawls, that the audiences were large and enthusiastic, that the\r\ncuriosity to see women who could make a speech was intense. Martha C.\r\nWright, of Auburn, a sister of Lucretia Mott, was chosen President. On\r\nthe platform sat Mrs. Mott, Hannah Tracy Cutler, Josephine S.\r\nGriffing, Mary S. Anthony, of Rochester, N. Y.; Ernestine L. Rose,\r\nAdeline Swift, Joseph Barker, an Englishman, an ex-member of\r\nParliament, Lucy Stone and her husband, Henry B. Blackwell, recently\r\nmarried. Mrs. Stone did not take her husband's name, because she\r\nbelieved a woman had a right to an individual existence, and an\r\nindividual name to designate that existence.\r\n\r\nAfter the election of officers,[19] the President stated the object of\r\nthe Convention to be to secure equality with man in social, civil, and\r\npolitical rights. It was only seven years, she said, since this\r\nmovement commenced, since our first Convention was called, in timidity\r\nand doubt of our own strength, our own capacity, our own powers; now,\r\neast, west, north, and even south, there were found advocates of\r\nwoman's rights. The newspapers which ridiculed and slandered us at\r\nfirst, are beginning to give impartial accounts of our meetings.\r\nNewspapers do not lead, but follow public opinion; and doing so, they\r\ngo through three stages in regard to reforms; they first ridicule\r\nthem, then report them without comment, and at last openly advocate\r\nthem. We seem to be still in the first stage on this question.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. CUTLER said: \"Let there be light, and there was light,\" \"And\r\n     many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.\"\r\n     This light, this increase of knowledge, we are seeking. Men have\r\n     always applied the last text to themselves, and did not expect\r\n     woman to run to and fro and increase in knowledge. They objected\r\n     to her raising her voice on this platform in the pursuit or\r\n     diffusion of knowledge; but when she is employed upon the stage\r\n     to minister to everything that pollutes and degrades man, no\r\n     voice was raised against it. It was but a few years ago that a\r\n     French queen brought over with her to the British Isles, a male\r\n     mantua-maker. It was not supposed then that woman was capable of\r\n     fitting woman's clothes properly. She has since advanced to have\r\n     the charge of man's wardrobe; and it will be right when the time\r\n     comes, for man to take care of himself. Conservatism opposes this\r\n     now; but I love conservatism; it is guarding our institutions\r\n     until the new mother is prepared to take the charge.\r\n\r\n     I desire that marriage shall not be simply a domestic union as in\r\n     early days, or a social one as it has now become, but a complete\r\n     and perfect union, conferring equal rights on both parties. I\r\n     desire light from the source of light. The question is frequently\r\n     asked, \"What more do these women want?\" A lady in Cincinnati told\r\n     me that she did not desire any change, for she thought we had now\r\n     entirely the best of it; while the men toiled in their shops and\r\n     offices, the women walked the streets splendidly dressed, or\r\n     lounged at home with nothing to do but spend the money their\r\n     husbands earned. I never understood the elevating effect of the\r\n     elective franchise until I went to England, where so few enjoy\r\n     it. I attended a political meeting during the canvass of Derby,\r\n     as a reporter for three or four political papers in the United\r\n     States. One of the candidates proposed to legislate for universal\r\n     suffrage; his opponent replied by showing the effect of it upon\r\n     France, which he declared was the only country in which it\r\n     existed. \"You forget,\" exclaimed one, \"America!\" \"America! never\r\n     name her! a land of three millions of slaves.\" The multitude\r\n     would not believe this; they shouted in derision, whenever the\r\n     speaker attempted to resume. America was their last hope. If that\r\n     country was given up to slavery, they could only despair. Party\r\n     leaders rose and tried to calm them as Christ calmed the sea, but\r\n     they could do nothing. \"You are an American,\" said one near me;\r\n     \"get up and defend your country!\" What could I say? I spoke,\r\n     however, and pledged them that the stain of slavery should be\r\n     wiped out.\r\n\r\n     Mr. WISE, of North Carolina, made a long and learned address,\r\n     treating principally of geology and women. He claimed for woman\r\n     more even than she for herself. He said: \"Women are generally\r\n     more competent to vote than their husbands, and sisters better\r\n     fitted to be judges than their brothers, the mother more capable\r\n     of wisely exercising the elective franchise than her booby son.\"\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE said: The last speaker alluded to this movement as\r\n     being that of a few disappointed women. From the first years to\r\n     which my memory stretches, I have been a disappointed woman.\r\n     When, with my brothers, I reached forth after the sources of\r\n     knowledge, I was reproved with \"It isn't fit for you; it doesn't\r\n     belong to women.\" Then there was but one college in the world\r\n     where women were admitted, and that was in Brazil. I would have\r\n     found my way there, but by the time I was prepared to go, one was\r\n     opened in the young State of Ohio--the first in the United States\r\n     where women and negroes could enjoy opportunities with white men.\r\n     I was disappointed when I came to seek a profession worthy an\r\n     immortal being--every employment was closed to me, except those\r\n     of the teacher, the seamstress, and the housekeeper. In\r\n     education, in marriage, in religion, in everything,\r\n     disappointment is the lot of woman. It shall be the business of\r\n     my life to deepen this disappointment in every woman's heart\r\n     until she bows down to it no longer. I wish that women, instead\r\n     of being walking show-cases, instead of begging of their fathers\r\n     and brothers the latest and gayest new bonnet, would ask of them\r\n     their rights.\r\n\r\n     The question of Woman's Rights is a practical one. The notion has\r\n     prevailed that it was only an ephemeral idea; that it was but\r\n     women claiming the right to smoke cigars in the streets, and to\r\n     frequent bar-rooms. Others have supposed it a question of\r\n     comparative intellect; others still, of sphere. Too much has\r\n     already been said and written about woman's sphere. Trace all the\r\n     doctrines to their source and they will be found to have no basis\r\n     except in the usages and prejudices of the age. This is seen in\r\n     the fact that what is tolerated in woman in one country is not\r\n     tolerated in another. In this country women may hold\r\n     prayer-meetings, etc., but in Mohammedan countries it is written\r\n     upon their mosques, \"Women and dogs, and other impure animals,\r\n     are not permitted to enter.\" Wendell Phillips says, \"The best and\r\n     greatest thing one is capable of doing, that is his sphere.\" I\r\n     have confidence in the Father to believe that when He gives us\r\n     the capacity to do anything He does not make a blunder. Leave\r\n     women, then, to find their sphere. And do not tell us before we\r\n     are born even, that our province is to cook dinners, darn\r\n     stockings, and sew on buttons. We are told woman has all the\r\n     rights she wants; and even women, I am ashamed to say, tell us\r\n     so. They mistake the politeness of men for rights--seats while\r\n     men stand in this hall to-night, and their adulations; but these\r\n     are mere courtesies. We want rights. The flour-merchant, the\r\n     house-builder, and the postman charge us no less on account of\r\n     our sex; but when we endeavor to earn money to pay all these,\r\n     then, indeed, we find the difference. Man, if he have energy, may\r\n     hew out for himself a path where no mortal has ever trod, held\r\n     back by nothing but what is in himself; the world is all before\r\n     him, where to choose; and we are glad for you, brothers, men,\r\n     that it is so. But the same society that drives forth the young\r\n     man, keeps woman at home--a dependent--working little cats on\r\n     worsted, and little dogs on punctured paper; but if she goes\r\n     heartily and bravely to give herself to some worthy purpose, she\r\n     is out of her sphere and she loses caste. Women working in\r\n     tailor-shops are paid one-third as much as men. Some one in\r\n     Philadelphia has stated that women make fine shirts for twelve\r\n     and a half cents apiece; that no woman can make more than nine a\r\n     week, and the sum thus earned, after deducting rent, fuel, etc.,\r\n     leaves her just three and a half cents a day for bread. Is it a\r\n     wonder that women are driven to prostitution? Female teachers in\r\n     New York are paid fifty dollars a year, and for every such\r\n     situation there are five hundred applicants. I know not what you\r\n     believe of God, but I believe He gave yearnings and longings to\r\n     be filled, and that He did not mean all our time should be\r\n     devoted to feeding and clothing the body. The present condition\r\n     of woman causes a horrible perversion of the marriage relation.\r\n     It is asked of a lady, \"Has she married well?\" \"Oh, yes, her\r\n     husband is rich.\" Woman must marry for a home, and you men are\r\n     the sufferers by this; for a woman who loathes you may marry you\r\n     because you have the means to get money which she can not have.\r\n     But when woman can enter the lists with you and make money for\r\n     herself, she will marry you only for deep and earnest affection.\r\n\r\n     I am detaining you too long, many of you standing, that I ought\r\n     to apologize, but women have been wronged so long that I may\r\n     wrong you a little. (Applause). A woman undertook in Lowell to\r\n     sell shoes to ladies. Men laughed at her, but in six years she\r\n     has run them all out, and has a monopoly of the trade. Sarah\r\n     Tyndale, whose husband was an importer of china, and died\r\n     bankrupt, continued his business, paid off his debts, and has\r\n     made a fortune and built the largest china warehouse in the\r\n     world. (Mrs. Mott here corrected Lucy. Mrs. Tyndale has not the\r\n     largest china warehouse, but the largest assortment of china in\r\n     the world). Mrs. Tyndale, herself, drew the plan of her\r\n     warehouse, and it is the best plan ever drawn. A laborer to whom\r\n     the architect showed it, said: \"Don't she know e'en as much as\r\n     some men?\" I have seen a woman at manual labor turning out\r\n     chair-legs in a cabinet-shop, with a dress short enough not to\r\n     drag in the shavings. I wish other women would imitate her in\r\n     this. It made her hands harder and broader, it is true, but I\r\n     think a hand with a dollar and a quarter a day in it, better than\r\n     one with a crossed ninepence. The men in the shop didn't use\r\n     tobacco, nor swear--they can't do those things where there are\r\n     women, and we owe it to our brothers to go wherever they work to\r\n     keep them decent. The widening of woman's sphere is to improve\r\n     her lot. Let us do it, and if the world scoff, let it scoff--if\r\n     it sneer, let it sneer--but we will go on emulating the example\r\n     of the sisters Grimké and Abby Kelly. When they first lectured\r\n     against slavery they were not listened to as respectfully as you\r\n     listen to us. So the first female physician meets many\r\n     difficulties, but to the next the path will be made easy.\r\n\r\n     Lucretia Mott has been a preacher for years; her right to do so\r\n     is not questioned among Friends. But when Antoinette Brown felt\r\n     that she was commanded to preach, and to arrest the progress of\r\n     thousands that were on the road to hell; why, when she applied\r\n     for ordination they acted as though they had rather the whole\r\n     world should go to hell, than that Antoinette Brown should be\r\n     allowed to tell them how to keep out of it. She is now ordained\r\n     over a parish in the State of New York, but when she meets on the\r\n     Temperance platform the Rev. John Chambers, or your own Gen.\r\n     Carey (applause) they greet her with hisses. Theodore Parker\r\n     said: \"The acorn that the school-boy carries in his pocket and\r\n     the squirrel stows in his cheek, has in it the possibility of an\r\n     oak, able to withstand, for ages, the cold winter and the driving\r\n     blast.\" I have seen the acorn men and women, but never the\r\n     perfect oak; all are but abortions. The young mother, when first\r\n     the new-born babe nestles in her bosom, and a heretofore unknown\r\n     love springs up in her heart, finds herself unprepared for this\r\n     new relation in life, and she sends forth the child scarred and\r\n     dwarfed by her own weakness and imbecility, as no stream can rise\r\n     higher than its fountain.\r\n\r\nWe find no report of the speeches of Frances D. Gage, Lydia Ann\r\nJenkins, Ernestine L. Rose, Euphemia Cochrane, of Michigan, nor J.\r\nMitchell, of Missouri, editor of the _St. Louis Intelligencer_, nor of\r\nthe presence of James Mott, whose services were always invaluable on\r\nthe committees for business and resolutions.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, the Legislature of Ohio passed a bill enacting that no\r\nmarried man shall dispose of any personal property without having\r\nfirst obtained the consent of his wife; the wife being empowered in\r\ncase of the violation of such act, to commence a civil suit in her own\r\nname for the recovery of said property; and also that any married\r\nwoman whose husband shall desert her or neglect to provide for his\r\nfamily, shall be entitled to his wages and to those of her minor\r\nchildren. These amendments were warmly recommended by Gov. Salmon P.\r\nChase in his annual message. The Select Committee[20] of the Senate on\r\nthe petition asking the right of suffrage for woman, reported in favor\r\nof the proposed amendment, recommending the adoption of the following\r\nresolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the Judiciary Committee be instructed to report\r\n     to the Senate a bill to submit to the qualified electors at the\r\n     next election for Senators and Representatives an amendment to\r\n     the Constitution, whereby the elective franchise shall be\r\n     extended to the citizens of Ohio without distinction of sex.\r\n\r\nBut the bill was defeated in the Senate by a vote of 44 to 44. The\r\npetition had received 10,000 signatures. We give this able report in\r\nfull.[21]\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of these early Conventions might be read with pride\r\nand satisfaction by the women of Ohio to-day, with all their superior\r\nadvantages of education. Frances D. Gage was a natural orator. Her wit\r\nand pathos always delighted her audiences, and were highly appreciated\r\nby those on the platform. Her off-hand speeches, ready for any\r\noccasion, were exactly complemented by J. Elizabeth Jones, whose\r\ncarefully prepared essays on philosophy, law, and government, would do\r\nhonor to any statesman. Together they were a great power in Ohio. From\r\nthis time Conventions were held annually for several years, the\r\nfriends of woman suffrage being thoroughly organized; J. Elizabeth\r\nJones was made General Agent. In her report of May 16th, 1861, she\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     And through the earnest efforts of Mrs. Robinson, Mrs. Gage, Mrs.\r\n     Wilson, Mrs. Tilden, and many others, the Legislature was\r\n     petitioned from year to year for a redress of legal and political\r\n     wrongs. At a later period, the indefatigable exertions of Mrs.\r\n     Adeline T. Swift sustained the interest and the agitation in such\r\n     portions of the State as she could reach. As the fruit of her\r\n     labor, many thousands of names, pleading for equality, have been\r\n     presented to the General Assembly, which labor has been continued\r\n     to the present time.\r\n\r\n     Our last effort, of which I am now more particularly to speak,\r\n     was commenced early in the season, by extensive correspondence to\r\n     enlist sympathy and aid in behalf of petitions. As soon as we\r\n     could get the public ear, several lecturing agents were secured,\r\n     and they did most efficient service, both with tongue and with\r\n     pen. One of these was Mrs. C. I. H. Nichols, of Kansas, formerly\r\n     of Vermont; and perhaps no person was ever better qualified than\r\n     she. Ever ready and ever faithful, in public and in private, and\r\n     ever capable, too, whether discussing the condition of woman with\r\n     the best informed members of the legal profession, or striving at\r\n     the fireside of some indolent and ignorant sister, over whose\r\n     best energies \"death is creeping like an untimely frost,\" to\r\n     waken in her heart a desire for that which is truly noble and\r\n     good.\r\n\r\n     Of another of our agents--Mrs. Cutler, of Illinois--equally as\r\n     much can be said of her qualifications and her efficiency. Having\r\n     been very widely acquainted with the sorrowful experiences of\r\n     women, both abroad and in our own country, which have been caused\r\n     by their inferior position, and by legal disabilities; and\r\n     lamenting, too, as only great and elevated natures can, the utter\r\n     wreck of true, noble womanhood in the higher circles of society,\r\n     a necessity is thus laid upon her to do all in her power to lift\r\n     both classes into a freer, better life.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Frances D. Gage, of Ohio, deeply interested herself in this\r\n     question in the beginning, and has never failed in faithful\r\n     testimony and timely word, to promote its success. Although not\r\n     identified with us as an agent, yet we had her active\r\n     co-operation during the campaign. Her editorial connection with\r\n     the press, and her lectures on the West India Islands, gave her\r\n     abundant opportunity, which she did not fail to embrace, of\r\n     circulating petitions and advocating the cause to which she has\r\n     so largely given her energies.\r\n\r\n     Besides the General Agent, whose time was divided between\r\n     correspondence, lecturing, and the general details of the\r\n     movement, there were other and most efficient workers, especially\r\n     in canvassing for signatures. We are indebted to Mrs. Anne Ryder,\r\n     of Cincinnati, for much labor in this direction; and also to\r\n     Mrs. Howard, of Columbus for similar service. Miss Olympia Brown,\r\n     a graduate of Antioch College, canvassed several towns most\r\n     successfully--adding thousands of names to the lists heretofore\r\n     obtained. Equally zealous were women, and men also, in various\r\n     sections of the State. By means of this hearty co-operation, both\r\n     branches of the Legislature were flooded with Woman's Rights\r\n     petitions during the first part of the session--a thousand and\r\n     even two thousand names were presented at a time.\r\n\r\n     Our main object this year, as heretofore, has been to secure\r\n     personal property and parental rights, never ignoring, however,\r\n     the right to legislate for ourselves. We were fortunate in the\r\n     commencement in enlisting some of the leading influences of the\r\n     State in favor of the movement. Persons occupying the highest\r\n     social and political position, very fully endorsed our claims to\r\n     legal equality, and rendered valuable aid by public approval of\r\n     the same. We took measures at an early period to obtain the\r\n     assistance of the press; and by means of this auxiliary our work\r\n     has been more fully recognized, and more generally appreciated\r\n     than it could otherwise have been. Without exception, the leading\r\n     journals of the State have treated our cause with consideration,\r\n     and generously commended the efforts of its agents.\r\n\r\n     So numerous were the petitions, and so largely did they represent\r\n     the best constituency of the State, that the committees in whose\r\n     hands they were placed, felt that by all just parliamentary\r\n     usage, they were entitled to a candid consideration. Accordingly\r\n     they invited several of us who had been prominent, to defend our\r\n     own cause in the Senate chamber, before their joint Committee and\r\n     such of the General Assembly and of the public, as might choose\r\n     to come and listen. From the reports of the numerous\r\n     letter-writers who were present, I will place one extract only\r\n     upon record.\r\n\r\n     \"The Senate chamber was filled to overflowing to hear Mrs. Jones,\r\n     Cutler, and Gage, and hundreds went away for want of a place to\r\n     stand. Columbus has seldom seen so refined and intelligent an\r\n     audience as that which gathered round those earnest women, who\r\n     had none of the charm of youth or beauty to challenge admiration,\r\n     but whose heads were already sprinkled with the frosts of life's\r\n     winter. Earnest, truthful, womanly, richly cultivated by the\r\n     experiences of practical life, those women, mothers, and two of\r\n     them grandmothers, pleaded for the right of woman to the fruit of\r\n     her own genius, labor, or skill, and for the mother her right to\r\n     be the joint guardian of her own offspring. I wish I could give\r\n     you even the faintest idea of the brilliancy of the scene, or the\r\n     splendor of the triumph achieved over the legions of prejudice,\r\n     the cohorts of injustice, and the old national guard of hoary\r\n     conservatism. If the triumph of a prima donna is something to\r\n     boast, what was the triumph of these toil-worn women, when not\r\n     only the members of the Committee, but Senators and Members of\r\n     the House, crowded around them with congratulations and\r\n     assurances that their able and earnest arguments had fully\r\n     prevailed, and the prayers of their petitioners must be granted.\"\r\n\r\n     The address of the first speaker was a written argument on legal\r\n     rights. It was solicited by members of the General Assembly for\r\n     publication, and distributed over the State at their expense.\r\n\r\n     The change in public sentiment, the marked favor with which our\r\n     cause began to be regarded in the judicial and legislative\r\n     departments, encouraged us to hope that if equal and exact\r\n     justice were not established, which we could hardly expect, we\r\n     should at least obtain legal equality in many particulars. The\r\n     Senate committee soon reported a bill, drafted by one of their\r\n     number--Judge Key--and fully endorsed by all the judges of the\r\n     Supreme Court, securing to the married woman the use of her real\r\n     estate, and the avails of her own separate labor, together with\r\n     such power to protect her property, and do business in her own\r\n     name, as men possess. The last provision was stricken out and the\r\n     bill thus amended passed both Houses, the Senate by a very large\r\n     majority.\r\n\r\n     Although this secures to us property rights in a measure only,\r\n     yet it is a great gain. He, who in abject bondage has striven\r\n     with his fetters, rejoices to have the smallest amount of their\r\n     weight removed. We have, therefore, reason to be grateful not\r\n     only for the benefits we shall derive from this Act, but for the\r\n     evidence of a growing sense of justice on the part of those who\r\n     claim for themselves the exclusive right to legislate. Senator\r\n     Parish had already prepared a Bill for Guardianship, and to\r\n     change the Laws of Descent, that something more than a paltry\r\n     dower should be secured to the widow in the common estate; but\r\n     the press of business, and the sudden commencement of open\r\n     hostilities between the North and South, precluded all\r\n     possibility of further legislation in our behalf. While Judge Key\r\n     has deservedly received universal thanks from the women of Ohio,\r\n     for proposing and carrying through the Legislature the Property\r\n     Bill, they are no less indebted to the Hon. Mr. Parish for his\r\n     faithful defense of their cause, not only during the present\r\n     session, but in years past. If all the Honorable Senators and\r\n     Representatives who have given their influence in favor of it\r\n     were to be mentioned, and all the faithful men and earnest women\r\n     who have labored to promote it, the list would be long and\r\n     distinguished.\r\n\r\n                                               J. ELIZABETH JONES.\r\n\r\nThus, in a measure, were the civil rights of the women of Ohio\r\nsecured. Some of those who were influential in winning this modicum of\r\njustice have already passed away; some, enfeebled by age, are\r\nincapable of active work; others are seeking in many latitudes that\r\nrest so necessary in the declining years of life.\r\n\r\nThe question naturally suggests itself, where are the young women of\r\nOhio, who will take up this noble cause and carry it to its final\r\ntriumph? They are reaping on all sides the benefits achieved for\r\nthem by others, and they in turn, by earnest efforts for the\r\nenfranchisement of woman, should do what they can to broaden the lives\r\nof the next generation.\r\n\r\nIn Ohio, as elsewhere, the great conflict between the North and South\r\nturned the thoughts of women from the consideration of their own\r\nrights, to the life of the nation. Many of them spent their last days\r\nand waning powers in the military hospitals and sanitariums,\r\nministering to sick and dying soldiers; others at a later period in\r\nthe service of the freedmen, guiding them in their labors, and\r\ninstructing them in their schools; all alike forgetting that justice\r\nto woman was a more important step in national safety than freedom or\r\nfranchise to any race of men.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] Years before the calling of this Convention, Mrs. Frances D. Gage\r\nhad roused much thought in Ohio by voice and pen. She was a long time\r\nin correspondence with Harriet Martineau and Mrs. Jane Knight, who was\r\nenergetically working for reduced postage rates, even before the days\r\nof Rowland Hill.\r\n\r\n[15] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[16] Said to have been written by J. Elizabeth Jones.\r\n\r\n[17] My notoriety as an Abolitionist made it very difficult for me to\r\nreach people at home, and, consequently, I had to work through press\r\nand social circle; women dared not speak then.

To our older readers, who have known the\r\nactors in these scenes, they will come like the far-off whispers of\r\nby-gone friends; to younger ones who will never see the faces of the\r\nnoble band of women who took the initiative in this struggle, it will\r\nbe almost as pleasant as a personal introduction, to have them speak\r\nfor themselves; each in her own peculiar style recount the experiences\r\nof those eventful years. As but few remain to tell the story, and each\r\nlife has made a channel of its own, there will be no danger of\r\nwearying the reader with much repetition.\r\n\r\nTo Clarina Howard Nichols the women of Kansas are indebted for many\r\ncivil rights they have as yet been too apathetic to exercise.\r\n\r\nHer personal presence in the Constitutional Convention of 1859,\r\nsecured for the women of that State liberal property rights, equal\r\nguardianship of their children, and the right to vote on all school\r\nquestions. She is a large-hearted, brave, faithful woman, and her life\r\nspeaks for itself. Her experiences are indeed the history of all that\r\nwas done in the above-mentioned States.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERMONT.\r\n\r\nI was born in Townshend, Windham County, Vermont, January 25, 1810.\r\n\r\nFrom 1843 to 1853 inclusive, I edited _The Windham County_\r\n_Democrat_, published by my husband, Geo. W. Nichols, at Brattleboro.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1847, I addressed to the voters of the State a series of\r\neditorials setting forth the injustice and miserable economy of the\r\nproperty disabilities of married women. In October of the same year,\r\nHon. Larkin Mead, of Brattleboro, \"moved,\" as he said, \"by Mrs.\r\nNichols' presentation of the subject\" in the _Democrat_, introduced in\r\nthe Vermont Senate a bill securing to the wife real and personal\r\nproperty, with its use, and power to defend, convey, and devise as if\r\n\"sole.\" The bill as passed, secured to the wife real estate owned by\r\nher at marriage, or acquired by gift, devise, or inheritance during\r\nmarriage, with the rents, issues, and profits, as against any debts of\r\nthe husband; but to make a sale or conveyance of either her realty or\r\nits use valid, it must be the joint act of husband and wife. She might\r\nby last will and testament dispose of her lands, tenements,\r\nhereditaments, and any interest therein descendable to her heirs, as\r\nif \"sole.\" A subsequent Legislature added to the latter clause,\r\nmoneys, notes, bonds, and other assets, accruing from sale or use of\r\nreal estate. And this was the first breath of a legal civil existence\r\nto Vermont wives.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, Vermont enacted a Homestead law. In 1850, a bill empowering\r\nthe wife to insure, in her own interest, the life, or a term of the\r\nlife of her husband; the annual premium on such insurance not to\r\nexceed $300; also an act giving to widows of childless husbands the\r\nwhole of an estate not exceeding $1,000 in value, and half of any\r\namount in excess of $1,000; and if he left no kin, the whole estate,\r\nhowever large, became the property of the widow. Prior to this Act,\r\nthe widow of a childless husband had only half, however small the\r\nestate, and if he left no kindred to claim it, the remaining half went\r\ninto the treasury of the State, whose gain was the town's loss, if, as\r\noccasionally happened, the widow's half was not sufficient for her\r\nsupport.[22]\r\n\r\nIn 1852, I drew up a petition signed by more than 200 of the most\r\nsubstantial business men, including the staunchest conservatives, and\r\ntax-paying widows of Brattleboro, asking the Legislature to make the\r\nwomen of the State voters in district school meetings.\r\n\r\nUp to 1850 I had not taken position for suffrage, but instead of\r\ndisclaiming its advocacy as improper, I had, since 1849, shown the\r\nabsurdity of regarding suffrage as unwomanly. Having failed to secure\r\nher legal rights by reason of her disfranchisement, a woman must look\r\nto the ballot for self-protection. In this cautious way I proceeded,\r\naware that not a house would be opened to me, did I demand the\r\nsuffrage before convicting men of legal robbery, through woman's\r\ninability to defend herself.\r\n\r\nThe petition was referred to the Educational Committee of the House,\r\nwhose chairman, editor of the _Rutland Herald_, was a bitter opponent,\r\nand I felt that he would, in his report, lampoon \"Woman's Rights\" and\r\ntheir most prominent advocates, thus sending his poison into all the\r\ntowns ignorant of our objects, and strengthening the already repellant\r\nprejudices of the leading women at the capital. I wrote to Judge\r\nThompson, editor of the _Green Mountain Freeman_ (a recent accession\r\nto the press of the State and friendly to our cause), what I feared,\r\nand asked him to plead before the Committee and interest influential\r\nmembers to protect woman's cause against abuse before the House. He\r\ncounseled with leading members of the three political parties--Whig,\r\nFree-Soil, and Democrat--including the Speaker of the House, and they\r\nadvised, as the best course, that \"Mrs. Nichols come to Montpelier,\r\nand they would invite her, by a handsome vote, to speak to her\r\npetition before the House.\" \"When,\" added Judge T., \"you can use your\r\nprivilege to present the whole subject of Woman's Rights. Come, and I\r\nwill stick by you like a brother.\" I went. The resolution of\r\ninvitation was adopted with a single dissenting vote, and that from\r\nthe Chairman of the Educational Committee, who unwittingly made the\r\nvote unanimous by the unfortunate exclamation, \"If the lady wants to\r\nmake herself ridiculous, let her come and make herself as ridiculous\r\nas possible and as soon as possible, but I don't believe in this\r\nscramble for the breeches!\"\r\n\r\nIn concluding my plea before the House (in which I had cited the\r\nstatutes and decisions of courts, showing that the husband owned even\r\nthe wife's clothing), I thanked the House for its resolution, and\r\nreferred to the concluding remark of the Chairman of the Educational\r\nCommittee, and said that though I \"had earned the dress I wore, my\r\nhusband owned it--not of his own will, but by a law adopted by\r\nbachelors and other women's husbands,\" and added: \"I will not appeal\r\nto the gallantry of this House, but to its manliness, if such a taunt\r\ndoes not come with an ill grace from gentlemen who have legislated our\r\nskirts into their possession? And will it not be quite time enough for\r\nthem to taunt us with being after their wardrobes, when they shall\r\nhave restored to us the legal right to our own?\"\r\n\r\nWith a bow I turned from the Speaker's stand, when the profound hush\r\nof as fine an audience as earnest woman ever addressed, was broken by\r\nthe muffled thunder of stamping feet, and the low, deep hum of pent-up\r\nfeeling loosed suddenly from restraint. A crowd of ladies from the\r\ngalleries, who had come only at the urgent personal appeal of Judge\r\nThompson, who had spent the day calling from house to house, and who a\r\nfew months before had utterly failed to persuade them to attend a\r\ncourse of physiological lectures from Mrs. Mariana Johnson, on account\r\nof her having once presided over a Woman's Rights Convention, these\r\nwomen met me at the foot of the Speaker's desk, exclaiming with\r\nearnest expressions of sympathy: \"We did not know before what Woman's\r\nRights were, Mrs. Nichols, but we are for Woman's Rights.\"\r\n\r\nSaid Mrs. Thompson to me upon our return to her home: \"I broke out in\r\na cold perspiration when your voice failed and you leaned your head on\r\nyour hand.\"[23] \"I thought you were going to fail,\" continued Mrs.\r\nThompson. \"Yes,\" said the Judge, \"I was very doubtful how it would\r\ncome out when I saw how sensitive Mrs. Nichols was. But,\" (turning to\r\nme), \"you have had a complete triumph! That final expression of your\r\naudience was perfect. _Mr. Herald_ with his outside recruits did not\r\ncome forward with the suit of male attire at the close, as he had\r\nadvertised he would, (I did not tell Mrs. N. this, my dear,\" said the\r\nJudge.) \"He'll catch it now, in the House and out.\" And he did \"catch\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nThe effort brought me no reproach, no ridicule from any quarter, but\r\ninstead, cordial recognition and delicate sympathy from unexpected\r\nquarters, and even from those who had heard but the report of persons\r\npresent. The editorial criticism of the Chairman of the Educational\r\nCommittee, paid me the high compliment of saying, that \"in spite of\r\nher efforts Mrs. Nichols could not unsex herself; even her voice was\r\nfull of womanly pathos.\" The report of the Committee was adverse to my\r\npetition, but not disrespectful. Though the petition failed, the\r\nfavorable impression created was regarded as a great triumph for\r\nwoman's rights.\r\n\r\nFrom the time I spoke at the Worcester Convention, 1850, until I left\r\nfor Kansas, October, 1854, I responded to frequent calls from town and\r\nneighborhood committees and lyceums--in the county and adjoining\r\nterritory of New Hampshire and Massachusetts as well as Vermont, to\r\nlecture or join in debate with men and women, the women voting me\r\ntheir time, on the subject of woman's legal and political equality. In\r\nthese neighborhood lyceums, ministers and deacons and their wives and\r\ndaughters took part. Generally wives were appointed in opposition to\r\ntheir husbands, and from their rich and varied experience did\r\nexcellent execution. In order to secure opposition, I used to let the\r\nnegative open and close, other wise the debate was sure to be tame or\r\nno debate at all. In all my experience it was the same; the\r\n\"affirmative\" had the merit and the argument.\r\n\r\nThe clergy often spoke--always when present--and in the negative, if\r\nit was their first hearing; and without a single exception they faced\r\nthe audience at the close with a cordial endorsement of the cause.\r\nSaid one such: \"I told you, ladies and gentlemen, that I had given\r\nlittle attention to the subject, and you see that I told the truth.\r\nMrs. Nichols has made out her case, and let her and the women laboring\r\nlike her, persevere, and woman will gain her rights.\" \"Let your wife\r\ngo all she can,\" said one of these converts to Mr. Nichols, \"she is\r\nbreaking down prejudices and making friends for your paper. Your\r\npolitical opponents have represented her as a masculine brawler for\r\nrights, and those who have never met her know no better. I went to\r\nhear her, full of misgivings that it might be so.\"\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1852 I went as often as twice a week--late P.M. and\r\nreturned early A.M.--from six to twenty miles. I was sent for where\r\nthere was no railroad. I often heard of \"ready-made pants,\" and once\r\nof a \"rail,\" but the greater the opposition, the greater the victory.\r\n\r\nOn a clear, cold morning of January, 1852, I found myself some six\r\nmiles from home at a station on the Vermont side of the Massachusetts\r\nState line, on my way to Templeton, Mass., whither I had been invited\r\nby a Lyceum Committee to lecture upon the subject of \"Woman's Rights.\"\r\nI had scarcely settled myself in the rear of the saloon for a restful,\r\ncareless two hours' ride, when two men entered the car. In the younger\r\nman I recognized the sheriff of our county. Having given a searching\r\nglance around the ear, the older man, with a significant nod to his\r\ncompanion, laid his hand upon the saloon door an instant, and every\r\nperson in the car had risen to his feet, electrified by the wail of a\r\n\"Rachel mourning for her children.\" \"O, father! she's _my_ child!\r\n_she's my child!_\" I reached the door, which was guarded by the\r\nsheriff, in a condition of mental exaltation (or concentration), which\r\nto this day reflects itself at the recollection of that agonizing cry\r\nof the beautiful young mother, set upon by the myrmidons of the law\r\nwhose base inhumanity shames the brute! \"Who is it?\" \"What is it?\"\r\n\"What does it all mean?\" were the anxious queries put up on all sides.\r\nI answered: \"It means, my friends, that a woman has no legal right to\r\nher own babies; that the law-makers of this _Christian country_ (!)\r\nhave given the custody of the babies to the father, drunken or sober,\r\nand he may send the sheriff--as in this case--to arrest and rob her of\r\nher little ones! You have heard sneers at 'Woman's Rights.' This is\r\none of the rights--a mother's right to the care and custody of her\r\nhelpless little ones!\"\r\n\r\nFrom that excited crowd--all young men and grown boys, I being the\r\nonly woman among them--rose thick and fast--\"_They've no business with\r\nthe woman's babies!_\" \"_Pitch 'em overboard!_\" \"_I'll help._\" \"_Good\r\nfor you; so'll I!_\" \"All aboard.\" (The conductor had come upon the\r\nscene). \"_All aboard._\" \"Wait a minute till he gets the other child,\"\r\ncries the old man, rushing out of the saloon with a little\r\nthree-year-old girl in his arms, while the sheriff rushed in. Standing\r\nbehind the old man, I beckoned to the conductor, who knew me, to \"_go\r\non_,\" and in five minutes we were across the Massachusetts line, and I\r\nwas in the saloon. With his hand on her child, the sheriff was urging\r\nthe mother to let go her hold. \"Hold on to your baby,\" I cried, \"he\r\nhas no right to take it from you, and is liable to fine and\r\nimprisonment for attempting it. Tell me, Mr. C----, are you helping\r\nthe other party as a favor, or in your official capacity? In the\r\nlatter case you might have taken her child in Vermont, but we are in\r\nMassachusetts now, quite out of your sheriff's beat.\" \"The grandfather\r\nmade legal custodian by the father, was he? That would do in Vermont,\r\nsir, but under the recent decision of a Massachusetts Court, given in\r\na case like this, _only the father_ can take the child from its\r\nmother, and in attempting it you have made yourselves liable to fine\r\nand imprisonment.\" Thus the \"sheriffalty\" was extinguished, and mother\r\nand child took their seat beside me in the car.\r\n\r\nMeantime the conductor had made the old gentleman understand that they\r\ncould get off at the next station, where they might take the \"up\r\ntrain,\" and get back to their \"team\" on the Vermont side of the\r\n\"line.\" As they could get no carriage at the bare little station, and\r\nwith the encumbrance of the child, could not foot it six miles in the\r\ncold and snow, they must wait some three or four hours for the train,\r\nwhich suggested the possibility of a rescue. I could not stop over a\r\ntrain, but I could take the baby along with me, if some one could be\r\nfound--The conductor calls. The car stops. As the child robbers step\r\nout (the little girl, clutched in the old grandfather's arms) 'mid the\r\nfrantic cries of the mother and the execrations of the passengers, two\r\nmiddle-aged gentlemen of fine matter-of-fact presence, entered. I at\r\nonce met their questioning faces with a hurried statement of facts,\r\nand the need of some intelligent, humane gentleman to aid the young\r\nmother in the recovery of her little girl. Having spoken together\r\naside, the younger man introduced \"Dr. B----, who lives in the next\r\ntown, where papers can be made out, and a sheriff be sent back to\r\nbring the men and child; the lady can go with the doctor, and the baby\r\nwith Mrs. Nichols. I would stop, but I must be in my seat in the\r\nLegislature.\" \"I have no money, only my ticket to take me to my\r\nfriends,\" exclaimed the anxious mother. \"I will take care of that,\"\r\nsaid the good doctor; \"you won't need any.\" \"They will have to pay,\" I\r\nwhispered....\r\n\r\nI gave my lecture at Templeton to a fine audience; accepted an\r\ninvitation to return and give a second on the same subject, and having\r\nleft the dear little toddler happy and amply protected, at noon next\r\nday found myself back at Orange, where I had left the mother. Here the\r\nconductor, who by previous arrangement, left a note from me telling\r\nher where to go for her baby, reported that the party had been brought\r\nto Orange for trial, spent the night in care of the sheriff, and were\r\nreleased on giving up the little girl and paying a handsome sum of the\r\nneedful to the mother. He had scarcely ended his report when the pair\r\nentered the car, like myself, homeward bound. The old gentleman,\r\ncare-worn and anxious, probably thinking of his team left standing at\r\nthe Vermont station, looked straight ahead, but the kind-hearted\r\nsheriff caught my eye and smiled. In my happiness I could not do\r\notherwise than give smile for smile.\r\n\r\nArrived at home, I found the affair, reported by the conductor of the\r\nevening train, had created quite an excitement, sympathy being\r\ndecidedly with the mother. I was credited with being privy to the\r\nescapade and the pursuit, and as having gone purposely to the rescue.\r\nHad this been true, I could not have managed it better, for a good\r\nProvidence went with me. I received several memorial \"hanks\" of yarn,\r\nwith messages from the donors that \"they would keep me in\r\nknitting-work while preaching woman's rights on the railroad\"--a\r\nreference to my practice of knitting on the cars, and the report that\r\nI gave a lecture on the occasion to my audience there.\r\n\r\nAnd thus was the seed of woman's educational, industrial, and\r\npolitical rights sown in Vermont, through infinite labor, but in the\r\nfaith and perseverance which bring their courage to all workers for\r\nthe right.\r\n\r\n\r\nWISCONSIN.\r\n\r\nIn September and October, 1853, I traveled 900 miles in Wisconsin, as\r\nagent of the Woman's State Temperance Society, speaking in forty-three\r\ntowns to audiences estimated at 30,000 in the aggregate, people coming\r\nin their own conveyances from five to twenty miles. I went to\r\nWisconsin under an engagement to labor as agent of the State\r\nTemperance League, an organization composed of both sexes and\r\nofficered by leading temperance men--at the earnest and repeated\r\nsolicitations of its delegates whom I met at the \"Whole World's\r\nTemperance Convention,\" held in New York City in September, and who\r\nwere commissioned by the League to employ speakers to canvass the\r\nState; the object being to procure the enactment of a \"Maine Law\" by\r\nthe next Legislature. These delegates had counseled, among others,\r\nwith Horace Greeley, who advised my employment, curiosity to hear a\r\nwoman promising to call out larger audiences and more votes for\r\ntemperance candidates in the pending election.\r\n\r\nI, at first, declined to make the engagement, on the ground that I\r\ncould not be spared from my newspaper duties; but to escape further\r\nimportunity, finally consented to \"ask my husband at home,\" and report\r\nat New York, where one of the gentlemen would await my answer, and\r\nmyself, if I decided to accept their proposition. My husband's\r\ncheerful, \"Go, wife, you will be doing just the work you love, and\r\nenjoying a journey which you have not means otherwise to undertake,\"\r\nand a notice from Mrs. Lydia F. Fowler, that she would join us in the\r\ntrip with a view to arranging for physiological lectures at eligible\r\npoints in the State, decided me to go. Mrs. F.'s company was not only\r\na social acquisition, but a happy insurance against pot-house witlings\r\non the alert to impale upon the world's dread laugh, any woman who, to\r\naccomplish some public good, should venture for a space to cut loose\r\nfrom the marital \"buttons\" and go out into the world alone!\r\n\r\nIn making the engagement, I had taken it for granted, that the right\r\nand propriety of woman's public advocacy of temperance was a settled\r\nquestion in the field to which I was invited. But arrived at\r\nMilwaukee, I found that the popular prejudice against women as public\r\nspeakers, and especially the advocacy of Woman's Rights, with which I\r\nhad for years been identified, had been stirred to its most disgusting\r\ndepths by a reverend gentleman who had preceded us, and who had for\r\nyears been a salaried \"agent at large,\" of the New York State\r\nTemperance Society. A highly respectable minority of the Executive\r\nCommittee of the League endorsed the action of their delegation, but\r\nwere overruled by a numerical majority, and I found myself in the\r\nposition of agent \"at large,\" while the reverend traducer secured his\r\nengagement in my place.\r\n\r\nThis turn of affairs, embarrassing at first, proved in the end\r\nprovidential--a timely clearance for a more congenial craft--since the\r\nwomen of the State had organized a Woman's State Temperance Society,\r\nand advertised a Convention to meet the following week at Delavan, the\r\npopulous shire town of Walworth County, fifty miles distant in the\r\ninterior. Thither the friendly Leaguers proposed to take us. Meantime\r\nit was arranged that Mrs. F. and I should address the citizens of\r\nMilwaukee. A capacious church was engaged for Sabbath evening, from\r\nwhich hundreds went away unable to get in. But neither clergyman nor\r\nlayman could be found willing to commit himself by opening the\r\nservices; and with \"head uncovered,\" in a church in which it was \"a\r\nshame for a woman to speak,\" I rested my burden with the dear Father,\r\nas only burdens are rested with Him, in conscious unity of purpose.\r\n\r\nMrs. F. addressed the audience on the physiological effects of\r\nalcoholic drinks. I followed, quoting from the prophecy of King\r\nLemuel, that \"his mother taught him,\" Proverbs xxxi., verses 4, 5, 8,\r\n9, \"Open thy mouth for the dumb; in the cause of all such as are\r\nappointed to destruction. Open thy mouth, judge righteously and plead\r\nthe cause of the poor and needy.\" The spirit moved audience and\r\nspeaker. We forgot ourselves; forgot everything but \"the poor and\r\nneedy,\" the drunkard's wife and children \"appointed to destruction\"\r\nthrough license laws and alienated civil rights.\r\n\r\nAt Delavan we met a body of earnest men and women, indignant at the\r\naction of the Executive Committee of the League, to which many of them\r\nhad contributed funds for the campaign, and ready to assume the\r\nresponsibility of my engagement, and the expenses of Mrs. F., who in\r\nfollowing out her original plan, generously consented to precede my\r\nlectures with a brief physiological dissertation apropos to the object\r\nof the canvass. The burden of the speaking, as planned, rested with\r\nme, provided my hitherto untested physical ability proved equal, as it\r\ndid, to the daily effort.\r\n\r\nIn counsel with Mrs. R. Ostrander, President of the Society, and her\r\nsister officials, women of character and intelligence, I could\r\nexplain, as I could not have done to any body of equally worthy men,\r\nthat in justice to ourselves, to them, and to the cause we had at\r\nheart, we must make the canvass in a spirit and in conditions above\r\nreproach. \"I can not come down from my work,\" said Miss Lyon, founder\r\nof Mount Holyoke Female Seminary, when importuned to rebut some\r\nbaseless scandal. To fight our way would be to mar the spirit and\r\neffect of our work. We must place the opposition at a disadvantage\r\nfrom the first; then we could afford to ignore it altogether and rise\r\nto a level with the humane issues of the campaign. It was accordingly\r\narranged that the friends should make appointments and secure us\r\nsuitable escort to neighboring towns; and to distant and less\r\naccessible points a gentleman was engaged to take us in a private\r\ncarriage,--his wife, a woman of rare talent and fine culture, to\r\naccompany us. A programme which was advertised in the local papers and\r\nhappily carried out.\r\n\r\nFrom Delavan we returned to Milwaukee to perfect our arrangements.\r\nFrom thence our next move was to Waukesha, the shire town of Waukesha\r\nCounty, twenty miles by rail, to a Temperance meeting advertised for\r\n\"speaking and the transaction of business.\" The meeting was held in\r\nthe Congregational church, the pastor acting as chairman. The real\r\nbusiness of the meeting was soon disposed of, and then was enacted the\r\nmost amusing farce it was ever my lot to witness. The chairman and his\r\ndeacon led off in a long-drawn debate on sundry matters of no\r\nimportance, and of less interest to the audience, members of which\r\nattempted in vain, by motions and votes, to cut it short. When it had\r\nbecome sufficiently apparent that the gentlemen were \"talking against\r\ntime\" to prevent speaking, there were calls for speakers. The chairman\r\nreplied that it was a \"business meeting, but Rev. Mr. ----, from\r\nIllinois, would lecture in the evening.\" Several gentlemen rose to\r\nprotest. One said he \"had walked seven miles that his wife and\r\ndaughters might ride, to hear the ladies speak.\" Another had \"ridden\r\nhorseback twelve miles to hear them.\" A storm was impending; the\r\nchairman was prepared; he declared the meeting adjourned and with his\r\ndeacon left the house.\r\n\r\nThere was a hurried consultation in the ante-room, which resulted in\r\nan urgent request for \"Mrs. Nichols to remain and speak in the\r\nevening.\" The speaker noticed for the evening, joined heartily in the\r\nrequest; \"half an hour was all the time he wanted.\" But when the\r\nevening came, he insisted that I should speak first, and when I should\r\nhave given way for him, assured me that he \"had made arrangements to\r\nspeak the next evening,\" and joined in the \"go on, go on!\" of the\r\naudience. So it was decided that I should remain over the Sabbath, and\r\nMrs. F. return with the friends to Milwaukee.\r\n\r\nMeantime it had transpired that in the audience were several\r\nVermonters from a settlement of fourteen families from the vicinity of\r\nmy home; among them a lady from my native town; we had been girls\r\ntogether. \"We know all about Mrs. N.,\" said one. \"We take the\r\n_Tribune_, and friends at home send us her paper.\" So the good Father\r\nhad sent vouchers for His agent at large. But this was not all. I had\r\na pleasant reserve for the evening. I had recognized in the deacon, a\r\nfriend from whom I had parted twenty-one years before in Western New\r\nYork. In the generous confidence of youthful enthusiasm we had\r\nenlisted in the cold-water army; together pledged ourselves to fight\r\nthe liquor interest to the death. And here my old friend, whose début\r\non the Temperance platform I had aided and cheered, had talked a full\r\nhour to prevent me from being heard! Was I indignant? Was I grieved?\r\nNay! It was not a personal matter. Time's graver had made us strange\r\nto each other. His name and voice had revealed him to me; but the name\r\nI bore was not that by which he had known me. Besides, I remembered\r\nthat twenty-one years before, I could not have been persuaded to hear\r\na woman speak on any public occasion, and I had nothing to\r\nforgive,--my friend had only stood still where I had left him. Such,\r\nsuppressing his name, was the story I told my audience on that\r\nevening. And with his puzzled and kindly face intently regarding me, I\r\nassured my hearers that I had not a doubt of his whole-souled and\r\nmanly support in my present work. Nor was I disappointed.\r\n\r\nNext morning, (Sabbath) I listened to a scholarly sermon on infidel\r\nissues and innovations from the chairman of the \"business meeting\" of\r\nthe previous afternoon, he having stayed away from my lecture to\r\nprepare it. In the evening, after the temperance lecture of my\r\nIllinois friend, I improved the opportunity of a call from the\r\naudience, the Rev. Chairman being present, to meet certain points of\r\nthe sermon, personal to myself and the advocates of rights for women,\r\nclosing with a brief confession of my faith in Christ's rule of love\r\nand duty as impressing every human being into the service of a common\r\nhumanity--the right to serve being commensurate with the obligation,\r\nas of God and not of man.\r\n\r\nOne week later, another business meeting was held in the same house,\r\nand in its published proceedings was a resolution introduced by the\r\nRev. Chairman, endorsing Mrs. Nichols, and inviting her \"to be present\r\nand speak\" at a County Convention appointed for a subsequent day. Not\r\nlong after he sent me, through a brother clergyman, an apology that\r\nwould have disarmed resentment, had I felt any, toward a man who,\r\nhaving opposed me without discourtesy and retracted by a published\r\nresolution, was yet not satisfied without tendering a private apology.\r\n\r\nI had achieved a grateful success; license to \"plead the cause of the\r\npoor and needy,\" where, _how_ to do so, without offending old-time\r\nideas of woman's sphere, had seemed to the women under whose direction\r\nI had taken the field, the real question at issue. In consideration of\r\nexisting prejudices, they had suggested the prudence of silence on the\r\nsubject of Woman's Rights. And here, on the very threshold of the\r\ncampaign, I had been compelled to vindicate my right to speak for\r\nwoman; as a woman, to speak for her from any stand-point of life to\r\nwhich nature, custom, or law had assigned her. I had no choice, no\r\nhope of success, but in presenting her case as it stood before God and\r\nmy own soul. To neither could I turn traitor, and do the work, or\r\nsatisfy the aspirations of a true and loving woman.\r\n\r\nFor more than a quarter of a century earnest men had spoken, and\r\nfailed to secure justice to the poor and needy, \"appointed to\r\ndestruction\" by the liquor traffic. They had failed because they had\r\ndenied woman's right to help them, and taken from her the means to\r\nhelp herself. In speaking for woman, I must be heard from a domestic\r\nlevel of legal pauperism disenchanted of all political prestige. In\r\nappealing to the powers that be, I must appeal from sovereigns drunk\r\nto sovereigns sober,--with eight chances in ten that the decision\r\nwould be controlled by sovereigns drunk.\r\n\r\nTo impress the paramount claim of women to a no-license law, without\r\nlaying bare the legal and political disabilities that make them \"the\r\ngreatest sufferers,\" the helpless victims of the liquor traffic, was\r\nimpossible. It would have been stupidly unwise to withhold what with a\r\nmajority of voters is the weightier consideration, that in alienating\r\nfrom women their earnings, governments impose upon community taxes for\r\nthe support of the paupered children of drunken fathers, whose mothers\r\nwould joyfully support and train them for usefulness; and who, as a\r\nrule, have done so when by the death or divorce of the husband they\r\nhave regained the control of their earnings and the custody of their\r\nchildren. Thus proving, that man, by his disabling laws, has made\r\nwoman helpless and dependent, and not God, who has endowed her with\r\ncapabilities equal to the responsibilities He has imposed.\r\n\r\nWorse than unwise would it have been to allow an unjust prejudice\r\nagainst Woman's Rights, to turn the edge of my appeals for a law in\r\nthe interest of temperance, when by showing the connection, as of\r\ncause and effect, between men's rights and women's wrongs, between\r\nwomen's _no_-rights and their helplessness and dependence, I could\r\ndisarm that prejudice and win an intelligent support for both\r\ntemperance and equal rights. On such a showing I based my appeals to\r\nthe noble men and women of Wisconsin. I assured my audiences, that I\r\nhad not come to talk to them of \"Woman's Rights,\" that indeed I did\r\nnot find that women had any rights in the matter, but to \"suffer and\r\nbe still; to die and give no sign.\" But I had come to them to speak of\r\n_man's rights_ and _woman's needs_.\r\n\r\nFrom the Lake Shore cities, from the inland villages, the shire towns,\r\nand the mining communities of the Mississippi, whose churches,\r\ncourt-houses, and halls, with two or three exceptions, could not hold\r\nthe audiences, much less seat them; the responses were hearty, and\r\nwhen outspoken, curiously alike in language as well as sentiment on\r\nthe subject of rights. \"I like Mrs. Nichols' idea of talking man's\r\nrights; the result will be woman's rights,\" said a gentleman rising in\r\nhis place in the audience at the close of one of my lectures. On\r\nanother occasion, \"Let Mrs. Nichols go on talking men's rights and\r\nwe'll have women's rights.\" \"Mrs. Nichols has made me ashamed of\r\nmyself--ashamed of my sex! I didn't know we had been so mean to the\r\nwomen,\" was the outspoken conclusion of a man who had lived honored\r\nand respected, his threescore years and ten. This reaction from the\r\ncuriosity and doubt which everywhere met us in the expressive faces of\r\nthe people, often reminded me of an incident in my Vermont labors for\r\na Maine law.\r\n\r\nIn accepting an invitation to address an audience of ladies in the\r\naristocratic old town of C----, in an adjoining county, I had\r\nsuggested, that as it was votes we needed, I would prefer to address\r\nan audience of both sexes. Arrived at C----, I found that the ladies\r\nof the committee, having acted upon my suggestion, were intensely\r\nanxious as to the result. \"An audience,\" they said, \"could not be\r\ncollected to listen to woman's rights; the people were sensitive even\r\nto the innovation of a mixed audience for a woman, and they felt that\r\nI ought to be informed of the facts.\" And I felt in every nerve, that\r\nthey were suffering from fear lest I should fail to vindicate the\r\nwomanliness of our joint venture. But the people came, a church,\r\nfull; intelligent, expectant, and curious to hear a woman. The\r\nresident clergyman, of my own faith, declined to be present and open\r\nwith prayer. A resident Universalist clergyman present, declined to\r\npray. A young Methodist licentiate in the audience, not feeling at\r\nliberty to decline, tried. His ideas stumbled; his words hitched, and\r\nwhen he prayed: \"Bless thy serv--a'hem--thy handmaid, and a'hem--and\r\nlet all things be done decently and in order;\" we in the committee pew\r\nfelt as relieved as did the young Timothy when he had achieved his\r\namen!\r\n\r\nUtterly unnerved by the anxious faces of my committee, I turned to my\r\naudience with only the inspiration of homes devastated and families\r\npaupered, to sustain me in a desperate exhibit of the need and the\r\n\"determination of women, impelled by the mother-love that shrinks\r\nneither from fire or flood, to rescue their loved ones from the fires\r\nand floods of the liquor traffic, though to do so they must make their\r\nway through every platform and pulpit in the land!\" \"Thank God!\"\r\nexclaimed the licentiate on my right. \"Amen!\" emphasized the chairman\r\noh my left. My committee were radiant. My audience had accepted\r\nwoman's rights in her wrongs; and I ---- only woman's recording angel\r\ncan tell the sensations of a disfranchised woman when her \"declaration\r\nof intentions\" is endorsed by an Anti-Woman's Rights audience with\r\nfervent thanks to God!\r\n\r\nLatter-day laborers can have little idea of the trials of the early\r\nworker, driven by the stress of right and duty against popular\r\nprejudices, to which her own training and early habits of thought have\r\nmade her painfully sensitive. St. Paul, our patron saint, I think had\r\njust come through such a trial of his nerves when he wrote: \"The\r\nspirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.\" The memory of the beautiful\r\nscenery, the charming Indian summer skies, the restful companionship\r\nof our family party in the daily drive, and the generous hospitality\r\nof the people of Wisconsin, is one of the pleasantest of a life, as\r\nfull of sweet memories as of trials, amid and through which they have\r\nclung to me with a saving grace.\r\n\r\nThe Temperance majority in the ensuing election, so far as influenced\r\nby canvassing agents, was due to the combined efforts of all who\r\nlabored for it, and of these it was my good fortune to meet a younger\r\nbrother of William H. and O. C. Burleigh, who from his man's\r\nstand-point of precedents and statistics did excellent service.\r\n\r\nThe law enacted by the Legislature securing to the wives of drunkards\r\ntheir earnings and the custody and earnings of their minor children, I\r\nthink I may claim as a result of appeals from the home stand-point of\r\nwoman's sphere. As a financial measure diverting the supplies and\r\nlessening the profits of the liquor traffic, this law is a civil\r\nservice reform of no mean promise for the abatement of pauper and\r\ncriminal taxes. In a plea of counsel for defendant in a case of\r\nwife-beating to which I once listened, said the gentlemanly attorney:\r\n\"If Patrick will let the bottle alone\"--\"Please, your honor,\" broke in\r\nthe weeping wife, \"if you will stop Misthur Kelly from filling it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKANSAS.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1854, with my two eldest sons, I joined a company of two\r\nhundred and twenty-five men, women, and children, emigrants from the\r\nEast to Kansas. In our passage up the Missouri River I gave two\r\nlectures by invitation of a committee of emigrants and Captain Choteau\r\nand brother, owners of the boat. A pious M.D. was terribly shocked at\r\nthe prospect, and hurried his young wife to bed, but returned to the\r\ncabin himself in good time to hear. As the position was quite central,\r\nand I wished to be heard distinctly by the crowd which occupied all\r\nthe standing room around the cabin, I took my stand opposite the\r\nDoctor's berth. Next morning, poor man! his wife was an outspoken\r\nadvocate of woman's rights. The next evening she punched his ribs\r\nvigorously, at every point made for suffrage, which was the subject of\r\nmy second lecture.\r\n\r\nThe 1st of November, 1854--a day never to be forgotten--heaven and\r\nearth clasped hands in silent benedictions on that band of immigrants,\r\nsome on foot, some on horseback, women and children, seventy-five in\r\nnumber, with the company's baggage, in ox-carts and wagons drawn by\r\nthe fat, the broken-down, and the indifferent \"hacks\" of wondering,\r\nscowling Missouri, scattered all along the prairie road from Kansas\r\nCity to Lawrence, the Mecca of their pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nIn advance of all these, at 11 o'clock A.M., Mrs. H---- and myself\r\nwere sitting in front of the Lawrence office of the New England\r\nEmigrant Aid Company, in the covered wagon of Hon. S. C. Pomeroy, who\r\nhad brought us from Kansas City, and entered the office to announce\r\nthe arrival of our company; when a hilarious explosion of several\r\nvoices assured us that good lungs as well as brave hearts were within.\r\nDirectly Col. P. and Dr. (Governor) Robinson came out. \"Did you hear\r\nthe cheering?\" asked the Doctor. \"I did, and was thinking when you\r\ncame out, what a popular man the Colonel must be to call forth such a\r\ngreeting!\" \"But the cheers were for Mrs. Nichols,\" was the reply; and\r\nthe Doctor proceeded to tell us that, \"the boys\" had been hotly\r\ndiscussing women's rights, when one of their advocates who had heard\r\nher lecture, expressed a wish that his opponents could hear Antoinette\r\nBrown on the subject; a second wished they could hear Susan B.\r\nAnthony; and a third wished they could hear Mrs. Nichols. On the heels\r\nof these wishes, the announcement of Colonel Pomeroy, that \"Mrs.\r\nNichols was at the door,\" was the signal for triumphant cheering. \"The\r\nboys\" wanted a lecture in the evening. The Doctor said: \"No; Mrs.\r\nNichols is tired. To-morrow the thatching of the church will be\r\ncompleted, and she can dedicate the building.\"\r\n\r\nThus truths sown broadcast among the stereotyped beliefs and\r\nprejudices of the old and populous communities of the East, had\r\nwrought a genial welcome for myself and the advocacy of woman's cause\r\non the disputed soil of Kansas. But, alas! for the \"stony ground.\" One\r\nof \"the boys\" didn't stay to the \"dedication.\" He had \"come to Kansas\r\nto get away from the women,\" and left at once for Leavenworth. I\r\nwonder if the Judge--he is that now, and a benedict--remembers? I\r\nstill regret that lost opportunity for making his acquaintance.\r\n\r\nAt Lawrence, the objective point of all the Free State immigration,\r\nwhere I spent six weeks in assisting my sons to make a home for the\r\nwinter, I mingled freely with the incoming population, and gave\r\nseveral lectures to audiences of from two to three hundred, the entire\r\npopulation coming together at the ringing of the city dinnerbell. I\r\nreturned to Vermont early in January, 1855, and in April following,\r\nwith two hundred and fifty emigrants (my husband and younger son\r\naccompanying me), rejoined my other sons in the vicinity of Baldwin\r\nCity, where we took claims and commenced homes. I presented the whole\r\nsubject of Woman's Rights on the boats in going and returning, as at\r\nfirst, by invitation. In the summer of 1855, delegates were elected to\r\na Constitutional Convention, which later convened at Topeka. Governor\r\nRobinson, who with six other delegates voted for the exclusion of the\r\nword \"male\" from qualification for elector, sent me an invitation to\r\nattend its sessions, speak before it for woman's equality, and they\r\nwould vote me a secretary's or clerk's position in the Convention. My\r\nhusband's fatal illness prevented me from going.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1856, I returned from Kansas to Vermont, widowed and\r\nbroken in health, to attend to matters connected with my husband's\r\nestate. Prevented by the ruffian blockade of the Missouri from\r\nreturning as intended, I spent some time in the summer and all of the\r\nautumn of 1856 and January, 1857, lecturing upon Kansas, the character\r\nand significance of its political involvements, its promise and\r\nimportance as a free or slave State, and its claims to an efficient\r\nsupport in the interest of freedom. In September, being appealed to by\r\nthe \"Kansas National Aid Committee,\" at the instance of Horace\r\nGreeley, I engaged for two months in a canvass of Western New York,\r\nlecturing and procuring the appointment of committees of women to\r\ncollect supplies for the suffering people of Kansas; my two oldest\r\nsons, C. H. and A. O. Carpenter being among its armed defenders, the\r\nlatter having been wounded in the fight between the invaders under\r\nCaptain Pate and the forces under John Brown and Captain S. Shores, at\r\nBlack Jack.\r\n\r\nBetween May, 1856, and February, 1857 (not counting my engagement with\r\nthe Aid Committee), I gave some fifty Kansas lectures in the States of\r\nVermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and\r\nNew York, followed occasionally by one or two lectures on the legal\r\nand political disabilities of women; receiving more invitations on\r\nboth subjects than I could possibly fill.\r\n\r\nMy experiences in these semi-political labors were often racy, never\r\nunsatisfactory. In a public conveyance one day, an honest old\r\nPennsylvania farmer asked if I was \"the lady who made an appointment\r\nto speak in his place on Kansas, and did not come?\" I replied that I\r\nhad filled all the appointments made for me with my knowledge; that I\r\nmade a point of keeping my promises. \"I believe you, ma'am,\" said he.\r\n\"I suspicioned then it was jest a republican trick. You see, ma'am,\r\nour folks all are dimocrats and wouldn't turn out to hear the\r\nrepublican speakers; so they appointed a meeting for _you_ and\r\neverybody turned out, for we'd hearn of your lectures. But instid of\r\nyou, General D---- and Lawyer C---- came, and we were mad enough. I\r\nwas madder, 'cause I'd opened my house, seein' as it was the largest\r\nand most convenient in the neighborhood.\"\r\n\r\nOccasionally I stumbled on a loose segment of woman's sphere, even\r\namong the friends of \"free Kansas.\" In a populous Vermont village, at\r\na meeting called for the purpose, a committee was appointed to invite\r\nme to speak, composed of the two clergymen of the village and Judge\r\nS----. Reverend W---- excused himself from the service on the ground\r\nof \"conscientious scruples as to the propriety of women speaking in\r\npublic.\" Judge S----, a man who for a quarter of a century had, by a\r\nracy combination of wit and logic, maintained his ground against the\r\nfoes of temperance and freedom, with inimitable gravity thanked the\r\naudience for the honor conferred on him; adding, \"I have no\r\nconscientious scruples about getting desirable information wherever I\r\ncan find it.\"\r\n\r\nIn Sinclairville, Chautauque County, New York, where I arrived late,\r\nin consequence of a railroad accident, I found a crowded church. A\r\ngentleman introduced to me as \"Mr. Bull\" was sitting at a table in the\r\nextreme front corner of the spacious platform, recording the names and\r\nadvance payments of a class in music, which, as I had been told\r\noutside, was being organized by a gentleman who had arrived with the\r\nnews of my probable detention.\r\n\r\nDuring the next half hour gentlemen rose at three several times and\r\nrequested Mr. B---- to \"postpone the class business till the close of\r\nthe lecture: that people had come from a distance to hear the lecture,\r\nand were anxious to return home, the night being dark and rainy.\" \"I\r\nwill be through soon. I like to finish a thing when I begin.\"\r\n\"There'll be time enough,\" were the several replies, given in a tone\r\nand with an emphasis that suggested to my mind a doubt of the\r\nspeaker's sympathy with my subject. When the clock pointed to eight, I\r\nquietly took my seat in the desk and was smoothing my page of notes\r\nwhen there fell on my astonished ear--\"I was about to introduce the\r\nlady speaker, but she has suddenly disappeared.\" Stepping forward, I\r\nsaid, \"Excuse me, sir; as the hour is very late I took my place to be\r\nin readiness when you should be through with your class.\" \"Madam, you\r\nwill speak on this platform.\" \"I noticed, sir, that I could not see my\r\naudience from the platform, also that the desk was lighted for me.\"\r\n\"Madam, you can't speak in that pulpit!\" \"This is very strange. Will\r\nyou give me your reasons?\" \"It's none of your business!\" \"Indeed, sir,\r\nI do not understand it. Will you give me your authority?\" \"It's my\r\npulpit, and if you speak in this house to-night you speak from this\r\nplatform!\" \"Excuse me, sir; I mistook you for the music-teacher, who,\r\nas I was told, was organizing a class in music.\" And stepping quickly\r\nto the platform to restore the equanimity of the house, I remarked, as\r\nindicating my position, that my self-respect admonished me to be the\r\nlady always, no matter how ungentlemanly the treatment I might\r\nreceive; that the cause of humanity, the cause of suffering Kansas was\r\nabove all personal considerations, and proceeded with my lecture.\r\n\r\nAt the close, Mr. B---- arose and said: \"I owe this audience an\r\napology for my ungentlemanly language to Mrs. Nichols. I am aware that\r\nI shall get into the public prints, and I wish to set myself right.\" A\r\ngentleman in the audience rose and moved, \"that we excuse the Rev. R.\r\nB---- for his ungentlemanly language to Mrs. Nichols to-night, on the\r\nscore of his ignorance.\" The motion was seconded with emphasis by a\r\nman of venerable presence. \"Friends,\" I appealed, \"this is a personal\r\nmatter; it gives me no concern. It will affect neither me nor my work.\r\nPlease name suitable women for the committee of relief which I am here\r\nto ask.\" Business being concluded, I turned to Mr. B----, who was shut\r\nin with me by a press of sympathizing friends, and expressed my\r\nregret, that he should have said anything to place him under the\r\nnecessity of apologizing, adding, \"but I hope in future you will\r\nremember the words of Solomon: 'Greater is he that controlleth his own\r\nspirit, than he that taketh a city.' Good-night, sir.\" I learned that\r\na few months before he had prevented his people from inviting\r\nAntoinette Brown to speak to them on Temperance, by declaring that \"he\r\nwould never set his foot in a pulpit that had been occupied by a\r\nwoman.\" When three weeks later I heard of his dismissal from his\r\ncharge in S----, I could appreciate the remark of his brother\r\nclergyman in a neighboring town, to whom I related the incident, that\r\n\"Brother B---- is rather given to hooking with those horns of his, but\r\nhe's in hot water now.\"\r\n\r\nIn the winter and spring of 1856, I had, by invitation of its editor,\r\nwritten a series of articles on the subject of woman's legal\r\ndisabilities, preparatory to a plea for political equality, for the\r\ncolumns of the Kansas _Herald of Freedom_, the last number of which\r\nwent down with the \"_form_\" and press of the office to the bottom of\r\nthe Kansas river, when the Border ruffians sacked Lawrence in 1856.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1857, I again returned to Kansas, and with my daughter and\r\nyoungest son, made a permanent home in Wyandotte County.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution was adopted in November, 1859, by popular vote. In\r\nJanuary, 1860, Kansas having been admitted to the Union, the first\r\nState Legislature met at Topeka, the capital of the new State. I\r\nattended its sessions, as I had those of the Convention, and addressed\r\nboth in behalf of justice for the women of the State, as delegate of\r\nthe Kansas Woman's Rights Association. This Association was formed in\r\nthe spring of 1859 with special reference to the Convention which had\r\nalready been called to meet in the July following, in the city of\r\nWyandotte.\r\n\r\nThe Association--if I recollect aright--numbered some twenty-five\r\nearnest men and women of the John Brown type, living in Moneka, Linn\r\nCounty; John O. Wattles, President; Susan Wattles, Secretary. Wendell\r\nPhillips, treasurer of the Francis Jackson Woman's Rights Fund,\r\nguaranteed payment of expenses, and the Association sent me, with\r\nlimited hopes and unstinted blessings, to canvass the principal\r\nsettlements in the Territory, obtain names to petitions and represent\r\nthem--if allowed by courtesy of the Convention--in behalf of equal\r\ncivil and political rights for the women of the State to be organized.\r\nI was appealed to as the only woman in the Territory who had\r\nexperience and could take the field, which was I believe true.\r\n\r\nWe had no material for Conventions, and the population was so sparse,\r\ndistances so great, and means of conveyance and communication so slow\r\nand uncertain, that I felt sure an attempt at Conventions would be\r\ndisastrous, only betraying the weakness of our reserves, for I must\r\nhave done most, if not all the speaking.\r\n\r\nIt was the policy of the Republicans to \"keep shady,\" as a party. John\r\nWattles came to Wyandotte before I addressed the Convention, counseled\r\nwith members, and reported to me that \"I didn't need him, that it was\r\nbetter that no man appear in it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter spending some four weeks in the field, I went to the Convention,\r\nand with a very dear friend, Mrs. Lucy B. Armstrong, of Wyandotte, was\r\ngiven a permanent seat beside the chaplain, Rev. Mr. Davis, Presiding\r\nElder of the Methodist Episcopal Church of the District, which I\r\noccupied till the adjournment of the Convention, laboring to develop\r\nan active and corresponding interest in outsiders as well as members,\r\nuntil my petitions had been acted upon and the provisions finally\r\npassed; purposely late in the session.\r\n\r\nHaving at the commencement, only two known friends of our cause among\r\nthe delegates to rely upon for its advocacy, against the compact\r\nopposition of the sixteen Democratic members, and the bitter\r\nprejudices of several of the strongest Republicans, including the\r\nfirst Chief Justice of the new State and its present unreconstructed\r\nSenator Ingalls, an early report upon our petitions would have been\r\nutter defeat. Persistent \"button-holing\" of the delegates, any\r\n\"unwomanly obtrusiveness\" of manners, a vague apprehension of which,\r\nat that period of our movement, was associated in the minds of even\r\ngood men and women, with the advocacy of the cause, was the\r\n\"big-'fraid\" followed by more than one \"little 'fraid,\" that made my\r\ncourse one of anxiety, less only than my faith in the ultimate\r\nadoption of the provisions named.\r\n\r\nOf political suffrage I had, as I confidentially told my friends of\r\nthe Association, no hope, and for the very reason given me later by\r\nmembers of the Convention who consented to school suffrage; viz: \"even\r\nif endorsed by popular vote, such a provision would probably defeat\r\nadmission to the Union.\" None the less, however, was the necessity for\r\ndisarming the prejudices and impressing upon delegates and citizens\r\nthe justice of the demand for political enfranchisement.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the hospitable tea-table of Mrs. Armstrong, with whom I\r\nwas domiciled for the session, offered abundant womanly opportunity\r\nfor conference and discussion with delegates; and in the homes of\r\nleading citizens I met a hearty sympathy which I can never forget.\r\n\r\nDuring a recess of the Convention, a friendly member introduced me to\r\nGovernor Medary, as \"the lady who, by vote of the Convention, will\r\nspeak here this evening in behalf of equal Constitutional rights for\r\nthe women of Kansas.\" \"But, Mrs. Nichols, you would not have women go\r\ndown into the muddy pool of politics?\" asked the Governor. \"Even so,\r\nGovernor, I admit that you know best how muddy that pool is, but you\r\nremember the Bethesda of old; how the angel had to go in and trouble\r\nthe waters before the sick could be healed. So I would have the angels\r\ntrouble this muddy pool that it may be well with the people; for you\r\nknow, Governor Medary, that this people is very sick. But here is a\r\npetition to which I am adding names as I find opportunity; will you\r\nplace your name on the roll of honor?\" \"Not now, Madam, not now. I\r\nwill _sign the bill_.\" And the Governor, quite unconscious of his\r\nmistake, with a smile and a bow, hurried away amid the good-natured\r\nraillery of the little circle that had gathered around us. But it was\r\nGovernor Robinson, the life-long friend of woman and a free humanity,\r\nthat had the pleasure of \"signing the bills.\"\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the earnest request of delegates, supported by the\r\naction of the Association, I labored from the adjournment of the\r\nConvention till the vote on the adoption of the Constitution, to\r\n\"remove the prejudices\"--as the delegates expressed it--\"of their\r\nconstituents, against the Woman's Rights provisions\" of that document.\r\nThe death of Mr. Wattles on the eve of the campaign sent me alone into\r\nthe lecture field. For with the exception of Hon. Charles Robinson,\r\nour first State Governor, and always an outspoken friend of our cause,\r\nthe politicians in the field either ignored or ridiculed the idea of\r\nwomen being entitled under the school provision to vote.\r\n\r\nAt Bloomington, when I had presented its merits in contrast with\r\nexisting legal provisions, a venerable man in the audience rose and\r\nremarked that the Hon. James H. Lane, in addressing them a few days\r\nbefore, denied that the provision regarding Common Schools meant\r\nanything more than equal educational privileges, and that the Courts\r\nwould so decide. That it would never do to allow women to vote, for\r\nonly vile women would go to the polls. And now, added the old\r\ngentleman, \"I would like to hear what Mrs. Nichols has to say on this\r\npoint?\" Taking counsel only of my indignation, I replied: \"Mrs.\r\nNichols has to say, that vile men who seek out vile women elsewhere,\r\nmay better meet them at the polls under the eyes of good men and good\r\nwomen:\" and dropped into my seat 'mid a perfect storm of applause, in\r\nwhich women joined as heartily as men.\r\n\r\nPolicy restrained the few Republican members who had voted against the\r\nprovisions[24] from open opposition, and the more that everywhere\r\nDemocrats, whom I appealed to as \"friends in political disguise,\"\r\ntreated me with marked courtesy; often contributing to my expenses.\r\nOne such remarked, \"There, Mrs. Nichols, is a Democratic half-dollar;\r\nI like your Woman's Rights.\"\r\n\r\nAt Troy, Don. Co., sitting behind the closed shutters of an open\r\nwindow, I heard outside a debate between Republicans and Democrats.\r\nOne of the latter, an ex-Secretary of the Territory, at one time\r\nacting Governor, and a member of the Constitutional Convention, who\r\nhad dwelt much on the superior prerogatives of the Anglo-Saxon race,\r\nwas saying, \"You go for political equality with the negro; we\r\nDemocrats won't stand that, it would demoralize the white man.\" On my\r\nway to lecture in the evening, a friend forewarned me that the\r\nex-Secretary, with two or three of his political stripe, had engaged a\r\nshrewd Democratic lawyer, by getting him half drunk, to reply to me.\r\nSo when in my concluding appeal I turned as usual to the Democrats, I\r\nnarrated the above incident and bowed smilingly to the ex-Secretary,\r\nwith whom I was acquainted, and said, \"Gentlemen who turn up their\r\n'Anglo-Saxon' noses at the idea of 'political equality with the\r\nnegro,' as demoralizing to the white man, forget that in all these\r\nyears the white woman has been 'on a political equality with the\r\nnegro'; they forget, that in keeping their own mothers, wives and\r\ndaughters in the negro pew, to save them from demoralization by\r\npolitical equality with the white man, they are paying themselves a\r\nsorry compliment.\" The drunken lawyer was quietly hustled out by his\r\nfriends, the Democrats themselves joining the audience in expressions\r\nof respect at the close of my lecture. But these from hundreds of\r\ntelling incidents must suffice to initiate you in the spirit of that\r\never memorable campaign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLARINA HOWARD NICHOLS (with autograph).]\r\n\r\nIn 1854, when I was about leaving Vermont for Kansas, an earnest\r\nfriend of our cause protested that I was \"going to bury myself in\r\nKansas, just as I had won an influence and awakened a public sentiment\r\nthat assured the success of our demand for equal rights.\" I replied\r\nthat it was a thousand times more difficult to procure the repeal of\r\nunjust laws in an old State, than the adoption of just laws in the\r\norganization of a new State. That I could accomplish more for woman,\r\neven the women of the old States, and with less effort, in the new\r\nState of Kansas, than I could in conservative old Vermont, whose\r\nprejudices were so much stronger than its convictions, that justice to\r\nwomen must stand a criminal trial in every Court of the State to win,\r\nand then pay the costs.\r\n\r\nMy husband went to Kansas for a milder climate; my sons to make homes\r\nunder conditions better suited than the old States to their tastes and\r\nmeans. I went to work for a Government of \"equality, liberty,\r\nfraternity,\" in the State to be.\r\n\r\nI had learned from my experience with the legal fraternity, that as a\r\nprofession they were dead-weights on our demands, and the reason why.\r\nWhen pressed to logical conclusions, which they were always quick to\r\nsee, and in fair proportion to admit, were in our favor, they almost\r\ninvariably retreated under the plea that the reforms we asked \"being\r\nfundamental, would destroy the harmony of the statutes!\" And I had\r\ncome to the conclusion that it would cost more time and effort to\r\ndisrupt the woman's \"disabilities\" attachment from the legal and\r\npolitical harmonicons of the old States, than it would to secure\r\nvantage ground for legal and political equality in the new. I believed\r\nthen and believe now that Woman Suffrage would have received a\r\nmajority vote in Kansas if it could have been submitted unembarrassed\r\nby the possibility of its being made a pretext for keeping Kansas out\r\nof the Union. And but for Judge Kingman, I believe it would have\r\nreceived the vote of a majority in convention. He played upon the old\r\nharmonicon, \"organic law,\" and \"the harmony of the statutes.\"\r\n\r\nMy pleas before the Constitutional Convention and the people, were for\r\nequal legal and political rights for women. In detail I asked:\r\n\r\n1st. Equal educational rights and privileges in all the schools and\r\ninstitutions of learning fostered or controlled by the State.\r\n\r\n2d. An equal right in all matters pertaining to the organization and\r\nconduct of the Common Schools.\r\n\r\n3d. Recognition of the mother's equal right with the father to the\r\ncontrol and custody of their mutual offspring.\r\n\r\n4th. Protection in person, property, and earnings for married women\r\nand widows the same as for men.\r\n\r\nThe first three were fully granted. In the final reading. Kingman\r\nchanged the wording of the fourth, so as to leave the Legislature a\r\nchance to preserve the infamous common law right to personal services.\r\nThere were too many old lawyers in the Convention. The Democracy had\r\nfour or five who pulled with Kingman, or he with them against us. Not\r\na Democrat put his name to the Constitution when adopted.\r\n\r\nThe debate published in the Wyandotte _Gazette_ of July 13, 1859, on\r\ngranting Mrs. Nichols a hearing in the Constitutional Convention, and\r\nthe Committee's report on the Woman's Petition, furnishes a page of\r\nhistory of which some of the actors, at least, will have no reason to\r\nread with special pride.\r\n\r\n    REPORT OF JUDICIARY FRANCHISE COMMITTEE ON WOMAN SUFFRAGE PETITIONS.\r\n\r\n     The Committee on the Judiciary, to whom in connection with the\r\n     Committee on Franchise was referred the petition of sundry\r\n     citizens of Kansas, \"protesting against any constitutional\r\n     distinctions based on difference of sex,\" have had the same under\r\n     consideration, and beg leave to make the following report:\r\n\r\n     Your Committee concede the point in the petition upon which the\r\n     right is claimed, that \"the women of the State have individually\r\n     an evident common interest with its men in the protection of\r\n     life, liberty, property, and intellectual culture, and are not\r\n     disposed to deny, that sex involves greater and more complex\r\n     responsibilities, but the Committee are compelled to dissent from\r\n     conclusion of petition; they think the rights of women are safe\r\n     in present hands. The proof that they are so is found in the\r\n     growing disposition on the part of different Legislatures to\r\n     extend and protect their rights of property, and in the\r\n     enlightened and progressive spirit of the age which acts gently,\r\n     but efficiently upon the legislation of the day. Such rights as\r\n     are natural are now enjoyed as fully by women as men. Such rights\r\n     and duties as are merely political they should be relieved from,\r\n     that they may have more time to attend to those greater and more\r\n     complicated responsibilities which petitioners claim, and which\r\n     your Committee admit devolves upon woman.\r\n\r\n     All of which is respectfully submitted.\r\n\r\n          SAM. A. KINGMAN, GEO. H. LILLIE, P. S. PARKS, JOHN P. SLOUGH,\r\n            SAM. A. STINSON, JOHN F. BURNS, J. D. GREER, G. BLUNT,\r\n            BEN. WRIGLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSOURI.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1858, having arranged my home affairs, I set about\r\nthe prosecution of a plan for widening the area of woman's work and\r\ninfluence on the Missouri border. Separated only by the steam-plowed\r\nriver from my Kansas home, Missouri towns and hamlets lay invitingly\r\nbefore me. For more than three years I had held my opportunity in\r\nreserve. The time to improve it seemed to have come.\r\n\r\nWhen our company landed at Kansas City, October, 1854, members of a\r\nMissouri delegation opposed to the Free State emigration to that\r\nTerritory met us. More than half the company that preceded ours had\r\nbeen turned back by their representations without a look at the\r\nterritory. As our boat touched the landing, Col. Scott, of St. Joseph,\r\nstepped on board, and commenced questioning Hon. E. M. Thurston, of\r\nMaine, who, as Committee of Arrangements for the transfer of the\r\ncompany's baggage, excused himself, and turning to me, added: \"Here,\r\nsir, is a lady who can give you the information you desire--Mrs.\r\nNichols, editor of the _Windham County Democrat_.\" In accepting the\r\nintroduction, I caught the surprised and quizzical survey of a pair of\r\nkeen, black eyes, culminating in an unmistakable expression of\r\nhumorous anticipation; and, certain that my interviewer was\r\nintelligent and a gentleman, I resolved to follow his lead in kind.\r\n\"Madam,\" he inquired, \"can you tell me where all these people are\r\nfrom, and where they are going?\" They are from the New England States,\r\nand are going to Kansas. \"And what are they going to do in Kansas?\"\r\nMake homes and surround themselves with the institutions, social and\r\npolitical, to which they are accustomed. \"But, madam, they can't make\r\nhomes on the Kansas prairies with free labor; it is impossible!\"\r\n\r\nWhy, sir, our ancestors felled the primitive forests and cleared the\r\nground to grow their bread, but Kansas prairies are ready for the\r\nplow; their rank grasses invite the flocks and herds. Do you know what\r\na country we come from? did you never hear how in New Hampshire and\r\nVermont the sheeps' noses have to be sharpened, so that they can pluck\r\nthe spires of grass from between the rocks?\r\n\r\nWith a humorous, give-it-up sort of laugh, he remarked, abruptly: \"You\r\nare an editor; do you ever lecture?\" Sometimes I do. \"On what\r\nsubjects?\" Education, Temperance, Woman's Rights--\"Oh, woman's rights!\r\nWill you go to St. Joseph and lecture on woman's rights? Our people\r\nare all anxious to hear on that subject.\" Why, sir, I am an\r\nAbolitionist, and they would tar and feather me! \"You don't say\r\nanything about slavery in your woman's rights' lectures, do you?\" No,\r\nsir; I never mix things.\r\n\r\nAfter a sharp, but good natured tilt on the slavery question, the\r\nColonel returned to the lecture, about which he was so evidently in\r\nearnest--guaranteeing \"a fine audience, courteous treatment, and ample\r\ncompensation\"; that I gave a promise to visit St. Joseph on my return\r\nif there should be time before the closing of navigation, a promise I\r\nwas prevented from fulfilling. And now after three years, in which the\r\nemigrants had made homes and secured them against the aggressions of\r\nthe slave power, I wrote him that if the people of St. Joseph still\r\nwished to hear, and it pleased him to renew his guarantees of aid and\r\nprotection, I was at leisure to lecture on woman's rights. His reply\r\nwas prompt; his assurances hearty. I had \"only to name the time,\" and\r\nI would find everything in readiness. That the truce-like courtesy of\r\nthe compact between us may be appreciated, I copy a postscript\r\nappended to his letter and a postscript in reply added to my note of\r\nappointment; with the explanation, that in our Kansas City interview,\r\nthe Colonel had declared the negro incapable of education, and that\r\nemancipation would result in amalgamation.\r\n\r\nPostscript No. 1.--Have you tried your experiment of education on any\r\nlittle nigger yet?                                              J. S.\r\n\r\nPostscript No. 2.--No, I have not tried my educational experiment, for\r\nthe reason that the horrid amalgamationists preceded us, and so\r\nbleached the \"niggers\" that I have not been able to find a pure-blood\r\nspecimen.                                                 C. I. H. N.\r\n\r\nThe subject of slavery was not again mentioned between us. And when we\r\nshook hands in the cabin of the steamer at parting, he remarked, with\r\na manly frankness in grateful contrast with the covert contempt felt,\r\nrather than expressed, in his previous courtesies, that he thought it\r\nproper I should know, that my audiences, composed of the most\r\nintelligent and respectable people of St. Joseph, were pleased with my\r\nlectures. One of its most eminent citizens had said to him, that he\r\n\"had not thought of the subject in the light presented, but he really\r\ncould see no objection to women voting.\"\r\n\r\nOnly one lecture had been proposed. By a vote of my audience I gave a\r\nsecond, and had reason to feel that I had effectually broken ground in\r\nMissouri; that I had not only won a respectful consideration for\r\nwoman's cause and its advocacy, but improved my opportunity to\r\nvindicate New England training, in face of Southern prejudices. One\r\nlittle episode, as rich in its significance, as in the inspiration it\r\ncommunicated, will serve to round out my St. Joseph experience.\r\n\r\nIn introducing me to my audience, the Colonel--remembering, perhaps,\r\nthat I did not \"mix things,\" or feeling that he might trust my\r\nconsciousness of being cornered on the slavery question--remarked in a\r\nvein of courteously concealed irony: \"It looks very strange to us for\r\na lady to speak in public, but we must remember that in the section of\r\ncountry from which this lady comes, the necessity of self-support\r\nbears equally upon women, and crowds them out of domestic life into\r\nvocations more congenial to the sterner sex. Happily our domestic\r\ninstitutions, by relieving women of the necessity to labor, protect\r\nthem in the sacred privacy of home.\"\r\n\r\nIn his ignorance of the subject, my friend had unwittingly resined the\r\nbow. In bringing his \"domestic institution\" to the front, he had so\r\n\"mixed things,\" that in my showing of the legal disabilities of women,\r\nof the _no_-right of the white wife and mother to herself, her\r\nchildren, and her earnings, my audience could not fail to appreciate\r\nthe anomalous character of a \"protection\" so pathetically suggestive\r\nof the legal level of the slave woman, to which man, in his greed of\r\nwealth and power, had \"crowded\" both.\r\n\r\nSome months later, at the breakfast-table of a Missouri River steamer,\r\na gentleman of St. Joseph recognized me, and reported my lectures to\r\nex-Governor Rollins, who was also on board, and asked an introduction.\r\nAfter a long and pleasant discussion with the Governor, who entered at\r\nonce upon the subject, in its legal, political, and educational\r\naspects, it was agreed that I should lecture at my earliest\r\nconvenience in several of the principal towns of the State, the\r\ncapital included; the Governor himself proposing to communicate with\r\ninfluential citizens to make the necessary arrangements.\r\n\r\nAn early compliance with my promise was prevented by the Kansas\r\nmovement for a constitutional convention; my connection with which\r\nleft me no leisure till late in the autumn, when I commenced my\r\nproposed lecture course in Missouri by an appointment at Westport, by\r\narrangement of a gentleman of that place, whose acquaintance I had\r\nmade in my Kansas campaign. Arrived at the Westport hotel, where my\r\nentertainment had been bespoken, I was taken by the landlady to her\r\nown cosy sitting-room, and made pleasantly at home. Later in the day I\r\nbecame aware of considerable excitement in the bar-room and street of\r\nthe town. The landlord held several hurried consultations with his\r\nwife in the ante-room. My dinner was served in the private room, it\r\n\"being more pleasant,\" my hostess said, \"than eating at the public\r\ntable with a lot of strange men.\" An hour after time, the gentleman\r\nwho was to call for myself and the landlady, announced an assembly of\r\na \"dozen rude boys,\" and that in consequence of the news of John\r\nBrown's raid at Harper's Ferry (of which I had not before heard), the\r\nexcitement was such that he could not persuade the ladies to come out.\r\nWith some hesitation he added, that it \"had even been suggested that I\r\nmight be an emissary or accomplice, in what was suspected to be a\r\ngeneral and preconcerted abolition movement.\" This explained the\r\nquestionings of my hostess, and the provision against any possible\r\nrudeness which I might have received from the \"strange men\" at the\r\npublic table. Thus ended my projected campaign in Missouri. For every\r\ncity and hamlet in the State was so haunted by the marching spirit of\r\nthe Kansas hero, that to have suggested a lecture on any subject from\r\na known Abolitionist, would have ruined the political prospects of\r\neven an ex-Governor.\r\n\r\nThree years later, assisted by a former resident of Kansas, I lectured\r\nto a very small, but respectful audience in Kansas City; and in the\r\nspring of 1867 was invited by a committee of ladies to lecture at a\r\nFair of the Congregational Society of that city, with accompanying\r\nassurances from the pastor and his wife, of their confidence in the\r\nsalutary influence of such a lecture, on a community which had been\r\nrecently treated to an unfriendly presentation of the woman's rights\r\nmovement and its advocates. I was too ill at the time to leave home,\r\nbut the difference between my anxious efforts three years before to be\r\nheard, and this more than cordial assurance of a waiting audience, was\r\na happy tonic. It was from persons who knew me only through my\r\nadvocacy of woman's equality, and evidenced the progress of our cause.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1854, on my return from Kansas to Vermont, I spent\r\nseveral days in St. Louis, in the pleasant family of my friend, Mrs.\r\nFrances D. Gage, who, very much to my regret, was away in Illinois.\r\nThe Judge having recently removed to the city, the family were\r\ncomparatively strangers; Abolitionists in a pro-slavery community.\r\nMrs. Gage, I think, had broken ground for temperance, but they could\r\ntell me of no friends to woman's rights. Rev. Mr. Elliot was not then\r\none of us, as I learned through a son of Mrs. Gage, who called on him\r\nin my behalf for the use of his lecture-room. I felt instinctively\r\nthat, unfettered by home and business interests, I was less\r\nconstrained than my friend, and resolved, if possible, to win a\r\nhearing for woman. Having secured a hall, I called at the business\r\noffice of a gentleman of wealth and high social position--a\r\nslave-holder and opposed to free Kansas, with whom I had formed a\r\nspeaking acquaintance in Brattleboro'--and procured from him a voucher\r\nfor my respectability. Armed with this I called on the editors of the\r\n_Republican_ (pro-slavery), and secured a paid notice of my lecture.\r\nThe editor of the _Democrat_, who had an interest in free Kansas, and\r\nwas glad of news items from its immigrants, received me cordially, and\r\ngave the \"lady lecturer\" a handsome \"personal,\" though he had no more\r\ninterest in my subject than either of the other gentlemen, and gave me\r\nlittle encouragement of an audience. Nevertheless, when the evening\r\ncame, I met an audience intelligent and respectful, and larger than I\r\nhad ventured to expect, but not numerous enough to warrant the venture\r\nof a second lecture in the expensive hall, which from the refusal of\r\nchurch lecture-rooms, I had been obliged to occupy. But here, as often\r\nbefore and after, a good Providence interposed. Rev. Mr. Weaver,\r\nUniversalist, claimed recognition as \"a reader in his boyhood of Mrs.\r\nNichols' paper\"--his father was a patron of the _Windham County\r\nDemocrat_--and tendered the use of his church for further lectures. I\r\nhad found a friend of the cause. The result was a full house, and\r\nhearty appeals for \"more.\"\r\n\r\nAs isolated, historical facts, how very trivial all these\r\n\"reminiscences\" appear! How egotistical the pen that presumes upon\r\nanything like a popular interest in their perusal! But to the social\r\nand political reformer, as to the Kanes and Livingstons, trifles teach\r\nthe relations of things, and indicate the methods and courses of\r\naction that result in world-wide good or evil. Seeds carried by the\r\nwinds and waves plant forests and beautify the waste places of the\r\nearth. Truths that flowed from the silent nib of my pen in Vermont,\r\nhad been garnered in a boy's sympathies to yield me a man's welcome\r\nand aid in St. Louis. How clear the lesson, that for seed-sowing, all\r\nseasons belong to God's truth!\r\n\r\nThe autumn and winter of 1860-61 I spent in Wisconsin and Ohio; in\r\nWisconsin, visiting friends and lecturing. In Ohio, Mrs. Frances D.\r\nGage, Mrs. Hannah Tracy Cutler, and myself were employed under\r\ndirection of Mrs. Elizabeth Jones, of Salem, to canvass the State,\r\nlecturing and procuring names to petitions to the Legislature for\r\nequal legal and political rights for the women of the State. The time\r\nchosen for this work was inopportune for immediate success--the\r\nopening scenes of the rebellion alike absorbing the attention of the\r\npeople and their Legislature. Women in goodly numbers came out to\r\nhear, but men of all classes waited in the streets, or congregated in\r\npublic places to hear the news and discuss the political situation.\r\n\r\nFrom December, 1863, to March, 1866, I was in Washington, D. C.,\r\nwriting in the Military or Revenue Departments, or occupying the\r\nposition of Matron in the Home for Colored Orphans, which had been\r\nopened in the second year of the rebellion, by the help of the\r\nGovernment and the untiring energy of a few noble women intent on\r\nsaving the helpless waifs of slavery cast by thousands upon the bare\r\nsands of military freedom.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1867, the Legislature of Kansas having submitted to\r\nthe voters of the State a woman suffrage amendment to its\r\nConstitution, I gave some four weeks to the canvass, which was engaged\r\nin by some of the ablest friends of the cause from other States, among\r\nthem Lucy Stone, Rev. Olympia Brown, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan\r\nB. Anthony. In our own State, among others, Governor Robinson, John\r\nRitchie, and S. N. Wood of the old Free State Guard, rallied to the\r\nwork. With the canvass of Atchison and Jefferson Counties, and a few\r\nlectures in Douglass, Shawnee, and Osage Counties, I retired from a\r\nfield overlaid with happy reminders of past trials merged in present\r\nblessings. The work was in competent hands, but the time was\r\nill-chosen on account of the political complications with negro\r\nsuffrage, and failure was the result.\r\n\r\nSince December, 1871, my home has been in California, where family\r\ncares and the infirmities of age limit my efforts for a freer and a\r\nnobler humanity to the pen. Trusting that love of God and man will\r\never point it with truth and justice, I close this _exposé_ of my\r\npublic life.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] Mrs. Nichols had written up a case occurring among the\r\nsubscribers to the _Democrat_, in which $500, the whole estate, was\r\ndivided, the half of that amount being all the law allowed for the\r\nsupport of a woman, then in the decline of life, and sent fifty marked\r\ncopies of the paper to members of the Legislature elect. One of them\r\nintroduced the bill, which passed the first day of the session.\r\n\r\n[23] The violent throbbing of Mrs. Nichols' heart, caused by her\r\nunusual position and her intense anxiety that her plea might be\r\nsuccessful, had stopped her speaking at the close of a brief preface\r\nto her plea. She, however, soon rallied, though her voice was\r\ntremulous throughout, from the conviction that only an eminently\r\nsuccessful presentation of her subject, could spike the enemy's\r\nbatteries and win a verdict of \"just and womanly.\" Mrs. Nichols hoped\r\nno further than that. She did not expect conservative Vermont to yield\r\nat once for what she asked, as she stood alone with her paper among\r\nthe press; and there was no other advocate in the State to take the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n[24] The head and front of the opposition was Judge Kingman, Chairman\r\nof the Judiciary Committee, to which, with the Committee on Elections,\r\nmy petition was referred. He wrote the Report against granting our\r\ndemand, and of those who signed it all but (Gen.) Blunt and himself\r\nwere Democrats. The report was adopted by a solid vote of the\r\nDemocrats (16), and enough Republicans to make a majority. Thirty-six\r\nRepublicans and 16 Democrats comprised the whole delegation. If my\r\nmemory is not at fault, 27 Republicans voted in caucus for the\r\nprovisions which were ultimately carried in our behalf, which was a\r\nmajority of the whole Convention. In caucus a majority were in favor\r\nof political rights; but only a minority, from conviction that Woman\r\nSuffrage would prevent admission to the Union, would vote it in\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Women in the Revolution--Anti-Tea Leagues--Phillis\r\n     Wheatley--Mistress Anne Hutchinson--Heroines in the Slavery\r\n     Conflict--Women Voting under the Colonial Charter--Mary Upton\r\n     Ferrin Petitions the Legislature in 1848--Woman's Rights\r\n     Conventions in 1850, '51--Letter of Harriet Martineau from\r\n     England--Letter of Jeannie Deroine from a Prison Cell in\r\n     Paris--Editorial from _The Christian Inquirer_--_The Una_, edited\r\n     by Paulina Wright Davis--Constitutional Convention in\r\n     1853--Before the Legislature in 1857--Harriet K.

Their patriotism was not only shown in the\r\npolitical plans of Mercy Otis Warren,[25] and the sagacious counsels\r\nof Abigail Smith Adams, but by the action of many other women whose\r\nnames history has not preserved. It was a woman who sent Paul Revere\r\non his famous ride from Boston to Concord, on the night of April 18,\r\n1775, to warn the inhabitants of the expected invasion of the British\r\non the morrow. The church bells pealing far and near on the midnight\r\nair, roused tired sleepers hurriedly to arm themselves against the\r\ninvaders of their homes.\r\n\r\nDuring the war two women of Concord dressed in men's clothing,\r\ncaptured a spy bearing papers which proved of the utmost importance to\r\nthe patriot forces.\r\n\r\nDuring these early days, the women of various Colonies--Virginia, New\r\nYork, Rhode Island, Massachusetts--formed Anti-Tea Leagues. In\r\nProvidence, R. I., young ladies took the initiative; twenty-nine\r\ndaughters of prominent families, meeting under the shade of the\r\nsycamore trees at Roger Williams' spring, there resolving to drink no\r\nmore tea until the duty upon it was repealed. The name of one of these\r\nyoung ladies, Miss Coddington, has been preserved, to whose house they\r\nall adjourned to partake of a frugal repast; hyperion[26] taking the\r\nplace of the hated bohea. In Newport, at a gathering of ladies, where\r\nboth hyperion and bohea were offered, every lady present refused the\r\nhated bohea, emblem of political slavery. In Boston, early in 1769,\r\nthe matrons of three hundred families bound themselves to use no more\r\ntea until the tax upon it was taken off. The young ladies also entered\r\ninto a similar covenant, declaring they took this step, not from\r\npersonal motives, but from a sense of patriotism and a regard for\r\nposterity.[27] Liberty, as alone making life of value, looked as sweet\r\nto them as to their fathers. The Women's Anti-Tea Leagues of Boston\r\nwere formed nearly five years previous to the historic \"Boston Tea\r\nParty,\" when men disguised as Indians, threw the East India Company's\r\ntea overboard, and six years before the declaration of war.\r\n\r\nAmerican historians ignoring woman after man's usual custom, have\r\nneglected to mention the fact that every paper in Boston was suspended\r\nduring its invasion by the British, except the chief rebel newspapers\r\nof New England, _The Massachusetts Gazette_ and _North Boston\r\nNews-Letter_, owned and edited by a woman, Margaret Draper.\r\n\r\nThey make small note of Women's Anti-Tea Leagues, and the many\r\ninstances of their heroism during the Revolutionary period, equaling,\r\nas they did, any deeds of self-sacrifice and bravery that man himself\r\ncan boast.\r\n\r\nThe men of Boston, in 1773, could with little loss to themselves,\r\nthrow overboard a cargo of foreign tea, well knowing that for the last\r\nfive years this drink had not been allowed in their houses by the\r\nwomen of their own families. Their reputation for patriotism was thus\r\ncheaply earned in destroying what did not belong to them and what was\r\nof no use to them. Their wives, daughters, mothers, and sisters drank\r\nraspberry, sage, and birch, lest by the use of foreign tea they should\r\nhelp rivet the chains of oppression upon their country. Why should not\r\nthe American Revolution have been successful, when women so nobly\r\nsustained republican principles, taking the initiative in\r\nself-sacrifice and pointing the path to man by patriotic example.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts, as in other States, were also formed associations\r\nknown as \"Daughters of Liberty.\"[28] These organizations did much to\r\nfan the nascent flames of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe first naval battle of the Revolution was fought at Machias, Maine,\r\nthen a part of Massachusetts. An insult having been offered its\r\ninhabitants, by a vessel in the harbor, the men of the surrounding\r\ncountry joined with them to avenge this indignity to their \"Liberty\r\nTree,\" arming themselves, from scarcity of powder, with scythes,\r\npitchforks, and other implements of peace. At a settlement some twenty\r\nmiles distant, a quantity of powder was discovered, after the men had\r\nleft for Machias. What was to be done, was the immediate question.\r\nEvery able-bodied man had already left, only small boys and men too\r\naged or too infirm for battle having remained at home. Upon that\r\npowder reaching them the defeat of the British, might depend. In this\r\nemergency the heroism of woman was shown. Two young girls, Hannah and\r\nRebecca Weston, volunteered their services. It was no holiday\r\nexcursion for them, but a trip filled with unseen dangers. The way led\r\nthrough a trackless forest, the route merely indicated by blazed\r\ntrees. Bears, wolves, and wild-cats were numerous. The distance was\r\nimpossible to be traversed in a single day; these young girls must\r\nspend the night in that dreary wilderness. Worse than danger from wild\r\nanimals, was that to be apprehended from Indians, who might kill them,\r\nor capture and bear them away to some distant tribe. But undauntedly\r\nthey set out on their perilous journey, carrying twenty pounds of\r\npowder. They reached Machias in safety, before the attack on the\r\nBritish ship, finding their powder a most welcome and effective aid in\r\nthe victory which soon crowned the arms of the Colonists. The heroism\r\nof these young girls was far greater than if they had fought in the\r\nranks, surrounded by companions,'mid the accompaniments of beating\r\ndrums, waving flags, and all the paraphernalia of war.\r\n\r\nIn the war of 1812 two young girls of Scituate, Rebecca and Abigail W.\r\nBates, by their wit and sagacity, prevented the landing of the enemy\r\nat this point.[29] Congress, during its session of 1880, nearly\r\nseventy years afterward, granted them pensions, just as from extreme\r\nage they were about to drop into the grave.\r\n\r\nThough it is not considered important to celebrate the virtues of the\r\nPilgrim Mothers in gala days, grand dinners, toasts, and speeches, yet\r\na little retrospection would enable us to exhume from the past, many\r\nof their achievements worth recording. More facts than we have space\r\nto reproduce, testify to the heroism, religious zeal, and literary\r\nindustry of the women who helped to build up the early civilization of\r\nNew England. Their writings, for some presumed on authorship, are\r\nquaint and cumbrous; but in those days, when few men published books,\r\nit required marked courage for women to appear in print at all. They\r\nimitated the style popular among men, and received much attention for\r\ntheir literary ability. Charles T. Congdon, as the result of his\r\nexplorations through old book-stores, has brought to light some of\r\nthese early writers.\r\n\r\nIn 1630, Mrs. Anne Bradstreet, known as quite a pretentious writer,\r\ncame to Boston with her husband, Simon Bradstreet, Governor of\r\nMassachusetts. Her first work was entitled \"The Tenth Muse lately\r\nsprung up in America.\" The first edition was published in London in\r\n1650, and the first Boston edition was published in 1678. If Mrs.\r\nBradstreet loved praise, she was fortunate in her time and position.\r\nIt would have been in bad taste, as it would have been bad policy, not\r\nto eulogize the poems of the Governor's wife. She was frequently\r\ncomplimented in verse as bad as her own. Her next great epic was\r\nentitled \"A Complete Discourse and Description of the Four Elements,\r\nConstitutions, Ages of Man, Seasons of the Year, together with an\r\nexact epitome of the Four Monarchies, viz: the Assyrian, Persian,\r\nGrecian, and Roman.\" \"Glad as we were,\" says the owner, \"to obtain\r\nthis book at a considerable price, we are still gladder of the\r\nprivilege of closing it.\" Although this lady had eight children, about\r\nwhom she wrote some amusing rhymes, she found time in the wilds of\r\nAmerica to perpetuate also these ponderous-titled poems.\r\n\r\nPhillis Wheatly, a colored girl, also wrote poetry in Colonial Boston,\r\nyears before our Declaration of Independence startled the world. She\r\nwas brought from Africa, and sold in the slave market of Boston, when\r\nonly six years old. Mr. Sparks, the biographer of Washington, thinks\r\n\"that the poems contained in her published volume, exhibit the most\r\nfavorable evidence on record, of the capacity of the African intellect\r\nfor improvement.\" When the Rev. George Whitefield died, at\r\nNewburyport, Mass., in 1770, the same writer from whom we quote these\r\nfacts, says: \"It was quite natural, his demise being much talked of in\r\nreligious families, that our sable Phillis should burst into monody.\r\nThat expression of grief I have before me. Of the most rhetorical\r\npreacher of his age, it is not inspiring to read:\r\n\r\n    \"He prayed that grace in every heart might dwell.\r\n    He louged to see America excel.\"\r\n\r\nPhillis married badly, and died at the age of thirty-one, in 1784,\r\nutterly impoverished, leaving three little children. Her own copy of\r\nher poems is in the library of Harvard College. When she died it was\r\nsold for her husband's debts.\r\n\r\nIn a letter thanking her for an acrostic on himself, General\r\nWashington said: \"If you should ever come to Cambridge, or near\r\nheadquarters, I shall be happy to see a person so gifted by the muses,\r\nand to whom Nature has been so liberal and beneficent in her\r\ndispensations.\"\r\n\r\nWas there ever any story, which had such a hold upon the readers of a\r\ngeneration, as \"Charlotte Temple\"? It is said 25,000 copies were sold\r\nsoon after publication--an enormous sale for that day. Mrs. Rowson,\r\nwho wrote the book, was a daughter of a lieutenant in the Royal Navy;\r\nshe was an actress in Philadelphia, and afterward kept a school in\r\nBoston for young ladies, where she died, in 1824. Her seminary was\r\nhighly recommended.\r\n\r\nWomen in the last age naturally drifted into the didactic. They should\r\nhave the credit of trying always to be useful. They go through so many\r\npages, seeking to give the little people some notion of botany, of\r\nnatural history, of other branches of human intelligence. There is no\r\nbook cleverer in its way than Miss Hannah Adams' \"History of New\r\nEngland,\" of which the second edition was published in Boston in\r\n1807. The object of this lady was, as she tells us in the preface, \"to\r\nimpress the minds of young persons with veneration for those eminent\r\nmen to whom their posterity are so highly indebted.\" All the tradition\r\nis that Miss Adams was a wonderfully learned lady. She is best known\r\nby her \"History of the Jews.\" She wrote pretty good English, of which\r\nthis may be considered a specimen: \"Exalted from a feeble state to\r\nopulence and independence, the Federal Americans are now recognized as\r\na nation throughout the globe.\" To a sentence so admirably formed,\r\npossibly there is nothing to add.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISTRESS ANNE HUTCHINSON.\r\n\r\nMistress Anne Hutchinson, founder of the Antinomian party of New\r\nEngland, was a woman who exerted great influence upon the religious\r\nand political free thought of those colonies. She was the daughter of\r\nan English clergyman, and with her husband, followed Pastor Cotton, to\r\nwhom she was much attached, to this country in 1634, and was admitted\r\na member of the Boston church, becoming a resident of Massachusetts\r\none hundred and forty years before the Revolutionary war. She was of\r\ncommanding intellect, and exerted a powerful influence upon the infant\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nIt was a long established custom for the brethren of the Boston church\r\nto hold, through the week, frequent public meetings for religious\r\nexercises. Women were prohibited from taking part in these meetings,\r\nwhich chafed the free spirit of Mistress Hutchinson, and soon she\r\ncalled meetings of the sisters, where she repeated the sermons of the\r\nLord's day, making comments upon them. Her illustrations of Scripture\r\nwere so new and striking that the meetings were rendered more\r\ninteresting to the women than any they had attended. At first the\r\nclergy approved, but as the men attracted by the fame of her\r\ndiscourses, crowded into her meetings, they began to perceive danger\r\nto their authority; the church was passing out of their control. Her\r\ndoctrines, too, were alarming. She taught the indwelling of the Holy\r\nSpirit in each believer, its inward revelations, and that the\r\nconscious judgment of the mind should be the paramount authority. She\r\nwas the first woman in America to demand the right of individual\r\njudgment upon religious questions. Her influence was very great, yet\r\nshe was not destined to escape the charge of heresy.\r\n\r\nThe first Synod in America was called upon her account. It convened\r\nAugust 30, 1637, sat three weeks, and proclaimed eighty-two errors\r\nextant; among them the tenets taught by Mistress Hutchinson. She was\r\ncalled before the church and ordered to retract upon twenty-nine\r\npoints. The infant colony was shaken by this discussion, which took on\r\na political aspect.[30] Mistress Hutchinson remained steadfast, and\r\nwas sustained by many important people, among whom was the young\r\nGovernor Vane.\r\n\r\nChurch and State became united in their opposition to Mistress Anne\r\nHutchinson. The fact that she presumed to teach men, was prominently\r\nbrought up, and in November, 1637, she was arbitrarily tried before\r\nthe Massachusetts General Court upon a joint charge of sedition and\r\nheresy. She was examined for two days by the Governor and prominent\r\nmembers of the clergy. The Boston Church, which knew her worth,\r\nsustained her, with the exception of five members, one of them the\r\nassociate pastor, Wilson. But the country churches and clergy were\r\nagainst her, and she was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment and\r\nbanishment.\r\n\r\nAs the winter was very severe, she was allowed to remain in Roxbury\r\nuntil spring, when she joined Roger Williams in Rhode Island, where\r\nshe helped form a body-politic, democratic in principle, in which no\r\none was \"accounted delinquent for doctrine.\" Mistress Hutchinson thus\r\nhelped to dissever Church and State, and to found religious freedom in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nAfter her residence in Rhode Island, four men were sent to reclaim\r\nher, but she would not return. Upon the death of her husband she\r\nmoved, for greater security, to \"The Dutch Colony,\" and died somewhere\r\nin the State of New York.\r\n\r\nThus, through the protracted struggle of the American Colonies for\r\nreligious and political freedom, woman bravely shared the dangers and\r\npersecutions of those eventful years. As spy in the enemy's camp;\r\nmessenger on the battle-field; soldier in disguise; defender of\r\nherself and children in the solitude of those primeval forests;\r\nimprisoned for heresy; burned, hung, drowned as a witch: what\r\nsuffering and anxiety has she not endured! what lofty heroism has she\r\nnot exemplified!\r\n\r\nAnd when the crusade against slavery in our republic was inaugurated\r\nin 1830, another Spartan band of women stood ready for the battle, and\r\nthe storm of that fierce conflict, surpassing in courage, moral\r\nheroism, and conscientious devotion to great principles, all that\r\nwoman in any age had done or dared. With reverent lips we mention the\r\nnames of Sarah and Angelina Grimke, Lydia Maria Child, Maria Weston\r\nChapman, Mary S. Parker, Abby Kelly, whose burning words of rebuke\r\naroused a sleeping nation to a new-born love of liberty. To their\r\nbrave deeds, pure lives, and glowing eloquence, we pay our tributes of\r\nesteem and admiration.\r\n\r\nTo such as these let South Carolina and Massachusetts build future\r\nmonuments, not in Quincy granite, or Parian marble, but in more\r\nenduring blessing to the people; inviolable homesteads for the\r\nlaborer; free schools and colleges for boys and girls, both black and\r\nwhite; justice and mercy in the alms-house, jail, prison, and the\r\nmarts of trade, thus securing equal rights to all.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN'S EARLY POLITICAL RIGHTS.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts, women voted at an early day. First, under the Old\r\nProvince Charter, from 1691 to 1780, for all elective officers;\r\nsecond, they voted under the Constitution for all elective officers\r\nexcept the Governor, Council, and Legislature, from 1780 to 1785. The\r\nBill of Rights, adopted with the Constitution of 1780, declared that\r\nall men were born free and equal. Upon this, some slaves demanded\r\ntheir freedom, and their masters yielded.[31] Restrictions upon the\r\nright of suffrage were very great in this State; church membership\r\nalone excluded for thirty years three-fourths of the male inhabitants\r\nfrom the ballot-box.[32]\r\n\r\nThat women exercised the right of suffrage amid so many restrictions,\r\nis very significant of the belief in her right to the ballot, by those\r\nearly Fathers.[33]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST STEP IN MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\nWoman's rights petitions were circulated in Massachusetts as early as\r\n1848. Mary Upton Ferrin, of Salem, in the spring of that year,\r\nconsulting Samuel Merritt, known as \"the honest lawyer of Salem,\" in\r\nregard to the property rights of married women, and the divorce laws,\r\nlearned that the whole of the wife's personal property belonged to the\r\nhusband, as also the improvements upon her real estate; and that she\r\ncould only retain her silver and other small valuables by secreting\r\nthem, or proving them to have been loaned to her. To such deception\r\ndid the laws of Massachusetts, like those of most States, based on the\r\nOld Common Law idea of the wife's subjection to the husband, compel\r\nthe married woman in case she desired to retain any portion of her own\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ferrin reported the substance of the above conversation to Mrs.\r\nPhebe King,[34] of Danvers, who at once became deeply interested,\r\nsaying, \"If such are the laws by which women are governed, every woman\r\nin the State should sign a petition to have them altered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you sign one if drawn up?\" queried Mrs. Ferrin.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Mrs. King, \"and I should think every woman would sign\r\nsuch a petition.\"\r\n\r\nAs the proper form of petitions was something with which women were\r\nthen quite unfamiliar, the aid of several gentlemen was asked, among\r\nthem Hon. D. P. King and Judge John Heartley, but all refused.\r\n\r\nMiss Betsy King then suggested that Judge Pitkin[35] possessed\r\nsufficient influence to have the laws amended without the trouble of\r\npetitioning the Legislature. Strong in their faith that the enactment\r\nof just laws was the business of legislative bodies, these ladies\r\nbelieved they but had to bring injustice to the notice of a law-maker\r\nin order to have it done away. Therefore, full of courage and hope,\r\nJudge Pitkin was respectfully approached. But, to their infinite\r\nastonishment, he replied:\r\n\r\n\"The law is very well as it is regarding the property of married\r\nwomen. Women are not capable of taking care of their own property;\r\nthey never ought to have control of it. There is already a law by\r\nwhich a woman can have her property secured to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But not one woman in fifty knows of the existence of such a law,\" was\r\nthe reply.\r\n\r\n\"They ought to know it; it is no fault of the law if they don't. I do\r\nnot think the Legislature will alter the law regarding divorce. If\r\nthey do, they will make it more stringent than it now is.\"\r\n\r\nRepulsed, but not disheartened, Mrs. Ferrin herself drew up several\r\npetitions, circulated them, obtaining many hundred signatures of old\r\nand young; though finding the young more ready to ask for change than\r\nthose inured to ill-usage and injustice. Many persons laughed at her;\r\nbut knowing it to be a righteous work, and deeming laughter healthful\r\nto those indulging in it, Mrs. Ferrin continued to circulate her\r\npetitions.\r\n\r\nThey were presented to the Legislature by Rev. John M. Usher, a\r\nUniversalist minister of Lynn, and member of the lower House. Although\r\ntoo late in the session for action, these petitions form the\r\ninitiative step for Woman Suffrage in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nEarly the next fall, similar petitions were circulated. It was\r\ndetermined to attack the Legislature in such good season, that\r\nlateness of time would not again be brought up as an excuse for\r\nnon-attention to the prayers of women. Mrs. King's interest continued\r\nunabated, and through her advice, Mrs. Ferrin prepared an address to\r\naccompany the petitions. Hon. Charles W. Upham, minister of the First\r\nUnitarian church of Salem, afterward Representative in Congress, was\r\nState Senator that year. From him they received much encouragement. \"I\r\nconcur with you in every sentiment,\" said he, \"but please re-write\r\nyour address, making two of it; one in the form of a memorial to the\r\nLegislature, and the other, an address to the Judiciary Committee, to\r\nwhom your petitions will be referred.\" These two documents will be\r\nfound to suggest most of the important demands, afterward made in\r\nevery State, for a change of laws relating to woman. The fallacy of\r\n\"sacredness\" for these restrictive laws was shown; the rights of\r\nhumanity as superior to any outside authority, asserted; and justice\r\nmade the basis of the proposed reformation. The right of woman to\r\ntrial by a jury of her peers was claimed, followed by the suggestion\r\nthat woman is capable of making the laws by which she is governed. The\r\nmemorial excited much attention, and was printed by order of the\r\nLegislature, though the possibility of a woman having written it was\r\ndenied.[36]\r\n\r\nBut in 1850, as in 1849, no action was taken, the petitioners having\r\n\"leave to withdraw.\" Petitions of a similar character were again\r\ncirculated throughout Salem and Danvers, in 1850, '51, '52, '53,\r\nmaking six successive years, in each of which the petitioners had\r\n\"leave to withdraw,\" as the only reply to their prayers for relief.\r\nThe Hon. Mr. Upham, however, remained woman's steadfast friend through\r\nall this period, and Mrs. Phebe Upton King was as constantly found\r\namong the petitioners.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 the petitions were signed only by ladies over sixty years of\r\nage, women of large experience and matured judgment, whose prayers\r\nshould have received at least respectful consideration from the\r\nlegislators of the State. We give the appeal accompanying their\r\npetition:\r\n\r\n     GENTLEMEN:--Your petitioners, who are tax-payers and originators\r\n     of these petitions, are upwards of three-score years; ten of them\r\n     are past three-score years and ten; three of them three-score and\r\n     twenty. If length of days, a knowledge of the world and the\r\n     rights of man and woman entitle them to a respectful hearing,\r\n     few, if any, have prior or more potent claims, for reason has\r\n     taught them what individual rights are, experience, what woman\r\n     and her children suffer for the want of just protection in those,\r\n     and humanity impels them once more to appear before you, it may\r\n     be for the last time. Let not their gray hairs go down in sorrow\r\n     to the grave for the want of this justice in your power to\r\n     extend, as have several of their number whose names are no longer\r\n     to be found with theirs, whose voices can plead never more in\r\n     behalf of your own children and those of your constituents.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 a petition[37] bearing only Mrs. King's name was presented. In\r\n1854 the political organization called the \"Know Nothings\" came into\r\npower, and although no petition was presented, a bill securing the\r\ncontrol of their own property to all women married subsequent to the\r\npassage of the law, was passed. The power to make a will without the\r\nhusband's consent, was also secured to wives, though not permitted to\r\nthus will more than one-half of their personal property. This law also\r\ngave to married women having no children, whose husbands should die\r\nwithout a will, five thousand dollars, and one-half of the remainder\r\nof the husband's property. The following year the Divorce Law[38] was\r\namended, and shortly thereafter two old ladies, nearly seventy years\r\nof age, having no future marriage in view, but solely influenced by a\r\ndesire to secure their own property to their own children, which\r\nwithout such divorce they would be unable to do, although one of their\r\nhusbands had not provided for his wife in twenty years, nor the other\r\nin thirty years, availed themselves of its new privileges.\r\n\r\nThe first change in the tyrannous laws of Massachusetts was really due\r\nto the work of this one woman, Mary Upton Ferrin, who for six years,\r\nafter her own quaint method, poured the hot shot of her earnest\r\nconviction of woman's wrongs into the Legislature. In circulating\r\npetitions, she traveled six hundred miles, two-thirds of this distance\r\non foot. Much money was expended besides her time and travel, and her\r\nname should be remembered as that of one of the brave pioneers in this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAlthough two thousand petitions were sent into the Constitutional\r\nConvention of 1853, from other friends of woman's enfranchisement in\r\nthe State, Mrs. Ferrin totally unacquainted with that step, herself\r\npetitioned this body for an amendment to the Constitution securing\r\njustice to women, referring to the large number of petitions sent to\r\nthe Legislature during the last few years for this object. Working as\r\nshe did, almost unaided and alone, Mrs. Ferrin is an exemplification\r\nof the dissatisfaction of women at this period with unjust laws.[39]\r\n\r\n\r\n         MRS. FERRIN'S ADDRESS TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE OF THE\r\n                   MASSACHUSETTS LEGISLATURE IN 1850.\r\n\r\n     Long have our liberties and our lives been lauded to the skies,\r\n     to our amusement and edification, and until our sex has been as\r\n     much regaled as has the Southern slave, with \"liberty and law.\"\r\n     But, says one, \"Women are free.\" So likewise are slaves free to\r\n     submit to the laws and to their masters. \"A married woman is as\r\n     much the property of her husband, likewise her goods and\r\n     chattels, as is his horse,\" says an eminent judge, and he might\r\n     have added, many of them are treated much worse. No more apt\r\n     illustration could have been given. Though man can not beat his\r\n     wife like his horse, he can kill her by abuse--the most\r\n     pernicious of slow poisons; and, alas, too often does he do it.\r\n     It is for such unfortunate ones that protection is needed.\r\n     Existing laws neither do nor can protect them, nor can society,\r\n     on account of the laws. If they were men, society would protect\r\n     and defend them. Long, silently, and patiently have they waited\r\n     until forbearance ceases to be a virtue.\r\n\r\n     Should a woman make her will without her husband's consent in\r\n     writing, it is of no use. It is as just and proper that a woman\r\n     should dispose of her own property to her own satisfaction as\r\n     that a man should dispose of his. In many cases she is as\r\n     competent, and sadly to be pitied if not in many cases more so.\r\n     And even with her husband's consent she can not bequeath to him\r\n     her real estate. She can sell it with his consent, but the deeds\r\n     must pass and be recorded, and then, if the husband pleases, he\r\n     can take the money and buy the property back again. Does justice\r\n     require that a man and his wife should use so much deception, and\r\n     be at so much unnecessary expense and trouble, to settle their\r\n     own private affairs to their own satisfaction--affairs which do\r\n     not in the least affect any other individual? Reason, humanity,\r\n     and common sense answer--No!\r\n\r\n     \"All men are created free and equal,\" and all women are born\r\n     subject to laws which they have neither the power to make or to\r\n     repeal, but which they are taxed, directly or indirectly, to\r\n     support, and many of which are a disgrace to humanity and ought\r\n     to be forthwith abolished. A woman is compelled by circumstances\r\n     to work for less than half an ordinary man can earn, and yet she\r\n     is as essential to the existence, happiness, and refinement of\r\n     society as is man.\r\n\r\n     We are told \"a great deal has already been done for woman;\" in\r\n     return we would tender our grateful acknowledgments, with the\r\n     assurance that when ours is the right, we will reciprocate the\r\n     favor. Much that has been done, does not in the least affect\r\n     those who are already married; and not one in ten of those who\r\n     are not married, will ever be apprised of the existence of the\r\n     laws by which they might be benefited. Few, if any, would marry a\r\n     man so incompetent as in their opinion to render it necessary to\r\n     avail themselves of such laws; neither would any spirited man\r\n     knowingly marry a woman who considered him so incompetent; hence,\r\n     instead of being a blessing, much labor and expense accrue to\r\n     those who desire to avail themselves of their benefit; and such a\r\n     step often induces the most bitter contention.\r\n\r\n     We are told \"the Bible does not provide for divorce except for\r\n     one offence.\" Neither does the Bible prohibit divorce for any\r\n     other justifiable cause. Inasmuch as men take the liberty to\r\n     legislate upon other subjects of which the Bible does, and does\r\n     not, take particular notice, so likewise are they equally at\r\n     liberty to legislate and improve upon this, when the state of\r\n     society demands it.... A woman who has a good husband glides\r\n     easily along under his protection, while those who have bad\r\n     husbands, of which, alas! there are too many, are not aware of\r\n     the depths of their degradation until they suddenly and\r\n     unexpectedly find themselves, through the influence of the law,\r\n     totally destitute, condemned to hopeless poverty and servitude,\r\n     with an ungrateful tyrant for a master. No respectable man with a\r\n     decent woman for a wife, will ever demean himself so much as to\r\n     insult or abuse his wife. Wherever such a state of things exists,\r\n     it is a disgrace to the age and to society, by whomsoever\r\n     practiced, encouraged, or protected, whether public or\r\n     private--whether social, political, or religious.\r\n\r\n     A very estimable and influential lady, whose property was valued\r\n     at over $150,000, married a man, in whom she had unbounded, but\r\n     misplaced confidence, as is too often the case; consequently the\r\n     most of her property was squandered through intemperance and\r\n     dissipation, before she was aware of the least wrong-doing. So\r\n     deeply was she shocked by the character of her husband, that she\r\n     soon found a premature grave, leaving several small children to\r\n     be reared and educated upon the remnant of her scattered wealth.\r\n\r\n     Nearly twelve years since, a woman of a neighboring town, whose\r\n     husband had forsaken her, hired a man to carry her furniture in a\r\n     wagon to her native place, with her family, which consisted of\r\n     her husband's mother, herself, and six children, the eldest of\r\n     which was but twelve years old. On her arrival there, she had\r\n     only food enough for one meal, and nine-pence left. During the\r\n     summer, in consequence of hardships and deprivations, she was\r\n     taken violently sick, being deprived of her reason for several\r\n     weeks. Her husband had not, as yet, appeared to offer her the\r\n     least assistance, although apprised of her situation. But, being\r\n     an uncommonly mean man, he had sold her furniture, piece by\r\n     piece, and reduced her to penury, so that nothing but the aid of\r\n     her friends and her own exertions, saved her and her family from\r\n     the alms-house.\r\n\r\n     Says the law to this heroic woman, \"What, though your property is\r\n     squandered, your health and spirits broken, and you have six\r\n     small children, besides yourself and your husband's mother to\r\n     support! After five years of incessant toil in humility and\r\n     degradation, why should not your lord and master intrude his\r\n     loathsome person, like a blood-sucker upon your vitals, never\r\n     offering you any assistance; and should your precarious life be\r\n     protracted to that extent of time, for twenty dollars you can buy\r\n     a divorce from bed and board, and have your property secured to\r\n     you. Such, Madam, is your high privilege. Complain then not to\r\n     us, lest instead of alleviating your sufferings, we strengthen\r\n     the cords that already bind you.\"\r\n\r\n     The moral courage of the \"Hero of the Battle-field\" would shrink\r\n     in horror from scenes like these; but such is the fate of woman,\r\n     to whom God grant no future \"hell.\"\r\n\r\n     In case a man receives a trifle from a departed friend or any\r\n     other source, the wife's signature is not required. Recently a\r\n     poor man left his daughter twenty dollars, of which her husband\r\n     allowed her ten, retaining the remainder for acknowledging its\r\n     receipt. It was probably the only ten dollars the woman ever\r\n     received, except for her own exertions, which were constantly\r\n     required to supply the necessities of her family, her husband\r\n     being very intemperate and abusive, often pulling her by the ears\r\n     so as to cause the blood to flow freely.\r\n\r\n     No bodily pain, however intense, can compare with the mental\r\n     suffering which we witness and experience, and which would long\r\n     since have filled our Insane Asylums to overflowing, were it not\r\n     for the unceasing drudgery to which we are subjected, in order to\r\n     save ourselves and families from starvation.\r\n\r\n     Often does the drunkard bestow upon his wife from one to a dozen\r\n     children to rear and support until old enough to render her a\r\n     little assistance, when they are compelled to seek service in\r\n     order to clothe themselves decently, and often are their\r\n     earnings, with those of their mother, appropriated to pay for\r\n     rum, tobacco, gambling, and other vices. \"Say not that we\r\n     exaggerate these evils; neither tongue nor pen can do it!\" says\r\n     the unfortunate wife of a man whose moral character, so far as\r\n     she knew, was unimpeachable, but who proved to be an insufferable\r\n     tyrant, depriving her of the necessaries of life, and often\r\n     ordering her out of the house which her friends provided for them\r\n     to live in, using the most abusive epithets which ingenuity, or\r\n     the want of it, could suggest. Intemperance degraded the\r\n     character of the man with whom she lived as long as apprehensions\r\n     for the safety of her life would warrant; from the fact that her\r\n     health was rapidly failing under the severity and deprivation to\r\n     which she was subjected, and the repeated threats of violence to\r\n     her own life and that of her friends. \"But one step farther and\r\n     you drive us to desperation! Sooner would I pour out my heart's\r\n     blood, drop by drop, than suffer again what I have hitherto\r\n     experienced, or that my female friends should suffer as I have\r\n     done, and I know that many of them do. Yet, neither sacrifice,\r\n     sympathy, argument, or influence can avail us anything under\r\n     existing circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n     Such an appeal from helpless, down-trodden humanity, though it\r\n     were made to a council of the most benighted North American\r\n     savages, would not pass unheeded. Shall it be made in vain to\r\n     you?\r\n\r\n     To many of us death would be a luxury compared to what we suffer\r\n     in consequence of the abusive treatment we receive from\r\n     unprincipled men, which existing laws sanction and encourage by\r\n     their indiscriminate severity, and with which we are told \"it\r\n     would be difficult to meddle on account of their sacredness and\r\n     sublimity.\" The idea is sufficiently ludicrous to excite the\r\n     risibility of the most grave. Though the sublime and the\r\n     ridiculous may be too nearly allied for females to distinguish\r\n     the difference, unjust inequality is to them far more\r\n     contemptible than sacred, having thus far been ungraciously\r\n     subjected to it. Well may we be called \"the weaker sex\" if the\r\n     error in judgment is ours, although we have intellect and energy\r\n     enough not to respect the circumstances under which we are\r\n     placed, nor the powers which would designedly inflict such\r\n     injustice upon us.\r\n\r\n     Debased indeed would a man consider himself to employ a woman to\r\n     plead his cause, with a woman for judge and twelve women for\r\n     jurors. How much less degraded are women when exposed to a\r\n     similar assembly of men, who have for them neither interest,\r\n     sympathy, nor respect, subjected as they are to insolent\r\n     questions and the uncharitable remarks of an indifferent\r\n     multitude.\r\n\r\n     It is urged that women are ignorant of the laws. They are\r\n     sufficiently enlightened to comprehend the meaning of justice--a\r\n     far more important thing--which admits of neither improvement nor\r\n     modification, but is applicable to every emergency. With the\r\n     perceptibility that some can boast, it would require but a short\r\n     time for them to enact laws sufficient to govern themselves,\r\n     which is all that the most aspiring can covet; convinced as they\r\n     are that, as in families, so likewise in government, the mild,\r\n     indulgent parent who would consult the greatest good of the\r\n     greatest number, is rewarded with agreeable and honorable\r\n     children; while the one who is unjust, partial, and severe, is\r\n     proportionably recompensed for his indiscretion.\r\n\r\n     In regard to unjust imprisonment we are told, \"It is of too rare\r\n     occurrence to require legal enactments.\" How many a devoted wife,\r\n     mother, and child can tell a far different story. Who of us or\r\n     our children is secure from false accusation and imprisonment,\r\n     or, perhaps, an ignominious death upon the gallows, to screen\r\n     some miserable villain from justice? Witnesses, lawyers, judges,\r\n     jurors, and executioners are paid for depriving innocent persons\r\n     of their time, liberty, health, and reputation, which, to many,\r\n     is dearer than life, while the guilty one escapes, and society,\r\n     when too late, laments the sad catastrophe. The life-blood of\r\n     many a victim demands not only justice for the guilty, but\r\n     protection for the innocent.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST NATIONAL CONVENTION IN WORCESTER, OCTOBER 23d and 24th, 1850.\r\n\r\nThe Conventions in New York and Ohio, though not extensively\r\nadvertised, nor planned with much deliberation, for in both cases\r\nthey were hastily decided upon, yet their novelty attracted much\r\nattention, and drew large audiences. Those who had long seen and felt\r\nwoman's wrongs, were now for the first time inspired with the hope\r\nthat something might be done for their redress by organized action.\r\nWhen Massachusetts decided to call a convention, the initiative steps\r\nwere well considered, as there were many men and women in that State\r\ntrained in the anti-slavery school, skilled in managing conventions,\r\nwho were also interested in woman's enfranchisement. But to the energy\r\nand earnestness of Paulina Wright Davis, more than to any other one\r\nperson, we may justly accord the success of the first Conventions in\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nIn describing the preliminary arrangements in a report read in the\r\nsecond decade meeting in New York in 1870, she says:\r\n\r\n\"In May, 1850, a few women in Boston attending an Anti-Slavery\r\nmeeting, proposed that all who felt interested in a plan for a\r\nNational Woman's Rights Convention, should consult in the ante-room.\r\nOf the nine who went out into that dark, dingy room, a committee of\r\nseven were chosen to do the work. Worcester was the place selected,\r\nand the 23d and 24th of October the appointed time. However, the work\r\nsoon devolved upon one person.[40] Illness hindered one, duty to a\r\nbrother another, duty to the slave a third, professional engagements a\r\nfourth, the fear of bringing the gray hairs of a father to the grave\r\nprevented another from serving; but the pledge was made, and could not\r\nbe withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\"The call was prepared, an argument in itself, and sent forth with\r\nearnest private letters in all directions. It covered the entire\r\nquestion, as it now stands before the public. Though moderate in tone,\r\ncarefully guarding the idea of the absolute unity of interests and of\r\nthe destiny of the two sexes which nature has established, it still\r\ngave the alarm to conservatism.\r\n\r\n\"Letters, curt, reproachful, and sometimes almost insulting, came with\r\nabsolute refusals to have the names of the writers used, or added to\r\nthe swelling list already in hand. There was astonishment at the\r\ntemerity of the writer in presenting such a request.\r\n\r\n\"Some few there were, so cheering and so excellent, that it is but\r\njustice to give extracts from them:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"'I doubt whether a more important movement has ever been\r\n     launched, touching the destiny of the race, than this in\r\n     regard to the equality of the sexes. You are at liberty to\r\n     use my name.

Under the dominion of these ideas, right\r\n     practice must gradually take the place of wrong, and the first we\r\n     shall know we shall find the social swallowing up the political,\r\n     and the whole governing its parts.\r\n               \"'With genuine respect, your co-worker,\r\n     \"'MRS.

Bronson Alcott, Caroline Kirkland, Ann Estelle\r\nLewis, Jane G. Swisshelm, William Elder, Rev. Thomas Brainard, and\r\nmany others, expressive of deep interest, are before us.\r\n\r\n\"The Convention came together in the bright October days, a solemn,\r\nearnest crowd of noble men and women.\r\n\r\n\"One great disappointment fell upon us. Margaret Fuller, toward whom\r\nmany eyes were turned as the future leader in this movement, was not\r\nwith us. The 'hungry, ravening sea,' had swallowed her up, and we were\r\nleft to mourn her guiding hand--her royal presence. To her, I, at\r\nleast, had hoped to confide the leadership of this movement. It can\r\nnever be known if she would have accepted it; the desire had been\r\nexpressed to her by letter; but be that as it may, she was, and still\r\nis, a leader of thought; a position far more desirable than a leader\r\nof numbers.\r\n\r\n\"The Convention was called to order by Mrs. Sarah H. Earl,[41] of\r\nWorcester, and a permanent list of officers presented in due order,\r\nand the whole business of the Convention was conducted in a\r\nparliamentary manner. Mrs. Earl, to whose memory we pay tribute\r\nto-day as one gone before, not lost, was one of the loveliest\r\nembodiments of womanhood I have ever known. She possessed a rare\r\ncombination of strength, gentleness, and earnestness, with a childlike\r\nfreedom and cheerfulness. I miss to-day her clear voice, her graceful\r\nself-poise, her calm dignity.\r\n\r\n\"From our midst another is missing: Mrs. Sarah Tyndale, of\r\nPhiladelphia--one of the first to sign the call. Indeed, the idea of\r\nsuch a convention had often been discussed in her home, more than two\r\nyears before, a home where every progressive thought found a cordial\r\nwelcome. To this noble woman, who gave herself to this work with\r\ngenuine earnestness, it is fitting that we pay a tribute of\r\naffectionate respect. She was, perhaps, more widely known than any\r\nother woman of her time for her practical talents; having conducted\r\none of the largest business houses in her native city for nearly a\r\nquarter of a century. Genial and largely hospitable, there was for her\r\ngreat social sacrifice in taking up a cause so unpopular; but she had\r\nno shrinking from duty, however trying it might be. Strong and grand\r\nas she was, in her womanly nature, she had nevertheless the largest\r\nand tenderest sympathies for the weak and erring. She was prescient,\r\nphilosophical, just, and generous. The mother of a large family, who\r\ngathered around to honor and bless her, she had still room in her\r\nheart for the woes of the world, and the latter years of her life were\r\ngiven to earnest, philanthropic work. We miss to-day her sympathy, her\r\nwise counsel, her great, organizing power.\r\n\r\n\"Many others there are, whose names well deserve to be graven in gold,\r\nand it is cause of thanksgiving to God that they are still present\r\nwith us, their lives speaking better than words. Some are in the Far\r\nWest, doing brave service there; others are across the water; others\r\nare withheld by cares and duties from being present; but we would fain\r\nhope none are absent from choice.\r\n\r\n\"Profound feeling pervaded the entire audience, and the talent\r\ndisplayed in the discussions, the eloquence of women who had never\r\nbefore spoken in public, surprised even those who expected most. Mrs.\r\nC. I. H. Nichols, of Vermont, made a profound impression. There was a\r\ntouching, tender pathos in her stories which went home to the heart;\r\nand many eyes, all unused to tears, were moistened as she described\r\nthe agony of the mother robbed of her child by the law.\r\n\r\n\"Abby H. Price, large-hearted and large-brained, gentle and strong,\r\npresented an address on the social question not easily forgotten, and\r\nseldom to the present time bettered.\r\n\r\n\"Lucy Stone, a natural orator, with a silvery voice, a heart warm and\r\nglowing with youthful enthusiasm; Antoinette L. Brown, a young\r\nminister, met firmly the Scriptural arguments; and Dr. Harriot K.\r\nHunt, earnest for the medical education of woman, gave variety to the\r\ndiscussions of the Convention.\r\n\r\n\"In this first national meeting the following resolution was passed,\r\nwhich it may be proper here to reiterate, thus showing that our\r\npresent demand has always been one and the same:\r\n\r\n     \"'_Resolved_, That women are clearly entitled to the right of\r\n     suffrage, and to be considered eligible to office; the omission\r\n     to demand which, on her part, is a palpable recreancy to duty,\r\n     and a denial of which is a gross usurpation on the part of man,\r\n     no longer to be endured; and that every party which claims to\r\n     represent the humanity, civilization, and progress of the age, is\r\n     bound to inscribe on its banners, \"Equality before the Law,\r\n     without distinction of Sex or Color.\"'\r\n\r\n\"From North to South the press found these reformers wonderfully\r\nridiculous people. The 'hen convention' was served up in every variety\r\nof style, till refined women dreaded to look into a newspaper.\r\nHitherto man had assumed to be the conscience of woman, now she\r\nindicated the will to think for herself; hence all this odium. But,\r\nhowever the word was preached, whether for wrath or conscience sake,\r\nwe rejoiced and thanked God.\r\n\r\n\"In July, following this Convention, an able and elaborate notice\r\nappeared in the _Westminster Review_. This notice, candid in tone and\r\nspirit, as it was thorough and able in discussion, successfully\r\nvindicated every position we assumed, reaffirmed and established the\r\nhighest ground taken in principle or policy by our movement. The\r\nwide-spread circulation and high authority of this paper told upon the\r\npublic mind, both in Europe and this country. It was at the time\r\nsupposed to be by Mr. John Stuart Mill. Later we learned that it was\r\nfrom the pen of his noble wife, to whom be all honor for thus coming\r\nto the aid of a struggling cause. I can pay no tribute to her memory\r\nso beautiful as the following extract from a letter recently received\r\nfrom her husband:\r\n\r\n     \"'It gives me the greatest pleasure to know that the service\r\n     rendered by my dear wife to the cause which was nearer her heart\r\n     than any other, by her essay in the _Westminster Review_, has had\r\n     so much effect and is so justly appreciated in the United States.\r\n     Were it possible in a memoir to have the formation and growth of\r\n     a mind like hers portrayed, to do so would be as valuable a\r\n     benefit to mankind as was ever conferred by a biography. But such\r\n     a psychological history is seldom possible, and in her case the\r\n     materials for it do not exist. All that could be furnished is her\r\n     birth-place, parentage, and a few dates, and it seems to me that\r\n     her memory is more honored by the absence of any attempt at a\r\n     biographical notice than by the presence of a most meagre one.\r\n     What she was, I have attempted, though most inadequately, to\r\n     delineate in the remarks prefaced to her essay, as reprinted with\r\n     my \"Dissertations and Discussions.\"'\r\n\r\n     \"'I am very glad to hear of the step in advance made by the Rhode\r\n     Island Legislature in constituting a Board of Women for some\r\n     important administrative purposes. Your intended proposal, that\r\n     women be impaneled on every jury where women are to be tried,\r\n     seems to me very good, and calculated to place the injustice to\r\n     which women are at present subjected, by the entire legal system,\r\n     in a very striking light.\r\n\r\n                          \"'I am, dear madam, yours sincerely,\r\n      \"'MRS. PAULINA WRIGHT DAVIS.                     J. S. MILL.'\r\n\r\n\"Immediately after the reports were published, they were sent to\r\nvarious persons in Europe, and before the second Convention was held,\r\nletters of cheer were received from Harriet Martineau, Marion Reid,\r\nand others.\r\n\r\n\"Thus encouraged, we felt new zeal to go on with a work which had\r\nchallenged the understanding and constrained the hearts of the best\r\nand soundest thinkers in the nation; had given an impulse to the women\r\nof England and of Sweden--for Frederika Bremer had quoted from our\r\nwritings and reported our proceedings; our words had been like an\r\nangel's visit to the prisoners of State in France and to the wronged\r\nand outraged at home!\r\n\r\n\"Many letters were received from literary women in this country as\r\nwell as abroad. If not always ready to be identified with the work,\r\nthey were appreciative of its good effects, and, like Nicodemus, they\r\ncame by night to inquire 'how these things could be.' Self-interest\r\nshowed them the advantages accruing from the recognition of\r\nequality--self-ism held them silent before the world till the reproach\r\nshould be worn away; but we credit them with a sense of justice and\r\nright, which prompts them now to action. The rear guard is as\r\nessential in the army as the advance; each should select the place\r\nbest adapted to their own powers.\"\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Davis has fallen asleep since writing the above, we have\r\nthought best to give what seemed to her the salient points of that\r\nperiod in her own words.\r\n\r\nOctober 23, 1850, a large audience assembled in Brinley Hall,\r\nWorcester, Mass. The Convention was called to order by Sarah H. Earle,\r\nof Worcester. Nine States were represented. There were Garrison,\r\nPhillips, Burleigh, Foster, Pillsbury, leaders in the anti-slavery\r\nstruggle; Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth representing the\r\nenslaved African race. The Channings, Sargents, Parsons, Shaws, from\r\nthe liberal pulpit and the aristocracy of Boston. From Ohio came\r\nMariana and Oliver Johnson, who had edited the _Anti-Slavery Bugle_,\r\nthat sent forth many a blast against the black laws of that State, and\r\nmany a stirring call for the woman's conventions. From Ohio, too, came\r\nEllen and Marion Blackwell, sisters of Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell.\r\nPennsylvania sent its Lucretia Mott, its Darlingtons, Plumlys,\r\nHastings, Millers, Hicks, who had all taken part in the exciting\r\ndivisions among the \"Friends,\" as a sect. On motion of Mariana\r\nJohnson, a temporary chairman was chosen, and a nominating committee\r\nappointed, which reported the following list of officers adopted by\r\nthe Convention:\r\n\r\n_President_--PAULINA WRIGHT DAVIS, R. I.\r\n\r\n_Vice-Presidents_--WILLIAM HENRY CHANNING, Mass.; SARAH TYNDALE, Pa.\r\n\r\n_Secretaries_--HANNAH M. DARLINGTON, Pa.; JOSEPH C. HATHAWAY, N. Y.\r\n\r\nThe Call of the Convention was read. It contains so good a digest of\r\nthe demands then made, in language so calm and choice, in thought so\r\nclear and philosophical, that we give it entire, that the women of the\r\nfuture may see how well their mothers understood their rights, and\r\nwith what modesty and moderation they pressed their wrongs on the\r\nconsideration of their rulers.\r\n\r\n                                 THE CALL.\r\n\r\n     A Convention will be held at Worcester, Mass., on the 23d and\r\n     24th of October next, to consider the question of Woman's Rights,\r\n     Duties, and Relations. The men and women who feel sufficient\r\n     interest in the subject to give an earnest thought and effective\r\n     effort to its rightful adjustment, are invited to meet each other\r\n     in free conference at the time and place appointed.\r\n\r\n     The upward tending spirit of the age, busy in an hundred forms of\r\n     effort for the world's redemption from the sins and sufferings\r\n     which oppress it, has brought this one, which yields to none in\r\n     importance and urgency, into distinguished prominence. One-half\r\n     the race are its immediate objects, and the other half are as\r\n     deeply involved, by that absolute unity of interest and destiny\r\n     which Nature has established between them. The neighbor is near\r\n     enough to involve every human being in a general equality of\r\n     rights and community of interests; but men and women in their\r\n     reciprocities of love and duty, are one flesh and one blood;\r\n     mother, sister, wife, and daughter come so near the heart and\r\n     mind of every man, that they must be either his blessing or his\r\n     bane. Where there is such mutuality of interests, such an\r\n     interlinking of life, there can be no real antagonism of position\r\n     and action. The sexes should not, for any reason or by any\r\n     chance, take hostile attitudes toward each other, either in the\r\n     apprehension or amendment of the wrongs which exist in their\r\n     necessary relations; but they should harmonize in opinion and\r\n     co-operate in effort, for the reason that they must unite in the\r\n     ultimate achievement of the desired reformation.\r\n\r\n     Of the many points now under discussion, and demanding a just\r\n     settlement; the general question of woman's rights and relations\r\n     comprehends these: Her education--literary, scientific, and\r\n     artistic; her avocations--industrial, commercial, and\r\n     professional; her interests--pecuniary, civil, and political; in\r\n     a word, her rights as an individual, and her functions as a\r\n     citizen.\r\n\r\n     No one will pretend that all these interests, embracing as they\r\n     do all that is not merely animal in a human life, are rightly\r\n     understood, or justly provided for in the existing social order.\r\n     Nor is it any more true that the constitutional differences of\r\n     the sexes which should determine, define, and limit the resulting\r\n     differences of office and duty, are adequately comprehended and\r\n     practically observed.\r\n\r\n     Woman has been condemned for her greater delicacy of physical\r\n     organization, to inferiority of intellectual and moral culture,\r\n     and to the forfeiture of great social, civil, and religious\r\n     privileges. In the relation of marriage she has been ideally\r\n     annihilated and actually enslaved in all that concerns her\r\n     personal and pecuniary rights, and even in widowed and single\r\n     life, she is oppressed with such limitation and degradation of\r\n     labor and avocation, as clearly and cruelly mark the condition of\r\n     a disabled caste. But by the inspiration of the Almighty, the\r\n     beneficent spirit of reform is roused to the redress of these\r\n     wrongs.\r\n\r\n     The tyranny which degrades and crushes wives and mothers sits no\r\n     longer lightly on the world's conscience; the heart's\r\n     home-worship feels the stain of stooping at a dishonored altar.\r\n     Manhood begins to feel the shame of muddying the springs from\r\n     which it draws its highest life, and womanhood is everywhere\r\n     awakening to assert its divinely chartered rights and to fulfill\r\n     its noblest duties. It is the spirit of reviving truth and\r\n     righteousness which has moved upon the great deep of the public\r\n     heart and aroused its redressing justice, and through it the\r\n     Providence of God is vindicating the order and appointments of\r\n     His creation.\r\n\r\n     The signs are encouraging; the time is opportune. Come, then, to\r\n     this Convention. It is your duty, if you are worthy of your age\r\n     and country. Give the help of your best thought to separate the\r\n     light from the darkness. Wisely give the protection of your name\r\n     and the benefit of your efforts to the great work of settling the\r\n     principles, devising the methods, and achieving the success of\r\n     this high and holy movement.\r\n\r\nThis call was signed by eighty-nine leading men and women of six\r\nStates.[42]\r\n\r\nOn taking the chair, Mrs. Davis said:\r\n\r\n     The reformation we propose in its utmost scope is radical and\r\n     universal. It is not the mere perfecting of a reform already in\r\n     motion, a detail of some established plan, but it is an epochal\r\n     movement--the emancipation of a class, the redemption of half the\r\n     world, and a conforming reorganization of all social, political,\r\n     and industrial interests and institutions. Moreover, it is a\r\n     movement without example among the enterprises of associated\r\n     reformations, for it has no purpose of arming the oppressed\r\n     against the oppressor, or of separating the parties, or of\r\n     setting up independence, or of severing the relations of either.\r\n\r\n     Its intended changes are to be wrought in the intimate texture of\r\n     all societary organizations, without violence or any form of\r\n     antagonism. It seeks to replace the worn-out with the living and\r\n     the beautiful, so as to reconstruct without overturning, and to\r\n     regenerate without destroying.\r\n\r\n     Our claim must rest on its justice, and conquer by its power of\r\n     truth. We take the ground that whatever has been achieved for the\r\n     race belongs to it, and must not be usurped by any class or\r\n     caste. The rights and liberties of one human being can not be\r\n     made the property of another, though they were redeemed for him\r\n     or her by the life of that other; for rights can not be forfeited\r\n     by way of salvage, and they are, in their nature, unpurchasable\r\n     and inalienable. We claim for woman a full and generous\r\n     investiture of all the blessings which the other sex has solely,\r\n     or by her aid, achieved for itself. We appeal from man's\r\n     injustice and selfishness to his principles and affections.\r\n\r\nIt was cheering to find in the very beginning many distinguished men\r\nready to help us to the law, gospel, social ethics, and philosophy\r\ninvolved in our question. A letter from Gerrit Smith to William Lloyd\r\nGarrison says:\r\n\r\n                                   PETERBORO, N. Y., _Oct. 16, 1850_.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR:--I this evening received from my friend H. H. Van\r\n     Amringe, of Wisconsin, the accompanying argument on woman's\r\n     rights. It is written by himself. He is, as you are aware, a\r\n     highly intellectual man. He wishes me to present this argument to\r\n     the Woman's Convention which is to be held in Worcester. Permit\r\n     me to do so through yourself.\r\n\r\n     My excessive business engagements compel me to refuse all\r\n     invitations to attend public meetings not in my own county. May\r\n     Heaven's richest blessings rest on the Convention.\r\n\r\n          Very respectfully and fraternally yours,      GERRIT SMITH.\r\n\r\nMr. Van Amringe's paper on \"Woman's Rights in Church and State\" was\r\nread and discussed, and a large portion of it printed in the regular\r\nreport of the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe papers read by the women, in style and argument, were in no way\r\ninferior to those of the men present.\r\n\r\nLetters were read from Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Rev. Samuel J. May, L.\r\nA. Hine, Elizur Wright, O. S. Eowler, Esther Ann Lukens, Margaret\r\nChappel Smith, Nancy M. Baird, Jane Cowen, Sophia L. Little, Elizabeth\r\nWilson, Maria L. Varney, and Milfred A. Spaford.[43]\r\n\r\nMrs. Abby H. Price, of Hopedale, made an address on the injustice of\r\nexcluding girls from the colleges, the trades and the professions, and\r\nthe importance of training them to some profitable labor, and thus to\r\nprotect their virtue, dignity, and self-respect by securing their\r\npecuniary independence.\r\n\r\n     She thought the speediest solution of the vexed problem of\r\n     prostitution was profitable work for the rising generation of\r\n     girls. The best legislation on the social vice was in removing\r\n     the legal disabilities that cripple all their powers. Woman, in\r\n     order to be equally independent with man, must have a fair and\r\n     equal chance. He is in nowise restricted from doing, in every\r\n     department of human exertion, all he is able to do. If he is bold\r\n     and ambitious, and desires fame, every avenue is open to him. He\r\n     may blend science and art, producing a competence for his\r\n     support, until he chains them to the car of his genius, and, with\r\n     Fulton and Morse, wins a crown of imperishable gratitude. If he\r\n     desires to tread the path of knowledge up to its glorious\r\n     temple-summit, he can, as he pleases, take either of the learned\r\n     professions as instruments of pecuniary independence, while he\r\n     plumes his wings for a higher and higher ascent. Not so with\r\n     woman. Her rights are not recognized as equal; her sphere is\r\n     circumscribed--not by her ability, but by her sex. If, perchance,\r\n     her taste leads her to excellence, in the way they give her leave\r\n     to tread, she is worshiped as almost divine; but if she reaches\r\n     for laurels they have in view, the wings of her genius are\r\n     clipped because she is a woman.\r\n\r\nDr. Harriot K. Hunt, of Boston, the first woman who practiced medicine\r\nin this country, spoke on the medical education of women.\r\n\r\nSarah Tyndale, a successful merchant in Philadelphia, on the business\r\ncapacity of woman.\r\n\r\nAntoinette L. Brown, a graduate of Oberlin College, and a student in\r\nTheology, made a logical argument on woman's position in the Bible,\r\nclaiming her complete equality with man, the simultaneous creation of\r\nthe sexes, and their moral responsibilities as individual and\r\nimperative.\r\n\r\nThe debates on the resolutions were spicy, pointed, and logical, and\r\nwere deeply interesting, continuing with crowded audiences through two\r\nentire days. In these debates Lucy Stone, Lucretia Mott, Wendell\r\nPhillips, William Henry Channing, Ernestine L. Rose, Frederick\r\nDouglass, Martha Mowry, Abby Kelly and Stephen Foster, Elizabeth B.\r\nChase, James N. Buffam, Sojourner Truth, Eliab Capron, and Joseph C.\r\nHathaway, took part. As there was no phonographic reporter present,\r\nmost of the best speaking, that was extemporaneous, can not be handed\r\ndown to history.\r\n\r\nAmong the letters to the Convention, there was one quite novel and\r\ninteresting from Helene Marie Weber,[44] a lady of high literary\r\ncharacter, who had published numerous tracts on the Rights of Woman.\r\nShe contended that the physical development of woman was impossible in\r\nher present costume, and that her consequent enfeebled condition made\r\nher incapable of entering many of the most profitable employments in\r\nthe world of work. Miss Weber exemplified her teachings by her\r\npractice. She usually wore a dress coat and pantaloons of black cloth;\r\non full-dress occasions, a dark blue dress coat, with plain flat gilt\r\nbuttons, and drab-colored pantaloons. Her waistcoat was of buff\r\ncassimere, richly trimmed with plain, flat-surfaced, gold buttons,\r\nexquisitely polished; this was an elegant costume, and one she wore to\r\ngreat advantage. Her clothes were all perfect in their fit, and of\r\nParis make; and her figure was singularly well adapted to male attire.\r\nNo gentleman in Paris made a finer appearance.\r\n\r\nOne of the grand results of this Convention was the thought roused in\r\nEngland. A good report of the proceedings in the New _York Tribune_,\r\nfor Europe, of October 29, 1850, was read by the future Mrs. John\r\nStuart Mill, then Mrs. Taylor, and at once called out from her pen an\r\nable essay in the _Westminster and Foreign Quarterly Review_, entitled\r\n\"Enfranchisement of Woman.\" This attracted the attention of many\r\nliberal thinkers, and foremost of these, one of England's greatest\r\nphilosophers and scholars, the Hon. John Stuart Mill, who became soon\r\nafter the champion of woman's cause in the British Parliament. The\r\nessayist in speaking of this Convention says:\r\n\r\n     Most of our readers will probably learn, from these pages, for\r\n     the first time, that there has risen in the United States, and in\r\n     the most Civilized and enlightened portion of them, an organized\r\n     agitation, on a new question, new not to thinkers, nor to any one\r\n     by whom the principles of free and popular government are felt,\r\n     as well as acknowledged; but new, and even unheard of, as a\r\n     subject for public meetings, and practical political action. This\r\n     question is the enfranchisement of women, their admission in law,\r\n     and in fact, to equality in all rights, political, civil, social,\r\n     with the male citizens of the community.\r\n\r\n     It will add to the surprise with which many will receive this\r\n     intelligence, that the agitation which has commenced is not a\r\n     pleading by male writers and orators _for_ women, those who are\r\n     professedly to be benefited remaining either indifferent, or\r\n     ostensibly hostile; it is a political movement, practical in its\r\n     objects, carried on in a form which denotes an intention to\r\n     persevere. And it is a movement not merely _for_ women, but _by_\r\n     them....\r\n\r\n     A succession of public meetings was held, under the name of a\r\n     \"Woman's Rights Convention,\" of which the President was a woman,\r\n     and nearly all the chief speakers women; numerously reinforced,\r\n     however, by men, among whom were some of the most distinguished\r\n     leaders in the kindred cause of negro emancipation....\r\n\r\n     According to the report in the _New York Tribune_, above a\r\n     thousand persons were present, throughout, and \"if a larger place\r\n     could have been had, many thousands more would have attended.\"\r\n\r\n     In regard to the quality of the speaking, the proceedings bear an\r\n     advantageous comparison with those of any popular movement with\r\n     which we are acquainted, either in this country or in America.\r\n     Very rarely in the oratory of public meetings is the part of\r\n     verbiage and declamation so small, and that of calm good sense\r\n     and reason so considerable.\r\n\r\n     The result of the convention was in every respect encouraging to\r\n     those by whom it was summoned; and it is probably destined to\r\n     inaugurate one of the most important of the movements toward\r\n     political and social reform, which are the best characteristic of\r\n     the present age. That the promoters of this new agitation take\r\n     their stand on principles, and do not fear to declare these in\r\n     their widest extent, without time-serving or compromise, will be\r\n     seen from the resolutions adopted by the Convention[45].\r\n\r\nAfter giving an able argument in favor of all the demands made in the\r\nConvention with a fair criticism of some of the weak things uttered\r\nthere, she concludes by saying:\r\n\r\n     There are indications that the example of America will be\r\n     followed on this side of the Atlantic; and the first step has\r\n     been taken in that part of England where every serious movement\r\n     in the direction of political progress has its commencement--the\r\n     manufacturing districts of the north. On the 13th of February,\r\n     1851, a petition of women, agreed to by a public meeting at\r\n     Sheffield, and claiming the elective franchise, was presented to\r\n     the House of Lords by the Earl of Carlisle.\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry Channing, from the Business Committee, suggested a plan\r\nfor organization and the principles that should govern the movement.\r\nIn accordance with his views a National Central Committee was\r\nappointed, in which every State was represented[46]. Paulina Wright\r\nDavis, Chairman; Sarah H. Earle, Secretary; Wendell Phillips,\r\nTreasurer.\r\n\r\nThis Convention was a very creditable one in every point of view. The\r\norder and perfection of the arrangements, the character of the papers\r\npresented, and the sustained enthusiasm, reflect honor on the men and\r\nwomen who conducted the proceedings. The large number of letters\r\naddressed to Mrs. Davis show how extensive had been her\r\ncorrespondence, both in the old world and the new. Her wealth,\r\nculture, and position gave her much social influence; her beauty,\r\ngrace, and gentle manners drew around her a large circle of admiring\r\nfriends. These, with her tall fine figure, her classic head and\r\nfeatures, and exquisite taste in dress; her organizing talent and\r\nknowledge of the question under consideration, altogether made her so\r\ndesirable a presiding officer, that she was often chosen for that\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND NATIONAL CONVENTION IN WORCESTER.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with a call from the Central Committee, the friends of\r\nWoman Suffrage assembled again in Brinley Hall, Oct. 15th and 16th,\r\n1851. At an early hour the house was filled, and was called to order\r\nby Paulina Wright Davis, who was again chosen permanent President.\r\nThis Convention was conducted mainly by the same persons who had so\r\nsuccessfully managed the proceedings of the previous year. Mrs. Davis,\r\non taking the chair, gave a brief _resumé_ of the steps of progress\r\nduring the year, and at the close of her remarks, letters were read\r\nfrom Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Ward Beecher, Horace Mann, Angelina\r\nGrimke Weld, Frances D. Gage, Estelle Anna Lewis, Marion Blackwell,\r\nOliver Johnson, and Eliza Barney, all giving a hearty welcome to the\r\nnew idea. Mrs. Emma R. Coe, of the Business Committee, called upon\r\nWendell Phillips to read the resolutions[47] prepared for the\r\nconsideration of the Convention.\r\n\r\nOn rising Mr. PHILLIPS said:\r\n\r\n     In drawing up some of these resolutions, I have used very freely\r\n     the language of a thoughtful and profound article in the\r\n     _Westminster Review_. It is a review of the proceedings of our\r\n     Convention, held one year ago, and states with singular clearness\r\n     and force the leading arguments for our reform, and the grounds\r\n     of our claim in behalf of woman. I rejoice to see so large an\r\n     audience gathered to consider this momentous subject, the most\r\n     magnificent reform that has yet been launched upon the world. It\r\n     is the first organized protest against the injustice which has\r\n     brooded over the character and the destiny of one-half of the\r\n     human race. Nowhere else, under any circumstances, has a demand\r\n     ever yet been made for the liberties of one whole half of our\r\n     race. It is fitting that we should pause and consider so\r\n     remarkable and significant a circumstance; that we should discuss\r\n     the questions involved with the seriousness and deliberation\r\n     suitable to such an enterprise.\r\n\r\n     It strikes, indeed, a great and vital blow at the whole social\r\n     fabric of every nation; but this, to my mind, is no argument\r\n     against it.... Government commenced in usurpation and oppression;\r\n     liberty and civilization at present are nothing else than the\r\n     fragments of rights which the scaffold and the stake have wrung\r\n     from the strong hands of the usurpers. Every step of progress the\r\n     world has made has been from scaffold to scaffold, from stake to\r\n     stake.... Government began in tyranny and force; began in the\r\n     feudalism of the soldier and the bigotry of the priest; and the\r\n     ideas of justice and humanity have been fighting their way like a\r\n     thunderstorm against the organized selfishness of human nature.\r\n\r\n     And this is the last great protest against the wrong of ages. It\r\n     is no argument, to my mind, therefore, that the old social fabric\r\n     of the past is against us. Neither do I feel called upon to show\r\n     what woman's proper sphere is. In every great reform the majority\r\n     have always said to the claimant, no matter what he claimed, \"You\r\n     are not fit for such a privilege.\" Luther asked of the Pope\r\n     liberty for the masses to read the Bible. The reply was that it\r\n     would not be safe to trust the masses with the word of God. \"Let\r\n     them try,\" said the great reformer, and the history of three\r\n     centuries of development and purity proclaims the result.\r\n\r\n     The lower classes in France claimed their civil rights; the right\r\n     to vote, and to a direct representation in government, but the\r\n     rich and lettered classes cried out, \"You can not be made fit.\"\r\n     The answer was, \"Let us try.\" That France is not as Spain,\r\n     utterly crushed beneath the weight of a thousand years of\r\n     misgovernment, is the answer to those who doubt the ultimate\r\n     success of the experiment.\r\n\r\n     Woman stands now at the same door. She says: \"You tell me I have\r\n     no intellect. Give me a chance.\" \"You tell me I shall only\r\n     embarrass politics; let me try.\" The only reply is the same stale\r\n     argument that said to the Jews of Europe: You are fit only to\r\n     make money; you are not fit for the ranks of the army, or the\r\n     halls of Parliament.\r\n\r\n     How cogent the eloquent appeal of Macaulay: \"What right have we\r\n     to take this question for granted? Throw open the doors of this\r\n     House of Commons; throw open the ranks of the imperial army,\r\n     before you deny eloquence to the countrymen of Isaiah, or valor\r\n     to the descendants of the Maccabees.\"\r\n\r\n     It is the same now with us. Throw open the doors of Congress;\r\n     throw open those court-houses; throw wide open the doors of your\r\n     colleges, and give to the sisters of the De Staëls and the\r\n     Martineaus the same opportunity for culture that men have, and\r\n     let the results prove what their capacity and intellect really\r\n     are. When woman has enjoyed for as many centuries as we have the\r\n     aid of books, the discipline of life, and the stimulus of fame,\r\n     it will be time to begin the discussion of these questions: \"What\r\n     is the intellect of woman?\" \"Is it equal to that of man?\" Till\r\n     then, all such discussion is mere beating of the air. While it is\r\n     doubtless true, that great minds make a way for themselves, spite\r\n     of all obstacles, yet who knows how many Miltons have died, \"mute\r\n     and inglorious\"? However splendid the natural endowments, the\r\n     discipline of life, after all, completes the miracle. The ability\r\n     of Napoleon--what was it? It grew out of the hope to be Cæsar, or\r\n     Marlborough; out of Austerlitz and Jena--out of his\r\n     battle-fields, his throne, and all the great scenes of that\r\n     eventful life.\r\n\r\n     Open to woman the same scenes, immerse her in the same great\r\n     interests and pursuits, and if twenty centuries shall not produce\r\n     a woman Charlemagne, or a Napoleon, fair reason will then allow\r\n     us to conclude that there is some distinctive peculiarity in the\r\n     intellects of the sexes.\r\n\r\n     Centuries alone can lay a fair basis for the argument. I believe\r\n     on this point there is a shrinking consciousness of not being\r\n     ready for the battle, on the part of some of the stronger sex, as\r\n     they call themselves; a tacit confession of risk to this imagined\r\n     superiority, if they consent to meet their sisters in the lecture\r\n     halls, or the laboratory of science.\r\n\r\n     My proof of it is this, that the mightiest intellects of the\r\n     race, from Plato down to the present time, some of the rarest\r\n     minds of Germany, France, and England, have successively yielded\r\n     their assent to the fact, that woman is not, perhaps,\r\n     identically, but equally endowed with man in all intellectual\r\n     capabilities. It is generally the second-rate men who doubt;\r\n     doubt because, perhaps, they fear a fair field.\r\n\r\n     Suppose that woman is essentially inferior to man, she still has\r\n     rights. Grant that Mrs. Norton[48] never could be Byron; that\r\n     Elizabeth Barrett never could have written Paradise Lost; that\r\n     Mrs. Somerville never could be La Place, nor Sirani have painted\r\n     the Transfiguration. What then? Does that prove they should be\r\n     deprived of all civil rights?\r\n\r\n     John Smith will never be, never can be, Daniel Webster. Shall he\r\n     therefore be put under guardianship, and forbidden to vote?\r\n     Suppose woman, though equal, does differ essentially in her\r\n     intellect from man, is that any ground for disfranchising her?\r\n     Shall the Fultons say to the Raphaels, because you can not make\r\n     steam engines, therefore you shall not vote? Shall the Napoleons\r\n     or the Washingtons say to the Wordsworths or the Herschels,\r\n     because you can not lead armies, and govern States, therefore you\r\n     shall have no civil rights?\r\n\r\nThe following interesting letter from Harriet Martineau was then read,\r\nwhich we give in full, that the reader may see how clearly defined was\r\nher position at that early day:\r\n\r\n                                   CROMER, ENGLAND, _Aug. 3, 1851_.\r\n\r\n     PAULINA WRIGHT DAVIS:\r\n\r\n     DEAR MADAM:--I beg to thank you heartily for your kindness in\r\n     sending me the Report of the Proceedings of your Woman's Rights\r\n     Convention. I had gathered what I could from the newspapers\r\n     concerning it, but I was gratified at being able to read, in a\r\n     collected form, addresses so full of earnestness and sound truth,\r\n     as I found most of the speeches to be. I hope you are aware of\r\n     the interest excited in this country by that Convention, the\r\n     strongest, proof of which is the appearance of an article on the\r\n     subject in _The Westminster Review_ (for July), as thorough-going\r\n     as any of your own addresses, and from the pen (at least as it is\r\n     understood here) of one of our very first men, Mr. John S. Mill.\r\n     I am not without hope that this article will materially\r\n     strengthen your hands, and I am sure it can not but cheer your\r\n     hearts.\r\n\r\n     Ever since I became capable of thinking for myself, I have\r\n     clearly seen, and I have said it till my listeners and readers\r\n     are probably tired of hearing it, that there can be but one true\r\n     method in the treatment of each human being, of either sex, of\r\n     any color, and under any outward circumstances, to ascertain what\r\n     are the powers of that being, to cultivate them to the utmost,\r\n     and _then_ to see what action they will find for themselves. This\r\n     has probably never been done for men, unless in some rare\r\n     individual cases. It has certainly never been done for women,\r\n     and, till it is done, all debating about what woman's intellect\r\n     is, all speculation, or laying down the law, as to what is\r\n     woman's sphere, is a mere beating of the air. _A priori_\r\n     conceptions have long been worthless in physical science, and\r\n     nothing was really effected till the experimental method was\r\n     clearly made out and strictly applied in practice, and the same\r\n     principle holds most certainly through the whole range of moral\r\n     science.\r\n\r\n     Whether we regard the physical fact of what women are able to do,\r\n     or the moral fact of what women ought to do, it is equally\r\n     necessary to abstain from making any decision prior to\r\n     experiment. We see plainly enough the waste of time and thought\r\n     among the men who once talked of Nature abhorring a vacuum, or\r\n     disputed at great length as to whether angels could go from end\r\n     to end without passing through the middle; and the day will come\r\n     when it will appear to be no less absurd to have argued, as men\r\n     and women are arguing now, about what woman ought to do, before\r\n     it was ascertained what woman can do.\r\n\r\n     Let us once see a hundred women educated up to the highest point\r\n     that education at present reaches; let them be supplied with such\r\n     knowledge as their faculties are found to crave, and let them be\r\n     free to use, apply, and increase their knowledge as their\r\n     faculties shall instigate, and it will presently appear what is\r\n     the sphere of each of the hundred.\r\n\r\n     One may be discovering comets, like Miss Herschell; one may be\r\n     laying open the mathematical structure of the universe, like Mrs.\r\n     Somerville; another may be analyzing the chemical relations of\r\n     Nature in the laboratory; another may be penetrating the\r\n     mysteries of physiology; others may be applying science in the\r\n     healing of diseases; others maybe investigating the laws of\r\n     social relations, learning the great natural laws under which\r\n     society, like everything else, proceeds; others, again, may be\r\n     actively carrying out the social arrangements which have been\r\n     formed under these laws; and others may be chiefly occupied in\r\n     family business, in the duties of the wife and mother, and the\r\n     ruler of the household.\r\n\r\n     If, among the hundred women, a great diversity of powers should\r\n     appear (which I have no doubt would be the case), there will\r\n     always be plenty of scope and material for the greatest amount\r\n     and variety of power that can be brought out. If not--if it\r\n     should appear that women fall below men in all but the domestic\r\n     functions--then it will be well that the experiment has been\r\n     tried; and the trial better go on forever, that woman's sphere\r\n     may forever determine itself to the satisfaction of everybody. It\r\n     is clear that education, to be what I demand on behalf of women,\r\n     must be intended to issue in active life.\r\n\r\n     A man's medical education would be worth little, if it was not a\r\n     preparation for practice. The astronomer and the chemist would\r\n     put little force into their studies, if it was certain that they\r\n     must leave off in four or five years, and do nothing for the rest\r\n     of their lives; and no man could possibly feel much interest in\r\n     political and social morals, if he knew that he must, all his\r\n     life long, pay taxes, but neither speak nor move about public\r\n     affairs.\r\n\r\n     Women, like men, must be educated with a view to action, or their\r\n     studies can not be called education, and no judgment can be\r\n     formed of the scope of their faculties. The pursuit must be\r\n     life's business, or it will be mere pastime or irksome task. This\r\n     was always my point of difference with one who carefully\r\n     cherished a reverence for woman, the late Dr. Channing.\r\n\r\n     How much we spoke and wrote of the old controversy, Influence vs.\r\n     Office. He would have had any woman study anything that her\r\n     faculties led her to, whether physical science or law, government\r\n     and political economy; but he would have her stop at the study.\r\n     From the moment she entered the hospital as physician and not\r\n     nurse; from the moment she took her place in a court of justice,\r\n     in the jury box, and not the witness box; from the moment she\r\n     brought her mind and her voice into the legislature, instead of\r\n     discussing the principles of laws at home; from the moment she\r\n     announced and administered justice instead of looking at it from\r\n     afar, as a thing with which she had no concern, she would, he\r\n     feared, lose her influence as an observing intelligence, standing\r\n     by in a state of purity \"unspotted from the world.\"\r\n\r\n     My conviction always was, that an intelligence never carried out\r\n     into action could not be worth much; and that, if all the action\r\n     of human life was of a character so tainted as to be unfit for\r\n     women, it could be no better for men, and we ought all to sit\r\n     down together, to let barbarism overtake us once more.\r\n\r\n     My own conviction is, that the natural action of the whole human\r\n     being occasions not only the most strength, but the highest\r\n     elevation; not only the warmest sympathy, but the deepest purity.\r\n     The highest and purest beings among women seem now to be those\r\n     who, far from being idle, find among their restricted\r\n     opportunities some means of strenuous action; and I can not doubt\r\n     that, if an active social career were open to all women, with due\r\n     means of preparation for it, those who are high and holy now,\r\n     would be high and holy then, and would be joined by an\r\n     innumerable company of just spirits from among those whose\r\n     energies are now pining and fretting in enforced idleness, or\r\n     unworthy frivolity, or brought down into pursuits and aims which\r\n     are anything but pure and peaceable.\r\n\r\n     In regard to the old controversy--Influence vs. Office--it\r\n     appears to me that if Influence is good and Office bad for human\r\n     morals and character, Man's present position is one of such\r\n     hardship, as it is almost profane to contemplate; and if, on the\r\n     contrary, Office is good and a life of Influence is bad, Woman\r\n     has an instant right to claim that her position be amended.\r\n\r\n                                   Yours faithfully, HARRIET MARTINEAU.\r\n\r\nFrom her letter, we find, that Miss Martineau shared the common\r\nopinion in England that the article in the _Westminster Review_ on the\r\n\"Enfranchisement of Woman\" was written by John Stuart Mill. It was\r\ncertainly very complimentary to Mrs. Taylor, the real author of that\r\npaper, who afterward married Mr. Mill, that it should have been\r\nsupposed to emanate from the pen of that distinguished philosopher. An\r\namusing incident is related of Mr. Mill, for the truth of which we can\r\nnot vouch, but report says, that after reading this article, he\r\nhastened to read it again to Mrs. Taylor, and passing on it the\r\nhighest praises, to his great surprise she confessed herself the\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\nAt this Convention Mrs. Elizabeth Oakes Smith made her first\r\nappearance on our platform. She was well known in the literary circles\r\nof New York as a writer of merit in journals and periodicals. She\r\ndefended the Convention and its leaders through the columns of the\r\n_New York Tribune_, and afterward published a series of articles\r\nentitled \"Woman and her Needs.\" She early made her way into the\r\nlyceums and some pulpits never before open to woman. Her \"Bertha and\r\nLily,\" a woman's rights novel, and her other writings were influential\r\nin moulding popular thought.\r\n\r\nAngelina Grimke, familiar with plantation life, spoke eloquently on\r\nthe parallel between the slave code and the laws for married women.\r\n\r\nMehitable Haskell, of Gloucester, said:\r\n\r\n     Perhaps, my friends, I ought to apologize for standing here.\r\n     Perhaps I attach too much importance to my own age. This meeting,\r\n     as I understand it, was called to discuss Woman's Rights. Well, I\r\n     do not pretend to know exactly what woman's rights are; but I do\r\n     know that I have groaned for forty years, yea, for fifty years,\r\n     under a sense of woman's wrongs. I know that even when a girl, I\r\n     groaned under the idea that I could not receive as much\r\n     instruction as my brothers could. I wanted to be what I felt I\r\n     was capable of becoming, but opportunity was denied me. I rejoice\r\n     in the progress that has been made. I rejoice that so many women\r\n     are here; it denotes that they are waking up to some sense of\r\n     their situation. One of my sisters observed that she had received\r\n     great kindness as a wife, mother, sister, and daughter. I, too,\r\n     have brethren in various directions, both those that are natural,\r\n     and those that are spiritual brethren, as I understand the\r\n     matter; and I rejoice to say I have found, I say it to the honor\r\n     of my brothers, I have found more men than women, who were\r\n     impressed with the wrongs under which our sex labor, and felt the\r\n     need of reformation. I rejoice in this fact.\r\n\r\nRebecca B. Spring followed with some pertinent remarks. Mrs. Emma E.\r\nCoe reviewed in a strain of pungent irony the State Laws in relation\r\nto woman. In discussing the resolutions, Charles List, Esq., of\r\nBoston, said:\r\n\r\n     I lately saw a book wherein the author in a very eloquent, but\r\n     highly wrought sentence, speaks of woman as \"the connecting link\r\n     between man and heaven.\" I think this asks too much, and I deny\r\n     the right of woman to assume such a prerogative; all I claim is\r\n     that woman should be raised by noble aspiration to the loftiest\r\n     moral elevation, and thus be fitted to train men up to become\r\n     worthy companions for the pure, high-minded beings which all\r\n     women should strive to be. A great duty rests on woman, and it\r\n     becomes you not to lose a moment in securing for yourselves every\r\n     right and privilege, whereby you maybe elevated and so prepared\r\n     to exert the influence which man so much needs. Women fall far\r\n     short now of exerting the moral influence intrusted to them as\r\n     mothers and wives, consequently men are imperfectly developed in\r\n     their higher nature.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Nichols rejoined: Woman has been waiting for centuries\r\n     expecting man to go before and lift her up, but he has failed to\r\n     meet our expectations, and now comes the call that she should\r\n     first grasp heaven and pull man up after her.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Coe said: The signs are truly propitious, when man begins to\r\n     complain of his wrongs--women not fit to be wives and mothers!\r\n\r\n     Who placed them in their present position? Who keeps, them there?\r\n     Let woman demand the highest education in our land, and what\r\n     college, with the exception of Oberlin, will receive her? I have\r\n     myself lately made such a demand and been refused simply on the\r\n     ground of sex. Yet what is there in the highest range of\r\n     intellectual pursuits, to which woman may not rightfully aspire?\r\n     What is there, for instance, in theology, which she should not\r\n     strive to learn? Give me only that in religion which woman may\r\n     and should become acquainted with, and the rest may go like chaff\r\n     before the wind.\r\n\r\n     Lucy Stone said: I think it is not without reason that men\r\n     complain of the wives and mothers of to-day. Let us look the fact\r\n     soberly and fairly in the face, and admit that there _is_\r\n     occasion to complain of wives and mothers. But while I say this,\r\n     let me also say that when you can show one woman who is what she\r\n     ought to be as a wife and a mother, you can show not more than\r\n     one man who is what he should be as a husband and father. The\r\n     blame is on both sides. When we add to what woman ought to be for\r\n     her own sake, this other fact, that woman, by reason of her\r\n     maternity, must exert a most potent influence over the\r\n     generations yet to be, there is no language that can speak the\r\n     magnitude or importance of the subject that has called us\r\n     together. He is guilty of giving the world a dwarfed humanity,\r\n     who would seek to hinder this movement for the elevation of\r\n     woman; for she is as yet a starved and dependent outcast before\r\n     the law. In government she is outlawed, having neither voice nor\r\n     part in it. In the household she is either a ceaseless drudge, or\r\n     a blank. In the department of education, in industry, let woman's\r\n     sphere be bounded only by her capacity. We desire there should no\r\n     walls be thrown about it. Let man read his own soul, and turn\r\n     over the pages of his own Book of Life, and learn that in the\r\n     human mind there is always capacity for development, and then let\r\n     him trust woman to that power of growth, no matter who says nay.\r\n     Laying her hand on the helm, let woman steer straight onward to\r\n     the fulfillment of her own destiny. Let her ever remember, that\r\n     in following out the high behests of her own soul will be found\r\n     her exceeding great reward.\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry Channing then gave the report from the committee on the\r\nsocial relations. Those present speak of it as a very able paper on\r\nthat complex question, but as it was not published with the\r\nproceedings, all that can be found is the following meagre abstract\r\nfrom _The Worcester Spy_:\r\n\r\n     Woman has a natural right to the development of all her\r\n     faculties, and to all the advantages that insure this result. She\r\n     has the right not only to civil and legal justice, which lie on\r\n     the outskirts of social life, but to social justice, which\r\n     affects the central position of society.\r\n\r\n     Woman should be as free to marry, or remain single, and as\r\n     honorable in either relation, as man. There should be no stigma\r\n     attached to the single woman, impelling her to avoid the\r\n     possibility of such a position, by crushing her self-respect and\r\n     individual ambition. A true Christian marriage is a sacred union\r\n     of soul and sense, and the issues flowing from it are eternal.\r\n     All obstacles in the way of severing uncongenial marriages should\r\n     be removed, because such unions are unnatural, and must be evil\r\n     in their results. Divorce in such cases should be honorable,\r\n     without subjecting the parties to the shame of exposure in the\r\n     courts, or in the columns of the daily papers.\r\n\r\n     Much could be accomplished for the elevation of woman by\r\n     organizations clustering round a social principle, like those\r\n     already clustered round a religious principle, such as \"Sisters\r\n     of Mercy,\" \"Sisters of Charity,\" etc. There should be social\r\n     orders called \"Sisters of Honor,\" having for their object the\r\n     interests of unfortunate women. From these would spring up\r\n     convents, where those who have escaped from false marriages and\r\n     illegal social relations would find refuge. These organizations\r\n     might send out missionaries to gather the despised Magdalens into\r\n     safe retreats, and raise them to the level of true womanhood.\r\n\r\nMr. Channing spoke at length on the civil and political position of\r\nwoman, eloquently advocating the rightfulness and expediency of\r\nwoman's co-sovereignty with man, and closed by reading a very eloquent\r\nletter from Jeanne Deroine and Pauline Roland, two remarkable French\r\nwomen, then in the prison of St. Lagare, in Paris, for their liberal\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nJust as the agitation for woman's rights began in this country,\r\nPauline Roland began in France a vigorous demand for her rights as a\r\ncitizen. The 27th of February, 1848, she presented herself before the\r\nelectoral reunion to claim the right of nominating the mayor of the\r\ncity where she lived. Having been refused, she claimed in April of the\r\nsame year the right to take part in the elections for the Constituent\r\nAssembly, and was again refused. On April 12, 1849, Jeanne Deroine\r\nclaimed for woman the right of eligibility by presenting herself as a\r\ncandidate for the Legislative Assembly, and she sustained this right\r\nbefore the preparatory electoral reunions of Paris. On the 3d of\r\nOctober Jeanne Deroine and Pauline Roland, delegates from the\r\nfraternal associations, were elected members of the Central Committee\r\nof the Associative Unions. This Central Committee was for the\r\nfraternal associations what the Constituent Assembly was for the\r\nFrench Republic in 1848.\r\n\r\n     _To the Convention of the Women of America_:\r\n\r\n     DEAR SISTERS:--Your courageous declaration of Woman's Rights has\r\n     resounded even to our prison, and has filled our souls with\r\n     inexpressible joy.\r\n\r\n     In France the reaction has suppressed the cry of liberty of the\r\n     women of the future. Deprived, like their brothers, of the\r\n     Democracy, of the right to civil and political equality, and the\r\n     fiscal laws which trammel the liberty of the press, hinder the\r\n     propagation of those eternal truths which must regenerate\r\n     humanity.\r\n\r\n     They wish the women of France to found a hospitable tribunal,\r\n     which shall receive the cry of the oppressed and suffering, and\r\n     vindicate in the name of humanity, solidarity, the social right\r\n     for both sexes equally; and where woman, the mother of humanity,\r\n     may claim in the name of her children, mutilated by tyranny, her\r\n     right to true liberty, to the complete development and free\r\n     exercise of all her faculties, and reveal that half of truth\r\n     which is in her, and without which no social work can be\r\n     complete.\r\n\r\n     The darkness of reaction has obscured the sun of 1848, which\r\n     seemed to rise so radiantly. Why? Because the revolutionary\r\n     tempest, in overturning at the same time the throne and the\r\n     scaffold, in breaking the chain of the black slave, forgot to\r\n     break the chain of the most oppressed of all of the pariahs of\r\n     humanity.\r\n\r\n     \"There shall be no more slaves,\" said our brethren. \"We proclaim\r\n     universal suffrage. All shall have the right to elect the agents\r\n     who shall carry out the Constitution which should be based on the\r\n     principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity. Let each one\r\n     come and deposit his vote; the barrier of privilege is\r\n     overturned; before the electoral urn there are no more oppressed,\r\n     no more masters and slaves.\"\r\n\r\n     Woman, in listening to this appeal, rises and approaches the\r\n     liberating urn to exercise her right of suffrage as a member of\r\n     society. But the barrier of privilege rises also before her. \"You\r\n     must wait,\" they say. But by this claim alone woman affirms the\r\n     right, not yet recognized, of the half of humanity--the right of\r\n     woman to liberty, equality, and fraternity. She obliges man to\r\n     verify the fatal attack which he makes on the integrity of his\r\n     principles.\r\n\r\n     Soon, in fact during the wonderful days of June, 1848, liberty\r\n     glides from her pedestal in the flood of the victims of the\r\n     reaction; based on the \"right of the strongest,\" she falls,\r\n     overturned in the name of \"the right of the strongest.\"\r\n\r\n     The Assembly kept silence in regard to the right of one-half of\r\n     humanity, for which only one of its members raised his voice, but\r\n     in vain. No mention was made of the right of woman in a\r\n     Constitution framed in the name of Liberty, Equality, and\r\n     Fraternity.\r\n\r\n     It is in the name of these principles that woman comes to claim\r\n     her right to take part in the Legislative Assembly, and to help\r\n     to form the laws which must govern society, of which she is a\r\n     member.\r\n\r\n     She comes to demand of the electors the consecration of the\r\n     principle of equality by the election of a woman, and by this act\r\n     she obliges man to prove that the fundamental law which he has\r\n     formed in the sole name of liberty, equality, and fraternity, is\r\n     still based upon privilege, and soon privilege triumphs over this\r\n     phantom of universal suffrage, which, being but half of itself,\r\n     sinks on the 31st of May, 1850.\r\n\r\n     But while those selected by the half of the people--by men\r\n     alone--evoke force to stifle liberty, and forge restrictive laws\r\n     to establish order by compression, woman, guided by fraternity,\r\n     foreseeing incessant struggles, and in the hope of putting an end\r\n     to them, makes an appeal to the laborer to found liberty and\r\n     equality on fraternal solidarity. The participation of woman gave\r\n     to this work of enfranchisement an eminently pacific character,\r\n     and the laborer recognizes the right of woman, his companion in\r\n     labor.\r\n\r\n     The delegates of a hundred and four associations, united, without\r\n     distinction of sex, elected two women, with several of their\r\n     brethren, to participate equally with them in the administration\r\n     of the interests of labor, and in the organization of the work of\r\n     solidarity.\r\n\r\n     Fraternal associations were formed with the object of\r\n     enfranchising the laborer from the yoke of spoilage and\r\n     patronage, but, isolated in the midst of the Old World, their\r\n     efforts could only produce a feeble amelioration for themselves.\r\n\r\n     The union of associations based on fraternal solidarity had for\r\n     its end the organization of labor; that is to say, an equal\r\n     division of labor, of instruments, and of the products of labor.\r\n\r\n     The means were, the union of labor, and of credit among the\r\n     workers of all professions, in order to acquire the instruments\r\n     of labor and the necessary materials, and to form a mutual\r\n     guarantee for the education of their children, and to provide for\r\n     the needs of the old, the sick, and the infirm.\r\n\r\n     In this organization all the workers, without distinction of sex\r\n     or profession, having an equal right to election, and being\r\n     eligible for all functions, and all having equally the initiative\r\n     and the sovereign decision in the acts of common interests, they\r\n     laid the foundation of a new society based on liberty, equality,\r\n     and fraternity.\r\n\r\n     It is in the name of law framed by man only--by those elected by\r\n     privilege--that the Old World, wishing to stifle in the germ the\r\n     holy work of pacific enfranchisement, has shut up within the\r\n     walls of a prison those who had founded it--those elected by the\r\n     laborers.\r\n\r\n     But the impulse has been given, a grand act has been\r\n     accomplished. The right of woman has been recognized by the\r\n     laborers, and they have consecrated that right by the election of\r\n     those who had claimed it in vain for both sexes, before the\r\n     electoral urn and before the electoral committees. They have\r\n     received the true civil baptism, were elected by the laborers to\r\n     accomplish the mission of enfranchisement, and after having\r\n     shared their rights and their duties, they share to-day their\r\n     captivity.\r\n\r\n     It is from the depths of their prison that they address to you\r\n     the relation of these facts, which contain in themselves high\r\n     instruction. It is by labor, it is by entering resolutely into\r\n     the ranks of the working people, that women will conquer the\r\n     civil and political equality on which depends the happiness of\r\n     the world. As to moral equality, has she not conquered it by the\r\n     power of sentiment? It is, therefore, by the sentiment of the\r\n     love of humanity that the mother of humanity will find power to\r\n     accomplish her high mission. It is when she shall have well\r\n     comprehended the holy law of solidarity--which is not an obscure\r\n     and mysterious dogma, but a living providential fact--that the\r\n     kingdom of God promised by Jesus, and which is no other than the\r\n     kingdom of equality and justice, shall be realized on earth.\r\n\r\n     Sisters of America! your socialist sisters of France are united\r\n     with you in the vindication of the right of woman to civil and\r\n     political equality. We have, moreover, the profound conviction\r\n     that only by the power of association based on solidarity--by the\r\n     union of the working-classes of both sexes to organize labor--can\r\n     be acquired, completely and pacifically, the civil and political\r\n     equality of woman, and the social right for all.\r\n\r\n     It is in this confidence that, from the depths of the jail which\r\n     still imprisons our bodies without reaching our hearts, we cry to\r\n     you, Faith, Love, Hope, and send to you our sisterly salutations,\r\n\r\n                                             JEANNE DEROINE,\r\n                                             PAULINE ROLAND.\r\n\r\n     PARIS, PRISON OF ST. LAGARE, _June 15, 1851_.\r\n\r\nErnestine L. Rose, having known something of European despotism,\r\nfollowed Mr. Channing in a speech of great pathos and power. She said:\r\n\r\n     After having heard the letter read from our poor incarcerated\r\n     sisters of France, well might we exclaim, Alas, poor France!\r\n     where is thy glory? Where the glory of the Revolution of 1848, in\r\n     which shone forth the pure and magnanimous spirit of an oppressed\r\n     nation struggling for Freedom? Where the fruits of that victory\r\n     that gave to the world the motto, \"Liberty, Equality, and\r\n     Fraternity\"? A motto destined to hurl the tyranny of kings and\r\n     priests into the dust, and give freedom to the enslaved millions\r\n     of the earth. Where, I again ask, is the result of those noble\r\n     achievements, when woman, ay, one-half of the nation, is deprived\r\n     of her rights? Has woman then been idle during the contest\r\n     between \"right and might\"? Has she been wanting in ardor and\r\n     enthusiasm? Has she not mingled her blood with that of her\r\n     husband, son, and sire? Or has she been recreant in hailing the\r\n     motto of liberty floating on your banners as an omen of justice,\r\n     peace, and freedom to man, that at the first step she takes\r\n     practically to claim the recognition of her rights, she is\r\n     rewarded with the doom of a martyr?\r\n\r\n     But right has not yet asserted her prerogative, for might rules\r\n     the day; and as every good cause must have its martyrs, why\r\n     should woman not be a martyr for her cause? But need we wonder\r\n     that France, governed as she is by Russian and Austrian\r\n     despotism, does not recognize the rights of humanity in the\r\n     recognition of the rights of woman, when even here, in this\r\n     far-famed land of freedom, under a Republic that has inscribed on\r\n     its banner the great truth that \"all men are created free and\r\n     equal, and endowed with inalienable rights to life, liberty, and\r\n     the pursuit of happiness\"--a declaration borne, like the vision\r\n     of hope, on wings of light to the remotest parts of the earth, an\r\n     omen of freedom to the oppressed and down-trodden children of\r\n     man--when, even here, in the very face of this eternal truth,\r\n     woman, the mockingly so-called \"better half\" of man, has yet to\r\n     plead for her rights, nay, for her life. For what is life without\r\n     liberty, and what is liberty without equality of rights? And as\r\n     for the pursuit of happiness, she is not allowed to choose any\r\n     line of action that might promote it; she has only thankfully to\r\n     accept what man in his magnanimity decides as best for her to do,\r\n     and this is what he does not choose to do himself.\r\n\r\n     Is she then not included in that declaration? Answer, ye wise men\r\n     of the nation, and answer truly; add not hypocrisy to oppression!\r\n     Say that she is not created free and equal, and therefore (for\r\n     the sequence follows on the premise) that she is not entitled to\r\n     life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But with all the\r\n     audacity arising from an assumed superiority, you dare not so\r\n     libel and insult humanity as to say, that she is not included in\r\n     that declaration; and if she is, then what right has man, except\r\n     that of might, to deprive woman of the rights and privileges he\r\n     claims for himself? And why, in the name of reason and justice,\r\n     why should she not have the same rights? Because she is woman?\r\n     Humanity recognizes no sex; virtue recognizes no sex; mind\r\n     recognizes no sex; life and death, pleasure and pain, happiness\r\n     and misery, recognize no sex. Like man, woman comes involuntarily\r\n     into existence; like him, she possesses physical and mental and\r\n     moral powers, on the proper cultivation of which depends her\r\n     happiness; like him she is subject to all the vicissitudes of\r\n     life; like him she has to pay the penalty for disobeying nature's\r\n     laws, and far greater penalties has she to suffer from ignorance\r\n     of her more complicated nature; like him she enjoys or suffers\r\n     with her country. Yet she is not recognized as his equal!\r\n\r\n     In the laws of the land she has no rights; in government she has\r\n     no voice. And in spite of another principle, recognized in this\r\n     Republic, namely, that \"taxation without representation is\r\n     tyranny,\" she is taxed without being represented. Her property\r\n     may be consumed by taxes to defray the expenses of that unholy,\r\n     unrighteous custom called war, yet she has no power to give her\r\n     vote against it. From the cradle to the grave she is subject to\r\n     the power and control of man. Father, guardian, or husband, one\r\n     conveys her like some piece of merchandise over to the other.\r\n\r\n     At marriage she loses her entire identity, and her being is said\r\n     to have become merged in her husband. Has nature thus merged it?\r\n     Has she ceased to exist and feel pleasure and pain? When she\r\n     violates the laws of her being, does her husband pay the penalty?\r\n     When she breaks the moral laws, does he suffer the punishment?\r\n     When he supplies his wants, is it enough to satisfy her nature?\r\n     And when at his nightly orgies, in the grog-shop and the\r\n     oyster-cellar, or at the gaming-table, he squanders the means she\r\n     helped, by her co-operation and economy, to accumulate, and she\r\n     awakens to penury and destitution, will it supply the wants of\r\n     her children to tell them that, owing to the superiority of man\r\n     she had no redress by law, and that as her being was merged in\r\n     his, so also ought theirs to be? What an inconsistency, that from\r\n     the moment she enters that compact, in which she assumes the high\r\n     responsibility of wife and mother, she ceases legally to exist,\r\n     and becomes a purely submissive being. Blind submission in woman\r\n     is considered a virtue, while submission to wrong is itself\r\n     wrong, and resistance to wrong is virtue, alike in woman as in\r\n     man.\r\n\r\n     But it will be said that the husband provides for the wife, or in\r\n     other words, he feeds, clothes, and shelters her! I wish I had\r\n     the power to make every one before me fully realize the\r\n     degradation contained in that idea. Yes! he _keeps_ her, and so\r\n     he does a favorite horse; by law they are both considered his\r\n     property. Both may, when the cruelty of the owner compels them\r\n     to, run away, be brought back by the strong arm of the law, and\r\n     according to a still extant law of England, both may be led by\r\n     the halter to the market-place, and sold. This is humiliating\r\n     indeed, but nevertheless true; and the sooner these things are\r\n     known and understood, the better for humanity. It is no fancy\r\n     sketch. I know that some endeavor to throw the mantle of romance\r\n     over the subject, and treat woman like some ideal existence, not\r\n     liable to the ills of life. Let those deal in fancy, that have\r\n     nothing better to deal in; we have to do with sober, sad\r\n     realities, with stubborn facts.\r\n\r\n     Again, I shall be told that the law presumes the husband to be\r\n     kind, affectionate, and ready to provide for and protect his\r\n     wife. But what right, I ask, has the law to presume at all on the\r\n     subject? What right has the law to intrust the interest and\r\n     happiness of one being into the hands of another? And if the\r\n     merging of the interest of one being into the other is a\r\n     necessary consequence on marriage, why should woman always remain\r\n     on the losing side? Turn the tables. Let the identity and\r\n     interest of the husband be merged in the wife. Think you she\r\n     would act less generously toward him, than he toward her? Think\r\n     you she is not capable of as much justice, disinterested\r\n     devotion, and abiding affection, as he is? Oh, how grossly you\r\n     misunderstand and wrong her nature! But we desire no such undue\r\n     power over man; it would be as wrong in her to exercise it as it\r\n     now is in him. All we claim is an equal legal and social\r\n     position. We have nothing to do with individual man, be he good\r\n     or bad, but with the laws that oppress woman. We know that bad\r\n     and unjust laws must in the nature of things make man so too. If\r\n     he is kind, affectionate, and consistent, it is because the\r\n     kindlier feelings, instilled by a mother, kept warm by a sister,\r\n     and cherished by a wife, will not allow him to carry out these\r\n     barbarous laws against woman.\r\n\r\n     But the estimation she is generally held in, is as degrading as\r\n     it is foolish. Man forgets that woman can not be degraded without\r\n     its reacting on himself. The impress of her mind is stamped on\r\n     him by nature, and the early education of the mother, which no\r\n     after-training can entirely efface; and therefore, the estimation\r\n     she is held in falls back with double force upon him. Yet, from\r\n     the force of prejudice against her, he knows it not. Not long\r\n     ago, I saw an account of two offenders, brought before a Justice\r\n     of New York. One was charged with stealing a pair of boots, for\r\n     which offense he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment; the\r\n     other crime was assault and battery upon his wife: he was let off\r\n     with a reprimand from the judge! With my principles, I am\r\n     entirely opposed to punishment, and hold, that to reform the\r\n     erring and remove the causes of evil is much more efficient, as\r\n     well as just, than to punish. But the judge showed us the\r\n     comparative value which he set on these two kinds of _property_.\r\n     But then you must remember that the boots were taken by a\r\n     stranger, while the wife was insulted by her legal owner! Here it\r\n     will be said, that such degrading cases are but few. For the sake\r\n     of humanity, I hope they are. But as long as woman shall be\r\n     oppressed by unequal laws, so long will she be degraded by man.\r\n\r\n     We have hardly an adequate idea how all-powerful law is in\r\n     forming public opinion, in giving tone and character to the mass\r\n     of society. To illustrate my point, look at that infamous,\r\n     detestable law, which was written in human blood, and signed and\r\n     sealed with life and liberty, that eternal stain on the statute\r\n     book of this country, the Fugitive Slave Law. Think you that\r\n     before its passage, you could have found any in the free\r\n     States--except a few politicians in the market--base enough to\r\n     desire such a law? No! no! Even those who took no interest in the\r\n     slave question, would have shrunk from so barbarous a thing. But\r\n     no sooner was it passed, than the ignorant mass, the rabble of\r\n     the self-styled Union Safety Committee, found out that we were a\r\n     law-loving, law-abiding people! Such is the magic power of Law.\r\n     Hence the necessity to guard against bad ones. Hence also the\r\n     reason why we call on the nation to remove the legal shackles\r\n     from woman, and it will have a beneficial effect on that still\r\n     greater tyrant she has to contend with, Public Opinion.\r\n\r\n     Carry out the republican principle of universal suffrage, or\r\n     strike it from your banners and substitute \"Freedom and Power to\r\n     one half of society, and Submission and Slavery to the other.\"\r\n     Give woman the elective franchise. Let married women have the\r\n     same right to property that their husbands have; for whatever the\r\n     difference in their respective occupations, the duties of the\r\n     wife are as indispensable and far more arduous than the\r\n     husband's. Why then should the wife, at the death of her husband,\r\n     not be his heir to the same extent that he is heir to her? In\r\n     this inequality there is involved another wrong. When the wife\r\n     dies, the husband is left in the undisturbed possession of all\r\n     there is, and the children are left with him; no change is made,\r\n     no stranger intrudes on his home and his affliction. But when the\r\n     husband dies, the widow, at best receives but a mere pittance,\r\n     while strangers assume authority denied to the wife. The\r\n     sanctuary of affliction must be desecrated by executors;\r\n     everything must be ransacked and assessed, lest she should steal\r\n     something out of her own house: and to cap the climax, the\r\n     children must be placed under guardians. When the husband dies\r\n     poor, to be sure, no guardian is required, and the children are\r\n     left for the mother to care and toil for, as best she may. But\r\n     when anything is left for their maintenance, then it must be\r\n     placed in the hands of strangers for safe keeping! The\r\n     bringing-up and safety of the children are left with the mother,\r\n     and safe they are in her hands. But a few hundred or thousand\r\n     dollars can not be intrusted with her!\r\n\r\n     But, say they, \"in case of a second marriage, the children must\r\n     be protected in their property.\" Does that reason not hold as\r\n     good in the case of the husband as in that of the wife? Oh, no!\r\n     When _he_ marries again, he still retains his identity and power\r\n     to act; but _she_ becomes merged once more into a mere nonentity;\r\n     and therefore the first husband must rob her to prevent the\r\n     second from doing so! Make the laws regulating property between\r\n     husband and wife, equal for both, and all these difficulties\r\n     would be removed.\r\n\r\n     According to a late act, the wife has a right to the property she\r\n     brings at marriage, or receives in any way after marriage. Here\r\n     is some provision for the favored few; but for the laboring many,\r\n     there is none. The mass of the people commence life with no other\r\n     capital than the union of heads, hearts, and hands. To the\r\n     benefit of this best of capital, the wife has no right. If they\r\n     are unsuccessful in married life, who suffers more the bitter\r\n     consequences of poverty than the wife? But if successful, she can\r\n     not call a dollar her own. The husband may will away every dollar\r\n     of the personal property, and leave her destitute and penniless,\r\n     and she has no redress by law. And even where real estate is left\r\n     she receives but a life-interest in a third part of it, and at\r\n     her death, she can not leave it to any one belonging to her: it\r\n     falls back even to the remotest of his relatives. This is law,\r\n     but where is the justice of it? Well might we say that laws were\r\n     made to prevent, not to promote, the ends of justice.\r\n\r\n     In case of separation, why should the children be taken from the\r\n     protecting care of the mother? Who has a better right to them\r\n     than she? How much do fathers generally do toward bringing them\r\n     up? When he comes home from business, and the child is in good\r\n     humor and handsome trim, he takes the little darling on his knee\r\n     and plays with it. But when the wife, with the care of the whole\r\n     household on her shoulders, with little or no help, is not able\r\n     to put them in the best order, how much does he do for them? Oh,\r\n     no! Fathers like to have children good natured, well-behaved, and\r\n     comfortable, but how to put them in that desirable condition is\r\n     out of their philosophy. Children always depend more on the\r\n     tender, watchful care of the mother, than of the father. Whether\r\n     from nature, habit, or both, the mother is much more capable of\r\n     administering to their health and comfort than the father, and\r\n     therefore she has the best right to them. And where there is\r\n     property, it ought to be divided equally between them, with an\r\n     additional provision from the father toward the maintenance and\r\n     education of the children.\r\n\r\n     Much is said about the burdens and responsibilities of married\r\n     men. Responsibilities indeed there are, if they but felt them;\r\n     but as to burdens, what are they? The sole province of man seems\r\n     to be centered in that one thing, attending to some business. I\r\n     grant that owing to the present unjust and unequal reward for\r\n     labor, many have to work too hard for a subsistence; but whatever\r\n     his vocation, he has to attend as much to it before as after\r\n     marriage. Look at your bachelors, and see if they do not strive\r\n     as much for wealth, and attend as steadily to business, as\r\n     married men. No! the husband has little or no increase of burden,\r\n     and every increase of comfort after marriage; while most of the\r\n     burdens, cares, pains, and penalties of married life fall on the\r\n     wife. How unjust and cruel, then, to have all the laws in his\r\n     favor! If any difference should be made by law between husband\r\n     and wife, reason, justice, and humanity, if their voices were\r\n     heard, would dictate that it should be in her favor.\r\n\r\n     No! there is no reason against woman's elevation, but there are\r\n     deep-rooted, hoary-headed prejudices. The main cause of them is,\r\n     a pernicious falsehood propagated against her being, namely, that\r\n     she is inferior by her nature. Inferior in what? What has man\r\n     ever done, that woman, under the same advantages, could not do?\r\n     In morals, bad as she is, she is generally considered his\r\n     superior. In the intellectual sphere, give her a fair chance\r\n     before you pronounce a verdict against her. Cultivate the frontal\r\n     portion of her brain as much as that of man is cultivated, and\r\n     she will stand his equal at least. Even now, where her mind has\r\n     been called out at all, her intellect is as bright, as capacious,\r\n     and as powerful as his. Will you tell us, that women have no\r\n     Newtons, Shakespeares, and Byrons? Greater natural powers than\r\n     even those possessed may have been destroyed in woman for want of\r\n     proper culture, a just appreciation, reward for merit as an\r\n     incentive to exertion, and freedom of action, without which, mind\r\n     becomes cramped and stifled, for it can not expand under bolts\r\n     and bars; and yet, amid all blighting, crushing\r\n     circumstances--confined within the narrowest possible limits,\r\n     trampled upon by prejudice and injustice, from her education and\r\n     position forced to occupy herself almost exclusively with the\r\n     most trivial affairs--in spite of all these difficulties, her\r\n     intellect is as good as his. The few bright meteors in man's\r\n     intellectual horizon could well be matched by woman, were she\r\n     allowed to occupy the same elevated position. There is no need of\r\n     naming the De Staëls, the Rolands, the Somervilles, the\r\n     Wollstonecrofts, the Sigourneys, the Wrights, the Martineaus, the\r\n     Hemanses, the Fullers, Jagellos, and many more of modern as well\r\n     as ancient times, to prove her mental powers, her patriotism, her\r\n     self-sacrificing devotion to the cause of humanity, and the\r\n     eloquence that gushes from her pen, or from her tongue. These\r\n     things are too well known to require repetition. And do you ask\r\n     for fortitude, energy, and perseverance? Then look at woman under\r\n     suffering, reverse of fortune, and affliction, when the strength\r\n     and power of man have sunk to the lowest ebb, when his mind is\r\n     overwhelmed by the dark waters of despair. She, like the tender\r\n     ivy plant bent yet unbroken by the storms of life, not only\r\n     upholds her own hopeful courage, but clings around the\r\n     tempest-fallen oak, to speak hope to his faltering spirit, and\r\n     shelter him from the returning blast of the storm.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the speeches of Elizabeth Oakes Smith, Abby Kelly\r\nFoster, Clarina Howard Nichols, Antoinette Brown, and Lucy Stone, and\r\nthe well-digested reports by Paulina Wright Davis on Education, Abby\r\nPrice on Industry, and William Henry Channing on the Social Relations,\r\ncomprising the whole range of woman's rights and duties, we feel that\r\nthe report of one of these meetings settles the question of woman's\r\ncapacity to reason. At every session of this two days' Convention\r\nBrinley Hall was so crowded at an early hour that hundreds were unable\r\nto gain admittance. Accordingly, the last evening it was proposed to\r\nadjourn to the City Hall; and even that spacious auditorium was\r\ncrowded long before the hour for assembling. It may be said with\r\ntruth, that in the whole history of the woman suffrage movement there\r\nnever was at one time more able and eloquent men and women on our\r\nplatform, and represented by letter there, than in these Worcester\r\nConventions, which called out numerous complimentary comments and\r\neditorial notices, notably the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n     [_From the New York Christian Inquirer_, Rev. Henry Bellows,\r\n     D.D., editor.]\r\n\r\n             THE WOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION AT WORCESTER.\r\n\r\n     We have read the report of the proceedings of this Convention\r\n     with lively interest and general satisfaction. We confess\r\n     ourselves to be much surprised at the prevailing good sense,\r\n     propriety, and moral elevation of the meeting. No candid reader\r\n     can deny the existence of singular ability, honest and pure aims,\r\n     eloquent and forcible advocacy, and a startling power in the\r\n     reports and speeches of this Convention. For good, or for evil,\r\n     it seems to us to be the most important meeting since that held\r\n     in the cabin of the _Mayflower_. That meeting recognized the\r\n     social and political equality of one-half the human race; this\r\n     asserts the social and political equality of the other half, and\r\n     of the whole. Imagine the difference which it would have made in\r\n     our Declaration of Independence, to have inserted \"and women\" in\r\n     the first clause of the self-evident truths it asserts: \"that all\r\n     men _and women_ are created equal.\" This Convention declares this\r\n     to be the true interpretation of the Declaration, and at any\r\n     rate, designs to amend the popular reading of the instrument to\r\n     this effect. Nor is it a theoretical change which is aimed at. No\r\n     more practical or tremendous revolution was ever sought in\r\n     society, than that which this Woman's Rights Convention\r\n     inaugurates. To emancipate half the human race from its present\r\n     position of dependence on the other half; to abolish every\r\n     distinction between the sexes that can be abolished, or which is\r\n     maintained by statute or conventional usage; to throw open all\r\n     the employments of society with equal freedom to men and women;\r\n     to allow no difference whatsoever, in the eye of the law, in\r\n     their duties or their rights, this, we submit, is a reform,\r\n     surpassing, in pregnancy of purpose and potential results, any\r\n     other now upon the platform, if it do not outweigh Magna Charta\r\n     and our Declaration themselves.\r\n\r\n     We very well recollect the scorn with which the annual procession\r\n     of the first Abolitionists was greeted in Boston, some thirty\r\n     years ago. The children had no conception of the \"Bobolition\r\n     Society,\" but as of a set of persons making themselves ridiculous\r\n     for the amusement of the public; but that \"Bobolition Society\"\r\n     has shaken the Union to its center, and filled the world with\r\n     sympathy and concern. The Woman's Rights Convention is in like\r\n     manner a thing for honest scorn to point its finger at; but a few\r\n     years may prove that we pointed the finger, not at an illuminated\r\n     balloon, but at the rising sun.\r\n\r\n     We have no hesitation in acknowledging ourselves to be among\r\n     those who have regarded this movement with decided distrust and\r\n     distaste. If we have been more free than others to express this\r\n     disgust, we have perhaps rendered some service, by representing a\r\n     common sentiment with which this reform has to contend. We would\r\n     be among the first to acknowledge that our objections have not\r\n     grown out of any deliberate consideration of the principles\r\n     involved in the question. They have been founded on instinctive\r\n     aversion, on an habitual respect for public sentiment, on an\r\n     irresistible feeling of the ludicrousness of the proposed reform\r\n     in its details. Certainly social instinct has its proper place in\r\n     the judgments we pass on the manners of both sexes. What is\r\n     offensive to good taste--meaning by good taste, the taste of the\r\n     most educated and refined people--has the burden of proof resting\r\n     upon it when it claims respect and attention. But we should be\r\n     the last to assert that questions of right and rights have no\r\n     appeal from the bar of conventional taste to that of reason.\r\n\r\n     And however it may have been at the outset, we think the Woman's\r\n     Rights question has now made good its title to be heard in the\r\n     superior court. The principles involved in this great question we\r\n     can not now discuss; but we have a few thoughts upon the attitude\r\n     of the reformer toward society, which we would respectfully\r\n     commend to attention. If the female sex is injured in its present\r\n     position, it is an injury growing out of universal mistake; an\r\n     honest error, in which the sexes have conspired, without\r\n     intentional injustice on one side, or feeling of wrong on the\r\n     other. Indeed, we could not admit that there had been thus far\r\n     any wrong or mistake at all, except in details. Mankind have\r\n     hitherto found the natural functions of the two sexes marking out\r\n     different spheres for them. Thus far, as we think, the\r\n     circumstances of the world have compelled a marked division of\r\n     labor, and a marked difference of culture and political position\r\n     between the sexes.\r\n\r\n     The facts of superior bodily strength on the masculine side, and\r\n     of maternity on the feminine side, small as they are now made to\r\n     appear, are very great and decisive facts in themselves, and have\r\n     necessarily governed the organization of society. It is between\r\n     the sexes, as between the races, the strongest rules; and it has\r\n     hitherto been supposed to be of service to the common interest of\r\n     society, that this rule should be legalized and embodied in the\r\n     social customs of every community. As a fact, woman, by her\r\n     bodily weakness and her maternal office, was from the first, a\r\n     comparatively private and domestic creature; her education, from\r\n     circumstances, was totally different, her interests were\r\n     different, the sources of her happiness different from man's, and\r\n     as a fact, all these things, though with important modifications,\r\n     have continued to be so to this day. The fact has seemed to the\r\n     world a final one. It has been thought that in her present\r\n     position, she was in her best position relative to man, which her\r\n     nature or organization admitted of. That she is man's inferior in\r\n     respect to all offices and duties requiring great bodily powers,\r\n     or great moral courage, or great intellectual effort, has been\r\n     almost universally supposed,--honestly thought too, and without\r\n     the least disposition to deny her equality, on this account, in\r\n     the scale of humanity.\r\n\r\n     For in respect to moral sensibility, affections, manners, tastes,\r\n     and the passive virtues, woman has long been honestly felt to be\r\n     the superior of man. The political disfranchisement of women, and\r\n     their seclusion from publicity, have grown out of sincere\r\n     convictions that their nature and happiness demanded from man an\r\n     exemption from the cares, and a protection from the perils of the\r\n     out-of-door world. Mankind, in both its parts, may have been\r\n     utterly mistaken in this judgment; but it has been nearly\r\n     universal, and thoroughly sincere,--based thus far, we think,\r\n     upon staring facts and compulsory circumstances.\r\n\r\n     In starting a radical reform upon this subject, it is expedient\r\n     that it should be put, not on the basis of old grievances, but\r\n     upon the ground of new light, of recent and fresh experiences, of\r\n     change of circumstances. It may be that the relative position of\r\n     the sexes is so changed by an advancing civilization, that the\r\n     time has come for questioning the conclusion of the world\r\n     respecting woman's sphere. All surprise at opposition to this\r\n     notion, all sense of injury, all complaint of past injustice,\r\n     ought to cease. Woman's part has been the part which her actual\r\n     state made necessary. If another and a better future is opening,\r\n     let us see it and rejoice in it as a new gift of Providence.\r\n\r\n     And we are not without suspicion that the time for some great\r\n     change has arrived. At any rate, we confess our surprise at the\r\n     weight of the reasoning brought forward by the recent Convention,\r\n     and shall endeavor henceforth to keep our masculine mind,--full,\r\n     doubtless, of conventional prejudices,--open to the light which\r\n     is shed upon the theme.\r\n\r\n     Meanwhile, we must beg the women who are pressing this reform, to\r\n     consider that the conservatism of instinct and taste, though not\r\n     infallible, in respectable and worth attention. The opposition\r\n     they will receive is founded on prejudices that are not selfish,\r\n     but merely masculine. It springs from no desire to keep women\r\n     down, but from a desire to keep them up; from a feeling, mistaken\r\n     it may be, that their strength, and their dignity, and their\r\n     happiness, lie in their seclusion from the rivalries, strifes,\r\n     and public duties of life. The strength and depth of the respect\r\n     and love for woman, as woman, which characterize this age, can\r\n     not be overstated. But woman insists upon being respected, as a\r\n     kindred intellect, a free competitor, and a political equal. And\r\n     we have suspicions that she may surprise the conservative world\r\n     by making her pretensions good. Only meanwhile let her respect\r\n     the affectionate and sincere prejudices, if they be prejudices,\r\n     which adhere to the other view, a view made honorable, if not\r\n     proved true, by the experiences of all the ages of the past. We\r\n     hope to give the whole subject more attention in future. Indeed\r\n     it will force attention. It may be the solution of many social\r\n     problems, long waiting an answer, is delayed by the neglect to\r\n     take woman's case into fuller consideration. The success of the\r\n     present reform would give an entirely new problem to political\r\n     and social philosophers! At present we endeavor to hold ourselves\r\n     in a candid suspense.\r\n\r\nJudging Dr. Bellows by the above editorial, he had made some progress\r\nin one year. A former article from his pen called out the following\r\ncriticism from Mrs. Rose:\r\n\r\n     After last year's Woman's Convention, I saw an article in the\r\n     _Christian Inquirer_, a Unitarian paper, edited by the Rev. Mr.\r\n     Bellows, of New York, where, in reply to a correspondent on the\r\n     subject of Woman's Rights, in which he strenuously opposed her\r\n     taking part in anything in public, he said: \"Place woman\r\n     unbonneted and unshawled before the public gaze and what becomes\r\n     of her modesty and her virtue?\" In his benighted mind, the\r\n     modesty and virtue of woman is of so fragile a nature, that when\r\n     it is in contact with the atmosphere, it evaporates like\r\n     chloroform. But I refrain to comment on such a sentiment. It\r\n     carries with it its own deep condemnation. When I read the\r\n     article, I earnestly wished I had the ladies of the writer's\r\n     congregation before me, to see whether they could realize the\r\n     estimation their pastor held them in. Yet I hardly know which\r\n     sentiment was strongest in me, contempt for such foolish\r\n     opinions, or pity for a man that has so degrading an opinion of\r\n     woman--of the being that gave him life, that sustained his\r\n     helpless infancy with her ever-watchful care, and laid the very\r\n     foundation for the little mind he may possess--of the being he\r\n     took to his bosom as the partner of his joys and sorrows--the one\r\n     whom, when he strove to win her affection, he courted, as all\r\n     such men court woman, like some divinity. Such a man deserves our\r\n     pity; for I can not realize that a man purposely and willfully\r\n     degrades his mother, sister, wife, and daughter. No! my better\r\n     nature, my best knowledge and conviction forbid me to believe it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNA.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1853, Paulina Wright Davis started a woman's paper called\r\n_The Una_, published in Providence, Rhode Island, with the following\r\nprospectus:\r\n\r\n     Usage makes it necessary to present our readers with a prospectus\r\n     setting forth our aims and objects. Our plan is to publish a\r\n     paper monthly, devoted to the interests of woman. Our purpose is\r\n     to speak clear, earnest words of truth and soberness in a spirit\r\n     of kindness. To discuss the rights, duties, sphere, and destiny\r\n     of woman fully and fearlessly. So far as our voice shall be\r\n     heard, it will be ever on the side of freedom. We shall not\r\n     confine ourselves to any locality, sex, sect, class, or caste,\r\n     for we hold to the solidarity of the race, and believe if one\r\n     member suffers, all suffer, and the highest made to atone for the\r\n     lowest. Our mystical name, _The Una_, signifying _Truth_, will be\r\n     to us a constant suggestion of fidelity to all.\r\n\r\n_The Una_ could boast for its correspondents some of the ablest men\r\nand women in the nation; such as William H. Channing, Elizabeth\r\nPeabody, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Rev. A. D. Mayo, Dr. William\r\nElder, Ednah D. Cheney, Caroline H. Dall, Fanny Fern, Elizabeth Oakes\r\nSmith, Frances D. Gage, Hannah Tracy Cutler, Abby H. Price, Marion\r\nFinch, of Liverpool, Hon. John Neal, of Portland, Lucy Stone, and\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton.\r\n\r\nFor some time Mrs. Dall assisted in the editorial department. _The\r\nUna_ was the first pronounced Woman Suffrage paper; it lived three\r\nyears. Glancing over the bound volumes, one may glean much valuable\r\ninformation of what was said and done during that period. We learn\r\nthat Lady Grace Vandeleur, in person, canvassed the election of\r\nKilrush, Ireland, and from her ladyship's open carriage, addressed a\r\nlarge assemblage of electors on behalf of her husband, the\r\nConservative candidate. She was enthusiastically greeted by the\r\npopulace.\r\n\r\nThe _Maine Age_ announces the election of a Miss Rose to the office of\r\nRegister of Deeds, and remarks: \"Before the morning of the twentieth\r\ncentury dawns, women will not simply fill your offices of Register of\r\nDeeds, but they will occupy seats in your Legislative Halls, on your\r\njudicial benches, and in the executive chair of State and Nation. We\r\ndeprecate it, yet we perceive its inevitability, and await the shock\r\nwith firmness and composure.\"\r\n\r\nThis same year, _The Una_ narrates the following amusing incident that\r\noccurred in the town of P----, New Hampshire: It is customary in the\r\ncountry towns for those who choose to do so, to pay their proportion\r\nof the highway tax, in actual labor on the roads, at the rate of eight\r\ncents an hour, instead of paying money. Two able-bodied and\r\nstrong-hearted women in P----, who found it very inconvenient to pay\r\nthe ready cash required of them, determined to avail themselves of\r\nthis custom. They accordingly presented themselves to the surveyor of\r\nthe highway with hoes in their hands, and demanded to be set to work.\r\nThe good surveyor was sorely puzzled; such a thing as women working\r\nout their taxes, had never been heard of, and yet the law made no\r\nprovision against it. He consulted his lawyer, who advised him that he\r\nhad no power to refuse. Accordingly the two brave women worked, and\r\nworked well, in spreading sand and gravel, saved their pennies, and no\r\ndoubt felt all the better for their labor.\r\n\r\nIn the April Number, 1853, we find the following appeal to the\r\ncitizens of Massachusetts, on the equal political rights of woman:\r\n\r\n     FELLOW-CITIZENS:--In May next a Convention will assemble to\r\n     revise the Constitution of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n     At such a time it is the right and duty of every one to point out\r\n     whatever he deems erroneous and imperfect in that instrument, and\r\n     press its amendment on public attention.\r\n\r\n     We deem the extension to woman of all civil rights, a measure of\r\n     vital importance to the welfare and progress of the State. On\r\n     every principle of natural justice, as well as by the nature of\r\n     our institutions, she is as fully entitled as man to vote, and to\r\n     be eligible to office. In governments based on force, it might be\r\n     pretended with some plausibility, that woman being supposed\r\n     physically weaker than man, should be excluded from the State.\r\n     But ours is a government professedly resting on the consent of\r\n     the governed. Woman is surely as competent to give that consent\r\n     as man. Our Revolution claimed that taxation and representation\r\n     should be co-extensive. While the property and labor of women are\r\n     subject to taxation, she is entitled to a voice in fixing the\r\n     amount of taxes, and the use of them when collected, and is\r\n     entitled to a voice in the laws that regulate punishments. It\r\n     would be a disgrace to our schools and civil institutions, for\r\n     any one to argue that a Massachusetts woman who has enjoyed the\r\n     full advantage of all their culture, is not as competent to form\r\n     an opinion on civil matters, as the illiterate foreigner landed\r\n     but a few years before upon our shores--unable to read or\r\n     write--by no means free from early prejudices, and little\r\n     acquainted with our institutions. Yet such men are allowed to\r\n     vote.\r\n\r\n     Woman as wife, mother, daughter, and owner of property, has\r\n     important rights to be protected. The whole history of\r\n     legislation so unequal between the sexes, shows that she can not\r\n     safely trust these to the other sex. Neither have her rights as\r\n     mother, wife, daughter, laborer, ever received full legislative\r\n     protection. Besides, our institutions are not based on the idea\r\n     of one class receiving protection from another; but on the\r\n     well-recognized rule that each class, or sex, is entitled to such\r\n     civil rights, as will enable it to protect itself. The exercise\r\n     of civil rights is one of the best means of education. Interest\r\n     in great questions, and the discussion of them under momentous\r\n     responsibility, call forth all the faculties and nerve them to\r\n     their fullest strength. The grant of these rights on the part of\r\n     society, would quickly lead to the enjoyment by woman, of a share\r\n     in the higher grades of professional employment. Indeed, without\r\n     these, mere book study is often but a waste of time. The learning\r\n     for which no use is found or anticipated, is too frequently\r\n     forgotten, almost as soon as acquired. The influence of such a\r\n     share, on the moral condition of society, is still more\r\n     important. Crowded now into few employments, women starve each\r\n     other by close competition; and too often vice borrows\r\n     overwhelming power of temptation from poverty. Open to women a\r\n     great variety of employments, and her wages in each will rise;\r\n     the energy and enterprise of the more highly endowed, will find\r\n     full scope in honest effort, and the frightful vice of our cities\r\n     will be stopped at its fountain-head. We hint very briefly at\r\n     these matters. A circular like this will not allow room for more.\r\n     Some may think it too soon to expect any action from the\r\n     Convention. Many facts lead us to think that public opinion is\r\n     more advanced on this question than is generally supposed.\r\n     Beside, there can be no time so proper to call public attention\r\n     to a radical change in our civil polity as now, when the whole\r\n     framework of our government is to be subjected to examination and\r\n     discussion. It is never too early to begin the discussion of any\r\n     desired change. To urge our claim on the Convention, is to bring\r\n     our question before the proper tribunal, and secure at the same\r\n     time the immediate attention of the general public.\r\n     Massachusetts, though she has led the way in most other reforms,\r\n     has in this fallen behind her rivals, consenting to learn, as to\r\n     the protection of the property of married women, of many younger\r\n     States. Let us redeem for her the old pre-eminence, and urge her\r\n     to set a noble example in this the most important of all civil\r\n     reforms. To this we ask you to join with us[49] in the\r\n     accompanying petition to the Constitutional Convention.\r\n\r\nIn favor of this Appeal Lucy Stone, Theodore Parker, Wendell Phillips,\r\nand Thomas Wentworth Higginson, were heard.\r\n\r\nWe find in _The Una_ the following report of Mr. Higginson's speech\r\nbefore the Committee of the Constitutional Convention on the\r\nqualification of voters, June 3, 1853, the question being on the\r\npetition of Abby May Alcott, and other women of Massachusetts, that\r\nthey be permitted to vote on the amendments that may be made to the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n                         MR. HIGGINSON'S SPEECH.\r\n\r\n     I need hardly suggest to the Committee the disadvantage under\r\n     which I appear before them, in coming to glean after three of the\r\n     most eloquent voices in this community, or any other [Lucy Stone,\r\n     Wendell Phillips, and Theodore Parker]; in doing this, moreover,\r\n     without having heard all their arguments, and in a fragment of\r\n     time at the end of a two hours' sitting. I have also the minor\r\n     disadvantage of gleaning after myself, having just ventured to\r\n     submit a more elaborate essay on this subject, in a different\r\n     form, to the notice of the Convention.\r\n\r\n     I shall therefore abstain from all debate upon the general\r\n     question, and confine myself to the specific point now before\r\n     this Committee. I shall waive all inquiry as to the right of\r\n     women to equality in education, in occupations, or in the\r\n     ordinary use of the elective franchise. The question before this\r\n     Committee is not whether women shall become legal voters--but\r\n     whether they shall have power to say, once for all, whether they\r\n     wish to become legal voters. Whether, in one word, they desire to\r\n     accept this Constitution which the Convention is framing.\r\n\r\n     It is well that the question should come up in this form, since\r\n     the one efficient argument against the right of women to vote, in\r\n     ordinary cases, is the plea that they do not wish to do it.\r\n     \"Their whole nature revolts at it.\" Very well; these petitioners\r\n     simply desire an opportunity for Massachusetts women to say\r\n     whether their nature does revolt at it or no.\r\n\r\n     The whole object of this Convention, as I heard stated by one of\r\n     its firmest advocates, is simply this: to \"make the Constitution\r\n     of Massachusetts consistent with its own first principles.\" This\r\n     is all these petitioners demand. Give them the premises which are\r\n     conceded in our existing Bill of Rights, or even its Preamble,\r\n     and they ask no more. I shall draw my few weapons from this\r\n     source. I know that this document is not binding upon your\r\n     Convention; nothing is binding upon you but eternal and absolute\r\n     justice, and my predecessor has taken care of the claims of that.\r\n     But the Bill of Rights is still the organic law of this State,\r\n     and I can quote no better authority for those principles which\r\n     lie at the foundation of all that we call republicanism.\r\n\r\n     I. My first citation will be from the Preamble, and will\r\n     establish as Massachusetts doctrine the principle of the\r\n     Declaration of Independence, that all government owes its just\r\n     powers to the consent of the governed.\r\n\r\n     \"The end of the institution, maintenance, and administration of\r\n     government, is to secure the existence of the body politic....\r\n     The body politic is formed by a voluntary association of\r\n     individuals; it is a social compact, by which the whole people\r\n     covenants with each citizen and each citizen with the whole\r\n     people, that all shall be governed by certain laws for the common\r\n     good.... It is the duty of the people, therefore, in framing a\r\n     constitution of government, to provide for an equitable mode of\r\n     making laws, as well as for an impartial interpretation and a\r\n     faithful execution of them,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\n     Now, women are \"individuals\"; women are a part of \"the people\";\r\n     women are \"citizens,\" for the Constitution elsewhere\r\n     distinguishes male citizens. This clause, then, concedes\r\n     precisely that which your petitioners claim. Observe how explicit\r\n     it is. The people are not merely to have good laws, well\r\n     administered; but they must have an equitable mode of making\r\n     those laws. The reason of this is, that good laws are no\r\n     permanent security, unless enacted by equitable methods. Your\r\n     laws may be the best ever devised; yet still they are only given\r\n     as a temporary favor, not held as a right, unless the whole\r\n     people are concerned in their enactment. It is the old claim of\r\n     despots--that their laws are good. When they told Alexander of\r\n     Russia that his personal character was as good as a constitution\r\n     for his people, \"then,\" said he, \"I am but a lucky accident.\"\r\n     Your constitution may be never so benignant to woman, but that is\r\n     only a lucky accident, unless you concede the claim of these\r\n     women to have a share in creating it. Nothing else \"is an\r\n     equitable mode of making laws.\" But it is too late to choose\r\n     female delegates to your Convention, and the only thing you can\r\n     do is to allow women to vote on the acceptance of its results.\r\n     The claim of these petitioners may be unexpected, but is\r\n     logically irresistible. If you do not wish it to be renewed, you\r\n     must remember either to alter or abrogate your Bill of Rights;\r\n     for the petition is based on that.\r\n\r\n     The last speaker called this movement a novelty. Not entirely so.\r\n     The novelty is partly the other way. In Europe, women have direct\r\n     political power; witness Victoria. It is a false democracy which\r\n     has taken it away. In my more detailed argument, I have cited\r\n     many instances of these foreign privileges. In monarchical\r\n     countries the dividing lines are not of sex, but of rank. A\r\n     plebeian woman has no political power--nor has her husband. Rank\r\n     gives it to man, and, also, in a degree, to woman. But among us\r\n     the only rank is of sex. Politically speaking, in Massachusetts\r\n     all men are patrician, all women plebeian. All men are equal, in\r\n     having direct political power; and all women are equal, in having\r\n     none. And women lose by democracy precisely that which men gain.\r\n     Therefore I say this disfranchisement of woman, as woman, is a\r\n     novelty. It is a now aristocracy; for, as De Tocqueville says,\r\n     wherever one class has peculiar powers, as such, there is\r\n     aristocracy and oligarchy.\r\n\r\n     We see the result of this in our general mode of speaking of\r\n     woman. We forget to speak of her as an individual being, only as\r\n     a thing. A political writer coolly says, that in Massachusetts,\r\n     \"except criminals and paupers, there is no class of persons who\r\n     do not exercise the elective franchise.\" Women are not even a\r\n     \"class of persons.\" And yet, most readers would not notice this\r\n     extraordinary omission. I talked the other day with a young\r\n     radical preacher about his new religious organization. \"Who votes\r\n     under it?\" said I. \"Oh,\" (he said, triumphantly,) \"we go for\r\n     progress and liberty; anybody and everybody votes.\" \"What!\" said\r\n     I, \"women?\" \"No,\" said he, rather startled; \"I did not think of\r\n     them when I spoke.\" Thus quietly do we all talk of \"anybody and\r\n     everybody,\" and omit half the human race. Indeed, I read in the\r\n     newspaper, this morning, of some great festivity, that \"all the\r\n     world and his wife\" would be there! Women are not a part of the\r\n     world, but only its \"wife.\" They are not even \"the rest of\r\n     mankind\"; they are womankind! All these things show the results\r\n     of that inconsistency with the first principles of our\r\n     Constitution of which the friends of this Convention justly\r\n     complain.\r\n\r\n     II. So much for the general statement of the Massachusetts Bill\r\n     of Rights in its Preamble. But one clause is even more explicit.\r\n     In Section 9, I find the following:\r\n\r\n     \"All the inhabitants of this Commonwealth, having such\r\n     qualifications as they shall establish by their form of\r\n     government, have an equal right to elect officers,\" etc.\r\n\r\n     As \"they\" shall establish. Who are _they_? Manifestly, the\r\n     inhabitants as a whole. No part can have power, except by the\r\n     consent of the whole, so far as that consent is practicable.\r\n     Accordingly, you submit your Constitution for ratification--to\r\n     whom? Not to the inhabitants of the State, not even to a majority\r\n     of the native adult inhabitants; for it is estimated that at any\r\n     given moment--in view of the great number of men emigrating to\r\n     the West, to California, or absent on long voyages--the majority\r\n     of the population of Massachusetts is female. You disfranchise\r\n     the majority, then; the greater part of \"the inhabitants\" have no\r\n     share in establishing the form of government, or assigning the\r\n     qualifications of voters. What worse can you say of any\r\n     oligarchy? True, your aristocracy is a large one--almost a\r\n     majority, you may say. But so, in several European nations, is\r\n     nobility almost in a majority, and you almost hire a nobleman to\r\n     black your shoes; they are as cheap as generals and colonels in\r\n     New England. But the principle is the same, whether the\r\n     privileged minority consists of one or one million.\r\n\r\n     It is said that a tacit consent has been hitherto given by the\r\n     absence of open protest? The same argument maybe used concerning\r\n     the black majority in South Carolina. Besides, your new\r\n     Constitution is not yet made, and there has been no opportunity\r\n     to assent to it. It will not be identical with the old one; but,\r\n     even if it were, you propose to ask a renewed consent from men,\r\n     and why not from women? Is it because a lady's \"Yes\" is always so\r\n     fixed a certainty, that it never can be transformed to a \"No,\" at\r\n     a later period?\r\n\r\n     But I am compelled, by the fixed period of adjournment (10 A.M.),\r\n     to cut short my argument, as I have been already compelled to\r\n     condense it. I pray your consideration for the points I have\r\n     urged. Believe me, it is easier to ridicule the petition of these\r\n     women than to answer the arguments which sustain it. And, as the\r\n     great republic of ancient times did not blush to claim that laws\r\n     and governments were first introduced by Ceres, a woman, so I\r\n     trust that the representatives of this noblest of modern\r\n     commonwealths may not be ashamed to receive legislative\r\n     suggestions from even female petitioners.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, August 12, 1853, in Committee of the Whole, the report\r\nthat \"it is inexpedient to act on the petition\" of several parties\r\nthat women may vote, was taken up.\r\n\r\n     Mr. GREEN, of Brookfield, opposed the report, contending that\r\n     women being capable of giving or withholding their assent to the\r\n     acts of government, should upon every principle of justice and\r\n     equality, be permitted to participate in its administration. He\r\n     denied that men were of right the guardians or trustees of women,\r\n     since they had not been appointed, but had usurped that position.\r\n     Women had inherent natural rights as a portion of the people, and\r\n     they should be permitted to vote in order to protect those\r\n     inherent rights.\r\n\r\n     Mr. KEYES, of Abington, paid a warm tribute to the virtues and\r\n     abilities of the fairer sex, and was willing to concede that they\r\n     were to some extent oppressed and denied their rights; but he did\r\n     not believe the granting of the privileges these petitioners\r\n     claimed would tend to elevate or ameliorate their condition.\r\n     Woman exerted great power by the exercise of her feminine graces\r\n     and virtues, which she would lose the moment she should step\r\n     beyond her proper sphere and mingle in the affairs of State!\r\n\r\n     Mr. WHITNEY, of Boylston, believed that the same reasoning that\r\n     would deny the divine right of kings to govern men without their\r\n     consent, would also deny a similar right of men over women. The\r\n     Committee had given the best of reasons for granting the prayer\r\n     of the petitioners, and then reported that they have leave to\r\n     withdraw. He expatiated on the grievances to which women are\r\n     subjected, and concluded by moving as an amendment to the report,\r\n     that the prayer of the petitioners ought to be granted.\r\n\r\n     The Committee then rose, and had leave to sit again. Wednesday\r\n     the first business of importance was the taking up in Committee\r\n     of the report \"leave to withdraw,\" relative to giving certain\r\n     privileges to women. Question on the amendment of Mr. Whitney to\r\n     amend the conclusion of the report, by inserting \"that the prayer\r\n     of the petitioners be granted.\" Debate ensued on the subject\r\n     between Messrs. Marvin, of Winchendon; Kingman, of West\r\n     Bridgewater; when the question was taken, and Mr. Whitney's\r\n     amendment rejected. Mr. Marvin then moved to substitute\r\n     \"inexpedient to act\" for \"leave to withdraw\"; which was adopted.\r\n     The Committee then rose, and recommended the adoption of the\r\n     report as amended, by a vote of 108 to 44.\r\n\r\nThe prejudices of the 108 outweighed all the able arguments made by\r\nthose who represented the petitioners, and all the great principles of\r\njustice on which a true republic is based.\r\n\r\nWe find the following comments on the character and duties of the\r\ngentlemen who composed the Convention, from the pen of Mr. Higginson,\r\nin _The Una_ of June, 1853:\r\n\r\n     _To the members of the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention:_\r\n\r\n     The publication in our newspapers of the list of members of your\r\n     honorable body, has won the just tribute of men of all parties to\r\n     the happy result of the selection. Never, it is thought, has\r\n     Massachusetts witnessed a political assembly of more eminent or\r\n     accomplished men. And yet there are those to whom the daring\r\n     thought has occurred, that to convoke such ability and learning,\r\n     only to decide whether our Legislature shall be hereafter elected\r\n     by towns or districts, is somewhat like the course of Columbus in\r\n     assembling the dignitaries of his nation to decide whether an egg\r\n     could be best poised upon the larger or the smaller end. A\r\n     question which was necessarily settled, after all, by a\r\n     compromise, as this will be.\r\n\r\n     But at that moment, there lay within the brain of the young\r\n     Genoese a dream, which although denounced by prelates and derided\r\n     by statesmen was yet destined to add another half to the visible\r\n     earth; so there is brooding in the soul of this generation, a\r\n     vision of the greatest of all political discoveries, which, when\r\n     accepted, will double the intellectual resources of society, and\r\n     give a new world, not to Castile and Leon only, but to\r\n     Massachusetts and the human race.\r\n\r\n     And lastly, as we owe the labor and the laurels of Columbus only\r\n     to the liberal statesmanship of a woman, it is surely a noble\r\n     hope, that the future Isabellas of this Nation may point the way\r\n     for their oppressed sisters of Europe to a suffrage truly\r\n     universal, and a political freedom bounded neither by station nor\r\n     by sex.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Oakes Smith, writing in _The Una_, says of this historical\r\noccasion:\r\n\r\n     The Massachusetts Convention did not deign to notice the prayer\r\n     of these two thousand women who claimed the privilege of being\r\n     heard by men who assert that we are represented through them.\r\n     They decided that \"it is inexpedient to act upon said petition.\"\r\n     This is no cause for discouragement to those who have the subject\r\n     at heart. Two thousand signers are quite as many, if not more,\r\n     than we supposed would be procured. The believers in the rights\r\n     of woman to entire equality with man in every department\r\n     involving the question of human justice are entirely in the\r\n     minority. The majority believe that their wives and mothers are\r\n     household chattels; believe that they were expressly created for\r\n     no other purposes than those of maternity in their highest\r\n     aspect; in their next for purposes of passion, with the long\r\n     retinue of unhallowed sensualities, debasements, and pollutions\r\n     which follow in the train of evil indulgence. With others, women\r\n     are sewers on of buttons; darners of stockings; makers of\r\n     puddings; appendages to wash days, bakings, and brewings; echoes\r\n     and adjectives to men for ever and ever. They are compounds of\r\n     tears, hysterics, frettings, scoldings, complainings; made up of\r\n     craftiness and imbecilities, to be wheedled, and coaxed, and\r\n     coerced like unmanageable children. _The idea of a true, noble\r\n     womanhood is yet to be created._ It does not live in the public\r\n     mind. Now, in answer to the petition of these two thousand women,\r\n     the Committee reply that all just governments exist by the\r\n     consent of the governed. An old truism. We reply, women have\r\n     given no such consent, and therefore are not bound to allegiance.\r\n     But our sapient Legislators say, since there are two hundred\r\n     thousand women in Massachusetts twenty-one years of age, and only\r\n     two thousand who sign this petition, therefore it is fair to\r\n     suppose that the larger part of the women of the State have\r\n     consented to the present form of government. Now, this is\r\n     assuredly a willful and unworthy perversion of the truth. These\r\n     women are simply ignorant, simply supine. They have neither\r\n     affirmed nor denied. They have not thought at all upon the\r\n     subject. But there are two thousand women in Massachusetts who\r\n     think and act, to say nothing of the thousands of intelligent men\r\n     there who believe in the same doctrine. Now here is a little army\r\n     in one State alone, and that a conservative one, while through\r\n     the Middle and Western States are thousands thinking in the same\r\n     direction. Here is the leaven that must leaven the whole lump.\r\n     Here is the wise minority which will hereafter become the\r\n     overwhelming majority of the country. The Committee remark on the\r\n     fact that while 50,000 women have petitioned for a law to repress\r\n     the sale of intoxicating liquor, only two thousand petition for\r\n     the right to vote! While the multitude could readily trace the\r\n     downfall of father, husband, brother, and son, to the dram-shop,\r\n     only the thinking few could see the power beyond the law and the\r\n     lawmaker that protects the traffic, the right to the ballot, with\r\n     which to strike the most effective blow in the right place.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW ENGLAND WOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n                                   BOSTON, Friday, _June 2, 1854_.\r\n\r\nThis Convention assembled the day on which poor Anthony Burns was\r\nconsigned to hopeless bondage;[50] and though many friends of the\r\nwoman movement remained in the streets to see his surrender, still at\r\nan early hour the hall was literally crowded with earnest men and\r\nwomen, whom a deep interest in the cause had drawn together. Sarah H.\r\nEarle, of Worcester, was chosen President; Lucy Stone, Chairman of the\r\nBusiness Committee, reported the resolutions, among which we find the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the Common Law, which governs the marriage\r\n     relation, and blots out the legal existence of a wife, denies her\r\n     right to the product of her own industry, denies her equal\r\n     property rights, even denies her right to her children, and the\r\n     custody of her own person, is grossly unjust to woman,\r\n     dishonorable to man, and destructive to the harmony of life's\r\n     holiest relation.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the laws which destroy the legal individuality\r\n     of woman after her marriage are equally pernicious to man as to\r\n     woman, and may give to him in marriage a slave, or a tyrant, but\r\n     never a wife.\r\n\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, Emma E. Coe, Josephine S. Griffing, Wendell\r\nPhillips, Dr. Harriot K. Hunt, Rev. S. S. Griswold, Sarah Pellet, Abby\r\nKelly Foster, Mrs. Morton, and Lucy Stone took part in the debates.\r\nLetters were received from Thomas W. Higginson, Rev. A. D. Mayo,\r\nPaulina Wright Davis, Mrs. Nichols, and Sarah Crosby. Francis\r\nJackson,[51] of Boston, made a contribution of $50. Committees were\r\nappointed from each of the New England States to circulate petitions\r\nfor securing a change in the laws regulating the property of married\r\nwomen, and limiting the right of suffrage to men. All the sessions\r\ndrew crowded audiences, and the enthusiasm was sustained to the end.\r\nThe sympathy for Burns intensified the feelings of those present\r\nagainst all forms of oppression. Those who had witnessed the military\r\nparade through the streets of Boston to drive the slave--a minister of\r\nthe Baptist denomination in his southern home--from the land of the\r\nPilgrims where he had sought refuge, were roused to plead with new\r\nearnestness and power for equal rights to all without distinction of\r\nsex or color.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION IN BOSTON.\r\n\r\n                                          _Sept. 19 and 20, 1855._\r\n\r\nThis Convention was fully attended through six sessions, and gave\r\ngreat satisfaction to all engaged in it. After its close, its officers\r\nreceived such expressions of interest from persons not previously\r\nenlisted in the cause, as to convince them that a lasting impression\r\nwas made. The attendance was the best that Boston could furnish in\r\nintelligence and respectability, and to a greater degree than usual\r\nclerical. Mrs. Paulina Wright Davis was again chosen President.\r\nBusiness Committee--Dr. William F. Channing, Caroline H. Dall, Wendell\r\nPhillips, and Caroline M. Severance. Among the Vice-Presidents we find\r\nthe names of Harriot K. Hunt and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. Caroline\r\nH. Dall, Ellen M. Tarr, and Paulina Wright Davis presented carefully\r\nprepared digests of the laws of several of the New England States.\r\nMrs. Davis said:\r\n\r\n     In 1844 a bill was introduced into the Legislature of this State\r\n     (Rhode Island) by Hon. Wilkins Updike, securing to married women\r\n     their property \"under certain regulations.\" The step was a\r\n     progressive one, and hailed at that time as a bright omen for the\r\n     future. Other States have followed the example, and the right of\r\n     woman to some control of her property has been recognized. In\r\n     1847 Vermont passed similar enactments; in 1848-'49, Connecticut,\r\n     New York, and Texas; in 1850-'52, Alabama and Maine; in 1853, New\r\n     Hampshire, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Iowa followed. But the\r\n     provisions \"under certain regulations\" left married women almost\r\n     as helpless as before.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. DAVIS further says: If in 1855, from the practical workings\r\n     of these statutes, we find ourselves compelled to pronounce them\r\n     despotic in spirit, degrading and tyrannical in effect, we do not\r\n     the less give honor to the man who was so far in advance of his\r\n     age as to conceive the idea of raising woman a little in the\r\n     scale of being.\r\n\r\nWe have always claimed the honor for New York as being first in this\r\nmatter, because the Property Bill was presented there in 1836, and\r\nwhen finally passed in 1848, was far more liberal than in any other\r\nState; and step by step her legislation was broadened, until 1860 the\r\nrevolution was complete, securing to married women their own\r\ninheritance absolutely, to use, will, and dispose of as they see fit;\r\nto do business in their name, make contracts, sue, and be sued.\r\n\r\nThe speakers on the first day of this Convention were Wendell\r\nPhillips, Thomas W. Higginson, and Lucy Stone; on the second morning,\r\nCaroline H. Dall, Antoinette L. Brown, and Susan B. Anthony. The\r\nevening closed with a lecture from Ralph Waldo Emerson, and a poem by\r\nElizabeth Oakes Smith. No report of the debates was preserved.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to her family Susan B. Anthony, under date of Sept. 27th,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     I went into Boston on Tuesday, with Lucy Stone, to attend the\r\n     Convention. We stopped at Francis Jackson's, where we found\r\n     Antoinette Brown and Ellen Blackwell. A pleasant company in that\r\n     most hospitable home. The Convention passed off pleasantly, but\r\n     with none of the enthusiasm we have in our New York meetings. As\r\n     this was my first visit to Boston, Mr. Jackson took Antoinette\r\n     and myself round to see the lions; to the House of Correction,\r\n     the House of Reformation, the Merchant's Exchange, the\r\n     Custom-House, State House, and Faneuil Hall, and then dined with\r\n     his daughter, Eliza J. Eddy, in South Boston, returning in the\r\n     afternoon. Lucy and Antoinette left, one for New York and the\r\n     other for Brookfield. In the evening, Ellen Blackwell and I\r\n     attended a reception at Mr. Garrison's, where we met several of\r\n     the _literati_, and were most heartily welcomed by Mrs. Garrison,\r\n     a noble, self-sacrificing woman, the loving and the loved,\r\n     surrounded with healthy, happy children in that model home. Mr.\r\n     Garrison was omnipresent now talking and introducing guests, now\r\n     soothing some child to sleep, and now, with his charming wife,\r\n     looking after the refreshments. There we met Mrs. Dall, Elizabeth\r\n     Peabody, Mrs. McCready, the Shakespearian reader, Mrs. Severance,\r\n     Dr. Hunt, Charles F. Hovey, Francis Jackson, Wendell Phillips,\r\n     Sarah Pugh, of Philadelphia, and others. Having worshiped these\r\n     distinguished people afar off, it was a great satisfaction to see\r\n     so many face to face.\r\n\r\n     On Saturday morning, in company with Mr. and Mrs. Garrison and\r\n     Sarah Pugh, I visited Mount Auburn. What a magnificent\r\n     resting-place this is! We could not find Margaret Fuller's\r\n     monument, which I regretted. I spent Sunday with Charles Lenox\r\n     Remond; we drove to Lynn with matchless steeds to hear Theodore\r\n     Parker preach. What a sermon! our souls were filled. We discussed\r\n     its excellence at James Buffum's, where, with other friends, we\r\n     dined. Visited the steamer _Africa_ next day, in which Ellen\r\n     Blackwell was soon to sail for Liverpool.\r\n\r\n     Monday Mr. Garrison escorted me to Charlestown; we stood on the\r\n     very spot where Warren fell, and mounted the interminable\r\n     staircase to the top of Bunker Hill Monument, where we had an\r\n     extensive view of the harbor and surrounding country. Then we\r\n     called on Theodore Parker; found him up three flights of stairs\r\n     in his library, covering that whole floor of his house; the room\r\n     is lined all round with books to the very top--16,000\r\n     volumes--and there, at a large table in the center of the\r\n     apartment, sat the great man himself. It really seemed audacious\r\n     in me to be ushered into such a presence, and on such a\r\n     commonplace errand, to ask him to come to Rochester to speak in a\r\n     course of lectures I am planning. But he received me with such\r\n     kindness and simplicity, that the awe I felt on entering was soon\r\n     dissipated. I then called on Wendell Phillips, in his sanctum,\r\n     for the same purpose. I have invited Ralph Waldo Emerson by\r\n     letter, and all three have promised to come. In the evening, with\r\n     Mr. Jackson's son James, the most diffident and sensitive man I\r\n     ever saw, Miss B---- and I went to the theater to see Dussendoff,\r\n     the great tragedian, play Hamlet. The theater is new, the scenery\r\n     beautiful, and, in spite of my Quaker training, I find I enjoy\r\n     all these worldly amusements intensely.\r\n\r\n     Returning to Worcester, I attended the Anti-Slavery Bazaar. I\r\n     suppose there were many beautiful things exhibited, but I was so\r\n     absorbed in the conversation of Mr. Higginson, Samuel May, Jr.,\r\n     Sarah Earle, Cousin Dr. Seth Rogers, Stephen and Abby Foster,\r\n     that I really forgot to take a survey of the tables. The next day\r\n     Charles F. Hovey drove me out to the home of the Fosters, where\r\n     we had a pleasant call.\r\n\r\nFrancis Jackson and Charles F. Hovey, though neither speakers nor\r\nwriters, yet they furnished the \"sinews of war.\" None contributed more\r\ngenerously than they to all the reforms of their times. They were the\r\nfirst men to make a bequest to our movement. To them we are indebted\r\nfor the money that enabled us to carry on the agitation for years.\r\nBeside giving liberally from time to time, Francis Jackson left $5,000\r\nin the hands of Wendell Phillips, which he managed and invested so\r\nwisely, that the fund was nearly doubled. Charles F. Hovey left\r\n$50,000 to be used in anti-slavery, woman suffrage, and free religion.\r\nWith the exception of $1,000 from Lydia Maria Child, we have yet to\r\nhear of a woman of wealth who has left anything for the\r\nenfranchisement of her sex. Almost every daily paper heralds the fact\r\nof some large bequest to colleges, churches, and charities by rich\r\nwomen, but it is proverbial that they never remember the Woman\r\nSuffrage movement that underlies in importance all others.\r\n\r\n\r\n               HEARING BEFORE THE MASSACHUSETTS LEGISLATURE,\r\n                                MARCH, 1857.\r\n\r\n     _The Boston Traveller_ says: The Representatives Hall yesterday\r\n     afternoon was completely filled, galleries and all, to hear the\r\n     arguments before the Judiciary Committee, to whom was referred\r\n     the petition of Lucy Stone and others for equal rights for\r\n     \"females\" in the administration of government, for the right of\r\n     suffrage, etc.\r\n\r\n     Rev. JAMES FREEMAN CLARKE was the first speaker. He said:\r\n     Gentlemen, the question before you is, Shall the women of\r\n     Massachusetts have equal rights with the men? The fundamental\r\n     principles of the Constitution set forth equal rights to all. A\r\n     large portion of the property of Massachusetts is owned by women,\r\n     probably one-third of the whole amount, and yet they are not\r\n     represented, though compelled to pay taxes. It has been said they\r\n     are represented by their husbands. So it was said that the\r\n     American colonies were represented in the British Parliament, but\r\n     the colonies were not contented with such representation; neither\r\n     are women contented to be represented by men. As long as we put\r\n     woman's name on the tax-list we should put it in the ballot-box.\r\n\r\n     WENDELL PHILLIPS said: Self-government was the foundation of our\r\n     institutions. July 4, 1776, sent the message round the world that\r\n     every man can take care of himself better than any one else can\r\n     do it for him. If you tax me, consult me. If you hang me, first\r\n     try me by a jury of my own peers. What I ask for myself, I ask\r\n     for woman. In the banks, a woman, as a stockholder, is allowed to\r\n     vote. In the Bank of England, in the East India Company, in State\r\n     Street, her power is felt, her voice controls millions.\r\n\r\n     Three hundred years ago it was said woman had no right to profess\r\n     any religion, as it would make discord in the family if she\r\n     differed from her husband. The same conservatism warns us of the\r\n     danger of allowing her any political opinions.\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE said: The argument that the wife, having the right of\r\n     suffrage, would cause discord in the family, is entirely\r\n     incorrect. When men wish to procure the vote of a neighbor, do\r\n     they not approach them with the utmost suavity, and would not the\r\n     husband who wished to influence the wife's vote be far more\r\n     gracious than usual? She instanced the heroic conduct of Mrs.\r\n     Patton, who navigated her husband's ship into the harbor of San\r\n     Francisco, as an argument in favor of woman's power of command\r\n     and of government. The captain and mate lying ill with a fever,\r\n     she had the absolute control of both vessel and crew. Mrs.\r\n     Stone's speech was comprehensive and pointed, and called forth\r\n     frequent applause.\r\n\r\nDr. Harriot K. Hunt, a woman of wealth and position, protested every\r\nyear against being compelled to pay taxes while not recognized in the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      DR. HUNT'S PROTEST OF 1852.\r\n\r\n     _To Frederick W. Tracy, Treasurer, and the Assessors, and other\r\n     Authorities of the city of Boston, and the Citizens generally:_\r\n\r\n     Harriot K. Hunt, physician, a native and permanent resident of\r\n     the city of Boston, and for many years a taxpayer therein, in\r\n     making payment of her city taxes for the coming year, begs leave\r\n     to protest against the injustice and inequality of levying taxes\r\n     upon women, and at the same time refusing them any voice or vote\r\n     in the imposition and expenditure of the same. The only classes\r\n     of male persons required to pay taxes, and not at the same time\r\n     allowed the privilege of voting, are aliens and minors. The\r\n     objection in the case of aliens is their supposed want of\r\n     interest in our institutions and knowledge of them. The objection\r\n     in the case of minors, is the want of sufficient understanding.\r\n     These objections can not apply to women, natives of the city, all\r\n     of whose property interests are here, and who have accumulated,\r\n     by their own sagacity and industry, the very property on which\r\n     they are taxed. But this is not all; the alien, by going through\r\n     the forms of naturalization, the minor on coming of age, obtain\r\n     the right of voting; and so long as they continue to pay a mere\r\n     poll-tax of a dollar and a half, they may continue to exercise\r\n     it, though so ignorant as not to be able to sign their names, or\r\n     read the very votes they put into the ballot-boxes. Even\r\n     drunkards, felons, idiots, and lunatics, if men, may still enjoy\r\n     that right of voting to which no woman, however large the amount\r\n     of taxes she pays, however respectable her character, or useful\r\n     her life, can ever attain. Wherein, your remonstrant would\r\n     inquire, is the justice, equality, or wisdom of this?\r\n\r\n     That the rights and interests of the female part of the community\r\n     are sometimes forgotten or disregarded in consequence of their\r\n     deprivation of political rights, is strikingly evinced, as\r\n     appears to your remonstrant, in the organization and\r\n     administration of the city public schools. Though there are open\r\n     in this State and neighborhood, a great multitude of colleges and\r\n     professional schools for the education of boys and young men, yet\r\n     the city has very properly provided two High-Schools of its own,\r\n     one Latin, the other English, in which the \"male graduates\" of\r\n     the Grammar Schools may pursue their education still farther at\r\n     the public expense. And why is not a like provision made for the\r\n     girls? Why is their education stopped short, just as they have\r\n     attained the age best fitted for progress, and the preliminary\r\n     knowledge necessary to facilitate it, thus giving the advantage\r\n     of superior culture to sex, not to mind?\r\n\r\n     The fact that our colleges and professional schools are closed\r\n     against females, of which your remonstrant has had personal and\r\n     painful experience; having been in the year 1847, after twelve\r\n     years of medical practice in Boston, refused permission to attend\r\n     the lectures of Harvard Medical College. That fact would seem to\r\n     furnish an additional reason why the city should provide, at its\r\n     own expense, those means of superior education which, by\r\n     supplying our girls with occupation and objects of interest,\r\n     would not only save them from lives of frivolity and emptiness,\r\n     but which might open the way to many useful and lucrative\r\n     pursuits, and so raise them above that degrading dependence, so\r\n     fruitful a source of female misery.\r\n\r\n     Reserving a more full exposition of the subject to future\r\n     occasions, your remonstrant, in paying her tax for the current\r\n     year, begs leave to protest against the injustice and\r\n     inequalities above pointed out.\r\n\r\n     This is respectfully submitted,              HARRIOT K. HUNT,\r\n                                        32 Green Street, Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\nHarriot K. Hunt commenced the practice of medicine at the age of\r\nthirty, in 1835; twelve years after, was refused admission to Harvard\r\nMedical Lectures. She often said that as her love element had all\r\ncentered in her profession, she intended to celebrate her silver\r\nwedding, which she did, in the summer of 1860. Her house was crowded\r\nwith a large circle of loving friends, who decorated it with flowers\r\nand many bridal offerings, thus expressing their esteem and affection\r\nfor the first woman physician, who had done so much to relieve the\r\nsufferings of women and children. The degree of M.D. was conferred on\r\nher by \"The Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania,\" in 1853. Her\r\nbiographer says she honored the title more than the title could her.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   MARRIAGE OF LUCY STONE UNDER PROTEST.\r\n\r\n     It was my privilege to celebrate May day by officiating at a\r\n     wedding in a farm-house among the hills of West Brookfield. The\r\n     bridegroom was a man of tried worth, a leader in the Western\r\n     Anti-Slavery Movement; and the bride was one whose fair name is\r\n     known throughout the nation; one whose rare intellectual\r\n     qualities are excelled by the private beauty of her heart and\r\n     life.\r\n\r\n     I never perform the marriage ceremony without a renewed sense of\r\n     the iniquity of our present system of laws in respect to\r\n     marriage; a system by which \"man and wife are one, and that one\r\n     is the husband.\" It was with my hearty concurrence, therefore,\r\n     that the following protest was read and signed, as a part of the\r\n     nuptial ceremony; and I send it to you, that others may be\r\n     induced to do likewise.\r\n\r\n                                   Rev. THOMAS WENTWORTH HIGGINSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  PROTEST.\r\n\r\n     While acknowledging our mutual affection by publicly assuming the\r\n     relationship of husband and wife, yet in justice to ourselves and\r\n     a great principle, we deem it a duty to declare that this act on\r\n     our part implies no sanction of, nor promise of voluntary\r\n     obedience to such of the present laws of marriage, as refuse to\r\n     recognize the wife as an independent, rational being, while they\r\n     confer upon the husband an injurious and unnatural superiority,\r\n     investing him with legal powers which no honorable man would\r\n     exercise, and which no man should possess. We protest especially\r\n     against the laws which give to the husband:\r\n\r\n     1. The custody of the wife's person.\r\n\r\n     2. The exclusive control and guardianship of their children.\r\n\r\n     3. The sole ownership of her personal, and use of her real\r\n     estate, unless previously settled upon her, or placed in the\r\n     hands of trustees, as in the case of minors, lunatics, and\r\n     idiots.\r\n\r\n     4. The absolute right to the product of her industry.\r\n\r\n     5. Also against laws which give to the widower so much larger and\r\n     more permanent an interest in the property of his deceased wife,\r\n     than they give to the widow in that of the deceased husband.\r\n\r\n     6. Finally, against the whole system by which \"the legal\r\n     existence of the wife is suspended during marriage,\" so that in\r\n     most States, she neither has a legal part in the choice of her\r\n     residence, nor can she make a will, nor sue or be sued in her own\r\n     name, nor inherit property.\r\n\r\n     We believe that personal independence and equal human rights can\r\n     never be forfeited, except for crime; that marriage should be an\r\n     equal and permanent partnership, and so recognized by law; that\r\n     until it is so recognized, married partners should provide\r\n     against the radical injustice of present laws, by every means in\r\n     their power.\r\n\r\n     We believe that where domestic difficulties arise, no appeal\r\n     should be made to legal tribunals under existing laws, but that\r\n     all difficulties should be submitted to the equitable adjustment\r\n     of arbitrators mutually chosen.\r\n\r\n     Thus reverencing law, we enter our protest against rules and\r\n     customs which are unworthy of the name, since they violate\r\n     justice, the essence of law.\r\n\r\n                          (Signed),               HENRY. B. BLACKWELL,\r\n     _Worcester Spy_, 1855.                       LUCY STONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the above _The Liberator_ appended the following:\r\n\r\n     We are very sorry (as will be a host of others) to lose Lucy\r\n     Stone, and certainly no less glad to gain Lucy Blackwell. Our\r\n     most fervent benediction upon the heads of the parties thus\r\n     united.\r\n\r\nThis was a timely protest against the whole idea of the old Blackstone\r\ncode, which made woman a nonentity in marriage. Lucy Stone took an\r\nequally brave step in refusing to take her husband's name, respecting\r\nher own individuality and the name that represented it. These protests\r\nhave called down on Mrs. Stone much ridicule and persecution, but she\r\nhas firmly maintained her position, although at great inconvenience in\r\nthe execution of legal documents, and suffering the injustice of\r\nhaving her vote refused as Lucy Stone, soon after the bill passed in\r\nMassachusetts giving all women the right to vote on the school\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, Caroline H. Dall, of Boston, gave a series of literary\r\nlectures in different parts of the country, on \"Woman's Claims to\r\nEducation,\" beginning in her native city. Her subjects were:\r\n\r\n     _Nov. 1st._--The ideal standard of education, depressed by public\r\n     opinion, but developed by the spirit of the age; Egypt and\r\n     Algiers.\r\n\r\n     _Nov. 8th._--Public opinion, as it is influenced by the study of\r\n     the Classics and History, by general literature, newspapers, and\r\n     customs.\r\n\r\n     _Nov. 15th._--Public opinion as modified by individual lives:\r\n     Mary Wollstonecroft, Anna Jamieson, Charlotte Bronté, and\r\n     Margaret Fuller.\r\n\r\nIn June 11th, of this year, Mrs. Dall writes to the _Liberator_ of her\r\nefforts to circulate the following petition:\r\n\r\n     _To the Honorable, the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\n     Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in General Court assembled:_\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The women of Massachusetts are disfranchised by its\r\n     State Constitution solely on account of sex.\r\n\r\n     We do respectfully demand the right of suffrage, which involves\r\n     all other rights of citizenship, and one that can not justly be\r\n     withheld, as the following admitted principles of government\r\n     show:\r\n\r\n     1st. \"All men are born free and equal.\"\r\n\r\n     2d. \"Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the\r\n     governed.\"\r\n\r\n     3d. \"Taxation and representation are inseparable.\" We, the\r\n     undersigned, therefore petition your Honorable Body to take the\r\n     necessary steps to revise the Constitution so that all citizens\r\n     may enjoy equal political rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW ENGLAND CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nMay 27th, 1859, an enthusiastic Convention was held in Mercantile\r\nHall. Long before the hour announced the aisles, ante-rooms,, and\r\nlobbies were crowded. At three o'clock Mrs. Caroline H. Dall called\r\nthe meeting to order. Mrs. Caroline M. Severance was chosen President.\r\nOn taking the chair, she said:\r\n\r\n     This movement enrolls itself among the efforts of the age, and\r\n     the anniversaries of the week as the most radical, and yet in the\r\n     best sense the most conservative of them all. It bears the same\r\n     relation, to all the charities of the day, which strive nobly to\r\n     serve woman, that the Anti-Slavery movement bears to all\r\n     superficial palliations of slavery. Like that, it goes beneath\r\n     effects, and seeks to remove causes. After showing in a very\r\n     lucid manner the difference in the family institution, when the\r\n     mother is ignorant and enslaved, and when an educated,\r\n     harmoniously developed equal, she closed by saying: It will be\r\n     seen then, that instead of confounding the philosophy of the new\r\n     movement with theories that claim unlimited indulgence for\r\n     appetite or passion, the world should recognize in this the only\r\n     radical cure.... No statement could better define this movement\r\n     than Tennyson's beautiful stanzas:\r\n\r\n          The woman's cause is man's; they sink or rise\r\n          Together, dwarfed or godlike, bond or free,\r\n          If she be small, slight-natured, miserable,\r\n          How shall man grow?\r\n          The woman is not undeveloped man,\r\n          But diverse.\r\n\r\n          Yet in the long years, _liker_ must they grow;\r\n          The man be more of woman, she of man:\r\n          _He_ gain in sweetness and in moral height--\r\n          _She_ mental breadth, nor fail in childward care,\r\n          Nor lose the childlike in the larger mind.\r\n\r\n          And so these twain, upon the skirts of Time\r\n          Sit side by side, full-summed in all their powers,\r\n          Self-reverent each, and reverencing each;\r\n          Distinct in individualities,\r\n          But like each other, as are those who love.\r\n\r\n          Then comes the statelier Eden back to man;\r\n          Then reign the world's great bridals, chaste and calm;\r\n          Then springs the crowning race of humankind.\r\n\r\n     And we who are privileged with the poet to foresee this better\r\n     Eden; we who have\r\n\r\n          The Future grand and great,--\r\n          The safe appeal of Truth to Time,--\r\n\r\n     adopting the victorious cry of the Crusaders, \"God wills it!\" may\r\n     listen to hear above the present din and discord, the stern\r\n     mandate of His laws, bidding the world \"Onward! onward!\" and\r\n     catch the rhythmical reply of all its movements, \"We advance.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Severance then read an appropriate poem from the pen of Mrs.\r\nSarah Nowell, in which she eulogizes Florence Nightingale, Rosa\r\nBonheur, Harriet Hosmer, and asserts the equality of man and woman in\r\nthe creation.\r\n\r\nDr. Harriot K. Hunt made some pointed remarks on the education of\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. James Freeman Clarke was then introduced. He said:\r\n\r\n     I understand the cause advocated on this platform to be an\r\n     unpopular one. It is a feeble cause, a misunderstood cause, a\r\n     misrepresented cause. Hence, it seems to me, if any one is asked\r\n     to say anything in behalf of it, and if he really believes it is\r\n     a good cause, he should speak; and so I have come.\r\n\r\n     Certainly any interest which concerns one-half the human race is\r\n     an important one. Every man, no matter how stern, hard, and\r\n     unrelenting he may have become in the bitter strife and struggle\r\n     of the world, every man was once a little infant, cradled on a\r\n     mother's knee, and taking his life from the sweet fountains of\r\n     her love. He was a little child, watched by her tender, careful\r\n     eye, and so secured from ill. He was a little, inquiring boy,\r\n     with a boundless appetite for information, which only his mother\r\n     could give. At her knee he found his primary school: it is where\r\n     we have all found it. He had his sisters--the companions of his\r\n     childhood; he had the little girls, who were to him the ideals of\r\n     some wonderful goodness and excellence, some strange grace and\r\n     beauty, though he could not tell what it was. With these\r\n     antecedents no man on the face of the round world can refuse to\r\n     hear woman, when she comes earnestly, but quietly saying, \"We are\r\n     not where we ought to be;\" \"We do not have what we ought to\r\n     have.\" I think their demands are reasonable, all of them. What\r\n     are they? Occupation, education, and the highest sphere of work\r\n     of which they are capable. These I understand to be the three\r\n     demands.\r\n\r\n     1st. Occupation. When your child steals on a busy hour and asks\r\n     for \"something to do,\" you feel ashamed that you have nothing for\r\n     him--that you can not give him the natural occupation which shall\r\n     develop all the faculties of mind and body. Is it not a\r\n     reasonable request which women make, when they ask for something\r\n     to do? They want to be useful in the world. They ask permission\r\n     to support themselves and those who are dear to them. What can\r\n     they do now? They can go into factories, a few of them; a few\r\n     more can be servants in your homes; they can cook your dinner if\r\n     they have been taught how. If they are women of genius, they can\r\n     take the pen and write; but how few are there in this world,\r\n     either men or women of genius. If they have extraordinary\r\n     business talent, they can keep a boarding-house. If they have\r\n     some education they can keep school. After this, there is the\r\n     point of the needle upon which they may be precipitated--and\r\n     nothing else.\r\n\r\n     We see the gloom that must fall on them, on their children, and\r\n     on all they love, when the male protector is taken away. This\r\n     demand for more varied occupation is not a new one. Many years\r\n     ago, one of the wisest and truest men of this country, a\r\n     philanthropist and reformer--Matthew Carey, of\r\n     Philadelphia--labored to impress upon the people the fact, that\r\n     what was wanted for the elevation of woman was to open to her new\r\n     avenues of business. A very sad book was written a few months\r\n     ago, \"Dr. Sanger's work on Prostitution.\" It is a very dreadful\r\n     book; not calculated, I think, to excite any prurient feeling in\r\n     any one. In that book he says:\r\n\r\n     First, that the majority of the prostitutes of this country are\r\n     mere children, between the ages of fifteen and twenty. That the\r\n     lives of these poor, wretched, degraded creatures, last on an\r\n     average about four years. Now, when we hear of slaves used up in\r\n     six years on a sugar plantation, we think it horrible; but here\r\n     are these poor girls killed in a more dreadful way, in a shorter\r\n     time. And he adds that the principal cause of their prostitution\r\n     is that they have no occupation by which they can support\r\n     themselves. Without support, without resources, they struggle for\r\n     a while and then are thrown under the feet of the trampling city.\r\n     Give them occupation and they will take care of themselves: they\r\n     will rise out of the mire of pollution, out of this filth; for\r\n     it is not in the nature of woman to remain there. Give them at\r\n     least a chance; open wide every door; and whenever they are able\r\n     to get a living by their head or their hands in an honest way,\r\n     let them do it. This is the first claim; and it seems to me that\r\n     no one can reasonably object to it.\r\n\r\n     2d. Education. You say that public schools are open to girls as\r\n     well as boys. I know that, but what is it that educates? The\r\n     school has but little to do with it. When the boy goes there you\r\n     say, \"Go there, work with a will, and fit yourself for an\r\n     occupation whereby you may earn your bread.\" But you say to the\r\n     girls, \"Go to school, get your education, and then come home, sit\r\n     still, and do nothing.\" We must give them every chance to fit\r\n     themselves for new spheres of duty. If a woman wants to study\r\n     medicine, let her study it; if she wants to study divinity, let\r\n     her study it; if she wants to study anything, let her have the\r\n     opportunity. If she finds faculties within her, let them have a\r\n     chance to expand. That is the second demand--the whole of it.\r\n\r\n     And the third claim is for a Sphere of Influence. \"That is not\r\n     it,\" do you say? \"You want to take woman _out_ of her sphere.\"\r\n     Not at all, we wish to give her a sphere, not to take her from\r\n     any place she likes to fill; to give her a chance to exercise\r\n     those wonderful, those divine faculties that God has wrapped in\r\n     the feminine mind, in the woman's heart.\r\n\r\n     As regards voting, why should not women go to the polls? You\r\n     think it a very strange desire, I know; but we have thought many\r\n     things stranger which seem quite natural now. One need not live\r\n     long to find strange things grow common. Why not vote, then? Is\r\n     it because they have not as much power to understand what is true\r\n     and right as man? If you go to the polls, and see the style of\r\n     men who meet there voting, can you come away, and tell us that\r\n     the women you meet are not as able to decide what is right as\r\n     those men? \"Ah, it will brush off every feminine grace, if woman\r\n     goes to the polls.\" Why? \"Because she must meet rude men there.\"\r\n     Very well, so she must meet them in the street, and they do not\r\n     hurt her; nor will I believe that there is not sufficient\r\n     inventive power in the Yankee intellect to overcome this\r\n     difficulty. I can conceive of a broader and more generous\r\n     activity in politics. I can see her drawing out all the harshness\r\n     and bitterness when she goes to the polls. These three points are\r\n     all I intended to touch; and I will give way to those who are to\r\n     follow.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. CAROLINE H. DALL was then introduced. She said: I have\r\n     observed that all public orators labor under some embarrassment\r\n     when they rise to speak. Not to be behind the dignity of my\r\n     position, I labor under a _double_ embarrassment.\r\n\r\n     The first is the \"embarras des richesses.\" There are so many\r\n     topics to touch, so many facts to relate, that it is impossible\r\n     to cover them in one half hour, and the second--perhaps you will\r\n     think that an embarrassment of riches also; for it is an\r\n     embarrassment of Clarke and Phillips. The orator needs no common\r\n     courage who follows the one and precedes the other. It is my duty\r\n     to speak of the progress of the cause; it is impossible to keep\r\n     pace with it. You may work day and night, but this thought of God\r\n     outstrips you, working hourly through the life of man. Yet we\r\n     must often feel discouraged. Our war is not without; our work\r\n     follows us into the heart of the family. We must sustain\r\n     ourselves in that dear circle against our nearest friends;\r\n     against the all-pervading law, \"Thus far shalt thou come, and no\r\n     farther.\"\r\n\r\n     What have we gained since 1855? Many things, so important, that\r\n     they can not be worthily treated here. I have often mentioned in\r\n     my lectures, that in his first report to the French Government,\r\n     Neckar gave the credit of his retrenchments to his thrifty,\r\n     order-loving wife. Until this year, that acknowledgment stood\r\n     alone in history. But now John Stuart Mill, the great philosopher\r\n     and political economist of England, dedicates his \"Essay on\r\n     Liberty\" to the memory of his beloved wife, who has been the\r\n     _inspiration of all, and the author of much_ that was best in his\r\n     writings for many years past. Still farther, in a pamphlet on\r\n     \"English Political Reform,\" treating of the extension of the\r\n     suffrage, he has gone so far as to recommend that all\r\n     householders, without distinction of sex, be adopted into the\r\n     constituency, upon proving to the registrar's officer that they\r\n     have a certain income--say fifty pounds--and \"that they can read,\r\n     write, and calculate.\"\r\n\r\n     A great step was taken also in the establishment of the\r\n     Institution for the Advancement of Social Science. The sexes are\r\n     equal before it. It has five departments. 1. Jurisprudence, or\r\n     Law Reform; 2. Education; 3. Punishment and Reformation; 4.\r\n     Public Health; 5. Social Economy.\r\n\r\n     The first meeting at Liverpool considered the woman's question;\r\n     and, while it was debated, Mary Carpenter sat upon the platform,\r\n     or lifted her voice side by side with Brougham, Lord John\r\n     Russell, and Stanley. At the second meeting (last October), Lord\r\n     John Russell was in the chair. The Lord Chancellor of Ireland\r\n     presided over Law Reform; the Right Hon. W. F. Cooper, over the\r\n     department of Education; the Earl of Carlyle--personally known to\r\n     many on this platform--over that which concerns the Reformation\r\n     of Criminals; the Earl of Shaftesbury over Public Health; and\r\n     Conolly and Charles Kingsley and Tom Taylor and Rawlinson bore\r\n     witness side by side with Florence Nightingale. Sir James Stephen\r\n     presided over Social Economy. Isa Craig, the Burns poetess, is\r\n     one of its Secretaries.\r\n\r\n     Ten communications were read at this session by women; among\r\n     them, Florence Nightingale, Mary Carpenter, Isa Craig, Louisa\r\n     Twining, and Mrs. Fison. Four were on Popular Education, two upon\r\n     Punishment and Reformation, three on the Public Health in the\r\n     Army and elsewhere, one upon Social Economy. Still another proof\r\n     of progress may be seen in the examination of Florence\r\n     Nightingale by the Sanitary Commission.\r\n\r\n     [In the establishment of _The Englishwoman's Journal_ with an\r\n     honorable corps of writers, in the passage of the new Divorce\r\n     Bill, of the Married Woman's Property Bill in Canada, the cause\r\n     had gained much; on each of which Mrs. Dall spoke at some length,\r\n     especially this Property Bill, which some foolish member had\r\n     shorn of its most precious clause--that which secured her\r\n     earnings to the working-woman, lest, by tempting her to labor, it\r\n     should create a divided interest in the family].\r\n\r\n     Do you ask me why I have dwelt on this Institution for Social\r\n     Science, cataloguing the noble names that do it honor? To\r\n     strengthen the timorous hearts at the West End; to suggest to\r\n     them that a coronet of God's own giving may possibly rest as\r\n     secure as one of gold and jewels in the United Kingdom. I wish to\r\n     draw your attention to the social distinction of the men upon\r\n     that platform. No real nobleness will be imperiled by impartial\r\n     listening to our plea. Would you rest secure in our respect,\r\n     first feel secure in your own. If ten Beacon Street ladies would\r\n     go to work, and take pay for their labor, it would do more good\r\n     than all the speeches that were ever made, all the conventions\r\n     that were ever held. I honor women who act. That is the reason\r\n     that I greet so gladly girls like Harriet Hosmer, Louisa Lander,\r\n     and Margurèite Foley. Whatever they do, or do not do, for Art,\r\n     they do a great deal for the cause of Labor. I do not believe any\r\n     one in this room has any idea of the avenues that are open to\r\n     women already. Let me read you some of the results of the last\r\n     census of the United Kingdom. Talk of women not being able to\r\n     work! Women have been doing hard work ever since the world began.\r\n     You will see by this that they are doing as much as men now.\r\n     [Applause].\r\n\r\n     In 1841, there were engaged in agriculture, 66,329 women. In\r\n     1851, 128,418; nearly double the number. Of these, there are\r\n     64,000 dairy-women; women who lift enormous tubs, turn heavy\r\n     cheeses, slap butter by the hundred weight. Then come\r\n     market-gardeners, bee-mistresses, florists, flax producers and\r\n     beaters, haymakers, reapers, and hop-pickers.\r\n\r\n     In natural connection with the soil, we find seven thousand women\r\n     in the mining interest; not harnessed on all-fours to creep\r\n     through the shafts, but dressers of ore, and washers and\r\n     strainers of clay for the potteries. Next largest to the\r\n     agricultural is one not to be exactly calculated--the fishing\r\n     interest. The Pilchard fishery employs some thousands of women.\r\n     The Jersey oyster fishery alone employs one thousand. Then follow\r\n     the herring, cod, whale, and lobster fisheries.\r\n\r\n     Apart from the Christie Johnstones--the aristocrats of the\r\n     trade--the sea nurtures an heroic class like Grace Darling, who\r\n     stand aghast when society rewards a deed of humanity, and cry out\r\n     in expostulation, \"Why, every girl on the coast would have done\r\n     as I did!\" Then follow the kelp-burners, netters, and bathers.\r\n     The netters make the fisherman's nets; the bathers manage the\r\n     machines at the watering-places.\r\n\r\n     And, before quitting this subject, I should like to allude to the\r\n     French fishwomen; partly as a matter of curiosity, partly to\r\n     prove that women know how to labor. In the reign of Henry IV.,\r\n     there existed in Paris a privileged monopoly called the United\r\n     Corporation of Fishmongers and Herringers. In the reign of Louis\r\n     XIV. this corporation had managed so badly as to become\r\n     insolvent. The women who had hawked and vended fish took up the\r\n     business, and managed so well as to become very soon a political\r\n     power. They became rich, and their children married into good\r\n     families. You will remember the atrocities generally ascribed to\r\n     them in the first revolution. It is now known that these were\r\n     committed by ruffians disguised in their dress.\r\n\r\n     To return: there are in the United Kingdom 200,000 female\r\n     servants. Separate from these, brewers, custom-house searchers,\r\n     matrons of jails, lighthouse-keepers, pew-openers.\r\n\r\n     I have no time to question; but should not a Christian community\r\n     offer womanly ministrations to its imprisoned women? Oh, that\r\n     some brave heart, in a strong body, might go on our behalf to the\r\n     city jail and Charlestown! Pew-opening has never been a trade in\r\n     America; but, as there are signs that it may become so in this\r\n     democratic community, I would advise our women to keep an eye to\r\n     that. [Laughter].\r\n\r\n     There are in the United Kingdom 500,000 business women, beer-shop\r\n     keepers, butcher-wives, milk-women, hack-owners, and shoemakers.\r\n\r\n     As one item of this list, consider 26,000 butcher-wives--women\r\n     who do not merely preside over a business, but buy stock, put\r\n     down meat, drive a cart even if needed--butchers to all intents\r\n     and purposes. There are 29,000 shop-keepers, but only 1,742\r\n     shop-women.\r\n\r\n     Telegraph reporters are increasing rapidly. Their speed and\r\n     accuracy are much praised. From the Bright Festival, at\r\n     Manchester, a young woman reported, at the rate of twenty-nine\r\n     words a minute, six whole columns, with hardly a mistake, though\r\n     the whole matter was political, such as she was supposed not to\r\n     understand!\r\n\r\n     Phonographic reporters also. A year ago there were but three\r\n     female phonographers in America; and two of these did not get\r\n     their bread by the work. Now hundreds are qualifying themselves,\r\n     all over the land; and two young girls, not out of their teens,\r\n     are at this moment reporting my words. [Cheers].\r\n\r\n     I hope the phonographers will take that clapping to themselves. I\r\n     wish you would make it heartier. [Repeated cheers]. Now let us\r\n     turn to the American census. I must touch it lightly. Of factory\r\n     operatives, I will only say, that, in 1845, there were 55,828 men\r\n     and 75,710 women engaged in textile manufactures. You will be\r\n     surprised at the preponderance of women: it seems to be as great\r\n     in other countries. Then follow makers of gloves, makers of glue,\r\n     workers in gold and silver leaf, hair-weavers, hat and cap\r\n     makers, hose-weavers, workers in India rubber, lamp-makers,\r\n     laundresses, leechers, milliners, morocco-workers, nurses,\r\n     paper-hangers, physicians, picklers and preservers, saddlers and\r\n     harness-makers, shoemakers, soda-room keepers, snuff and\r\n     cigar-makers, stock and suspender-makers, truss-makers, typers\r\n     and stereotypers, umbrella-makers, upholsterers, card-makers.\r\n\r\n     Cards were invented in 1361. In less than seventy years the\r\n     German manufacture was in the hands of women--Elizabeth and\r\n     Margaret, at Nuremberg. Then grinders of watch crystals, 7,000\r\n     women in all.\r\n\r\n     My own observation adds to this list phonographers, house and\r\n     sign painters, fruit-hawkers, button-makers, tobacco-packers,\r\n     paper-box makers, embroiderers, and fur-sewers.\r\n\r\n     Perhaps I should say haymakers and reapers; since, for three or\r\n     four years, bands of girls have been so employed in Ohio, at\r\n     sixty-two and a half cents a day.\r\n\r\n     In New Haven, seven women work with seventy men in a clock\r\n     factory, at half wages. If the proprietor answered honestly, when\r\n     asked why he employed them, he would say, \"To save money;\" but he\r\n     does answer, \"To help our cause.\"\r\n\r\n     In Waltham, a watch factory has been established, whose\r\n     statistics I shall use elsewhere.\r\n\r\n     In Winchester, Va., a father has lately taken a daughter into\r\n     partnership; and the firm is \"J. Wysong and Daughter.\"\r\n     [Applause]. Is it not a shame it should happen first in a slave\r\n     State?\r\n\r\n     Then come registers of deeds and postmistresses. We all know that\r\n     the rural post-office is chiefly in the hands of irresponsible\r\n     women. Petty politicians obtain the office, take the money, and\r\n     leave wives and sisters to do the work.\r\n\r\n     [Here Mrs. Dall read an interesting letter from a female\r\n     machinist in Delaware; but, as it will be published in another\r\n     connection, it is here withheld].\r\n\r\n     Is it easy for women to break the way into new avenues? You know\r\n     it is not.\r\n\r\n     [Here Mrs. Dall referred to the opposition shown to the\r\n     employment of women in watch-making, by Mr. Bennett, in London;\r\n     to the school at Marlborough House; to the employment of women in\r\n     printing-offices--substantiating her statements by dates and\r\n     names].\r\n\r\n     When I first heard that women were employed in Staffordshire to\r\n     paint pottery and china--which they do with far more taste than\r\n     men--I heard, also, that the jealousy of the men refused to allow\r\n     them the customary hand-rest, and so kept down their wages. I\r\n     refused to believe anything so contemptible. [Applause]. Now the\r\n     Edinburgh Review confirms the story. Thank God! that could never\r\n     happen in this country. With us, Labor can not dictate to\r\n     Capital.\r\n\r\n     But the great evils which lie at the foundation of depressed\r\n     wages are:\r\n\r\n     1st. That want of respect for labor which prevents ladies from\r\n     engaging in it.\r\n\r\n     2d. That want of respect for women which prevents men from\r\n     valuing properly the work they do.\r\n\r\n     Women themselves must change these facts.\r\n\r\n     [Mrs. Dall here read some letters to show that wages were at a\r\n     starving-point in the cities of America as well as in Europe].\r\n\r\n     I am tired of the folly of the political economist, constantly\r\n     crying that wages can never rise till the laborers are fewer. You\r\n     have heard of the old law in hydraulics, that water will always\r\n     rise to the level of its source; but, if by a forcing-pump, you\r\n     raise it a thousand feet above, or by some huge syphon drop it a\r\n     thousand feet below, does that law hold? Very well, the\r\n     artificial restrictions of society are such a forcing-pump--are\r\n     such a syphon. Make woman equal before the law with man, and\r\n     wages will adjust themselves.\r\n\r\n     But what is the present remedy? A very easy one--for employers to\r\n     adopt the cash system, and be content with rational profits. In\r\n     my correspondence during the past year, master-tailors tell me\r\n     that they pay from eight cents to fifty cents a day for the\r\n     making of pantaloons, including the heaviest doeskins. Do you\r\n     suppose they would dare to tell me how they charge that work on\r\n     their slowly-paying customer's bills? Not they. The eight cents\r\n     swells to thirty, the fifty to a dollar or a dollar twenty-five.\r\n     Put an end to this, and master-tailors would no longer vault\r\n     into Beacon Street over prostrate women's souls; but neither\r\n     would women be driven to the streets for bread.\r\n\r\n     If I had time, I would show you, women, how much depends upon\r\n     yourselves. As it is, we may say with the heroine of \"Adam Bede,\"\r\n     which you have doubtless all been reading:\r\n\r\n     \"I'm not for denying that the women are foolish. God Almighty\r\n     made 'em to match the men!\" [Laughter].\r\n\r\n     Do you laugh? It is but a step from the ridiculous to the\r\n     sublime; and Goethe, who knew women well, was of the same mind\r\n     when he wrote:\r\n\r\n         \"Wilt thou dare to blame the woman for her seeming sudden\r\n             changes--\r\n         Swaying east and swaying westward, as the breezes shake the\r\n             tree?\r\n         Fool! thy selfish thought misguides thee. Find the man that\r\n             never ranges.\r\n         Woman wavers but to seek him. Is not, then, the fault in thee?\"\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Dall was followed by the Rev. JOHN T. SARGENT, who said:\r\n\r\n     MADAM PRESIDENT AND FRIENDS:--I appreciate the honor of an\r\n     invitation to this platform, but my words must be few; first,\r\n     because the call comes to me within a few hours, and amid the\r\n     cares and responsibilities of the chair on another platform, and\r\n     I had no time for preconcerted forms of address; second, because\r\n     the general principles of this organization, and the subject\r\n     matters for discussion, are so well sifted and disposed of by\r\n     previous speakers, that nothing new remains for me to say; and,\r\n     third, because we are all waiting for the words of one [Wendell\r\n     Phillips] whose sympathies are never wanting in any cause of\r\n     truth and justice, whose versatile eloquence never hesitates on\r\n     any platform where he waves aloft \"the sword of the spirit\" in\r\n     behalf of human rights. [Applause].\r\n\r\n     I may truly say, that this is my maiden speech in behalf of\r\n     maidens and others [laughter]; and, if it amount to nothing else,\r\n     I may say, as did my friend Clarke, I feel bound, at least, to\r\n     take my stand, and show my sympathy for the noble cause. I come\r\n     here under the pressure of an obligation to testify in behalf of\r\n     an interest truly Christian, and one of the greatest that can\r\n     engage the reason or the conscience of a community. I would that\r\n     you had upon this platform and every other, more women speakers\r\n     for the upholding and consummation of every righteous cause! And\r\n     so far am I from being frightened to death or embarrassed, as our\r\n     friend Mrs. Dall has intimated any one might be, at the prospect\r\n     of either following James Freeman Clarke or preceding Wendell\r\n     Phillips, I am much more concerned by the contrast of my speech\r\n     with such speakers as your President, or Dr. Hunt, or Mrs. Dall\r\n     herself.\r\n\r\n     There is one feature of the general question of \"Woman's Rights\"\r\n     on which I would say a single word; and it may constitute the\r\n     specialty of my address, so far as it has any. I mean the bearing\r\n     of social inequalities particularly upon the poor--the poor of a\r\n     city--the poor women of a city.\r\n\r\n     It may not be unknown to most of you, that for nearly two years\r\n     past, in connection with the so-called \"Boston Provident\r\n     Association,\" I have been engaged in an agency wherein the\r\n     peculiar trials of this class have been revealed to me as never\r\n     before.\r\n\r\n     Hundreds of poor, desolate, forsaken women, especially in the\r\n     winter months, have come to that office with the same pitiable\r\n     tale of poverty, desertion, and tyranny on the part of their\r\n     worthless and drunken husbands, who had gone off to California,\r\n     Kansas, or the West, taking away from their wives and children\r\n     every possible means of support, and leaving them the pauper\r\n     dependents on a public charity. Now, if this be not the denial of\r\n     Woman's Rights, I know not what is. Had we time, I might fill the\r\n     hour with a journal of statistics in painful illustration of\r\n     these facts. Now, I say, that a system of society which can\r\n     tolerate such a state of things, and, by sufferance even, allow\r\n     such men to wrench away the plain rights of their wives and\r\n     families, needs reforming.\r\n\r\n     But let us look a little higher in the social scale, to the\r\n     rights and claims of a class of women not so dependent--a class\r\n     who, by their education and culture, are competent to fill, or\r\n     who may be filling, the position of clerks, secretaries, or\r\n     assistant agents. How inadequate and insufficient, as a general\r\n     thing, is the compensation they receive!\r\n\r\n     There was associated with me in the agency and office to which I\r\n     have referred, as office-clerk and coadjutor, among others, an\r\n     intelligent and very worthy young woman, whose term of service\r\n     there has been coeval and coincident with the Association itself,\r\n     even through the whole seven years or more; and there she still\r\n     survives, through all the vicissitudes of the General Agency by\r\n     death or otherwise, with a fidelity of service worthy of more\r\n     liberal compensation; for she receives, even now, for an amount\r\n     of service equal to that of any other in the office, only about\r\n     one-third the salary paid to a male occupant of the same sphere!\r\n\r\n     Look next at the professional sphere of women, properly so\r\n     called; and who shall deny her right and claim to that position?\r\n     A young brother clergyman came to my office one day, wanting his\r\n     pulpit supplied; and, in the course of conversation, asked very\r\n     earnestly, \"How would it do to invite a woman-preacher into my\r\n     pulpit?\" \"Do!\" said I (giving him the names of Mrs. Dall, Dr.\r\n     Hunt, etc., as the most accessible) \"of course it'll do.\" And all\r\n     I have to say is, if I ever resume again the charge of a pulpit\r\n     myself, and either of those preachers want an exchange, I shall\r\n     be honored in the privilege of so exchanging.\r\n\r\n     Well, my young friend, the brother clergyman referred to, whom I\r\n     am glad to see in this audience, went and did according to my\r\n     suggestion; and, by the professional service of Mrs. Dall in his\r\n     pulpit, more than once, I think, ministered no little edification\r\n     to his people. And, in this connection, let me say: If the\r\n     argument against woman's preaching be, \"Oh! it looks so awkward\r\n     and singular to see a woman with a gown on in the pulpit\" (for\r\n     that's the whole gist of it), why, then, the same logic might as\r\n     well disrobe the male priesthood of their silken paraphernalia,\r\n     cassock and bands.\r\n\r\n     But there are other and better words in waiting, and I yield the\r\n     floor.\r\n\r\n     CHARLES G. AMES expressed his gratitude at being permitted to\r\n     occupy this platform, and identify himself with the cause of\r\n     those noblest of living women who had dared the world's\r\n     scorn--had dared to stand alone on the ground of their moral\r\n     convictions. He thought Rev. Mr. Clarke had spoken but half the\r\n     truth in saying, \"Half the human race are concerned in the\r\n     Woman's Rights movement.\"\r\n\r\n     If the Mohammedan doctrine (that woman has no soul) be true,\r\n     then the opponents of this cause are justifiable. But concede\r\n     that she has a rational soul, and you concede the equality of her\r\n     rights. Concede that she is capable of being a Christian, and you\r\n     concede that she has a right to help do the Christian's work; and\r\n     the Christian's work includes all forms of noble activity, as\r\n     well as the duty of self-development.\r\n\r\n     But some people are afraid of agitation. You remember the story\r\n     of the rustic, who fainted away in the car when taking his first\r\n     railroad ride, and gasped out, on coming to himself, \"Has the\r\n     thing lit?\" He belonged, probably, to that large class of people\r\n     who go into hysterics every time the world begins to move, and\r\n     who are never relieved from their terror till quiet is restored.\r\n\r\n     Great alarm prevails lest this agitation should breed a fatal\r\n     quarrel between man and woman; as though there could be a want of\r\n     harmony, a collision of rights, between the sexes. Sad visions\r\n     are conjured up before us of family feuds, mutual hair-pullings,\r\n     and a general wreck of all domestic bliss. Certainly, there are\r\n     difficulties about settling some domestic questions. Marriage is\r\n     a partnership between two; no third person to give the casting\r\n     vote. Then they must \"take turns\"; the wife yielding to the\r\n     husband in those cases where he is best qualified to judge, and\r\n     the husband yielding to the wife in those matters which most\r\n     concern her, or concerning which she can best judge. Yet man is\r\n     the senior partner of the firm: his name comes first. Few women\r\n     would be pleased to see the firm styled in print as \"Mrs.\r\n     So-and-So and Husband.\"\r\n\r\n     Woman wants more self-reliance. Has she not always been taught\r\n     that it is very proper to faint at the sight of toads and spiders\r\n     and fresh blood, and whenever a gentleman pops the question? Has\r\n     she not always been taught that man was the strong, towering oak,\r\n     and she the graceful, clinging vine, sure to collapse like an\r\n     empty bag whenever his mighty support was withdrawn? Until all\r\n     this folly is unlearned, how can she be self-dependent and truly\r\n     womanly?\r\n\r\n     Women are afraid to claim their rights; and not timidity only,\r\n     but laziness--the love of ease--keeps them back from the great\r\n     duty of self-assertion. True, it is a good deal like work to\r\n     summon up the soul to such a conflict with an opposing and\r\n     corrupt public opinion. But woman must do that work for herself,\r\n     or it will never be done.\r\n\r\n     Woman's _rights_ we talk of. There is a grandeur about these\r\n     great questions of right, which makes them the glory of our age;\r\n     and it is the shame of our age, that right and rights in every\r\n     form get so generally sneered at. What use have I for my\r\n     conscience, what remains of my noble manhood, if, when half the\r\n     human race complain that I am doing them a wrong, I only reply\r\n     with a scoff? A man without a conscience to make him quick and\r\n     sensitive to right and duty, is neither fit for heaven nor for\r\n     hell. He is an outsider, a monster!\r\n\r\n     Conservatism says, \"Let the world be as it is\"; but Christianity\r\n     says, \"Make it what it should be.\" No man need call himself a\r\n     Christian, who admits that a wrong exists, and yet wishes it to\r\n     continue, or is indifferent to its removal. Let us\r\n\r\n          \"Strike for that which ought to be,\r\n          And God will bless the blows.\"\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: PAULINA WRIGHT DAVIS (with autograph).]\r\n\r\n     The speaker spoke of the abuse and injustice done to the Bible by\r\n     those who make it the shelter and apologist for all the wrong,\r\n     vileness, and sneaking meanness that the world bears up; and\r\n     closed with a testimony against the cowardice of those\r\n     time-serving ministers who allow their manhood to be suffocated\r\n     by a white cravat, and who never publicly take sides with what\r\n     they see to be a good cause, until \"popular noises\" indicate that\r\n     the time has come for speaking out their opinions.\r\n\r\n     The President then introduced to the audience WENDELL PHILLIPS,\r\n     Esq., of Boston:\r\n\r\n     MADAM PRESIDENT:--I am exceedingly happy to see that this\r\n     question calls together so large an audience; and perhaps that\r\n     circumstance will make me take exception to some representations\r\n     of the previous speakers as to the unpopularity of this movement.\r\n     The gentleman who occupied this place before me thought that\r\n     perhaps he might count the numbers of those that occupied this\r\n     platform as the real advocates of that question. Oh, no! The\r\n     number of those who sympathize with us must not be counted so.\r\n     Our idea penetrates the whole life of the people. The shifting\r\n     hues of public opinion show like the colors on a dove's neck; you\r\n     can not tell where one ends, or the other begins. [Cheers].\r\n     Everybody that holds to raising human beings above the popular\r\n     ideas, and not caring for artificial distinctions, is on our\r\n     side; I think I can show my friend that. Whenever a new reform is\r\n     started, men seem to think that the world is going to take at\r\n     once a great stride. The world never takes strides. The moral\r\n     world is exactly like the natural. The sun comes up minute by\r\n     minute, ray by ray, till the twilight deepens into dawn, and dawn\r\n     spreads into noon. So it is with this question. Those who look at\r\n     our little island of time do not see it; but, a hundred years\r\n     later, everybody will recognize it.\r\n\r\n     No one need be at all afraid; there is no disruption, no breaking\r\n     away from old anchorage--not at all. In the thirteenth and\r\n     fourteenth centuries, there were two movements--first, the\r\n     peasants in the town were striving to fortify each man his own\r\n     house--to set up the towns against the kings; then, in the\r\n     colleges, the great philosophers were striving each to fortify\r\n     his own soul to make a revolution against Rome. The peasants\r\n     branded the collegians as \"infidels,\" and the collegians showed\r\n     the peasants to be \"traitors.\" Cordially they hated each other;\r\n     blindly they went down to their graves, thinking they had been\r\n     fighting each other; but, under the providence of God, they were\r\n     entwined in the same movement. Now, if I could throw you back\r\n     to-day into the civilization of Greece and Rome, I could show you\r\n     the fact that our question is two thousand years old. [Cheers.]\r\n     In the truest sense, it did not begin in 1848, as my friend Dr.\r\n     Hunt stated; it began centuries ago. Did you ever hear of the old\r\n     man who went to the doctor, and asked him to teach him to speak\r\n     prose? \"Why, my dear fellow,\" was the reply, \"you have been\r\n     speaking prose all your life.\" But he did not know it. So with\r\n     some people in regard to the movement for Woman's Rights.\r\n\r\n     Many think the steps taken since 1850 are shaking this land with\r\n     a new infidelity. Now, this infidelity is a good deal older than\r\n     the New Testament. When man began his pilgrimage from the cradle\r\n     of Asia, woman was not allowed to speak before a court of\r\n     justice. To kill a woman was just as great a sin as to kill a\r\n     cow, and no greater. To sell an unlicensed herb in the city of\r\n     Calcutta, was exactly the same crime as to kill a woman. She did\r\n     not belong to the human race. Come down thousands of years, and\r\n     the civilization of Greece said, \"Woman has not got enough of\r\n     truth in her to be trusted in the court of justice;\" and, if her\r\n     husband wants to give her to a brother or friend, he can take her\r\n     to their door, and say, \"Here, I give you this.\" And so it\r\n     continues till you reach the feudal ages; when woman, though she\r\n     might be queen or duchess, was often not competent to testify in\r\n     a court of justice. She had not soul enough, men believed, to\r\n     know a truth from a lie. That is the code of the feudal system.\r\n     But all at once the world has waked up, and thinks a man is not a\r\n     man because he has a pound of muscle, or because he has a\r\n     stalwart arm; but because he has thoughts, ideas, purposes: he\r\n     can commit crime, and he is capable of virtue.\r\n\r\n     No man is born in a day. A baby is always six months old before\r\n     he is twenty-one. Our fathers, who first reasoned that God made\r\n     all men equal, said: \"You sha'n't hang a man until you have asked\r\n     him if he consents to the law.\" Some meddlesome fanatic, engaged\r\n     in setting up type, conceived the idea, that he need not pay his\r\n     tax till he was represented before the law: then why should woman\r\n     do so? Now, I ask, what possible reason is there that woman, as a\r\n     mother, as a wife, as a laborer, as a capitalist, as an artist,\r\n     as a citizen, should be subjected to any laws except such as\r\n     govern man? What moral reason is there for this, under the\r\n     American idea? Does not the same interest, the same strong tie,\r\n     bind the mother to her children, that bind the father? Has she\r\n     not the same capacity to teach them that the father has? and\r\n     often more? Now, the law says: \"If the father be living, the\r\n     mother is nothing; but, if the father be dead, the mother is\r\n     everything.\" Did she inherit from her husband his great\r\n     intellect? If she did not, what is the common sense of such a\r\n     statute? The mother has the same rights, in regard to her\r\n     children, that the father has: there should be no distinction.\r\n\r\n     Yours is not a new reform. The gentleman who occupied the\r\n     platform a few moments ago gave the common representation of this\r\n     cause: \"If a husband doesn't do about right, his wife will pull\r\n     his hair; and, if you let her have her way, she may vote the\r\n     Democratic ticket, and he the Republican; and _vice versa_.\"\r\n     Well, now, my dear friend, suppose it were just so; it is too\r\n     late to complain. That point has long been settled; if you will\r\n     read history a little, you will see it was settled against you.\r\n     In the time of Luther, it was a question: \"Can a woman choose her\r\n     own creed?\" The feudal ages said: \"No; she believes as her\r\n     husband believes, of course.\" But the reformers said: \"She ought\r\n     to think for herself; her husband is not her God.\" \"But,\" it was\r\n     objected, \"should there be difference of opinion between man and\r\n     wife, the husband believing one creed and the wife another, there\r\n     would be continual discord.\" But the reply was: \"God settled\r\n     that; God has settled it that every responsible conscience should\r\n     have a right to his own creed.\" And Christendom said: \"Amen.\" The\r\n     reformers of Europe, to this day, have allowed freedom of\r\n     opinion; and who says that the experience of three centuries has\r\n     found the husband and wife grappling each other's throats on\r\n     religious differences? It would be Papal and absurd to deny woman\r\n     her religious rights. Then why should she not be allowed to\r\n     choose her party?\r\n\r\n     We claim the precedents in this matter. It was arranged and\r\n     agreed upon, in the reform of Europe, that women should have the\r\n     right to choose their religious creeds. I say, therefore, this is\r\n     not a new cause; it is an old one. It is as old as the American\r\n     idea. We are individuals by virtue of our brains, not by virtue\r\n     of our muscles. \"Why do you women meddle in politics?\" asked\r\n     Napoleon of De Staël. \"Sire, so long as you will hang us, we must\r\n     ask the reason,\" was the answer. The whole political philosophy\r\n     of the subject is in that. The instant you say, \"Woman is not\r\n     competent to go to the ballot-box,\" I reply: \"She is not\r\n     competent to go to the gallows or the State prison. If she is\r\n     competent to go to the State prison, then she is competent to go\r\n     to the ballot-box, and tell how thieves should be punished.\"\r\n     [Applause].\r\n\r\n     Man is a man because he thinks. Woman has already begun to think.\r\n     She has touched literature with the wand of her enchantment, and\r\n     it rises to her level, until woman becomes an author as well as\r\n     reader. And what is the result? We do not have to expurgate the\r\n     literature of the nineteenth century before placing it in the\r\n     hands of youth. Those who write for the lower level sink down to\r\n     dwell with their kind.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Sargent and Mr. Clarke expatiated on the wholesome influence\r\n     of the side-by-side progress of the sexes. There are no women\r\n     more deserving of your honest approbation than those who dare to\r\n     work singly for the elevation of their sex....\r\n\r\n     Woman's Rights and Negro Rights! What rights have either women or\r\n     negroes that we have any reason to respect? The world says:\r\n     \"None!\"\r\n\r\n     There has lately been a petition carried into the British\r\n     Parliament, asking--for what? It asks that the laws of marriage\r\n     and divorce shall be brought into conformity with the creed and\r\n     civilization of Great Britain in the middle of the nineteenth\r\n     century. The state of British law, on the bill of divorce, was a\r\n     disgrace to the British statute-book. Whose was the intellect and\r\n     whose the heart to point out, and who had the courage to look in\r\n     the face of British wealth and conservatism, and claim that the\r\n     law of divorce was a disgrace to modern civilization? It was the\r\n     women of Great Britain that first said her statute-book disgraced\r\n     her. Who could say, that if those women had been voters, they\r\n     might not have reformed it?\r\n\r\n     Douglas Jerrold said: \"Woman knows she is omnipotent\"; and so she\r\n     is. She may be ignorant, she may not have a dollar, she may have\r\n     no right given her to testify in the court of justice; she may be\r\n     a slave, chained by a dozen statutes; but, when her husband loves\r\n     her, she is his queen and mistress, in spite of them all; and the\r\n     world knows it. All history bears testimony to this omnipotent\r\n     influence. What we are here for is to clear up the choked\r\n     channel; make hidden power confess itself, and feel its\r\n     responsibility, feel how much rests upon it, and therefore gird\r\n     itself to its duty. We are to say to the women: \"Yours is\r\n     one-half of the human race. Come to the ballot-box, and feel,\r\n     when you cast a vote in regard to some great moral question, the\r\n     dread post you fill, and fit yourself for it.\" Woman at home\r\n     controls her son, guides her husband--in reality, makes him\r\n     vote--but acknowledges no responsibility, and receives no\r\n     education for such a throne. By her caprices in private life, she\r\n     often ruins the manhood of her husband, and checks the\r\n     enthusiastic purposes of her son.\r\n\r\n     Many a young girl, in her married life, loses her husband, and\r\n     thus is left a widow with two or three children. Now, who is to\r\n     educate them and control them? We see, if left to her own\r\n     resources, the intellect which she possesses, and which has\r\n     remained in a comparatively dormant state, displayed in its full\r\n     power. What a depth of heart lay hidden in that woman! She takes\r\n     her husband's business--guides it as though it were a trifle; she\r\n     takes her sons, and leads them; sets her daughters an example;\r\n     like a master-leader, she governs the whole household. That is\r\n     woman's influence. What made that woman? Responsibility. Call her\r\n     out from weakness, lay upon her soul the burden of her children's\r\n     education, and she is no longer a girl, but a woman!\r\n\r\n     Horace Greeley once said to Margaret Fuller: \"If you should ask a\r\n     woman to carry a ship round Cape Horn, how would she go to work\r\n     to do it? Let her do this, and I will give up the question.\" In\r\n     the fall of 1856, a Boston girl, only twenty years of age,\r\n     accompanied her husband to California. A brain-fever laid him\r\n     low. In the presence of mutiny and delirium, she took his vacant\r\n     post, preserved order, and carried her cargo safe to its destined\r\n     port. Looking in the face of Mr. Greeley, Miss Fuller said: \"Lo!\r\n     my dear Horace, it is done; now say, what shall woman: do next?\"\r\n     [Cheers].\r\n\r\n     Mrs. CAROLINE H. DALL then dismissed the assembly.[52]\r\n\r\nIn _The Liberator_ of July 6, 1860, we find a brief mention of what\r\nwas called Mrs. Dall's \"Drawing-room\" Convention, in which it was\r\nproposed to present the artistic and æsthetic view of the question.\r\nThe meeting was held June 1st, in the Melodeon. Mrs. Caroline M.\r\nSeverance presided. Mrs. Dall, Rev. Samuel J. May, R. J. Hinton, Moses\r\n(Harriet Tubman), James Freeman Clarke, Dr. Mercy B. Jackson,\r\nElizabeth M. Powell, and Wendell Phillips took part in the\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nWe close our chapter on Massachusetts, with a few extracts from a\r\nsermon by Theodore Parker, to show his position on the most momentous\r\nquestion of his day and generation. In March, 1853, he gave two\r\ndiscourses in Music Hall, Boston, one on the domestic, and one on the\r\npublic function of woman, in which he fully expressed himself on every\r\nphase of the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n               THEODORE PARKER--THE PUBLIC FUNCTION OF WOMAN.\r\n\r\n     If woman is a human being, first, she has the Nature of a human\r\n     being; next, she has the Right of a human being; third, she has\r\n     the Duty of a human being. The Nature is the capacity to possess,\r\n     to use, to develop, and to enjoy every human faculty; the Right\r\n     is the right to enjoy, develop, and use every human faculty; and\r\n     the Duty is to make use of the Right, and make her human nature,\r\n     human history. She is here to develop her human nature, enjoy her\r\n     human rights, perform her human duty. Womankind is to do this for\r\n     herself, as much as mankind for himself. A woman has the same\r\n     human nature that a man has; the same human rights, to life,\r\n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; the same human duties; and\r\n     they are as inalienable in a woman as in a man.\r\n\r\n     Each man has the natural right to the normal development of his\r\n     nature, so far as it is general-human, neither man nor woman, but\r\n     human. Each woman has the natural right to the normal development\r\n     of her nature, so far as it is general-human, neither woman nor\r\n     man. But each man has also a natural and inalienable right to the\r\n     normal development of his peculiar nature as man, where he\r\n     differs from woman. Each woman has just the same natural and\r\n     inalienable right to the normal development of her peculiar\r\n     nature as woman, and not man. All that is undeniable.\r\n\r\n     Now see what follows. Woman has the same individual right to\r\n     determine her aim in life, and to follow it; has the same\r\n     individual rights of body and of spirit--of mind and conscience,\r\n     and heart and soul; the same physical rights, the same\r\n     intellectual, moral, affectional, and religious rights, that man\r\n     has. That is true of womankind as a whole; it is true of Jane,\r\n     Ellen, and Sally, and each special woman that can be named.\r\n\r\n     Every person, man or woman, is an integer, an individual, a whole\r\n     person; and also a portion of the race, and so a fraction of\r\n     humankind. Well, the Rights of individualism are not to be\r\n     possessed, developed, used, and enjoyed, by a life in solitude,\r\n     but by joint action. Accordingly, to complete and perfect the\r\n     individual man or woman, and give each an opportunity to possess,\r\n     use, develop, and enjoy these rights, there must be concerted and\r\n     joint action; else individuality is only a possibility, not a\r\n     reality. So the individual rights of woman carry with them the\r\n     same domestic, social, ecclesiastical, and political rights, as\r\n     those of man.\r\n\r\n     The Family, Community, Church and State, are four modes of action\r\n     which have grown out of human nature in its historical\r\n     development; they are all necessary for the development of\r\n     mankind; machines which the human race has devised, in order to\r\n     possess, use, develop, and enjoy their rights as human beings,\r\n     their rights also as men.\r\n\r\n     These are just as necessary for the development of woman as of\r\n     man; and, as she has the same nature, right, and duty, as man, it\r\n     follows that she has the same right to use, shape, and control\r\n     these four institutions, for her general human purpose and for\r\n     her special feminine purpose, that man has to control them for\r\n     his general human purpose and his special masculine purpose. All\r\n     that is as undeniable as anything in metaphysics or mathematics.\r\n\r\n     If woman had been consulted, it seems to me theology would have\r\n     been in a vastly better state than it is now. I do not think that\r\n     any woman would ever have preached the damnation of babies\r\n     new-born; and \"hell, paved with the skulls of infants not a span\r\n     long,\" would be a region yet to be discovered in theology. A\r\n     celibate monk--with God's curse writ on his face, which knew no\r\n     child, no wife, no sister, and blushed that he had a\r\n     mother--might well dream of such a thing. He had been through the\r\n     preliminary studies. Consider the ghastly attributes which are\r\n     commonly put upon God in the popular theology; the idea of\r\n     infinite wrath, of infinite damnation, and total depravity, and\r\n     all that. Why, you could not get a woman, that had intellect\r\n     enough to open her mouth, to preach these things anywhere. Women\r\n     think they think that they believe them; but they do not.\r\n     Celibate priests, who never knew marriage, or what paternity was,\r\n     who thought woman was a \"pollution\"--they invented these ghastly\r\n     doctrines; and when I have heard the Athanasian Creed and the\r\n     Dies Iræ chanted by monks, with the necks of bulls and the lips\r\n     of donkeys--why, I have understood where the doctrine came from,\r\n     and have felt the appropriateness of their braying out the\r\n     damnation hymns; woman could not do it. We shut her out of the\r\n     choir, out of the priest's house, out of the pulpit; and then the\r\n     priest, with unnatural vows, came in, and taught these \"doctrines\r\n     of devils.\" Could you find a woman who would read to a\r\n     congregation, as words of truth, Jonathan Edwards' sermon on a\r\n     Future State--\"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God,\" \"The\r\n     Justice of God in the Damnation of Sinners,\" \"Wrath upon the\r\n     Wicked to the Uttermost,\" \"The Future Punishment of the Wicked,\"\r\n     and other things of that sort? Nay, can you find a worthy woman,\r\n     of any considerable culture, who will read the fourteenth chapter\r\n     of Numbers, and declare that a true picture of the God she\r\n     worships? Only a she-dragon could do it in our day.\r\n\r\n     The popular theology leaves us nothing feminine in the character\r\n     of God. How could it be otherwise, when so much of the popular\r\n     theology is the work of men who thought woman was a \"pollution,\"\r\n     and barred her out of all the high places of the church? If women\r\n     had had their place in ecclesiastical teaching, I doubt that the\r\n     \"Athanasian Creed\" would ever have been thought a \"symbol\" of\r\n     Christianity. The pictures and hymns which describe the last\r\n     judgment are a protest against the exclusion of woman from\r\n     teaching in the church. \"I suffer not a woman to teach, but to be\r\n     in silence,\" said a writer in the New Testament. The sentence has\r\n     brought manifold evil in its train. So much for the employments\r\n     of women.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     By nature, woman has the same political rights that man has--to\r\n     vote, to hold office, to make and administer laws. These she has\r\n     as a matter of right. The strong hand and the great head of man\r\n     keep her down; nothing more. In America, in Christendom, woman\r\n     has no political rights, is not a citizen in full; she has no\r\n     voice in making or administering the laws, none in electing the\r\n     rulers or administrators thereof. She can hold no office--can not\r\n     be committee of a primary school, overseer of the poor, or\r\n     guardian to a public lamp-post. But any man, with conscience\r\n     enough to keep out of jail, mind enough to escape the\r\n     poor-house, and body enough to drop his ballot into the box, he\r\n     is a voter. He may have no character--even no money; that is no\r\n     matter--he is male. The noblest woman has no voice in the State.\r\n     Men make laws, disposing of her property, her person, her\r\n     children; still she must bear it, \"with a patient shrug.\"\r\n\r\n     Looking at it as a matter of pure right and pure science, I know\r\n     no reason why woman should not be a voter, or hold office, or\r\n     make and administer laws. I do not see how I can shut myself into\r\n     political privileges and shut woman out, and do both in the name\r\n     of inalienable right. Certainly, every woman has a natural right\r\n     to have her property represented in the general representation of\r\n     property, and her person represented in the general\r\n     representation of persons.\r\n\r\n     Looking at it as a matter of expediency, see some facts. Suppose\r\n     woman had a share in the municipal regulation of Boston, and\r\n     there were as many alderwomen as aldermen, as many common council\r\n     women as common council men, do you believe that, in defiance of\r\n     the law of Massachusetts, the city government, last spring, would\r\n     have licensed every two hundred and forty-fourth person of the\r\n     population of the city to sell intoxicating drink? would have\r\n     made every thirty-fifth voter a rum-seller? I do not.\r\n\r\n     Do you believe the women of Boston would spend ten thousand\r\n     dollars in one year in a city frolic, or spend two or three\r\n     thousand every year, on the Fourth of July, for sky-rockets and\r\n     firecrackers; would spend four or five thousand dollars to get\r\n     their Canadian guests drunk in Boston harbor, and then pretend\r\n     that Boston had not money enough to establish a high-school for\r\n     girls, to teach the daughters of mechanics and grocers to read\r\n     French and Latin, and to understand the higher things which rich\r\n     men's sons are driven to at college? I do not.\r\n\r\n     Do you believe that the women of Boston, in 1851, would have\r\n     spent three or four thousand dollars to kidnap a poor man, and\r\n     have taken all the chains which belonged to the city and put them\r\n     round the court-house, and have drilled three hundred men, armed\r\n     with bludgeons and cutlasses, to steal a man and carry him back\r\n     to slavery? I do not. Do you think, if the women had had the\r\n     control, \"fifteen hundred men of property and standing\" would\r\n     have volunteered to take a poor man, kidnapped in Boston, and\r\n     conduct him out of the State, with fire and sword? I believe no\r\n     such thing.\r\n\r\n     Do you think the women of Boston would take the poorest and most\r\n     unfortunate children in the town, put them all together into one\r\n     school, making that the most miserable in the city, where they\r\n     had not and could not have half the advantages of the other\r\n     children in different schools, and all that because the\r\n     unfortunates were dark-colored? Do you think the women of Boston\r\n     would shut a bright boy out of the High-School or Latin-School,\r\n     because he was black in the face?\r\n\r\n     Women are said to be cowardly. When Thomas Sims, out of his\r\n     dungeon, sent to the churches his petition for their prayers, had\r\n     women been \"the Christian clergy,\" do you believe they would not\r\n     have dared to pray?\r\n\r\n     If women had a voice in the affairs of Massachusetts, do you\r\n     think they would ever have made laws so that a lazy husband could\r\n     devour all the substance of his active wife--spite of her wish;\r\n     so that a drunken husband could command her bodily presence in\r\n     his loathly house; and when an infamous man was divorced from his\r\n     wife, that he could keep all the children? I confess I do not.\r\n\r\n     If the affairs of the nation had been under woman's joint\r\n     control, I doubt that we should have butchered the Indians with\r\n     such exterminating savagery, that, in fifty years, we should have\r\n     spent seven hundred millions of dollars for war, and now, in time\r\n     of peace, send twenty annual millions more to the same waste. I\r\n     doubt that we should have spread slavery into nine new States,\r\n     and made it national. I think the Fugitive Slave bill would never\r\n     have been an act. Woman has some respect for the natural law of\r\n     God.\r\n\r\n     I know men say woman can not manage the great affairs of a\r\n     nation. Very well. Government is political economy--national\r\n     housekeeping. Does any respectable woman keep house so badly as\r\n     the United States? with so much bribery, so much corruption, so\r\n     much quarrelling in the domestic councils?\r\n\r\n     But government is also political morality, it is national ethics.\r\n     Is there any worthy woman who rules her household as wickedly as\r\n     the nations are ruled? who hires bullies to fight for her? Is\r\n     there any woman who treats one-sixth part of her household as if\r\n     they were cattle and not creatures of God, as if they were things\r\n     and not persons? I know of none such. In government as\r\n     housekeeping, or government as morality, I think man makes a very\r\n     poor appearance, when he says woman could not do as well as he\r\n     has done and is doing.\r\n\r\n     I doubt that women will ever, as a general thing, take the same\r\n     interest as men in political affairs, or find therein an abiding\r\n     satisfaction. But that is for women themselves to determine, not\r\n     for men.\r\n\r\n     In order to attain the end--the development of man in body and\r\n     spirit--human institutions must represent all parts of human\r\n     nature, both the masculine and the feminine element. For the\r\n     well-being of the human race, we need the joint action of man and\r\n     woman, in the family, the community, the Church, and the State. A\r\n     family without the presence of woman--with no mother, no wife, no\r\n     sister, no womankind--is a sad thing. I think a community without\r\n     woman's equal social action, a church without her equal\r\n     ecclesiastical action, and a State without her equal political\r\n     action, is almost as bad--is very much what a house would be\r\n     without a mother, wife, sister, or friend.\r\n\r\n     You see what prevails in the Christian civilization of the\r\n     nineteenth century; it is Force--force of body, force of brain.\r\n     There is little justice, little philanthropy, little piety.\r\n     Selfishness preponderates everywhere in Christendom--individual,\r\n     domestic, social, ecclesiastical, national selfishness. It is\r\n     preached as gospel and enacted as law. It is thought good\r\n     political economy for a strong people to devour the weak nations;\r\n     for \"Christian\" England and America to plunder the \"heathen\" and\r\n     annex their land; for a strong class to oppress and ruin the\r\n     feeble class; for the capitalists of England to pauperize the\r\n     poor white laborer; for the capitalists of America to enslave the\r\n     poorer black laborer; for a strong man to oppress the weak men;\r\n     for the sharper to buy labor too cheap, and sell its product too\r\n     dear, and so grow rich by making many poor. Hence, nation is\r\n     arrayed against nation, class against class, man against man.\r\n     Nay, it is commonly taught that mankind is arrayed against God,\r\n     and God against man; that the world is a universal discord: that\r\n     there is no solidarity of man with man, of man with God. I fear\r\n     we shall never get far beyond this theory and this practice,\r\n     until woman has her natural rights as the equal of man, and takes\r\n     her natural place in regulating the affairs of the family, the\r\n     community, the Church, and the State. It seems to me God has\r\n     treasured up a reserved power in the nature of woman to correct\r\n     many of those evils which are Christendom's disgrace to-day.\r\n\r\n     Circumstances help or hinder our development, and are one of the\r\n     two forces which determine the actual character of a nation or of\r\n     mankind, at any special period. Hitherto, amongst men,\r\n     circumstances have favored the development of only intellectual\r\n     power, in all its forms--chiefly in its lower forms. At present,\r\n     mankind, as a whole, has the superiority over womankind, as a\r\n     whole, in all that pertains to intellect, the higher and the\r\n     lower. Man has knowledge, has ideas, has administrative skill;\r\n     enacts the rules of conduct for the individual, the family, the\r\n     community, the Church, the State, and the world. He applies these\r\n     rules of conduct to life, and so controls the great affairs of\r\n     the human race. You see what a world he has made of it. There is\r\n     male vigor in this civilization, miscalled \"Christian\"; and in\r\n     its leading nations there are industry and enterprise, which\r\n     never fail. There is science, literature, legislation,\r\n     agriculture, manufactures, mining, commerce, such as the world\r\n     never saw. With the vigor of war, the Anglo-Saxon now works the\r\n     works of peace. England abounds in wealth--richest of lands; but\r\n     look at her poor, her vast army of paupers, two million strong,\r\n     the Irish whom she drives with the hand of famine across the sea.\r\n     Martin Luther was right when he said: \"The richer the nation, the\r\n     poorer the poor.\" Look at the cities of England and America. What\r\n     riches, what refinement, what culture of man and woman too! Ay;\r\n     but what poverty, what ignorance, what beastliness of man and\r\n     woman too! The Christian civilization of the nineteenth century\r\n     is well summed up in London and New York--the two foci of the\r\n     Anglo-Saxon tribe, which control the shape of the world's\r\n     commercial ellipse. Look at the riches and the misery; at the\r\n     \"religious enterprise\" and the heathen darkness; at the virtue,\r\n     the decorum, and the beauty of woman well-born and well bred; and\r\n     at the wild sea of prostitution, which swells and breaks and\r\n     dashes against the bulwarks of society--every ripple was a woman\r\n     once!\r\n\r\n     Oh, brother-men, who make these things, is this a pleasant sight?\r\n     Does your literature complain of it--of the waste of human life,\r\n     the slaughter of human souls, the butchery of woman? British\r\n     literature begins to wail, in \"Nicholas Nickleby\" and \"Jane Eyre\"\r\n     and \"Mary Barton\" and \"Alton Locke,\" in many a \"Song of the\r\n     Shirt\"; but the respectable literature of America is deaf as a\r\n     cent to the outcry of humanity expiring in agonies. It is busy\r\n     with California, or the Presidency, or extolling iniquity in high\r\n     places, or flattering the vulgar vanity which buys its dross for\r\n     gold. It can not even imitate the philanthropy of English\r\n     letters; it is \"up\" for California and a market. Does not the\r\n     Church speak?--the English Church, with its millions of money;\r\n     the American, with its millions of men--both wont to bay the moon\r\n     of foreign heathenism? The Church is a dumb dog, that can not\r\n     bark, sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber. It is a church\r\n     without woman, believing in a male and jealous God, and rejoicing\r\n     in a boundless, endless hell!\r\n\r\n     Hitherto, with woman, circumstances have hindered the development\r\n     of intellectual power, in all its forms. She has not knowledge,\r\n     has not ideas or practical skill to equal the force of man. But\r\n     circumstances have favored the development of pure and lofty\r\n     emotion in advance of man. She has moral feeling, affectional\r\n     feeling, religious feeling, far in advance of man; her moral,\r\n     affectional, and religious intuitions are deeper and more\r\n     trustworthy than his. Here she is eminent, as he is in knowledge,\r\n     in ideas, in administrative skill.\r\n\r\n     I think man will always lead in affairs of intellect--of reason,\r\n     imagination understanding--he has the bigger brain; but that\r\n     woman will always lead in affairs of emotion--moral, affectional,\r\n     religious--she has the better heart, the truer intuition of the\r\n     right, the lovely, the holy. The literature of women in this\r\n     century is juster, more philanthropic, more religious, than that\r\n     of men. Do you not hear the cry which, in New England, a woman is\r\n     raising in the world's ears against the foul wrong which America\r\n     is working in the world? Do you not hear the echo of that woman's\r\n     voice come over the Atlantic--returned from European shores in\r\n     many a tongue--French, German, Italian, Swedish, Danish, Russian,\r\n     Dutch? How a woman touches the world's heart! because she speaks\r\n     justice, speaks piety, speaks love. What voice is strongest,\r\n     raised in continental Europe, pleading for the oppressed and\r\n     down-trodden? That also is a woman's voice!\r\n\r\n     Well, we want the excellence of man and woman both united;\r\n     intellectual power, knowledge, great ideas--in literature,\r\n     philosophy, theology, ethics--and practical skill; but we want\r\n     something better--the moral, affectional, religious intuition, to\r\n     put justice into ethics, love into theology, piety into science\r\n     and letters. Everywhere in the family, the community, the Church,\r\n     and the State, we want the masculine and feminine element\r\n     co-operating and conjoined. Woman is to correct man's taste, mend\r\n     his morals, excite his affections, inspire his religious\r\n     faculties. Man is to quicken her intellect, to help her will,\r\n     translate her sentiments to ideas, and enact them into righteous\r\n     laws. Man's moral action, at best, is only a sort of general\r\n     human providence, aiming at the welfare of a part, and satisfied\r\n     with achieving the \"greatest good of the greatest number.\"\r\n     Woman's moral action is more like a special human providence,\r\n     acting without general rules, but caring for each particular\r\n     case. We need both of these, the general and the special, to make\r\n     a total human providence.\r\n\r\n     If man and woman are counted equivalent--equal in rights, though\r\n     with diverse powers,--shall we not mend the literature of the\r\n     world, its theology, its science, its laws, and its actions too?\r\n     I can not believe that wealth and want are to stand ever side by\r\n     side as desperate foes; that culture must ride only on the back\r\n     of ignorance; and feminine virtue be guarded by the degradation\r\n     of whole classes of ill-starred men, as in the East, or the\r\n     degradation of whole classes of ill-starred women, as in the\r\n     West; but while we neglect the means of help God puts in our\r\n     power, why, the present must be like the past--\"property\" must be\r\n     theft, \"law\" the strength of selfish will, and\r\n     \"Christianity\"--what we see it is, the apology for every powerful\r\n     wrong.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     To every woman let me say--Respect your nature as a human being,\r\n     your nature as a woman; then respect your rights, then remember\r\n     your duty to possess, to use, to develop, and to enjoy every\r\n     faculty which God has given you, each in its normal way.\r\n\r\n     And to men let me say--Respect, with the profoundest reverence,\r\n     respect the mother that bore you, the sisters who bless you, the\r\n     woman that you love, the woman that you marry. As you seek to\r\n     possess your own manly rights, seek also, by that great arm, by\r\n     that powerful brain, seek to vindicate her rights as woman, as\r\n     your own as man. Then we may see better things in the Church,\r\n     better things in the State, in the Community, in the Home. Then\r\n     the green shall show what buds it hid, the buds shall blossom,\r\n     the flowers bear fruit, and the blessing of God be on us all.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMINISCENCES OF PAULINA WRIGHT DAVIS.\r\n\r\nBY E. C. S.\r\n\r\nHearing that my friend had returned from Europe too ill to leave her\r\nroom, I hastened to her charming home in the suburbs of Providence,\r\nRhode Island. There in her pleasant chamber, bright with the sunshine\r\nof a clear December day,[53] surrounded with her books and pictures of\r\nher own painting, looking out on an extensive lawn, grand old trees,\r\nand the busy city in the distance, we passed three happy days together\r\nreviewing our own lives, the progress of the reforms we advocated, and\r\nin speculations of the unknown world. In my brief sketch of the\r\n\"Woman's Rights Movement\" and its leaders for the \"Eminent Women of\r\nthe Age,\" I made no mention of Mrs. Davis, being ignorant of the main\r\nfacts of her life. I waited for her return from Florida, until it was\r\ntoo late, as the work was hurried to press. Hence I was glad of this\r\nopportunity to dot down fresh from her own lips some of the incidents\r\nand personal experiences of her life.\r\n\r\nPaulina Kellogg was born in Bloomfield, New York, the very day, Capt.\r\nHall delivered up the fort at Detroit. Her father, Capt. Kellogg,\r\nbeing a volunteer in the army at that time, would often jocosely refer\r\nto those two great events on the 7th of August, 1813. Her grandfather\r\nSaxton was a colonel in the Revolution, and on Lafayette's staff. Both\r\nher father and mother possessed great personal beauty, and were\r\ndevotedly attached to each other, and were alike conservative in their\r\nopinions and associations. When Paulina was four years old her\r\ngrandfather bought a large tract of land at Cambria, near Niagara\r\nFalls, where all his children settled. That trip was the first memory\r\nof her childhood. A cavalcade of six army wagons, men, women,\r\nchildren, horses, cattle, dogs, hens, pushed their weary way eleven\r\ndays through wild woods, cutting their own roads, and fording creeks\r\nand rivers. Crossing the Genesee in a scow, one immense cow walked off\r\ninto the water, others followed and swam ashore. The little girl\r\nthinking that everything was going overboard, trembled like an aspen\r\nleaf until she felt herself safe on land. The picnics under the trees,\r\nthe beds in the wagons drawn up in a circle to keep the cattle in, the\r\nfriendly meetings with the Indians, all charmed her childish fancies.\r\nThe summer the first bridge was built to Goat Island, her uncle caught\r\nher in his arms, ran across the beams, and set her down, saying:\r\n\"There, you are probably the first white child that ever set foot on\r\nGoat Island.\"\r\n\r\nWhen seven years old she was adopted by an aunt, and moved to Le Roy,\r\nNew York, where she was educated. Her aunt was a strict orthodox\r\nPresbyterian, a stern, strong Puritan. Her life in her new home was\r\nsad and solitary, and one of constant restraint. In the natural\r\nreaction of the human mind, with such early experiences, we can\r\nreadily account for Paulina's love of freedom, and courage in\r\nattacking the wrongs of society. In referring to these early years,\r\nshe said: \"I was not a happy child, nor a happy woman, until in mature\r\nlife, I outgrew my early religious faith, and felt free to think and\r\nact from my own convictions.\" Having joined the church in extreme\r\nyouth, and being morbidly conscientious, she suffered constant torment\r\nabout her own sins, and those of her neighbors. She was a religious\r\nenthusiast, and in time of revivals was one of the bright and shining\r\nlights in exhortation and prayer.\r\n\r\nShe was roused to thought on woman's position by a discussion in the\r\nchurch as to whether women should be permitted to speak and pray in\r\npromiscuous assemblies. Some of the deacons protested against a\r\npractice, in ordinary times, that might be tolerated during seasons of\r\nrevival. But those who had discovered their gifts in times of\r\nexcitement were not so easily remanded to silence; and thus the Church\r\nwas distracted then as now with the troublesome question of woman's\r\nrights. Sometimes a liberal pastor would accord a latitude denied by\r\nthe elders and deacons, and sometimes one church would be more liberal\r\nthan others in the same neighborhood, or synod; hence individuals and\r\ncongregations were continually persecuted and arraigned for violation\r\nof church discipline and God's law, according to man's narrow\r\ninterpretation. \"Thus,\" she says, \"my mind was confused and uncertain\r\nwith conflicting emotions and opinions in regard to all human\r\nrelations. And it was many years before I understood the philosophy of\r\nlife, before I learned that happiness did not depend on outward\r\nconditions, but on the harmony within, on the tastes, sentiments,\r\naffections, and ambitions of the individual soul.\"\r\n\r\nOn leaving school, Paulina had made up her mind to be a missionary to\r\nthe Sandwich Islands, as that was the Mecca in those days to which all\r\npious young women desired to go. But after five months of ardent\r\ncourtship, Mr. Francis Wright, a young merchant of wealth and position\r\nin Utica, New York, persuaded her that there were heathen enough in\r\nUtica to call out all the religious zeal she possessed, to say nothing\r\nof himself as the chief of sinners, hence in special need of her\r\nministrations.\r\n\r\nSo they began life together, worshiped in Bethel church, and devoted\r\nthemselves to the various reforms that in turn attracted their\r\nattention. They took an active part in the arrangements for the first\r\nAnti-Slavery Convention, held in Utica, Oct. 21, 1835, a day on which\r\nanti-slavery meetings were mobbed and violently dispersed in different\r\nparts of the country. It was at this meeting that Gerrit Smith gave in\r\nhis adhesion to the anti-slavery movement and abandoned the idea of\r\nthe colonization of slaves to Liberia. As the mob would not permit a\r\nmeeting to be held in Utica, Mr. Smith invited them to Peterboro,\r\nwhere they adjourned. It was a fearful day for Abolitionists\r\nthroughout that city, as the mob of roughs was backed by its leading\r\nmen. Mr. Wright's house was surrounded, piazzas and fences torn down\r\nand piled up with wood and hay against it, with the evident intention\r\nof burning it down. But several ladies who had come to attend the\r\nConvention were staying there, and, as was their custom, they had\r\nfamily prayers that night. The leaders of the mob peeping through the\r\nwindows, saw a number of women on their knees, and the sight seemed to\r\nsoften their wrath and change their purpose, for they quietly withdrew\r\ntheir forces, leaving the women in undisturbed possession of the\r\nhouse. The attitude of the Church at this time being strongly\r\npro-slavery, Mr. and Mrs. Wright withdrew, as most Abolitionists did,\r\nfrom all church organizations, and henceforth their religious zeal was\r\nconcentrated on the anti-slavery, temperance, and woman's rights\r\nreforms. Thus passed twelve years of happiness in mutual improvement\r\nand co-operation in every good work. Having no children, they devoted\r\nthemselves unreservedly to one another. But Mr. Wright, being a man of\r\ngreat executive ability, was continually overworking, taxing his\r\npowers of mind and body to the uttermost, until his delicate\r\norganization gave way and his life prematurely ended.\r\n\r\nHaving occupied her leisure hours in the study of anatomy and\r\nphysiology, Mrs. Wright gave a course of lectures to women. As early\r\nas 1844 she began this public work. She imported from Paris the first\r\n_femme modele_ that was ever brought to this country. She tells many\r\namusing anecdotes of the effect of unveiling this manikin in the\r\npresence of a class of ladies. Some trembled with fear, the delicacy\r\nof others was shocked, but their weaknesses were overcome as their\r\nscientific curiosity was awakened. Many of Mrs. Wright's pupils\r\nwere among the first to enter the colleges, hospitals, and\r\ndissecting-rooms, and to become successful practitioners of the\r\nhealing art.\r\n\r\nWhile lecturing in Baltimore, a \"Friend,\" by the name of Anna\r\nNeedles, attended the course. Another \"Friend,\" seeing her frequently\r\npass, hailed her on one occasion, and said, \"Anna, where does thee go\r\nevery day?\" \"I go to hear Mrs. Wright lecture.\" \"What, Anna, does thee\r\ngo to hear that Fanny Wright?\" \"Oh, no! Paulina Wright!\" \"Ah! I warn\r\nthee, do not go near her, she is of the same species.\" Many women, now\r\nsupporting themselves in ease, gratefully acknowledge her influence in\r\ndirecting their lives to some active pursuits.\r\n\r\nThus passed the four years of her widowed life, lecturing to women\r\nthrough most of the Eastern and Western States.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, she was married to the Hon. Thomas Davis, a solid, noble man\r\nof wealth and position, who has since been a member of the Rhode\r\nIsland Legislature seven years, and served one term in Congress. As he\r\nis very modest and retiring in his nature, I will not enumerate his\r\ngood qualities of head and heart, lest he should be pained at seeing\r\nhimself in print; and perhaps \"the highest praise for a true _man_ is\r\nnever to be spoken of at all.\" With several successive summers in\r\nNewport and winters in Providence, Mrs. Davis gave more time to\r\nfashionable society than she ever had at any period of her life.\r\n\r\nWhen her husband was elected to Congress, in 1853, she accompanied him\r\nto Washington and made many valuable acquaintances. As she had already\r\ncalled the first National Woman Suffrage Convention, and started _The\r\nUna_, the first distinctively woman's rights journal ever published,\r\nand was supposed to be a fair representative of the odious,\r\nstrong-minded \"Bloomer,\" the ladies at their hotel, after some\r\nconsultation, decided to ignore her, as far as possible. But a lady of\r\nher fine appearance, attractive manners, and general intelligence,\r\nwhose society was sought by the most cultivated gentlemen in the\r\nhouse, could not be very long ostracised by the ladies.\r\n\r\nWhat a writer in the British Quarterly for January, says of Mrs. John\r\nStuart Mill, applies with equal force to Mrs. Davis. \"She seems to\r\nhave been saved from the coarseness and strenuous tone of the typical\r\nstrong-minded woman, although probably some of her opinions might\r\nshock staid people who are innocent alike of philosophy and the\r\ndoctrines of the new era.\" Though in fact this typical strong-minded\r\nwoman of whom we hear so much in England and America, is after all a\r\n\"myth\"; for the very best specimens of womanhood in both countries are\r\nthose who thoroughly respect themselves, and maintain their political,\r\ncivil, and social rights. For nearly three years Mrs. Davis continued\r\n_The Una_, publishing it entirely at her own expense. It took the\r\nbroadest ground claimed to-day: individual freedom in the State, the\r\nChurch, and the home; woman's equality and suffrage a natural right.\r\nIn 1859, she visited Europe for the first time, and spent a year\r\ntraveling in France, Italy, Austria, and Germany, giving her leisure\r\nhours to picture galleries and the study of art. She made many\r\nvaluable friends on this trip, regained her health, and returned home\r\nto work with renewed zeal for the enfranchisement of woman.\r\n\r\nHaving decided to celebrate the second decade of the National Woman\r\nSuffrage movement, in New York, Mrs. Davis took charge of all the\r\npreliminary arrangements, including the foreign correspondence. She\r\ngave a good report at the opening session of the Convention, of what\r\nhad been accomplished in the twenty years, and published the\r\nproceedings in pamphlet form, at her own expense. One of Mrs. Davis'\r\nfavorite ideas was a Woman's Congress in Washington, to meet every\r\nyear, to consider the national questions demanding popular action;\r\nespecially to present them in their moral and humanitarian bearings\r\nand relations, while our representatives discussed them, as men\r\nusually do, from the material, financial, and statistical points of\r\nview. In this way only, said she, \"can the complete idea on any\r\nquestion ever be realized. All legislation must necessarily be\r\nfragmentary, so long as one-half the race give no thought whatever on\r\nthe subject.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1871, Mrs. Davis, with her niece and adopted daughter, again\r\nvisited Europe, and pursued her studies of art, spending much time in\r\nJulian's life studio, the only one open to women. She took lessons of\r\nCarl Marko in Florence. When in Paris she spent hours every day\r\ncopying in the Louvre and Luxembourg. The walls of her home were\r\ndecorated with many fine copies, and a few of her own creations. Her\r\nenthusiasm for both art and reform may seem to some a singular\r\ncombination; but with her view of life, it was a natural one.\r\nBelieving, as she did, in the realization of the ultimate equality of\r\nthe human family, and the possibility of the race sometime attaining\r\ncomparative perfection, when all would be well-fed, clothed,\r\nsheltered, and educated; humanity in its poverty, ignorance, and\r\ndeformity, were to her but the first rude sketch on the canvas, to be\r\nperfected by the skillful hand of the Great Artist. Hence she labored\r\nwith faith and enthusiasm to realize her ideal alike in both cases.\r\n\r\nIn Naples she made the acquaintance of Mary Somerville, then in her\r\nninetieth year. She found her quite conversant with American affairs,\r\nand she expressed great pleasure in reading Mrs. Davis' history of\r\nthe suffrage movement in this country. There too she met Mrs.\r\nMerrycoyf, a bright, accomplished woman, a sister of Josephine Butler,\r\nand like her, engaged in English reforms. She had many discussions\r\nwith Mrs. Proby, the wife of the English Consul, who thought Mrs.\r\nDavis was wasting her efforts for the elevation of woman, as she\r\nconsidered it a hopeless case to make women rational and self-reliant.\r\nHowever, before they parted, Mrs. Davis inspired her with some faith\r\nin her own sex. I read a very interesting letter from Mrs. Proby\r\nacknowledging the benefit derived from her acquaintance with Mrs.\r\nDavis, in giving her new hope for woman. At Rome she received the\r\nblessing of the Pope, and met Père Hyacinthe and his charming wife,\r\nand attended one of his lectures, but the crowd was so great she could\r\nnot get in, so she went the Sunday after to hear the prayers for the\r\nPope and the Church against the influence of the dangerous Père. She\r\nsays: \"It was a most impressive occasion, the immense crowd, the grand\r\nmusic swelling through the arches of that vast cathedral, the\r\nresponses of the ten thousand voices, rolling like the great tidal\r\nwaves of the mighty ocean, were altogether sublime beyond\r\ndescription.\" At Paris she met Mrs. Crawford, wife of the\r\ncorresponding editor of _The London Times_, a woman of fine\r\nconversational powers, and a brilliant writer, now the Paris\r\ncorrespondent of _The New York Tribune_. She found her a woman of very\r\nliberal opinions. At one of her breakfasts she met Martin, the\r\nhistorian, and several members of the Assembly. She also visited the\r\nCountess Delacoste, who sympathized deeply with the republican\r\nmovement, and had concealed Clusaret three months in her house. There\r\nshe met several distinguished Russians and Frenchmen. In London she\r\nattended one of Mrs. Peter Taylor's receptions, where she met Mrs.\r\nMargaret Lucas, sister of John Bright, and other notables. She visited\r\nJosephine Butler at her home in Liverpool. Friends sent her tickets of\r\nadmission to the lady's gallery, in the House of Commons, where she\r\nheard Jacob Bright make his opening speech on the woman's disability\r\nbill, and Fawcett, the blind member, also on the same bill. And with\r\nall these distinguished people, in different countries, speaking\r\ndifferent languages, she found the same interest in the progressive\r\nideas that had gladdened and intensified her own life.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of May she sailed for America, and reached her home in\r\nsafety, but the disease that had been threatening her for years\r\n(rheumatic gout) began to develop itself, until in the autumn she was\r\nconfined to her room, and unable at times even to walk. It was thus I\r\nfound her in a large arm-chair quietly making all her preparations for\r\nthe sunny land, resigned to stay or to go, to accept the inevitable,\r\nwhatever that might be.[54] As she was an enthusiastic spiritualist,\r\nthe coming journey was not to her an unknown realm, but an inviting\r\nhome where the friends of her earlier days were waiting with glad\r\nhearts to give her tin heavenly welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25] Mercy Otis, born at Barnstable, Mass., September 35, 1728,\r\nmarried James Warren, about 1754. Reference has been made to her\r\ncorrespondence with the eminent men of the Revolution. Aside from her\r\npatriotism, Mrs. Warren was a woman of high literary ability. She\r\nwrote several dramatic and satirical works in 1773, against the\r\nroyalists, which, with two tragedies, were included in a volume of\r\nDramatic and Miscellaneous Poems, published in 1790. She also wrote \"A\r\nHistory of the Rise, Progress, and Termination of the American\r\nRevolution, interspersed with Biographical, Political, and Moral\r\nObservations,\" in three volumes, published in Boston, 1805. Mrs.\r\nWarren lived quite into the present century, dying October 19, 1814.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ellet, \"Queens of Society,\" says: \"In point of influence, Mercy\r\nWarren was the most remarkable woman who lived in the days of the\r\nAmerican Revolution.\"\r\n\r\nRochefoucauld, \"Tour in the United States,\" says: \"Seldom has a woman\r\nin any age acquired such ascendency by the mere force of a powerful\r\nintellect, and her influence continued through her life.\"\r\n\r\nGenerals Lee and Gates were among her correspondents; Knox wrote: \"I\r\nshould be happy to receive your counsels from time to time.\" Mrs.\r\nWashington was frequently entertained by Mrs. Warren, at one time when\r\nthe former was in Massachusetts with the General, Mrs. Warren going\r\nwith her chariot to headquarters at Cambridge for her.\r\n\r\n[26] Dried leaves of the raspberry.--LOSSING.\r\n\r\n[27] Lossing, \"Field-Book of the Revolution,\" says: \"On February 9,\r\n1769, the Mistresses of three hundred families met and formed a\r\nleague, and upon the second day the young ladies assembled in great\r\nnumbers, signing the following covenant: 'We, the daughters of those\r\npatriots who have, and do now, appear for public interest, and in\r\nproper regard for their posterity as such, do, with pleasure, engage\r\nwith them in denying ourselves the drink of foreign tea, in hopes to\r\nfrustrate a plan which tends to deprive a whole country of all that is\r\nvaluable in life.\"\r\n\r\n[28] Lossing's \"Field-Book of the Revolution\" states that on the 12th\r\nof June, 1769, the \"Daughters of Liberty,\" met at the house of pastor\r\nMoorehead, in such numbers that in one afternoon they spun two hundred\r\nand ninety skeins of fine yarn, which they presented to him. After\r\nsupper they were joined by many \"Sons of Liberty,\" who united with the\r\n\"Daughters\" in patriotic songs.\r\n\r\n[29] These girls, then only about twelve and fourteen years of age,\r\nsaw the enemy making preparations to land at an isolated point. No men\r\nwere near to defend the place, or to whom warning could be given. A\r\nbright thought struck one of the girls. Accustomed to play the drum,\r\nshe well knew how to beat the call to arms, and no sooner had this\r\nthought entered her mind, than she began a tattoo, calling her sister\r\nto take the fife as an accompaniment. Together they marched toward the\r\nshore, careful to keep hidden by the rocks, among whose intricacies\r\nthey wound back and forth, the sound of their instruments falling upon\r\nthe enemy's ears, now far, now near, as though a force of many hundred\r\nmen was marching down upon them, and thoroughly frightened, they beat\r\na retreat to their boats.\r\n\r\n[30] \"This dispute infused its spirit into everything. It interfered\r\nwith the levy of troops for the Pequot war; it influenced the respect\r\nshown to the magistrates, the distribution of town lots, the\r\nassessment of rates, and at last the continued existence of the two\r\nparties was considered inconsistent with the public peace.\"--Bancroft,\r\n\"History of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n[31] _Atlantic Monthly_, June, 1871.\r\n\r\n[32] In three New England colonies church membership was required for\r\nthe franchise.--Frothingham, \"Rise of the Republic.\"\r\n\r\n[33] Dr. John Weis, of New York, now an aged gentleman, well remembers\r\nhis grandmother saying, that at an early day women were allowed to\r\nvote in all the New England colonies.\r\n\r\n[34] Mother of the late Daniel P.

Sholes' report.\r\n\r\nThe earliest settlement of Indiana was a missionary one, in 1777,\r\nthough it was not admitted as a Territory until 1800, then including\r\nthe present States of Michigan and Illinois. A number of Indian wars\r\ntook place in this part of the country during the twenty-five years\r\nbetween 1780 and 1805. What was known as the Northwest Territory was\r\norganized in 1789, and General Arthur St. Clair appointed Governor, an\r\noffice he held until 1802. In 1790 a war of unusually formidable\r\ncharacter broke out among the Indian tribes of the Northwest, and in\r\n1791, St. Clair was created General-in-Chief of the forces against\r\nthem. Many of the settlers of this portion of the country joined his\r\narmy, among whom were one hundred women, who accompanied their\r\nhusbands in preference to being left at home subject to the surprises\r\nand tortures of the savages with whom the country was at war. In\r\ngiving command of these forces to St. Clair, Washington warned him\r\nagainst unexpected assaults from the enemy; but this general who was\r\nof foreign birth, a Scotchman, was no match for the cunning of his\r\nwily foe, who suddenly fell upon him, November 4th, near the Miami\r\nvillages (present site of Terra Haute), making great havoc among his\r\nforces.\r\n\r\nWhen, the terrible war-whoop was heard, the heroism of these hundred\r\nwomen rose equal to the emergency. They did not cling helplessly to\r\ntheir husbands--the women of those early days were made of sterner\r\nstuff--but with pale, set faces, they joined in the defense, and the\r\nrecords say, were most of them killed fighting bravely. They died a\r\nsoldier's death upon the field of battle in defense of home and\r\ncountry. They died that the prairies of the West and the wilderness of\r\nthe North should at a later period become the peaceful homes of untold\r\nmillions of men and women. They were the true pioneers of the\r\nNorthwest, the advance-guard of civilization, giving their lives in\r\nbattle against a terrible enemy, in order that safety should dwell at\r\nthe hearth-stones of those who should settle this garden of the\r\ncontinent at a future period. History is very silent upon their\r\nrecord; not a name has been preserved; but we do know that they lived,\r\nand how they died, and it is but fitting that a record of woman's work\r\nfor freedom should embalm their memory in its pages. Many other women\r\ndefended homes and children against the savage foe, but their deeds of\r\nheroism have been forgotten.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely a portion of the world so far from civilization as\r\nIndiana was at that day. No railroads spanned the continent, making\r\nneighbors of people a thousand miles apart; no steamboat sailed upon\r\nthe Western lakes, nor indeed upon the broad Atlantic; telegraphy,\r\nwith its annihilation of space, was a marvel as yet unborn; even the\r\nLucifer match, which should kindle fire in the twinkling of an eye,\r\nlay buried in the dark future. Little was known of these settlements;\r\nthe Genesee Valley of New York was considered the _far West_, to which\r\npeople traveled (the Erie Canal was not then in existence) in strong,\r\nspring less wagons, over which large hoops, covered with white cloth,\r\nwere securely fastened, thus sheltering the inmates from sun and\r\nstorm. These wagons, afterward known as \"Prairie Schooners,\" were for\r\nweeks and months the traveling homes of many a family of early\r\nsettlers.\r\n\r\nBut even in 1816 Indiana could boast her domestic manufactures, for\r\nwithin the State at this time were \"two thousand five hundred and\r\ntwelve looms and two thousand seven hundred spinning-wheels, most of\r\nthem in private cabins, whose mistresses, by their slow agencies,\r\nconverted the wool which their own hands had often sheared, and the\r\nflax which their own fingers had pulled, into cloth for the family\r\nwardrobe.\"[55]\r\n\r\nThus in 1816 the manufactures of Indiana were chiefly in the hands of\r\nits women. It is upon the industries of the country that a nation\r\nthrives. Its manufactures build up its commerce and make its wealth.\r\nFrom this source the Government derives the revenue which is the\r\nlife-blood circulating in its veins. Its strength and its perpetuity\r\nalike depend upon its industries, and when we look upon the work of\r\nwomen through all the years of the Republic, and remember their\r\npatriotic self-devotion and self-sacrifice at every important crisis,\r\nwe are no less amazed at the ingratitude of the country for their\r\nservices in war than at its non-recognition of their existence as\r\nwealth-producers, the elements which build up and sustain every\r\ncivilized people.\r\n\r\nViewing its early record, we are not surprised that Indiana claims to\r\nhave organized the first State Woman's Rights Society, though we are\r\nsomewhat astonished to know that at the time of the first Convention\r\nheld in Indianapolis, a husband of position locked his wife within the\r\nhouse in order to prevent her presence thereat, although doubtless, as\r\nmen have often done before and since, he deemed it not out of the way\r\nthat he himself should be a listener at a meeting he considered it\r\ncontrary to family discipline that his wife should attend.\r\n\r\nDecember 11, 1816, Indiana was admitted into the Union. William\r\nHenry Harrison, who had been Governor of the Territory, and\r\nBrigadier-General in the army, with the command of the Northwest\r\nTerritory, was afterward President of the United States. He\r\nencountered the Indians led by Tecumseh at Tippecanoe, on the Wabash,\r\nand after a terrible battle they fled. This was the origin of the\r\nsong, \"Tippecanoe and Tyler too,\" that was sung with immense effect by\r\nthe Whigs all over the country in the presidential campaign of 1840,\r\nwhen Harrison and Tyler were the candidates; and when women, for the\r\nfirst time, attended political meetings.\r\n\r\nIndiana, though one of the younger States, by her liberal and rational\r\nlegislation on the questions of marriage and divorce, has always been\r\nthe land of freedom for fugitives from the bondage and suffering of\r\nill-assorted unions. Many an unhappy wife has found a safe asylum on\r\nthe soil of that State. Her liberality on this question was no doubt\r\npartly due to the influence of Robert Owen, who early settled at New\r\nHarmony, and made the experiment of communal life; and later, to his\r\nson, the Hon. Robert Dale Owen, who was in the Legislature several\r\nyears, and in the Constitutional Convention of 1850. The following\r\nletter from Mr. Owen gives a few facts worth perusing:\r\n\r\n                                   LAKE GEORGE, N. Y., _Sept. 20, 1876_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR MISS ANTHONY:--I know you will think the reply I am about to\r\n     make to your favor of September 18th unsatisfactory, but it is\r\n     the best I can do.\r\n\r\n     1. As regards Frances Wright: All the particulars regarding her\r\n     and her noble but unsuccessful experiment at Nashoba, near\r\n     Memphis, which I thought it important to make public, are\r\n     contained in an article of mine entitled \"An Earnest Sowing of\r\n     Wild Oats,\" in the _Atlantic Monthly_ for July, 1874.\r\n\r\n     2. As to Ernestine L. Rose, I think it probable that you know\r\n     more of her than I do. I remember that she was the daughter of a\r\n     Polish rabbi; the wife of William Rose, a silversmith; and that\r\n     she came with her husband to this country at an early day. She\r\n     was a great admirer and follower of my father, Robert Owen, and\r\n     was a skeptic as to any future beyond the grave; greatly opposed\r\n     to Spiritualism.\r\n\r\n     3. As to my action in the Indiana Legislature: I was a member of\r\n     that body during the sessions of 1836-'7, and '8, and in 1851,\r\n     but I have not the materials here that would enable me to give\r\n     particulars. In a general way I had the State law so altered that\r\n     a married woman owned and had the right to manage her own\r\n     property, both real and personal; and I had the law of descents\r\n     so changed that a widow, instead of dower, which is a mere\r\n     tenancy or life interest, now has, in all cases, an absolute fee\r\n     in one-third of her husband's estate; if only one child, then a\r\n     half; and if no children, I think two-thirds. I also had an\r\n     additional clause added to the divorce law, making two years'\r\n     habitual drunkenness imperative cause for divorce.\r\n\r\n     I took no action in regard to suffrage while in the Legislature.\r\n     In those days it would have been utterly unavailing.\r\n\r\n     All this is very meagre, which I the more regret, sympathizing as\r\n     I do with the object you have in view.\r\n\r\n     Give my kindest regards to my old friend, Mrs. Stanton, and\r\n     believe me,\r\n\r\n                                         Faithfully your friend,\r\n     MISS ANTHONY.                                  ROBERT DALE OWEN.\r\n\r\nBefore 1828, Frances Wright had visited Mr. Owen's colony, and\r\nassisted him in the editorial department of the _New Harmony Gazette_,\r\nchanged afterward to the _Free Enquirer_, published in New York. Such\r\na circle of remarkably intelligent and liberal-minded people, all\r\neffective speakers and able writers, was not without influence in\r\nmoulding the sentiment of that young community. As a glimpse into the\r\ndomestic life of this remarkable family may be interesting to the\r\nreader, we give a pleasing sketch from the pen of Mr. Owen's daughter.\r\nNo monument of the whitest parian marble could shed such honor on the\r\nmemory of a venerated father and mother as this tribute from an\r\naffectionate, appreciative child:\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT DALE OWEN AND MARY ROBINSON.\r\n\r\nBY ROSAMOND DALE OWEN.\r\n\r\nSome fifty years ago a large audience was gathered in one of the\r\npublic halls of New York listening to a lecture. In the sea of faces\r\nupturned to him, the speaker read a cold response, the opinions he was\r\nexpounding being exceedingly unpopular, and rarely expressed in those\r\ndays. The theme was the equality of the sexes, the right of woman to\r\ncontrol person and property in the marriage relation, the right to\r\nbreathe, to think, to act as an untrammeled citizen, the co-equal of\r\nman. His eyes searched tier after tier, seeking in vain for that\r\nmagnetism of sympathy which is as wine to a man who stands before his\r\npeople pleading with them that he may save them from their errors.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his wandering gaze was arrested by a face, a child's face,\r\nwith short, clustering curls, but a strong soul steadied the deep\r\neyes, and on the rounded cheek paled and glowed the earnestness of a\r\nwoman's searching thought. His words grew clear and strong as he\r\nlooked into the upturned eyes, as he answered the listening face. The\r\nspeaker was Robert Dale Owen; the hearer, Mary Robinson.\r\n\r\nThat night when she reached her own room, Mary Robinson flung off\r\nbonnet and shawl with a swift gesture, and, slipping into her\r\naccustomed seat, gazed at the steady-glowing background of coals, with\r\nthe blue flames licking in and out like the evil tongues of\r\nfire-scourged elves. A strong excitement held her in thrall; she did\r\nnot seem to see her elder sister's wondering looks; she did not seem\r\nto hear the great clocks, far and near, chiming out eleven, and then\r\ntwelve, with that deep resonance which sounds in the silence of the\r\nnight like a solemn requiem over lost hours. Presently she became\r\naware that her sister was kneeling beside her, with anxious\r\nquestioning look; she seemed, this elder sister, in her long, white\r\nnight-dress, with pale, straight hair pushed back from the\r\nclear-tinted, oval face, like a youthful Madonna, and Mary drawing the\r\ngentle face close to her own with sudden impulse, said: \"I have seen\r\nthe man I shall marry, I have seen him to-night; he is the homeliest\r\nman I have ever known, but if I am married at all, he is to be my\r\nhusband.\"\r\n\r\nA few months later this prophecy was verified. On the 12th day of\r\nApril, 1832, Robert Dale Owen and Mary Robinson were joined in those\r\nsacred bonds, which, in every true marriage, can be broken only by the\r\nshadow hand of Death. The ceremony was simple and unique; it consisted\r\nin signing a document written by the bridegroom himself, with a\r\nJustice of the Peace and the immediate family as witnesses. The\r\nfollowing extracts will show the character of the compact:\r\n\r\n                                   NEW YORK, Tuesday, _April 12, 1832_.\r\n\r\n     This afternoon I enter into a matrimonial engagement with Mary\r\n     Jane Robinson, a young person whose opinions on all important\r\n     subjects, whose mode of thinking and feeling, coincide more\r\n     intimately with my own than do those of any other individual with\r\n     whom I am acquainted.... We have selected the simplest ceremony\r\n     which the laws of this State recognize.... This ceremony involves\r\n     not the necessity of making promises regarding that over which\r\n     we have no control, the state of human affections in the distant\r\n     future, nor of repeating forms which we deem offensive, inasmuch\r\n     as they outrage the principles of human liberty and equality, by\r\n     conferring rights and imposing duties unequally on the sexes. The\r\n     ceremony consists of a simply written contract in which we agree\r\n     to take each other as husband and wife according to the laws of\r\n     the State of New York, our signatures being attested by those\r\n     friends who are present.\r\n\r\n     Of the unjust rights which in virtue of this ceremony an\r\n     iniquitous law tacitly gives me over the person and property of\r\n     another, I can not legally, but I can morally divest myself. And\r\n     I hereby distinctly and emphatically declare that I consider\r\n     myself, and earnestly desire to be considered by others, as\r\n     utterly divested, now and during the rest of my life, of any such\r\n     rights, the barbarous relics of a feudal, despotic system, soon\r\n     destined, in the onward course of improvement, to be wholly swept\r\n     away; and the existence of which is a tacit insult to the good\r\n     sense and good feeling of this comparatively civilized age.\r\n\r\n     I concur in this sentiment,                  ROBERT DALE OWEN.\r\n\r\n          MARY JANE ROBINSON.\r\n\r\nAfter a wedding tour in Europe, the young couple returning to America,\r\nsettled in New Harmony, Indiana, a small Western village, where their\r\nfather, Robert Owen, had been making experiments in Community life.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange, new world into which these two young creatures were\r\nentering. The husband had passed his youth in a well-ordered, wealthy\r\nEnglish household; the wife had passed the greater part of her\r\ngirlhood in Virginia, among slaves. They were now thrown upon the\r\ncrudities of Western life, and encountered those daily wearing trials\r\nwhich strain the marriage tie to the utmost, even though it be based\r\nupon principles of justice. But there was a reserve of energy and\r\nendurance in this delicately reared pair; they felt themselves to be\r\npioneers in every sense of the word, and the animus which sustains\r\nmany a struggling soul seeking to turn a principle into a living\r\nreality, sustained these two.\r\n\r\nWe of a later civilization can scarcely realize the strain upon women\r\nin those earlier days. The housekeepers of New Harmony were obliged to\r\nbuy their groceries in bulk, and have them shipped by slow stages from\r\nCincinnati; meat was bought from the surrounding farmers, a quarter of\r\na beef at a time, to be cut up and disposed of by the housewife;\r\nvegetables and most of the small fruits could not be bought at all;\r\nstoves were an unknown luxury, all cooking being done in huge\r\nfire-places or brick ovens.\r\n\r\nFor thirty years my father and mother labored with unabated energy;\r\nhis work leading him into the highways of public affairs, while her\r\nway lay through the by-paths of home and village life.\r\n\r\nThrough these thirty years my father used such influence as he had on\r\nthe side of the weak and oppressed. In the matter of procuring a more\r\nrespectful consideration of the property rights of women, he was a\r\npioneer. To attempt a detailed statement of the amelioration of those\r\nlegal hardships under which women labored, is beyond the scope or\r\npurpose of this article. I will only mention, in brief, the more\r\nimportant provisions he was instrumental in passing in the face of\r\nridicule and violent opposition. These amendments were: The abolition\r\nof simple dower, giving to widows instead, a fee simple interest;\r\nprocuring for women the right to their own earnings; abolishing\r\ntenancy by courtesy, which, in effect, made the husband the\r\nbeneficiary of the wife's lands, and in several matters of less\r\nradical change rectifying, so far as he could, the injustice of the\r\ncommon law toward widows; always keeping in view, however, the proper\r\nheirship of children of a former marriage, and guarding the rights of\r\ncreditors.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of the divorce laws of Indiana, my father has not taken\r\nas prominent a part as is generally supposed. These laws were referred\r\nto him in conjunction with another member of the Legislature for the\r\nrevision, and they amended them in a single point, namely: by adding\r\nto the causes for divorce \"habitual drunkenness for two years.\" My\r\nfather has expressed himself in full on this point in a discussion\r\nbetween Horace Greeley and himself, first published in the _New York\r\nTribune_.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1828, my father advocated an equal position for woman,\r\npublishing these views through _The Free Enquirer_, a weekly paper\r\nedited by Frances Wright and himself in New York.\r\n\r\nMy father's political life comprised several terms in the Legislature\r\nof his own State, being elected in 1850 a member of the Convention\r\nwhich amended the Constitution of Indiana, and chairman of its\r\nRevision Committee. The debates in this Convention show the difference\r\nin the position of my father and his antagonists.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CONSTITUTIONAL DEBATES.\r\n\r\n     Mr. OWEN: No subject of greater importance has come up since we\r\n     met here, as next in estimation to the right of enjoying life and\r\n     liberty, our Constitution enumerates the right of acquiring,\r\n     possessing, protecting property. And these sections refer to the\r\n     latter right, heretofore declared to be natural, inherent,\r\n     inalienable, yet virtually withheld from one-half the citizens of\r\n     our State. Women are not represented in our legislative halls;\r\n     they have no voice in selecting those who make laws and\r\n     constitutions for them; and one reason given for excluding women\r\n     from the right of suffrage, is an expression of confident belief\r\n     that their husbands and fathers will surely guard their\r\n     interests. I should like, for the honor of my sex, to believe\r\n     that the legal rights of women are, at all times, as zealously\r\n     guarded as they would be if women had votes to give to those who\r\n     watch over their interests.\r\n\r\n     Suffer me, sir, in defense of my skepticism on this point, to lay\r\n     before you and this Convention, an item from my legislative\r\n     recollection.\r\n\r\n     It will be thirteen years next winter, since I reported from a\r\n     seat just over the way, a change in the then existing law of\r\n     descent. At that time the widow of an intestate dying without\r\n     children, was entitled, under ordinary circumstances, to dower in\r\n     her husband's real estate, and one-third of his personal\r\n     property. The change proposed was to give her one-third of the\r\n     real estate of her husband absolutely, and two-thirds of his\r\n     personal property--far too little, indeed; but yet as great an\r\n     innovation as we thought we could carry. This law remained in\r\n     force until 1841. How stands it now? The widow of an intestate,\r\n     in case there be no children, and in case there be father, or\r\n     mother, or brother, or sister of the husband, is heir to no part\r\n     whatever of her deceased husband's real estate; she is entitled\r\n     to dower only, of one-third of his estate. I ask you whether your\r\n     hearts do not revolt at the idea, that when the husband is\r\n     carried to his long home, his widow shall see snatched from her,\r\n     by an inhuman law, the very property her watchful care had mainly\r\n     contributed to increase and keep together?\r\n\r\n     Yet this idea, revolting as it is, is carried out in all its\r\n     unmitigated rigor, by the statute to which I have just referred.\r\n     Out of a yearly rental of a hundred and fifty dollars, the widow\r\n     of an intestate rarely becomes entitled to more than fifty. The\r\n     other hundred dollars goes--whither? To the husband's father or\r\n     mother? Yes, if they survive! But if they are dead, what then? A\r\n     brother-in-law or a sister-in-law takes it, or the husband's\r\n     uncle, or his aunt, or his cousin! Do husbands toil through a\r\n     life-time to support their aunts, and uncles, and cousins? If but\r\n     a single cousin's child, a babe of six months, survive, to that\r\n     infant goes a hundred dollars of the rental, and to the widow\r\n     fifty. Can injustice go beyond this? What think you of a law like\r\n     that, on the statute book of a civilized and a Christian land?\r\n     When the husband's sustaining arm is laid in the grave, and the\r\n     widow left without a husband to cherish, then comes the law more\r\n     cruel than death, and decrees that poverty shall be added to\r\n     desolation!\r\n\r\n     Say, delegates of the people of Indiana, answer and say whether\r\n     you, whether those who sent you here are guiltless in this thing?\r\n     Have you done justice? Have you loved mercy?\r\n\r\n     But let us turn to the question more immediately before us. Let\r\n     us pass from the case of the widow and look to that of the wife:\r\n     First, the husband becomes entitled, from the instant of\r\n     marriage, to all the goods and chattels of his wife. His right is\r\n     absolute, unconditional. Secondly, the husband acquires, in\r\n     virtue of the marriage, the rents and profits (in all cases\r\n     during her life) of his wife's real estate. The flagrant\r\n     injustice of this has been somewhat modified by a statute barring\r\n     the marital right to the rent of lands, but this protection does\r\n     not extend to personal property. Is this as it should be? Are we\r\n     meting out fair and equal justice?... There is a species of very\r\n     silly sentimentalism which it is the fashion to put forth in\r\n     after-dinner toasts and other equally veracious forms, about\r\n     woman being the only tyrant in a free republic; about the chains\r\n     she imposes on her willing slaves, etc.; it would be much more to\r\n     our credit, if we would administer a little less flattery and a\r\n     little more justice.\r\n\r\nFrom pages upon pages of eloquence delivered in reply, I cull the\r\nfollowing extracts, which are a sample of the spirit of the\r\nopposition:\r\n\r\n     \"I am of opinion that to adopt the proposition of the gentleman\r\n     from Posey (Mr. Owen), will not ameliorate the condition of\r\n     married women.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I can not see the propriety of establishing for women a distinct\r\n     and separate interest, the consideration of which would, of\r\n     necessity, withdraw their attention from that sacred duty which\r\n     nature has, in its wisdom, assigned to their peculiar care. I\r\n     think the law which unites in one common bond the pecuniary\r\n     interests of husband and wife should remain. The sacred ordinance\r\n     of marriage, and the relations growing out of it, should not be\r\n     disturbed. The common law does seem to me to afford sufficient\r\n     protection.\"\r\n\r\n     \"If the law is changed, I believe that a most essential injury\r\n     would result to the endearing relations of married life.\r\n     Controversies would arise, husbands and wives would become armed\r\n     against each other, to the utter destruction of true felicity in\r\n     married life.\"\r\n\r\n     \"To adopt it would be to throw a whole population morally and\r\n     politically into confusion. Is it necessary to explode a volcano\r\n     under the foundation of the family union?\"\r\n\r\n     \"I object to the gentleman's proposition, because it is in\r\n     contravention of one of the great fundamental principles of the\r\n     Christian religion. The common law only embodies the divine law.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Give to the wife a separate interest in law, and all those high\r\n     motives to restrain the husband from wrong-doing will be, in a\r\n     great degree, removed.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I firmly believe that it would diminish, if it did not totally\r\n     annihilate woman's influence.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Woman's power comes through a self-sacrificing spirit, ready to\r\n     offer up all her hopes upon the shrine of her husband's wishes.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Sir, we have got along for eighteen hundred years, and shall we\r\n     change now? Our fathers have for many generations maintained the\r\n     principle of the common law in this regard, for some good and\r\n     weighty reasons.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The immortal Jefferson, writing in reference to the then state\r\n     of society in France, and the debauched condition thereof,\r\n     attributes the whole to the effects of the civil law then in\r\n     force in France, permitting the wife to hold, acquire, and own\r\n     property, separate and distinct from the husband.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The females of this State are about as happy and contented with\r\n     their present position in relation to this right (suffrage), as\r\n     it is necessary they should be, and I do not favor the\r\n     proposition (of Woman's Suffrage), which my friend from Posey,\r\n     Mr. Owen, appears to countenance.\"\r\n\r\n     \"It is not because I love justice less, but woman more, that I\r\n     oppose this section.\"\r\n\r\n     \"This doctrine of separate estate will stifle all the finer\r\n     feelings, blast the brightest, fairest, happiest hopes of the\r\n     human family, and go in direct contravention of that law which\r\n     bears the everlasting impress of the Almighty Hand. Sir, I\r\n     consider such a scheme not only as wild, but as wicked, if not in\r\n     its intentions, at least in its results.\"\r\n\r\nIt is incredible that men in their sane minds should argue day after\r\nday, that if women were allowed to control their own property, it\r\nwould \"strike at the root of Christianity,\" \"ruin the home,\" and \"open\r\nwide the door to license and debauchery.\" And yet these men did so\r\nargue through weeks of stormy debate; the bitterest feeling being\r\nshown, not with regard to the proposed change in the law of descent,\r\nbut with regard to the right of women to \"acquire and possess property\r\nto their sole use and disposal,\" during the husband's life-time. It is\r\nstrange, indeed, that the man who advocated this \"most meagre\r\njustice,\" as he truly says, should have been a target, not only for\r\nridicule, but for abuse. I append one extract of the latter\r\ndescription, to illustrate how violent and unreasoning was the\r\nprejudice with which my father contended. One gentleman after quoting\r\nfrom the marriage contract of my father and mother, the extract in\r\nwhich he, my father, divests himself of the right to control the\r\n\"person and property of another,\" proceeds as follows:\r\n\r\n     Sir, I would that my principles on this, in contradistinction\r\n     with those of the gentlemen from Posey, were written in\r\n     characters of light across the noon-day heavens, that all the\r\n     world might read them. (Applause). I have in my drawer numerous\r\n     other extracts from the writings of the gentleman from Posey, but\r\n     am not allowed to read them; and, indeed, sir, under the\r\n     circumstances, decency forbids their use. But if I were permitted\r\n     to read them, and show their worse than damning influence upon\r\n     society, in conjunction with this system of separate interests, I\r\n     venture to aver that gentlemen would turn from them with disgust;\r\n     aye, sir, they would shun them as they would shun man's worst\r\n     enemy, and flee from them as from a poisonous reptile. (Page\r\n     1161, \"Debates in Indiana Convention\").\r\n\r\nThe section was finally reconsidered and rejected a few days before\r\nadjournment (p. 2013). But my father, with his characteristic\r\nperseverance, continued his efforts until they were finally crowned\r\nwith success in the Legislature, after fifteen years of endeavor.\r\n\r\nMost of the arguments used by those delegates, if they can be called\r\nby so dignified a name, bear a singular resemblance to the arguments\r\nused to-day by the opponents of woman's suffrage. May we not then\r\nconclude that the fears which have been proved absolutely groundless\r\nin the one case, may be equally so in the other?\r\n\r\nAn enthusiastic public meeting was held in Indianapolis in honor of my\r\nfather by the women of the State, Mrs. Sarah T. Bolton taking a\r\nprominent part. On this occasion a beautiful silver pitcher was\r\npresented to him as a token of gratitude for his persevering efforts\r\nin behalf of women. This pitcher still holds a place of honor in our\r\nfamily dinings on gala days.\r\n\r\nIn reply to several slurs in regard to this memorial, my father during\r\nthe debates in the Convention thus retorted:\r\n\r\n     Since I have had occasion to allude to the testimonial which it\r\n     is proposed to offer me on behalf of the women of my adopted\r\n     State, I will say here, that regarding it as the greatest\r\n     compliment--if in so grave a connection a word often so lightly\r\n     used may be properly employed--the greatest compliment I ever\r\n     received in my life, or ever can receive till I die: it matters\r\n     little to me what may be said of myself in that connection; I am\r\n     accustomed to personal attack, and am proof against ridicule. But\r\n     if any man, whether he disgrace a chair on this floor, or\r\n     dishonor by his presence some of the bar-rooms of the city, utter\r\n     an insinuation, cast a reproach, directly or indirectly, by open\r\n     assertion, or covert insinuation, against the motives or the\r\n     character of those courageous women who may have met in\r\n     Lawrenceburg or elsewhere, to consult regarding rights shamefully\r\n     denied to them, or those who may have publicly expressed\r\n     gratitude to the defenders of these rights--if such a man there\r\n     be, within or without the walls of this capitol, I say here of\r\n     such a one, let him receive it as he will, that I would give my\r\n     hand more freely to the inmate of the penitentiary than to him.\r\n     (Page 1185, \"Debates in Indiana Convention\").\r\n\r\nIn 1843 and 1845 my father was elected to Congress, serving until\r\n1847. In 1853 he was appointed Minister to Naples, remaining there\r\nuntil 1858. During the war his exertions were unremitting. He was the\r\nfriend of Governor Morton, and was consulted by that energetic\r\nstatesman in all his more important plans. He wrote several letters on\r\nthe political crises of the time, which had a wide circulation and\r\ninfluence. Mr. Lincoln said to several of his friends, that a letter\r\naddressed to him by Mr. Owen, and a conversation consequent thereon,\r\nhad done more toward deciding him in favor of the Emancipation\r\nProclamation, than any other influence which had been brought to bear.\r\nMy father also made strenuous efforts during the winter of 1865-'66 to\r\npostpone the enfranchisement of the freedmen ten years, until 1876.\r\n(See _Atlantic Monthly_, June, 1875). Subsequent events have shown his\r\njudgment to have been correct and far-sighted. He believed the\r\nconferring of suffrage upon the negro, dim-visioned in the sudden\r\nlight of a new liberty, to be a most dangerous experiment; he foresaw\r\nthat the ballot which the North gave to them as a protection against\r\ntheir arrogant masters, would prove a two-edged sword with a terrible\r\nreactionary force in the hands of an untrained race just freed from\r\nmental leading-strings; he knew the difficulty to be inherent, a\r\ndifficulty which the existence of slavery must necessarily have\r\nproduced. He maintained that although the sword had struck off the\r\noutward chains, the white-heat of ire kindled in the hearts of the\r\nconquered had not fused the inward shackles of the slave, but had\r\nriveted them the firmer, and that the invisible fetters welded by\r\nrevengeful hate should be broken most carefully.\r\n\r\nIn the latter years of his life my father gave his entire attention to\r\nthe study of Modern Spiritualism, or rather to the study of\r\nSpiritualism in both its ancient and its modern phases. He published\r\ntwo works on this subject, \"Footfalls on the Boundary of Another\r\nWorld,\" and \"The Debatable Land between this World and the Next.\" In a\r\nletter written shortly before his death, he expresses himself as\r\nfollows: \"I hope, my child, that you will never, at any period of your\r\nlife, be less happy than you now are. If you cultivate your spiritual\r\nnature rationally, I feel assured you never will. For one effect of\r\nrational Spiritualism is to make one more satisfied the longer one\r\nlives, and to make the last scenes of life, hours of pleasant\r\nanticipation, instead of a season of dread, or, as with many it has\r\nbeen, of horror.\" It would be well for non-investigators who maintain\r\nthat my father's belief in Spiritualism necessarily proves him to have\r\nbeen illogical, to see to it that they are not falling into the\r\ninconsequence which they are ascribing to him. Reasoning _a priori_,\r\nshould we not believe that the man who saw so clearly the dangers\r\nwhich were unperceived by some of our keenest statesmen, could not\r\nbecome, except in a rare instance and for a short time, a misled dupe?\r\nHas any one the right to condemn such a man unproved?\r\n\r\nWhile my father was exerting his energies for the welfare of the\r\nnation, my mother was giving her life to her children. Sons and\r\ndaughters were welcomed into the Owen homestead, and the wide halls\r\nand great rooms of the rambling country house rang with the voices of\r\nchildren. Three of these little ones slipped back to Heaven before the\r\nportals had closed. The stricken parents with blinded eyes met only\r\nthe rayless emptiness of unbelief. May God help the mother, fainting\r\nbeneath a bereavement greater than she can bear, who cries for help\r\nand finds none; who stretches her empty arms upward in an agony of\r\nappeal and is answered by the hollow echo of her own cry; may God help\r\nher, for she is beyond the help of man. Other children came to fill\r\nthe vacant places, other voices filled the air, but the hearts of\r\nfather and mother were not filled until years later, when a sweet\r\nfaith thrilled the hopeless blank.\r\n\r\nThe story of these two is the story of many beside. Husband and wife\r\nbegan the long journey side by side with equal talent, hope, energy;\r\nhis work led him along the high-road, hers lay in a quiet nook; his\r\nname became world-known, hers was scarcely heard beyond the precinct\r\nof her own village; and yet who can say that his life was the more\r\nsuccessful, who can say that the quiet falling rain, with its slow\r\nresultant of flower and fruit in each little garden nook, is less\r\nimportant than the mighty ship-laden river bearing its wealth of\r\ncommerce in triumph to the sea?\r\n\r\nGeorge Eliot, in \"Middlemarch,\" says of Dorothea:\r\n\r\n     Her finely-touched spirit had its fine issues, though they were\r\n     not widely visible.... The effect of her being on those around\r\n     her was incalculably diffusive; for the growing good of the world\r\n     is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not\r\n     so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to\r\n     the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in\r\n     unvisited tombs.\r\n\r\nThis is true of many Dorotheas; it is true of the Dorothea of whom I\r\nam writing. Geographically, Mary Owen's field of labor was narrow; but\r\na small Western village of a thousand souls may hold within its\r\nethical strata all the developments of a continent. Let her who feels\r\nthat her small limits imprison her, remember that emotions are not\r\nregistered by the census. Lovers and business men, struggling youths\r\nand perplexed mothers, children and veterans, poured their griefs and\r\nfears, their hopes and disappointments, into the listening ear of\r\nsympathy, knowing that the clear judgment of this little woman could\r\nunravel much that seemed to be in hopeless entanglement.\r\n\r\nWell do I remember the cheer of this our home. Simple were its duties,\r\nsimple indeed its pleasures. Well do I remember the busy troop of boys\r\nand girls, with the busy mother at their head, directing their\r\nexuberant energy with a rare administrative ability. Besides her own\r\nchildren, four of whom reached maturity, she took during her life\r\nseven other young people under her protection, so that the great\r\nold-fashioned house was always filled to overflowing with fresh young\r\nlife. Pasture and stable, hennery and dairy, yard and garden, kitchen\r\nand parlor, all were under her immediate guidance and control. Well do\r\nI remember the pots of golden butter, fresh from her cool hand; the\r\ndelicious hams cured under her supervision; the succulent vegetables\r\nand juicy fruits fresh from her garden--that trim, symmetrical garden,\r\nwith its well-weeded beds, its well-kept walks! Many a bright summer\r\nmorning have I seen her resting on a low bench beneath a huge\r\noverhanging elm, overlooking the field of our labors. To a stranger\r\nthe flushed face with its irregular features, might have seemed plain;\r\nthe earnest, energetic manner might have seemed almost abrupt; but to\r\nthe children who sat on the grass at her feet looking upward, the face\r\nwas beautiful. That calm eye had pierced through so many childish\r\nintricacies and made them clear; the firm mouth could smile so gently\r\nat any youthful shortcoming, and the strong voice rang with a hope\r\nwhich sent fear and doubt skulking away in shamefaced silence. It was\r\nthe brightest part of the day, this short respite, before mother,\r\nmarshalling her young army, led them to the study-room. This impromptu\r\nlesson-hour was filled with a teaching so trenchant, that oftentimes,\r\nin these lonelier days, when perplexed in the intricacies of life's\r\njourneyings, a word spoken in some long ago summer morning, floats\r\ndown the years and rises before my troubled vision a guiding star.\r\n\r\nWhen her children were grown, and the task she had undertaken years\r\nbefore had been well done, our mother turned her attention for a time\r\nto public work. She gave much thought to the Woman Question,\r\nespecially that portion of it pertaining to woman's work, and\r\naddressed one or two meetings in New York on this subject. Miss\r\nAnthony recently said to me: \"Miss Owen, you do not know how great an\r\nimpression your mother made upon us--a woman who had lived nearly her\r\nwhole life in a small Western village, absorbed in petty cares, and\r\nyet who could stand before us[56] with a calm dignity, telling us\r\nsearching truths in simple and strong words.\" The only lecture I heard\r\nmy mother deliver was in the church of our village. Her subject was\r\nthe rearing of children. A calm light rested on her silver hair and\r\nbroad brow; her manner was the earnest manner of a woman who has\r\nlooked into the heart of life. Blessed is the daughter to whom it is\r\ngiven to reverence a mother as I reverenced mine that night. A quiet,\r\nbut deep attention was given to her words, for the fathers and mothers\r\nwho were listening to her knew that she was speaking on a subject to\r\nwhich she had given long years of careful thought and faithful\r\nendeavor. It would not be possible in the space allotted me to give a\r\ndetailed account of my mother's teachings with regard to the rearing\r\nof children; but I will state a few of the more prominent\r\ntheories--theories proved by practice, which I remember.\r\n\r\nSelf-government was the primary principle, the broad foundation. She\r\nheld this qualification to be the only guarantee of success in the\r\nbroadest sense of the word, and that to be effectual and never-failing\r\nit must be interwoven into the very fiber of the child. During the\r\nearliest years our mother administered punishment, or rather she\r\ninvented some means by which the child should be made to feel the\r\nresult of its bad conduct. Injuring another was held to be a cardinal\r\nsin. For this misdeed our hands were tied behind us for an\r\ninterminable length of time; for running away we were tied to the\r\nbed-post; for eating at irregular hours we were deprived of dainties\r\nat the next meal, etc. But as soon as we reached the age of reason,\r\nshe exerted, not a controlling, but a guiding hand. We were restricted\r\nby few rules, for our mother believed in the largest possible liberty,\r\nand she held that it was better to pass over the smaller shortcomings\r\nunnoticed, than constantly to be finding fault. She maintained that\r\nscolding should be indulged in most sparingly, as much of it was\r\ndetrimental both to the temper of the child and the dignity of the\r\nmother. She believed that too little allowance was made for the\r\nheedlessness growing out of pure exuberance of spirits. But when a law\r\nwas once established it was unalterable, and no child ever thought of\r\nresisting it. For instance, no one, large or small, was allowed to\r\nexhibit a peevish ill-nature, either by word or manner, in the public\r\nrooms of the house. My mother merely said, in a quiet tone: \"My child,\r\nyou are either tired or sick; in either case, it would be better to go\r\nto your own room and lie down until you are quite restored.\" The\r\nresult of this simple rule was an almost uniform cheerfulness. I have\r\nlived in many homes, in many parts of the world, but I have never seen\r\none which equaled my mother's in this respect. I do not remember a\r\nsingle command issued by my mother to her older children; but I can\r\nwell remember her saying: \"I think you had better do so and so\"; and I\r\nrecollect distinctly that when we obstinately followed our own\r\nunreasoning will, as we were often inclined to do, we were invariably\r\ntaught a bitter but wholesome lesson. She believed these lessons to be\r\nmuch more effectual for good than any arbitrary prohibition on her\r\npart would have been; she reserved such prohibition for the cases\r\nwhere the consequences were not confined to ourselves, or were of too\r\nserious a nature.\r\n\r\nThe one mistake made by my mother was in the physical management of\r\nher children. Like many mothers whose bodies and minds are kept at the\r\nhighest tension, she failed to give vital strength to her children.\r\nThe most promising of these died in early childhood, \"by the will of\r\nGod,\" as we say in our blindness. One of them especially, the \"little\r\nking,\" as he was called, being a magnificent child, both in mental and\r\nmoral development. Of those who came to maturity, one died at the age\r\nof twenty-seven, one has been an invalid for years, one has fair\r\nhealth, and one only rejoices in a vigorous physique. This boy was\r\nborn in my grandmother's house, near the sea, where my mother had\r\nspent, as she expressed it, \"the laziest year of her whole life.\"\r\nThese children have all had a keen love of study, an energy which\r\ncarried them far beyond their strength, and she failed sufficiently to\r\ncurb them. But in other respects, our mother has done to the\r\nuttermost. Her children had strong propensities both for good and ill.\r\nShe has, so far as is possible, strengthened the virtues and repressed\r\nthe faults of every child given into her keeping.\r\n\r\n\"The sun shines,\" is a sentence simple and short, but how infinite is\r\nits meaning; myriads of unfolding blossoms flash it back in vivid\r\ncoloring; myriads of stalwart trees whisper it; myriads of breathing\r\nthings revel in it; myriads of men thank God for it. So is it with the\r\ninfluence of a good mother. It is not given us to follow each tiny\r\nshaft of light in its endless searchings, neither do we note how the\r\nriot of the waste places within us is pruned by deft hands into a\r\ntenuous symmetry, nor how, in the midst of this life's growth, is laid\r\nthe foundation of the kingdom of Heaven, by the silent masonry of a\r\nmother's constant endeavor.\r\n\r\nMothers, all over this broad land, heavy-laden with the puerile\r\ndetails of daily living, fling off your shrouding cares, and lift your\r\nworn faces that you may see with a broad outlook how full-fruited is\r\nthe vineyard in which you are toiling; the thorns are irritating; the\r\nglebe is rough; your spirit faints in the heat of the toilsome day.\r\nLook up! the lengthening shadows are falling like dew upon you! tired\r\nhearts, look up! purple-red hangs the clustering fruit of your\r\nlife-long work; the vintage has come, the freest from blight that can\r\never come--the vintage of a faithful mother!\r\n\r\nThe name of Mary Owen was not written upon the brains of men, but it\r\nis graven upon the hearts of these her children; so long as they live,\r\nthe blessed memory of that home shall abide with them, a home wherein\r\nall that was sweet, and strong, and true, was nurtured by a wise hand,\r\nwas sunned into blossoming by a loving heart.\r\n\r\nA benediction rests upon the brow of him who has given his best work\r\nto help this world onward, even though it be but a hair's-breadth; but\r\nthe mother who has given herself to her children through long years of\r\nan unwritten self-abnegation, who has thrilled every fiber of their\r\nbeings with faith in God and hope in man, a faith and a hope which no\r\ncanker-worm of worldly experience can ever eat away, she shall be\r\ncrowned with a sainted halo.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMINISCENCES BY DR. MARY F. THOMAS AND AMANDA M. WAY.\r\n\r\nAt an anti-slavery meeting held in Greensboro, Henry Co., in 1851, a\r\nresolution was offered by Amanda M. Way, then an active agent in the\r\n\"Underground Railroad,\" as follows:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The women of our land are being oppressed and degraded\r\n     by the laws and customs of our country, and are in but little\r\n     better condition than chattel slaves; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we call a Woman's Rights Convention, and that a\r\n     committee be now appointed to make the necessary arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe resolution was adopted. Amanda M. Way, Joel Davis, and Fanny Hiatt\r\nwere appointed.\r\n\r\nThe Convention met in October, 1851, in Dublin, Wayne Co., and\r\norganized by electing Hannah Hiatt, President; Amanda Way,\r\nVice-President; and Henry Hiatt, Secretary. Miss Way made the opening\r\naddress, and stated the object of the Convention to be a full, free,\r\nand candid discussion of the legal and social position of women. The\r\nmeetings continued two days. Henry C. Wright addressed large audiences\r\nat the evening sessions. A letter was received from Mary F. Thomas, of\r\nNorth Manchester, urging all those who believe in woman's rights to be\r\nfirm and outspoken. She encouraged young ladies to enter the trades\r\nand professions, to fit themselves in some way for pecuniary\r\nindependence, and adds, \"Although a wife, mother, and housekeeper,\r\nwith all that that means, I am studying medicine, and expect to\r\npractice, if I live.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a Convention being a novel affair, called out some ridicule and\r\nopposition, but the friends were so well pleased with their success,\r\nthat a committee was appointed to arrange for another the next year,\r\nwhich was held in Richmond, Oct. 15 and 16, 1852. A few of the\r\nresolutions[57] will show the spirit of the leaders at that time. A\r\nWoman's Rights Society was formed at this Convention, a Constitution\r\nand By-laws adopted, and it became one of the permanent organizations\r\nof the State. Hannah Hiatt, President; Jane Morrow, Vice-President;\r\nMary B. Birdsall, Secretary; Amanda Way, Treasurer.\r\n\r\nAnother Convention was held at Richmond October 12, 1853. The\r\nPresident being absent, Lydia W. Vandeburg presided with dignity and\r\nability. Frances D. Gage, Josephine S. Griffing, Emma R. Coe, and\r\nLydia Ann Jenkins were among the prominent speakers. Having heard that\r\nAntoinette Brown had been denied admission as a delegate to the\r\n\"World's Temperance Convention,\" held in New York, on account of her\r\nsex, they passed a resolution condemning this insult offered to all\r\nwomankind. Thirty-two persons[58] signed the Constitution in the first\r\nConvention, and the movement spread rapidly in the Hoosier State.\r\n\r\nThe fourth annual meeting convened in Masonic Hall, Indianapolis,\r\nOctober 26, 1854. Frances D. Gage, Caroline M. Severance, and L. A.\r\nHine were the invited speakers, and right well did they sustain the\r\nbanner of equal rights in the capital of the State. J. W. Gordon, then\r\na young and promising lawyer, and since one of the leading men of the\r\nState, avowed himself in favor of woman suffrage, and added much to\r\nthe success of the Convention. The press, as usual, ridiculed,\r\nburlesqued, and misrepresented the proceedings; but the citizens\r\nmanifested a serious interest, and requested that the next Convention\r\nbe held at the capital.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the \"Maine Liquor Law\" was passed in this State. The\r\nwomen took an active part in the temperance campaign, and helped to\r\nsecure the prohibitory law. This made the suffrage movement more\r\npopular, as was shown in the increased attendance at the next\r\nConvention in Indianapolis, October 12, 1855, at which Emma B. Swank\r\npresided. The prominent speakers were James and Lucretia Mott, Frances\r\nD. Gage, Ernestine L. Rose, Joseph Barker, Amanda Way, Henry Hiatt,\r\nand J. W. Gordon. With such women as these to declare the gospel of\r\nequality, and to enforce it with their pure faces, womanly graces, and\r\nnoble lives, the people could not fail to give their sympathy, and to\r\nbe convinced of the rightfulness of our cause. The two leading papers\r\nagain did their best to make the movement ridiculous. The reporters\r\ngave glowing pen sketches of the \"masculine women\" and \"feminine men\";\r\nthey described the dress and appearance of the women very minutely\r\nbut said little of the merits of the question, or the arguments of the\r\nspeakers. Amanda Way was chosen President of the Society; Dr. Mary\r\nThomas, Vice-President; Mary B. Birdsall, Secretary; Abbe Lindley,\r\nTreasurer.\r\n\r\nThe next annual meeting was held in Winchester, October 16 and 17,\r\n1856. In her introductory remarks, the President referred to the great\r\nchange that had taken place in five years. Women were now often seen\r\non the platform making speeches on many questions, behind the counters\r\nas clerks, in the sick-room as physicians. The temperance organization\r\nof Good Templars, now spreading rapidly over the State, makes no\r\ndistinction in its members; women as well as men serve on committees,\r\nhold office, and vote on all business matters. Emma B. Swank and Sarah\r\nE. Underhill were the principal speakers at this Convention. For\r\nlogical argument and beauty of style, Miss Swank was said to have few\r\nequals. Dr. Mary Thomas was chosen President for the next year.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of 1857 was again held in Winchester, by an\r\ninvitation from the citizens, and the Methodist Episcopal Church was\r\ntendered for their use. On taking the chair, the President, Dr. Mary\r\nF. Thomas, said:\r\n\r\n     This is the first time I have had the pleasure of meeting with\r\n     this Association, still my heart, my influence, and my prayers\r\n     have all been with the advocates of this cause. Although I have\r\n     not enjoyed the privilege of attending the annual meetings, owing\r\n     to my many cares, I have not been an idler in the vineyard. By my\r\n     example, as well as my words, I have tried to teach women to be\r\n     more self-reliant, and to prepare themselves for larger and more\r\n     varied spheres of activity.\r\n\r\nFrances D. Gage, who was always a favorite speaker in Indiana, was\r\nagain present, and scattered seeds of truth that have produced\r\nabundant fruit. On motion of Amanda Way, who said she believed it was\r\ntime for us to begin to knock at the doors of the Legislature, a\r\ncommittee of three was appointed to prepare a form of petition to be\r\ncirculated and presented to the next Legislature.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 the Convention again met in Richmond, Sarah Underhill,\r\nPresident. Adeline T. Swift and Anne D. Cridge, of Ohio, both\r\nexcellent speakers, were present. The committee appointed to draft a\r\nform of petition, reported the following:\r\n\r\n     _To the Honorable Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\n     State of Indiana:_\r\n\r\n     The undersigned, residents of the State of Indiana, respectfully\r\n     ask you to grant to women the same rights in property that are\r\n     enjoyed by men. We also ask you to take the necessary steps to\r\n     amend the Constitution so as to extend to woman the right of\r\n     suffrage.\r\n\r\nSarah Underhill, Emma Swank, Mary Birdsall, Agnes Cook, Dr. Mary F.\r\nThomas, and Amanda Way were appointed to present said petition to the\r\nLegislature. The interest was so great, and the discussions so\r\nanimated, for many new speakers from all parts of the State had risen\r\nup, that the Convention continued through three days.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of January, 1859, the petition was presented to the\r\nLegislature by Mary Birdsall, Agnes Cook, and Dr. Mary Thomas. An\r\naccount of the proceedings was given in _The Lily_, a woman's rights\r\npaper, published and edited by Dr. Mary Thomas. The occasion of the\r\npresentation of petitions in person by a delegation of the Indiana\r\nWoman's Rights Association before the assembled Houses of the\r\nLegislature, drew an immense crowd long before the appointed hour. On\r\nthe arrival of the Committee, they were escorted to the Speaker's\r\nstand. The President, J. R. Cravens, introduced them to their\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nMrs. Agnes Cook, in a few brief remarks, invited a serious and candid\r\nconsideration of the intrinsic merits of the petition about to be\r\npresented, and the arguments of the petitioners.\r\n\r\nDr. Mary Thomas read the petition signed by over one thousand\r\nresidents of Indiana, and urged the Legislature to pass laws giving\r\nequal property rights to married women, and to take the necessary\r\nsteps to so amend the Constitution of the State as to secure to all\r\nwomen the right of suffrage. She claimed these rights on the ground of\r\nabsolute justice, as well as the highest expediency, pointing out\r\nclearly the evils that flow from class legislation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Birdsall being introduced, read a clear, concise address,\r\noccupying about half an hour.\r\n\r\nThe following resolution, offered by Gen. Steele, was unanimously\r\nadopted:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the addresses just read be spread upon the\r\n     Journal, and that copies be requested for publication in the city\r\n     papers.\r\n\r\nAfter the Senate adjourned, the Speaker called the House to order, and\r\non the motion of Mr. Murray, it resolved itself into committee of the\r\nwhole on the memorial just presented. On motion of Mr. Hamilton, the\r\npetition was made the special order for Friday, when it was referred\r\nto the Committee on \"Rights and Privileges,\" who reported \"that\r\nlegislation on this subject is inexpedient at this time,\" which report\r\nwas concurred in by the House.\r\n\r\nThe ninth annual meeting was held in Good Templars' Hall, Richmond, in\r\nOctober, 1859. It continued but one day, as the time was fully\r\noccupied in business plans for future work. Mary B. Birdsall was\r\nchosen President of the Association.\r\n\r\nThe intense excitement of the political campaign of 1860, and the\r\ncivil war that followed, absorbed every other interest. The women who\r\nhad so zealously worked for their own rights, were just as ready to\r\nhelp others. Some hastened to the hospitals; others labored in the\r\nsanitary movement. Others did double duty at home, tilling the ground\r\nand gathering in the harvests, that their fathers, husbands, brothers,\r\nand sons might go forth to fight the battles of freedom. No\r\nconventions were held for ten years; but public sentiment had taken a\r\nlong stride during those years of conflict, and when the pioneers\r\nof this reform, who had been accustomed to opposition and\r\nmisrepresentation, again began the work, they were astonished to find\r\nthemselves in a comparatively popular current.\r\n\r\nWe find the following letters from Henry C. Wright and Esther Ann\r\nLukens, in _The Liberator_:\r\n\r\n                         DUBLIN, WAYNE CO., Indiana, _Oct. 14, 1851_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR GARRISON:--I am in a Woman's Rights Convention, the first\r\n     ever held in this State, called by the women of Indiana to\r\n     consider the true position of woman. An excellent but short\r\n     address was made by the President, Hannah Hiatt, on the\r\n     importance of the movement and the ruinous consequences of\r\n     dividing the interests of men and women, and making their\r\n     relations antagonistic in the State, the Church, and the affairs\r\n     of every-day life. Much was said against woman's taking part in\r\n     government. It would degrade her to vote and hold office, and\r\n     destroy her influence as mother, wife, daughter, sister. It was\r\n     an answer that if voting and holding office would degrade women,\r\n     they would degrade men also; whatever is injurious to the moral\r\n     nature, delicacy, and refinement of woman is equally so to man.\r\n     Moral obligations rest equally on both sexes. Man should be as\r\n     refined and chaste as woman if we would make our social life\r\n     pure. Women may as well say to men, \"Keep away from the\r\n     ballot-box and from office, for it degrades you and unfits you to\r\n     be our companions,\" as for man to say so to women. Dr. Curtis, a\r\n     Methodist class-leader, said the Bible had placed the _final\r\n     appeal_ in all disputes in man; that if woman refused obedience,\r\n     God gave man the right to use force. This \"Christian teacher\" was\r\n     the only person in the Convention who appealed to the spirit of\r\n     rowdyism, whose language was unbecoming the subject and the\r\n     occasion. He was the only one who appealed to the Bible to\r\n     justify the subjection of woman. And while he awarded to man the\r\n     right to use force, he said the only influence the Bible\r\n     authorized woman to use was moral suasion. Man is to rule woman\r\n     by violence; woman must rule man by love, kindness, and\r\n     long-suffering. So says the Bible according to the interpretation\r\n     of the learned Dr. Curtis. The Convention lasted two days. It was\r\n     a thrilling meeting.\r\n\r\n                              Yours,                  HENRY C. WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   NEW GARDEN, Ohio, _Oct. 2, 1851_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR FRIENDS:--When Goethe was asked if the world would be better\r\n     if the Golden Age were restored, he answered, \"A synod of good\r\n     women shall decide.\"\r\n\r\n     Could his spirit look down upon us he would see those synods, of\r\n     which he perhaps prophetically spoke, assembling all over the\r\n     land, not to restore an age of semi-barbarism, but to hasten the\r\n     advent of a new and far more golden era, when there will be no\r\n     dangerous pilgrimage of years' duration to win back the Holy\r\n     Sepulchre, but a far more divine and sacred inheritance shall\r\n     have been sought and found; namely, freedom for woman to exercise\r\n     every right, capacity, and power with which God has endowed her.\r\n\r\n     If there are any natural rights, then they belong to all by\r\n     virtue of our humanity, and are not graduated by degrees of\r\n     superiority. If the privilege of voting had been limited to those\r\n     men who were strong in mind and morals, we should never have had\r\n     a Governor's signature to \"the black laws of Ohio.\"\r\n\r\n     It is perverse and cruel to raise the cry that we make war upon\r\n     domestic life; that we would destroy its natural order and\r\n     attraction by allowing woman to mingle in the coarse and noisy\r\n     scenes of political life. Is not the aid of man equally important\r\n     in the family, and would his necessary duties in the home\r\n     conflict with his duties as a citizen and a patriot?\r\n\r\n     Man can not wrong and oppress woman without jeopardizing his own\r\n     liberty. Cramped and crippled as she may be by inexorable law,\r\n     she avenges herself, and decides his destiny. So long as woman is\r\n     outlawed, man pays the penalty in ignorance, poverty, and\r\n     suffering. Our interests are one, we rise or fall together.\r\n\r\n     Sisters of Indiana, accept my heartfelt sympathy in the work you\r\n     have undertaken. It is well for the pioneers of a new country to\r\n     call down God's blessing on their labors by an early claim to an\r\n     equality of rights.\r\n\r\n                    Yours, for justice to all,     ESTHER ANN LUKENS.\r\n\r\nHaving never met the brave women who endured the first shower of\r\nridicule in Indiana, we asked to be introduced to them in some brief\r\npen-sketches, and in the following manner they present themselves:\r\n\r\n                           REV. AMANDA M. WAY\r\n\r\n     may be truthfully called the mother of \"The Woman Suffrage\r\n     Association\" in Indiana organized in 1851, and took an active\r\n     part in all the Conventions until she became a resident in Kansas\r\n     in 1872. Miss Way was always an abolitionist, a prohibitionist,\r\n     and an uncompromising suffragist--the great pioneer of all\r\n     reforms. It is amusing to hear how many places she has been the\r\n     first to fill; yet she has done it all in such a quiet way that\r\n     no one seemed to feel that she was ever out of place. It was a\r\n     common remark, \"Amanda can do that, but she is not like other\r\n     people.\" She was the first woman elected Grand Secretary of the\r\n     \"Indiana Order of Good Templars,\" in 1856; the first State\r\n     lecturer and organizer; the first in the world to be elected\r\n     Grand Worthy Chief Templar; the first one in her State to be a\r\n     representative to the national lodge; the first one admitted as a\r\n     regular representative to the Grand Division, Sons of Temperance,\r\n     and the first to be a licensed preacher in the Methodist\r\n     Episcopal Church. What is better still, she continues in the work\r\n     she began, gaining power and influence with the experience of\r\n     years. An editor, speaking of her, said: \"There is no woman more\r\n     widely and favorably known in this State than Amanda Way. Her\r\n     name is a household word, and in the hearts of the temperance\r\n     reformers her memory will ever be sacred.\"\r\n\r\n     In 1859, she was associated with Mrs. Underhill in editing _The\r\n     Ladies' Tribune_, and has since been connected with the press\r\n     much of the time. During the Rebellion, her time and thoughts\r\n     were given to active labors in the hospitals and the sanitary\r\n     movement. Many a soldier returned to his home who would have died\r\n     but for her care. In company with Mrs. Swank she presented a\r\n     memorial, to the Legislature in 1871, asking the elective\r\n     franchise for women, and made a very effective speech on the\r\n     occasion.\r\n\r\n     Her home-life has been equally active and faithful; a widowed\r\n     mother and a sister's orphaned children, have been her special\r\n     care, depending on her for support. Once, when asked why she\r\n     never married, she laughingly replied, \"I never had time.\"\r\n\r\n     She has been a consistent member of the Methodist Church twenty\r\n     years, and ten years ago, unsolicited by herself, she was\r\n     licensed as a minister by the Winchester Quarterly Conference,\r\n     Rev. Milton Mahin, Presiding Elder. In her travels over the State\r\n     she preaches almost every Sunday, being invited to fill many\r\n     pulpits, both in Kansas and this State.\r\n\r\n     She is a calm, forcible, earnest speaker, and, though quiet and\r\n     reserved in manner, she is genial and warm in her affections.\r\n\r\n     She is now fifty-two years old, and though her life has been a\r\n     constant battle with wrongs, she has not become misanthropic nor\r\n     despondent. Knowing that progress is the law of life, she has\r\n     full faith that the moral world, though moving slowly, is still\r\n     moving in the right direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             HELEN Y. AUSTIN,\r\n\r\n     Corresponding Secretary of the State Suffrage Association for\r\n     many years, a position for which she was eminently fitted, being\r\n     gifted as a writer. Having had a liberal education, and great\r\n     enthusiasm in our cause, her labors have been valuable and\r\n     effective. She is a correspondent for several journals and\r\n     periodicals, is very active in \"The State Horticultural Society,\"\r\n     and takes a deep interest in all the progressive movements of the\r\n     day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LOUISE V. BOYD.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Boyd is a lady of fine poetical genius and superior literary\r\n     attainments. She has been an earnest advocate of woman suffrage\r\n     for many years, and is herself a living argument of woman's\r\n     ability to use the rights she asks.\r\n\r\n     In 1871 she read a very able essay on the \"Women of the Bible,\"\r\n     before the State Association of the Christian Church. It was the\r\n     first time a woman's voice had been heard in that religious body.\r\n     The success of her effort on that occasion opened the way for\r\n     other women. Mrs. Boyd and her husband (Dr. S. S. Boyd, who is\r\n     also a zealous friend of our cause), have both been officers of\r\n     the State W. S. Association for many years, taking an active part\r\n     in all our Conventions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            REV. MARY T. CLARK.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Clark has been an acceptable lecturer and preacher for many\r\n     years in different parts of the State. She was early a recognized\r\n     minister among the Congregational Quakers. More recently she has\r\n     been ordained in the Universalist Church, and enjoys equal rights\r\n     and honors with the clergymen of that denomination. She is a\r\n     woman of education and culture, and of English parentage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               EMMA B. SWANK.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Swank is one of the most pleasing speakers of Indiana. She\r\n     is a graduate of Antioch, and while yet in college she gained\r\n     quite a reputation by her lecturing on Astronomy. She spent\r\n     several years lecturing to classes of women on Physiology,\r\n     Anatomy, and Hygiene. Of late, she has devoted herself to Woman\r\n     Suffrage and Temperance. She served as president of the State\r\n     Society one year before the war and one since, and has always\r\n     done good, service to the cause of woman with both pen and\r\n     tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SARAH E. UNDERHILL.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Underhill was first known in Indiana as the editor and\r\n     proprietor of the _Ladies' Tribune_ at Indianapolis in 1857. She\r\n     associated with her Amanda Way as office editor, that she might\r\n     devote her entire time to lecturing. Though she remained in the\r\n     State but three years, she was widely and favorably known as an\r\n     earnest and effective speaker on Woman Suffrage and Temperance.\r\n     When the war began, she was among the first to go to the sick and\r\n     wounded soldiers. A brief account of her work in the hospitals\r\n     will be found in the \"Women of the War.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                              JANE MORROW.\r\n\r\n     Miss Morrow was a pioneer in our movement; attended the Second\r\n     Convention in 1852. She was not a speaker, but a practical\r\n     business woman, owning and successfully carrying on a dry-goods\r\n     store in Richmond for many years. By precept and example, she\r\n     taught the doctrine of woman's independence and self-reliance.\r\n     She was a kind, genial, sunny-hearted woman, who made all about\r\n     her bright and happy, though she was what the world calls an \"old\r\n     maid.\" In 1867, she died suddenly, without a moment's warning or\r\n     parting word; but \"Aunt Jane,\" as she was familiarly called, will\r\n     long be remembered in her native town.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MARY B. BIRDSALL\r\n\r\n     was secretary of the Convention of 1852, and held that position\r\n     for three years. She purchased _The Lily_, a Woman's Rights\r\n     paper, of Amelia Bloomer, in 1855, and published it for three\r\n     years. Her home is in Richmond.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MARY ROBINSON OWEN.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Owen, wife of Robert Dale Owen, was not known to the public\r\n     until after the war. It is said, however, that she suggested and\r\n     helped prepare the amendments to the laws with reference to\r\n     woman's property rights, that her husband carried through our\r\n     Legislature. She had a strong, clear intellect, and her lectures\r\n     were more argumentative and pointed than rhetorical and flinched.\r\n     She sympathized with and aided her husband in all his reformatory\r\n     movements, and was his equal in mental power. She was one of the\r\n     vice-presidents of our Indiana State Woman Suffrage Association\r\n     at the time of her death, 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MARY F. THOMAS.\r\n\r\n     Mary F. Thomas, M.D., was born October 28. 1816, in Montgomery\r\n     County, Maryland. Her parents, Samuel and Mary Myers, were\r\n     members of the Society of Friends, and resided in their early\r\n     days in Berks and Chester Counties, in Pennsylvania. Her father\r\n     was the associate of Benjamin Lundy, in organizing and attending\r\n     the first anti-slavery meeting held in Washington, at the risk of\r\n     their lives.\r\n\r\n     Desiring to place his family beyond the evil influences of\r\n     slavery, he moved to Columbiana County, Ohio. He purchased a farm\r\n     there; his daughters assisted him in his outdoor labors in the\r\n     summer, and studied under his instructions in the winter. While\r\n     in Washington he frequently took his daughters to the capitol to\r\n     listen to the debates, which gave them interest in political\r\n     questions. Mary was early roused to the consideration of woman's\r\n     wrongs by the unequal wages paid to teachers of her own sex. In\r\n     1845 she was much moved in listening to the preaching of Lucretia\r\n     Mott at a yearly meeting in Salem, Ohio, and resolved that her\r\n     best efforts should be given to secure justice for woman.\r\n\r\n     In 1839 she was married to Dr. Owen Thomas. She has three\r\n     daughters, all well educated, self-reliant women. Her youngest\r\n     daughter, a graduate of Cornell University, Ithaca, New York,\r\n     took the Greek prize in the intercollegiate contest in 1874. As\r\n     Mrs. Thomas' husband was a physician, she studied medicine with\r\n     him, and graduated at the Penn Medical College of Philadelphia in\r\n     1854. She was the first woman to take her place in the State\r\n     Medical Association as a regularly admitted delegate. She is a\r\n     member of the Wayne County Medical Association; has been\r\n     physician for \"The Home for Friendless Women\" in the city of\r\n     Richmond for nine years, and has filled the office of City\r\n     Physician by the appointment of the Commissioners for several\r\n     years.\r\n\r\n     Though deeply interested in the woman suffrage reform, owing to\r\n     her domestic cares and medical studies she could not attend any\r\n     public meetings until 1857; since that time she has been one of\r\n     the most responsible standard-bearers, and for several years\r\n     President of the State Association.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Thomas was always a conscientious abolitionist; the poor\r\n     fugitive from bondage did not knock at her door in vain. The\r\n     temperance reform, too, has had her warm sympathy and the benefit\r\n     of her pure example. She is a member of the Grand Lodge of Good\r\n     Templars, and has held important offices in that Order, having\r\n     been a faithful disciple in spreading the gospel of temperance\r\n     over forty years, always a member of some organization.\r\n\r\n     During the war of the rebellion she gave herself in every way\r\n     that was open to woman to the loyal service of her country. As\r\n     assistant physician in hospitals, looking after the sick and\r\n     wounded, and in sanitary work at home, she manifested as much\r\n     patriotism as any man did on the battle-field. After her long\r\n     experience, she comes to the conclusion, that with the ballot in\r\n     her own hand, with the power to coin her will into law, a woman\r\n     might do a far more effective work in preventing human misery and\r\n     crime, than she ever can accomplish by indirect influence, in\r\n     merely mitigating the evils man perpetuates by law.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   (_From the Liberator of May, 1856_).\r\n\r\n                      RIGHTS OF WOMEN IN WISCONSIN.\r\n\r\n     Minority Report of C. L. Sholes, from the \"Committee on\r\n         Expiration and Re-enactment of Laws,\" to whom were referred\r\n         sundry petitions, praying that steps may be taken to confer\r\n         upon women the right of suffrage in Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n     The minority of the Committee on Expiration and Re-enactment of\r\n     Laws, beg leave to report:\r\n\r\n     The theory of our government, proclaimed some eighty years since,\r\n     these petitioners ask may be reduced to practice. The undersigned\r\n     is aware that the opinion has been announced from a high place\r\n     and high source, that this theory is, in the instrument which\r\n     contains it, a mere rhetorical flourish, admirable to fill a\r\n     sentence and round a period, but otherwise useless and\r\n     meaningless; that so far from all mankind being born free and\r\n     equal, it is those only who have rights that are entitled to\r\n     them; those yet out of the pale of that fortunate condition being\r\n     intended by Providence always to be and remain there. But\r\n     notwithstanding this opinion has the weight of high authority,\r\n     and notwithstanding the practice of the American people has thus\r\n     far been in strict accordance with such opinion, the undersigned\r\n     believes the theory proclaimed is not simply a rhetorical\r\n     flourish, nor meaningless, but that it means just what it says;\r\n     that it is true, and being true, is susceptible of an application\r\n     as broad as the truth proclaimed.\r\n\r\n     All humankind, says the theory, are endowed by their Creator with\r\n     certain inalienable rights. Other governments proclaim the divine\r\n     right of kings, and assume that man is the mere creature of the\r\n     government, deriving all his rights from its concessions, and\r\n     forever subject to all its impositions, while this government (or\r\n     at least its theory) elevates all men to an equality with kings,\r\n     brings every man face to face with the author of his being and\r\n     the arbiter of his destiny, deriving his rights from that source\r\n     alone; and makes government his creature instead of his master,\r\n     instituted by him solely for the better protection and\r\n     application of his God given rights. It is important to keep in\r\n     mind this theory of our government and its difference with the\r\n     theories of all other governments. Endowed by their Creator with\r\n     certain inalienable rights, it says, because those rights are\r\n     necessary to correct relations between each individual of\r\n     humanity and his Creator. Herein is the whole merit of the\r\n     American theory of government, and of its practice too, so far as\r\n     that practice has gone. It is a grand theory, opening as it does\r\n     to every human being the boundless plains of progress which\r\n     stretch out to the foot of the eternal throne, and implying as it\r\n     does such noble powers in humanity, and such noble conditions and\r\n     uses for those powers. Its effect upon those who have enjoyed the\r\n     benefit of its application has been in harmony with its own\r\n     exalted character. Though but a day old, as it were, in the\r\n     history of nations, the United States, in a great many respects,\r\n     outstrip all other nations of the earth, and are inferior in few\r\n     or no particulars to any. The mass of her people are conceded to\r\n     be the most intelligent people of the world, and manifest,\r\n     individually and collectively, the fruits of superior\r\n     intelligence. It will not be denied that our theory of\r\n     government, viewing as it does every man as a sovereign, opening\r\n     up to every man all the distinctions, all the honors, and all\r\n     the wealth which man is capable of desiring, appreciating, or\r\n     grasping, exercises a powerful, indeed a controlling influence in\r\n     making our people what they are, and our nation what it is.\r\n\r\n     These petitions ask only that these rights, enjoyed by one\r\n     portion of the American people, may be extended to embrace the\r\n     whole, not less for the abstract but all-sufficient reason, that\r\n     they have been given to the whole by the Creator, than that by\r\n     their application to the whole, the more general will be the\r\n     benefits experienced; and the deeper, broader, more prevailing\r\n     and more enduring will become those benefits. Manifestly, such\r\n     must be the case; for as these rights belong to humanity, and\r\n     produce their exalted and beneficial fruits by their application\r\n     to and upon humanity, it follows that, wherever humanity is,\r\n     there they belong, and there they will work out their beneficial\r\n     results. To exclude woman from the possession of equal political\r\n     rights with man, it should be shown that she is essentially a\r\n     different being; that the Creator of man is not her Creator; that\r\n     she has not the same evil to shun, the same heaven to gain; in\r\n     short, the same grand, immortal destiny which is supposed to\r\n     invite to high uses the capacity of man, does not pertain to nor\r\n     invite her. We say this must be shown; and if it can not be, as\r\n     certainly it can not, then it follows that to withhold these\r\n     rights, so beneficial to one portion, is to work an immediate and\r\n     particular injury to those from whom they are withheld, and,\r\n     although a more indirect, not a less certain injury to all.\r\n     Man-masculine is not endowed by his Creator with certain\r\n     inalienable rights because he is male, but because he is human;\r\n     and when, in virtue of our strong and superior physical capacity,\r\n     we deny to man-feminine the rights which are ours only in virtue\r\n     of our humanity, we exercise the same indefensible tyranny\r\n     against which _we_ felt justified in taking up arms, and\r\n     perilling life and fortune.\r\n\r\n     The argument against conceding these rights all are familiar\r\n     with. They are precisely the same which have been in the mouths\r\n     of tyrants from the beginning of time, and have been urged\r\n     against any and every demand for popular liberty. A want of\r\n     capacity for self-government--freedom will be only\r\n     licentiousness--and out of the possession of rights will grow\r\n     only the practice of follies and wrongs. This is the argument, in\r\n     brief, applied to every step of gradual emancipation on the part\r\n     of the male, and now by him applied to the female struggling to\r\n     reach the common platform. Should the American male, in the van\r\n     of human progress, as the result of this theory of a capacity for\r\n     self-government, turn round and ignore this divinity, this\r\n     capacity in another branch of the human family? The theory has\r\n     worked only good in its application thus far, and it is a most\r\n     unreasonable, a most unwarrantable distrust to expect it to\r\n     produce mischief when applied to others in all respects mentally\r\n     and morally the equals of those who now enjoy it. It neither can\r\n     nor will do so; but, necessarily, the broader and more universal\r\n     its application, the broader and more universal its benefits.\r\n\r\n     The possession of political rights by woman does not necessarily\r\n     imply that she must or will enter into the practical conduct of\r\n     all the institutions, proper and improper, now established and\r\n     maintained by the male portion of the race. These institutions\r\n     may be right and necessary, or they may not, and the nature of\r\n     woman may or may not be in harmony with them. It is not proposed\r\n     to enact a law compelling woman to do certain things, but it is\r\n     proposed simply to place her side by side with man on a common\r\n     platform of rights, confident that, in that position, she will\r\n     not outrage the \"higher law\" of her nature by descending to a\r\n     participation in faults, follies, or crimes, for which she has no\r\n     constitutional predilections. The association of woman with man,\r\n     in the various relations of life in which such association is\r\n     permitted, from the first unclosing of his eyes in the imbecility\r\n     of infancy, till they close finally upon all things earthly, is\r\n     conceded to be highly beneficial. Indeed, we think it will be\r\n     found, on scrutiny, that it is only those institutions of society\r\n     in which women have no part, and from which they are entirely\r\n     excluded, which are radically wrong, and need either thorough\r\n     renovation or entire abrogation. And if we have any duties so\r\n     essentially degrading, or any institution so essentially impure,\r\n     as to be beyond the renovating influence which woman can bring to\r\n     bear on them, beyond question they should be abrogated without\r\n     delay--a result which woman's connection with them would speedily\r\n     bring about.\r\n\r\n     Who dares say, then, that such association would not be equally\r\n     beneficial, if in every sphere of activity opened to man, woman\r\n     could enter with him and be at his side? Are our politics, in\r\n     their practice, so exalted, so dignified, so pure, that we need\r\n     no new associations, no purer and healthier influences, than now\r\n     connected with them? Is our Government just what we would have\r\n     it; are our rulers just what we would have them; in short, have\r\n     we arrived at that happy summit where perfection in these\r\n     respects is found? Not so. On the contrary, there is an universal\r\n     prayer throughout the length and breadth of the land, for reform\r\n     in these respects; and where, let us ask, could we reasonably\r\n     look for a more powerful agent to effect this reform, than in the\r\n     renovating influences of woman? That which has done so much for\r\n     the fireside and social life generally, neither can nor will lose\r\n     its potent, beneficial effect when brought to bear upon other\r\n     relations of life.\r\n\r\n     To talk of confining woman to her proper sphere by legal\r\n     disabilities, is an insult to the divinity of her nature,\r\n     implying, as it does, the absence of instinctive virtue, modesty,\r\n     and sense on her part. It makes her the creature of law--of our\r\n     law--from which she is assumed to derive her ability to keep the\r\n     path of rectitude, and the withdrawal of which would leave her to\r\n     sink to the depths of folly and vice. Do we really think so badly\r\n     of our mothers, wives, sister, daughters? Is it really we only of\r\n     the race who are instinctively and innately so sensible, so\r\n     modest, so virtuous, as to be qualified, not only to take care of\r\n     ourselves, but to dispense all these exalted qualities to the\r\n     weaker, and, as we assume, inferior half of the race? If it be\r\n     so, it may be doubted whether Heaven's last gift was its best.\r\n     Kings, emperors, and dictators confine their subjects, by the\r\n     interposition of law, to what they consider their proper spheres;\r\n     and there is certainly as much propriety in it as in the\r\n     dictation, by one sex, of the sphere of a different sex. In the\r\n     assumption of our strength, we say woman must not have equal\r\n     rights with us, because she has a different nature. If so, by\r\n     what occult power do we understand that different nature to\r\n     dictate by metes and bounds its wants and spheres? Fair play is a\r\n     Yankee characteristic; and we submit, if but one-half of the race\r\n     can have rights at a time because of their different natures,\r\n     whether it is not about time the proscribed half had its chance\r\n     in, to assume the reins of Government, and dictate _our_ sphere.\r\n     It is no great compliment to that part of the race to venture the\r\n     opinion, that the country would be full as well governed as it\r\n     now is, and our sphere would be bounded with quite as much\r\n     liberality as now is theirs.\r\n\r\n     Let every human being occupy a common platform of political\r\n     rights, and all will irresistibly gravitate exactly to their\r\n     proper place and sphere, without discord, and with none but the\r\n     most beneficial results. In this way human energy and capacity\r\n     will be fully economized and expended for the highest interest of\r\n     all humanity; and this result is only to be obtained by opening\r\n     to all, without restriction, common spheres of activity.\r\n\r\n     Woman has all the interests on earth that man has--she has all\r\n     the interest in the future that man has. Man has rights only in\r\n     virtue of his relations to earth and heaven; and woman, whose\r\n     relations are the same, has the same rights. The possession of\r\n     her rights, on the part of woman, will interfere no more with the\r\n     duties of life, than their possession by man interferes with his\r\n     duties; and as man is presumed to become a better man in all\r\n     respects by the possession of his rights, such must be the\r\n     inevitable effect of their possession upon woman.\r\n\r\n     The history of the race, thus far, has been a history of tyranny\r\n     by the strong over the weak. Might, not right, has been as yet\r\n     the fundamental practice of all governments; and under this order\r\n     of things, woman, physically weak, from a slave, beaten, bought,\r\n     and sold in the market, has but become, in the more civilized and\r\n     favored portions of the earth, the toy of wealth and the drudge\r\n     of poverty. But we now have at least a new and different theory\r\n     of government; and as the aspiration of one age is sure to be the\r\n     code of the next, and practice is sure at some time to overtake\r\n     theory, we have reason to expect that principle will take the\r\n     place of mere brute force, and the truth will be fully realized,\r\n\r\n          \"That men and women have one glory and one shame;\r\n          Everything that's done inhuman injures all of us the same.\"\r\n\r\n     Never, till woman stands side by side with man, his equal in the\r\n     eye of the law as well as the Creator, will the high destiny of\r\n     the race be accomplished. She is the mother of the race, and\r\n     every stain of littleness or inferiority cast upon her by our\r\n     institutions will soil the offspring she sends into the world,\r\n     and clip and curtail to that extent his fair proportions. If we\r\n     would abrogate that littleness of her character which finds a\r\n     delight in the gewgaws of fashion, and an enjoyment in the narrow\r\n     sphere of gossipping, social life, or tea-table scandal, so long\r\n     the ridicule of our sex; open to her new and more ennobling\r\n     fields of activity and thought--fields, the exploration of which\r\n     has filled the American males with great thoughts, and made them\r\n     the foremost people of the world, and which will place the\r\n     American females on their level, and make them truly helps meet\r\n     for them. When we can add to the men of America a race of women\r\n     educated side by side with them, and enjoying equal advantages\r\n     with them in all respects, we may expect an offspring of giants\r\n     in the comprehension and application of the great truths which\r\n     involve human rights and human happiness.\r\n\r\n     These petitions ask that the necessary steps may be taken to\r\n     strike from the Constitution the legal distinction of sex. Your\r\n     Committee is in favor of the prayer of the petitions; but, under\r\n     the most favorable circumstances, that is a result which could\r\n     not be attained in less than two years. In all probability, it\r\n     will not be longer than that before the Constitution will come up\r\n     directly for revision, which will be a proper, appropriate, and\r\n     favorable time to press the question.\r\n\r\n     Your Committee, therefore, introduces no bill, and recommends no\r\n     action at present.\r\n\r\n     All of which is respectfully submitted.             C. L. SHOLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis able report was the result, in a great measure, of the agitation\r\nstarted by Mrs. Nichols and Mrs. Fowler in 1853, and by Lucy Stone's\r\nlecturing tour in 1855, thus proving that no true words or brave deeds\r\nare ever lost. The experiences of these noble pioneers in their first\r\nvisits to Wisconsin, though in many respects trying and discouraging,\r\nbrought their own rich rewards, not only in higher individual\r\ndevelopment, but in an improved public opinion and more liberal\r\nlegislation in regard to the rights of women in that State.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[55] \"The Relation of Woman to Industry in Indiana,\" by May Wright\r\nSewall.\r\n\r\n[56] The vast audience of women alone, in Apollo Hall, to discuss the\r\nMcFarland and Richardson tragedy.\r\n\r\n[57] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[58] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPENNSYLVANIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n     William Penn--Independence Hall--British troops--Heroism of\r\n     women--Lydia Darrah--Who designed the Flag--Anti-slavery\r\n     movements in Philadelphia--Pennsylvania Hall destroyed by a\r\n     mob--David Paul Brown--Fugitives--Millard Fillmore--John\r\n     Brown--Angelina Grimké--Abby Kelly--Mary Grew--Temperance in\r\n     1848--Hannah Darlington and Ann Preston before the Legislature--\r\n     Medical College for Women in 1850--Westchester Woman Rights\r\n     Convention, 1852--Philadelphia Convention, 1854--Lucretia\r\n     Mott answers Richard H.

The charter for this land is still in\r\nexistence at Harrisburg, among the archives of the State. The\r\nprincipal condition of the bargain with the Indians was the payment of\r\ntwo beaver skins annually. This was the purchase money for the great\r\nState of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nPenn landed at New Castle October 27, 1682, and in November visited\r\nthe infant city of Philadelphia, where so many of the eventful scenes\r\nof the Revolution transpired. Penn had been already imprisoned in\r\nEngland several times for his Quaker principles, which had so\r\nbeneficent an influence in his dealings with the Indians, and on the\r\nmoral character of the religious sect he founded in the colonies.\r\n\r\nWhile yet a student he was expelled from Christ Church, Oxford,\r\nbecause he was converted to Quakerism under the preaching of Thomas\r\nLoe. He was imprisoned in Cork for attending a Quaker meeting, and in\r\nthe Tower of London in 1668 for writing \"The Sandy Foundation Shaken,\"\r\nand while there he wrote his great work, \"No Cross, No Crown.\" In\r\n1671, he was again imprisoned for preaching Quakerism, and as he would\r\ntake no oath on his trial, he was thrown into Newgate, and while there\r\nhe wrote his other great work on \"Toleration.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1729 the foundations of Independence Hall, the old State House,\r\nwere laid, and the building was completed in 1734. Here the first\r\nContinental Congress was held in September, 1774; a Provincial\r\nConvention in January, 1775; the Declaration of Independence\r\nproclaimed July 4, 1776, and on the 8th, read to thousands assembled\r\nin front of the building. These great events have made Philadelphia\r\nthe birthplace of freedom, the Mecca of this western world, where the\r\nlovers of liberty go up to worship; and made the Keystone State so\r\nrich in memories, the brightest star in the republican constellation,\r\nwhere in 1776 freedom was proclaimed, and in 1780 slavery was\r\nabolished.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia remained the seat of Government until 1800. The British\r\ntroops occupied the city from September 26, 1777, to June 18, 1778.\r\nDuring this period we find many interesting incidents in regard to the\r\nheroism of women. In every way they aided the struggling army, not\r\nonly in providing food and clothes, ministering to the sick in camp\r\nand hospitals, but on active duty as messengers and spies under most\r\ndifficult and dangerous circumstances. The brave deeds and severe\r\nprivations the women of this nation endured with cheerfulness would\r\nfill volumes, yet no monuments are built to their memory, and only by\r\nthe right of petition have they as yet the slightest recognition in\r\nthe Government. A few instances that occurred at Philadelphia will\r\nillustrate the patriotism of American women.[59]\r\n\r\n     While the American army remained encamped at White Marsh, the\r\n     British being in possession of Philadelphia, Gen. Howe made some\r\n     vain attempts to draw Washington into an engagement. The house\r\n     opposite the headquarters of Gen. Howe, tenanted by William and\r\n     Lydia Darrah, members of the Society of Friends, was the place\r\n     selected by the superior officers of the army for private\r\n     conference, whenever it was necessary to hold consultations.\r\n\r\n     On the afternoon of the 2d of December, the British\r\n     Adjutant-General called and informed the mistress that he and\r\n     some friends were to meet there that evening, and desired that\r\n     the back room up-stairs might be prepared for their reception.\r\n     \"And be sure, Lydia,\" he concluded, \"that your family are all in\r\n     bed at an early hour. When our guests are ready to leave the\r\n     house, I will myself give you notice, that you may let us out and\r\n     extinguish the candles.\"\r\n\r\n     Having delivered this order, the Adjutant-General departed. Lydia\r\n     betook herself to getting all things in readiness. But she felt\r\n     curious to know what the business could be that required such\r\n     secrecy, and resolved on further investigation. Accordingly, in\r\n     the midst of their conference that night, she quietly approached\r\n     the door, and listening, heard a plan for the surprise of\r\n     Washington's forces arranged for the next night. She retreated\r\n     softly to her room and laid down; soon there was a knocking at\r\n     her door. She knew well what the signal meant, but took no heed\r\n     until it was repeated again and again, and then she arose\r\n     quickly and opened the door. It was the Adjutant-General who\r\n     came to inform her they were ready to depart. Lydia let them out,\r\n     fastened the door, extinguished the fire and lights, and returned\r\n     to her chamber, but she was uneasy, thinking of the threatened\r\n     danger.\r\n\r\n     At the dawn of day she arose, telling her family that she must go\r\n     to Frankfort to procure some flour. She mounted her horse, and\r\n     taking the bag, started. The snow was deep and the cold intense,\r\n     but Lydia's heart did not falter. Leaving the grist at the mill,\r\n     she started on foot for the camp, determined to apprise Gen.\r\n     Washington of his danger. On the way she met one of his officers,\r\n     who exclaimed in astonishment at seeing her, but making her\r\n     errand known, she hastened home.\r\n\r\n     Preparations were immediately made to give the enemy a fitting\r\n     reception. None suspected the grave, demure Quakeress of having\r\n     snatched from the English their anticipated victory; but after\r\n     the return of the British troops Gen. Howe summoned Lydia to his\r\n     apartment, locked the door with an air of mystery, and motioned\r\n     her to a seat. After a moment of silence, he said: \"Were any of\r\n     your family up, Lydia, on the night when I received my company\r\n     here?\" \"No,\" she replied, \"they all _retired_ at eight o'clock.\"\r\n     \"It is very strange,\" said the officer, and mused a few minutes.\r\n     \"I know you were asleep, for I knocked at your door three times\r\n     before you heard me; yet it is certain that we were betrayed.\"\r\n\r\n     Afterward some one asked Lydia how she could say her family were\r\n     all in bed while she herself was up; she replied, \"Husband and\r\n     wife are one, and that one is the husband, and my husband was in\r\n     bed.\" Thus the wit and wisdom of this Quaker woman saved the\r\n     American forces at an important crisis, and perhaps turned the\r\n     fate of the Revolutionary War.\r\n\r\nDuring that dreadful winter, 1780, at Valley Forge, the ladies of\r\nPhiladelphia combined to furnish clothing for the army. Money and\r\njewels were contributed in profusion. Those who could not give money,\r\ngave their services freely. Not less than $7,500 were contributed to\r\nan association for this purpose, of which Esther De Berdt Reed was\r\npresident. Though an English woman, the French Secretary said of her:\r\n\"She is called to this office as the best patriot, the most zealous\r\nand active, and the most attached to the interests of the country.\"\r\n\r\nThe archives of the Keystone State prove that she can boast many noble\r\nwomen from the time of that great struggle for the nation's existence,\r\nthe signal for which was given when the brave old bell rang out from\r\nIndependence Hall its message of freedom. The very colors then\r\nunfurled, and for the first time named the flag of the United States,\r\nwere the handiwork, and in part the invention of a woman. That to the\r\ntaste and suggestions of Mrs. Elizabeth Ross, of Philadelphia, we owe\r\nthe beauty of the Union's flag can not be denied. There are those who\r\nwould deprive her of all credit in this connection, and assert that\r\nthe committee appointed to prepare a flag gave her the perfected\r\ndesign; but the evidence is in favor of her having had a large share\r\nin the change from the original design to the flag as it now is; the\r\nsame flag which we have held as a nation since the memorable year of\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, the flag which now floats on every\r\nsea, whose stars and stripes carry hope to all the oppressed nations\r\nof the earth; though to woman it is but an _ignis fatuus_, an ever\r\nwaving signal of the ingratitude of the republic to one-half its\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nAn anecdote of a female spy is related in the journal of Major\r\nTallmadge. While the Americans were at Valley Forge he was stationed\r\nin the vicinity of Philadelphia with a detachment of cavalry to\r\nobserve the enemy and limit the range of British foraging parties. His\r\nduties required the utmost vigilance, his squad seldom remained all\r\nnight in the same position, and their horses were rarely unsaddled.\r\nHearing that a country girl had gone into the city with eggs; having\r\nbeen sent by one of the American officers to gain information;\r\nTallmadge advanced toward the British lines, and dismounted at a small\r\ntavern within view of their outposts. The girl came to the tavern, but\r\nwhile she was communicating her intelligence to the Major, the alarm\r\nwas given that the British light-horse were approaching. Tallmadge\r\ninstantly mounted, and as the girl entreated protection, bade her get\r\nup behind him. They rode three miles at full speed to Germantown, the\r\ndamsel showing no fear, though there was some wheeling and charging,\r\nand a brisk firing of pistols.\r\n\r\nTradition tells of some women in Philadelphia, whose husbands used to\r\nsend intelligence from the American army through a market-boy, who\r\ncame into the city to bring provisions, and carried the dispatches\r\nsent in the back of his coat. One morning, when there was some fear\r\nthat his movements were watched, a young girl undertook to get the\r\npapers. In a pretended game of romps, she threw her shawl over his\r\nhead, and secured the prize. She hastened with the papers to her\r\nfriends, who read them with deep interest, after the windows were\r\ncarefully closed. When news came of Burgoyne's surrender, the\r\nsprightly girl, not daring to give vent openly to her exultation, put\r\nher head up the chimney and hurrahed for Gates.\r\n\r\nAnd not only in the exciting days of the Revolution do we find\r\nabundant records of woman's courage and patriotism, but in all the\r\ngreat moral movements that have convulsed the nation, she has taken an\r\nactive and helpful part. The soil of Pennsylvania is classic with the\r\nstartling events of the anti-slavery struggle. In the first\r\nAnti-Slavery Society, of which Benjamin Franklin was president, women\r\ntook part, not only as members, but as officers. The name of Lydia\r\nGillingham stands side by side with Jacob M. Ellis as associate\r\nsecretaries, signing reports of the \"Association for the Abolition of\r\nSlavery.\"\r\n\r\nThe important part women took in the later movement, inaugurated by\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, has already passed into history. The interest\r\nin this question was intensified in this State, as it was the scene of\r\nthe continued recapture of fugitives. The heroism of the women, who\r\nhelped to fight this great battle of freedom, was only surpassed by\r\nthose who, taking their lives in their hands, escaped from the land of\r\nslavery. The same love of liberty that glowed in eloquent words on the\r\nlips of Lucretia Mott, Angelina Grimké, and Mary Grew, was echoed in\r\nthe brave deeds of Margaret Garner, Linda Brent, and Mrs. Stowe's\r\nEliza.\r\n\r\nOn December 4, 1833, the Abolitionists assembled in Philadelphia to\r\nhold a national convention, and to form the American Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety. During all the sessions of three days, women were constant\r\nand attentive listeners. Lucretia Mott, Esther More, Sidney Ann Lewis,\r\nand Lydia White, took part in the discussions.\r\n\r\nThe following resolution, passed at the close of the third day,\r\nwithout dissent, or a word to qualify or limit its application, shows\r\nthat no one then thought it improper for women to speak in public:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the thanks of the Convention be presented to our\r\n     female friends for the deep interest they have manifested in the\r\n     cause of anti-slavery, during the long and fatiguing sessions of\r\n     this Convention.\r\n\r\nSamuel J. May, in writing of this occasion many years after, says: \"It\r\nis one of the proudest recollections of my life that I was a member of\r\nthe Convention in Philadelphia, in December, 1833, that formed the\r\nAmerican Anti-Slavery Society. And I well remember the auspicious\r\nsequel to it, the formation of the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety. Nor shall I ever forget the wise, the impressive, the\r\nanimating words spoken in our Convention by dear Lucretia Mott and two\r\nor three other excellent women who came to that meeting by divine\r\nappointment. But with this last recollection will be forever\r\nassociated the mortifying fact, that we _men_ were then so blind, so\r\nobtuse, that we did not recognize those women as members of our\r\nConvention, and insist upon their subscribing their names to our\r\n'Declaration of Sentiments and Purposes.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the National Society adjourn, than the women who had\r\nlistened to the discussions with such deep interest, assembled to\r\norganize themselves for action. A few extracts from Mary Grew's final\r\nreport of the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society in 1870 show\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n     A meeting convened at the school-room of Catherine McDermott,\r\n     12th mo. 9th, 1833, to take into consideration the propriety of\r\n     forming a Female Anti-Slavery Society; addresses were made by\r\n     Samuel J. May, of Brooklyn, Conn., and Nathaniel Southard, of\r\n     Boston, who pointed out the important assistance that might be\r\n     rendered by our sex in removing the great evil of slavery. After\r\n     some discussion upon this interesting subject, it was concluded\r\n     to form a Society, in the belief that our combined efforts would\r\n     more effectually aid in relieving the oppression of our suffering\r\n     fellow-creatures. For this purpose a Committee was appointed to\r\n     draft a Constitution, and to propose such measures as would be\r\n     likely to promote the Abolition of Slavery, and to elevate the\r\n     people of color from their present degraded situation to the full\r\n     enjoyment of their rights, and to increased usefulness in\r\n     society.\r\n\r\n     At a meeting held 12th mo. 14th, the Committee appointed on the\r\n     9th submitted a form of Constitution, which was read and adopted.\r\n     After its adoption, the following persons signed their names:\r\n     Lucretia Mott, Esther Moore, Mary Ann Jackson, Margaretta Forten,\r\n     Sarah Louisa Forten, Grace Douglass, Mary Sleeper, Rebecca\r\n     Hitchins, Mary Clement, A. C. Eckstein, Mary Wood, Leah Fell,\r\n     Sidney Ann Lewis, Catherine McDermott, Susan M. Shaw, Lydia\r\n     White, Sarah McCrummell, Hetty Burr. The Society then proceeded\r\n     to the choice of officers for the ensuing year; when the\r\n     following persons were elected: Esther Moore, Presiding Officer;\r\n     Margaretta Forten, Recording Secretary; Lucretia Mott,\r\n     Corresponding Secretary; Anna Bunting, Treasurer; Lydia White,\r\n     Librarian.\r\n\r\n     The Annual Reports of the first two years of this Society are not\r\n     extant; but from its third, we learn that in each of those years\r\n     the Society memorialized Congress, praying for the abolition of\r\n     slavery in the District of Columbia and the Territories of the\r\n     United States. In the second year of its existence, it appointed\r\n     a Standing Committee for the purpose of visiting the schools for\r\n     colored children in this city, and aiding them in any practicable\r\n     way. In the third year it appointed a Committee \"to make\r\n     arrangements for the establishment of a course of scientific\r\n     lectures, which our colored friends were particularly invited to\r\n     attend.\" The phraseology of this statement implies that white\r\n     persons were not to be excluded from these lectures, and\r\n     indicates a clear-sighted purpose, on the part of the Society, to\r\n     bear its testimony against distinctions founded on color. In this\r\n     year it published an Address to the Women of Pennsylvania,\r\n     calling their attention to the claims of the slave, and urging\r\n     them to sign petitions for his emancipation. Mrs. Elizabeth\r\n     Heyrick's well-known pamphlet, entitled \"Immediate, not Gradual\r\n     Emancipation,\" was during the same year republished by the\r\n     \"Anti-Slavery Sewing Society,\" a body composed of some of the\r\n     members of this Association, but not identical with it, which met\r\n     weekly at the house of our Vice-President, Sidney Ann Lewis.\r\n     Another event, important and far-reaching beyond our power then\r\n     to foresee, had marked the year. A member of this Society[60] had\r\n     received and accepted a commission to labor as an agent of the\r\n     American Anti-Slavery Society. It is evident, from the language\r\n     of the Report, that the newly-appointed agent and her\r\n     fellow-members regarded the mission as one fraught with peculiar\r\n     trial of patience and faith, and anticipated the opposition which\r\n     such an innovation on the usages of the times would elicit. Her\r\n     appointed field of labor was among her own sex, in public or in\r\n     private; but in the next year's Report it is announced that she\r\n     had enlarged her sphere. The fact should never be forgotten by us\r\n     that it was a member of this Society who first broke the soil in\r\n     that field where so many women have since labored abundantly, and\r\n     are now reaping so rich a harvest.\r\n\r\n     The next year, 1837, was made memorable by a still greater\r\n     innovation upon established usage--the first National Convention\r\n     of American Anti-Slavery Women. It is interesting and profitable\r\n     to notice, as the years passed, that new duties and new\r\n     responsibilities educated woman for larger spheres of action.\r\n     Each year brought new revelations, presented new aspects of the\r\n     cause, and made new demands. Our early Reports mention these\r\n     Conventions of Women, which were held during three consecutive\r\n     years in New York and this city, as a novel measure, which would,\r\n     of course, excite opposition; and they also record the fact that\r\n     \"the editorial rebukes, sarcasm, and ridicule\" which they\r\n     elicited, did not exceed the anticipations of the Abolitionists.\r\n\r\n     The second of these Conventions was held in this city, in the\r\n     midst of those scenes of riot when infuriated Southern\r\n     slaveholders and cowardly Northern tradesmen combined for\r\n     purposes of robbery and arson, and surrounded Pennsylvania Hall\r\n     with their representatives, the mob which plundered and burnt it,\r\n     while the City Government looked on consenting to these crimes.\r\n     That Convention was the last assembly gathered in that Hall, then\r\n     just dedicated to the service of Freedom. Its fifth session, on\r\n     the 17th of May, 1838, was held, calmly and deliberately, while\r\n     the shouts of an infuriated mob rose around the building,\r\n     mingling with the speakers' voices, and sometimes overwhelming\r\n     them; while stones and other missiles crashing through the\r\n     windows imperilled the persons of many of the audience. The\r\n     presence of an assembly of women was supposed to be a partial\r\n     protection against the fury of the rioters; and believing that\r\n     the mob would not fire the building while it was thus filled, a\r\n     committee of anti-slavery men sent a request to the Convention to\r\n     remain in session during the usual interval between the afternoon\r\n     and evening meetings, if, with their knowledge of their perilous\r\n     surroundings, they felt willing to do so. The President laid the\r\n     request before the Convention, and asked, Will you remain? A few\r\n     minutes of solemn deliberation; a few moments' listening to the\r\n     loud madness surging against the outer walls; a moment's unvoiced\r\n     prayer for wisdom and strength, and the answer came: _We will_;\r\n     and the business of the meeting proceeded. But before the usual\r\n     hour of adjournment arrived, another message came from the\r\n     committee, withdrawing their request, and stating that further\r\n     developments of the spirit pervading the mob and the city,\r\n     convinced them that it would be unwise for the Convention to\r\n     attempt to hold possession of the Hall for the evening. The\r\n     meeting adjourned at the usual hour, and, on the next morning,\r\n     the burnt and crumbling remains of Pennsylvania Hall told the\r\n     story of Philadelphia's disgrace, and the temporary triumph of\r\n     the spirit of slavery.\r\n\r\n     The experience of that morning is very briefly mentioned in the\r\n     published \"Proceedings,\" which state that \"the Convention met,\r\n     pursuant to adjournment, at Temperance Hall, but found the doors\r\n     closed by order of the managers\"; that they were offered the use\r\n     of a school-room, in which they assembled; and there the\r\n     Convention held its closing session of six hours. But they who\r\n     made a part of the thrilling history of those times well remember\r\n     how the women of that Convention walked through the streets of\r\n     this city, from the Hall on Third Street, closed against them, to\r\n     the school-room on Cherry Street, hospitably opened to them by\r\n     Sarah Pugh and Sarah Lewis, and were assailed by the insults of\r\n     the populace as they went. It was a meeting memorable to those\r\n     who composed it; and was one of many interesting associations of\r\n     our early anti-slavery history which cluster around the\r\n     school-house, which in those days was always open to the advocacy\r\n     of the slave's cause.[61]\r\n\r\n     An incident in connection with the last of these Conventions,\r\n     shows how readily and hopefully, in the beginning of our work, we\r\n     turned for help to the churches and religious societies of the\r\n     land; and how slowly and painfully we learned their real\r\n     character. It is long since we ceased to expect efficient help\r\n     from them; but in those first years of our warfare against\r\n     slavery, we had not learned that the ecclesiastical standard of\r\n     morals in a nation _can not_ be higher than the standard of the\r\n     populace generally.\r\n\r\n     A committee of arrangements appointed to obtain a house in which\r\n     the Convention should be held, reported: \"That in compliance with\r\n     a resolution passed at a meeting of this Society, an application\r\n     was made to each of the seven Monthly Meetings of Friends, in\r\n     this city, for one of their meeting-houses, in which to hold the\r\n     Convention.\" Two returned respectful answers, declining the\r\n     application; three refused to hear it read; one appointed two\r\n     persons to examine it, and then decided \"that it should be\r\n     _returned without being read_,\" though a few members urged \"that\r\n     it should be treated more respectfully\"; and that from one\r\n     meeting no answer was received.\r\n\r\n     As to other denominations of professed Christians, similar\r\n     applications had been frequently refused by them, although there\r\n     was one exception which should be ever held in honorable\r\n     remembrance by the Abolitionists of Philadelphia. The use of the\r\n     church of the Covenanters, in Cherry street, of which Rev. James\r\n     M. Wilson was for many years the pastor, was never refused for an\r\n     anti-slavery meeting, even in the most perilous days of our\r\n     enterprise. Another fact in connection with the Convention of\r\n     1839 it is pleasant to remember now, when the faithful friend\r\n     whose name it recalls has gone from among us. The Committee of\r\n     Arrangements reported that their difficulties and perplexities\r\n     \"were relieved by a voluntary offer from that devoted friend of\r\n     the slave, John H. Cavender, who, with kindness at once\r\n     unexpected and gratifying, offered the use of a large unfurnished\r\n     building in Filbert Street, which had been used as a riding\r\n     school; which was satisfactorily and gratefully occupied by the\r\n     Convention.\"\r\n\r\n     In the year 1840, our Society sent delegates to the assembly\r\n     called \"The World's Anti-Slavery Convention,\" which was held in\r\n     London, in the month of May of that year. As is well known, that\r\n     body refused to admit any delegates excepting those of the male\r\n     sex, though the invitation was not thus limited; consequently,\r\n     this Society was not represented there.\r\n\r\n     The year 1850 was an epoch in the history of the anti-slavery\r\n     cause. The guilt and disgrace of the nation was then intensified\r\n     by that infamous statute known by the name of \"The Fugitive Slave\r\n     Law.\" Its enactment by the Thirty-first Congress, and its\r\n     ratification by Millard Fillmore's signature, was the signal for\r\n     an extensive and cruel raid upon the colored people of the North.\r\n     Probably no statute was ever written, in the code of a civilized\r\n     nation, so carefully and cunningly devised for the purpose of\r\n     depriving men of liberty. It put in imminent peril the personal\r\n     freedom of every colored man and woman in the land. It furnished\r\n     the kidnapper all possible facilities, and bribed the judge on\r\n     the bench to aid him in his infamous work. The terrible scenes\r\n     that followed; the cruel apathy of the popular heart and\r\n     conscience; the degradation of the pulpit, which sealed the deed\r\n     with its loud Amen! the mortal terror of a helpless and innocent\r\n     race; the fierce assaults on peaceful homes; the stealthy\r\n     capture, by day and by night, of unsuspecting free-born people;\r\n     the blood shed on Northern soil; the mockeries of justice acted\r\n     in United States courts; are they not all written in our\r\n     country's history, and indelibly engraven on the memories of\r\n     Abolitionists?\r\n\r\n     The case of Adam Gibson, captured in this city by the notorious\r\n     kidnapper, Alberti, and tried before the scarcely less notorious\r\n     Ingraham, in the year 1850, and which was succeeded in the next\r\n     year by the Christiana tragedy, are instances of many similar\r\n     outrages committed in Pennsylvania. No pen can record, no human\r\n     power can estimate, the aggregate of woe and guilt which was the\r\n     legitimate result of that Fugitive Slave Bill.\r\n\r\n     The year 1855 was marked by a series of events unique in our\r\n     history. A citizen of Philadelphia, whose name will always be\r\n     associated with the cause of American liberty, in the legal\r\n     performance of his duty, quietly informed three slaves who had\r\n     been brought into this State by their master, a Virginia\r\n     slaveholder, that by the laws of Pennsylvania they were free. The\r\n     legally emancipated mother, Jane Johnson, availing herself of\r\n     this knowledge, took possession of her own person and her own\r\n     children; and their astonished master suddenly discovered that\r\n     his power to hold them was gone forever. No judge, commissioner,\r\n     or lawyer, however willing, could help him to recapture his prey.\r\n     But a judge of the United States District Court could assist him\r\n     in obtaining a mean revenge upon the brave man who had\r\n     enlightened an ignorant woman respecting her legal right to\r\n     freedom. Judge Kane, usurping jurisdiction in the case, and\r\n     exercising great ingenuity to frame a charge of contempt of\r\n     Court, succeeded in his purpose of imprisoning Passmore\r\n     Williamson in our County jail. The baffled slaveholder also found\r\n     sympathizers in the Grand Jury, who enabled him to indict for\r\n     riot and assault and battery, Passmore Williamson, William Still,\r\n     and five other persons. During the trial which ensued, the\r\n     prosecutor and his allies were confounded by the sudden\r\n     appearance of a witness whose testimony that she was not forcibly\r\n     taken from her master's custody, but had left him freely,\r\n     disconcerted all their schemes, and defeated the prosecution. The\r\n     presence of Jane Johnson in that court room jeoparded her\r\n     newly-acquired freedom; for though Pennsylvania was pledged to\r\n     her protection, it was questionable whether the slave power, in\r\n     the person of United States officers and their ever ready\r\n     minions, would not forcibly overpower State authority and obtain\r\n     possession of the woman. It was an intensely trying hour for her\r\n     and for all who sympathized with her. Among those who attended\r\n     her through that perilous scene, were the president of this\r\n     Society, Sarah Pugh, and several of its members. All those ladies\r\n     will testify to the calm bearing and firm courage of this\r\n     emancipated slave-mother, in the hour of jeopardy to her\r\n     newly-found freedom. Protected by the energy and skill of the\r\n     presiding Judge, William D. Kelley, and of the State officers,\r\n     her safe egress from the court-room was accomplished; and she was\r\n     soon placed beyond the reach of her pursuers.\r\n\r\n     In 1859 we reaped a rich harvest from long years of sowing, in\r\n     the result of the trial of the alleged fugitive slave, Daniel\r\n     Webster. This trial will never be forgotten by those of us who\r\n     witnessed it. The arrest was made in Harrisburg, in the month of\r\n     April, and the trial was in this city before United States\r\n     Commissioner John C. Longstreth. We do not, at this distance of\r\n     time, need the records of that year, to remind us that \"it was\r\n     with heavy and hopeless hearts that the Abolitionists of this\r\n     city gathered around that innocent and outraged man, and attended\r\n     him through the solemn hours of his trial.\" The night which many\r\n     of the members of this Society passed in that court, keeping\r\n     vigils with the unhappy man whose fate hung tremulous on the\r\n     decision of the young commissioner, was dark with despair; and\r\n     the dawn of morning brought no hope to our souls. We confidently\r\n     expected to witness again, as we had often witnessed before, the\r\n     triumph of the kidnapper and his legal allies over law and\r\n     justice and human liberty. In the afternoon of that day we\r\n     re-assembled to hear the judicial decision which should consign\r\n     the wretched man to slavery, and add another page to the record\r\n     of Pennsylvania's disgrace. But a far different experience\r\n     awaited us. Commissioner Longstreth obeyed the moral sentiment\r\n     around him, and doubtless the voice of his conscience, and\r\n     pronounced the captive free. \"The closing scenes of this trial;\r\n     the breathless silence with which the crowded assembly in the\r\n     court-room waited to hear the death-knell of the innocent\r\n     prisoner; the painfully sudden transition from despair to hope\r\n     and thence to certainty of joy; the burst of deep emotion; the\r\n     fervent thanksgiving, wherein was revealed that sense of the\r\n     brotherhood of man which God has made a part of every human soul;\r\n     the exultant shout which went up from the multitude who thronged\r\n     the streets waiting for the decision\"; these no language can\r\n     portray, but they are life-long memories for those who shared in\r\n     them. This event proved the great change wrought in the popular\r\n     feeling, the result of twenty-five years of earnest effort to\r\n     impress upon the heart of this community anti-slavery doctrines\r\n     and sentiments. Then for the first time the Abolitionists of\r\n     Philadelphia found their right of free speech protected by city\r\n     authorities. Alexander Henry was the first Mayor of this city who\r\n     ever quelled a pro-slavery mob.\r\n\r\n     Our last record of a victim sacrificed to this statute, is of the\r\n     case of Moses Horner, who was kidnapped near Harrisburg in March,\r\n     1860, and doomed to slavery by United States Judge John\r\n     Cadwallader, in this city. One more effort was made a few months\r\n     later to capture in open day in the heart of this city a man\r\n     alleged to be a fugitive slave, but it failed of ultimate\r\n     success. The next year South Carolina's guns thundered forth the\r\n     doom of the slave power. She aimed them at Fort Sumter and the\r\n     United States Government. God guided their fiery death to the\r\n     very heart of American slavery.\r\n\r\n     If the history of this Society were fully written, one of its\r\n     most interesting chapters would be a faithful record of its\r\n     series of annual fairs. Beginning in the year 1836, the series\r\n     continued during twenty-six years, the last fair being held in\r\n     December, 1861. The social attraction of these assemblies induced\r\n     many young persons to mingle in them, besides those who labored\r\n     from love of the cause. Brought thus within the circle of\r\n     anti-slavery influence, many were naturally converted to our\r\n     principles, and became earnest laborers in the enterprise which\r\n     had so greatly enriched their own souls. The week of the fair was\r\n     the annual Social Festival of the Abolitionists of the State.\r\n     Though held under the immediate direction of this Society, it\r\n     soon became a Pennsylvania institution. Hither our tribes came up\r\n     to take counsel together, to recount our victories won, to be\r\n     refreshed by social communion, and to renew our pledges of\r\n     fidelity to the slave. There were years when these were very\r\n     solemn festivals, when our skies were dark with gathering storms,\r\n     and we knew not what peril the night or the morning might bring.\r\n     But they were always seasons from which we derived strength and\r\n     encouragement for future toil and endurance, and their value to\r\n     our cause is beyond our power to estimate.\r\n\r\n     The pro-slavery spirit which always pervaded our city, and which\r\n     sometimes manifested itself in the violence of mobs, never\r\n     seriously disturbed our fair excepting in one instance. In the\r\n     year 1859 our whole Southern country quaked with mortal fear in\r\n     the presence of John Brown's great deed for Freedom. The coward\r\n     North trembled in its turn lest its Southern trade should be\r\n     imperilled, and in all its cities there went up a frantic cry\r\n     that the Union must be saved and the Abolitionists suppressed.\r\n     The usual time for holding our fair was at hand. Before it was\r\n     opened a daily newspaper of this city informed its readers that\r\n     notwithstanding the rebuke which the Abolitionists had received\r\n     from a recent meeting of Union-savers, they had audaciously\r\n     announced their intention of holding another fair, the avowed\r\n     purpose of which was the dissemination of anti-slavery\r\n     principles. The indignant journalist asked if Philadelphia would\r\n     suffer such a fair to be held. This was doubtless intended as a\r\n     summons to a mob, and a most deadly mob responded to the call. It\r\n     did not expend its violence upon our fair, but against an\r\n     assembly in National Hall, gathered to listen to a lecture by\r\n     George W. Curtis, upon the Present Aspect of the Country.\r\n\r\n     The High Constable, Mayor, and Sheriff were the agents employed\r\n     by the slave power to take and hold possession of Concert Hall,\r\n     and in its behalf, if not in its name, to eject us and our\r\n     property. The work was commenced by the Mayor, who sent the High\r\n     Constable with an order that our flag should be removed from the\r\n     street. Its offensiveness consisted in the fact that it presented\r\n     to the view of all passers-by a picture of the Liberty Bell in\r\n     Independence Hall, inscribed with the words, \"Proclaim liberty\r\n     throughout all the land, to all the inhabitants thereof.\" The\r\n     next step was an attempt to induce the lessee to eject us from\r\n     the hall. On his refusal to violate his contract with us, the\r\n     trustees obtained legal authority to dispossess us on the plea\r\n     that the hall had been rented for a purpose which tended to\r\n     excite popular commotion. The sheriff entered, took possession,\r\n     and informed the managers that our property must be removed\r\n     within three hours. Then were the doors of this hall,[62] where\r\n     we are now assembled, opened to us, and here our fair was held,\r\n     with great success, during the remainder of the week. In the\r\n     stormiest seasons of our enterprise these saloons have never been\r\n     closed against anti-slavery meetings; and our fair of 1860 was\r\n     welcomed to them amidst the loud threatenings of a mob which were\r\n     seeking to appease the angry South, then just rising in open\r\n     rebellion against the United States Government. The experience of\r\n     those four days of December spent in these rooms will never be\r\n     forgotten by us. It was a season of trial, of rejoicing, and of\r\n     victory. The veterans of our cause, long accustomed to the\r\n     threats and the presence of mobs, found reason for rejoicing in\r\n     the courage and serenity with which the young recruits in our\r\n     ranks faced the peril of scenes so new to them, and proved their\r\n     faith in the principles of our cause and their devotion to the\r\n     right. Our victory was complete, our right of peaceful assemblage\r\n     maintained, without any active demonstration of hostility from\r\n     the indignant citizens who had fiercely resolved that the\r\n     Anti-Slavery Fair should be suppressed. Such demonstrations were,\r\n     doubtless, restrained by a knowledge of the fact that they would\r\n     be met by vigorous and effectual opposition by the Mayor of the\r\n     city, who, upon that occasion, as upon many other similar ones,\r\n     was faithful to the responsibility of his office.\r\n\r\n     In the year 1862 the nation was convulsed with the war consequent\r\n     upon the Southern Rebellion; our soldiers, wounded and dying in\r\n     hospitals and on battle-fields; claimed all possible aid from the\r\n     community; anti-slavery sentiments were spreading widely through\r\n     the North, and it was believed to be feasible and expedient to\r\n     obtain the funds needful for our enterprise by direct appeal to\r\n     the old and new friends of the cause. Therefore, our series of\r\n     fairs closed with the twenty-sixth, in December, 1861.\r\n\r\n     The money raised by this Society in various ways amounted to\r\n     about $35,000. Nearly the whole of this revenue has been expended\r\n     in disseminating the principles of our cause, by means of printed\r\n     documents and public lectures and discussions. In the earlier\r\n     years of this Society, a school for colored children, established\r\n     and taught by Sarah M. Douglass, was partially sustained from our\r\n     treasury. We occasionally contributed, from our treasury, small\r\n     sums for the use of the Vigilance Committees, organized to assist\r\n     fugitive slaves who passed through this State on their way to a\r\n     land where their right to liberty would be protected. But these\r\n     enterprises were always regarded as of secondary importance to\r\n     our great work of direct appeal to the conscience of the nation,\r\n     in behalf of the slave's claim to immediate, unconditional\r\n     emancipation. To this end a large number of tracts and pamphlets\r\n     have been circulated by this Society; but its chief agencies have\r\n     been the anti-slavery newspapers of the country. Regarding these\r\n     as the most powerful instrumentalities in the creation of that\r\n     public sentiment which was essential to the overthrow of slavery,\r\n     we expended a considerable portion of our funds in the direct\r\n     circulation of _The Liberator_, _The Pennsylvania Freeman_, and\r\n     _The National Anti-Slavery Standard_, and a small amount in the\r\n     circulation of other anti-slavery papers. Our largest\r\n     appropriations of money have been made to the Pennsylvania and\r\n     American Anti-Slavery Societies, and by those Societies to the\r\n     support of their organs and lecturing agents.\r\n\r\n     The financial statistics of this Society are easily recorded.\r\n     Certain great and thrilling events which marked its history are\r\n     easily told and written. But the life which it lived through all\r\n     its thirty-six years; the influence which flowed from it,\r\n     directly and indirectly, to the nation's heart; the work quietly\r\n     done by its members, individually, through the word spoken in\r\n     season, the brave, self-sacrificing deed, the example of fidelity\r\n     in a critical hour, the calm endurance unto the end; these can be\r\n     written in no earthly book of remembrance. Its life is lived; its\r\n     work is done; its memorial is sealed. It assembles to-day to take\r\n     one parting look across its years; to breathe in silence its\r\n     unutterable thanksgiving; to disband its membership, and cease to\r\n     be. Reviewing its experience of labor and endurance, the united\r\n     voices of its members testify that it has been a service whose\r\n     reward was in itself; and contemplating the grandeur of the work\r\n     accomplished (in which it has been permitted to bear a humble\r\n     part), the overthrow of American slavery, the uplifting from\r\n     chattelhood to citizenship of four millions of human souls; with\r\n     one heart and one voice we cry, \"Not unto us, O Lord! not unto\r\n     us, but unto Thy name\" be the glory; for Thy right hand and Thy\r\n     holy arm \"hath gotten the victory.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1838, Philadelphia was the scene of one of the most disgraceful\r\nmobs that marked those eventful days. The lovers of free speech had\r\nfound great difficulty in procuring churches or halls in which to\r\npreach the anti-slavery gospel. Accordingly, a number of individuals\r\nof all sects and no sect, of all parties and no party, erected a\r\nbuilding wherein the principles of Liberty and Equality could be\r\nfreely discussed.\r\n\r\nDavid Paul Brown, one of Pennsylvania's most distinguished lawyers,\r\nwas invited to give the oration dedicating this hall to \"Freedom and\r\nthe Rights of Man.\" In accepting the invitation, he said:\r\n\r\n     For some time past I have invariably declined applications that\r\n     might be calculated to take any portion of my time from my\r\n     profession. But I always said, and now say again, that I will\r\n     fight the battle of liberty as long as I have a shot in the\r\n     locker. Of course, I will do what you require.\r\n\r\n                      Yours truly,                   DAVID PAUL BROWN.\r\n     S. WEBB and WM. H. SCOTT, Esqs.\r\n\r\nWhenever fugitives were arrested on the soil of Pennsylvania, this\r\nlawyer stood ready, free of charge, to use in their behalf his skill\r\nand every fair interpretation of the letter and spirit of the law, and\r\navailing himself of every quirk for postponements, thus adding to the\r\nexpense and anxiety of the pursuer, and giving the engineers of the\r\nunderground railroad added opportunities to run the fugitive to\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania Hall was one of the most commodious and splendid\r\nbuildings in the city, scientifically ventilated and brilliantly\r\nlighted with gas. It cost upward of $40,000. Over the forum, in large\r\ngold letters, was the motto, \"Virtue, Liberty, Independence.\" On the\r\nplatform were superb chairs, sofas, and desk covered with blue silk\r\ndamask; everything throughout the hall was artistic and complete.\r\nAbolitionists from all parts of the country hastened to be present at\r\nthe dedication; and among the rest came representatives of the Woman's\r\nNational Convention, held in New York one year before.\r\n\r\nNotices had been posted about the city threatening the speedy\r\ndestruction of this temple of liberty. During this three days'\r\nConvention, the enemy was slowly organizing the destructive mob that\r\nfinally burned that grand edifice to the ground. There were a large\r\nnumber of strangers in the city from the South, and many Southern\r\nstudents attending the medical college, who were all active in the\r\nriot. The crowds of women and colored people who had attended the\r\nConvention intensified the exasperation of the mob. Black men and\r\nwhite women walking side by side in and out of the hall, was too much\r\nfor the foreign plebeian and the Southern patrician.\r\n\r\nAs it was announced that on the evening of the third day some ladies\r\nwere to speak, a howling mob surrounded the building. In the midst of\r\nthe tumult Mr. Garrison introduced Maria Chapman,[63] of Boston, who\r\nrose, and waving her hand to the audience to become quiet, tried in a\r\nfew eloquent and appropriate remarks to bespeak a hearing for Angelina\r\nE. Grimké, the gifted orator from South Carolina, who, having lived in\r\nthe midst of slavery all her life, could faithfully describe its\r\ncruelties and abominations. But the indescribable uproar outside,\r\ncries of fire, and yells of defiance, were a constant interruption,\r\nand stones thrown against the windows a warning of coming danger. But\r\nthrough it all this brave Southern woman stood unmoved, except by the\r\nintense earnestness of her own great theme.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ANGELINA GRIMKÉ'S ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n     Do you ask, \"What has the North to do with slavery?\" Hear it,\r\n     hear it! Those voices without tell us that the spirit of slavery\r\n     is _here_, and has been roused to wrath by our Conventions; for\r\n     surely liberty would not foam and tear herself with rage, because\r\n     her friends are multiplied daily, and meetings are held in quick\r\n     succession to set forth her virtues and extend her peaceful\r\n     kingdom. This opposition shows that slavery has done its\r\n     deadliest work in the hearts of our citizens. Do you ask, then,\r\n     \"What has the North to do?\" I answer, cast out first the spirit\r\n     of slavery from your own hearts, and then lend your aid to\r\n     convert the South. Each one present has a work to do, be his or\r\n     her situation what it may, however limited their means or\r\n     insignificant their supposed influence. The great men of this\r\n     country will not do this work; the Church will never do it. A\r\n     desire to please the world, to keep the favor of all parties and\r\n     of all conditions, makes them dumb on this and every other\r\n     unpopular subject.\r\n\r\n     As a Southerner, I feel that it is my duty to stand up here\r\n     to-night and bear testimony against slavery. I have seen it! I\r\n     have seen it! I know it has horrors that can never be described.\r\n     I was brought up under its wing. I witnessed for many years its\r\n     demoralizing influences and its destructiveness to human\r\n     happiness. I have never seen a happy slave. I have seen him dance\r\n     in his chains, it is true, but he was not happy. There is a wide\r\n     difference between happiness and mirth. Man can not enjoy\r\n     happiness while his manhood is destroyed. Slaves, however, may\r\n     be, and sometimes are mirthful. When hope is extinguished, they\r\n     say, \"Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.\" [Here stones\r\n     were thrown at the windows--a great noise without and commotion\r\n     within].\r\n\r\n     What is a mob? what would the breaking of every window be? What\r\n     would the levelling of this hall be? Any evidence that we are\r\n     wrong, or that slavery is a good and wholesome institution? What\r\n     if the mob should now burst in upon us, break up our meeting, and\r\n     commit violence upon our persons, would that be anything compared\r\n     with what the slaves endure? No, no; and we do not remember them,\r\n     \"as bound with them,\" if we shrink in the time of peril, or feel\r\n     unwilling to sacrifice ourselves, if need be, for their sake.\r\n     [Great noise]. I thank the Lord that there is yet life enough\r\n     left to feel the truth, even though it rages at it; that\r\n     conscience is not so completely seared as to be unmoved by the\r\n     truth of the living God. [Another outbreak of the mob and\r\n     confusion in the house].\r\n\r\n     How wonderfully constituted is the human mind! How it resists, as\r\n     long as it can, all efforts to reclaim it from error! I feel that\r\n     all this disturbance is but an evidence that our efforts are the\r\n     best that could have been adopted, or else the friends of slavery\r\n     would not care for what we say and do. The South know what we do.\r\n     I am thankful that they are reached by our efforts. Many times\r\n     have I wept in the land of my birth over the system of slavery. I\r\n     knew of none who sympathized in my feelings; I was unaware that\r\n     any efforts were made to deliver the oppressed; no voice in the\r\n     wilderness was heard calling on the people to repent and do works\r\n     meet for repentance, and my heart sickened within me. Oh, how\r\n     should I have rejoiced to know that such efforts as these were\r\n     being made. I only wonder that I had such feelings. But in the\r\n     midst of temptation I was preserved, and my sympathy grew warmer,\r\n     and my hatred of slavery more inveterate, until at last I have\r\n     exiled myself from my native land, because I could no longer\r\n     endure to hear the wailing of the slave.\r\n\r\n     I fled to the land of Penn; for here, thought I, sympathy for the\r\n     slave will surely be found. But I found it not. The people were\r\n     kind and hospitable, but the slave had no place in their\r\n     thoughts. I therefore shut up my grief in my own heart. I\r\n     remembered that I was a Carolinian, from a State which framed\r\n     this iniquity by law. Every Southern breeze wafted to me the\r\n     discordant tones of weeping and wailing, shrieks and groans,\r\n     mingled with prayers and blasphemous curses. My heart sank within\r\n     me at the abominations in the midst of which I had been born and\r\n     educated. What will it avail, cried I, in bitterness of spirit,\r\n     to expose to the gaze of strangers the horrors and pollutions of\r\n     slavery, when there is no ear to hear nor heart to feel and pray\r\n     for the slave? But how different do I feel now! Animated with\r\n     hope, nay, with an assurance of the triumph of liberty and\r\n     good-will to man, I will lift up my voice like a trumpet, and\r\n     show this people what they can do to influence the Southern mind\r\n     and overthrow slavery. [Shouting, and stones against the\r\n     windows].\r\n\r\n     We often hear the question asked, \"What shall we do?\" Here is an\r\n     opportunity. Every man and every woman present may do something,\r\n     by showing that we fear not a mob, and in the midst of revilings\r\n     and threatenings, pleading the cause of those who are ready to\r\n     perish. Let me urge every one to buy the books written on this\r\n     subject; read them, and lend them to your neighbors. Give your\r\n     money no longer for things which pander to pride and lust, but\r\n     aid in scattering \"the living coals of truth upon the naked heart\r\n     of the nation\"; in circulating appeals to the sympathies of\r\n     Christians in behalf of the outraged slave.\r\n\r\n     But it is said by some, our \"books and papers do not speak the\r\n     truth\"; why, then, do they not contradict what we say? They can\r\n     not. Moreover, the South has entreated, nay, commanded us, to be\r\n     silent; and what greater evidence of the truth of our\r\n     publications could be desired?\r\n\r\n     Women of Philadelphia! allow me as a Southern woman, with much\r\n     attachment to the land of my birth, to entreat you to come up to\r\n     this work. Especially, let me urge you to petition. Men may\r\n     settle this and other questions at the ballot-box, but you have\r\n     no such right. It is only through petitions that you can reach\r\n     the Legislature. It is, therefore, peculiarly your duty to\r\n     petition. Do you say, \"It does no good!\" The South already turns\r\n     pale at the number sent. They have read the reports of the\r\n     proceedings of Congress, and there have seen that among other\r\n     petitions were very many from the women of the North on the\r\n     subject of slavery. Men who hold the rod over slaves rule in the\r\n     councils of the nation; and they deny our right to petition and\r\n     remonstrate against abuses of our sex and our kind. We have these\r\n     rights, however, from our God. Only let us exercise them, and,\r\n     though often turned away unanswered, let us remember the\r\n     influence of importunity upon the unjust judge, and act\r\n     accordingly. The fact that the South looks jealously upon our\r\n     measures shows that they are effectual. There is, therefore, no\r\n     cause for doubting or despair.\r\n\r\n     It was remarked in England that women did much to abolish slavery\r\n     in her colonies. Nor are they now idle. Numerous petitions from\r\n     them have recently been presented to the Queen to abolish\r\n     apprenticeship, with its cruelties, nearly equal to those of the\r\n     system whose place it supplies. One petition, two miles and a\r\n     quarter long, has been presented. And do you think these labors\r\n     will be in vain? Let the history of the past answer. When the\r\n     women of these States send up to Congress such a petition our\r\n     legislators will arise, as did those of England, and say: \"When\r\n     all the maids and matrons of the land are knocking at our doors\r\n     we must legislate.\" Let the zeal and love, the faith and works of\r\n     our English sisters quicken ours; that while the slaves continue\r\n     to suffer, and when they shout for deliverance, we may feel the\r\n     satisfaction of \"having done what we could.\"\r\n\r\n     ABBY KELLY, of Lynn, Massachusetts, rose, and said: I ask\r\n     permission to pay a few words. I have never before addressed a\r\n     promiscuous assembly; nor is it now the maddening rush of those\r\n     voices, which is the indication of a moral whirlwind; nor is it\r\n     the crashing of those windows, which is the indication of a moral\r\n     earthquake, that calls me before you. No, these pass unheeded by\r\n     me. But it is the \"still small voice within,\" which may not be\r\n     withstood, that bids me open my mouth for the dumb; that bids me\r\n     plead the cause of God's perishing poor; aye, _God's_ poor.\r\n\r\n     The parable of Lazarus and the rich man we may well bring home\r\n     to ourselves. The North is that rich man. How he is clothed in\r\n     purple and fine linen, and fares sumptuously! Yonder, yonder, at\r\n     a little distance, is the gate where lies the Lazarus of the\r\n     South, full of sores and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that\r\n     fall from our luxurious table. Look! see him there! even the dogs\r\n     are more merciful than we. Oh, see him where he lies! We have\r\n     long, very long, passed by with averted eyes. Ought not we to\r\n     raise him up; and is there one in this Hall who sees nothing for\r\n     himself to do?\r\n\r\n     LUCRETIA MOTT, of Philadelphia, then stated that the present was\r\n     not a meeting of the Anti-Slavery Convention of American women,\r\n     as was supposed by some, and explained the reason why their\r\n     meetings were confined to females; namely, that many of the\r\n     members considered it improper for women to address promiscuous\r\n     assemblies. She hoped that such false notions of delicacy and\r\n     propriety would not long obtain in this enlightened country.\r\n\r\nWhile the large Hall was filled with a promiscuous audience, and\r\npacked through all its sessions with full three thousand people, the\r\nwomen held their Convention in one of the committee-rooms. As they had\r\nbeen through terrible mobs already in Boston and New York, they had\r\nlearned self-control, and with their coolness and consecration to the\r\nprinciples they advocated, they were a constant inspiration to the men\r\nby their side.\r\n\r\nThe Second National Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women\r\nassembled in the lecture-room of Pennsylvania Hall in Philadelphia,\r\nMay 15, 1838, at ten o'clock A.M. The following officers were\r\nappointed:\r\n\r\n     PRESIDENT--Mary L. Parker, of Boston.\r\n\r\n     VICE-PRESIDENTS--Maria Weston Chapman, Catharine M. Sullivan,\r\n     Susan Paul, of Boston, Mass.; Mariana Johnson, Providence, R. I.;\r\n     Margaret Prior, Sarah T. Smith, of New York; Martha W. Storrs, of\r\n     Utica, N. Y.; Lucretia Mott, of Philadelphia; Mary W. Magill, of\r\n     Buckingham, Pa.; Sarah Moore Grimké, of Charleston, S. C.\r\n\r\n     SECRETARIES--Anne W. Weston, Martha V. Ball, of Boston; Juliana\r\n     A. Tappan, of New York; Sarah Lewis, of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n     TREASURER--Sarah M. Douglass, of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n     BUSINESS COMMITTEE--Sarah T. Smith, Sarah R. Ingraham, Margaret\r\n     Dye, Juliana A. Tappan, Martha W. Storrs, New York; Miriam\r\n     Hussey, Maine; Louisa Whipple, New Hampshire; Lucy N. Dodge,\r\n     Miriam B, Johnson, Maria Truesdell, Waity A. Spencer, Rebecca\r\n     Pittman, Rhode Island; Lucretia Mott, Mary Grew, Sarah M.\r\n     Douglass, Hetty Burr, Martha Smith, Pennsylvania; Angelina Grimké\r\n     Weld, South Carolina.\r\n\r\n     On motion of SARAH PUSH, Elizabeth M. Southard, Mary G. Chapman,\r\n     and Abby Kelly were appointed a committee to confer with other\r\n     associations and the managers of Pennsylvania Hall to arrange for\r\n     meetings during the week.\r\n\r\n     SARAH T. SMITH, from the Business Committee, presented letters\r\n     from the Female Anti-Slavery Societies of Salem and\r\n     Cambridgeport, Massachusetts, signed by their respective\r\n     secretaries, Mary Spencer and L. Williams.\r\n\r\nAt this time, even the one and only right of woman, that of petition,\r\nhad been trampled under the heel of slavery on the floor of Congress,\r\nwhich roused those noble women to a just indignation, as will be seen\r\nin their resolutions on the subject, presented by Juliana A. Tappan:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That whatever may be the sacrifice, and whatever\r\n     other rights may be yielded or denied, we will maintain\r\n     practically the right of petition until the slave shall go free,\r\n     or our energies, like Lovejoy's, are paralyzed in death.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That for every petition rejected by the National\r\n     Legislature during their last session, we will endeavor to send\r\n     five the present year; and that we will not cease our efforts\r\n     until the prayers of every woman within the sphere of our\r\n     influence shall be heard in the halls of Congress on this\r\n     subject.\r\n\r\nMARY GREW offered the following resolution, which was adopted:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The disciples of Christ are commanded to have no\r\n     fellowship with the \"unfruitful works of darkness\"; and\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, Union in His Church is the strongest expression of\r\n     fellowship between men; therefore\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is our duty to keep ourselves separate from\r\n     those churches which receive to their pulpits and their communion\r\n     tables those who buy, or sell, or hold as property, the image of\r\n     the living God.\r\n\r\nThis resolution was supported by Miss Grew, Lucretia Mott, Abby Kelly,\r\nMaria W. Chapman, Anne W. Weston, Sarah T. Smith, and Sarah Lewis; and\r\nopposed by Margaret Dye, Margaret Prior, Henrietta Wilcox, Martha W.\r\nStorrs, Juliana A. Tappan, Elizabeth M. Southard, and Charlotte\r\nWoolsey. Those who voted in the negative stated that they fully\r\nconcurred with their sisters in the belief that slaveholders and their\r\napologists were guilty before God, and that with the former, Northern\r\nChristians should hold no fellowship; but that, as it was their full\r\nbelief that there was moral power sufficient in the Church, if rightly\r\napplied, to purify it, they could not feel it their duty to withdraw\r\nuntil the utter inefficiency of the means used should constrain them\r\nto believe the Church totally corrupt. And as an expression of their\r\nviews, Margaret Dye moved the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the system of American slavery is contrary to\r\n     the laws of God and the spirit of true religion, and that the\r\n     Church is deeply implicated in this sin, and that it therefore\r\n     becomes the imperative duty of her members to petition their\r\n     ecclesiastical bodies to enter their decided protests against it,\r\n     and exclude slaveholders from their pulpits and communion tables.\r\n\r\nThe last session was opened by the reading of the sixth chapter of 2\r\nCorinthians, and prayer by Sarah M. Grimké. An Address to Anti-Slavery\r\nSocieties was read by Sarah T. Smith, and adopted. We copy from it the\r\nplea and argument for woman's right and duty to be interested in all\r\nquestions of public welfare:\r\n\r\n                   ADDRESS TO ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETIES.\r\n\r\n     DEAR FRIENDS:--In that love for our cause which knows not the\r\n     fear of man, we address you in confidence that our motives will\r\n     be understood and regarded. We fear not censure from you for\r\n     going beyond the circle which has been drawn around us by\r\n     physical force, by mental usurpation, by the usages of ages; not\r\n     any one of which can we admit gives the right to prescribe it;\r\n     else might the monarchs of the old world sit firmly on their\r\n     thrones, the nobility of Europe lord it over the man of low\r\n     degree, and the chains we are now seeking to break, continue\r\n     riveted, on the neck of the slave. Our faith goes not back to the\r\n     wigwam of the savage, or the castle of the feudal chief, but\r\n     would rather soar with hope to that period when \"right alone\r\n     shall make might\"; when the truncheon and the sword shall lie\r\n     useless; when the intellect and heart shall speak and be obeyed;\r\n     when \"He alone whose right it is shall rule and reign in the\r\n     hearts of the children of men.\"\r\n\r\n     We are told that it is not within \"the province of woman\" to\r\n     discuss the subject of slavery; that it is a \"political\r\n     question,\" and that we are \"stepping out of our sphere\" when we\r\n     take part in its discussion. It is not true that it is merely a\r\n     political question; it is likewise a question of justice, of\r\n     humanity, of morality, of religion; a question which, while it\r\n     involves considerations of immense importance to the welfare, and\r\n     prosperity of our country, enters deeply into the home--concerns\r\n     the every-day feelings of millions of our fellow beings. Whether\r\n     the laborer shall receive the reward of his labor, or be driven\r\n     daily to unrequited toil: whether he shall walk erect in the\r\n     dignity of conscious manhood, or be reckoned among the beasts\r\n     which perish; whether his bones and sinews shall be his own, or\r\n     another's; whether his child shall receive the protection of its\r\n     natural guardian, or be ranked among the live-stock of the\r\n     estate, to be disposed of as the caprice or interest of the\r\n     master may dictate; whether the sun of knowledge shall irradiate\r\n     the hut of the peasant, or the murky cloud of ignorance brood\r\n     darkly over it; whether \"every one shall have the liberty to\r\n     worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience,\" or\r\n     man assume the prerogative of Jehovah and impiously seek to plant\r\n     himself upon the throne of the Almighty. These considerations are\r\n     all involved in the question of liberty or slavery.\r\n\r\n     And is a subject comprehending interests of such magnitude,\r\n     merely a \"political question,\" and one in which woman \"can take\r\n     no part without losing something of the modesty and gentleness\r\n     which are her most appropriate ornaments\"? May not the \"ornament\r\n     of a meek and quiet spirit\" exist with an upright mind and\r\n     enlightened intellect? Must woman necessarily be less gentle\r\n     because her heart is open to the claims of humanity, or less\r\n     modest because she feels for the degradation of her enslaved\r\n     sisters, and would stretch forth her hand for their rescue?\r\n\r\n     By the Constitution of the United States, the whole physical\r\n     power of the North is pledged for the suppression of domestic\r\n     insurrections; and should the slaves maddened by oppression\r\n     endeavor to shake off the yoke of the task-master, the men of the\r\n     North are bound to make common cause with the tyrant, to put down\r\n     at the point of the bayonet every effort on the part of the slave\r\n     for the attainment of his freedom. And when the father, husband,\r\n     son, and brother shall have left their homes to mingle in the\r\n     unholy warfare; \"to become the executioners of their brethren, or\r\n     to fall themselves by their hands,\" will the mother, wife,\r\n     daughter, and sister feel that they have no interest in this\r\n     subject? Will it be easy to convince them that it is no concern\r\n     of theirs, that their homes are rendered desolate and their\r\n     habitations the abodes of wretchedness? Surely this consideration\r\n     is of itself sufficient to arouse the slumbering energies of\r\n     woman, for the overthrow of a system which thus threatens to lay\r\n     in ruins the fabric of her domestic happiness; and she will not\r\n     be deterred from the performance of her duty to herself, her\r\n     family, and her country, by the cry of \"political question.\"\r\n\r\n     But, admitting it to be a political question, have we no interest\r\n     in the welfare of our country? May we not permit a thought to\r\n     stray beyond the narrow limits of our own family circle and of\r\n     the present hour? May we not breathe a sigh over the miseries of\r\n     our countrywomen nor utter a word of remonstrance against the\r\n     unjust laws that are crushing them to the earth? Must we witness\r\n     \"the headlong rage of heedless folly\" with which our nation is\r\n     rushing onward to destruction, and not seek to arrest its\r\n     downward course? Shall we silently behold the land which we love\r\n     with all the heart-warm affection of children, rendered a hissing\r\n     and a reproach throughout the world by the system which is\r\n     already \"tolling the death-knell of her decease among the\r\n     nations\"?\r\n\r\n     No; the events of the last two years have \"cast their dark\r\n     shadows before,\" overclouding the bright prospects of the future,\r\n     and shrouding our country in more than midnight gloom; and we can\r\n     not remain inactive. Our country is as dear to us as to the\r\n     proudest statesman; and the more closely our hearts cling to \"our\r\n     altars and our homes,\" the more fervent are our aspirations, that\r\n     every inhabitant of our land may be protected in his fireside\r\n     enjoyments by just and equal laws; that the foot of the tyrant\r\n     may no longer invade the domestic sanctuary, nor his hand tear\r\n     asunder those whom God himself has united by the most holy ties.\r\n\r\n     Let our course then still be onward! Justice, humanity,\r\n     patriotism; every high and every holy motive urge us forward, and\r\n     we dare not refuse to obey. The way of duty lies open before us,\r\n     and though no pillar of fire be visible to the outward sense, yet\r\n     an unerring light shall illumine our pathway, guiding us through\r\n     the sea of persecution and the wilderness of prejudice and\r\n     error, to the promised land of freedom, where \"every man shall\r\n     sit under his own vine and fig-tree, and none shall make him\r\n     afraid.\"\r\n\r\nTHANKFUL SOUTHWICK[64] moved the following:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is the duty of all those who call themselves\r\n     Abolitionists, to make the most vigorous efforts to procure for\r\n     the use of their families the products of FREE LABOR, so that\r\n     their hands may be clean in this particular when inquisition is\r\n     made for blood.\r\n\r\n     ESTHER MOORE made remarks upon the importance of carrying into\r\n     effect the resolutions that had been passed.\r\n\r\nThis was the last meeting held in Pennsylvania Hall! Business\r\nconnected with the safety of the building made it necessary for\r\nmembers of the board of managers to pass several times through the\r\nsaloon, when this Convention was in session, and they said\r\n\r\n     they never saw a more dignified, calm, and intrepid body of\r\n     persons assembled. Although the building was surrounded all day\r\n     by the mob who crowded about the doors, and at times even\r\n     attempted to enter the saloon, yet the women were perfectly\r\n     collected, unmoved by the threatening tempest. The cause which\r\n     they were assembled to promote is one that nerves the soul to\r\n     deeds of noble daring. The Convention had already adjourned late\r\n     in the afternoon, when the mob which destroyed the building began\r\n     to assemble. The doors were blocked up by the crowd, and the\r\n     streets almost impassable from the multitude of \"fellows of the\r\n     baser sort.\" But these \"American Women\" passed through the whole\r\n     without manifesting any sign of fear, as if conscious of their\r\n     own greatness and of the protecting care of the God of the\r\n     oppressed.\r\n\r\nWe give our readers these interesting pages of anti-slavery history\r\nbecause they were the initiative steps to organized public action and\r\nthe Woman Suffrage Movement _per se_, and to show how much more\r\nenthusiasm women manifested in securing freedom for the slaves, than\r\nthey ever have in demanding justice and equality for themselves. Where\r\nare the societies to rescue unfortunate women from the bondage they\r\nsuffer under unjust law? Where are the loving friends who keep\r\nmidnight vigils with young girls arraigned in the courts for\r\ninfanticide? Where are the underground railroads and watchful friends\r\nat every point to help fugitive wives from brutal husbands? The most\r\nintelligent, educated women seem utterly oblivious to the wrongs of\r\ntheir own sex; even those who so bravely fought the anti-slavery\r\nbattle have never struck as stout blows against the tyranny suffered\r\nby women.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, the resolution presented by Mary Grew, and passed\r\nin the Woman's Anti-Slavery Convention forty-three years ago,\r\ndeclaring that it was the Christian duty of every woman to withdraw\r\nfrom all churches that fellowshiped with slavery, which was a sin\r\nagainst God and man. Compare the conscience and religious earnestness\r\nfor a principle implied in such a resolution with the apathy and\r\nsupineness of the women of to-day. No such resolution has ever yet\r\npassed a woman's rights convention. And yet is injustice to a colored\r\nman a greater sin than to a woman? Is liberty and equality more sweet\r\nto him than to her! Is the declaration by the Church that woman may\r\nnot be ordained or licensed to preach the Gospel, no matter how well\r\nfitted, how learned or devout, because of her sex, less insulting and\r\ndegrading than the old custom of the negro pew?\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Church to-day is more hostile and insulting to\r\nAmerican womanhood than it ever was to the black man, by just so much\r\nas women are nearer the equals of priests and bishops than were the\r\nunlettered slaves. When women refuse to enter churches that do not\r\nrecognize them as equal candidates for the joys of earth and heaven,\r\nequal in the sight of man and God, we shall have a glorious revival\r\nof liberty and justice everywhere.\r\n\r\nHow fully these pages of history illustrate the equal share woman has\r\nhad in the trials and triumphs of all the political and moral\r\nrevolutions through which we have passed, from feeble colonies to an\r\nindependent nation; suffering with man the miseries of poverty and\r\nwar, all the evils of bad government, and enjoying with him the\r\nblessings of luxury and peace, and a wise administration of law. The\r\nexperience of the heroines of anti-slavery show that no finespun\r\nsentimentalism in regard to woman's position in the clouds ever exempt\r\nher from the duties or penalties of a citizen. Neither State officers,\r\nnor mobs in the whirlwind of passion, tempered their violence for her\r\nsafety or benefit.\r\n\r\nWhen women proposed to hold a fair in Concert Hall, their flag was\r\ntorn down from the street, while they and their property were ejected\r\nby the high constable. When women were speaking in Pennsylvania Hall,\r\nbrickbats were hurled at, them through the windows. When women\r\nsearched Philadelphia through for a place where they might meet to\r\nspeak and pray for the slave-mother and her child (the most miserable\r\nof human beings), halls and churches were closed against them. And who\r\nwere these women? Eloquent speakers, able writers, dignified wives and\r\nmothers, the most moral, religious, refined, cultured, intelligent\r\ncitizens that Massachusetts, New York, South Carolina, and\r\nPennsylvania could boast. There never was a queen on any European\r\nthrone possessed of more personal beauty, grace, and dignity than\r\nMaria Weston Chapman.[65] The calmness and impassioned earnestness of\r\nAngelina Grimké, speaking nearly an hour 'mid that howling mob, was\r\nnot surpassed in courage and consecration even by Paul among the wild\r\nbeasts at Ephesus. Here she made her last public speech, and as the\r\nglowing words died upon her lips, a new voice was heard, rich, deep,\r\nand clear upon the troubled air; and the mantle of self-sacrifice, so\r\nfaithfully worn by South Carolina's brave daughter, henceforth rested\r\non the shoulders of an equally brave and eloquent Quaker girl from\r\nMassachusetts,[66] who for many years afterward preached the same glad\r\ntidings of justice, equality, and liberty for all.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERANCE.\r\n\r\nIn this reform, also, the women of Pennsylvania took an equally active\r\npart. We are indebted to Hannah Darlington, of Kennett Square, Chester\r\nCo., for the following record of the temperance work in this State:\r\n\r\n                                        KENNETT SQUARE, 2 mo., 6, 1881.\r\n\r\n     DEAR MRS. STANTON:--I did not think our early temperance work of\r\n     sufficient account to preserve the reports, hence with\r\n     considerable research am able to send you but very little. Many\r\n     mixed meetings were held through the county before 1847.\r\n     Woods-meetings, with decorated stands, were fashionable in\r\n     Chester in warm weather, for several years before we branched off\r\n     with a call for a public meeting. That brought quite a number\r\n     together in Friends' Meeting-house at Kennett Square, where we\r\n     discussed plans for work and appointed committees to carry them\r\n     out.\r\n\r\n     Sidney Peirce, Ann Preston, and myself, each prepared addresses\r\n     to read at meetings called in such places as the Committee\r\n     arranged; and with Chandler Darlington to drive us from place to\r\n     place, we addressed many large audiences, some in the day-time\r\n     and some in the evening; scattered appeals and tracts, and\r\n     collected names to petitions asking for a law against licensing\r\n     liquor-stands.\r\n\r\n     In 1848, we went to Harrisburg, taking an address to the\r\n     Legislature written by Ann Preston, and sanctioned by the meeting\r\n     that appointed us. The address, with our credentials and\r\n     petitions, was presented to the two Houses, read in our presence,\r\n     and referred to the Committee on \"Vice and Immorality,\" which\r\n     called a meeting and invited us to give our address. Sidney\r\n     Peirce, who was a good reader, gave it with effect to a large\r\n     roomful of the Committee and legislators. It was listened to with\r\n     profound attention, complimented highly, and I think aroused a\r\n     disposition among the best members to give the cause of\r\n     temperance more careful consideration. The Local Option Law was\r\n     passed by that Legislature.\r\n\r\n     We also aided the mixed meetings by our presence and addresses,\r\n     and by circulating petitions, and publishing appeals in the\r\n     county papers; helping in every way to arouse discussion and\r\n     prepare the people to sustain the new law. But the Supreme Court\r\n     of the State, through the liquor influence, declared the law\r\n     unconstitutional, after a few months' successful trial. Drinking,\r\n     however, has not been as respectable since that time. We\r\n     continued active work in our association until the inauguration\r\n     of the Good Templars movement, in which men and women worked\r\n     together on terms of equality.\r\n\r\n                    Respectfully yours,      HANNAH M. DARLINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TEMPERANCE CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n     A Temperance Convention of Women of Chester County, met at\r\n     Marlborough Friends' Meeting-house, on Saturday, the 30th of\r\n     December, 1848, and was organized by the appointment of MARTHA\r\n     HAYHURST, President; SIDNEY PEIRCE and HANNAH PENNOCK,\r\n     Secretaries.\r\n\r\n     Letters received by a Committee of Correspondence, appointed at a\r\n     Convention last winter, were read; one, from Pope Bushnell,\r\n     Chairman of the Committee on Vice and Immorality, to which\r\n     temperance petitions were referred; and also from our\r\n     Representatives in the Legislature, pledging themselves to use\r\n     all their influence to obtain the passage of a law to prohibit\r\n     the sale of intoxicating liquors as a beverage amongst us. The\r\n     Business Committee reported addresses to the men and women of\r\n     Chester County, which were considered, amended, and adopted, as\r\n     follows:\r\n\r\n     _To the Women of Chester County_:\r\n\r\n     DEAR SISTERS:--Again we would urge upon you the duty and\r\n     necessity of action in the temperance cause. Notwithstanding the\r\n     exertions that have been made, intoxicating liquors continue to\r\n     be sold and drank in our midst. Still, night after night, the\r\n     miserable drunkard reels to that home he has made desolate.\r\n     Still, wives and sisters weep in anguish as they look on those\r\n     dearer to them than life, and see, trace by trace, their delicacy\r\n     and purity of soul vanishing beneath the destroying libations\r\n     that tempt them when they pass the domestic threshold.\r\n\r\n     We need not depict to you the poverty and crime and unutterable\r\n     woe that result from intemperance, nor need you go far to be\r\n     reminded of the revolting fact, that under the sanction of laws,\r\n     men still make it a deliberate business to deal out that terrible\r\n     agent, the only effect of which is to darken the God-like in the\r\n     human soul, and to foster in its place the appetites of demons.\r\n     The law passed the 7th of April, 1846, under which the sale of\r\n     intoxicating drinks was prohibited by vote of the people in most\r\n     of the townships in Chester County, has been decided by the\r\n     Supreme Court to be unconstitutional; and this decision, by\r\n     inspiring confidence in the dealers and consumers of the fatal\r\n     poison, seems to have given a new impetus to this diabolical\r\n     traffic. Wider and deeper its ravages threaten to extend\r\n     themselves; and to every benevolent mind comes the earnest\r\n     question, What must now be done? It is too late for women to\r\n     excuse themselves from exertion in this cause, on the ground that\r\n     it would be indelicate to leave the sheltered retirement of home.\r\n     Alas! where is the home-shelter that guards the delicacy of the\r\n     drunkard's wife and daughter? We all recognize the divine\r\n     obligation to relieve suffering and to cherish virtue as binding\r\n     alike on man and woman. Our hearts thrill at the mention of those\r\n     women who were \"last at the cross and earliest at the grave\" of\r\n     the crucified Nazarine. We commend her whose prayers and\r\n     entreaties once saved her native Rome from pillage. We admire the\r\n     heroism of a Joan of Arc, as it is embalmed in history and song.\r\n     We boast of virgin martyrs to the faith of their convictions, and\r\n     we dare not now put forth the despicable plea of feminine\r\n     propriety to excuse our supineness, when fathers, sons, and\r\n     brothers are falling around us, degraded, bestialized, thrice\r\n     murdered by this foe at our doors. No! we have solemn obligations\r\n     resting upon us, and we should be unfaithful to the holiest call\r\n     of duty, false to the instincts of womanhood and the pleading\r\n     voice of love, if we should sit quietly down in careless ease\r\n     while vice is thus spreading around us, and human souls are\r\n     falling into the fell snare of the destroyer.\r\n\r\n     By meeting together and taking counsel one with another, we will\r\n     become more alive to our duty in relation to this momentous\r\n     subject. The more we prize the sweet privacy of happy homes, the\r\n     more strong is the appeal to us to labor to make sacred and\r\n     joyful the hearth-stones of others. If _men_ will remain\r\n     comparatively supine we must the more energetically sound the\r\n     alarm, and point them to the danger. If rulers will devise\r\n     wickedness by law, we must give them no rest, till, like the\r\n     unjust judge, they yield to our very importunity, and repeal\r\n     their iniquitous statutes. The temporal and spiritual welfare of\r\n     many an immortal being is at stake, and we should esteem it a\r\n     high privilege to labor in this holy cause with an earnest and,\r\n     if need be, a life-long consecration. Let us, then, apply\r\n     ourselves devotedly to the work, and a fresh and resistless\r\n     impulse will be given to the temperance reformation. The\r\n     electrical fervor of earnest spirits ever communicates itself to\r\n     others, and the Legislature itself can not long resist our united\r\n     efforts. In such a cause \"we have great allies.\" God and humanity\r\n     are on our side, our own souls Will be strengthened and elevated\r\n     by the work; \"failure\" is a word that belongs not to us, since\r\n     our efforts are in a righteous cause.\r\n\r\n     _To the Men of Chester County:_\r\n\r\n     Permit us once more to plead with you on behalf of temperance. We\r\n     know that to some of you this may seem an old and wearisome\r\n     subject, but we know also that the sorrow and crime caused by\r\n     intemperance are _not_ old; new, fresh cases are around us now.\r\n     Its ravages are repeated every day, and we must beseech you to\r\n     \"hear us for our cause.\" We can not be silent while the grog-shop\r\n     stands like the poisonous upas amongst us, and men openly deal\r\n     out crime and wretchedness in the form of intoxicating drinks.\r\n\r\n     We need not in this place enlarge upon the danger ever attendant\r\n     upon the use of those stimulants, nor will we now stop long to\r\n     dwell upon the solemn fact, that whoever, at the demand of\r\n     appetite, drinks even the sweet cider, weakens his own moral\r\n     strength, becomes a tempter to the weak, and casts away the pure\r\n     influence of an unsullied example. Reckless and guilty indeed is\r\n     that man who, in the light of this day, dares to insult humanity\r\n     and defy heaven by publicly putting the glass to his lips.\r\n\r\n     Men of Chester County! you possess the power to put a stop to the\r\n     traffic in liquors, and we conjure you by the sacred obligations\r\n     of virtue and humanity, as you hope to stand acquitted before the\r\n     just tribunal of God, to arise in your might and banish it from\r\n     the community; think, we beseech you, of the depths of pollution\r\n     to which intemperance leads, of the bestial appetites it fosters,\r\n     of all the unnameable impurities that revel in its abodes; think\r\n     of the hearth-stones desolated, of the mothers and daughters\r\n     whose earthly hopes and joys have been destroyed by that\r\n     charnel-house, the tavern. The incendiary who applies the\r\n     midnight torch to peaceful dwellings, the robber who commits\r\n     murder to secure his prey, is not an enemy to society half so\r\n     dangerous, as he who inflames all evil passions and scatters\r\n     wretchedness through a community, by dispensing alcoholic poison.\r\n     Oh! are there not sorrows enough in our best condition? have we\r\n     not temptations strong enough within and without? Shall men\r\n     progress too fast in the \"onward and upward\" road of virtue and\r\n     happiness, that you leave before them these sinks of pollution,\r\n     these trap-doors of ruin, these fatal sirens, enticing the unwary\r\n     listener to destruction? Call us not fanatical. Indifference is\r\n     crime; silence is fatal here. When the midnight cry of fire is\r\n     sounded, you rush from your slumbers, and, heedless of danger,\r\n     hasten to extinguish the flames; but here is a devouring element,\r\n     burning on from year to year, consuming not mere shingles and\r\n     rafters, but the priceless hopes and aspirations of immortal\r\n     souls, leaving blackened ruins in the place of beauty; and we\r\n     must continue to cry \"Fire! fire!\" until you hasten to stop the\r\n     fearful conflagration. Tell us not of liberty and natural right,\r\n     as a plea for this traffic. It is the liberty to rob innocent\r\n     families and reduce them to pauperism; the right to break hearts\r\n     and hopes, to reduce men to demons, to scatter vice and anguish\r\n     and desolation around the land. Well may we exclaim with Madame\r\n     Roland, when she was taken along the bloody streets of Paris,\r\n     about to be murdered in the abused name of freedom, \"Oh, Liberty,\r\n     what crimes are committed in thy name!\"\r\n\r\n     Fathers and brothers, shall woman in her agony, and man in his\r\n     degradation, appeal to you in vain? Too long has this evil been\r\n     borne, too long have minor points of public good taken precedence\r\n     of this reform. It must not be that you will be content to dwell\r\n     in quiet indifference, in the midst of a rum-selling community,\r\n     and die, leaving your children exposed to the tempter's snare. It\r\n     must not be endured that this infernal traffic, this shame to\r\n     civilization, this slur on Christianity, shall continue amongst\r\n     us. It must not be endured that men shall be clothed with the\r\n     monstrous authority to demoralize neighborhoods and scatter the\r\n     fire-brands of death and destruction. The power to arrest this\r\n     horrible work is in your hands. Be vigilant, be active. There is\r\n     resistless might in the energy of earnest wills devoted to a\r\n     noble cause. Petition, remonstrate, work while yet it is day. Say\r\n     not that we can gain nothing by petitioning. Was it not through\r\n     this means, we obtained the law under which a vote of the\r\n     majority excluded the sale of intoxicating liquors amongst us?\r\n     Did not our petitions last winter cause a bill for its\r\n     prohibition to be reported in the Legislature, which was lost in\r\n     the House by a small majority? True, the law we desire may not\r\n     entirely prevent drunkenness, but it will certainly act as a\r\n     restraint. It will make drinking less reputable, and thus prevent\r\n     drunkard-making. It will have the moral influence of a State\r\n     verdict against the practice. The dread responsibility of this\r\n     traffic must rest upon you, if, through silent acquiescence, you\r\n     permit its ravages. Do what you can, and peace and prosperity\r\n     will soon sit where the blackness of ruin has brooded, and the\r\n     sweet reward of approving consciences and the blessings of joyful\r\n     hearts will gladden your pathway.\r\n\r\n     The following resolutions were adopted:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That petitioning the Legislature is the most definite\r\n     and efficient means at our command, whereby to obtain a law to\r\n     abolish the sale of intoxicating drinks, as a beverage amongst\r\n     us.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the following persons be appointed to obtain\r\n     names in their respective neighborhoods, to the petition referred\r\n     to: Sarah Evans, Grace Anna Lewis, Jane Kimber, H. A.\r\n     Pennypacker, Catherine Hawley, Deborah Way, Sarah Wood, M. B.\r\n     Thomas, Anna Parke, Margaret Lea, Susannah Cox, Elizabeth Evans,\r\n     E. Garrett, M. Darlington, Eliza Agnew, M. P. Wilson, Eliza Pyle,\r\n     Mary Chambers, H. M. Barnard, Mrs. Jefferis, Alice Speakman,\r\n     Sarah S. Barnard, Susan Fulton, Mary W. Coates, Millicent Stern,\r\n     Mrs. Ramsey, Mrs. Hamilton, A. E. Valentine, Ruth Ann Seal, R. W.\r\n     Taylor, M. K. Darlington, Lydia Agnew, M. Taylor, Alice Lewis,\r\n     Ann Barnard, Rebecca Pugh, Lydia Jacobs, Margaret Ross, Rachel\r\n     Leake, Ann Preston, M. W.

AGNEW, }\r\n\r\n\r\n     NORTH AMERICAN AND UNITED STATE GAZETTE, FEB. 6, 1852.\r\n\r\n     The ladies of the City and County of Philadelphia, and all other\r\n     persons who feel impressed with the importance of PETITIONING THE\r\n     LEGISLATURE TO ENACT A LAW PROHIBITING THE USE OF ALL\r\n     INTOXICATING DRINKS as a beverage, are earnestly requested to\r\n     attend a meeting to be held at the CHINESE MUSEUM, corner of\r\n     NINTH and GEORGE STREETS, on SATURDAY EVENING, Feb. 7th, at 7-1/2\r\n     o'clock.\r\n\r\n     The meeting will be addressed by the REV. ALBERT BARNES, REV.\r\n     JOHN CHAMBERS, JUDGE KELLEY, DR. JAS. BRYAN, and WM. J. MULLEN.\r\n     JUDGE ALLISON will preside. The LADIES' TEMPERANCE UNION is\r\n     particularly invited to attend. Admittance five cents, to defray\r\n     expenses.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks after this, Feb. 21st, a Woman's Temperance Mass Meeting was\r\nheld in Philadelphia; an immense assemblage of both sexes.\r\n\r\n_The Pennsylvania Freeman_ of March 4, 1852, says: \"A large number of\r\npetitions from various parts of the State, most of them numerously\r\nsigned, asking for the passage of the Maine Anti-Liquor Law, have been\r\npresented in both Houses. On Tuesday, in the Senate, one was presented\r\nfrom this city signed by 15,580 ladies; and another in the House,\r\nsigned by 14,241 ladies. What the Legislature will do we shall not\r\nventure to predict.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note the same successive steps in every State,\r\nand how naturally, in laboring for anti-slavery and temperance, women\r\nhave at last in each case demanded freedom for themselves. In the\r\nanti-slavery school, 'mid violence and persecution they learned the\r\na, b, c of individual rights; in the temperance struggle they learned\r\nthat the ultimate power in moral movements is found in wise\r\nlegislation, and in graduating on the woman suffrage platform, they\r\nhave learned that prayers and tears are worth little until coined into\r\nlaw, and that to command the attention of legislators, petitioners\r\nmust represent votes.\r\n\r\nA moral power that has no direct influence on the legislation of a\r\nnation, is an abstraction, and might as well be expended in the clouds\r\nas outside of codes and constitutions, and this has too long been the\r\nrealm where women have spent their energies fighting shadows. The\r\npower that makes laws, and baptizes them as divine at every church\r\naltar, is the power for woman to demand now and forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTCHESTER CONVENTION. _June 2, 1852_.\r\n\r\nThe first Woman's Rights Convention held in Pennsylvania was called in\r\nthe leafy month of June, in the quiet Quaker town of West Chester, in\r\none of the loveliest regions of that State. Chester County had long\r\nbeen noted for its reform movements and flourishing schools, in which\r\nthe women generally took a deep interest.\r\n\r\nIt was among these beautiful hills that Bayard Taylor lived and wrote\r\nhis \"Hannah Thurston,\" a most contemptible burlesque of his own\r\nneighbors and the reforms they advocated.\r\n\r\nKennett Square and Longwood have for years been noted for their\r\nliberal religious meetings, in which the leading reformers of the\r\nnation have in turn been annually represented. In those gatherings of\r\nthe Progressive Friends, all the questions of the hour were freely\r\ndiscussed, and their printed testimonies sent forth to enlighten the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe Convention assembled at ten o'clock in Horticultural Hall, and was\r\ncalled to order by Lucretia Mott, and the following officers chosen:\r\n\r\n     PRESIDENT.--Mariana Johnson.\r\n\r\n     SERVICE-PRESIDENTS.--Mary Ann Fulton, William Jackson, Chandler\r\n     Darlington.\r\n\r\n     SECRETARIES.--Sarah L. Miller, Hannah Darlington, Sidney Peirce,\r\n     Edward Webb.\r\n\r\n     BUSINESS COMMITTEE.--James Mott, Ann Preston, Lucretia Mott,\r\n     Frances D. Gage, Sarah D. Barnard, Dr. Harriot K. Hunt, Joseph A.\r\n     Dugdale, Margaret Jones, Ernestine L. Rose, Alice Jackson, Jacob\r\n     Painter, Phebe Goodwin.\r\n\r\n     FINANCE COMMITTEE, appointed by the Chair.--Hannah Darlington,\r\n     Jacob Painter, Isaac Mendenhall, Elizabeth Miller.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Mott read the following call:\r\n\r\n     The friends of Justice and Equal Rights are earnestly invited to\r\n     assemble in Convention, to consider and discuss the present\r\n     position of Woman in Society, her Natural Eights and Relative\r\n     Duties.\r\n\r\n     The reasons for such a Convention are obvious. With few\r\n     exceptions, both the radical and conservative portions of the\r\n     community agree that woman, even in this progressive age and\r\n     country, suffers under legal, educational, and vocational\r\n     disabilities which ought to be removed. To examine the nature of\r\n     these disabilities, to inquire into their extent, and to consider\r\n     the most feasible and proper mode of removing them, will be the\r\n     aim of the Convention which it is proposed to hold.\r\n\r\n     If it shall promote in any degree freedom of thought and action\r\n     among women; if it shall assist in opening to them any avenues to\r\n     honorable and lucrative employment (now unjustly and unwisely\r\n     closed); if it shall aid in securing to them more thorough\r\n     intellectual and moral culture; if it shall excite higher\r\n     aspirations; if it shall advance by a few steps just and wise\r\n     public sentiment, it will not have been held in vain.\r\n\r\n     The elevation of woman is the elevation of the human race. Her\r\n     interests can not be promoted or injured without advantage or\r\n     injury to the whole race. The call for such a Convention is\r\n     therefore addressed to those who desire the physical,\r\n     intellectual, and moral improvement of mankind. All persons\r\n     interested in its objects are respectfully requested to be\r\n     present at its sessions and participate in its deliberations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS\r\n\r\n     The position in which woman has been placed is an anomaly. On the\r\n     one hand she is constantly reminded of duties and\r\n     responsibilities from which an angel might shrink. The world is\r\n     to be saved by her prayers, her quiet and gentle efforts. Man,\r\n     she is told, is ruled by her smiles; his whole nature subdued by\r\n     the potency of her tears. Priests, politicians, and poets assure\r\n     her with flattering tongue, that on her depend the progress and\r\n     destiny of the race. On the other hand, she is told that she must\r\n     lovingly confide in the strength and skill of man, who has been\r\n     endowed with superior intellectual powers; that she must count it\r\n     her highest honor to reflect upon the world the light of his\r\n     intelligence and wisdom, as the moon reflects the light of the\r\n     sun!\r\n\r\n     We may congratulate one another on this occasion in view of the\r\n     cheering indications so manifest on every hand that the ignorance\r\n     and darkness which have so long brooded over the prospects of\r\n     woman, are beginning to give place to the light of truth. In the\r\n     summer of 1848, in the village of Seneca Falls, a small number of\r\n     women, disregarding alike the sneers of the ignorant and the\r\n     frowns of the learned, assembled in Convention and boldly claimed\r\n     for themselves, and for their sex, the rights conferred by God\r\n     and so long withheld by man. Their courageous words were the\r\n     expression of sentiments which others had felt as deeply as\r\n     themselves, but which the restraints imposed by long-established\r\n     custom had taught them to suppress. But now the hour had come,\r\n     and the world stood prepared for the reception of a new thought,\r\n     which is destined to work a revolution in human society, more\r\n     beneficent than any that has preceded it. The seeds of truth\r\n     which that Convention planted in faith and hope were not left to\r\n     perish. In many thoughtful minds they germinated apace and\r\n     brought forth fruit. That fruit was seen in the large Convention\r\n     held in Ohio in the spring of 1850, in that held in Massachusetts\r\n     in the autumn of the same year, and in those which have followed\r\n     since in New England and the West.\r\n\r\n     Woman at length is awaking from the slumber of ages. Many of the\r\n     sex already perceive that knowledge, sound judgment, and perfect\r\n     freedom of thought and action are quite as important for the\r\n     mothers as for the fathers of the race. They weary of the\r\n     senseless talk of \"woman's sphere,\" when that sphere is so\r\n     circumscribed that they may not exert their full influence and\r\n     power to save their country from war, intemperance, slavery,\r\n     licentiousness, ignorance, poverty, and crime, which man, in the\r\n     mad pursuit of his ambitious schemes, unchecked by their presence\r\n     and counsel, permits to desolate and destroy all that is fair and\r\n     beautiful in life and fill the world with weeping, lamentation,\r\n     and woe. Woman begins to grow weary of her helpless and dependent\r\n     position, and of being treated as if she were formed only to\r\n     cultivate her affections, that they may flow in strong and deep\r\n     currents merely to gratify the self-love of man.\r\n\r\n     She does not listen with delight, as she once did, when she hears\r\n     her relations to her equal brother represented by the poetical\r\n     figure of the trellis and creeping tendril, or of the oak and the\r\n     gracefully clinging vine. No, she feels that she is, like him, an\r\n     accountable being--that the Infinite Father has laid\r\n     responsibilities upon her which may not be innocently transferred\r\n     to another, but which, in her present ignorance, she is not\r\n     prepared to meet. She is becoming rapidly imbued with the spirit\r\n     of progress, and will not longer submit, without remonstrance, to\r\n     the bondage of ancient dogmas and customs. In the retirement and\r\n     seclusion of life, the stirring impulse of the times has reached\r\n     even the heart of woman, and she feels the necessity of a more\r\n     thorough culture and a wider field of usefulness. She sees the\r\n     glaring injustice by which she has long been deprived of all fair\r\n     opportunity to earn an independent livelihood, and thus, in too\r\n     many instances, constrained to enter the marriage relation, as a\r\n     choice of evils, to secure herself against the ills of impending\r\n     poverty. The wrong she so deeply feels she is at length arousing\r\n     herself to redress.\r\n\r\n     What, then, is the substance of our demand? I answer, we demand\r\n     for woman equal freedom with her brother to raise her voice and\r\n     exert her influence directly for the removal of all the evils\r\n     that afflict the race; and that she be permitted to do this in\r\n     the manner dictated by her own sense of propriety and justice. We\r\n     ask for her educational advantages equal to those enjoyed by the\r\n     other sex; that the richly endowed institutions which she has\r\n     been taxed to establish and support, may be open alike to all her\r\n     children. We claim for her the right to follow any honorable\r\n     calling or profession for which she may be fitted by her\r\n     intellectual training and capacity. We claim for her a fair\r\n     opportunity to attain a position of pecuniary independence, and\r\n     to this end that she receive for her labor a compensation\r\n     equivalent to its recognized value when performed by the other\r\n     sex.\r\n\r\n     These demands, we think, must be admitted to be essentially wise\r\n     and just. We make them in no spirit of selfish antagonism to the\r\n     other sex, but under a deep conviction that they are prompted by\r\n     an enlightened regard for the highest welfare of the race. Some\r\n     one has justly said that God has so linked the human family\r\n     together that any violence done at one end of the chain is felt\r\n     throughout its length. The true interests of the sexes are not\r\n     antagonistic, but harmonious. There can be no just conflict\r\n     between their respective rights and duties. For the coming of the\r\n     day when this great truth shall be universally received, we must\r\n     work and pray as we have opportunity. When that day shall arrive,\r\n     it will be clearly perceived that in the true Harmonic Order\r\n     \"woman and her brother are pillars in the same temple and priests\r\n     of the same worship.\"\r\n\r\n     The Secretary, SIDNEY PEIRCE, read the following letter from\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SARAH M. GRIMKÉ.\r\n\r\n     When an insect emerges with struggles from its chrysalis state,\r\n     how feeble are all its movements, how its wings hang powerless\r\n     until the genial air has dried and strengthened them, how\r\n     patiently the insect tries again and again to spread them, and\r\n     visit the flowers which bloom around, till at last it enjoys the\r\n     recompense of its labors in the nectar and the fragrance of the\r\n     garden.\r\n\r\n     This illustrates the present condition of Woman. She is just\r\n     emerging from the darkness and ignorance by which she has been\r\n     shrouded. She looks forth from her chrysalis and sees the natural\r\n     and intellectual world lying around her clothed in radiant\r\n     beauty, and inviting her to enter and possess this magnificent\r\n     inheritance. How came I, she asks, to be excluded from all these\r\n     precious privileges? I will arise and go to my Father and say,\r\n     \"Father, permit me to share the labors of my brethren and partake\r\n     of the fruits which they enjoy.\" \"Go, my daughter,\" is the\r\n     paternal response. \"Be unto man, in an infinitely higher sense\r\n     than heretofore, a help-meet.\" How is woman fulfilling her divine\r\n     mission? Is she looking on the benefits she is commissioned to\r\n     bestow on the human race, or is she keeping her eye on her own\r\n     interests and seeking her own elevation, with little of that\r\n     expansive benevolence, that philosophical foresight which seeks\r\n     the development of all?\r\n\r\n     Woman is now in the transition state, a glorious mission is\r\n     before her, a glorious destiny awaits her. To fulfill that\r\n     mission, to be worthy of that destiny, she must patiently wait\r\n     and quietly hope, blessing those who scorn and deride her feeble\r\n     and often unsuccessful efforts, to free herself from her\r\n     entanglements. She must expect many failures in her attempts to\r\n     emancipate herself from the thralldom of public opinion. Those\r\n     who have long held the reins of power and the rank of\r\n     superiority, naturally look with distrust on a movement which\r\n     threatens to overturn long established customs and transform the\r\n     baby and the toy into an intellectual being, desiring equal\r\n     rights with themselves and asserting her claim to all the\r\n     immunities they enjoy. Woman must be willing to see herself as\r\n     she is, the slave of fashion, assuming all the Proteus forms she\r\n     invents, without reference to health or convenience. She must\r\n     remember how few of us give evidence of sufficient development to\r\n     warrant our claims; and whilst we feel a divine impulse to\r\n     proceed in achieving the enlargement of woman, whilst we hear a\r\n     voice saying, \"Ye have compassed this mountain long enough; speak\r\n     to the people that they go forward,\" let us not be dismayed at\r\n     the hindrances we shall encounter from those whom we are laboring\r\n     to release from the swaddling bands of infancy, or the\r\n     grave-clothes of superstition, time-honored opinion and crushing\r\n     circumstances. We are now in a perilous and difficult position.\r\n     We feel all the inconveniences of our past condition, all the\r\n     disadvantages and uneasiness of the one we are constrained to\r\n     occupy, and see in bold relief all the advantages which a change\r\n     will yield us. But let us remember that our transition state,\r\n     although replete with temptations and suffering, is necessary to\r\n     our improvement; we need it to strengthen us and enable us to\r\n     bear hardships as good soldiers of truth.\r\n\r\n     To regard any state of society as fixed, is to regard it as the\r\n     ultimate good, as the best condition to which we can attain. But\r\n     when man has progressed, when his morality and his religion have\r\n     assumed a higher tone, it is impossible to perpetuate his\r\n     childhood, or to give permanence to institutions and opinions\r\n     whose days are numbered. When reform has truth for its basis and\r\n     is instinct with the life of progression, no power can dress it\r\n     in the habiliments of the grave, and bury it out of sight, either\r\n     in the Potter's-field or under the magnificent mausoleum. There\r\n     is nothing so precious to man as progress; he has defended it\r\n     with his heart's best blood, and according to his development has\r\n     aided it, although sometimes in his blindness he has scattered\r\n     fire and sword, destruction and misery around, in endeavoring to\r\n     force mankind to adopt the truths he thought essential to\r\n     progress. \"Woman has come on the stage,\" says Horace Mann, \"6,000\r\n     years after man, to profit by his misdeeds and correct his\r\n     errors.\" Until now, the world was not prepared to receive, in\r\n     full measure, the hallowed influence which woman is designed to\r\n     shed. Her holy mission is to bring peace on earth and good-will\r\n     to man. She does not ask for irresponsible power; she has seen\r\n     that from the earliest records of the human race the possession\r\n     of such power is fraught with danger, that it has always made\r\n     tyrants. She feels Divinity stirring within her, and its\r\n     irrepressible aspirings can not, should not be controlled.\r\n     Mankind have always rejected the means appointed by Infinite\r\n     Wisdom to assist their upward flight. Let us then go calmly\r\n     forward, alike regardless of the scorn and ridicule of the\r\n     shallow, the grave denunciations of the bigot, or the weighty\r\n     counsel of the narrow-minded and selfish, who would point out the\r\n     exact position fitted for us to occupy, and with seeming\r\n     condescension invite us to fill some posts of honor and profit,\r\n     while they undertake to confine us within their bounds, leaving\r\n     nothing to our good sense, intelligence, intuitive desires, and\r\n     aspiring hopes. The truth is, \"It is not in man that walketh to\r\n     direct his steps.\" God alone is competent to do this, and in the\r\n     present movement His power, wisdom, and will, are so\r\n     conspicuous, that it will be well to set no bounds to His work,\r\n     but let it have free course, expecting that contradictions and\r\n     inconsistencies will mar it, but believing that those\r\n     contradictions will cease, those inconsistencies disappear, and\r\n     the perfected human being be developed.\r\n\r\n     If we adopt as our watchword the language of Margaret Fuller, we\r\n     can not but overcome all obstacles, outlive all opposition: \"Give\r\n     me Truth. Cheat me by no illusion. Oh, the granting of this\r\n     prayer is sometimes terrible; I walk over the burning plowshares\r\n     and they sear my feet--yet nothing but Truth will do.\"\r\n\r\n                                                  SARAH M. GRIMKÉ\r\n\r\n\r\n     LUCRETIA MOTT addressed the Convention, briefly referring to the\r\n     importance of the movement and expressing her gratification on\r\n     seeing the response given to the call, by the great number of\r\n     persons assembled. She saw before her not only a large delegation\r\n     from the immediate vicinity, but a goodly number from other and\r\n     distant States.\r\n\r\n     The movement for the enfranchisement of woman is indeed making\r\n     rapid progress. Since the first Convention held at Seneca Falls,\r\n     in 1848, where a few women assembled, and notwithstanding their\r\n     ignorance of the parliamentary modes of conducting business,\r\n     promulgated these principles, which took deep root, and are\r\n     already producing important results. Other large Conventions have\r\n     been held in different places, which have done much toward\r\n     disseminating the great principles of equality between the sexes;\r\n     and a spirit of earnest inquiry has been aroused. She referred to\r\n     the fact that the agitation commenced in those States most\r\n     distinguished for intellectual and moral culture, while we in\r\n     Pennsylvania are ready to embrace their views on this subject;\r\n     and trusted that the Convention now assembled, would be neither\r\n     less interesting nor less efficient than those that have been\r\n     already held.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. CLARINA HOWARD NICHOLS, of Brattleboro, Vermont, spoke\r\n     briefly on the absurdity of the popular idea of woman's sphere.\r\n     She thought the sphere of sex could only be determined by\r\n     capacity and moral obligation. She had once thought politics\r\n     necessarily too degrading for woman, but she had changed her\r\n     views. The science of government, it is said, is of divine\r\n     origin; a participation in its administration can not then\r\n     necessarily involve anything to deteriorate from the true dignity\r\n     of woman. The world's interests have never yet been fully\r\n     represented. The propriety of woman voting had been to her a\r\n     stumbling-block; the idea was repelling. She was not yet allowed\r\n     to vote, but she had ceased to consent to the arrangement which\r\n     deprived her of that right, and therefore experienced a freedom\r\n     of spirit which she had not known before. The idea that woman\r\n     could not go to the ballot-box without a sacrifice of her\r\n     delicacy was absurd. Women were allowed to vote in church matters\r\n     unquestioned. They can hold railroad stock, bank stock, and stock\r\n     of other corporations, where their influence is in proportion to\r\n     the amount held.\r\n\r\n     But we are not called upon to maintain the position of the\r\n     propriety or expediency of women voting. The question is, Shall\r\n     they have the right so to do?--the propriety should be left to\r\n     themselves. Woman can now travel alone securely, where formerly\r\n     it was considered a risk. She can deposit her vote with men,\r\n     with as much propriety as she can ride with them in railroad\r\n     cars, on steamboats, etc. She came all the way from the Green\r\n     Mountains without any male attendant; she traveled with members\r\n     of Congress and delegates to the Baltimore Convention, and not a\r\n     \"bear\" among them offered her the least indignity.\r\n\r\n     ERNESTINE L. ROSE quoted the testimony of Horace Mann,[67] that\r\n     our Legislatures were \"bear gardens, our representatives too rude\r\n     and rough for woman's association, hence the impropriety and\r\n     indelicacy of her mingling in politics.\" But we are told it is\r\n     woman's province to soothe the angry passions and calm the\r\n     belligerent feelings of man, and if what Horace Mann says is\r\n     true, where can we find a riper harvest awaiting us than in the\r\n     halls of legislation!\r\n\r\nHarriet K. Hunt then read an address upon the medical education of\r\nwomen; on concluding, she offered the following resolutions:\r\n\r\n     _1st. Resolved_, That the present position of medical\r\n     organizations, precluding women from the same educational\r\n     advantages with men, under pretext of delicacy, virtually\r\n     acknowledges the impropriety of his being her medical attendant.\r\n\r\n     _2d. Resolved_, That we will do all in our power to sustain those\r\n     women who, from a conviction of duty, enter the medical\r\n     profession, in their efforts to overcome the evils that have\r\n     accumulated in their path, and in attacking the strongholds of\r\n     vice.\r\n\r\n     _3d. Resolved_, That the past actions and present indications of\r\n     our medical schools should not affect us at all; and\r\n     notwithstanding Geneva and Cleveland Medical Colleges closed\r\n     their doors after graduating one woman each, and Harvard, through\r\n     the false delicacy of the students, declared it inexpedient to\r\n     receive one who had been in successful practice many years, we\r\n     would still earnestly follow in peace and love where duty points,\r\n     and leave the verdict to an enlightened public sentiment.\r\n\r\nThe address of Dr. Hunt called out a discussion on the importance of a\r\nthorough medical training for women in all departments of science\r\nbelonging to that profession.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. NICHOLS spoke earnestly of the imperfect education of woman.\r\n     With no knowledge of the laws of health, she has no means of\r\n     obtaining the required information. Men hold the purse even when\r\n     it is filled by the labor of both. They close the college doors,\r\n     though we have helped to build and endow them. And at what a\r\n     fearful cost of life and health are we thus wronged. Does it cost\r\n     too much to educate the future mothers of this nation in the\r\n     science of life? Who can estimate how much greater are the\r\n     expenses incurred by our ignorant violation of the laws of\r\n     health?\r\n\r\n     FRANCES DANA GAGE, of Ohio, spoke of the high scholarship and\r\n     very successful examinations of those women who had been admitted\r\n     into the medical colleges, far surpassing the young men in their\r\n     recitations and general intelligence. So long as the lives of\r\n     children are conceded to be in the hands of their mothers, it is\r\n     of vital consequence to the race that women be thoroughly\r\n     educated for the medical profession.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ROSE said: These are mighty questions. When our little ones\r\n     are removed by death from our care and affection, we feel most\r\n     keenly our ignorance, and long to know something of those\r\n     immutable laws of life and health we have so long violated. Woman\r\n     should at least know enough to be physician to herself and\r\n     children, but she is denied the advantages granted to man for\r\n     obtaining knowledge of these things more necessary if possible to\r\n     her than to him.\r\n\r\n     The idea of a female doctor is ridiculed. But what is she worth\r\n     as a nurse of the sick without a knowledge of the art of healing?\r\n     Why am I in the prime of life in such feeble health? In my\r\n     country, the laws of life are, comparatively speaking, kept in a\r\n     nutshell. The girl must not exercise; it is not fashionable. She\r\n     must not be seen in active life; it is not feminine. The boy may\r\n     run, the girl must creep. It is to discuss all these grave\r\n     inequalities that we have assembled here, and I trust the\r\n     influence of this Convention may be felt in opening to woman all\r\n     honest and honorable means of self-support and self-development,\r\n     and in removing all the legal shackles that block her pathway\r\n     through life.\r\n\r\n     EVA PUGH said: The degradation of one sex is the degradation of\r\n     the other. This question is universal, affecting all alike. No\r\n     fact is better established than that the character of the parent\r\n     is inherited by the child. Can noble men be born of infirm women?\r\n     Who are the mothers of great men? Women of mind, of thought, of\r\n     independence; not women degraded by man's tyranny, laboring in\r\n     prescribed limits, thinking other people's thoughts, and echoing\r\n     their opinions. This question of woman's rights affects the whole\r\n     human race. We know from sad experience that man can not rise\r\n     while woman is degraded.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. MOTT spoke of the great change in public sentiment within\r\n     her recollection in regard to the so-called sphere of woman.\r\n     Twenty years ago people wondered how a modest girl could attend\r\n     lectures on Botany; but modest girls did attend them and other\r\n     places frequented only by men, and the result was not a loss of\r\n     delicacy, but a higher and nobler development; a true modesty.\r\n\r\n     JOSEPH A. DUGDALE made a few remarks on the injustice of the laws\r\n     by which happy households are often broken up on the death of the\r\n     husband and father. He said there remained one way in which this\r\n     great evil could be avoided even while the law remains unchanged,\r\n     and that was by a will of the husband conveying the whole\r\n     property of their joint industry and economy to the wife, in the\r\n     event of his death. He urged this as the duty of every husband\r\n     and father. He closed his remarks with the following extract from\r\n     the will of Martin Luther, proving that other errors than those\r\n     of the Church, were deemed by the great reformer of sufficient\r\n     magnitude to awaken his earnest opposition:\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MARTIN LUTHER'S WILL.\r\n\r\n     \"This is all I am worth, and I give it all to my wife for the\r\n     following reasons:\r\n\r\n     \"1. Because she has always conducted herself toward me lovingly,\r\n     worthily, and beautifully, like a pious, faithful, and noble\r\n     wife; and by the rich blessings of God, she has borne and brought\r\n     up five living children, who yet live, and God grant they may\r\n     long live.\r\n\r\n     \"2. Because she will take upon herself and pay the debts which I\r\n     owe and may not be able to pay during my life, which, so far as I\r\n     can estimate, may amount to about 450 florins, or perhaps a\r\n     little more.\r\n\r\n     \"3. But most of all, because I will not have her dependent on the\r\n     children, but the children on her; that they may hold her in\r\n     honor, and submit themselves to her as God has commanded. For I\r\n     see well and observe, how the devil, by wicked and envious\r\n     mouths, heats and excites children, even though they be pious,\r\n     against this command; especially when the mothers are widows, and\r\n     the sons get wives, and the daughters get husbands, and again\r\n     _socrus murum, nurus socrum_. For I hold that the mother will be\r\n     the best guardian for her own children, and will use what little\r\n     property and goods she may have, not for their disadvantage and\r\n     injury, but for their good and improvement, since they are her\r\n     own flesh and blood, and she carried them under her heart.\r\n\r\n     \"And if, after my death, she should find it necessary or\r\n     desirable to marry again (for I can not pretend to set limits to\r\n     the will or providence of God), yet I trust and herewith express\r\n     my confidence that she will conduct herself toward our mutual\r\n     children as becometh a mother, and will faithfully impart to them\r\n     property, and do whatever else is right.\r\n\r\n     \"And herewith I humbly pray my most gracious lord, his grace Duke\r\n     John Frederick, elector of Saxony, graciously to guard and\r\n     protect the above-named gifts and property.\r\n\r\n     \"I also entreat all my good friends to be witnesses for my dear\r\n     Catey, and help to defend her should any good-for-nothing mouth\r\n     reprove and slander her, as if she had secretly some personal\r\n     property of which she would defraud the poor children. For I\r\n     testify there is no personal property except the plate and\r\n     jewelry enumerated above.\r\n\r\n     \"Finally, I beg, since in this will or testament I have not used\r\n     legal forms or words (and thereto I have my reasons), that every\r\n     one may let me be the person that I am in truth, namely, openly\r\n     and known both in heaven and earth, and in hell, and let me have\r\n     respect and authority enough so that I may be trusted and\r\n     believed more than any lawyer. For so God the Father of all\r\n     mercies hath entrusted to me, a poor, miserable, condemned\r\n     sinner, the Gospel of His dear Son, and therein thus far I have\r\n     behaved and conducted myself truly and faithfully, and it has\r\n     made much progress in the world through me, and I am honored as a\r\n     teacher of truth, notwithstanding the curse of the Pope and the\r\n     wrath of emperors, kings, princes, priests, and all kinds of\r\n     devils; much rather then let me be believed in this little\r\n     matter, especially as here in my hand which is very well known;\r\n     and I hope it may be enough, when it can be said and proved that\r\n     this is the serious and deliberate desire of Dr. Martin Luther\r\n     (who is God's lawyer and witness of His Gospel) to be proved by\r\n     his own hand and seal, Sept. 16, 1542.\"\r\n\r\n     LUCRETIA MOTT (see 8th resolution) thought it important that we\r\n     should not disclaim the antagonism that woman's present position\r\n     rendered it necessary she should assume. Too long had wrongs and\r\n     oppressions existed without an acknowledged wrong-doer and\r\n     oppressor. It was not until the slaveholder was told, \"thou art\r\n     the man,\" that a healthful agitation was brought about. Woman is\r\n     told that the fault is in herself, in too willingly submitting to\r\n     her inferior condition; but, like the slave, she is pressed down\r\n     by laws in the making of which she has had no voice, and crushed\r\n     by customs that have grown out of such laws. She can not rise,\r\n     therefore, while thus trampled in the dust. The oppressor does\r\n     not see himself in that light until the oppressed cry for\r\n     deliverance.\r\n\r\nIn commenting on the will just read, she further said:\r\n\r\n     The extract from Luther's will which has been read, while it\r\n     gives evidence of the appreciation of the services of his wife,\r\n     to a certain extent, and manifests a generous disposition to\r\n     reward her as a faithful wife, still only proves the degrading\r\n     relation she bore to her husband. There is no recognition of her\r\n     equal right to their joint earnings. While the wife is obliged to\r\n     accept as a gift that which in justice belongs to her, however\r\n     generous the boon, she is but an inferior dependent.\r\n\r\n     The law of our State and of New York, has within a few years been\r\n     so amended that the wife has some control over a part of her\r\n     property. Much yet remains to be done; and if woman \"contend\r\n     earnestly\" for the right, man will co-operate with her in\r\n     adjusting all her claims. We have only to look back a few years,\r\n     to satisfy ourselves that the demands already made are met in a\r\n     disposition to redress the grievances. When a delegation of women\r\n     to the World's Anti-Slavery Convention in 1840, could find no\r\n     favor in London, what were the reasons assigned for the\r\n     exclusion? Not that the right of representation was not as much\r\n     woman's as man's, but that \"they would be ridiculed in the\r\n     morning papers.\"\r\n\r\n     Daniel O'Connell felt the injustice done to those delegates, and\r\n     in a letter on the subject to me, expressed his deep regret, that\r\n     owing to business engagements, he was not able to attend the\r\n     Convention and take part in the discussion.[68]\r\n\r\n     Dr. Bowring advocated the admission of the delegates at that\r\n     time; and afterward in a letter to this country, said: \"How often\r\n     have I regretted that the woman's question, to me of singular\r\n     interest, was launched with so little preparation, so little\r\n     knowledge of the manner in which it had been entangled, by the\r\n     fears of some and the follies of others! But, bear up! for the\r\n     coming of those women will form an era in the future history of\r\n     philanthropic daring. They made a deep, if not a wide impression;\r\n     and have created apostles, if as yet they have not multitudes of\r\n     followers. The experiment was well worth making. It honored\r\n     America--it will instruct England. If in some matters of high\r\n     civilization you are behind us, in this matter of courageous\r\n     benevolence how far are you before us!\"\r\n\r\n     Since that time women have fairly entered the field as students\r\n     of medicine and as physicians, as editors and lecturers, engaged\r\n     in schools of design, and in the taking of daguerres, as well as\r\n     in some other works of art, and in holding Conventions in several\r\n     of the States of our Union for the advocacy of our entire claims.\r\n     A National Society has been formed; and the proceedings of these\r\n     Conventions and Society meetings have been fairly reported, and\r\n     have received favorable notices in many of the papers of this\r\n     country, as well as in the _Westminster Review_ in England.\r\n\r\n     FRANCES D. GAGE said that allusion had been made in the address\r\n     to the popular sentiment, that men are what their mothers made\r\n     them. She repelled this sentiment as an indignity to her sex.\r\n     What mother, she asked, ever taught her son to drink rum, gamble,\r\n     swear, smoke, and chew tobacco? The truth was, that the boy was\r\n     virtually taught to regard his mother as inferior, and that it\r\n     was not manly to follow her instructions. When he left the\r\n     hearth-stone he was beyond her reach. He found men, and those,\r\n     too, in elevated stations, addicted to vulgar and vicious\r\n     practices, and he was liable, in forgetfulness of all that his\r\n     mother had taught him, to fall into such habits himself. Men\r\n     allowed grog-shops to be set up on the street corners, and\r\n     permitted gambling-houses to exist, to tempt the boy from the\r\n     path of virtue; and when the mothers asked for the abatement of\r\n     these evils, they were told to keep in their sphere. In the town\r\n     where she resided (McConnellsville, Morgan Co., Ohio), the women\r\n     sent a large petition to the court asking that grog-shops might\r\n     not be licensed. The judge thereupon remarked that \"woman's place\r\n     was in the nursery and the parlor, and that when she interfered\r\n     with public affairs, or set herself up as an instructor of the\r\n     courts, she was out of her sphere.\" Thus men perpetuate\r\n     institutions which undermine the influence of the mothers, and\r\n     corrupt the morals of the sons. The boys were, therefore, in many\r\n     cases, what men made them. True, there were some cases in which\r\n     the mother, by superior power, shaped the destiny of her sons, in\r\n     spite of adverse influences. Such cases were not the rule, but\r\n     the exception. Mothers, generally, could not exert their full\r\n     influence over their sons, unless they were permitted to stand by\r\n     them as the equals of their fathers in all relations of life.\r\n\r\nThe following address, written by Ann Preston, and adopted as an\r\nexposition of the principles and purposes of the Convention, was\r\nimpressively read by the author:\r\n\r\n                        ANN PRESTON'S ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n     The question is repeatedly asked by those who have thought but\r\n     little upon the subject of woman's position in society, \"What\r\n     does woman want more than she possesses already? Is she not\r\n     beloved, honored, guarded, cherished? Wherein are her rights\r\n     infringed, or her liberties curtailed?\"\r\n\r\n     Glowing pictures have been drawn of the fitness of the present\r\n     relations of society, and of the beauty of woman's dependence\r\n     upon the protecting love of man, and frightful visions have been\r\n     evoked of the confusion and perversion of nature which would\r\n     occur if the doctrine of the equal rights of man and woman was\r\n     once admitted.\r\n\r\n     The idea seems to prevail that movements for the elevation of\r\n     woman arise, not from the legitimate wants of society, but from\r\n     the vague restlessness of unquiet spirits; not from the serene\r\n     dictates of wisdom, but from the headlong impulses of fanaticism.\r\n\r\n     We came not here to argue the question of the relative strength\r\n     of intellect in man and woman; for the reform which we advocate\r\n     depends not upon its settlement. We place not the interests of\r\n     woman in antagonism to those of her brother, for\r\n\r\n          \"The woman's cause is man's:\r\n            They rise or sink together,\r\n          Dwarfed or God-like, bond or free.\"\r\n\r\n     We maintain not that woman should lose any of that refinement and\r\n     delicacy of spirit which, as a celestial halo, ever encircles the\r\n     pure in heart. We contend not that she shall become noisy and\r\n     dictatorial, and abjure the quiet graces of life. We claim not\r\n     that she, any more than her brother, should engage in any\r\n     vocation or appear in any situation to which her nature and\r\n     abilities are not fitted. But we ask for her, as for man,\r\n     equality before the law, and freedom to exercise all her powers\r\n     and faculties under the direction of her own judgment and\r\n     volition.\r\n\r\n     When a woman dies, leaving behind her a husband and children, no\r\n     appraisers come into the desolated home to examine the effects;\r\n     the father is the guardian of his offspring; the family relation\r\n     is not invaded by law. But when a man dies the case is entirely\r\n     different; in the hour of the widow's deep distress strangers\r\n     come into the house to take an inventory of the effects,\r\n     strangers are appointed to be the guardians of her children, and\r\n     she, their natural care-taker, thenceforth has no legal direction\r\n     of their interests; strangers decide upon the propriety of the\r\n     sale of the property--earned, perhaps, by her own and her\r\n     husband's mutual efforts--and her interest in the estate is\r\n     coolly designated as the \"widow's incumbrance!\" In the extremity\r\n     of her bereavement there is piled upon her, not only the dread of\r\n     separation from her children, but that of being sent homeless\r\n     from the spot where every object has been consecrated by her\r\n     tenderest affections.\r\n\r\n     Nor is the practical working of this law better than its theory;\r\n     all over the country there are widows who have been made doubly\r\n     desolate by its provisions--widows separated from their children,\r\n     who, if they had had the disposal of their own and their\r\n     husbands' mutual property, might have retrieved their\r\n     circumstances, and kept the household band together. We ask for\r\n     such change in public sentiment as shall procure the repeal of\r\n     this oppressive law.\r\n\r\n     We ask that woman shall have free access to vocations of profit\r\n     and honor, the means of earning a livelihood and independence for\r\n     herself! As a general rule, profitable employments are not\r\n     considered open to woman, nor are her business capabilities\r\n     encouraged and developed by systematic training. Gloomy must be\r\n     the feelings of the father of a family of young daughters, when\r\n     he is about to bid farewell to the world, if he is leaving them\r\n     without the means of pecuniary support. Their brothers may go out\r\n     into society and gain position and competency; but for them there\r\n     is but little choice of employment, and, too often, they are left\r\n     with repressed and crippled energies to pine and chafe under the\r\n     bitter sense of poverty and dependence.\r\n\r\n     Their pursuits are to be determined, not by their inclination,\r\n     judgment, and ability, as are those of man, but by the popular\r\n     estimate of what is proper and becoming. In Turkey public\r\n     delicacy is outraged if a woman appears unveiled beyond the walls\r\n     of the harem; in America a sentiment no less arbitrary presumes\r\n     to mark out for her the precise boundaries of womanly propriety;\r\n     and she who ventures to step beyond them, must do it at the peril\r\n     of encountering low sneers, coarse allusions, and the withering\r\n     imputation of want of feminine delicacy.\r\n\r\n     Even for the same services woman generally receives less than\r\n     man. The whole tendency of our customs, habits, and teaching, is\r\n     to make her dependent--dependent in outward circumstances,\r\n     dependent in spirit.\r\n\r\n     As a consequence of her fewer resources, marriage has been to her\r\n     the great means of securing position in society. Thus it is that\r\n     this relation--which should ever be a \"holy sacrament,\" the\r\n     unbiased and generous election of the free and self-sustained\r\n     being--too often is degraded into a mean acceptance of a shelter\r\n     from neglect and poverty! We ask that woman shall be trained to\r\n     unfold her whole nature; to exercise all her powers and\r\n     faculties.\r\n\r\n     It is said that the domestic circle is the peculiar province of\r\n     woman; that \"men are what mothers make them.\" But how can that\r\n     woman who does not live for self-culture and self-development,\r\n     who has herself no exalted objects in life, imbue her children\r\n     with lofty aspirations, or train her sons to a free and glorious\r\n     manhood? She best can fulfill the duties of wife and mother, who\r\n     is fitted for other and varied usefulness.\r\n\r\n     The being who lives for one relation only can not possess the\r\n     power and scope which are required for the highest excellence\r\n     even in that one. If the whole body is left without exercise, one\r\n     arm does not become strong; if the tree is stunted in its growth,\r\n     one branch does not shoot into surpassing luxuriance.\r\n\r\n     That woman whose habits and mental training enable her to assist\r\n     and sustain her husband in seasons of difficulty, and whose\r\n     children rely on her as a wise counselor, commands a life-long\r\n     reverence far deeper and dearer than can be secured by transient\r\n     accomplishments, or the most refined and delicate imbecility! All\r\n     women are not wives and mothers, but all have spirits needing\r\n     development, powers that grow with their exercise.\r\n\r\n     Those who are best acquainted with the state of society know that\r\n     there is, at this time, a vast amount of unhappiness among women\r\n     for want of free outlets to their powers; that thousands are\r\n     yearning for fuller development, and a wider field of usefulness.\r\n     The same energies which in man find vent in the professions, and\r\n     in the thousand forms of business and study, must find an\r\n     ennobling channel in woman, else they will be frittered away in\r\n     trifles, or turned into instruments to prey upon their possessor.\r\n\r\n     To follow the empty round of fashion, to retail gossip and\r\n     scandal, to be an ornament in the parlor or a mere drudge in the\r\n     kitchen, to live as an appendage to any human being, does not\r\n     fill up nor satisfy the capacities of a soul awakened to a sense\r\n     of its true wants, and the far-reaching and mighty interests\r\n     which cluster around its existence.\r\n\r\n     We protest against the tyranny of that public sentiment which\r\n     assigns any arbitrary sphere to woman. God has made the happiness\r\n     and development of His creatures to depend upon the free exercise\r\n     of their powers and faculties. Freedom is the law of beauty,\r\n     written by His fingers upon the human mind, and the only\r\n     condition upon which it can attain to its fall stature, and\r\n     expand in its natural and beautiful proportions.\r\n\r\n     It is recognized, in reference to man, that his judgment,\r\n     opportunities, and abilities are the proper measure of his\r\n     sphere. \"The tools to him who can use them.\" But the same\r\n     principles are not trusted in their application to woman, lest,\r\n     forsooth, she should lose her feminine characteristics, and, like\r\n     the lost Pleiad, forsake her native sphere!\r\n\r\n     It seems to be forgotten that the laws of nature will not be\r\n     suspended; that the human mind, when released from pressure, like\r\n     water, must find its own level; that woman can not, if she would,\r\n     cast away her nature and instincts; that it is only when we are\r\n     left free to obey the inward attractions of our being that we\r\n     fall into our natural places, and move in our God-appointed\r\n     orbits.\r\n\r\n     We ask that none shall dare to come in between woman and her\r\n     Maker, and with unhallowed hands attempt to plant their shallow\r\n     posts and draw their flimsy cords around the Heaven-wide sphere\r\n     of an immortal spirit! We maintain that God has not so failed in\r\n     His adaptations as to give powers to be wasted, talents to be\r\n     wrapped in a napkin; and that the possession of faculties and\r\n     capabilities is the warrant of nature, the command of the\r\n     All-Wise for their culture and exercise.\r\n\r\n     We believe that the woman who is obeying the convictions of her\r\n     own soul, and whose ability is commensurate with her employment,\r\n     is ever in her own true sphere; whether in her quiet home she is\r\n     training her children to nobleness and virtue, or is standing as\r\n     a physician by the bed of sickness and sorrow; whether, with\r\n     Elizabeth Fry, she is preaching the gospel of glad tidings to the\r\n     sad dwellers in prison, or like the Italian, Lauri Bassi, is\r\n     filling a professor's chair and expounding philosophy to admiring\r\n     and instructed listeners.\r\n\r\n     While we demand for woman a more complete physical, intellectual,\r\n     and moral education, as the means of strengthening and\r\n     beautifying her own nature, and of ennobling the whole race, we\r\n     also ask for a more elevated standard of excellence and moral\r\n     purity in man; and we maintain that if there is any place of\r\n     resort or employment in society, which necessarily would sully\r\n     the delicacy of woman's spirit, in that, man also must be\r\n     contaminated and degraded. Woman indeed should wear about her,\r\n     wherever she moves, the protecting investment of innocence and\r\n     purity; but not less is it requisite that he, who is the\r\n     companion of her life, should guard his spirit with the same\r\n     sacred and beautiful covering.\r\n\r\n     We believe that woman, as an accountable being, can not\r\n     innocently merge her individuality in that of her brother, or\r\n     accept from him the limitations of her sphere. In all life's\r\n     great extremities she also is thrown upon her inward resources,\r\n     and stands alone. Man can not step in between her and the\r\n     \"accusing angel\" of her own conscience; alone in the solitude of\r\n     her spirit she must wrestle with her own sorrows; none can walk\r\n     for her \"the valley of the shadow of death!\" When her brother\r\n     shall be able to settle for her accountabilities, and \"give to\r\n     God a ransom for her soul,\" then, and not till then, may she\r\n     rightly commit to him the direction of her powers and activities.\r\n\r\n     We ask, in fine, for the application of the fundamental\r\n     principles of Christianity and republicanism to this, as to all\r\n     other questions of vital importance; and appealing to all who\r\n     desire the progression and happiness of the whole race, we ask\r\n     them, as magnanimous men and true women, to examine this subject\r\n     in the spirit of a generous and candid investigation.\r\n\r\n     RUSH PLUMLY said: Although institutions which recognize all the\r\n     rights of all classes of the people, and allow scope for the\r\n     growth and activity of every faculty, must, in their very nature,\r\n     increase in power and permanence; yet, compared with the duration\r\n     of things, the oldest nations and the best founded governments\r\n     have had but an ephemeral existence, appearing, maturing, and\r\n     decaying with startling rapidity and endless succession.\r\n\r\n     No form has been exempt from this national mortality.\r\n     Theocracies, oligarchies, monarchies, despotisms, republics, have\r\n     arisen, flourished, and vanished into history or tradition. So\r\n     inevitable does the successive ruin appear, that we have\r\n     incorporated into our religious faith the idea that limitation,\r\n     conflict, and decay, rather than expansion, permanence, and\r\n     peace, are inherent in all human governments, and, in despair man\r\n     postpones his hope of national, as well as of individual\r\n     stability and happiness, to some future existence.\r\n\r\n     For results so certain and so universal among all people, in\r\n     every age, there must be some profound and radical cause which\r\n     religion and philosophy have not discovered, or for which they\r\n     have proposed no remedy. It is not sufficient to say that these\r\n     are consequences of human imperfection; that we know; but whence\r\n     arises the imperfection? It does not satisfy us to assert that\r\n     they proceed from the depravity of man; how came he depraved? Nor\r\n     is it more consoling to declare that all human institutions must\r\n     change and perish. Why must they? Human institutions, if founded\r\n     upon eternal principles, become divine, and may be immortal; it\r\n     is not the human, but the inhuman institutions which perish; not\r\n     humanity, but inhumanity which fills the earth with strife and\r\n     blood.\r\n\r\n     No! there is behind and below all these imaginary causes, a real\r\n     cause for the degeneracy of the race. It may be traced to the\r\n     long continued disregard of the laws of God in relation to woman,\r\n     and the retribution is worked out physiologically upon the whole\r\n     nature of man, reaching every tissue of his body and every\r\n     faculty of his mind.\r\n\r\n     It is a law of God, well understood, that whenever and wherever\r\n     any community forcibly depresses any class of its people below\r\n     the general level, it not only injures and degrades that class,\r\n     but is itself injured, degraded, and deranged in exact proportion\r\n     to the wrong it perpetrates. Whenever we crowd any portion of our\r\n     fellow-beings into an abyss of ignorance and servitude, we are\r\n     drawn irresistibly, by their weight, to the brink of the same\r\n     gulf.\r\n\r\n     If this be the inevitable result of the oppression of an\r\n     individual, or a class, how much more forcibly must it apply when\r\n     one-half the world, the \"mothers of the living,\" are made subject\r\n     to systematic deprivation of rights and tyrannous restriction in\r\n     the exercise of high and noble faculties.\r\n\r\n     I do not propose to detail the disabilities under which woman\r\n     suffers. They have been ably depicted by women in this meeting.\r\n     But I wish to indicate the breadth and basis of this reform, for\r\n     the consideration of those people who suppose it to be a\r\n     fractional and transient movement.\r\n\r\n     Whatever suffering or degradation woman is subjected to, by the\r\n     depression of the whole sex below the level of society, reacts\r\n     with frightful force upon man; who is thus compelled to\r\n     compensate for the cruel and mistaken policy, which, in all time,\r\n     has denied to her equal opportunities of education and\r\n     development, closed to her those avenues to profit and progress\r\n     open to him, ignored her in the Church and State as feeble and\r\n     inferior, rejected her counsels, and derided her authority in the\r\n     creation of those institutions of society to which not only she,\r\n     but her children are to be subject; although, if there be any\r\n     induction more striking than another it is this, that a child,\r\n     who is the offspring of the physical union of man and woman, can\r\n     only be truly educated and nurtured by institutions springing\r\n     from the unity of mental and moral elements in the father and\r\n     mother.\r\n\r\n     This universal ignoring of the feminine element pervades not only\r\n     the politics, but the religion of every country on earth. Men\r\n     worship, as their supreme God, only an embodiment of the\r\n     masculine element--\"Power,\" whether in Jove or Jehovah; and ever\r\n     in the Christian Trinity or Unity, the same masculine ideal is\r\n     maintained. Jesus did, indeed, recognize the feminine element in\r\n     His emphatic declaration that \"God is Love,\" but His professed\r\n     followers have \"not so learned Him,\" for they not only declare\r\n     God to be a triune masculinity, but they have driven woman from\r\n     the pulpit, and would dispute with her the place at the cross and\r\n     the sepulchre.\r\n\r\n     The religions of antiquity permitted woman to be a priestess at\r\n     the expense of wifehood and maternity, but our Christian\r\n     Protestantism denies to her the mission of minister, even with\r\n     that penalty. It is true the Catholic Church does recognize women\r\n     among its divinities, and it might be a curious and instructive\r\n     inquiry, how far that Church owes its perpetuity, despite its\r\n     gigantic crimes and crushing despotism, to the recognition of\r\n     \"Mary the mother of God.\" In its effort to perpetuate the\r\n     servitude of woman, as in other attempts to defend oppression\r\n     and falsehood, society has suborned the handmaids of progress,\r\n     Religion and Science, to justify its wickedness; the one to prove\r\n     inferiority from her organism, the other to add the weight of its\r\n     anathema against any effort at equality.\r\n\r\n     But Nature vindicates herself against the first, by presenting De\r\n     Staël, Margaret Fuller, and others; and to the cavilling bigot it\r\n     may be said that whoever declared that \"man is the head of the\r\n     woman,\" if he designed to justify the present interpretation of\r\n     that expression, has forfeited all claim to the apostleship of a\r\n     religion whose highest merit it is to equalize the people by\r\n     elevating the oppressed. But Paul taught no such doctrine.\r\n\r\n     The result of all this circumscription of woman has been to\r\n     enfeeble and misdirect her faculties, to weaken the influence of\r\n     her nature upon society and especially upon her offspring. Driven\r\n     from the thousand avenues to wealth and position open to man,\r\n     denied access to the best institutions of learning, permitted to\r\n     acquire only superficial accomplishments, she is ushered into\r\n     society at an age when her brothers are preparing to enter\r\n     colleges and halls of learning from which she is excluded, and\r\n     thus undeveloped and comparatively helpless, her instincts\r\n     vitiated and no freedom for her affinities, she is turned adrift\r\n     to encounter obstacles for which she is unprepared, and in the\r\n     severe conflict to barter her honor for subsistence; or if she\r\n     escape that horrible contingency, to exchange her beauty or her\r\n     services for a matrimonial establishment, and thus prepare to\r\n     perpetuate human degeneracy.\r\n\r\n     There are many exceptions to this statement, but the statement is\r\n     the rule. From these unequal and discordant relations, and the\r\n     feeble and restricted influence of the mother, spring generations\r\n     of children who are born constitutionally defective in the\r\n     feminine qualities of gentleness, purity, and love; and the utter\r\n     rejection of that element in the societary arrangements under\r\n     which they grow to manhood, aggravates their inherited\r\n     tendencies, until whole nations of warriors founding governments\r\n     of blood have filled the earth, and war and rapine have not only\r\n     become the occupation and the pastime of man, but have grown into\r\n     his religion and become incarnate in the Deities he worships.\r\n\r\n     It is thus that the seeds of violence and vice are sown with the\r\n     germs of the generations, and they spring to a frightful harvest\r\n     in each succeeding growth of the race. Millions of human beings\r\n     issue into life, pre-ordained--not in the theological, but in the\r\n     physiological sense--to violence and crime, and they go forth to\r\n     make their calling and election sure. From these the world\r\n     recruits its armies, renews its tyrants, refills its slave-pens\r\n     and its brothels, populates its prisons, alms-houses, and\r\n     asylums. It is in vain to hope for other results while woman,\r\n     upon whom, as \"mother of the living,\" depends the progress of\r\n     man, is denied any other than a limited and indirect influence in\r\n     the fabric of society.\r\n\r\n     We may abolish slavery, remove intemperance, banish war and\r\n     licentiousness, but they will have frightful reproduction in the\r\n     elemental discord of our natures; for that which is \"in us will\r\n     be revealed.\" Man indicates his condition by the institutions he\r\n     creates; they are the issues of the life he lives at the time,\r\n     the outward sign of his inward state.\r\n\r\n     To improve that inward condition, and arrest at their origin\r\n     these causes of human degeneracy, is the object of this reform.\r\n     It proposes, as before stated, not only to cure, but to prevent\r\n     the diseases of the body politic; to place man and woman in such\r\n     natural and true relations of equal and mutual development, and\r\n     to so sanctify marriage that from their union under the highest\r\n     auspices, a regenerate humanity shall not only cease to be\r\n     violent and vicious, but shall outgrow the dispositions to\r\n     violence and vice.\r\n\r\n     We know that this is a work for whole generations, but as we\r\n     believe it to be radical and effectual, it should be at once\r\n     begun. We think the first great step is to clear away the rubbish\r\n     of ages from the pathway of woman, to abolish the onerous\r\n     restrictions which environ her in every direction, to open to her\r\n     the temples of religion, the halls of science and of art, and the\r\n     marts of commerce, affording her the same opportunity for\r\n     education and occupation now enjoyed by man; no longer, by\r\n     corrupt public sentiment and partial legislation, to limit her to\r\n     a few and poorly paid pursuits to obtain subsistence and thus\r\n     increase her dependence upon the charity of man, nor to deny her\r\n     admission to any institution of learning, whose richly endowed\r\n     professorships and vast advantages she by her labor has\r\n     contributed to create, only to see them monopolized by man. I\r\n     know that in answer to this it is urged that she has organic\r\n     limits intellectually which deny to her such attainments. It is\r\n     sufficient to reply, that under all the disabilities to which she\r\n     is subject, her sex has produced De Staël and Margaret Fuller.\r\n\r\nLetters were read from Mary Mott, of Auburn, De Kalb County, Indiana;\r\nPaulina Wright Davis, Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, William and Mary\r\nJohnson, and a series of resolutions passed.[69] Oliver Johnson took\r\nan active part in the discussions, and at the close of the Convention,\r\nmoved a resolution of thanks to the friends who had come from a\r\ndistance, and contributed so much to the success of the meeting. The\r\nConvention then adjourned _sine die_.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, Richard H. Dana, of Boston, well known as a man of rare\r\nliterary culture, delivered a lecture on womanhood throughout the\r\ncountry. He ridiculed the new demand of American women for civil and\r\npolitical rights, and for a larger sphere of action, and eulogized\r\nShakespeare's women, especially Desdemona, Ophelia, and Juliet, and\r\nrecommended them to his dissatisfied countrywomen as models of\r\ninnocence, tenderness, and confiding love in man, for their study and\r\nimitation.\r\n\r\nHe gave this lecture in Philadelphia, and Lucretia Mott was in the\r\naudience. At the close she asked an introduction, and told him that\r\nwhile she had been much interested in his lecture, and profited by the\r\ninformation it contained, she could not respond to his idea of\r\nwoman's true character and destiny. \"I am very sorry,\" he replied\r\nquickly, at the first word of criticism, and rushed out of the house,\r\nleaving Mrs. Mott, who had hoped to modify his views, somewhat\r\ntransfixed with surprise. In describing the scene to some friends\r\nafterward, she remarked that she had never been treated with more\r\nrudeness by one supposed to understand the rules of etiquette that\r\nshould always govern the behavior of a gentleman.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, she delivered the following discourse in the Assembly\r\nbuildings in Philadelphia. After giving the Bible view of woman's\r\nposition as an equal,\r\n\r\n     LUCRETIA MOTT said: I have not come here with a view of answering\r\n     any particular parts of the lecture alluded to, in order to point\r\n     out the fallacy of its reasoning. The speaker, however, did not\r\n     profess to offer anything like argument on that occasion, but\r\n     rather a sentiment. I have no prepared address to deliver to you,\r\n     being unaccustomed to speak in that way; but I felt a wish to\r\n     offer some views for your consideration, though in a desultory\r\n     manner, which may lead to such reflection and discussion as will\r\n     present the subject in a true light.\r\n\r\n     Why should not woman seek to be a reformer? If she is to shrink\r\n     from being such an iconoclast as shall \"break the image of man's\r\n     lower worship,\" as so long held up to view; if she is to fear to\r\n     exercise her reason, and her noblest powers, lest she should be\r\n     thought to \"attempt to act the man,\" and not \"acknowledge his\r\n     supremacy\"; if she is to be satisfied with the narrow sphere\r\n     assigned her by man, nor aspire to a higher, lest she should\r\n     transcend the bounds of female delicacy; truly it is a mournful\r\n     prospect for woman. We would admit all the difference, that our\r\n     great and beneficent Creator has made, in the relation of man and\r\n     woman, nor would we seek to disturb this relation; but we deny\r\n     that the present position of woman is her true sphere of\r\n     usefulness; nor will she attain to this sphere, until the\r\n     disabilities and disadvantages, religious, civil, and social,\r\n     which impede her progress, are removed out of her way. These\r\n     restrictions have enervated her mind and paralyzed her powers.\r\n     While man assumes that the present is the original state designed\r\n     for woman, that the existing \"differences are not arbitrary nor\r\n     the result of accident,\" but grounded in nature; she will not\r\n     make the necessary effort to obtain her just rights, lest it\r\n     should subject her to the kind of scorn and contemptuous manner\r\n     in which she has been spoken of.\r\n\r\n     So far from her \"ambition leading her to attempt to act the man,\"\r\n     she needs all the encouragement she can receive, by the removal\r\n     of obstacles from her path, in order that she may become the\r\n     \"true woman.\" As it is desirable that man should act a manly and\r\n     generous part, not \"mannish,\" so let woman be urged to exercise a\r\n     dignified and womanly bearing, not womanish. Let her cultivate\r\n     all the graces and proper accomplishments of her sex, but let not\r\n     these degenerate into a kind of effeminacy, in which she is\r\n     satisfied to be the mere plaything or toy of society, content\r\n     with her outward adornings, and the flattery and fulsome\r\n     adulation too often addressed to her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LUCRETIA MOTT (with autograph).]\r\n\r\n     Did Elizabeth Fry lose any of her feminine qualities by the\r\n     public walk into which she was called? Having performed the\r\n     duties of a mother to a large family, feeling that she owed a\r\n     labor of love to the poor prisoner, she was empowered by Him who\r\n     sent her forth, to go to kings and crowned heads of the earth,\r\n     and ask audience of these, and it was granted her. Did she lose\r\n     the delicacy of woman by her acts? No. Her retiring modesty was\r\n     characteristic of her to the latest period of her life. It was my\r\n     privilege to enjoy her society some years ago, and I found all\r\n     that belonged to the feminine in woman--to true nobility, in a\r\n     refined and purified moral nature. Is Dorothea Dix throwing off\r\n     her womanly nature and appearance in the course she is pursuing?\r\n     In finding duties abroad, has any \"refined man felt that\r\n     something of beauty has gone forth from her\"? To use the\r\n     contemptuous word applied in the lecture alluded to, is she\r\n     becoming \"mannish\"? Is she compromising her womanly dignity in\r\n     going forth to seek to better the condition of the insane and\r\n     afflicted? Is not a beautiful mind and a retiring modesty still\r\n     conspicuous in her?\r\n\r\n     Indeed, I would ask, if this modesty is not attractive also, when\r\n     manifested in the other sex? It was strikingly marked in Horace\r\n     Mann, when presiding over the late National Educational\r\n     Convention in this city. The retiring modesty of William Ellery\r\n     Channing was beautiful, as well as of many others who have filled\r\n     elevated stations in society. These virtues, differing as they\r\n     may in degree in man and woman, are of the same nature, and call\r\n     forth our admiration wherever manifested.\r\n\r\n     The noble courage of Grace Darling is justly honored for risking\r\n     her own life on the coast of England, during the raging storm, in\r\n     order to rescue the poor, suffering, shipwrecked mariner.\r\n\r\n     Woman was not wanting in courage in the early ages. In war and\r\n     bloodshed this trait was often displayed. Grecian and Roman\r\n     history have lauded and honored her in this character. English\r\n     history records her courageous women too, for unhappily we have\r\n     little but the records of war handed down to us. The courage of\r\n     Joan of Arc was made the subject of a popular lecture not long\r\n     ago by one of our intelligent citizens. But more noble, moral\r\n     daring is marking the female character at the present time, and\r\n     better worthy of imitation. As these characteristics come to be\r\n     appreciated in man too, his warlike acts with all the miseries\r\n     and horrors of the battle-ground will sink into their merited\r\n     oblivion, or be remembered only to be condemned. The heroism\r\n     displayed in the tented field must yield to the moral and\r\n     Christian heroism which is shadowed in the signs of our times.\r\n\r\n     The lecturer regarded the announcement of woman's achievements,\r\n     and the offering of appropriate praise through the press, as a\r\n     gross innovation upon the obscurity of female life--he complained\r\n     that the exhibition of attainments of girls in schools was now\r\n     equal to that of boys, and the newspapers announce that \"Miss\r\n     Brown received the first prize for English grammar,\" etc. If he\r\n     objected to so much excitement of emulation in schools, it would\r\n     be well; for the most enlightened teachers discountenance these\r\n     appeals to love of approbation and self-esteem. But while prizes\r\n     continue to be awarded, can any good reason be given why the name\r\n     of the girl should not be published as well as that of the boy?\r\n     He spoke with scorn, that \"we hear of Mrs. President so and so;\r\n     and committees and secretaries of the same sex.\" But if women can\r\n     conduct their own business, by means of presidents and\r\n     secretaries of their own sex, can he tell us why they should not?\r\n     They will never make much progress in any moral movement while\r\n     they depend upon men to act for them. Do we shrink from reading\r\n     the announcement that Mrs. Somerville is made an honorary member\r\n     of a scientific association? That Miss Herschel has made some\r\n     discoveries, and is prepared to take her equal part in science?\r\n     Or that Miss Mitchell, of Nantucket, has lately discovered a\r\n     planet, long looked for? I can not conceive why \"honor to whom\r\n     honor is due\" should not be rendered to woman as well as man; nor\r\n     will it necessarily exalt her, or foster feminine pride. This\r\n     propensity is found alike in male and female, and it should not\r\n     be ministered to improperly in either sex.\r\n\r\n     In treating upon the affections, the lecturer held out the idea\r\n     that as manifested in the sexes they were opposite if not\r\n     somewhat antagonistic, and required a union as in chemistry to\r\n     form a perfect whole. The simile appeared to me far from a\r\n     correct illustration of the true union. Minds that can\r\n     assimilate, spirits that are congenial, attract one another. It\r\n     is the union of similar, not of opposite affections, which is\r\n     necessary for the perfection of the marriage bond. There seemed a\r\n     want of proper delicacy in his representing man as being bold in\r\n     the demonstration of the pure affection of love. In persons of\r\n     refinement, true love seeks concealment in man as well as in\r\n     woman. I will not enlarge upon the subject, although it formed so\r\n     great a part of his lecture. The contrast drawn seemed a fallacy,\r\n     as has much, very much, that has been presented in the sickly\r\n     sentimental strains of the poet from age to age.\r\n\r\n     The question is often asked, \"What does woman want, more than she\r\n     enjoys? What is she seeking to obtain? Of what rights is she\r\n     deprived? What privileges are withheld from her?\" I answer, she\r\n     asks nothing as favor, but as right; she wants to be acknowledged\r\n     a moral, responsible being. She is seeking not to be governed by\r\n     laws in the making of which she has no voice. She is deprived of\r\n     almost every right in civil society, and is a cipher in the\r\n     nation, except in the right of presenting a petition. In\r\n     religious society her disabilities have greatly retarded her\r\n     progress. Her exclusion from the pulpit or ministry, her duties\r\n     marked out for her by her equal brother man, subject to creeds,\r\n     rules, and disciplines made for her by him, is unworthy her true\r\n     dignity.\r\n\r\n     In marriage there is assumed superiority on the part of the\r\n     husband, and admitted inferiority with a promise of obedience on\r\n     the part of the wife. This subject calls loudly for examination\r\n     in order that the wrong may be redressed. Customs suited to\r\n     darker ages in Eastern countries are not binding upon enlightened\r\n     society. The solemn covenant of marriage may be entered into\r\n     without these lordly assumptions and humiliating concessions and\r\n     promises.\r\n\r\n     There are large Christian denominations who do not recognize\r\n     such degrading relations of husband and wife. They ask no aid\r\n     from magistrate or clergyman to legalize or sanctify this union.\r\n     But acknowledging themselves in the presence of the Highest and\r\n     invoking His assistance, they come under reciprocal obligations\r\n     of fidelity and affection, before suitable witnesses. Experience\r\n     and observation go to prove that there may be as much harmony, to\r\n     say the least, in such a union, and as great purity and\r\n     permanence of affection, as can exist where the common ceremony\r\n     is observed.\r\n\r\n     The distinctive relations of husband and wife, of father and\r\n     mother of a family, are sacredly preserved, without the\r\n     assumption of authority on the one part, or the promise of\r\n     obedience on the other. There is nothing in such a marriage\r\n     degrading to woman. She does not compromise her dignity or\r\n     self-respect; but enters married life upon equal ground, by the\r\n     side of her husband. By proper education, she understands her\r\n     duties, physical, intellectual, and moral; and fulfilling these,\r\n     she is a helpmeet in the true sense of the word.\r\n\r\n     I tread upon delicate ground in alluding to the institutions of\r\n     religious Associations; but the subject is of so much importance\r\n     that all which relates to the position of woman should be\r\n     examined apart from the undue veneration which ancient usage\r\n     receives.\r\n\r\n          \"Such dupes are men to custom, and so prone\r\n          To reverence what is ancient, and can plead\r\n          A course of long observance for its use,\r\n          That even servitude, the worst of ills,\r\n          Because delivered down from sire to son,\r\n          Is kept and guarded as a sacred thing.\"\r\n\r\n     So with woman. She has so long been subject to the disabilities\r\n     and restrictions with which her progress has been embarrassed,\r\n     that she has become enervated, her mind to some extent paralyzed;\r\n     and like those still more degraded by personal bondage, she hugs\r\n     her chains. Liberty is often presented in its true light, but it\r\n     is liberty for man. I would not go so far, either as regards the\r\n     abject slave or woman; for in both cases they may be so degraded\r\n     by the crushing influences around them, that they may not be\r\n     sensible of the blessings of freedom. Liberty is not less a\r\n     blessing, because oppression has so long darkened the mind that\r\n     it can not appreciate it. I would, therefore, urge that woman be\r\n     placed in such a situation in society, by the recognition of her\r\n     rights, and have such opportunities for growth and development,\r\n     as shall raise her from this low, enervated, and paralyzed\r\n     condition, to a full appreciation of the blessing of entire\r\n     freedom of mind.\r\n\r\n     It is with reluctance that I make the demand for the political\r\n     rights of women, because this claim is so distasteful to the age.\r\n     Woman shrinks, in the present state of society, from taking any\r\n     interest in politics. The events of the French Revolution, and\r\n     the claim for woman's rights, are held up to her as a warning.\r\n     Let us not look at the excesses of women alone, at that period;\r\n     but remember that the age was marked with extravagances and\r\n     wickedness in men as well as women. Political life abounds with\r\n     these excesses and with shameful outrage. Who knows but that if\r\n     woman acted her part in governmental affairs, there might be an\r\n     entire change in the turmoil of political life? It becomes man to\r\n     speak modestly of his ability to act without her. If woman's\r\n     judgment were exercised, why might she not aid in making the laws\r\n     by which she is governed? Lord Brougham remarked that the works\r\n     of Harriet Martineau upon Political Economy were not excelled by\r\n     those of any political writer of the present time. The first few\r\n     chapters of her \"Society in America,\" her views of a Republic,\r\n     and of government generally, furnish evidence of woman's capacity\r\n     to embrace subjects of universal interest.\r\n\r\n     Far be it from me to encourage women to vote, or to take an\r\n     active part in politics in the present state of our government.\r\n     Her right to the elective franchise, however, is the same, and\r\n     should be yielded to her, whether she exercise that right or not.\r\n     Would that man, too, would have no participation in a government\r\n     recognizing the life-taking principle; retaliation and the sword.\r\n     It is unworthy a Christian nation. But when in the diffusion of\r\n     light and intelligence a Convention shall be called to make\r\n     regulations for self-government on Christian principles, I can\r\n     see no good reason why women should not participate in such an\r\n     assemblage, taking part equally with man.\r\n\r\n     Professor Walker, of Cincinnati, in his \"Introduction to American\r\n     Law,\" says: \"With regard to political rights, females form a\r\n     positive exception to the general doctrine of equality. They have\r\n     no part or lot in the formation or administration of government.\r\n     They cannot vote or hold office. We require them to contribute\r\n     their share in the way of taxes to the support of government, but\r\n     allow them no voice in its direction. We hold them amenable to\r\n     the laws when made, but allow them no share in making them. This\r\n     language applied to males would be the exact definition of\r\n     political slavery; applied to females custom does not teach us so\r\n     to regard it.\" Woman, however, is beginning so to regard it.\r\n\r\n     He further says: \"The law of husband and wife, as you gather it\r\n     from the books, is a disgrace to any civilized nation. The theory\r\n     of the law degrades the wife almost to the level of slaves. When\r\n     a woman marries, we call her condition coverture, and speak of\r\n     her as a _femme covert_. The old writers call the husband baron,\r\n     and sometimes in plain English, lord.... The merging of her name\r\n     in that of her husband is emblematic of the fate of all her legal\r\n     rights. The torch of Hymen serves but to light the pile on which\r\n     these rights are offered up. The legal theory is, that marriage\r\n     makes the husband and wife one person, and that person is the\r\n     husband. On this subject, reform is loudly called for. There is\r\n     no foundation in reason or expediency for the absolute and\r\n     slavish subjection of the wife to the husband, which forms the\r\n     foundation of the present legal relations. Were woman, in point\r\n     of fact, the abject thing which the law in theory considers her\r\n     to be when married, she would not be worthy the companionship of\r\n     man.\"\r\n\r\n     I would ask if such a code of laws does not require change? If\r\n     such a condition of the wife in society does not claim redress?\r\n     On no good ground can reform be delayed. Blackstone says: \"The\r\n     very being and legal existence of woman is suspended during\r\n     marriage; incorporated or consolidated into that of her husband\r\n     under whose protection and cover she performs everything.\"\r\n     Hurlbut, in his Essay upon Human Rights, says: \"The laws touching\r\n     the rights of women are at variance with the laws of the Creator.\r\n     Rights are human rights, and pertain to human beings without\r\n     distinction of sex. Laws should not be made for man or for\r\n     woman, but for mankind. Man was not born to command, nor woman to\r\n     obey.... The law of France, Spain, and Holland, and one of our\r\n     own States, Louisiana, recognizes the wife's right to property,\r\n     more than the common law of England.... The laws depriving woman\r\n     of the right of property are handed down to us from dark and\r\n     feudal times, and are not consistent with the wiser, better,\r\n     purer spirit of the age. The wife is a mere pensioner on the\r\n     bounty of her husband. Her lost rights are appropriated to\r\n     himself. But justice and benevolence are abroad in our land\r\n     awakening the spirit of inquiry and innovation; and the Gothic\r\n     fabric of the British law will fall before it, save where it is\r\n     based upon the foundation of truth and justice.\"\r\n\r\n     May these statements lead you to reflect upon this subject, that\r\n     you may know what woman's condition is in society, what her\r\n     restrictions are, and seek to remove them. In how many cases in\r\n     our country the husband and wife begin life together, and by\r\n     equal industry and united effort accumulate to themselves a\r\n     comfortable home. In the event of the death of the wife the\r\n     household remains undisturbed, his farm or his workshop is not\r\n     broken up or in any way molested. But when the husband dies he\r\n     either gives his wife a portion of their joint accumulation, or\r\n     the law apportions to her a share; the homestead is broken up,\r\n     and she is dispossessed of that which she earned equally with\r\n     him; for what she lacked in physical strength she made up in\r\n     constancy of labor and toil, day and evening. The sons then\r\n     coming into possession of the property, as has been the custom\r\n     until of later time, speak of having to keep their mother, when\r\n     she in reality is aiding to keep them. Where is the justice of\r\n     this state of things? The change in the law of this State and of\r\n     New York in relation to the property of the wife, goes to a\r\n     limited extent toward the redress of these wrongs which are far\r\n     more extensive and involve much more than I have time this\r\n     evening to point out.\r\n\r\n     On no good ground can the legal existence of the wife be\r\n     suspended during marriage, and her property surrendered to her\r\n     husband. In the intelligent ranks of society the wife may not in\r\n     point of fact be so degraded as the law would degrade her;\r\n     because public sentiment is above the law. Still, while the law\r\n     stands, she is liable to the disabilities which it imposes. Among\r\n     the ignorant classes of society, woman is made to bear heavy\r\n     burdens, and is degraded almost to the level of the slave. There\r\n     are many instances now in our city, where the wife suffers much\r\n     from the power of the husband to claim all that she can earn with\r\n     her own hands. In my intercourse with the poorer class of people,\r\n     I have known cases of extreme cruelty from the hard earnings of\r\n     the wife being thus robbed by the husband, and no redress at law.\r\n\r\n     An article in one of the daily papers lately presented the\r\n     condition of needle-women in England. There might be a\r\n     presentation of this class in our own country which would make\r\n     the heart bleed. Public attention should be turned to this\r\n     subject in order that avenues of more profitable employment may\r\n     be opened to women. There are many kinds of business which women,\r\n     equally with men, may follow with respectability and success.\r\n     Their talents and energies should be called forth, and their\r\n     powers brought into the highest exercise. The efforts of women in\r\n     France are sometimes pointed to in ridicule and sarcasm, but\r\n     depend upon it, the opening of profitable employment to women in\r\n     that country is doing much for the enfranchisement of the sex.\r\n     In England and America it is not an uncommon thing for a wife to\r\n     take up the business of her deceased husband and carry it on with\r\n     success.\r\n\r\n     Our respected British Consul stated to me a circumstance which\r\n     occurred some years ago, of an editor of a political paper having\r\n     died in England; it was proposed to his wife, an able writer, to\r\n     take the editorial chair. She accepted. The patronage of the\r\n     paper was greatly increased, and she a short time since retired\r\n     from her labors with a handsome fortune. In that country,\r\n     however, the opportunities are by no means general for woman's\r\n     elevation.\r\n\r\n     In visiting the public school in London a few years since, I\r\n     noticed that the boys were employed in linear drawing, and\r\n     instructed upon the black-board in the higher branches of\r\n     arithmetic and mathematics; while the girls, after a short\r\n     exercise in the mere elements of arithmetic, were seated during\r\n     the bright hours of the morning, stitching wristbands. I asked\r\n     why there should be this difference made; why the girls too\r\n     should not have the black-board? The answer was, that they would\r\n     not probably fill any station in society requiring such\r\n     knowledge.\r\n\r\n     The demand for a more extended education will not cease until\r\n     girls and boys have equal instruction in all the departments of\r\n     useful knowledge. We have as yet no high-school in this State.\r\n     The normal school may be a preparation for such an establishment.\r\n     In the late convention for general education, it was cheering to\r\n     hear the testimony borne to woman's capabilities for head\r\n     teachers of the public schools. A resolution there offered for\r\n     equal salaries to male and female teachers when equally\r\n     qualified, as practiced in Louisiana. I regret to say, was\r\n     checked in its passage by Bishop Potter; by him who has done so\r\n     much for the encouragement of education, and who gave his\r\n     countenance and influence to that Convention. Still, the fact of\r\n     such a resolution being offered, augurs a time coming for woman\r\n     which she may well hail. At the last examination of the public\r\n     schools in this city, one of the alumni delivered an address on\r\n     Woman, not as is too common in eulogistic strains, but directing\r\n     the attention to the injustice done to woman in her position in\r\n     society in a variety of ways, the unequal wages she receives for\r\n     her constant toil, etc., presenting facts calculated to arouse\r\n     attention to the subject.\r\n\r\n     Women's property has been taxed equally with that of men's to\r\n     sustain colleges endowed by the States; but they have not been\r\n     permitted to enter those high seminaries of learning. Within a\r\n     few years, however, some colleges have been instituted where\r\n     young women are admitted upon nearly equal terms with young men;\r\n     and numbers are availing themselves of their long denied rights.\r\n     This is among the signs of the times, indicative of an advance\r\n     for women. The book of knowledge is not opened to her in vain.\r\n     Already is she aiming to occupy important posts of honor and\r\n     profit in our country. We have three females editors in our\r\n     State, and some in other States of the Union. Numbers are\r\n     entering the medical profession; one received a diploma last\r\n     year; others are preparing for a like result.\r\n\r\n     Let woman then go on, not asking favors, but claiming as right,\r\n     the removal of all hindrances to her elevation in the scale of\r\n     being; let her receive encouragement for the proper cultivation\r\n     of all her powers, so that she may enter profitably into the\r\n     active business of life; employing her own hands in ministering\r\n     to her necessities, strengthening her physical being by proper\r\n     exercise and observance of the laws of health. Let her not be\r\n     ambitious to display a fair hand and to promenade the\r\n     fashionable streets of our city, but rather, coveting earnestly\r\n     the best gifts, let her strive to occupy such walks in society as\r\n     will befit her true dignity in all the relations of life. No fear\r\n     that she will then transcend the proper limits of female\r\n     delicacy. True modesty will be as fully preserved in acting out\r\n     those important vocations, as in the nursery or at the fireside\r\n     ministering to man's self-indulgence. Then in the marriage union,\r\n     the independence of the husband and wife will be equal, their\r\n     dependence mutual, and their obligations reciprocal.\r\n\r\n     In conclusion, let me say, with Nathaniel P. Willis: \"Credit not\r\n     the old-fashioned absurdity that woman's is a secondary lot,\r\n     ministering to the necessities of her lord and master! It is a\r\n     higher destiny I would award you. If your immortality is as\r\n     complete, and your gift of mind as capable as ours of increase\r\n     and elevation, I would put no wisdom of mine against God's\r\n     evident allotment. I would charge you to water the undying bud,\r\n     and give it healthy culture, and open its beauty to the sun; and\r\n     then you may hope that when your life is bound up with another,\r\n     you will go on equally and in a fellowship that shall pervade\r\n     every earthly interest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL CONVENTION IN PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\nOctober 18, 1854, the Fifth National Convention was held in Sansom\r\nStreet Hall, where a large audience, chiefly of ladies, assembled at\r\nan early hour.\r\n\r\nAt half-past ten o'clock Lucretia Mott made her appearance on the\r\nplatform, accompanied by several ladies and gentlemen, notably Lucy\r\nStone in Bloomer costume. She was the observed of all observers; the\r\nneatness of her attire, and the grace with which she wore it, did much\r\nto commend it to public approval. The press remarked that the officers\r\nof the Convention were all without bonnets, and that many ladies in\r\nthe audience had their knitting-work. \"A casual visitor,\" says _The\r\nBulletin_, \"would have been impressed with the number and character of\r\nthis assembly, both among the actors and spectators. Every variety of\r\nage, sex, race, color, and costume were here represented. Bloomers\r\nwere side by side with the mouse-colored gowns and white shawls of the\r\nwealthy Quaker dames, and genteelly dressed ladies of the latest Paris\r\nfashion.\"\r\n\r\nThe house was crowded, and on the steps ascending the platform were\r\nseated William Lloyd Garrison and James Mott, side by side with men of\r\nthe darkest hue. The colored people scattered through the audience\r\nseemed quite at their ease, and were evidently received on grounds of\r\nperfect equality, which was the subject of much comment by outsiders.\r\n\r\nMrs. Frances D. Gage, President of the last Convention at Cleveland,\r\ncalled the assembly to order, and read\r\n\r\n                              THE CALL.\r\n\r\n     In accordance with a vote passed at the adjournment of the\r\n     Woman's Rights Convention held in Cleveland, Ohio, in October,\r\n     1853, the Fifth National Convention will be held in Philadelphia,\r\n     October 18th, to continue three days. The subjects for\r\n     consideration will be the Equal Right of Woman to all the\r\n     advantages of education, literary, scientific, artistic; to full\r\n     equality in all business avocations, industrial, commercial,\r\n     professional; briefly, all the rights that belong to her as a\r\n     citizen.\r\n\r\n     This wide range of subjects for discussion can not fail to awaken\r\n     the attention of all classes; hence we invite all persons\r\n     irrespective of sex or color to take part in the deliberations of\r\n     the Convention, and thus contribute to the progress of truth and\r\n     the redemption of humanity.\r\n\r\n               On behalf of the Central Committee,\r\n\r\n                                   PAULINA WRIGHT DAVIS, _President_.\r\n                                   ANTOINETTE L. BROWN, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\nThe following officers were chosen for the Convention:\r\n\r\n     PRESIDENT.--Ernestine L. Rose, of New York.\r\n\r\n     VICE-PRESIDENTS.--Lucretia Mott, Philadelphia; Frances D. Gage,\r\n     Missouri; Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Massachusetts; Martha C.\r\n     Wright, New York; Thomas Garrett, Delaware; Hannah Tracy Cutler,\r\n     Illinois; Robert Purvis; Pennsylvania; John O. Wattles, Indiana;\r\n     Marenda B. Randall, Vermont; George Sunter, Canada.\r\n\r\n     SECRETARIES.--Joseph A. Dugdale, Abby Kimber, Hannah M.\r\n     Darlington.\r\n\r\n     BUSINESS COMMITTEE.--Lucy Stone, William Lloyd Garrison, Myra\r\n     Townsend, Mary P. Wilson, Sarah Pugh, Lydia Mott, Mary Grew.\r\n\r\n     FINANCE COMMITTEE.--Susan B. Anthony, James Mott, Ruth Dugdale,\r\n     Rebecca Plumbly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rose, on taking the chair, said:\r\n\r\n     There is one argument which in my estimation is the argument of\r\n     arguments, why woman should have her rights; not on account of\r\n     expediency, not on account of policy, though these too show the\r\n     reasons why she should have her rights; but we claim--I for one\r\n     claim, and I presume all our friends claim--our rights on the\r\n     broad ground of human rights; and I for one again will say, I\r\n     promise not how we shall use them. I will no more promise how we\r\n     shall use our rights than man has promised before he obtained\r\n     them, how he would use them. We all know that rights are often\r\n     abused; and above all things have human rights in this country\r\n     been abused, from the very fact that they have been withheld from\r\n     half of the community.\r\n\r\n     By human rights we mean natural rights, and upon that ground we\r\n     claim our rights, and upon that ground they have already been\r\n     conceded by the Declaration of Independence, in that first great\r\n     and immutable truth which is proclaimed in that instrument, \"that\r\n     all men are created equal,\" and that therefore all are entitled\r\n     to \"certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty,\r\n     and the pursuit of happiness.\" Our claims are based upon that\r\n     great and immutable truth, the rights of all humanity. For is\r\n     woman not included in that phrase, \"all men are created free and\r\n     equal\"? Is she not included in that expression? Tell us, ye men\r\n     of the nation, ay, ye wise law-makers and law-breakers of the\r\n     nation, whether woman is not included in that great Declaration\r\n     of Independence? And if she is, what right has man to deprive her\r\n     of her natural and inalienable rights? It is natural, it is\r\n     inherent, it is inborn, it is a thing of which no one can justly\r\n     deprive her. Upon that just and eternal basis do we found our\r\n     claims for our rights; political, civil, legal, social,\r\n     religious, and every other.\r\n\r\n     But, at the outset, we claim our equal political rights with man,\r\n     not only from that portion of the Declaration of Independence,\r\n     but from another, equally well-established principle in this\r\n     country, that \"taxation and representation are inseparable.\"\r\n     Woman, everybody knows, is taxed; and if she is taxed, she ought\r\n     to be represented.\r\n\r\n     I will simply here throw out a statement of these principles upon\r\n     which our claims are based; and I trust each separate resolution\r\n     will be taken up by this Convention, fully canvassed and\r\n     commented upon, so as to show it not only an abstract right, but\r\n     a right which can be wisely made practical.\r\n\r\n     Again, it is acknowledged in this country, and it is eternally\r\n     true, that \"all the just powers of government are derived from\r\n     the consent of the governed.\" If so, then, as woman is a subject\r\n     of government, she ought to have a voice in enacting the laws. If\r\n     her property is taxed to maintain government, she ought to have a\r\n     voice in forming that government. If she has to pay taxes to\r\n     maintain government, she ought to have a voice in saying how\r\n     those taxes shall be applied.\r\n\r\n     On these grounds we make our claims, on natural, humane, eternal,\r\n     and well-recognized laws and principles of this republic. On\r\n     these grounds we ask man to meet us, and meet us in the spirit of\r\n     inquiry, in the spirit of candor and honesty, as rational human\r\n     beings ought to meet each other, face to face, and adduce\r\n     arguments, if they can, to convince us that we are not included\r\n     in that great Declaration of Independence; that although it is a\r\n     right principle that taxation and representation are inseparable,\r\n     yet woman ought to be taxed, and ought not to be represented; and\r\n     that although it is an acknowledged principle that all just power\r\n     of government is derived from the consent of the governed, yet\r\n     woman should be governed without her consent. Let them meet us\r\n     fairly and openly; let them meet us like rational men, men who\r\n     appreciate their own freedom, and we will hear them. If they can\r\n     convince us that we are wrong, we will give up our claims; but if\r\n     we can convince them that we are right in claiming our rights, as\r\n     they are in claiming theirs, then we expect them in a spirit of\r\n     candor and honesty to acknowledge it.\r\n\r\nJoseph Dugdale read several letters, which, as usual, seemed to be\r\nsomething of a bore to the audience. When he finished, Lucretia Mott\r\nsuggested that if there were any more lengthy epistles to be read, it\r\nwould be well for the secretaries to look them over, and omit all that\r\nin their wisdom might not be worth reading.\r\n\r\nLucy Stone, from the Business Committee, read a series of\r\nresolutions,[70] and as some one from the audience called, \"Louder!\"\r\nshe remarked that if ladies would keep their bonnets tied down over\r\ntheir ears, they must not ask others to find lungs of sufficient power\r\nto penetrate the heavy pasteboard and millinery over them. She spoke\r\nbriefly on the resolutions, and the steadily increasing interest in\r\nthe subject of woman's rights.\r\n\r\nHannah Tracy Cutler gave a report of Illinois, Frances Dana Gage of\r\nMissouri, and Susan B. Anthony of New York.\r\n\r\nThomas Wentworth Higginson, of Massachusetts, said he had a matter of\r\nbusiness to present. Mrs. Paulina Wright Davis being too ill to attend\r\nthe Convention, Mr. Higginson read a letter from her sister, Mary K.\r\nSpaulding, suggesting the establishment of a newspaper in the city of\r\nNew York as \"the national organ\" of the Woman's Rights movement. He\r\ndoubted the wisdom of such a step, and after setting forth the expense\r\nof a central organ and the great danger of its creating a schism, he\r\noffered the following resolutions:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That in the opinion of this Convention it is not\r\n     expedient, at present, to establish a newspaper as The National\r\n     Organ of the Woman's Rights Movement.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is expedient to appoint a Committee who shall\r\n     provide for the preparation and publication, in widely circulated\r\n     journals, facts and arguments relating to the cause.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. MOTT approved of the resolutions, and said they had arrived\r\n     at a similar conclusion in the Syracuse Convention; she fully\r\n     concurred in the views of Mr. Higginson.\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON replied, that if organization for any good\r\n     cause be right, it was right for this. Every reform movement\r\n     needs an organ of its own. And this cause needs a paper of the\r\n     most radical character; that shall make no compromises with\r\n     popular prejudices; far above the paralyzing influences of Church\r\n     and State.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. MOTT said she did not oppose organization, but was in favor\r\n     of individual freedom and responsibility. _The Liberator_, Mr.\r\n     Garrison's paper, has done far more good than _The Anti-Slavery\r\n     Standard_, the organ of the Anti-Slavery movement.\r\n\r\n     Mr. GARRISON said _The Liberator_ was not simply an anti-slavery\r\n     paper, but an advocate of general reform.\r\n\r\nRemarks were made on this point by Elizabeth Paxton, Susan H. Cox,\r\nGeorge P. Davis, and George Sunter, of Canada.\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE advocated the resolutions; her experience in the\r\n     anti-slavery cause had taught her a lesson of wisdom for this\r\n     movement. We are rich in principle and enthusiasm, but not in\r\n     silver and gold, and therefore should avoid taking on our\r\n     shoulders a national organ. Widely circulated journals are now\r\n     open to us, in which we can express our opinions with freedom and\r\n     without expense. There is nothing so strong as individual purpose\r\n     and freedom to carry it out. The papers established by Mrs.\r\n     Davis and Mrs. Bloomer are good, and she hoped the friends would\r\n     give generously to their support.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions were unanimously adopted, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton,\r\nof New York; Paulina Wright Davis, of Rhode Island; Thomas Wentworth\r\nHigginson and Lucy Stone, of Massachusetts; and Oliver Johnson, of New\r\nYork, were appointed as the Committee to superintend the work.\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE said she had a new item of business to propose. She\r\n     knew that those who came to these Conventions went away feeling\r\n     stronger and better. She held in her hand a pamphlet containing\r\n     five tracts; one from Wendell Phillips, one from Theodore Parker,\r\n     one from _The Westminster Review_, by Mrs. John Stuart Mill, one\r\n     from Mr. Higginson, and last, but not least, one from Mrs. C. I.\r\n     H. Nichols, which should be distributed. They were able papers,\r\n     and all interested in the movement should exert themselves to\r\n     circulate them. The people only wanted light.\r\n\r\n     Another mode of disseminating the principles was by stories\r\n     illustrating the wrongs of women under the present laws. The\r\n     right of a woman to what she earns; to the custody of her person;\r\n     to the guardianship of her children, and all of her other rights,\r\n     should be illustrated in fiction. Prizes should be offered for\r\n     the best stories upon these subjects. She pledged herself to\r\n     raise $500 for the purpose. She pointed to \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" to\r\n     show what fiction could accomplish, and trusted that action would\r\n     be taken upon the subject before the Convention adjourned.\r\n\r\n     Mr. GARRISONarose to say \"ditto to Lucy Stone.\" In regard to\r\n     \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" it was known that Mrs. Stowe was induced to\r\n     write it from a request of Dr. Bailey, of _The National Era_, to\r\n     write a story for his paper. And he thought that such an offer\r\n     might now call forth something to aid the cause of woman. He\r\n     praised the tracts to which Miss Stone alluded.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT appointed Wendell Phillips, Elizabeth Cady Stanton,\r\n     and Mary Channing Higginson, the Committee on prize tracts.[71]\r\n\r\n     Mrs. TRACY CUTLER read an invitation from the Female Medical\r\n     College for the members of the Convention to visit that\r\n     institution and attend its lectures, and took the opportunity to\r\n     compliment Philadelphia as being the first city, not only in the\r\n     United States, but in the world, to establish a Medical College\r\n     for Women.\r\n\r\n     Dr. ANN PRESTON gave an interesting report of The Woman's Medical\r\n     College; of all the persecutions women had encountered in\r\n     securing a medical education and entering that profession. She\r\n     noted the signs of a growing liberality with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n     The Rev. HENRY GREW, of Philadelphia, then appeared upon the\r\n     platform, and said he was sorry to differ from the general tone\r\n     of the speakers present, but he felt it to be his duty to give\r\n     his views on the questions under consideration. His opinions as\r\n     to woman's rights and duties were based on the Scriptures. He\r\n     quoted numerous texts to show that it was clearly the will of God\r\n     that man should be superior in power and authority to woman; and\r\n     asserted that no lesson is more plainly and frequently taught in\r\n     the Bible, than woman's subjection.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. CUTLER replied at length, and skillfully turned every text\r\n     he had quoted directly against the reverend gentleman, to the\r\n     great amusement of the audience. She showed that man and woman\r\n     were a simultaneous creation, with equal power and glory on their\r\n     heads, and that dominion over the fowl of the air, the fish of\r\n     the sea, and every creeping thing on the earth was given to them,\r\n     and not to man alone. The time has come for woman to read and\r\n     interpret Scripture for herself; too long have we learned God's\r\n     will from the lips of man and closed our eyes on the great book\r\n     of nature, and the safer teaching of our own souls. It is a pity\r\n     that those who would recommend the Bible as the revealed will of\r\n     the all-wise and benevolent Creator, should uniformly quote it on\r\n     the side of tyranny and oppression. I think we owe it to our\r\n     religion and ourselves to wrest it from such hands, and proclaim\r\n     the beautiful spirit breathed through all its commands and\r\n     precepts, instead of dwelling so much on isolated texts that have\r\n     no application to our day and generation.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. MOTT said: It is not Christianity, but priestcraft that has\r\n     subjected woman as we find her. The Church and State have been\r\n     united, and it is well for us to see it so. We have had to bear\r\n     the denunciations of these reverend (irreverend) clergymen, as in\r\n     New York, of late. But if we look to their authority to see how\r\n     they expound the text, quite likely we shall find a new reading.\r\n     Why, when John Chambers returned to Philadelphia from the World's\r\n     Temperance Convention at New York, he gave notice that he would\r\n     give an address, and state the rights of woman as defined by the\r\n     Bible. Great allowance has been made by some of the speakers in\r\n     this Convention, on account of his ignorance, and certainly this\r\n     was charitable. But I heard this discourse. I heard him bring up\r\n     what is called the Apostolic prohibition, and the old Eastern\r\n     idea of the subjection of wives; but he kept out of view some of\r\n     the best ideas in the Scriptures.\r\n\r\n     Blame is often attached to the position in which woman is found.\r\n     I blame her not so much as I pity her. So circumscribed have been\r\n     her limits that she does not realize the misery of her condition.\r\n     Such dupes are men to custom that even servitude, the worst of\r\n     ills, comes to be thought a good, till down from sire to son it\r\n     is kept and guarded as a sacred thing. Woman's existence is\r\n     maintained by sufferance. The veneration of man has been\r\n     misdirected, the pulpit has been prostituted, the Bible has been\r\n     ill-used. It has been turned over and over as in every reform.\r\n     The temperance people have had to feel its supposed\r\n     denunciations. Then the anti-slavery, and now this reform has\r\n     met, and still continues to meet, passage after passage of the\r\n     Bible, never intended to be so used. Instead of taking the truths\r\n     of the Bible in corroboration of the right, the practice has\r\n     been, to turn over its pages to find example and authority for\r\n     the wrong, for the existing abuses of society. For the usage of\r\n     drinking wine, the example of the sensualist Solomon, is always\r\n     appealed to. In reference to our reform, even admitting that Paul\r\n     did mean preach, when he used that term, he did not say that the\r\n     recommendation of that time was to be applicable to the churches\r\n     of all after-time. We have been so long pinning our faith on\r\n     other people's sleeves that we ought to begin examining these\r\n     things daily ourselves, to see whether they are so; and we should\r\n     find on comparing text with text, that a very different\r\n     construction might be put upon them. Some of our early Quakers\r\n     not seeing how far they were to be carried, became Greek and\r\n     Hebrew scholars, and they found that the text would bear other\r\n     translations as well as other constructions. All Bible\r\n     commentators agree that the Church of Corinth, when the apostle\r\n     wrote, was in a state of great confusion. They fell into\r\n     discussion and controversy; and in order to quiet this state of\r\n     things and bring the Church to greater propriety, the command was\r\n     given out that women should keep silence, and it was not\r\n     permitted them to speak, except by asking questions at home. In\r\n     the same epistle to the same Church, Paul gave express directions\r\n     how women shall prophesy, which he defines to be preaching,\r\n     \"speaking to men,\" for \"exhortation and comfort.\" He recognized\r\n     them in prophesying and praying. The word translated servant, is\r\n     applied to a man in one part of the Scripture, and in another it\r\n     is translated minister. Now that same word you will find might be\r\n     applied to Phebe, a deaconess. That text was quoted in the sermon\r\n     of John Chambers, and he interlarded it with a good many of his\r\n     ideas, that women should not be goers abroad, and read among\r\n     other things \"that their wives were to be teachers.\" But properly\r\n     translated would be \"deaconesses.\"\r\n\r\n     It is not so Apostolic to make the wife subject to the husband as\r\n     many have supposed. It has been done by law and public opinion\r\n     since that time. There has been a great deal said about sending\r\n     missionaries over to the East to convert women who are immolating\r\n     themselves on the funeral pile of their husbands. I know this may\r\n     be a very good work, but I would ask you to look at it. How many\r\n     women are there now immolated upon the shrine of superstition and\r\n     priestcraft, in our very midst, in the assumption that man only\r\n     has a right to the pulpit, and that if a woman enters it she\r\n     disobeys God; making woman believe in the misdirection of her\r\n     vocation, and that it is of divine authority that she should be\r\n     thus bound. Believe it not, my sisters. In this same epistle the\r\n     word \"prophesying\" should be \"preaching\"--\"preaching godliness,\"\r\n     etc. On the occasion of the first miracle which it is said Christ\r\n     wrought, a woman went before Him and said, \"Whatsoever he biddeth\r\n     you do, that do.\" The woman of Samaria said, \"Come and see the\r\n     man who told me all the things that ever I did.\"\r\n\r\n     These things are worthy of note. I do not want to dwell too much\r\n     upon Scripture authority. We too often bind ourselves by\r\n     authorities rather than by the truth. We are infidel to truth in\r\n     seeking examples to overthrow it. The very first act of note that\r\n     is mentioned when the disciples and apostles went forth after\r\n     Jesus was removed from them, was the bringing up of an ancient\r\n     prophecy to prove that they were right in the position they\r\n     assumed on that occasion, when men and women were gathered\r\n     together on the holy day of Pentecost, when every man heard and\r\n     saw those wonderful works which are recorded. Then Peter stood\r\n     forth--some one has said that Peter made a great mistake in\r\n     quoting the prophet Joel--but he stated that \"the time is come,\r\n     this day is fulfilled the prophecy, when it is said, I will pour\r\n     out my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters\r\n     shall prophesy,\" etc.--the language of the Bible is beautiful in\r\n     its repetition--\"upon my servants and my handmaidens I will pour\r\n     out my spirit and they shall prophesy.\" Now can anything be\r\n     clearer than that?\r\n\r\n     Rev. HENRY GREW again quoted Scripture in reply to Mrs. Mott, and\r\n     said the coming of Christ into the world did not restore man and\r\n     woman to the original condition of our first parents. If the\r\n     position assumed by the women be true, then must the Divine Word\r\n     from Genesis to Revelation be set aside as untrue, that woman may\r\n     be relieved from the, perhaps, unfortunate limitations that hold\r\n     her back in this age of progress.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HIGGINSON related a story of an old Methodist clergyman who\r\n     by chance stepped into a Quaker meeting where he heard a woman\r\n     speaking, which so shocked him that he thought Anti-Christ was\r\n     now bound to rule. He went home sad. He had four daughters, one\r\n     of whom, at the age of sixteen, in a few minutes opened the eyes\r\n     of his understanding after he had groped in darkness a long time,\r\n     by showing him a passage in the Testament describing a friend of\r\n     Paul's at Phillippi, who had four daughters that prophesied. This\r\n     girl referred her father to the Greek Testament, and showed him\r\n     that the original word, properly translated, means to preach\r\n     instead of to prophesy. Before we resort to Scriptural texts we\r\n     should be careful to ascertain that they are right, or all\r\n     arguments founded on them must fall.\r\n\r\n     Mr. GREW did not consider that the story of the four daughters\r\n     invalidated his position.\r\n\r\n     Mr. GARRISON said: Consulting the Bible for opinions as to\r\n     woman's rights, is of little importance to the majority of this\r\n     Convention. We have gone over the whole ground, and placed our\r\n     cause upon the decrees of nature. We _know_ that man and woman\r\n     are equal in the sight of God. We know that texts and books are\r\n     of no importance, and have no taste for the discussion of dry\r\n     doctrinal points.\r\n\r\n     But with the American people the case is different. The masses\r\n     believe the Bible directly from God; that it decrees the\r\n     inequality of the sexes; and that settles the question. There is\r\n     no doubt that there are many persons connected with the\r\n     Protestant churches who would be with the movement were it not\r\n     for the supposed Bible difficulty. They shudder at anything they\r\n     think against the Bible, as against the will of God. Take away\r\n     this incubus, and these persons would experience a change in\r\n     their views; they would be with us.\r\n\r\n     In regard to Mr. Grew, Mr. G. said he had long known him and\r\n     loved him. He was a man of purity and charity, and he was glad he\r\n     had given his views. Yet this kindly man did not stand upon a\r\n     solid foundation.\r\n\r\n     Why go to the Bible to settle this question? As a nation, we have\r\n     practically ignored the Bible. The assertion of the equality and\r\n     inalienability of the rights of man, in the Declaration of\r\n     Independence, includes the whole of the human race. He would\r\n     never attempt to prove to an American the right of any man to\r\n     liberty. He asserted the fact; and considered that in holding\r\n     slaves while they proclaimed liberty to all men, the American\r\n     people were hypocrites and tyrants. Mr. Grew goes to St. Paul to\r\n     prove that woman is not equal to man. Why go to the Bible? What\r\n     question was ever settled by the Bible? What question of theology\r\n     or any other department? None that I ever heard of! With this\r\n     same version of the Bible, and the same ability to read it, we\r\n     find that it has filled all Christendom with theological\r\n     confusion. All are Ishmaelites; each man's hand against his\r\n     neighbor.\r\n\r\n     The human mind is greater than any book. The mind sits in\r\n     judgment on every book. If there be truth in the book, we take\r\n     it; if error, we discard it. Why refer this to the Bible? In this\r\n     country, the Bible has been used to support slavery and capital\r\n     punishment; while in the old countries, it has been quoted to\r\n     sustain all manner of tyranny and persecution. All reforms are\r\n     anti-Bible. We must look at all things rationally. We find women\r\n     endowed with certain capacities, and it is of no importance if\r\n     any book denies her such capacities. Would Mr. Grew say that\r\n     woman can not preach, in the face of such a preacher as LUCRETIA\r\n     MOTT?\r\n\r\n     Mrs. MOTT begged leave to substitute friend Grew's own daughter,\r\n     Mary Grew, who has already spoken on this platform!! and said,\r\n     Mr. Grew himself does not take all the Bible as inspiration, in\r\n     which most of the speakers concurred. She expressed her\r\n     attachment to the Scriptures, and said many excellent lessons\r\n     could be learned from them. She showed the misinterpretations of\r\n     the texts quoted by Mr. Grew and others against the equality of\r\n     the sexes. Mr. Grew does not take the Bible for his guide,\r\n     altogether. Mrs. Mott then quoted St. Paul in regard to marriage,\r\n     and said: Why in opposition to that text has Mr. Grew married a\r\n     second time? It was because he did not really believe that the\r\n     Scriptures were entirely inspired.\r\n\r\n     EMMA R. COE made a few remarks on the position of the clergy\r\n     generally toward this reform, the most beneficent in its results\r\n     of any, man has ever yet been called upon to consider. We often\r\n     hear it remarked that woman owes so much to Christianity. It can\r\n     not be the Christianity that the clergy have proclaimed on our\r\n     platform. From them we hear only of woman's degradation and\r\n     subjection. We have certainly nothing to be thankful for if such\r\n     are the principles Christ came into the world to declare; the\r\n     subjection of one-half of the race to the other half, as far as\r\n     we are concerned, is no improvement upon the religions of all\r\n     nations and ages.\r\n\r\nAt the close of this protracted discussion on the Bible position of\r\nwoman, the following resolutions, presented by Mr. Garrison, were\r\nunanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That while remembering and gladly acknowledging the\r\n     exceptional cases which exist to the contrary, we feel it a duty\r\n     to declare in regard to the sacred cause which has brought us\r\n     together, that the most determined opposition it encounters is\r\n     from the clergy generally, whose teachings of the Bible are\r\n     intensely inimical to the equality of woman with man.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That whatever any book may teach, the rights of no\r\n     human being are dependent upon or modified thereby, but are\r\n     equal, absolute, essential, inalienable in the person of every\r\n     member of the human family, without regard to sex, race, or\r\n     clime.\r\n\r\n     JOHN SIDNEY JONES made a few remarks on the monopoly of the\r\n     pulpit.\r\n\r\n     SUSAN B. ANTHONY wished to remind the friends, before separating,\r\n     of one practical measure to be considered in the advancement of\r\n     our noble enterprise. For the purpose of holding Conventions,\r\n     circulating tracts and petitions, giving prizes for good stories,\r\n     supporting newspapers and agents, the first great requisite is\r\n     money, and I hope every one present will contribute generously to\r\n     help us carry on this grand reform.\r\n\r\n     Mr. GARRISON seconded Miss Anthony's demand for \"the sinews of\r\n     war.\" He said we Americans are a theoretical people, and we are\r\n     also a practical people. If the women intend to knock at the door\r\n     of every State house to demand their rights, the question must\r\n     be argued in a practical way with facts and statistics.\r\n\r\n     When I undertook to have the gallows abolished in Massachusetts,\r\n     I asked the Committee of the Legislature if they wanted a certain\r\n     number of Bible texts quoted on each side of the question, they\r\n     said, \"No, we want facts and statistics; we do not ask the\r\n     opinions of Moses and Aaron on this point, but the result of\r\n     human experience in the punishment of crime.\" So in this case;\r\n     Legislatures will not ask for nor appreciate Bible arguments;\r\n     they will ask for facts as to woman's achievements in education,\r\n     industry, and practical usefulness.\r\n\r\n     JOSEPH DUGDALE, whose special concern always seemed to be the\r\n     action of dead men on this question, said it had been his fortune\r\n     to be present at the making of the last wills and testaments of\r\n     many men, and he never knew of a case where a dying husband would\r\n     practically admit that his wife was his equal. He stated a case\r\n     in which a husband of his acquaintance proposed to leave a large\r\n     property, the inheritance and accumulation of his wife's labors,\r\n     to _her_ as long as she remained his widow, and then to divide it\r\n     among _his_ family relatives. And yet this husband claimed to\r\n     have great admiration and affection for this woman whom he would\r\n     deliberately rob of her inheritance from her own father. The\r\n     magnanimity of man passes all understanding!\r\n\r\n     Mrs. PRINCE, a colored woman, invoked the blessing of God upon\r\n     the noble women engaged in this enterprise, and said she\r\n     understood woman's wrongs better than woman's rights, and gave\r\n     some of her own experiences to illustrate the degradation of her\r\n     sex in slavery. On a voyage to the West Indies the vessel was\r\n     wrecked, and she was picked up and taken to New Orleans. Going up\r\n     the Mississippi she saw the terrible suffering of a cargo of\r\n     slaves on board, and on the plantations along the shores. On her\r\n     return voyage, attached to the steamboat was a brig containing\r\n     several hundred slaves, among them a large number of young\r\n     quadroon girls with infants in their arms as fair as any lady in\r\n     this room.\r\n\r\n     MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE spoke at length of the brilliant record of\r\n     women in the past in every department of human activity--in art,\r\n     science, literature, invention; of their heroism and patriotism\r\n     in time of war, and their industry and endurance in many equally\r\n     trying emergencies in time of peace. Woman has so fully proved\r\n     her equality with man in every position she has filled, that it\r\n     is too late now for clergymen on our platform to remand us to the\r\n     subjection of the women of Corinth centuries ago. We have learned\r\n     too well the lessons of liberty taught in our revolution to\r\n     accept now the position of slaves.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. TRACY CUTLER: It would appear, after all, that we women are\r\n     placed pretty much in the condition of the veriest slave. We must\r\n     prove our own humanity by exhibiting our skill in work. We must\r\n     bring forth our own samples; put them, as it were, on the\r\n     auction-block, and thus make our claim to equality of rights a\r\n     matter of dollars and cents. Is it here only that woman can touch\r\n     man's sympathy? She then described the degraded condition of\r\n     women in Europe, and particularly in London, where poverty and\r\n     the tyranny of man have driven women to despair, until they were\r\n     forced to prostitute their own bodies to procure bread. This\r\n     vice, horribly revolting as it is, seems to go hand in hand with\r\n     intemperance. She did not wish women to go into the field to be\r\n     yoked with mules, or to turn scavenger, to pick up rags and\r\n     crusts in the streets to carry home in their aprons. Men bring\r\n     the elements to their aid, and we wish women to do the same. She\r\n     then adverted to the difference in the labor of the kitchen and\r\n     other pursuits open to women. Let the printer advertise for two\r\n     girls to set type, and a hundred applications will be made, while\r\n     women for the kitchen are very scarce. The reason for this is,\r\n     that all other kinds of work are better paid. When woman's labor\r\n     is justly remunerated and equally respected in all departments of\r\n     industry, there will be no such difference in the supply of help\r\n     for the factory, shop, and kitchen.\r\n\r\n     FRANCES D. GAGE said: The reason why the work of the kitchen is\r\n     looked upon as degrading, is because the girl is never taken by\r\n     the hand. Where are your philanthropic ladies who assist her?\r\n     Where is she to go when her work is done? Does she sit in the\r\n     same room with you? Does she eat at the same table? No, to your\r\n     shame, she is confined to the basement and the garret. It is not\r\n     so much because the pay for kitchen labor is not so good, as it\r\n     is chiefly because of the public opinion that they are employed\r\n     to _serve_. It is true that there are many who will take a\r\n     quarter off the wages of a girl to put a new bow on their own\r\n     bonnets. The men are not to be blamed for this; they have enough\r\n     sins to answer for.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. COE said: It would afford women great pleasure to be able to\r\n     pay their own expenses on pleasure excursions and to the\r\n     concert-room, instead of being always compelled to allow the\r\n     gentlemen to foot the bills for them. Women must have equal pay\r\n     for equal work. Among the Quakers the sexes stand on an equality,\r\n     and everything moves on smoothly and happily.\r\n\r\n     SUSAN B. ANTHONY, after relating several instances of the\r\n     injustice of the laws that made the wife subject to the husband,\r\n     said: And all these wrongs are to be redressed by appeals to the\r\n     State Legislatures. In New York and Ohio the women had already\r\n     commenced with every prospect of success. Thousands of petitions\r\n     had been sent into both Legislatures asking for suffrage and\r\n     equal property rights, and their Committees had granted hearings\r\n     to our representatives--Caroline M. Severance, in Ohio; Ernestine\r\n     L. Rose, Rev. William Henry Channing, Elizabeth Cady Stanton,\r\n     Rev. Antoinette L. Brown, and herself, in New York. And closed\r\n     with an earnest appeal to the women of every State to petition,\r\n     PETITION, remembering that \"what is worth having is worth asking\r\n     for,\" and that \"who would be free must themselves strike the\r\n     blow.\"\r\n\r\nFrances D. Gage moved that the next National Convention be held at\r\nCincinnati, Ohio. A gentlemen suggested Washington, to which Mr.\r\nGarrison replied, \"We shall go there by and by.\"[72] After discussion\r\nby Mrs. Mott, Mrs. Rose, and others, the motion was unanimously\r\nadopted. Mrs. Gage then spoke of the Press of the city; its faithful\r\nreports of the proceedings of the Convention, and moved a vote of\r\nthanks. Edward M. Davis begged Mrs. Gage to accept as a substitute the\r\nfollowing resolutions:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the thanks of this Convention are due, and are\r\n     hereby conveyed, to Mrs. Ernestine L. Rose, of New York, for the\r\n     courtesy, impartiality, and dignity with which she has presided\r\n     over its proceedings.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That in the crowded and intelligent audiences which\r\n     have attended the sessions of this Convention; in the earnest\r\n     attention given to its proceedings from the commencement to its\r\n     close; in the fair reports of the Press of the city, and in the\r\n     spirit of harmony and fraternity which has prevailed amongst its\r\n     members, we see evidence of the rapid progress of our cause, and\r\n     find incitement to renewed and more earnest efforts in its\r\n     behalf.\r\n\r\nThus closed another most successful Convention. Notwithstanding an\r\nadmission fee of ten cents during the day and twenty-five at night,\r\nthe audiences grew larger every session, until the last evening the\r\nspacious hall, aisles, stairs, and all available standing-room, was\r\ndensely packed, and hundreds went away unable to get in.\r\n\r\nLet us remember that behind the chief actors in these Conventions,\r\nthere stands in each State, a group of women of stern moral principle,\r\nlarge experience, refinement and cultivation, filling with honor the\r\nmore private walks of life, who, by their sympathy, hospitality, and\r\ngenerous contributions, are the great sources of support and\r\ninspiration to those on the platform, who represent the ideas they\r\nhold sacred, whose tongues and pens proclaim their thoughts. Among\r\nsuch in Pennsylvania, let us ever remember Sarah Pugh, Mary Ann\r\nMcClintock, Elizabeth Phillips, Anna and Adeline Thomson, Abby and\r\nGertrude Kimber, Margaretta Forten, Harriet Forten Purvis, Hannah M.\r\nDarlington, Dinah Mendenhall, Sarah Pierce, Elizabeth and Sarah\r\nMiller, and Ruth Dugdale. When success shall at last crown our\r\nefforts, in according due praise to those who have achieved the\r\nvictory, such names as these must not be forgotten.\r\n\r\nAlice Bradley Neal, of Philadelphia, ridiculed this Woman's Rights\r\nConvention in her husband's[73] paper, and Jane Grey Swisshelm\r\nindignantly replied in her _Pittsburgh Saturday Visitor_ as follows:\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Neal can not be ignorant that the principal object of the\r\n     Convention, and all the agitation about woman's rights, is to\r\n     secure to the toiling millions of her own sex a just reward for\r\n     their labor; to save them from the alternative of prostitution,\r\n     starvation, or incessant life-destroying toil; and yet the whole\r\n     subject furnishes her with material for scorn and merriment! Tell\r\n     it not in Gath! Publish it not in the streets of Askelon, lest\r\n     the sons of the Phillistines rejoice that one of the daughters of\r\n     Eve, beautiful and gentle, throws down her knitting-pins, and\r\n     tries her strength to wield the hammer of old Vulcan to aid them\r\n     in forging fetters for the wrists of her unfortunate sisters. We\r\n     would that it had been some one else than the gentle Alice Neal\r\n     who had volunteered to soil her white hands and sweat her fair\r\n     face, laboring in such a blacksmith-shop.\r\n\r\nWhile ever and anon during the last forty years Mrs. Swisshelm has\r\nseized some of these _dilettante_ literary women with her metaphysical\r\ntweezers, and held them up to scorn for their ridicule of the woman\r\nsuffrage conventions, yet in her own recently published work in her\r\nmature years, she vouchsafes no words of approval for those who have\r\ninaugurated the greatest movement of the centuries. She complains that\r\nin some of the woman suffrage conventions she attended, there was not\r\na strict observance of parliamentary rules, and that the resolutions\r\nand speeches were unworthy the occasion. Yet the only time Mrs.\r\nSwisshelm ever honored our platform at a National Convention, her\r\nspeech was far below the level of most of the others, and the\r\nresolutions she offered were so verbose and irrelevant, that the\r\nCommittee declined to present them to the Convention.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident from her last pronunciamento that she has no just\r\nappreciation of the importance and dignity of our demand for justice\r\nand equality. A soldier without a leg is a fact so much more readily\r\nunderstood, than all women without ballots, and his loss so much more\r\nreadily comprehended and supplied, that we can hardly blame any one\r\nfor doing the work of the hour, rather than struggling a life-time for\r\nan idea. Hence it is not a matter of surprise that most women are more\r\nreadily enlisted in the suppression of evils in the concrete, than in\r\nadvocating the principles that underlie them in the abstract, and thus\r\nultimately doing the broader and more lasting work. On this ground we\r\ncan excuse the author of \"Half a Century\" for giving the reader one\r\nhundred and twenty-five pages of her own work in hospitals and three\r\nto the Woman Suffrage movement, but considering the tone of the three\r\npages, the advocates of the measure should be thankful she gave no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nMrs. Swisshelm's contempt is only surpassed by Mrs. Hale's \"Jeremiad\"\r\nover the infidelity of the noble leader of our movement. For a woman\r\nso thoroughly politic and time-serving, who, unlike the great master\r\nshe professed to follow, never identified herself with one of the\r\nunpopular reforms of her day, whose pen never by any chance slipped\r\noutside the prescribed literary line of safety, to cheer the martyrs\r\nto truth in her own generation; lamentations from such a source over\r\nLucretia Mott, are presumptuous and profane. If such a life of\r\nself-sacrifice and devotion to the best interests of humanity; such\r\ncourage to stand alone, to do and say the right,'mid persecution,\r\nviolence and mobs; such charity and faithfulness in every relation of\r\nlife, as daughter, sister, wife, mother, and friend; such calm\r\ndeclining years and peaceful death could all be realized without a\r\nbelief in the creed of Sarah Josepha Hale; the philosophical\r\nconclusion is that there may be some Divine light and love outside of\r\nMrs. Hale's horizon; that her shibboleth may after all not be the true\r\nmeasure for the highest Christian graces.\r\n\r\nSarah J. Hale, shuddering over the graves of such women as Harriet\r\nMartineau, Frances Wright, Mary Wollstonecroft, George Sand, George\r\nEliot and Lucretia Mott, might furnish a subject for an artist to\r\nrepresent as \"bigotry weeping over the triumphs of truth.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, as Mrs. Hale lived in Pennsylvania forty years, the\r\nwomen of that State may rejoice in the fact that in her great work,\r\n\"Woman's Record,\" she has given \"Sketches of all the distinguished\r\nwomen from the Creation to A.D. 1868\"; a labor for which our sex owe\r\nher a debt of gratitude. To exhume nearly seventeen hundred women from\r\noblivion, classify them, and set forth their distinguished traits of\r\ncharacter, was indeed an herculean labor. This is a valuable book of\r\nreference for the girls of to-day. When our opponents depreciate the\r\nachievements of woman they can turn to the \"Woman's Record\" and find\r\ngrand examples of all the cardinal virtues, of success in art,\r\nscience, literature, and government.\r\n\r\nIn Jane Grey Swisshelm, Pennsylvania can boast a successful editor of\r\na liberal political newspaper during the eventful years of our\r\nanti-slavery struggle. _The Pittsburgh Saturday Visitor_ was\r\nestablished Jan. 20, 1848. It was owned and edited by Mrs. Swisshelm\r\nfor some years; merged into _The Family Journal and Visitor_ in 1852,\r\nin which she was co-editor until 1857, when she removed to Minnesota.\r\nIn spite of a few idiosyncrasies, Mrs. Swisshelm is a noble woman, and\r\nher influence has been for good in her day and generation. However\r\nmuch we may differ from her in some points, we must concede that she\r\nis a strong, pointed writer.\r\n\r\nAmong the editors of Pennsylvania, Anna E. McDowell deserves mention.\r\nIn _The Una_ of January, 1855, we find the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE WOMAN'S ADVOCATE.\r\n\r\n     We have received the first number of a paper bearing the above\r\n     name. It is a fair, handsome sheet, seven columns in width,\r\n     edited by Miss Anna E. McDowell, in Philadelphia. It claims to be\r\n     an independent paper. Its design is not to press woman's right to\r\n     suffrage, but to present her wrongs, and plead for their redress.\r\n     It is owned by a joint stock company of women, and is printed and\r\n     all the work done by women. We most heartily bid it God-speed,\r\n     for the great need of woman now is work, work, that she may eat\r\n     honest bread.\r\n\r\nMiss McDowell continued her paper several years, and has ever since\r\nbeen a faithful correspondent in many journals, and now edits a\r\n\"Woman's Department\" in _The Philadelphia Sunday Republic_. She pleads\r\neloquently for the redress of all the wrongs of humanity. Jails,\r\nprisons, charitable institutions, the oppression of women and\r\nchildren, the laborer, the Indian, have all in turn been subjects of\r\nher impartial pen.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia was the first city in this country to open her retail\r\nstores to girls as clerks, and among the first to welcome them as\r\ntype-setters in the printing offices.\r\n\r\n     In the city press, from 1849 to 1854, we find the following\r\n     announcements, which show the general agitation on woman's\r\n     position:\r\n\r\n          _The Pennsylvania Freeman_: \"A Discourse on Woman,\" to be\r\n          delivered by Lucretia Mott, at the Assembly Buildings,\r\n          December 17, 1849.\r\n\r\n          Lectures by Elizabeth Oakes Smith, April 6, 8, and 10, 1853,\r\n          on \"Manhood,\" \"Womanhood,\" \"Humanity.\"\r\n\r\n          _North American and United States Gazette_: Lucretia Mott\r\n          will deliver a lecture on the \"Medical Education of Woman,\"\r\n          February 2, 1853.\r\n\r\n          Horace Mann will lecture on \"Woman,\" February 3, 1853.\r\n\r\n          _Philadelphia Public Ledger_, January 20, 1854: Lucy Stone\r\n          will deliver a lecture on \"Woman's Rights,\" at Musical Fund\r\n          Hall, Saturday evening, January 21.\r\n\r\n          April 12, 1854: Mrs. Ernestine L. Rose will lecture on\r\n          Thursday evening, April 13, at Spring Garden Institute, on\r\n          \"The Education and Influence of Woman\"; and on Friday\r\n          evening, April 14th, at Sansom Street Hall, on \"The Legal\r\n          Disabilities of Woman.\" Tickets, 25 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN'S MEDICAL COLLEGE OF PENNSYLVANIA.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1850, in a rented building, No. 229 Arch Street,\r\nPhiladelphia, the College began its first session with six pupils;\r\nothers were added before the class graduated, so that it then numbered\r\neight:--Hannah E. Longshore, Ann Preston, Phebe W. May, Susanna H.\r\nEllis, Anna M. Longshore, Pennsylvania; Martha M. Laurin,\r\nMassachusetts; Angonette A. Hunt, New York; Frances G. Mitchell,\r\nEngland. Since its foundation, the \"Woman's Medical College of\r\nPennsylvania\" has prospered, and on its lists of graduates we see,\r\namong other familiar names, those of Dr. Laura Ross Wolcott (1856),\r\nDr. Mary J. Scarlett Dixon (1857), and Dr. Emeline H. Cleveland\r\n(1855).\r\n\r\nChief among those interested in placing the medical education of woman\r\non a sound foundation was Ann Preston. The \"Woman's Medical College\r\nof Pennsylvania\" was the first ever chartered for this purpose, and\r\nDr. Preston early became identified with its interests. She was one of\r\nits first students, and a graduate at its first commencement. After\r\nthe didactic teaching of the regular college course was well\r\nestablished, each year showed to her more clearly the necessity for\r\nclinical and hospital instruction, since its students were denied such\r\nadvantages in other places; and to Dr. Preston's thorough appreciation\r\nof this need may be traced the very origin of the Woman's Hospital in\r\nPhiladelphia. Speaking of her efforts in this direction, she says: \"I\r\nwent to every one who I thought would give me either money or\r\ninfluence.\" She was liberally assisted by many noble and true-hearted\r\nmen and women, and at last raised sufficient funds, obtained the\r\ncharter, found competent men and women willing to serve as Managers,\r\nand skillful physicians who would act on a Consulting Board; and, when\r\nthe Hospital was opened, was herself appointed one of the Managers,\r\nCorresponding Secretary, and Consulting Physician--offices which she\r\nheld till her death, April 18, 1872.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, she was serving with equal fidelity and ability the\r\nCollege whose advancement had so long been one of the chief interests\r\nof her life. For nineteen years she had been one of its Professors,\r\nfor six years Dean of the Faculty, and for four years a member of its\r\nBoard of Corporators. She lived long enough to see the fruits of her\r\nlabors, and to foresee to some extent the position which both College\r\nand Hospital would hold in the medical world. And when, after her\r\ndeath, her will was published, the friends of the College and Hospital\r\nfound that both institutions had been remembered by endowments.\r\n\r\nAlmost contemporary in length of days with the Medical College is\r\nanother useful institution, The Philadelphia School of Design for\r\nWomen, which began its corporate existence the first Monday of\r\nNovember, 1853. There had previously been a class for women in\r\nconnection with the Franklin Institute, and this school was its\r\nfurther development. It was mainly supported by contributions, the\r\nscholars' fees paying merely for the coal, gas, and other necessaries\r\nof the house. The management of the institution was vested in a Board\r\nof twelve Directors, elected annually, and a Board of twelve Lady\r\nManagers, elected by the Board of Directors at the first stated\r\nmeeting after the election; these ladies disburse the money received\r\nat the school, and also that appropriated monthly by the Directors. It\r\nis noticeable in the first report of the School of Design for Women,\r\nthat men held the leading positions and received the highest salaries,\r\nbut that has since been changed.\r\n\r\nThat there was no organized action in this State, no woman suffrage\r\nassociation formed, until after the war, was undoubtedly due to the\r\nfact that the same women were prominent in both the anti-slavery and\r\nwoman's rights movements. And as Pennsylvania bordered on three slave\r\nStates, the escape of fugitives and their innumerable trials in the\r\ncourts, just as the whole system was on the eve of dissolution,\r\ncompelled the Philadelphia friends to incessant vigilance in the care\r\nand concealment of the unhappy victims. Thus their hands and thoughts\r\nwere wholly occupied until the first gun at Sumter proclaimed freedom\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\nFor collecting many of the facts contained in this chapter we are\r\nindebted to Julia and Rachel Foster, daughters of Heron Foster, who\r\nfounded _The Pittsburgh Dispatch_. What an inspiring vision it would\r\nhave been to the earnest women sitting in that Convention in 1854,\r\ncould they in imagination have stretched forward to the bright winter\r\ndays of 1881, and seen these two young girls tastefully attired,\r\nenthusiastic in the cause of woman's suffrage, tripping through the\r\nstreets of Philadelphia, paper and pencil in hand, intent on some\r\nimportant errand, now here, now there, climbing up long flights of\r\nstairs into the offices of the various journals, to find out from the\r\nrecords what Lucretia Mott, Frances Dana Gage, and Ernestine L. Rose\r\nhad said over a quarter of a century before, about the rights and\r\nwrongs of women. Turning over the dusty journals hour after hour as\r\nthey copied page by page, it would have been a pleasing study to watch\r\ntheir earnest faces, now sad, now pleased, reflecting with every\r\nchanging sentiment they read the feelings of their souls, just as\r\ntheir diamonds paled and glowed in the changing light.\r\n\r\nCould the satisfaction of these girls in reading Garrison's stern\r\nlogic, Mrs. Mott's repartee and earnest appeal, and all the arguments\r\nby which their opponents had been fairly vanquished; could the\r\nnew-born dignity they realized in the conscious possession of rights\r\nand liberties once unknown, confident that full equality could not be\r\nlong deferred; could all this have been pre-visioned by the actors in\r\nthose scenes, they would have felt themselves fully compensated for\r\nthe persecution and ridicule they had endured. And thus the great work\r\nof life goes on; the toils of one generation are the joys of the next.\r\nWe have reaped what other hands have planted; let us then in turn sow\r\nbountifully for those who shall follow us, that our children may enter\r\ninto a broader inheritance than any legal parchment can bequeath.\r\n\r\n\r\nANGELINA GRIMKÉ.\r\n\r\n_Reminiscences by E. C. S._\r\n\r\nMy first introduction to Mrs. Weld was two years after her marriage,\r\nwhen she and her husband had retired from the stormy scenes of the\r\nanti-slavery conflict, and in their own home found a harbor of rest,\r\nfor quiet though useful occupation. In company with my husband and\r\nCharles Stuart, a Scotch Abolitionist, we took one of those long\r\nclosely-covered stages peculiar to New Jersey, for a twelve miles\r\ndrive to Belleville, where at the door of an old Dutch-built stone\r\nhouse, Theodore Weld and the famous daughters of South Carolina gave\r\nus a welcome. There was nothing attractive at first sight in those\r\nplain, frail women, except their rich voices, fluent language, and\r\nAngelina's fine dark eyes. The house with its wide hall, spacious\r\napartments, deep windows, and small panes of glass was severely\r\ndestitute of all tasteful, womanly touches, and though neat and\r\norderly, had a cheerless atmosphere. Neither was there one touch of\r\nthe artistic in the arrangement of the ladies' hair and dresses. They\r\nwere just then in the Graham dispensation, and the peculiar table\r\narrangements, with no tray to mark the charmed circle whence the usual\r\nbeverages were dispensed, the cold dishes without a whiff of heat, or\r\nsteam, gave one a feeling of strangeness; all those delightful\r\nassociations gathering round a covered dish and hot beefsteak, the\r\ntea-pot and china cups and saucers, were missing. A cool evening in\r\nthe month of May, after a long drive had left us in a condition\r\npeculiarly susceptible to the attractions of something hot and\r\nstimulating; but they came not. There was no catering in this\r\nhousehold to the weaknesses of those who were not yet weaned from the\r\nflesh-pots of Egypt. The sharp edge of our appetite somewhat dulled\r\nwith the simple fare, we were thrown on our own resources, and\r\nmemories of tea and coffee for stimulus.\r\n\r\nAfter our repast, the high discourse was slightly interrupted by the\r\nappearance of the infant, Charles Stuart Weld, and his formal\r\npresentation to the distinguished gentleman after whom he was named.\r\nAnd when Mr. Weld told us how near the boy, in the initiative steps of\r\nhis existence, came to being sacrificed to a theory, the old stone\r\nwalls rang with bursts of laughter.[74] But the chilling environments\r\nof these noble people were modified by the sincere hospitality with\r\nwhich we were received. My husband and Mr. Weld had been classmates in\r\nLane Seminary, and were among the students who left that institution\r\nwhen the discussion of the slavery question was forbidden by the\r\nPresident, Dr. Lyman Beecher. They talked with zest of those early\r\ndays until a late hour. As Charles Stuart and the two sisters were\r\nalso good conversationalists, I listened with pleasure and profit, and\r\nduring the three days under that roof obtained much general knowledge\r\nof anti-slavery and church history; volumes of information were\r\ncondensed in those familiar talks, of lasting benefit to me, who then\r\nknew so little of reforms.\r\n\r\nHow changed was the atmosphere of that home to me next day. True,\r\nthere were still no pictures on the walls, but the beautiful boy in\r\nhis bath, the sunlight on his golden hair, with some new grace or\r\ntrick each day, surpassed what any brush could trace. No statues\r\ngraced the corners; but the well-built Northern hero of many slavery\r\nbattles, bound with the silken cords of love and friendship to those\r\nbrave women from the South, together sacrificing wealth and fame and\r\nease for a great principle, formed a group worthy the genius of a\r\nRogers to portray.\r\n\r\nIt has been my good fortune to meet these noble friends occasionally\r\nin the course of our busy lives, sometimes under their roof, sometimes\r\nunder mine, and as, day by day, the nobility, the transparency, the\r\nunselfishness of their characters have grown upon me, the memories of\r\nthe old stone house and its care-worn inmates, have stood transfigured\r\nbefore me, with almost a celestial radiance. In grouping the main\r\nfacts of this eventful life, and analyzing the impelling motives that\r\nmade Angelina Grimké the heroic woman she was, I can not serve her\r\nmemory better than in giving the beautiful tributes of loving friends\r\nat the close of her life.\r\n\r\nAngelina, the youngest daughter of Judge Grimké, of the Supreme Court\r\nof South Carolina, was born in Charleston, S. C., February 20, 1805.\r\nFrom her earliest years, her sympathies were with the cruelly treated\r\nrace around her; and when a child, she had her little bottle of oil,\r\nand other simple medicaments, with which in the darkness she would\r\nsteal out of the house to some wretched creature who had been\r\nterribly whipped, and do what she could to assuage his sufferings. At\r\nthe age of fourteen, she was asked by the rector of the Episcopal\r\nchurch to which her family belonged, to be confirmed--a form, she was\r\ntold, which all her companions went through as a matter of course. But\r\nshe insisted on knowing the meaning of this form, and, on reading it\r\nin the Prayer-Book, she said she could not promise what was there\r\nrequired. \"But it is only a form,\" she was told. \"If with my feelings\r\nand views as they now are, I should go through that form, it would be\r\na lie. I can not do it.\" This single-hearted truthfulness, without\r\nregard to personal consequences to herself, was the key to all her\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nSome years afterward, under the influence of an eloquent Presbyterian\r\npreacher, her religious sensibilities were awakened. Her eyes were\r\nopened to a new world. Through deeper and more vital spiritual\r\nexperiences, she entered into a new life, which took entire possession\r\nof all her faculties. She joined the Presbyterian church, and carried\r\ninto it the fervor and strength of a regenerated nature. She became a\r\nteacher in its Sunday-school, and after a lapse of fifty years, there\r\ncame a letter from one of her first Sunday-school scholars, living in\r\nGeorgia, to express thanks for the benefits which her instructions had\r\nbeen to her. Angelina soon endeavored to impress upon the officers of\r\nthe church a sense of what they should do for the slaves, but her\r\npleadings for them found no response. \"Could it then,\" said she, \"be a\r\nChurch of Christ?\"\r\n\r\nThere was in Charleston at that time a Friends' Meeting-house, where\r\nthere were only two worshipers, and they agreed with her in regard to\r\nslavery. For a year she worshiped there in silence. No word was\r\nspoken. The two aged men, and this young, accomplished, attractive\r\nwoman, sat there under a canopy of divine silence, sanctified and\r\nblessed to her. At length she felt that her mission there was ended.\r\nHer elder sister, Sarah, had united with the Friends in Philadelphia;\r\nand she joined her in 1830, giving up in agony of heart all the dear\r\nties that bound her to her home. But even in the Friends'\r\nMeeting-house, her eye was quick to see negro seats where women of the\r\ndespised race were still publicly humiliated. She and her sister\r\nseated themselves with them. The Friends were grieved by their\r\nconduct, and called them to account. The sisters replied: \"While you\r\nput this badge of degradation on our sisters, we feel that it is our\r\nduty to share it with them.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1883, they attached themselves to the American Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety, and lent their powerful aid to the work which it was doing.\r\nThere was no more effective or eloquent speaker in the cause than\r\nAngelina Grimké. She had not thought at first of speaking in public;\r\nbut wherever she was, among friends and neighbors, she sought relief\r\nto her burdened spirit by testifying to the cruel and fatal influences\r\nof slavery. A few women at first came together to meet her and her\r\nsister Sarah. The numbers and the interest increased till she became\r\nwidely known. She and her sister talked to them about slavery in their\r\nown parlors. Soon no parlors could hold the throngs that gathered to\r\nhear her. The small vestry of a church was given to her, then a large\r\nvestry. But this was too small, and the body of the church was opened\r\nto the crowd which had been attracted by her. There, on a platform\r\nbeneath the pulpit, for the first time she stood and spoke at what\r\nmight be called a public meeting, though she spoke only to women. In\r\nthe spring of 1837, the sisters went through a similar experience in\r\nBoston, speaking to women only. She went to Lynn to address the women,\r\nand there men crowded in with their wives and daughters. That was the\r\nbeginning of women's speaking to promiscuous assemblies in\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\n\"Hers was the eloquence of a broken heart. As she gave way to the deep\r\nyearnings of affection for the mother that bore her, still a\r\nslaveholder, for her brothers and sisters, a large family circle, and\r\nfor all who had been most closely bound to her by ties of kindred and\r\nneighborhood, she must have felt the desolation of a soul disappointed\r\nand broken in its dearest earthly hopes and love. All the sweet and\r\ntender affections which intertwine themselves so inseparably with the\r\nthought of home had been turned into instruments of torture. As she\r\nthought of her native city, and spoke out her feelings toward it, her\r\nlanguage might well remind one of the lamentations of the ancient\r\nprophets, 'O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and\r\nstonest them that are sent unto thee!' But this broken heart had a\r\nhigher life and a mightier voice than can be given or taken away by\r\nany earthly affection. While therefore she often spoke with a pathos\r\nwhich melted and subdued those who listened to her, she also rose into\r\na loftier strain, and spoke with the mingled love and sternness of a\r\nmessenger from God.\"\r\n\r\nPassages like the following may give some idea of the solemnity and\r\npower with which she, who had left all and taken up her cross in\r\ndefence of a poor and friendless race, could appeal to assembled\r\nmultitudes:\r\n\r\n     The sufferings of the slaves are not only innumerable, but they\r\n     are indescribable. I may paint the agony of kindred torn from\r\n     each other's arms, to meet no more in time; I may depict the\r\n     inflictions of the blood-stained lash; but I can not describe\r\n     the daily, hourly, ceaseless torture, endured by the heart that\r\n     is constantly trampled under the foot of arbitrary power. This is\r\n     a part of the horrors of slavery which, I believe, no one has\r\n     ever attempted to delineate. I wonder not at it; it mocks all\r\n     power of language. Who can describe the anguish of that mind\r\n     which feels itself impaled upon the iron of arbitrary power--its\r\n     living, writhing, helpless victim! every human susceptibility\r\n     tortured, its sympathies torn, and stung, and bleeding--always\r\n     feeling the death weapon in its heart, and yet not so deep as to\r\n     kill that humanity which is made the curse of its existence?\r\n\r\n     No one who has not been an integral part of a slaveholding\r\n     community can have any idea of its abominations. It is a whited\r\n     sepulchre, full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness. Blessed\r\n     be God, the angel of truth has descended, and rolled away the\r\n     stone from the mouth of the sepulchre, and sits upon it. The\r\n     abominations so long hidden are now brought forth before all\r\n     Israel and the sun. Yes, the angel of truth sits upon this stone,\r\n     and it can never be rolled back again.\r\n\r\n     There is a spirit abroad in this country which will not consent\r\n     to barter principle for an unholy peace--a spirit which will not\r\n     hide God's eternal principles of right and wrong, but will stand\r\n     erect in the storm of human passion, prejudice, and interest,\r\n     holding forth the light of truth in the midst of a crooked and\r\n     perverse generation; a spirit which will never slumber nor sleep\r\n     till man ceases to hold dominion over his fellow-creatures, and\r\n     the trump of universal liberty rings in every forest, and is\r\n     re-echoed by every mountain and rock.\r\n\r\n\"She who spoke in tones like these never lost one of her purely\r\nfeminine qualities. Graceful, gentle, retiring, taking upon herself\r\nthe lowliest duties as if she had been born to them, this woman, who\r\nstood up that her light might shine on all, and reveal to them the\r\nterrible atrocities of slavery, was like Jeremy Taylor's taper, which\r\ncast ever a modest shadow round itself. She had a very lofty idea of\r\nwhat a woman should be. 'Whatever it is morally right for a man to do,\r\nit is morally right for a woman to do. I recognize no rights but human\r\nrights. I know nothing of men's rights and women's rights; for in\r\nChrist Jesus there is neither male nor female.' 'Sure I am that woman\r\nis not to be, as she has been, a mere \"second-hand agent\" in the\r\nregeneration of a fallen world, but the acknowledged equal and\r\nco-worker with man in this glorious work.... Just in proportion as her\r\nmoral and intellectual capacities become enlarged, she will rise\r\nhigher and higher in the scroll of creation, until she reaches that\r\nelevation prepared for her by her Maker, and upon whose summit she was\r\noriginally stationed, only 'a little lower than the angels.'\"\r\n\r\nIn the darkest hours of that fearful conflict with slavery in which\r\nshe was engaged, when its advocates were everywhere met with\r\nviolence, and threatened with death, she wrote to William Lloyd\r\nGarrison as follows:\r\n\r\n     I can hardly express to thee the deep and solemn interest with\r\n     which I have viewed the violent proceedings of the last few\r\n     weeks. Although I expected opposition, yet I was not prepared for\r\n     it so soon; it took me by surprise, and I greatly feared the\r\n     Abolitionists would be driven back in the first onset and thrown\r\n     into confusion. I was afraid of even opening one of thy papers\r\n     lest I should see some indications of a compromise, some\r\n     surrender, some palliation. But I read thy appeal to the citizens\r\n     of Boston, and found my fears were utterly groundless, and that\r\n     thou stoodest firm in the midst of the storm, determined to\r\n     suffer and to die rather than yield one inch!\r\n\r\n     Religious persecution always begins with mobs; it is always\r\n     unprecedented in any age or country in which it commences, and\r\n     therefore there are no laws by which reformers can be punished;\r\n     consequently, a lawless band of unprincipled men determine to\r\n     take the matter into their hands, and act out in mobs what they\r\n     know are the principles of a large majority of those who are too\r\n     high in Church and State to condescend to mingle with them,\r\n     though they secretly approve and rejoice over their violent\r\n     measures. The first martyr who ever died was stoned by a lawless\r\n     mob; and, if we look at the rise of various sects--Methodists,\r\n     Friends, etc.--we shall find that mobs began the persecution\r\n     against them; and it was not until after the people had thus\r\n     spoken out their wishes that laws were framed to fine, imprison,\r\n     or destroy them. Let us, then, be prepared for the enactment of\r\n     laws, even in our free States, against Abolitionists. And how\r\n     ardently has the prayer been breathed that God would fit us for\r\n     all He is preparing for us!\r\n\r\n     My mind has been especially turned toward those who are standing\r\n     in the fore-front of the battle; and the prayer has gone up for\r\n     their preservation, not the preservation of their lives, but the\r\n     preservation of their minds in humility and patience, faith,\r\n     hope, and charity, that charity which is the bond of perfectness.\r\n     If persecution is the means which God has ordained for the\r\n     accomplishment of this great end--emancipation--then, in\r\n     dependence upon Him for strength to bear it, I feel as if I could\r\n     say, let it come; for it is my deep, solemn conviction that this\r\n     is a cause worth dying for. At one time, I thought this system\r\n     would be overthrown in blood, with the confused noise of the\r\n     warrior; but a hope gleams across my mind that our blood will be\r\n     spilt instead of the slaveholders'; that our lives will be taken,\r\n     and theirs spared. I say a hope; for of all things I desire to be\r\n     spared the anguish of seeing our beloved country desolated with\r\n     the horrors of a servile war.\r\n\r\n\"These words were written by one who was standing not apart in a place\r\nof safety, but in the foremost post of danger, and who knew that she\r\nwas as likely as any one to share in the martyrdom which she foresaw.\r\nThe spirit which dictated these sentences went through her whole life\r\nas its ruling influence.\r\n\r\n\"There is the courage of the mariner who buffets the angry waves.\r\nThere is the courage of the warrior who marches up to the cannon's\r\nmouth, coolly pressing forward amidst engines of destruction on every\r\nside. But hers was a courage greater than theirs. She not only faced\r\ndeath at the hands of stealthy assassins and howling mobs in her\r\nloyalty to truth, duty, and humanity, but she encountered\r\nunflinchingly the awful frowns of the mighty consecrated leaders of\r\nsociety, the scoffs and sneers of the multitude, the outstretched\r\nfinger of scorn, and the whispered mockery of pity, standing up for\r\nthe lowest of the low. Nurtured in the very bosom of slavery, by her\r\nown observation and thought, of one thing she became certain, that it\r\nwas a false, cruel, accursed relation between human beings. And to\r\nthis conviction, from the very budding of her womanhood, she was\r\ntrue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well do I remember,\" said one, \"when, after the American Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety, founded in 1838, had battled for a year or two with the\r\ncombined forces of the mob, the press, and the commercial, political,\r\nand ecclesiastical authorities, and it was said in the highest\r\nquarters that we had only exasperated the slaveholders, and made all\r\nthe North sympathize with them, when the storm of public indignation,\r\ngathering over the whole heavens, was black upon us, and we were\r\ncomparatively only a handful, there appeared in the _Anti-Slavery_\r\noffice in New York this mild, modest, soft-speaking woman, then in the\r\nprime of her beauty, delicate as the lily-of-the-valley. She placed in\r\nmy hands a roll of manuscript, beautifully written. It was her 'Appeal\r\nto the Christian Women of the South.' It was like a patch of blue sky\r\nbreaking through that storm cloud.\" The manuscript was passed round\r\namong the members of our Executive Committee, and read with wet eyes.\r\nThe Society printed it in a pamphlet of thirty-six pages, and\r\ncirculated it widely. It made its author a forced exile from her\r\nnative State, but it touched hearts that had been proof against\r\neverything else. I remember that the Quarterly Anti-Slavery Magazine\r\nfor October, 1836, said of it something to this effect:\r\n\r\n     This eloquent pamphlet is from the pen of a sister of the late\r\n     Thomas S. Grimké, of Charleston, S. C. We need hardly say more of\r\n     it than that it is written with that peculiar felicity and\r\n     unction which characterized the works of her lamented brother.\r\n     Among anti-slavery writings there are two classes, one specially\r\n     adapted to make new converts, the other to strengthen the old. We\r\n     can not exclude Miss Grimké's Appeal from either class. It\r\n     belongs pre-eminently to the former. The converts that will be\r\n     made by it, we have no doubt, will be not only numerous, but\r\n     thorough-going.\r\n\r\n\"Many of us remember,\" said another, \"with what awakening power such\r\nGod-inspired souls have roused us from the apathy of our lives. Some\r\ngreat wrong, like slavery, over which the world had slept for ages,\r\nbecomes thus revealed to the clearer vision. Slavery, war,\r\nintemperance, licentiousness, injustice to woman, have thus one after\r\nanother been brought to the light, as violations of God's eternal\r\nlaws. The soul of Angelina Grimké, and that of her sister Sarah, were\r\nin vital sympathy with all attempts to reform these great wrongs; but\r\nthe one which then had pre-eminence above all was human slavery. All\r\nof us who are advanced in years can recall with what almost\r\noverwhelming effect the appeals of our beloved and lamented Garrison\r\nfirst came to our minds. The conscience of the community was\r\nslumbering over this sin: his utterances stung it to frenzy. In the\r\nmidst of it, and in the heartiest response to his appeals, came the\r\ngentle, calm voices of Sarah and Angelina Grimké, enforcing those\r\nappeals by facts of their own observation and experience. I have said\r\nthat their nature was full of tenderness and compassion; but, in\r\naddition to this, Angelina, especially, possessed a rare gift of\r\neloquence, a calm power of persuasion, a magnetic influence over those\r\nthat listened to her, which carried conviction to hearts that nothing\r\nbefore had reached.\" \"I shall never forget the wonderful manifestation\r\nof this power during six successive evenings in what was then called\r\nthe Odeon, at the corner of Franklin and Federal Streets. It was the\r\nold Boston Theater, which had been converted into a music hall, the\r\nfour galleries rising above the auditorium all crowded with a silent\r\naudience, carried away with the calm, simple eloquence which narrated\r\nwhat she and her sister had seen from their earliest days. And yet\r\nthis Odeon scene, the audience so quiet and intensely absorbed,\r\noccurred at the most enflamed period of the anti-slavery contest. The\r\neffective agent in this phenomenon was Angelina's serene, commanding\r\neloquence, a wonderful gift, which enchained attention, disarmed\r\nprejudice, and carried her hearers with her.\"\r\n\r\nWENDELL PHILLIPS said:\r\n\r\nFriends, this life carries us back to the first chapter of that great\r\nmovement with which the name of Angelina Grimké is associated--when\r\nour cities roared with riot, when William Lloyd Garrison was dragged\r\nthrough the streets, when Dresser was mobbed in Nashville, and\r\nMackintosh burned in St. Louis. At that time, the hatred toward\r\nAbolitionists was so bitter and merciless that the friends of Lovejoy\r\nleft his grave a long time unmarked; and at last ventured to put, with\r\nhis name, on his tombstone, only this piteous entreaty: _Jam parce\r\nsepulto_, \"Spare him now in his grave.\" We were but a handful then,\r\nand our words beat against the stony public as powerless as if against\r\nthe north wind. We got no sympathy from most Northern men: their\r\nconsciences were seared as with a hot iron. At this time, a young girl\r\ncame from the proudest State in the slave-holding section. She come to\r\nlay on the altar of this despised cause, this seemingly hopeless\r\ncrusade, both family and friends, the best social position, a high\r\nplace in the church, genius, and many gifts. No man at this day can\r\nknow the gratitude we felt for this help from such an unexpected\r\nsource. After this came James G. Birney from the South, and many able\r\nand influential men and women joined us. At last John Brown laid his\r\nlife, the crowning sacrifice, on the altar of the cause. But no man\r\nwho remembers 1837 and its lowering clouds will deny that there was\r\nhardly any contribution to the anti-slavery movement greater or more\r\nimpressive than the crusade of these Grimké sisters from South\r\nCarolina through the New England States.\r\n\r\nGifted with rare eloquence, she swept the chords of the human heart\r\nwith a power that has never been surpassed, and rarely equaled. I well\r\nremember, evening after evening, listening to eloquence such as never\r\nthen had been heard from a woman. Her own hard experience, the long,\r\nlonely, intellectual and moral struggle from which she came out\r\nconqueror, had ripened her power, and her wondrous faculty of laying\r\nbare her own heart to reach the hearts of others, shone forth till she\r\ncarried us all captive. She was the first woman to whom the halls of\r\nthe Massachusetts Legislature were opened. My friend, James C. Alvord,\r\nwas the courageous chairman who broke that door open for the\r\nanti-slavery women. It gave Miss Grimké the opportunity to speak to\r\nthe best culture and character of Massachusetts; and the profound\r\nimpression then made on a class not often in our meetings was never\r\nwholly lost. It was not only the testimony of one most competent to\r\nspeak, but it was the profound religious experience of one who had\r\nbroken out of the charmed circle, and whose intense earnestness melted\r\nall opposition. The converts she made needed no after-training. It was\r\nwhen you saw she was opening some secret record of her own experience,\r\nthat the painful silence and breathless interest told the deep effect\r\nand lasting impression her words were making on minds, that afterward\r\nnever rested in their work.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, '41, this anti-slavery movement was broken in halves by the\r\nwoman question. The people believed in the silence of women. But, when\r\nthe Grimkés went through New England, such was the overpowering\r\ninfluence with which they swept the churches that men did not\r\nremember this dogma till after they had gone. When they left, and the\r\nspell weakened, some woke to the idea that it was wrong for a woman to\r\nspeak to a public assembly. The wakening of old prejudice to its\r\ncombat with new convictions was a fearful storm. But she bore it, when\r\nit broke at last, with the intrepidity with which she surmounted every\r\nobstacle. By the instinctive keenness of her conscience, she only\r\nneeded to see truth to recognize it, as the flower turns to the sun.\r\nGod had touched that soul so that it needed no special circumstance,\r\nno word of warning or instruction from those about her; for she was\r\never self-poised.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of her, there comes to me the picture of the spotless\r\ndove in the tempest, as she battles with the storm, seeking for some\r\nplace to rest her foot. She reminds me of innocence personified in\r\nSpencer's poem. In her girlhood, alone, heart-led, she comforts the\r\nslave in his quarters; mentally struggling with the problems his\r\nposition wakes her to. Alone, not confused, but seeking something to\r\nlean on, she grasps the Church, which proves a broken reed. No whit\r\ndisheartened, she turns from one sect to another, trying each by the\r\ninfallible touchstone of that clear, childlike conscience. The two old\r\nlonely Quakers in their innocence rest her foot awhile. But the eager\r\nsoul must work, not rest in testimony. Coming North, at last, she\r\nmakes her own religion,--one of sacrifice and toil. Breaking away\r\nfrom, rising above all forms, the dove floats at last in the blue sky\r\nwhere no clouds reach.\r\n\r\nAnd thus exiled from her native city, she goes forth with her sister\r\nto seek the spot where she can most effectually strike at the\r\ninstitution. Were I to single out the moral and intellectual trait\r\nwhich most won me, it was her serene indifference to the judgment of\r\nthose about her. Self-poised, she seemed morally sufficient to\r\nherself. Her instincts were all so clear and right she could trust\r\ntheir lesson. But a clear, wide, patient submission to all suggestion\r\nand influence preceded opinion, and her public addresses were\r\nremarkable for the fullness and clearness of the arguments they urged.\r\nShe herself felt truths, but patiently argued them to others.\r\n\r\nThe testimony she gave touching slavery was, as she termed it, \"the\r\nwail of a broken-hearted child.\" It was known to a few that the\r\npictures she drew were of her own fireside. That loving heart! how\r\nstern a sense of duty must have wrung it before she was willing to\r\nopen that record! But with sublime fidelity, with entire\r\nself-sacrifice, she gave all she could to the great argument that was\r\nto wake a nation to duty. Listen to the fearful indictment she records\r\nagainst the system. And this was not slavery in its most brutal,\r\nrepulsive form. It was slavery hid in luxury, when refinement seemed\r\nto temper some of its worst elements. But, with keen sense of right,\r\neven a child of a dozen years saw through the veil, saw the system in\r\nits inherent vileness, saw the real curse of slavery in the hardened\r\nheart of the slave-holder.\r\n\r\nA few years of active life, extensive and most influential labor, many\r\nsheaves and a rich harvest, God's blessing on her service, then\r\nillness barring her from the platform. How serenely she took up the\r\ncross! So specially endowed; men bowing low so readily to the power\r\nand magic of her words; she could not but have seen the grand\r\npossibilities that were opening before her. How peacefully she\r\naccepted the bond, and set herself to training others for the work\r\nagainst which her own door was shut! East, West, North, and South,\r\ncome up to give testimony that these later years bore ample fruit. How\r\nmany souls have cause to thank that enforced silence! I have listened\r\nto such testimonies, spoken sometimes in tears, on the shores of the\r\nGreat Lakes and beyond the Mississippi.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the following facts and anecdotes told by her husband, we see\r\nthat Angelina united with the highest moral heroism, the physical\r\ncourage and coolness in the hour of danger that but few men can boast.\r\nTheodore D. Weld, in his published sketch, says:\r\n\r\n     Though high physical courage is also fairly inferrable from her\r\n     anti-slavery career, yet only those most with her in life's\r\n     practical affairs can appreciate her self-poise in danger. Peril\r\n     was to her a sedative; it calmed and girded her, bringing out\r\n     every resource, and making self-command absolute. She knew\r\n     nothing of that flutter which confuses. Great danger instantly\r\n     brought thought and feeling to a focus, and held them there.\r\n     Several perilous emergencies in her life are vividly\r\n     recalled--such as being overturned while in a carriage with a\r\n     child in her arms, the horse meanwhile floundering amid the\r\n     _débris_, a shaft broken, and dash-board kicked into splinters.\r\n     At another time, shots at the road-side set off the horses in a\r\n     run. Seeing her husband, in his struggle to rein them in, jerked\r\n     up from his seat and held thus braced and half-standing, she\r\n     caught him round the waist, adding her weight to his, and thus\r\n     enabled him to pull the harder, till the steady, silent tug upon\r\n     the reins tamed down the steeds. Her residence at Belleville, N.\r\n     J., had no near neighbors, stood back from the road, and was\r\n     nearly hidden by trees and shrubbery. The old stone structure,\r\n     dating back to 1700, was known as the \"haunted house.\" Being very\r\n     large, with barn, sheds, and several out-houses, it was specially\r\n     attractive to stragglers and burglars. Stories had been long\r\n     afloat of outrages perpetrated there, among which was a murder a\r\n     century before, with a burglary and robbery more recent. We had\r\n     not been long there, when one night Angelina, waked by suspicious\r\n     noises, listened, till certain that a burglar must be in the\r\n     house. Then, stealing softly from the room, she struck a light,\r\n     and explored from cellar to attic, looking into closets, behind\r\n     doors, and under beds. For a slight, weak woman, hardly able to\r\n     lift an empty tea-kettle, thus to dare, shows, whether we call it\r\n     courage or presumption, at least the absence of all fear. None\r\n     of the family knew of this fact, until an accident long after\r\n     revealed it.\r\n\r\n     Some years after this, when visiting in a friend's family in the\r\n     absence of the parents, she often took the children to ride. Upon\r\n     returning one day, she said to the cook, \"Maggie, jump in, and\r\n     I'll give you a ride.\" So away they went. Soon a by-road struck\r\n     off from the main one. Turning in to explore it, she found that\r\n     it ran a long way parallel to the railroad. Suddenly Maggie\r\n     screamed: \"O missus! I forgot. This is just the time for the\r\n     express, and this is the horse that's awful afraid of the cars,\r\n     and nobody can hold him. Oh, dear, dear!\" Seeing Maggie's fright,\r\n     she instantly turned back, saying, \"Now, Maggie, if the train\r\n     should come before we get back to the turn, do just what I tell\r\n     you, and I'll bring you out safe.\" \"Oh, yes, missus! I will! I\r\n     will!\" \"Mark, now. Don't scream; don't touch the reins; don't\r\n     jump out; 'twill kill you dead if you do. Listen, and, as soon as\r\n     you hear the cars coming, drop down on the bottom of the wagon.\r\n     Don't look out; keep your eyes and mouth shut tight. I'll take\r\n     care of you.\" Down flat dropped Maggie on the bottom, without\r\n     waiting to hear the train. Soon the steam-whistle screamed in\r\n     front, instead of rear, as expected! Short about she turned the\r\n     horse, and away he sprang, the express thundering in the rear.\r\n     For a mile the road was a straight, dead level, and right along\r\n     the track. At utmost speed the frantic animal strained on. On\r\n     plunged the train behind. Neither gained nor lost. No sound came\r\n     but the rushing of steed and train. It was a race for life, and\r\n     the blood horse won. Then, as the road turned from the track up a\r\n     long slope, the train shot by, taming the horse's fright; but, as\r\n     his blood was up, she kept him hard pushed to the crest of the\r\n     slope, then slacked his pace, and headed him homeward. Faithful\r\n     Maggie stuck fast to her promise and to the wagon-bottom, until\r\n     told, \"It's all over,\" when she broke silence with her\r\n     wonderments. When she got home the kitchen rang with\r\n     exclamations. That race was long her standing topic, she always\r\n     insisting that she wasn't scared a bit, not she, because she\r\n     \"knew the missus wasn't.\"\r\n\r\n     While living in New Jersey, word came that a colored man and his\r\n     wife, who had just come to the township, were lying sick of\r\n     malignant small-pox, and that none of their neighbors dared go to\r\n     them. She immediately sought them out, and found them in a\r\n     deplorable plight, neither able to do anything for the other, and\r\n     at once became to them eyes, hands, feet, nurse, care-taker and\r\n     servant in all needed offices; and thus, relieved in nursing and\r\n     watching by a friend, her patients were able, after three days,\r\n     to minister in part to each other. Meanwhile, no neighbor\r\n     approached them.\r\n\r\n     Some striking traits were scarcely known, except by her special\r\n     intimates; and they were never many. Her fidelity in friendship\r\n     was imperishable. Friends might break with her; she never broke\r\n     with them, whatever the wrong they had done her. She never stood\r\n     upon dignity, nor exacted apology, nor resented an unkindness,\r\n     though keenly feeling it; and, if falsely accused, answered\r\n     nothing. She never spoke disparagingly of others, unless clearest\r\n     duty exacted it. Gossips, tattlers, and backbiters were her\r\n     trinity of horrors. Her absolute truthfulness was shown in the\r\n     smallest things. With a severe sincerity, it was applied to all\r\n     those customs looked upon as mere forms involving no\r\n     principle--customs exacting the utterance of what is not meant,\r\n     of wishes unfelt, sheer deceptions. She never invited a visit or\r\n     call not desired. If she said, \"Stay longer,\" the words voiced a\r\n     wish felt. She could not be brought under bondage to any usage or\r\n     custom, any party watch-word, or shibboleth of a speculative\r\n     creed, or any mode of dress or address. In Charleston, she was\r\n     exact in her Quaker costume, because, to the last punctilio, it\r\n     was an anti-slavery document; and for that she would gladly make\r\n     any sacrifice of personal comfort. But, among the \"Friends\" in\r\n     Philadelphia, she would not wear an article of dress which caused\r\n     her physical inconvenience, though it might be dictated by the\r\n     universal usage of \"Friends.\" Upon first exchanging the warmth of\r\n     a Carolina winter for the zero of a Northern one, she found the\r\n     \"regulation\" bonnet of the \"Friends\" a very slight protection\r\n     from the cold. So she ordered one made of fur, large enough to\r\n     protect both head and face. For this departure from usage, she\r\n     was admonished, \"It was a grief to 'Friends,'\" \"It looked like\r\n     pride and self-will,\" \"It was an evil example,\" etc. While\r\n     adhering strictly to the principles of \"Friends,\" neither she nor\r\n     her sister Sarah could conform to all their distinctive usages,\r\n     nor accept all their rules. Consequently, their examples were\r\n     regarded as quiet protests against some of the settled customs of\r\n     the Society. Such they felt bound to make them in word and act.\r\n     Thus they protested against the negro-seat in their\r\n     meeting-house, by making it their seat. They also felt\r\n     constrained to testify against a rule requiring that no Friend\r\n     should publish a book without the sanction of the \"Meeting for\r\n     Sufferings\"; so, also, the rule that any one who should marry out\r\n     of the Society should, unless penitent, be disowned.\r\n     Consequently, when Angelina thus married, she was disowned, as\r\n     was Sarah for sanctioning the marriage by her presence. The\r\n     committee who \"dealt\" with them for those violations of the rule,\r\n     said that if they would \"express regret,\" they would relieve the\r\n     meeting from the painful necessity of disowning them. The sisters\r\n     replied that, feeling no regret, they could express none; adding\r\n     that, as they had always openly declared their disapproval of the\r\n     rule, they could neither regret their violation of it, nor\r\n     neglect so fit an occasion for thus emphasizing their convictions\r\n     by their acts; adding that they honored the \"Friends\" all the\r\n     more for that fidelity which constrained them to do, however\r\n     painful, what they believed to be their duty.\r\n\r\n     Angelina's \"Appeal to the Christian Women of the South\" \"made her\r\n     a forced exile from her native State.\" As she never voluntarily\r\n     spoke of what she had done or suffered, few, if any, of the\r\n     Abolitionists, either knew then, or know now, that she was really\r\n     exiled by an Act of the Charleston city government. When her\r\n     \"Appeal\" came out, a large number of copies were sent by mail to\r\n     South Carolina. Most of them were publicly burned by postmasters.\r\n     Not long after this, the city authorities learned that Miss\r\n     Grimké was intending to visit her mother and sisters, and pass\r\n     the winter with them. Thereupon the mayor of Charleston called\r\n     upon Mrs. Grimké, and desired her to inform her daughter that the\r\n     police had been instructed to prevent her landing while the\r\n     steamer remained in port, and to see to it that she should not\r\n     communicate, by letter or otherwise, with any persons in the\r\n     city; and, further, that if she should elude their vigilance, and\r\n     go on shore, she would be arrested and imprisoned, until the\r\n     return of the steamer. Her Charleston friends at once conveyed to\r\n     her the message of the mayor, and added that the people of\r\n     Charleston were so incensed against her, that if she should go\r\n     there, despite the mayor's threat of pains and penalties, she\r\n     could not escape personal violence at the bands of the mob. She\r\n     replied to the letter, that her going would doubtless compromise\r\n     her family; not only distress them, but put them in peril, which\r\n     she had neither heart nor right to do; but for that fact, she\r\n     would certainly exercise her constitutional right as an American\r\n     citizen, and go to Charleston to visit her relatives, and, if for\r\n     that the authorities should inflict upon her pains and penalties,\r\n     she would willingly bear them, assured that such an outrage would\r\n     help to reveal to the free States the fact that slavery defies\r\n     and tramples alike constitutions and laws, and thus outlaws\r\n     itself.\r\n\r\n     When the American Anti-Slavery Society wrote to Miss Grimké,\r\n     inviting her to visit New York city, and hold meetings in private\r\n     parlors with Christian women, on the subject of slavery, upon\r\n     reading their letter, she handed it to her sister Sarah, saying,\r\n     \"I feel this to be God's call. I can not decline it.\" A long\r\n     conversation followed, the details of which I received from Sarah\r\n     not long after; and, as they present vividly the marked\r\n     characteristics of both sisters, I give in substance such as I\r\n     can recall.\r\n\r\n     S.--But you know that you are constitutionally retiring,\r\n     self-distrustful, easily embarrassed. You have a morbid shrinking\r\n     from whatever would make you conspicuous.\r\n\r\n     A.--Yes, you have drawn me to the life. I confess that I have all\r\n     that, and yet at times I have nothing of it. I know that I am\r\n     diffident about assuming responsibilities; but when I feel that\r\n     anything is mine to do, no matter what, then I have no fear.\r\n\r\n     S.--You are going among strangers, you wear strange garments,\r\n     speak in a strange language, will be in circumstances wholly\r\n     novel, and about a work that you never attempted, and most of\r\n     those who will listen to you have prejudices against\r\n     Abolitionists, and also against a woman's speaking to any\r\n     audience. Now in all there embarrassing circumstances, and in\r\n     your lack of self-confidence when you come to face an\r\n     unsympathizing audience, does not it seem likely that you will\r\n     find it impossible to speak to edification, and thus will be\r\n     forced to give it up altogether?\r\n\r\n     A.--Yes, it seems presumptuous for me to undertake it; but yet I\r\n     can not refuse to do it. The conviction is a part of me. I can\r\n     not absolve myself from it. The responsibility is thrust upon me.\r\n     I can not thrust it off.\r\n\r\n     S.--I know you will not and can not. My only desire is for you\r\n     deliberately to look at all things just as they are, and give\r\n     each its due weight. If, after that, your conviction is\r\n     unchanged, with my whole heart I'll help you to carry it out.\r\n     There is but one thing more that I think of. If you were to go\r\n     upon this mission without the sanction of the \"Meeting for\r\n     Sufferings,\" it would be regarded as disorderly, a violation of\r\n     the established usage of the Society, and they would probably\r\n     feel compelled to disown you. [This was prior to the disownment\r\n     that followed the marriage].\r\n\r\n     A.--As my mind is made up absolutely to go, I can not ask their\r\n     leave to go. For their fidelity to their views of duty, I honor\r\n     them. It is a grief to me to grieve them, but I have no\r\n     alternative. Very unpleasant it will be to be disowned, but\r\n     misery to be self-disowned.\r\n\r\n     S.--I have presented these considerations, that you might\r\n     carefully traverse the whole question and count all the costs. I\r\n     dare not say a word against your decision. I see that it is\r\n     final, and that you can make no other. To me, it is sacred. While\r\n     we have been talking, I, too, have made my decision. It is this:\r\n     where you go, I will go; what you do, I will to my utmost help\r\n     you in doing. We have always thought and wept and prayed\r\n     together over this horrible wrong, and now we will go and work\r\n     together. There will be a deal to be done in private also; that I\r\n     can help you about, and thus you will have the more strength to\r\n     give to the meetings.\r\n\r\n     So Miss Grimké wrote at once to the committee, accepting their\r\n     invitation, thanking them for the salary offered, but declining\r\n     to receive any; informing them that her sister would accompany\r\n     her, and that they should both go exclusively at their own\r\n     expense.\r\n\r\nIn 1864, Mr. and Mrs. Weld removed to Hyde Park, where the sisters\r\nspent the rest of their days. No one who met Angelina there would have\r\nany suspicion of the great work which she had done: she was interested\r\nin her household duties, and the little charities of the neighborhood.\r\nOnce, during the war, she was persuaded to go out of her daily\r\nroutine, and to attend a small meeting called for the purpose of\r\nassisting the Southern people--freedmen, and those who had formerly\r\nheld them in slavery. Very simply and modestly, but very clearly and\r\nimpressively, she spoke of the condition of things at the South, of\r\nher friends there, and how we could best help them--all in the most\r\nloving and tender spirit, as if she had only grateful memories of what\r\nthey had been, and as if no thought of herself mingled with the\r\nthought of them. The simplicity, directness, and practical good sense\r\nof her speech then, its kindliness toward those who had done her the\r\ngreatest wrong, and the entire absence of self-consciousness, made\r\nthose who heard her feel that a woman might speak in public without\r\nviolating any of the proprieties or prejudices of social traditions\r\nand customs. There was a refinement and dignity about her, an\r\natmosphere of gentleness and sweetness and strength, which won their\r\nway to the heart. To those who knew her history, there was something\r\nvery affecting, sublime, in her absolute self-forgetfulness. As one\r\nwho knew her most intimately said, \"She seems to have been born in\r\nthat mood of mind which made vanity or display impossible. She was the\r\nonly person I have ever known who was absolutely free from all\r\nambition.\"\r\n\r\nSpace prevents a fitting record of the noble words and deeds of Sarah\r\nMoore Grimké. She published in 1838, a volume of \"Letters on the\r\nEquality of the Sexes,\" which called out much discussion on woman's\r\nposition in both State and Church. The last time Angelina spoke in\r\npublic was at the Loyal League Convention in New York in 1863. She\r\ntook an active part in the discussion of resolutions, speaking clearly\r\nand concisely on every point, and read a beautiful address she had\r\nprepared--\"To the Soldiers of our Second Revolution.\" All through the\r\nyears that Angelina was illustrating woman's capacity on the platform\r\nby holding her audiences spell-bound, Sarah was defending woman's\r\nright to be there with her pen.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[59] Mrs. Ellet's \"Women of the Revolution.\"\r\n\r\n[60] Angelina E. Grimké.\r\n\r\n[61] This building, the property of Jacob Peirce, was thus imperilled\r\nwith his free consent.\r\n\r\n[62] The Assembly Buildings, opened to us by the kindness of the\r\nlessee, Mr. John Toy.\r\n\r\n[63] She was the positive power of so much anti-slavery work, that\r\nJames Russell Lowell spoke of her as \"the coiled-up mainspring of the\r\nmovement.\"\r\n\r\n[64] In speaking of her, Lydia Maria Child said in her obituary notice\r\nin the _National Anti-Slavery Standard_ of May 11, 1867: \"All\r\nsurvivors of the old Abolition band will remember Thankful Southwick\r\nas one of the very earliest, the noblest, and the most faithful of\r\nthat small army of moral combatants who fought so bravely and so\r\nperseveringly for the deliverance of the down-trodden. Mrs. Southwick\r\nwas born and educated in the Society of Friends, and to their calmness\r\nof demeanor she added their indomitable persistence in the path of\r\nduty. One of the most exciting affairs that ever occurred in Boston\r\nwas known as the 'Baltimore Slave Case.' Two girls had escaped in a\r\nBoston vessel, and when about to be carried back, were brought out on\r\na writ of 'habeas corpus.' All Boston was in a ferment for and against\r\nthe fugitives. The commercial world were determined that this Southern\r\nproperty should be restored to the white claimants, and the\r\nAbolitionists were determined that it should remain in the possession\r\nof the original owners until a bill of sale from the Almighty could be\r\nproduced. By the vigilance and ingenious arrangements of 'Father\r\nSnowden' and Thankful Southwick, at a given signal the slaves were\r\nspirited away from the crowded court-room, and out of the city. The\r\nagent of the slaveholders standing near Mrs. Southwick, and gazing\r\nwith astonishment at the empty space, where an instant before the\r\nslaves stood, she turned her large gray eyes upon him and said, 'Thy\r\nprey hath escaped thee.' Wherever working or thinking was to be done\r\nfor our righteous cause, there was Thankful Southwick ever ready with\r\nwise counsel and energetic action. She and her excellent husband were\r\namong the very first to sustain Garrison in his unequal contest with\r\nthe strong Goliath of slavery. At that time they were in affluent\r\ncircumstances, and their money was poured forth freely for the\r\nunpopular cause which had as yet found no adherents among the rich.\r\nTheir commodious house was a caravansary for fugitive slaves, and for\r\nanti-slavery pilgrims from all parts of the country. At the\r\nanniversary meetings when most of the Abolitionists were desirous to\r\nhave for their guests, Friend Whittier, the Hon. James G. Birney,\r\nGeorge Thompson, Theodore, or Angelia Weld, Joseph and Thankful\r\nSouthwick were quietly looking about for such of the anti-slavery\r\nbrothers and sisters as were too little known to be likely to receive\r\ninvitations. Always kindly unpretending, clear-sighted to perceive the\r\nright, and faithful in following it wherever it might lead. They were\r\nupright in all their dealings with the world, tender and true in the\r\nrelations of private life and the memory they have left is a\r\nbenediction.\"\r\n\r\n[65] On a recent visit at the home of Robert Purvis, of Philadelphia,\r\nin talking over those eventful days one evening in company with Daniel\r\nNeale, it was amusing and gratifying to hear those gentlemen dilate on\r\nthe grandeur of her bearing through those mobs in Pennsylvania Hall.\r\nIt seems on that occasion she had a beautiful crimson shawl thrown\r\ngracefully over her shoulders. One of these gentlemen remarked, \"I\r\nkept my eye on that shawl, which could be seen now here, now there,\r\nits wearer consulting with one, cheering another; and I made up my\r\nmind that until that shawl disappeared, every man must stand by his\r\nguns.\"\r\n\r\n[66] Abby Kelly.\r\n\r\n[67] Just previous to this Convention Horace Mann, President of\r\nAntioch College, had been giving a lecture through the country, and\r\nmade many severe strictures on the false philosophy of the woman\r\nsuffrage movement, or rather what he supposed it to be. This was\r\nconsidered the more damaging because Mr. Mann so strongly favored\r\nco-education. It was as if one in our own camp had suddenly turned\r\ntraitor. Among other things he said that our legislative halls were\r\nsuch bear gardens that they were not fit for women to enter. It is to\r\nthis remark reference is made in the debates.\r\n\r\n[68] This letter will be found in \"Reminiscences of Lucretia Mott,\" at\r\nthe close of this chapter.\r\n\r\n[69] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[70] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[71] In accordance with this plan Matilda Joslyn Gage prepared a\r\nstory, entitled \"The Household,\" treating different phases of woman's\r\nwrongs, and presented it to the Committee. But as nothing was ever\r\ndone to carry out the proposition, the manuscript was returned to the\r\nauthor, and slumbers in her garret with other rejected manuscripts.\r\n\r\n[72] The first National Convention held in Washington was in January,\r\n1869.\r\n\r\n[73] Joseph C. Neal.\r\n\r\n[74] It seems these inexperienced parents had armed themselves with\r\nthe most approved works on the construction and capacities of infants,\r\nin one of which they found the statement that the stomach of a\r\nnew-born child could hold only one tablespoonful of milk. Accordingly\r\nthe boy was restricted to that amount, once an hour. Although he\r\nprotested against this limited supply by constant wailing, and\r\nshrivelled from day to day into a miniature mummy, the system was\r\npursued, until at last \"Sister Sarah,\" who had had suspicions for some\r\ntime that the child's capacity was underrated, thought she would\r\nassume the responsibility of giving him for once all the milk he could\r\ntake. What he did do, so far outmeasured what the doctrinaire said he\r\ncould do, that the child was happily permitted ever after to decide\r\nfor himself. The faith of the trusting parents was thus visibly shaken\r\nin one theory, and I am happy to add, in due time in many others,\r\nregarding the Graham system of dietetics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nLUCRETIA MOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Eulogy at the Memorial Services[75] held in Washington by the\r\n     National Woman Suffrage Association, January 19, 1881. By\r\n     Elizabeth Cady Stanton.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of January, 1793, the little island of Nantucket, fifteen\r\nmiles by three and a half, lying far out into the sea on the coast of\r\nMassachusetts, welcomed to its solitude a child destined to be one of\r\nAmerica's most famous women. This was a fitting birthplace for\r\nLucretia Mott; as the religion and commerce of the island (named for a\r\nwoman) had been guided by a woman's brain. In 1708 Mary Starbuck,\r\nknown as \"The Great Merchant,\" a woman of remarkable breadth of\r\nintellect, as well as great executive ability, converted the colony to\r\nQuakerism, and vindicated woman's right to interest herself in the\r\ncommerce of the world. Perhaps she, like the good genii of old,\r\nbrought her gifts to that cradle and breathed into the new life the\r\nlofty inspiration that made this woman the prophet and seer she was.\r\nHere were the descendants of John Wolman, William Rotch, George Fox,\r\nthe Macys, the Franklins, the Folgers; and in this pure atmosphere,\r\nand from these distinguished ancestors, Lucretia Mott received her\r\ninheritance. Her father was an honest, sea-faring Quaker. Her mother\r\nbelonged to the Folger family, whose culture, genius, common-sense,\r\nand thrift culminated in Benjamin Franklin, and later, in Lucretia\r\nMott. The resemblance between her head and that of the philosopher and\r\nstatesman, was apparent to the most casual observer.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mott says in her diary: \"I always loved the good in childhood,\r\nand desired to do the right. In those early years I was actively\r\nuseful to my mother, who, in the absence of my father on his long\r\nvoyages, was engaged in mercantile business, often going to Boston to\r\npurchase goods in exchange for oil and candles, the staple of the\r\nisland. The exercise of women's talents in this line, as well as the\r\ngeneral care which devolved upon them, in the absence of their\r\nhusbands, tended to develop and strengthen them mentally and\r\nphysically.\r\n\r\n\"In 1804 my father's family removed to Boston, and in the public and\r\nprivate schools of that city I mingled with all classes without\r\ndistinction. It was the custom then to send the children of such\r\nfamilies to select schools; but my parents feared that would minister\r\nto a feeling of class pride, which they felt was sinful to cultivate\r\nin their children. And this I am glad to remember, because it gave me\r\na feeling of sympathy for the patient and struggling poor, which but\r\nfor this experience I might never have known.\" Under such humane\r\ninfluences, with such ancestors and associations, in the public\r\nschools, in the Friends' meeting, on the adventurous island, and in\r\nthe suburbs of Boston, the child passed into girlhood, with lessons of\r\nindustry and self-denial well learned, and with her life all before.\r\nShe lived in a period when women of genius had vindicated their right\r\nto be recognized in art, science, literature, and government, and\r\nthrough many of the great events that have made the United States a\r\nNation. It was such a combination of influences that developed\r\nLucretia Mott into the exceptional woman she was.\r\n\r\nIn an unlucky hour her father endorsed for a friend, and to save his\r\nhonor, was compelled to lose his property. It was a blow from which he\r\ndid not recover, and henceforward much of the support of the family\r\ndevolved upon the mother, who had remarkable tact, energy, and\r\ncourage. Both parents were ambitious for their children, and did all\r\nthey could for their education; that was one thing about which all\r\nQuakers were tenacious. In her fourteenth year Lucretia and her elder\r\nsister were sent to \"The Nine Partners,\" a Friends boarding-school in\r\nDutchess County, New York, and there pursuing her studies with patient\r\nzeal, she remained two years without once going home for a holiday\r\nvacation. At fifteen, a teacher having left, Lucretia was made an\r\nassistant, and at the end of the second year, was tendered the place\r\nof teacher, with the inducement beside, that her services would\r\nentitle a younger sister to her education.\r\n\r\nHer well-balanced character enabled her to meet with calmness, all\r\nlife's varied trials, of which she had her full share. As one of eight\r\nchildren in her father's house, with his financial embarrassments, and\r\nsudden death: and afterward with five children of her own, and her\r\nhusband's reverses; Lucretia's heroism and strength of mind were\r\nfairly tested. In both of these financial emergencies, she opened a\r\nschool, and by her success as a teacher, bridged over the chasm.\r\n\r\nIn her eighteenth year, Lucretia Coffin and James Mott, according to\r\nQuaker ceremony, became husband and wife, the result of an attachment\r\nformed at boarding-school, which proved to be an exceptionally happy\r\nunion, and through their long wedded life, of over half a century,\r\nthey remained ever loyal to one another. James Mott, though a Quaker,\r\nwas in all personal qualities the very opposite of his wife. He had\r\nthe cool judgment, she the enkindling enthusiasm. He had the slow,\r\nsure movement; she the quick, impulsive energy. He enjoyed nothing\r\nmore than silence; she nothing more than talking. The one was\r\ncompletely the complement of the other. She possessed a delicate love\r\nof fun, and was full of dry humor. Once during a visit from her\r\nhusband's brother, Richard Mott, of Toledo, Ohio, who like James was a\r\nvery silent man, she became suddenly aware of their absence and\r\nstarted to look for them. Finding them seated on either side of a\r\nlarge wood fire in the drawing-room, she said, \"Oh, I thought you must\r\nboth be here it was so quiet.\"\r\n\r\nIn speaking of them, Robert Collyer says: \"If James and Lucretia had\r\ngone around the world in search of a mate, I think they would have\r\nmade the choice which heaven made for them. They had lived together\r\nmore than forty years when I first knew them. I thought then, as I\r\nthink now, that it was the most perfect wedded life to be found on\r\nearth. They were both of a most beautiful presence. He, large, fair,\r\nwith kindly blue eyes, and regular features. She, slight, with dark\r\neyes and hair. Both, of the sunniest spirit; both, free to take their\r\nown way, as such fine souls always are, and yet their lives were so\r\nperfectly one that neither of them led or followed the other, so far\r\nas one could observe, by the breadth of a line. He could speak well,\r\nin a slow, wise way, when the spirit moved him, and the words were all\r\nthe choicer because they were so few. But his greatness, for he was a\r\ngreat man, lay still in that fine, silent manhood, which would only\r\nbreak into fluent speech as you sat with him by the bright wood fire\r\nin winter, while the good wife went on with her knitting, putting it\r\nswiftly down a score of times in an hour, to pound a vagrant spark\r\nwhich had snapped on the carpet, or as we sat under the trees in the\r\nsummer twilight. Then James Mott would open his heart to those he\r\nloved, and touch you with wonder at the depth and beauty of his\r\nthoughts; or tell you stories of the city where when a young man he\r\nlived, or of the choice humors of ancient Quakers, who went through\r\nthe world esteeming laughter vain, and yet set the whole world which\r\nknew them laughing at their quaint ways and curious fancies.\"\r\n\r\nIn his young days, James Mott was a teacher; later on he engaged in\r\nthe cotton business, but abandoned it when it was becoming\r\nremunerative, because of its connection with slave labor. He finally\r\ntook up the wool business, and retired with a competency some years\r\nbefore his death, which enabled them to take a trip to Europe, and\r\nafterward live the life of leisure they desired, indulging their\r\nliterary tastes. James Mott wrote a very creditable book of their\r\ntravels, and Lucretia carried enough observations of foreign life in\r\nher head to fill folios.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mott was a housekeeper of the old school, in so far as everything\r\nfrom garret to cellar passed under her supervision. She took the\r\nentire care of her children, and although with remarkable economy\r\nsupplying the wants and guarding against the wastes of a large family,\r\nshe did not allow these necessary cares to absorb all her time and\r\nthought, but cultivated the talents entrusted to her in broader\r\ninterests than family life. She felt she had duties in the Church and\r\nthe State as well as the home. The time most wives and mothers spend\r\nin gaiety and embroidery, she spent in reading and committing to\r\nmemory choice thoughts in poetry and prose. The money others spent in\r\nfilling their homes with bric-a-brac she spent in books, and the\r\nresult proves the superior wisdom of her course.\r\n\r\nWhen conventions were held in Philadelphia, her house was always\r\nfilled with guests. As presiding officer in a woman's convention\r\nnothing escaped her notice. She felt responsible that everything\r\nshould be done in good taste and order. Her opinions on woman's\r\nnature, sphere, destiny, were thoroughly digested, and any speaker\r\nthat did not come up to her exact ideal, was taken delicately to task\r\nwhen her turn came to speak. As some one remarks, \"she had a playful\r\nway of tapping a speaker in a public meeting, as a skillful driver\r\ntouches his horses with the tip end of his whip.\" Once, says Wendell\r\nPhillips, she tried the experiment on me when I had ventured to say\r\nthat one of the drawbacks to the movement, was the indifference of\r\nwomen themselves. Other speakers too expressed sentiments on which\r\nMrs. Mott differed from them. When she arose she touched them all\r\nround with her gentle raillery, offending no one, just pronounced\r\nenough in her speech to be effective, and in no way compromising\r\nherself. Glancing at the platform on one occasion in Philadelphia, the\r\ncentral figure, is Lucretia Mott in Quaker costume, in the zenith of\r\nher refined beauty; around her are grouped James Mott, William Lloyd\r\nGarrison, Wendell Phillips, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Robert Purvis,\r\nCharles Burleigh, Ernestine L. Rose, Frances Dana Gage, Hannah Tracy\r\nCutler, Lydia Mott, Martha C. Wright, Ann Preston, Sarah Pugh, Hannah\r\nDarlington, Mary Grew, Matilda Joslyn Gage, Susan B. Anthony, and Lucy\r\nStone, as refined and remarkable an assembly of men and women as could\r\nbe found in any European court. Yet these were the people so hated and\r\nridiculed by the press and the pulpit, whose grand utterances and\r\nspicy debates were stigmatized as \"the maudlin sentimentalisms of\r\nunsexed men and women.\"\r\n\r\nBut let us follow these friends to the home of Lucretia Mott. A large\r\nhouse on Arch Street, like all buildings in the city of brotherly\r\nlove, with white shutters, marble cappings and steps, and dining-room\r\non the second floor of the rear building. There are our stern\r\nreformers, round the social board, as genial a group of martyrs as one\r\ncould find. Without the shadow of a doubt as to the rightfulness of\r\ntheir own position, and knowing too that the common sense of the\r\nnation was on their side, they made merry over the bigotry of the\r\nChurch, popular prejudices, conservative fears, absurd laws and\r\ncustoms hoary with age. How they did hold up in their metaphysical\r\ntweezers the representatives of the dead past that ever and anon\r\nventured upon our platform. With what peals of laughter their\r\nassumptions and contradictions were chopped into mince meat. On this\r\noccasion, William Lloyd Garrison occupied the seat of honor at Mrs.\r\nMott's right hand, and led the conversation which the hostess always\r\nskillfuly managed to make general. When seated around her board, no\r\ntwo-and-two side talk in monotone was ever permissible; she insisted\r\nthat the good things said should be enjoyed by all. At the close of\r\nthe meal, while the conversation went briskly on, with a neat little\r\ntray and snowy towel, she washed up the silver and china as she\r\nuttered some of her happiest thoughts. James Mott at the head of the\r\ntable maintained the dignity of his position, ever ready to throw in a\r\nqualifying word, when these fiery reformers became too intense.\r\n\r\nTheirs was the ideal home, perfect in its appointments, and where\r\ndiscussion on all subjects took the widest range. Being alike in\r\nsearch of truth, one felt no fear of shocking them. Those accustomed\r\nto see priests and bigots, whenever a doubt was expressed as to any of\r\ntheir cherished opinions, rise and leave the room with a deeply\r\nwounded expression, were surprised to see James and Lucretia Mott\r\ncalmly discussing with guests, their own most cherished creeds, and\r\nquestioning the wisdom of others in turn. Freedom was not a deity in\r\ntheir home to be worshiped afar off, but the patron saint of the\r\nhousehold, influencing all who entered there, giving her benedictions\r\nto each at every feast.\r\n\r\nTheir home was the castle of safety for runaway slaves, and the\r\nparadise of the unfortunate. All knew that if the mistress met them\r\nempty handed, she would cheer their lonely hearts with kind words,\r\nrecognizing their humanity, and with sure promise of some future\r\nconsideration. Her house was a resort too for people of distinction.\r\nWhen Frederika Bremer, Harriet Martineau, Lord Morpeth, Lord and Lady\r\nAmberley, visited this country, the reformers were the people they\r\ndesired to see, and chief among them Lucretia Mott, after whom Lady\r\nAmberley named her first daughter. Thus titled foreigners, scholars,\r\nand politicians often met at her fireside. I have frequently heard\r\nGerrit Smith describe a call he once made there. In a conversation of\r\nan hour, she was interrupted half a dozen times with applications for\r\ncharity. At last, in came the glorious Fanny Kemble, meeting Mrs. Mott\r\nin a manner that clearly showed they were warm and well-known friends;\r\nand soon came Frederick Douglass. There sat the millionaire\r\nphilanthropist, the world-renowned actor, the grandest representative\r\nof slavery, and the fearless disciple of Elias Hicks. I doubt if the\r\nQuaker City ever unveiled so magnificent a tableaux for the pen of an\r\nartist.\r\n\r\nIn her diary Mrs. Mott says: \"At twenty-five years of age, surrounded\r\nwith a family and many cares, I felt called to a more public life of\r\ndevotion to duty, and engaged in the ministry in the 'Society of\r\nFriends,' receiving every encouragement from those in authority until\r\nthe separation amongst us in 1827, when my convictions led me to\r\nadhere to those who believed in the sufficiency of the light within,\r\nresting on 'truth for authority rather than authority for truth.' The\r\npopular doctrine of original sin never commended itself to my reason\r\nor conscience, except on the theory of original holiness also. I\r\nsearched the Scriptures daily, ofttimes finding a construction of the\r\ntext wholly different from that which had been pressed on our\r\nacceptance. The highest evidence of a sound faith being the practical\r\nlife of the Christian, I have felt a far greater interest in the moral\r\nmovements of the age than in any theological discussion.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1818 she began to preach in \"Friends' Meeting,\" and through New\r\nEngland, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, she spoke at an early\r\nday on the tenets of her sect. She affiliated with the branch called\r\n\"Hicksite,\" or \"Unitarian Quakers.\" As Mrs. Mott was a disciple of\r\nElias Hicks, we can get some insight as to her religious faith by a\r\nfew extracts from different points in his creed as stated by himself.\r\nIn one of his sermons he says:\r\n\r\n     As many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God.\r\n     What is the Spirit of God? It is the light and life in the soul\r\n     of man. All that men and books can do is to point us to this\r\n     great principle which is only to be known in our own souls. The\r\n     way to arrive at a knowledge of this divine love and divine\r\n     light, and to fulfill the whole law, is to love all the creation\r\n     of God, and do right to all men and beasts.\r\n\r\n     Again he speaks of the divine love and divine light which he says\r\n     are one, indivisibly one. The Lord is love, and love may be\r\n     considered as comprehending all His power and all His wisdom; but\r\n     goodness is the most proper term that we can apply. Every one, he\r\n     says, is enlightened by the same divine light that enlightened\r\n     Jesus, and we receive it from the same source. He had the\r\n     fullness of it as we have our several allotments. All the varied\r\n     names given in Scripture to this divine light and life such as,\r\n     \"Emmanuel,\" \"Jesus,\" \"Sent of God,\" \"Great Prophet,\" \"Christ our\r\n     Lord,\" \"Grace,\" \"Unction,\" \"Anointed,\" mean one and the same\r\n     thing, and are nothing less nor more than the spirit and power of\r\n     God in the soul of man as his Creator, Preserver, Condemner,\r\n     Redeemer, Saviour, Sanctifier, and Justifier.\r\n\r\nThe Hicksites differed from the other Friends in that they placed the\r\nlight within above all external authority, while the Orthodox Friends\r\nmake the Scriptures the surer guide, though some make the written word\r\nand inner light of equal authority. In a letter to John C. Sanders, in\r\n1828, Elias Hicks says:\r\n\r\n     Not all the books ever written, nor all the miracles recorded in\r\n     the Scriptures, nor all other external evidence of what kind\r\n     soever, has ever revealed God (who is an eternal invisible\r\n     Spirit) to any one of the children of men. Heaven is not a fixed\r\n     place above, nor hell below, but both are states of the soul. The\r\n     blood of Christ shed upon the cross has no more power to cleanse\r\n     us from sin than the blood of bullocks and rams poured out on\r\n     Jewish altars could cleanse that people from their sins. We must\r\n     know Christ within us to save us from sin; men depend so much on\r\n     the crucifixion that they heed not the light within.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful prophet and seer was seventy-nine years old when the\r\nseparation began in Philadelphia. The division in this country created\r\ngreat excitement among the Quakers in England, who were very active in\r\ntheir hostility to Elias Hicks and his doctrines. Some of them came to\r\nAmerica to bear their testimony. Among others, Annie Braithwaite\r\ntraveled extensively and addressed Friends' meetings. Mrs. Mott states\r\nthat on one occasion when she was present, the English Quakeress, in\r\npreaching salvation by the blood of Christ, had spoken with more than\r\nusual unction and enthusiasm. As soon as she finished a profound\r\nsilence reigned. Elias Hicks, slowly rising and removing his hat, said\r\nin deep inspired tones: \"Friends, to the Christ that never was\r\ncrucified; to the Christ that never was slain; to the Christ that can\r\nnot die. I commend you.\"\r\n\r\nMany of the professed followers of Elias Hicks lacked the courage and\r\nconscience to maintain his principles when the magnetism of his direct\r\ninfluence was withdrawn by his death. Hence even in that division of\r\nthe Friends to which she belonged, Mrs. Mott encountered much\r\nopposition, especially for her public identification with unpopular\r\nreforms. Many would have gladly seen her withdraw from their\r\nmembership, and others were desirous that she should be disowned. But\r\nshe understood her own rights and Friends Discipline too well to\r\nviolate a single rule. Although her enemies kept close watch, they\r\nnever caught her off her guard. At the time of the division, she\r\nremarked to an acquaintance: \"It seemed to me almost like death at\r\nfirst to be shut out of the Friends Meeting where I had loved to go\r\nfor religious communion, to see the cold averted looks from those\r\nwhose confidence I once enjoyed, to be shunned as unworthy of notice;\r\nall this was hard to endure, but it was the price I paid for being\r\ntrue to the convictions of my own soul.\"\r\n\r\nHer spiritual life was deep and earnest, but entirely her own. It was\r\nintuitional, not emotional. It was expressed in her love for man in\r\nGod, and not God in creeds and ceremonies. She prized the free\r\nsentiments of William Ellery Channing, read his works with avidity,\r\nand always had some volume of his at hand. The Life of Rev. Joseph\r\nBlanco White, a rare book, was for years one of the companions of her\r\nsolitude. It was thoroughly worn, and the margin covered with her\r\nnotes and marks of approval. Dean Stanley and Buckle's \"History of\r\nCivilization\" were favorites with her also. Cowper's \"Task\" and\r\nYoung's \"Night Thoughts,\" which had been her text-books at \"Nine\r\nPartners,\" never lost their charm for her. She could repeat pages of\r\nthem. In her last days she read \"The Light of Asia\" with intense\r\npleasure. When she had already passed her eighty-seventh year, Susan\r\nB. Anthony visiting her, says: \"She read aloud to us from that\r\ncharming poem until after eleven o'clock at night.\" Her conversation,\r\nas well as her public addresses, were sprinkled with beautiful and apt\r\ncitations from her favorite authors, as it was the habit of her life\r\nto commit to memory sentiments she most valued in poetry and prose.\r\n\r\nIt was not possible that a woman like Lucretia Mott should keep\r\nsilence in the churches, no matter what Paul might say to the\r\ncontrary, because that great brain was created to think, that noble\r\nheart to beat through making and moulding speech, and those fine gray\r\neyes to see what the prophets in all times have seen. I can not\r\nimagine her as one of the silent sisters who though having something\r\nto say, dare not say it though to save her own soul or the souls of\r\nthose about her.\r\n\r\n     An old friend in Lancaster County, says Robert Collyer, told me\r\n     of his first hearing her in the early days when as yet she was\r\n     almost unknown. It had been a dreary time among Friends up\r\n     there, and being a man who did not care for the traditions of\r\n     \"first day\" and \"fourth day,\" he was getting tired of silence.\r\n     One \"first day\" he went to his meeting expecting nothing as\r\n     usual, and pretty sure he would not be disappointed. Nor was he\r\n     for a time. But presently a young woman arose in the high seat he\r\n     had never seen before, whose presence touched him with strange\r\n     new expectations. She looked, he said, as one who had no great\r\n     hold on life, and began to speak in low tones, with just a touch\r\n     of hesitation as of one feeling after her thought, and there was\r\n     a tremor in her voice as if she felt the burden of the spirit.\r\n     But she soon found her way out of this, and then he said he began\r\n     to hold his breath. He had never heard such speaking in all his\r\n     life, so born of conviction, so radiant with that inward light\r\n     for which he had been waiting, that he went home feeling as he\r\n     supposed they must have felt in the olden time who thought they\r\n     had heard an angel.\r\n\r\n     I once heard such an outpouring. It was at a woods-meeting up\r\n     among the hills where quite a number of us had our say, and then\r\n     my friend's turn came. She was well on in years then, but the old\r\n     fire still burned clear, and God's breath touched her out of\r\n     heaven and she prophesied. I suppose she spoke for two hours, but\r\n     after the first moment she never faltered or failed to hold the\r\n     multitude spell-bound, and waiting on her words. Yet there was\r\n     not the least hint of premeditation, while there was boundless\r\n     wealth of meditation in her deep, pregnant thoughts. I have said\r\n     she prophesied, no other term would answer to her speech. Her\r\n     eyes had seen the coming glory of the Lord, and she testified\r\n     that she had seen; and this was all the more wonderful to me,\r\n     because it was the habit of her mind in later years to reason, as\r\n     President McCosh does, from premise to conclusion. But she had\r\n     seen a vision there sitting in the August splendor with the voice\r\n     of God's presence whispering in the trees, and the vision had set\r\n     the heart high above the brain. These were care-worn and\r\n     work-worn folks she saw about her with knotted hands resting on\r\n     the staff, or folded quietly on the lap. They had nearly done the\r\n     good day's work, and now preacher and prophet were needed to tell\r\n     them what that day's work meant, where they keep the books for\r\n     us, and so it was not a speech, but a psalm of life.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mott was safe at all points in taking Elias Hicks for a teacher\r\nof morals, as he was pronounced on every reform. On the question of\r\nwoman's rights, he says:\r\n\r\n     If Paul said of women preachers what we find in Corinthians and\r\n     Timothy, I judge that he had no allusion at all to their\r\n     preaching or prophesying in the churches; and if he had, we have\r\n     no right to admit it as sound doctrine, as it contradicts a\r\n     number of his own declarations (and the general testimony of\r\n     Scripture), which are more rational and clear, as in the\r\n     fourteenth chapter of Romans; and in Philippians where he speaks\r\n     of the women who labored with him in the Gospel; and in 1st\r\n     Corinthians where he speaks of women praying and prophesying; and\r\n     Paul assures us that male and female are one in Christ. Also\r\n     under the law there were prophetesses as well as prophets, and\r\n     the effusion of the Spirit in the latter days as prophesied by\r\n     Joel was to be equally on sons and daughters, servants and\r\n     handmaids. To believe otherwise is irrational and inconsistent\r\n     with the divine attributes, and would charge the Almighty with\r\n     partiality and injustice to one-half of His rational creation.\r\n     Therefore I believe it would be wrong to admit it, although\r\n     asserted in the most plain and positive manner by men or angels.\r\n\r\n     In our last conflict with Great Britain, Elias Hicks called the\r\n     attention of \"Friends\" to a faithful support of their testimony\r\n     against war and injustice, desiring them to maintain their\r\n     Christian liberties against encroachment of the secular powers,\r\n     laws having been enacted levying taxes for the support of the\r\n     war. At one meeting there was considerable altercation; as some\r\n     Friends who refused payment had been distrained some three or\r\n     four fold more than the tax demanded, while others complied, paid\r\n     the tax, and justified themselves in so doing. On this point his\r\n     mind was deeply exercised and he labored to encourage Friends to\r\n     faithfulness to exalt their testimonies for the Prince of Peace.\r\n\r\n     Elias Hicks preached against slavery both in Maryland and\r\n     Virginia. He says of a meeting in Baltimore that he especially\r\n     addressed slave-holders. Further, he opposed the use of\r\n     slave-grown goods. At a meeting in Providence, R. I., he said he\r\n     was moved to show the great and essential difference there is\r\n     between the righteousness of man comprehended in his laws,\r\n     customs, and traditions, and the righteousness of God which is\r\n     comprehended in pure, impartial, unchangeable justice. They who\r\n     continue this traffic, and enrich themselves, by the labor of\r\n     these deeply oppressed Africans, violate these plain principles\r\n     of justice, and no cunning sophistical reasoning in the wisdom of\r\n     this world can justify them, or silence the convictions of\r\n     conscience.\r\n\r\nSome other Friends were much opposed to the use of slave products, but\r\nthe Society in general \"had no concern\" on this point. Lucretia Mott\r\nused \"free goods,\" and thought that Elias' preaching such extreme\r\ndoctrines on all these practical reforms, had their effect in the\r\ndivision. To refuse to pay taxes, or to use any \"slave produce,\"\r\ninvolved more immediate and serious difficulties, than any theoretical\r\nviews of the hereafter, and even Friends may be pardoned for feeling\r\nsome interest in their own pecuniary independence. To see their\r\nfurniture, cattle, houses, lands, all swept away for exorbitant taxes,\r\nseemed worse than paying a moderate one to start with. From these\r\nquotations from the great reformer and religious leader, we see how\r\nfully Mrs. Mott accepted his principles; not because they were his\r\nprinciples, for she called no man master, but because she felt them to\r\nbe true. In her diary she says:\r\n\r\n     My sympathy was early enlisted for the poor slave by the\r\n     class-books read in our schools, and the pictures of the\r\n     slave-ship, as published by Clarkson. The ministry of Elias Hicks\r\n     and others on the subject of the unrequited labor of slaves, and\r\n     their example in refusing the products of slave labor, all had\r\n     effect in awakening a strong feeling in their behalf.\r\n\r\n     The unequal condition of woman in society, also early impressed\r\n     my mind. Learning while at school that the charge for the\r\n     education of girls was the same as that for boys, and that when\r\n     they became teachers women received but half as much as men for\r\n     their services, the injustice of this was so apparent, that I\r\n     early resolved to claim for my sex all that an impartial Creator\r\n     has bestowed.\r\n\r\n     The Temperance reform too engaged my attention; and for more than\r\n     forty years I have practiced total abstinence from all\r\n     intoxicating drinks.\r\n\r\n     The cause of Peace has had a share of my efforts; leading to the\r\n     ultra non-resistance ground; that no Christian can consistently\r\n     uphold a government based on the sword, or relying on that as an\r\n     ultimate resort.\r\n\r\n     The oppression of the working classes by existing monopolies, and\r\n     the lowness of wages often engaged my attention; and I have held\r\n     many meetings with them, and heard their appeals with compassion,\r\n     and a great desire for a radical change in the system which makes\r\n     the rich richer, and the poor poorer. The various associations\r\n     and communities, tending to greater equality of condition, have\r\n     had from me a hearty God-speed.\r\n\r\n     But the millions of down-trodden slaves in our land being the\r\n     most oppressed class, I have felt bound to plead their cause, in\r\n     season and out of season, to endeavor to put my soul in their\r\n     souls' stead, and to aid in every right effort for their\r\n     immediate emancipation. This duty was impressed upon me at the\r\n     time I consecrated myself to that Gospel which anoints to \"preach\r\n     deliverance to the captive,\" to \"set at liberty them that are\r\n     bruised.\" From that time the duty of abstinence, as far as\r\n     practicable, from slave-grown products was so clear that I\r\n     resolved to make the effort \"to provide things honest\" in this\r\n     respect. Since then, our family has been supplied with free\r\n     labor, groceries, and to some extent, with cotton goods unstained\r\n     by slavery.\r\n\r\n     The labors of the devoted Benjamin Lundy, and his \"Genius of\r\n     Universal Emancipation,\" published in Baltimore, added to the\r\n     untiring exertions of Clarkson, Wilberforce, and others in\r\n     England, including Elizabeth Heyrick, whose work on slavery\r\n     aroused them to a change in their mode of action; and of William\r\n     Lloyd Garrison, in Boston, prepared the way for a Convention in\r\n     Philadelphia, to take the ground of immediate, not gradual\r\n     emancipation, and to impress the duty of unconditional liberty\r\n     without expatriation.\r\n\r\nDecember 3, 1833, the American Anti-Slavery Society was formed in\r\nPhiladelphia. Among the sixty-two people present were Lucretia Mott,\r\nLydia White, and Esther Moore, Rev. Beriah Green in the chair. In\r\nreading and discussing their Declaration of Sentiments, Mrs. Mott\r\nwishing to make some suggestions, asked the chairman in her modest way\r\nif she might speak. Mr. Green promptly and enthusiastically responded,\r\n\"Certainly, certainly, say all you are moved to say.\" She at once\r\nproposed to strike out two words from one sentence in the Declaration,\r\n\"We may be personally defeated, but our principles never (can be).\"\r\nOne readily sees how much stronger the sentence is made by striking\r\nout the last two words. The quickness of Mrs. Mott in grasping the\r\nsentiment and phraseology of a resolution or appeal was always\r\nremarkable in our conventions. Mr. Garrison, who wrote the\r\nanti-slavery Declaration, readily accepted her amendment. When the\r\nmembers were asked for their signatures, as James Mott pen in hand\r\nstood near the desk, Thomas Shipley said that before signing it would\r\nbe well to consider, as it would bring down on their heads terrible\r\npersecutions and great losses in their business relations. He said he\r\nshould sign it himself, but he would advise James Mott and others to\r\npause. The moment Mr. Shipley ceased speaking, Lucretia, in a brave\r\ninspiring tone said, \"James, put down thy name,\" which he quickly did,\r\njoining in the general smile of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nSoon after the burning of Pennsylvania Hall, at a social gathering one\r\nevening, Dr. Moore in conversation with Mrs. Mott strongly condemned\r\nthe fanaticism and impolicy of the Abolitionists, and especially the\r\nwomen; he said they should do all their reform work through the\r\nFriends' meeting. Being much excited, in the course of his remarks, he\r\nbecame very insulting. Mrs. Mott patiently reasoned with him for\r\nawhile; at last becoming very indignant, she arose, and leaving him\r\nremarked: \"All I have to say to thee in parting is, 'Get thee behind\r\nme, Satan.'\" He immediately took his hat and in silence left the\r\nhouse. Lucretia Mott ante-dated even Mr. Garrison in her protests\r\nagainst slavery. Robert Purvis, of Philadelphia, says he heard her as\r\nearly as 1829 preach against slavery, on several occasions in the\r\ncolored church.\r\n\r\n     In 1833, says Mrs. Mott, the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery\r\n     Society was formed, and being actively associated in the efforts\r\n     for the slaves' redemption, I have traveled thousands of miles in\r\n     this country, holding meetings in some of the slave States, have\r\n     been in the midst of mobs and violence, and have shared\r\n     abundantly in the odium attached to the name of an uncompromising\r\n     modern Abolitionist, as well as partaken richly of the sweet\r\n     return of peace, attendant on those who would \"undo the heavy\r\n     burdens and let the oppressed go free; and break every yoke.\"\r\n\r\n     In 1840, a World's Anti-Slavery Convention was called in London.\r\n     Women from Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, were delegates to\r\n     that Convention. I was one of the number; but, on our arrival in\r\n     England, our credentials were not accepted, because we were\r\n     women. We were, however, treated with the greatest courtesy and\r\n     attention, as strangers, and were admitted to chosen seats as\r\n     spectators and listeners, while our right of membership was\r\n     denied. This brought the woman question more into view, and an\r\n     increase of interest on the subject has been the result. In this\r\n     work, too, I have engaged heart and hand; as my labors, travels,\r\n     and public discourses evince. The misrepresentation, ridicule,\r\n     and abuse heaped upon this, as well as other reforms, do not in\r\n     the least deter me from my duty. To those whose name is cast out\r\n     as evil for the truth's sake, it is a small thing to be judged of\r\n     man's judgment.\r\n\r\n     This imperfect sketch may give some idea of the mode of life of\r\n     one who has found it \"good to be always zealously affected in a\r\n     good thing.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, as an enthusiastic Abolitionist, Mrs. Mott crossed the ocean to\r\ntake part in the deliberations of the World's Anti-Slavery\r\nConvention, the last drop in her cup of sorrow was the humiliation she\r\nwas called to suffer on account of sex. The vote by which this\r\ninjustice was perpetrated, was due to the overwhelming majority of the\r\nclergy, who, with Bible in hand, swept all before them. No man can\r\nfathom the depths of rebellion in woman's soul when insult is heaped\r\nupon her sex, and this is intensified when done under the hypocritical\r\nassumption of divine authority. This fresh baptism into woman's\r\ndegradation impelled the current of her thoughts into a new channel,\r\nand returning home, she, with a few friends as rebellious as herself,\r\ncalled the first Woman's Rights Convention. To this cause she brought\r\na zeal unknown before, as here she could see the wrongs of a class\r\nfrom a purely subjective point of view.\r\n\r\nThere are often periods in the lives of earnest, imaginative beings,\r\nwhen some new book or acquaintance comes to them like an added sun in\r\nthe heavens, lighting the darkest recesses and chasing every shadow\r\naway. Thus came Lucretia Mott to me, at a period in my young days when\r\nall life's problems seemed inextricably tangled; when, like Noah's\r\ndove on the waters, my soul found no solid resting-place in the whole\r\nworld of thought. The misery of the multitude was too boundless for\r\ncomprehension, too hopeless for tender feeling; despair supplanted all\r\nother emotions, and the appalling views of the future threw their dark\r\nshadows over the sweetest and most innocent pleasures of life. Before\r\nmeeting Mrs. Mott, I had heard a few men of liberal opinions discuss\r\nvarious political, religious, and social theories, but with my first\r\ndoubt of my father's absolute wisdom, came a distrust of all men's\r\nopinions on the character and sphere of woman; and I naturally\r\ninferred that if their judgments were unsound on a question I was sure\r\nI did understand, they were quite likely to be so on those I did not.\r\nHence, I often longed to meet some woman who had sufficient confidence\r\nin herself to frame and hold an opinion in the face of opposition, a\r\nwoman who understood the deep significance of life to whom I could\r\ntalk freely; my longings were answered at last.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1840, I met Mrs. Mott for the first time, in London. Crossing\r\nthe Atlantic in company with James G. Birney, then the Liberty Party\r\ncandidate for President, soon after the bitter schism in the\r\nanti-slavery ranks, he described to me as we walked the deck day after\r\nday, the women who had fanned the flames of dissension, and had\r\ncompletely demoralized the anti-slavery ranks. As my first view of\r\nMrs. Mott was through his prejudices, no prepossessions in her favor\r\nbiased my judgment. When first introduced to her at our hotel in Great\r\nQueen Street, with the other ladies from Boston and Philadelphia who\r\nwere delegates to the World's Convention, I felt somewhat embarrassed,\r\nas I was the only lady present who represented the \"Birney faction,\"\r\nthough I really knew nothing of the merits of the division, having\r\nbeen outside the world of reforms. Still, as my husband and my cousin,\r\nGerrit Smith, were on that side, I supposed they would all have a\r\nfeeling of hostility toward me. However, Mrs. Mott, in her sweet,\r\ngentle way, received me with great cordiality and courtesy, and I was\r\nseated by her side at dinner.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were the viands fairly dispensed, than several Baptist\r\nministers began to rally the ladies on having set the Abolitionists\r\nall by the ears in America, and now proposing to do the same thing in\r\nEngland. I soon found that the pending battle was on woman's rights,\r\nand that unwittingly I was by marriage on the wrong side. As I had\r\nthought much on this question in regard to the laws, Church action,\r\nand social usages, I found myself in full accord with the other\r\nladies, combating most of the gentlemen at the table; our only\r\nchampion, George Bradburn, was too deaf to hear a word that was said.\r\nIn spite of constant gentle nudgings by my husband under the table,\r\nand frowns from Mr. Birney opposite, the tantalizing tone of the\r\nconversation was too much for me to maintain silence. Calmly and\r\nskillfully Mrs. Mott parried all their attacks, now by her quiet humor\r\nturning the laugh on them, and then by her earnestness and dignity\r\nsilencing their ridicule and sneers. I shall never forget the look of\r\nrecognition she gave me when she saw by my remarks that I fully\r\ncomprehended the problem of woman's rights and wrongs. How beautiful\r\nshe looked to me that day.\r\n\r\nI had always regarded a Quaker woman, as one does a Sister of Charity,\r\na being above ordinary mortals, ready to be translated at any moment.\r\nI had never spoken to one before, nor been near enough to touch the\r\nhem of a garment. Mrs. Mott was to me an entire new revelation of\r\nwomanhood. I sought every opportunity to be at her side, and\r\ncontinually plied her with questions, and I shall never cease to be\r\ngrateful for the patience and seeming pleasure with which she fed my\r\nhungering soul. Seeing the lions in London together, on one occasion\r\nwith a large party we visited the British Museum, where it is supposed\r\nall people go to see the wonders of the world. On entering, Mrs. Mott\r\nand myself sat down near the door to rest for a few moments, telling\r\nthe party to go on, that we would follow. They accordingly explored\r\nall the departments of curiosities, supposing we were slowly following\r\nat a distance; but when they returned, after an absence of three\r\nhours, there we sat in the same spot, having seen nothing but each\r\nother, wholly absorbed in questions of theology and social life. She\r\nhad told me of the doctrines and divisions among \"Friends,\" of the\r\ninward light, of Elias Hicks, of Channing, of a religion of practical\r\nlife, of Mary Wollstonecroft, her social theories, and her demands of\r\nequality for women. I had been reading Combe's \"Constitution of Man\"\r\nand \"Moral Philosophy,\" Channing's works, and Mary Wollstonecroft,\r\nthough all tabooed by orthodox teachers, but I had never heard a woman\r\ntalk what, as a Scotch Presbyterian, I had scarcely dared to think.\r\n\r\nOn the following Sunday I went to hear Mrs. Mott preach in a Unitarian\r\nchurch. Though I had never heard a woman speak, yet I had long\r\nbelieved she had the right to do so, and had often expressed the idea\r\nin private circles; but when at last I saw a woman rise up in the\r\npulpit and preach as earnestly and impressively as Mrs. Mott always\r\ndid, it seemed to me like the realization of an oft-repeated happy\r\ndream. The day we visited the Zoological Gardens, as we were admiring\r\nthe gorgeous plumage of some beautiful birds, one of our gentlemen\r\nopponents remarked, \"You see, Mrs. Mott, our Heavenly Father believes\r\nin bright colors. How much it would take from our pleasure if all the\r\nbirds were dressed in drab.\" \"Yes,\" said she, \"but immortal beings do\r\nnot depend on their feathers for their attractions. With the infinite\r\nvariety of the human face and form, of thought, feeling, and\r\naffection, we do not need gorgeous apparel to distinguish us.\r\nMoreover, if it is fitting that woman should dress in every color of\r\nthe rainbow, why not man also? Clergymen, with their black clothes and\r\nwhite cravats, are quite as monotonous as the Quakers.\"\r\n\r\nI remember on one occasion the entire American delegation were invited\r\nto dine with Samuel Gurney, a rich Quaker banker. He had an elegant\r\nplace, a little out of London. The Duchess of Sutherland and Lord\r\nMorpeth, who had watched our anti-slavery struggle in this country\r\nwith great interest, were quite desirous of meeting the American\r\nAbolitionists, and had expressed the wish to call on them at this\r\ntime. Standing near Mrs. Mott when the coach and four gray horses with\r\nthe six out-riders drove up, Mr. Gurney, in great trepidation, said,\r\n\"What shall I do with the Duchess?\" \"Give her your arm,\" said Mrs.\r\nMott, \"and introduce her to each member of the delegation.\" A\r\nsuggestion no commoner in England would have presumed to follow. When\r\nthe Duchess was presented to Mrs. Mott, her gracious ease was fully\r\nequaled by that of the simple Quaker woman. Oblivious to all\r\ndistinctions of rank, she talked freely and wisely on many topics, and\r\nproved herself in manner and conversation the peer of the first woman\r\nin England. Mrs. Mott did not manifest the slightest restraint or\r\nembarrassment during that marked social occasion. No fictitious\r\nsuperiority ever oppressed her, neither did she descend in familiar\r\nsurroundings from her natural dignity, but always maintained the\r\nperfect equilibrium of respect for herself and others.\r\n\r\nI found in this new friend a woman emancipated from all faith in\r\nman-made creeds, from all fear of his denunciations. Nothing was too\r\nsacred for her to question, as to its rightfulness in principle and\r\npractice. \"Truth for authority, not authority for truth,\" was not only\r\nthe motto of her life, but it was the fixed mental habit in which she\r\nmost rigidly held herself. It seemed to me like meeting a being from\r\nsome larger planet, to find a woman who dared to question the opinions\r\nof Popes, Kings, Synods, Parliaments, with the same freedom that she\r\nwould criticise an editorial in the _London Times_, recognizing no\r\nhigher authority than the judgment of a pure-minded, educated woman.\r\nWhen I first heard from the lips of Lucretia Mott that I had the same\r\nright to think for myself that Luther, Calvin, and John Knox had, and\r\nthe same right to be guided by my own convictions, and would no doubt\r\nlive a higher, happier life than if guided by theirs, I felt at once a\r\nnew-born sense of dignity and freedom; it was like suddenly coming\r\ninto the rays of the noon-day sun, after wandering with a rushlight in\r\nthe caves of the earth. When I confessed to her my great enjoyment in\r\nworks of fiction, dramatic performances, and dancing, and feared from\r\nunderneath that Quaker bonnet (I now loved so well) would come some\r\nplatitudes on the demoralizing influence of such frivolities, she\r\nsmiled, and said, \"I regard dancing a very harmless amusement\"; and\r\nadded, \"the Evangelical Alliance that so readily passed a resolution\r\ndeclaring dancing a sin for a church member, tabled a resolution\r\ndeclaring slavery a sin for a bishop.\"\r\n\r\nSitting alone one day, as we were about to separate in London, I\r\nexpressed to her my great satisfaction in her acquaintance, and\r\nthanked her for the many religious doubts and fears she had banished\r\nfrom my mind. She said, \"There is a broad distinction between religion\r\nand theology. The one is a natural, human experience common to all\r\nwell-organized minds. The other is a system of speculations about the\r\nunseen and the unknowable, which the human mind has no power to grasp\r\nor explain, and these speculations vary with every sect, age, and type\r\nof civilization. No one knows any more of what lies beyond our sphere\r\nof action than thou and I, and we know nothing.\" Everything she said\r\nseemed to me so true and rational, that I accepted her words of wisdom\r\nwith the same confiding satisfaction that did the faithful Crito\r\nthose of his beloved Socrates. And yet this pure, grand woman was\r\nshunned and feared by the Orthodox Friends throughout England. While\r\nin London a rich young Quaker of bigoted tendencies, who made several\r\nbreakfast and tea parties for the American delegates, always omitted\r\nto invite Mrs. Mott. He very politely said to her on one occasion when\r\nhe was inviting others in her presence, \"Thou must excuse me,\r\nLucretia, for not inviting thee with the rest, but I fear thy\r\ninfluence on my children!!\"\r\n\r\nOn several occasions when we all met at social gatherings in London,\r\nElizabeth Fry studiously avoided being in the same apartment with\r\nLucretia Mott. If Mrs. Mott was conversing with a circle of friends on\r\nthe lawn, Mrs. Fry would glide into the house. If Mrs. Mott entered at\r\none door, Mrs. Fry walked out the other. She really seemed afraid to\r\nbreathe the same atmosphere. On another occasion, at William Ball's,\r\nat Tottenham, when more circumscribed quarters made escape impossible,\r\nit was announced that Mrs. Fry felt a concern to say something to\r\nthose present. When all was silent she knelt and prayed, pouring forth\r\na solemn Jeremiad against the apostasy and infidelity of the day in\r\nlanguage so pointed and personal, that we all felt that Mrs. Mott was\r\nthe special subject of her petition. She accepted the intercession\r\nwith all due humility, and fortunately for the harmony of the occasion\r\nwas not moved to pray for Mrs. Fry, that she might have more love and\r\ncharity for those who honestly differed with her on unimportant points\r\nof theology. How hateful such bigotry looks to those capable of\r\ngetting outside their own educational prejudices. How pitiable, that\r\neven good people should thus allow themselves to ostracise and\r\npersecute those who hold different opinions from their own. Elizabeth\r\nFry was not afraid to mingle in Newgate prison with the scum of the\r\nearth, but she was afraid to touch the hem of Lucretia Mott's garment.\r\nIf Mrs. Fry felt that she had a higher truth, how did she know that\r\nshe might not influence Mrs. Mott for good? Lucretia was never afraid\r\nof anybody. Nothing would have pleased her better than to compare her\r\npearls of thought and faith with Elizabeth Fry.\r\n\r\nVisiting in many Quaker families during our travels in England, I was\r\namazed to hear Mrs. Mott spoken of as a most dangerous woman. Again\r\nand again I was warned against her influence. She was spoken of as an\r\ninfidel, a heretic, a disturber, who had destroyed the peace in the\r\nFriends Society in Pennsylvania, and thrown a firebrand into the\r\nWorld's Convention, and that in a recent speech in London she quoted\r\nsentiments from Mary Wollstonecroft and Thomas Paine. Having just\r\nlearned to worship Lucretia Mott as the embodiment of all that was\r\nnoble and charming in womanhood, the terrible fear that she inspired\r\namong English \"Friends\" filled me with sorrow and surprise. I never\r\nventured to mention her name in their homes unless they first\r\nintroduced it.\r\n\r\nSitting in the World's Convention one day after half the world had\r\nbeen voted out, when Joseph Sturge, a wealthy Quaker, occupied the\r\nchair, I suggested to Mrs. Mott a dangerous contingency. Said I,\r\n\"Suppose in spite of the vote of excommunication the Spirit should\r\nmove you to speak, what could the chairman do, and which would you\r\nobey? the Spirit or the Convention?\" She promptly replied, \"Where the\r\nSpirit of God is, there is liberty.\"\r\n\r\nMany anecdotes are told of Mrs. Mott's rigid economy, such as sewing\r\ntogether the smallest rags to be woven into carpets, and writing\r\nletters on infinitesimal bits of paper; but it must not be inferred\r\nfrom this peculiarity that she was penurious, as she was generous in\r\nher charities, and in the support of every good cause. Considering her\r\nmeans and the self-denial she practiced in her personal expenses, her\r\ngifts were lavish. Alfred Love, President of the Peace Society, who\r\nfrequently received letters from Mrs. Mott, says: \"The one before me\r\nis two and a half inches wide by two and a quarter inches long,\r\nwritten on both sides, and contains one hundred and forty-one words,\r\nand treats of seven distinct matters, and disposes of them in good\r\norder, apologizing for her apparent economy of paper, and enclosing a\r\ncontribution of five dollars for a benevolent object.\" Though she\r\nalways dressed in Quaker costume, she attached no special significance\r\nto it as a means of grace. One Sunday morning at a religious meeting,\r\nshe was in her accustomed seat in the gallery, when a young man, a\r\nstranger to many, spoke in behalf of Peace. At the close of the\r\nmeeting some one who could not see the speaker asked Lucretia Mott his\r\nname, and added: \"Does he wear a standing collar and dress plain?\" She\r\nreplied in her happy, cheerful manner, \"Well, really I did not look to\r\nsee, I was too much interested in what he said to look at the cut of\r\nhis coat.\"\r\n\r\n'Mid all the differences, dissensions, and personal antagonisms,\r\nthrough the years we have labored together in the Woman's Rights\r\nmovement, I can not recall one word or occasion in which Mrs. Mott's\r\ninfluence has not been for harmony, good-will, and the broadest\r\ncharity. She endured too much persecution herself ever to join in\r\npersecuting others. In every reform she stood in the fore-front of the\r\nbattle. Wherever there was a trying emergency to be met, there you\r\ncould rely on Lucretia Mott. She never dodged responsibility nor\r\ndisagreeable occasions. At one time when excitement on the divorce\r\nquestion ran high in New York, and there was a great hue and cry about\r\nfree love on our platform, I was invited to speak before the\r\nLegislature on the bill then pending asking \"divorce for drunkenness.\"\r\nWe chose the time at the close of one of our Conventions, that Mrs.\r\nMott might be present, which she readily consented to do, and promised\r\nto speak if she felt moved. She charged Ernestine Rose and myself not\r\nto take too radical ground, in view of the hostility to the bill, but\r\nto keep closely to the merits of the main question. I told her she\r\nmight feel sure of me, as I had my speech written, and I would read it\r\nto her, which I did, and received her approval.\r\n\r\nThe time arrived for the hearing, and a magnificent audience greeted\r\nus at the Capitol. The bill was read, I made the opening speech, Mrs.\r\nRose followed. We had asked for the modification of certain statutes\r\nand the passage of others making the laws more equal for man and\r\nwoman. Mrs. Mott having listened attentively to all that was said, and\r\ncoming to the conclusion that with eighteen different causes for\r\ndivorce in the different States, there might as well be no laws at all\r\non the question, she arose and said, that \"she had not thought\r\nprofoundly on this subject, but it seemed to her that no laws whatever\r\non this relation would be better than such as bound pure, innocent\r\nwomen in bondage to dissipated, unprincipled men. With such various\r\nlaws in the different States, and fugitives from the marriage bond\r\nfleeing from one to another, would it not be better to place all the\r\nStates on the same basis, and thus make our national laws\r\nhomogeneous?\" She was surprised on returning to the residence of Lydia\r\nMott, to hear that her speech was altogether the most radical of the\r\nthree. The bold statement of \"no laws,\" however, was so sugar-coated\r\nwith eulogies on good men and the sacredness of the marriage relation,\r\nthat the press complimented the moderation of Mrs. Mott at our\r\nexpense. We have had many a laugh over that occasion.\r\n\r\nAn amusing incident occurred the first year, 1869, we held a\r\nConvention in Washington. Chaplain Gray, of the Senate, was invited to\r\nopen the Convention with prayer. Mrs. Mott and I were sitting close\r\ntogether, with our heads bowed and eyes closed, listening to the\r\ninvocation. As the chaplain proceeded, he touched the garden scene in\r\nParadise, and spoke of woman as a secondary creation, called into\r\nbeing for the especial benefit of man, an afterthought with the\r\nCreator. Straightening up, Mrs. Mott whispered to me, \"I can not bow\r\nmy head to such absurdities.\" Edward M. Davis, in the audience,\r\nnoticed his mother's movements, and knowing that what had struck his\r\nmind had no doubt disturbed hers also, he immediately left the hall,\r\nreturning shortly after Bible in hand, that he might confound the\r\nchaplain with the very book he had quoted. He ascended the platform\r\njust as Mr. Gray said \"amen,\" and read from the opening chapter of\r\nGenesis, the account of the simultaneous creation of man and woman, in\r\nwhich dominion was given to both alike over every living thing. After\r\nMr. Davis made a few pertinent remarks on the allegorical character of\r\nthe second chapter of Genesis, Mrs. Mott followed with a critical\r\nanalysis of the prayer, and the portion of the Scripture read by her\r\nson, showing the eternal oneness and equality of man and woman, the\r\nunion of the masculine and feminine elements, like the positive and\r\nnegative magnetism, the centripetal and centrifugal forces in nature,\r\npervading the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms, the whole world\r\nof thought and action, as there could have been no perpetuation of\r\ncreation without these elements equal and eternal in the Godhead. The\r\npress commented on the novelty of reviewing an address to the throne\r\nof grace, particularly when uttered by the chaplain of Congress. Mrs.\r\nMott remarked on these criticisms, \"If we can teach clergymen to be as\r\ncareful what they say to God as to man, our Conventions at the capital\r\nwill be of great service to our representatives.\"\r\n\r\nAs a writer Mrs. Mott was clear and concise; her few published\r\nsermons, her charming private letters and diary, with what those who\r\nknew her best can remember, are all of her thoughts bequeathed to\r\nposterity. As a speaker she was calm, clear, and unimpassioned;\r\nindulged but little in wit, humor, or pathos, but by her good common\r\nsense and liberality on all questions, by her earnestness and\r\nsimplicity, she held the most respectful attention of her audiences.\r\nHence an occasional touch of humor or sarcasm, or an outburst of\r\neloquent indignation came from her with great power. She had what the\r\nFriends call unction; that made the most radical utterances from her\r\nlips acceptable. In her conversation she was original and brilliant,\r\nearnest and playful. Such was her persuasiveness of voice and manner\r\nthat opinions received with hisses from another speaker, were\r\napplauded when uttered by Mrs. Mott.\r\n\r\nSome one has said that \"sagacity, a mental quick-wittedness for\r\nmeeting an emergency, a sagacity that might have been called\r\nshrewdness, had it not been for a pervading heart quality that went\r\nwith it, was one of her prominent traits.\" Perhaps a wise diplomacy\r\nmight express this quality more nearly. No one knew better than she\r\nhow to avoid the sharp angles of a character or an occasion, as the\r\nmany anecdotes told of her so fully illustrate.\r\n\r\nReturning from England in 1840, in a merchant vessel, a large number\r\nof Irish emigrants were on board in the steerage. On the voyage Mrs.\r\nMott was moved to hold a religious meeting among them, but the matter\r\nbeing broached to them, their Catholic prejudices objected. They would\r\nnot hear a woman preach, for women priest were not allowed in their\r\nChurch. But the spirit that was pressing upon the \"woman preacher\" for\r\nutterance was not to be prevented from delivering its message without\r\na more strenuous effort to remove the obstacle. She asked that the\r\nemigrants might be invited to come together to consider with her\r\nwhether they would have a meeting. This was but fair and right, and\r\nthey came. She then explained how different her idea of a meeting was\r\nfrom a church service to which they were accustomed; that she had no\r\nthought of saying anything derogatory of that service nor of the\r\npriests who ministered to them; that her heart had been drawn to them\r\nin sympathy, as they were leaving their old homes for new ones in\r\nAmerica; and that she had wanted to address them as to their habits\r\nand aims in their every-day life in such a way as to help them in the\r\nland of strangers to which they were going. And then asking if they\r\nwould listen (and they were already listening because her gracious\r\nvoice and words so entranced them they could not help it), she said\r\nshe would give an outline of what she had wanted to say at the\r\nmeeting, and so she was drawn on by the silent sympathy she had\r\nsecured until the Spirit's message was delivered; and only the keenest\r\nwitted of her Catholic hearers waked up to the fact, as they were\r\ngoing out, that they had got the preachment from the woman priest\r\nafter all.\r\n\r\nPresiding at a woman's convention on one occasion, a speaker painted a\r\nvery vivid picture in the darkest colors of this nation's injustice to\r\noppressed classes, and from the experience of other nations not based\r\nupon principle, he foretold the certain downfall of our republic. On\r\nrising, he had said that \"he feared he should not be able to do his\r\ntheme justice, as he had just risen from a bed of sickness,\" but\r\nwarming up with his subject he rivaled Isaiah in his Jeremiad, and\r\nleft his audience in gloom and despair, the president sharing in the\r\ngeneral feeling, for the appeal had been thrilling and terrible. In a\r\nmoment, however, Mrs. Mott arose, saying: \"I trust our future is not\r\nas hopeless as our faithful friend, Parker Pillsbury, has just\r\npictured. We must remember he told us in starting that he had just\r\nrisen from a bed of sickness, and that may in a measure account for\r\nhis gloomy forebodings.\" The audience burst forth into a roar of\r\napplause and laughter, and the president introduced the next speaker,\r\nseemingly unconscious that she had stabbed the prophet through and\r\nthrough, and dissipated the effect of his warnings.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mott was frequently chosen the presiding officer of the early\r\nconventions. Though she seldom regarded Cushing's Manual in her\r\nrulings, she maintained order and good feeling by the persuasiveness\r\nand serenity of her voice and manner. Emerson says: \"It is not what\r\nthe man says, but it is the spirit behind it which makes the\r\nimpression.\" It was this subtle magnetism of the true, grand woman,\r\never faithful to her highest convictions of truth, that made her\r\nalways respected in every position she occupied. Hers was pure moral\r\npower, for in that frail organization there could be but little of\r\nwhat is called physical magnetism. Her placid face showed that she was\r\nat peace with herself, the first requisite in a successful leader of\r\nreform. That Mrs. Mott could have maintained her sweetness and charity\r\nto the end, is a marvel in view of the varied and protracted\r\npersecutions she endured.\r\n\r\nRarely have so many different and superior qualities been combined in\r\none woman. She had great personal beauty; her brow and eye were\r\nremarkable. Although small in stature, it is said of her as it was of\r\nChanning, he too being of diminutive size, that she made you think she\r\nwas larger than she was. She had a look of command. The amount of will\r\nforce and intelligent power in her small body was enough to direct the\r\nuniverse; yet she was modest and unassuming and had none of the\r\npersonal airs of leadership. Her manners were gentle and\r\nself-possessed under all circumstances. Her conversation, though\r\ngenerally serious, earnest and logical, was sometimes playful and\r\nalways good humored. Her attitude of mind was receptive. She never\r\nseemed to think even in her latest years that she had explored all\r\ntruth. Though she had very clearly defined opinions on every subject\r\nthat came under her consideration, she never dogmatized.\r\n\r\nIt was this healthy balance of good qualities that made her great\r\namong other women of genius; and the multiplicity of her interests in\r\nhuman affairs that kept her fresh and young to the last. The thinkers,\r\nthe scholars, the broadest intellects are often the octogenarians,\r\nwhile the narrow selfish souls dry up in their own channels. One of\r\nher noble sisters in reform has truly said, \"Birth made Victoria a\r\nqueen, but her own pure, sweet life made Lucretia Mott a queen; queen\r\nof a realm on which the sun never sets, the realm of humanity. If ever\r\nany one inherited the earth it was this blessed Quaker woman.\"\r\n\r\nSpace fails me to tell of all the pleasant memories of our forty\r\nyears friendship, of the inspiration she has been to those on our\r\nplatform, of the bond of union to hold us together, of the innumerable\r\nconventions over which she has presided, of the many long journeys\r\nboth North and South to carry the glad tidings of justice, liberty,\r\nand equality to all. A missionary who always traveled at her own\r\nexpense, giving her best thoughts freely, asking nothing in return,\r\nneither money, praise, nor honor; for misrepresentation and cruel\r\npersecution were the only return she had for years. Both in religion\r\nand reform hers was a free gospel to the multitude.\r\n\r\nAs division has been the law in politics, religion, and reform, woman\r\nsuffrage proved no exception. But Lucretia Mott and her noble sister,\r\nMartha O. Wright, remained steadfast with those who had taken the\r\ninitiative steps in calling the first Convention, and with the larger\r\nand more radical division their sympathies remained, both being\r\nprominent officers of the National Woman Suffrage Association at the\r\ntime of their death. They fully endorsed the great lesson of the war,\r\nNational protection for United States citizens, applied to woman as\r\nwell as to the African race, the doctrine the association to which\r\nthey belonged has so successfully advocated at Washington for twelve\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nReading the numerous complimentary obituary notices of our long loved\r\nfriend, so fair, so tender, so full of praise, we have exclaimed, what\r\nchanges the passing years have wrought in the popular estimate of a\r\nwoman once considered so dangerous an innovator in the social and\r\nreligious world; and yet the Lucretia Mott of to-day is only the\r\nperfected, well-rounded character of half a century ago. But the\r\nslowly moving masses that feared her then as an infidel, a fanatic, an\r\nunsexed woman, have followed her footsteps until a broader outlook has\r\nexpanded their moral vision. The \"vagaries\" of the anti-slavery\r\nstruggle, in which she took a leading part, have been coined into law;\r\nand the \"wild fantasies\" of the Abolitionists are now the XIII., XIV.,\r\nand XV. Amendments to the National Constitution. The prolonged and\r\nbitter schisms in the Society of Friends have shed new light on the\r\ntyranny of creeds and scriptures. The infidel Hicksite principles that\r\nshocked Christendom, are now the corner-stones of the liberal\r\nreligious movement in this country. The demand for woman's social,\r\ncivil, and political equality--in which she was foremost--laughed at\r\nfrom the Atlantic to the Pacific, has been recognized in a measure by\r\ncourts and legislatures, in Great Britain and the United States. The\r\nold Blackstone code for woman has received its death-blow, and the\r\ncolleges, trades, and professions have been opened for her admission.\r\n\r\nThe name of Lucretia Mott represents more fully than any other in the\r\nnineteenth century, the sum of all womanly virtues. As wife, mother,\r\nfriend, she was marked for her delicate sentiments, warm affections,\r\nand steadfast loyalty; as housekeeper, for her rigid economy,\r\ncleanliness, order, and exhaustless patience with servants and\r\nchildren; as neighbor, for justice and honor in all her dealings; as\r\nteacher, even at the early age of fifteen, for her skill and\r\nfaithfulness.\r\n\r\nOne who has lived eighty-eight years 'mid a young, impressible people\r\nlike ours, ever reflecting the exalted virtues of the true woman, the\r\nearnest reformer, the religious teacher, must have left her impress\r\nfor good in every relation of life. When we remember that every word\r\nwe utter, every act we perform, the individual atmosphere we create\r\nhave their effect, not only on all who come within the circle of our\r\ndaily life, but through them are wafted to innumerable other circles\r\nbeyond, we can in a measure appreciate the far-reaching influence of\r\none grand life. Great as has been the acknowledged, moral power of\r\nLucretia Mott, it would have been vastly greater, had her opinions\r\nbeen legitimately recognized in the laws and constitutions of the\r\nnation; and could she have enjoyed the consciousness of exerting this\r\ndirect influence, it would have intensified the holy purpose of her\r\nlife. \"The highest earthly desire of a ripened mind,\" says Thomas\r\nArnold, \"is the desire of taking an active share in the great work of\r\ngovernment.\" Those only who are capable of appreciating this dignity\r\ncan measure the extent to which this noble woman has been defrauded as\r\na citizen of this great Republic. Neither can they measure the loss to\r\nthe councils of the nation, of the wisdom of such a representative\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nIn the manifold tributes to the memory of our beloved friend, we have\r\nyet to see the first mention of her political degradation, which she\r\nso keenly felt and so often deplored on our platform. Why are the\r\npress and the pulpit, with all their eulogiums of her virtues, so\r\noblivious to the humiliating fact of her disfranchisement? Are\r\npolitical disabilities, accounted such grievous wrongs to the Southern\r\naristocrat, to the emancipated slave, to the proud Anglo-Saxon man in\r\nevery latitude, of so little value to woman that when a nation mourns\r\nthe loss of the grandest representative of our sex, no tear is shed,\r\nno regret expressed, no mention even made of her political\r\ndegradation?\r\n\r\nWe might ask the question why this universal outpouring of tributes to\r\nour venerated friend, exceeding all honors hitherto paid to the great\r\nwomen of our nation, who, one by one, have passed away It is because\r\nLucretia Mott was a philanthropist; her life was dedicated to the\r\nrights of humanity. When the poet, the novelist, the philosopher, and\r\nthe metaphysican have been forgotten, the memory of the true reformer\r\nwill remain engraven on the hearts of the multitude. Behold! the\r\nbeauty of yonder fountain, after its upward flight, is where it turns\r\nagain to earth, so is the life of one morally beautiful, ever drawn by\r\na law of its being from the clouds of speculation to the common\r\ninterests of humanity.\r\n\r\nThe question is often asked of us on this platform, will the children\r\nof these reformers take up the work that falls from their hands? It is\r\nmore than probable they will not. It is with reformers' children as\r\nothers, they seldom follow in the footsteps of their parents. As a\r\ngeneral thing the son of a farmer hates the plow, the son of a lawyer\r\nis not attracted to the bar, nor the son of a clergyman to the pulpit.\r\nThe daughter of the pattern housekeeper turns to literature or art,\r\nand the child of the reformer has no heart for martyrdom. It is\r\nphilosophical that our sons and daughters should not be here. To a\r\ncertain extent they have shared the odium and persecution we have\r\nprovoked, they have been ostracised and ignored for heresies they have\r\nnever accepted. The humiliation of our children has been the bitterest\r\ndrop in the cup of reformers. Look around our platform, not one\r\nrepresentative of the brave band of women who inaugurated this\r\nmovement is here! Not one of our kindred has ever yet in these\r\nconventions echoed our demands. Nevertheless we are, and shall be\r\nrepresented! We see bright new faces; we hear eloquent new voices;\r\nbrave young women are gathering round us, to plead our cause in more\r\naugust assemblies, and to celebrate the victory at last. These are our\r\nkindred, by holier ties than blood. As their way through life will be\r\nsmoother for all our noble friend has dared and suffered, may they by\r\nthe same courage and conscientious devotion to principle, shed new\r\nlight on the path of those who follow their footsteps. This is the\r\ngreat moral lesson the life of our dear friend should impress on the\r\ncoming generation.\r\n\r\nHaving known Lucretia Mott, not only in the flush of life, when all\r\nher faculties were at their zenith, but in the repose of advanced age,\r\nher withdrawal from our midst seems as natural and as beautiful as the\r\nchanging foliage of some grand oak from the spring-time to the\r\nautumn.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH CORRESPONDENCE.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting correspondence in regard to the exclusion of\r\nwomen from the World's Convention, reveals the fact that the action\r\nwas the result, after all, of religious bigotry more than prejudice\r\nagainst sex. And this opinion is further confirmed by the decided\r\nopposition promptly manifested to Lucretia Mott's proposal to have a\r\nseries of meetings for women alone. Some of the Orthodox Friends said\r\nthey were afraid, that under the plea of discussing emancipation for\r\nthe slave, other subjects might be introduced. Mrs. Mott, desiring to\r\nknow what Daniel O'Connell thought of the action of the Convention,\r\nwrote him as follows:\r\n\r\n     _To Daniel O'Connell, M.P.:_\r\n\r\n     The rejected delegates from America to the \"General Anti-Slavery\r\n     Conference,\" are desirous to have the opinion of one of the most\r\n     distinguished advocates of universal liberty, as to the reasons\r\n     urged by the majority for their rejection, viz: that the\r\n     admission of women being contrary to English usage would subject\r\n     them to ridicule, and that such recognition of their acknowledged\r\n     principles would prejudice the cause of human freedom.\r\n\r\n     Permit me, then, on behalf of the delegation, to ask Daniel\r\n     O'Connell the favor of his sentiments as incidentally expressed\r\n     in the meeting on the morning of the 13th inst., and oblige his\r\n     sincere friend,\r\n\r\n                                                  LUCRETIA MOTT.\r\n     LONDON, _sixth mo., 17, 1840_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   16 PALL MALL, _20th June, 1840_.\r\n\r\n     MADAM:--Taking the liberty of protesting against being supposed\r\n     to adopt any of the complimentary phrases in your letter as being\r\n     applicable to me, I readily comply with your request to give my\r\n     opinion as to the propriety of the admission of the female\r\n     delegates into the Convention.\r\n\r\n     I should premise by avowing that my first impression was strong\r\n     against that admission; and I believe I declared that opinion in\r\n     private conversation. But when I was called on by you to give my\r\n     personal decision on the subject, I felt it my duty to\r\n     investigate the grounds of the opinion I had formed; and upon\r\n     that investigation I easily discovered that it was founded on no\r\n     better grounds than an apprehension of the ridicule it might\r\n     excite if the Convention were to do what is so unusual in\r\n     England--admit women to an equal share and right of the\r\n     discussion. I also without difficulty recognized that this was an\r\n     unworthy, and, indeed, a cowardly motive, and I easily overcame\r\n     its influence.\r\n\r\n     My mature consideration of the entire subject convinces me of the\r\n     right of the female delegates to take their seats in the\r\n     Convention, and of the injustice of excluding them. I do not care\r\n     to add that I deem it also impolitic; because, that exclusion\r\n     being unjust, it ought not to have taken place even if it could\r\n     also be politic. My reasons are:\r\n\r\n     _First._ That as it has been the practice in America for females\r\n     to act as delegates and office-bearers, as well as in common\r\n     capacity of members of Anti-Slavery Societies, the persons who\r\n     called this Convention ought to have warned the American\r\n     Anti-Slavery Societies to confine their choice to males, and for\r\n     want of this caution many female delegates have made long\r\n     journeys by land and crossed the ocean to enjoy a right which\r\n     they had no reason to fear would be withheld from them at the end\r\n     of their tedious voyage.\r\n\r\n     _Secondly._ The cause which is so intimately interwoven with\r\n     every good feeling of humanity and with the highest and most\r\n     sacred principles of Christianity--the Anti-Slavery cause in\r\n     America--is under the greatest, the deepest, the most\r\n     heart-binding obligations to the females who have joined the\r\n     Anti-Slavery Societies in the United States. They have shown a\r\n     passive but permanent courage, which ought to put many of the\r\n     male advocates to the blush. The American ladies have persevered\r\n     in our holy cause amidst difficulties and dangers, with the zeal\r\n     of confessors and the firmness of martyrs; and, therefore,\r\n     emphatically they should not be disparaged or discouraged by any\r\n     slight or contumely offered to their rights. Neither are this\r\n     slight and contumely much diminished by the fact that it was not\r\n     intended to offer any slight or to convey any contumely. Both\r\n     results inevitably follow from the fact of rejection. This OUGHT\r\n     NOT to be.\r\n\r\n     _Thirdly._ Even in England, with all our fastidiousness, women\r\n     vote upon the great regulation of the Bank of England; in the\r\n     nomination of its directors and governors, and in all other\r\n     details equally with men; that is, they assist in the most\r\n     awfully important business--the regulation of the currency of\r\n     this mighty Empire--influencing the fortunes of all commercial\r\n     nations.\r\n\r\n     _Fourthly._ Our women in like manner vote at the India House;\r\n     that is, in the regulation of the government of more than one\r\n     hundred millions of human beings.\r\n\r\n     _Fifthly._ Mind has no sex; and in the peaceable struggle to\r\n     abolish slavery all over the world, it is the basis of the\r\n     present Convention to seek success by peaceable, moral, and\r\n     intellectual means alone, to the utter exclusion of armed\r\n     violence. We are engaged in a strife not of strength, but of\r\n     argument. Our warfare is not military; it is Christian. We wield\r\n     not the weapons of destruction or injury to our adversaries. We\r\n     rely entirely on reason and persuasion common to both sexes, and\r\n     on the emotions of benevolence and charity, which are more lovely\r\n     and permanent amongst women than amongst men.\r\n\r\n     In the Church to which I belong the female sex are devoted by as\r\n     strict rules and with as much, if not more, unceasing austerity\r\n     to the performance (and that to the exclusion of all worldly or\r\n     temporal joys and pleasures) of all works of humanity, of\r\n     education, of benevolence, and of charity, in all its holy and\r\n     sacred branches, as the men. The great work in which we are now\r\n     engaged embraces all these charitable categories; and the women\r\n     have the same duties, and should, therefore, enjoy the same\r\n     rights with men in the performance of their duties.\r\n\r\n     I have a consciousness that I have not done _my_ duty in not\r\n     sooner urging these considerations on the Convention. My excuse\r\n     is that I was unavoidably absent during the discussion on the\r\n     subject.\r\n\r\n     I have the honor to be, very respectfully, madam,\r\n\r\n                            Your obedient servant,\r\n     LUCRETIA MOTT.                          DANIEL O'CONNELL.\r\n\r\nThe following earnest and friendly letter from William Howitt, was\r\nhighly prized by Mrs. Mott:\r\n\r\n                                   LONDON, _June 27, 1840_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR FRIEND:--....I regret that I was prevented from making a\r\n     part of the Convention, as nothing should have hindered me from\r\n     stating there in the plainest terms my opinion of the _real\r\n     grounds_ on which you were rejected. It is a pity that you were\r\n     excluded on the plea of being women; but it is disgusting that\r\n     under that plea you were actually excluded as heretics. That is\r\n     the real ground, and it ought to have been at once proclaimed and\r\n     exposed by the liberal members of the Convention; but I believe\r\n     they were not aware of the fact. I heard of the circumstance of\r\n     your exclusion at a distance, and immediately said: \"Excluded on\r\n     the ground that they are women?\" No, that is not the real cause;\r\n     there is something behind. And what are these female delegates?\r\n     Are they orthodox in religion? The answer was \"No, they are\r\n     considered to be of the Hicksite party of Friends.\" My reply was,\r\n     \"That is enough; _there_ lies the real cause, and there needs no\r\n     other. The influential Friends in the Convention would never for\r\n     a moment tolerate their presence there if they could prevent it.\r\n     They hate them because they have dared to call in question their\r\n     sectarian dogmas and assumed authority; and they have taken care\r\n     to brand them in the eyes of the Calvinistic Dissenters, who form\r\n     another large and influential portion of the Convention, as\r\n     Unitarians; in their eyes the most odious of heretics.\"\r\n\r\n     But what a miserable spectacle is this! The \"World's Convention\"\r\n     converting itself into the fag-end of the Yearly Meeting of the\r\n     Society of Friends! That Convention met from various countries\r\n     and climates to consider how it shall best advance the sacred\r\n     cause of humanity; of the freedom of the race, independent of\r\n     caste or color, immediately falls the victim of bigotry; and one\r\n     of its first acts is to establish a caste of sectarian opinion,\r\n     and to introduce color into the very soul! Had I not seen of late\r\n     years a good deal of the spirit which now rules the Society of\r\n     Friends, my surprise would have been unbounded at seeing _them_\r\n     argue for the exclusion of women from a public assembly, _as\r\n     women_. But nothing which they do now surprises me. They have in\r\n     this case to gratify their wretched spirit of intolerance, at\r\n     once abandoned one of the most noble and most philosophical of\r\n     the established principles of their own Society.\r\n\r\n     That Society claims, and claims justly, to be the first Christian\r\n     party which has recognized the great Christian doctrine that\r\n     THERE IS NO SEX IN SOULS; that male and female are one in Christ\r\n     Jesus. There were Fox and Penn and the first giants of the\r\n     Society who dared in the face of the world's prejudices to place\r\n     woman in her first rank; to recognize and maintain her moral and\r\n     intellectual equality. It was this Society which thus gave to\r\n     woman her inalienable rights, her true liberty; which restored to\r\n     her the exercise of mind, and the capacity to exhibit before her\r\n     assumed ancient lord and master, the highest qualities of the\r\n     human heart and understanding; discretion, sound counsel, sure\r\n     sagacity, mingled with feminine delicacy, and that beautiful\r\n     innate modesty which avails more to restrain its possessor within\r\n     the bounds of prudence and usefulness than all the laws of\r\n     corrupt society. It was this Society which, at once fearless in\r\n     its confidence in woman's goodness and sense of propriety, gave\r\n     its female portion its own meetings of discipline, meetings of\r\n     civil discussion and transaction of actual and various business.\r\n     It was this Society which did more; which permitted its women in\r\n     the face of a great apostolic injunction to stand forth in its\r\n     churches and preach the Gospel. It has, in fact, sent them out\r\n     armed with the authority of its certificates to the very ends of\r\n     the earth to preach in public; to visit and persuade in private.\r\n\r\n     And what has been the consequence? Have the women put their faith\r\n     And philosophy to shame? Have they disgraced themselves or the\r\n     Society which has confided in them? Have they proved by their\r\n     follies, their extravagances, their unwomanly boldness and want\r\n     of a just sense of decorum that these great men were wrong? On\r\n     the contrary, I will venture to say, and I have seen something of\r\n     all classes, that there is not in the whole civilized world a\r\n     body of women to be found of the same numbers, who exhibit more\r\n     modesty of manner and delicacy of mind than the ladies of the\r\n     Society of Friends; and few who equal them in sound sense and\r\n     dignity of character. There can be no question that the\r\n     recognition of the moral and intellectual equality of the most\r\n     lovely and interesting portion of our Society has tended, and\r\n     that very materially, to raise them greatly in value as wives, as\r\n     bosom friends and domestic counselors, whose inestimable worth is\r\n     only discovered in times of trial and perplexity.\r\n\r\n     And here have gone the little men of the present day, and have\r\n     knocked down in the face of the world all that their ancestors,\r\n     in this respect, had built up! If they are at all consistent they\r\n     must carry out their new principle and sweep it through the\r\n     ancient constitution of their own Society. They must at once put\r\n     down meetings of discipline among their women; they must call\r\n     home such as are in distant countries, or are traversing this,\r\n     preaching and visiting families. There must be no appointments of\r\n     women to meet committees of men to deliberate on matters of great\r\n     importance to the Society. But the fact is, my dear friend, that\r\n     bigotry is never consistent except that is always narrow, always\r\n     ungracious, and always under plea of uniting God's people,\r\n     scattering them one from another, and rendering them weak as\r\n     water.\r\n\r\n     I want to know what religious opinions have to do with a \"World's\r\n     Convention.\" Did you meet to settle doctrines, or to conspire\r\n     against slavery? Many an august council has attempted to settle\r\n     doctrines, and in vain; and you had before you a subject so vast,\r\n     so pressing, so momentous, that in presence of its sublimity, any\r\n     petty jealousy and fancied idea of superiority ought to have\r\n     fallen as dust from the boughs of a cedar. You as delegates, had\r\n     to meet this awful fact in the face, and to consider how it\r\n     should be grappled with; how the united power of civilized\r\n     nations should be brought to bear upon it! The fact that after\r\n     nearly a century of gradually growing and accumulating efforts to\r\n     put down slavery and the slave trade, little has been done; that\r\n     there are now more slaves in the world than ever, and that the\r\n     slave trade is far more extensive and monstrous than it was when\r\n     Clarkson raised his voice against its extinction; that is a fact\r\n     which, if the men who now take the lead in warring on the evil\r\n     were truly great men, it would silence in them every other\r\n     feeling than that of its enormity, and the godlike resolve that\r\n     all hands and all hearts should be raised before Heaven and\r\n     united in its spirit to chase this spreading villainy from the\r\n     earth speedily and forever. But men, however benevolent, can not\r\n     be great men if they are bigots. Bigots are like the peasants who\r\n     build their cabins in the mighty palaces of the ancient Cæsars.\r\n     The Cæsars who raised the past fabrics are gone, and the power in\r\n     which they raised them is gone with them. Poor and little men\r\n     raise their huts within those august palace walls, and fancy\r\n     themselves the inhabitants of the palaces themselves. So in the\r\n     mighty fane of Christianity, bigots and sectarians are\r\n     continually rearing their little cabins of sects and parties, and\r\n     would fain persuade us, while they fill their own narrow\r\n     tenements, that they fill the glorious greatness of Christianity\r\n     itself!\r\n\r\n     It is surely high time that after eighteen hundred years of\r\n     Christ's reign we should be prepared to allow each other to hold\r\n     an opinion on the most important of all subjects to ourselves! It\r\n     is surely time that we opened our eyes sufficiently to see what\r\n     is so plain in the Gospel: the sublime difference between the\r\n     Spirit of Christ and the spirit of His disciples when they fain\r\n     would have made a bigot of Him. \"We saw men doing miracles in thy\r\n     name; and we forbade them.\" \"Forbid them not, for they who are\r\n     not against us are for us.\" It is not by _doctrines_ that Christ\r\n     said His disciples should be known, but by their fruits; and by\r\n     the greatest of all fruits--love.\r\n\r\n     You, dear friend, and those noble women to whom I address myself\r\n     when addressing you, have shown in your own country the grand\r\n     Christian testimonial of love to mankind in the highest degree.\r\n     You have put your lives in your hands for the sake of man's\r\n     freedom from caste, color, and mammon; and the greatest disgrace\r\n     that has of late years befallen this country is, that you have\r\n     been refused admittance as delegates to the Convention met\r\n     ostensibly to work that very work for which you have so\r\n     generously labored and freely suffered. The Convention has not\r\n     merely insulted you, but those who sent you. It has testified\r\n     that the men of America are at least far ahead of us in their\r\n     opinion of the discretion and usefulness of women. But above all,\r\n     this act of exclusion has shown how far the Society of Friends is\r\n     fallen from its ancient state of greatness and catholic nobleness\r\n     of spirit.\r\n\r\n     But my time is gone. I have not said one-half, one-tenth,\r\n     one-hundredth part of what I could say to you and to your\r\n     companions on this subject; but of this be assured, time and your\r\n     own delegators will do you justice. The true Christians in all\r\n     ages were the heretics of the time; and this I say not because I\r\n     believe exactly as you do, for in truth I neither know nor desire\r\n     to know exactly how far we think alike. All that I know or want\r\n     to know is, that you have shown the grand mark of Christian\r\n     truth--love to mankind.\r\n\r\n     I have heard the noble Garrison blamed that he had not taken his\r\n     place in the Convention because you and your fellow-delegates\r\n     were excluded. I, on the contrary, honor him for his conduct. In\r\n     mere worldly wisdom he might have entered the Convention and\r\n     there made his protest against the decision; but in at once\r\n     refusing to enter where you, his fellow-delegates, were shut out,\r\n     he has made a far nobler protest; not in the mere Convention, but\r\n     in the world at large. I honor the lofty principle of that true\r\n     champion of humanity, and shall always recollect with delight,\r\n     the day Mary and I spent with you and him.\r\n\r\n     I must apologize for this most hasty and I fear illegible scrawl,\r\n     and with our kind regards and best wishes for your safe return to\r\n     your native country, and for many years of honorable labor there\r\n     for the truth and freedom, I beg to subscribe myself,\r\n\r\n                                   Most sincerely your friend,\r\n                                                   WILLIAM HOWITT.\r\n\r\nHarriet Martineau, who had visited Mrs. Mott when in America, and was\r\nprevented from attending the Convention by illness, wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n     I can not be satisfied without sending you a line of love and\r\n     sympathy. I think much of you amidst your present trials, and\r\n     much indeed have I thought of you and your cause since we parted.\r\n     May God strengthen you. It is a comfort to me that two of my best\r\n     friends, Mrs. Reid and Julia Smith, are there to look upon you\r\n     with eyes of love. I hear of you from them, for busy as they are,\r\n     they remember me from day to day, and make me a partaker of your\r\n     proceedings.... I can not but grieve for you in the\r\n     heart-sickness which you have experienced this last week. We must\r\n     trust that the spirit of Christ will in time enlarge the hearts\r\n     of those who claim his name, that the whites as well as the\r\n     blacks will in time be free.\r\n\r\nAfter the Convention, Mrs. Mott visited Miss Martineau, who was an\r\ninvalid, staying at Tynemouth, for the benefit of sea air. And on her\r\nreturn to London, she received another letter, from which we extract\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n     I felt hardly as if I knew what I was about that morning, but I\r\n     was very happy, and I find that I remember every look and word. I\r\n     did not make all the use I might of the opportunity; but when are\r\n     we ever wise enough to do it? I do not think we shall ever meet\r\n     again in this world, and I believe that was in your mind when you\r\n     said farewell. I feel that I have derived somewhat from my\r\n     intercourse with you that will never die, and I am thankful that\r\n     we have been permitted to meet. You will tell the Furnesses\r\n     (Rev. Wm. H.) where and how you found me. Tell them of my\r\n     cheerful room and fine down and sea. I wish my friends would\r\n     suffer for me no more than I do for myself. I hope you have yet\r\n     many years of activity and enjoyment before you. My heart will\r\n     ever be in your cause and my love with yourself.\r\n\r\nIn James Mott's published volume, \"Three months in Great Britain,\" he\r\nspeaks of many distinguished persons who extended to them most\r\ngracious hospitalities, for although Mrs. Mott had been ostracised by\r\nsome of the more bigoted \"Friends,\" others were correspondingly marked\r\nin their attentions. Among such was that noble-hearted young woman,\r\nElizabeth Pease, of Darlington, who was one of the first to call upon\r\nthem on their arrival in London, and the last to bid them farewell on\r\nthe morning they sailed from Liverpool; having in company with her\r\nfather gone from Manchester for that purpose. Her cultivated mind and\r\nfine talents were devoted to subjects of reform, with an energy and\r\nperseverance rarely equaled.\r\n\r\nAnn Knight, another sincere friend and advocate of human rights, was\r\nquite indignant, that a Convention called for such liberal measures\r\nshould reject women on the flimsy plea, \"that it being contrary to\r\nEnglish usage, it would subject them to ridicule and prejudice their\r\ncause.\" She was unremitting in her attentions to the American women,\r\ndoing many things to make their visit pleasant while in London, and\r\nafterward, entertaining several as guests in her own \"quiet home.\"\r\nAmelia Opie, with her happy face and genial manners, was in constant\r\nattendance at the Convention. On entering one of the sessions, she\r\naccosted Mrs. Mott, saying, \"though in one sense the women delegates\r\nwere rejected, yet they were held in high esteem, and their coming\r\nwould have immense influence on the action of future assemblies.\"\r\n\r\nAt the \"Crown and Anchor,\" one evening, the members of the Convention\r\ntook a parting cup of tea; nearly five hundred persons were present.\r\nAs the resolution excluding women did not extend to this company, Mrs.\r\nMott gave her views on the use of slave products, which were well\r\nreceived. In the course of her remarks she referred to the example and\r\nfaithfulness of the \"Society of Friends,\" in using as far as possible\r\nthe produce of free labor in their families. Josiah Forster, ever\r\nvigilant on the battlements of bigotry, could not allow this allusion\r\nto pass unnoticed, and when Mrs. Mott sat down, he arose and said he\r\n\"could not conscientiously refrain from informing the company, that\r\nMrs. Mott did not represent the Society of Friends. He did so with no\r\nother than feelings of kindness, but,\"--when he had proceeded thus far\r\nit was evident he was about to disclaim religious fellowship with\r\nher, and a general burst of disapprobation was manifested by cries of\r\n\"down, down! order, order! shame, shame!\"--but he finished his\r\ndisavowal amidst the confusion, though few heard what he said, neither\r\ndid they wish to hear his expressions of intolerance. As soon as he\r\nhad finished his speech he left the room, probably displeased that his\r\nfeelings met with so little sympathy, or at the manifestation of\r\ndissatisfaction with his remarks.\r\n\r\nAt a dinner party, at Elizabeth J. Reid's, a few days after, Lady\r\nByron was one of the company; with whom Mr. and Mrs. Mott had a\r\nprevious acquaintance, through a letter of introduction from George\r\nCombe. As Colonel Miller, one of the American delegation, had been in\r\nthe Greek war with Lord Byron, and knew him well, several interesting\r\ninterviews with the wife and daughter grew out of that acquaintance.\r\nThey also visited Dr. Bowring and his interesting family several\r\ntimes, and on one occasion met there Charles Pelham Villiers, the\r\nleading advocate in Parliament for the modification of their corn\r\nlaws. Dr. Bowring was a near neighbor and great admirer of Jeremy\r\nBentham, and entertained them with many anecdotes of his original\r\nfriend. William H. Ashurst, a lawyer of eminence in London, gave them\r\na cordial welcome to his family circle, where they met William and\r\nMary Howitt, and Robert Owen, the philanthropist. Mr. Ashurst took an\r\nactive part in favor of reducing the postage on letters and papers.\r\n\r\nAt Birmingham, they passed a few days with their liberal \"Friend,\"\r\nWilliam Boultbee, and visited several of the great manufacturing\r\nestablishments. Here they made the acquaintance of a Catholic priest,\r\nThomas M. McDonald, a man of broad views and marked liberality. He\r\ntendered Mrs. Mott the use of a large room at his disposal, and urged\r\nher to hold a meeting. At Liverpool, they were the guests of William\r\nRathbone and family. In Dublin, they met James Houghton, Richard\r\nAllen, Richard Webb, and the Huttons, who entertained them most\r\nhospitably and gave them many charming drives in and about the city.\r\nAt Edinburgh, they joined Sarah Pugh and Abby Kimber, who had just\r\nreturned from the Continent, and had a cordial reception at the home\r\nof George Thompson. They passed two days with George Combe, the great\r\nphrenologist, who examined and complimented Mrs. Mott's head, as\r\nindicating a strong symmetrical character. They took tea with his\r\nbrother, Andrew Combe, the author of that admirable work on \"Infancy,\"\r\nwhich has proved a real blessing to many young mothers.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting in Glasgow, to hear George Thompson on the subject of\r\nBritish India, Mrs. Mott asked the chairman for the liberty of\r\naddressing the audience for a few minutes, but was denied, though a\r\ncolored man, Charles Lenox Remond, of Salem, Massachusetts, was\r\nlistened to with attention, as he had been in London and other places,\r\nshowing that the unholy prejudice against color was not so bitter in\r\nEngland as that against sex. George Harris, the minister of the\r\nUnitarian Chapel in Glasgow, cordially extended to Mrs. Mott the use\r\nof his church for a lecture on slavery, which was gladly accepted. The\r\nhouse was crowded, and there was abundant reason to believe the people\r\nwere well pleased. But the small handful of \"Friends\" in that city did\r\nnot suffer so good an opportunity of disclaiming them to pass, and\r\naccordingly had the following communication published in the papers:\r\n\r\n     _To the Editor of the Glasgow Gazette:_\r\n\r\n     RESPECTED FRIEND:--Intimation having been given on the 8th,\r\n     current, by means of placards extensively posted throughout the\r\n     city, that \"On Sabbath first, the 9th instant, Mrs. Lucretia\r\n     Mott, a minister of the Society of Friends, Philadelphia, would\r\n     hold a meeting in the Christian Unitarian Chapel\"; and that the\r\n     meeting was held and numerously attended by our fellow-citizens,\r\n     we deem it right on behalf of the Society of Friends residing in\r\n     Glasgow, to inform the public that we hold no religious\r\n     fellowship with Lueretia Mott, nor with the body in the United\r\n     States called Hicksites, to which she belongs, they not being\r\n     recognized by the Society of Friends in the United Kingdom, nor\r\n     by those \"Friends\" with whom we are in connection in America; and\r\n     that we do not wish to be in any way identified with, or\r\n     considered responsible for any sentiments that Lucretia Mott may\r\n     have uttered at the meeting above referred to.\r\n\r\n                              We are, respectfully, thy friends,\r\n\r\n                    WILLIAM SMEAL, WILLIAM WHITE, JOHN MAXWELL,\r\n                                        JAMES SMEAL, EDWARD WHITE.\r\n\r\n     GLASGOW, _12th of 8th mo., 1840_.\r\n\r\nTo us who knew, loved, and honored Lucretia Mott for her many virtues,\r\nthese manifestations of bigotry, so narrowing and embittering in their\r\neffect on the mind, should be an added warning against that evil\r\nspirit of persecution that has brought such sorrow to mankind. We\r\nsincerely hope these few examples we have endeavored to place in their\r\ntrue light, may awaken thought in the minds of our readers, and\r\nincline them to renewed charity and a wiser appreciation of what is\r\nand what is not vital in religion. Surely life must ever stand for\r\nmore than faith.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[75] In the midst of our first volume the announcement of the death of\r\nLucretia Mott, Nov. 11th, 1880, reached us. As she was identified with\r\nso many of the historical events of Pennsylvania, where nearly seventy\r\nyears of her life were passed, it is fitting that this sketch should\r\nfollow the State in which she resided for so long a period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nNEW JERSEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1682, William Penn purchased Eastern Jersey, and under a Governor\r\nof his choosing, Robert Barclay, the colony became a refuge for the\r\npersecuted \"Friends.\" It was no doubt due to the peaceful measures of\r\nWilliam Penn in his dealings with the Indians, that this colony was\r\nfree from all troubles with them. The last loyal Governor of New\r\nJersey--1763--was William Franklin, a natural son of Benjamin\r\nFranklin, and a bitter Tory.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for independence was at this time interesting and\r\nexciting, and behind the Governor was a strong party for\r\nreconciliation with Great Britain. Besides the Governor's instructions\r\nagainst independence, the Assembly had resolved on a separate petition\r\nto the King.\r\n\r\nAware of this feeling in New Jersey, Congress sent that illustrious\r\ntrio, John Dickinson, John Jay, and George Wythe, to procure a\r\nreversal of their determination. They were courteously received on the\r\nfloor, and urged in their addresses that nothing but unity and bravery\r\nin the Colonies would bring Great Britain to terms; that she wanted to\r\nprocure separate petitions, but that such a course would break the\r\nunion, when the Colonies would be like a rope of sand. The Assembly\r\nyielded to their entreaties, and on the 25th of June, 1776, Governor\r\nFranklin, who opposed the action of Congress, was deposed,[76] and\r\nWilliam Livingston, a true patriot, was elected Governor, and\r\nre-elected for fourteen years.\r\n\r\nThe intense excitement of this period in New Jersey roused many women\r\nloyal to freedom and the independence of the Colonies to persistent\r\naction. Among these was Hannah Arnett, of Elizabethtown, whose story\r\nwas first made public one hundred years after the date of its\r\noccurrence.[77] The latter part of the year 1776 was a period of doubt\r\nand despondency to the patriot troops. Although the Colonies had\r\ndeclared their independence several months before, the American forces\r\nhad since suffered many severe defeats, and it seemed not unlikely\r\nthat Great Britain would be victorious in her struggle with the\r\nnew-born republic. On the 30th of November, Gen. Howe had issued his\r\ncelebrated proclamation offering amnesty and protection to all who,\r\nwithin sixty days, should declare themselves peaceable British\r\nsubjects, and bind themselves to neither take up arms nor encourage\r\nothers to do so.\r\n\r\nAfter his victory at Fort Lee, Lord Cornwallis marched his army to New\r\nJersey, encamping at Elizabethtown. His presence on New Jersey soil so\r\nsoon after Gen. Howe's proclamation, and the many defeats of the\r\npatriot army, had a very depressing effect. Of this period Dr. Ashbel\r\nGreen wrote: \"I heard a man of some shrewdness once say, that when the\r\nBritish troops overran the State of New Jersey, in the closing part of\r\nthe year 1776, the whole population could have been bought for\r\neighteen pence a head.\"\r\n\r\nBut however true this statement may have been of the men of New\r\nJersey, it could not be justly made in regard to its women, one of\r\nwhom, at least, did much to stem the tide of panic so strong at this\r\npoint where Cornwallis was encamped. A number of men of Elizabeth\r\nassembled one evening in one of the spacious mansions for which this\r\nplace was rather famous, to discuss the advisability of accepting the\r\nproposed amnesty. The question was a momentous one, and the discussion\r\nwas earnest and protracted. Some were for accepting this proffer at\r\nonce; others hesitated; they canvassed the subject from various\r\npoints, but finally decided that submission was all that remained to\r\nthem. Their hope was gone, and their courage with it; every remnant of\r\npatriotic spirit seemed swept away in the darkness of the hour. But\r\nthere was a listener of whom they were ignorant; a woman, Hannah\r\nArnett, the wife of the host, sitting at her work in an adjoining\r\nroom. The discussion had reached her ears, rousing her intense\r\nindignation. She listened until she could sit still no longer;\r\nspringing to her feet she pushed open the parlor door, confronting the\r\namazed men. The writer from whom we glean these facts, says: \"Can you\r\nfancy the scene? A large, low room, with the dark, heavy furniture of\r\nthe period, dimly lighted by the tall wax candles and the wood fire\r\nwhich blazed on the hearth. Around the table the group of men, pallid,\r\ngloomy, dejected, disheartened. In the door-way the figure of the\r\nwoman in in antique costume, with which in these Centennial days we\r\nhave become so familiar. Can you not fancy the proud poise of her\r\nhead, the indignant light of her blue eyes, the crisp, clear tones of\r\nher voice, the majesty, and defiance, and scorn, which clothed her as\r\nwith a garment?\"\r\n\r\nThe men were appalled and started at the sight. She seemed like some\r\navenging angel about to bring them to judgment for the words they had\r\nspoken; and, indeed, such she proved. It was strange to see a woman\r\nthus enter the secret councils of men, and her husband hastily\r\napproaching her, whispered: \"Hannah, Hannah, this is no place for you,\r\nwe do not want you here just now;\" and he tried to take her hand to\r\nlead her from the room. But she pushed him gently back, saying to the\r\nstartled group: \"Have you made your decision, gentlemen? Have you\r\nchosen the part of men, or traitors?\"\r\n\r\nThey stammered and blundered as they tried to find answer. Things\r\nappeared to them in a new light as this woman so pointedly questioned\r\nthem. Their answers were a mixture of excuses and explanations. They\r\ndeclared the country to be in a hopeless condition; the army starving,\r\nhalf-clothed, undisciplined, the country poor, while England's trained\r\ntroops were backed by the wealth of a thousand years.\r\n\r\nHannah Arnett listened in silence until the last abject word was\r\nspoken, when she rapidly inquired: \"But what if we should live after\r\nall?\" The men looked at each other, but not word was spoken. \"Hannah,\r\nHannah,\" cried her husband, \"do you not see these are no questions for\r\nyou? We are discussing what is best for us all. Women do not\r\nunderstand these things; go to your spinning-wheel and leave us to\r\ndiscuss these topics. Do you not see that you are making yourself\r\nridiculous?\"\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Arnett paid no heed. Speaking to the men in a strangely\r\nquiet, voice, she said: \"Can you not tell me? If, after all, God does\r\nnot let the right perish; if America should win in the conflict, after\r\nyou have thrown yourselves upon British clemency, where will you be\r\nthen?\" \"Then?\" spoke a hesitating voice, \"why then, if it ever could\r\nbe so, we should be ruined. We must then leave home and country\r\nforever. But the struggle is an entirely hopeless one. We have no men,\r\nno money, no arms, no food, and England has everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Arnett, \"you have forgotten one thing which England\r\nhas not, and which we have--one thing which outweighs all England's\r\ntreasures, and that is the right. God is on our side; and every volley\r\nfrom our muskets is an echo of His voice. We are poor and weak and\r\nfew, but God is fighting for us. We counted the cost before we began;\r\nwe knew the price and were willing to pay; and now, because for the\r\ntime the day is going against us, you would give up all and sneak back\r\nlike cravens, to kiss the feet that have trampled upon us! And you\r\ncall yourselves men; the sons of those who gave up homes and fortune\r\nand fatherland to make for themselves and for dear liberty a\r\nresting-place in the wilderness! Oh, shame upon you, cowards!\"\r\n\r\nThe words had rushed out in a fiery flood which her husband had vainly\r\nstriven to check. Turning to the gentlemen present, Mr. Arnett said:\r\n\"I beg you will excuse this most unseemly interruption to our council.\r\nMy wife is beside herself, I think. You all know her, and that it is\r\nnot her custom to meddle with politics. To-morrow she will see her\r\nfolly; but now I beg your patience.\"\r\n\r\nBut her words had roused the slumbering manhood of her hearers. Each\r\nbegan to look upon himself as a craven, and to withdraw from the\r\nposition he had taken. No one replied to her husband, and Mrs. Arnett\r\ncontinued. \"Take your protection if you will. Proclaim yourselves\r\ntraitors and cowards, false to your country and your God, but horrible\r\nwill be the judgment upon your heads and the heads of those that love\r\nyou. I tell you that England will never conquer. I know it and feel it\r\nin every fiber of my heart. Has God led us thus far to desert us now?\r\nWill He who led our fathers across the stormy winter seas forsake\r\ntheir children who have put their trust in Him? For me, I stay with my\r\ncountry, and my hand shall never touch the hand, nor my heart cleave\r\nto the heart of him who shames her\"; and she turned a glance upon her\r\nhusband; \"Isaac, we have lived together for twenty years, and for all\r\nof them I have been a true and loving wife to you. But I am the child\r\nof God and of my Country, and if you do this shameful thing, I will\r\nnever again own you for my husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear wife!\" he cried, aghast, \"you do not know what you are\r\nsaying. Leave me for such a thing as this?\" \"For such a thing as\r\nthis!\" she cried, scornfully. \"What greater cause could there be? I\r\nmarried a good man and true, a faithful friend, and it needs no\r\ndivorce to sever me from a traitor and a coward. If you take your\r\namnesty you lose your wife, and I--I lose my husband and my home!\"\r\n\r\nWith the last words her voice broke into a pathetic fall, and a mist\r\ngathered before her eyes. The men were deeply moved; the words of Mrs.\r\nArnett had touched every soul. Gradually the drooping heads were\r\nraised, and eyes grew bright with manliness and resolution. Before\r\nthey left the house that night they had sworn a solemn oath to stand\r\nby the cause they had adopted, and the land of their birth through\r\ngood or evil, and to spurn as deadliest insult the proffered amnesty\r\nof their tyrannical foe.\r\n\r\nSome of the men who met in this secret council afterward fought nobly,\r\nand died upon the field of battle for their country. Others lived to\r\nrejoice when the day of triumph came; but the name of this woman was\r\nfound upon no heroic roll, nor is it on the page of any history that\r\nmen have since written, although she made heroes of cowards, and\r\nhelped to stay the wave of desolation which, in the dark days of '76,\r\nthreatened to overwhelm the land.\r\n\r\nAt one time some British officers quartered themselves at the house of\r\nMrs. Dissosway, situated at the western end of Staten Island, opposite\r\nAmboy. Her husband was a prisoner; but her brother, Captain Nat.\r\nRandolph, was in the American army, and gave much annoyance to the\r\ntories by his frequent incursions. A tory colonel promised Mrs.\r\nDissosway to procure the release of her husband on condition of her\r\nprevailing on her brother to stay quietly at home. \"And if I could,\"\r\nshe replied, with a look of scorn, drawing up her tall figure to its\r\nutmost height, \"if I could act so dastardly a part, think you General\r\nWashington has but one Captain Randolph in his army?\"\r\n\r\nAt a period when American prospects were most clouded, and New Jersey\r\noverrun by the British, an officer stationed at Borden-town (said to\r\nbe Lord Cornwallis) endeavored to intimidate Mrs. Borden into using\r\nher influence over her husband and son, who were absent in the\r\nAmerican army. The officer promised her that if she would induce them\r\nto quit the standard they followed and join the royalists, her\r\nproperty should be protected; while in case of refusal, her estate\r\nwould be ravaged and her elegant mansion destroyed. Mrs. Borden\r\nanswered, \"Begin your threatened havoc then; the sight of my house in\r\nflames would be a treat to me; for I have seen enough to know that you\r\nnever injure what you have power to keep and enjoy. The application of\r\na torch to my dwelling I should regard as a signal for your\r\ndeparture.\" The house was burned in fulfillment of the threat, and the\r\nestate laid waste; but, as Mrs. Borden predicted, the retreat of the\r\nspoiler quickly followed.\r\n\r\nDuring the battle of Monmouth a gunner named Pitcher was killed, and\r\nthe call was made for some one to take his place; his wife, who had\r\nfollowed him to the camp and thence to the field of conflict,\r\nunhesitatingly stepped forward and offered her services. The gun was\r\nso well managed as to draw the attention of General Washington to the\r\ncircumstance, and to call forth an expression of his admiration of her\r\nbravery and fidelity to her country. To show his appreciation of her\r\nvirtues and her highly valuable services, he conferred on her a\r\nlieutenant's commission. She afterward went by the name of \"Captain\r\nMolly.\"\r\n\r\nAs early as 1706, Thomas Chalkley, visiting the Conestogae Indians,\r\nnear Susquehannah, says: \"We treated about having a meeting with them\r\nin a religious way, upon which they called a council, in which they\r\nwere very grave, and spoke one after another without any heat or\r\njarring (and some of the most esteemed of their women do sometimes\r\nspeak in their councils). I asked our interpreter why they suffered or\r\npermitted the women to speak; he answered: 'Some women are wiser than\r\nsome men.' Our interpreter told me that they had not done anything for\r\nmany years without the counsel of an ancient, grave woman, who, I\r\nobserved, spoke much in their councils, for I was permitted to be\r\npresent, and asked what she said. He replied that she was an empress,\r\nand that they gave much heed to what she said amongst them; that she\r\nthen said to them that she looked upon our coming to be more than\r\nnatural, because we did not come to buy nor sell nor get gain, but\r\ncame in love and respect to them, and desired their well doing both\r\nhere and hereafter; and that our meeting among them might be very\r\nbeneficial to their young people. She related a dream she had three\r\ndays before, and interpreted it, advising them to hear us and\r\nentertain us kindly, etc., which they did.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Green, in behalf of Miss Leake, of Trenton, presented to\r\nthe New Jersey Historical Society copies of the correspondence between\r\nColonel Mawhood of the British forces, and Colonel Hand of the\r\nAmerican army, proposing to the latter to surrender, and each man to\r\ngo to his home, etc., dated Salem County, March, 1778. The New Jersey\r\nHistorical Society has a photographic copy of a print, contemporary\r\nwith the event, representing the triumphal arch erected by the ladies\r\nof Trenton in honor of Washington, on his passage through the place\r\nin April, 1779, and a photographic copy of the following original note\r\n(now in possession of the lady who received it), which was written by\r\nWashington at the time:\r\n\r\n     General Washington can not leave this place without expressing\r\n     his acknowledgements to the Matrons and Young Ladies who received\r\n     him in so novel and grateful a manner at the Triumphal Arch in\r\n     Trenton, for the exquisite sensations he experienced in that\r\n     affecting scene. The astonishing contrast between his former and\r\n     actual situation at the same spot, the elegant taste with which\r\n     it was adorned for the present occasion, and the innocent\r\n     appearance of the _white-robed choir_, who met him with the\r\n     gratulatory song, have made such an impression on his remembrance\r\n     as he assures them will never be effaced.\r\n\r\n     TRENTON, _April 21, 1789_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN, PRACTICE, AND PROHIBITION OF FEMALE SUFFRAGE IN NEW\r\nJERSEY.\r\n\r\nWilliam A. Whitehead, Corresponding Secretary of the New Jersey\r\nHistorical Society, read the following paper at their annual meeting,\r\nJanuary 21, 1858:\r\n\r\n     By the Proprietary laws, the right of suffrage in New Jersey was\r\n     expressly to the _free men_ of the province; and in equally\r\n     explicit terms a law passed in 1709 prescribing the\r\n     qualifications of electors, confined the privilege to male\r\n     freeholders having one hundred acres of land in their own right,\r\n     or worth fifty pounds, current money of the province, in real and\r\n     personal estate, and during the whole of the colonial period\r\n     these qualifications remained unaltered.\r\n\r\n     By the Constitution adopted July 2, 1776, the elective franchise\r\n     was conferred upon all inhabitants of this colony, of full age,\r\n     who are worth fifty pounds, proclamation money, clear estate in\r\n     the same, and have resided within the county in which they claim\r\n     a vote for twelve months immediately preceding the election; and\r\n     the same, or similar language, was used in the different acts\r\n     regulating elections until 1790; but I have not discovered any\r\n     instance of the exercise of the right by females, under an\r\n     interpretation which the full import of the words, \"all\r\n     inhabitants,\" was subsequently thought to sanction, during the\r\n     whole of this period.\r\n\r\n     In 1790, however, a revision of the election law then in force\r\n     was proposed, and upon the committee of the Legislature to whom\r\n     the subject was referred was Mr. Joseph Cooper, of West Jersey, a\r\n     prominent member of the Society of Friends. As the regulations of\r\n     that society authorized females to vote in matters relating\r\n     thereto, Mr. Cooper claimed for them the like privilege in\r\n     matters connected with the State, and to support his views,\r\n     quoted the provisions of the Constitution as sanctioning such a\r\n     course. It was therefore to satisfy him that the committee\r\n     consented to report a bill in which the expression, \"he or she,\"\r\n     applied to the voter, was introduced into the section specifying\r\n     the necessary qualifications; thus giving a legislative\r\n     endorsement of the alleged meaning of the Constitution. Still,\r\n     no cases of females voting by virtue of this more definite\r\n     provision are on record, and we are warranted in believing that\r\n     the women of New Jersey then, as now, were not apt to overstep\r\n     the bounds of decorum, or intrude where their characteristic\r\n     modesty and self-respect might be wounded.\r\n\r\n     This law and its supplements were repealed in 1797, and it is\r\n     some proof that the peculiar provision under review had not been\r\n     availed of to any extent, if at all (as its evil consequences\r\n     would otherwise have become apparent), that we find similar\r\n     phraseology introduced into the new act. The right of suffrage\r\n     was conferred upon \"all free inhabitants of this State of full\r\n     age,\" etc., thus adopting the language of the Constitution with\r\n     the addition of the word \"free,\" and \"no person shall be entitled\r\n     to vote in any other township or precinct than that in which he\r\n     or she doth actually reside,\" etc., and in two other places is\r\n     the possible difference in the sex of the voters recognized.\r\n\r\n     The first occasion on which females voted, of which any precise\r\n     information has been obtained, was at an election held this year\r\n     (1797) at Elizabethtown, Essex County, for members of the\r\n     Legislature. The candidates between whom the greatest rivalry\r\n     existed, were John Condit and William Crane, the heads of what\r\n     were known a year or two later as the \"Federal Republican\" and\r\n     \"Federal Aristocratic\" parties, the former the candidate of\r\n     Newark and the northern portions of the county, and the latter\r\n     the candidate of Elizabethtown and the adjoining country, for the\r\n     Council. Under the impression that the candidates would poll\r\n     nearly the same number of votes, the Elizabethtown leaders\r\n     thought that by a bold _coup d'état_ they might secure the\r\n     success of Mr. Crane. At a late hour of the day, and, as I have\r\n     been informed, just before the close of the poll, a number of\r\n     females were brought up, and under the provisions of the existing\r\n     laws, allowed to vote; but the manoeuvre was unsuccessful, the\r\n     majority for Mr. Condit, in the county, being ninety-three,\r\n     notwithstanding. These proceedings were made the topic of two or\r\n     three brief articles in the _Newark Sentinel_, in one of which\r\n     the fact that \"no less than seventy-five women were polled at the\r\n     late election in a neighboring borough,\" was used as a pretended\r\n     argument for the admission of females to office, and to service\r\n     in the diplomatic corps; while another ironically asserts that\r\n     \"too much credit can not be given to the Federal leaders of\r\n     Elizabethtown for the heroic virtue displayed in advancing in a\r\n     body to the poll to support their favorite candidates.\"\r\n\r\n     So discreditable was this occurrence thought, that although\r\n     another closely contested election took place the following year,\r\n     we do not find any other than male votes deposited then, in Essex\r\n     County, or elsewhere, until the Presidential election of 1800,\r\n     between Mr. Adams and Mr. Jefferson, at which females voted very\r\n     generally throughout the State; and such continued to be the\r\n     practice until the passage of the act positively excluding them\r\n     from the polls. At first the law had been so construed as to\r\n     admit single women only, but as the practice extended, the\r\n     construction of the privilege became broader and was made to\r\n     include females eighteen years old, married or single; and even\r\n     women of color. At a contested election in Hunterdon County, in\r\n     1802, the votes of two or three such, actually electing a member\r\n     of the Legislature. It is remarkable that these proceedings did\r\n     not sooner bring about a repeal of the laws which were thought to\r\n     sanction them; but that event did not occur until 1807, and it is\r\n     noticeable that, as the practice originated in Essex County, so\r\n     the flagrant abuses which resulted from it reached their maximum\r\n     in that county, and brought about its prohibition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANTOINETTE L. BROWN (with autograph).]\r\n\r\n     The circumstances attendant upon this event afford abundant\r\n     matter for a most interesting chapter of local history, which I\r\n     am happy to say has been written by a member of the Society (Mr.\r\n     James Ross),[78] and will be communicated before long, I trust,\r\n     for insertion in our Proceedings. But the scope of this paper\r\n     merely calls for a statement of facts. These are as follows:\r\n\r\n     In the year 1806 a new Court House and Jail were to be erected in\r\n     the county of Essex. Strenuous exertions were made to have them\r\n     located elsewhere than at Newark, which had been the county town\r\n     from a very early period. Sufficient influence was brought to\r\n     bear upon the Legislature to secure the passage of an act\r\n     (approved November 5th of that year) authorizing a special\r\n     election, at which \"the inhabitants\" of the county, \"qualified to\r\n     vote in elections for members of the State Legislature,\" etc.,\r\n     were described as the qualified electors to determine by their\r\n     votes where the buildings should be located. The contest caused a\r\n     great excitement throughout the county, and, under the existing\r\n     laws, when the election was held in February, 1807, women of\r\n     \"full age,\" whether single or married, possessing the required\r\n     property qualification, were permitted by the judges of election\r\n     to vote. But as the conflict proceeded, and the blood of the\r\n     combatants waxed warmer, the number of female voters increased,\r\n     and it was soon found that every single and every married woman\r\n     in the county was not only of \"full age,\" but also \"worth fifty\r\n     pounds proclamation money, clear estate,\" and as such entitled to\r\n     vote if they chose. And not only once, but as often as by change\r\n     of dress or complicity of the inspectors, they might be able to\r\n     repeat the process.\r\n\r\n     This was not confined to any one precinct, but was more or less\r\n     the case in all, and so apparent were these and many other frauds\r\n     that the Legislature at the ensuing session did not hesitate to\r\n     sat it aside as having been illegally conducted; and, by\r\n     repealing the act authorizing it, left the buildings to be\r\n     erected in Newark, to which they legitimately belonged. And, in\r\n     order that no future occurrence of the kind should take place, an\r\n     act was passed (approved November 16, 1807), the preamble to\r\n     which is as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas, doubts have been raised and great diversities in\r\n     practice obtained throughout the State in regard to the admission\r\n     of aliens, females, and persons of color or negroes to vote in\r\n     elections, as also in regard to the mode of ascertaining the\r\n     qualifications of voters in respect to estate; and whereas, it is\r\n     highly necessary to the safety, quiet good order and dignity of\r\n     the State to clear up the said doubts by an act of the\r\n     representatives of the people declaratory of the true sense and\r\n     meaning of the Constitution, and to ensure its just execution in\r\n     these particulars according to the intent of the framers thereof:\r\n     Therefore,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\n     This act confined the right of suffrage to free white male\r\n     citizens twenty-one years of age, worth fifty pounds proclamation\r\n     money, clear estate; and disposed of the property qualification\r\n     by declaring that every person otherwise entitled to vote whose\r\n     name should be enrolled on the last tax-lists for the State or\r\n     County should be considered as worth the fifty pounds, thus by\r\n     legislative enactment determining the meaning of the Constitution\r\n     and settling the difficulty. The law remained unchanged until the\r\n     adoption of the new Constitution a few years since, which\r\n     instrument is equally restrictive as to persons who shall vote,\r\n     and removes the property qualification altogether.\r\n\r\n     Very recently a refusal to respond to a demand for taxes legally\r\n     imposed, was received from a distinguished advocate of \"Woman's\r\n     Rights\" in one of the northern counties; who gave as her reasons\r\n     \"that women suffer taxation, and yet have no representation,\r\n     which is not only unjust to one-half of the adult population, but\r\n     is contrary to our Theory of Government\"--and that when the\r\n     attention of men is called to the wide difference between their\r\n     theory of government and its practice in this particular, that\r\n     they can not fail to see the mistake they now make, by imposing\r\n     taxes on women when they refuse them the right of suffrage.[79]\r\n\r\n     Similar arguments were advanced by a sister of Richard Henry Lee,\r\n     in 1778,[80] when, if ever, they were calculated to receive due\r\n     consideration, yet the distinguished Virginian did not hesitate\r\n     to show the unreasonableness of the demand; in the course of his\r\n     able answer remarking that (setting aside other motive for\r\n     restricting the power to males) \"perhaps 'twas thought rather out\r\n     of character for women to press into those tumultuous assemblages\r\n     of men where the business of choosing representatives is\r\n     conducted!\" And as it is very evident that when in times past the\r\n     right was, not only claimed, but exercised in New Jersey, it\r\n     never accorded with public sentiment; so it maybe safely\r\n     predicted that, as was the case in 1807, \"the safety, quiet,\r\n     good order, and dignity of the State,\" will ever call for its\r\n     explicit disavowal in times to come.\r\n\r\nIn his speech at the Woman's Rights Convention, 1853, in New York,\r\nRev. John Pierpont said: \"I can go back forty years; and forty years\r\nago, when most of my present audience were not in, but behind, their\r\ncradles, passing a stranger, through the neighboring State of New\r\nJersey, and stopping for dinner at an inn, where the coach stopped, I\r\nsaw at the bar where I went to pay, a list of the voters of the town\r\nstuck up. My eye ran over it, and I read to my astonishment the names\r\nof several women. 'What!' I said, 'do women vote here?' 'Certainly,'\r\nwas the answer, 'when they have real estate.' Then the question arose\r\nin my mind, why should not women vote: Laws are made regulating the\r\ntenure of real estate, and the essence of all republicanism is, that\r\nthey who feel the pressure of the law should have a voice in its\r\nenactment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFECTS IN THE CONSTITUTION OF NEW JERSEY.\r\n\r\nIn a very singular pamphlet published in Trenton, 1779, called\r\n\"Eumenes: A collection of papers on the Errors and Omissions of the\r\nConstitution of New Jersey,\" the writer is very severe upon the fact\r\nthat women were allowed to exercise the same right as the sterner sex;\r\nobserving that \"Nothing can be a greater mockery of this inalienable\r\nright, than to suffer it to be exercised by persons who do not pretend\r\nany judgment on the subject.\"[81]\r\n\r\nExtract from \"Eumenes,\" page 31, No. 8: \"Defects of the Constitution\r\nrespecting the Qualification of Electors and Elected\":\r\n\r\n     It will not be denied that a Constitution ought to point out what\r\n     persons may elect and who may be elected; and that it should as\r\n     distinctly prescribe their several qualifications, and render\r\n     those qualifications conformable to justice and the public\r\n     welfare. Indeed, on the proper adjustment of the elective\r\n     franchise depends, in a great measure, the liberty of the citizen\r\n     and the safety of the Government. Upon examination it will be\r\n     found that the Constitution requires amendment upon this head in\r\n     several particulars.\r\n\r\n     It has ever been a matter of dispute upon the Constitution,\r\n     whether females, as well as males, are entitled to elect officers\r\n     of Government. If we were to be guided by the letter of the\r\n     charter, it would seem to place them on the same footing in this\r\n     particular; and yet, recurring to _political right_ and the\r\n     nature of things, a very forcible construction has been raised\r\n     against the admission of _women_ to participate in the public\r\n     suffrage.\r\n\r\n     The 4th Article of the Constitution declares that \"_all the\r\n     inhabitants_ of this colony of full age who are worth fifty\r\n     pounds, shall be entitled to vote for representatives.\"\r\n\r\n     Those who support the rights of women say, that \"all inhabitants\"\r\n     must mean \"_all women_\" inhabitants as well as \"_all men_.\"\r\n     Whereas, it is urged on the other side that the makers must have\r\n     meant \"all _male_ inhabitants,\" and that the expression is to be\r\n     restrained so as to arrive at the _intent_ of the framers of the\r\n     instrument.\r\n\r\n     This difference of sentiment has given rise to diversity of\r\n     _practice_ on this head, and furnished a pretence from which many\r\n     an electioneering trick has resulted. I could refer to instances\r\n     which would prove what is advanced, but the people want no\r\n     proofs. It is well known that women are admitted or rejected,\r\n     just as may suit the views of the persons in direction. The thing\r\n     should be rectified. If women are fit persons to take part in\r\n     this important franchise, though excluded from other public\r\n     functions, it should be expressed in the Constitution. They would\r\n     then know their rights, and those rights could not be sported\r\n     with to serve the wretched purposes of a party election.\r\n\r\n     To my mind, without going into an historical or philosophical\r\n     deduction of particulars on the subject, it is evident that\r\n     women, generally, are neither by nature, nor habit, nor\r\n     education, nor by their necessary condition in society, fitted to\r\n     perform this duty with credit to themselves or advantage to the\r\n     public. In a note the author adds: It is perfectly disgusting to\r\n     witness the manner in which women are polled at our elections.\r\n     Nothing can be greater mockery of this invaluable and sacred\r\n     right, than to suffer it to be exercised by persons who do not\r\n     even pretend to any judgment on the subject. The great practical\r\n     mischief, however, resulting from their admission under our\r\n     present form of government, is that the towns and populous\r\n     villages gain an unfair advantage over the country, by the\r\n     greater facility they enjoy over the latter in drawing out their\r\n     women to the elections. Many important election contests have\r\n     been terminated at last by these auxiliaries in favor of\r\n     candidates supported by town interests.\r\n\r\n     I believe that the Convention which framed the Constitution had\r\n     no view to the admission of females, either single women or\r\n     widows, to elect the public officers. But such is the phraseology\r\n     of the Constitution that it seems a violation of it not to admit\r\n     their votes. The best constitutions have guarded against mistakes\r\n     on this head. Those of Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania,\r\n     Maryland, Vermont, etc., do not admit of female electors. Whether\r\n     this be right or wrong, the objection to our Constitution is,\r\n     that it does not settle the point one way or the other with an\r\n     absolute certainty. The practice is variable. The generally\r\n     received opinion, however, is that the Constitution permits it.\r\n     In this state of the matter it is not competent for the\r\n     Legislature to interfere. Nothing short of a constitutional\r\n     declaration can decide the question; which is, in fact, an\r\n     important one, and is growing more and more so to the country in\r\n     proportion as the towns and villages increase in numbers and\r\n     population. For, independent of the theoretic question, it is\r\n     evident that the admission of these votes gives a vast advantage\r\n     to the thickly settled places over the more dispersed population\r\n     of the country.\r\n\r\n     In another note the author says: \"Mr. Fox in his late harangue in\r\n     the British House of Commons, in favor of more _equal_ suffrage,\r\n     concedes the unfitness of _females_ to share in elections. He\r\n     says no instance of their participation of public suffrage in any\r\n     government can be shown; and that this right (which many of his\r\n     party hold to be a natural one, though he affects to stop short\r\n     of that) is properly denied to the fairest productions of nature.\r\n     Of widows and spinsters above twenty-one, there can not, I\r\n     imagine, be fewer than 10,000. It is certainly not unimportant to\r\n     leave doubtful the rights of so great a number of people.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Whitehead's report clearly shows three unjust inferences from the\r\nfacts stated:\r\n\r\n_First._ That all the corruptions of that special election in Essex\r\nCounty could be traced to the women.\r\n\r\n_Second._ That the quiet, good order, and dignity of the State could\r\nbe secured only by the restriction of the suffrage to \"free white male\r\ncitizens worth fifty pounds.\"\r\n\r\n_Third._ \"The unreasonableness of the demand\" for representation by\r\nwomen tax-payers.\r\n\r\n1st. Tradition shows that the voting early and often in varied\r\nfeminine costume, was done by men five feet four, \"picked men,\" not\r\nfor their bravery, but for their inferiority. Depriving women of their\r\nright to vote, because the men abused their privilege, under cover of\r\nsex, in 1807, was, however, on the same principle that politicians in\r\n1881 propose to disfranchise the women of Utah, because of their\r\npolygamous relations. That is, punish the women who claim a right to\r\nonly one-sixth part of a man's time and affections, because the men\r\nclaim six wives apiece. The question naturally suggests itself to any\r\nfair mind, why not deprive the men of the suffrage, and let the women\r\nvote themselves each one husband? Who doubts the fate of the system\r\nunder such legislation? Every woman in her normal condition, unless\r\nwholly perverted by the religious dogma of self-sacrifice and\r\nself-crucifixion, desires to own the man she loves as absolutely and\r\ncompletely, as every man desires to consecrate to himself alone the\r\nwoman he loves. So to deprive the women of Essex of their right to\r\nvote to have the county buildings in Elizabeth, because of the undue\r\nexcitement and dishonesty of the men, was to punish the best class of\r\ncitizens for the crimes of the worst.\r\n\r\n2d. The assumption that \"free white male citizens worth fifty pounds,\"\r\ncould legislate for \"aliens, women, and negroes,\" better than those\r\nclasses could for themselves, is to deny the fundamental principle of\r\nrepublicanism; Governments derive their just powers from the consent\r\nof the governed; and to reassert the despotic ideas of the old world\r\nthat national safety depends on the wisdom of privileged\r\norders--nobles, kings, and czars. The experiment in Wyoming has fully\r\nproved that when \"free white male citizens\" reigned supreme, the polls\r\nthere were scenes of drunkenness, violence, and death; men knocking\r\neach other down and putting bullets through each other's brains were\r\nof annual occurrence. But when the suffrage was extended, and women\r\nadmitted to the polling booths, quiet, good order, and dignity were\r\ninaugurated.\r\n\r\n3d. \"Taxation without representation is tyranny.\" James Otis said: \"To\r\ntax a man's property without his consent, is in effect disfranchising\r\nhim of every civil right. For what one civil right is worth a rush,\r\nafter a man's property is subject to be taken from him at the pleasure\r\nof another?\" Is not such injustice as grievous to woman as man? Does\r\nthe accident of sex place woman outside of all ordinary principles of\r\nlaw and justice? It is the essence of cruelty and tyranny to take her\r\nhard earnings without her consent, blocked as her way is to wealth and\r\nindependence, to make sidewalks, highways, and bridges; to build\r\njails, prisons, and alms-houses, the legitimate outgrowth of the\r\nwhisky traffic, which she abhors. On what principle of republican\r\ngovernment is one class of tax-payers thus defrauded of one of the\r\nmost sacred rights of citizenship? What logical argument can be made\r\nto prove \"the unreasonableness of this demand,\" for one class above\r\nall others? Principles of justice, to have any value or significance,\r\nmust be universal in their application to all humanity.\r\n\r\n4th. As to the point made by \"Eumenes,\" \"that women are not fit\r\npersons to take part in government,\" \"that they do not even pretend to\r\nany judgment on the subject,\" we have simply to say that the writer's\r\nprejudices contradict all the facts of our common experience. Women\r\nare so pre-eminently fitted for government, that the one fear in all\r\nages among men has been lest by some chance they should be governed by\r\nwomen; and the smaller the man the greater the fear.\r\n\r\nBlackstone says \"the elements of sovereignty are three: 'Wisdom,\r\nGoodness, and Power.'\" Admitting for the sake of argument that \"Power\"\r\nin this connection means physical force, the distinctive point of male\r\nsuperiority, and not moral power, which may be equal in both sexes,\r\nall must concede the remaining necessary elements to woman as well as\r\nman. Who so bold, or blind, as to deny wisdom and goodness, the chief\r\nelements of beneficent government, to woman, with the long record of\r\nillustrious and saintly characters gilding every page of history\r\nbefore him?\r\n\r\nWhatever doubts the women known to the author of \"Eumenes\" might have\r\nhad as to their own capacities; the women of to-day do assume to know\r\nthat they are more capable of self-government than men are, and that\r\nthey understand the principles that underlie a republic far better\r\nthan the vast majority of foreigners now crowding our shores, the\r\nRight Honorable James Charles Fox to the contrary notwithstanding.\r\nYea, without danger of contradiction, we may say there are women in\r\nthis nation even now, who understand the political issues of this hour\r\nquite as well as those who stand at the head of our government.\r\n\r\nWe are very apt to accept popular assertions ofttimes repeated as\r\ntruisms, and in this way man's superiority has passed into a proverb,\r\nand the sex in general believe it. When Milton penned the line, \"God,\r\nthy will, thou mine,\" and made his Eve thus reverently submissive to\r\nher Adam, he little thought of bright girls in the nineteenth century,\r\nwell versed in science, philosophy, and the languages, sitting in the\r\nsenior class of a college of the American republic, laughing his male\r\nconceit to scorn.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[76] The _New York Tribune_, Feb. 19, 1881, gives the following\r\ninteresting facts: \"William Franklin, the illegitimate son of\r\nBenjamin, who was long a resident of New York and hereabout, conducted\r\nin person his father's postal system. At Amboy, or Perth Amboy, a\r\nlittle town of once high aristocratic standing, which dozes on the\r\nedge of the Jersey hills and overlooks the oyster groves of Prince's\r\nBay, began the Post-Office of North America under John Hamilton in\r\n1694. It was a private patent, and he sold it to the Government. Many\r\nyears afterward William Franklin settled at the same place, where once\r\nhis father passed in Hamilton's day a footsore vagrant pressing from\r\nBoston to Philadelphia to get bread. There the younger Franklin reared\r\na 'palace,' and lived in it as Governor of New Jersey till his\r\nadherence to the Crown, that had done better for him than his\r\nfather--made him an exile and a captive. He was sent under guard to\r\nEast Windsor, Conn., and his jail was made in the house of Captain\r\nEbenezer Grant there, of the family of President Grant's ancestors,\r\nand he was prohibited the use of pen, ink, and paper--a needless\r\npunishment to a man who had delivered so many letters to others.\"\r\n\r\n[77] In the _New York Observer_, 1876.\r\n\r\n[78] After a diligent search for Mr. James Ross and his promised\r\n\"interesting chapter of local history,\" we learned that the author was\r\nin his grave, and that from his posthumous papers this valuable\r\ndocument had not yet been exhumed by his literary executor.\r\n\r\n[79] The following letter contains the sentiments referred to in the\r\ntext:\r\n\r\n                                    ORANGE, N. J., _Dec. 18, 1858_.\r\n\r\n    MR. MANDEVILLE, TAX COLLECTOR, SIR:--Enclosed I return my tax\r\n    bill, without paying it. My reason for doing so is, that women\r\n    suffer taxation, and yet have no representation, which is not only\r\n    unjust to one-half the adult population, but is contrary to our\r\n    theory of government. For years some women have been paying their\r\n    taxes under protest, but still taxes are imposed, and\r\n    representation is not granted. The only course now left us is to\r\n    refuse to pay the tax. We know well what the immediate result of\r\n    this refusal must be.\r\n\r\n    But we believe that when the attention of men is called to the\r\n    wide difference between their theory of government and its\r\n    practice, in this particular, they can not fail to see the mistake\r\n    they now make, by imposing taxes on women, while they refuse them\r\n    the right of suffrage, and that the sense of justice which is in\r\n    all good men, will lead them to correct it. Then we shall\r\n    cheerfully pay our taxes--not till then.\r\n\r\n                                 Respectfully,        LUCY STONE.\r\n\r\n[80] See _Washington National Intelligencer_ for Oct. 15, 1857, and\r\n_Historical Magazine_, Vol. I., page 360.\r\n\r\n[81] _Frank Leslie's Magazine_, Feb., 1877.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nREMINISCENCES.\r\n\r\nBY E. C. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Conventions held in Seneca Falls and Rochester, N.\r\nY., in 1848, attracted the attention of one destined to take a most\r\nimportant part in the new movement--Susan B. Anthony, who for her\r\ncourage and executive ability was facetiously called by William Henry\r\nCharming, the Napoleon of our struggle. At this time she was teaching\r\nin the Academy at Canajoharie, a little village in the beautiful\r\nvalley of the Mohawk.\r\n\r\n\"The Woman's Declaration of Independence\" issued from those\r\nconventions, startled and amused her, and she laughed heartily at the\r\nnovelty and presumption of the demand. But on returning home to spend\r\nher vacation, she was surprised to find that her sober Quaker parents\r\nand sisters having attended the Rochester meetings, regarded them as\r\nvery profitable and interesting, and the demands made as proper and\r\nreasonable. She was already interested in the anti-slavery and\r\ntemperance reforms, and was an active member of an organization called\r\n\"The Daughters of Temperance,\" and had spoken a few times in their\r\npublic meetings. But the new gospel of \"Woman's Rights,\" found a ready\r\nresponse in her mind, and from that time her best efforts have been\r\ngiven to the enfranchisement of woman.\r\n\r\nIt was in the month of May, of 1851, that I first met Miss Anthony.\r\nThat was to both of us an eventful meeting, that in a measure\r\nhenceforth shaped our lives. As our own estimate of ourselves and our\r\nfriendship may differ somewhat from that taken from an objective point\r\nof view, I will give an extract from what a mutual friend wrote of us\r\nsome years ago:\r\n\r\n     Miss Susan B. Anthony, a well-known, indefatigable and life-long\r\n     advocate of temperance, anti-slavery, and woman's rights, has\r\n     been, since 1851, Mrs. Stanton's intimate associate in\r\n     reformatory labors. These celebrated women are of about equal\r\n     ages, but of the most opposite characteristics, and illustrate\r\n     the theory of counterparts in affection by entertaining for each\r\n     other a friendship of extraordinary strength.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Stanton is a fine writer, but a poor executant; Miss Anthony\r\n     is a thorough manager, but a poor writer. Both have large brains\r\n     and great hearts; neither has any selfish ambition for\r\n     celebrity; but each vies with the other in a noble enthusiasm,\r\n     for the cause to which they are devoting their lives.\r\n\r\n     Nevertheless, to describe them critically, I ought to say that\r\n     opposites though they be, each does not so much supplement the\r\n     other's difficiencies as augment the other's eccentricities. Thus\r\n     they often stimulate each other's aggressiveness, and at the same\r\n     time diminish each other's discretion.\r\n\r\n     But whatever may be the imprudent utterances of the one, or the\r\n     impolitic methods of the other, the animating motives of both are\r\n     evermore as white as the light. The good that they do is by\r\n     design; the harm by accident. These two women sitting together in\r\n     their parlors, have for the last thirty years been diligent\r\n     forgers of all manner of projectiles, from fire works to\r\n     thunderbolts, and have hurled them with unexpected explosion into\r\n     the midst of all manner of educational, reformatory, religious,\r\n     and political assemblies, sometimes to the pleasant surprise and\r\n     half welcome of the members, more often to the bewilderment and\r\n     prostration of numerous victims; and in a few signal instances,\r\n     to the gnashing of angry men's teeth. I know of no two more\r\n     pertinacious incendiaries in the whole country! Nor will they\r\n     themselves deny the charge. In fact this noise-making twain are\r\n     the two sticks of a drum for keeping up what Daniel Webster\r\n     called \"the rub-a-dub of agitation.\"\r\n\r\nHow well I remember the day I first met my life-long friend. George\r\nThompson and William Lloyd Garrison having announced an anti-slavery\r\nmeeting in Seneca Falls, Miss Anthony came to attend it. These\r\ngentlemen were my guests. Walking home after the adjournment, we met\r\nMrs. Bloomer and Miss Anthony on the corner of the street waiting to\r\ngreet us. There she stood with her good earnest face and genial smile,\r\ndressed in gray silk, hat and all the same color, relieved with pale\r\nblue ribbons, the perfection of neatness and sobriety. I liked her\r\nthoroughly, and why I did not at once invite her home with me to\r\ndinner, I do not know. She accuses me of that neglect and never has\r\nforgiven me, as she wished to see and hear all she could of our noble\r\nfriends. I suppose my mind was full of what I had heard, or my coming\r\ndinner, or the probable behavior of three mischievous boys who had\r\nbeen busily exploring the premises while I was at the meeting. That I\r\nhad abundant cause for anxiety in regard to the philosophical\r\nexperiments these young savages might try, the reader will admit when\r\ninformed of some of their performances.[82]\r\n\r\nIt is often said by those who know Miss Anthony best, that she has\r\nbeen my good angel, always pushing and guiding me to work, that but\r\nfor her pertinacity I should never have accomplished the little I\r\nhave; and on the other hand, it has been said that I forged the\r\nthunderbolts and she fired them. Perhaps all this is in a measure\r\ntrue. With the cares of a large family, I might in time, like too many\r\nwomen, have become wholly absorbed in a narrow family selfishness, had\r\nnot my friend been continually exploring new fields for missionary\r\nlabors. Her description of a body of men on any platform, complacently\r\ndeciding questions in which women had an equal interest, without an\r\nequal voice, readily roused me to a determination to throw a firebrand\r\nin the midst of their assembly.\r\n\r\nThus, whenever I saw that stately Quaker girl coming across my lawn, I\r\nknew that some happy convocation of the sons of Adam were to be set by\r\nthe ears, by one of our appeals or resolutions. The little portmanteau\r\nstuffed with facts was opened, and there we had what the Rev. John\r\nSmith and the Hon. Richard Roe had said, false interpretations of\r\nBible texts, the statistics of women robbed of their property, shut\r\nout of some college, half paid for their work, the reports of some\r\ndisgraceful trial, injustice enough to turn any woman's thoughts from\r\nstockings and puddings. Then we would get out our pens and write\r\narticles for papers, or a petition to the Legislature, letters to the\r\nfaithful here and there, stir up the women in Ohio, Pennsylvania, or\r\nMassachusetts, call on _The Lily_, _The Una_, _The Liberator_, and\r\n_The Standard_, to remember our wrongs as well as those of the slave.\r\nWe never met without issuing a pronunciamento on some question.\r\n\r\nWe were at once fast friends, in thought and sympathy we were one, and\r\nin the division of labor we exactly complemented each other. In\r\nwriting we did better work together than either could alone. While she\r\nis slow and analytical in composition, I am rapid and synthetic. I am\r\nthe better writer, she the better critic. She supplied the facts and\r\nstatistics, I the philosophy and rhetoric, and together we have made\r\narguments that have stood unshaken by the storms of thirty long years:\r\narguments that no man has answered. Our speeches may be considered the\r\nunited product of our two brains.\r\n\r\nSo entirely one are we, that in all our associations, ever side by\r\nside on the same platform, not one feeling of jealousy or envy has\r\never shadowed our lives. We have indulged freely in criticism of each\r\nother when alone, and hotly contended whenever we have differed, but\r\nin our friendship of thirty years there has never been a break of one\r\nhour. To the world we always seem to agree and uniformly reflect each\r\nother. Like husband and wife, each has the feeling that we must have\r\nno differences in public. Thus united, at an early day we began to\r\nsurvey the State and nation, the future field of our labors. We read\r\nwith critical eyes the proceedings of Congress and Legislatures, of\r\nGeneral Assemblies and Synods, of Conferences and Conventions, and\r\ndiscovered that in all alike the existence of woman was entirely\r\nignored.\r\n\r\nNight after night by an old-fashioned fireplace we plotted and planned\r\nthe coming agitation, how, when, and where each entering wedge could\r\nbe driven, by which woman might be recognized, and her rights secured.\r\nSpeedily the State was aflame with disturbances in temperance and\r\nteachers' conventions, and the press heralded the news far and near\r\nthat women delegates had suddenly appeared demanding admission in\r\nmen's conventions; that their rights had been hotly contended session\r\nafter session, by liberal men on the one side; the clergy and learned\r\nprofessors on the other; an overwhelming majority rejecting the women\r\nwith terrible anathemas and denunciations. Such battles were fought\r\nover and over in the chief cities of many of the Northern States,\r\nuntil the bigotry of men in all the reforms and professions was\r\nthoroughly tested. Every right achieved: to enter a college; to study\r\na profession; to labor in some new industry, or to advocate a reform\r\nmeasure, was contended for inch by inch.\r\n\r\nMany of those enjoying all these blessings, now complacently say, \"If\r\nthese pioneers in reform, had only pressed their measures more\r\njudiciously; in a more ladylike manner; in more choice language; in a\r\nmore deferential attitude, the gentlemen could not have behaved so\r\nrudely.\" We give in these pages enough of the characteristics of these\r\nwomen, of the sentiments they expressed, of their education, ancestry,\r\nand position, to show that no power could have met the prejudice and\r\nbigotry of that period more successfully than they did, who so bravely\r\nand persistently fought and conquered them.\r\n\r\nTrue, those gentlemen were all quite willing that women should join\r\ntheir societies and churches, to do the drudgery, to work up the\r\nenthusiasm in fairs and revivals, conventions and flag presentations,\r\nto pay a dollar apiece into their treasury for the honor of being\r\nmembers of their various organizations, to beg money for the church,\r\ncirculate petitions from door to door, to visit saloons, to pray with\r\nor defy rum-sellers, to teach school at half-price, and sit round the\r\noutskirts of a hall like so many wall flowers in teachers' State\r\nConventions; but they would not allow them to sit on the platform,\r\naddress the assembly, nor vote for men and measures.\r\n\r\nThose who had learned the first lessons of human rights from the lips\r\nof Beriah Green, Samuel J. May, and Gerrit Smith, would not accept any\r\nsuch position. When women abandoned the temperance reform, all\r\ninterest in the question gradually died out in the State, and\r\npractically nothing was done in New York for nearly twenty years.\r\nGerrit Smith made one or two attempts toward an \"anti-dram-shop\r\nparty,\" but as women could not vote they felt no interest in the\r\nmeasure, and failure was the result.\r\n\r\nI soon convinced my new friend that the ballot was the key to the\r\nsituation, that when we had a voice in the laws we should be welcomed\r\nto any platform. In turning the intense earnestness and religious\r\nenthusiasm of this great-souled woman into this one channel, I soon\r\nfelt the power of my convert in goading me forever forward to more\r\nuntiring work. Soon fastened heart to heart with hooks of steel in a\r\nfriendship that thirty years of confidence and affection have steadily\r\nstrengthened, we have labored faithfully together.\r\n\r\nAfter twelve added years of agitation, from the passage of the\r\nproperty bill, New York conceded other civil rights to married women.\r\nPending the discussion of these various bills, Susan B. Anthony\r\ncirculated petitions both for the civil and political rights of woman\r\nthroughout the State, traveling in stage coaches and open wagons and\r\nsleighs in all seasons, and on foot from door to door through towns\r\nand cities, doing her uttermost to rouse women to some sense of their\r\nnatural rights as human beings, to their civil and political rights as\r\ncitizens of a republic; and while expending her time, strength, and\r\nmoney to secure these blessings for the women of the State, they would\r\ngruffly tell her they had all the rights they wanted, or rudely shut\r\nthe door in her face, leaving her to stand outside, petition in hand,\r\nwith as much contempt as if she were asking alms for herself. None but\r\nthose who did that petition work in the early days for the slaves and\r\nthe women, can ever know the hardships and humiliations that were\r\nendured. But it was done because it was only through petitions, a\r\npower seemingly so inefficient, that disfranchised classes could be\r\nheard in the national councils, hence their importance.\r\n\r\nThe frivolous objections some women made to our appeals were as\r\nexasperating as ridiculous. To reply to them politely at all times,\r\nrequired a divine patience. On one occasion, after addressing the\r\nLegislature, some of the ladies in congratulating me, inquired in a\r\ndeprecating tone, \"What do you do with your children?\" \"Ladies,\" I\r\nsaid, \"it takes me no longer to speak than you to listen; what have\r\nyou done with your children the two hours you have been sitting here?\r\nBut to answer your questions. I never leave my children to go to\r\nSaratoga, Washington, Newport, or Europe, nor even to come here. They\r\nare at this moment with a faithful nurse at the Delavan House, and\r\nhaving accomplished my mission, we shall all return home together.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony, who was a frequent guest at my home, sometimes stood\r\nguard on such occasions.[83] The children of our household say that\r\namong their earliest recollections is the tableau of \"Mother and\r\nSusan,\" seated by a large table covered with books and papers, always\r\nwriting and talking about the Constitution, interrupted with\r\noccasional visits from others of the faithful. Hither came Elizabeth\r\nOakes Smith, Paulina Wright Davis, Frances Dana Gage, Dr. Harriot\r\nHunt, Antoinette Brown, Lucy Stone, Abby Kelly, by turn, until all\r\nthese names were as familiar as household words to the children.\r\n\r\nMartha C. Wright, of Auburn, was a frequent visitor at the center of\r\nthe rebellion, as my sequestered cottage on Locust Hill was\r\nfacetiously called. She brought to these councils of war not only her\r\nown individual wisdom, but that of the wife and sister of William H.\r\nSeward, and sometimes encouraging suggestions from the great statesman\r\nhimself, from whose writings we often gleaned grand and radical\r\nsentiments. Lucretia Mott, too, being an occasional guest at her\r\nsister's in Auburn, added the dignity of her presence at many of these\r\nimportant consultations. She was uniformly in favor of toning down our\r\nfiery pronunciamentoes. For Miss Anthony and myself, the English\r\nlanguage had no words strong enough to express the indignation we felt\r\nin view of the prolonged injustice to woman. We found, however, that\r\nafter expressing ourselves in the most vehement manner, and thus in a\r\nmeasure giving our feelings an outlet, we were reconciled to issue the\r\ndocuments at last in milder terms. If the men of the State could have\r\nknown the stern rebukes, the denunciations, the wit, the irony, the\r\nsarcasm that were garnered there, and then judiciously pigeon-holed,\r\nand milder and more persuasive appeals substituted, they would have\r\nbeen truly thankful that they fared no worse.\r\n\r\nMr. Seward, in the brief intervals in his Washington life, made\r\nfrequent visits in our neighborhood at the house of Judge G. V.\r\nSackett, a man of wealth and some political influence. One of the\r\nSenator's standing anecdotes at dinner to illustrate the purifying\r\ninfluence of woman at the polls, which he always told with great zest\r\nfor my special benefit, was in regard to the manner his wife's sister\r\nexercised the right of suffrage.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Worden having the supervision of a farm near Auburn, was obliged\r\nto hire two or three men for its cultivation. It was her custom,\r\nhaving examined them as to their capacity to perform the required\r\nlabor, their knowledge of tools, horses, cattle, gardening, and\r\nhorticulture, to inquire as to their politics. She informed them that\r\nbeing a woman and a widow, and having no one to represent her, she\r\nmust have Republicans to do her voting, to represent her political\r\nopinions, and it always so happened that the men who offered their\r\nservices belonged to the Republican party.\r\n\r\n\"Some one remarked to her one day, 'Are you sure your men vote as they\r\npromise?' 'Yes,' she replied, 'I trust nothing to their discretion. I\r\ntake them in my carriage within sight of the polls, put them in charge\r\nof some Republican who can be trusted. I see they have the right\r\ntickets, then I feel sure I am faithfully represented, and I know I am\r\nright in so doing. I have neither husband, father, nor son; am\r\nresponsible for my own taxes; am amenable to all the laws of the\r\nState; must pay the penalty of my own crimes if I commit any; hence I\r\nhave the right, according to the principles of our government, to\r\nrepresentation, and so long as I am not permitted to vote in person, I\r\nhave a right to do so by proxy, hence I hire men to vote my\r\nprinciples.'\" Thus she disposed of the statesman and his seriocomic\r\nmorality.\r\n\r\nThese two sisters, daughters of Judge Miller, an influential man of\r\nwealth and position, were women of culture and remarkable natural\r\nintelligence, and interested in all progressive ideas. They had rare\r\ncommon-sense and independence of character, great simplicity of\r\nmanner, and were wholly indifferent to the little arts of the toilet.\r\n\r\nI was often told by fashionable women that one great objection to the\r\nwoman's rights movement was the publicity of the conventions; the\r\nimmodesty of speaking from a platform; and the trial of seeing one's\r\nname in the papers. Several ladies made such remarks to me one day as\r\na bevy of us were sitting together in one of the fashionable hotels in\r\nNewport. We were holding a Convention there at that time, and some of\r\nthem had been present at one of the sessions. \"Really,\" said I,\r\n\"ladies, you surprise me; our Conventions are not as public as the\r\nball-room where I saw you all dancing last night. As to modesty, it\r\nmay be a question in many minds whether it is less modest to speak\r\nwords of soberness and truth, plainly dressed with one's person\r\ndecently covered on a platform, than gorgeously arrayed with bare arms\r\nand shoulders, to waltz in the arms of strange gentlemen.\r\n\r\n\"And as to the press, I noticed you all reading with evident\r\nsatisfaction the personal compliments and full descriptions of your\r\ndresses at the last ball, in this morning's papers. I presume that any\r\none of you would have felt slighted if your name had not been\r\nmentioned in the general description. When my name is mentioned, it is\r\nin connection with some great moral movement, as making a speech, or\r\nreading a resolution. Thus we all suffer or enjoy the same publicity,\r\nwe are all alike ridiculed, wise men pity and ridicule you, fops and\r\nfools pity and ridicule me, you as the victims of folly and fashion,\r\nme as the representative of many of the disagreeable 'isms' of the\r\nage, as they choose to distinguish liberal opinions. It is amusing in\r\nanalyzing prejudices to see on what slender foundations they rest,\"\r\nand the ladies around me were so completely cornered that no one\r\nattempted an answer.\r\n\r\nI remember being at a party at Gov. Seward's one evening, when Mr.\r\nBurlingame and his Chinese delegation were among the guests. As soon\r\nas the dancing commenced, and young ladies and gentlemen locked in\r\neach other's arms, began to whirl in the giddy waltz, these Chinese\r\ngentlemen were so shocked that they covered their faces with their\r\nfans, occasionally peeping out each side and expressing their surprise\r\nto each other. They thought us the most immodest women on the face of\r\nthe earth. Modesty and good taste are questions of latitude and\r\neducation; the more people know, the more their ideas are expanded, by\r\ntravel, experience, and observation; the less easily they are shocked.\r\nThe narrowness and bigotry of women, are the result of their\r\ncircumscribed sphere of thought and action.\r\n\r\nSoon after Judge Hurlbut had published his work on \"Human Rights,\" and\r\nI had addressed the Legislature the first time, we met at a dinner\r\nparty in Albany; Mr. and Mrs. Seward were there. The Senator was very\r\nmerry on that occasion, and made Judge Hurlbut and myself the target\r\nfor all his ridicule on the woman's rights question, in which most of\r\nthe company joined, so that we stood quite alone. Sure that we had the\r\nright on our side, and the arguments clearly defined in our own minds,\r\nand both being cool and self-possessed, and with wit and sarcasm quite\r\nequal to any of them, we fought the Senator inch by inch until he had\r\na very narrow platform to stand on. Mrs. Seward maintained an unbroken\r\nsilence, while those ladies who did open their lips were with the\r\nopposition, supposing, no doubt, that Mr. Seward represented his\r\nwife's opinions.\r\n\r\nWhen the ladies withdrew from the table, my embarrassment may be\r\neasily imagined. Separated from the Judge, I should now be an hour\r\nwith a bevy of ladies who evidently felt a repulsion to all my most\r\ncherished opinions. It was the first time I had met Mrs. Seward, and I\r\ndid not then know the broad liberal tendencies of her mind. What a\r\ntide of disagreeable thoughts rushed through me in that short passage\r\nfrom the dining-room to the parlor; how gladly I would have glided out\r\nthe front door, but that was impossible, so I made up my mind to\r\nstroll round as if self-absorbed and look at the books and paintings\r\nuntil the Judge appeared, as I took it for granted that after all I\r\nsaid at the table on the political, religious, and social equality of\r\nwoman, not a lady would have anything to say to me.\r\n\r\nImagine then my surprise when the moment the parlor door was closed\r\nupon us, Mrs. Seward, approaching me most affectionately said, \"Let me\r\nthank you for all the brave words you uttered at the dinner-table, and\r\nfor your speech before the Legislature, that thrilled my soul as I\r\nread it over and over.\" I was filled with joy and astonishment.\r\nRecovering myself, I said, \"Is it possible, Mrs. Seward, that you\r\nagree with me? Then why, when I was so hard pressed with foes on every\r\nside, did you not come to the defence? I supposed that all you ladies\r\nwere hostile to every one of my ideas on this question!\" \"No, no!\"\r\nsaid she, \"I am with you thoroughly, but I am a born coward; there is\r\nnothing I dread more than Mr. Seward's ridicule. I would rather walk\r\nup to the cannon's mouth than encounter it.\" \"I too am with you,\" \"And\r\nI,\" said two or three others who had been silent at the table. I never\r\nhad a more serious, heartfelt conversation than with these ladies.\r\nMrs. Seward's spontaneity and earnestness had moved them all deeply,\r\nand when the Senator appeared the first word he said was, \"Before we\r\npart I must confess that I was fairly vanquished by you and the Judge,\r\non my own principles (for we had quoted some of his most radical\r\nutterances). You have the argument, but custom and prejudice are\r\nagainst you, and they are stronger than truth and logic.\"\r\n\r\nWe had quite a magnetic circle of reformers in Central New York, that\r\nkept the missives flying. At Rochester, were William H. Ohanning,\r\nFrederick Douglass, the Anthonys, the Posts, the Hallowells, the\r\nStebbins, some grand Quaker families in Farmington, and Waterloo; Mrs.\r\nBloomer and her sprightly weekly called _The Lily_, at Seneca Falls;\r\nMrs. Wright, Mrs. Worden, Mrs. Seward, at Auburn; Gerrit Smith's\r\nfamily at Peterboro; Beriah Green's at Whitesboro, with the Sedgwicks\r\nand Mays, and Matilda Joslyn Gage at Syracuse. Although Mrs. Gage was\r\nsurrounded with a family of small children for years, yet she was\r\nalways a student, an omnivorous reader and liberal thinker, and her\r\npen was ever at work answering the attacks on the woman movement in\r\nthe county and State journals. In the village of Manlius, where she\r\nlived some time after her marriage, she was the sole representative of\r\nthis unpopular reform. When walking the street she would often hear\r\nsome boy, shielded by a dry-goods box or a fence, cry out \"woman's\r\nrights.\"\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, at a large evening party at Mr. Van Schaick's, the\r\nhost read aloud a poem called Rufus Chubb, a burlesque on\r\n\"strong-minded\" women, ridiculing careers and conventions, and the\r\nmany claims being made for larger freedom. Mrs. Gage, then quite\r\nyoung, was surprised and embarrassed. Every eye was fixed on her, as\r\nevidently the type of womanhood the author was portraying. As soon as\r\nthe reader's voice died away, Mrs. Gage, with marked coolness and\r\ngrace, approached him, and with an imaginary wreath crowned him the\r\npoet-laureate of the occasion, and introduced him to the company as\r\n\"the immortal Rufus Chubb.\" The expressive gesture and the few brief\r\nwords conferring the honor, turned the laugh on Mr. Van Schaick so\r\ncompletely, that he was the target for all the merriment of the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gage was the only daughter of Dr. Hezekiah Joslyn, a man of\r\nlearning and philanthropic tendencies. He gave much attention to the\r\ndirection of his daughter's thought and reading. She always had a\r\nknack of rummaging through old libraries, bringing more startling\r\nfacts to light than any woman I ever knew.[84]\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1861, just after the election of Lincoln, the\r\nAbolitionists decided to hold a series of Conventions in the chief\r\ncities of the North. All their available speakers were pledged for\r\nactive service. The Republican party, having absorbed the political\r\nAbolitionists within its ranks by its declared hostility to the\r\nextension of slavery, had come into power with overwhelming\r\nmajorities; hence the Garrisonian Abolitionists, opposed to all\r\ncompromises, felt this was the opportune moment to rouse the people to\r\nthe necessity of holding that party to its declared principles, and\r\npushing it, if possible, a step or two forward.\r\n\r\nI was invited to accompany Miss Anthony and Beriah Green to a few\r\npoints in Central New York. But we soon found, by the concerted action\r\nof Republicans all over the country, the Conventions were broken up at\r\nevery point. This furnished one occasion on which Republicans and\r\nDemocrats could work harmoniously together, and they made common cause\r\nagainst the Abolitionists. The John Brown raid the year before had\r\nintimidated Northern politicians as much as Southern slaveholders, and\r\nthe general feeling was that the discussion of the question at the\r\nNorth should be altogether suppressed.\r\n\r\nFrom Buffalo to Albany our experience was the same, varied only by the\r\nfertile resources of the actors and their surroundings. Thirty years\r\nof education had somewhat changed the character of Northern mobs. They\r\nno longer dragged men through the streets with ropes round their\r\nnecks, nor broke up women's prayer-meetings; they no longer threw eggs\r\nand brickbats at the apostles of reform, nor dipped them in barrels of\r\ntar and feathers; they simply crowded the halls, and with laughing,\r\ngroaning, clapping, and cheering, effectually interrupted the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nThus we passed the two days we had advertised for a Convention in St.\r\nJames' Hall, Buffalo. As we paid for the Hall, the mob enjoyed\r\nthemselves at our expense in more ways than one. At the appointed time\r\nevery session we took our places on the platform, making at various\r\nintervals of silence renewed efforts to speak. Not succeeding, we sat\r\nand conversed with each other and many friends who crowded the\r\nplatform and ante-rooms. Thus among ourselves we had a pleasant\r\nreception and a discussion of many phases of the question that brought\r\nus together. The mob not only vouchsafed to us the privilege of\r\ntalking to our friends without interruption, but delegations of their\r\nown came behind the scenes from time to time, to discuss with us the\r\nright of free speech and the constitutionality of slavery.\r\n\r\nThese Buffalo rowdies were headed by ex-Justice Hinson, aided by\r\nyounger members of the Fillmore and Seymour families and the Chief of\r\nPolice and fifty subordinates, who were admitted to the hall free for\r\nthe express purpose of protecting our right of free speech, which in\r\ndefiance of the Mayor's orders, they did not make the slightest effort\r\nto do. At Lockport there was a feeble attempt in the same direction.\r\nAt Albion neither hall, church, nor school-house could be obtained, so\r\nwe held small meetings in the dining-room of the hotel.\r\n\r\nAt Rochester, Corinthian Hall was packed long before the hour\r\nadvertised. This was a delicately appreciative jocose mob. At this\r\npoint Aaron Powell joined us. As he had just risen from a bed of\r\nsickness, looking pale and emaciated, he slowly mounted the platform.\r\nThe mob at once took in his look of exhaustion, and as he seated\r\nhimself they gave an audible, simultaneous sigh, as if to say, What a\r\nrelief it is to be seated! So completely did the tender manifestation\r\nreflect Mr. Powell's apparent condition, that the whole audience burst\r\ninto a roar of laughter. Here, too, all attempts to speak were futile.\r\n\r\nAt Port Byron a generous sprinkling of cayenne pepper on the stove,\r\nsoon cut short all constitutional arguments and paeans to liberty. And\r\nso it was all the way to Albany. The whole State was aflame with the\r\nmob spirit, and from Boston and various points in other States, the\r\nsame news reached us. As the Legislature was in session, and we were\r\nadvertised in Albany, a radical member sarcastically moved \"that as\r\nMrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony were about to move on Albany, the\r\nmilitia be ordered out for the protection of the city.\"\r\n\r\nHappily, Albany could then boast a democratic Mayor, a man of courage\r\nand conscience, who said the right of free speech should never be\r\ntrodden underfoot where he had the power to prevent it. And grandly\r\ndid that one determined man maintain order in his jurisdiction.\r\nThrough all the sessions of the Convention Mayor Thatcher sat on the\r\nplatform, his police stationed in different parts of the Hall and\r\noutside the building, to disperse the crowd as fast as collected. If a\r\nman or boy hissed or made the slightest interruption, he was\r\nimmediately ejected. And not only did the Mayor preserve order in the\r\nmeetings, but with a company of armed police, he escorted us every\r\ntime to and from the Delavan House. The last night Gerrit Smith\r\naddressed the mob from the steps of the hotel, after which they gave\r\nhim three cheers, and dispersed in good order.\r\n\r\nWhen proposing for the Mayor a vote of thanks at the close of the\r\nConvention, Mr. Smith expressed his fears that it had been a severe\r\nordeal for him to listen to these prolonged anti-slavery discussions,\r\nhe smiled, and said: \"I have really been deeply interested and\r\ninstructed. I rather congratulate myself that a Convention of this\r\ncharacter has at last come in the line of my business, otherwise I\r\nshould have probably remained in ignorance of many important facts and\r\nopinions I now understand and appreciate.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst all this was going on publicly, we had an equally trying\r\nexperience progressing day by day behind the scenes. Miss Anthony had\r\nbeen instrumental in helping a fugitive mother with her child, escape\r\nfrom a husband who had immured her in an insane asylum. The wife,\r\nbelonging to one of the first families of New York, her brother a\r\nUnited States Senator, and the husband a man of position, a large\r\ncircle of friends and acquaintances were interested in the result.\r\nThough she was incarcerated in an insane asylum for eighteen months,\r\nyet members of her own family again and again testified that she was\r\nnot insane. Miss Anthony knowing that she was not, and believing fully\r\nthat the unhappy mother was the victim of a conspiracy, would not\r\nreveal her hiding-place.\r\n\r\nKnowing the confidence Miss Anthony felt in the wisdom of Mr. Garrison\r\nand Mr. Phillips, they were implored to use their influence with her\r\nto give up the fugitives. Letters and telegrams, persuasions,\r\narguments, warnings, from Mr. Garrison, Mr. Phillips, the Senator, on\r\nthe one side, and from Lydia Mott, Mrs. Elizabeth F. Ellet, Abby\r\nHopper Gibbons, on the other, poured in upon her day after day, but\r\nMiss Anthony remained immovable, although she knew she was defying\r\nauthority and violating law, and that she might be arrested any moment\r\non the platform. We had known so many aggravated cases of this kind,\r\nthat in daily counsel we resolved that this woman should not be\r\nrecaptured if it was possible to prevent it. To us it looked as\r\nimperative a duty to shield a sane mother who had been torn from a\r\nfamily of little children and doomed to the companionship of lunatics,\r\nand to aid her in fleeing to a place of safety, as to help a fugitive\r\nfrom slavery to Canada. In both cases an unjust law was violated; in\r\nboth cases the supposed owners of the victims were defied, hence, in\r\npoint of law and morals, the act was the same in both cases. The\r\nresult proved the wisdom of Miss Anthony's decision, as all with whom\r\nMrs. P. came in contact for years afterward, expressed the opinion\r\nthat she was perfectly sane and always had been. Could the dark\r\nsecrets of these insane asylums be brought to light, we should be\r\nshocked to know the countless number of rebellious wives, sisters, and\r\ndaughters that are thus annually sacrificed to false customs and\r\nconventionalisms, and barbarous laws made by men for women.\r\n\r\nQuite an agitation occurred in 1852, on woman's costume. In demanding\r\na place in the world of work, the unfitness of her dress seemed to\r\nsome, an insurmountable obstacle. How can you, it was said, ever\r\ncompete with man for equal place and pay, with garments of such frail\r\nfabrics and so cumbrously fashioned, and how can you ever hope to\r\nenjoy the same health and vigor with man, so long as the waist is\r\npressed into the smallest compass, pounds of clothing hung on the\r\nhips, the limbs cramped with skirts, and with high heels the whole\r\nwoman thrown out of her true equilibrium. Wise men, physicians, and\r\nsensible women, made their appeals, year after year; physiologists\r\nlectured on the subject; the press commented, until it seemed as if\r\nthere were a serious demand for some decided steps, in the direction\r\nof a rational costume for women. The most casual observer could see\r\nhow many pleasures young girls were continually sacrificing to their\r\ndress: In walking, running, rowing, skating, dancing, going up and\r\ndown stairs, climbing trees and fences, the airy fabrics and flowing\r\nskirts were a continual impediment and vexation. We can not estimate\r\nhow large a share of the ill-health and temper among women is the\r\nresult of the crippling, cribbing influence of her costume. Fathers,\r\nhusbands, and brothers, all joined in protest against the small waist,\r\nand stiff distended petticoats, which were always themes for unbounded\r\nridicule. But no sooner did a few brave conscientious women adopt the\r\nbifurcated costume, an imitation in part of the Turkish style, than\r\nthe press at once turned its guns on \"The Bloomer,\" and the same\r\nfathers, husbands, and brothers, with streaming eyes and pathetic\r\ntones, conjured the women of their households to cling to the\r\nprevailing fashions.[85] The object of those who donned the new\r\nattire, was primarily health and freedom; but as the daughter of\r\nGerrit Smith introduced it just at the time of the early conventions,\r\nit was supposed to be an inherent element in the demand for political\r\nequality. As some of those who advocated the right of suffrage wore\r\nthe dress, and had been identified with all the unpopular reforms, in\r\nthe reports of our conventions, the press rung the changes on\r\n\"strong-minded,\" \"Bloomer,\" \"free love,\" \"easy divorce,\"\r\n\"amalgamation.\" I wore the dress two years and found it a great\r\nblessing. What a sense of liberty I felt, in running up and down\r\nstairs with my hands free to carry whatsoever I would, to trip through\r\nthe rain or snow with no skirts to hold or brush, ready at any moment\r\nto climb a hill-top to see the sun go down, or the moon rise, with no\r\nruffles or trails to be limped by the dew, or soiled by the grass.\r\nWhat an emancipation from little petty vexatious trammels and\r\nannoyances every hour of the day. Yet such is the tyranny of custom,\r\nthat to escape constant observation, criticism, ridicule,\r\npersecution, mobs,[86] one after another gladly went back to the old\r\nslavery and sacrificed freedom to repose. I have never wondered since\r\nthat the Chinese women allow their daughters' feet to be encased in\r\niron shoes, nor that the Hindoo widows walk calmly to the funeral\r\npyre. I suppose no act of my life ever gave my cousin, Gerrit Smith,\r\nsuch deep sorrow, as my abandonment of the \"Bloomer costume.\" He\r\npublished an open letter[87] to me on the subject, and when his\r\ndaughter, Mrs. Miller, three years after, followed my example, he felt\r\nthat women had so little courage and persistence, that for a time he\r\nalmost despaired of the success of the suffrage movement; of such\r\nvital consequence in woman's mental and physical development did he\r\nfeel the dress to be.\r\n\r\nGerrit Smith[88] Samuel J. May, J. C. Jackson, C. D. Miller and D. C.\r\nBloomer, sustained the women who lead in this reform, unflinchingly,\r\nduring the trying experiment. Let the names of those who made this\r\nprotest be remembered. We knew the Bloomer costume never could be\r\ngenerally becoming, as it required a perfection of form, limbs, and\r\nfeet, such as few possessed, and we who wore it also knew that it was\r\nnot artistic. Though the martyrdom proved too much for us who had so\r\nmany other measures to press on the public conscience, yet no\r\nexperiment is lost, however evanescent, that rouses thought to the\r\ninjurious consequences of the present style of dress, sacrificing to\r\nits absurdities so many of the most promising girls of this\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[82] One imagined himself possessed of rare powers of invention (an\r\nancestral weakness for generations), and had just made a\r\nlife-preserver of corks, and tested its virtues on a brother about\r\neighteen months old. Accompanied by a troop of expectant boys, the\r\nbaby was drawn in his carriage to the banks of the Seneca, stripped,\r\nthe string of corks tied under his arms, and set afloat in the river,\r\nthe philosopher and his satellites in a row-boat, watching the\r\nexperiment. The child, accustomed to a morning bath in a large tub,\r\nsplashed about joyfully, keeping his head above water. He was as blue\r\nas indigo, and as cold as a frog when rescued by his anxious mother.\r\nThe next day, the same victimized infant was seen by a passing friend,\r\nseated on the chimney, on the highest peak of the house. Without\r\nalarming any one, the friend hurried up to the house-top, and rescued\r\nthe child from the arms of the philosopher. Another time, three elder\r\nbrothers entered into a conspiracy, and locked up the fourth in the\r\nsmoke-house. Fortunately, he sounded the alarm loud and clear, and was\r\nset free in safety, whereupon the three were imprisoned in a garret\r\nwith two barred windows. They summarily kicked out the bars, and\r\nsliding down on the lightning-rod betook themselves to the barn for\r\nliberty. The youngest boy, then only five years old, skinned his hands\r\nin the descent. This is a fair sample of the quiet happiness I enjoyed\r\nin the first years of motherhood. It was 'mid such exhilarating scenes\r\nthat Miss Anthony and I wrote addresses for temperance, anti-slavery,\r\neducational and woman's rights conventions. Here we forged\r\nresolutions, protests, appeals, petitions, agricultural reports, and\r\nconstitutional arguments, for we made it a matter of conscience to\r\naccept every invitation to speak on every question, in order to\r\nmaintain woman's right to do so. To this end, we took turns on the\r\ndomestic watch-towers, directing amusements, settling disputes,\r\nprotecting the weak against the strong, and trying to secure equal\r\nrights to all in the home as well as the nation. I can recall many a\r\nstern encounter between my friend and the young experimenter. It is\r\npleasant to remember that he never seriously injured any of his\r\nvictims, and only once came near shooting himself with a pistol. The\r\nball went through his hand; happily a brass button prevented it from\r\npenetrating his heart.\r\n\r\n[83] When the flock reached the magic number of seven, my good angel\r\nwould sometimes take one or two to her own quiet home just out of\r\nRochester, where on a well-cultivated little farm, one could enjoy\r\nuninterrupted rest and the choicest fruits of the season. That was\r\nalways a safe harbor for my friend, as her family sympathized fully in\r\nthe reforms to which she gave her life. I have many pleasant memories\r\nof my own flying visits to that hospitable Quaker home and the broad\r\ncatholic spirit of Daniel and Lucy Anthony. Whatever opposition and\r\nridicule their daughter endured elsewhere, she enjoyed the steadfast\r\nsympathy and confidence of her own home circle. Her faithful sister\r\nMary, a most successful principal in the public schools of Rochester\r\nfor a quarter of a century, and a good financier, who with her\r\npatrimony and salary has laid by a competence, took on her shoulders\r\ndouble duty at home in cheering the declining years of her parents,\r\nthat Susan might do the public work in these reforms, in which the\r\nsisters were equally interested. At one time when Susan had expended\r\nher last dollar in the publication of her paper, _The Revolution_, and\r\nalso $5,000 given her by a wealthy cousin, Anson Lapham, Mary\r\ngenerously advanced another five thousand, and thus bridged the last\r\nchasm. And now with life's earnest work nearly accomplished, the\r\nsisters are living happily together, illustrating another of the many\r\ncharming homes of single women so rapidly multiplying in later years.\r\n\r\n[84] Mrs. Gage received a somewhat remarkable early training. Not only\r\nwas her father a man of profound thought, a reformer thoroughly\r\nstudying all the new questions coming up, but his house was a station\r\non the underground railroad, the home of anti-slavery speakers and\r\nadvanced thinkers upon every subject, as well as that of a large\r\nnumber of clergymen, who yearly held \"protracted meetings\" in the\r\nplace. Sitting up until midnight listening to the discussions of those\r\nreverend gentlemen upon baptism, original sin, predestination, and\r\nother doctrinal points, her thought was early turned to religious\r\nquestions. She read the Bible through before she was nine years old,\r\nand became a church member at the early age of eleven, her parents, in\r\naccordance with their habits, not attempting to influence her mind for\r\nor against this step.\r\n\r\nDr. Joslyn paid great attention to his daughter's education. From her\r\nearliest years it was a law of the household that her childish\r\nquestions should not be put off with an idle reply, but must be\r\nreasonably answered; and when she was older, he himself instructed her\r\nin mathematics, Greek, and physiology. But that for which she feels\r\nmost indebted to him, as she often says--the grandest training given\r\nher--was to think for herself. She was taught to accept no opinion\r\nbecause of its authority, but to question the truth of all things.\r\nThus was laid the foundation of Mrs. Gage's reform tendencies and of\r\nher non-acceptance of masculine authority in matters of religion and\r\npolitics. Nor was she, in a certain way, less indebted to her mother,\r\na Scotch lady, belonging to the noble, old, and influential family of\r\nLeslie, a woman of refined and elevated tastes, universally respected\r\nand beloved. From this side Mrs. Gage inherited her antiquarian tastes\r\nand habits of delving into old histories, from which she has unearthed\r\nso many facts bearing upon woman's degradation.\r\n\r\n[85] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[86] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[87] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[88] Gerrit Smith's home was ever a charming resort for lovers of\r\nliberty as well as lovers of Eve's daughters. In his leisure hours my\r\ncousin had a turn for match-making, and his chief delight in this\r\ndirection was to promote unions between good Abolitionists and the\r\nsons and daughters of conservative families. Here James G. Birney,\r\namong others, wooed and won his wife. Here one would meet the first\r\nfamilies in the State, with Indians, Africans, slaveholders,\r\nreligionists of all sects, and representatives of all shades of\r\nhumanity, each class alike welcomed and honored, feasting, feting,\r\ndancing--joining in all kinds of amusements and religious worship\r\ntogether (the Indians excepted, as they generally came for provisions,\r\nwhich, having secured, they departed). His house was one of the depots\r\nof the underground railroad. One day Mr. Smith summoned all the young\r\ngirls then visiting there, saying he had a great secret to tell them\r\nif they would sacredly pledge themselves not to divulge it. Having\r\ndone so, he led the way to the third story, ushered us into a large\r\nroom, and there stood a beautiful quadroon girl to receive us.\r\n\"Harriet,\" said Mr. Smith, \"I want you to make good Abolitionists of\r\nthese girls by describing to them all you have suffered in slavery.\"\r\nHe then left the room, locking us in. Her narrative held us\r\nspell-bound until the lengthening shadows of the twilight hour made\r\nher departure safe for Canada. One remark she made impressed me\r\ndeeply. I told her of the laws for women such as we then lived under,\r\nand remarked on the parallel condition of slaves and women. \"Yes,\"\r\nsaid she, \"but I am both. I am doubly damned in sex and color. Yea, in\r\nclass too, for I am poor and ignorant; none of you can ever touch the\r\ndepth of misery where I stand to-day.\" We had the satisfaction to see\r\nHarriet dressed in Quaker costume, closely veiled, drive off in the\r\nmoonlight that evening, to find the liberty she could not enjoy in\r\nthis Republic, under the shadow of a monarch's throne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n     First Steps in New York--Woman's Temperance Convention, Albany,\r\n     January, 1852--New York Woman's State Temperance Society,\r\n     Rochester, April, 1852--Women before the Legislature pleading for\r\n     a Maine Law--Women rejected as Delegates to Men's State\r\n     Conventions at Albany and Syracuse, 1852; at the Brick Church\r\n     Meeting and World's Temperance Convention in New York,\r\n     1858--Horace Greeley defends the Rights of Women in _The York\r\n     Tribune_--The Teachers' State Conventions--The Syracuse National\r\n     Woman's Rights Convention, 1852--Mob in the Broadway Tabernacle\r\n     Woman's Rights Convention through two days, 1853--State Woman's\r\n     Rights Convention at Rochester, December, 1853--Albany\r\n     Convention, February, 1854, and Hearing before the Legislature\r\n     demanding the Right of Suffrage--A State Committee\r\n     Appointed--Susan B.

In this\r\nState, the preliminary battles in the anti-slavery, temperance,\r\neducational, and religious societies were fought; the first\r\nGovernmental aid given to the higher education of woman, and her voice\r\nfirst heard in teachers' associations. Here the first Woman's Rights\r\nConvention was held, the first demand made for suffrage, the first\r\nsociety formed for this purpose, and the first legislative efforts\r\nmade to secure the civil and political rights of women; commanding the\r\nattention of leading members of the bar; of Savage, Spencer, Hertell,\r\nand Hurlbut. Here too the pulpit made the first demand for the\r\npolitical rights of woman. Here was the first temperance society\r\nformed by women, the first medical college opened to them, and woman\r\nfirst ordained for the ministry.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, in the city of Buffalo, 1,500 women petitioned the Common\r\nCouncil not to license the sale of intoxicating drinks; and the\r\nfollowing year, they sent a petition to the Legislature, signed by\r\n2,200, asking for an act authorizing some official body to take into\r\ncustody, and provide for the swarms of vagrant children, growing up in\r\nignorance and vice. This may be considered the initiative step to a\r\nBoard of Charities. In the same year, a number of spirited women in\r\nFulton, Oswego Co., disgusted with the inefficient action of the\r\ntemperance men, entered complaint against the liquor dealers, for the\r\nviolation of the license laws, and some of them attended the trials in\r\nperson. In 1851, the ladies of Cardiff, Onondaga Co., appeared before\r\nthe Grand Jury, and made complaint against the liquor dealers and\r\noverseers of the poor, the one for violating the law, the other for\r\nneglecting to prosecute the violators on their complaint, and they\r\nsucceeded in getting both indicted. In 1851, a petition was sent from\r\nOntario County, praying the Legislature to exempt women from taxation.\r\n\r\nSeptember 15, 1853, Antoinette L. Brown was ordained as pastor of a\r\nchurch in South Butler, and November 15, performed the ceremony at the\r\nmarriage of a daughter of Rhoda de Garmo, of Rochester. In this year,\r\nat a large Convention of liberal people, to promote Christian Union,\r\nheld in Syracuse, she made an address. All denominations took part on\r\nthe occasion and listened to her with respectful attention. In New\r\nYork, woman's voice was first heard on the Nation's great festal day.\r\nIn 1853, Mary Vaughan gave the fourth of July oration at Speedsville,\r\nEmily Clarke at Watkins, Amelia Bloomer at Hartford, and Antoinette\r\nBrown at South Butler. Everything on these occasions was conducted as\r\nusual: the grand procession to the grove, or town hall, the military\r\nescort, reading the Declaration, martial music, cannon, fire-crackers,\r\ntorpedoes, roast pig, and green peas; none of the usual accompaniments\r\nwere omitted. In the same year, Antoinette Brown and Lucy Stone\r\ncanvassed the twenty-second district, to secure the election of the\r\nHon. Gerrit Smith for Congress, and were successful in their efforts.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1854, the Daughters of Temperance at Johnson's Creek, sent\r\nthirty pieces of silver to Gov. Seymour, for vetoing a bill for a\r\nprohibitory law, and thus betraying the friends of temperance. In New\r\nYork, the first anti-tax association, the first woman's club and Loyal\r\nLeague were formed. Here, too, a woman, Mrs. Josephine Shaw Lowell,\r\nwas appointed State Commissioner of Charities, by Gov. Samuel J.\r\nTilden. Whether the Governor of any other State had preceded him in a\r\nmore profitable or honorable appointment, has not yet been discovered.\r\nLest women should feel too deep a sense of gratitude, they should\r\nunderstand that this office involves arduous labors, but no pecuniary\r\nrecompense. This may be a reason that such positions are being\r\ngradually assigned to women.\r\n\r\nAt the time of this general uprising, New York was thoroughly stirred\r\nwith temperance and anti-slavery excitement. George Thompson, the\r\ngreat English reformer and orator, who had been mobbed in all the\r\nchief cities of the North, accompanied by William Lloyd Garrison, was\r\nholding a series of conventions through the State. And as these\r\nconventions were held in the midst of the \"Jerry rescue trials,\"[89]\r\nthe apostles of freedom spoke with terrible vehemence and\r\ndenunciation. Popular orators, too, were rushing here and there in the\r\nfuror of a Presidential campaign, and as all these reforms were thrown\r\ninto the governmental cauldron for discussion, the whole people seemed\r\nto be on the watch towers of politics and philanthropy. Women shared\r\nin the general unrest, and began to take many steps before unknown.\r\nSince 1840, they had generally attended political meetings, as with\r\nthe introduction of moral questions into legislation, they had\r\nmanifested an increasing interest in government.\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the License Law of 1846, filled the temperance hosts\r\nthroughout the State with alarm, and roused many women to the\r\nassertion of their rights. Impoverished, broken-hearted wives and\r\nmothers, were for the first time looking to the State for some\r\nprotection against the cruelties and humiliations they endured at the\r\nhands of liquor dealers, when suddenly the beneficent law was\r\nrepealed, and their reviving hopes crushed. The burning indignation of\r\nwomen, who had witnessed the protracted outrages on helpless wives and\r\nchildren in the drunkard's home, roused many to public speech, and\r\ngave rise to the secret organizations called \"Daughters of\r\nTemperance.\" Others finding there was no law nor gospel in the land\r\nfor their protection, took the power in their own hands, visiting\r\nsaloons, breaking windows, glasses, bottles, and emptying demijohns\r\nand barrels into the streets. Coming like whirlwinds of vengeance,\r\ndrunkards and rum-sellers stood paralyzed before them. Though women\r\nwere sometimes arrested for these high-handed proceedings, a strong\r\npublic sentiment justified their acts, and forced the liquor dealers\r\nto withdraw their complaints.[90]\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more terrible than the reckless courage of despairing\r\nwomen, who, though knowing they have eternal truth and justice on\r\ntheir side, know also their helplessness against the tide of misery\r\nengulphing the drunkard's home. Women were applauded for these acts of\r\nheroism by the press and temperance leagues; they were welcomed too as\r\nspeakers sometimes on their platforms, just as slaves were in the\r\nolden days, to move an audience with their tales of woe. But when they\r\norganized themselves into associations, adopted constitutions, passed\r\nresolutions, and sent their delegates to men's conventions, asking to\r\nbe recognized as equals, then began the battle in the temperance\r\nranks, vindictive and protracted for years. The clergy were the most\r\nbitter opponents of the public action of women; but throughout the\r\nconflict they were sustained by the purest men in the nation, such as\r\nHorace Greeley, Joshua R. Giddings, Rev. E. H. Chapin, Rev. Samuel J.\r\nMay, Thomas W. Higginson, William H. Channing, Gerrit Smith, Wendell\r\nPhillips, William Lloyd Garrison, and others. All this persecution on\r\nthe ground of sex, intensified the love of liberty in woman's soul,\r\nand deepened the oft repeated lesson of individual rights.\r\n\r\nOn January 28, 1852, \"The Daughters of Temperance\" assembled in Albany\r\nto take part in a mass meeting of all the \"Divisions\" in the State.\r\nAmong the delegates present were Susan B. Anthony, Mary C. Vaughan,\r\nand Lydia Fowler, who were received as members of the Convention. But\r\nat the first attempt by Miss Anthony to speak, they were informed that\r\nthe ladies were invited to listen, and not to take part in the\r\nproceedings. Those women present who were not satisfied with such a\r\nposition withdrew, announcing that they would hold a meeting that\r\nevening in which men and women would stand on equal ground.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time they assembled in the vestry-room of the\r\nPresbyterian church on Hudson Street. Samuel J. May, who was in Albany\r\nattending one of the \"Jerrey Rescue Trials,\" was present, and opened\r\nthe meeting with prayer. Mrs. Vaughan was chosen President,[91] and on\r\ntaking the chair, said:\r\n\r\n     We have met to consider what we, as women, can do and may do, to\r\n     forward the temperance reform. We have met, because, as members\r\n     of the human family, we share in all the sufferings which error\r\n     and crime bring upon the race, and because we are learning that\r\n     our part in the drama of life is something beside inactive\r\n     suffering and passive endurance. We would act as well as endure;\r\n     and we meet here to-day because many of us have been trying to\r\n     act, and we would combine our individual experiences, and\r\n     together devise plans for the future, out of which shall arise\r\n     well-based hopes of good results to humanity. We are aware that\r\n     this proceeding of ours, this calling together of a body of women\r\n     to deliberate publicly upon plans to carry out a specified\r\n     reform, will rub rather harshly upon the mould of prejudice,\r\n     which has gathered thick upon the common mind.\r\n\r\n     .... There are plenty of women, as well as men, who can labor for\r\n     reforms without neglecting business or duty. It is an error that\r\n     clings most tenaciously to the public mind, that because a part\r\n     of the sex are wives and mothers and have absorbing duties, that\r\n     all the sex should be denied any other sphere of effort. To\r\n     deprive every unmarried woman, spinster, or widow, or every\r\n     childless wife, of the power of exercising her warm sympathies\r\n     for the good of others, is to deprive her of the greatest\r\n     happiness of which she is capable; to rob her highest faculties\r\n     of their legitimate operation and reward; to belittle and narrow\r\n     her mind; to dwarf her affections; to turn the harmonies of her\r\n     nature to discord; and, as the human mind must be active, to\r\n     compel her to employ hers with low and grovelling thoughts, which\r\n     lead to contemptible actions.\r\n\r\n     There is no reform in which woman can act better or more\r\n     appropriately than temperance. I know not how she can resist or\r\n     turn aside from the duty of acting in this; its effects fall so\r\n     crushingly upon her and those whose interests are identical with\r\n     her own; she has so often seen its slow, insidious, but not the\r\n     less surely fatal advances, gaining upon its victim; she has seen\r\n     the intellect which was her dearest pride, debased; the\r\n     affections which were her life-giving springs of action,\r\n     estranged; the children once loved, abused, disgraced and\r\n     impoverished; the home once an earthly paradise, rendered a fit\r\n     abode for lost spirits; has felt in her own person all the\r\n     misery, degradation, and woe of the drunkard's wife; has shrunk\r\n     from revilings and cowered beneath blows; has labored and toiled\r\n     to have her poor earnings transferred to the rum-seller's\r\n     ill-gotten hoard; while her children, ragged, fireless, poor,\r\n     starving, gathered shivering about her, and with hollow eyes,\r\n     from which all smiles had fled, begged vainly for the bread she\r\n     had not to bestow. Oh! the misery, the utter, hopeless misery of\r\n     the drunkard's wife!\r\n\r\n     .... We account it no reason why we should desist, when\r\n     conscience, an awakened sense of duty, and aroused\r\n     heart-sympathies, would lead us to show ourselves something\r\n     different than an impersonation of the vague ideal which has been\r\n     named, Woman, and with which woman has long striven to identify\r\n     herself. A creature all softness and sensibility, who must\r\n     necessarily enjoy and suffer in the extreme, while sharing with\r\n     man the pleasures and the ills of life; bearing happiness meekly,\r\n     and sorrow with fortitude; gentle, mild, submissive, forbearing\r\n     under all circumstances; a softened reflex of the opinions and\r\n     ideas of the masculines who, by relationship, hold mastery over\r\n     her; without individualism, a mere adjunct of man, the chief\r\n     object of whose creation was to adorn and beautify his existence,\r\n     or to minister to some form of his selfishness. This is nearly\r\n     the masculine idea of womanhood, and poor womanhood strives to\r\n     personify it. But not all women.\r\n\r\n     This is an age of iconoclasms; and daring hands are raised to\r\n     sweep from its pedestal, and dash to fragments, this false image\r\n     of woman. We care not how soon, if the true woman but take its\r\n     place. This is also, and most emphatically, an age of progress.\r\n     One old idea, one mouldering form of prejudice after another, is\r\n     rapidly swept away. Thought, written and spoken, acts upon the\r\n     mass of mind in this day of railroads and telegraphs, with a\r\n     thousandfold more celerity than in the days of pillions and slow\r\n     coaches. Scarce have the lips that uttered great thoughts ceased\r\n     to move, or the pen which wrote them dropped from the weary hand,\r\n     ere they vibrate through the inmost recesses of a thousand\r\n     hearts, and awaken deep and true responses in a thousand living,\r\n     truthful souls. Thence they grow, expand, fructify, and the\r\n     result is Progress.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lydia F. Fowler then gave several very touching recitals of the\r\nevils of intemperance in family circles within her own observation.\r\nHer lectures on Hygiene and Physiology through the State, illustrating\r\nas she did the effect of alcohol on the system, and pointing out to\r\nmothers what they could do to promote the health of their children,\r\nand thus ensure temperance and morality, were most effective in their\r\nbearings on this question. Letters were read from Elizabeth Cady\r\nStanton, Clarina Howard Nichols, and Amelia Bloomer.\r\n\r\n     Mr. MAY, on rising, said: The sudden and unjustifiable repeal of\r\n     the License Law of 1846, changed the face of the community, which\r\n     had everywhere brightened with new hope under the brief but\r\n     salutary operation of that law. That repeal, which it was\r\n     indecorous if not presumptuous in the representatives of the\r\n     people to make, seeing the law had been enacted directly by the\r\n     people in their primary assemblies; that repeal brought back all\r\n     the evils of intemperance aggravated by the successful efforts\r\n     which had been openly and covertly made to break down the\r\n     barriers which the law of 1846 had set up. The flood-gates of\r\n     this loathsome vice were slammed open, as if never to be shut\r\n     again. What I have seen and heard since I came to the capital,\r\n     has encouraged me not a little. I have met with gentlemen from\r\n     all parts of the State, who seem to be convinced that the people\r\n     are ready for the passage of a stringent law similar to that\r\n     which has recently gone into operation in Maine.\r\n\r\n     But I am particularly encouraged that the women of the State have\r\n     made an especial and somewhat novel movement in this behalf. It\r\n     has in all ages of the world been ominous when the women of a\r\n     country have come out of the retirement they generally choose, to\r\n     take a public part in the affairs of the State. What if this\r\n     Convention be not a large one, it is significant nevertheless. I\r\n     could cite you to a reform in our own country which commenced\r\n     with less than twelve individuals twenty years ago, and now that\r\n     reform has drawn into its vortex all the living spirits in the\r\n     land, and has created an agitation of the public mind that will\r\n     never be quelled until Slavery is buried out of sight forever. If\r\n     the women of New York will act up to the noble sentiments that\r\n     have been expressed in the addresses and letters written by women\r\n     to this Convention, great and glorious results must follow. And\r\n     there are especial reasons why women should be earnest in this\r\n     cause. Their sex, though not so much addicted as ours to the use\r\n     of intoxicating drinks, suffers more from the effects of the\r\n     evil. To them it is the destruction of all domestic peace, the\r\n     wreck of all conjugal and maternal hopes; it is ignorance,\r\n     poverty, misery, for themselves and children. My own attention\r\n     was first called to this reform by the sufferings of women. (Mr.\r\n     May here related several touching anecdotes of most estimable\r\n     women he had known, devoted wives, mothers, sisters, daughters,\r\n     who had been utterly despoiled of all earthly comfort by the\r\n     intemperance of those they loved).\r\n\r\n     At one time I thought this evil might be repressed by man alone;\r\n     but I have learned that humanity is dual. God made man male and\r\n     female. The sexes are equally concerned in the welfare of the\r\n     race. What God has joined together must not be put asunder. Women\r\n     are constituent parts of the State and the Church, as well as of\r\n     the home; and their influence is as indispensable to the\r\n     well-being of the former as the latter. A State or Church that\r\n     excludes woman from its councils, is like a family without a\r\n     mother, in a condition of half orphanage.\r\n\r\n     In the days of our Revolution women made as many sacrifices and\r\n     endured as great sufferings for independence, as did the men. It\r\n     is most ungrateful when we are speaking of that event, and the\r\n     actors in it, not to make mention of our Revolutionary Mothers.\r\n     In the French Revolution women were conspicuous actors. If Madame\r\n     Roland and her coadjutors had been allowed to sway the public\r\n     councils, the results would have been far happier for France.\r\n\r\n     In moral revolutions women have ever signalized themselves. It\r\n     was a woman, Elizabeth Fry, who in England commenced the reform\r\n     in the discipline of prisons, and prosecuted it in person for\r\n     years, until she had proven her plans feasible, and inspired\r\n     others with a faith like her own. It was Dorothea Dix (a very\r\n     delicately organized woman), who first in this country recognized\r\n     the claims and acknowledged the rights of the insane. She found\r\n     these poor victims of man's ignorance everywhere suffering\r\n     terrible hardships. They were dreaded by all, and abhorred by\r\n     many who had charge of them, and believed to be incapable of\r\n     suffering as sane people suffer, and to be beyond the reach of\r\n     those kindly influences which more than all others control those\r\n     who are in their right minds. Miss Dix penetrated their\r\n     cheerless, dark, damp abodes. She brought to light the wrongs\r\n     that were inflicted upon them. She exposed the folly of the fears\r\n     which were entertained of them. She showed by her own courageous\r\n     experiments that even furious maniacs could be controlled by the\r\n     spirit of Christian love. The asylums in many of our States\r\n     to-day are noble monuments to the inestimable value of her\r\n     services.\r\n\r\n     When Miss Dix first visited the insane department of the jail in\r\n     Cambridge, to look after one miserable human being she had\r\n     chanced to hear was immured there, she little thought of the\r\n     career of benevolent effort and of high distinction as a\r\n     philanthropist that was opening before her. She went only to give\r\n     relief to a solitary sufferer. But the dejected, helpless and\r\n     wretched condition in which she found the insane there, raised\r\n     the inquiry in her mind whether it could be that the same class\r\n     of unfortunates were treated in this wise elsewhere. Such an\r\n     inquiry could not be suppressed in a heart like hers; it urged\r\n     her on to further investigation. It led to new developments of\r\n     the methods that philanthropists and scientists were advocating\r\n     in France. She came at last to feel that she had a mission to\r\n     that class of \"the lost ones,\" and she has fulfilled it\r\n     gloriously. She has been the angel of the Lord to the insane in\r\n     almost all the States of the Union.\r\n\r\n     The Anti-Slavery cause in both England and America, owes as much\r\n     to woman as to man. If in Great Britain the suppression of the\r\n     African slave trade was commenced by men, the abolition of West\r\n     India slavery was begun by women; and it is acknowledged that\r\n     they did more than the men to accomplish the overthrow of that\r\n     system of all imaginable wickedness, which, while it endured,\r\n     stimulated the cupidity of the slave-trader, so that he\r\n     prosecuted his accursed traffic as much as ever, notwithstanding\r\n     the acts of the American Congress and the British Parliament. In\r\n     our country the most efficient, untiring laborers in the\r\n     anti-slavery cause, have from the beginning been women. Lydia\r\n     Maria Child, a lady highly distinguished among the authors of\r\n     America, was the first to publish a sizable book upon slavery.\r\n     Its very title was a pregnant one, viz, \"An Appeal in behalf of\r\n     that Class of Americans called Africans.\" Its contents were of\r\n     great and permanent value. The publication of that volume was to\r\n     her a costly sacrifice of popularity as an author. At a very\r\n     early period of the enterprise, Elizabeth M. Chandler published\r\n     many essays and poems that will live forever. The bravery and\r\n     persistence of Prudence Crandall in maintaining a school for\r\n     colored girls in Connecticut, in the face of terrible\r\n     persecution, is beyond praise. Maria Weston Chapman, since 1834,\r\n     has been among the leaders of the anti-slavery host, directing\r\n     their movements and stimulating them to effort. Lucretia Mott,\r\n     Sarah Pugh, Eliza Lee Follen, Abby Kelly, Mary Grew, are all\r\n     worthy of mention--there is no end to the names of excellent,\r\n     wise, courageous women who have contended nobly for the\r\n     anti-slavery faith and practice. They have been traduced,\r\n     reviled, persecuted, but nothing has deterred them from\r\n     advocating the rights of humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK STATE TEMPERANCE CONVENTION,\r\n\r\nROCHESTER, N. Y., _April 20 and 21, 1852_.\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock a large audience assembled in Corinthian Hall. The\r\nmorning session was composed entirely of women; more than five hundred\r\nbeing present. The meeting was called to order by Susan B. Anthony,\r\nwho read the following call that had been extensively circulated\r\nthroughout the State:\r\n\r\n     The women of the State of New York who desire to aid in advancing\r\n     the cause of Temperance, and are willing to labor earnestly and\r\n     truthfully for its success, are respectfully invited to meet at\r\n     Corinthian Hall in the city of Rochester on the 20th of April,\r\n     for the purpose of devising, maturing, and recommending such a\r\n     course of associated action as shall best subserve for the\r\n     protection of their interests and of society at large, too long\r\n     invaded and destroyed by legalized intemperance. Feeling that\r\n     woman has hitherto been greatly responsible for the continuance\r\n     of this vice by encouraging social drinking, and by not\r\n     sufficiently exerting her influence for its overthrow, and\r\n     realizing that upon her rest the heaviest burthens which follow\r\n     in its train, the Committee are convinced that they will be\r\n     sustained by all good men and women in urging upon the sex such\r\n     noble and energetic action as shall tend to the downfall of the\r\n     traffic in intoxicating drinks.\r\n\r\n     Arrangements have been made to render the occasion one of\r\n     interest to all friends of the cause. Addresses and\r\n     communications from both ladies and gentlemen of known ability\r\n     will be presented, and a general and comprehensive plan of\r\n     operation proposed, whereby woman may aid in the promotion of a\r\n     cause which appeals to her sympathy through the avenue of every\r\n     relation which binds her to the race.\r\n\r\n     It is earnestly hoped that this meeting will be numerously\r\n     attended.[92]\r\n\r\n          SUSAN B. ANTHONY, H. ATTILIA ALBRO, AND MARY C. VAUGHAN,\r\n                                                _Central Committee_.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Convention were then chosen. Elizabeth Cady\r\nStanton, President,[93] who on rising said:\r\n\r\n     I fully appreciate, ladies, the compliment intended, in choosing\r\n     me to fill this place on an occasion of such interest and\r\n     importance. If a sincere love for the principles of temperance, a\r\n     fervent zeal in the welfare of woman, and an unwavering faith in\r\n     the final triumph of truth, fits one for this post of honor, then\r\n     am I not unworthy, though I must confess myself, from the novelty\r\n     of the position, ignorant alike of the rights and duties of the\r\n     office of President. I shall deeply regret if in any omissions or\r\n     commissions of duty I fail to reflect back on this Convention a\r\n     full share of the honor now conferred upon me.\r\n\r\n     How my heart throbs to see women assembling in convention to\r\n     inquire what part they have in the great moral struggles of\r\n     humanity! Verily a new era is dawning upon the world, when\r\n     woman, hitherto the mere dependent of man, the passive recipient\r\n     alike of truth and error, at length shakes off her lethargy, the\r\n     shackles of a false education, customs and habits, and stands\r\n     upright in the dignity of a moral being, and not only proclaims\r\n     her own freedom, but demands what she shall do to save man from\r\n     the slavery of his own low appetites. We have come together at\r\n     this time to consult each other as to what woman may do in\r\n     banishing the vice of intemperance from the land. We can do much\r\n     by years of preparation and education of ourselves, for a great\r\n     moral revolution will burst forth with the regeneration of woman.\r\n     We shall do much when the pulpit, the forum, the professor's\r\n     chair, and the ballot-box are ours; but the question is, what can\r\n     we do to-day, under existing circumstances, under all the adverse\r\n     influences that surround us? I will briefly mention several\r\n     points for your consideration that have suggested themselves to\r\n     my mind.\r\n\r\n     1. Let no woman remain in the relation of wife with the confirmed\r\n     drunkard. Let no drunkard be the father of her children. Let no\r\n     woman form an alliance with any man who has been suspected even\r\n     of the vice of intemperance; for the taste once acquired can\r\n     never, never be eradicated. Be not misled by any pledges,\r\n     resolves, promises, prayers, or tears. You can not rely on the\r\n     word of a man who is, or has been, the victim of such an\r\n     overpowering appetite.\r\n\r\n     2. Let us petition our State governments so to modify the laws\r\n     affecting marriage, and the custody of children, that the\r\n     drunkard shall have no claims on either wife or child.\r\n\r\n     3. Let us touch not, taste not, handle not, the unclean thing in\r\n     any combination. Let us eschew it in all culinary purposes, and\r\n     refuse it in all its most tempting and refined forms.\r\n\r\n     4. With an efficient organization, lectures, tracts, newspapers,\r\n     and discussion, we shall accomplish much. I would give more for\r\n     the agitation of any question on sound principles, thus\r\n     enlightening and convincing the public mind, than for all the\r\n     laws that could be written or passed in a century. By the\r\n     foolishness of preaching, must all moral revolutions be achieved;\r\n     but remember the truth, the whole truth must be faithfully\r\n     preached.\r\n\r\n     5. We must raise the standard of temperance in all things. The\r\n     man who over-eats takes a little wine to aid digestion, and he\r\n     who exhausts himself by licentious indulgence takes a little as a\r\n     stimulus; thus one vice induces another, and all go hand in hand\r\n     together.\r\n\r\n     6. Let us endeavor to make labor honorable in all. Work is\r\n     worship, says Emerson. Let us honor the hard hand and sun-burnt\r\n     brow. Remember idleness is the parent of vice; and there is no\r\n     surer way to banish vice from our land, than to see that the\r\n     young just coming on the stage of life are wisely and fully\r\n     employed.\r\n\r\n     And lastly, inasmuch as charity begins at home, let us withdraw\r\n     our mite from all associations for sending the Gospel to the\r\n     heathen across the ocean, for the education of young men for the\r\n     ministry, for the building up of a theological aristocracy and\r\n     gorgeous temples, to the unknown God, and devote ourselves to the\r\n     poor and suffering about us. Let us feed and clothe the hungry\r\n     and naked, gather children into schools, and provide\r\n     reading-rooms and decent homes for young men and women thrown\r\n     alone upon the world. Good schools and homes where the young\r\n     could ever be surrounded by an atmosphere of purity and virtue,\r\n     would do much more to prevent immorality and crime in our cities\r\n     than all the churches in the land could ever possibly do toward\r\n     the regeneration of the multitude sunk in poverty, ignorance, and\r\n     vice.\r\n\r\nSusan B. Anthony, Chairman of the Central Committee, addressed the\r\nmeeting in a clear, forcible manner, alluding to the indifference\r\nmanifested by many women on the subject of temperance, and stated the\r\nobject of calling the women of the State together at this time. She\r\nread letters[94] from Frances Dana Gage, Clarina Howard Nichols,\r\nElizabeth Oakes Smith, Abby Kelly Foster, and Horace Greeley. In the\r\ndiscussion of the resolutions[95] during the different sessions, Giles\r\nB. Stebbins, Benjamin Fish, William Barnes, Amy Post, Mrs. Albro, Mrs.\r\nVaughan, William C. Bloss, George W. Clark, and the Rev. Mr. Goodwin,\r\nall took part. One resolution denouncing Mr. Gale, a State Senator,\r\nfor his insulting epithets in regard to the women who had petitioned\r\nfor a Maine law, called down on that gentleman some well-deserved\r\nreprimands. The Rev. Mr. Goodwin expressed his indignation and shame,\r\nthat any man of education and position should use such language in\r\nspeaking of women who were so faithfully laboring in all the great\r\nreforms of the day. Mrs. Bloomer in the course of her remarks also\r\ncriticised Mr. Gale for saying in a sneering way \"that representatives\r\nwere not accustomed to listen to the voice of woman in legislating\r\nupon great public questions; that the constitution of the female mind\r\nwas such as to render woman incapable of correctly deciding upon the\r\npoints involved in the passage of the proposed bill.\" After rousing\r\nthe attention of the people of the State by large and enthusiastic\r\nmeetings in all the chief cities, and sending into the Legislature a\r\nmammoth petition for a Maine law, this was woman's answer. On the\r\nDivorce resolution,\r\n\r\n     Mrs. BLOOMER said: We believe the teachings which have been given\r\n     to the drunkard's wife touching her duty--the commendable\r\n     examples of angelic wives which she has been exhorted to follow,\r\n     have done much to continue and aggravate the vices and crimes of\r\n     society growing out of intemperance. Drunkenness is good ground\r\n     for divorce, and every woman who is tied to a confirmed drunkard\r\n     should sunder the ties; and if she do it not otherwise the law\r\n     should compel it--especially if she have children.\r\n\r\n     We are told that such sentiments are \"exceptional,\" \"abhorrent,\"\r\n     that the moral sense of society is shocked and outraged by their\r\n     promulgation. Can it be possible that the moral sense of a people\r\n     is more shocked at the idea of a pure-minded, gentle woman\r\n     sundering the ties which bind her to a loathsome mass of\r\n     corruption, than it is to see her dragging out her days in\r\n     misery, tied to his besotted and filthy carcass? Are the morals\r\n     of society less endangered by the drunkard's wife continuing to\r\n     live in companionship with him, giving birth to a large family of\r\n     children who inherit naught but poverty and disgrace, and who\r\n     will grow up criminal and vicious, filling our prisons and\r\n     penitentiaries and corrupting and endangering the purity and\r\n     peace of community, than they would be, should she separate from\r\n     him and strive to win for herself and the children she may have,\r\n     comfort and respectability? The statistics of our prisons,\r\n     poor-houses, and lunatic asylums, teach us a fearful lesson on\r\n     this subject of morals.\r\n\r\n     The idea of living with a drunkard is so abhorrent, so revolting\r\n     to all the finer feelings of our nature, that a woman must fall\r\n     very low before she can endure such companionship. Every\r\n     pure-minded woman must look with loathing and disgust upon such a\r\n     union of virtue and vice; and he who would compel her to it, or\r\n     dissuade the drunkard's wife from separating herself from such\r\n     wretchedness and degradation, is doing much to perpetuate\r\n     drunkenness and crime, and is wanting in the noblest feelings of\r\n     human nature. Thanks to our Legislature, if they have not given\r\n     us the Maine law, they are deliberating upon the propriety of\r\n     giving to the wives of drunkards and tyrants a loop-hole of\r\n     escape from the brutal cruelty of their self-styled lords and\r\n     masters. A bill of this kind has passed the House, but may be\r\n     lost in the Senate. Should it not pass now, it will be brought up\r\n     again, and passed at no distant day. Then if women have any\r\n     spirit, they will free themselves from much of the oppression and\r\n     wrong which they have hitherto of necessity borne.\r\n\r\nA brief address was read by Mrs. Robinson, of Darien. This woman had\r\nbeen for many years the wife of a drunkard; she had overcome many\r\nobstacles to attend this Convention for the purpose of relating her\r\nexperience, and offering words of encouragement. Her narration of the\r\ntrials and sufferings she had endured was very affecting. She fully\r\nendorsed the tenth resolution, \"That the woman who consents to live in\r\nthe relation of wife with a confirmed drunkard, is, in so doing,\r\nrecreant to the cause of humanity, and to the dignity of a true\r\nwomanhood.\"\r\n\r\nAn organization was effected called \"The Woman's New York State\r\nTemperance Society\"; large numbers of the members of the Convention\r\nsigned the Constitution, and elected Elizabeth Cady Stanton\r\nPresident[96]. A vote of thanks was passed to Horace Greeley for the\r\nkind manner in which he had uniformly sustained the women in their\r\ntemperance efforts in _The New York Tribune_, and after six long\r\nsessions, the Convention adjourned.\r\n\r\nAs President of \"The Woman's State Temperance Society,\" Mrs. Stanton\r\nissued a plain, strong appeal to the women of the State in which it\r\nwas said woman's rights predominated over temperance. The strong point\r\nshe uniformly pressed on the temperance question was the right and\r\nduty of divorce for drunkenness. A letter of hers to the Convention in\r\nAlbany on this point, was so radical, that the friends feared to read\r\nit; however, after much discussion, Susan B. Anthony took the\r\nresponsibility. It was read to the Convention, and published in _The\r\nLily_ and other papers, and called out many condemnatory notices by\r\nthe press. _The Troy Journal_ was much excited at the idea of \"a\r\nvirtuous woman severing the tie that bound her to a confirmed\r\ndrunkard,\" and spoke of such a union of virtue and vice as a \"divine\r\ninstitution,\" sacred in the eye of the \"divine author,\" and declared\r\nMrs. Stanton's teachings \"reviling Christianity.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, these bold utterances roused the consciences of many women to\r\nthe sinfulness of such relations, and encouraged them in sundering\r\nsuch unholy ties.\r\n\r\nAt the Rochester Convention, Gerrit Smith, Susan B. Anthony, and\r\nAmelia Bloomer were appointed delegates to \"The Men's State Temperance\r\nSociety,\" to be held in June, at Syracuse. The call for the meeting\r\ncontained these words, \"Temperance associations of every name are\r\ninvited to send delegates.\" Hence the Woman's State Society being\r\nearnestly enlisted in the good work, responded to this invitation.\r\nMiss Anthony and Mrs. Bloomer accepted the appointment, and on\r\narriving at Syracuse, found many of the delegates already there, and\r\neverything indicating a large Convention. The next morning, while\r\npreparing to go to the hall, a gentleman was announced, who wished to\r\nsee them in the parlor. On descending thither, they were happy to meet\r\nSamuel J. May. He came to inform them that their arrival had created\r\ngreat excitement among some of the clergy, who were shocked at the\r\nidea of women delegates to the Convention, and threatened if they were\r\nadmitted, to withdraw. This had alarmed others who were not quite so\r\nconservative, but who feared to have anything occur to create\r\ndisturbance. They had persuaded Mr. May to wait upon the ladies and\r\nurge them quietly to withdraw. Mr. May performed his part well, merely\r\nstating the facts of the case, and leaving them to act upon their own\r\njudgment. But when they decided to present their credentials and\r\ndemand their rights as members of the Convention, his face beamed with\r\njoy, as he said to them, \"You are right.\" At the appointed time they\r\nwere seated with other ladies in attendance at the side of the\r\nplatform. Presently Rev. Dr. Mandeville, of Albany, arose, turned his\r\nchair facing them, his back to the audience, and stared at them with\r\nall the impudence of a boor, as if to wither them with his piercing\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM H. BURLEIGH, says _The Lily_,[97] read the annual report,\r\n     which, among other things, \"hailed the formation of the Woman's\r\n     State Society as a valuable auxiliary in the cause of\r\n     temperance.\" Rev. J. Marsh moved that the report be accepted and\r\n     adopted.\r\n\r\n     Dr. MANDEVILLE objected in a speech of some length, characterized\r\n     by more venom and vulgarity than it had ever before been our\r\n     fortune to hear; and such as the most foul-mouthed politician or\r\n     bar-room orator would have hesitated to utter before respectable\r\n     audiences. He denounced the Woman's State Temperance Society, and\r\n     all women who took an active public part in promoting the cause.\r\n     Spoke contemptuously of woman going from home to attend a\r\n     temperance convention, and characterized such as a sort of\r\n     \"hybrid species, half man and half woman, belonging to neither\r\n     sex.\" The short dress and woman's rights questions were \"handled\r\n     without gloves.\" These movements must be put down; cut up root\r\n     and branch, etc., etc., and finally his Reverence wound up with a\r\n     threat that if the report was adopted without striking out the\r\n     offensive sentence he would dissolve his connection with the\r\n     Society. Having thus discharged his venom, and issued his\r\n     commands, he took his hat and with a pompous air left the house\r\n     and did not again show himself at the meetings.\r\n\r\n     A warm discussion followed the motion for striking out, which it\r\n     would be impossible to describe. Mr. Havens, of New York, offered\r\n     an amendment--substituting a sort of unmeaning compliment to the\r\n     ladies, and asking their influence in their proper sphere--the\r\n     domestic circle. The discussion was kept up, but amid the\r\n     confusion of \"Mr. President!\" \"Mr. President!\" \"Order!\" \"Order!\"\r\n     \"I have the floor!\" \"I will speak, right or wrong!\" from at\r\n     least half a dozen voices, until all lost sight of both motion\r\n     and amendment.\r\n\r\n     Miss Anthony arose and addressed the Chair, but was at once\r\n     called to order by Rev. Fowler, of Utica. He denied woman's right\r\n     to speak in that meeting. Here the confusion again began. \"Mr.\r\n     President!\" \"Mr. President!\" \"Order!\" \"Order!\" \"Hear the lady!\"\r\n     \"Hear the lady!\" \"Let her speak!\" \"Let her speak!\" \"Go on, go\r\n     on!\" \"Order! order!\" in the midst of which the president left the\r\n     chair, and said if there was any gentleman present who could keep\r\n     order he would thank him to take the chair; he could hear nothing\r\n     when so many were talking at once, and if order was not preserved\r\n     he would not attempt to preside. A moment's quiet followed, and\r\n     then all was confusion again. The conservatives were determined\r\n     to have their way, and nearly every attempt on the part of the\r\n     liberals to make themselves heard was frustrated.\r\n\r\n     A. N. COLE, of Belfast, succeeded in keeping the floor a few\r\n     moments, and spoke ably in defence of woman and of her right to\r\n     be heard. He declared that man had no more right to prescribe\r\n     woman's sphere and mark out a course of action for her, than she\r\n     had to prescribe man's sphere and dictate his course of action.\r\n     Woman had ever been untiring and earnest in her labors in this\r\n     cause, and he was ready at all times and everywhere to\r\n     acknowledge her aid, and hail her as a co-worker. He insisted\r\n     that woman had a right to be heard on that floor; that she was\r\n     there on the invitation of the Society, and they could not refuse\r\n     her a voice in the proceedings.\r\n\r\n     But points of order were raised, and a determination manifested\r\n     not to permit a fair discussion of the subject. The Chair was at\r\n     length appealed to for a decision. He decided that the letter of\r\n     the Constitution of the State Society, and also the call for this\r\n     meeting would admit woman to an equal participation in the\r\n     proceedings, and allow her a vote; but as there were no female\r\n     societies in existence five years ago when this Society was\r\n     organized, such a thing was not contemplated at that time; he\r\n     therefore considered her inadmissible. \"The letter of the\r\n     Constitution and call would admit her, but the spirit would not.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Camp must have been very ignorant not to know that ten years\r\n     before there were efficient woman's temperance societies all over\r\n     the State. He was doubtless right in saying that such a thing as\r\n     a woman presuming to speak or vote in the meetings of that\r\n     Society was not contemplated by its founders, but he greatly\r\n     erred in giving a reason for their short-sightedness.\r\n\r\n     The decision of the Chair was appealed from, and the excitement\r\n     continued. All tried to talk at the same time, but those\r\n     possessing more firmness than others succeeded in having their\r\n     say; while the opponents of woman were allowed to express their\r\n     sentiments freely, those in favor were called to order and forced\r\n     to yield the floor. The decision of the Chair was finally\r\n     sustained by two votes. As the delegates had not been required to\r\n     make themselves known, it was not ascertained how many were\r\n     present, or who they were; nor how many persons in the crowd\r\n     voted who had no right to do so. All men were permitted to vote,\r\n     without its even being known whether they were temperance men or\r\n     not.\r\n\r\n     And so, after spending the whole afternoon in hot discussion of\r\n     the woman's rights question, the disgraceful affair terminated by\r\n     refusing woman the right of uttering her sentiments on a subject\r\n     in which she was deeply interested, and of pleading in behalf of\r\n     the poor crushed victims of man's injustice and cruelty.\r\n\r\nRev. Luther Lee offered his church just before the adjournment, and\r\nMr. May announced that Miss Anthony and Mrs. Bloomer would speak there\r\nin the evening. They had a crowded house, while the conservatives had\r\nscarce fifty people. The general feeling was hostile to the action of\r\nthe Convention. This same battle on the temperance platform was fought\r\nover and over in various parts of the State, and the most deadly\r\nopposition uniformly came from the clergy, though a few noble men in\r\nthat profession ever remained true to principle through all the\r\nconflicts of those days, in the anti-slavery, temperance, and woman's\r\nrights movements.\r\n\r\n\r\n            SUSAN B. ANTHONY'S LETTER, FROM THE \"CARSON LEAGUE.\"\r\n\r\n                                         BUFFALO, _July 28, 1852_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR LEAGUE:--Permit me to say a few words to your readers,\r\n     relative to the plan of action, recommended by the \"Women's New\r\n     York State Temperance Society.\" We have now three agents\r\n     lecturing, who are endeavoring, by a novel application of woman's\r\n     \"marvelous gift of tongue,\" to rouse their sisters of Western New\r\n     York, to render active service in aid of the Temperance cause.\r\n     Woman has so long been accustomed to \"non-intervention\" with the\r\n     business of law-making--so long considered it men's business to\r\n     regulate the Liquor Traffic, that it is with much cautiousness\r\n     that she receives the new doctrine which we preach; the doctrine\r\n     that it is her right and her duty to speak out against the liquor\r\n     traffic and all men and institutions that in any way sanction,\r\n     sustain, or countenance it; and since she can not vote, to duly\r\n     instruct her husband, father, or brother how she would have him\r\n     vote, and if he longer continue to misrepresent her, take the\r\n     right to march to the ballot-box, with firm, unwavering tread,\r\n     and deposit a vote indicative of her highest ideas of practical\r\n     temperance. For women longer to submit to be ruled by men and\r\n     legislators who sanction license laws, is to act the part of\r\n     slaves and cowards. Men are just beginning to see that they must\r\n     carry this temperance question into politics, but can see no\r\n     farther than to vote for a rum-drinking President,\r\n     Vice-President, and Congressmen. If they can place temperance men\r\n     in those offices which directly control the license system of our\r\n     own State, they seem to think they need look to, nor care for,\r\n     the habits and principles of the men who fill the National\r\n     offices. And it is for woman now, in the present Presidential\r\n     campaign, to say to her husband, father, or brother, if you vote\r\n     for any candidate for any office whatever, who is not pledged to\r\n     total abstinence and the Maine law, we shall hold you alike\r\n     guilty with the rum-seller. He who loves not humanity better\r\n     than his whig or loco partyism, is not worthy the name of man nor\r\n     the love and respect of woman. But to our Society.\r\n\r\n     We recommend that women form temperance societies in their\r\n     respective cities, towns, and villages, which shall be auxiliary\r\n     to the State Association. The work which we propose to do is a\r\n     missionary one. We therefore suggest the name \"Temperance Home\r\n     Missionary Society,\" whose object shall be to raise funds, by\r\n     means of an admission fee and donations, to be expended in\r\n     subscribing for temperance newspapers, for gratuitous\r\n     distribution among all families, both rich and poor, who do not\r\n     furnish themselves with such reading. During the last two weeks I\r\n     have visited several villages in Genesee and Erie Counties, have\r\n     found the women ready for work, and now and then a temperance man\r\n     who had taken in the whole idea of political action.\r\n\r\n     Home Missionary Societies are formed in all of the places visited\r\n     except two, and will doubtless soon be in those. I recommend them\r\n     to take _The Lily_ and _Carson League_. _The Lily_, because it is\r\n     particularly devoted to woman's interest in temperance and\r\n     kindred reforms, and because it is their duty to sustain the only\r\n     paper in the State owned and edited by a woman. _The Carson\r\n     League_, because it presents and advocates a definite plan for\r\n     temperance political action. It is to be hoped that the State\r\n     Alliance, at its session at Rochester, the 18th of August, will\r\n     make converts not only of all the professed temperance men of\r\n     Western New York, but of all the temperance newspapers. Alliances\r\n     must be formed in every county and town of the State. An\r\n     additional clause must be appended to the pledge, \"that no member\r\n     of the Society shall vote for any officer who is not an open and\r\n     avowed total abstinence man, and pledged to use his influence to\r\n     secure the enactment of the Maine law.\" There must be concert of\r\n     action; every man must know exactly how and for whom all other\r\n     men of the State are going to vote. Let there be combined\r\n     political action and the Maine law is ours.\r\n\r\n                         Yours for Temperance Politics,\r\n                                                              S. B. A.\r\n\r\nDuring this year the Society was active, its agents visiting nearly\r\nevery county, forming auxiliary societies, circulating tracts and\r\npetitions, and rolling up subscribers to _The Lily_.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1853, a great mass-meeting of all the temperance\r\norganizations of the State was held in Albany. Nearly every hall and\r\nchurch in the city was occupied, with different associations of men\r\nand women. \"The Woman's Society\" met in the Baptist church in State\r\nStreet, which was crowded at every session. Susan B. Anthony presided.\r\nEmily Clark, Mrs. Bloomer, Mrs. Vaughan and Mrs. Albro were appointed\r\na committee to present to the Legislature a petition signed by 28,000\r\nwomen for a prohibitory law. On motion of S. M. Burroughs, of Orleans,\r\nthe rules of the House were suspended and the ladies invited to the\r\nSpeaker's desk. In a brief and dignified speech, Miss Clark presented\r\nthe petition, after which they returned to the Convention, and\r\nreported the success of their mission, in full confidence that their\r\nprayers would be answered. But alas! they forgot that women were a\r\ndisfranchised class, and that legislators give no heed to the claims\r\nof such for protection.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, the ladies had two immense meetings, one in the\r\nchurch, and one in the Assembly Chamber of the Capitol. At the latter,\r\nSusan B. Anthony read Mrs. Stanton's \"Appeal to the Legislature,\" and\r\naddresses were made by Mary C. Vaughan and Antoinette Brown; the\r\ngalleries as well as the floor of the house being literally packed;\r\nwhile at the former, Mrs. Bloomer, Mrs. Fowler, Mrs. Albro, and Miss\r\nClark addressed an equally crowded audience.\r\n\r\nFollowing this Convention, Mrs. Bloomer, Miss Brown, and Miss Anthony\r\nwent to New York, on the invitation of S. P. Townsend, and addressed\r\n3,000 people in Metropolitan Hall; Lydia F. Fowler presided; Mr. and\r\nMrs. Horace Greeley, Abby Hopper Gibbons, and other prominent\r\ngentlemen and ladies sat on the platform. They also addressed large\r\naudiences in the Broadway Tabernacle and Knickerbocker Hall, and in\r\nBrooklyn. And during March and April made a most successful tour\r\nthrough the State, speaking at Sing Sing, Poughkeepsie, Hudson, Troy,\r\nCohoes, Utica, Syracuse, Rochester, Lockport, Buffalo, and many of the\r\nsmaller cities, and were greeted everywhere with large audiences and\r\nthe most respectful attention from both press and people.\r\n\r\n     _The New York Tribune_, under the heading of GREAT GATHERING OF\r\n     THE WOMEN OF NEW YORK, said of their Metropolitan meeting: The\r\n     Women's Grand Temperance Demonstration at Metropolitan Hall last\r\n     evening, was a most brilliant and successful affair. The audience\r\n     which assembled on that occasion to welcome Mrs. Bloomer and her\r\n     assistants in the cause of Temperance, was almost as large and\r\n     fully as respectable as the audiences that nightly greeted Jenny\r\n     Lind and Catharine Hays during their engagement in that hall.\r\n     Good order was observed throughout the evening, and earnest and\r\n     hearty applause was frequent. The only hissing evidently intended\r\n     for the speakers was when Mrs. Bloomer reviewed the sentiments of\r\n     Hon. Horace Mann relative to woman; and then the plaudits came to\r\n     her rescue and triumphantly sustained the speaker. The audience\r\n     was a smiling one; some smiled at the novelty of the occasion;\r\n     others with admiration; the latter, judging from the twinkling of\r\n     eyes and clapping of hands, were in the majority. While some\r\n     evidently writhed under the application of the lash for their\r\n     disregard of the principles of temperance; others enjoyed the\r\n     rigor of the infliction and manifested their satisfaction by\r\n     applause.\r\n\r\n     The _New York Evening Post_ said: The first meeting of the\r\n     Women's Temperance Society was held last evening in Metropolitan\r\n     Hall. There were about three thousand persons present, a large\r\n     proportion of whom were ladies. It was the first time that an\r\n     audience in this hall was to be addressed by women, and the\r\n     novelty of the occasion doubtless attracted a large number who\r\n     would otherwise have been absent. The proceedings, however, were\r\n     conducted in the most orderly manner, and the speakers apparently\r\n     felt themselves as much at home with their hearers, as if they\r\n     were merely a private company. They were listened to with much\r\n     attention and frequently applauded. Altogether, the meeting was\r\n     very successful and would compare most favorably with any that\r\n     has ever been held in the same building.\r\n\r\n     The proceedings were commenced by Mrs. Lydia F. Fowler being\r\n     appointed President, and Miss Mary S. Rich Secretary. Prayer was\r\n     offered by Rev. Antoinette L. Brown, after which Mrs. Amelia\r\n     Bloomer was introduced amid warm applause. She was dressed in the\r\n     peculiar costume to which her name is given. Her speech, which\r\n     occupied more than an hour in its delivery, was an able\r\n     exposition of the reasons why women should be amongst the\r\n     foremost of the advocates of the temperance reformation. Her\r\n     remarks on the position of woman under the law, and the\r\n     subordinate part she was compelled to play in all the relations\r\n     of life, were listened to with much attention, and though\r\n     sometimes very caustic and severe upon the other sex, they were\r\n     received not only with forbearance, but were frequently\r\n     applauded. Rev. Antoinette L. Brown made a very effective and\r\n     eloquent address, urging the necessity for legislative action\r\n     against the evils of intemperance, and recommended the passage of\r\n     the Maine Law in our Legislature. Addresses were also made by\r\n     Susan B. Anthony, and Horace Greeley.\r\n\r\n     _The Tribune_, under the heading of \"Grand Temperance Rally,\"\r\n     said: Last evening an exceedingly numerous and enthusiastic\r\n     meeting was convened in the Tabernacle, under the auspices of the\r\n     \"Fifth Ward Temperance Alliance,\" it then gave a full report of\r\n     the addresses of the four ladies, and closed with:\r\n\r\n     Horace Greeley then came forward in response to numerous and\r\n     repeated calls, and said that within his immediate recollection\r\n     the Temperance cause had been utterly ruined (as it was said)\r\n     three distinct times; first when the pledge of total abstinence\r\n     was introduced; again when the Washingtonian movement was set on\r\n     feet, and then when the Maine Liquor Law came out, every\r\n     rum-drinker in the country mourned the cause as irrevocably\r\n     ruined. But now, however, it was gone entirely, because some\r\n     women came forward to speak for temperance. He had spoken so\r\n     often on the subject that he had nothing new to say; but he\r\n     rejoiced to see that there was another army coming up who could\r\n     speak, as they had heard them that evening and on other\r\n     occasions. There was something of freshness in them; and if they\r\n     did not advance new truth, we, at least, heard truth from a new\r\n     point of view. He had often heard of the fascinating influence of\r\n     woman, and he was glad if she had such that it should be put\r\n     forth for temperance. He was happy to hear her explain the wants\r\n     of the poor mother, or sister, or wife of the unfortunate\r\n     drunkard; he would not object to her saying if her home had\r\n     become intolerable that she should be allowed a separation, and\r\n     permitted to earn a living for herself, seeing that her brute of\r\n     a husband was unwilling or unable to give her a support. The\r\n     great cause would be advanced, he thought, by the advocacy of it\r\n     by women. He considered that the people would be called upon to\r\n     vote for the Maine Liquor Law one way or the other within a year,\r\n     for the politicians were becoming tired of this mischievous\r\n     element. It was one on which they could not calculate, and would\r\n     be glad to get it out of the way by submitting it to the people\r\n     for their disposition. The friends of the cause should be\r\n     rejoiced if women who could speak on this subject did come\r\n     forward and speak until the law was passed. He would feel their\r\n     advocacy an additional assurance of success.\r\n\r\nThe women of New York brought to this work a religious earnestness and\r\nintense enthusiasm, that seemed determined to override every obstacle\r\nthat blocked the way to family purity and peace. Every phase of the\r\nquestion, without a thought of policy or conciliation, was freely\r\ndiscussed. Seeing the evils in social life, in the destruction of all\r\ndomestic harmony, they demanded divorce for drunkenness. Seeing wine\r\non the tables of clergymen and bishops, liquor-dealers and\r\nwine-bibbers dignified and honored as elders and deacons in churches,\r\nthey called on the women to leave all such unholy organizations. Thus\r\nbesieging legislators for a \"Maine Law,\" demanding purity at the\r\nfamily altar, denouncing the Church for its apathy, and the clergy for\r\ntheir hostility to the public action of woman, this State Temperance\r\nSociety roused the enmity of many classes, and was the target for\r\nvaried criticism.\r\n\r\nPoliticians said such radical measures as the women proposed would\r\ndestroy the Whig party, if carried into legislation. Churchmen said\r\nsuch infidel measures would undermine the influence of the clergy and\r\nthe foundations of the Church. Conservatives said the divorce measures\r\nproposed would upheave the whole social fabric. Thus a general\r\ndisintegration of society was threatened, if freedom was granted to\r\nwoman. Not being allowed to vote themselves, they used their influence\r\nboth in the anti-slavery and temperance reforms, to strengthen many\r\nmen in their determination not to vote for any man who was in favor of\r\nslavery and license; hence there had been a steadily increasing\r\ndefection in the Whig ranks, that cost Clay his election in 1844, and\r\nScott in 1852.\r\n\r\nMr. Pierce's administration, beginning in 1853, was a period of great\r\npolitical overturning. Innumerable small office-holders being thrown\r\nout of employment, and feeling hostile to all \"isms,\" as the\r\nopposition designated the reforms of the day, they became a\r\ntroublesome element in our Conventions.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this class in organizing \"The Woman's Temperance Society,\" it\r\nwas decided to enroll men as members, but not to allow them to vote\r\nand hold office. They were permitted to attend the meetings, talk, and\r\ncontribute money, but they were to have no direct power. On this basis\r\nthe Society was formed, and maintained its integrity one year.\r\nHowever, as the justice of such discrimination on the ground of sex\r\nwas questionable, and some women and many men refused to unite with a\r\nSociety thus prescriptive, the Constitution was amended, and men\r\nadmitted to full membership.\r\n\r\n\r\n       FIRST ANNUAL MEETING OF THE WOMAN'S STATE TEMPERANCE SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n                   ROCHESTER, JUNE 1 and 2, 1853.\r\n\r\n     _The Rochester Advertiser_ gives the following report: In\r\n     Corinthian Hall yesterday, at ten o'clock, a large audience\r\n     assembled. The Society was called to order by Mrs. E. C. Stanton,\r\n     who said if any one present desired to offer vocal prayer, there\r\n     was now an opportunity. Prayer was then offered by a young man in\r\n     one of the side seats. The platform was occupied by Mrs. Stanton,\r\n     Emily Clark, Lucy Stone, Mrs. Vaughan, Dr. Harriot Hunt, Mrs.\r\n     Nichols, Mrs. Fish, Mrs. Albro, Mrs. Alling, Elizabeth C. Wright,\r\n     and Mrs. Lydia F. Fowler.\r\n\r\n     The attendance at this opening session is much larger this year\r\n     than last, and a more hopeful spirit prevails. There are several\r\n     of the notabilities of the Woman's Rights cause present, and a\r\n     fair sprinkling of Bloomers is scattered through the audience.\r\n     There were many out, attracted by curiosity, though probably the\r\n     most are earnest friends of the Society. The proceedings were of\r\n     a deeply interesting character, both from their novelty and their\r\n     importance. After the prayer was concluded, Mrs. Stanton gave her\r\n     opening address, as follows:\r\n\r\n                          MRS. STANTON'S ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n     A little more than one year ago, in this same hall, we formed the\r\n     first Woman's State Temperance Society. We believed that the time\r\n     had come for woman to speak on this question, and to insist on\r\n     her right to be heard in the councils of Church and State. It was\r\n     proposed at that time that we, instead of forming a society,\r\n     should go _en masse_ into the Men's State Temperance Society. We\r\n     were assured that in becoming members by paying the sum of $1, we\r\n     should thereby secure the right to speak and vote in their\r\n     meetings.\r\n\r\n     We who had watched the jealousy with which man had ever eyed the\r\n     slow aggressions of woman, warned you against the insidious\r\n     proposition made by agents from that Society. We told you they\r\n     would no doubt gladly receive the dollar, but that you would\r\n     never be allowed to speak or vote in their meetings. Many of you\r\n     thought us suspicious and unjust toward the temperance men of the\r\n     Empire State. The fact that Abby Kelly had been permitted to\r\n     speak in one of their public meetings, was brought up as an\r\n     argument by some agent of that Society to prove our fears\r\n     unfounded. We suggested that she spoke by favor and not right,\r\n     and our right there as equals to speak and vote, we well knew\r\n     would never be acknowledged. A long debate saved you from that\r\n     false step, and our predictions have been fully realized in the\r\n     treatment our delegates received at the annual meeting held at\r\n     Syracuse last July, and at the recent Brick Church meeting in New\r\n     York.\r\n\r\n     In forming our Society, the mass of us being radical and liberal,\r\n     we left our platform free; we are no respecters of persons, all\r\n     are alike welcome here without regard to sect, sex, color, or\r\n     caste. There have been, however, many objections made to one\r\n     feature in our Constitution, and that is, that although we admit\r\n     men as members with equal right to speak in our meetings, we\r\n     claim the offices for women alone. We felt, in starting, the\r\n     necessity of throwing all the responsibility on woman, which we\r\n     knew she never would take, if there were any men at hand to\r\n     think, act, and plan for her. The result has shown the wisdom of\r\n     what seemed so objectionable to many. It was, however, a\r\n     temporary expedient, and as that seeming violation of man's\r\n     rights prevents some true friends of the cause from becoming\r\n     members of our Society, and as the officers are now well skilled\r\n     in the practical business of getting up meetings, raising funds,\r\n     etc., and have fairly learned how to stand and walk alone, it may\r\n     perhaps be safe to raise man to an entire equality with\r\n     ourselves, hoping, however, that he will modestly permit the\r\n     women to continue the work they have so successfully begun. I\r\n     would suggest, therefore, that after the business of the past\r\n     year be disposed of, this objectionable feature of our\r\n     Constitution be brought under consideration.\r\n\r\n     Our experience thus far as a Society has been most encouraging.\r\n     We number over two thousand members. We have four agents who have\r\n     traveled in various parts of the State, and I need not say what\r\n     is well known to all present, that their labors thus far have\r\n     given entire satisfaction to the Society and the public. I was\r\n     surprised and rejoiced to find that women, without the least\r\n     preparation or experience, who had never raised their voices in\r\n     public one year ago, should with so much self-reliance, dignity,\r\n     and force, enter at once such a field of labor, and so ably\r\n     perform the work. In the metropolis of our country, in the\r\n     capital of our State, before our Legislature, and in the country\r\n     school-house, they have been alike earnest and faithful to the\r\n     truth. In behalf of our Society, I thank you for your unwearied\r\n     labors during the past year. In the name of humanity, I bid you\r\n     go on and devote yourselves humbly to the cause you have\r\n     espoused. The noble of your sex everywhere rejoice in your\r\n     success, and feel in themselves a new impulse to struggle upward\r\n     and onward; and the deep, though silent gratitude that ascends to\r\n     Heaven from the wretched outcast, the wives, the mothers, and the\r\n     daughters of brutal drunkards, is well known to all who have\r\n     listened to their tales of woe, their bitter experience, the\r\n     dark, sad passages of their tragic lives.\r\n\r\n     I hope this, our first year, is prophetic of a happy future of\r\n     strong, united, and energetic action among the women of our\r\n     State. If we are sincere and earnest in our love of this cause,\r\n     in our devotion to truth, in our desire for the happiness of the\r\n     race, we shall ever lose sight of self; each soul will, in a\r\n     measure, forget its own individual interests in proclaiming great\r\n     principles of justice and right. It is only a true, a deep, and\r\n     abiding love of truth, that can swallow up all petty jealousies,\r\n     envies, discords, and dissensions, and make us truly magnanimous\r\n     and self-sacrificing. We have every reason to think, from reports\r\n     we hear on all sides, that our Society has given this cause a new\r\n     impulse, and if the condition of our treasury is a test, we have\r\n     abundant reason to believe that in the hearts of the people we\r\n     are approved, and that by their purses we shall be sustained.\r\n\r\n     It has been objected to our Society that we do not confine\r\n     ourselves to the subject of temperance, but talk too much about\r\n     woman's rights, divorce, and the Church. It could be easily shown\r\n     how the consideration of this great question carries us\r\n     legitimately into the discussion of these various subjects. One\r\n     class of minds would deal with effects alone; another would\r\n     inquire into causes; the work of the former is easily perceived\r\n     and quickly done; that of the latter requires deep thought, great\r\n     patience, much time, and a wise self-denial. Our physicians of\r\n     the present day are a good type of the mass of our reformers.\r\n     They take out cancers, cut off tonsils, drive the poison which\r\n     nature has wisely thrown to the surface, back again, quiet\r\n     unsteady nerves with valerian, and by means of ether infuse an\r\n     artificial courage into a patient that he may bravely endure some\r\n     painful operation. It requires but little thought to feel that\r\n     the wise physician who shall trace out the true causes of\r\n     suffering; who shall teach us the great, immutable laws of life\r\n     and health; who shall show us how and where in our every-day\r\n     life, we are violating these laws, and the true point to begin\r\n     the reform, is doing a much higher, broader, and deeper work than\r\n     he who shall bend all his energies to the temporary relief of\r\n     suffering. Those temperance men or women whose whole work\r\n     consists in denouncing rum-sellers, appealing to legislatures,\r\n     eulogizing Neal Dow, and shouting Maine Law, are superficial\r\n     reformers, mere surface-workers. True, this outside work is well,\r\n     and must be done; let those who see no other do this, but let\r\n     them lay no hindrances in the way of that class of mind, who,\r\n     seeing in our present false social relations the causes of the\r\n     moral deformities of the race, would fain declare the immutable\r\n     laws that govern mind as well as matter, and point out the true\r\n     causes of the evils we see about us, whether lurking under the\r\n     shadow of the altar, the sacredness of the marriage institution,\r\n     or the assumed superiority of man.\r\n\r\n     1. We have been obliged to preach woman's rights, because many,\r\n     instead of listening to what we had to say on temperance, have\r\n     questioned the right of a woman to speak on any subject. In\r\n     courts of justice and legislative assemblies, if the right of the\r\n     speaker to be there is questioned, all business waits until that\r\n     point is settled. Now, it is not settled in the mass of minds\r\n     that woman has any rights on this footstool, and much less a\r\n     right to stand on an even pedestal with man, look him in the face\r\n     as an equal, and rebuke the sins of her day and generation. Let\r\n     it be clearly understood, then, that we are a woman's rights\r\n     Society; that we believe it is woman's duty to speak whenever she\r\n     feels the impression to do so; that it is her right to be present\r\n     in all the councils of Church and State. The fact that our\r\n     agents are women, settles the question of our character on this\r\n     point.\r\n\r\n     Again, in discussing the question of temperance, all lecturers,\r\n     from the beginning, have made mention of the drunkards' wives and\r\n     children, of widows' groans and orphans' tears; shall these\r\n     classes of sufferers be introduced but as themes for rhetorical\r\n     flourish, as pathetic touches of the speaker's eloquence; shall\r\n     we passively shed tears over their condition, or by giving them\r\n     their rights, bravely open to them the doors of escape from a\r\n     wretched and degraded life? Is it not legitimate in this to\r\n     discuss the social degradation, the legal disabilities of the\r\n     drunkard's wife? If in showing her wrongs, we prove the right of\r\n     all womankind to the elective franchise; to a fair representation\r\n     in the government; to the right in criminal cases to be tried by\r\n     peers of her own choosing, shall it be said that we transcend the\r\n     bounds of our subject? If in pointing out her social degradation,\r\n     we show you how the present laws outrage the sacredness of the\r\n     marriage institution; if in proving to you that justice and mercy\r\n     demand a legal separation from drunkards, we grasp the higher\r\n     idea that a unity of soul alone constitutes and sanctifies true\r\n     marriage, and that any law or public sentiment that forces two\r\n     immortal, high-born souls to live together as husband and wife,\r\n     unless held there by love, is false to God and humanity; who\r\n     shall say that the discussion of this question does not lead us\r\n     legitimately into the consideration of the important subject of\r\n     divorce?\r\n\r\n     But why attack the Church? We do not attack the Church; we defend\r\n     ourselves merely against its attacks. It is true that the Church\r\n     and reformers have always been in an antagonistic position from\r\n     the time of Luther down to our own day, and will continue to be\r\n     until the devotional and practical types of Christianity shall be\r\n     united in one harmonious whole. To those who see the philosophy\r\n     of this position, there seems to be no cause for fearful\r\n     forebodings or helpless regret. By the light of reason and truth,\r\n     in good time, all these seeming differences will pass away. I\r\n     have no special fault to find with that part of humanity that\r\n     gathers into our churches; to me, human nature seems to manifest\r\n     itself in very much the same way in the Church and out of it. Go\r\n     through any community you please--into the nursery, kitchen, the\r\n     parlor, the places of merchandise, the market-place, and\r\n     exchange, and who can tell the church member from the outsider? I\r\n     see no reason why we should expect more of them than other men.\r\n     Why, say you, they lay claim to greater holiness; to more rigid\r\n     creeds; to a belief in a sterner God; to a closer observance of\r\n     forms. The Bible, with them, is the rule of life, the foundation\r\n     of faith, and why should we not look to them for patterns of\r\n     purity, goodness, and truth above all other men? I deny the\r\n     assumption. Reformers on all sides claim for themselves a higher,\r\n     position than the Church. Our God is a God of justice, mercy, and\r\n     truth. Their God sanctions violence, oppression, and\r\n     wine-bibbing, and winks at gross moral delinquencies. Our Bible\r\n     commands us to love our enemies; to resist not evil; to break\r\n     every yoke and let the oppressed go free; and makes a noble life\r\n     of more importance than a stern faith. Their Bible permits war,\r\n     slavery, capital punishment, and makes salvation depend on faith\r\n     and ordinances. In their creed it is a sin to dance, to pick up\r\n     sticks on the Sabbath day, to go to the theater, or large parties\r\n     during Lent, to read a notice of any reform meeting from the\r\n     altar, or permit a woman to speak in the church. In our creed it\r\n     is a sin to hold a slave; to hang a man on the gallows; to make\r\n     war on defenseless nations, or to sell rum to a weak brother, and\r\n     rob the widow and the orphan of a protector and a home. Thus may\r\n     we write out some of our differences, but from the similarity in\r\n     the conduct of the human family, it is fair to infer that our\r\n     differences are more intellectual than spiritual, and the great\r\n     truths we hear so clearly uttered on all sides, have been\r\n     incorporated as vital principles into the inner life of but few\r\n     indeed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMELIA BLOOMER (with autograph).]\r\n\r\n     We must not expect the Church to leap _en masse_ to a higher\r\n     position. She sends forth her missionaries of truth one by one.\r\n     All of our reformers have, in a measure, been developed in the\r\n     Church, and all our reforms have started there. The advocates and\r\n     opposers of the reforms of our day, have grown up side by side,\r\n     partaking of the same ordinances and officiating at the same\r\n     altars; but one, by applying more fully his Christian principles\r\n     to life, and pursuing an admitted truth to its legitimate\r\n     results, has unwittingly found himself in antagonism with his\r\n     brother.\r\n\r\n     Belief is not voluntary, and change is the natural result of\r\n     growth and development. We would fain have all church members\r\n     sons and daughters of temperance; but if the Church, in her\r\n     wisdom, has made her platform so broad that wine-bibbers and\r\n     rum-sellers may repose in ease thereon, we who are always\r\n     preaching liberality ought to be the last to complain. Having\r\n     thus briefly noticed some of the objections to our movement, I\r\n     will not detain the audience longer at this time.\r\n\r\nAn able report of the Executive Committee was then read by Mrs.\r\nVaughan.\r\n\r\nThe President, on motion, appointed the various Committees,[98] and\r\nread a letter from Gerrit Smith to Susan B. Anthony:\r\n\r\n                                        PETERBORO, _May 7, 1853_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR MADAM:--I thank you for your letter. So constantly am I\r\n     employed in my extensive private concerns, that I can attend none\r\n     of the anniversaries this spring. I should be especially happy to\r\n     attend yours; and to testify by my presence, if not by my words,\r\n     that woman is in her place when she is laboring to redeem the\r\n     world from the curse of drunkenness.\r\n\r\n     I know not why it is not as much the duty of your sex, as it is\r\n     of mine, to establish newspapers, write books, and hold public\r\n     meetings for the promotion of the cause of temperance. The\r\n     current idea, that modesty should hold women back from such\r\n     services, is all resolvable into nonsense and wickedness. Female\r\n     modesty! female delicacy! I would that I might never again hear\r\n     such phrases. There is but one standard of modesty and delicacy\r\n     for both men and women; and so long as different standards are\r\n     tolerated, both sexes will be perverse and corrupt. It is my duty\r\n     to be as modest and delicate as you are; and if your modesty and\r\n     delicacy may excuse you from making a public speech, then may\r\n     mine excuse me from making one.\r\n\r\n     The Quakers are the best people I have ever known--the most\r\n     serious and chaste, and yet the most brave and resisting. But\r\n     there is no other people who are so little concerned, lest man\r\n     get out of his sphere, or lest woman get out of hers. No people\r\n     make so little difference as they do, between man and woman.\r\n     Others appear to think that the happiness and safety of the world\r\n     consist in magnifying the difference. But when reason and\r\n     religion shall rule the world, there will be felt to be no other\r\n     difference between man and woman, than that of their physical\r\n     constitutions. None will then be acknowledged in respect to the\r\n     intellect, the heart, or the manners.\r\n\r\n                         Very respectfully, your friend,\r\n                                                     GERRIT SMITH.\r\n\r\nThe attendance at this Convention was larger than the year previous,\r\nand the debates more interesting, as Mrs. Nichols, William Henry\r\nChanning, Lucy Stone, Antoinette Brown, and Frederick Douglass all\r\ntook an active part in the proceedings. During one of the sessions\r\nquite a heated discussion took place on the subject of Divorce, Mrs.\r\nStanton and Lucy Stone taking the ground that it was not only woman's\r\nright, but her duty, to withdraw from all such unholy relations, Mrs.\r\nNichols and Miss Brown taking the opposite position.\r\n\r\nAs it was decided at this second convention to admit gentlemen, a\r\nschism was the immediate result. By their party tactics, in which they\r\nwere well versed, they took the initiative steps to scatter the forces\r\nso successfully gathered. The Society, with its guns silenced on the\r\npopular foes, lingered a year or two, and was heard of no more. It was\r\nthe policy of these worldly wise men to restrict the debate on\r\ntemperance within such narrow limits as to disturb none of the\r\nexisting conditions of society. They said, treat it as a purely moral\r\nand religious question; \"pray over it,\" it being too knotty a problem\r\nto be solved on earth, they proposed to have the whole case adjusted\r\nin the courts of Heaven: very much as the wise men to-day think best\r\nto dispose of the temperance reform.\r\n\r\nThus these politic gentlemen manipulated the association, eliminated\r\nthe woman's rights element _per se_, which, having been educated in\r\nthe anti-slavery school of morals, could not be blinded with any male\r\nsophistries or considerations of policy. It was the universal plea\r\nthen as now, in advocating reforms, \"Sacrifice principle to numbers,\r\nif you would secure victory,\" forgetting that one company of brave men\r\ncould clear their path to the enemy quicker than a battalion of\r\ncowards. A multitude of timid, undeveloped men and women, afraid of\r\npriests and politicians, are a hindrance rather than help in any\r\nreform. When Garrison's forces had been thoroughly sifted, and only\r\nthe picked men and women remained, he soon made political parties and\r\nchurch organizations feel the power of his burning words. The\r\ntemperance cause has had no organized body of fearless leaders. Psalm\r\nsinging and prayer it was supposed would accomplish what only could be\r\ndone by just laws, enlightened public sentiment, and pure religion,\r\napplied to the practical interests of mankind. When abolitionists left\r\nparties and churches, because of their pro-slavery codes and creeds,\r\nthey began alike to purify their organizations in order to win back\r\nthat noble army of patriots. Women were urged to enroll themselves as\r\nmembers of men's associations, pay their initiation fee of one dollar,\r\ngather petitions, do all in their power to rouse enthusiasm; but they\r\nmust not presume to sit on the platform, nor speak, nor vote in the\r\nmeetings. Those women who had no proper self-respect accepted the\r\nconditions; those who had, tested their status on the platform, and\r\nnot being received as equals, abandoned all temperance organizations,\r\nas the same proper pride that forbade them to accept the conditions of\r\na proscribed class in men's conventions, also prevented their\r\naffiliation with women who would tolerate such insults to the sex. The\r\nlong, persistent struggle at last culminated in the World's Temperance\r\nConvention, which may be called our Waterloo in that reform.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRICK CHURCH MEETING.\r\n\r\nMay 12th, 1853, the friends of temperance assembled in New York to\r\nmake arrangements for a World's Temperance Convention. The meeting was\r\nheld in Dr. Spring's old Brick Church, on Franklin Square, where the\r\n_New York Times_ building now stands. It was organized by nominating\r\nthe Hon. A. C. Barstow, of Rhode Island, chairman; the Rev. R. C.\r\nCrampton, of New York, and the Rev. George Duffield, of Pennsylvania,\r\nsecretaries. The meeting opened with prayer, \"asking God's blessing on\r\nthe proceedings.\"[99] A motion was made that all gentlemen present be\r\nadmitted as delegates. Dr. Trall, of New York, moved an amendment that\r\nthe word \"ladies\" be inserted, as there were delegates present from\r\nthe Woman's State Temperance Society. The motion was carried, and\r\ncredentials received, and every man and woman became members of the\r\nconvention. A business committee of one from each State was appointed.\r\nA motion was made that Susan B. Anthony, Secretary of the Woman's\r\nState Temperance Society, be added to the business committee. Then the\r\nwar commenced in earnest. D.D.'s, M.D.'s, and Honorables were\r\nhorrified. Speech followed speech in rapid succession, with angry\r\nvehemence. As the committee was already full, the motion was ruled out\r\nof order. Thomas Wentworth Higginson asked that he be excused from\r\nserving on the committee, and moved that Lucy Stone be added in his\r\nplace. Then the confusion was increased. Abby Kelly Foster arose and\r\ntried to explain, but shouts of \"order\" drowned her voice, and after\r\npersisting in her attempt to speak for ten minutes the uproar was\r\nfrightful, and she was compelled to sit down. Emily Clark made a\r\nsimilar attempt, with the same result.\r\n\r\nHon. Bradford R. Wood, of Albany, then moved, that as there was a\r\nparty present determined to introduce the question of woman's rights,\r\nand to run it into the ground, that this convention adjourn _sine\r\ndie_; but on request he withdrew it, and moved that a committee on\r\ncredentials be appointed to decide who were members of the convention.\r\nThis committee, consisting of Rev. John Chambers, of Philadelphia,\r\nHon. B. R. Wood, of Albany, and Dr. Condit, of New Jersey, were absent\r\nfifteen minutes, and then reported that, as in their opinion, the call\r\nfor this meeting was not intended to include female delegates, and\r\ncustom had not sanctioned the public action of women in similar\r\nsituations, the credentials of the ladies should be rejected. The\r\nreport was received, and after a disgraceful contest on the part of\r\nthose from whom we look for honor, truth, and nobleness, and every\r\nChristian virtue, on account of their sacred calling and high\r\nposition, it was adopted by a vote of 34 to 32, ten of those voting in\r\nthe negative being women. During the progress of the discussion--if\r\ndiscussion it could be called, where all the women who attempted to\r\nspeak were silenced, and the men who attempted to speak for them were\r\nalmost as rudely treated--Mayor Barstow twice requested the\r\nappointment of another chairman in his stead, stating that he would\r\nnot preside over a meeting where woman's rights were introduced, or\r\nwomen allowed to speak. Having finally silenced them, he was\r\nhenceforward content to wear the honors of his temporary office.\r\n\r\nMr. Higginson protested against the action of the meeting as\r\ndisgraceful to the leaders, and tendered his resignation as one of the\r\nbusiness committee. He then stated that all persons favorable to\r\ncalling a _whole_ world's temperance convention were invited to meet\r\nat Dr. Trall's office at 2 o'clock. The ladies present, and the\r\ngentlemen who had contended for their admission as delegates, then\r\nwithdrew. Another disgraceful scene occurred on a protest from Dr.\r\nTownsend against the action of the convention, and a motion to pay the\r\nexpenses of the ladies who had come some distance as delegates and\r\nbeen excluded. The motion was seconded. Again shouts of \"order,\"\r\n\"order,\" arose, and the confusion was worse than ever. Dr. T. finally\r\nwithdrew his motion, on being told that the ladies would accept no\r\nsuch favor at the hands of a convention of rowdies.\r\n\r\nSeveral speeches then followed, mostly from, clergymen; all condemning\r\nthe public action of women in any reforms, and defending the position\r\nof the convention, quoting Scripture and the Divine Will to sanction\r\ntheir injustice. One Rev. gentleman stated that he would have nothing\r\nto do with the women. Rev. John Chambers said, for one, he rejoiced\r\nthat the women were gone; they were now rid of the scum of the\r\nconvention!! Other clergymen spoke in the same strain. A motion was\r\nmade by Dr. Snodgrass that the committee assign some part of the work\r\nof the World's Convention to women, which called out from Mr. Barstow\r\nsome remarks too indecent for repetition. The motion was withdrawn.\r\nThe gall and bitterness, the ridicule and vulgarity of the Rev. D.D.'s\r\nbeing expended on some of the grandest women our nation could boast,\r\nthey adjourned, after deciding to hold a four days' convention,\r\nbeginning the 6th of September. The other wing of the temperance army\r\ndecided to do the same, and held a meeting of protest a few days after\r\nin the Tabernacle.\r\n\r\n     The _New York Tribune_ says of the meeting of protest, Saturday\r\n     evening, May 14, 1852: A grand Temperance demonstration was held\r\n     in the Broadway Tabernacle Saturday evening. There could not have\r\n     been less than 3,000 persons present. The floor of the house, the\r\n     aisles, the galleries, every inch of sitting and standing room\r\n     was literally packed. The greatest enthusiasm prevailed\r\n     throughout. The officers of the meeting were:\r\n\r\n     PRESIDENT--Susan B. Anthony.[100]\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE, in a letter to _The Una_, says: Last week, at New\r\n     York, we had a foretaste of what woman is to expect when she\r\n     attempts to exercise her equal rights as a human being. In\r\n     conformity with a resolution adopted by the Mass Convention\r\n     recently held in Boston, a call was issued, inviting \"the\r\n     _friends of temperance_\" to meet in New York, May 11th, and\r\n     prepare for a \"World's Convention.\" Under that call, the Woman's\r\n     State Society of New York, an active and efficient body, sent\r\n     delegates; but though regularly elected, their credentials were\r\n     rejected with scorn. The chairman of the committee reported that\r\n     those who called the meeting never intended to include women.\r\n     Think of it, a _World's_ Convention, in which woman is voted not\r\n     of the world!!\r\n\r\n     Rev. Dr. Hewitt affirmed it a burning shame for women to be\r\n     there; and though it was entirely out of order, he discussed the\r\n     question of \"Woman's Rights,\" taking the ground that women should\r\n     be nowhere but at home. Rev. E. M. Jackson, gave it as his\r\n     opinion, that \"the women came there expressly to disturb.\" The\r\n     Rev. Mr. Fowler, of Utica, showed the same contempt for woman\r\n     that he did last year, at the N. Y. State Temperance Society, at\r\n     Syracuse. Rev. Mr. Chambers was particularly bitter.\r\n\r\n     It would have been well for those women who accept the foolish\r\n     flattery of men, to have been present to see the real estimate in\r\n     which woman is held by these men who surely represent a large\r\n     class. The President of the meeting, Mayor Barstow, of your city,\r\n     indignantly refused to put the motion made--that Susan B. Anthony\r\n     should be on a committee, declaring \"that he would resign rather\r\n     than do it.\" He said it \"was not fit that a woman should be in\r\n     such places.\" After we left, if the papers reported him\r\n     correctly, he used language which proved that he was not fit to\r\n     be where decent people are. It was next to impossible for us or\r\n     our friends to get a hearing. The \"previous question\" was called,\r\n     or we were voted out of order, or half a dozen of the opposing\r\n     party talked at once to keep us silent. Rev. T. W. Higginson\r\n     declined serving on a committee from which women were excluded,\r\n     and when it became apparent that only half of the world could be\r\n     represented, he entered his protest, and invited those who were\r\n     in favor of a _Whole_ World's Temperance Convention to meet that\r\n     afternoon at Dr. Trall's. A large minority withdrew, including\r\n     several ministers, and arranged for a Convention that shall know\r\n     \"neither male nor female,\" to be held in New York sometime during\r\n     The World's Fair.\r\n\r\n     A large and enthusiastic meeting was held at the Broadway\r\n     Tabernacle, to protest against the above proceedings, and\r\n     although twelve and a half cents were charged at the door, every\r\n     seat was occupied, and much of the \"standing room\" also.\r\n\r\n     The same gentlemen who excluded us, held a meeting subsequently\r\n     in Metropolitan Hall. There your Major Barstow said: \"God has\r\n     placed woman in the moral world where he has the sun in the\r\n     physical, to regulate, enlighten, and cheer.\" C. C. Burleigh,\r\n     alluding to this remark, in our meeting at the Tabernacle, said:\r\n     \"Thus he calls his Convention, in which Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,\r\n     Mercury, and Neptune are appointed a committee of arrangements,\r\n     and says the Sun shall be excluded.\"\r\n\r\n     At this meeting, _ladies_ were especially invited to vote, as\r\n     though they had a heart in it, and were urged also to give their\r\n     money to aid these very men by whom every soul of us had been\r\n     insulted. I am sorry to say some gave. But taught such lessons,\r\n     by such masters, woman will one day be wiser. Yours, for\r\n     humanity, without distinction of sex,\r\n                                             LUCY STONE.\r\n\r\nAfter the Brick Church meeting was over, some of the actors being\r\nashamed of themselves, the Rev. John Marsh tried to defend himself and\r\nhis coadjutors, but Mr. Greeley very summarily brushed his sophistry\r\naside, and placed all the actors in that disgraceful farce in their\r\ntrue colors.\r\n\r\n          _The New York Daily Tribune, Wednesday, May 18, 1853._\r\n\r\n                   THE WORLD'S TEMPERANCE CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n     _To the Editor of the New York Tribune:_\r\n\r\n     SIR:--Your \"Inquirer,\" it appears to me, is bent on throwing\r\n     firebrands into the temperance ranks, and the worst kind of\r\n     firebrands, those of vile sectarianism. Will you permit me to\r\n     answer and remark upon a few of his inquiries?\r\n\r\n     1. \"Are there to be _two_ World's Conventions?\"\r\n\r\n     _Answer_. That will be, I suppose, as people please. There may be\r\n     a dozen; and I know not that any harm will be done.\r\n\r\n     2. \"Did Mayor Barstow occasion the schism in the temperance\r\n     ranks, by refusing to recognize the feminine element in the\r\n     movement?\"\r\n\r\n     _Ans_. No. The schism, such as there was, was caused by a\r\n     proposal of Rev. Mr. Higginson, and a persistence in it, that a\r\n     representative of the Women's State Society should be added to\r\n     the Business Committee of one from each State; and this after the\r\n     Committee was full. With as good reason, it was said, might one\r\n     be pressed from the _Men's_ State Society or State Alliance. Mr.\r\n     Higginson pertinaciously pressed the matter; and because he could\r\n     not have his own way and rule the Convention, he refused to serve\r\n     on the Committee; and hence arose all the disturbance and the\r\n     schism.\r\n\r\n     3. \"Did Dr. Hewitt rule out from office Mr. Barnum on the ground\r\n     that he (Mr. Barnum) was an infidel?\"\r\n\r\n     _Ans_. No. I am confident he used no such phraseology; and\r\n     \"Inquirer\" has no more right to ask such a question, than he has\r\n     to ask if Dr. Hewitt did not rule him out on the ground that Mr.\r\n     Barnum was a horse thief. The very question amounts to an\r\n     assertion (as is announced in the next inquiry) that he _did_ say\r\n     it; which, if he did not, is calumny. Dr. H. _did_ object to Mr.\r\n     Barnum, as he had a perfect right to do, as one of the Appointing\r\n     Committee. It was desirable to find the best men to get up to the\r\n     World's Convention. I proposed Mr. Barnum as one, knowing his\r\n     amazing efficiency. Dr. H. objected, on the ground that he\r\n     (Barnum) was a very exceptionable man in his part of Connecticut,\r\n     and would do injury to the Convention; and, as harmony was\r\n     desirable, and unexceptionable men should be put upon the\r\n     Committee, his name was withdrawn. It was agreed that what was\r\n     said in Committee should not go abroad.\r\n\r\n     4. \"Does Mr. Barnum's infidelity consist in his attending another\r\n     church in Bridgeport from Dr. Hewitt's?\"\r\n\r\n     Here appears the cloven foot of sectarianism. One sect is to be\r\n     held up as persecuted. Here the writer assumes that Dr. Hewitt\r\n     did say that Mr. B. was an infidel; and, assuming it and knowing\r\n     it, why does he hypocritically ask whether Dr. H. _did_ say it?\r\n\r\n     5. \"Is it true that Dr. H. refused his pulpit for a temperance\r\n     lecture by Rev. E. H. Chapin, on the ground that he was a\r\n     Universalist?\"\r\n\r\n     Sectarianism again! What has all this to do with the meeting at\r\n     the Brick Chapel? Why is it brought here but to kindle up\r\n     sectarian fires? A pastor of a church has everywhere conceded to\r\n     him the control of his pulpit, and no one may contend with him in\r\n     this matter. Whether that was so or not, I know not, nor is it\r\n     any concern of mine, nor of the public. Such a rule the world\r\n     knows does not govern us in selecting temperance speakers. We\r\n     will not invite speakers to speak at temperance meetings who have\r\n     something else more at heart than temperance, which they will\r\n     most offensively thrust in their speech upon the meeting. But we,\r\n     without hesitation, invite men of all sorts to speak at\r\n     temperance meetings, who will speak to the point, and do us good\r\n     and not hurt. Rev. Mr. Chapin, we all know, is of this character,\r\n     and, without hesitation, I invited him to speak at the late\r\n     Anniversary of the American Temperance Union (as I did Rev. Mr.\r\n     Higginson, who differs from me perhaps as much in religious\r\n     belief), and he (Mr. C.) would have spoken, but was to be out of\r\n     the city.\r\n\r\n     6. \"How can the proposed Convention be a _World's_ Convention, if\r\n     women and all who do not belong to a particular Church are to be\r\n     excluded?\"\r\n\r\n     Sectarianism again! Who has said a word about Church but this\r\n     writer, and about excluding women from the Convention and all its\r\n     entertainments? No one. The basis of the Convention has not been\r\n     settled. It probably will be as broad as the world. The last\r\n     query I think unworthy an answer. And I must be permitted to say\r\n     the whole inquiry manifests a very bad spirit, and is calculated\r\n     to promote evils which the public press should suppress rather\r\n     than foster.\r\n\r\n     As I sent you an anonymous communication explaining some of these\r\n     matters last Saturday, which you declined publishing, because, I\r\n     suppose, it was anonymous, I feel constrained, though\r\n     reluctantly, to give this my name.\r\n\r\n                                         Yours, etc.,     JOHN MARSH,\r\n\r\n                       _Office of Am. Temp. Union, No. 149 Nassau St._\r\n\r\n\r\n                        HORACE GREELEY'S REPLY.\r\n\r\n     Rev. John! we have allowed you to be heard at full length; now\r\n     you and your set will be silent and hear us.\r\n\r\n     Very palpably your palaver about Mr. Higginson's motion is a\r\n     dodge, a quirk, a most contemptible quibble, reluctant as we are\r\n     to speak thus irreverently of the solemn utterances of a Doctor\r\n     of Divinity. Right well do you know, reverend sir, that the\r\n     particular form, or time, or fashion in which the question came\r\n     up is utterly immaterial, and you interpose it only to throw dust\r\n     in the eyes of the public. Suppose a woman had been nominated at\r\n     the right time, and in the right way, according to your\r\n     understanding of punctilios, wouldn't the same resistance have\r\n     been made and the same row got up? You know right well that there\r\n     would. Then what is all your pettifogging about technicalities\r\n     worth? The only question that anybody cares a button about is\r\n     this, Shall woman be allowed to participate in your World's\r\n     Temperance Convention on a footing of perfect equality with man?\r\n     If yea, the whole dispute turns on nothing, and isn't worth six\r\n     lines in _The Tribune_. But if it was and is the purpose of those\r\n     for whom you pettifog to keep woman off the platform of that\r\n     Convention, and deny her any part in its proceedings except as a\r\n     spectator, what does all your talk about Higginson's untimeliness\r\n     and the Committees being full amount to? Why not treat the\r\n     subject with some show of honesty?\r\n\r\n     Now as to Barnum and Hewitt: it is eminently proper that the\r\n     public should know exactly on what ground H. ruled B. off the\r\n     Business Committee, and it is self-criminating to plead that a\r\n     mantle of secrecy was spread over the doings in Committee. If\r\n     Hewitt protested against Barnum on the assumption that the\r\n     latter is a sinner, while this is to be a Convention of saints,\r\n     let that fact be known, so that sinners may keep away from the\r\n     Convention. If on the assumption that Mr. Barnum is an infidel or\r\n     a heretic, let that fact come squarely out, so that we may know\r\n     that infidels or heretics, either or both, are to be proscribed\r\n     at the Hewitt-Marsh Convention. For if there is to be really and\r\n     truly a World's Temperance Convention, according to any fair\r\n     meaning of the phrase, then we say women, as well as men, youth,\r\n     as well as adults, colored, as well as white, heretic, as well as\r\n     orthodox, sinners, as well as saints--so that they be earnest and\r\n     undoubted upholders of total abstinence--should be invited to\r\n     send delegates, who should be equally welcome to its platform and\r\n     eligible to its offices. An Orthodox White Male Adult Saints'\r\n     Convention may be very proper and very useful, but it should be\r\n     called distinctly as such, and not unqualifiedly as a World's\r\n     Convention.\r\n\r\n     Dr. Marsh thinks it nobody's business whether Dr. Hewitt did or\r\n     did not refuse the use of his church for a temperance-meeting at\r\n     which Mr. Chapin was to speak, because he (Mr. C.) was a\r\n     Universalist. Yes, reverend sir, it is a good many people's\r\n     business if the public are purposely left in doubt as to the\r\n     character of the World's Convention that is to issue from the\r\n     Brick Church meeting. For if Dr. Hewitt shut his pulpit against\r\n     so unexceptionable, assiduous, effective an advocate of\r\n     temperance as Mr. Chapin confessedly is (see Marsh, above), then\r\n     we have a cue to his objection to Barnum and to the general\r\n     bearings of the \"World's Convention\" to be incubated under his\r\n     auspices. That single incident of the pulpit-shutting will have a\r\n     great deal of significance to many other people; wherefore the\r\n     fact that it has none to Marsh is overruled.\r\n\r\n     Whenever a real \"World's Temperance Convention\" shall assemble,\r\n     an inquiry may be found necessary as to what Dr. Hewitt has done\r\n     and sacrificed for temperance these five years that should\r\n     authorize him to rule P. T. Barnum off a temperance committee;\r\n     also, whether men who live by Temperance, like Dr. Marsh, are in\r\n     the right position to judge those, like Barnum, who labor and\r\n     spend money for it. For the present, however, we will leave these\r\n     inquiries on the General Orders.\r\n\r\n     One word as to Sectarianism. If \"Inquirer,\" or Mr. Barnum, or Mr.\r\n     Chapin has proposed or intrigued to keep any one out of office,\r\n     or otherwise overslaughed in the Brick Church Meeting, or any of\r\n     its meetings, because of said body's religious opinions or\r\n     associations, then said intriguer has been guilty of a very\r\n     faulty and culpable sectarian dodge, which can not be too\r\n     severely reproached. But if it be in fact t'other fellow's bull\r\n     that has gored this one's ox, then the facts should come out, and\r\n     the culprit can not escape censure by raising the stop-thief cry\r\n     of \"Sectarianism.\" \"_Thou_ art the man!\"\r\n\r\nLet the women of this nation ponder Horace Greeley's arraignment of\r\nthe reverend gentlemen who were the chief actors in this farce, and\r\nremember that in all ages of the world the priesthood have found their\r\npliant tools and most degraded victims in the women of their\r\nrespective sects. In all of these meetings there were intelligent,\r\nsincere women, so blinded by the sophistry and hypocrisy of Marsh,\r\nChambers, Hewitt, _et al._, that they gave them their countenance and\r\nsupport throughout this disgraceful mob, so-shocking and revolting to\r\nthe best men of that day and generation.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the action in the Brick Church two temperance\r\nconventions were called, to meet in New York the first week in\r\nSeptember. One designated \"The Whole World's Convention,\" including\r\nmen and women, black and white, orthodox and heretic; the other the\r\n\"Half World's Convention,\" restricted to the \"simon pure, white (male)\r\northodox saints\"; which for ribaldry of speech and rudeness of action\r\nsurpassed in its proceedings the outside mob, that raged and raved\r\nthrough an entire week, making pandemonium of our metropolis.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GRAND GATHERING--ANTI-SLAVERY--WOMAN'S RIGHTS--TEMPERANCE--THE\r\nWORLD'S FAIR, SEPTEMBER, 1853.\r\n\r\nThe opening days of the autumn of this year were days of intense\r\nexcitement in the city of New York. Added to the numbers attracted by\r\nthe World's Fair was the announcement of the Anti-Slavery, Woman's\r\nRights, and two Temperance Conventions. The reformers from every part\r\nof the country assembled in force, each to hold their separate\r\nmeetings, though the leaders were to take a conspicuous part in all.\r\nThe anti-slavery meetings began on Sunday, and every day two or three\r\nof these conventions were in session, all drawing crowds to listen or\r\nto disturb. William Henry Channing. William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell\r\nPhillips and Thomas Wentworth. Higginson eloquently pleading for the\r\nblack man's freedom on the anti-slavery platform, and for the equality\r\nof their mothers, wives, and daughters on the woman's rights platform,\r\nand for both the woman and the black man on the temperance platform;\r\nnow face to face with Rynders and his mob, and then with the Rev. John\r\nChambers, Marsh and Hewitt and their mob, the viler of the two.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HALF WORLD'S TEMPERANCE CONVENTION,\r\n\r\nled by Chambers, Hewitt, and Marsh, was in session in Metropolitan\r\nHall several days. As it was simply an organized mob, we find in the\r\njournals of the day no speeches or resolutions on the great question\r\non which they nominally assembled.\r\n\r\nIn trying to get rid of Antoinette L. Brown, who had been sent as a\r\ndelegate from two respectable and influential societies, and of James\r\nMcCune Smith, a colored delegate, they quarrelled through most of the\r\nallotted time for the convention over what class of persons could be\r\nadmitted. In summing up the proceedings of these meetings\r\n\r\n     HORACE GREELEY says, in the _Tribune_, September 7, 1853: \"This\r\n     convention has completed three of its four business sessions, and\r\n     the results may be summed up as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_First Day_--Crowding a woman off the platform.\r\n\r\n     \"_Second Day_--Gagging her.\r\n\r\n     \"_Third Day_--Voting that she shall stay gagged. Having thus\r\n     disposed of the main question, we presume the incidentals will be\r\n     finished this morning.\"\r\n\r\nAntoinette Brown was asked why she went to that Convention, knowing,\r\nas she must, that she would be rejected.\r\n\r\n     \"I went there,\" she said, \"to assert a principle--a principle\r\n     relevant to the circumstances of that convention, and one which\r\n     would promote _all_ good causes and retard _all_ bad ones. I went\r\n     there, as an item of the world, to contend that the sons and\r\n     daughters of the race, without distinction of sex, sect, class or\r\n     color, should be recognized as belonging to the world, and I\r\n     planted my feet upon the simple _rights of a delegate_. I asked\r\n     no favor as a woman, or in behalf of woman; no favor as a woman\r\n     advocating temperance; no recognition of the cause of woman above\r\n     the cause of humanity; the indorsement of no 'ism' and of no\r\n     measure; but I claimed, in the name of the world, the rights of a\r\n     delegate in a world's convention.\r\n\r\n     \"Is it asked. Why did you make that issue at that time? I answer,\r\n     I have made it at all times and in all places, whenever and\r\n     wherever Providence has given me the opportunity, and in whatever\r\n     way it could be made to appear most prominent. Last spring, when\r\n     woman claimed the supremacy--the right to hold all the offices in\r\n     the Woman's State Temperance Society--I contended, from this\r\n     platform, for the equality of man; the equal rights of all the\r\n     members of this society. I have claimed everywhere the equality\r\n     of humanity in Church and in State; God helping me, I here pledge\r\n     myself anew to Him, and to you all, to be true everywhere to the\r\n     central principle--the soul of the Divine commandment, 'Thou\r\n     shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.' The temperance cause was not\r\n     injured by our course at that Convention. We went there with\r\n     thoughtful hearts. Said Wendell Phillips: 'Take courage, and\r\n     remember that whether you are received or rejected, you are going\r\n     to make the most effectual speech for temperance, for woman, and\r\n     humanity that you have ever made in your life.' 'God bless you,'\r\n     were the fervent words of Mr. Channing, in a moment when there\r\n     was most need of Divine assistance; and when I stood on the\r\n     platform for an hour and a half, waiting to be heard, I could\r\n     read in the faces of men such as these, and in the faces, too, of\r\n     our opposers, the calm assurance, 'You are making the most\r\n     effectual speech for temperance, for woman, and humanity, that\r\n     you have ever made in your life.' I believed it then; I believe\r\n     it now.\"[101]\r\n\r\nRev. William Henry Channing, in giving his report of the World's\r\nTemperance Convention to the Toronto Division of Sons of Temperance of\r\nthe City of Rochester, said:\r\n\r\n     And now it becomes my disagreeable duty, as one of your\r\n     delegates, to report to the Toronto Division how my highly\r\n     honored fellow-delegate was treated. Her credentials were\r\n     received without dissent; she was, of course, then entitled,\r\n     _equally_ with every other delegate, to take part in all the\r\n     proceedings of the Conventions. At a suitable time and in a\r\n     perfectly orderly manner she rose to speak; the floor was\r\n     adjudged to her by Hon. Neal Dow, the President, but her right to\r\n     the platform was questioned. Again and again the President\r\n     declared your delegate to be in order; again and again appeal was\r\n     made to the Convention and the decision of the President\r\n     sustained; but a factious minority succeeded in silencing her\r\n     voice, and so ended the first session in storm.\r\n\r\n     On the second morning your delegate wisely waited until the\r\n     resolutions offered to the convention by the Business Committee\r\n     were opened for discussion. When the first resolution, declaring\r\n     the _religious character_ of the Temperance Movement, was\r\n     submitted to the meeting, Miss Brown rose to speak. She rose\r\n     calmly in the body of the house; she was a minister of religion,\r\n     an advocate of temperance; she had it in her heart to press this\r\n     reformation onward in a religious spirit; she had avoided all\r\n     disputes on petty points of order, and now wished to address\r\n     herself earnestly to the momentous theme. Had she not a perfect\r\n     right to do so? And what fitter occasion could occur? The very\r\n     topic was of a kind to banish personalities and hush low\r\n     passions. Your delegate was invited by the President to take the\r\n     platform; she did so with quiet dignity, but scarcely had she\r\n     reached the stand when all around her on the platform itself, and\r\n     among the officers of the Convention, began that disgraceful row,\r\n     which led an onlooker in the gallery to cry out, \"Are those men\r\n     drunk?\" I have no wish to dwell upon that cowardly transaction,\r\n     but this remark I am bound in honor to make: If any man says that\r\n     Antoinette Brown forced the subject of \"Woman's Rights\" on that\r\n     Temperance Convention in plain Saxon speech, _He Lies_. She never\r\n     dreamed of asking any _privilege_ as a woman; she stood there in\r\n     her _right_ as a delegate; her aim was to urge forward the\r\n     Temperance Reform. No! the whole uproar on \"Woman's Rights\" came\r\n     from the professed friends of Temperance, and began with the\r\n     insulting cry--from a man on the platform--of, \"Shame on the\r\n     woman!\" That man I need hardly tell you was the notorious John\r\n     Chambers, of Philadelphia--the so-called Rev. John Chambers!--he\r\n     it was who, with brazen face and clanging tongue, stood stamping\r\n     until he raised a cloud of dust around him, pointing with coarse\r\n     finger and rudely shouting \"shame on the woman,\" until he even\r\n     stood abashed before the indignant cry from the Convention of\r\n     \"shame on John Chambers.\"\r\n\r\n     The Reverend John Chambers! _Reverend_ for what? For his piety;\r\n     manifested in the fact that he, a professed minister of the\r\n     gospel, could by rowdy tumult drown the voice of another minister\r\n     of the gospel while she was asserting the religious character of\r\n     the Temperance Reform! _Reverend_ for what? For his charity;\r\n     manifested by low cries and insulting gestures, to a gentlewoman\r\n     who stood there firm yet meek, before him! Strange that he, of\r\n     all, should thus seek a bad eminence in outraging the decencies\r\n     of social life; for unless report is false, John Chambers owes\r\n     whatever position he may have to woman. It is said--I believe on\r\n     good authority--that he was educated for the ministry by the\r\n     contributions of women; that he preaches in a church built and\r\n     endowed by a woman; that his salary is chiefly paid by\r\n     hard-working needle-women; finally, that he married a rich wife!\r\n     Now what a sight was there! A man, whose brain had been fed with\r\n     books by woman, whose body had been fattened with bread by woman,\r\n     every fragment and stitch of whose ministerial garb, from his\r\n     collar to his boot-heels, had been paid for by woman, whose very\r\n     traveling ticket to that convention had been bought by woman,\r\n     could find no better way to discharge his mission as minister of\r\n     the gospel than to point his finger and shout, \"Shame on the\r\n     woman!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Channing then bore his testimony to the admirable combination of\r\nenergy and mildness, by which Miss Brown's whole air and manner were\r\ndistinguished amid these hours of tumult. He said: \"Such serene\r\nstrength comes only from religious principle and life. I know not how\r\nit may have been with nerves and pulses--there was no apparent tremor.\r\nBut of this I am assured, whatever disturbance there was in the outer\r\ncourt of the Temple, in the Holy of Holies was the heart of peace, and\r\nthe dove of the Spirit brooded in light on the tabernacle of\r\nconscience.\"\r\n\r\nIn an editorial of _The Una_, headed \"Rev. John Chambers Recommended\r\nto Mercy,\" Mrs. Davis says: \"We publish the letter of Rev. Wm. Henry\r\nChanning because it is a noble defence of woman and a part of the\r\nhistory of the movement. We do not give Mr. Chambers' reply, 1st,\r\nBecause we find in it no evidence of penitence nor any testimony as to\r\nwho was the guilty party--if he was not; and 2d, Because the tone and\r\nlanguage of the letter is of a character we trust will never sully the\r\npages of _The Una_. Mr. Channing's rebuke is severe, but we believe it\r\nto have been richly deserved and given in true Christian love.\"\r\n\r\n                                   ROCHESTER, N. Y., Oct. 18, 1853.\r\n\r\n     EDITORS SUNDAY MERCURY:--You ask for proof that Rev. John\r\n     Chambers took part in the brutal insult offered to a Christian\r\n     gentlewoman at the late \"World's Temperance Convention.\" I was\r\n     _witness_ of the conduct of that man and his abettors during that\r\n     _cowardly transaction_, and I hereby charge him with being a\r\n     ringleader in that platform row.\r\n\r\n     When my honored friend and fellow-delegate, the Rev. Antoinette\r\n     L. Brown, was standing calm, yet firm, amidst those rude\r\n     scoffers, the words of the Psalmist kept sounding in my ear:\r\n     \"Strong bulls of Bashan have beset me roundabout, gaping upon me\r\n     with their mouths.\" I marked the _biggest_ of the herd with the\r\n     purpose, at the first suitable season, of laying on one blow of\r\n     the lash with such a will that it should cut through any hide,\r\n     however callous. That season came when, as a delegate, I was\r\n     called upon to report to the \"Toronto Division of the Sons of\r\n     Temperance\" how my fellow-delegate had been treated.\r\n\r\n     But having thus _indicted the bully_ and put him on trial in open\r\n     court, I merely record my testimony and leave him to go to\r\n     judgment; the public will render a verdict, pass sentence, and\r\n     inflict the _penalty_ in the pillory where he has placed himself;\r\n     may their justice be tempered with mercy. It was necessary, in\r\n     order to _protect women_ in future from the _insolence of\r\n     tyrants_, to make this example; yet let him be cordially pardoned\r\n     as soon as he gives sincere proof of penitence.\r\n\r\n                                             WILLIAM HENRY CHANNING.\r\n\r\nAnother letter of Mr. Channing's of same date to the editor of _The\r\nDaily Register_:\r\n\r\n     SIR:--Respect for yourself, your readers, and your paper, prompts\r\n     me to reply at once to your article headed, \"Answer,\" etc., by\r\n     Rev. John Chambers, which, through the courtesy of some friend,\r\n     reached me last evening. I must be frank, but will aim to be\r\n     brief.\r\n\r\n     And first, Mr. Birney, a word to yourself. You knew me in \"former\r\n     days as mild,\" etc., and were not prepared for such a speech; you\r\n     charitably suggest that its \"vindictiveness\" may be owing to a\r\n     substitution of the reporter's language for my own, and \"are not\r\n     without hope of seeing a disclaimer.\" Now, far from wishing to\r\n     disclaim the _one real accusation_ made in my remarks, I am\r\n     ready, anywhere and everywhere, to reiterate that charge. Yet\r\n     there is no \"vindictiveness\" in my heart toward the criminal whom\r\n     I thus arraign, and no emotion which I should not honor any man\r\n     for feeling toward myself, if I was consciously guilty of having\r\n     played so base a part. You were not wrong in thinking me \"mild in\r\n     former days\"; I trust I am milder now than then. But my mildness\r\n     never was, and never will be, of that mean quality, which can\r\n     tamely see a sister insulted, whether by a pugilist from the\r\n     ring, or by a _rowdy from the pulpit_. My principle is peace, but\r\n     I remember the saying, \"You can not become an angel till you are\r\n     first a man.\".... Womanhood, as such, claims honorable courtesy\r\n     of every manly heart; and he is unmanly who does not rejoice to\r\n     testify this respect. The man who can be rude to even a poor\r\n     prostitute in the street, will be rude to wife or daughter at his\r\n     own fireside; while he who is a _gentle_ man to any woman, will\r\n     be a _gentle_ man to all women. _His spirit is brutal_, who could\r\n     ever dream of applying the slang phrase \"creature\" to any woman\r\n     under any conceivable conditions. What shall be thought then of\r\n     the moral grade of him who chose as the mark for his missiles of\r\n     \"contempt,\" a young lady of rare refinement in her whole presence\r\n     and manner, of spotless delicacy and gentlest dignity, of\r\n     commanding talent and philanthropic earnestness, and who stood\r\n     there before him, serene amid the tumult, clad, even then, in the\r\n     bright robe of heavenly peace?\r\n\r\n     And now one word in closing. Let Mr. Chambers, and all of like\r\n     spirit, be assured, that I am but a representative of a large,\r\n     rapidly growing, and influential body in every community\r\n     throughout our land, who are resolved, that women shall no longer\r\n     be insulted in public assemblies with impunity.\r\n\r\n                                             WM. HENRY CHANNING.\r\n\r\nThrough this fierce conflict Horace Greeley, with his personal\r\npresence on the platform, and his brave editorials in the _New York\r\nTribune_, fought a great battle for free speech and human equality.\r\nSpeaking of the _Whole_ World's Convention, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _New York Tribune, September 3, 1853._\r\n\r\n     This has been the most spirited and able Convention on behalf of\r\n     temperance that was ever held. It has already done good, and can\r\n     not fail to do more. The scarcity of white neck-ties on the\r\n     platform so fully atoned for by the presence of such champions of\r\n     reform and humanity as Antoinette L. Brown, Lucy Stone, and Mrs.\r\n     Jackson, of England, Mrs. C I. H. Nichols, Mrs. Frances D. Gage,\r\n     etc., that like the absence of wine from our festive board when\r\n     it is graced by women, it was the theme of no general or very\r\n     pointed regret. It was a great occasion, and we know truth was\r\n     there uttered which will bear fruit through coming years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Tribune, September 7, 1853._\r\n\r\n     When the call of the World's Temperance Convention was issued, we\r\n     were appealed to by valued friends, whom we know as devoted to\r\n     the temperance cause, to discountenance all efforts to get up a\r\n     rival Convention. \"The call is unexceptionably broad,\" we were\r\n     reminded, \"it invites all and excludes nobody, then why not\r\n     accept it and hold but one Convention?\" The question was fair and\r\n     forcible, and had there been no antecedents we should have\r\n     acceded to its object. But we could not forget the preliminary\r\n     meeting at the Brick Church Chapel, and we could not take the\r\n     hazard of having many whom we knew as among the most efficient\r\n     and faithful laborers in the Temperance cause shut out of a\r\n     World's Convention of its advocates; so we cast our lot with them\r\n     about whose catholicity of sentiment and action there could be no\r\n     dispute, and yesterday's doings at the Metropolitan Convention\r\n     maintained the conviction created by the whole World's Convention\r\n     that our decision was right.\r\n\r\n     We ask especial attention to the proceedings of the World's\r\n     Convention yesterday morning, particularly with reference to\r\n     Antoinette Brown, who had been chosen by two separate temperance\r\n     organizations of men to represent them at this Convention. How\r\n     she was received, how treated, and how virtually crowded off the\r\n     platform, our report most faithfully exhibits. They who are sure\r\n     that the Age of Chivalry is not gone, are urged to ponder this\r\n     treatment of a pure and high-souled woman, a teacher of Christian\r\n     truth, an ornament of her sex, and an example to all, by a\r\n     Convention of Reformers and Gentlemen, many of them from that\r\n     section of the Union where the defence of woman from insult has\r\n     been deemed a manly grace, if not a manly duty. We presume the\r\n     matter will be further considered to-day.\r\n\r\n     Of the _Whole_ World's Temperance Convention a correspondent of\r\n     _The Una_ says: \"Throughout, the meeting has been one of intense\r\n     interest; not a moment's flagging, not a poor or unworthy speech\r\n     made by either man or woman. Again and again, as we passed into\r\n     the large hall, filled with eager listeners, we felt it to be one\r\n     of the most sublime scenes we had ever looked upon. There the\r\n     audience remained, hour after hour, patient, earnest, full of\r\n     enthusiasm, and yet hundreds could scarcely hear a single\r\n     connected sentence. The majority were women, but the larger\r\n     number of the speakers were men. The right and equality being\r\n     recognized, there was no longer a necessity for controversy to\r\n     maintain principle, hence no woman attempted to speak except she\r\n     had something to say. Mrs. Jackson, of England, Mrs. Nichols,\r\n     Mrs. Vaughan, Miss Stone, Rev. A. L. Brown, Lucretia Mott, and\r\n     Mrs. F. D. Gage addressed the Convention during the different\r\n     sessions.\"\r\n\r\n     The same correspondent says of the _World's_ Temperance\r\n     Convention: \"There was one feature more anomalous than the\r\n     rejection and gagging of Miss Brown, darker and far more cruel,\r\n     for it has not the excuse of custom, nor can the Bible be\r\n     tortured into any justification of it. This was the exclusion of\r\n     Dr. James McCune Smith, a gentleman, a graduate of the Edinburgh\r\n     University, a member of a long-established temperance society,\r\n     and a regularly appointed delegate. And wherefore? simply for the\r\n     reason that nature had bestowed on his complexion a darker,\r\n     richer tint than upon some of the sycophants who gathered there;\r\n     it appears to have been simply to pander to a bigoted priesthood\r\n     and a corrupt populace.\"\r\n\r\nIn deciding the action of the Convention to be worse in its treatment\r\ntoward Mr. Smith than toward Miss Brown, we think _The Una_\r\ncorrespondent makes a grave mistake.\r\n\r\nIn point of courtesy the treatment of a lady of culture and\r\nrefinement, the peer of any man in that assembly, with the\r\nunpardonable rudeness they did, was infinitely worse than to have done\r\nthe same thing to any man, white or black, because by every code of\r\nhonor or chivalry all men are bound to defend woman. Again, as a\r\nquestion of morals, custom, and prejudice, they occupied the same\r\nposition in the State and the Church. The \"white male\" in the\r\nConstitutions placed women and black men on the same platform as\r\ncitizens. The popular interpretation of Scripture sanctioned the same\r\ninjustice in both cases. In the mouths of the false prophets,\r\n\"Servants, obey your masters,\" was used for the same purpose, and with\r\nequal effect, as \"Wives, be in subjection to your own husbands.\"\r\n\"Servant of servants shall he be\" has been used with the same\r\nprophetic force as the more cruel curse pronounced on woman. The white\r\nman's Bible has been uniformly used to show that the degradation of\r\nthe woman and the black man was in harmony with God's will. On what\r\nprinciple is proscription on account of color more cruel than on\r\naccount of sex?\r\n\r\nMost of the liberal men and women now withdrew from all temperance\r\norganizations, leaving the movement in the hands of time-serving\r\npriests and politicians, who, being in the majority, effectually\r\nblocked the progress of the reform for the time--destroying, as they\r\ndid, the enthusiasm of the women in trying to press it as a moral\r\nprinciple, and the hope of the men, who intended to carry it as a\r\npolitical measure. Henceforward women took no active part in\r\ntemperance until the Ohio crusade revived them again all over the\r\nnation, and gathered the scattered forces into \"The Woman's National\r\nChristian Temperance Union,\" of which Miss Frances E. Willard is\r\npresident. As now, so in 1853, intelligent women saw that the most\r\ndirect way to effect any reform was to have a voice in the laws and\r\nlawmakers. Hence they turned their attention to rolling up petitions\r\nfor the civil and political rights of women, to hearings before\r\nlegislatures and constitutional conventions, giving their most\r\npersistent efforts to the reform technically called \"Woman's Rights.\"\r\n\r\nSusan B. Anthony had a similar battle to fight in the educational\r\nconventions. Having been a successful teacher in the State of New York\r\nfifteen years of her life, she had seen the need of many improvements\r\nin the mode of teaching and in the sanitary arrangements of school\r\nbuildings; and more than all, the injustice to women in their half-pay\r\nas teachers. Her interest in educational conventions was first roused\r\nby listening to a tedious discussion at Elmira on the \"Divine\r\nordinance\" of flogging children, in which Charles Anthony, principal\r\nof the Albany Academy, quoted Solomon's injunction, \"Spare the rod,\r\nand spoil the child.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1853, the annual convention being held in Rochester, her place of\r\nresidence, Miss Anthony conscientiously attended all the sessions\r\nthrough three entire days. After having listened for hours to a\r\ndiscussion as to the reason why the profession of teacher was not as\r\nmuch respected as that of the lawyer, minister, or doctor, without\r\nonce, as she thought, touching the kernel of the question, she arose\r\nto untie for them the Gordian knot, and said, \"Mr. President.\" If all\r\nthe witches that had been drowned, burned, and hung in the Old World\r\nand the New had suddenly appeared on the platform, threatening\r\nvengeance for their wrongs, the officers of that convention could not\r\nhave been thrown into greater consternation.\r\n\r\nThere stood that Quaker girl, calm and self-possessed, while with\r\nhasty consultations, running to and fro, those frightened men could\r\nnot decide what to do; how to receive this audacious invader of their\r\nsphere of action. At length President Davies, of West Point, in fall\r\ndress, buff vest, blue coat, gilt buttons, stepped to the front, and\r\nsaid, in a tremulous, mocking tone, \"What will the lady have?\" \"I\r\nwish, sir, to speak to the question under discussion,\" Miss Anthony\r\nreplied. The Professor, more perplexed than before, said: \"What is the\r\npleasure of the Convention?\" A gentleman moved that she should be\r\nheard; another seconded the motion; whereupon a discussion pro and con\r\nfollowed, lasting full half an hour, when a vote of the men only was\r\ntaken, and permission granted by a small majority; and lucky for her,\r\ntoo, was it, that the thousand women crowding that hall could not vote\r\non the question, for they would have given a solid \"no.\" The president\r\nthen announced the vote, and said: \"The lady can speak.\"\r\n\r\nWe can easily imagine the embarrassment under which Miss Anthony arose\r\nafter that half hour of suspense, and the bitter hostility she noted\r\non every side. However, with a clear, distinct voice, which filled the\r\nhall, she said: \"It seems to me, gentlemen, that none of you quite\r\ncomprehend the cause of the disrespect of which you complain. Do you\r\nnot see that so long as society says a woman is incompetent to be a\r\nlawyer, minister, or doctor, but has ample ability to be a teacher,\r\nthat every man of you who chooses this profession tacitly acknowledges\r\nthat he has no more brains than a woman? And this, too, is the reason\r\nthat teaching is a less lucrative profession, as here men must compete\r\nwith the cheap labor of woman. Would you exalt your profession, exalt\r\nthose who labor with you. Would you make it more lucrative, increase\r\nthe salaries of the women engaged in the noble work of educating our\r\nfuture Presidents, Senators, and Congressmen.\"\r\n\r\nThis said, Miss Anthony took her seat, amid the profoundest silence,\r\nbroken at last by three gentlemen, Messrs. Cruttenden, Coburn, and\r\nFanning, walking down the broad aisle to congratulate the speaker on\r\nher pluck and perseverance, and the pertinency of her remarks. The\r\neditor of _The Rochester Democrat_ said the next morning, that\r\n\"whatever the schoolmasters might think of Miss Anthony, it was\r\nevident that she hit the nail on the head.\"\r\n\r\nTo give the women of to-day some idea of what it cost those who first\r\nthrust themselves into these conventions, at the close of the session\r\nMiss A. heard women remarking: \"Did you ever see anything like this\r\nperformance?\" \"I was actually ashamed of my sex.\" \"I felt so mortified\r\nI really wished the floor would open and swallow me up.\" \"Who can that\r\ncreature be?\" \"She must be a dreadful woman to get up that way and\r\nspeak in public.\" \"I was so mad at those three men making such a\r\nparade to shake hands with her; that will just encourage her to speak\r\nagain.\" These ladies had probably all been to theatres, concerts,\r\noperas, and gone into ecstasies over Fanny Kemble, Rachel, and Jenny\r\nLind; and Fanny Elsler, balanced on one toe, the other foot in the\r\nair, without having their delicacy shocked in the least. But a simple\r\nQuaker girl rising in a teachers' convention to make a common-sense\r\nremark modestly, dressed, making no display of her neck, or arms, or\r\nlegs, so tried their delicate sensibilities that they were almost\r\nafraid to attend the next session.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the next morning's session, after Miss Anthony's\r\ndébut, Professor Davies, in all his majesty and pomposity, with his\r\nthumbs in the arm-holes of his regulation buff vest, called the\r\nConvention to order, and said: \"I have been asked by several persons,\r\nwhy no provisions have been made for women to speak, and vote, and act\r\non committees, in these assemblies?\" My answer is, \"Be hold yonder\r\nbeautiful pilaster of this superb hall! contemplate its pedestal, its\r\nshaft, its rich entablature, the crowning glory of the whole. Each and\r\nall the parts in their appropriate place contribute to the strength,\r\nsymmetry, and beauty of the whole. Could I aid in taking down that\r\nmagnificent entablature from its proud elevation, and placing it in\r\nthe dust and dirt that surround the pedestal? Neither could I drag\r\ndown the mother, wife, and daughter, whom we worship as beings of a\r\nhigher order, on the common plane of life with ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nIf all men were pedestals and shafts capable of holding the women of\r\ntheir households above the dirt and dust of common life, in a serene\r\natmosphere of peace and plenty, the good professor's remarks would\r\nhave had some significance; but as the burdens of existence rest\r\nequally on the shoulders of men and women, and we must ever struggle\r\ntogether on a common plane for bread, his metaphor has no foundation.\r\nMiss Anthony attended these teachers' conventions from year to year,\r\nat Oswego, Utica, Poughkeepsie, Lockport, Syracuse, making the same\r\ndemands for equal place and pay, until she had the satisfaction to see\r\nevery right conceded. Women speaking and voting on all questions;\r\nappointed on committees, and to prepare reports and addresses, elected\r\nofficers of the Association, and seated on the platforms. In 1856, she\r\nwas chairman of a committee herself, to report on the question of\r\nco-education; and at Troy, before a magnificent audience of the most\r\nintelligent men and women of the State, she read her report, which the\r\npress pronounced able and conclusive. The President, Mr. Hazeltine, of\r\nNew York, congratulating Miss Anthony on her address, said: \"As much\r\nas I am compelled to admire your rhetoric and logic, the matter and\r\nmanner of your address and its delivery, I would rather follow a\r\ndaughter of mine to her grave, than to have her deliver such an\r\naddress before such an assembly.\" Superintendent Randall, overhearing\r\nthe President, added: \"I should be proud, Madam, if I had a daughter\r\ncapable of making such an eloquent and finished argument, before this\r\nor any assembly of men and women. I congratulate you on your\r\ntriumphant success.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1857, at Binghamton, Professor Fowler, of Rochester, took up the\r\ngauntlet thrown down by Miss Anthony, and presented the other side of\r\nthe question, taking the ground that boys and girls should not be\r\neducated together, and that women should not be paid equal wages even\r\nfor equally good work. The gentlemen who sustained the side demanding\r\nequal rights for women in these conventions, were Randall, Rice,\r\nCruttenden, Cavert, Fanning, Johonett, Coburn, Wilder, and Farnham.\r\nThe opposition was led by Davies, Valentine, Buckley, Anthony (not S.\r\nB. A.), Ross, an old bachelor, the butt of ridicule, the clown of the\r\nConvention; and McElligott, the latter hardly ranking with the rest,\r\nfor though opposed, he was always a gentleman, the others being\r\nofttimes so coarse in their sneers and innuendoes, that they disgraced\r\nthe positions they occupied, as the educators of the youth of the\r\nState. In the discussion at Binghamton, where Miss Anthony introduced\r\na resolution in favor of co-education, Mr. McElligott said \"he was in\r\nfavor of allowing her full and equal opportunity with any other member\r\nto present resolutions, or to call them up for discussion. Standing up\r\nas she does before large audiences, to advocate what she\r\nconscientiously considers the rights and privileges of her sex, gives\r\na touch of moral sublimity to our proceedings worthy the admiration of\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Davies denounced the resolutions in the strongest terms. \"He\r\nhad for four years been trying to escape this discussion; but if the\r\nquestion must come, let it be boldly met and disposed of. These\r\nresolutions involve a great social rather than an educational\r\nquestion, calculated to introduce a vast social evil; they are the\r\nfirst step in that school which seeks to abolish marriage, and behind\r\nthe picture presented by them, I see a monster of deformity.\"[102]\r\n\r\nIn view of the grand experiment of co-education, so successful in\r\nevery part of our country, the fears of those timid men thirty years\r\nago provoke nothing now but a passing smile. How few of them with a\r\nsober face could at this time defend their old positions. It is\r\ncreditable to the stronger sex that so many men in all those\r\nencounters, took no counsel with their fears nor prejudices, but\r\nseeing the principle steadfastly maintained it.\r\n\r\nBut the temperance and educational conventions, the clergy and the\r\npedagogues, were alike abandoned now for the legislators. All this\r\nescapading of Miss Anthony's was mere child's play, compared with the\r\nsteady bombardment kept up until the war on the legislators of the\r\nEmpire State. Calls, appeals, petitions to rouse the women, fell like\r\nsnow-flakes in every county, asking for the civil and political rights\r\nof woman; they were carried into the Legislature, frequent hearings\r\nsecured, the members debating the question as hotly there as it had\r\nalready been discussed in popular conventions. As New York could boast\r\na larger number of strong-minded women than any other State, whose\r\ncontinuity of purpose knew no variableness nor shadow of turning, the\r\nagitation was persistently continued in all directions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SYRACUSE NATIONAL CONVENTION,\r\n\r\n_September 8, 9, and 10, 1852._\r\n\r\nThis Convention, lasting three days, was in many respects remarkable,\r\neven for that \"City of Conventions.\" It called out immense audiences,\r\nattracted many eminent persons from different points of the State, and\r\nwas most favorably noticed by the press; the debates were unusually\r\nearnest and brilliant, and the proceedings orderly and harmonious\r\nthroughout. Notwithstanding an admission fee of one shilling, the City\r\nHall was densely packed at every session, and at the hour of\r\nadjournment it was with difficulty that the audience could gain the\r\nstreet. The preliminary[103] editorials of the city papers reflected\r\ntheir own conservative or progressive tendencies.\r\n\r\nIn no one respect were the participants in these early Conventions\r\nmore unsparingly ridiculed, and more maliciously falsified, than in\r\ntheir personal appearance; it may therefore be wise to say that in\r\ndignity and grace of manner and style of dress, the majority of these\r\nladies were superior to the mass of women; while the neat and\r\nunadorned Quaker costume was worn by some, many others were elegantly\r\nand fashionably attired; two of them in such extreme style as to call\r\nforth much criticism from the majority, to whom a happy medium seemed\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nThe Convention was called to order by Paulina Wright Davis, chairman\r\nof the Central Committee, and prayer offered by the Rev. Samuel J.\r\nMay, pastor of the Unitarian Church in Syracuse.\r\n\r\nAlthough this was the first Woman's Rights Convention at which Mr. May\r\nwas ever present, he had been represented in nearly all by letter, and\r\nas early as 1845 had preached an able sermon advocating the social,\r\ncivil, and political rights of woman. He had been an early convert to\r\nthis doctrine, and enjoyed telling the manner of his conversion.\r\nSpeaking once in Providence on the question of slavery, he\r\nwas attracted by the earnest attention he received from an\r\nintelligent-looking woman. At the close of the meeting, she said to\r\nhim: \"I have listened to you with an interest that only a woman can\r\nfeel. I doubt whether you see how much of your description of the\r\nhelpless dependence of slaves applies equally to all women.\" She ran\r\nthe parallel rapidly, quoting law and custom, maintaining her\r\nassertion so perfectly that Mr. May's eyes were opened at once, and he\r\npromised the lady to give the subject his immediate consideration.\r\n\r\nLucy Stone read the call[104] and expressed the wish that every one\r\npresent, even if averse to the new demands by women, would take part\r\nin the debates, as it was the truth on this question its advocates\r\nwere seeking. Among the most noticeable features of these early\r\nConventions was the welcome given to opposing arguments.\r\n\r\nThe Nominating Committee reported the list of officers,[105] with\r\nLucretia Mott as permanent President. She asked that the vote be taken\r\nseparately, as there might be objections to her appointment. The\r\nentire audience (except her husband, who gave an emphatic \"No!\") voted\r\nin her favor. The very fact that Mrs. Mott consented, under any\r\ncircumstances, to preside over a promiscuous assemblage, was proof of\r\nthe progress of liberal ideas, as four years previously she had\r\nstrenuously opposed placing a woman in that position, and as a member\r\nof the Society of Friends, by presiding over a meeting to which there\r\nwas an admission fee, she rendered herself liable to expulsion. The\r\nvote being taken, Mrs. Mott, who sat far back in the audience, walked\r\nforward to the platform, her sweet face and placid manners at once\r\nwinning the confidence of the audience. This impression was further\r\ndeepened by her opening remarks. She said she was unpracticed in\r\nparliamentary proceedings, and felt herself incompetent to fulfill the\r\nduties of the position now pressed upon her, and was quite unprepared\r\nto make a suitable speech. She asked the serious and respectful\r\nattention of the Convention to the business before them, referred to\r\nthe success that had thus far attended the movement, the respect shown\r\nby the press, and the favor with which the public generally had\r\nreceived these new demands, and closed by inviting the cordial\r\nco-operation of all present.\r\n\r\nIn commenting upon Mrs. Mott's opening address, the press of the city\r\ndeclared it to have been \"better expressed and far more appropriate\r\nthan those heard on similar occasions in political and legislative\r\nassemblages.\" The choice of Mrs. Mott as President was pre-eminently\r\nwise; of mature years, a member of the Society of Friends, in which\r\nwoman was held as an equal, with undoubted right to speak in public,\r\nand the still broader experience of the Anti-Slavery platform, she\r\nwas well fitted to guide the proceedings and encourage the expression\r\nof opinions from those to whom public speaking was an untried\r\nexperiment. \"It was a singular spectacle,\" said the _Syracuse\r\nStandard_, \"to see this gray-haired matron presiding over a Convention\r\nwith an ease, dignity, and grace that might be envied by the most\r\nexperienced legislator in the country.\"\r\n\r\nDelegates were present from Canada and eight different States. Letters\r\nwere received from Mrs. Marion Reid, of England, author of an able\r\nwork upon woman; from John Neal, of Maine, the veteran temperance\r\nreformer; from William Lloyd Garrison, Rev. William Henry Channing,\r\nRev. A. D. Mayo, Margaret H. Andrews, Sarah D. Fish, Angelina Grimké\r\nWeld, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, from G. W. Johnson, chairman of the\r\nState Committee of the Liberty party, and Horace Greeley, the\r\nworld-renowned editor of the _Tribune_. Mr. Johnson's letter enclosed\r\nten dollars and the following sentiments: 1. Woman has, equally with\r\nman, the inalienable right to education, suffrage, office, property,\r\nprofessions, titles, and honors--to life, liberty, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness. 2. False to our sex, as well as her own, and false to\r\nherself and to God, is the woman who approves, or who submits without\r\nresistance or protest, to the social and political wrongs imposed upon\r\nher in common with the rest of her sex throughout the world.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton's letter[106] presented three suggestions for the\r\nconsideration of the Convention, viz.: That all women owning property\r\nshould refuse to pay taxes as long as unrepresented; that man and\r\nwoman should be educated together, and the abuse of the religious\r\nelement in woman. This letter created much discussion, accompanied as\r\nit was by a series of resolutions of the most radical character, which\r\nwere finally, with one exception, adopted. Thus at that early day was\r\nthe action of those women, who have since refused to pay taxes,\r\nprefigured and suggested. One of the remarkable aspects of this\r\nreform, is the fact that from the first its full significance was seen\r\nby many of the women who inaugurated it.\r\n\r\n                         HORACE GREELEY'S LETTER.\r\n\r\n                                        NEW YORK, _Sept. 1, 1852_.\r\n\r\n     MY FRIEND:--I have once or twice been urged to attend a\r\n     Convention of the advocates of woman's rights; and though\r\n     compliance has never been within my power, I have a right to\r\n     infer that some friends of the cause desire suggestions from me\r\n     with regard to the best means of advancing it. I therefore\r\n     venture to submit some thoughts on that subject. To my mind the\r\n     BREAD problem lies at the base of all the desirable and practical\r\n     reforms which our age meditates. Not that bread is intrinsically\r\n     more important to man than Temperance, Intelligence, Morality,\r\n     and Religion, but that it is essential to the just appreciation\r\n     of all these. Vainly do we preach the blessings of temperance to\r\n     human beings cradled in hunger, and suffering at intervals the\r\n     agonies of famine; idly do we commend intellectual culture to\r\n     those whose minds are daily racked with the dark problem, \"How\r\n     shall we procure food for the morrow?\" Morality, religion, are\r\n     but words to him who fishes in the gutters for the means of\r\n     sustaining life, and crouches behind barrels in the street for\r\n     shelter from the cutting blasts of a winter's night.\r\n\r\n     Before all questions of intellectual training or political\r\n     franchises for women, not to speak of such a trifle as costume,\r\n     do I place the question of enlarged opportunities for work; of a\r\n     more extended and diversified field of employment. The silk\r\n     culture and manufacture firmly established and thriftily\r\n     prosecuted to the extent of our home demand for silk, would be\r\n     worth everything to American women. Our now feeble and infantile\r\n     schools of design should be encouraged with the same view. A\r\n     wider and more prosperous development of our Manufacturing\r\n     Industry will increase the demand for female labor, thus\r\n     enhancing its average reward and elevating the social position of\r\n     woman. I trust the future has, therefore, much good in store for\r\n     the less muscular half of the human race.\r\n\r\n     But the reform here anticipated should be inaugurated in our own\r\n     households. I know how idle is the expectation of any general and\r\n     permanent enhancement of the wages of any class or condition\r\n     above the level of equation of Supply and Demand; yet it seems to\r\n     me that the friends of woman's rights may wisely and worthily set\r\n     the example of paying juster prices for female assistance in\r\n     their households than those now current. If they would but\r\n     resolve never to pay a capable, efficient woman less than\r\n     two-thirds the wages paid to a vigorous, effective man employed\r\n     in some corresponding vocation, they would very essentially aid\r\n     the movement now in progress for the general recognition and\r\n     conception of Equal Rights to Woman.\r\n\r\n     Society is clearly unjust to woman in according her but four to\r\n     eight dollars per month for labor equally repugnant with, and\r\n     more protracted than that of men of equal intelligence and\r\n     relative efficiency, whose services command from ten to twenty\r\n     dollars per month. If, then, the friends of Woman's Rights could\r\n     set the world an example of paying for female service, not the\r\n     lowest pittance which stern Necessity may compel the defenceless\r\n     to accept, but as approximately fair and liberal compensation for\r\n     the work actually done, as determined by a careful comparison\r\n     with the recompense of other labor, I believe they would give\r\n     their cause an impulse which could not be permanently resisted.\r\n\r\n                       With profound esteem, yours,\r\n                                                        HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\n     MRS. PAULINA W. DAVIS, Providence, R. I.\r\n\r\nMr. Greeley's letter bore two remarkable aspects. First, he recognized\r\nthe poverty of woman as closely connected with her degradation. One\r\nof the brightest anti-slavery orators was at that time in the habit of\r\nsaying, \"It is not the press, nor the pulpit, which rules the country,\r\nbut the counting-room\"; proving his assertion by showing the greater\r\npower of commerce and money, than of intellect and morality. So Mr.\r\nGreeley saw the purse to be woman's first need; that she must control\r\nmoney in order to help herself to freedom.\r\n\r\nSecond, ignoring woman's pauperized condition just admitted, he\r\nsuggested that women engaged in this reform should pay those employed\r\nin the household larger wages than was customary, although these very\r\nwomen were dependent upon others for their shelter, food, and clothes;\r\nso impossible is it for a governing class to understand the\r\nhelplessness of dependents, and to fully comprehend the disabilities\r\nof a subject class.\r\n\r\nThe declaration of sentiments[107] adopted at the Westchester\r\nConvention was read by Martha C. Wright, and commented upon as follows\r\nby\r\n\r\n     CLARINA HOWARD NICHOLS: There _is_ no limit to personal\r\n     responsibility. Our duties are as wide as the world, and as\r\n     far-reaching as the bounds of human endeavor. Woman and man must\r\n     act together; she, _his_ helper. She has no sphere peculiar to\r\n     herself, because she could not then be his helper. It is only\r\n     since I have met the varied responsibilities of life, that I have\r\n     comprehended woman's sphere; and I have come to regard it as\r\n     lying within the whole circumference of humanity. If, as is\r\n     claimed by the most ultra opponents of the wife's legal\r\n     individuality, the _interests of the parties are identical_, then\r\n     I claim as a legitimate conclusion that their spheres are also\r\n     identical. For interests determine duties, and duties are the\r\n     land-marks of spheres. The dependence of the sexes is mutual.\r\n\r\n     It is in behalf of our sons, the future men of the Republic, as\r\n     well as of our daughters, its future mothers, that we claim the\r\n     full development of our energies by education, and legal\r\n     protection in the control of all the issues and profits of our\r\n     lives called _property_. Woman must seek influence, independence,\r\n     representation, that she may have power to aid in the elevation\r\n     of the human race. When men kindly set aside woman from the\r\n     National Councils, they say the moral field belongs to her; and\r\n     the strongest reason why woman should seek a more elevated\r\n     position, is because her moral susceptibilities are greater than\r\n     those of man.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. MOTT thought differently from Mrs. Nichols; she did not\r\n     believe that woman's moral feelings were more elevated than\r\n     man's; but that with the same opportunities for development, with\r\n     the same restrictions and penalties, there would probably be\r\n     about an equal manifestation of virtue.\r\n\r\n     ELIZABETH OAKES SMITH: My friends, do we realize for what purpose\r\n     we are convened? Do we fully understand that we aim at nothing\r\n     less than an entire subversion of the present order of society,\r\n     a dissolution of the whole existing social compact? Do we see\r\n     that it is not an error of to-day, nor of yesterday, against\r\n     which we are lifting up the voice of dissent, but that it is\r\n     against the hoary-headed error of all times--error borne onward\r\n     from the foot-prints of the first pair ejected from Paradise,\r\n     down to our own time? In view of all this, it does seem to me\r\n     that we should each and all feel as if anointed, sanctified, set\r\n     apart as to a great mission. It seems to me that we who struggle\r\n     to restore the divine order to the world, should feel as if under\r\n     the very eye of the Eternal Searcher of all hearts, who will\r\n     reject any sacrifice other than a pure offering.\r\n\r\n     We are said to be a \"few disaffected, embittered women, met for\r\n     the purpose of giving vent to petty personal spleen and domestic\r\n     discontent.\" I repel the charge; and I call upon every woman here\r\n     to repel the charge. If we have personal wrongs, here is not the\r\n     place for redress. If we have private griefs (and what human\r\n     heart, in a large sense, is without them?), we do not come here\r\n     to recount them. The grave will lay its cold honors over the\r\n     hearts of all here present, before the good we ask for our kind\r\n     will be realized to the world. We shall pass onward to other\r\n     spheres of existence, but I trust the seed we shall here plant\r\n     will ripen to a glorious harvest. We \"see the end from the\r\n     beginning,\" and rejoice in spirit. We care not that we shall not\r\n     reach the fruits of our toil, for we know in times to come it\r\n     will be seen to be a glorious work.\r\n\r\n     Bitterness is the child of wrong; if any one of our number has\r\n     become embittered (which, God forbid!), it is because social\r\n     wrong has so penetrated to the inner life that we are crucified\r\n     thereby, and taste the gall and vinegar with the Divine Master.\r\n     All who take their stand against false institutions, are in some\r\n     sense embittered. The conviction of wrong has wrought mightily in\r\n     them. Their large hearts took in the whole sense of human woe,\r\n     and bled for those who had become brutalized by its weight, and\r\n     they spoke as never man spoke in his own individualism, but as\r\n     the embodied race will speak, when the full time shall come. Thus\r\n     Huss and Wickliffe and Luther spoke, and the men of '76.\r\n\r\n     No woman has come here to talk over private griefs, and detail\r\n     the small coin of personal anecdote; and yet did woman speak of\r\n     the wrongs, which unjust legislation; the wrongs which corrupt\r\n     public opinion; the wrongs which false social aspects have\r\n     fastened upon us; wrongs which she hides beneath smiles, and\r\n     conceals with womanly endurance; did she give voice to all this,\r\n     her smiles would seem hollow and her endurance pitiable.\r\n\r\n     I hope this Convention will be an acting Convention. Let us\r\n     pledge ourselves to the support of a paper in which our views\r\n     shall be fairly presented to the world. At our last Convention in\r\n     Worcester, I presented a prospectus for such a paper, which I\r\n     will request hereafter to be read here. We can do little or\r\n     nothing without such an organ. We have no opportunity now to\r\n     repel slander, and are restricted in disseminating truth, from\r\n     the want of such an organ. _The Tribune_, and some other papers\r\n     in the country, have treated us generously; but a paper to\r\n     represent us must be sustained by ourselves. We must look to our\r\n     own resources. We must work out our own salvation, and God grant\r\n     it be not in fear and trembling! Woman must henceforth be the\r\n     redeemer, the regenerator of the world. We plead not for\r\n     ourselves alone, but for Humanity. We must place woman on a\r\n     higher platform, and she will raise the race to her side. We\r\n     should have a literature of our own, a printing-press and a\r\n     publishing-house, and tract writers and distributors, as well as\r\n     lectures and conventions; and yet I say this to a race of\r\n     beggars, for women have no pecuniary resources.\r\n\r\n     Well, then, we must work, we must hold property, and claim the\r\n     consequent right to representation, or refuse to be taxed. Our\r\n     aim is nothing less than an overthrow of our present partial\r\n     legislation, that every American citizen, whether man or woman,\r\n     may have a voice in the laws by which we are governed. We do not\r\n     aim at idle distinction, but while we would pull down our present\r\n     worn-out and imperfect human institutions, we would help to\r\n     reconstruct them upon a new and broader foundation.\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE: It seems to me that the claims we make at these\r\n     Conventions are self-evident truths. The second resolution\r\n     affirms the right of human beings to their persons and earnings.\r\n     Is not that self-evident? Yet the common law which regulates the\r\n     relation of husband and wife, and which is modified only in a\r\n     very few instances where there are statutes to the contrary,\r\n     gives the \"custody\" of the wife's person to her husband, so that\r\n     he has a right to her even against herself. It gives him her\r\n     earnings, no matter with what weariness they have been acquired,\r\n     or how greatly she may need them for herself or her children. It\r\n     gives him a right to her personal property, which he may will\r\n     entirely from her, also the use of her real estate; and in some\r\n     of the States, married women, insane persons, and idiots are\r\n     ranked together as not fit to make a will. So that she is left\r\n     with only one right, which she enjoys in common with the pauper,\r\n     viz.: the right of maintenance. Indeed when she has taken the\r\n     sacred marriage vow, her legal existence ceases.\r\n\r\n     And what is our position politically? Why, the foreigner who\r\n     can't speak his mother tongue correctly; the negro, who to our\r\n     own shame, we regard as fit only for a boot-black (whose dead\r\n     even we bury by themselves), and the drunkard, all are entrusted\r\n     with the ballot, all placed by men politically higher than their\r\n     own mothers, sisters, wives, and daughters. The woman who, seeing\r\n     and feeling this, dare not maintain her rights, is the woman to\r\n     hang her head and blush. We ask only for justice and equal\r\n     rights--the right to vote, the right to our own earnings,\r\n     equality before the law--these are the Gibraltar of our cause.\r\n\r\n     Rev. ANTOINETTE L. BROWN: Man can not represent woman. They\r\n     differ in their nature and relations. The law is wholly\r\n     masculine; it is created and executed by man. The framers of all\r\n     legal compacts are restricted to the masculine stand-point of\r\n     observation, to the thought, feelings, and biases of man. The law\r\n     then could give us no representation as woman, and therefore no\r\n     impartial justice even if the present lawmakers were honestly\r\n     intent upon this; for we can be represented only by our peers. It\r\n     is expected then under the present administration, that woman\r\n     should be the legal subject of man, legally reduced to pecuniary\r\n     dependence upon him; that the mother should have lower legal\r\n     claims upon the children than the father, and that, in short,\r\n     woman should be in all respects the legal inferior of man, though\r\n     entitled to full equality.\r\n\r\n     Here is the fact and its cause. When woman is tried for crime,\r\n     her jury, her judges, her advocates, are all men; and yet there\r\n     may have been temptations and various palliating circumstances\r\n     connected with her peculiar nature as woman, such as man can not\r\n     appreciate. Common justice demands that a part of the law-makers\r\n     and law executors should be of her own sex. In questions of\r\n     marriage and divorce, affecting interests dearer than life, both\r\n     parties in the compact are entitled to an equal voice. Then the\r\n     influences which arise from the relations of the sexes, when left\r\n     to be exerted in our halls of justice, would at least cause\r\n     decency and propriety of conduct to be maintained there; but now\r\n     low-minded men are encouraged to jest openly in court over the\r\n     most sacred and most delicate subjects. From the nature of\r\n     things, the guilty woman can not now have justice done her before\r\n     the professed tribunals of justice; and the innocent but wronged\r\n     woman is constrained to suffer on in silence rather than ask for\r\n     redress.\r\n\r\n     CLARINA HOWARD NICHOLS said: There is one peculiarity in the laws\r\n     affecting woman's property rights, which as it has not to my\r\n     knowledge been presented for the consideration of the public,\r\n     except by myself to a limited extent in private conversation and\r\n     otherwise, I wish to speak of here. It is the unconstitutionality\r\n     of laws cutting off the wife's right of dower. It is a provision\r\n     of our National and State Constitutions, that property rights\r\n     shall not be confiscated for political or other offences against\r\n     the laws. Yet in all the States, if I am rightly informed, the\r\n     wife forfeits her right of dower in case of divorce for\r\n     infidelity to the marriage vow. In Massachusetts and several\r\n     other States, if the wife desert her husband for any cause, and\r\n     he procure a divorce on the ground of her desertion, she forfeits\r\n     her right of dower. But it is worthy of remark that in no case is\r\n     the right of the husband to possess and control the estate which\r\n     is their joint accumulation, set aside; no, not even when the\r\n     wife procures a divorce for the most aggravated abuse and\r\n     infidelity combined. She, the innocent party, goes out childless\r\n     and portionless, by decree of law; and he, the criminal, retains\r\n     the home and the children, by the favor of the same law. I claim,\r\n     friends, that the laws which cut off the wife's right of dower,\r\n     in any case do confiscate property rights, and hence are\r\n     _unconstitutional_. The property laws compel the wife to seek\r\n     divorce in order to protect her earnings for the support of her\r\n     children. A rum-drinker took his wife's clothing to pay his rum\r\n     bill, and the justice decided that the clothing could be held,\r\n     because the wife belonged to him.\r\n\r\n     Only under the Common Law of England has woman been deprived of\r\n     her natural rights. Instances are frequent where the husband's\r\n     aged parents are supported by the wife's earnings, and the wife's\r\n     parents left paupers.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Nichols here offered the following resolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That equally involved as they are in all the Natural\r\n     Relations which lie at the base of society, the sexes are\r\n     equally entitled to all the rights necessary to the discharge of\r\n     the duties of those relations.\r\n\r\n     ELIZABETH OAKES SMITH presented the following resolution offered\r\n     by Lucretia Mott:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That as the imbruted slave, who is content with his\r\n     own lot, and would not be free if he could, if any such there be,\r\n     only gives evidence of the depth of his degradation; so the woman\r\n     who is satisfied with her inferior condition, avering that she\r\n     has all the rights she wants, does but exhibit the enervating\r\n     effects of the wrongs to which she is subjected.\r\n\r\nSusan B. Anthony read the resolutions.[108] The audience called upon\r\nHon. Gerrit Smith for a speech. His rising was received with cheers.\r\nThis was Mr. Smith's first appearance upon our platform, although in\r\nletters to different Conventions he had already expressed his\r\nsympathy. His commanding presence, his benevolent countenance, and\r\ndeep rich voice, made a profound impression, and intensified the power\r\nof his glowing words. Being well known in Syracuse for his\r\nphilanthropy, his presence added dignity and influence to the\r\nassembly.[109]\r\n\r\n     Mr. SMITH said: The women who are engaged in this movement are\r\n     ridiculed for aspiring to be doctors, lawyers, clergymen, sea\r\n     captains, generals, presidents. For the sake of argument\r\n     admitting this to be true, what then? Shall we block the way to\r\n     any individual aspiration? But women are totally unfit for these\r\n     places. Let them try, and their failure will settle the matter to\r\n     their own satisfaction. There is not the slightest danger of a\r\n     human being holding any position that he is incapable of\r\n     attaining. We can not lay down a rule for all women. Because all\r\n     women are not born with a genius for navigation, shall we say\r\n     that one who is by skill and education able to take observations,\r\n     who understands the chart and compass, the dangerous shores,\r\n     currents, and latitudes, shall not, if she chooses, be a sea\r\n     captain? Suppose we apply that rule to man. Because I can not\r\n     stand on my head, shall we deny that right to all acrobats in our\r\n     circuses? Because I can not make a steam engine, shall all other\r\n     men be denied that right? Because all men can not stand on a\r\n     platform and make a speech, shall I be denied the exercise of\r\n     that right? Each individual has a sphere, and that sphere is the\r\n     largest place that he or she can fill.\r\n\r\n     These women complain that they have been robbed of great and\r\n     essential rights. They do not ask favors; they demand rights, the\r\n     right to do whatever they have the capacity to accomplish, the\r\n     right to dictate their own sphere of action, and to have a voice\r\n     in the laws and rulers under which they live. Suppose I should go\r\n     to vote, and some man should push me back and say, \"You want to\r\n     be Governor, don't you?\" \"No,\" I reply, \"I want to exercise my\r\n     God-given right to vote.\" Such a taunt as this would be no more\r\n     insulting than those now cast at women, when they demand rights\r\n     so unjustly denied.\r\n\r\n     I make no claim that woman is fit to be a member of Congress or\r\n     President; all I ask for her is what I ask for the negro, a fair\r\n     field. All will admit that woman has a right to herself, to her\r\n     own powers of locomotion, to her own earnings, but how few are\r\n     prepared to admit her right to the ballot. But all rights are\r\n     held by a precarious tenure, if this one be denied. When women\r\n     are the constituents of men who make and administer the laws,\r\n     they will pay due consideration to their interests and not\r\n     before. The right of suffrage is the great right that guarantees\r\n     all others.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith set forth the education, the dignity, the power of\r\nself-government, and took his seat amid great applause.\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE said: It is the duty of woman to resist taxation as\r\n     long as she is not represented. It may involve the loss of\r\n     friends as it surely will the loss of property. But let them all\r\n     go; friends, house, garden spot, and all. The principle at issue\r\n     requires the sacrifice. Resist, let the case be tried in the\r\n     courts; be your own lawyers; base your cause on the admitted\r\n     self-evident truth, that taxation and representation are\r\n     inseparable. One such resistance, by the agitation that will grow\r\n     out of it, will do more to set this question right than all the\r\n     conventions in the world. There are $15,000,000 of taxable\r\n     property owned by women of Boston who have no voice either in the\r\n     use or imposition of the tax.\r\n\r\n     J. B. BRIGHAM, a school teacher, said: That the natures of men\r\n     and women showed that their spheres were not the same, and woman\r\n     was only truly lovely and happy when in her own element. He\r\n     wished woman to recognize the feminine element in her being, for\r\n     if she understood this, it would guide her in everything. In the\r\n     domestic animals even this difference was manifest. Women should\r\n     be keepers at home, and mind domestic concerns. The true object\r\n     of this Convention is, I fear, not so much to acquire any real or\r\n     supposed rights, as to make the speakers and actors conspicuous.\r\n     I urge those engaged in this movement to claim nothing masculine\r\n     for woman.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. NICHOLS said: Mr. Brigham's allusion to the animal world is\r\n     not a happy one, as no animal has been discovered which\r\n     legislated away the rights of the female.\r\n\r\n     GERRIT SMITH said: He would hand his esteemed friend over to\r\n     Lucretia Mott, that he might be slain like Abimelech of old, by\r\n     the hand of a woman; as evidently from his estimate of the sex,\r\n     that would be the most humiliating death he could suffer. I trust\r\n     no gentleman on this platform will consent to play the part of\r\n     the armor-bearer in his behalf, and rescue him from his impending\r\n     fate.\r\n\r\n     LUCRETIA MOTT said: It was impossible for one man to have\r\n     arbitrary power over another without becoming despotic. She did\r\n     not expect man to see how woman is robbed. Slaveholders did not\r\n     see that they were oppressors, but slaves did. Gerrit Smith\r\n     alluded to one woman that he intends me to personify, whom our\r\n     friend would consider far out of her sphere. Yet if he believes\r\n     his Bible, he must acknowledge that Deborah, a mother in Israel,\r\n     arose by divine command, and led the armies of Israel,--the wife\r\n     of Heber the Kenite, who drove the nail into the head of the\r\n     Canaanite General, and her praises were chanted in the songs of\r\n     Israel. The preaching of women, too, is approved in the Bible.\r\n     Paul gives special directions to women how to preach, and he\r\n     exhorts them to qualify themselves for this function and not to\r\n     pin their faith on the sleeves of the clergy. I would advise Mr.\r\n     Bingham not to set up his wisdom against the plain decrees of the\r\n     Almighty. As to woman's voice being too weak to be heard as a\r\n     public speaker, did Mr. Brigham send a protest to England against\r\n     Victoria's proroguing Parliament?\r\n\r\n     Mr. MAY moved that Mrs. Stephen Smith be placed on a Committee in\r\n     his stead.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT quickly replied: Woman's Rights' women do not like\r\n     to be called by their husbands' names, but by their own.\r\n\r\n     Mr. MAY corrected himself and said--_Rosa Smith_.\r\n\r\nMatilda Joslyn Gage made her first public appearance in an address to\r\nthis Convention. She pressed the adoption of some settled plan for the\r\nfuture--brought up many notable examples of woman's intellectual\r\nability, and urged that girls be trained to self-reliance. Although\r\nMrs. Gage, whose residence was Onondaga County, had not before taken\r\npart in a Convention, yet from the moment she read of an organized\r\neffort for the rights of woman, she had united in it heart and soul,\r\nmerely waiting a convenient opportunity to publicly identify herself\r\nwith this reform; an opportunity given by the Syracuse Convention.\r\nPersonally acquainted with none of the leaders except Mr. May, it was\r\nquite a test of moral courage for Mrs. Gage, then quite a young woman,\r\nin fact the youngest person who took part in that Convention, to speak\r\nupon this occasion. She consulted no one as to time or opportunity,\r\nbut when her courage had reached a sufficiently high point, with\r\npalpitating heart she ascended the platform, where she was cordially\r\ngiven place by Mrs. Mott, whose kindness to her at this supreme moment\r\nof her life was never forgotten.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. GAGE said: This Convention has assembled to discuss the\r\n     subject of Woman's Rights, and form some settled plan of action\r\n     for the future. While so much is said of the inferior intellect\r\n     of woman, it is by a strange absurdity conceded that very many\r\n     eminent men owe their station in life to their mothers. Women are\r\n     now in the situation of the mass of mankind a few years since,\r\n     when science and learning were in the hands of the priests, and\r\n     property was held by vassalage. The Pope and the priests claimed\r\n     to be not only the teachers, but the guides of the people; the\r\n     laity were not permitted to examine for themselves; education was\r\n     held to be unfit for the masses, while the tenure of their landed\r\n     property was such as kept them in a continual state of dependence\r\n     on their feudal lords.\r\n\r\n     It was but a short time since the most common rudiments of\r\n     education were deemed sufficient for any woman; could she but\r\n     read tolerably and write her own name it was enough. Trammeled as\r\n     women have been by might and custom, there are still many shining\r\n     examples, which serve as beacon lights to show what may be\r\n     attained by genius, labor, energy, and perseverance combined.\r\n     \"The longer I live in the world,\" says Göethe, \"the more I am\r\n     certain that the difference between the great and the\r\n     insignificant, is energy, invincible determination, an honest\r\n     purpose once fixed, and then victory.\"\r\n\r\n     Although so much has been said of woman's unfitness for public\r\n     life, it can be seen, from Semiramis to Victoria, that she has a\r\n     peculiar fitness for governing. In poetry, Sappho was honored\r\n     with the title of the Tenth Muse. Helena Lucretia Corano, in the\r\n     seventeenth century, was of such rare scientific attainments,\r\n     that the most illustrious persons in passing through Venice, were\r\n     more anxious to see her than all the curiosities of the city; she\r\n     was made a doctor, receiving the title of Unalterable. Mary\r\n     Cunity, of Silesia, in the sixteenth century, was one of the most\r\n     able astronomers of her time, forming astronomical tables that\r\n     acquired for her a great reputation, Anna Maria Schureman was a\r\n     sculptor, engraver, musician, and painter; she especially\r\n     excelled in miniature painting. Constantina Grierson, an Irish\r\n     girl, of humble parentage, was celebrated for her literary\r\n     acquirements, though dying at the early age of twenty-seven.\r\n\r\n     With the learning, energy, and perseverance of Lady Jane Grey,\r\n     Mary and Elizabeth, all are familiar. Mrs. Cowper was spoken of\r\n     by Montague as standing at the head of all that is called\r\n     learned, and that every critic veiled his bonnet at her superior\r\n     judgment. Joanna Baillie has been termed the woman Shakespeare.\r\n     Caroline Herschell shares the fame of her brother as an\r\n     astronomer. The greatest triumphs of the present age in the\r\n     drama, music, and literature have been achieved by women, among\r\n     whom may be mentioned, Charlotte Cushman, Jenny Lind, the Misses\r\n     Carey, Mrs. Stowe, and Margaret Fuller. Mrs. Somerville's renown\r\n     has long been spread over both continents as one of the first\r\n     mathematicians of the present age.\r\n\r\n     Self-reliance is one of the first lessons to be taught our\r\n     daughters; they should be educated with our sons, and equally\r\n     with them, taught to look forward to some independent means of\r\n     support, either to one of the professions or the business best\r\n     fitted to exercise their talents. Being placed in a position\r\n     compelling them to act, has caused many persons to discover\r\n     talents in themselves they were before unaware of possessing.\r\n     Great emergencies produce great leaders, by arousing hitherto\r\n     dormant energies.\r\n\r\n     Let us look at the rights it is boasted women now possess. After\r\n     marriage the husband and wife are considered as one person in\r\n     law, which I hold to be false from the very laws applicable to\r\n     married parties. Were it so, the act of one would be as binding\r\n     as the act of the other, and wise legislators would not need to\r\n     enact statutes defining the peculiar rights of each; were it so,\r\n     a woman could not legally be a man's inferior. Such a thing would\r\n     be a veritable impossibility. One-half of a person can not be\r\n     made the protection or direction of the other half. Blackstone\r\n     says \"a woman may indeed be attorney for her husband, for that\r\n     implies no separation from, but rather a representation of, her\r\n     lord. And a husband may also bequeath anything to his wife by\r\n     will; for it can not take effect till the coverture is determined\r\n     by his death.\" After stating at considerable length, the reasons\r\n     showing their unity, the learned commentator proceeds to cut the\r\n     knot, and show they are not one, but are considered as two\r\n     persons, one superior, the one inferior, and not only so, but the\r\n     inferior in the eye of the law as acting from compulsion.\r\n\r\n     J. ELIZABETH JONES, of Ohio: This is a time of progress; and man\r\n     may sooner arrest the progress of the lightning, or the clouds,\r\n     or stay the waves of the sea, than the onward march of Truth with\r\n     her hand on her sword and her banner unfurled. I am not in the\r\n     habit of talking much about rights; I am one of those who take\r\n     them. I have occupied pulpits all over the country five days out\r\n     of seven, in lecturing on science, and have found no objection.\r\n\r\n     I do not know what all the women want, but I do know what I want\r\n     myself, and that is, what men are most unwilling to grant; the\r\n     right to vote. That includes all other rights. I want to go into\r\n     the Legislative Hall, sit on the Judicial Bench, and fill the\r\n     Executive Chair. Now do you understand me? This I claim on the\r\n     ground of humanity; and on the ground that taxation and\r\n     representation go together. The whole question resolves itself\r\n     into this; there has been no attempt to dispute this. No man will\r\n     venture to deny the right of woman to vote. He may urge many\r\n     objections against the expediency of her exercising it, but the\r\n     right is hers.\r\n\r\n     But though women are deprived of political rights, there are\r\n     other rights which no law prevents. We can take our rights as\r\n     merchants and in other avocations, by investing our capital in\r\n     them; but we stand back and wait till it is popular for us to\r\n     become merchants, doctors, lecturers, or practitioners of the\r\n     mechanic arts. I know girls who have mechanical genius sufficient\r\n     to become Arkwrights and Fultons, but their mothers would not\r\n     apprentice them. Which of the women of this Convention have sent\r\n     their daughters as apprentices to a watchmaker? There is no law\r\n     against this!!\r\n\r\n     Mrs. MOTT: The Church and public opinion are stronger than law.\r\n\r\n     LYDIA JENKINS: Is there any law to prevent women voting in this\r\n     State? The Constitution says \"white male citizens\" may vote, but\r\n     does not say that white female citizens may not.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. JONES said: I do not understand that point sufficiently well\r\n     to explain, but whether the statute book is in favor or opposed,\r\n     every citizen in a republic (and a woman is a citizen) has a\r\n     natural right to vote which no human laws can abrogate; the right\r\n     to vote is the right of self-government.\r\n\r\n     ANTOINETTE BROWN said: I know instances of colored persons voting\r\n     under the same circumstances, and their votes being allowed by\r\n     the legal authorities; but John A. Dix declared the proceedings\r\n     of a school meeting void because two women voted at it.\r\n\r\n     BENJAMIN S. JONES said, in Ohio where there is much splitting of\r\n     hairs between white and black blood, the judges decided in favor\r\n     of a certain colored man's right to vote, because there was 50\r\n     per cent. of white blood in the person in question.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. DAVIS: The first draft of the Rhode Island Constitution said\r\n     \"all citizens,\" but as soon as some one suggested that the door\r\n     was thus left open for women to vote, the word \"male\" was\r\n     promptly inserted.\r\n\r\nMrs. Davis read an interesting letter from the Rev. A. D. Mayo.[110]\r\nSamuel J. May read letters from William Lloyd Garrison, of Boston, and\r\nMargaret H. Andrews, of Newburyport, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n                              NEWBURYPORT, Mass., _September 4, 1852_.\r\n\r\n     REV. SAMUEL J. MAY.\r\n\r\n     DEAR FRIEND--I wish to express my deep sympathy with those brave\r\n     women who are struggling against ancient prejudices and modern\r\n     folly, and who will eventually elevate our sex to a position\r\n     which will command the respect of those who now regard them with\r\n     derision and contempt, and my gratitude to the noble-minded men\r\n     who are extending a helping hand to those who have hitherto been\r\n     considered the weak and dependent portion of society, and are\r\n     endeavoring to raise them to _their_ level, instead of trying to\r\n     establish their superiority over them. Such conduct shows true\r\n     greatness and dignity of character. I wish to bear my share of\r\n     the reproach and contumely which will be liberally bestowed upon\r\n     this movement by many who ought to know and to do better; this is\r\n     indeed the actuating motive which impels me to write.\r\n\r\n     With regard to the counsel which has been requested, I have\r\n     little to say. If there be any one subject which has not been\r\n     sufficiently insisted on, it is the aimless life which young\r\n     women generally lead after they have left school. A large portion\r\n     are occupied in forming matrimonial plans when they are wholly\r\n     unfit to enter into that sacred state. Dr. Johnson makes his\r\n     Nekayah say of young ladies with whom she associated, \"Some\r\n     imagined they were in love, when they were only idle.\" If young\r\n     ladies directed their attention to some definite employment, this\r\n     evil would be remedied.\r\n\r\n                                   I am, dear sir,\r\n                                        Very truly yours,\r\n                                             MARGARET H. ANDREWS.\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE said: Mrs. Jones' idea of taking our rights is\r\n     inspiring, but it can not be done. In Massachusetts some women\r\n     apprenticed themselves as printers, but were expelled because men\r\n     would not set type beside them. Dr. Harriot K. Hunt asked\r\n     permission to attend medical lectures at Harvard, but the\r\n     students declared that if she were admitted they would leave, and\r\n     so she was sacrificed.\r\n\r\n     HARRIET K. HUNT: No; I am here.\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE: Mrs. Mott says she was only suspended. So, too, when\r\n     the Grimké sisters and Abby Kelley began publicly to plead the\r\n     cause of the slave, they were assailed both by pulpit and press,\r\n     and every species of abuse was heaped upon them; but they\r\n     persevered and proved their capacity to do it, and now we meet in\r\n     quietness, and our right to speak in public is not questioned.\r\n     The woman who first departs from the routine in which society\r\n     allows her to move must suffer. Let us bravely bear ridicule and\r\n     persecution for the sake of the good that will result, and when\r\n     the world sees that we can accomplish what we undertake, it will\r\n     acknowledge our right. We must be true to each other. We must\r\n     stand by the woman whose work of hand or brain removes her from\r\n     the customary sphere. Employ the woman physician, dentist, and\r\n     artist rather than a man of the same calling, and in time all\r\n     professions and trades will be as free to us as to our brothers.\r\n\r\n     ABBY PRICE, of Hopedale, said: I shall briefly consider woman's\r\n     religious position, her relation to the Church, and show that by\r\n     its restrictions she has suffered great injustice; that alike\r\n     under all forms of religion she has been degraded and oppressed,\r\n     the Church has proscribed her, and denied the exercise of her\r\n     inalienable rights, and in this the Church is false to the\r\n     plainest principles of Christianity. \"There is neither Jew nor\r\n     Greek; there is neither bond nor free; there is neither male nor\r\n     female; for ye all are one in Christ Jesus.\" Gal., chap, iii., v.\r\n     28. \"So God created man in His _own_ image; in the image of God\r\n     created He him; male and _female_ created He _them_, and said\r\n     unto _them_: have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the\r\n     fowl of the air; over every living thing that moveth upon the\r\n     earth.\" Genesis i., v. 27, 28. Notwithstanding these explicit\r\n     declarations of equality, even in the Godhead, the Church\r\n     claiming to be \"Christian\" denies woman's right of free speech.\r\n     The priesthood, from Paul down, say gravely: \"It is not permitted\r\n     for woman to speak in the churches.\" Some denominations have\r\n     gravely debated whether she should be allowed in the service, or\r\n     chants, to respond Amen!\r\n\r\n     The whole arrangement of Nature in her beautiful and wise\r\n     manifestations to us evinces that the Divine order is for the\r\n     sexes to mingle their different and peculiar characteristics in\r\n     every relation of life. In Jesus the masculine and feminine\r\n     elements of humanity were blended harmoniously. These different\r\n     characteristics in His own person were distinctly and plainly\r\n     seen. The masculine, when He fixed His eye in stern rebuke, and\r\n     made the hypocrite and the Pharisee tremble; and the feminine\r\n     gleamed often through His tears of affection and pity, and shone\r\n     ever a glorious halo of patience and love around Him in the midst\r\n     of suffering the most wasting and intense. The Church, as His\r\n     Representative, should also exhibit these peculiarities in as\r\n     full and glorious harmony.\r\n\r\n     Yet very few of the sects allow woman to assume the\r\n     responsibility as religious teacher. However great she may feel\r\n     the duty to be upon her, and however well qualified she may be,\r\n     all ecclesiastical authorities, with one accord, begin to make\r\n     excuses whenever a woman presents herself to be properly\r\n     authorized, according to the popular usage of that Church, to\r\n     preach the Gospel to a people, one-half of whom are her own sex.\r\n\r\n     Again, _woman is denied_ a representation in all _Ecclesiastical\r\n     Assemblies_.\r\n\r\n     The male portion of the Church assemble in delegation from the\r\n     different bodies with which they are connected to legislate in\r\n     behalf of the churches, but woman has no representation in these\r\n     councils. Her opinion of what is best to promote the interests of\r\n     religion is not respected; her right to representation being\r\n     denied, her claim to just recognition is solemnly mocked. The\r\n     Church places its hands on woman's lips, and says to her, \"You\r\n     shall not _speak_; you shall not be represented; you are not\r\n     eligible to office because _you are a woman_!\" Is not this\r\n     crucifying with a strange presumption the soul of\r\n     Christ?--treating with contempt the purity of the Christian\r\n     character?--trampling upon _Human Rights?_ And yet woman\r\n     patiently bears this contumely and scorn. The poor young men that\r\n     she often educates by toil early and late, labor, arduous and\r\n     half paid, teach her, when properly prepared, that this absurd\r\n     tyranny is supported by the word of God!\r\n\r\n     Woman may speak when the thoughtless crowd the halls of fashion,\r\n     with no aim but amusement, in the theatre, opera, or concert\r\n     hall; she may meet with ministers in revivals, camp meetings, and\r\n     sociables, and reply with smile and bow to the hollow compliments\r\n     addressed to her vanity, but she must keep silence in the\r\n     churches and all religious meetings; if there are only six\r\n     persons present woman may not ask God's blessing to rest there,\r\n     nor presume, should one man be present, to give utterance to her\r\n     religious aspiration.\r\n\r\n     Every class of society, and especially each sex, need religious\r\n     teachers of their own class and sex with themselves, having the\r\n     same experience, the same hopes, aims, and relations. Human minds\r\n     are so constituted as to need not merely intellectual\r\n     instruction, but the strength imparted by an earnest sympathy\r\n     born of a like experience. In order rightly to appreciate the\r\n     wants of others, we must know and realize the trials of their\r\n     situation, the struggles they may encounter, the burthens, the\r\n     toils, the temptations that beset their different relations.\r\n     These should be apprehended to some extent, and the more the\r\n     better by the person qualified to speak to the spiritual wants of\r\n     all. Each relation, therefore, needs its teacher--its peculiar\r\n     ministry. No one can demonstrate by college lore the weight of a\r\n     mother's responsibility.\r\n\r\n     No man--not even the kindest father--can fully apprehend the\r\n     wearisome cares and anxious solicitude for children of her who\r\n     bore them. The tremblings of a mother's soul none save a mother\r\n     can feel. Man may prepare sound and logical discourses; he may\r\n     clearly define a mother's duty; he may talk eloquently about her\r\n     responsibility; he may urge upon her strong motives to\r\n     faithfulness in the discharge of her maternal duties; he may tell\r\n     her what her children should be in all life's varied aspects. She\r\n     hears the good instruction and advice with more or less of the\r\n     feeling, \"_You_ cannot _know_ of what you are talking.\"....\r\n\r\n     The Church needs a varied ministry. Not alone is the power of\r\n     mind needed, but the zeal and the inspiration of the inner life;\r\n     the unction of love and faith and courage produced by a struggle\r\n     amid life's realities. Not the dreamer, but the toiler can best\r\n     affect the lives of others through their hearts. In this ministry\r\n     the sexes must blend harmoniously their ministrations to others\r\n     from their own lives and experiences. This must be the Divine\r\n     order. Reason teaches it to the calm observer. Our souls respond\r\n     to this truth from their deepest chambers.\r\n\r\n     ... Doom woman no longer to banishment from the hallowed ground\r\n     of Church and State. She has too long been but as the Pariah of\r\n     the desert. Welcome her ministrations reverently to her human\r\n     nature, kindly to her present weakness, encouragingly to her\r\n     hopes; receive her counsels with respect and confidence, so far\r\n     as they are worthy, and be assured that a better day will begin\r\n     to dawn. The birth of a new spiritual life will be given in this\r\n     new marriage, and melody as from the harps of angels will be\r\n     breathed from the circles of earth.\r\n\r\n     PAULINA WRIGHT DAVIS: ... We commence life where our fathers left\r\n     it. We have their mistakes and their achievements. We attempt to\r\n     walk in the paths they trod, and wear the garments left by them;\r\n     but they are all too short and narrow for us; they deform and\r\n     cramp our energies; for they demand the Procrustean process to\r\n     conform the enlarged natures of the present to the past. While\r\n     the human soul, like the infinite in wisdom and love, is ever\r\n     governed by the eternal law of progress, creeds and codes are\r\n     always changing. All things founded in immutable truth grow only\r\n     the stronger by every trial.\r\n\r\n     ... The sacred traditions of both Jew and Gentile agree in\r\n     ascribing to woman a primary agency in the introduction of human\r\n     evils. In the Greek Mythology, she is indeed not the first\r\n     offender; but she is the bearer of the box that contained all the\r\n     crimes and diseases which have punished our world for the abuse\r\n     of liberty. It is worthy of remark that Pandora, who is the Eve\r\n     of the Grecian system, being like her Hebrew correspondent,\r\n     created for special purposes, was the joint work of all the gods.\r\n     Venus gave her beauty, Minerva wisdom, Apollo the art of music,\r\n     Mercury eloquence, and the rest the perfection and completeness\r\n     of all her divine accomplishments. Her name signifies gifts from\r\n     all.\r\n\r\n          \"A combination and a form Indeed\r\n          Where every god did seem to set his seal,\r\n          To give the world assurance of a paragon.\"\r\n\r\n     Prometheus made the first man of clay and animated him with fire\r\n     stolen from Heaven. Jupiter is represented as attaching the\r\n     terrible consequences of a rational and responsible vitality,\r\n     thus conferred upon a creation of earth, by sending this\r\n     wonderfully gifted Pandora into the world loaded with all the\r\n     evils which it was fated to endure. It was her destiny to be the\r\n     occasion of the fall, the instrument of doom; but her fortunes\r\n     are linked to the resurrection and life, as well as the suffering\r\n     and death of the race. Among the gifts of Pandora which had\r\n     otherwise been fatal, she brought hope which lay concealed after\r\n     all the others had flown abroad on their missions of mischief. In\r\n     our Sacred Story this point in the parable has a clear\r\n     explanation: \"The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's\r\n     head.\" If she brought death into the world, she brought forth a\r\n     Son who \"taketh away the sins of the world.\".... These myths,\r\n     whether received as simple facts, or poetic fiction, whose\r\n     oracles always reveal the deepest signification of facts, alike\r\n     indicate the eminent agency of woman in the fall and rising again\r\n     of the human image of the divine upon earth.\r\n\r\n     ... From the marriage hour woman is presented only in a series of\r\n     dissolving views. First. She stands beside her husband radiant in\r\n     girlish beauty. She worships. One side of the lesson is well\r\n     learned, that of entire dependence. Not once has she dreamed that\r\n     there must be mutual dependence and separate fountains of\r\n     reciprocal life.... In the next scene the child wife appears\r\n     withering away from life as from the heart she is not large or\r\n     noble enough to fill--pining in the darkness of her home-life,\r\n     made only the deeper by her inactivity, ignorance, and\r\n     despair.... In another view she has passed the season of despair,\r\n     and appears as the heartless votary of fashion, a flirt, or that\r\n     most to be dreaded, most to be despised being, a married\r\n     coquette; at once seductive, heartless, and basely unprincipled;\r\n     or as beauty of person has faded away, she may be found turning\r\n     from these lighter styles of toys to a quiet kind of hand-maiden\r\n     piety and philanthropy.\r\n\r\n     ... Marriage as it now exists is only a name, a form without a\r\n     soul, a bondage, legal and therefore honorable. Only equals can\r\n     make this relation. True marriage is a union of soul with soul, a\r\n     blending of two in one, without mastership or helpless\r\n     dependence. The true family is the central and supreme\r\n     institution among human societies. All other organizations,\r\n     whether of Church or State, depend upon it for their character\r\n     and action. Its evils are the source of all evils; its good the\r\n     fountain of all good. The correction of its abuses is the\r\n     starting-point of all the reforms which the world needs.\r\n\r\nDr. Harriot K. Hunt attracted much attention from the fact of her\r\nyearly protest against taxation. In the course of her remarks she\r\nsaid, \"Unseen spirits have been with us in this Convention; the\r\nspirits of our Shaker sisters whom untold sorrows have driven into\r\nthose communal societies, the convents of our civilization.\"\r\n\r\nAfter quite a brilliant discussion, in which Mr. Brigham made himself\r\na target for Lucy Stone, Martha C. Wright, Eliza Aldrich, Clarina\r\nHoward Nichols, Harriot K. Hunt, and Mrs. Palmer to shoot at,\r\nAntoinette L. Brown offered the following resolution, and made a few\r\ngood points on the Bible argument:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the Bible recognizes the rights, duties, and\r\n     privileges of woman as a public teacher, as every way equal with\r\n     those of man; that it enjoins upon her no subjection that is not\r\n     enjoined upon him; and that it truly and practically recognizes\r\n     neither male nor female in Christ Jesus.\r\n\r\n     God created the first human pair equal in rights, possessions,\r\n     and authority. He bequeathed the earth to them as a joint\r\n     inheritance; gave them joint dominion over the irrational\r\n     creation; but none over each other. (Gen. i. 28). They sinned.\r\n     God announced to them the results of sin. One of these results\r\n     was the rule which man would exercise over woman. (Gen. iii. 16).\r\n     This rule was no more approved, endorsed, or sanctioned by God,\r\n     than was the twin-born prophecy, \"thou (Satan) shalt bruise his\r\n     (Christ's) heel.\" God could not, from His nature, command Satan\r\n     to injure Christ, or any other of the seed of woman. What\r\n     particle of evidence is there then for supposing that in the\r\n     parallel announcement He commanded man to rule over woman? Both\r\n     passages should have been translated will, instead of shall.\r\n     Either auxiliary is used indifferently according to the sense, in\r\n     rendering that form of the Hebrew verb into English.\r\n\r\n     Because thou hast done this, is God's preface to the\r\n     announcement. The results are the effects of sin. Can woman then\r\n     receive evil from this rule, and man receive good? Man should be\r\n     blessed in exercising this power, if he is divinely appointed to\r\n     do so; but the two who are one flesh have an identity of\r\n     interests, therefore if it is a curse or evil to woman, it must\r\n     be so to man also. We mock God, when we make Him approve of man's\r\n     thus cursing himself and woman.\r\n\r\n     The submission enjoined upon the wife in the New Testament, is\r\n     not the unrighteous rule predicted in the Old. It is a Christian\r\n     submission due from man towards man, and from man towards woman:\r\n     \"Yea, all of you be subject one to another\" (1 Pet. v. 5; Eph. v.\r\n     21; Rom. xii. 10, etc.) In I Cor. xvi. 16, the disciples are\r\n     besought to submit themselves \"to every one that helpeth with us\r\n     and laboreth.\" The same apostle says, \"help those women which\r\n     labored with me in the Gospel, with Clement also, and with other\r\n     of my fellow-laborers.\"\r\n\r\n     Man is the head of the woman. True, but only in the sense in\r\n     which Christ is represented as head of His body, the Church. In a\r\n     different sense He is head of all things--of wicked men and\r\n     devils. If man is woman's head in this sense, he may exercise\r\n     over her all the prerogatives of God Himself. This would be\r\n     blasphemous. The mystical Head and Body, or Christ and His\r\n     Church, symbolize oneness, union. Christ so loved the Church He\r\n     gave Himself for it, made it His own body, part and parcel of\r\n     Himself. So ought men to love their wives. Then the rule which\r\n     grew out of sin, will cease with the sin.\r\n\r\n     It is said woman is commanded not to teach in the Church. There\r\n     is no such command in the Bible. It is said (1 Cor. xiv. 34),\r\n     \"Let your women keep silence in the churches; for it is not\r\n     permitted unto them to speak.\" This injunction, taken out of its\r\n     connection, forbids singing also; interpreted by its context,\r\n     woman is merely told not to talk unless she does teach. On the\r\n     same principle, one who has the gift of tongues is told not to\r\n     use it in the Church, unless there is an interpreter. The rule\r\n     enforced from the beginning to the end of the chapter is, \"Let\r\n     all things be done unto edifying.\" Their women, who had not been\r\n     previously instructed like the men, were very naturally guilty of\r\n     asking questions which did not edify the assembly. It was better\r\n     that they should wait till they got home for the desired\r\n     information, rather than put an individual good before the good\r\n     of the Church. Nothing else is forbidden. There is not a word\r\n     here against woman's teaching. The apostle says to the whole\r\n     Church, woman included, \"Ye may all prophesy, one by one.\"\r\n\r\n     In 1 Tim. ii. 12, the writer forbids woman's teaching over man,\r\n     or usurping authority over him; that is, he prohibits\r\n     dogmatizing, tutoring, teaching in a dictatorial spirit. This is\r\n     prohibited both in public and private; but a proper kind of\r\n     teaching is not prohibited. Verse 14--a reference to Eve, who,\r\n     though created last, sinned first, is merely such a suggestion as\r\n     we would make to a daughter whose mother had been in fault. The\r\n     daughters are not blamed for the mother's sin, merely warned by\r\n     it; and cautioned against self-confidence, which could make them\r\n     presume to teach over man. The Bible tells us of many\r\n     prophetesses approved of God. The Bible is truly democratic. Do\r\n     as you would be done by, is its golden commandment, recognizing\r\n     neither male nor female in Christ Jesus.\r\n\r\n     ERNESTINE L. ROSE: If the able theologian who has just spoken had\r\n     been in Indiana when the Constitution was revised, she might have\r\n     had a chance to give her definitions on the Bible argument to\r\n     some effect. At that Convention Robert Dale Owen introduced a\r\n     clause to give a married woman the right to her property. The\r\n     clause had passed, but by the influence of a minister was\r\n     recalled; and by his appealing to the superstition of the\r\n     members, and bringing the whole force of Bible argument to bear\r\n     against the right of woman to her property, it was lost. Had Miss\r\n     Brown been there, she might have beaten him with his own weapons.\r\n     For my part, I see no need to appeal to any written authority,\r\n     particularly when it is so obscure and indefinite as to admit of\r\n     different interpretations. When the inhabitants of Boston\r\n     converted their harbor into a teapot rather than submit to unjust\r\n     taxes, they did not go to the Bible for their authority; for if\r\n     they had, they would have been told from the same authority to\r\n     \"give unto Cæsar what belonged to Cæsar.\" Had the people, when\r\n     they rose in the might of their right to throw off the British\r\n     yoke, appealed to the Bible for authority, it would have\r\n     answered them, \"Submit to the powers that be, for they are from\r\n     God.\" No! on Human Rights and Freedom, on a subject that is as\r\n     self-evident as that two and two make four, there is no need of\r\n     any written authority. But this is not what I intended to speak\r\n     upon. I wish to introduce a resolution, and leave it to the\r\n     action of the Convention:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we ask not for our rights as a gift of charity,\r\n     but as an act of justice. For it is in accordance with the\r\n     principles of republicanism that, as woman has to pay taxes to\r\n     maintain government, she has a right to participate in the\r\n     formation and administration of it. That as she is amenable to\r\n     the laws of her country, she is entitled to a voice in their\r\n     enactment, and to all the protective advantages they can bestow;\r\n     and as she is as liable as man to all the vicissitudes of life,\r\n     she ought to enjoy the same social rights and privileges. And any\r\n     difference, therefore, in political, civil, and social rights, on\r\n     account of sex, is in direct violation of the principles of\r\n     justice and humanity, and as such ought to be held up to the\r\n     contempt and derision of every lover of human freedom.\r\n\r\n     ... But we call upon the law-makers and law-breakers of the\r\n     nation, to defend themselves for violating the fundamental\r\n     principles of the Republic, or disprove their validity. Yes! they\r\n     stand arrayed before the bar, not only of injured womanhood, but\r\n     before the bar of moral consistency; for this question is\r\n     awakening an interest abroad, as well as at home. Whatever human\r\n     rights are claimed for man, moral consistency points to the equal\r\n     rights of woman; but statesmen dare not openly face the subject;\r\n     knowing well they can not confute it, and they have not moral\r\n     courage enough to admit it; and hence, all they can do is to\r\n     shelter themselves under a subterfuge which, though solidified by\r\n     age, ignorance, and prejudice, is transparent enough for the most\r\n     benighted vision to penetrate. A strong evidence of this, is\r\n     given in a reply of Mr. Roebuck, member of Parliament, at a\r\n     meeting of electors in Sheffield, England. Mr. R., who advocated\r\n     the extension of the franchise to the occupants of five-pound\r\n     tenements, was asked whether he would favor the extension of the\r\n     same to women who pay an equal amount of rent? That was a simple,\r\n     straight-forward question of justice; one worthy to be asked even\r\n     in our republican legislative halls. But what was the honorable\r\n     gentleman's reply? Did he meet it openly and fairly? Oh, no! but\r\n     hear him, and I hope the ladies will pay particular attention,\r\n     for the greater part of the reply contains the draught poor,\r\n     deluded woman has been accustomed to swallow--Flattery:\r\n\r\n     \"There is no man who owes more than I do to woman. My education\r\n     was formed by one whose very recollections at this moment make me\r\n     tremble. There is nothing which, for the honor of the sex, I\r\n     would not do; the happiness of my life is bound up with it;\r\n     mother, wife, daughter, woman, to me have been the oasis of the\r\n     desert of life, and, I have to ask myself, would it conduce to\r\n     the happiness of society to bring woman more distinctly than she\r\n     now is brought, into the arena of politics? Honestly I confess to\r\n     you I believe not. I will tell you why. All their influences, if\r\n     I may so term it, are gentle influences. In the rude battle and\r\n     business of life, we come home to find a nook and shelter of\r\n     quiet comfort after the hard and severe, and, I may say, the\r\n     sharp ire and the disputes of the House of Commons. I hie me\r\n     home, knowing that I shall there find personal solicitude and\r\n     anxiety. My head rests upon a bosom throbbing with emotion for\r\n     me and our child; and I feel a more hearty man in the cause of my\r\n     country, the next day, because of the perfect, soothing, gentle\r\n     peace which a mind sullied by politics is unable to feel. Oh! I\r\n     can not rob myself of that inexpressible benefit, and therefore I\r\n     say, No.\"\r\n\r\n     Well, this is certainly a nice little romantic bit of\r\n     parliamentary declamation. What a pity that he should give up all\r\n     these enjoyments to give woman a vote! Poor man! his happiness\r\n     must be balanced on the very verge of a precipice, when the\r\n     simple act of depositing a vote by the hand of woman, would\r\n     overthrow and destroy it forever. I don't doubt the honorable\r\n     gentleman meant what he said, particularly the last part of it,\r\n     for such are the views of the unthinking, unreflecting mass of\r\n     the public, here as well as there. But like a true politician, he\r\n     commenced very patriotically, for the happiness of society, and\r\n     finished by describing his own individual interests. His reply is\r\n     a curious mixture of truth, political sophistry, false\r\n     assumption, and blind selfishness. But he was placed in a\r\n     dilemma, and got himself out as he could. In advocating the\r\n     franchise to five-pound tenement-holders, it did not occur to him\r\n     that woman may possess the same qualification that man has, and\r\n     in justice, therefore, ought to have the same rights; and when\r\n     the simple question was put to him (simple questions are very\r\n     troublesome to statesmen), having too much sense not to see the\r\n     justness of it, and too little moral courage to admit it, he\r\n     entered into quite an interesting account of what a delightful\r\n     little creature woman is, provided only she is kept quietly at\r\n     home, waiting for the arrival of her lord and master, ready to\r\n     administer a dose of purification, \"which his politically sullied\r\n     mind is unable to feel.\" Well! I have no desire to dispute the\r\n     necessity of it, nor that he owes to woman all that makes life\r\n     desirable--comforts, happiness, aye, and common sense too, for\r\n     it's a well-known fact that smart mothers always have smart sons,\r\n     unless they take after their father. But what of that? Are the\r\n     benefits woman is capable of bestowing on man, reasons why she\r\n     must pay the same amount of rent and taxes, without enjoying the\r\n     same rights that man does?\r\n\r\n     But the justice of the case was not considered. The honorable\r\n     gentleman was only concerned about the \"happiness of society.\"\r\n     Society! what does the term mean? As a foreigner, I understand by\r\n     it a collection or union of human beings--men, women, and\r\n     children, under one general government, and for mutual interest.\r\n     But Mr. Roebuck, being a native Briton and a member of\r\n     Parliament, gave us a parliamentary definition, namely; society\r\n     means the male sex only; for in his solicitude to consult \"the\r\n     happiness of society,\" he enumerated the benefits man enjoys from\r\n     keeping woman from her rights, without even dreaming that woman\r\n     was at all considered in it; and this is the true parliamentary\r\n     definition, for statesmen never include woman in their solicitude\r\n     for the happiness of society. Oh, no! she is not yet recognized\r\n     as belonging to the honorable body, unless taxes are required for\r\n     its benefit, or the penalties of the law have to be enforced for\r\n     its security.\r\n\r\n     Thus, being either unwilling or afraid to do woman justice, he\r\n     first flattered her, then, in his ignorance of her true nature,\r\n     he assumed that if she has her rights equal with man, she would\r\n     cease to be woman--forsake the partner of her existence, the\r\n     child of her bosom, dry up her sympathies, stifle her affections,\r\n     turn recreant to her own nature. Then his blind selfishness took\r\n     the alarm, lest, if woman were more independent, she might not be\r\n     willing to be the obedient, servile tool, implicitly to obey and\r\n     minister to the passions and follies of man; \"and as he could not\r\n     rob himself of these inexpressible benefits, therefore he said,\r\n     No.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech of Antoinette Brown, and the resolution she presented\r\nopened the question of authority as against individual judgment, and\r\nroused a prolonged and somewhat bitter discussion, to which Mrs.\r\nStanton's letter,[111] read in a most emphatic manner by Susan B.\r\nAnthony, added intensity. It continued at intervals for two days,\r\ncalling out great diversity of sentiment. Rev. Junius Hatch, a\r\nCongregational minister from Massachusetts, questioned the officers of\r\nthe Convention as to their belief in the paramount authority of the\r\nBible, saying the impression had gone abroad that the Convention was\r\ninfidel in character. The President ruled that question not before the\r\nConvention.\r\n\r\nThomas McClintock[112] said, to go back to a particular era for a\r\nstandard of religion and morality, is to adopt an imperfect standard\r\nand impede the progress of truth. The best minds of to-day surely\r\nunderstand the vital issues of this hour better than those possibly\r\ncould who have slumbered in their graves for centuries. Mrs. Nichols,\r\nwhom the city press spoke of as wielding a trenchant blade, announced\r\nherself as having been a member of a Baptist church since the age of\r\neight years, thus sufficiently proving her orthodoxy. Mrs. Rose,\r\nexpressing the conviction that belief does not depend upon voluntary\r\ninclination, deemed it right to interpret the Bible as he or she\r\nthought best, but objected to any such interpretation going forth as\r\nthe doctrine of the Convention, as, at best, it was but mere opinion\r\nand not authority.\r\n\r\nThe debate upon Miss Brown's resolution was renewed in the afternoon,\r\nduring which the Rev. Junius Hatch made so coarse a speech that the\r\nPresident was obliged to call him to order.[113] Paying no heed to\r\nthis reprimand he continued in a strain so derogatory to his own\r\ndignity and so insulting to the Convention, that the audience called\r\nout, \"Sit down! Sit down! Shut up!\" forcing the Reverend gentleman to\r\nhis seat. The discussion still continued between the members of the\r\nConvention; Miss Brown sustaining her resolution, Mrs. Rose opposing\r\nit.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. MOTT, vacating the chair, spoke in opposition to the\r\n     resolution, and related her anti-slavery experience upon the\r\n     Bible question; one party taking great pains to show that the\r\n     Bible was opposed to slavery, while the other side quoted texts\r\n     to prove it of divine origin, thus wasting their time by bandying\r\n     Scripture texts, and interfering with the business of their\r\n     meetings. The advocates of emancipation soon learned to adhere to\r\n     their own great work--that of declaring the inherent right of man\r\n     to himself and his earnings--and that self-evident truths needed\r\n     no argument or outward authority. We already see the disadvantage\r\n     of such discussions here. It is not to be supposed that all the\r\n     advice given by the apostles to the women of their day is\r\n     applicable to our more intelligent age; nor is there any passage\r\n     of Scripture making those texts binding upon us.\r\n\r\n     A GENTLEMAN said: \"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God,\r\n     and profitable, etc.\" Does not this apply to the latest period?\r\n\r\n     LUCRETIA MOTT: If the speaker will turn to the passage he will\r\n     find that the word \"_is_,\" being in italics, was inserted by the\r\n     translators. She accepted it as in the original, \"All Scriptures\r\n     _given_ by inspiration of God, is profitable, etc.\" She was\r\n     somewhat familiar with the Scriptures, and at a suitable time\r\n     would have no objection to discuss the question. She concluded by\r\n     moving that the resolution be laid on the table, which was\r\n     unanimously carried.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the last day the President stated that the subject\r\nof organizing a National Society was to be discussed, and at her\r\nsuggestion Mr. May read a long and interesting letter from Angelina\r\nGrimké Weld, from which we give the salient points:\r\n\r\n     \"Organization is two-fold--natural and artificial, divine and\r\n     human. Natural organizations are based on the principle of\r\n     progression; the eternal law of change. But human or artificial\r\n     organizations are built upon the principle of crystallization;\r\n     they _fix_ the conditions of society; they seek to daguerreotype\r\n     themselves, not on the present age only, but on future\r\n     generations; hence, they fetter and distort the expanding mind.\r\n     Organizations do not protect the sacredness of the individual;\r\n     their tendency is to sink the individual in the mass, to\r\n     sacrifice his rights, and immolate him on the altar of some\r\n     fancied good.\r\n\r\n     It is not to organization that I object, but to an _artificial\r\n     society_ that must prove a burden, a clog, an incumbrance, rather\r\n     than a help. Such an organization as now actually exists among\r\n     the women of America I hail with heartfelt joy. We are bound\r\n     together by the natural ties of spiritual affinity; we are drawn\r\n     to each other because we are attracted toward one common\r\n     center--the good of humanity. We need no external bonds to bind\r\n     us together, no cumbrous machinery to keep our minds and hearts\r\n     in unity of purpose and effort we are not the lifeless staves of\r\n     a barrel which can be held together only by the iron hoops of an\r\n     artificial organization.\r\n\r\n     The present aspect of organizations, whether in Church, or State,\r\n     or society at large, foretokens dissolution. The wrinkles and\r\n     totterings of age are on them. The power of organization has been\r\n     deemed necessary only because the power of Truth has not been\r\n     appreciated, and just in proportion as we reverence the\r\n     individual, and trust the unaided potency of Truth, we shall find\r\n     it useless. What organization in the world's history has not\r\n     encumbered the unfettered action of those who created it? Indeed,\r\n     has not been used as an engine of oppression.\r\n\r\n     The importance of this question can hardly be duly magnified. How\r\n     few organizations have ever had the power which this is destined\r\n     to wield! The prayers and sympathies of the ripest and richest\r\n     minds will be ours. Vast is the influence which true-hearted\r\n     women will exert in the coming age. It is a beautiful\r\n     coincidence, that just as the old epochs of despotism and\r\n     slavery, Priestcraft and Political intrigue are dying out, just\r\n     as the spiritual part of man is rising into the ascendency,\r\n     Woman's Rights are being canvassed and conceded, so that when she\r\n     becomes his partner in office, higher and holier principles of\r\n     action will form the basis of Governmental administration.\r\n\r\n                                             ANGELINA GRIMKÉ WELD.\r\n\r\nThe reading of Mrs. Weld's letter was followed by a spirited\r\ndiscussion, resulting in the continuance of the Central Committee,\r\ncomposed of representative men and women of the several States, which\r\nwas the only form of National Organization until after the war.\r\n\r\n     MARY SPRINGSTEAD moved that the Convention proceed to organize a\r\n     National Woman's Rights Society.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. SMITH and Mrs. DAVIS did not like to be bound by a\r\n     Constitution longer than during the sessions of the Convention.\r\n     Both recommended the formation of State Societies.\r\n\r\n     Dr. HARRIOT K. HUNT spoke as a physician in deeming spontaneity\r\n     as a law of nature.\r\n\r\n     ERNESTINE L. ROSE declared organizations to be like Chinese\r\n     bandages. In political, moral, and religious bodies they hindered\r\n     the growth of men; they were incubi; she herself had cut loose\r\n     from an organization into which she had been born[114]; she knew\r\n     what it had cost her, and having bought that little freedom for\r\n     what was dearer to her than life itself, she prized it too highly\r\n     to ever put herself in the same shackles again.\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE said, that like a burnt child that dreads the fire,\r\n     they had all been in permanent organizations, and therefore dread\r\n     them. She herself had had enough of thumb-screws and soul screws\r\n     ever to wish to be placed under them again. The present duty is\r\n     agitation.\r\n\r\n     Rev. SAMUEL J. MAY deemed a system of action and co-operation all\r\n     that was needed. There is probably not one woman in a thousand,\r\n     not one in ten thousand who has well considered the disabilities,\r\n     literary, pecuniary, social, political, under which she labors.\r\n     Ample provision must be made for woman's education, as liberal\r\n     and thorough as that provided for the other sex.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. C. I. H. NICHOLS favored organization as a means to collect\r\n     and render operative the fragmentary elements now favoring the\r\n     cause.\r\n\r\n     Rev. ABRAM PRYNE, in an able speech, favored National and State\r\n     organization.\r\n\r\nThe discussion was closed by the adoption of the following resolution,\r\nintroduced by Paulina Wright Davis:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That this National Convention earnestly recommends to\r\n     those who are members of it from several States, and to those\r\n     persons in any or all of our States, who are interested in this\r\n     great reform, that they call meetings of the States or the\r\n     counties in which they live, certainly as often as once a year,\r\n     to consider the principles of this reform, and devise measures\r\n     for their promulgation, and thus co-operate with all throughout\r\n     the nation and the world, for the elevation of woman to a proper\r\n     place in the mental, moral, social, religious, and political\r\n     world.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to more than give the spirit of the Convention,\r\nthough glimpses of it and its participants may be caught in the brief\r\nsketch of its proceedings. In accordance with the call, woman's\r\nsocial, civil, and religious rights were all discussed. Lucy Stone\r\nmade a brilliant closing address, the doxology was sung to \"Old\r\nHundred,\" and the Convention adjourned.\r\n\r\nThe character and influence of this Convention can best be shown by\r\nthe reports of the city press.[115]\r\n\r\n                   _The Standard, September 13, 1852_.\r\n\r\n     The WOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION was in session during three days of\r\n     last week in this city, and was attended by a large number of\r\n     persons, not less, probably, than 2,000. Such a Convention, even\r\n     in this city of conventions, was something new under the sun....\r\n     The discussions were characterized by a degree of ability that\r\n     would do credit to any deliberative body in the country.... Some\r\n     able letters were read to the Convention. Among the most\r\n     noteworthy was that of Mrs. Stanton.... Mrs. Mott presided over\r\n     the Convention with much dignity and ability.... If any of the\r\n     natural rights belonging to women are withheld from them by the\r\n     laws and customs of society, it is due to them that a remedy\r\n     should be applied;.... those among them who are aggrieved should\r\n     have an opportunity to give free expression to their opinions.\r\n     This will hurt nobody, and those who profess to be alarmed at the\r\n     result, should dismiss their fears.\r\n\r\n            _The Daily Journal_ (_Whig_), _September 13, 1852_.\r\n\r\n     THE NATIONAL WOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION--After a duration of three\r\n     mortal days this August Convention came to a \"happy and peaceful\r\n     end\" Friday evening.... All who attended any portion of the\r\n     Convention, or the whole, will unite with us in pronouncing it\r\n     the most dignified, orderly, and interesting deliberative body\r\n     ever convened in this city. The officers, and most especially\r\n     the distinguished woman who occupied the president's chair,\r\n     evinced a thorough acquaintance with the duties of their station,\r\n     and performed them in an admirable manner.... No person\r\n     acquainted with the doings of the assembly and capable of passing\r\n     judgment in the matter, will deny there was a greater amount of\r\n     talent in the Woman's Rights Convention than has characterized\r\n     any public gathering in this State during ten years past, and\r\n     probably a longer period, if ever.... For compact logic, eloquent\r\n     and correct expression, and the making of plain and frequent\r\n     points, we have never met the equal of two or three of the\r\n     number. The appearance of all before the audience was modest and\r\n     unassuming, though prompt, energetic, and confident.\r\n\r\n     Business was brought forward, calmly deliberated upon, and\r\n     discussed with unanimity, and in a spirit becoming true woman,\r\n     and which would add an unknown dignity and consequent influence\r\n     to the transactions of public associations of the \"lords.\"....\r\n     The appearance of the platform was pleasing and really imposing\r\n     in the extreme. The galaxy of bold women--for they were really\r\n     bold, indeed they are daring women--presented a spectacle the\r\n     like of which we never before witnessed. A glance at the \"good\r\n     old lady\" who presided with so much dignity and propriety, and\r\n     through the list to the youngest engaged in the cause, was enough\r\n     to impress the unprejudiced beholder with the idea that there\r\n     must be something in the movement.... The audience was large and\r\n     more impressive than has marked any convention ever held here....\r\n     We feel in a mood to dip lightly into a discussion of the Woman's\r\n     Rights question.... Our sober second thought dictates that a\r\n     three days' enlightenment at the intellectual feast spread by\r\n     Beauty and Genius, may have turned our brains, and consequently\r\n     we desist.\r\n\r\nThe discussions of this Convention did not end with its adjournment;\r\nits _sine die_ had effect only upon the assembled body; for months\r\nafterward controversies and discussions, both public and private, took\r\nplace. Clergymen of Syracuse and adjoining cities kept the interest\r\nglowing by their efforts to destroy the influence of the Convention by\r\nthe cry of \"infidel.\" A clergyman of Auburn not only preached against\r\nthe Convention as \"infidel,\" but as one holding authority over the\r\nconsciences of his flock, boldly asserted that \"no member of his\r\ncongregation was tainted with the unholy doctrine of woman's rights.\"\r\n\r\nRev. Byron Sunderland, pastor of the Plymouth Congregational Church of\r\nSyracuse (since Chaplain of the United States Senate), characterized\r\nit in his sermon[116] as a \"Bloomer Convention,\" taking for his text\r\nDeut. xxii. 5:\r\n\r\n     The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto man; neither\r\n     shall a man put on a woman's garment; for all that do so are an\r\n     abomination to the Lord thy God.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gage's reply, in the absence of the editor, appeared in _The\r\nStar_, in whose columns Rev. Mr. Sunderland's sermon had been given\r\nthe public, calling forth the following letter:\r\n\r\n                                   WASHINGTON, _Nov. 20, 1852_.\r\n\r\n     The readers of _The Star_ are aware that the editor does not\r\n     sanction the ridiculous stuff which appeared in the issues of the\r\n     17th and 18th insts. over the signature of \"M\" upon the subject\r\n     of \"Woman's Rights,\" nor does he approve of its admission in the\r\n     columns of the paper, and hereby disclaims having authorized the\r\n     publication of any such emanations from the pit during his\r\n     absence from home. When at his post he sometimes gives publicity\r\n     to such communications for the purpose of showing up the fallacy\r\n     of the positions taken, but never does he intend, so long as he\r\n     has control of its columns, to allow _The Star_ to become the\r\n     medium of disseminating corrupt and unwholesome doctrines. Such\r\n     doctrines have found and will continue to find means enough with\r\n     which to do their duty in Syracuse without the aid of a\r\n     _reputable_ newspaper in their behalf; and the editor indeed is\r\n     greatly surprised that those who temporarily fill his place,\r\n     should lend _The Star_ to so base purposes. We trust that these\r\n     words (if discretion does not) will prevent further encroachment\r\n     upon our good nature.\r\n\r\n_The Carson League_, quoting the above editorial, says:\r\n\r\n     It is the first paragraph of the above letter that is noticeable.\r\n     _The Star_ is the organ of a certain class of ministers. Messrs.\r\n     Sunderland and Ashley and _The Star_ nestle in a common sympathy.\r\n     It is significant of the character of their published sermons,\r\n     that _The Star_ stands alone in their defence. More significant\r\n     still that _The Star_ negates all replies to them, even by a\r\n     lady. \"_Put out the light_,\" says the thief. \"_Put out the\r\n     light_,\" says the assassin. \"_Put out the light_,\" says _The\r\n     Star_; and verily if these gentlemen had their way, the light\r\n     would go out in Egyptian darkness. It is wholesome doctrine, in\r\n     the opinion of _The Star_, to deny woman's rights and negro's\r\n     rights and the right of free discussion, to maintain them is to\r\n     countenance \"corrupt and unwholesome doctrines.\"\r\n\r\n     The subject of woman's rights somehow is attracting general\r\n     attention. Rev. Mr. Sunderland, of this city, in a published\r\n     sermon, sought to bring the whole matter into contempt under\r\n     cover of the ridicule of the Bloomer dress. His position is, that\r\n     if God made man a little lower than the angels, He made woman a\r\n     little lower still. His sermon we gave last week. This week we\r\n     give a woman's reply to it. Nobly has she shown him up. We like\r\n     her review. She treats his argument gravely, and answers it\r\n     logically. She has touched the tender in him. He will begin to\r\n     think women are somebody after all. We think he should have\r\n     measured his _calibre_ before making such a tilt.... Regarding\r\n     his condition as rather awkward, and finding it difficult to be\r\n     quiet, he appears in the Friday _Star_ with the following\r\n     equivocal communication:\r\n\r\n     _The Woman's Rights Question._--Mr. Editor: The last two numbers\r\n     of _The Star_ contain an article purporting to review my Sermon\r\n     from Deut. xxii. 5, but the author does not appear. The article\r\n     in question contains inaccuracies which should be noticed for the\r\n     author's future benefit. If the author should turn out to be a\r\n     man, I should have no objection to point out those inaccuracies\r\n     through your columns. But if the writer is a lady, why, I really\r\n     don't know yet what I shall do. If I thought she would consent to\r\n     a personal interview, I should like to see her.\r\n\r\n                                        Very truly,\r\n                                                     B. SUNDERLAND.\r\n     _Syracuse, Nov. 18_.\r\n\r\nSome other person, under the head of \"A Reader,\" addressed the\r\nfollowing to _The Star_, which, in the editor's absence, was\r\npublished:\r\n\r\n     How is this, Mr. Editor? A few days since I read in your papers a\r\n     sermon, on woman's rights by Rev. Byron Sunderland. In your\r\n     numbers of Wednesday and Thursday I found an able and respectful\r\n     Review of that discourse--a Review which, in some points, is\r\n     unanswerable, especially in the matter of Scripture and female\r\n     dress. The dominie appealed to Scripture, and the reviewer \"has\r\n     him fast.\" I have heard it more than once intimated that the\r\n     writer of this able, and in some instances most eloquent, review,\r\n     is a lady of this city. Are we to understand that it is an\r\n     article in the code of anti-progressive ethics, that the same\r\n     article written by a man, will be answered by Mr. Sunderland, but\r\n     if written by a woman, will not be answered? I may have\r\n     misunderstood Mr. Sunderland's note in this morning's _Star_, but\r\n     I so understood it. If correctly understood no comment is\r\n     necessary.\r\n                                                         A READER.\r\n     _November 19, 1852._\r\n\r\nUpon the expression of Mr. Sunderland's desire to meet the reviewer of\r\nhis sermon, if a lady, and his willingness to continue the\r\ncontroversy, _The Star_ finally opened its columns to Mrs. Gage,\r\nalthough delaying the publication of her articles, sometimes for\r\nweeks, to suit the dominie's convenience, and allowing his reply to\r\nappear in the same issue of the paper with her answer to his preceding\r\narticle. Mr. Sunderland's reply to \"A Reader\" was characteristic of\r\nthe spirit of the clergy, not only of their intolerance, but of their\r\npatronizing and insulting manner toward all persons who presumed to\r\nquestion either their authority or learning.\r\n\r\n     The impertinence of \"A Reader\" is quite characteristic. That\r\n     individual probably knows as much about the Bible as a wild ass'\r\n     colt, and is requested at this time to keep a proper distance.\r\n     When a body is trying to find out and pay attention to a lady, it\r\n     is not good manners for \"A Reader\" to be thrust in between us.\r\n\r\nRev. Mr. Ashley, rector of St. Paul's, the first Episcopal Church of\r\nSyracuse, also preached a sermon against woman, which was published in\r\npamphlet form, and scattered over the State. This sermon was reviewed\r\nby a committee of ladies appointed by the Ladies' Lyceum. It was an\r\nable and lengthy document from the pen of the chairman of the\r\ncommittee, a member of the Episcopal Church, and was a significant\r\nsign of woman's growing independence of clerical authority. This\r\nsermon and its reply was also published by the city press; the\r\nChurch, the press, and the fireside all aiding in the continued\r\ndissemination of the woman's rights discussion.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the proceedings of the Convention in pamphlet form\r\ngave _The Star_ occasion for a new fulmination which not only farther\r\nshowed the base character of this sheet, but which shocked all devout\r\nminds by its patronizing tone toward the Deity. Both in the Convention\r\nand its following debate, Syracuse well maintained its character for\r\nradicalism.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOB CONVENTION IN NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nBROADWAY TABERNACLE, _Sept. 6 and 7, 1853_.\r\n\r\nThis week as already stated was one of unusual excitement in the city\r\nof New York, as representatives of all the unpopular reforms were\r\nholding their several conventions. The fact that the Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety held a meeting on Sunday morning, and Antoinette Brown\r\npreached to five thousand people the same evening, called out the\r\ndenunciations of the religious press, which intensified the mob\r\nspirit, culminating at last in the Woman's Rights Convention. That\r\nportion of the secular press which had shown the most bitter\r\nopposition to the anti-slavery cause, now manifested the same spirit\r\ntoward the enfranchisement of woman.\r\n\r\nThe leading papers in the United States were _The Tribune_, _The\r\nHerald_, _The Times_, _The Evening Post_, and _The Express_, which\r\ngave tone to the entire press of the country. All these journals were\r\nedited by men of marked ability, each representing a different class\r\nof thought in the community. _The Tribune_ was independent, and\r\nfearless in the expression of opinions on unpopular reforms; its\r\neditor, Horace Greeley, ever ready for the consideration of new ideas,\r\nwas on many points the leader of liberal thought.\r\n\r\n_The Herald_ was recognized by reformers as at the head of the\r\nopposition, and its diatribes were considered \"Satanic.\" Its editor,\r\nJames Gordon Bennett, pandered to the lowest tastes in the community,\r\nnot merely deriding reforms, but holding their advocates up to the\r\nridicule of a class too degraded to understand the meaning of reform.\r\n\r\n_The Times_ held a middle position; established at a much later date,\r\nits influence was not so great nor extended as either _The Tribune_ or\r\n_The Herald_. It represented that large conservative class that fears\r\nall change, and accepts the conditions of its own day and generation,\r\nknowing that in all upheavals the wealthy class is the first and\r\ngreatest loser. From this source the mob spirit draws its\r\ninspiration. Violence being the outgrowth of superstition and\r\ndespotism; the false morality and philosophy taught by the press and\r\nthe pulpit are illustrated by the lower orders in hisses, groans, and\r\nbrick-bats. Although far below Horace Greeley in sagacity,\r\nintelligence, and conscience, Henry J. Raymond claimed for his paper a\r\nposition superior in respectability. Having originated the present\r\nsystem of reporting, and thereby acquired his first reputation, Mr.\r\nRaymond prided himself upon reportorial sharpness, even at the expense\r\nof veracity and common self-respect. That woman so long degraded\r\nshould dare to speak of injustice, so long defrauded of her social,\r\ncivil, and political rights, should dare to demand some restitution,\r\nwas to Mr. Raymond so fit a subject for ridicule that he could not\r\nrefrain from making even such women as Lucretia Mott and Ernestine L.\r\nRose targets for his irony.\r\n\r\n_The Empress_, an organ of the Democratic party, was in its debasement\r\non a par with _The Herald_ and _Times_, though each had different\r\nstyles, more or less refined, of doing the same thing. Encouraged by\r\nthese three papers, the mob element held high carnival through that\r\neventful week. Starting in the anti-slavery and temperance meetings,\r\nthey assembled at every session in the Woman's Rights Convention.\r\nGentlemen and ladies alike who attempted to speak were interrupted by\r\nshouts, hisses, stamping, and cheers, rude remarks, and all manner of\r\nnoisy demonstrations. The clergy, the press, and the rowdies combined\r\nto make those September days a disgrace to the metropolis, days never\r\nto be forgotten by those who endured the ridicule and persecution.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Mayor with a large police force at his command made no\r\nshow even of protecting the right of free speech, the editor of _The\r\nTribune_ sent forth his grand fulminations against bigotry, hypocrisy,\r\nand vulgarity in every issue of his journal. William Cullen Bryant,\r\neditor of _The Post_, one of the purest men that ever stood at the\r\nhead of a daily paper, also spoke out grandly against mob law, and for\r\nthe rights of woman. We have made this brief episode on the press,\r\nthat our readers may see how characteristic are the comments of each\r\npaper that we give here and there in this chapter.\r\n\r\nThis Convention, interrupted throughout by the mob, has an unique and\r\nhistoric value of its own. It was the first overt exhibition of that\r\npublic sentiment woman was then combating. The mob represented more\r\nthan itself; it evidenced that general masculine opinion of woman,\r\nwhich condensed into law, forges the chains which enslave her. Owing\r\nto the turmoil we have no fair report of the proceedings; it was\r\nimpossible for the representatives of the press to catch what was\r\nsaid, hence their reports, as well as the one issued by our Central\r\nCommittee, are alike fragmentary. And yet with such a brilliant array\r\nof speakers of both men and women, it should have been one of our most\r\ninteresting and successful Conventions. The Tabernacle, holding three\r\nthousand persons, was packed long before the hour announced. At ten\r\no'clock Lucy Stone called the Convention to order, and presented a\r\nlist of officers[117] nominated at a preliminary meeting, which was\r\nadopted. In this list we find England, Germany, and eleven States\r\nrepresented. The Rev. William Henry Channing opened the meeting with\r\nprayer. After which Mrs. Mott made a few appropriate remarks. Lucy\r\nStone read a series of resolutions[118] which were accepted and laid\r\non the table for discussion.\r\n\r\nCharles Burleigh and Lydia A. Jenkins spoke briefly on the many\r\ngrounds of opposition to this movement, which in all respects commends\r\nitself as one of the greatest reforms of the age.\r\n\r\n     Mr. GARRISON said: The first pertinent question is, what has\r\n     brought us together? Why have we come from the East and from the\r\n     West, and from the North? I was about to add, and from the South;\r\n     but the South, alas! is so cursed by the spirit of slavery, that\r\n     there seems to be no vitality left there in regard to any\r\n     enterprise, however good; hence the South is not represented on\r\n     an occasion like this. It is because justice is outraged. We have\r\n     met to protest against proud, rapacious, inexorable usurpation.\r\n     What is this usurpation? What is this oppression of which we\r\n     complain? Is it local? Does it pertain to the city of New York,\r\n     or to the Empire State? No! It is universal--broader than the\r\n     Empire State--broader than our national domains--wide as the\r\n     whole world, weighing on the entire human race. How old is the\r\n     oppression which we have met to look in the face? Is it of\r\n     to-day? Is it young in years, or is it as old as the world\r\n     itself? In all ages men have regarded women as inferior to\r\n     themselves, and have robbed them of their co-equal rights. We\r\n     are, therefore, contesting hoary tyranny--universal tyranny. And\r\n     what follows, as a natural result?\r\n\r\n     That the land is beginning to be convulsed. The opposition to the\r\n     movement is assuming a malignant, desperate, and satanic\r\n     character; every missile of wickedness that can be hurled against\r\n     it is used. The pulpit is excited, the press is aroused; Church\r\n     and State are in arms to put down a movement on behalf of justice\r\n     to one-half of the whole human race. (Laughter and cheers). The\r\n     Bible, revered in our land as the inspired Word of God, is, by\r\n     pulpit interpreters, made directly hostile to what we are\r\n     endeavoring to obtain as a measure of right and justice; and the\r\n     cry of infidelity is heard on the right hand and on the left, in\r\n     order to combine public opinion so as to extinguish the movement.\r\n\r\n     Now, beloved, let us not imagine that any strange thing has\r\n     happened to us. We are but passing through one of the world's\r\n     great crises; we, too, in our day, are permitted to contend with\r\n     spiritual wickedness in high places--with principalities and\r\n     powers. What reform was ever yet begun and carried on with any\r\n     reputation in the day thereof? What reform, however glorious and\r\n     divine, was ever advocated at the outset with rejoicing? And if\r\n     they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how much more\r\n     them of his household? (Cheers and stamping).\r\n\r\n     I have been derisively called a \"_Woman's Rights Man_.\" I know no\r\n     such distinction. I claim to be a HUMAN RIGHTS MAN, and wherever\r\n     there is a human being, I see God-given rights inherent in that\r\n     being whatever may be the sex or complexion.\r\n\r\n     To the excellence of the movement God has given witnesses in\r\n     abundance, on the right hand and on the left. Show me a cause\r\n     anathematized by the chief priests, the scribes, and the\r\n     pharisees; which politicians and demagogues endeavor to crush,\r\n     which reptiles and serpents in human flesh try to spread their\r\n     slime over, and hiss down, and I will show you a cause which God\r\n     loves, and angels contemplate with admiration. Such is our\r\n     movement. Do you want the compliments of the satanic press, _The\r\n     New York Times_, _Express_, and _Herald_? (Roars of laughter). If\r\n     you want the compliments of such journals, you will be bad enough\r\n     to take a place among the very vilest and lowest of the human\r\n     race. They are animated by a brutal, cowardly, and devilish\r\n     spirit. Let us rejoice at the manifestation! Not for the\r\n     wickedness, but at the evidence thus afforded by God, that our\r\n     cause is of Heaven, and therefore has on its side all the power\r\n     and might of God, and in due season is destined to have a\r\n     glorious triumph!\r\n\r\n     CHARLES C. BURLEIGH said: There is a feeling to-day that woman\r\n     has some rights, that she has some reason to complain of the\r\n     present relation in which she is placed. In this country we\r\n     congratulate ourselves that woman occupies a higher position than\r\n     elsewhere, although some think it would be a calamity to improve\r\n     her condition still further, and mere fanaticism to raise her\r\n     still higher.\r\n\r\n     The cry is--\"unnatural!\" The aspiration of woman for a better\r\n     lot, say her oppressors, is not natural, it is abnormal! So they\r\n     say; but why not hear her on the matter? Is she, the most\r\n     interested party, to have no voice in the solution of a question\r\n     which is to her of such overwhelming interest? I ask, did God\r\n     give woman aspirations which it is a sin for her to gratify?\r\n     Abnormal! No, it is to be found everywhere. The man whose soul\r\n     is so callous that he can hold his fellow-man as a slave, cries\r\n     out (as in excuse) that the slave is contented. The autocrat\r\n     exclaims that it is only a turbulent Kossuth or a factious\r\n     Mazzini who feels that uneasy discontent which preys not on the\r\n     hearts of his millions of legal slaves. Will that be, to us, an\r\n     argument that the tyrant is in the right? No! the aspirations to\r\n     liberty and justice are universal, and ever though the volcanic\r\n     blaze breaks into the air only through the loftiest mountain\r\n     peaks, the volcano is in itself an index to the ocean of molten\r\n     fire that boils inaudibly beneath it. And so the deep discontent\r\n     of humble millions breaks through the mountain-minds of their\r\n     great leaders. Woman is a part of the human commonwealth; why\r\n     deprive her of a voice in its government? Woman herself, a\r\n     component part of the community, must be called into the councils\r\n     which direct it, else a wrong is done her, the responsibility of\r\n     which lies heavily on those who do it. We ask rights for woman,\r\n     because she has a human nature, and it is not only ungenerous and\r\n     unmanly, but in the highest degree unjust to banish her from the\r\n     discussion of questions which so nearly and dearly concern her,\r\n     and in which nature, reason, and God have announced that she\r\n     should have a voice.\r\n\r\n     Either there is a distinction between the sphere of man and that\r\n     of woman, or there is not. If there is, it is unfair to have one\r\n     determine both; if there is not, why does tyrannous custom\r\n     separate her? The dilemma is clear, and can not be escaped. Both\r\n     should be called into counsel, every note in the scale of harmony\r\n     should be sounded; and to say that hers, because an octave\r\n     higher, should not be heard, is downright nonsense. (Rousing\r\n     cheers and laughter). We claim for woman simply the right to\r\n     decide her own sphere, or, in conjunction with man, to determine\r\n     what should be the relative position of both.\r\n\r\n     W. H. CHANNING said: When I was returning from the first Woman's\r\n     Rights Meeting at Worcester, a friend said to me, \"I intend\r\n     getting up a Man's Rights Society; you misunderstand the matter;\r\n     all the efforts of society are for the elevation of woman, and\r\n     man has to perform the drudgery. The consequence is, the women\r\n     are far better educated than the men.\" The answer was obvious.\r\n     \"If women are, according to your admission, fitted for the higher\r\n     plane, why keep them on the lower?\" My friend then went on to\r\n     say, that the whole of this scheme was considered to be of the\r\n     most morally visionary character, and the proof of this feeling\r\n     was the slight opposition it met, \"for,\" said he \"if it were\r\n     looked on by society as serious, it would be at once, and\r\n     forcibly, opposed in the church, by the press, in all public\r\n     assemblies and private circles.\" Now, the object of this, and all\r\n     such conventions, is to prove that we have made up our minds as\r\n     regards operation and method; that we have looked clearly into\r\n     the future; and that we have at heart this movement, as we have\r\n     no other of the day, believing that out of this central agitation\r\n     of society will come healthful issues of life. The inhabitants of\r\n     Eastern India speak of a process for gaining immortality, namely,\r\n     churning together the sea and the earth. They say the gods had\r\n     the serpent by the head, and the devils had it by the tail, and\r\n     out of the churning of the foam came the waters of immortality.\r\n     The movement we are engaged in, may be typified by the Indian\r\n     allegory; and out of the commotion we make shall be drawn a new\r\n     principle which shall be one of immortal growth to all society.\r\n     (Stamping, cheers, and laughter).\r\n\r\n     As regards the differences between men and women, we say that out\r\n     of them grows union, not separation. Every organ of the body is\r\n     double; in the pulsations of the heart a double machinery is\r\n     used, there is a double auricle and a double ventricle. It is so\r\n     in the inspirations which flow from God to society; they must\r\n     pass twice, once through the heart of man, once through the heart\r\n     of woman; they must stream through the reforming and through the\r\n     conservative organ; and thus, out of the very difference which\r\n     exists between man and woman, arises the necessity for their\r\n     co-operation. It has never been asserted that man and woman are\r\n     alike; if they were, where would be the necessity for urging the\r\n     claims of the one? No; they differ, and for that very reason it\r\n     is, that only through the action of both, can the fullness of\r\n     their being find development and expression. We know that woman\r\n     exerts an influence on man, as man does on woman, to call forth\r\n     his latent resources. In the difference, we find a call for\r\n     union. And to this union we perceive no limit; on the contrary,\r\n     whatever necessity there is for the combination in the private,\r\n     there is the same necessity for it in the public sphere. (Long\r\n     continued stamping and cheers).\r\n\r\n     And now I will meet the two great objections made. It is not\r\n     objectionable, it is said, that woman, in some spheres of life,\r\n     should give an expression of her intellect; but, on the platform,\r\n     she loses her character of woman, and becomes incidentally\r\n     masculine. Just observe the practical absurdities of which\r\n     society is guilty. The largest assemblies greet with clamors\r\n     Jenny Lind, when she enchains the ear and exalts the soul with\r\n     the sublime strain, \"I know that my Redeemer liveth\"; but when\r\n     Mrs. Mott or Miss Brown stands with a simple voice, and in the\r\n     spirit of truth, to make manifest the honor due to our Redeemer,\r\n     rowdies hiss, and respectable Christians veil their faces! So,\r\n     woman can sing, but not speak, that \"our Redeemer liveth.\" Again,\r\n     the great men of our land do not consider it unworthy of their\r\n     character to take from Fanny Ellsler what she makes by the\r\n     movement of her limbs, by a mere mechanical action,[119] to aid\r\n     in erecting a column to commemorate our struggles for liberty.\r\n     The dollars are received and built into the column; but when Mrs.\r\n     Rose or Mrs. Foster, who feels the spirit of justice within her,\r\n     and who has felt the injustice of the laws, stands up to show\r\n     truth and justice, and build a spiritual column, she is out of\r\n     her sphere! and the honorable men turn aside, and leave her to be\r\n     the victim of rowdyism, disorder, and lawlessness! It is not out\r\n     of character that Fanny Kemble should read Shakespeare on the\r\n     stage, to large circles. The exercise of the voice on the stage\r\n     is womanly, while she gives out the thoughts of another; but\r\n     suppose (and it is not unsupposable) a living female Shakespeare\r\n     to appear on a platform, and utter her inspirations, delicacy is\r\n     shocked, decency is outraged, and society turns away in disgust!\r\n     Such are the consistencies of the nineteenth century! (Great\r\n     uproar).\r\n\r\n     This is simply and merely prejudice, and it reminds me of the\r\n     proverb, \"If you would behold the stars aright, blow out your own\r\n     taper.\" I say there is a special reason why woman should come\r\n     forward as a speaker; because she has a power of eloquence which\r\n     man has not, arising from the fineness of her organization and\r\n     the intuitive power of her soul; and I charge any man with\r\n     arrogance, if he pretend to match himself in this respect with\r\n     many women here, and thousands throughout our country. (Hissing).\r\n     I take it, the hissing comes from men who never had a mother to\r\n     love and honor, a sister to protect, and who never knew the worth\r\n     of a wife. Woman's power to cut to the quick and touch the\r\n     conscience, is beautifully accompanied by her unmatched\r\n     adaptation to pour balm into the wound; and though the flame she\r\n     applies may burn into the soul, it also affords a light to the\r\n     conscience which never can be dimmed.\r\n\r\n     There is an exquisite picture by Retsch, which represents angels\r\n     showering roses on devils; to the angels they are roses, but the\r\n     devils writhe under them as under fire. On sinful souls the words\r\n     of women fall as coals from the altar of God. And here let me\r\n     offer my humble gratitude to the women who have borne the brunt\r\n     of the test with the calm courage which women alone can exhibit;\r\n     to the women who have taught us that, as daughters of God, they\r\n     are the equals of His children everywhere on earth. (Cheers and\r\n     stamping).\r\n\r\n     Let me add another word upon this interference, or, rather,\r\n     entrance of woman into the sphere of politics. As a spiritual\r\n     being, her duties are like those of man; but, inasmuch as she is\r\n     different from man, man can not discharge them; and if there be\r\n     any truth in holding (as our institutions do), that the voice of\r\n     the whole is the nearest approach we can make to eternal truth,\r\n     we, of course, can not arrive at it till woman, as well as man,\r\n     is heard in the search for it. God, not man, nor herself, made\r\n     her woman; there is nothing arbitrary in the distinction; and let\r\n     the true woman go where she may, she will retain her womanhood.\r\n     We wish to see her enter into politics, not to degrade herself,\r\n     but to bring them up to her own level of simple-heartedness and\r\n     purity of soul. Can man ever raise them to that lofty height?\r\n     Never! woman alone can do it; it is a work reserved for her, and\r\n     by her and her alone will it be done. (Roars of laughter).\r\n\r\n     Whose exploits leave the brightest lines of moral courage on the\r\n     historic page? Those of woman! When the French had broken through\r\n     the barriers, the maid of Saragossa rushed to the breach. The\r\n     demand of the invader came to Palafox, and he trembled; but what\r\n     the heart of man was unequal to, the courage of woman could\r\n     perform, and the answer of the heroic maiden was, \"War to the\r\n     knife!\" And so, always when man has faltered, woman, earnest and\r\n     simple-hearted, has answered, War to the knife with evil! (A\r\n     frightful yell from the gallery.) I perceive my friend is anxious\r\n     to hear a woman speak to him as only a woman can. I will soon\r\n     give way and let him be gratified; but, first, I will tell him an\r\n     anecdote. A woman once told me she never saw a horse so wild that\r\n     she could not tame him. I asked her how, and she answered,\r\n     \"Simply by whispering in his ear.\" Our wild friend in the\r\n     gallery will probably receive some benefit listening to the\r\n     voice of a woman, if his ears be only long enough to hear her.\r\n     (Prolonged cheers).\r\n\r\n     ANTOINETTE BROWN said: Our cause is progressing triumphantly; and\r\n     yet it is not without some to oppose it. Who are they? Persons\r\n     utterly ignorant of the claims which its advocates advance,\r\n     ignorant alike of the wrongs existing and of the remedy proposed.\r\n     They suppose that a few mad-cap reformers are endeavoring to\r\n     overthrow dame Nature, to invert society, to play the part of\r\n     merciless innovators to imperil religion, to place all civil and\r\n     religious freedom in jeopardy; that if our ends were accomplished\r\n     all the public and private virtues would be melted as in a\r\n     crucible and thrown upon the ground, thence to cry aloud to\r\n     heaven like the blood of righteous Abel. Were it not that\r\n     curiosity is largely developed in this class, they would go down\r\n     to their graves wholly uninformed of our true principles,\r\n     motives, and aims. They look upon us as black beetles or\r\n     death's-heads, to be turned away from with horror; but their\r\n     curiosity overcomes their repugnance, and they would investigate\r\n     some of our properties, as a naturalist does those of a noxious\r\n     animal. (Cheers and laughter).\r\n\r\n     There is another class, that of genuine bigots, with hearts so\r\n     ossified that no room can be found for one noble and expansive\r\n     principle within those little stony cells. Many of this class may\r\n     be persons of excellent intentions; they would do us good if they\r\n     could, but they approach us with somewhat of the feeling with\r\n     which Miss Ophelia regarded Topsy, the abhorrence that is\r\n     experienced on drawing near a large black spider. They try to\r\n     show us our errors, but if we attempt to justify by argument the\r\n     ground we have taken, they cry aloud that we are obstinate and\r\n     unreasonable, especially when we quote text for text, as Christ\r\n     did when talking with a certain person of old.\r\n\r\n     But the most hopeless and spiteful of our opponents is that large\r\n     class of women whose merits are not their own; who have acquired\r\n     some influence in society, not by any noble thoughts they have\r\n     framed and uttered, not by any great deed they have done, but by\r\n     the accident of having fathers, brothers, or husbands whose\r\n     wealth elevates them to the highest wave of fashion, and there\r\n     enables them to roll in luxurious and indolent pomp, like Venus\r\n     newly risen from the ocean. They feel how much easier it is to\r\n     receive the incense of honor and respect (however insincerely\r\n     paid to them) without any effort of their own, than to undergo\r\n     the patient toil after excellence which wrings from the heart of\r\n     all that homage of true honor which can not be denied to it.\r\n     They, unused to any noble labor (as all labor is), either\r\n     physical or mental, will be careful, to a degree of splenetic\r\n     antagonism, how they will allow the introduction, into the\r\n     acknowledged rights and duties of their sex, of a new element\r\n     which may establish the necessity of their being themselves\r\n     energetic and efficient. We need never hope to find any of this\r\n     class change, until compelled to do so by public sentiment. The\r\n     opposition here is really rabid. Intellectual women! oh, they are\r\n     monsters! As soon allow wild beasts to roam at large as these to\r\n     be let loose on society. Like lions and tigers, keep them in\r\n     their menagerie; perhaps they needn't be actually chained, but\r\n     see that they are well secured in their cages! (Stamping, groans,\r\n     and laughter).\r\n\r\n     These are far more bitterly hostile than the men of small\r\n     proportions, who are willing to have a great woman tower above\r\n     them from time to time--as a Madame de Stael. Such a case,\r\n     however, they would rank as an exception, not admit as a rule. To\r\n     allow women to stand every day in the foremost lines of intellect\r\n     and ability, is a thought altogether too expansive to be\r\n     entertained by them.\r\n\r\n     Such are the oppositions we meet; but they are all melting down\r\n     like frost-work before the morning sun. The day is dawning when\r\n     the intellect of woman shall be recognized as well as that of\r\n     man, and when her rights shall meet an equal and cordial\r\n     acknowledgment. The greatest wrong and injustice ever done to\r\n     woman is that done to her intellectual nature. This, like Goliath\r\n     among the Philistines, overtops all the rest. Drones are but the\r\n     robbers of the hive; ladies educated to no purpose are but\r\n     surfeited to a dronish condition on the sweets of literature.\r\n     Such minds are not developed, but molded in a fashionable\r\n     pattern.\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE said: It has been stated that we women were not fit\r\n     for anything but to stay in the house! I look over the events of\r\n     the last five years, and almost smile at the confutation of this\r\n     statement which they supply. Let it not be supposed that I wish\r\n     to depreciate the value of house-duties, or the worth of the\r\n     woman who fitly discharges them. No! I think that any woman who\r\n     stands on the throne of her own house, dispensing there the\r\n     virtues of love, charity, and peace, and sends out of it into the\r\n     world good men, who may help to make the world better, occupies a\r\n     higher position than any crowned head. However, we said women\r\n     could do more; they could enter the professions, and there serve\r\n     society and do themselves honor. We said that women could be\r\n     doctors of medicine. Well, we can now prove the statement by\r\n     fact. Harriot K. Hunt is among us to-day, who, by recognized\r\n     attainment and successful practice, has shown that women can be\r\n     physicians, and good ones. You have in your city two women who\r\n     are good physicians; there are female medical colleges, with\r\n     their classes, as well ordered, and showing as good a proficiency\r\n     as any classes of men. Thus that point is gained. It was said\r\n     women could not be merchants. We thought they could; we saw\r\n     nothing to prevent women from using the power of calculation, the\r\n     knowledge of goods, and the industry necessary to make a\r\n     successful trader. Here, again, we have abundant examples. Many\r\n     women could be pointed to whose energy and ability for business\r\n     have repaired the losses of their less competent husbands, I will\r\n     mention a particular case. Mrs. Tyndal, of Lowell, Mass., has for\r\n     years carried on business in a quiet way; she has made herself\r\n     rich by conducting a ladies' shoe store in Lowell. She said to\r\n     herself: \"What is to hinder me from going into this business? I\r\n     should know ladies' shoes, whether they were good or bad, and\r\n     what price they can bring. The ladies should support me.\" And so\r\n     they did, and that woman has given a proof that her sex does not\r\n     incapacitate for successful mercanti  le operations.\r\n\r\n     It is said women could not be ministers of religion. Last Sunday,\r\n     at Metropolitan Hall, Antoinette L. Brown conducted divine\r\n     service, and was joined in it by the largest congregation\r\n     assembled within the walls of any building in this city.\r\n     (Hisses). Some men hiss who had no mothers to teach them better.\r\n     But I tell you that some men in New York, knowing that they can\r\n     hear the word of God from a woman, as well as from a man, have\r\n     called her to be their pastor, and she is to be ordained in this\r\n     month. Some of you reporters said she was a Unitarian, but it is\r\n     not so; she is among the most orthodox, and so is her church.\r\n\r\n     We have caused woman's right to address an audience to be more\r\n     fully recognized than before. I once addressed an assemblage of\r\n     men, and did so without giving previous notice, because I feared\r\n     the opposition of prejudice. A lady who was among the audience\r\n     said to me afterward, \"How could you do it? My blood ran cold\r\n     when I saw you up there among those men!\" \"Why,\" I asked, \"are\r\n     they bad men?\" \"Oh, no! my own husband is one of them; but to see\r\n     a woman mixing among men in promiscuous meetings, it was\r\n     horrible!\" That was six or seven years ago last fall; and that\r\n     self-same woman, in Columbus, Ohio, was chosen to preside over a\r\n     temperance meeting of men and women; yes, and she took the chair\r\n     without the least objection! In Chicago, a woman is cashier of a\r\n     bank; and the men gave her a majority of three hundred votes over\r\n     her man-competitor. In another State, a woman is register of\r\n     deeds. Women can be editors; two sit behind me, Paulina W. Davis\r\n     and Mrs. Nichols. Thus we have an accumulation of _facts_ to\r\n     support our claims and our arguments.\r\n\r\n                        _Daily Tribune, Sept. 7, 1853._\r\n\r\n     The Woman's Rights Convention was somewhat disturbed last evening\r\n     by persons whose ideas of the rights of free speech are these:\r\n     two thousand people assemble to hear a given public question\r\n     discussed under distinct announcement that certain persons whose\r\n     general views are well known, are to speak throughout the\r\n     evening. At least nineteen-twentieths come to hear those\r\n     announced speakers, and will be bitterly disappointed if the\r\n     opportunity be not afforded them. But one-twentieth have bought\r\n     tickets and taken seats on purpose to prevent the hearing of\r\n     those speakers, by hissing, yelling, and stamping, and all manner\r\n     of unseemly interruptions. Under such circumstances, which should\r\n     prevail; the right of the speakers to be heard and the great body\r\n     of the audience to hear them according to the announcement, or\r\n     the will of the disturbers who choose to say that nineteen out of\r\n     twenty shall not have what they have paid for, and what the\r\n     promised speakers are most willing to give them?\r\n\r\n     To state the case exactly as it is, precludes the necessity of\r\n     arguing it. We rejoice to say that the will of the great majority\r\n     prevailed, and that the discussion which was marked in its\r\n     earlier days by occasional tumult was closed in good order, and\r\n     amid hushed and gratified attention. We ought, perhaps, to return\r\n     thanks to the disturbers for so stirring the souls of the\r\n     speakers that their words came gushing forth from their lips with\r\n     exceeding fluency and power. We certainly never before heard\r\n     Antoinette Brown, Mrs. Rose, and Lucy Stone speak with such power\r\n     and unction as _last night_. It was never before so transparent\r\n     that a hiss or a blackguard yell was the only answer that the\r\n     case admitted of, and when Lucy Stone closed the discussion with\r\n     some pungent, yet pathetic remarks on the sort of opposition\r\n     that had been manifest, it was evident that if any of the rowdies\r\n     had an ant-hole in the bottom of his boot, he would inevitably\r\n     have sunk through it and disappeared forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Herald, Sept. 7, 1853._\r\n\r\n      THE LAST VAGARY OF THE GREELEY CLIQUE--THE WOMEN, THEIR RIGHTS,\r\n                            AND THEIR CHAMPIONS.\r\n\r\n     The assemblage of rampant women which convened at the Tabernacle\r\n     yesterday was an interesting phase in the comic history of the\r\n     nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n     We saw, in broad daylight, in a public hall in the city of New\r\n     York, a gathering of unsexed women--unsexed in mind all of them,\r\n     and many in habiliments--publicly propounding the doctrine that\r\n     they should be allowed to step out of their appropriate sphere,\r\n     and mingle in the busy walks of every-day life, to the neglect of\r\n     those duties which both human and divine law have assigned to\r\n     them. We do not stop to argue against so ridiculous a set of\r\n     ideas. We will only inquire who are to perform those duties which\r\n     we and our fathers before us have imagined belonged solely to\r\n     women. Is the world to be depopulated? Are there to be no more\r\n     children? Or are we to adopt the French mode, which is too well\r\n     known to need explanation?\r\n\r\n     Another reason why we will not answer the logic which is poured\r\n     out from the lips of such persons as Lucy Stone, Mrs. Mott, Mrs.\r\n     Amelia Bloomer, and their male coadjutors, Greeley, Garrison,\r\n     Oliver, Johnson, Burleigh, and others, is because they themselves\r\n     do not believe in the truth or feasibility of the doctrines they\r\n     utter. In some cases eccentricity is a harmless disease; but the\r\n     idiosyncrasies of these people spring from another source. They\r\n     admit the principle that fame and infamy are synonymous terms.\r\n     Disappointed in their struggle for the first, they grasp the\r\n     last, and at the same time pocket all the money they can wring\r\n     from the \"barren fools\" who can be found in any community eager\r\n     to grasp at any doctrine which is novel, no matter how outrageous\r\n     it may be. They are continually advertising from their platforms\r\n     some \"Thrilling Narrative,\" or \"Account of the Adventures of a\r\n     Fugitive,\" which may be had at the low price of one shilling\r\n     each, or eight dollars per hundred. Recently they have discovered\r\n     that the great body of their audiences came only to be amused,\r\n     and they have therefore imposed an admission fee. Lucy Stone, who\r\n     is a shrewd Yankee, has gone a step further, and in her\r\n     management of the business of the \"Woman's Rights Convention,\"\r\n     has provided for season tickets, to be had at \"the extremely low\r\n     price of two shillings.\"\r\n\r\n     It is almost needless for us to say that these women are entirely\r\n     devoid of personal attractions. They are generally thin maiden\r\n     ladies, or women who perhaps have been disappointed in their\r\n     endeavors to appropriate the breeches and the rights of their\r\n     unlucky lords; the first class having found it utterly impossible\r\n     to induce any young or old man into the matrimonial noose, have\r\n     turned out upon the world, and are now endeavoring to revenge\r\n     themselves upon the sex who have slighted them. The second,\r\n     having been dethroned from their empire over the hearts of their\r\n     husbands, for reasons which may easily be imagined, go\r\n     vagabondizing over the country, boring unfortunate audiences with\r\n     long essays lacking point or meaning, and amusing only from the\r\n     impudence displayed by the speakers in putting them forth in a\r\n     civilized country. They violate the rules of decency and taste by\r\n     attiring themselves in eccentric habiliments, which hang loosely\r\n     and inelegantly upon their forms, making that which we have been\r\n     educated to respect, to love, and to admire, only an object of\r\n     aversion and disgust. A few of these unfortunate women have awoke\r\n     from their momentary trance, and quickly returned to the dress of\r\n     decent society; but we saw yesterday many disciples of the\r\n     Bloomer school at the Tabernacle. There was yesterday, and there\r\n     will be to-day, a wide field for all such at the Tabernacle.\r\n\r\n     The \"compliments\" showered upon _The Herald_ by the wretched\r\n     Garrison yesterday afternoon, at the Woman's Wrong Convention,\r\n     fully show that he and his coadjutors, Greeley and the rest, are\r\n     beginning to feel the truth of our remarks during the time they\r\n     have been amusing our citizens. His insane attack shows that our\r\n     course has been the true one.\r\n\r\nTo the credit of Mr. Greeley, he made an effort to suppress the\r\ndisturbance. Raymond, of _The Times_, gave the following report:\r\n\r\n                       _Times, September 8, 1853._\r\n\r\n              (Evening of the first day, Mrs. Rose speaking).\r\n\r\n     Mr. Greeley was among the audience, and in passing through the\r\n     gallery, it was supposed he remonstrated with the sibillating\r\n     gentlemen, and a great rumpus was raised. Some cheered the\r\n     peace-maker, others hissed, the rush collected about the scene of\r\n     the disturbance, and all proceedings were interrupted. Mrs. Rose\r\n     suspended her remarks for a few moments, but presently said:\r\n     \"Friends, be seated, and I will continue.\" The audience would not\r\n     listen, however. The uproar still continued. Cries of \"Order,\"\r\n     \"Mrs. President,\" \"Put him out,\" \"Hurrah!\" hisses, groans, and\r\n     cheers. Mr. Greeley and a policeman presently succeeded in\r\n     stilling the tumult, the officer collaring several men and\r\n     compelling them to keep quiet. Mrs. Rose resumed and continued\r\n     her remarks.\r\n\r\n                SECOND DAY, MORNING SESSION, Opened at 10 A.M.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. MOTT: The uproar and confusion which attended the close of\r\n     our proceedings of last night, although much to be regretted, as\r\n     indicating an unreasonable and unreasoning disposition on the\r\n     part of some, to close their ears against the truth, or rather,\r\n     to drown its voice by vulgar clamor, yet, when viewed aright, and\r\n     in some phases, present to us matter of congratulation. I do\r\n     suppose that never, at any meeting, was public propriety more\r\n     outraged, than at ours of last evening. I suppose no transactions\r\n     of a body assembled to deliberate, were ever more outrageously\r\n     invaded by an attempt to turn them into a mere tumult; yet,\r\n     though voices were loud and angry, and the evil passions\r\n     exhibited themselves with much of that quality to affright, which\r\n     usually, if not always, attends their exhibition, not a scream\r\n     was heard from any woman, nor did any of the \"weaker sex\" exhibit\r\n     the slightest terror, or even alarm at the violent manifestations\r\n     which invaded the peace of our assemblage.\r\n\r\n     I felicitate the women on this exhibition of fortitude; of calm\r\n     moral courage. Should not our opponents, if they have any reason\r\n     among them, reflect that these exhibitions are, in reality, some\r\n     of the strongest arguments that can be offered to support the\r\n     claims which we stand here to advocate? Do they not show, on the\r\n     one hand, that men, by whom such an overpowering superiority is\r\n     arrogated, can betimes demean themselves in such a way as to show\r\n     that they are wholly unfit for the lofty functions which they\r\n     demand as their exclusive right? And, on the other hand, do they\r\n     not conclusively show, that women are possessed of, at least,\r\n     some of those qualities which assist in calmness of deliberation\r\n     during times of excitement and even danger? I think it was really\r\n     a beautiful sight to see how calm the women remained during last\r\n     evening's excitement; their self-possession I consider something\r\n     truly admirable. I know that in the tumult and noise it would\r\n     have been vain for any woman to raise her voice in an attempt to\r\n     check it. Indeed, I am satisfied the outrage was predetermined,\r\n     and I regret that the aid of the police had to be called in to\r\n     quell it. Had there been here a company of women who were taught\r\n     to rely upon others, they would, doubtless, have felt bound to\r\n     scream for \"their protectors\"; but the self-reliance displayed,\r\n     which must have its basis in a consciousness of the truth and\r\n     justice of our cause, and which kept the members of the\r\n     Convention unmoved, amid all the prevailing confusion, gives us\r\n     matter of real congratulation. Let us rejoice in this, my\r\n     friends; and let us remember, that when we have a true\r\n     cause--while our cause rests on the basis of right--we have\r\n     nothing to fear, but may go on unmoved by all these petty\r\n     circumstances, by which we may be surrounded.\r\n\r\n     Mr. BURLEIGH said: A request was made last night by some person,\r\n     I don't know who, or rather a challenge was offered, that three\r\n     good reasons should be given why women should vote. Perhaps, had\r\n     the person making this demand had this question put to him,\r\n     namely: \"What reasons are there why men should vote?\" he would\r\n     have considered them so self-evident as to make any answer\r\n     superfluous. Yet it would be found difficult, I apprehend, to\r\n     assign any reason why men should vote, which would not be found\r\n     to be an equally good one for extending the elective franchise to\r\n     women. He asked, however, why women should be allowed to take a\r\n     part in the civil government of the country. This question will,\r\n     I doubt not, be answered to-day by some one more able than\r\n     myself; and if the person who asked it be present, and open to\r\n     conviction, he will hear reasons sufficient to convince him.\r\n\r\n     Why should women vote? She should vote, first, because she has to\r\n     bear her portion of the burdens imposed by the government which\r\n     the voting makes. Is not this one reason amply sufficient for any\r\n     honest-minded man? Taxation and representation go hand in hand,\r\n     says a principle of our body politic. Is woman represented? No.\r\n     Is woman taxed? Yes. How is that? Is it consistent with the\r\n     profession; and, if there were no profession, is it right, is it\r\n     just? The burden falls equally on woman and her brother; but he\r\n     has all the power of applying it; she must bear it to the end of\r\n     the journey, and then know nothing, say nothing, as to how it is\r\n     to be disposed of. What kind of justice is that? Were woman\r\n     exempted from those burdens, why, then, the exemption would so\r\n     far be an argument on the other side; although even that would\r\n     fail on investigation, because other equally immutable principles\r\n     show that neither exemption nor representation is the condition\r\n     in which any portion of the political body should be allowed to\r\n     remain. But where there is no exemption, but a full apportionment\r\n     of the burden, and, at the same time, no representation, the\r\n     absurdity of injustice has reached its climax. (Laughter and\r\n     cheers).\r\n\r\n     In the second place, woman should vote, because she ought to be a\r\n     sharer in those benefits which government is formed to confer\r\n     upon the governed. She has property which the government must\r\n     protect, a person which it must defend, and rights which it is\r\n     bound to secure. Were the millennium arrived, were there no such\r\n     thing as selfishness on earth; were simple truth and justice the\r\n     prominent elements in all men's minds, and the guiding spirit of\r\n     all men's actions, then indeed might woman confide herself to\r\n     man; then might she rely on him to secure those governmental\r\n     benefits which are her due, as a portion of the general\r\n     community. But is this the state of things? Alas! not yet; and,\r\n     until it is, the horrible injustice of the laws which exclude\r\n     woman from a share in making them, while they are her only\r\n     security for the advantages she ought to enjoy, will never cease\r\n     crying aloud to all men for purification. One of the great aims\r\n     of all government, one of the strong considerations which alone\r\n     makes its restrictions endurable, is the assurance which it gives\r\n     the governed, that the sum of their happiness, and even of their\r\n     liberty, shall, by individual restraints, become greater on the\r\n     whole. It holds out a bonus to society, or rather, to its\r\n     individual members, \"Give me this little, and I will give you in\r\n     exchange this much.\" Thus each individual puts a stake into the\r\n     common fund, has an interest in the common weal, which demands\r\n     careful watching. Can woman watch the large, the all-absorbing\r\n     interest she has at stake? She, above all, the most tender, the\r\n     most sensitive of beings, the most keenly alive to wrong, to\r\n     insult, to oppression, to aught that bruises her womanly nature,\r\n     can she give a careful eye to the disposal of those important\r\n     questions which touch the very core of her heart? Why, when\r\n     reduced to these, its naked dimensions, the injustice seems so\r\n     horrible, as not to be credible, and did we not know the facts,\r\n     we would find it hard to believe that man, made in the image of\r\n     his Maker, could violate justice so barbarously. Surely woman\r\n     lies under no moral obligation to any laws which, wanting her\r\n     assent, yet assume to control her every action, word, and even\r\n     thought. Her property, her person, all her rights, her most\r\n     sacred affections, come within the province of those enactments;\r\n     yet she can have no voice, no weight in determining what those\r\n     enactments shall be. (Stamping and groans).\r\n\r\n     In the third place, woman is entitled to vote, because she is\r\n     liable to all the penalties imposed by government. Not only is it\r\n     that she confides, or rather, that government compels her to\r\n     confide to it, the custody of person, property, rights, and all\r\n     dearest interests, but it goes a step further, and thus adds\r\n     another link (though quite a superfluous one) to the adamantine\r\n     chain of argument which it supplies to bind down its own\r\n     injustice. It stands not merely in a passive or receiving\r\n     relation to woman, it becomes the active arbiter of her doom; it\r\n     declares itself competent to lay hands on her, to shut her up in\r\n     prison, to take away her life, the life of one who has made with\r\n     it no compact--giving such awful power--the life of one who never\r\n     consented to the laws which assert over her so terrible a\r\n     supremacy! All the principles already applied come in here with\r\n     perhaps renewed force, as being the arbiters of a question which\r\n     may be regarded by some as of a still more absorbing interest,\r\n     although to woman it may not be so, for when did she value life\r\n     more highly than tenderness, domestic confidence, and affection?\r\n     (Prolonged laughter).\r\n\r\n     Dr. H. K. ROOT, of New York, rose in his place among the audience\r\n     and declared his intention of arguing against the principles and\r\n     demands of the Convention. Being requested to take the rostrum,\r\n     he did so, and spoke thus:\r\n\r\n     Mrs. President and Ladies: I do not come here with the slightest\r\n     intention of offering to the ladies any opposition for mere\r\n     opposition's sake. If they are proved to have more knowledge and\r\n     intelligence than men, let them govern! My purpose, ladies, is to\r\n     try and attain truth, which, I think, will not be found favorable\r\n     to the views you express. I come, rather, as a matter of\r\n     intelligence than opposition. I do not come here for the purpose\r\n     of opposing the ladies too much; but as the question was not only\r\n     open yesterday, but still is for discussion, I maintain that if\r\n     the ladies have more intelligence, and more energy, and science\r\n     than the male sex, they should rule. I think I can give three\r\n     reasons why men should vote, and one why woman should not vote.\r\n     (Cheers).\r\n\r\n     My first reason is, because there was an original command from\r\n     God that man should rule. It may be supposed that we are in the\r\n     garden of Eden now, as in the days of Adam and Eve. Now, it will\r\n     be remembered, when Adam and Eve fell, Adam, because Eve tempted\r\n     him, was placed in the garden as its keeper, and it was necessary\r\n     in those days, as it is now, that woman should be a helpmeet for\r\n     him; but you recollect that by the eating of the forbidden fruit,\r\n     original sin came into the world. What was the expression of God\r\n     to Adam? He says in the third chapter of Genesis, 17th verse:\r\n     \"Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast\r\n     eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, thou shalt\r\n     not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt\r\n     thou eat of it all the days of thy life.\" Now, permit us to be in\r\n     the relation that Adam and Eve were originally. It behooves the\r\n     male sex to answer the objections of the female sex--not that we\r\n     wish to combat them in public; but it behooves us, as a matter of\r\n     justice, to put the question on a right foundation. It may be\r\n     necessary, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, that the ladies\r\n     should be here, but in the hundredth it may be necessary that man\r\n     should say, \"Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther.\" You see the\r\n     original cause of sin was because man, being placed in the\r\n     garden, gave way to woman, and the curse fell upon him; the\r\n     original cause of sin was because man gave up his judgment to\r\n     woman; and it may be, if we now give up our rights to woman, some\r\n     great calamity may fall upon us. Had woman only sinned, perhaps\r\n     we might still have been in Eden. (Great applause).\r\n\r\n     My second reason why man should vote is the law of physical force\r\n     over the woman--because man's strength is greater than woman's.\r\n\r\n     The third reason is, because if women enter the field of\r\n     competition with men, it may lead not only to domestic\r\n     unhappiness, but a great many other ill feelings. And I will give\r\n     another reason why men should be dictators. If woman says she\r\n     shall vote, and man says she sha'n't, he is in duty bound to\r\n     maintain what he says. If he says she sha'n't, that is reason\r\n     enough why she should not.\" (Cheers and laughter).\r\n\r\n     ALEXANDER PARKER, of Philadelphia, rose in his place, and on\r\n     being invited to the platform, spoke thus:\r\n\r\n     Adam was the first gardener in the world; he belonged to my\r\n     business, for I am a gardener--a business I took up myself, so I\r\n     should have something to say about the garden of Eden. Well, I\r\n     have often thought about the fall, and I have often pictured it\r\n     in this manner: the very moment the charge was given not to do\r\n     such a thing, that was just the time they wanted to do it.\r\n     (Prolonged cheers).\r\n\r\n     It is often said that woman has a great deal of curiosity, and no\r\n     doubt it was whispered into her ear, that the moment she ate of\r\n     the forbidden fruit she should become a god. Now, I have seen\r\n     more reason this morning why women should vote than I have ever\r\n     seen before. In Pennsylvania a man has got but one vote, while a\r\n     woman has three--her husband's and her two sons'. Eve tried to\r\n     get over the temptation, but she could not; and so, after many\r\n     efforts, she clutched the apple she looked at so, and so, and she\r\n     reached out to it; afraid at first, but at last she laid hold of\r\n     it, and, seeing that her fear was over, she kissed its lovely\r\n     cheek. Then she ran to Adam, and said it was good, and he ate of\r\n     it. Then his eyes were opened and he saw he was naked, and ran\r\n     and hid himself. He tried to hide himself among the bushes, but\r\n     he could not deny the eating of it, because the core was sticking\r\n     in his throat, and it is sticking there still; but woman has not\r\n     got the core sticking in her throat. Well, Adam pretended to be\r\n     innocent, like all the rest of mankind, and said it was not he,\r\n     but the woman that did it. No, no; it was not his fault, it was\r\n     the woman who gave it to him. Oh, yes! he was not to blame, no\r\n     more than any lord of creation. Well, then, there was a curse\r\n     upon him; but there was a promise to woman that her seed should\r\n     bruise the head of the serpent with her heel. (Shouts of\r\n     laughter).\r\n\r\n     Mrs. NICHOLS: As to the text which says that woman must obey her\r\n     husband, surely that is no reason why she should obey all the\r\n     bachelors and other women's husbands in the community. My husband\r\n     would have me advocate the claims I do, therefore by the logic of\r\n     our cause my husband wishes me to vote, and, according to the\r\n     Scripture, the gentleman must, even in his own reasoning, allow\r\n     me the right to vote. In one place the gentleman said that woman\r\n     had already turned the world over; and that man must be cautious\r\n     not to allow her to do so again. Perhaps, if he reconsidered\r\n     these statements he might be willing to retract the latter;\r\n     because, if she turned the world over once and put the wrong side\r\n     up, he ought now to allow her to turn it back, that she may bring\r\n     the right side up again.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ROSE said: As to the personal property, after all debts and\r\n     liabilities are discharged, the widow receives one-half of it;\r\n     and, in addition, the law kindly allows her her own wearing\r\n     apparel, her own ornaments, proper to her station, one bed, with\r\n     appurtenances for the same; a stove, the Bible, family pictures,\r\n     and all the school-books; also, all spinning-wheels and\r\n     weaving-looms, one table, six chairs, tea cups and saucers, one\r\n     tea-pot, one sugar dish, and six spoons. (Much laughter). But the\r\n     law does not inform us whether they are to be tea or table\r\n     spoons; nor does the law make any provision for kettles,\r\n     sauce-pans, and all such necessary things. But the presumption\r\n     seems to be that the spoons meant are teaspoons; for, as ladies\r\n     are generally considered very delicate, the law presumed that a\r\n     widow might live on tea only; but spinning-wheels and\r\n     weaving-looms are very necessary articles for ladies nowadays.\r\n     (Hissing and great confusion). Why, you need not hiss, for I am\r\n     expounding the law. These wise law-makers, who seem to have lived\r\n     somewhere about the time of the flood, did not dream of spinning\r\n     and weaving by steam-power. When our great-great-grandmothers had\r\n     to weave every article of apparel worn by the family, it was, no\r\n     doubt, considered a very good law to allow the widow the\r\n     possession of the spinning-wheels and the weaving-looms. But,\r\n     unfortunately for some laws, man is a progressive being; his\r\n     belief, opinions, habits, manners, and customs change, and so do\r\n     spinning-wheels and weaving-looms; and, with men and things, law\r\n     must change too, for what is the value of a law when man has\r\n     outgrown it? As well might you bring him to the use of his baby\r\n     clothes, because they once fitted him, as to keep him to such a\r\n     law. No. Laws, when man has outgrown them, are fit only to be\r\n     cast aside among the things that were.\r\n\r\n     But I must not forget, the law allows the widow something more.\r\n     She is allowed one cow, all sheep to the number of ten, with the\r\n     fleeces and the cloth from the same, two swine, and the pork\r\n     therefrom. (Great laughter). My friends, do not say that I stand\r\n     here to make these laws ridiculous. No; if you laugh, it is at\r\n     their own inherent ludicrousness; for I state them simply and\r\n     truly as they are; for they are so ridiculous in themselves, that\r\n     it is impossible to make them more so.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. NICHOLS said: As widow, too, the law bears heavily on woman.\r\n     If her children have property, she is adjudged unworthy of their\r\n     guardianship; and although the decree of God has made her the\r\n     true and natural guardian of her children, she is obliged to pay\r\n     from her scanty means to be constituted so by law.\r\n\r\n     I have conversed with judges and legislators, and tried to learn\r\n     a reason for these things, but failed to find it. A noble man\r\n     once gave me what he probably thought was a good one. \"Women,\" he\r\n     said to me, \"can not earn as much as men!\" We say they should be\r\n     allowed to earn as much. They have the ability, and the means\r\n     should not be shut out from them. I have heard of another man who\r\n     held woman's industrial ability at a low rate. \"His wife,\" he\r\n     said, \"had never been able to do anything but attend to her\r\n     children.\" \"How many have you?\" he was asked; and the answer was,\r\n     \"Nine.\" Nine children to attend to! nine children cared for! and\r\n     she could do nothing more, the wife of this most reasonable man.\r\n     Now, which is of more importance to the community, the property\r\n     which that reasonable husband made, or the nine children whom\r\n     that mother brought, with affectionate and tender toil, through\r\n     the perils of infancy and youth, until they were men and women?\r\n     Which was of more importance to this land, the property which the\r\n     father of George Washington amassed, or the George Washington\r\n     whom a noble mother gave to his country? The name of Washington,\r\n     his glorious deeds, and the enduring benefits he secured for us,\r\n     still remain, and will long after the estates of Washington have\r\n     passed from his name forever!\r\n\r\n     In the State of Vermont, a wife sought a divorce from her husband\r\n     on the ground of his intemperance. They were persons moving among\r\n     our highest circles--wealthy people; and the wife knew that she\r\n     could, through the aid of her friends and relations, with the\r\n     influence and sympathy of the community, obtain a divorce and a\r\n     support for her children. That father carried away into Canada\r\n     one child, a little girl, and paid three hundred dollars to a\r\n     low, vile Frenchman, that he might keep her from her mother and\r\n     friends. Three times her almost heart-broken mother went in\r\n     search of her; twice in vain, but the third time she was found.\r\n     So badly had the poor child been treated in the vile hands in\r\n     which her father had placed her, that, when recovered, she was\r\n     almost insensible; and when, by her mother's nursing care, her\r\n     intelligence was at length restored, her joy at seeing her mother\r\n     was so violent, that it was feared its excess might prove fatal.\r\n     The case came into court, and the judge decided that the two\r\n     daughters should be given to their mother, but that the custody\r\n     of the son should be given to the father. She was acquitted of\r\n     the least impropriety or indiscretion; yet, though the obscenity\r\n     and profanity of her husband in his own family was shocking, and\r\n     it was in the last degree painful to that high-minded woman to\r\n     see her son brought up under the charge of such a man, the law\r\n     decided that the unworthy father was the more proper guardian for\r\n     the boy!\r\n\r\n     In the Green Mountain State a great many sermons have lately been\r\n     preached on the text, \"Wives, submit yourselves to your\r\n     husbands.\" The remaining words, \"in the Lord,\" are generally\r\n     omitted; so that the text is made to appear like an injunction\r\n     that the wives should submit to their husbands, whether they were\r\n     in the Lord or in the devil. And the best of all is, that we are\r\n     told that if we would be submissive, we could change our husbands\r\n     from devils into angels.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. MOTT: I now introduce to the Convention Frances Dana Gage,\r\n     of St. Louis, Mo., better known as \"Aunt Fanny,\" the poet.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. GAGE said: This morning, when I was leaving my\r\n     boarding-house, some one said to me, \"So you are ready armed and\r\n     equipped to go and fight the men.\" I was sorry, truly sorry, to\r\n     hear the words--they fell heavily on my heart. I have no fight\r\n     with men. I am a daughter, a sister, a wife, and a mother, and in\r\n     all these relations I live in harmony with man. Neither I, nor\r\n     any of the sisters with whom I am united in this movement, have\r\n     any quarrel with men. What is it that we oppose? What do we seek\r\n     to overturn? The bad laws and customs of society. These are our\r\n     only enemies, and against these alone is our hostility directed;\r\n     although they be \"hallowed by time,\" we seek to eradicate them,\r\n     because the day for which they were suited, if such ever existed,\r\n     is long since gone by. The men, we may suppose, are above and\r\n     beyond the laws, and we assail the laws only.\r\n\r\n     There is one law which I do not remember having heard any of my\r\n     sisters touch upon, that is the Law of Wills, as far as it\r\n     relates to married women, and as far as it allows a husband\r\n     (which it fully does), along with his power to determine the lot\r\n     of his wife while he is alive, also to control her when he is\r\n     dead. Would any gentleman like to have that law reversed? Let me\r\n     read to you a will after that odd fashion. It will fall on your\r\n     ears, gentlemen, with as loud a tone of injustice as it does on\r\n     mine:\r\n\r\n     WILL OF BRIDGET SMITH.--In the name of God, amen. I, Bridget\r\n     Smith, being weak in body, though sound in mind, blessed be God\r\n     for the same, do make and declare this my last will and\r\n     testament. Item first: I give my soul to God, and my body to the\r\n     earth, from which it came. Item second: I give to my beloved\r\n     husband, John Smith, Sen., my Bible, and forty acres of wild land\r\n     which I own in Bear Marsh, Ill, for the term of his natural life,\r\n     when it shall descend to our son, John Smith, Jr. Item third: I\r\n     give and bequeath to my daughter, Tabitha, my farm, house,\r\n     outhouse, barns, and all the stock on said farm, situated in\r\n     Pleasant Valley, and which said farm consists of 160 acres. I\r\n     also give to my said daughter Tabitha, the wagons, carriages,\r\n     harnesses, carts, plows, and all other property that shall be on\r\n     said farm at the time of my death. Item fourth: I give to my son,\r\n     John Smith, Jr., my family horse, my buggy, harness, and saddle,\r\n     and also eighty acres of wild land which I own in the State of\r\n     Iowa, for which I have a patent. Item fifth: I give to my beloved\r\n     husband, John Smith, Sen., the use of the house in which we live,\r\n     together with my bed, so long as he shall live, or remain my\r\n     widower; but in case he shall die, or get married, then it is my\r\n     will that my house and bed shall descend to my said daughter,\r\n     Tabitha. Recommending my said husband to her care, whom I make\r\n     the sole executrix of this my last will and testament, hereby\r\n     revoking all others.\r\n\r\n     Signed, sealed, and proclaimed this ---- day of ----, 1853, in\r\n     the presence of John Doe and Richard Roe.\r\n\r\n                                             BRIDGET SMITH.\r\n\r\n     Would any of you like such power as that to be placed in our\r\n     hands? Yet, is it not as fair that married women should dispose\r\n     of their property, as that married men should dispose of theirs?\r\n     It is true, the power thus given to husbands is not always used\r\n     to the detriment of women, and this is frequently urged in\r\n     support of the law. But I reply, that law is made for extreme\r\n     cases; and while any such statutes remain on the books, no good\r\n     man will cease to exert himself for their removal. I ask the\r\n     right to vote, not because it would create antagonism, but\r\n     because it would create harmony. I want to do away with\r\n     antagonism by removing oppression, for where oppression exists,\r\n     there antagonism must exist also.\r\n\r\n     ERNESTINE L. ROSE: In allusion to the law respecting wills, I\r\n     wish to say that, according to the Revised Statutes of our State,\r\n     a married woman has not a right to make a will. The law says that\r\n     wills may be made by all persons, except idiots, persons of\r\n     unsound mind, married women, and infants. Mark well, all but\r\n     idiots, lunatics, married women, and infants. Male infants ought\r\n     to consider it quite an insult to be placed in the same category\r\n     with married women. No, a married woman has no right to bequeath\r\n     a dollar of the property, no matter how much she may have brought\r\n     into the marriage, or accumulated in it. Not a dollar to a\r\n     friend, a relative, or even to her own child, to keep him from\r\n     starving. And this is the law in the nineteenth century, in the\r\n     enlightened United States, under a Republic that declares all men\r\n     to be free and equal.\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE: Just one word. I think Mrs. Rose is a little\r\n     mistaken; I wish to correct her by saying that of some States\r\n     in--\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ROSE: I did not say this was the universal law; I said it\r\n     was the law in the State of New York.\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE: I was not paying close attention, and must have been\r\n     mistaken. In Massachusetts the law makes a married woman's will\r\n     valid in two cases: the first is, where the consent of her\r\n     husband is written on the will; the second, where she wills all\r\n     she has to her husband, in which case his written consent is not\r\n     deemed requisite.\r\n\r\n     Dr. HARRIOT K. HUNT spoke on the fruitful theme of taxation\r\n     without representation! and read her annual protest[120] to the\r\n     authorities of Boston against being compelled to submit to that\r\n     injustice. She said: I wish to vote, that women may have, by law,\r\n     an equal right with men in property. In October, 1851, I went to\r\n     pay my taxes in Boston. Going into the Assessor's office, I saw a\r\n     tall, thin, weak, stupid-looking Irish boy. It was near election\r\n     time, and I looked at him scrutinizingly. He held in his hand a\r\n     document, which, I found on inquiry, was one of naturalization;\r\n     and this hopeful son of Erin was made a citizen of the United\r\n     States, and he could have a voice in determining the destinies of\r\n     this mighty nation, while thousands of intellectual women,\r\n     daughters of the soil, no matter how intelligent, how\r\n     respectable, or what amount of taxes they paid, were forced to be\r\n     dumb!\r\n\r\n     Now, I am glad to pay my taxes, am glad that my profession\r\n     enables me to pay them; but I would like very much to have a\r\n     voice in directing what is to be done with the money I pay. I\r\n     meditated on what I had seen, and, in 1852, when paying my taxes,\r\n     I took to the Treasurer's office my protest.\r\n\r\nThe case of the Hon. Mrs. Norton before the English courts, then\r\nattracting much attention, was a fair exemplification of the injustice\r\nof the law to married women.\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE said: I have before me, in a newspaper, a case which\r\n     shows strongly the necessity for woman's legislating for herself.\r\n     I mean the case of the Hon. Mrs. Norton, which lately transpired\r\n     in a court in London, and which fully proves that it is never\r\n     right for one class to legislate for another. There are,\r\n     probably, few here who have not been made better and wiser by the\r\n     beautiful things which have fallen from the pen of that lady. In\r\n     1836 her husband obtained a separation from her on the charge of\r\n     infidelity. Eighteen years of a blameless life since, and the\r\n     conviction every pure mind must feel, that nothing impure could\r\n     ever dwell in a mind such as her productions show hers to be,\r\n     will fully relieve her of any suspicion that she ever was guilty\r\n     of acts justifying that charge. She was a woman of transcendent\r\n     abilities; and her works brought her in £1,000 a year--sometimes\r\n     more, sometimes less. This her husband procured to be paid over\r\n     to himself, by securing the profits of her copyrights; and this\r\n     husband allowed her only £400 a year! and, at last, refused to\r\n     pay her even this sum; so that, for her necessary expenses, she\r\n     was obliged to go into debt, and her debtors brought a suit\r\n     against her husband, which was taken into court. In the court she\r\n     stood before her husband's lawyer, and said to him: \"If you are\r\n     afraid of what I may say, beware how you ask me questions!\"\r\n     Wealth and power were against her, and the lawyer _did_ ask\r\n     questions which wrung from her what she had concealed for\r\n     seventeen long years, and the world at last knew how her husband\r\n     had kept the money she earned by her pen. She stood in court, and\r\n     said: \"I do not ask for rights; I have no rights, I have only\r\n     wrongs. I will go abroad, and live with my son.\" Her husband had\r\n     proposed to take her children from her, but she said: \"I would\r\n     rather starve than give them up.\" And for a time she did starve.\r\n     I will read for you her poem of \"Twilight,\" and you will all see\r\n     what kind of woman has been so wronged, and has so suffered.\r\n\r\n     That woman, gifted, noble, and wealthy, with such great yearnings\r\n     in her soul, whose heart was so bound up in her children, was\r\n     thus robbed not only of her own rights, but also of theirs. Men!\r\n     we can not trust you! You have deceived us too long! Since this\r\n     movement began, _some_ laws have been passed, securing to woman\r\n     her personal property, but they are as nothing in the great\r\n     reform that is needed. I can tell you a case. A woman married a\r\n     man, whom she did not love, because he had a fortune. He died,\r\n     and she married the man whom she loved before her first marriage.\r\n     He died, too, and the fortune which was hers through her first\r\n     husband was seized on by the relatives of the second, and she was\r\n     left penniless in the wide world. Here, as in England, women earn\r\n     large sums by their literary fame and talents; and I know a _man_\r\n     who watches the post-office, and, because the Law gives him the\r\n     power, secures the letters which contain the wages of his wife's\r\n     intellectual toil, and pockets them for his own use.\r\n\r\n     I will conclude by reading a letter from an esteemed friend, Mr.\r\n     Higginson. It proposes certain questions which I should wish to\r\n     hear our enemies answer.\r\n\r\n                                        WORCESTER, _Sept. 4, 1853_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR FRIEND:--You are aware that domestic duties alone prevent my\r\n     prolonging my stay in New York during the session of the Woman's\r\n     Rights Convention. But you know, also, that all my sympathies are\r\n     there. I hope you will have a large representation of the friends\r\n     of the great movement--the most important of the century; and\r\n     that you will also assemble a good many of the opposition during\r\n     the discussion. Perhaps from such opponents I might obtain\r\n     answers to certain questions which have harassed my mind, and are\r\n     the following:\r\n\r\n     If there be a woman's sphere, as a man's sphere, why has not\r\n     woman an equal voice in fixing the limits? If it be unwomanly for\r\n     a girl to have a whole education, why is it not unwomanly for her\r\n     to have even a half one? Should she not be left where the Turkish\r\n     women are left? If women have sufficient political influence\r\n     through their husbands and brothers, how is it that the worst\r\n     laws are confessedly those relating to female property? If\r\n     politics are necessarily corrupting, ought not good men, as well\r\n     as good women, to be exhorted to quit voting?\r\n\r\n     If, however, man's theory be correct--that none should be\r\n     appointed jurors but those whose occupations fit them to\r\n     understand the matters in dispute--where is the propriety of\r\n     empanneling a jury of men to decide on the right of a divorced\r\n     mother to her child? If it be proper for a woman to open her lips\r\n     in jubilee to sing nonsense, how can it be improper for her to\r\n     open them and speak sense? These afford a sample of the questions\r\n     to which I have been trying in vain to find an answer. If the\r\n     reasonings of men on this subject are a fair specimen of the\r\n     masculine intellect of the nineteenth century, I think it is\r\n     certainly quite time to call in women to do the thinking.\r\n\r\n                              Yours, respectfully and cordially,\r\n                                                  T. W. HIGGINSON.\r\n     MISS LUCY STONE.\r\n\r\n     MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE cited the Convention to a case recently tried\r\n     before the Court of Common Pleas of New York, as illustrating the\r\n     husband's ownership of the wife, the Court deciding that the\r\n     friends of a woman who had \"harbored\" and detained her from her\r\n     husband, though with her own consent and desire, should pay him\r\n     $10,000. He recovered this sum on the principle of ownership; the\r\n     wife's services were due him, and he recovered their value.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Gage also commented on the divorce laws, which she declared\r\n     were less just in Christian than in Mohammedan countries. In\r\n     those countries if the husband sues for a divorce he is obliged\r\n     to restore the dower, but in Christian America the husband not\r\n     only retains all the property in case he sues for a divorce, but\r\n     where the wife, being the innocent party, sues, she even then\r\n     receives neither property nor children, unless by an express\r\n     decree of the court. She is alike punished, whether innocent or\r\n     guilty. Mrs. Gage also discussed the question so often put, \"What\r\n     has woman to do with politics?\" She said the country must look to\r\n     women for its salvation.\r\n\r\nSojourner Truth, a tall colored woman, well known in anti-slavery\r\ncircles, and called the Lybian Sybil, made her appearance on the\r\nplatform. This was the signal for a fresh outburst from the mob; for\r\nat every session every man of them was promptly in his place, at\r\ntwenty-five cents a head. And this was the one redeeming feature of\r\nthis mob--it paid all expenses, and left a surplus in the treasury.\r\nSojourner combined in herself, as an individual, the two most hated\r\nelements of humanity. She was black, and she was a woman, and all the\r\ninsults that could be cast upon color and sex were together hurled at\r\nher; but there she stood, calm and dignified, a grand, wise woman, who\r\ncould neither read nor write, and yet with deep insight could\r\npenetrate the very soul of the universe about her. As soon as the\r\nterrible turmoil was in a measure quelled\r\n\r\n     SHE SAID: Is it not good for me to come and draw forth a spirit,\r\n     to see what kind of spirit people are of? I see that some of you\r\n     have got the spirit of a goose, and some have got the spirit of a\r\n     snake. I feel at home here. I come to you, citizens of New York,\r\n     as I suppose you ought to be. I am a citizen of the State of New\r\n     York; I was born in it, and I was a slave in the State of New\r\n     York; and now I am a good citizen of this State. I was born here,\r\n     and I can tell you I feel at home here. I've been lookin' round\r\n     and watchin' things, and I know a little mite 'bout Woman's\r\n     Rights, too. I come forth to speak 'bout Woman's Rights, and want\r\n     to throw in my little mite, to keep the scales a-movin'. I know\r\n     that it feels a kind o' hissin' and ticklin' like to see a\r\n     colored woman get up and tell you about things, and Woman's\r\n     Rights. We have all been thrown down so low that nobody thought\r\n     we'd ever get up again; but we have been long enough trodden now;\r\n     we will come up again, and now I am here.\r\n\r\n     I was a-thinkin', when I see women contendin' for their rights, I\r\n     was a-thinkin' what a difference there is now, and what there was\r\n     in old times. I have only a few minutes to speak; but in the old\r\n     times the kings of the earth would hear a woman. There was a\r\n     king in the Scriptures; and then it was the kings of the earth\r\n     would kill a woman if she come into their presence; but Queen\r\n     Esther come forth, for she was oppressed, and felt there was a\r\n     great wrong, and she said I will die or I will bring my complaint\r\n     before the king. Should the king of the United States be greater,\r\n     or more crueler, or more harder? But the king, he raised up his\r\n     sceptre and said: \"Thy request shall be granted unto thee--to the\r\n     half of my kingdom will I grant it to thee!\" Then he said he\r\n     would hang Haman on the gallows he had made up high. But that is\r\n     not what women come forward to contend. The women want their\r\n     rights as Esther. She only wanted to explain her rights. And he\r\n     was so liberal that he said, \"the half of my kingdom shall be\r\n     granted to thee,\" and he did not wait for her to ask, he was so\r\n     liberal with her.\r\n\r\n     Now, women do not ask half of a kingdom, but their rights, and\r\n     they don't get 'em. When she comes to demand 'em, don't you hear\r\n     how sons hiss their mothers like snakes, because they ask for\r\n     their rights; and can they ask for anything less? The king\r\n     ordered Haman to be hung on the gallows which he prepared to hang\r\n     others; but I do not want any man to be killed, but I am sorry to\r\n     see them so short-minded. But we'll have our rights; see if we\r\n     don't; and you can't stop us from them; see if you can. You may\r\n     hiss as much as you like, but it is comin'. Women don't get half\r\n     as much rights as they ought to; we want more, and we will have\r\n     it. Jesus says: \"What I say to one, I say to all--watch!\" I'm\r\n     a-watehin'. God says: \"Honor your father and your mother.\" Sons\r\n     and daughters ought to behave themselves before their mothers,\r\n     but they do not. I can see them a-laughin', and pointin' at their\r\n     mothers up here on the stage. They hiss when an aged woman comes\r\n     forth. If they'd been brought up proper they'd have known better\r\n     than hissing like snakes and geese. I'm 'round watchin' these\r\n     things, and I wanted to come up and say these few things to you,\r\n     and I'm glad of the hearin' you give me. I wanted to tell you a\r\n     mite about Woman's Rights, and so I came out and said so. I am\r\n     sittin' among you to watch; and every once and awhile I will come\r\n     out and tell you what time of night it is.\r\n\r\n_The Times_ next day commented as follows:\r\n\r\n                _The New York Times, Sept. 9, 1853._\r\n\r\n     THE ROW OF YESTERDAY.--Row No. 3 was a very jolly affair, a\r\n     regular break-down, at the Woman's Convention. The women had\r\n     their rights, and more beside. The cause was simply that the\r\n     rowdyish diathesis is just now prevalent. True, a colored woman\r\n     made a speech, but there was nothing in that to excite a\r\n     multitude; she did not speak too low to be heard; she did not\r\n     insult them with improper language; nor did the audience respond\r\n     at all insultingly. They did not curse, they only called for\r\n     \"half a dozen on the shell.\" They did not swear, they only\r\n     \"hurried up that stew.\" They did wrong, however.\r\n\r\n     If we had our own way every rascally rowdy among them should have\r\n     Bloomers of all colors preaching at them by the year--a year for\r\n     every naughty word they uttered, a score of them for every hiss.\r\n     Out upon the villains who go to any meeting to disturb it. Let\r\n     anybody who can hire a house and pay for it have his way, and let\r\n     none be disturbed; the opposers can stay away. But for us, let us\r\n     be thankful that in such hot weather there is something to amuse\r\n     us, something to season our insipid dishes, something to spice\r\n     our dull days with. _Mem._ It was cooler in the evening.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     CAROLINE M. SEVERANCE, of Ohio, presented an argument and appeal\r\n     based upon the following propositions: That as the manifest\r\n     dissimilarities which cause the _nations_ of the earth to differ,\r\n     physically, and in degree of mental and moral development and\r\n     cultivation, are not found justly to invalidate their claim to a\r\n     place in the vast brotherhood of man--to fullness of family\r\n     communion and rights; so there are no radical differences of _the\r\n     sexes_ in these respects, which can at all impair the integrity\r\n     of an equal humanity--no sufficient basis for a distinction in so\r\n     comprehensive a classification.\r\n\r\n     The fundamental facts and faculties--the higher and more\r\n     essential attributes which make up the accepted definition of\r\n     humanity in our day, are identical in both--are no more confined\r\n     or unduly allotted to one sex than to one nation.\r\n\r\n     On the broad basis of this philosophy, on the ground of woman's\r\n     undeniable and equal humanity, proven by the possession of\r\n     identical human faculties, and equal human needs, we claim for\r\n     her the recognition of that humanity and its rights--for the\r\n     freedom, protection, development, and use of those faculties, and\r\n     the supply of those needs. And we maintain that no accident of\r\n     sex, no prejudged or proven dissimilarity _in degree_ of\r\n     physical, mental, or moral endowment, or development, can at all\r\n     stand in the way of the admission of such just claim; and no\r\n     denial of such claim but must necessarily be fraught with evil,\r\n     as subversive of the Creator's economy and design. [Shouts and\r\n     laughter.]\r\n\r\n     Rev. JOHN PIERPONT, who, for the first time, took part in a\r\n     Woman's Rights Convention, said: Ladies and gentlemen, a woman,\r\n     at this hour, occupies the throne of the mightiest kingdom of the\r\n     globe. Under her sway there are some hundred and fifty millions\r\n     of the human race. Has she a right to sit there? [Several voices,\r\n     \"No!\"] The vote here is--no; but a hundred and fifty millions\r\n     vote the contrary. If a woman can thus have the highest right\r\n     conceded to her, why should not woman have a lower? Therefore,\r\n     some women have some rights. Is not the question a fair one,--how\r\n     many women have any rights? And, also, how many rights has any\r\n     woman? Are not these fair subjects for discussion? I do not come\r\n     here to advocate any specific right for women; I come merely for\r\n     the consideration of the question, what right she has. What are\r\n     the rights which can not rightfully be denied her? Surely, some\r\n     belong to the sex at large, as part of the great family of man.\r\n     We lay it, down as the foundation of our civil theory, that man,\r\n     as man, has, and by nature is endowed with certain natural,\r\n     inviolable, indefeasible rights; not that men who have attained\r\n     the age of majority alone possess those rights; not that the\r\n     older, the young, the fair, or the dark, are alone endowed with\r\n     them; but that they belong to _all_. The rights are not of man's\r\n     giving; God gave them; and if you deny or withhold them, you\r\n     place yourself in antagonism with your Creator. The more humble\r\n     and despised is the human being claiming those rights, the more\r\n     prompt should be the feeling of every manly bosom to stand by\r\n     that humble creature of God, and see that its right is not\r\n     withheld from it! Is it a new thing in this country to allow\r\n     civil rights to a woman?\r\n\r\nSusan B. Anthony, who had been a teacher for fifteen years, gave an\r\namusing description of her recent experience in attempting to speak at\r\na teachers' convention. Paulina Wright Davis offered the following\r\nresolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That inasmuch as this great movement is intended to\r\n     meet the wants, not of America only, but of the whole world, a\r\n     committee be appointed to prepare an address from this Convention\r\n     to the women of Great Britain and the continent of Europe,\r\n     setting forth our objects, and inviting their co-operation in the\r\n     same.[121]\r\n\r\n     WM. LLOYD GARRISON: I second the resolution, because it shows the\r\n     universality of our enterprise. I second it heartily, for it\r\n     manifests the grandeur of the object we are pursuing. There never\r\n     yet was a struggle for liberty which was not universal, though,\r\n     for the time, it might have appeared to be no more than local. If\r\n     the women of this country have to obtain rights which have been\r\n     denied them, the women of England, of France, of the world, have\r\n     to obtain the same; and I regard this as a struggle for the race,\r\n     sublime as the world itself. It is right that this Convention\r\n     should address the women of the whole world, in order that they\r\n     should announce precisely how they regard their own position in\r\n     the universe of God. What rights they claim are God-given; what\r\n     rights they possess, and what rights they have still to achieve.\r\n     It is time that the women of America should ask the women beyond\r\n     the Atlantic to consider their own condition, and to co-operate\r\n     with them in the same glorious struggle. There is not an argument\r\n     that God ever permitted a human being to frame, that can be\r\n     brought against this cause. This is a free Convention, and we are\r\n     willing that any man or woman who has aught against its\r\n     principles, should come here and freely urge it. And yet, with a\r\n     free platform, where is the human being who cares to argue the\r\n     question? Where is the man who presents himself decently, and\r\n     proffers a word of reasonable argument against our cause? I have\r\n     yet to see that man. Instead, we have blackguardism, defamation,\r\n     rowdyism, profanity; we have all the indications that hell from\r\n     beneath is stirred up against this divine Convention, for it is\r\n     divine--it takes hold of heaven and the throne of God! (Hisses).\r\n     Hiss, ye serpents! ye have nothing else to offer. There is not\r\n     one of you to whom God has given a brain to fashion an argument.\r\n     But it goes on record, and all the journals of this city will\r\n     themselves bear testimony, that no one takes the platform, like\r\n     an honest and honorable man, to argue this cause down. Therefore,\r\n     the whole ground is won, and we stand, as we have stood from the\r\n     beginning, on the rock of victory.\r\n\r\nIt was rather singular that in this Convention, so entirely under the\r\ncontrol of a mob, that there should be found one man who dared to\r\nstand upon the platform and announce that he had been an opponent for\r\nten years, and was connected with a journal which had initiated this\r\nmob; and now he desired to give in his adhesion, and to confess his\r\nconversion. This was one of the remarkable incidents of the occasion.\r\n\r\n     ISAAC C. PRAY said: Until within two years I have been an\r\n     incessant opponent of the persons on this platform, in a leading\r\n     journal in this city, which gives the cue to the hisses in that\r\n     gallery. I have myself given--(applause). Pray spare your\r\n     plaudits; I do not wish for them. In November, 1851, I retired\r\n     from that journal, and I have since applied myself to study. This\r\n     movement, among others, has come under my notice, and I have\r\n     given it much attention. The result is, that I have entirely\r\n     changed my opinion with regard to it. I know, not only that my\r\n     former opinion was wrong, but that this movement is one which you\r\n     can not stop; it emanates from the Deity himself, whose influence\r\n     urges man forward on the path of progress. I say to the clergy,\r\n     if they ignore this movement, they ignore that accountability to\r\n     the Almighty which they preach. I do not mean to enter into any\r\n     argument on this subject, but merely wish to say, as each one is\r\n     accountable for his energies to God, you must go on in this good\r\n     and holy cause; also, I wish to show that there is such a thing\r\n     as a man's changing his opinion. This cause has been the butt of\r\n     all the ridicule I could command. I scoffed at it, in season and\r\n     out of season. There is not a lady on this platform whom my pen\r\n     has not assailed; and now I come to make all the reparation in my\r\n     power, by thus raising my voice on behalf of them and the cause\r\n     committed to their hands. (Cheers and stamping).\r\n\r\nAs it was inconsistent with Mrs. Mott's Quaker principles to call upon\r\nthe police for the forcible suppression of the mob, she vacated the\r\nchair, inviting Ernestine L. Rose to take her place. The last evening\r\nsession opened with a song by G. W. Clark; but the music did not\r\nsoothe the mob soul; he was greeted with screeches, which his voice\r\nonly at brief intervals could drown.\r\n\r\nThe President then introduced a German lady, Madame Mathilde Francesca\r\nAnneké, editor of a liberal woman's rights newspaper which had been\r\nsuppressed in Germany. She had but recently landed in our country, and\r\nhastened to the Convention to enjoy the blessings of free speech in a\r\nrepublic. She had heard so much of freedom in America, that she could\r\nhardly express her astonishment at what she witnessed. After many\r\nattempts, and with great difficulty, owing to the tumult and\r\ninterruption by impertinent noises, she spoke as follows, in German,\r\nMrs. Rose translating her remarks into English:\r\n\r\n     I wish to say only a few words. On the other side of the Atlantic\r\n     there is no freedom of any kind, and we have not even the right\r\n     to claim freedom of speech. But can it be that here, too, there\r\n     are tyrants who violate the individual right to express opinions\r\n     on any subject? And do you call yourselves republicans? No; there\r\n     is no republic without freedom of speech. (The tumult showing no\r\n     signs of abatement),\r\n\r\n     WENDELL PHILLIPS came forward, and said: Allow me to say one\r\n     word, purely as a matter of the self-respect which you owe to\r\n     yourselves. We are citizens of a great country, which, from Maine\r\n     to Georgia, has ex tended a welcome to Kossuth, and this New York\r\n     audience is now looking upon a noble woman who stood by his side\r\n     in the battle-fields of Hungary; one who has faced the cannon of\r\n     Francis Joseph of Austria, for the rights of the people. Is this\r\n     the welcome you give her to the shores of republican America? A\r\n     woman who has proved her gallantry and attachment to principles,\r\n     wishes to say five words to you of the feelings with which she is\r\n     impressed toward this cause. I know, fellow-citizens, that you\r\n     will hear her.\r\n\r\nThe audience showing a better disposition to hear Madame Anneké, she\r\nproceeded thus:\r\n\r\n     I saw this morning, in a paper, that the women of America have\r\n     met in convention to claim their rights. I rejoiced when I saw\r\n     that they recognized their equality; and I rejoiced when I saw\r\n     that they have not forgotten their sisters in Germany. I wished\r\n     to be here with my American sisters, to tell them that I\r\n     sympathize in their efforts; but I was too sick to come, and\r\n     would probably not have been here but that another German woman,\r\n     a friend of this movement, came to Newark and took me out of my\r\n     sick bed. But it was the want of a knowledge of the English\r\n     language which kept me away, more than sickness.\r\n\r\n     Before I came here, I knew the tyranny and oppression of kings; I\r\n     felt it in my own person, and friends, and country; and when I\r\n     came here I expected to find that freedom which is denied us at\r\n     home. Our sisters in Germany have long desired freedom, but there\r\n     the desire is repressed as well in man as in woman. There is no\r\n     freedom there, even to claim human rights. Here they expect to\r\n     find freedom of speech; here, for if we can not claim it here,\r\n     where should we go for it? Here, at least, we ought to be able to\r\n     express our opinions on all subjects; and yet, it would appear,\r\n     there is no freedom even here to claim human rights, although the\r\n     only hope in our country for freedom of speech and action, is\r\n     directed to this country for illustration and example. That\r\n     freedom I claim. The women of my country look to this for\r\n     encouragement and sympathy; and they, also, sympathize with this\r\n     cause. We hope it will go on and prosper; and many hearts across\r\n     the ocean in Germany are beating in unison with those here.\r\n\r\nMadame Anneké retired amid a great uproar, which increased when Mr.\r\nPhillips presented himself again. He persisted against frequent\r\nclamorous interruptions in his purpose to speak, and addressed the\r\nmeeting as follows:\r\n\r\n     Mr. PHILLIPS: I am not surprised at the reception I meet.\r\n     (Interruption).\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ROSE: As presiding officer for this evening, I call upon the\r\n     police. The mayor, too, promised to see that our meetings should\r\n     not be disturbed, and I now call upon him to preserve order. As\r\n     citizens of New York, we have a right to this protection, for we\r\n     pay our money for it. My friends, keep order, and then we shall\r\n     know who the disturbers are.\r\n\r\n     Mr. PHILLIPS: You are making a better speech than I can, by your\r\n     conduct. This is proof positive of the necessity of this\r\n     Convention. The time has been when other Conventions have been\r\n     met like this--with hisses. (Renewed hisses). Go on with your\r\n     hisses; geese have hissed before now. If it be your pleasure to\r\n     argue the question for us, by proving that the men here, at\r\n     least, are not fit for exercising political rights. (Great\r\n     uproar).\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ROSE: I regret that I have again to call upon the police to\r\n     keep order; and if they are not able to do it, I call upon the\r\n     meeting to help them.\r\n\r\n     Mr. PHILLIPS: You prove one thing to-night, that the men of New\r\n     York do not understand the meaning of civil liberty and free\r\n     discussion.\r\n\r\nAntoinette Brown made an attempt to speak, but soon ceased amidst the\r\nmost indescribable uproar. Mr. Elliott then jumped upon the platform,\r\nand harangued the audience as a representative of the rowdies, though\r\nhe claimed for himself great fairness and respectability. He said:\r\n\r\n     If taxation without representation be robbery, then robbery is\r\n     right, and I am willing to be robbed. For twelve years I have\r\n     paid taxes; and here and in other countries I have, in return,\r\n     got protection. Robbery is, to take away property forcibly\r\n     without giving an equivalent for it; but a good equivalent is\r\n     given for taxation. In this and other countries, the property of\r\n     individuals is taken from them, as when an owner of land is\r\n     deprived of it by the State to make a railroad through it; that\r\n     is no robbery; an equivalent is given, and the owner is fairly\r\n     dealt by. We have heard many instances of the tyranny inflicted\r\n     on women; but is that a reason that they should vote? If it be,\r\n     minors, who are under a double tyranny, that of father and  mother--\r\n\r\nHere the audience seemed to have lost all patience, and Mr. Elliott's\r\nvoice was completely drowned in the uproar. He retired, repeating that\r\nhe had proved the rowdies were not all on one side. The confusion now\r\nreached its climax. A terrific uproar, shouting, yelling, screaming,\r\nbellowing, laughing, stamping, cries of \"Burleigh,\" \"Root,\" \"Truth,\"\r\n\"Shut up,\" \"Take a drink,\" \"Greedey,\" etc., prevented anything orderly\r\nbeing heard, and the Convention, on the motion of Mrs. Rose, was\r\nadjourned _sine die_; the following resolution having first been read\r\nby Dr. Harriot K. Hunt, and passed without dissent:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the members of this Convention, and the audience\r\n     assembled, tender their thanks to Lucretia Mott for the grace,\r\n     firmness, ability, and courtesy with which she has discharged her\r\n     important and often arduous duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Daily Tribune, Sept. 8, 1853._\r\n\r\n           WOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION:--MEETING AT THE TABERNACLE.\r\n\r\n     _Evening Session_.--Tremendous uproar--close of the Convention.\r\n     Yesterday evening being the last sitting of this Convention, the\r\n     approach to the Tabernacle was thronged long before the hour for\r\n     opening the doors, and considerable excitement seemed to prevail.\r\n     At about seven o'clock the Tabernacle doors were thrown open, and\r\n     the rush for tickets and admission to the anxious throng could\r\n     only be equalled by that of a Jenny Lind night. The building,\r\n     capable of holding some 2,000 persons, was immediately filled to\r\n     excess, and the principal promoters of the movement took their\r\n     places on the platform.... Mr. George W. Clark, who had been\r\n     requested to sing a song on \"Freedom of Thought,\" did so in a\r\n     style apparently not much approved by the audience, who at a very\r\n     early stage began to give vent to all kinds of groans and\r\n     ironical cheers.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. MARTIN, of this State, was then introduced, and with\r\n     considerable difficulty began her address.\r\n\r\n     (Cries--\"No! no!\" and tremendous yells and laughter). \"Time's\r\n     up,\" \"That'll do.\" (Loud hisses, groans, laughter, tigers, and\r\n     demoniac sounds from the galleries). Cries of \"Phillips!\r\n     Phillips.\" (Hisses and yells).\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Tribune, Sept. 9, 1853._\r\n\r\n     We do not know whether any of the _gentlemen_ who have succeeded\r\n     in breaking up the Woman's Rights Convention, or of the other\r\n     _gentlemen_ who have succeeded in three sessions at Metropolitan\r\n     Hall in silencing a regularly appointed and admitted delegate,\r\n     will ever be ashamed of their passion and hostility, but we have\r\n     little doubt that some of them will live to understand their own\r\n     folly. At any rate, they have accomplished a very different thing\r\n     from what they now suppose. For if it had been their earnest\r\n     desire to strengthen the cause of Woman's Rights, they could not\r\n     have done the work half so effectively. Nothing is so good for a\r\n     weak and unpopular movement as this sort of opposition. Had\r\n     Antoinette Brown been allowed to speak at Metropolitan Hall, her\r\n     observations would certainly have occupied but a fraction of the\r\n     time now wasted, and would have had just the weight proper to\r\n     their sense and appropriateness, and no more. But instead of this\r\n     the World's Convention was disturbed and its orators silenced.\r\n     The consequences will be the mass of people throughout the\r\n     country who might otherwise not know of its existence, will have\r\n     their attention called and their sympathies enlisted in its\r\n     behalf. So, too, when Antoinette Brown is put down by Rev. John\r\n     Chambers and his colleagues, and denied what is her clear right\r\n     as a member of the Temperance Convention by a vociferous mob,\r\n     composed, we are sorry to say, very largely of clergymen, every\r\n     impartial person sees that she is surrounded with a prestige and\r\n     importance which, whatever her talents as a speaker, she could\r\n     hardly hope to have attained. Many who question the propriety of\r\n     woman's appearing in public, will revolt at the gagging of one\r\n     who had a right to speak and claimed simply to use it on a proper\r\n     occasion. There is in the public mind of this country an\r\n     intuitive love of fair play and free speech, and those who\r\n     outrage it for any purpose of their own merely reinforce their\r\n     opponents, and bestow a mighty power on the ideas they hate and\r\n     fain would suppress.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Tribune, Sept. 12, 1853._\r\n\r\n     Arguments _pro_ and _con_. The meetings at the Tabernacle Tuesday\r\n     and Wednesday last, exhibited some features not often paralleled\r\n     in the progress of any public agitation for the redress of\r\n     grievances, or the vindication of rights. The advocates of an\r\n     enlargement of the allotted sphere of woman, had hired the house,\r\n     paid the advertising and other expenses, gathered at their own\r\n     expense from their distant homes, and taken all the\r\n     responsibilities of the outlay, yet they offered and desired\r\n     throughout to surrender their own platform for one-half of the\r\n     time, to any respectable and capable antagonists who should see\r\n     fit to appear and attempt to show why their demands were not just\r\n     and their grievances real. Consequently, though they are engaged\r\n     in a struggle, not only against numbers and power, and fashion\r\n     and immemorial custom, but with the Pulpit and the Press actively\r\n     and bitterly leading and spurring on their antagonists, and with\r\n     no access to the public ear but from the public platform, we\r\n     consider this proposition more than liberal--it was chivalric and\r\n     generous. We listened with interest to some of the arguments\r\n     _pro_ and _con_, and propose here to recapitulate their\r\n     substance, that our readers may see at a glance the present\r\n     position and bearing of the controversy. We will begin with the\r\n     first speech we heard, that of\r\n\r\n     Rev. WM. H. CHANNING: They say the public platform is not in\r\n     woman's sphere; but let us understand why. Jenny Lind stands on\r\n     that platform before thousands of men and women, and sings, \"I\r\n     know that my Redeemer liveth,\" with all hearts approving, all\r\n     voices applauding, and nobody lisps a word that she is out of her\r\n     sphere. Well, Antoinette Brown believes the sentiment so sang to\r\n     be the hope of a lost world, and feels herself called to bear\r\n     witness in behalf of that religion, and to commend His salvation\r\n     to the understanding and hearts of all who will hear her. Why may\r\n     she not obey this impulse, and bear the tidings of a world's\r\n     salvation to those perishing in darkness and sin? What is there\r\n     unfeminine or revolting in her preaching the truth which Jenny\r\n     Lind may sing without objection and amid universal applause?\r\n\r\n     Answer by things \"in male costumes.\" Hiss-s-s.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ERNESTINE L. ROSE: The law declares husband and wife one;\r\n     and such we all feel that they should be, and must be when the\r\n     marriage is a true one. Now, why should that same law base their\r\n     union or oneness on inequality or subjugation? The wife dies and\r\n     the husband inherits all her property, as is right; but let the\r\n     husband die, and the greater part of the property is taken from\r\n     the wife and given to others, even though all that property was\r\n     earned or inherited by the wife. She may be turned out of the\r\n     house she was born in and which was hers until marriage, and see\r\n     it given to her husband's brothers or other kindred who are\r\n     strangers to her. I insist that the wife should own and inherit\r\n     the property of the husband just to the same extent that the\r\n     husband inherits that of the wife--why not?\r\n\r\n     Answer to the aforesaid--Hiss-s-s-s! Bow-ow-ow!\r\n\r\n     HARRIOT K. HUNT: I plant myself on the basis of the Declaration\r\n     of Independence and insist, with our Revolutionary sires, that\r\n     taxation without representation is tyranny. Well; here am I, an\r\n     independent American woman, educated for and living by the\r\n     practice of medicine. I own property, and pay taxes on that\r\n     property. I demand of the Government that taxes me that it should\r\n     allow me an equal voice with the other tax-payers in the disposal\r\n     of the public money. I am certainly not less intelligent than\r\n     thousands who, though scarcely able to read their ballots, are\r\n     entitled to vote. I am allowed to vote in any bank or insurance\r\n     company when I choose to be a stockholder; why ought I not to\r\n     vote in the disposition of public money raised by tax, as well as\r\n     those men who do not pay taxes, or those who do either?\r\n\r\n     Answer of the aforesaid--Yah! wow! Hiss-s-s-s!\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE: I plead for the right of woman to the control of her\r\n     own person as a moral, intelligent, accountable being. I know a\r\n     wife who has not set foot outside of her husband's house for\r\n     three years, because her husband forbids her doing so when he is\r\n     present, and locks her up when he is absent. That wife is gray\r\n     with sorrow and despair though now in middle life, but there is\r\n     no redress for her wrongs because the law makes her husband her\r\n     master, and there is no proof that he beats or bruises her; there\r\n     is nothing in his treatment of her that the law does not allow. I\r\n     protest against such a law and demand its overthrow; and I\r\n     protest against any law which limits the sphere of woman, as a\r\n     bar to her intellectual development. You say she _can not_ do\r\n     this and that, but if so, what need of a law to prevent her? You\r\n     say her intellectual achievements have not equaled those of man;\r\n     but I answer, that she has had no motive, no opportunity for such\r\n     achievement. Close all the avenues, take away all the incitement\r\n     for man's ambition, and he would do no more than woman does.\r\n     Grant her freedom, education, and opportunity, and she will do\r\n     what God intended she should do, no less, no more. Men! you\r\n     dwarf, you wrong yourselves in restraining and fettering the\r\n     intellectual development of woman! I ask for her liberty to do\r\n     whatever moral and useful deed she proves able to do--why should\r\n     I ask in vain?\r\n\r\n     Answer by time-serving Press: Men, Women, and Bloomers! Faugh!\r\n     Bah!\r\n\r\n     ANTOINETTE BROWN: I plead that the mother may not be legally\r\n     robbed of her children. I know a mother who was left a widow\r\n     with three young children. She was able, and most willing to\r\n     support them in humble independence; but her husband before he\r\n     died, had secretly given two of them to his relatives, and the\r\n     law tore them from the mother's bosom, and left her but the\r\n     youngest, who was soon taken from her by death. That, mother\r\n     lived to see her two surviving children, grow up, the one to be a\r\n     drunkard and the other a felon, all through neglect and the want\r\n     of that care and guardianship which none so well as a parent can\r\n     be relied on to afford. I plead for woman as a mother, that her\r\n     right to her children be recognized as at least equal to that of\r\n     the father, and that he, being dead, no other can have a right to\r\n     their guardianship paramount or even equal to hers.\r\n\r\n     Pantalooned mob as aforesaid: Oh, dry up! Bow-ow! Waugh!\r\n     Hiss-s-s! Get out!\r\n\r\n     The case is still on.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUSAN B. ANTHONY (with autograph).]\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN'S RIGHTS STATE CONVENTION,\r\n\r\nROCHESTER, N. Y., NOVEMBER 30 AND DECEMBER 1, 1853.\r\n\r\nAs William Henry Channing resided at Rochester, and felt that the time\r\nhad come for some more active measures, he was invited to prepare the\r\ncall and resolutions for the Convention. The following was issued and\r\nextensively circulated, and signed by many of the leading men and\r\nwomen of the State:\r\n\r\n                    THE JUST AND EQUAL RIGHTS OF WOMEN.\r\n\r\n     _To the Men and Women of New York:_\r\n\r\n     The \"Woman's Rights\" Movement is a practical one, demanding\r\n     prompt and efficient action for the relief of oppressive wrongs;\r\n     and, as the Conventions held for several years past in different\r\n     States, have answered their end of arousing earnest public\r\n     attention, the time has come for calling upon the people to\r\n     reform the evils from which women suffer, by their\r\n     Representatives in Legislative Assemblies.\r\n\r\n     The wise and humane of all classes in society, however much they\r\n     may differ upon speculative points as to woman's nature and\r\n     function, agree that there are actual abuses of women, tolerated\r\n     by custom and authorized by law, which are condemned alike by the\r\n     genius of republican institutions and the spirit of the Christian\r\n     religion. Conscience and common sense, then, unite to sanction\r\n     their immediate redress. Thousands of the best men and women, in\r\n     all our communities, are asking such questions as these:\r\n\r\n     1. Why should not woman's work be paid for according to the\r\n     quality of the work done, and not the sex of the worker?\r\n\r\n     2. How shall we open for woman's energies new spheres of well\r\n     remunerated industry?\r\n\r\n     3. Why should not wives, equally with husbands, be entitled to\r\n     their own earnings?\r\n\r\n     4. Why should not widows, equally with widowers, become by law\r\n     the legal guardians, as they certainly are by nature the natural\r\n     guardians, of their own children?\r\n\r\n     5. On what just ground do the laws make a distinction between men\r\n     and women, in regard to the ownership of property, inheritance,\r\n     and the administration of estates?\r\n\r\n     6. Why should women, any more than men, be taxed without\r\n     representation?\r\n\r\n     7. Why may not women claim to be tried by a jury of their peers,\r\n     with exactly the same right as men claim to be and actually are?\r\n\r\n     8. If women need the protection of the laws, and are subject to\r\n     the penalties of the laws equally with men, why should they not\r\n     have an equal influence in making the laws, and appointing\r\n     Legislatures, the Judiciary, and Executive?\r\n\r\n     And, finally, if governments--according to our National\r\n     Declaration of Independence--\"derive their just powers from the\r\n     consent of the governed,\" why should women, any more than men, be\r\n     governed without their own consent; and why, therefore, is not\r\n     woman's right to suffrage precisely equal to man's?\r\n\r\n     For the end of finding out practical answers to these and similar\r\n     questions, and making suitable arrangements to bring the existing\r\n     wrongs of women, in the State of New York, before the Legislature\r\n     at its next session, we, the undersigned, do urgently request the\r\n     men and women of the Commonwealth to assemble in Convention, in\r\n     the city of Rochester, on Wednesday, November 30th, and Thursday,\r\n     December 1, 1853.[122]\r\n\r\nThe Convention assembled at Corinthian Hall at 10 o'clock. Rev. Samuel\r\nJ. May, of Syracuse, in the chair.[123] After thanking the Convention\r\nfor the honor conferred, he ran the parallel between the laws for\r\nmarried women and the slaves on the Southern plantation, and then\r\nintroduced Ernestine L. Rose, to paint in more vivid colors the\r\npicture he had outlined.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ROSE said: The remarks of the president have impressed us to\r\n     do our duty with all the earnestness in our power. This is termed\r\n     a woman's rights movement. Alas! that the painful necessity\r\n     should exist, for woman's calling a Convention to claim her\r\n     rights from those who have been created to go hand in hand, and\r\n     heart in heart with her; whose interests can not be divided from\r\n     hers. Why does she claim them? Because every human being has a\r\n     right to all the advantages society has to bestow, if his having\r\n     them does not injure the rights of others. Life is valueless\r\n     without liberty, and shall we not claim that which is dearer than\r\n     life? In savage life, liberty is synonymous with aggression. In\r\n     civilized countries it is founded on equality of rights.\r\n     Oppression always produces suffering through the whole of the\r\n     society where it exists; this movement ought, therefore, to be\r\n     called a human rights movement. The wrongs of woman are so many\r\n     (indeed there is scarcely anything else but wrongs) that there is\r\n     not time to mention them all in one convention. She would speak\r\n     at present of legal wrongs, and leave it to her hearers, if all\r\n     are not--men, perhaps, more than women--sufferers by these\r\n     wrongs. How can woman have a right to her children when the right\r\n     to herself is taken away? At the marriage altar the husband says\r\n     in effect, \"All this is mine, all mine is my own.\" She ceases to\r\n     exist legally, except when she violates the laws; then she\r\n     assumes her identity just long enough to receive the penalty.\r\n     When the husband dies poor, leaving the widow with small children\r\n     (here the speaker pictured thrillingly the suffering of a poor,\r\n     weak-minded, helpless woman, with small children dependent on\r\n     her), she is then acknowledged the guardian of her children. But\r\n     any property left them takes away her right of control. If there\r\n     is property the law steps in as guardian of it and therefore of\r\n     the children. The widowed mother is their guardian, only on\r\n     condition that the husband has made her so by will. Can any human\r\n     being be benefited by such gross violations of humanity?\r\n\r\n     MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE said: The legal disabilities of woman are\r\n     many, as not only known to those who bear them, but they are\r\n     acknowledged by Kent, Story, and many other legal authorities. A\r\n     wife has no management in the joint earnings of herself and her\r\n     husband; they are entirely under control of the husband, who is\r\n     obliged to furnish the wife merely the common necessaries of\r\n     life; all that she receives beyond these is looked upon by the\r\n     law as a favor, and not held as her right. A mother is denied the\r\n     custody of her own child; a most barbarous and unjust law, which\r\n     robs her of the child placed in her care by the great Creator\r\n     himself. A widow is allowed the use merely of one-third of the\r\n     real estate left at the husband's death; and when her minor\r\n     children have grown up she must surrender the personal property,\r\n     even to the family Bible, and the pictures of her dear children.\r\n     In view of such laws the women engaged in this movement ask that\r\n     the wife shall be made heir to the husband to the same extent\r\n     that he is now her heir.\r\n\r\n     Taxation without representation is another of the wrongs that\r\n     woman endures. In this she is held below the negro in the\r\n     political scale; for the black man, when not possessing property\r\n     to the extent of two hundred and fifty dollars, is not allowed to\r\n     vote, but neither is he taxed. The present law of divorce is very\r\n     unjust; the husband, whether the innocent or the guilty party,\r\n     retaining all the wife's property, as also the control of the\r\n     children unless by special decree of the court they are assigned\r\n     to the mother.\r\n\r\n     Rev. ANTOINETTE BROWN said: The wife owes service and labor to\r\n     her husband as much and as absolutely as the slave does to his\r\n     master. This grates harshly upon the ears of Christendom; but it\r\n     is made palpably and practically true all through our statute\r\n     books, despite the poetic fancy which views woman as elevated in\r\n     the social estate; but a little lower than the angels.\r\n\r\nLetters were read from Paulina Wright Davis, Dr. Trail, Mary C.\r\nVaughan, and Hon. William Hay. A series of fourteen resolutions were\r\npresented by Mr. Channing, and discussed, which suggested the\r\nappointment of various committees. One to prepare an address to the\r\nLegislature, and to ask a special hearing before a joint committee to\r\nconsider the whole subject of the just and equal rights of woman;\r\nanother to prepare an address to the capitalists and industrialists of\r\nNew York on the best modes of employing and remunerating women.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the movement, now in progress throughout the\r\n     United States, for securing the just and equal rights of women,\r\n     in education, industry, law, politics, religion, and social life,\r\n     is timely, wise, and practical; that it is authorized by all the\r\n     essential principles of Republican institutions, and sanctioned\r\n     by the spirit of the Christian religion; and finally that it is\r\n     but a carrying on to completeness of a reform, already begun, by\r\n     legal provisions, in the most advanced States of the Union.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the design of all true legislation should be the\r\n     elevation of every member of the community--and that the\r\n     violation of this legitimate design, in depriving woman of her\r\n     just and equal rights, is not only highly injurious to her, but\r\n     by reason of the equilibrium which pervades all existence, that\r\n     man, too, is impeded in his progress by the very chains which\r\n     bind woman to the lifeless skeleton of feudal civilization.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we do not ask for woman's political, civil,\r\n     industrial, and social equality with man, in the spirit of\r\n     antagonism, or with a wish to produce separate and conflicting\r\n     interests between the sexes, but because the onward progress of\r\n     society and the highest aspirations of the human race, demand\r\n     that woman should everywhere be recognized as the co-equal and\r\n     co-sovereign of man.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That women justly claim an equally free access with\r\n     men, to the highest means of mental, moral, and physical culture,\r\n     provided in seminaries, colleges, professional and industrial\r\n     schools; and that we call upon all friends of progress and upon\r\n     the Legislature of New York, in establishing and endowing\r\n     institutions, to favor pre-eminently those which seek to place\r\n     males and females on a level of equal advantages in their system\r\n     of education.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That, inasmuch as universal experience proves the\r\n     inseparable connection between dependence and degradation--while\r\n     it is plain to every candid observer of society that women are\r\n     kept poor, by being crowded together, to compete with and\r\n     undersell one another in a few branches of labor, and that from\r\n     this very poverty of women, spring many of the most terrible\r\n     wrongs and evils, which corrupt and endanger society: therefore\r\n     do we invite the earnest attention of capitalists, merchants,\r\n     traders, manufacturers, and mechanics, to the urgent need, which\r\n     everywhere exists, of opening to women new avenues of honest and\r\n     honorable employment, and we do hereby call upon all manly men to\r\n     make room for their sisters to earn an independent livelihood.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That, whereas, the custom of making small\r\n     remuneration for woman's work, in all departments of industry,\r\n     has sprung from her dependence, which dependence is prolonged and\r\n     increased by this most irrational and unjust habit of half pay;\r\n     therefore do we demand, in the name of common sense and common\r\n     conscience, that women equally with men, should be paid for their\r\n     services according to the quality and quantity of the work done,\r\n     and not the sex of the worker.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That, whereas, the State of New York, in the acts of\r\n     1848 and 1849, has honorably and justly placed married women on\r\n     the footing of equality with unmarried women, in regard to the\r\n     receiving, holding, conveying, and devising of all property, real\r\n     and personal, we call upon the Legislature of the State to take\r\n     the next step--so plainly justified by its own precedents--of\r\n     providing that husbands and wives shall be joint owners of their\r\n     joint earnings--the community estate passing to the survivor at\r\n     the death of either party.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That, whereas, the evident intent of the Legislature\r\n     of the State of New York has for many years been progressively to\r\n     do away with the legal disabilities of women, which existed under\r\n     the savage usages of the old common law, therefore we do urgently\r\n     call upon the Legislature of this State, at its next session, to\r\n     appoint a joint committee to examine and revise the statutes, and\r\n     to propose remedies for the redress of all legal grievances from\r\n     which women now suffer, and suitable measures for the full\r\n     establishment of women's legal equality with men.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That, whereas, under the common law, the father is\r\n     regarded as the guardian, by nature, of his children, having the\r\n     entire control of their persons and education, while only upon\r\n     the death of the father, does the mother become the guardian by\r\n     nature; and, whereas, by the revised statutes of New York, it is\r\n     provided, that where an estate in lands shall become vested in an\r\n     infant, the guardianship of such infant, with the rights, powers,\r\n     and duties of a guardian in soccage, shall belong to the father,\r\n     and only in case of the father's death, to the mother; and,\r\n     whereas, finally and chiefly, by the revised statutes of New\r\n     York, it is provided, that every father may, by his deed or last\r\n     will, duly executed, dispose of the custody and tuition of his\r\n     children, during their minority, \"to any person or persons in\r\n     possession or remainder\"; therefore, do we solemnly protest\r\n     against the utter violation of every mother's rights, authorized\r\n     by existing laws, in regard to the guardianship of infants, and\r\n     demand, in the name of common humanity, that the Legislature of\r\n     New York so amend the statutes, as to place fathers and mothers\r\n     on equal footing in regard to the guardianship of their children.\r\n     Especially do we invite the Legislature instantly to pass laws,\r\n     entitling mothers to become their children's guardians, in all\r\n     cases where, by habitual drunkenness, immorality, or\r\n     improvidence, fathers are incompetent to the sacred trust.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That, whereas, according to the amendments of the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, it is provided that \"in all\r\n     criminal cases, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and\r\n     public trial, by an impartial jury,\" and that \"in suits at common\r\n     law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars,\r\n     the right of trial by jury shall be preserved\"; and, whereas,\r\n     according to the revised statutes of New York, it is provided,\r\n     that \"no member of this State can be disfranchised or deprived of\r\n     any of the rights or privileges, secured to any citizen thereof,\r\n     unless by the law of the land, or the judgment of his peers\";\r\n     therefore, do we demand, that women, as \"members\" and \"citizens\"\r\n     of this State, equally with men, should be entitled to claim a\r\n     trial by \"an impartial jury of their peers.\" And especially do we\r\n     remonstrate against the partial, mean, and utterly inequitable\r\n     custom, everywhere prevalent, that in questions of divorce, men,\r\n     and men alone, should be regarded as \"an impartial jury.\"\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That, whereas, in the Declaration of Independence of\r\n     the United States, one of the \"injuries and usurpation\"\r\n     complained of is Taxation without the consent of the persons\r\n     taxed; and, whereas, it is provided in the revised statutes of\r\n     New York, that \"no tax, duty, aid or imposition whatever--except\r\n     such as may be laid by a law of the United States--can be taken\r\n     or levied within this State, without the grant and assent of the\r\n     people of this State; by their representatives in Senate and\r\n     Assembly\"; and that \"no citizen of this State can be compelled to\r\n     contribute to any gift, loan, tax, or other like charge, not laid\r\n     or imposed by a law of the United States, or by the Legislature\r\n     of the State\"; therefore do we proclaim, that it is a gross act\r\n     of tyranny and usurpation, to tax women without their consent,\r\n     and we demand, either that women be represented by their own\r\n     appointed representatives, or that they be freed from the\r\n     imposition of taxes.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That inasmuch as it is the fundamental principle of\r\n     the Nation and of every State in this Union, that all\r\n     \"governments derive their just powers from the consent of the\r\n     governed\"--it is a manifest violation of the Supreme Law of the\r\n     land for males to govern females without their consent; and\r\n     therefore do we demand, of the people of New York, such a change\r\n     in the Constitution of the State, as will secure to women the\r\n     right of suffrage which is now so unjustly monopolized by men.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Samuel J. May, Ernestine\r\n     L. Rose, William Hay, Susan B. Anthony, Burroughs Phillips,\r\n     Antoinette L. Brown, W. H. Channing, and Lydia A. Jenkins, be a\r\n     committee to prepare and to present an address to the Legislature\r\n     of New York, at its next session, stating, as specifically as\r\n     they shall see fit, the legal disabilities of women, and to ask a\r\n     hearing before a joint committee, specially appointed to consider\r\n     the whole subject of the just and equal rights of women.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That Horace Greeley, Mary C. Vaughan, Abram Pryne,\r\n     Sarah Pellet, and Matilda Joslyn Gage be a committee to prepare\r\n     an address to capitalists and industrialists of New York, on the\r\n     best modes of employing and remunerating the industry of women.\r\n\r\nThe President invited any one who saw errors or fallacies in the\r\narguments brought forward, to make them apparent.\r\n\r\n     Mr. PRYNE, of Cazenovia, editor of the _Progressive Christian_,\r\n     said: If women desire to enter the ordinary avocations of men,\r\n     they must be brave enough to become shopkeepers and mechanics.\r\n     There is no law to prevent it, neither is there to woman's\r\n     voting. The men have made an arrangement by which their votes are\r\n     not counted, but still they might provide ballot-boxes, and\r\n     decide upon whom they would prefer as magistrates and\r\n     legislators. A man who was thus voted to stay at home, by an\r\n     overwhelming majority of women, even if elected by the men, would\r\n     find himself in an uncomfortable position.\r\n\r\n     Mr. CHANNING said he understood that in a town in Ohio the women\r\n     did so, and cast sixty votes.\r\n\r\n     Mr. PRYNE was glad to hear that there were practical women in\r\n     Ohio. Man is where he is because he is what he is, and when woman\r\n     gets the same elements of moral and physical power she will have\r\n     no more wrongs to complain of.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ROSE said it was a true maxim that he who would be free,\r\n     himself must strike the blow. But woman could not, as things\r\n     were, help herself. As well might the slaveholder say that the\r\n     slave was fit for no other condition while he consents to occupy\r\n     that position. To a certain extent this is true, and the same\r\n     principles apply to both classes. But all human beings are not\r\n     martyrs; the majority accept the conditions in which they find\r\n     themselves, rather than make their lives one long struggle for\r\n     freedom. Woman must be educated to take the stand which Mr. Pryne\r\n     invites her to assume. The only object for which woman is now\r\n     reared is to be married; and is she fitted even for that; to\r\n     become a companion, an assistant, an aid, a comforter to man; and\r\n     above all, a mother? That alone; to fit a woman for that sphere;\r\n     she must possess all the extended education which would fit her\r\n     to take any position in life to which man aspires.\r\n\r\n     MARY F. LOVE said there might be hindrances in the way of woman\r\n     too great for her to surmount. Men in their straggles for liberty\r\n     have sometimes met insuperable obstacles; there have been\r\n     unsuccessful revolutions at all stages of human development.\r\n\r\n     FREDERICK DOUGLASS, in discussing the injustice to woman in the\r\n     world of work, said: Some one whispers in my ear that as teachers\r\n     women get one-fourth the pay men do, while a girl's tuition is\r\n     the same as a boy's.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT observed, that the girl gets twice as much\r\n     education, being uniformly more studious and attentive.\r\n\r\n     E. A. HOPKINS, a lawyer of Rochester, spoke to the eighth\r\n     resolution, which asks fora committee to examine the whole\r\n     subject; he said: I believe if this question was properly\r\n     presented to the Legislature, we might have well grounded hope\r\n     for the relief of women from their legal disabilities, and\r\n     indicated the amendments which ought to be made in the present\r\n     laws regulating the relations of the married state. He argued\r\n     against making the man and wife joint owners of property, execpt\r\n     in certain specific cases.\r\n\r\n     Rev. Mr. CHANNING said that in Louisiana and California this\r\n     joint ownership was recognized by the laws.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOPKINS was not aware of that; and he did not see why labor,\r\n     worth in the market no more than one or two dollars per week,\r\n     should be paid for at the rate of, it may be, $200 per week. He\r\n     thought the law should be altered so that the widow may have\r\n     control of property while her children are minors. The right to\r\n     vote, which was claimed under the idea that representation should\r\n     go before taxation, he discussed with ability, taking ground\r\n     against women voting. The arguments used by the other side were\r\n     shown to be fallacious, or at least partaking of the aristocratic\r\n     element. Women are already tried by \"their peers,\" though not by\r\n     those of their own sex. As to women holding office, this movement\r\n     had proved the position of Dr. Channing, in his discussion with\r\n     Miss Martineau, that \"influence was good, and office bad.\" Women\r\n     should be content to exercise influence, without seeking for the\r\n     spoils and risking the temptations of office. He argued upon the\r\n     maxim that \"governments derive their just powers from the consent\r\n     of the governed,\" contending that it was not true; those powers\r\n     are derived from the majority who are brave enough to set up and\r\n     sustain the government.[124]\r\n\r\nFrederick Douglass, in the course of his remarks, said he had seen two\r\nyoung women assistants in the County Clerk's office, also young women\r\ngoing into printing-offices to set type; and he might have added the\r\nfollowing, which we clip from the _The Una_ of the same date:\r\n\r\n     Female compositors have been employed in the offices of the three\r\n     Cincinnati daily papers which stood out against the demands of\r\n     the Printer's Union. The Pittsburg _Daily Dispatch_ is also set\r\n     up entirely by females. The experiment was commenced on that\r\n     paper two months ago, and the proprietors now announce its entire\r\n     success. The Louisville _Courier_ announces its intentions to try\r\n     the experiment in the spring.\r\n\r\n     Wherever the change has been made it seems to be completely\r\n     successful.--_Courier and Enquirer_.\r\n\r\n     Mr. MAY said: If a woman should not leave her family to go to the\r\n     Legislature, neither should a man. The obligation is mutual: and\r\n     while children require the care of both parents, both should\r\n     share the duty, and not leave them from ambitious motives. It is\r\n     only those who have well discharged their duties to their\r\n     families who are fit to become legislators. We are now giving the\r\n     nation into the hands of boys and half-grown men. Had we such\r\n     women as Lucretia Mott and Angelina Grimké in the Legislature,\r\n     there would be more wisdom there than we have to-day. When I\r\n     look through the nation and see the shameful mismanagement, I am\r\n     convinced that it is the result, in part, of the absence of the\r\n     feminine element in high stations; it is because the maternal\r\n     influence is wanting that we run riot as we do. The State is in a\r\n     condition of half orphanage, and needs the care and guidance of a\r\n     mother.\r\n\r\n     E. A. HOPKINS, Esq.: Thought the movement was not entirely\r\n     timely, wise, and practicable, though parts of it might be. He\r\n     took Up and answered each of the questions appended to the call\r\n     for the Convention. His speech was characteristic of the lawyer,\r\n     and the frequent recurrence of the idea, _it is right because it\r\n     is customary_, will illustrate its moral character. He stated\r\n     three several points where he thought woman was aggrieved and\r\n     should have legislative redress. Office was a temptation, and he\r\n     thought woman was better off without it.\r\n\r\n     Miss BROWN proposed that the men, for a while, be relieved from\r\n     this great evil, and excused from the burdens of office. If this\r\n     necessary duty was so burdensome, woman should be a helper and\r\n     share its burdens with him. We are taught to be grateful for\r\n     small favors. Our friend has been giving you milk, but to me it\r\n     seems, even at that, diluted with water. There is one law, \"All\r\n     things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even\r\n     so to them.\" When our brothers are ready to be paid a dollar a\r\n     week for keeping house and nursing the children, let them dictate\r\n     this also to us. We women now offer to take the burden and\r\n     responsibility of government upon ourselves. We would be willing\r\n     to save our friends for a time from temptation and care, as they\r\n     have so generously done by us; if we are to be satisfied with\r\n     things as they are, so should the slave be. He should be grateful\r\n     for the care of his master, for according to the established\r\n     price paid for labor, he does not earn enough to take care of\r\n     himself. We should be satisfied with our present license laws;\r\n     they are right, just, and good, judged by our friend's reasoning.\r\n     If our offer to rule alone is not liked, we are ready, then, to\r\n     co-operate with man in this according to the original design and\r\n     arrangement of the Creator.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HOPKINS opposed with several objections, one of which was,\r\n     that private stations demand as high qualifications, and more\r\n     surely command a just recompense, than public offices; woman has\r\n     yet taken few lucrative private employments; why, then, till\r\n     these are taken, should she seek for public office?\r\n\r\n     FREDERICK DOUGLASS again raised the inquiry, in the investment of\r\n     money or the use of property, where there is joint ownership, and\r\n     in regard to which there may be disagreement between husband and\r\n     wife, how shall the matter be settled between them? Law is not a\r\n     necessity of human nature; if love ruled, statutes would be\r\n     obsolete; genuine marriages and harmonious co-operations would\r\n     prevent any such necessity.\r\n\r\n     Miss BROWN proposed to reply in a word: Law must regulate\r\n     differences where there is not true union, and as a business\r\n     copartnership, if the matter could not be adjusted between\r\n     themselves to mutual satisfaction, let it be referred to a third\r\n     person; where it is a property transaction, let the usual\r\n     business custom be observed; but if there be a difficulty of a\r\n     different nature, so serious that the parties, bound to each\r\n     other for life, can not enjoy existence together if they can not\r\n     make each other happy, but are to each other a mutual source of\r\n     discomfort, why, let them separate; let them not be divorced, but\r\n     let them each be content to live alone for the good of society.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. LOVE, of Randolph, read an address, flowery in style, but\r\n     full of truth, upon the discord that pervades social life. Homes\r\n     should be reformed; from domestic uncongeniality spring the chief\r\n     evils of society. She advised men and women to beware of\r\n     inharmonious alliances, and made a touching appeal in behalf of\r\n     the fallen of her sex.\r\n\r\n     Mr. CHANNING said: Whenever he heard a woman, in face of existing\r\n     prejudices, speak the simple truth in regard to the social wrongs\r\n     of her sisters, as Mrs. Love had done, asking no leave of the\r\n     Convention, and making no apology for her sincere words, however\r\n     they might startle false delicacy, he felt bound as a man, and in\r\n     the name of man, to offer her the tribute of his hearty respect.\r\n\r\nMr. Channing presented two forms of petitions--one for property\r\nrights, the other for suffrage--which were adopted. Rev. Lydia A.\r\nJenkins read a carefully prepared address. Emma R. Coe made a full\r\nreview of the laws, which, at that early day, was the burden of\r\nalmost every speech. At the close of the sixth session, the audiences\r\nhaving grown larger and larger, until the spacious and beautiful\r\nCorinthian Hall was packed to its utmost, the Convention adjourned, to\r\nbegin its real work in canvassing the State with lectures and\r\npetitions, preparing an address to the Legislature, securing a\r\nhearing, and holding a Convention at Albany during the coming session\r\nof that body.\r\n\r\nAn appeal[125] to the women of the State was at once issued, and all\r\neditors requested to publish it with the forms of petitions. The\r\nresponses came back in the form of 13,000 signatures in two months,\r\ngathered in thirty out of the sixty counties of the Empire State. The\r\nlecturers were: Susan B. Anthony, Mary F. Love, Sarah Pellet, Lydia A.\r\nJenkins, and Matilda Joslyn Gage. Over sixty women were engaged in the\r\nwork of circulating the petitions.\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley, chairman of the Committee on Industry, published in\r\n_The New York Tribune_ the following report:\r\n\r\n                             WOMAN AND WORK.\r\n\r\n     Whether women should or should not be permitted to vote, to hold\r\n     office, to serve on juries, and to officiate as lawyers, doctors,\r\n     or divines, are questions about which a diversity of opinions is\r\n     likely long to exist. But that the current rates of remuneration\r\n     for woman's work are entirely, unjustly inadequate, is a\r\n     proposition which needs only to be considered to insure its\r\n     hearty acceptance by every intelligent, justice-loving human\r\n     being. Consider a few facts:\r\n\r\n     Every able-bodied man inured to labor, though of the rudest sort,\r\n     who steps on shore in America from Europe, is worth a dollar per\r\n     day, and can readily command it. Though he only knows how to\r\n     wield such rude, clumsy implements as the pick and spade, there\r\n     are dozens of places where his services are in request at a\r\n     dollar per day the year through, and he can even be transported\r\n     hence to the place where his services are wanted, on the strength\r\n     of his contract to work and the credit of his future earnings. We\r\n     do not say this is the case every day in the year, for it may not\r\n     be at this most inclement and forbidding season; but it is the\r\n     general fact, as every one knows. And any careful, intelligent,\r\n     resolute male laborer is morally certain to rise out of the\r\n     condition of a mere shoveler, into a position where the work is\r\n     lighter and the pay better after a year or two of faithful\r\n     service.\r\n\r\n     But the sister of this same faithful worker, equally careful,\r\n     intelligent, and willing to do anything honest and reputable for\r\n     a living, finds no such chances proffered her. No agent meets\r\n     her on the dock to persuade her to accept a passage to Illinois\r\n     or Upper Canada, there to be employed on fair work at a dollar\r\n     per day and expectations. On the contrary, she may think herself\r\n     fortunate if a week's search opens to her a place where by the\r\n     devotion of all her waking hours she can earn five to six dollars\r\n     per month, with a chance of its increase, after several years'\r\n     faithful service, to seven or eight dollars at most.\r\n\r\n     The brother is in many respects the equal of his employer; may\r\n     sit down beside him at the hotel where they both stop for dinner;\r\n     their votes may balance each other at any election; the laborer\r\n     lives with those whose company suits him, and needs no character\r\n     from his last place to secure him employment or a new job when he\r\n     gets tired of the old one. But the sister never passes out of the\r\n     atmosphere of caste--of conscious and galling inferiority to\r\n     those with whom her days must be spent. There is no election day\r\n     in her year, and but the ghost of a Fourth of July. She must live\r\n     not with those she likes, but with those who want her; she is not\r\n     always safe from libertine insult in what serves her for a home;\r\n     she knows no ten-hour rule, and would not dare to claim its\r\n     protection if one were enacted. Though not a slave by law, she is\r\n     too often as near it in practice as one legally free can be.\r\n\r\n     Now this disparity between the rewards of man's and woman's labor\r\n     at the base of the social edifice, is carried up to its very\r\n     pinnacle. Of a brother and sister equally qualified and effective\r\n     as teachers, the brother will receive twice as much compensation\r\n     as the sister. The mistress who conducts the rural district\r\n     school in summer, usually receives less than half the monthly\r\n     stipend that her brother does for teaching that same school in\r\n     winter, when time and work are far less valuable; and here there\r\n     can be no pretence of a disparity in capacity justifying that in\r\n     wages. Between male and female workers in the factories and\r\n     mills, the same difference is enforced.\r\n\r\n     Who does not feel that this is intrinsically wrong? that the\r\n     sister ought to have equal (not necessarily identical)\r\n     opportunities with the brother--should be as well taught,\r\n     industrially as well as intellectually, and her compensation made\r\n     to correspond with her capacity, upon a clear understanding of\r\n     the fact that, though her muscular power is less than his, yet\r\n     her dexterity and celerity of manipulation are greater?\r\n\r\n     Where does the wrong originate? Suppose that, by some inexorable\r\n     law in the spirit of Hindoo caste, it were settled that negroes,\r\n     regardless of personal capacity, could do nothing for a living\r\n     but black boots, and that red-haired men were allowed to engage\r\n     in no avocation except horse-currying; who does not perceive\r\n     that, though boot-blacking and horse-currying might be well and\r\n     cheaply done, black-skinned and also red-haired men would have\r\n     but a sorry chance for making a living? Who does not see that\r\n     their wages, social standing, and means of securing independence,\r\n     would be far inferior to those they now enjoy?\r\n\r\n     The one great cause, therefore, of the inadequate compensation\r\n     and inferior position of woman, is the unjust apportionment of\r\n     avocation. Man has taken the lion's share to himself, and\r\n     allotted the residue to woman, telling her to take that and be\r\n     content with it, if she don't want to be regarded as a forward,\r\n     indelicate, presuming, unwomanly creature, who is evidently no\r\n     better than she should be. And woman has come for the most part\r\n     to accept the lot thus assigned her, with thankfulness, or,\r\n     rather, without thought, just as the Mussulman's wife rejoices in\r\n     her sense of propriety which will not permit her to show her face\r\n     in the street, and the Brahmin widow immolates herself on the\r\n     funeral pyre of her husband.\r\n\r\n     What is the appropriate remedy?\r\n\r\n     Primarily and mainly, a more rational and healthful public\r\n     sentiment with regard to woman's work; a sentiment which shall\r\n     welcome her to every employment wherein she may be useful and\r\n     efficient without necessarily compromising her purity or\r\n     overtasking her strength. Let her be encouraged to open a store,\r\n     to work a garden, plant and tend an orchard, to learn any of the\r\n     lighter mechanical trades, to study for a profession, whenever\r\n     her circumstances and her tastes shall render any of these\r\n     desirable. Let woman, and the advocates of justice to women,\r\n     encourage and patronize her in whatever laudable pursuits she may\r\n     thus undertake; let them give a preference to dry-goods stores\r\n     wherein the clerks are mainly women; and so as to hotels where\r\n     they wait at table, mechanics' shops in which they are\r\n     extensively employed and fairly paid. Let the ablest of the sex\r\n     be called to the lecture-room, to the temperance rostrum, etc.;\r\n     and whenever a post-office falls vacant and a deserving woman is\r\n     competent to fill and willing to take it, let her be appointed,\r\n     as a very few have already been. There will always be some widow\r\n     of a poor clergyman, doctor, lawyer, or other citizens\r\n     prematurely cut off, who will be found qualified for and glad to\r\n     accept such a post if others will suggest her name and procure\r\n     her appointment. Thus abstracting more and more of the competent\r\n     and energetic from the restricted sphere wherein they now\r\n     struggle with their sister for a meager and precarious\r\n     subsistence, the greater mass of self-subsisting women will find\r\n     the demand for their labor gradually increasing and its\r\n     recompense proportionally enhancing. With a larger field and more\r\n     decided usefulness will come a truer and deeper respect; and\r\n     woman, no longer constrained to marry for a position, may always\r\n     wait to marry worthily and in obedience to the dictates of\r\n     sincere affection. Hence constancy, purity, mutual respect, a\r\n     just independence and a little of happiness, may be reasonably\r\n     anticipated.\r\n\r\n          HORACE GREELEY, MARY VAUGHAN, ABRAHAM PRYNE,\r\n                                    SARAH PELLET, MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nALBANY CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 14 AND 15, 1854.\r\n\r\nAlthough the weather was inclement, a large audience assembled in\r\nAssociation Hall on the morning of the 14th, representing the\r\ndifferent portions of the State. Susan B. Anthony called the\r\nConvention to order and read the call, which had been written by Rev.\r\nWm. Henry Channing, and published in all the leading papers of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\n      JUSTICE TO WOMEN--CONVENTION AT ALBANY, FEB. 14 AND 15, 1854.\r\n\r\n     The petition asking for such amendments in the Statutes and\r\n     Constitution of New York as will secure to the women of the State\r\n     legal equality with the men, and to females equally with the\r\n     males a right to suffrage, will be presented to the Legislature\r\n     about the middle of February. We, the Committee appointed at the\r\n     Convention held at Rochester in December--by whose authority\r\n     these petitions were issued--do hereby invite all\r\n     fellow-citizens, of either sex, who are in favor of these\r\n     measures, to assemble in Convention, at Albany, on Tuesday and\r\n     Wednesday, February 14th and 15th.\r\n\r\n     The so-called \"Woman's Rights Movement\" has been so much\r\n     misrepresented, that it is desirable to make the appeal for\r\n     justice earnest, imposing, and effective, by showing how\r\n     eminently equitable are its principles, how wise and practical\r\n     are its measures. Let the serious-minded, generous, hopeful men\r\n     and women of New York then gather in council, to determine\r\n     whether there is anything irrational or revolutionary in the\r\n     proposal that fathers, brothers, husbands, sons, should treat\r\n     their daughters, sisters, wives, and mothers as their peers. This\r\n     reform is designed, by its originators, to make woman womanly in\r\n     the highest sense of that term--to exalt, not to degrade--to\r\n     perfect, not to impair her refining influence in every sphere.\r\n     The demand is made only to take off burdens, to remove\r\n     hindrances, to leave women free as men are free, to follow\r\n     conscience and judgment in all scenes of duty. On what\r\n     ground--except the right of might--do men, claiming to be\r\n     Republicans and Christians, deny to woman privileges which they\r\n     would die to gain and keep for themselves? What evil--what but\r\n     good can come from enlarging woman's power of usefulness? How can\r\n     society be otherwise than a gainer by the increased moral and\r\n     mental influence of one-half of its members? Let these and\r\n     similar questions be fairly, candidly, thoroughly discussed in\r\n     the hearing of the Legislature of New York.\r\n\r\n     Come then, fellow-citizens, to this Convention prepared to speak,\r\n     to hear, to act. Lucy Stone, Wendell Phillips, Mrs. C. I. H.\r\n     Nichols, and other earnest friends of the cause from New England\r\n     and the West, as well as from our own State, are to be with us.\r\n     And may the spirit of Truth preside over all.\r\n\r\n          ELIZABETH C.

B.--Editors please copy.\r\n     _January 23, 1854._\r\n\r\nThe officers[126] of the Convention being reported, Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nCady Stanton (President) took the chair, and after returning her\r\nacknowledgments for the honor conferred, introduced Rev. Antoinette L.\r\nBrown, who read a series of resolutions:\r\n\r\n     1. _Resolved_, That the men who claim to be Christian\r\n     Republicans, and yet class their mothers, sisters, wives, and\r\n     daughters among aliens, criminals, idiots, and minors, unfit to\r\n     be their coequal citizens, are guilty of absurd inconsistency and\r\n     presumption; that for males to govern females, without consent\r\n     asked or granted, is to perpetuate an aristocracy, utterly\r\n     hostile to the principles and spirit of free institutions; and\r\n     that it is time for the people of the United States and every\r\n     State in the Union to put away forever that remnant of despotism\r\n     and feudal oligarchy, the caste of sex.\r\n\r\n     2. _Resolved_, That women are human beings whose rights\r\n     correspond with their duties; that they are endowed with\r\n     conscience, reason, affection, and energy, for the use of which\r\n     they are individually responsible; that like men they are bound\r\n     to advance the cause of truth, justice, and universal good in the\r\n     society and nation of which they are members; that in these\r\n     United States women constitute one-half the people; men\r\n     constitute the other half; that women are no more free in honor\r\n     than men are to withhold their influence and example from\r\n     patriotic and philanthropic movements, and that men who deny\r\n     women to be their peers, and who shut them out from exercising a\r\n     fair share of power in the body politic, are arrogant usurpers,\r\n     whose only apology is to be found in prejudices transmitted from\r\n     half-civilized and half-christianized ages.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The family is the nursery of the State and the\r\n     Church--the God-appointed seminary of the human race. Therefore\r\n\r\n     3. _Resolved_, That the family, by men as well as women, should\r\n     be held more sacred than all other institutions; that it may not,\r\n     without sin, be abandoned or neglected by fathers any more than\r\n     by mothers, for the sake of any of the institutions devised by\r\n     men--for the government of the State or the Nation any more than\r\n     for the voluntary association of social reformers.\r\n\r\n     4. _Resolved_, That women's duties and rights as daughters,\r\n     sisters, wives, and mothers, are not bounded within the circle of\r\n     home; that in view of the sacredness of their relations, they are\r\n     not free to desert their fathers, brothers, husbands, and sons\r\n     amidst scenes of business, politics, and pleasure, and to leave\r\n     them alone in their struggles and temptations, but that as\r\n     members of the human family, for the sake of human advancement,\r\n     women are bound as widely as possible to give to men the\r\n     influence of their aid and presence; and finally, that universal\r\n     experience attests that those nations and societies are most\r\n     orderly, high-toned, and rich in varied prosperity, where women\r\n     most freely intermingle with men in all spheres of active life.\r\n\r\n     5. _Resolved_, That the fundamental error of the whole structure\r\n     of legislation and custom, whereby women are practically\r\n     sustained, even in this republic, is the preposterous fiction of\r\n     law, that in the eye of the law the husband and wife are one\r\n     person, that person being the husband; that this falsehood\r\n     itself, the deposit of barbarism, tends perpetually to brutalize\r\n     the marriage relation by subjecting wives as irresponsible tools\r\n     to the capricious authority of husbands; that this degradation of\r\n     married women re-acts inevitably to depress the condition of\r\n     single women, by impairing their own self-respect and man's\r\n     respect for them; and that the final result is that system of\r\n     tutelage miscalled protection, by which the industry of women is\r\n     kept on half-pay, their affections trifled with, their energies\r\n     crippled, and even their noblest aspirations wasted away in vain\r\n     efforts, ennui, and regret.\r\n\r\n     6. _Resolved_, That in consistency with the spirit and intent of\r\n     the Statutes of New York, enacted in 1848 and 1849, the design of\r\n     which was to secure to married women the entire control of their\r\n     property, it is the duty of the Legislature to make such\r\n     amendments in the laws of the State as will enable married women\r\n     to conduct business, to form contracts, to sue and be sued in\r\n     their own names--to receive and hold the gains of their industry,\r\n     and be liable for their own debts so far as their interests are\r\n     separate from those of their husbands--to become joint owners in\r\n     the joint earnings of the partnership, so far as these interests\r\n     are identified--to bear witness for or against their husbands,\r\n     and generally to be held responsible for their own deeds.\r\n\r\n     7. _Resolved_, That as acquiring property by all just and\r\n     laudable means, and the holding and devising of the same is a\r\n     human right, women married and single are entitled to this right,\r\n     and all the usages or laws which withhold it from them are\r\n     manifestly unjust.\r\n\r\n     8. _Resolved_, That every argument in favor of universal suffrage\r\n     for males is equally in favor of universal suffrage for females,\r\n     and therefore if men may claim the right of suffrage as necessary\r\n     to the protection of all their rights in any Government, so may\r\n     women for the same reason.\r\n\r\n     9. _Resolved_, That if man as man, has any peculiar claim to a\r\n     representation in the government, for himself, woman as woman,\r\n     has a paramount claim to an equal representation for herself.\r\n\r\n     10. _Resolved_, Therefore, that whether you regard woman as like\r\n     or unlike man, she is in either case entitled to an equal joint\r\n     participation with him in all civil rights and duties.\r\n\r\n     11. _Resolved_, That although men should grant us every specific\r\n     claim, we should hold them all by favor rather than right, unless\r\n     they also concede, and we exercise, the right of protecting\r\n     ourselves by the elective franchise.\r\n\r\n     12. _Resolved_, That if the essence of a trial by an \"impartial\r\n     jury\" be a trial by one's own equals, then has never a woman\r\n     enjoyed that privilege in the hour of her need as a culprit. We,\r\n     therefore, respectfully demand of our Legislature that, at least,\r\n     the right of such trial by jury be accorded to women equally with\r\n     men--that women be eligible to the jury-box, whenever one of\r\n     their own sex is arraigned at the bar.\r\n\r\n     13. _Resolved_, That could the women of the State be heard on\r\n     this question, we should find the mass with us; as the mother's\r\n     reluctance to give up the guardianship of her children; the\r\n     wife's unwillingness to submit to the abuse of a drunken husband,\r\n     the general sentiment in favor of equal property rights, and the\r\n     thousands of names in favor of our petition, raised with so\r\n     little effort, conclusively prove.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The right of petition is guaranteed to every member of\r\n     this republic; therefore\r\n\r\n     14. _Resolved_, That it is the highest duty of legislators\r\n     impartially to investigate all claims for the redress of wrong,\r\n     and alter and amend such laws as prevent the administration of\r\n     justice and equal rights to all.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That all true-hearted men and women pledge themselves\r\n     never to relinquish their unceasing efforts in behalf of the full\r\n     and equal rights of women, until we have effaced the stigma\r\n     resting on this republic, that while it theoretically proclaims\r\n     that all men are created equal, deprives one-half of its members\r\n     of the enjoyment of the rights and privileges possessed by the\r\n     other.\r\n\r\nThe salient points of the question as embodied in the resolutions and\r\nthe address were ably presented by William Henry Channing, Samuel J.\r\nMay, Mrs. Nichols, Mrs. Rose, Mrs. Love, Miss Brown, Miss Anthony,\r\nMrs. Jenkins, Hon. William Hay, and Giles B. Stebbins. At the evening\r\nsession Mrs. Stanton read her address prepared for the Legislature,\r\nwhich Miss Anthony had stereotyped and published. A copy was laid on\r\nthe desk of every legislator, and twenty thousand scattered like\r\nsnow-flakes over the State.\r\n\r\n                          MRS. STANTON'S ADDRESS.\r\n\r\n     _To the Legislature of the State of New York_:\r\n\r\n     \"The thinking minds of all nations call for change. There is a\r\n     deep-lying struggle in the whole fabric of society; a boundless,\r\n     grinding collision of the New with the Old.\"\r\n\r\n     The tyrant, Custom, has been summoned before the bar of\r\n     Common-Sense. His majesty no longer awes the multitude--his\r\n     sceptre is broken--his crown is trampled in the dust--the\r\n     sentence of death is pronounced upon him. All nations, ranks, and\r\n     classes have, in turn, questioned and repudiated his authority;\r\n     and now, that the monster is chained and caged, timid woman, on\r\n     tiptoe, comes to look him in the face, and to demand of her brave\r\n     sires and sons, who have struck stout blows for liberty, if, in\r\n     this change of dynasty, she, too, shall find relief. Yes,\r\n     gentlemen, in republican America, in the nineteenth century, we,\r\n     the daughters of the revolutionary heroes of '76, demand at your\r\n     hands the redress of our grievances--a revision of your State\r\n     Constitution--a new code of laws. Permit us then, as briefly as\r\n     possible, to call your attention to the legal disabilities under\r\n     which we labor.\r\n\r\n     1st. Look at the position of woman as woman. It is not enough for\r\n     us that, by your laws we are permitted to live and breathe, to\r\n     claim the necessaries of life from our legal protectors--to pay\r\n     the penalty of our crimes; we demand the full recognition of all\r\n     our rights as citizens of the Empire State. We are persons;\r\n     native, free-born citizens; property-holders, tax-payers; yet are\r\n     we denied the exercise of our right to the elective franchise. We\r\n     support ourselves, and, in part, your schools, colleges,\r\n     churches, your poor-houses, jails, prisons, the army, the navy,\r\n     the whole machinery of government, and yet we have no voice in\r\n     your councils. We have every qualification required by the\r\n     Constitution, necessary to the legal voter, but the one of sex.\r\n     We are moral, virtuous, and intelligent, and in all respects\r\n     quite equal to the proud white man himself, and yet by your laws\r\n     we are classed with idiots, lunatics, and negroes; and though we\r\n     do not feel honored by the place assigned us, yet, in fact, our\r\n     legal position is lower than that of either; for the negro can be\r\n     raised to the dignity of a voter if he possess himself of $250;\r\n     the lunatic can vote in his moments of sanity, and the idiot,\r\n     too, if he be a male one, and not more than nine-tenths a fool;\r\n     but we, who have guided great movements of charity, established\r\n     missions, edited journals, published works on history, economy,\r\n     and statistics; who have governed nations, led armies, filled the\r\n     professor's chair, taught philosophy and mathematics to the\r\n     savants of our age, discovered planets, piloted ships across the\r\n     sea, are denied the most sacred rights of citizens, because,\r\n     forsooth, we came not into this republic crowned with the dignity\r\n     of manhood! Woman is theoretically absolved from all allegiance\r\n     to the laws of the State. Sec. 1, Bill of Rights, 2 R. S., 301,\r\n     says that no authority can, on any pretence whatever, be\r\n     exercised over the citizens of this State but such as is or shall\r\n     be derived from, and granted by the people of this State.\r\n\r\n     Now, gentlemen, we would fain know by what authority you have\r\n     disfranchised one-half the people of this State? You who have so\r\n     boldly taken possession of the bulwarks of this republic, show us\r\n     your credentials, and thus prove your exclusive right to govern,\r\n     not only yourselves, but us. Judge Hurlburt, who has long\r\n     occupied a high place at the bar in this State, and who recently\r\n     retired with honor from the bench of the Supreme Court, in his\r\n     profound work on Human Rights, has pronounced your present\r\n     position rank usurpation. Can it be that here, where we\r\n     acknowledge no royal blood, no apostolic descent, that you, who\r\n     have declared that all men were created equal--that governments\r\n     derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, would\r\n     willingly build up an aristocracy that places the ignorant and\r\n     vulgar above the educated and refined--the alien and the\r\n     ditch-digger above the authors and poets of the day--an\r\n     aristocracy that would raise the sons above the mothers that bore\r\n     them? Would that the men who can sanction a Constitution so\r\n     opposed to the genius of this government, who can enact and\r\n     execute laws so degrading to womankind, had sprung, Minerva-like,\r\n     from the brains of their fathers, that the matrons of this\r\n     republic need not blush to own their sons!\r\n\r\n     Woman's position, under our free institutions, is much lower than\r\n     under the monarchy of England. \"In England the idea of woman\r\n     holding official station is not so strange as in the United\r\n     States. The Countess of Pembroke, Dorset, and Montgomery held the\r\n     office of hereditary sheriff of Westmoreland, and exercised it in\r\n     person. At the assizes at Appleby, she sat with the judges on the\r\n     bench. In a reported case, it is stated by counsel, and\r\n     substantially assented to by the court, that a woman is capable\r\n     of serving in almost all the offices of the kingdom, such as\r\n     those of queen, marshal, great chamberlain and constable of\r\n     England, the champion of England, commissioner of sewers,\r\n     governor of work-house, sexton, keeper of the prison, of the\r\n     gate-house of the dean and chapter of Westminster, returning\r\n     officer for members of Parliament, and constable, the latter of\r\n     which is in some respects judicial. The office of jailor is\r\n     frequently exercised by a woman.\r\n\r\n     \"In the United States a woman may administer on the effects of\r\n     her deceased husband, and she has occasionally held a subordinate\r\n     place in the post-office department. She has therefore a sort of\r\n     post mortem, post-mistress notoriety; but with the exception of\r\n     handling letters of administration and letters mailed, she is the\r\n     submissive creature of the old common law.\" True, the unmarried\r\n     woman has a right to the property she inherits and the money she\r\n     earns, but she is taxed without representation. And here again\r\n     you place the negro, so unjustly degraded by you, in a superior\r\n     position to your own wives and mothers; for colored males, if\r\n     possessed of a certain amount of property and certain other\r\n     qualifications, can vote, but if they do not have these\r\n     qualifications they are not subject to direct taxation; wherein\r\n     they have the advantage of woman, she being subject to taxation\r\n     for whatever amount she may possess. (Constitution of New York,\r\n     Article 2, Sec. 2). But, say you, are not all women sufficiently\r\n     represented by their fathers, husbands, and brothers? Let your\r\n     statute books answer the question.\r\n\r\n     Again we demand in criminal cases that most sacred of all rights,\r\n     trial by a jury of our own peers. The establishment of trial by\r\n     jury is of so early a date that its beginning is lost in\r\n     antiquity; but the right of trial by a jury of one's own peers is\r\n     a great progressive step of advanced civilization. No rank of men\r\n     have ever been satisfied with being tried by jurors higher or\r\n     lower in the civil or political scale than themselves; for\r\n     jealousy on the one hand, and contempt on the other, has ever\r\n     effectually blinded the eyes of justice. Hence, all along the\r\n     pages of history, we find the king, the noble, the peasant, the\r\n     cardinal, the priest, the layman, each in turn protesting against\r\n     the authority of the tribunal before which they were summoned to\r\n     appear. Charles the First refused to recognize the competency of\r\n     the tribunal which condemned him: For how, said he, can subjects\r\n     judge a king? The stern descendants of our Pilgrim Fathers\r\n     refused to answer for their crimes before an English Parliament.\r\n     For how, said they, can a king judge rebels? And shall woman here\r\n     consent to be tried by her liege lord, who has dubbed himself\r\n     law-maker, judge, juror, and sheriff too?--whose power, though\r\n     sanctioned by Church and State, has no foundation in justice and\r\n     equity, and is a bold assumption of our inalienable rights. In\r\n     England a Parliament-lord could challenge a jury where a knight\r\n     was not empanneled; an alien could demand a jury composed half of\r\n     his own countrymen; or, in some special cases, juries were even\r\n     constituted entirely of women. Having seen that man fails to do\r\n     justice to woman in her best estate, to the virtuous, the noble,\r\n     the true of our sex, should we trust to his tender mercies the\r\n     weak, the ignorant, the morally insane? It is not to be denied\r\n     that the interests of man and woman in the present undeveloped\r\n     state of the race, and under the existing social arrangements,\r\n     are and must be antagonistic. The nobleman can not make just laws\r\n     for the peasant; the slaveholder for the slave; neither can man\r\n     make and execute just laws for woman, because in each case, the\r\n     one in power fails to apply the immutable principles of right to\r\n     any grade but his own.\r\n\r\n     Shall an erring woman be dragged before a bar of grim-visaged\r\n     judges, lawyers, and jurors, there to be grossly questioned in\r\n     public on subjects which women scarce breathe in secret to one\r\n     another? Shall the most sacred relations of life be called up and\r\n     rudely scanned by men who, by their own admission, are so coarse\r\n     that women could not meet them even at the polls without\r\n     contamination? and yet shall she find there no woman's face or\r\n     voice to pity and defend? Shall the frenzied mother, who, to save\r\n     herself and child from exposure and disgrace, ended the life\r\n     that had but just begun, be dragged before such a tribunal to\r\n     answer for her crime? How can man enter into the feelings of that\r\n     mother? How can he judge of the agonies of soul that impelled her\r\n     to such an outrage of maternal instincts? How can he weigh the\r\n     mountain of sorrow that crushed that mother's heart when she\r\n     wildly tossed her helpless babe into the cold waters of the\r\n     midnight sea? Where is he who by false vows thus blasted this\r\n     trusting woman? Had that helpless child no claims on his\r\n     protection? Ah, he is freely abroad in the dignity of manhood, in\r\n     the pulpit, on the bench, in the professor's chair. The\r\n     imprisonment of his victim and the death of his child, detract\r\n     not a tithe from his standing and complacency. His peers made the\r\n     law, and shall law-makers lay nets for those of their own rank?\r\n     Shall laws which come from the logical brain of man take\r\n     cognizance of violence done to the moral and affectional nature\r\n     which predominates, as is said, in woman?\r\n\r\n     Statesmen of New York, whose daughters, guarded by your\r\n     affection, and lapped amidst luxuries which your indulgence\r\n     spreads, care more for their nodding plumes and velvet trains\r\n     than for the statute laws by which their persons and properties\r\n     are held--who, blinded by custom and prejudice to the degraded\r\n     position which they and their sisters occupy in the civil scale,\r\n     haughtily claim that they already have all the rights they want,\r\n     how, think ye, you would feel to see a daughter summoned for such\r\n     a crime--and remember these daughters are but human--before such\r\n     a tribunal? Would it not, in that hour, be some consolation to\r\n     see that she was surrounded by the wise and virtuous of her own\r\n     sex; by those who had known the depth of a mother's love and the\r\n     misery of a lover's falsehood; to know that to these she could\r\n     make her confession, and from them receive her sentence? If so,\r\n     then listen to our just demands and make such a change in your\r\n     laws as will secure to every woman tried in your courts, an\r\n     impartial jury. At this moment among the hundreds of women who\r\n     are shut up in prisons in this State, not one has enjoyed that\r\n     most sacred of all rights--that right which you would die to\r\n     defend for yourselves--trial by a jury of one's peers.\r\n\r\n     2d. Look at the position of woman as wife. Your laws relating to\r\n     marriage--founded as they are on the old common law of England, a\r\n     compound of barbarous usages, but partially modified by\r\n     progressive civilization--are in open violation of our\r\n     enlightened ideas of justice, and of the holiest feelings of our\r\n     nature. If you take the highest view of marriage, as a Divine\r\n     relation, which love alone can constitute and sanctify, then of\r\n     course human legislation can only recognize it. Men can neither\r\n     bind nor loose its ties, for that prerogative belongs to God\r\n     alone, who makes man and woman, and the laws of attraction by\r\n     which they are united. But if you regard marriage as a civil\r\n     contract, then let it be subject to the same laws which control\r\n     all other contracts. Do not make it a kind of half-human,\r\n     half-divine institution, which you may build up, but can not\r\n     regulate. Do not, by your special legislation for this one kind\r\n     of contract, involve yourselves in the grossest absurdities and\r\n     contradictions.\r\n\r\n     So long as by your laws no man can make a contract for a horse or\r\n     piece of land until he is twenty-one years of age, and by which\r\n     contract he is not bound if any deception has been practiced, or\r\n     if the party contracting has not fulfilled his part of the\r\n     agreement--so long as the parties in all mere civil contracts\r\n     retain their identity and all the power and independence they had\r\n     before contracting, with the full right to dissolve all\r\n     partnerships and contracts for any reason, at the will and option\r\n     of the parties themselves, upon what principle of civil\r\n     jurisprudence do you permit the boy of fourteen and the girl of\r\n     twelve, in violation of every natural law, to make a contract\r\n     more momentous in importance than any other, and then hold them\r\n     to it, come what may, the whole of their natural lives, in spite\r\n     of disappointment, deception, and misery? Then, too, the signing\r\n     of this contract is instant civil death to one of the parties.\r\n     The woman who but yesterday was sued on bended knee, who stood so\r\n     high in the scale of being as to make an agreement on equal terms\r\n     with a proud Saxon man, to-day has no civil existence, no social\r\n     freedom. The wife who inherits no property holds about the same\r\n     legal position that does the slave on the Southern plantation.\r\n     She can own nothing, sell nothing. She has no right even to the\r\n     wages she earns; her person, her time, her services are the\r\n     property of another. She can not testify, in many cases, against\r\n     her husband. She can get no redress for wrongs in her own name in\r\n     any court of justice. She can neither sue nor be sued. She is not\r\n     held morally responsible for any crime committed in the presence\r\n     of her husband, so completely is her very existence supposed by\r\n     the law to be merged in that of another. Think of it; your wives\r\n     may be thieves, libelers, burglars, incendiaries, and for crimes\r\n     like these they are not held amenable to the laws of the land, if\r\n     they but commit them in your dread presence. For them, alas!\r\n     there is no higher law than the will of man. Herein behold the\r\n     bloated conceit of these Petruchios of the law, who seem to say:\r\n\r\n          \"Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret,\r\n          I will be master of what is mine own;\r\n          She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,\r\n          My household stuff, my field, my barn,\r\n          My horse, my ox, my ass, my anything;\r\n          And here she stands, touch her whoever dare;\r\n          I'll bring my action on the proudest he,\r\n          That stops my way, in Padua.\"\r\n\r\n     How could man ever look thus on woman? She, at whose feet\r\n     Socrates learned wisdom--she, who gave to the world a Saviour,\r\n     and witnessed alike the adoration of the Magi and the agonies of\r\n     the cross. How could such a being, so blessed and honored, ever\r\n     become the ignoble, servile, cringing slave, with whom the fear\r\n     of man could be paramount to the sacred dictates of conscience\r\n     and the holy love of Heaven? By the common law of England, the\r\n     spirit of which has been but too faithfully incorporated into our\r\n     statute law, a husband has a right to whip his wife with a rod\r\n     not larger than his thumb, to shut her up in a room, and\r\n     administer whatever moderate chastisement he may deem necessary\r\n     to insure obedience to his wishes, and for her healthful moral\r\n     development! He can forbid all persons harboring or trusting her\r\n     on his account. He can deprive her of all social intercourse with\r\n     her nearest and dearest friends. If by great economy she\r\n     accumulates a small sum, which for future need she deposit,\r\n     little by little, in a savings bank, the husband has a right to\r\n     draw it out, at his option, to use it as he may see fit.\r\n\r\n     \"Husband is entitled to wife's credit or business talents\r\n     (whenever their inter-marriage may have occurred); and goods\r\n     purchased by her on her own credit, with his consent, while\r\n     cohabiting with him, can be seized and sold in execution against\r\n     him for his own debts, and this, though she carry on business in\r\n     her own name.\"--7 _Howard's Practice Reports, 105, Lovett agt.\r\n     Robinson and Whitbeck, sheriff, etc_.\r\n\r\n     \"No letters of administration shall be granted to a person\r\n     convicted of infamous crime; nor to any one incapable by law of\r\n     making a contract; nor to a person not a citizen of the United\r\n     States, unless such person reside within this State; nor to any\r\n     one who is under twenty-one years of age; nor to any person who\r\n     shall be adjudged incompetent by the surrogate to execute duties\r\n     of such trust, by reason of drunkenness, improvidence, or want of\r\n     understanding, nor to any married woman; but where a married\r\n     woman is entitled to administration, the same may be granted to\r\n     her husband in her right and behalf.\"\r\n\r\n     There is nothing that an unruly wife might do against which the\r\n     husband has not sufficient protection in the law. But not so with\r\n     the wife. If she have a worthless husband, a confirmed drunkard,\r\n     a villain, or a vagrant, he has still all the rights of a man, a\r\n     husband, and a father. Though the whole support of the family be\r\n     thrown upon the wife, if the wages she earns be paid to her by\r\n     her employer, the husband can receive them again. If, by\r\n     unwearied industry and perseverance, she can earn for herself and\r\n     children a patch of ground and a shed to cover them, the husband\r\n     can strip her of all her hard earnings, turn her and her little\r\n     ones out in the cold northern blast, take the clothes from their\r\n     backs, the bread from their mouths; all this by your laws may he\r\n     do, and has he done, oft and again, to satisfy the rapacity of\r\n     that monster in human form, the rum-seller.\r\n\r\n     But the wife who is so fortunate as to have inherited property,\r\n     has, by the new law in this State, been redeemed from her lost\r\n     condition. She is no longer a legal nonentity. This property law,\r\n     if fairly construed, will overturn the whole code relating to\r\n     woman and property. The right to property implies the right to\r\n     buy and sell, to will and bequeath, and herein is the dawning of\r\n     a civil existence for woman, for now the \"femme covert\" must have\r\n     the right to make contracts. So, get ready, gentlemen; the\r\n     \"little justice\" will be coming to you one day, deed in hand, for\r\n     your acknowledgment. When he asks you \"if you sign without fear\r\n     or compulsion,\" say yes, boldly, as we do. Then, too, the right\r\n     to will is ours. Now what becomes of the \"tenant for life\"? Shall\r\n     he, the happy husband of a millionaire, who has lived in yonder\r\n     princely mansion in the midst of plenty and elegance, be cut down\r\n     in a day to the use of one-third of this estate and a few hundred\r\n     a year, as long he remains her widower? And should he, in spite\r\n     of this bounty on celibacy, impelled by his affections, marry\r\n     again, choosing for a wife a woman as poor as himself, shall he\r\n     be thrown penniless on the cold world--this child of fortune,\r\n     enervated by ease and luxury, henceforth to be dependent wholly\r\n     on his own resources? Poor man! He would be rich, though, in the\r\n     sympathies of many women who have passed through just such an\r\n     ordeal. But what is property without the right to protect that\r\n     property by law? It is mockery to say a certain estate is mine,\r\n     if, without my consent, you have the right to tax me when and how\r\n     you please, while I have no voice in making the tax-gatherer,\r\n     the legislator, or the law. The right to property will, of\r\n     necessity, compel us in due time to the exercise of our right to\r\n     the elective franchise, and then naturally follows the right to\r\n     hold office.\r\n\r\n     3d. Look at the position of woman as widow. Whenever we attempt\r\n     to point out the wrongs of the wife, those who would have us\r\n     believe that the laws can not be improved, point us to the\r\n     privileges, powers, and claims of the widow. Let us look into\r\n     these a little. Behold in yonder humble house a married pair,\r\n     who, for long years, have lived together, childless and alone.\r\n     Those few acres of well-tilled land, with the small, white house\r\n     that looks so cheerful through its vines and flowers, attest the\r\n     honest thrift and simple taste of its owners. This man and woman,\r\n     by their hard days' labor, have made this home their own. Here\r\n     they live in peace and plenty, happy in the hope that they may\r\n     dwell together securely under their own vine and fig-tree for the\r\n     few years that remain to them, and that under the shadow of these\r\n     trees, planted by their own hands, and in the midst of their\r\n     household gods, so loved and familiar, they may take their last\r\n     farewell of earth. But, alas for human hopes! the husband dies,\r\n     and without a will, and the stricken widow, at one fell blow,\r\n     loses the companion of her youth, her house and home, and half\r\n     the little sum she had in bank. For the law, which takes no\r\n     cognizance of widows left with twelve children and not one cent,\r\n     instantly spies out this widow, takes account of her effects, and\r\n     announces to her the startling intelligence that but one-third of\r\n     the house and lot, and one-half the personal property, are hers.\r\n     The law has other favorites with whom she must share the\r\n     hard-earned savings of years. In this dark hour of grief, the\r\n     coarse minions of the law gather round the widow's hearth-stone,\r\n     and, in the name of justice, outrage all natural sense of right;\r\n     mock at the sacredness of human love, and with cold familiarity\r\n     proceed to place a moneyed value on the old arm-chair, in which,\r\n     but a few brief hours since, she closed the eyes that had ever\r\n     beamed on her with kindness and affection; on the solemn clock in\r\n     the corner, that told the hour he passed away; on every garment\r\n     with which his form and presence were associated, and on every\r\n     article of comfort and convenience that the house contained, even\r\n     down to the knives and forks and spoons--and the widow saw it\r\n     all--and when the work was done, she gathered up what the law\r\n     allowed her and went forth to seek another home! This is the\r\n     much-talked-of widow's dower. Behold the magnanimity of the law\r\n     in allowing the widow to retain a life interest in one-third the\r\n     landed estate, and one-half the personal property of her husband,\r\n     and taking the lion's share to itself! Had she died first, the\r\n     house and land would all have been the husband's still. No one\r\n     would have dared to intrude upon the privacy of his home, or to\r\n     molest him in his sacred retreat of sorrow. How, I ask you, can\r\n     that be called justice, which makes such a distinction as this\r\n     between man and woman?\r\n\r\n     By management, economy, and industry, our widow is able, in a few\r\n     years, to redeem her house and home. But the law never loses\r\n     sight of the purse, no matter how low in the scale of being its\r\n     owner may be. It sends its officers round every year to gather in\r\n     the harvest for the public crib, and no widow who owns a piece of\r\n     land two feet square ever escapes this reckoning. Our widow, too,\r\n     who has now twice earned her home, has her annual tax to pay\r\n     also--a tribute of gratitude that she is permitted to breathe the\r\n     free air of this republic, where \"taxation without\r\n     representation,\" by such worthies as John Hancock and Samuel\r\n     Adams, has been declared \"intolerable tyranny.\" Having glanced at\r\n     the magnanimity of the law in its dealings with the widow, let us\r\n     see how the individual man, under the influence of such laws,\r\n     doles out justice to his helpmate. The husband has the absolute\r\n     right to will away his property as he may see fit. If he has\r\n     children, he can divide his property among them, leaving his wife\r\n     her third only of the landed estate, thus making her a dependent\r\n     on the bounty of her own children. A man with thirty thousand\r\n     dollars in personal property, may leave his wife but a few\r\n     hundred a year, as long as she remains his widow.\r\n\r\n     The cases are without number where women, who have lived in ease\r\n     and elegance, at the death of their husbands have, by will, been\r\n     reduced to the bare necessaries of life. The man who leaves his\r\n     wife the sole guardian of his property and children is an\r\n     exception to the general rule. Man has ever manifested a wish\r\n     that the world should indeed be a blank to the companion whom he\r\n     leaves behind him. The Hindoo makes that wish a law, and burns\r\n     the widow on the funeral pyre of her husband; but the civilized\r\n     man, impressed with a different view of the sacredness of life,\r\n     takes a less summary mode of drawing his beloved partner after\r\n     him; he does it by the deprivation and starvation of the flesh,\r\n     and the humiliation and mortification of the spirit. In\r\n     bequeathing to the wife just enough to keep soul and body\r\n     together, man seems to lose sight of the fact that woman, like\r\n     himself, takes great pleasure in acts of benevolence and charity.\r\n     It is but just, therefore, that she should have it in her power\r\n     to give during her life, and to will away at her death, as her\r\n     benevolence or obligations might prompt her to do.\r\n\r\n     4th. Look at the position of woman as mother. There is no human\r\n     love so strong and steadfast as that of the mother for her child;\r\n     yet behold how ruthless are your laws touching this most sacred\r\n     relation. Nature has clearly made the mother the guardian of the\r\n     child; but man, in his inordinate love of power, does continually\r\n     set nature and nature's laws at open defiance. The father may\r\n     apprentice his child, bind him out to a trade, without the\r\n     mother's consent--yea, in direct opposition to her most earnest\r\n     entreaties, prayers and tears.\r\n\r\n     He may apprentice his son to a gamester or rum-seller, and thus\r\n     cancel his debts of _honor_. By the abuse of this absolute power,\r\n     he may bind his daughter to the owner of a brothel, and, by the\r\n     degradation of his child, supply his daily wants: and such\r\n     things, gentlemen, have been done in our very midst. Moreover,\r\n     the father, about to die, may bind out all his children wherever\r\n     and to whomsoever he may see fit, and thus, in fact, will away\r\n     the guardianship of all his children from the mother. The Revised\r\n     Statutes of New York provide that \"every father, whether of full\r\n     age or a minor, of a child to be born, or of any living child\r\n     under the age of twenty-one years, and unmarried, may by his deed\r\n     or last will, duly executed, dispose of the custody and tuition\r\n     of such child during its minority, or for any less time, to any\r\n     person or persons, in possession or remainder.\" 2 R. S., page\r\n     150, sec. 1. Thus, by your laws, the child is the absolute\r\n     property of the father, wholly at his disposal in life or at\r\n     death.\r\n\r\n     In case of separation, the law gives the children to the father;\r\n     no matter what his character or condition. At this very time we\r\n     can point you to noble, virtuous, well-educated mothers in this\r\n     State, who have abandoned their husbands for their profligacy and\r\n     confirmed drunkenness. All these have been robbed of their\r\n     children, who are in the custody of the husband, under the care\r\n     of his relatives, whilst the mothers are permitted to see them\r\n     but at stated intervals. But, said one of these mothers, with a\r\n     grandeur of attitude and manner worthy the noble Roman matron in\r\n     the palmiest days of that republic, I would rather never see my\r\n     child again, than be the medium to hand down the low animal\r\n     nature of its father, to stamp degradation on the brow of another\r\n     innocent being. It is enough that one child of his shall call me\r\n     mother.\r\n\r\n     If you are far-sighted statesmen, and do wisely judge of the\r\n     interests of this commonwealth, you will so shape your future\r\n     laws as to encourage woman to take the high moral ground that the\r\n     father of her children must be great and good. Instead of your\r\n     present laws, which make the mother and her children the victims\r\n     of vice and license, you might rather pass laws prohibiting to\r\n     all drunkards, libertines, and fools, the rights of husbands and\r\n     fathers. Do not the hundreds of laughing idiots that are crowding\r\n     into our asylums, appeal to the wisdom of our statesmen for some\r\n     new laws on marriage--to the mothers of this day for a higher,\r\n     purer morality?\r\n\r\n     Again, as the condition of the child always follows that of the\r\n     mother, and as by the sanction of your laws the father may beat\r\n     the mother, so may he the child. What mother can not bear me\r\n     witness to untold sufferings which cruel, vindictive fathers have\r\n     visited upon their helpless children? Who ever saw a human being\r\n     that would not abuse unlimited power? Base and ignoble must that\r\n     man be who, let the provocation be what it may, would strike a\r\n     woman; but he who would lacerate a trembling child is unworthy\r\n     the name of man. A mother's love can be no protection to a child;\r\n     she can not appeal to you to save it from a father's cruelty, for\r\n     the laws take no cognizance of the mother's most grievous wrongs.\r\n     Neither at home nor abroad can a mother protect her son. Look at\r\n     the temptations that surround the paths of our youth at every\r\n     step; look at the gambling and drinking saloons, the club rooms,\r\n     the dens of infamy and abomination that infest all our villages\r\n     and cities--slowly but surely sapping the very foundations of all\r\n     virtue and strength.\r\n\r\n     By your laws, all these abominable resorts are permitted. It is\r\n     folly to talk of a mother moulding the character of her son, when\r\n     all mankind, backed up by law and public sentiment, conspire to\r\n     destroy her influence. But when woman's moral power shall speak\r\n     through the ballot-box, then shall her influence be seen and\r\n     felt; then, in our legislative debates, such questions as the\r\n     canal tolls on salt, the improvement of rivers and harbors, and\r\n     the claims of Mr. Smith for damages against the State, would be\r\n     secondary to the consideration of the legal existence of all\r\n     these public resorts, which lure our youth on to excessive\r\n     indulgence and destruction.\r\n\r\n     Many times and oft it has been asked us, with, unaffected\r\n     seriousness, \"What do you women want? What are you aiming at?\"\r\n     Many have manifested a laudable curiosity to know what the wives\r\n     and daughters could complain of in republican America, where\r\n     their sires and sons have so bravely fought for freedom and\r\n     gloriously secured their independence, trampling all tyranny,\r\n     bigotry, and caste in the dust, and declaring to a waiting world\r\n     the divine truth that all men are created equal. What can woman\r\n     want under such a government? Admit a radical difference in sex,\r\n     and you demand different spheres--water for fish, and air for\r\n     birds.\r\n\r\n     It is impossible to make the Southern planter believe that his\r\n     slave feels and reasons just as he does--that injustice and\r\n     subjection are as galling as to him--that the degradation of\r\n     living by the will of another, the mere dependent on his caprice,\r\n     at the mercy of his passions, is as keenly felt by him as his\r\n     master. If you can force on his unwilling vision a vivid picture\r\n     of the negro's wrongs, and for a moment touch his soul, his logic\r\n     brings him instant consolation. He says, the slave does not feel\r\n     this as I would. Here, gentlemen, is our difficulty: When we\r\n     plead our cause before the law-makers and savants of the\r\n     republic, they can not take in the idea that men and women are\r\n     alike; and so long as the mass rest in this delusion, the public\r\n     mind will not be so much startled by the revelations made of the\r\n     injustice and degradation of woman's position as by the fact that\r\n     she should at length wake up to a sense of it.\r\n\r\n     If you, too, are thus deluded, what avails it that we show by\r\n     your statute books that your laws are unjust--that woman is the\r\n     victim of avarice and power? What avails it that we point out the\r\n     wrongs of woman in social life; the victim of passion and lust?\r\n     You scorn the thought that she has any natural love of freedom\r\n     burning in her breast, any clear perception of justice urging her\r\n     on to demand her rights.\r\n\r\n     Would to God you could know the burning indignation that fills\r\n     woman's soul when she turns over the pages of your statute books,\r\n     and sees there how like feudal barons you freemen hold your\r\n     women. Would that you could know the humiliation she feels for\r\n     sex, when she thinks of all the beardless boys in your law\r\n     offices, learning these ideas of one-sided justice--taking their\r\n     first lessons in contempt for all womankind--being indoctrinated\r\n     into the incapacities of their mothers, and the lordly, absolute\r\n     rights of man over all women, children, and property, and to know\r\n     that these are to be our future presidents, judges, husbands, and\r\n     fathers; in sorrow we exclaim, alas! for that nation whose sons\r\n     bow not in loyalty to woman. The mother is the first object of\r\n     the child's veneration and love, and they who root out this holy\r\n     sentiment, dream not of the blighting effect it has on the boy\r\n     and the man. The impression left on law students, fresh from your\r\n     statute books, is most unfavorable to woman's influence; hence\r\n     you see but few lawyers chivalrous and high-toned in their\r\n     sentiments toward woman. They can not escape the legal view\r\n     which, by constant reading, has become familiarized to their\r\n     minds: \"_Femme covert_,\" \"dower,\" \"widow's claims,\" \"protection,\"\r\n     \"incapacities,\" \"incumbrance,\" is written on the brow of every\r\n     woman they meet.\r\n\r\n     But if, gentlemen, you take the ground that the sexes are alike,\r\n     and, therefore, you are our faithful representatives--then why\r\n     all these special laws for woman? Would not one code answer for\r\n     all of like needs and wants? Christ's golden rule is better than\r\n     all the special legislation that the ingenuity of man can devise:\r\n     \"Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.\" This, men\r\n     and brethren, is all we ask at your hands. We ask no better laws\r\n     than those you have made for yourselves. We need no other\r\n     protection than that which your present laws secure to you.\r\n\r\n     In conclusion, then, let us say, in behalf of the women of this\r\n     State, we ask for all that you have asked for yourselves in the\r\n     progress of your development, since the _Mayflower_ cast anchor\r\n     beside Plymouth rock; and simply on the ground that the rights of\r\n     every human being are the same and identical. You may say that\r\n     the mass of the women of this State do not make the demand; it\r\n     comes from a few sour, disappointed old maids and childless\r\n     women.\r\n\r\n     You are mistaken; the mass speak through us. A very large\r\n     majority of the women of this State support themselves and their\r\n     children, and many their husbands too. Go into any village you\r\n     please, of three or four thousand inhabitants, and you will find\r\n     as many as fifty men or more, whose only business is to discuss\r\n     religion and politics, as they watch the trains come and go at\r\n     the depot, or the passage of a canal boat through a lock; to\r\n     laugh at the vagaries of some drunken brother, or the capers of a\r\n     monkey dancing to the music of his master's organ. All these are\r\n     supported by their mothers, wives, or sisters.\r\n\r\n     Now, do you candidly think these wives do not wish to control the\r\n     wages they earn--to own the land they buy--the houses they build?\r\n     to have at their disposal their own children, without being\r\n     subject to the constant interference and tyranny of an idle,\r\n     worthless profligate? Do you suppose that any woman is such a\r\n     pattern of devotion and submission that she willingly stitches\r\n     all day for the small sum of fifty cents, that she may enjoy the\r\n     unspeakable privilege, in obedience to your laws, of paying for\r\n     her husband's tobacco and rum? Think you the wife of the\r\n     confirmed, beastly drunkard would consent to share with him her\r\n     home and bed, if law and public sentiment would release her from\r\n     such gross companionship? Verily, no! Think you the wife with\r\n     whom endurance has ceased to be a virtue, who, through much\r\n     suffering, has lost all faith in the justice of both heaven and\r\n     earth, takes the law in her own hand, severs the unholy bond, and\r\n     turns her back forever upon him whom she once called husband,\r\n     consents to the law that in such an hour tears her child from\r\n     her--all that she has left on earth to love and cherish? The\r\n     drunkards' wives speak through us, and they number 50,000. Think\r\n     you that the woman who has worked hard all her days in helping\r\n     her husband to accumulate a large property, consents to the law\r\n     that places this wholly at his disposal? Would not the mother\r\n     whose only child is bound out for a term of years against her\r\n     expressed wish, deprive the father of this absolute power if she\r\n     could?\r\n\r\n     For all these, then, we speak. If to this long list you add the\r\n     laboring women who are loudly demanding remuneration for their\r\n     unending toil; those women who teach in our seminaries,\r\n     academies, and public schools for a miserable pittance; the\r\n     widows who are taxed without mercy; the unfortunate ones in our\r\n     work-houses, poor-houses, and prisons; who are they that we do\r\n     not now represent? But a small class of the fashionable\r\n     butterflies, who, through the short summer days, seek the\r\n     sunshine and the flowers; but the cool breezes of autumn and the\r\n     hoary frosts of winter will soon chase all these away; then they,\r\n     too, will need and seek protection, and through other lips demand\r\n     in their turn justice and equity at your hands.\r\n\r\nThe friends of woman suffrage may be said to have fairly held a\r\nprotracted meeting during the two following weeks in Albany, with\r\nhearings before both branches of the Legislature, and lectures evening\r\nafter evening in Association Hall, by Mrs. Rose, Mr. Channing, Mr.\r\nPhillips, and Miss Brown, culminating in a discussion by the entire\r\npress of the city and State; for all the journals had something to say\r\non one side or the other, Mrs. Rose, Mr. Channing, Miss Brown, and\r\nseveral anonymous writers taking part in the newspaper debate. As this\r\nwas the first Convention held at the Capitol, it roused considerable\r\nagitation on every phase of the question, not only among the\r\nlegislators on the bills before them, but among the people throughout\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\n     _The Albany Transcript_ thus sums up the WOMAN'S RIGHTS\r\n     CONVENTION.--The meeting last evening was attended by the largest\r\n     and most brilliant audience of the series. A large number of\r\n     members of the Legislature were there, and a full representation\r\n     of our most influential citizens. Indeed they could not have\r\n     asked for a more numerous or talented body of hearers. Mrs. Rose\r\n     was the sole speaker, owing to the necessity which had called the\r\n     others away.... She was listened to with the most profound\r\n     attention, and encouraged by frequent and prolonged applause.\r\n\r\n     Thus has ended the first Convention of women designed to\r\n     influence political action. On Monday the 6,000 petitions will be\r\n     presented in the Legislature, and the address be placed on the\r\n     members' tables. Whatever may be the final disposition of the\r\n     matter, it is well to make a note of this _first effort_ to\r\n     influence the Legislature. It was originated by Miss Susan B.\r\n     Anthony, and has been managed financially by her. Though a\r\n     stranger amongst us, she has made the contracts for the room,\r\n     advertised in the papers, employed the speakers, published the\r\n     address, and performed much other arduous labor.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Nichols, one of the speakers, has long been connected with\r\n     the press, and is a woman of no mean ability. Her mild, beaming\r\n     countenance and the affectionate tones of her voice, disprove\r\n     that she is any less a woman than those who do not \"speak in\r\n     public on the stage.\" Mrs. Love is a new caterer to public favor,\r\n     and promises well. Some have remarked that she is well named,\r\n     being a \"Love of a woman.\" Mrs. Jenkins is a fluent and agreeable\r\n     speaker, and has a good degree of power in swaying an audience.\r\n     But Mrs. Rose is the queen of the company. On the educational\r\n     question in particular, she rises to a high standard of\r\n     oratorical power. When speaking of Hungary and her own crushed\r\n     Poland, she is full of eloquence and pathos, and she has as great\r\n     a power to chain an audience as any of our best male speakers.\r\n\r\n     _The Evening Journal_ (Thurlow Weed, editor): WOMAN'S\r\n     RIGHTS.--Mr. Channing and Mrs. Rose pleaded the cause of woman's\r\n     rights before the Senate Committee of bachelors yesterday. The\r\n     only effect produced was a determination more fixed than ever in\r\n     the minds of the committee, to _remain_ bachelors in the event of\r\n     the success of the movement. And who would blame them?\r\n\r\n     The same champions, with others probably, will speak to the House\r\n     Committee in the Assembly Chamber this afternoon; and Mr.\r\n     Channing and Mrs. Rose make addresses in Association Hall this\r\n     evening. Price twenty-five cents.\r\n\r\n     _The Albany Register_: WOMEN IN THE SENATE CHAMBER.--The Senate\r\n     was alarmed yesterday afternoon. It surrendered to progress. The\r\n     Select Committee to whom the women's rights petitions had been\r\n     referred, took their seats on the president's platform, looking\r\n     as grave as possible. Never had Senators Robertson, Yost, and\r\n     Field been in such responsible circumstances. They were calm, but\r\n     evidently felt themselves in great peril.\r\n\r\n     In the circle of the Senate, ranged in invincible row, sat seven\r\n     ladies, from quite pretty to quite plain.\r\n\r\nErnestine L. Rose and Rev. William Henry Channing presented the\r\narguments and appeals to the Committee, and Mrs. Rose invited them to\r\nask questions. _The Register_ concludes:\r\n\r\n     The Honorable Senators quailed beneath the trial. There was a\r\n     terrible silence, and the audience eager to hear what the other\r\n     ladies had to say, were wretched when they found that the\r\n     Committee had silently dissolved--surrendered. Oh, what a fall\r\n     was there, my countrymen!\r\n\r\n     _The Albany Argus_ of March 4th, says: THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN\r\n     DEFINED BY THEMSELVES.--Miss Anthony and Mrs. Rose before the\r\n     House Committee, March 3d. The Committee took their seats in the\r\n     clerk's desk, and the ladies took possession of the members'\r\n     seats, filling the chamber, many members of the Legislature being\r\n     present. Miss Anthony presented a paper prepared by Judge William\r\n     Hay, of Saratoga, asking that husband and wife should be tenants\r\n     in common of property without survivorship, but with a partition\r\n     on the death of one; that a wife shall be competent to discharge\r\n     trusts and powers the same as a single woman; that the statute in\r\n     respect to a married woman's property descend as though she had\r\n     been unmarried; that married women shall be entitled to execute\r\n     letters testamentary, and of administration; that married women\r\n     shall have power to make contracts and transact business as\r\n     though unmarried; that they shall be entitled to their own\r\n     earnings, subject to their proportionable liability for support\r\n     of children; that post-nuptial acquisitions shall belong equally\r\n     to husband and wife; that married women shall stand on the same\r\n     footing with single women, as parties or witnesses in legal\r\n     proceedings; that they shall be sole guardians of their minor\r\n     children; that the homestead shall be inviolable and inalienable\r\n     for widows and children; that the laws in relation to divorce\r\n     shall be revised, and drunkenness made cause for absolute\r\n     divorce; that better care shall be taken of single women's\r\n     property, that their rights may not be lost through ignorance,\r\n     that the preference of males in descent of real estate shall be\r\n     abolished; that women shall exercise \"the right of suffrage,\" and\r\n     be eligible to all offices, occupations, and professions;\r\n     entitled to act as jurors; eligible to all public offices; that\r\n     courts of conciliation shall be organized as peace-makers; that a\r\n     law shall be enacted extending the masculine designation in all\r\n     statutes of the State to females.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Rose then addressed the Committee, saying: The right of\r\n     petition is of no avail unless the reform demanded be candidly\r\n     considered by the legislators. We judge of the intellectual\r\n     inferiority of our fellow-men by the amount of resistance they\r\n     oppose to oppression, and to some extent we judge correctly by\r\n     this test. The same rule holds good for women; while they tamely\r\n     submit to the many inequalities under which they labor, they\r\n     scarcely deserve to be freed from them.... These are not the\r\n     demands of the moment or the few; they are the demands of the\r\n     age; of the second half of the nineteenth century. The world will\r\n     endure after us, and future generations may look back to this\r\n     meeting to acknowledge that a great onward step was here taken\r\n     in the cause of human progress.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Rose took her seat amidst great applause from the galleries\r\n     and lobbies. The Committee adjourned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _Albany Register_, March 7: WOMAN'S RIGHTS IN THE\r\n     LEGISLATURE.--While the feminine propagandists of women's rights\r\n     confined themselves to the exhibition of short petticoats and\r\n     long-legged boots, and to the holding of Conventions, and\r\n     speech-making in concert-rooms, the people were disposed to be\r\n     amused by them, as they are by the wit of the clown in the\r\n     circus, or the performances of Punch and Judy on fair days, or\r\n     the minstrelsy of gentlemen with blackened faces, on banjos, the\r\n     tambourine, and bones. But the joke is becoming stale. People are\r\n     getting cloyed with these performances, and are looking for some\r\n     healthier and more intellectual amusement. The ludicrous is\r\n     wearing away, and disgust is taking the place of pleasurable\r\n     sensations, arising from the novelty of this new phase of\r\n     hypocrisy and infidel fanaticism. People are beginning to inquire\r\n     how far public sentiment should sanction or tolerate these\r\n     unsexed women, who make a scoff of religion, who repudiate the\r\n     Bible and blaspheme God; who would step out from the true sphere\r\n     of the mother, the wife, and the daughter, and taking upon\r\n     themselves the duties and the business of men, stalk into the\r\n     public gaze, and by engaging in the politics, the rough\r\n     controversies, and trafficking of the world, upheave existing\r\n     institutions, and overturn all the social relations of life.\r\n\r\n     It is a melancholy reflection, that among our American women who\r\n     have been educated to better things, there should be found any\r\n     who are willing to follow the lead of such foreign propagandists\r\n     as the ringleted, glove-handed exotic, Ernestine L. Rose. We can\r\n     understand how such men as the Rev. Mr. May, or the sleek-headed\r\n     Dr. Channing may be deluded by her to becoming her disciples.\r\n     They are not the first instances of infatuation that may overtake\r\n     weak-minded men, if they are honest in their devotion to her and\r\n     her doctrines. Nor would they be the first examples of a low\r\n     ambition that seeks notoriety as a substitute for true fame, if\r\n     they are dishonest. Such men there are always, and honest or\r\n     dishonest, their true position is that of being tied to the\r\n     apron-strings of some \"strong-minded woman,\" and to be exhibited\r\n     as rare specimens of human wickedness, or human weakness and\r\n     folly. But, that one educated American woman should become her\r\n     disciple and follow her infidel and insane teachings, is a\r\n     marvel.\r\n\r\n     Ernestine L. Rose came to this country, as she says, from Poland,\r\n     whence she was compelled to fly in pursuit of freedom. Seeing her\r\n     course here, we can well imagine this to be true. In no other\r\n     country in the world, save possibly one, would her infidel\r\n     propagandism and preachings in regard to the social relations of\r\n     life be tolerated. She would be prohibited by the powers of\r\n     government from her efforts to obliterate from the world the\r\n     religion of the Cross--to banish the Bible as a text-book of\r\n     faith, and to overturn social institutions that have existed\r\n     through all political and governmental revolutions from the\r\n     remotest time. The strong hand of the law would be laid upon\r\n     her, and she would be compelled back to her woman's sphere. But\r\n     in this country, such is the freedom of our institutions, and we\r\n     rejoice that it should be so, that she, and such as she, can give\r\n     their genius for intrigue full sway. They can exhibit their\r\n     flowing ringlets and beautiful hands, their winning smiles and\r\n     charming stage attitudes to admiring audiences, who, while they\r\n     are willing to be amused, are in the main safe from their\r\n     corrupting theories and demoralizing propagandism.\r\n\r\n     The laws and the theory of our government suppose that the people\r\n     are capable of taking care of themselves, and hence need no\r\n     protection against the wiles of domestic or foreign mountebanks,\r\n     whether in petticoats or in breeches and boots. But it never was\r\n     contemplated that these exotic agitators would come up to our\r\n     legislators and ask for the passage of laws upholding and\r\n     sanctioning their wild and foolish doctrines. That was a stretch\r\n     of folly, a flight of impudence which was hardly regarded as\r\n     possible. It was to be imagined, of course, that they would\r\n     enlist as their followers, here and there one among the restless\r\n     old maids and visionary wives who chanced to be unevenly\r\n     tempered, as well as unevenly yoked. It was also to be assumed,\r\n     as within the range of possibility, that they might bring within\r\n     the sphere of their attractions, weak-minded, restless men, who\r\n     think in their vanity that they have been marked out for great\r\n     things, and failed to be appreciated by the world, men who comb\r\n     their hair smoothly back, and with fingers locked across their\r\n     stomachs, speak in a soft voice, and with upturned eyes. But no\r\n     man supposed they would abandon their \"private theatricals\" and\r\n     walk up to the Capitol, and insist that the performances shall be\r\n     held in legislative halls. And yet so it is.\r\n\r\n     This Mrs. Ernestine L. Rose, with a train of followers, like a\r\n     great kite with a very long tail, has, for a week, been amusing\r\n     Senatorial and Assembly Committees, with her woman's rights\r\n     performances, free of charge, unless the waste of time that might\r\n     be better employed in the necessary and legitimate business of\r\n     legislation, may be regarded as a charge. Those committees have\r\n     sat for hours, grave and solemn as owls, listening to the\r\n     outpourings of fanaticism and folly of this Polish propagandist,\r\n     Mrs. Ernestine L. Rose, and her followers in pantalets and short\r\n     gowns. The people outside, and especially those interested in the\r\n     progress of legislation, are beginning to ask one another how\r\n     long this farce is to continue. How long this most egregious and\r\n     ridiculous humbug is to be permitted to obstruct the progress of\r\n     business before the Committees and the Houses, and whether Mrs.\r\n     Ernestine L. Rose and her followers ought not to be satisfied\r\n     with the notoriety they have already attained. The great body of\r\n     the people regard Mrs. Rose and her followers as making\r\n     themselves simply ridiculous, and there is some danger that these\r\n     legislative committees will make themselves so too.\r\n\r\n     LECTURE OF THE REV. ANTOINETTE L. BROWN.--It will be seen the\r\n     Rev. Antoinette L. Brown delivers a lecture at Association Hall\r\n     to-morrow evening. It has been said that we have done the women's\r\n     rights people injustice in charging upon them the infidelity of\r\n     Mrs. Ernestine L. Rose. If we have done them injustice in this\r\n     matter it is but right that we should make amends by calling\r\n     attention to the lecture of Miss Brown, which, as we understand,\r\n     will embrace the Bible argument in favor of the measures which\r\n     they advocate. Miss Brown is a talented woman, and we have no\r\n     doubt an exemplary Christian.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _For the Albany Daily State Register._\r\n\r\n                             WOMAN'S RIGHTS.\r\n\r\n     Mr. EDITOR:--In your paper of Monday the 6th inst., I perceive\r\n     you pass judgment upon the woman's rights cause, upon those\r\n     engaged in it, and particularly upon myself--how justly, I leave\r\n     to your conscience to decide.\r\n\r\n     Every one who ever advanced a new idea, no matter how great and\r\n     noble, has been subjected to criticism, and therefore we too must\r\n     expect it. And, in accordance with the spirit of the critic, will\r\n     be the criticism. Whether dictated by the spirit of justice,\r\n     kindness, gentleness, and charity, or by injustice, malice,\r\n     rudeness, and intolerance, it is still an index of the man. But\r\n     it is quite certain that no true soul will ever be deterred from\r\n     the performance of a duty by any criticism.\r\n\r\n     But there is one thing which I think even editors have no right\r\n     to do, namely: to state a positive falsehood, or even to imply\r\n     one, for the purpose of injuring another. And, as the spirit of\r\n     charity induces me to believe that in your case it was done more\r\n     from a misunderstanding than positive malice, therefore I claim\r\n     at your hands the justice to give this letter a place in your\r\n     paper.\r\n\r\n     In the article alluded to, you say: \"Ernestine L. Rose came to\r\n     this country, as she says, from Poland, whence she was compelled\r\n     to fly in pursuit of freedom.\" It is true that I came from\r\n     Poland; but it is false that I was compelled to fly from my\r\n     country, except by the compulsion, or dictates of the same spirit\r\n     of \"propagandism,\" that induced so many of my noble countrymen to\r\n     shed their blood in the defence of the rights of this country,\r\n     and the rights of man, wherever he struggles for freedom. But I\r\n     have no desire to claim martyrdom which does not belong to me. I\r\n     left my country, not flying, but deliberately. I chose to make\r\n     this country my home, in preference to any other, because if you\r\n     carried out the theories you profess, it would indeed be the\r\n     noblest country on earth. And as my countrymen so nobly aided in\r\n     the physical struggle for Freedom and Independence, I felt, and\r\n     still feel it equally my duty to use my humble abilities to the\r\n     uttermost in my power, to aid in the great moral struggle for\r\n     human rights and human freedom.\r\n\r\n     Hoping that you will acede to my (I think) just claim to give\r\n     this a place in your paper,\r\n\r\n                                 I am, very respectfully,\r\n                                                      ERNESTINE L. ROSE.\r\n     NEW YORK, _Mar. 7, 1854_.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HENRY CHANNING asks the following questions in the _Albany\r\nEvening Journal_:\r\n\r\n                              WOMAN'S RIGHTS.\r\n\r\n     A lady actively and prominently connected with, the movement\r\n     which is expected to secure \"justice to woman,\" personally\r\n     requested us to publish the following communication. It is\r\n     proper to state that it is written in reply to an article of one\r\n     of our morning contemporaries, published a day or two ago:\r\n\r\n     \"Let us take it for granted that your pop-gun of pleasantry has\r\n     killed off the six thousand 'strong-minded' women and\r\n     'weak-minded' men who signed the petitions to the Legislature for\r\n     Justice to Woman. And thus having disposed of personalities, will\r\n     you be pleased to pass on to a discussion of the following\r\n     questions:\r\n\r\n     \"1. Are women, in New York, persons, people, citizens, members of\r\n     the State? If they are not, then why are they numbered in the\r\n     census, taxed by assessors, and subjected to legal penalties? If\r\n     they are, then why is authority exercised over them without their\r\n     consent asked or granted?\r\n\r\n     \"2. If among the male half of the people, only criminals, aliens,\r\n     and minors are excluded from the right of suffrage are all women\r\n     excluded from exercising this right, on the ground of\r\n     criminality, idiocy, foreign associations, or infantile\r\n     imbecility?\r\n\r\n     \"3. If the mothers, sisters, wives, and daughters of New York are\r\n     the peers and equals of their fathers, brothers, husbands, and\r\n     sons, why should they not enjoy all civil and political rights\r\n     equally with them? If they are, on the contrary, an inferior\r\n     caste, how can a jury of men thus avowedly superior, be regarded\r\n     as peers and equals of any woman whom they are summoned to try?\r\n\r\n     \"4. Would the editor of _The Register_ consider himself justly\r\n     treated if he would some day find himself governed by women,\r\n     without his consent, taxed by women without power of voting for\r\n     his representative, tried by a jury of women under laws made and\r\n     administered by women?\r\n\r\n     \"5. If prosecuted under the law of libel before a court of women\r\n     for his late remarks, does he think he would get his deserts?\r\n\r\n                                                  \"FAIR PLAY.\"\r\n\r\n     _Knickerbocker_, Albany, March 8, 1854: GOING IT BLIND.--The\r\n     editor of _The State Register_ is going it blind on woman's\r\n     rights matters. He was out on Monday with a half column leader\r\n     that touched everything except the matter in dispute. We quote a\r\n     paragraph:\r\n\r\n     \"People are beginning to inquire how far public sentiment should\r\n     sanction or tolerate these unsexed women, who make a scoff at\r\n     religion, who repudiate the Bible, and blaspheme God; who would\r\n     step out from the true sphere of the mother, the wife, and the\r\n     daughter, and take upon themselves the duties and the business of\r\n     men; stalk into the public gaze, and by engaging in the politics,\r\n     the rough controversies, and trafficking of the world, upheave\r\n     existing institutions, and overturn all the social relations of\r\n     life.\"\r\n\r\n     _The Register_ either misunderstands matters, or else willfully\r\n     misrepresents them. The leading women connected with this new\r\n     movement do not scoff at religion, repudiate the Bible, nor\r\n     blaspheme God. Mrs. Stanton and Miss Brown are no more opposed to\r\n     God and religion than the editor of _The Register_ is. They are\r\n     educated, Christian women, and would no sooner \"overturn society\"\r\n     than they would bear false witness against their neighbors.\r\n     Before _The Register_ again attacks the reforms proposed by the\r\n     Woman's Rights Conventions, it should become acquainted with\r\n     them. \"Going it blind,\" not only exposes one's prejudices, but\r\n     ignorance. Many of the innovations proposed by Mrs. Stanton are\r\n     such as every common-sense man would or should vote for. We mean\r\n     those improvements which she would have made in the rights of\r\n     property and the care of children. There are other propositions\r\n     in her platform which we should dissent from. _The State\r\n     Register_ may do the same. All the \"Woman's Rights\" women claim\r\n     is fair play and truthful criticism. They object, however, to any\r\n     misstatements. They are willing to fall before truth, but not\r\n     before detraction. _The State Register_ will please notice and\r\n     act accordingly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton's address to the Legislature was laid upon the members'\r\ndesks Monday morning, Feb. 20, 1854. When the order of petitions was\r\nreached, Mr. D. P. Wood, of Onondaga, presented in the Assembly a\r\npetition signed by 5,931 men and women, praying for the just and equal\r\nrights of women, which, after a spicy debate, was referred to the\r\nfollowing Select Committee: James L. Angle, of Monroe Co.; George W.\r\nThorn, of Washington Co.; Derrick L. Boardman, of Oneida Co.; George\r\nH. Richards, of New York; James M. Munro, of Onondaga; Wesley Gleason,\r\nof Fulton; Alexander P. Sharpe, of New York.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate, on the same day, Mr. Richards, or Warren County,\r\npresented a petition signed by 4,164 men and women, praying for the\r\nextension of the right of suffrage to women, and on his motion it was\r\nreferred to the following Select Committee: George Yost, of Montgomery\r\nCo.; Ben. Field, of Orleans Co.; W. H. Robertson, of Westchester Co.\r\n\r\nWe give the report of the presentation and discussion of the petitions\r\nfrom _The Albany Evening Journal_ of Feb. 20, 1854:\r\n\r\n                              WOMAN'S RIGHTS.\r\n\r\n                              ASSEMBLY, Monday, _February 20, 1854_.\r\n\r\n     Mr. D. P. WOOD: I am requested by a Committee of the Woman's\r\n     Rights Convention recently assembled in this city, to present to\r\n     this body their address, together with a petition signed by 5,931\r\n     men and women, asking that certain withheld rights shall be\r\n     granted to the women of the State. I ask the reference of these\r\n     two documents to a Select Committee of seven; and in making this\r\n     motion, I wish the Speaker to waive the courtesy which would\r\n     require him, under ordinary circumstances, to place me at the\r\n     head of this Committee. I am already on several Committees which\r\n     are pressed with business, and I would not, in my present state\r\n     of health, be able to give the subject that careful consideration\r\n     which the importance requires. I am satisfied, sir, that these\r\n     ladies are entitled to some relief. They think so, and they say\r\n     so, in language equally eloquent and impressive.\r\n\r\n     Mr. BURNETT: I hope the House will not act at all on this subject\r\n     without due consideration. I hope before even this motion is put,\r\n     gentlemen will be allowed to reflect upon the important question\r\n     whether these individuals deserve any consideration at the hands\r\n     of the Legislature. Whatever may be their pretensions or their\r\n     sincerity, they do not appear to be satisfied with having unsexed\r\n     themselves, but they desire to unsex every female in the land,\r\n     and to set the whole community ablaze with unhallowed fire. I\r\n     trust, sir, the House may deliberate before we suffer them to\r\n     cast this firebrand into our midst. (Here was heard a \"hiss\" from\r\n     some part of the chamber). True, as yet, there is nothing\r\n     officially before us, but it is well known that the object of\r\n     these unsexed women is to overthrow the most sacred of our\r\n     institutions, to set at defiance the Divine law which declares\r\n     man and wife to be one, and establish on its ruins what will be\r\n     in fact and in principle but a species of legalized adultery.\r\n     That this is their real object, however they may attempt to\r\n     disguise it, is well known to every one who has looked, not\r\n     perhaps at the intentions of all who take part in it, but at the\r\n     practical and inevitable result of the movement.\r\n\r\n     It is, therefore, a matter of duty, a duty to ourselves, to our\r\n     consciences, to our constituents, and to God, who is the source\r\n     of all law and of all obligations, to reflect long and\r\n     deliberatively before we shall even seem to countenance a\r\n     movement so unholy as this. The Spartan mothers asked no such\r\n     immunities as are asked for by these women. The Roman mothers\r\n     were content to occupy their legitimate spheres; and our own\r\n     mothers, who possessed more than Spartan or Roman virtue, asked\r\n     for no repudiation of the duties, obligations, or sacred\r\n     relations of the marital rite.\r\n\r\n     Are we, sir, to give the least countenance to claims so\r\n     preposterous, disgraceful, and criminal as are embodied in this\r\n     address? Are we to put the stamp of truth upon the libel here set\r\n     forth, that men and women, in the matrimonial relation, are to be\r\n     equal? We know that God created man as the representative of the\r\n     race; that after his creation, his Creator took from his side the\r\n     material for woman's creation; and that, by the institution of\r\n     matrimony, woman was restored to the side of man, and became one\r\n     flesh and one being, he being the head. But this law of God and\r\n     creation is spurned by these women who present themselves here as\r\n     the exponents of the wishes of our mothers, wives, and daughters.\r\n     They ask no such exponents, and they repel their sacrilegious\r\n     doctrines.\r\n\r\n     But again, sir, our old views of matrimony were, that it was a\r\n     holy rite, having holy relations based on mutual love and\r\n     confidence; and that while woman gave herself up to man, to his\r\n     care, protection, and love, man also surrendered something in\r\n     exchange for this confidence and love. He placed his happiness\r\n     and his honor, all that belongs to him of human hopes and of\r\n     human happiness, in the keeping of the being he received in the\r\n     sacred relationship of wife. I say, sir, that this ordinance,\r\n     sought to be practically overthrown by these persons, was\r\n     established by God Himself; and was based on the mutual love and\r\n     confidence of husband and wife. But we are now asked to have this\r\n     ordinance based on jealousy and distrust; and, as in Italy, so in\r\n     this country, should this mischievous scheme be carried out to\r\n     its legitimate results, we, instead of reposing safe confidence\r\n     against assaults upon our honor in the love and affection of our\r\n     wives, shall find ourselves obliged to close the approaches to\r\n     those assaults by the padlock. (The \"hiss\" was here repeated).\r\n\r\n     Mr. LOZIER: Mr. Speaker, twice I have heard a hiss from the\r\n     lobby. I protest against the toleration of such an insult to any\r\n     member of this House, and call for proper action in view of it.\r\n\r\n     The SPEAKER: The chair observed the interruption, and was\r\n     endeavoring to discover its source, but has been unable to do so.\r\n     If, however, its author can be recognized, the chair will\r\n     immediately order the person to the bar of the House.\r\n\r\n     Mr. BURNETT: I have nothing further. The leading features of this\r\n     address are well known; and I do not wish at present to further\r\n     enter upon the argument of its character. I merely wish that\r\n     members be afforded time for consideration. I therefore move to\r\n     lay the pending motion on the table.\r\n\r\n     D. P. WOOD: I am surprised that the gentleman from Essex, who\r\n     professes to desire light, and to afford members time for\r\n     examination, should make a motion which, if carried, will\r\n     preclude light and prevent examination. The gentleman sees fit to\r\n     regard the memorial of these 6,000 men and women as a firebrand.\r\n     I do not believe the ladies who presented it intended it as such;\r\n     and they will be surprised to learn that a gentleman of his age\r\n     and experience should have taken fire from it. Their requests are\r\n     simple. They ask for \"justice and equal rights,\" and this simple\r\n     request is made the excuse for an attack upon them as unheard of\r\n     as it is unjust. They ask only for \"justice and equal rights.\" If\r\n     the House does not see fit to grant them what they ask, let my\r\n     motion be voted down, and send the memorial to the Judiciary\r\n     Committee, of which the gentleman from Essex is chairman. Let\r\n     such a disposition be made of it, and there will then be no\r\n     danger that any one will be fired up by it, for it will then be\r\n     sure to sleep the sleep of death.\r\n\r\n     Sir, when a petition like this comes before the Legislature, it\r\n     should not only be respectfully received, but courteously\r\n     considered; particularly when it asks, as this petition does, a\r\n     review of the entire code of our statute laws. It should not be\r\n     sent to a Committee adverse to its request. That would be\r\n     unparliamentary and the end of it. If sent to such a Committee it\r\n     would be smothered. The House, I am sure, is not prepared for any\r\n     such disposition of the matter, but is willing to look candidly\r\n     at the alleged grievances, and, if consistent with public policy,\r\n     redress them, although in doing so we may infringe upon\r\n     time-honored notions and usages.\r\n\r\n     Mr. PETERS: I am not surprised at the direction which the\r\n     gentleman from Essex seeks to give this memorial. Any gentleman\r\n     who would assail these ladies as he has done, would be prepared\r\n     to make any disrespectful disposition of their rights. I may\r\n     regret that he has sought to deny a hearing to these petitioners,\r\n     but I am not surprised that he has done so. I trust that no other\r\n     member on this floor will refuse, practically, to receive this\r\n     petition--refuse to our mothers, wives, and sisters, what we\r\n     every day grant to our fathers, brothers, and sons. These women\r\n     come here with a respectful petition, and we should give them a\r\n     candid and respectful hearing. If it be true, and true it is,\r\n     that there are real grievances complained of, I hope they may be\r\n     redressed after careful and candid consideration.\r\n\r\n     The time has gone by, sir, when we may say progress must stop. It\r\n     is well known that in many particulars the laws are glaringly\r\n     unjust in regard to the female sex. The education of the sex is\r\n     defective; and this fact unfolds the secret germ of this\r\n     movement. We should review the structure of our institutions of\r\n     learning, and see whether there be not there room for reform. I\r\n     do not believe it to be a part of the duty of women to sit in the\r\n     jury-box, to vote, or to participate in all the tumultuous\r\n     strifes of life; but I do believe that those who differ from me\r\n     in opinion should have respectful hearing. Nor, because women are\r\n     not allowed to vote, do I admit that they are precluded from all\r\n     agency in the direction of national affairs. They, more than\r\n     their husbands, have power over the future history of the\r\n     country, by imparting a correct fireside education to their sons.\r\n     But there are legal disabilities imposed upon women which I would\r\n     be willing to see removed, in regard to property, etc. Whether\r\n     those disabilities are of a character to justify affirmative\r\n     action on the part of this House or not, is not now the question.\r\n     The question simply is, shall this petition be received? I trust\r\n     that it may be, and that it may afterward be sent to a select\r\n     committee.\r\n\r\n     Mr. BENEDICT: The gentleman from Onondaga asks that this petition\r\n     shall be sent to a select committee of seven, although he admits\r\n     that the Judiciary Committee would be more appropriate, if it\r\n     would not be sure, if sent to that Committee, to sleep the sleep\r\n     of death. Sir, I am one of that Committee, and protest against\r\n     any such imputation upon it. I will not only not vote to reject\r\n     any petition offered the House, but I will give every petition\r\n     sent to any committee of which I am a member a respectful\r\n     hearing. This is a petition signed by some 6,000 men and women.\r\n     They ask \"justice\" and relief. What kind of relief they may\r\n     desire is no matter. It is enough for me to know that they ask to\r\n     be heard. I shall vote to give them a hearing; and I can assure\r\n     the gentleman from Onondaga that if sent to the Judiciary\r\n     Committee it will sleep no sleep of death, but will be\r\n     respectfully considered. A contrary intimation is an unjust\r\n     reflection on that Committee.\r\n\r\n     Mr. WOOD: My remark was not intended to reflect upon that\r\n     Committee. I referred merely to the great amount of business\r\n     before it.\r\n\r\n     Mr. BENEDICT: There the gentleman is equally at fault. That\r\n     Committee is a working Committee, and disposed of all the\r\n     business before it on Friday last. I am, however, in favor of the\r\n     motion for a select committee, and desire that the petition\r\n     should receive legitimate and careful consideration, not only\r\n     because the petition is largely signed, but because every\r\n     petition from any portion of the people on any subject, should\r\n     receive a respectful hearing from the people's representatives. I\r\n     I hope, therefore, that not a single member may vote against the\r\n     reception of this petition, whatever his views may be in regard\r\n     to granting its prayer. I am in favor of the right of petition.\r\n\r\n     Mr. BURNETT: It was not my wish in the motion I made to have this\r\n     petition rejected. Had I intended any such thing I should have\r\n     said so; for I always go directly at what I want to accomplish,\r\n     and never fail to call things by their right names. I merely\r\n     wished, before any disposition was made of the petition, that the\r\n     members should have time to examine the address, which is the key\r\n     of the whole subject. This is all I desire; and it was simply an\r\n     expression of this desire that has awakened all this windy gust\r\n     of passion. After members shall examine the address which\r\n     accompanies this petition, they can make such disposition of the\r\n     petition itself as they shall deem wise and proper. This is the\r\n     length and breadth of my object and desire.\r\n\r\n     Mr. WOOD: I think the House understands the subject sufficiently\r\n     to justify action upon my motion of reference.\r\n\r\nThe motion for the Select Committee prevailed, ayes, 84; the Committee\r\nappointed, and Mr. Wood excused from serving.\r\n\r\n                     REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\n                              IN ASSEMBLY, MONDAY, _March 27, 1854_.\r\n\r\n     The Select Committee, to whom was referred the various petitions\r\n     requesting \"the Senate and Assembly of the State of New York to\r\n     appoint a joint committee to revise the Statutes of New York, and\r\n     to propose such amendments as will fully establish the legal\r\n     equality of women with men,\" report: That they have examined the\r\n     said petition, and have heard and considered the suggestions of\r\n     persons who have appeared before them on behalf of the\r\n     petitioners.\r\n\r\n     Your Committee are well aware that the matters submitted to them\r\n     have been, and still are, the subject of ridicule and jest; but\r\n     they are also aware that ridicule and jest never yet effectually\r\n     put down either truth or error; and that the development of our\r\n     times and the progression of our age is such, that many thoughts\r\n     laughed at to-day as wild vagaries, are to-morrow recorded as\r\n     developed principles or embodied as experimental facts.\r\n\r\n     A higher power than that from which emanates legislative\r\n     enactments has given forth the mandate that man and woman shall\r\n     not be equal; that there shall be inequalities by which each in\r\n     their own appropriate sphere shall have precedence to the other;\r\n     and each alike shall be superior or inferior as they well or ill\r\n     act the part assigned them. Both alike are the subjects of\r\n     Government, equally entitled to its protection; and civil power\r\n     must, in its enactments, recognize this inequality. We can not\r\n     obliterate it if we would, and legal inequalities must follow.\r\n\r\n     The education of woman has not been the result of statutes, but\r\n     of civilization and Christianity; and her elevation, great as it\r\n     has been, has only corresponded with that of man under the same\r\n     influences. She owes no more to these causes than he does. The\r\n     true elevation of the sexes will always correspond. But\r\n     elevation, instead of destroying, show? more palpably those\r\n     inherent inequalities, and makes more apparent the harmony and\r\n     happiness which the Creator designed to accomplish by them.\r\n\r\n     Your Committee will not attempt to prescribe, or, rather, they\r\n     will not attempt to define the province and peculiar sphere which\r\n     a power that we can not overrule has prescribed for the different\r\n     sexes. Every well-regulated home and household in the land\r\n     affords an example illustrative of what is woman's proper sphere,\r\n     as also that of man. Government has its miniature as well as its\r\n     foundation in the homes of our country; and as in governments\r\n     there must be some recognized head to control and direct, so must\r\n     there also be a controlling and directing power in every smaller\r\n     association; there must be some one to act and to be acted with\r\n     as the embodiment of the persons associated. In the formation of\r\n     governments, the manner in which the common interest shall be\r\n     embodied and represented is a matter of conventional arrangement;\r\n     but in the family an influence more potent than that of contracts\r\n     and conventionalities, and which everywhere underlies humanity,\r\n     has indicated that the husband shall fill the necessity which\r\n     exists for a head. Dissension and distraction quickly arise when\r\n     this necessity is not answered. The harmony of life, the real\r\n     interest of both husband and wife, and of all dependent upon\r\n     them, require it. In obedience to that requirement and necessity,\r\n     the husband is the head--the representative of the family.\r\n\r\n     It was strongly urged upon your Committee that women, inasmuch as\r\n     their property was liable to taxation, should be entitled to\r\n     representation. The member of this House who considers himself\r\n     the representative only of those whose ballots were cast for him,\r\n     or even of all the voters in his district, has, in the opinion of\r\n     your Committee, quite too limited an idea of his position on this\r\n     floor. In their opinion he is the representative of the\r\n     inhabitants of his district, whether they be voters or not,\r\n     whether they be men or women, old or young; and he who does not\r\n     alike watch over the interests of all, fails in his duty and is\r\n     false to his trust.\r\n\r\n     Your Committee can not regard marriage as a _mere contract_, but\r\n     as something above and beyond; something more binding than\r\n     records, more solemn than specialties; and the person who reasons\r\n     as to the relations of husband and wife as upon an ordinary\r\n     contract, in their opinion commits a fatal error at the outset;\r\n     and your Committee can not recommend any action based on such a\r\n     theory.\r\n\r\n     As society progresses new wants are felt, new facts and\r\n     combinations are presented which constantly call for more or less\r\n     of addition to the body of our laws, and often for innovations\r\n     upon customs so old that \"the memory of man runneth not to the\r\n     contrary thereof.\" The marriage relation, in common with\r\n     everything else, has felt the effects of this progress, and from\r\n     time to time been the subject of legislative action. And while\r\n     your Committee report adversely to the prayer of the petitions\r\n     referred to them, they believe that the time has come when\r\n     certain alterations and amendments are, by common consent,\r\n     admitted as proper and necessary.\r\n\r\n     Your Committee recommend that the assent of the mother, if she be\r\n     living, be made necessary to the validity of any disposition\r\n     which the father may make of her child by the way of the\r\n     appointment of guardian or of apprenticeship. The consent of the\r\n     wife is now necessary to a deed of real estate in order to bar\r\n     her contingent interest therein; and there are certainly far more\r\n     powerful reasons why her consent should be necessary to the\r\n     conveyance or transfer of her own offspring to the care,\r\n     teaching, and control of another.\r\n\r\n     When the husband from any cause neglects to provide for the\r\n     support and education of his family, the wife should have the\r\n     right to collect and receive her own earnings and the earnings of\r\n     her minor children, and apply them to the support and education\r\n     of the family free from the control of the husband, or any person\r\n     claiming the same through him.\r\n\r\n     There are many other rules of law applicable to the relation of\r\n     husband and wife which, in occasional cases, bear hard upon the\r\n     one or the other, but your Committee do not deem it wise that a\r\n     new arrangement of our laws of domestic relations should be\r\n     attempted to obviate such cases; they always have and always will\r\n     arise out of every subject of legal regulation.\r\n\r\n     There is much of wisdom (which may well be applied to this and\r\n     many other subjects) in the quaint remark of an English lawyer,\r\n     philosopher, and statesman, that \"it were well that men in their\r\n     innovations would follow the example of time, which innovateth\r\n     greatly but quietly, and by degrees scarcely to be perceived. It\r\n     is good also in states not to try experiments, except the\r\n     necessity be urgent and the utility evident; and well to beware\r\n     that it be the reformation that draweth on the change, and not\r\n     the desire of change that pretendeth the reformation.\"\r\n\r\n     In conclusion, your Committee recommend that the prayer of the\r\n     petitioners be denied; and they ask leave to introduce a\r\n     bill[127] corresponding with the suggestions hereinbefore\r\n     contained.\r\n\r\nThe report was signed by James L. Angle and all the members of the\r\nCommittee except Mr. Richards.\r\n\r\nOf the report on the petitions, Mr. Weed says:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Angle, from the Select Committee of the Assembly, to which\r\n     the woman's rights petitions were referred, made a report last\r\n     evening, which we publish elsewhere to-day. It is a compact,\r\n     lucid, and ably drawn document, highly creditable to its author,\r\n     and becomingly respectful to the petitioners. The Committee\r\n     report adversely to the petitions, but recommend one or two\r\n     changes in our existing law, which will, we think, commend\r\n     themselves as well to the opponents, as to the advocates of\r\n     woman's rights.\r\n\r\nThe work in the State of New York was now thoroughly systematized.\r\nSusan B. Anthony was appointed General Agent, and it was decided to\r\nhold a series of Conventions in all the counties and chief cities of\r\nthe State, in order to roll up mammoth petitions with which to bombard\r\nthe Legislature at every annual session. Two appeals[128] were issued\r\nto the women of the State, one in June, prepared by Mr. Channing, and\r\none in December, by Mrs. Stanton. A number of able speakers[129]\r\njoined in the work, and the State was thoroughly canvassed every year\r\nuntil the war, and petitions presented by the thousands until the bill\r\nsecuring the civil rights of married women was passed in March, 1860.\r\n\r\nLest our readers should think that there was no variety to our lives\r\nin these early days, that we did nothing but resolve, complain,\r\npetition, protest, hold conventions, and besiege Legislatures, we\r\nrecord now and then some cheerful item from the Metropolitan papers\r\nconcerning some of our leading women.\r\n\r\n                                   NEW YORK, _March 14, 1854_.\r\n\r\n     ANNIVERSARY OF THE 83D BIRTHDAY OF ROBERT OWEN AT 600 BROADWAY.\r\n\r\n     When the reporter entered the room he found the ladies and\r\n     gentlemen assembled there tripping the light fantastic toe to the\r\n     music of a harp, piano, and violin. Ernestine L. Rose was\r\n     president of the occasion, and gave a very interesting sketch of\r\n     the life and labors of this noble man. After which they had a\r\n     grand supper, and Lucy Stone replied to the toast, \"Woman,\r\n     coequal with man.\" The ladies not only danced and made speeches,\r\n     but they partook of the supper. They did not sit in the\r\n     galleries, as the custom then was, to look at the gentlemen eat,\r\n     and listen to their after-dinner speeches, but enjoyed an equal\r\n     share in the whole entertainment. Mrs. Rose and Miss Stone seemed\r\n     to feel as much at home on this festive occasion, as amid the\r\n     more important proceedings of a convention.\r\n\r\nAs the agitation was kept up from year to year with frequent\r\nconventions, ever and anon some prominent person who had hitherto\r\nbeen silent, would concede a modicum of what we claimed, so timidly,\r\nhowever, and with so many popular provisos, that the concessions were\r\nalmost buried in the objections. It was after this manner that Henry\r\nWard Beecher, then in the zenith of his popularity, vouchsafed an\r\nopinion. He believed in woman's right to vote and speak in public.\r\nThere was no logical argument against either, but he would not like to\r\nsee his wife or mother go to the polls or mount the platform. This\r\nutterance called out the following letter from Gerrit Smith in _The\r\nBoston Liberator_:\r\n\r\n                                   PETERBORO, N. Y., _Nov. 19, 1854_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR GARRISON:--I am very glad to see in your paper that Henry\r\n     Ward Beecher avows himself a convert to the doctrine of woman's\r\n     voting. But I regret that this strong man is nevertheless not\r\n     strong enough to emancipate himself entirely from the dominion of\r\n     superstition. Mr. Beecher would not have his wife and sister\r\n     speak in public. Of course he means that he would not, however\r\n     competent they might be for such an exercise. I will suppose that\r\n     they all remove to Peterboro, and that a very important, nay, an\r\n     entirely vital question springs up in our community, and\r\n     profoundly agitates it; and I will further suppose that the wife\r\n     and sister of Mr. Beecher are more capable than any other persons\r\n     of taking the platform and shedding light upon the subject. Are\r\n     we not entitled to their superior light? Certainly. And certainly\r\n     therefore are they bound to afford it to us. Nevertheless Mr.\r\n     Beecher would have them withhold it from us. Pray what is it but\r\n     superstition that could prompt him to such violation of\r\n     benevolence and common-sense? Will Mr. Beecher go to the Bible\r\n     for his justification? That blessed book is to be read in the\r\n     life of Jesus Christ; and in that life is the fullness of\r\n     benevolence and common-sense, and no superstition at all. Will\r\n     Mr. Beecher limit his wife and sisters in the given case to their\r\n     pens?[130] Such limitation would he then be bound in consistency\r\n     to impose upon himself. Would he impose it? Again, it takes lips\r\n     as well as pens to carry instruction to the utmost.\r\n\r\n                                             Your friend,\r\n                                                    GERRIT SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nSARATOGA CONVENTIONS,\r\n\r\nAugust, 1854-'55.\r\n\r\nSeeing calls for two national conventions, by the friends of\r\nTemperance, and the Anti-Nebraska movement, to be held in Saratoga the\r\nthird week of August, the State Woman Suffrage Committee decided to\r\nembrace that opportunity to hold a convention there at the same\r\ntime.[131] As it was at the height of the fashionable season it was\r\nthought much good might be accomplished by getting the ear of a new\r\nclass of hearers.\r\n\r\nBut after the arrangements were all made, and Miss Anthony on the\r\nground, she received messages from one after another of the speakers\r\non whom she depended, that none of them could be present. Accordingly,\r\nencouraged by the Hon. William Hay, she decided to go through alone.\r\nHappily, Matilda Joslyn Gage and Sarah Pellet being in Saratoga, came\r\nforward and volunteered their services, and thus was the Convention\r\ncarried successfully through.[132] The meeting was held in St.\r\nNicholas Hall, which was well filled throughout, three-hundred dollars\r\nbeing taken at the door. The following _resumé_ of this occasion is\r\nfrom the pen of Judge William Hay, in a letter to _The North Star_ of\r\nRochester (Frederick Douglass, editor):\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE SARATOGA CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n     Miss Sarah Pellet addressed an audience of six hundred persons in\r\n     the afternoon, most of whom returned with others to St. Nicholas\r\n     Hall in the evening, thus manifesting their satisfaction with\r\n     what they had heard and their interest in the cause, which was\r\n     farther discussed by Mrs. Gage, whose address was an elaborate\r\n     argument for the removal of woman's legal and social\r\n     disabilities. Among other authorities she quoted with judgment,\r\n     was the following from Wm. W. Story: \"In respect to the powers\r\n     and rights of married women, the law is by no means abreast the\r\n     spirit of the age. Here are seen the old fossil prints of\r\n     _feudalism_. The law relating to woman tends to make every family\r\n     a barony, a monarchy, or a despotism, of which the husband is\r\n     the baron, king, or despot, and the wife the dependent, the serf,\r\n     or slave. That this is not always the fact, is not due to the\r\n     law, but to the enlarged humanity which spurns the narrow limits\r\n     of its rules; for if the husband choose, he has his wife as\r\n     firmly in his grasp and dominion, as the _hawk_ has the _dove_\r\n     upon whom he has pounced. This age is ahead of the law. Public\r\n     opinion is a check to legal rules on this subject, but the rules\r\n     are feudal and stern. It can not, however, be concealed that the\r\n     position of woman is always the criterion of the freedom of a\r\n     people or an age, and when man shall despise that right which is\r\n     founded only on might, woman will be free to stand on an equal\r\n     level with him--a friend and not a dependent.\"\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Gage also, and with like effect, cited from the same learned\r\n     jurist, laws, which, had her lecture been a sermon, might have\r\n     been prefixed as a text. Such opinions, although but seldom known\r\n     to any but lawyers, and not appreciated by many of them, have\r\n     frequently been printed in books, which, however, being\r\n     professional, are perused by few persons only. Mrs. Gage[133]\r\n     concluded her excellent discourse with Bryant's celebrated\r\n     stanza, relative to truth and error.\r\n\r\n     Miss Anthony's situation had become embarrassing, if not\r\n     critical. At a late hour of a summer night, she was to follow\r\n     Mrs. Gage on the same subject, and before a fastidious audience,\r\n     almost surfeited during three days with public addresses in\r\n     several different conventions, and many of whom desired to\r\n     contrast her expected effort with the splendid platform eloquence\r\n     of Henry J. Raymond, Wm. H. Burleigh, and \"their like,\"\r\n     fearlessly advocating the redress of wrongs and the promotion of\r\n     human rights. Miss Anthony, who had conciliated her audience by\r\n     lady-like conduct and courtesy, in providing seats for the\r\n     accommodation of those standing, commenced with an appropriate\r\n     apology for unavoidable repetition, when it was her lot to follow\r\n     Mrs. Gage. Sufficient here to say that she acquitted herself\r\n     admirably. The simplicity and repose of her manner, the dignity\r\n     of her deportment, the distinctiveness of her enunciation, her\r\n     emphatic earnestness, the pathos of her appeals, and completeness\r\n     of her arguments, convinced the understanding and persuaded all\r\n     hearts.\r\n\r\n     The gossip of mustached dandies, and the half-suppressed giggle\r\n     of bedizened beauty, soon settled down into respectful attention,\r\n     if not appreciation. Indeed many of the most intelligent hearers\r\n     before retiring, audibly confessed that they came to find fault,\r\n     but had seen nothing to censure. So some who came to scoff\r\n     remained to applaud. With such advocates there can be no\r\n     retrogression of Woman's Rights. Equality is their motto, and\r\n     onward their destiny.\r\n                                                       WM. HAY.\r\n\r\nThis Convention was so successful in point of numbers and receipts,\r\nand the sale of woman suffrage literature, that it was decided to\r\nrepeat the experiment the next year; accordingly the following call\r\nwas issued early in the season:\r\n\r\n                       SARATOGA CONVENTION, 1855.\r\n\r\n     A Convention will be held at Saratoga Springs on the 15th and\r\n     16th of August next, to discuss woman's right to suffrage.\r\n\r\n     In the progress of human events, woman now demands the\r\n     recognition of her civil existence, her legal rights, her social\r\n     equality with man.\r\n\r\n     How her claims can be the most easily and speedily established on\r\n     a firm, enduring basis, will be the subject of deliberation at\r\n     the coming Convention.\r\n\r\n     The friends of the movement, and the public generally, are most\r\n     respectfully invited to attend.\r\n\r\n     Many of the advocates of the cause are expected to be in\r\n     attendance.\r\n\r\n          ELIZABETH CADY STANTON,          LYDIA MOTT,\r\n          ERNESTINE L. ROSE,               ANTOINETTE L. BROWN,\r\n          SAMUEL J. MAY,                   SUSAN B. ANTHONY.\r\n\r\nThis Convention also was held in St. Nicholas Hall, and a large\r\naudience greeted the speakers of the occasion as they appeared upon\r\nthe platform.\r\n\r\nA brief report of the secretaries in _The Una_ of September, 1855,\r\nsays: A large audience assembled on the morning of August 15th at St.\r\nNicholas Hall. Susan B. Anthony called the meeting to order, and\r\npresented a list of officers[134] nominated at a preliminary\r\ngathering, which was accepted. Martha C. Wright, on taking the chair,\r\nmade a brief statement of the object of the Convention, and invited\r\nall those who were opposed to our demands to come to the platform and\r\nstate their objections.\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of the Business Committee, Ernestine L. Rose\r\nbriefly reviewed the rise and progress of the woman's rights movement.\r\nAntoinette Brown reported a series of resolutions, on which she\r\ncommented at some length, when the Rev. Samuel J. May was introduced.\r\nAlthough he spoke to the entire edification of the platform, yet he\r\nwas constantly interrupted by the audience. It was a novelty to hear\r\nwomen speak, and the audience having assembled for that purpose,\r\npreferred to listen to woman's pathetic statements of her wrongs, than\r\nto the most gifted orators that men could boast. It was not until\r\nafter repeated requests for order from the president, and assurances\r\nfrom several of the ladies that they would not speak until Mr. May had\r\nfinished his remarks, that quiet was restored.\r\n\r\nIt was at this Convention that Mary L. Booth[135] made her first\r\nappearance on our platform, as one of the secretaries. One feature of\r\nthese meetings was the freedom and warm sympathy between the audience\r\nand the platform. At the close of almost every speech, some one on the\r\nfloor asked questions, or stated some objections which were quickly\r\nanswered and refuted by the speakers in the most pleasant\r\nconversational manner.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rose presented the wrongs of woman in her most happy manner,\r\ndemanding the ballot as the underlying power to protect all other\r\nrights. Thomas Wentworth Higginson made an address especially adapted\r\nto the fashionable audience. Many of the thoughtless ones whom idle\r\ncuriosity had led to the hall, must have felt like the woman of\r\nSamaria (John iv. 29) at the well, when she reported that she had seen\r\na man who told her all the things that ever she had done, so nearly\r\ndid Mr. Higginson picture to them their thoughts and feelings, the\r\nennui of their daily lives. Lucy Stone, whom the papers now call Mrs.\r\nBlackwell, arriving in the midst of the convention, was greeted with\r\nlong and repeated cheers, and spoke with her wonted simplicity and\r\nearnestness. The resolutions covering all the different phases of the\r\nmovement were duly discussed through two entire days.\r\n\r\nAntoinette Brown was called on as usual to meet the Bible argument. A\r\nclergyman accused her of misapplying texts. He said Genesis iv. 7 did\r\nnot allude to Cain and Abel, and that the language in Genesis iii. 16,\r\nas applied to Eve, did not mean the same thing. Miss Brown maintained\r\nher position that the texts were the same in letter and spirit; and\r\nthat authority to all men over all women could be no more logically\r\ninferred from the one, than authority to all elder brothers over the\r\nyounger could be from the other; and that there was no divine\r\nauthority granted in either case.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony announced that woman's rights tracts and papers were for\r\nsale at the door, and urged all who had become interested in the\r\nsubject to procure them not only for their own benefit, but to\r\ncirculate among their neighbors. If they would be intelligent as to\r\nthe real claims of the movement, they must take _The Una_, a paper\r\nowned and edited by one of its leaders. No one would expect to get\r\ntemperance truths from Bennett's _Herald_, nor anti-slavery facts from\r\n_The New York Observer_, or _Christian Advocate_; no more can we look\r\nto any of the popular newspapers, political or religious, for reliable\r\ninformation on the woman's rights movement.\r\n\r\nShe also presented the claims of _The Woman's Advocate_, a paper just\r\nstarted in Philadelphia by Anna E. McDowell, devoted chiefly to\r\nwoman's right to work--equal pay for equal service (she was sorry that\r\nit did not see that the right of suffrage underlies the work problem);\r\nnevertheless the existence of a paper owned, edited, published, and\r\nprinted all by women, was a living woman's rights fact, and she hoped\r\nevery one would give it encouragement and support. She then gave a\r\nbrief report of the work done in the State during the past year,[136]\r\nand closed by presenting the form of petition that had just been\r\nadopted.[137]\r\n\r\nMr. May moved the appointment of a committee of five[138] to engage\r\nlecturing agents and raise funds for their compensation. The president\r\nthanked the people for the respect and attention manifested during the\r\nseveral sessions, and adjourned the Convention.[139]\r\n\r\nThe Saratoga papers were specially complimentary in their notices of\r\nErnestine L. Rose and Lucy Stone, pronouncing them logical and\r\neloquent, and Miss Anthony was highly praised for her skill in getting\r\ncontributions and distributing documents. She sold over twenty\r\nthousand pamphlets that year. As there were many Southern people\r\nalways at Saratoga, this was considered a grand opportunity through\r\ntracts to sow the seeds of rebellion all through the Southern States.\r\nThis Convention afforded a new theme for conversation at the hotels,\r\nand was discussed for many days after with levity or seriousness, to\r\nbe laughed over and thought over by the women at their leisure.[140]\r\n\r\n                        LETTERS TO THE CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n                                              BOSTON, _June 23, 1855_.\r\n\r\n     SUSAN B. ANTHONY.\r\n\r\n     DEAR MADAM:--Your note of the 20th has just come to hand. I am\r\n     sorry to say that my engagements are such that it will not be\r\n     possible for me to be present at the Woman's Rights Convention at\r\n     Saratoga, which I should very much rejoice to attend.\r\n\r\n                         Heartily and hastily yours,\r\n                                                  THEODORE PARKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            SYRACUSE, _June 13, 1855_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR FRIEND:--I like your call to the Convention at Saratoga, and\r\n     I shall endeavor to be there on my return from Massachusetts,\r\n     where I deliver an oration on education on the 8th of August. By\r\n     all means put Judge Hay's name on the Central Committee. Invite\r\n     Theodore Parker without delay.\r\n\r\n                         In great haste, but very truly yours,\r\n                                                     SAMUEL J.

ANTHONY:--Returning home, I hasten to answer thy\r\n     letter forwarded to me a week ago by sister M. C. Wright. It is\r\n     always with regret that I have to answer any letter of the kind\r\n     in the negative. But the time fixed for the Saratoga Convention\r\n     renders it impracticable for me to be present. My husband and I\r\n     hope to attend the National Convention at Cincinnati in October.\r\n     Thy active interest and exertions in this cause are greatly\r\n     cheering. We are doing little hereaway. Pennsylvania is always\r\n     slow in every reformatory movement. We have circulated many of\r\n     the pamphlets.\r\n\r\n     Wishing you all success at the convention, and sure of thy \"great\r\n     recompense and reward,\"\r\n\r\n                         I am thine affectionately,\r\n                                                    LUCRETIA MOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               BOSTON, _June 6, 1855_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR FRIEND:--I have kept your letter by me, and omitted to\r\n     reply, hoping, and indeed expecting, that though I give up all\r\n     but two or three routine and neighboring engagements in the\r\n     summer. I might plan so as to accept yours. But I find I can not\r\n     come as you ask. My summer months must be devoted otherwise. I\r\n     hope you will not nickname me _No_, for my so constantly using\r\n     that monosyllable to you. Indeed, I will try to oblige you next\r\n     winter.\r\n\r\n                         With much regard, yours truly,\r\n                                                 WENDELL PHILLIPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         HIGH ROCK, LYNN, MASS., _August 4, 1855_.\r\n\r\n     EARNEST FRIEND:--We have just received your hearty invitation to\r\n     the Convention at Saratoga. Nothing would give us more pleasure\r\n     than to be with you on that occasion. We are all interested in\r\n     Woman's Rights, and in liberty for all humanity.\r\n\r\n     Long submission has smothered the hope and extinguished the\r\n     desire in many for any change of condition. But the light of the\r\n     nineteenth century should awake all to earnest battle for their\r\n     God-given rights. We will consult together, and if we can make up\r\n     a quartette we will try and be with you to sing once more our\r\n     songs[141] of freedom for another struggling class. With much\r\n     esteem\r\n\r\n                         I remain yours truly,\r\n                                               JOHN W. HUTCHINSON,\r\n                                                      (for the family).\r\n\r\nFollowing the Convention the usual attacks were made by the press,\r\naccusing the members of \"infidelity and free love,\" which Miss Brown\r\nrefuted through _The New York Tribune_. In this way, with conventions\r\nbeing continually held at the fashionable watering places[142] in the\r\nsummer, and at the center of legislative assemblies in the winter, New\r\nYork was compelled to give some attention to the question. A Woman's\r\nEights meeting and a hearing were of annual occurrence as regular as\r\nthe convening of the Legislature.\r\n\r\n\r\nALBANY CONVENTION, 1855.\r\n\r\nThe second Convention at Albany was held in the Green Street\r\nUniversalist Church, February 13 and 14, 1855. Martha C. Wright\r\npresided; the usual speakers[143] were present, and letters of\r\nsympathy were received from Wendell Phillips, T. W. Higginson,\r\nElizabeth Oakes Smith, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, expressing regret at\r\nnot being able to attend.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         LETTER FROM HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\n                                         NEW YORK, _February 8, 1855_.\r\n\r\n     SUSAN B. ANTHONY.\r\n\r\n     DEAR FRIEND:--I can not be in Albany next week, because I some\r\n     time since promised to speak on Wednesday in Maine, and must keep\r\n     my engagement. Nor, indeed, can I deem it of any consequence that\r\n     I should attend your Convention. You know, already, that I am\r\n     thoroughly committed to the principle that _woman shall decide\r\n     for herself_ whether she shall have a voice and a vote in\r\n     legislation, or shall continue to be represented and legislated\r\n     for exclusively by man.\r\n\r\n     My own judgment is that woman's presence in the arena of politics\r\n     would be useful and beneficent; but I do not assume to judge for\r\n     her. She must consider, determine, and act for herself. Whenever\r\n     she shall in earnest have resolved that her own welfare and that\r\n     of the race will be promoted by her claiming a voice in the\r\n     direction of civil government, as I think she ultimately will do,\r\n     then the day of her emancipation will be near. That day I will\r\n     hope yet to see.\r\n                                        Yours,\r\n                                                   HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\nOf the hearings before the Legislature which followed this Convention,\r\nwe give the report from\r\n\r\n                  _The Albany Register, February 17, 1855._\r\n\r\n      JUST AND EQUAL RIGHTS--HEARING BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\n     The select Committee of the Assembly, to which was referred the\r\n     petition for Woman's Rights, granted a bearing to the petitioners\r\n     in the Assembly Chamber on Saturday evening, Ernestine L. Rose,\r\n     Antoinette Brown, and Susan B. Anthony represented the\r\n     petitioners. The arguments were able, and well received. Members\r\n     of the 'Committee and others sent up a number of questions which\r\n     the ladies promptly answered, with a due sprinkling of wit,\r\n     logic, and sarcasm, greatly to the entertainment of the audience,\r\n     which did not disperse until after eleven o'clock.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Rickerson, from the Select Committee, to whom was referred\r\n     \"The Petition for the Right of Suffrage,\" stated that \"after\r\n     mature consideration the Committee unanimously report adversely\r\n     to the prayer of the petitioners.\" Mr. Rickerson, from the same\r\n     Committee to whom was referred--the petition for the just and\r\n     equal civil rights of woman, said: \"The Committee have given the\r\n     petition that examination which time and circumstances would\r\n     allow, and report favorably thereon, as embraced in the bill,\"\r\n     which they introduced.[144]\r\n\r\nThe petitions of 1856 were referred to the Judiciary Committee, Samuel\r\nA. Foote, Chairman. Mr. Foote was at one time a member of the bar of\r\nNew York, associating with some of the first families in the State--a\r\nson, a husband, a father--and yet in his maturer years he had so\r\nlittle respect for himself, his mother, wife, and daughters as to\r\npresent in a dignified legislative assembly the following report on a\r\ngrave question of human rights--a piece of buffoonery worthy only a\r\nmountebank in a circus:\r\n\r\n                    LEGISLATIVE REPORT ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS.\r\n\r\n                   _The Register_, ALBANY, _March, 1856_.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Foote, from the Judiciary Committee, made a report on Women's\r\n     Rights that set the whole House in roars of laughter:\r\n\r\n     \"The Committee is composed of married and single gentlemen. The\r\n     bachelors on the Committee, with becoming diffidence, have left\r\n     the subject pretty much to the married gentlemen. They have\r\n     considered it with the aid of the light they have before them and\r\n     the experience married life has given them. Thus aided, they are\r\n     enabled to state that the ladies always have the best place and\r\n     choicest titbit at the table. They have the best seat in the\r\n     cars, carriages, and sleighs; the warmest place in the winter,\r\n     and the coolest place in the summer. They have their choice on\r\n     which side of the bed they will lie, front or back. A lady's\r\n     dress costs three times as much as that of a gentleman; and, at\r\n     the present time, with the prevailing fashion, one lady occupies\r\n     three times as much space in the world as a gentleman.\r\n\r\n     \"It has thus appeared to the married gentlemen of your Committee,\r\n     being a majority (the bachelors being silent for the reason\r\n     mentioned, and also probably for the further reason that they are\r\n     still suitors for the favors of the gentler sex), that, if there\r\n     is any inequality or oppression in the case, the gentlemen are\r\n     the sufferers. They, however, have presented no petitions for\r\n     redress; having, doubtless, made up their minds to yield to an\r\n     inevitable destiny.\r\n\r\n     \"On the whole, the Committee have concluded to recommend no\r\n     measure, except that as they have observed several instances in\r\n     which husband and wife have both signed the same petition. In\r\n     such case, they would recommend the parties to apply for a law\r\n     authorizing them to change dresses, so that the husband may wear\r\n     petticoats, and the wife the breeches, and thus indicate to their\r\n     neighbors and the public the true relation in which they stand to\r\n     each other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ASSEMBLY--WOMEN'S RIGHTS.\r\n\r\n     Mr. PRENDERGAST presented several petitions asking for an\r\n     extension of Women's Rights. Mr. P. stated that undoubtedly the\r\n     Judiciary was the proper Committee to receive these petitions;\r\n     but the petitioners had signified to him that, from a recent\r\n     manifestation on the part of the Chairman of that Committee\r\n     (Judge Foote), they would prefer that the petition should be\r\n     referred to some other Committee. He therefore moved their\r\n     reference to the Committee on Claims.\r\n\r\n     Mr. NORTHUP seconded the motion.\r\n\r\n     Mr. FOOTE remarked, that if there was any other Committee of this\r\n     House that would or could unsex the female sex, he had no\r\n     objection to the reference moved.\r\n\r\n     The motion prevailed.\r\n\r\nLydia Mott, in a letter to Susan B. Anthony, under date of Albany,\r\nMarch 15, 1856, says:\r\n\r\n     I mail a paper to you, containing the Hon. Samuel A. Foote's\r\n     report on our petitions. I hardly expected any report this\r\n     winter. I am glad he made one; am only sorry it was verbal. There\r\n     ought to have been a large number printed for circulation. I hope\r\n     you won't get discouraged; remember the good work goes bravely\r\n     on, the Honorable Legislature to the contrary notwithstanding. We\r\n     shall get all we demand one of these days. Our reform is so\r\n     comprehensive, we must not expect a sudden change in public\r\n     opinion. Only see how long we have been laboring to convert\r\n     people to the one self-evident truth that a man has a right to\r\n     himself; and where are we now after a quarter of a century? No;\r\n     we must not be disheartened. Our labor has not been in vain. I\r\n     see its good effects every day, and they will continue to\r\n     multiply.\r\n\r\n     Only think, here in our midst we have a constant testimony borne\r\n     to good audiences every Sunday. I don't know whether I wrote you\r\n     what a true man we have in the Unitarian Church, and what a treat\r\n     his sermons are to me. You remember A. D. Mayo, who has written\r\n     letters to our Conventions; he doesn't come as an Unitarian, but\r\n     as an Independent. It can not be otherwise than that he will do a\r\n     world of good. He gave to day one of the boldest as well as\r\n     finest sermons I have ever heard--full of noble thoughts. He\r\n     always recognizes woman in every department. It amuses me to see\r\n     the effect on Rome of the women as he portrays woman side by side\r\n     with man, always making her his equal in every position. Mr. Mayo\r\n     is the first minister who has filled the church, and the only one\r\n     that has not seemed afraid of his own shadow. Mr. Garrison heard\r\n     him when here; said he could not wish to change one word or to\r\n     add one to his sermon. That from Garrison is saying a great deal.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Wm. Hay, who always aided us and watched the Legislature very\r\nclosely in its action upon our question, in a letter to Miss Anthony,\r\ndated March 20, 1856, said:\r\n\r\n     I write this in the Assembly Chamber which has so recently been\r\n     disgraced by an old fogy--Sam. A. Foote. He can not, however,\r\n     prevent the agitation as to Woman's Rights. That of Suffrage has\r\n     been discussed several times this week, incidentally, in both\r\n     Houses, and will be up here again to-morrow directly....\r\n\r\n     March 21st, he says: The petition from Milton, Ulster County, was\r\n     presented yesterday, and referred to the Committee on Claims,\r\n     instead of the Judiciary or a Select Committee. It is thus\r\n     manifest that the cause is not to be put down or even passed by\r\n     with contemptuous silence, vulgar abuse, or conservative scorn.\r\n     Foote squealed out his angry opposition, in the old stupid slang\r\n     (of Shakespeare perverted from \"Macbeth\"), about unsexing woman\r\n     with the right of suffrage, and endeavored to contrast it with\r\n     property-claims; as if the revolutionary maxim concerning\r\n     taxation and representation going together is not a property\r\n     rule. I suspect, too, that personal rights, secured by the right\r\n     preservative of all rights, are more important than mere property\r\n     rights. But they need not be distinguished in that respect. The\r\n     proceeding is (even if without any present beneficial result) a\r\n     triumph; because it proves to Judge Foote and others that the\r\n     Woman's Rights petitions (or rather demands) must receive\r\n     suitable consideration and, at least, a respectful report.\r\n\r\n     Next winter we may hope to be more successful--if not then,\r\n     success is merely postponed. It has become a question of time\r\n     only, and perhaps of place--probably Nebraska!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTH NATIONAL WOMAN'S EIGHTS CONTENTION.\r\n\r\nPursuant to a call issued by the Central Committee, the Seventh\r\nNational Woman's Rights Convention was held in New York, at the\r\nBroadway Tabernacle, November 25 and 26, 1856.\r\n\r\nThe Convention was called to order by Martha C. Wright, President of\r\nthe last Convention.\r\n\r\nThe officers were duly appointed.[145]\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE, on taking the chair, said: I am sure that all present\r\n     will agree with me that this is a day of congratulation. It is\r\n     our Seventh Annual National Woman's Rights Convention. Our first\r\n     effort was made in a small room in Boston, where a few women were\r\n     gathered, who had learned woman's rights by woman's wrongs. There\r\n     had been only one meeting in Ohio, and two in New York. The laws\r\n     were yet against us, custom was against us, prejudice was against\r\n     us, and more than all, women were against us. We were strong only\r\n     \"in the might of our right\"--and, now, when this seventh year has\r\n     brought us together again, we can say as did a laborer in the\r\n     Republican party, though all is not gained, \"we are without a\r\n     wound in our faith, without a wound in our hope, and stronger\r\n     than when we began.\" Never before has any reformatory movement\r\n     gained so much in so short a time. When we began, the statute\r\n     books were covered with laws against women, which an eminent\r\n     jurist (Judge Walker) said would be a disgrace to the statute\r\n     books of any heathen nation.\r\n\r\n     Now almost every Northern State has more or less modified its\r\n     laws. The Legislature of Maine, after having granted nearly all\r\n     other property rights to wives, found a bill before it asking\r\n     that a wife should be entitled to what she earns, but a certain\r\n     member grew fearful that wives would bring in bills for their\r\n     daily service, and, by an eloquent appeal to pockets, the measure\r\n     was lost for the time, but that which has secured other rights\r\n     will secure this. In Massachusetts, by the old laws, a wife owned\r\n     nothing but the fee simple in her real estate. And even for that,\r\n     she could not make a will without the written endorsement of her\r\n     husband, permitting her to do so. Two years ago the law was so\r\n     changed that she now holds the absolute right to her entire\r\n     property, earnings included. Vermont, New Hampshire, and Rhode\r\n     Island have also very much amended their statutes. New York, the\r\n     proud Empire State, has, by the direct effort of this movement,\r\n     secured to wives every property right except earnings. During two\r\n     years a bill has been before the Legislature, which provides that\r\n     if a husband be a drunkard, a profligate, or has abandoned his\r\n     wife, she may have a right to her own earnings. It has not\r\n     passed. Two hundred years hence that bill will be quoted as a\r\n     proof of the barbarism of the times; now it is a proof of\r\n     progress.\r\n\r\n     Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana have also very materially modified\r\n     their laws. And Wisconsin--God bless these young States--has\r\n     granted almost all that has been asked except the right of\r\n     suffrage. And even this, Senator Sholes,[146] in an able minority\r\n     report on the subject, said, \"is only a question of time, and as\r\n     sure to triumph as God is just.\" It proposed that the Convention\r\n     which meets in two years to amend the Constitution of the State\r\n     should consider the subject. In Michigan, too, it has been moved\r\n     that women should have a right to their own babies, which none of\r\n     you, ladies, have here in New York. The motion caused much\r\n     discussion in the Legislature, and it would probably have been\r\n     carried had not a disciple of Brigham Young's, a Mormon member,\r\n     defeated the bill. In Nebraska everything is bright for our\r\n     cause. Mrs. Bloomer is there, and she has circulated petitions,\r\n     claiming for women the right to vote. A bill to that effect\r\n     passed the House of Representatives, and was lost in the Senate,\r\n     only because of the too early closing of the session. That act of\r\n     justice to woman would be gained in Nebraska first, and scores\r\n     of women would go there that they might be made citizens, and be\r\n     no longer subjects.\r\n\r\n     In addition to these great legal changes, achieved so directly by\r\n     this reform, we find also that women have entered upon many new\r\n     and more remunerative industrial pursuits; thus being enabled to\r\n     save themselves from the bitterness of dependent positions, or\r\n     from lives of infamy. Our demand that Harvard and Yale Colleges\r\n     should admit women, though not yielded, only waits for a little\r\n     more time. And while they wait, numerous petty \"female colleges\"\r\n     have sprung into being, indicative of the justice of our claim\r\n     that a college education should be granted to women. Not one of\r\n     these female colleges (which are all second or third rate, and\r\n     their whole course of study only about equal to what completes\r\n     the sophomore year in our best colleges) meets the demand of the\r\n     age, and so will eventually perish. Oberlin and Antioch Colleges\r\n     in Ohio, and Lima College in New York, admit women on terms\r\n     nearly equal with men.\r\n\r\n     In England, too, the claims of women are making progress. The\r\n     most influential papers in London have urged the propriety of\r\n     women physicians. Also a petition was sent to Parliament last\r\n     year, signed by the Brownings, the Howitts, Harriet Martineau,\r\n     Mrs. Gaskell, and Mrs. Jameson, asking for just such rights as we\r\n     claim here. It was presented by Lord Brougham, and was\r\n     respectfully received by Parliament. The ballot has not yet been\r\n     yielded; but it can not be far off when, as in the last\r\n     Presidential contest,[147] women were urged to attend political\r\n     meetings, and a woman's name was made one of the rallying cries\r\n     of the party of progress. The enthusiasm which everywhere greeted\r\n     the name of Jessie[148] was so far a recognition of woman's right\r\n     to participate in politics. Encouraged by the success of these\r\n     seven years of effort, let us continue with unfailing fidelity to\r\n     labor for the practical recognition of the great truth, that all\r\n     human rights inhere in each human being. We welcome to this\r\n     platform man and women irrespective of creed, country, or color;\r\n     those who dissent from us as freely as those who agree with us.\r\n\r\n     ERNESTINE L. ROSE, from the Business Committee, reported a series\r\n     of resolutions.[149]\r\n\r\nThe President stated that several letters had been received, one from\r\nFrancis Jackson, of Boston, one of the noblest of the noble men of the\r\nage, inclosing $50, which, he says, he gives \"to help this righteous\r\ncause along.\" Also a letter from the Rev. Samuel Johnson, of Salem,\r\nMassachusetts, which would be read by Mr. Higginson.\r\n\r\n     Rev. T. W. HIGGINSON said he was much more willing to be called\r\n     upon to read the words of others at this time, than to utter poor\r\n     words of his own. There were many who came into a Woman's Rights\r\n     Convention and started to find men on the platform. He could only\r\n     say, that in these times, and with the present light, there was\r\n     no place where a man could redeem his manhood better than on the\r\n     Woman's Rights Platform. Gentlemen in distant seats were perhaps\r\n     trembling to think that they had actually got that far into this\r\n     dangerous place. They might think themselves well off--no, badly\r\n     off--if the maelstrom did not draw them nearer and nearer and\r\n     nearer in, as it did him. He began, like them, hesitating and\r\n     smiling on the back seats; they saw what he had got to now, and\r\n     he hoped they, too, might get into such noble company before\r\n     long. He was prouder to train in this band than to be at the head\r\n     of the play-soldiers who were marching through the streets\r\n     to-day, and immortalizing themselves by not failing, so utterly\r\n     as some of their companions, to hit some easy target. Those were\r\n     play-soldiers; these were soldiers in earnest.\r\n\r\n     Men talk a great deal of nonsense about the woman's rights\r\n     movement. He never knew a husband who was demolished in an\r\n     argument by his wife, or a young gentleman who found his\r\n     resources of reason entirely used up by a young lady, who did not\r\n     fall back at last when there was no retreat, and say: \"It's no\r\n     use; you can't reason with a woman.\" Well, so it would seem in\r\n     their case. Others shelter themselves behind the general\r\n     statement, that they don't wish to marry a woman's rights woman.\r\n     I have no doubt the woman's rights women reciprocate the wish.\r\n     These appear to have some anxiety about dinner--that seems to be\r\n     the trouble. Jean Paul, the German, wanted to have a wife who\r\n     could cook him something good; and Mrs. Frederica Bremer, the\r\n     novelist, remarked, that a wife can always conciliate her husband\r\n     by having something to stop his mouth. In a conversation in\r\n     Philadelphia the other day, a young lawyer, when told that Mrs.\r\n     Emma R. Coe was studying law with the intention of practicing,\r\n     remarked, that he should never see her in Court, but she would\r\n     remind him of mince pies; to which the gentleman he was in\r\n     conversation with, observed that he had better not get her as his\r\n     antagonist in trying a suit, or she would remind him of minced\r\n     meat. Having given two or three examples of the nonsense of men\r\n     upon this subject, he would now read them some sense. The letter\r\n     was from one of the most eloquent and learned of the younger\r\n     clergy of New England; a man possessed of powers of genius and\r\n     practical wisdom which would yet make him heard in a larger\r\n     sphere than that which he now occupied. It was not the old\r\n     English Sam. Johnson who said that \"there never was a lawsuit or\r\n     a quarrel where a woman was not at the bottom of it.\" This was\r\n     Sam. Johnson Americanized, and of course he was a woman's rights\r\n     man.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     LETTER FROM REV. SAMUEL JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n                                             SALEM, _October 4, 1856_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR FRIEND:--In complying with your desire that I should send a\r\n     few words to the Woman's Rights Convention, I am quite aware that\r\n     in this matter infinitely more depends upon what women do than\r\n     upon what men say; nevertheless, if my confession of faith will\r\n     be of the least service, it shall not be wanting.\r\n\r\n     I regard this movement as no less than the sum and crown of all\r\n     our moral enterprises; as a proclamation of entire social\r\n     freedom, never practicable until now. I welcome it, not merely\r\n     because it aims at delivering half the human race from\r\n     constraints that degrade and demoralize the whole, but also\r\n     because it is opening a new spiritual hemisphere, destined to put\r\n     a new heart into our semi-barbarian theology, politics, manners,\r\n     literature, and law. And especially do I rejoice, that having\r\n     defrauded the feminine element of its due share in practical\r\n     affairs for so many ages, and found ourselves, as a natural\r\n     consequence, drifting toward barbarism with all our wealth and\r\n     wisdom, we are compelled at last to learn that justice to woman\r\n     is simply mercy to ourselves.\r\n\r\n     Doubtless the main obstacles to this work come from her own sex.\r\n     Strange if it were not so; if the meagre hope doled out to women\r\n     hitherto should have unfitted them to believe that such a\r\n     function awaits them. Strange if they did not fear a thousand\r\n     perils in the untried way of freedom. But the unwise distrust\r\n     will have to be abandoned; and so will the conventional flippancy\r\n     and contempt. I think the grand duty of every honorable man\r\n     toward this effort at emancipation is simply _not to stand in its\r\n     way_. For how much is really covered by that duty? It means that\r\n     he must wash his hands of every law or prejudice that dooms woman\r\n     to an inferior position, and makes her the victim of miserable\r\n     wages and fatal competitions with herself. It means that he must\r\n     clear himself of this senseless twaddle about \"woman's sphere,\" a\r\n     matter surely no more for his legislation, than his \"sphere\" is\r\n     for hers; and one upon which, at this stage of their experience,\r\n     it is unbecoming in either to dogmatize; and it means that as a\r\n     simple act of justice, he must resign to her the control of her\r\n     own earnings, secure her fair and full culture, and welcome her\r\n     to the pulpit, the bar, the medical profession, and to whatever\r\n     other posts of public usefulness she may prepare herself to fill.\r\n     As long as he fails of doing this, he is unjustly interfering\r\n     with her sacred rights; and _after_ he has done this, he may\r\n     safely leave the rest to her.\r\n\r\n     It is humiliating indeed that numbers of well-disposed persons\r\n     should not recognize so plain a duty. I have no patience to argue\r\n     it. The moral logic of this movement is as patent as the simplest\r\n     rule in arithmetic. Every argument brought against it resolves\r\n     itself into a sneer at woman's capacity, or an anxiety lest the\r\n     distinction God has established between the sexes will not bear\r\n     testing; or, what is more common still, though covered up in a\r\n     thousand ways, the brutish assertion that \"might makes right.\"\r\n     There is but one answer to these impertinences, and that is the\r\n     success of individual women in the work they set about. The\r\n     current ridicule at \"doing justice to women\" will pass for the\r\n     sheer vulgarity it is, when so many women shall do justice to\r\n     themselves, that they can not be taken as exceptions to prove the\r\n     rule. And this success depends on their own wills. The noble use\r\n     of God's gifts shall make its mark in this world. As sure as God\r\n     lives, it shall compel a becoming respect. For more and more of\r\n     these lessons in true honor do we pray; for the very name of\r\n     manhood must make us blush, so long as it is identified with\r\n     these airs of patronage and control, these insulting obeisances,\r\n     these flatterers of what is childish in women, these sarcasms\r\n     upon what is noblest; worse than all, this willingness to derive\r\n     gain from the degradation and suffering of the sex it professes\r\n     to adore. And words are poor to express the gratitude that shall\r\n     be forever due to those women whose moral energy shall rebuke\r\n     this littleness, and stir true manliness in man.\r\n\r\n                    With sincere respect, I am truly your friend,\r\n                                                   SAMUEL JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n     ERNESTINE L. ROSE remarked, that in the letter read by Mr.\r\n     Higginson there was one sentence that struck her with great\r\n     force, viz: that it is of far greater importance what woman does\r\n     than what man thinks; and, she would add, what woman thinks. The\r\n     influence of what she had done was felt not only in this country,\r\n     but throughout the entire continent of Europe.\r\n\r\n     The author of that letter had expressed another sentiment to\r\n     which she wished briefly to advert. He said that where ten men\r\n     could be convinced of the truth of Woman's Rights, hardly one\r\n     woman could be gained. At first sight it might so appear. But it\r\n     should be borne in mind, that men were more accustomed to think\r\n     and reflect and argue upon everything connected with the legal\r\n     and political rights of men, at least, and, therefore, they were\r\n     more easily convinced. Nevertheless, the subject, whenever\r\n     presented to the mind of woman in its proper light, would not\r\n     fail to find an echo in her heart. Whenever the subject was\r\n     broached to a woman hitherto unacquainted with it, it first\r\n     caused a smile, and, perchance, a sneer; but, put to her a few\r\n     common-sense questions, and the smile disappeared, and her\r\n     countenance assumed a serious expression. Ask her if she is not\r\n     entitled to self-government, to the full development of her\r\n     mental powers, to the free choice of her industrial avocations,\r\n     to proper remuneration for her labor, to equal control of her\r\n     offspring with that of her husband, to the possession and control\r\n     of her own property, and to a voice in making the laws that\r\n     impose taxes upon property that she may hold--ask her a few\r\n     simple, straight-forward questions like these, and see if an\r\n     immediate, hearty, and warm assent is not elicited.\r\n\r\nIn spite of a violent storm a large number assembled in the evening.\r\nThe speakers announced were Mrs. Elizabeth Jones and Wendell Phillips.\r\nMrs. Jones' address was a clear and logical statement of the whole\r\nclaim of woman. By her own request, it was not published.\r\n\r\n     WENDELL PHILLIPS:--Ladies and gentlemen. I am told that the\r\n     _Times_ of to-day warns the women of this Convention that if they\r\n     proceed in their crusade they will forfeit the protection of the\r\n     men. Perhaps, before it is offered, the question had better be\r\n     asked whether it is needed. I do not think that I should run the\r\n     risk of much difference of opinion if I claimed, that nine men\r\n     out of ten would not be able to defend their right to vote as\r\n     logically as the lady who has just addressed us has defended her\r\n     right to vote. I question whether one-quarter of what we call the\r\n     men educated by the colleges, and in active life--the better\r\n     education of the two--would be able, arrogating to themselves as\r\n     they do a far greater political and civil capacity, to state the\r\n     grounds of civil rights and responsibilities, to mark out the\r\n     limits, to vindicate the advantages, and to analyze the bases on\r\n     which these rest, as we have just had it done. If participation\r\n     in civil rights is based on mind--as in this country we claim it\r\n     to be--then certainly to-night we have no right to deny that the\r\n     cause is gained, for the friend who has preceded me has left very\r\n     little for any one to say; she has covered the whole ground.\r\n\r\n     In fact this question is a question of civilization, nothing\r\n     less. The position of woman anywhere is the test of civilization.\r\n     You need not ask for the statistics of education, of national\r\n     wealth, or of crime; tell me the position of woman, and you\r\n     answer the question of the nation's progress. Utah is barbarism;\r\n     we need no evidence; we read it in the single custom that lowers\r\n     the female sex. Wherever you go in history this is true. Step by\r\n     step as woman ascends, civilization ripens. I warn the anxious\r\n     and terrified that their first efforts should be to conquer their\r\n     fears, for the triumph of this crusade is written as certain on\r\n     the next leaf that turns in the great history of the race, as\r\n     that the twentieth century will open.\r\n\r\n     The time was when a Greek dared not let his wife go out of doors,\r\n     and in the old comic play of Athens, one of the characters says,\r\n     \"Where is your wife?\" \"She has gone out.\" \"Death and furies! what\r\n     does she do out?\" Doubtless, if any \"fanatic\" had claimed the\r\n     right of woman to walk out of doors, he would have been deemed\r\n     crazy in Athens; had he claimed the right of a modest married\r\n     woman to be seen out of doors it would have been considered\r\n     fanaticism, and I do not know but that the _Herald_ of that day\r\n     would have branded him as an infidel. But spite of the anchored\r\n     conservatism of others, women got out of doors and the country\r\n     grew, and the world turned round, and so modern Europe has\r\n     progressed. Now the pendulum swung one way, and now another, but\r\n     woman has gained right after right until with us, to the\r\n     astonishment of the Greek, could he see it--of the Turk, when he\r\n     hears it--she stands almost side by side with man in her civil\r\n     rights. The Saxon race has led the van. I trample underfoot\r\n     contemptuously the Jewish--yes, the Jewish--ridicule which laughs\r\n     at such a Convention as this; for we are the Saxon blood, and the\r\n     first line of record that is left to the Saxon race is that line\r\n     of Tacitus, \"On all grave questions they consult their women.\"\r\n     When the cycle of Saxondom is complete, when the Saxon element\r\n     culminates in modern civilization, another Tacitus will record in\r\n     the valley of the Mississippi, as he did in the valley of the\r\n     Rhine, \"On all grave questions they consult their women.\" The\r\n     fact is, there is no use of blinking the issue. It is Paul\r\n     against the Saxon blood; it is a religious prejudice against the\r\n     blood of the race. The blood of the race accords to woman\r\n     equality; it is a religious superstition which stands in the way\r\n     and balks the effort.\r\n\r\n     Europe has known three phases. The first was the dominion of\r\n     force; the second the dominion of money; the third is\r\n     beginning--the dominion of brains. When it comes, woman will step\r\n     out on the platform side by side with her brother. The old Hindoo\r\n     dreamed that he saw the human race led out to its varied fortune,\r\n     and first he saw a man bitted and curbed, and the reins went back\r\n     to an iron hand. Then he saw a man led on and on, under various\r\n     changes, until, at last, he saw the man led by threads that came\r\n     from the brain and went back to an invisible hand. The first was\r\n     the type of despotism--the reign of force, the upper classes\r\n     keeping down the under. The last is ours--the dominion of brains.\r\n     We live in a government where _The New York Herald_ and _New York\r\n     Tribune_, thank God, are more really the government than Franklin\r\n     Pierce and Caleb Cushing. Ideas reign. I know some men do not\r\n     appreciate this fact; they are overawed by the iron arm, by the\r\n     marble capitol, by the walls of granite--palpable power, felt,\r\n     seen. I have seen the palace of the Cæsars, built of masses that\r\n     seemed as if giants alone could have laid them together, to last\r\n     for eternity, as if nothing that did not part the solid globe\r\n     could move them. But the tiny roots of the weeds of Italian\r\n     summers had inserted themselves between them, and the palace of\r\n     the Cæsars lies a shapeless ruin. So it is with your government.\r\n     It may be iron, it may be marble, but the pulses of right and\r\n     wrong push it aside; only give them time. I hail the government\r\n     of ideas.\r\n\r\n     There is another thing I claim. You laugh at Woman's Rights\r\n     Conventions; you ridicule socialism (I do not accept that); you\r\n     dislike the anti-slavery movement. The only discussion of the\r\n     grave social questions of the age, the questions of right and\r\n     wrong that lie at the basis of society--the only voices that have\r\n     stirred them and kept those questions alive have been those of\r\n     these three reforms. Smothered with gold--smothered with material\r\n     prosperity, the vast masses of our countrymen were living the\r\n     lives of mere getters of money; but the ideas of this half of the\r\n     nineteenth century have been bruited by despised reformers, kept\r\n     alive by three radical movements, and whoever in the next\r\n     generation shall seek for the sources of mental and intellectual\r\n     change will find it here; and in a progressive people like ours\r\n     that claim is a most vital and significant one....\r\n\r\n     I contend that woman, broadly considered, makes half the money\r\n     that is made. Go the world over, take either Europe or America,\r\n     the first source of money is intelligence and thrift; it is not\r\n     speculation.... Out of the twenty millions of American people\r\n     that make money, woman does more than half of the work that\r\n     insures the reward. I claim for that half of the race whose\r\n     qualities garner up wealth, the right to dispose of it, and to\r\n     control it by law.\r\n\r\n     Again, take thought. I know our sister has modestly told us how\r\n     utterly they are deprived of what are called the institutions of\r\n     education; but we know very well that book learning is a\r\n     miserably poor thing, and that the best education in the world is\r\n     what we clutch in the streets; and of that education, by hook or\r\n     by crook, woman has so far gained enough, that, Europe and\r\n     America through, where is the man presumptuous enough to doubt\r\n     that the hand of woman is not felt as much on the helm of public\r\n     opinion as that of man? To be sure, she does not have an outside\r\n     ambitious distinction; but at home, in the molding hours, in\r\n     youth, in the soft moments when the very balance-wheel of\r\n     character is touched, we all know that woman, though she may not\r\n     consciously enunciate ideas, does as much to form public opinion\r\n     as man. The time has been--and every man who has ever analyzed\r\n     history knows it--when in France, the mother to Europe of all\r\n     social ideas; France that has lifted up Germany from mysticism,\r\n     and told England what she means and what she wants: France that\r\n     has construed England to herself, and interpreted to her what she\r\n     was blindly reaching out for; when in that very France, at the\r\n     fountain-head of that eighteenth century of civil progress, it\r\n     was in the saloons of woman that man did his thinking, and it was\r\n     under the brilliant inspiration of her society that that mighty\r\n     revolution in the knowledge and science of civil affairs was\r\n     wrought. In this country, too, at this hour, woman does as much\r\n     to give the impulse to public opinion as man does.\r\n\r\n     Wherever I find silent power I want recognition of the\r\n     responsibility. I am not in favor of a power behind the throne. I\r\n     do not want half the race concealed behind the curtain and\r\n     controlling without being responsible. Drag them to the light,\r\n     hold them up as you do men to the utmost study of public\r\n     questions, and to a personal responsibility for their public\r\n     settlement. Corruption--it often takes the very form of the\r\n     passions of woman. In Paris, to-day, we are told, when the\r\n     government approaches a man, the way is, not to give him wealth\r\n     for his own enjoyment, but to dower his daughter. It is the pride\r\n     of woman through which they reach him. Drag that woman forward on\r\n     the platform of public life; give to her manifest ability a fair\r\n     field, let her win wealth by her own exertions, not by the\r\n     surrender of principle in the person of her husband; and although\r\n     my friend doubts it, I believe, when you put the two sexes\r\n     harmoniously in civil life, you will secure a higher state of\r\n     civilization--not because woman is better, not because she is\r\n     more merciful, or more just, or more pure than man, as man\r\n     naturally, but because God meant that a perfect human being\r\n     should be made up of man and woman allied, and it is only when\r\n     the two march side by side on the pathway of civilization that\r\n     the harmonious development of the race begins.\r\n\r\n     Then, again, you can not educate woman, in the sense that we use\r\n     education. She has no motive. As my friend said, when she\r\n     marries, education ceases. At that age the education of man\r\n     commences: he has wealth, ambition, social position, as his\r\n     stimulus: he knows that by keeping his mind on the alert he earns\r\n     them all. You furnish a woman with books--you give her no motive\r\n     to open them. You open to her the door of science: why should she\r\n     enter? She can gain nothing except in individual and exceptional\r\n     cases; public opinion drives her back, places a stigma upon her\r\n     of blue-stocking, and the consequence is, the very motive for\r\n     education is taken away. Now, I believe, a privileged class, an\r\n     aristocracy, a set of slaveholders, does just as much harm to\r\n     itself as it does to the victimized class. When man undertakes to\r\n     place woman behind him, to assume the reins of government and to\r\n     govern for her, he is an aristocrat; and all aristocracies are\r\n     not only unjust, but they are harmful to the progress of society.\r\n\r\n     I welcome this movement, because it shows that we have got a\r\n     great amount of civilization. Every other movement to redress a\r\n     wrong in the past generations of the world has been yielded to\r\n     only from fear. Bentham says truly, the governing race never\r\n     yielded a right unless they were bullied out of it. That is true\r\n     historically; but we have come to a time--and this movement shows\r\n     it--when civilization has rendered man capable of yielding to\r\n     something different from fear. This movement has only been eight\r\n     years on foot, and during that time, we who have watched the\r\n     statute-book are aware to admiration of the rapid changes that\r\n     have taken place in public opinion, and in legislation, all over\r\n     the States. Within the last four years, in different localities,\r\n     woman has been allowed the right to protect her earnings, and to\r\n     make a will--two of the great points of property. Aye, and one\r\n     little star of light begins to twinkle in the darkness of the\r\n     political atmosphere: Kentucky allows her to vote. Yes, from the\r\n     land where on one question they are so obstinate, the white race\r\n     have remembered justice to their white co-equals. In her\r\n     nobly-planned school system, Kentucky divides her State into\r\n     districts; the trustees are annually chosen for the State funds;\r\n     and it is expressly provided, that besides the usual voters in\r\n     the election of trustees for the school fund, which is coveted by\r\n     millions, there shall be allowed to vote, every widow who has a\r\n     child betwixt six and eighteen years old, and she shall go to the\r\n     ballot-box in person or by proxy. Kentucky repudiates the\r\n     doctrine that to go to the ballot-box forfeits the delicacy of\r\n     the sex; for she provides, in express terms, that she shall go to\r\n     the ballot-box in person, or by proxy, as she pleases. It is the\r\n     first drop of the coming storm--it is the first ray of light in\r\n     the rising sun.\r\n\r\n     Civilization can not defend itself, on American principles,\r\n     against this claim. My friend of Brooklyn claims the right to\r\n     make political speeches, as well as sermons, because he is a\r\n     citizen. Well, woman is a citizen too: and if a minister can\r\n     preach politics because he is a citizen, woman can meddle in\r\n     politics and vote, because she is a citizen too. When Mr. Beecher\r\n     based his right, not on the intellect which flashes from Maine to\r\n     Georgia, not on the strength of that nervous right arm, but\r\n     solely on his citizenship, he dragged to the platform twelve\r\n     millions of American women to stand at his side. But the\r\n     difficulty is, no man can defend his own right to vote, without\r\n     granting it to woman. The only reason why the demand sounds\r\n     strange, is because man never analyzed his own right. The moment\r\n     he begins to analyze it, he can not defend it without admitting\r\n     her. Our fathers proclaimed, sixty years ago, that government was\r\n     co-equal with the right to take money and to punish for crime.\r\n     Now, all that I wish to say to the American people on this\r\n     question is, let woman go free from the penal statute--let her\r\n     property be exempt from taxation, until you admit her to the\r\n     ballot-box--or seal up the history of the Revolution, make\r\n     Bancroft and Hildreth prohibited books, banish the argument of\r\n     '76, and let Mr. Simms have his own way with the history of all\r\n     the States, as well as South Carolina. Yes, the fact is, women\r\n     make opinion for us; and the only thing we shut them out from is\r\n     the ballot-box.\r\n\r\n     I would have it constantly kept before the public, that we do not\r\n     seek to prop up woman; we only ask for her space to let her grow.\r\n     Governments are not made; they grow. They are not buildings like\r\n     this, with dome and pillars; they are oaks, with roots and\r\n     branches, and they grow, by God's blessing, in the soil He gives\r\n     to them. Now man has been allowed to grow, and when Pharaoh tied\r\n     him down with bars of iron, when Europe tied him down with\r\n     privilege and superstition, he burst the bonds and grew strong.\r\n     We ask the same for woman. Göethe said that if you plant an oak\r\n     in a flower-pot, one of two things was sure to happen: either the\r\n     oak will be dwarfed, or the flower-pot will break. So we have\r\n     planted woman in a flower-pot, hemmed her in by restrictions, and\r\n     when we move to enlarge her sphere, society cries out, \"Oh!\r\n     you'll break the flower-pot!\" Well, I say, let it break. Man made\r\n     it, and the sooner it goes to pieces the better. Let us see how\r\n     broadly the branches will throw themselves, and how beautiful\r\n     will be the shape, and how glorious against the moonlit sky, or\r\n     glowing sunset, the foliage shall appear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARTHA C. WRIGHT (with autograph).]\r\n\r\n     I say the very first claim, the middle and last claim of all our\r\n     Conventions should be the ballot. Everywhere, in each State, we\r\n     should claim it; not for any intrinsic value in the ballot, but\r\n     because it throws upon woman herself the responsibility of her\r\n     position. Man never grew to his stature until he was provoked to\r\n     it by the pressure and weight of responsibility; and I take it\r\n     woman will grow up the same way.\r\n\r\nThe first three resolutions on the Presidential election were brought\r\nup for discussion and adopted. Those persons in the audience who\r\ndesired to speak were urged to do so.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ROSE said: In reference to this last election, though it was\r\n     not my good fortune to be here during the time of that great\r\n     excitement, being then on the continent of Europe; yet, even at\r\n     that great distance, the fire of freedom that was kindled here\r\n     spread itself across the Atlantic. The liberal, intelligent, and\r\n     reformatory portion of the people of Europe, as well as in\r\n     England, have most warmly, most heartily sympathized with us in\r\n     the last struggle of freedom against slavery. It is a most\r\n     glorious epoch. I will not enter into a political or anti-slavery\r\n     lecture, but simply state this fact--the time has come when the\r\n     political parties are entirely annihilated. They have ceased to\r\n     exist. There is no longer Whig and no longer Democrat--there is\r\n     Freedom or Slavery. We have here an equally great purpose to\r\n     achieve. This, too, is not woman's rights or man's rights, but it\r\n     is human rights. It is based on precisely the same fundamental\r\n     truths with the other question. In the last election the general\r\n     feeling prevailed that woman ought to take more interest in\r\n     political affairs, and with the noble work she did during the\r\n     campaign, it seems to me most extraordinary that the men who have\r\n     worked thus nobly for the freedom of one class, should yet refuse\r\n     freedom to the other class.\r\n\r\n     PHILLIP D. MOORE rose in the body of the building and said:\r\n     During this last Presidential canvass I heard more than once the\r\n     oldest member of Congress declare that Freedom was based upon the\r\n     law of God, which was declared in our Bill of Rights--our\r\n     Declaration of Independence--that it was the inalienable right of\r\n     all mankind to life, to liberty, and to the pursuit of happiness.\r\n     He placed this last Presidential struggle upon that right higher\r\n     than all human law; and upon that it seems this contest in\r\n     behalf of human rights is based. I think that we should adopt\r\n     these resolutions, and also appeal to the legislative bodies,\r\n     where, I believe, there are men who will hear and heed the voice\r\n     of justice.\r\n\r\n     Rev. T. W. HIGGINSON took the floor, and expressed his hope that\r\n     they would have more speaking from the floor and less from the\r\n     platform. As a Republican voter, he would take his stand in\r\n     support of these resolutions; and he would declare that it was\r\n     true that the close of the Presidential election was the time for\r\n     a woman's Convention to be held. It was true that the Republican\r\n     party was pledged, if it had any manliness in it, to support the\r\n     cause of women, to whom it had applied to support its cause every\r\n     day; and it was positively true that, if there were such a thing\r\n     in the land as a Democratic party, that party was the party of\r\n     the women also. As a further illustration of the idea expressed\r\n     by the gentleman who had preceded him, he would state the fact\r\n     that, when he was invited to Vermont to address the Legislature\r\n     in favor of the appropriation of $20,000 for Kansas,[150] the\r\n     meeting was postponed, on the ground that the shortness of the\r\n     notice would not allow time for procuring the attendance of the\r\n     women of the village to fill the galleries, and by their sympathy\r\n     to influence the determination of the members of the Legislature\r\n     who might be present. Accordingly they waited a little longer,\r\n     gave sufficient notice, got the gallery full of ladies, and\r\n     ultimately got the $20,000 appropriation, too. But always when\r\n     the women had given their sympathy and began to demand some in\r\n     return, it was found out that they were very \"dependent\"\r\n     creatures, and that, if they persisted in it, they would forfeit\r\n     the \"protection\" of the men; and this in the face of the fact,\r\n     that when politicians wanted votes and clergymen wanted money,\r\n     their invariable practice was to appeal to the women!\r\n\r\n     The last time he had considered woman's rights he was in a place\r\n     where man's rights needed to be defended--it was in Kansas. No\r\n     man could go to Kansas and see what woman had done there, and\r\n     come back and see the little men who squeak and shout on\r\n     platforms in behalf of Kansas, and then turn to deride and\r\n     despise women, without a feeling of disgust. He would like to\r\n     place some of these parlor orators and dainty platform speakers\r\n     where the women of Kansas had stood, and suffered, and acted. He\r\n     saw, while in Kansas, a New York woman[151]--whose story they\r\n     might remember in the newspapers--how she hospitably prepared, in\r\n     one day, three dinners for the marauders who were hovering around\r\n     her house, and in their starvation became respectful at last, and\r\n     asked her for the hospitality they did not then quite dare to\r\n     enforce; and how they ate her dinner and abused her husband,\r\n     until the good woman could stand it no longer, and at last opened\r\n     her lips and gave them a piece of her mind. He saw that woman.\r\n     She had lived for weeks together in the second story of a log\r\n     hut, with the windows of the lower story boarded up, so that the\r\n     inmates had to climb in by a ladder. She was surrounded by\r\n     pro-slavery camps; and while her husband was in the army, she was\r\n     left alone. The house had been visited again and again, and\r\n     plundered. The wretches would come at night, discharge their\r\n     rifles, and howl like demons. Her little girl, a nervous child,\r\n     had sickened and died from sheer fright. But still, after the\r\n     death of that child, the mother lived on, and still gave\r\n     hospitality to free-soil men, and still defended the property of\r\n     her husband by her presence. At last the marauders burned her\r\n     house over her head, and she retreated for a time. The speaker\r\n     saw her when she was on her way back to that homestead, to\r\n     rebuild the house which she had seen once reduced to ashes by the\r\n     enemy; and she said that if her husband was killed there in\r\n     Kansas, she should preempt that claim, and defend the property\r\n     for her children.\r\n\r\n     He saw another woman, a girl of twenty. He visited a mill which\r\n     had been burnt by Missourians, where piles of sawdust were still\r\n     in flames before his eyes, and there he met her; and when he\r\n     asked to whom that house belonged, she said to her father. And\r\n     when he inquired about her adventures in connection with that\r\n     burning house, this was the story. Twenty-eight hundred\r\n     Missourians were encamped around that house the morning after\r\n     they had burned it. The girl had fled with her mother a mile off,\r\n     but had come back to see if she could save any of the property.\r\n     She walked into the midst of the crowd, and found a man she had\r\n     previously known seated upon her favorite horse. Said she, \"That\r\n     is my horse; get off.\" He laughed at her. She repeated her\r\n     demand. He loaded her with curses and insults. She turned to the\r\n     bystanders--the herd of ruffians who had burned her father's\r\n     house--and said: \"This is my horse; make that man get off.\" Those\r\n     fellows obeyed her; they shrank before that heroic girl, and made\r\n     their companion dismount. She mounted the horse and rode off.\r\n     When she had gone about half a mile, she heard a trampling of\r\n     horses' hoofs behind her. The thief, mounted on a fleeter horse,\r\n     was riding after her. He overtook her, and reining his horse in\r\n     front of her, he seized hers by the bridle, and commanded her to\r\n     let go. She held on. Said he, \"Let go, or it will be the worse\r\n     for you.\" She still held on. He took out his bowie-knife, and\r\n     drew it across her hand, so that she could feel the sharpness of\r\n     the edge. Said he, \"If you don't let go, I will cut your hand\r\n     off.\" Said she, \"Cut if you dare.\" He cut the rope close to her\r\n     hand, and took the bridle from her. It was useless to resist any\r\n     longer, so she slipped off and walked away. But it was not ten\r\n     minutes before she again heard trampling behind, and as she\r\n     looked around, she saw two companions of this miscreant--two men\r\n     less utterly villainous than he--bringing back her horse. Moved\r\n     by her heroism, they had compelled him again to give up the\r\n     horse, had brought it back to her, and she owns it now.\r\n\r\n     That was what great emergencies made out of woman. That girl had\r\n     splendid physical proportions, and though some accident had\r\n     deprived her of her left arm, she had a right arm, however, which\r\n     was worth a good many. She had one arm, and the editor of _The\r\n     New York Times_, he supposed, had two. He was not much\r\n     accustomed to seeking defence of anybody, but he must say that,\r\n     if he ever did get into difficulty as a Woman's Rights man, and\r\n     had to choose between the protection of the one arm of that girl\r\n     in Kansas, and the two of the New York editor, he thought his\r\n     first choice would not be the Lieutenant-Governor. Seeing the\r\n     heroism of the women of Kansas, he told the men of Lawrence, that\r\n     when the time came for them to assert their rights, he hoped they\r\n     would not imitate the border ruffians of the Eastern States, who\r\n     asserted rights for man, and denied them to woman.\r\n\r\nMr. Higginson then reported the following resolution from the Business\r\nCommittee:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the warm sympathies of this Convention are\r\n     respectfully offered to those noble women in England, who are\r\n     struggling against wrongs even greater than those of American\r\n     women, but the same in kind; and we trust that they will follow\r\n     on their demands in logical consistency, until they comprise the\r\n     full claim for the equality of the sexes before the law.\r\n\r\n     This resolution referred, as some of them knew, to the recent\r\n     action of some of the noblest women in England, in behalf of\r\n     juster rights of property and a larger construction of human\r\n     rights than had hitherto prevailed there. The list included a few\r\n     of the very noblest of the women who had helped to make England's\r\n     name glorious by their deeds in literature and in art. It\r\n     included Mrs. Norton, to whom Wendell Phillips had referred, as a\r\n     living proof of the intellectual greatness of woman; she had a\r\n     husband who, after blasting her life by an infamous charge\r\n     against her, which he confessed to his counsel he did not\r\n     believe, now lived on the earnings of the brains of his wife. It\r\n     included, also, Mrs. Somerville, a woman who had forever\r\n     vindicated the scientific genius of her sex, by labors that\r\n     caused the wonder and admiration of scientific men; a woman of\r\n     whom it is said, that she is in all respects true to her sex,\r\n     because while studying the motions of the heavenly bodies, she\r\n     does not forget the motion of the tea-cups around her own table,\r\n     and is as exquisite a housekeeper, as she is wise and\r\n     accomplished as a student. It included also Harriet Martineau,\r\n     that woman who, perhaps more than any other person in this age,\r\n     had contributed to place the last half century in Europe in a\r\n     clear light, by her admirable History, and shown in her treatise\r\n     on Political Economy, a grasp and clearness which few men attain.\r\n     It included also the name of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, that\r\n     woman of rarest genius, of whom her husband, himself the greatest\r\n     of England's living poets, had said that his wife's heart, which\r\n     few knew, was greater than her intellect, which everybody knew; a\r\n     woman whose inspiration had drawn from that husband, in the\r\n     closing poem of his latest volume, the very highest strain which\r\n     modern English poetry had struck, and the noblest utterance of\r\n     emotion that ever man produced toward woman, in the speaker's\r\n     judgment, since the world began. It also included Mary Howitt,\r\n     whose beautiful union with her husband is a proof of what true\r\n     marriage will be, when man and woman are equals, and whose genius\r\n     had brought forth the wonderful powers of another woman whom we\r\n     may fearlessly claim as a co-laborer, Frederica Bremer. These\r\n     were the women of England to whom the resolution referred; women\r\n     who had taken the first step in that movement, of which the full\r\n     enfranchisement of woman will be the last.\r\n\r\n     He could not quite accept the opinion by Mrs. Jones in her\r\n     admirable essay in regard to the superior education of the women\r\n     of England. The women of England, as he took it, did not equal\r\n     the women of America in their average education, although they\r\n     did surpass them in that physical vigor of constitution which, in\r\n     the end, gave greater power of action and thought. Whilst the\r\n     English woman was, by the necessity of the case, taught more of\r\n     the modern languages, she was not so commonly taught either the\r\n     ancient languages or the mathematics, and had not, therefore, the\r\n     same amount of mental training. In England, too, this Woman's\r\n     Rights movement was met by more serious obstacles. It had to\r\n     encounter all the thunders of _The Thunderer_--all the terrors of\r\n     _The Times_--whilst here it had to undergo the very diluted\r\n     thunders of _The Times the Little_. A recent traveler has\r\n     remarked that he could distinguish the Massachusetts women from\r\n     the women of any other State--not because they spoke through\r\n     their nose, or sung psalms, but because they had \"views.\" Every\r\n     woman had her \"views\" upon every subject. It was true that the\r\n     English women had superb frames, grand muscles, fine energies,\r\n     that they spoke two or three languages, but then they usually\r\n     didn't have any \"views\"; and he thanked God that he lived in a\r\n     State where women had them.\r\n\r\n     He had spoken for woman and to woman, because he was a man. He\r\n     did not dare, as a Republican voter, to throw his vote with one\r\n     hand, without doing something for Woman's Rights with the other.\r\n     Men and women were one before God, and this union can not be\r\n     perfect until their equality be recognized. So long as woman is\r\n     cut off from education, man is deprived of his just education. So\r\n     long as woman is crushed into a slave, so long will man be\r\n     narrowed into a despot. Without this movement, the political\r\n     conventions of the present day would only prove to posterity that\r\n     the nation was half civilized; but now future historians will\r\n     record that in 1856, New York had not only her caucuses and her\r\n     ballot-boxes, but her Woman's Rights Convention also.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Rose wished to remark, in reference to the resolution\r\n     offered by Mr. Higginson, that English women, to her knowledge,\r\n     were very active in forwarding the Woman's Rights movement\r\n     throughout Great Britain. And not only English women, but young\r\n     and noble English girls--girls, who were too timid to take part\r\n     publicly in the movement, but who were untiring and indefatigable\r\n     in making converts and enlisting aid. There was Miss Smith, Miss\r\n     Fox, the daughter of the celebrated W. J. Fox, the eloquent\r\n     lecturer and member of Parliament for Oldham, Miss Parkes, and\r\n     others. They had devoted themselves to the great work, which was\r\n     more difficult in that country than this. They had no declaration\r\n     of independence to appeal to, declaring that all men were created\r\n     equal, and endowed with the incalculable right to life, liberty,\r\n     and the pursuit of happiness. They had no such standard to appeal\r\n     to there, because men there were not recognized as free. Banking\r\n     interests, manufacturing interests, land monopolies, and\r\n     monopolies of every other kind were represented in England, but\r\n     not men. The principle of universal suffrage had not yet obtained\r\n     in England, and hence the greater difficulties that woman had to\r\n     encounter there.\r\n\r\n     Another obstacle was the division of the people into classes and\r\n     castes. No movement could make headway in England unless it was\r\n     commenced among what are termed the higher classes. Every\r\n     petition to Parliament must first have some names that have a\r\n     title attached to them before it can obtain other signatures.\r\n     The thinking portion of the middle classes were kept silent to a\r\n     great extent, because of their utter inability to do anything\r\n     unless it was taken up and supported by the higher classes. But\r\n     this state of things would not continue long; there was \"a good\r\n     time coming\" there as well as here. Signatures by thousands had\r\n     been obtained to the Woman's Petition, and she presumed by the\r\n     time it was presented to Parliament it would contain tens of\r\n     thousands of names.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ROSE then offered the following resolution from the\r\n     Committee:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That we also present our assurances of respect\r\n          and sympathy to the supporters of the cause of women in\r\n          Paris, the worthy successors of Pauline Roland and Jeanne\r\n          Deroine, who, in the face of imperial despotism, dare to\r\n          tell the truth.\r\n\r\n     In commenting on this resolution, Mrs. Rose remarked that if the\r\n     difficulties surrounding English women who advocated an\r\n     amelioration of woman's condition were great, how much greater\r\n     were those which surrounded the French women, owing to the blight\r\n     of despotism in that country. They could write their thoughts,\r\n     but their writings could not be published in France. They had to\r\n     send them to the one State in Italy which was not crushed by dark\r\n     and bitter despotism. That bright spot is Sardinia. The works of\r\n     the noble French women had to be sent to Turin, printed there,\r\n     and sent back to Paris for private, secret distribution. And when\r\n     these women met in consultation, they had to watch the doors and\r\n     windows, to see that all was secure. She knew many of them, but\r\n     dared not mention their names, for fear they might be borne\r\n     across the Atlantic, and lead to their oppression and\r\n     proscription. The noblest thoughts that had ever been uttered in\r\n     France were by women, not only before the Revolution, but down to\r\n     the present day. Madame Roland was imprisoned for uttering the\r\n     truth, in consequence of which imprisonment she lost her arm.\r\n     Jeanne Deroine was exiled, and now resides in London, where she\r\n     supports herself, two daughters and son. She was teaching them\r\n     herself, because she had no means to pay for their education. She\r\n     filled their minds with noble thoughts and feelings, even to the\r\n     very sacrifice of themselves for the benefit of the race, and\r\n     more especially for the elevation of woman, without which she\r\n     feels convinced that the elevation of man can never be\r\n     accomplished.\r\n\r\n     But while the names of a few such noble women were made public,\r\n     hundreds, nay, thousands, who had done as much, and even more\r\n     than these, were in obscurity. They were constantly watching to\r\n     find what was done in America. And there was one thing which\r\n     characterized these French women, and that was, the entire\r\n     absence of jealousy and envy of the talents and virtues of\r\n     others. Wherever they see a man or woman of intellect or virtue,\r\n     they recognize them as a brother or sister; and they never ask\r\n     from whom a great thought or a virtuous action comes, but, is it\r\n     good, is it noble? It seemed to her that the character of the\r\n     French women was the very essence of human nobility. They are\r\n     ready to welcome, with heart and hand, every reformer, without\r\n     stopping to inquire whether he is English, American, German, or\r\n     Turk. But poor France was oppressed as she never was before. The\r\n     usurper that now disgraces the throne, as well as the name he\r\n     bears, does not allow the free utterance of a single free\r\n     thought. Men and women are taken up privately and imprisoned, and\r\n     no newspaper dares to publish any account of it.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Rose had concluded, a young gentleman in the rear of the\r\nhall rose from his seat, and desired to make a few remarks. We\r\nsubsequently understood he was from Virginia, and that his name was\r\nLeftwich, a theological student. He asked whether the claims of woman,\r\nwhich had been stated and advocated in the Convention, were founded on\r\nNature or Revelation? He wished Mr. Higginson would enlighten him and\r\nseveral of his friends on that subject.\r\n\r\n     Rev. Mr. HIGGINSON said that he was very glad that it was not a\r\n     place for theological discussion. He was requested to answer the\r\n     query whether the claims of woman, as stated in this Convention,\r\n     were founded in Nature or Revelation. To define either what\r\n     Nature or Revelation was, would involve metaphysical argument and\r\n     abstract considerations that would take up the entire day. The\r\n     basis of the movement was not due to this or that creed. Every\r\n     Woman's Rights man or woman does his or her own thinking. He (the\r\n     speaker) did his own. Included in the movement were men and women\r\n     of all sects. There was Wendell Phillips, who thought himself a\r\n     strict Calvinist; there were on the other hand professed atheists\r\n     among them, and there were, he believed, Roman Catholics, so that\r\n     it would be, in the highest degree, presumptuous for any one man\r\n     to speak on that peculiar topic. Antoinette L. Brown had formed\r\n     her idea of Woman's Rights from the Bible, and some of her\r\n     friends thought that she was wasting her time in writing a\r\n     treatise on Woman's Rights, deduced from Scripture. She was an\r\n     orthodox Congregational minister, ordained in a Methodist\r\n     meeting-house, while a Baptist minister preached the ordination\r\n     sermon. There were some of the Woman's Rights friends who\r\n     believed that we could get support from the Bible, and some who\r\n     believed we could not, and who did not care whether we can or\r\n     not. There were, also, those who simply believed that God made\r\n     man and woman, and knew what He was about when He made\r\n     them--giving them rights founded on the eternal laws of nature.\r\n     It was upon these laws of nature that he (Mr. H.) founded his\r\n     Woman's Rights doctrines. If there was any book or teacher in the\r\n     world which contradicted them, he was sorry for that book and for\r\n     that teacher. Was the gentleman answered?\r\n\r\n     THE GENTLEMAN FROM VIRGINIA rose, in his place, in the rear of\r\n     the building, and replied that he was not answered. Although\r\n     earnestly invited to come upon the platform and address the\r\n     audience, he declined to do so. His remarks, in consequence, were\r\n     inaudible to about one-half the audience. He said it seemed to\r\n     him that there was an inconsistency and an antagonism between\r\n     theology and Mr. Higginson's views, as expressed by himself. The\r\n     gentleman had contradicted himself. He refused to treat the\r\n     question on the ground of revelation, and then declared that the\r\n     claim of Woman's Rights was founded on the fundamental laws of\r\n     God and nature. Here he took issue with Mr. H. The test of the\r\n     naturalness of a claim was its universality. The principles upon\r\n     which it was based must be found wherever man was found, and must\r\n     have existed through all time and under every condition of life.\r\n     What was found everywhere under all circumstances was natural.\r\n     This Woman's Rights claim was not found everywhere even in this\r\n     country, let alone others. He knew many enlightened and refined\r\n     districts which had never heard the principles of this society,\r\n     much less felt them. They were not popular anywhere in the age in\r\n     which they were inaugurated. Therefore they were not founded in\r\n     nature, and the claim of naturalism must fall to the ground. The\r\n     taste for the beautiful, and the love of right, were innate\r\n     faculties of the mind, because they existed everywhere; not so\r\n     with the recognition of the claim of Woman's Rights. Again, the\r\n     claim was not based on revelation, which he would prove in this\r\n     way: Revelation is never inconsistent with itself. The claim for\r\n     woman of the right to vote, inasmuch as she would of necessity\r\n     vote as she pleased, and therefore sometimes contrary to her\r\n     husband, involved a disobedience of her husband, which was\r\n     directly antagonistic to the injunction of the Scriptures\r\n     requiring wives to obey their husbands.\r\n\r\n     AN ELDERLY QUAKER LADY in the body of the audience rose, and told\r\n     the gentleman from the Old Dominion that if he wished to do any\r\n     good he must come on the platform where he could be heard. The\r\n     gentleman declined.\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE said that men had rights as well as women, and she\r\n     would not insist on the gentleman coming to the platform if he\r\n     chose to remain where he was, but it would be more convenient if\r\n     he would come.\r\n\r\n     THE GENTLEMAN FROM VIRGINIA still declined, and proceeded to\r\n     quote Scripture against the Woman's Rights movement.\r\n\r\n     THE QUAKER LADY again started up, and told him he had got hold of\r\n     the letter of the Bible, but not the spirit.\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE desired that each speaker would take his or her turn,\r\n     \"in due order, so that all might be edified.\"\r\n\r\n     THE GENTLEMAN FROM VIRGINIA proceeded. Referring to a remark of\r\n     Mr. Phillips on the preceding evening, in connection with a\r\n     quotation from Tacitus, \"that this movement was Paul against the\r\n     Anglo-Saxon blood,\" he stood by the apostle to the Gentiles, and\r\n     Mr. Phillips might stand by the corrupted Saxon blood.\r\n\r\n     A GENTLEMAN rose and requested him to go upon the platform, as\r\n     half the audience were breaking their necks by trying to listen\r\n     to him. Still the gentleman declined.\r\n\r\n     THE VIRGINIAN argued that woman was not fitted for the pulpit,\r\n     the rostrum, or the law court, because her voice was not powerful\r\n     enough. God gave her a mild, sweet voice, fitted for the parlor\r\n     and the chamber, for the places for which He had designed her.\r\n     God has not given her a constitution to sustain fatigue, to\r\n     endure as man endures, to brave the dangers which man can brave.\r\n     She was too frail, too slender--too delicate a flower for rough\r\n     blasts and tempests. In her whole physical organization there was\r\n     proof that she was not capable of what man was capable. Hers was\r\n     a more beautiful mission than man's--a pure atmosphere was hers\r\n     to breathe. Surrounded by all gentle influences, let her be\r\n     content with the holy and beautiful position assigned to her by\r\n     her Maker. He did not rise to make a speech. He was urged into it\r\n     by the desultory, erratic, shallow, superficial reasonings of the\r\n     gentleman who in one breath invited them to free discussion, and\r\n     in the next defamed and scandalized the editor of _The Times_,\r\n     because he took the liberty to discuss this question freely in\r\n     his paper.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HIGGINSON came forward promptly to reply. He thanked the\r\n     gentleman for his speech. Such speeches were just what the\r\n     Convention wanted. He was glad to hear from the applause which\r\n     followed the gentleman's remarks, that there was a large number\r\n     of persons present who were opposed to the views of the\r\n     Convention. It was of little use talking to friends who already\r\n     agreed with you, but it was always of advantage to talk to\r\n     opponents, whom you might hope to convert. He was glad that those\r\n     who differed with them were there, because it showed that the\r\n     question was one of interest, and was beginning to excite those\r\n     who probably had bestowed but little thought on it before. He did\r\n     not think the gentleman could have meant what he said when he\r\n     accused him of slander. He did not mean to slander anybody. And\r\n     he did not think he quite meant what he said about his erratic\r\n     and shallow reasonings. He would appeal to all if he had not\r\n     treated the gentleman with courtesy. He thought he had answered\r\n     the gentleman's inquiry, when in reply to the question whether he\r\n     founded this claim on nature or on revelation, he said that he\r\n     personally founded it on nature. If there was in the compass of\r\n     the English language any simpler way of answering the question\r\n     than that he did not know it. The gentleman, from the scope of\r\n     his remarks, evinced a considerable love for metaphysical\r\n     theology. His reasoning appeared to be a little dim; perhaps it\r\n     was for want of comprehension on his part. He liked to plant\r\n     himself on the fundamental principles of human nature, and work\r\n     out his opinions from them.\r\n\r\n     In reply to the gentleman's reasoning about the universality of a\r\n     thing being a test of its naturalness, he could say that there\r\n     were a good many races who did not know that two and two make\r\n     four. According to the gentleman's idea of natural laws,\r\n     therefore, it was not natural that two and two should make four.\r\n     But it had always been a question among metaphysicians, which was\r\n     really the most natural condition for man--the savage or the\r\n     civilized state? His own opinion was that the state of highest\r\n     cultivation was the most natural state of man. He tried to\r\n     develop his own nature in that way, and one of the consequences\r\n     of that development was the conviction that two and two made\r\n     four; while another was the conviction that his wife had as much\r\n     right to determine her sphere in life for herself as he had for\r\n     himself. And having come to that conviction, he should endeavor\r\n     to carry it out, and he hoped by the time the young gentleman\r\n     came to have a wife, he would be converted to that principle.\r\n\r\n     In reference to his attack on the editor of _The Daily Times_ for\r\n     the article on the Woman's Convention, which had appeared in the\r\n     edition of the previous day, he remarked that he had read that\r\n     article without any particular reverence for its author. He knew\r\n     the quarter from which it came. There was not a man in New York\r\n     who better understood on which side his bread is buttered than\r\n     the editor of _The Daily Times_. That gentleman always wished\r\n     people to understand that his journal was _The Times_, and was\r\n     not _The Tribune_, and never failed to avail himself of the\r\n     Woman's Rights movement as giving him such an opportunity. Have\r\n     you ever seen a little boy running along the street, and\r\n     carefully dodging between two big boys? If you have, that was the\r\n     editor of _The Times_ between Greeley and Bennett. _The Times_\r\n     seeks to be a journal and nothing else. I will always say of it,\r\n     continued the speaker, that the _reports_ in _The Times_ are\r\n     very perfect and very excellent. I do not mean any disrespect to\r\n     the other reporters present when I say that the report of\r\n     yesterday's proceedings of this Convention, published in this\r\n     morning's _Times_, was fuller and far more perfect than the\r\n     report of any other paper. And so it always is with the reports\r\n     of _The Times_. They are as full, as its criticisms on moral\r\n     subjects are empty.\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE vacated the chair to address the meeting. She was more\r\n     than glad, for the sake of the cause, that this discussion had\r\n     arisen. She was glad that the question had been asked, whether\r\n     this claim was based on nature or on revelation. Many were asking\r\n     the same question, and it was proper that it should be answered.\r\n     If we were living in New Zealand where there is no revelation and\r\n     nobody has ever heard of one, there would yet be an everlasting\r\n     truth or falsehood on this question of woman's rights, and the\r\n     inhabitants of that island would settle it in some way, without\r\n     revelation. The true test of every question is its own merits.\r\n     What is true will remain. What is false will perish like the\r\n     leaves of autumn when they have served their turn.\r\n\r\n     But in regard to this question of Nature and Revelation, we found\r\n     our claim on both. By Revelation I suppose the gentleman means\r\n     Scripture. I find it there, \"He who spake as never man spake\"\r\n     held up before us all radiant with God's own sunlight the great\r\n     truth, \"All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you,\r\n     do ye even so to them\"; and that revelation I take as the\r\n     foundation of our claim, and tell the gentleman who takes issue\r\n     with us, that if he would not take the position of woman, denied\r\n     right of access to our colleges, deprived of the right of\r\n     property, compelled to pay taxes, to obey laws that he never had\r\n     a voice in making, and be defrauded of the children of his love,\r\n     then, according to the revelation which he believes in, he must\r\n     not be thus unjust to me.\r\n\r\n     The gentleman says he believes in Paul. So do I. When Paul\r\n     declares that there is neither Jew nor Greek, neither bond nor\r\n     free, male nor female in Christ, I believe he meant what he said.\r\n     The gentleman says he believes in Paul more than in the\r\n     Anglo-Saxon blood. I believe in both. But when Paul tells us to\r\n     \"submit ourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake,\"\r\n     and to \"fear God and honor the king,\" the heavy tread of the\r\n     Anglo-Saxon blood walks over the head of Paul and sweeps away\r\n     from this republic the possibility of a king. And the gentleman\r\n     himself, I presume, would not assent to the sway of a crowned\r\n     monarch, Paul to the contrary, notwithstanding. Just as the\r\n     people have outgrown the injunction of Paul in regard to a king,\r\n     so have the wives his direction to submit themselves to their\r\n     husbands. The gentleman intimates that wives have no right to\r\n     vote against their husbands, because the Scriptures command\r\n     submission, and he fears that it would cause trouble at home if\r\n     they were to do so. Let me give him the reply of an old lady,\r\n     gray with the years which bring experience and wisdom. She said\r\n     that when men wanted to get their fellow-men to vote in the way\r\n     they desire, they take especial pains to please them, they smile\r\n     upon them, ask if their wives and children are well, and are\r\n     exceedingly kind. They do not expect to win their vote by\r\n     quarreling with them--that would be absurd. In the same way, if a\r\n     man wanted his wife to vote for his candidate he will be sure to\r\n     employ conciliatory means.\r\n\r\n     The golden rule settles this whole question. We claim it as ours,\r\n     and whatever is found in the Bible contradictory to it, never\r\n     came from God. If men quote other texts in conflict with this, it\r\n     is their business, not mine, to make them harmonize. I did not\r\n     quite understand the gentleman's definition of what is natural.\r\n     But this I do know, that when God made the human soul and gave it\r\n     certain capacities, He meant these capacities should be\r\n     exercised. The wing of the bird indicates its right to fly; and\r\n     the fin of the fish the right to swim. So in human beings, the\r\n     existence of a power, presupposes the right to its use, subject\r\n     to the law of benevolence. The gentleman says the voice of woman\r\n     can not be heard. I am not aware that the audience finds any\r\n     difficulty in hearing us from this platform. All Europe and\r\n     America have listened to the voice of Madam Rachel and Jenny\r\n     Lind. The capacity to speak indicates the right to do so, and the\r\n     noblest, highest, and best thing that any one can accomplish, is\r\n     what that person ought to do, and what God holds him or her\r\n     accountable for doing, nor should we be deterred by the senseless\r\n     cry, \"It is not our proper sphere.\"\r\n\r\n     As regards woman's voting, I read a letter from a lady traveling\r\n     in the British provinces, who says that by a provincial law of\r\n     Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, women were actually voters for\r\n     members of Parliament; and still the seasons come and go,\r\n     children are born, and fish flock to that shore. The voting there\r\n     is _viva voce_. In Canada it is well known that women vote on the\r\n     question of schools. A friend told me when the law was first\r\n     passed giving women who owned a certain amount of property, or\r\n     who paid a given rental, a right to vote, he went trembling to\r\n     the polls to see the result. The first woman who came was a large\r\n     property holder in Toronto; with marked respect the crowd gave\r\n     way as she advanced. She spoke her vote and walked quietly away,\r\n     sheltered by her womanhood. It was all the protection she needed.\r\n     In face of all the arguments in favor of the incapacity of woman\r\n     to be associated in government, stood the fact that women had sat\r\n     on thrones and governed as successfully as men. England owes more\r\n     to Queen Elizabeth than to any other sovereign except Alfred the\r\n     Great. We must not always be looking for precedents. New ideas\r\n     are born and old ones die. Ideas that have prevailed a thousand\r\n     years have been at last exploded. Every new truth has its\r\n     birth-place in a manger, lives thirty years, is crucified, and\r\n     then deified. Columbus argued through long years that there must\r\n     be a western world. All Europe laughed at him. Five crowned heads\r\n     rejected him, and it was a woman at last who sold her jewels and\r\n     fitted out his ships. So, too, the first idea of applying steam\r\n     to machinery was met with the world's derision. But its triumphs\r\n     are recognized now. What we need is to open our minds wide and\r\n     give hospitality to every new thought, and prove its truth.\r\n\r\n     I want to say a word upon the resolutions. The present time, just\r\n     after a presidential election, is most appropriate to consider\r\n     woman's demand for suffrage. The Republican party claims\r\n     especially to represent the principles of freedom, and during the\r\n     last campaign has been calling upon women for help. One of the\r\n     leaders of that party went to Elizabeth Cady Stanton and said he\r\n     wanted her help in this campaign; and before she told me what\r\n     answer she made, she asked me how I would have felt if the same\r\n     had been asked of me. I told her I should have felt as Samson did\r\n     when the Philistines put out his eyes, and then asked that he\r\n     should make merriment for them. The Republican party are a part\r\n     of those who compel us to obey laws we never had a voice in\r\n     making--to pay taxes without our consent; and when we ask for our\r\n     political and legal rights, it laughs in our face, and only says:\r\n     \"Help _us_ to places of power and emolument, and _we_ will rule\r\n     over you.\" I know there are men in the Republican party who, like\r\n     our friend Mr. Higginson, take a higher stand, and are ready to\r\n     recognize woman as a co-sovereign; but they are the exceptions.\r\n     There is but one party--that of Gerrit Smith--that makes the same\r\n     claim for woman that it does for man. But while the Republican\r\n     and Democratic parties deny our political existence, they must\r\n     not expect that we shall respond to their calls for aid.\r\n\r\n     Madame de Staël said to Bonaparte, when asked why she meddled\r\n     with politics: \"Sire, when women have their heads cut off, it is\r\n     but just they should know the reason.\" Whatever political\r\n     influence springs into being, woman is affected by it. We have\r\n     the same rights to guard that men have; we shall therefore insist\r\n     upon our claims. We shall go to your meetings, and by and by we\r\n     shall meet with the same success that the Roman women did, who\r\n     claimed the repeal of the Appian law. War had emptied the\r\n     treasury, and it was still necessary to carry it on; women were\r\n     required to give up their jewels, their carriages, etc. But by\r\n     and by, when the war was over, they wished to resume their old\r\n     privileges. They got up a petition for the repeal of the law; and\r\n     when the senators went to their places, they found every avenue\r\n     to the forum thronged by women, who said to them as they passed,\r\n     \"Do us justice.\" And notwithstanding Cato, the Censor, was\r\n     against them, affirming that men must have failed in their duty\r\n     or women would not be clamorous for their rights, yet the\r\n     obnoxious law was repealed.\r\n\r\n     In that story of Mr. Higginson's, of the heroic woman in Kansas\r\n     whose left arm was cut off, there is a lesson for us to learn. I\r\n     tell you, ladies, though we have our left hand cut off by unjust\r\n     laws and customs, we have yet the right hand left; and when we\r\n     once demand the ballot with as much firmness as that Kansas\r\n     daughter did her horse, believe me, it will not be in the power\r\n     of men to withhold it--even the border ruffians among them will\r\n     hasten to restore it. After all, the fault is our own. We have\r\n     sat to\r\n\r\n          \"Suckle fools, and chronicle small beer;\"\r\n\r\n     and, in inglorious ease, have forgotten that we are integral\r\n     parts in the fabric of human society--that all that interests the\r\n     race, interests us. We have never once, as a body, claimed the\r\n     practical application of the principles of our government. It is\r\n     our own fault. Let it be so no longer. Let us say to men:\r\n     \"Government is just only when it obtains the consent of the\r\n     governed\": we are governed, _surrender to us our ballot_. If they\r\n     deride, still answer: Surrender our ballot! _and they will give\r\n     it up_. \"It is not in our stars that we are underlings, but in\r\n     ourselves.\" Woman has sat, like Mordecai at the king's gate,\r\n     hoping that her silent presence would bring justice; but justice\r\n     has not come. The world has talked of universal suffrage; but it\r\n     has made it universal only to man. It is time we spoke and acted.\r\n     It is time we gave man faith in woman--and, still more, woman\r\n     faith in herself. It is time both men and women knew that\r\n     whatever has been achieved by woman in the realm of mind or\r\n     matter, has been achieved by right womanly women. Let us then\r\n     work, and continue to work, until the world shall assent to our\r\n     right to do whatever the capacities God has given us enable us to\r\n     do.\r\n\r\n     SUSAN B. ANTHONY rose and said that several gentlemen had handed\r\n     her contributions, one $40, another $25. She trusted that all New\r\n     York men and women would find they had something more to do than\r\n     listen to speeches.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        LETTER FROM HORACE GREELEY.\r\n\r\n                                        NEW YORK, _November 22, 1856_.\r\n\r\n     MY FRIEND:--You are promised to be present and speak at the\r\n     approaching \"Woman's Rights Convention.\" I, too, mean to attend\r\n     its deliberations, or some portion thereof, but not to take part\r\n     in them. For I find this evil apparently inseparable from all\r\n     Radical gatherings: a very large and influential portion of the\r\n     press, including, I grieve to say, religious as well as secular\r\n     journals, are prone and eager to expose to odium those whom they\r\n     would undermine and destroy, by attributing to them, not the\r\n     sentiments they have personally expressed, but those of others\r\n     with whom they are or have been associated in some reformatory\r\n     movement. He, then, who appears as a speaker at a Woman's Rights\r\n     Convention is made responsible for whatever may be uttered at\r\n     such Convention--no matter by whom--which is most likely to\r\n     excite popular prejudice and arouse popular hostility. I have\r\n     borne a good share of this unfairly exalted and unjust odium,\r\n     with regard to the dietetic, anti-slavery, and social reforms\r\n     suggested in our day, and shall bear on as patiently as I may;\r\n     but I grow older, and do not confront the world on a fresh issue\r\n     with so light a heart, so careless a defiance, as I might have\r\n     done twenty years ago. Allow me, then, through you, to say what I\r\n     think of the woman's rights movement, its objects, incitements,\r\n     and limitations. If I may thus attain perspicuity, I can bear the\r\n     imputation of egotism.\r\n\r\n     1. I deem the intellectual, like the physical capacities of women\r\n     unequal in the average to those of men; but I perceive no reason\r\n     in this natural diversity for a factitious and superinduced legal\r\n     inequality. On the contrary, it seems to me that the fact of a\r\n     natural and marked discrepancy in the average mental as well as\r\n     muscular powers of men and women ought to allay any apprehensions\r\n     that the latter, in the absence of legal interdicts and\r\n     circumscriptions, would usurp the functions and privileges of the\r\n     former.\r\n\r\n     2. I believe the range of employment for woman, in our age and\r\n     country, far too restricted, and the average recompense of her\r\n     labor, consequently far less than it should be. In saying this, I\r\n     do not intimate a doubt that the best possible employment for\r\n     most women is to be found in the care and management of their own\r\n     households respectively, with the rearing and training of their\r\n     children. But many women, including some of the most noble and\r\n     estimable, are never called to preside over households; while\r\n     some of the called are impelled to decline the invitation. In\r\n     point of fact, then, there is and always will be a large\r\n     proportion of the gentler sex who are, at least temporarily,\r\n     required to earn their own subsistence, and vindicate their own\r\n     usefulness in some other capacity than that of the loved and\r\n     honored wife and mother. The maiden or widow, blessed with\r\n     opulence, ought to be insured against the worse calamities of a\r\n     reverse of fortune, by the mastery of some handicraft or\r\n     industrial avocation; she ought to lead a life of persistent and\r\n     efficient industry, as the fulfillment of a universal duty; while\r\n     her unportioned sister must do this or grovel in degrading\r\n     idleness and dependence on a father's or brother's overtaxed\r\n     energies, looking to marriage as her only chance of escape\r\n     therefrom. For man's sake, no less than woman's, it is eminently\r\n     desirable that that large portion of our women, who are not\r\n     absorbed in domestic cares, should be attracted and stimulated to\r\n     industry by a wider range of pursuits, and a consequent increase\r\n     of recompense. I deem it at once unjust and--like all\r\n     injustice--impolitic, that a brother and sister, hired by the\r\n     same farmer, the one to aid him in his own round of labor, the\r\n     other to assist his wife in hers, should be paid, the one twelve\r\n     to twenty, the other but four to six dollars per month. The\r\n     difference in their wages should be no greater than in their\r\n     physical and mental ability. Still more glaring is this\r\n     discrepancy, when the two are employed as teachers, and, though\r\n     of equal efficiency, the one is paid five hundred dollars per\r\n     annum, the other but two, or in that proportion, merely because\r\n     the former is a man and the latter a woman. While such\r\n     disparities exist, right here in this metropolis of American\r\n     civilization and Christianity, it is in vain that Conservatism\r\n     stops its ears and raises its eyebrows at the announcement of a\r\n     Woman's Rights Convention.\r\n\r\n     3. Regarding marriage as the most important, most sacred, and\r\n     tender of human relations, and deeming it irrevocable, save by\r\n     death, it seems to me essential that woman should be proffered\r\n     such a range of employments, with such adequate recompense, as to\r\n     enable her at all times to support herself in honored and\r\n     virtuous independence, so that marriage shall be accepted by her\r\n     at the dictates of love, and not of hunger. Much might be urged\r\n     on this point, but I choose simply to commend it to the\r\n     consideration of others.\r\n\r\n     4. As to woman's voting or holding office, I defer implicitly to\r\n     herself. If the women of this or any other country believe their\r\n     rights would be better secured and their happiness promoted by\r\n     the assumption on their part of the political franchises and\r\n     responsibilities of men, I, a Republican in principle from\r\n     conviction, shall certainly interpose no objection. I perceive\r\n     what seem to be serious practical difficulties in the way of\r\n     realizing such assumption; but these are difficulties, not for\r\n     me, but for them. I deem it unjust that men should be so\r\n     constantly and unqualifiedly impeached as denying rights to woman\r\n     which the great majority of women seem quite as reluctant to\r\n     claim as men are to concede. I apprehend that whenever women\r\n     shall generally and earnestly desire an equality of political\r\n     franchises with men, they will meet with little impediment from\r\n     the latter.\r\n\r\n     5. I can not share at all in the apprehensions of those who are\r\n     alarmed at the Woman's Rights agitation, lest it should result in\r\n     the unsexing of woman, or her general deflection from her proper\r\n     sphere. On the contrary, I feel sure that the freest inquiry and\r\n     discussion will only result in a clearer and truer appreciation\r\n     of woman's proper position, and a more general and rigid\r\n     adherence thereto. \"Let there be light!\" for this is an\r\n     indispensable condition of all true and healthy growth. Let all\r\n     convictions find free utterance--all grievances be stated and\r\n     considered. In the range of my observation, I have found those\r\n     women who were conscious of defects in the present legal and\r\n     social position of their sex among the most zealous, faithful,\r\n     and efficient in the discharge of their household and parental\r\n     duties. I feel confident that a general discussion of the subject\r\n     of Woman's Rights will result in a more general recognition and\r\n     cheerful performance of woman's appropriate duties.\r\n\r\n                                   Very truly yours,\r\n                                                   HORACE GREELEY.\r\n     Rev. SAMUEL J. MAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n            LETTER FROM HON. WILLIAM HAY, OF SARATOGA SPRINGS.\r\n\r\n     I acknowledge, with much pleasure, the receipt of a printed\r\n     circular, calling for the Seventh Woman's Rights Annual\r\n     Convention. I also acknowledge, with increased pleasure, and\r\n     perhaps with more pride than becomes me, the accompanying\r\n     invitation to attend that Convention, and take part in its\r\n     proceedings. I like this word, because it implies progress.\r\n\r\n     Pre-engagement will prevent my personal attendance at the\r\n     Broadway Tabernacle, but, be assured, my heart shall be there,\r\n     with all its desires and hopes for the future of humanity;\r\n     because I am convinced that until the individual and social\r\n     rights of our whole race, without distinction of caste or sex,\r\n     shall have been universally recognized, the tyrannies of earth\r\n     will not cease from oppressing it.\r\n\r\n     I wish that every woman in the United States could be at New\r\n     York, throughout the continuance of your Convention, where each\r\n     might see for herself, in Mrs. Lucretia Mott, what woman may be,\r\n     and should be, and must be, before her sex can attain,\r\n     individually and socially, \"that equal station to which the laws\r\n     of Nature and of Nature's God entitle\" her. For physical and\r\n     mental improvement of man's condition, according to his\r\n     birthright and educational capacity, there must be, in America,\r\n     more Marys, the mothers of Washingtons.\r\n\r\n     The great political and legal reform announced in your circular,\r\n     contemplating complete development of the entire human race, is\r\n     already operating, sympathetically and auspiciously, in Europe,\r\n     upon preeminent minds, like that of Lord Brougham, and may\r\n     favorably react, in practical adoption here, of Jefferson's\r\n     elementary truth (almost a self-evident proposition, and yet\r\n     treated as theory), that government derives its just powers from\r\n     suffrage-consent of all (not half) of the governed. Partial\r\n     consent (especially by and to a moiety of mankind, arrogantly\r\n     claiming, like Louis XIV., to be the State) can confer only\r\n     unjust power, which Heaven's higher law of liberty, equality, and\r\n     justice never sanctioned.\r\n\r\n     Your Convention is most opportune, for this Continent is\r\n     threatened with permanent and peculiar danger, produced by the\r\n     feudal condition of women. I allude to the increasing curse of\r\n     Mormonism, a consequence of woman's legalized inferiority or\r\n     nonentity. With power from your local situation and undoubted\r\n     sphere, to influence, for all time, the destiny of every\r\n     civilized country, the members of your Convention, conscious of\r\n     their duty, will never flinch from the responsibility of their\r\n     position. It requires an unequivocal and uncompromising claim for\r\n     perfect equality of rights in every department of manual and\r\n     machine labor, of thought, of speech, of government, of society,\r\n     and of life itself. Indeed, testamentary provision for assertion\r\n     of that claim, by those few fortunate women who have, like Mrs.\r\n     Blandina Dudley[152], wealth to bestow, should become a ruling\r\n     principle, instead of that passion, so strong in death, for\r\n     posthumous pulpit and newspaper applause, which Protestantism has\r\n     sagaciously substituted in lieu of the saving ordinances of the\r\n     Roman Catholic Church.\r\n\r\n                                   Respectfully yours,\r\n                                                      WILLIAM HAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        LETTER FROM FRANCES D. GAGE\r\n\r\n                                       ST. LOUIS, _November 19, 1856_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR LUCY STONE:--Most earnestly did I desire to attend this\r\n     Seventh National Convention, more especially as I felt that I\r\n     should be the only representative from the west side of the great\r\n     Father of Waters. But it is impossible for me to remove the\r\n     barriers just now opposed to so long a journey and absence from\r\n     home. There is much thought in the free States of the great\r\n     West--much less of conservatism and rigid adherence to the\r\n     old-time customs of law and theology among the masses, than in\r\n     the East. Thousands are becoming ready to be baptized into a new\r\n     faith, a broader and holier recognition of the rights of\r\n     humanity. The harvest-fields are ripening for the reapers.\r\n\r\n          The gloomy night is breaking--\r\n            E'en now the sunbeams rest\r\n          With a bright and cheering radiance\r\n            On the hill-tops of the West;\r\n          The mists are slowly rising\r\n            From the valley and the plain,\r\n          And a spirit is awaking\r\n            That shall never sleep again.\r\n\r\n     But since I can not meet you in your councils, I will endeavor to\r\n     allay the disappointment by striving to reach with my pen some of\r\n     the sunset homes in the far West, and endeavor to arouse woman\r\n     there to her duties and responsibilities, that she may sympathize\r\n     more fully with her Eastern sisters, who caught the first glow of\r\n     the sunrise hour of our great reform movement. With sincere and\r\n     earnest wishes for your advancement in right and truth,\r\n\r\n                         I am respectfully yours,\r\n                                                  FRANCES D. GAGE.\r\n\r\n     Mr. HIGGINSON was then introduced. Mrs. President, and Ladies and\r\n     Gentlemen: I think, as perhaps some of you do, that a\r\n     disproportionately large portion of the time of the meeting\r\n     to-day has been taken up by the speeches of men; therefore I do\r\n     not intend that this man's speech shall be a very long one. I\r\n     remember a certain sermon, of which it was said it had nothing\r\n     good in it except its subject and its shortness. My speech is\r\n     going to be like that sermon. But there is one great advantage\r\n     which men, enjoy in speaking on a Woman's Rights platform: they\r\n     can not help doing good to the movement, no matter how they\r\n     speak; for if a man speaks well, of course he helps it by his\r\n     speech; and if he speaks ill on the subject, he still helps it,\r\n     because there are women about him who won't speak ill, and the\r\n     comparison is useful.\r\n\r\n     I wish to take up a point which, as a man, I am entitled to claim\r\n     should have more prominence given it than has yet been the case;\r\n     a point touched upon by me previously, in something I said\r\n     yesterday, which some of you thought was not correct; and a point\r\n     touched upon by Wendell Phillips this afternoon. I mean the claim\r\n     of the Woman's Rights movement on woman; the wrong done by woman\r\n     to that movement; and the injustice of the charge against man,\r\n     that he especially resists it. And yet I can not fully accept the\r\n     position taken by Rev. Mr. Johnson and Horace Greeley, that man's\r\n     duty is only to stand aside and let woman take her rights. Not\r\n     so. It is not so easy as that, let me tell you, gentlemen, to get\r\n     rid of the responsibility of years of wrong. We men have been\r\n     standing for years with our hands crushing down the shoulders of\r\n     woman, so that she should not attain her true altitude; and it is\r\n     not so easy, after we have cramped, dwarfed, and crippled her, to\r\n     get rid of our responsibility by standing back at last, and\r\n     saying, \"There, we will let you go; stand up for yourself.\" If it\r\n     is true, as these women say, that we have wronged them for\r\n     centuries, we have got to do something more than mere negative\r\n     duty. By as much as we have helped to wrong them, we have got to\r\n     help to right them; by as much as we have discouraged them\r\n     heretofore, we have got to encourage them hereafter; and that is\r\n     why I wish to speak to women to-night of their duties, as these\r\n     women have spoken to us of ours. I want to remind them that the\r\n     time has come when men must appeal to them; for be assured that\r\n     when women are ready to claim their rights, men will be ready to\r\n     grant them.\r\n\r\n     There are three special obstacles, Mrs. President, to the\r\n     willingness of woman to do her simple duty to the Woman's Rights\r\n     movement. The first is the obstacle of folly--sheer,\r\n     unadulterated folly--the folly in which women are trained, and in\r\n     which we men help to train them, and for which we then denounce\r\n     them. The reason why many women don't like the Woman's Rights\r\n     movement, is because they have too little real thought in them to\r\n     appreciate it at all. They have been brought up as fashionable\r\n     society brings up woman on one side, or as mere household\r\n     drudgery brings them up on the other--in each case, without power\r\n     to appreciate a great principle--without power to appreciate a\r\n     sublime purpose--without power to appreciate anything but a \"good\r\n     match,\" and the way to obtain it. On their entrance into life,\r\n     their choice lies, for social position, for enjoyment, for\r\n     occupation, for usefulness, in this narrow alternative--between a\r\n     husband and nothing; and that, as Theodore Parker once said, is\r\n     very often a choice between two nothings. These women may have\r\n     literary culture and social polish; but, for want of an idea to\r\n     light up their eyes and strengthen their souls, these things are\r\n     only glitter and worthlessness.\r\n\r\n     A certain celebrated French woman in the last century (Mlle. de\r\n     Launay), who made mathematical science her study, at last had a\r\n     lover; whereupon she partially forgot her mathematics, and only\r\n     remembered enough of it for practical purposes. And, in her\r\n     Memoirs, she mentions the fact that her lover at length began to\r\n     be less attentive to her; so much so, that she observed that\r\n     whereas in walking home with her in the evening, he used to take\r\n     pains to go round the two sides of the public square, in order to\r\n     make the walk as long as possible, he now cut it short by always\r\n     striking across the center; \"so that his love for me,\" she\r\n     observes, \"must have decreased in the inverse ratio between the\r\n     diagonal of a rectangular parallelogram and the sum of two\r\n     adjacent sides.\" Who shall say that mathematics are wasted on a\r\n     woman after that? Now, that is the sum of the science that is\r\n     taught in half our institutions of education, in more than half\r\n     our fashionable boarding-schools, in nearly all the most\r\n     cultivated social circles in the land. How can you expect, from\r\n     such women, any nobleness or appreciation of nobleness? How can\r\n     you expect any from such a woman's husband, when all his thoughts\r\n     of woman have been crushed down, by sad experience, to the level\r\n     of his wife's capacities? When I find a man who is obstinate\r\n     against Woman's Rights, I try to find out either what sort of a\r\n     mother or what sort of a wife that man has, and there I find the\r\n     key to his position; for how can you expect any man to have a\r\n     noble and equal idea of woman, when his mother knows nothing in\r\n     the universe beyond a cooking-stove, and his wife has not much\r\n     experimental acquaintance even with that?\r\n\r\n     No; the first obstacle to this Woman's Rights movement is the\r\n     feminine, that builds all its hopes upon the wretched adulation\r\n     and flattery of men--that thinks \"the gentlemen admire weakness\r\n     in a woman.\" Well, so they do admire to flatter it and to laugh\r\n     at it! Those are the women who have called out from gifted men,\r\n     age after age, those terrible denunciations of which literature\r\n     is full. Women who are here, who think men admire weakness in a\r\n     woman, let me tell you that if you want to know what men really\r\n     think of women, you must go beyond the flatteries of the\r\n     ball-room; you must go beyond the compliments of the public\r\n     speaker. You must follow your young admirer from the ball-room\r\n     into the bar-room, where he ridicules you among his companions,\r\n     and laughs at the folly he has been flattering. You must pass\r\n     from the public meeting into the office or study, to learn how\r\n     the man who flatters woman most may despise her in his heart.\r\n\r\n     Think what great men of the world have said of woman. Voltaire\r\n     said: \"Ideas are like beards--women and young men have none.\"\r\n     Lessing, the German, says: \"The woman who thinks is like a man\r\n     who puts on rouge--ridiculous.\" Dr. Maginn, that accomplished\r\n     literary man, says: \"We like to hear a few words of wit from a\r\n     woman, just as we like to hear a few words of sense from a\r\n     parrot--because they are so unexpected.\" These things were never\r\n     said to women, but they were said of them. In the presence of\r\n     female intellect, men are very often like that Englishman who was\r\n     reproached by the judge in the police-court, because he, being a\r\n     very large, athletic man, allowed his wife, who was a very\r\n     delicate, puny woman, occasionally, to beat him. Said the judge:\r\n     \"How can you allow it? you have ten times her strength.\" \"Oh,\"\r\n     said the giant, drawing himself up to his full stature, \"it is no\r\n     great matter; it pleases her, and it don't hurt me.\" That is the\r\n     way men deal with female intellect--they like to amuse themselves\r\n     with it, to flatter it as an entertaining trifle. But when it\r\n     comes in earnest, and shows itself, then it is that these men\r\n     stand apart from the new spectacle of a woman transformed into a\r\n     thinker and worker; while true men rejoice to see nobleness in a\r\n     woman. There is not a man here who does not, in his own highest\r\n     moments, reverence in woman the same qualities he admires in\r\n     himself, if he thinks he claims them. Power of clear thought and\r\n     of heroic action--every man admires these in woman in the best\r\n     moments of his life. It is when he lowers himself to the level of\r\n     the public meeting, or of the fashionable drawing-room, that he\r\n     is changed into a flatterer, and he who flatters always despises\r\n     the object of his flattery.\r\n\r\n     Another source of opposition to this movement among women is\r\n     founded in Fear. It does not require much courage for a man to\r\n     stand on a Woman's Rights platform. I do not say that it does not\r\n     require more than a good many men have, for it would be difficult\r\n     to find a thing so easy as not to do that. He, of course, has to\r\n     run the gauntlet of the old nonsense of \"strong-minded women and\r\n     weak-minded men.\" Well, I am willing to be accounted weak-minded\r\n     in the presence of strength of mind and heart, with which it has\r\n     been my privilege to be associated in this movement. That is a\r\n     small thing, and it is the experience of every man who has\r\n     entered into this reform, that if he had a fiber of manhood in\r\n     him heretofore, that fiber had been doubled, trebled, and\r\n     quadrupled before he had been in it a year. Instead of requiring\r\n     courage for a man to enter into this movement, it rather requires\r\n     courage to keep out of it, if he is a logical, clear-headed man.\r\n     But with a woman it is different. She needs much courage. A woman\r\n     who, for instance, has been engaged in some literary avocation,\r\n     and obtained some position, does not wish to risk her reputation\r\n     by connecting herself with those who advocate the right of woman,\r\n     not merely to write and to speak, but to vote also; hence, while\r\n     admitting, secretly admitting, the justice of the claim, she will\r\n     shrink back from avowing it for fear of \"losing her position.\"\r\n     How can any brave man honor such a recreant woman as that, who,\r\n     having gained all she wants to herself, under cover of the bolder\r\n     efforts of these nobler spirits, then settles back upon the ease\r\n     and comfort of that position, and turns her small artillery on\r\n     her own sisters? I feel a sense of shame for American literature,\r\n     when I think how our literary women shrink, and cringe, and\r\n     apologize, and dodge to avoid being taken for \"strong-minded\r\n     women.\" Oh, there's no danger. I don't wonder that their literary\r\n     efforts are stricken with the palsy of weakness from the\r\n     beginning. I don't wonder that our magazines are filled with\r\n     diluted stories, in which sentimental heroines sigh, cry, and die\r\n     through whole pages of weary flatness, and not a single noble\r\n     thought relieves that Sahara of emptiness and barrenness. It is a\r\n     retribution on them. A man or woman can not put in a book more\r\n     than they have in themselves, and if woman is not noble enough to\r\n     appreciate a great thought, she is not noble enough to write one.\r\n     I don't wonder that their fame does not keep the promise of its\r\n     dawn, when that dawn is so dastardly.\r\n\r\n     The time will come, let me tell you, ladies, when the first\r\n     question asked about any woman in this age who is worth\r\n     remembering will be, \"Did that woman comprehend her whole sphere?\r\n     Did she stand beside her sisters who were laboring for the right?\r\n     If she did not this, it is no matter what she did.\" It is thus we\r\n     already begin to judge the American women of the past. The time\r\n     will come, when of all Mrs. Adams' letters, the passage best\r\n     remembered will be that, where she points out to her great\r\n     husband, that while emancipating the world, he still believes in\r\n     giving men the absolute control over women. So the time will come\r\n     when Harriet Beecher Stowe will be less honored, even as the\r\n     authoress of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" than as the woman who in _The\r\n     New York Independent_, that repository of religious thought,\r\n     dared to place it among her religious thoughts, that Antoinette\r\n     Brown had a right to stand in the pulpit. I wish Mrs. Stowe were\r\n     yet more consistent; I wish she were not satisfied with merely\r\n     wishing that others would attend Woman's Rights Conventions, and\r\n     support Woman's Rights Lectures, but would join and take part in\r\n     these things herself, as I believe she will when her brave spirit\r\n     has gone a little further. Her heroic brother, Henry Ward\r\n     Beecher, is with us already in the public advocacy of the right\r\n     of suffrage for women.\r\n\r\n     The third obstacle that sets woman against this movement is\r\n     _prejudice_. It is the honest feeling of multitudes of women that\r\n     their \"natural sphere,\" their domestic duties, will be interfered\r\n     with by any other career. Let me tell you that so judging, you\r\n     have only learned half the story we have to tell. We encourage\r\n     these domestic duties most fully and amply. There is not a woman\r\n     here who is not proud to claim them. Of all the women who have\r\n     stood or spoken on this platform since this Convention began,\r\n     there is only one who is not a married woman; there are very few\r\n     who are not mothers; and among them all there is not one who does\r\n     not give, by the nobleness of her domestic life, a proof of the\r\n     consistency of that with the rest of the claims she makes for her\r\n     sex. Some there are who doubt this; some there are who do not see\r\n     how the elective franchise is any way connected with home duties\r\n     and cares. I tell you there is the closest connection. If any one\r\n     thing caps the sum of the argument for the rights of woman, it is\r\n     the fact of those domestic duties which some idly array against\r\n     it. What has a man at stake in society? What has he to risk by\r\n     his ballot? Ask him at the ballot-box, and you will hear his\r\n     statement. You will hear it in a thousand ways, and in a thousand\r\n     voices. His own personal interest. A man invests _himself_ in\r\n     society; woman invests infinitely more, for she throws in _her\r\n     child_. The man can run away to California with his interests,\r\n     and from his duties; the woman is anchored to her home. It is\r\n     important to him, you say, whether the community provides, by its\r\n     statutes, schools or dram-shops. Then how vast, how unspeakable\r\n     the importance to her! Deprive every man in the nation of the\r\n     ballot, if you will, but demand, oh, demand its protection for\r\n     the wife and the mother!\r\n\r\n     See the unjust workings of the present system. I knew in a town\r\n     in Massachusetts a widow woman, who paid the highest tax bill in\r\n     the town; nay, for every dollar that any man paid in the town,\r\n     she paid two, and yet that woman had not the right to the ballot,\r\n     which belonged to the most ignorant Irishman in her employ. She\r\n     hadn't the right to protect her child from the misappropriation\r\n     of his property; and if she had owned the whole town, and there\r\n     had not been any other person to pay a property tax except that\r\n     solitary woman, the case would have been the same, and not the\r\n     slightest power of protection would have been in her hands,\r\n     against the most outrageous misappropriation.\r\n\r\n     In another town of Massachusetts there is a story told of a man,\r\n     a member of the Society of Friends. He was once sending his wife\r\n     on a long journey. As she was about to set forth in the stage,\r\n     \"My dear,\" said she, \"thee has forgotten to give me any money for\r\n     my journey.\" \"Why,\" said the Quaker, \"thee knows very well that I\r\n     paid thy fare in the stage.\" \"But thee knows,\" said she, \"that I\r\n     am going to be away for some weeks, and perhaps it may be well\r\n     for me to have some little money, in case I should have any\r\n     expenses.\" \"Rachel,\" said the astonished husband, \"where is that\r\n     ninepence I gave thee day before yesterday?\" That man had gained\r\n     all the money he had in the world through that wife. He obtained\r\n     her property by marriage; he invested that property in real\r\n     estate, and had grown richer and richer, until he grew rich\r\n     enough to spare a ninepence for Rachel the day before yesterday.\r\n     It is such marriages as that, that we wish to avert, by placing\r\n     woman in an honorable position, by substituting an equal union in\r\n     marriage; such a union as is shown in the lives of those who\r\n     stand behind me now.\r\n\r\n     The movement which these women urge is sweeping on with\r\n     resistless power. Within the last seven years, every legislature,\r\n     every school, every industrial avocation has been reached by it.\r\n     This is preliminary work. The final Malakoff, the right of\r\n     suffrage, is yet to be gained. Already it has been partially\r\n     conceded, in communities differing in all else, in Canada and in\r\n     Kentucky. We have only to press on. Strange to say, the reform is\r\n     reversing the ordinary weapons of the sexes, for the women have\r\n     all the logic, and the men only gossip and slander. But it finds\r\n     its answering echo in the very hostility it creates. It has a\r\n     million hearts. Silence every woman on this platform, and the\r\n     movement still goes on. Elevate woman at any point, and you lead\r\n     directly to this. The thousand schools of New York are educating\r\n     a Woman's Rights advocate in every house.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of Mr. Higginson's remarks, a frequent\r\ndisturbance was made by some of the occupants of the galleries, who\r\nwere evidently curious to hear the female speakers.\r\n\r\nThe President then introduced Ernestine L. Rose, who said she wished\r\nto say to all self-respecting men, that this is the last place in\r\nwhich they should create a disturbance, especially in a matter which\r\nconcerns their sisters, their wives, and their mothers.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ROSE: This morning a young man made some remarks in\r\n     opposition to our claims. We were glad to hear him, because he\r\n     gave evidence of an earnest, sincere spirit of inquiry, which is\r\n     always welcome in every true reform movement. And as we believe\r\n     our cause to be based on truth, we know it can bear the test of\r\n     reason, and, like gold doubly refined, will come out purer and\r\n     brighter from the fiery ordeal. The young man, who, I hope, is\r\n     present, based his principal argument against us, \"Because,\" said\r\n     he, \"you can bring no authority from revelation or from nature.\"\r\n     I will not enter into an inquiry as to what he meant by these\r\n     terms, but I will show him the revelation from which we derive\r\n     our authority, and the nature in which it is written in living\r\n     characters. It is true we do not go to revelations written in\r\n     books; but ours is older than all books, and whatever of good\r\n     there is in any written revelations, must necessarily agree with\r\n     ours, or it is not true, for ours only is the true revelation,\r\n     based in nature and in life. That revelation is no less than the\r\n     living, breathing, thinking, feeling, acting revelation\r\n     manifested in the nature of woman. In her manifold powers,\r\n     capacities, needs, hopes, and aspirations, lies her title-deed,\r\n     and whether that revelation was written by nature or nature's\r\n     God, matters not, for here it is. No one can disprove it. No one\r\n     can bring an older, broader, higher, and more sacred basis for\r\n     human rights. Do you tell me that the Bible is against our\r\n     rights? Then I say that our claims do not rest upon a book\r\n     written no one knows when, or by whom. Do you tell me what Paul\r\n     or Peter says on the subject? Then again I reply that our claims\r\n     do not rest on the opinions of any one, not even on those of Paul\r\n     and Peter, for they are older than they. Books and opinions, no\r\n     matter from whom they came, if they are in opposition to human\r\n     rights, are nothing but dead letters. I have shown you that we\r\n     derive our claims from humanity, from revelation, from nature,\r\n     and from your Declaration of Independence; all proclaim our right\r\n     to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; and having life,\r\n     which fact I presume you do not question, then we demand all the\r\n     rights and privileges society is capable of bestowing, to make\r\n     life useful, virtuous, honorable, and happy.\r\n\r\n     But I am told that woman needs not as extensive an education as\r\n     man, as her place is only the domestic sphere; _only_ the\r\n     domestic sphere! Oh, how utterly ignorant is society of the true\r\n     import of that term! Go to your legislative halls, and your\r\n     Congress; behold those you have sent there to govern you, and as\r\n     you find them high or low, great or small, noble or base, you can\r\n     trace it directly or indirectly to the domestic sphere.\r\n\r\n     The wisest in all ages have acknowledged that the most important\r\n     period in human education is in childhood--that period when the\r\n     plastic mind may be moulded into such exquisite beauty, that no\r\n     unfavorable influences shall be able entirely to destroy it--or\r\n     into such hideous deformity, that it shall cling to it like a\r\n     thick rust eaten into a highly polished surface, which no\r\n     after-scouring shall ever be able entirely to efface. This most\r\n     important part of education is left entirely in the hands of the\r\n     mother. She prepares the soil for future culture; she lays the\r\n     foundation upon which a superstructure shall be erected that\r\n     shall stand as firm as a rock, or shall pass away like the\r\n     baseless fabric of a vision, and leave not a wreck behind. But\r\n     the mother can not give what she does not possess; weakness can\r\n     not impart strength.\r\n\r\n     Sisters, you have a duty to perform--and duty, like charity,\r\n     begins at home. In the name of your poor, vicious, outcast,\r\n     down-trodden sister! in the name of her who once was as innocent\r\n     and as pure as you are! in the name of her who has been made the\r\n     victim of wrong, injustice, and oppression! in the name of man!\r\n     in the name of all, I ask you, I entreat you, if you have an hour\r\n     to spare, a dollar to give, or a word to utter--spare it, give\r\n     it, and utter it, for the elevation of woman! And when your\r\n     minister asks you for money for missionary purposes, tell him\r\n     there are higher, and holier, and nobler missions to be\r\n     performed at home. When he asks for colleges to educate\r\n     ministers, tell him you must educate woman, that she may do away\r\n     with the necessity of ministers, so that they may be able to go\r\n     to some useful employment. If he asks you to give to the churches\r\n     (which means to himself) then ask him what he has done for the\r\n     salvation of woman. When he speaks to you of leading a virtuous\r\n     life, ask him whether he understands the causes that have\r\n     prevented so many of your sisters from being virtuous, and have\r\n     driven them to degradation, sin, and wretchedness. When he speaks\r\n     to you of a hereafter, tell him to help to educate woman, to\r\n     enable her to live a life of intelligence, independence, virtue,\r\n     and happiness here, as the best preparatory step for any other\r\n     life. And if he has not told you from the pulpit of all these\r\n     things; if he does not know them; it is high time you inform him,\r\n     and teach him his duty here in this life.\r\n\r\n     This subject is deep and vast enough for the wisest heads and\r\n     purest hearts of the race; it underlies our whole social system.\r\n     Look to your criminal records--look to your records of mortality,\r\n     to your cemeteries, peopled by mothers before the age of thirty\r\n     or forty, and children under the age of five; earnestly and\r\n     impartially investigate the cause, and you can trace it directly\r\n     or indirectly to woman's inefficient education; her helpless,\r\n     dependent position; her inexperience; her want of confidence in\r\n     her own noble nature, in her own principles and powers, and her\r\n     blind reliance in man. We ask, then, for woman, an education that\r\n     shall cultivate her powers, develop, elevate, and ennoble her\r\n     being, physically, mentally, and morally; to enable her to take\r\n     care of herself, and she will be taken care of; to protect\r\n     herself, and she will be protected. But to give woman as full and\r\n     extensive an education as man, we must give her the same motives.\r\n     No one gathers keys without a prospect of having doors to unlock.\r\n     Man does not acquire knowledge without the hope to make it useful\r\n     and productive; the highest motives only can call out the\r\n     greatest exertion. There is a vast field of action open to man,\r\n     and therefore, he is prepared to enter it; widen the sphere of\r\n     action for woman, throw open to her all the avenues of industry,\r\n     emolument, usefulness, moral ambition, and true greatness, and\r\n     you will give her the same noble motives, the same incentives for\r\n     exertion, application, and perseverance that man possesses--and\r\n     this can be done only by giving her her legal and political\r\n     rights--pronounce her the equal of man in all the rights and\r\n     advantages society can bestow, and she will be prepared to\r\n     receive and use them, and not before. It would be folly to\r\n     cultivate her intellect like that of man without giving her the\r\n     same chances to use it--to give her an industrial avocation\r\n     without giving her the right to the proceeds of her industry, or\r\n     to give her the right to the proceeds of her industry without\r\n     giving her the power to protect the property she may acquire; she\r\n     must therefore have the legal and political rights, or she has\r\n     nothing. The ballot-box is the focus of all other rights, it is\r\n     the pivot upon which all others hang; the legal rights are\r\n     embraced in it, for if once possessed of the right to the\r\n     ballot-box, to self-representation, she will see to it that the\r\n     laws shall be just, and protect her person and her property, as\r\n     well as that of man. Until she has political rights she is not\r\n     secure in any she may possess. One legislature may alter some\r\n     oppressive law, and give her some right, and the next legislature\r\n     may take it away, for as yet it is only given as an act of\r\n     generosity, as a charity on the part of man, and not as her\r\n     right, and therefore it can not be lasting, nor productive of\r\n     good.\r\n\r\n     Mothers, women of America! when you hear the subject of Woman's\r\n     Rights broached, laugh at it and us, ridicule it as much as you\r\n     please; but never forget, that by the laws of your country, you\r\n     have no right to your children--the law gives the father as\r\n     uncontrolled power over the child as it gives the husband over\r\n     the wife; only the child, when it comes to maturity, the father's\r\n     control ceases, while the wife never comes to maturity. The\r\n     father may bequeath, bestow, or sell the child without the\r\n     consent of the mother. But methinks I hear you say that no man\r\n     deserving the name of man, or the title of husband and father,\r\n     could commit such an outrage against the dearest principles of\r\n     humanity; well, if there are no such men, then the law ought to\r\n     be annulled, a law against which nature, justice, and humanity\r\n     revolt, ought to be wiped off from the statute book as a\r\n     disgrace; and if there are such--which unhappily we all know\r\n     there are--then there is still greater reason why the laws ought\r\n     to be changed, for bad laws encourage bad men and make them\r\n     worse; good men can not be benefited by the existence of bad\r\n     laws; bad men ought not to be; laws are not made for him who is a\r\n     law unto himself, but for the lawless. The legitimate object of\r\n     law is to protect the innocent and inexperienced against the\r\n     designing and the guilty; we therefore ask every one present to\r\n     demand of the Legislatures of every State to alter these unjust\r\n     laws; give the wife an equal right with the husband in the\r\n     property acquired after marriage; give the mother an equal right\r\n     with the father in the control of the children; let the wife at\r\n     the death of the husband remain his heir to the same extent that\r\n     he would be hers, at her death; let the laws be alike for both,\r\n     and they are sure to be right; but to have them so, woman must\r\n     help to make them.\r\n\r\n     We hear a great deal about the heroism of the battle-field. What\r\n     is it? Compare it with the heroism of the woman who stands up for\r\n     the right, and it sinks into utter insignificance. To stand\r\n     before the cannon's mouth, with death before him and disgrace\r\n     behind, excited to frenzy by physical fear, encouraged by his\r\n     leader, stimulated by the sound of the trumpet, and sustained by\r\n     the _still emptier sound of glory_, requires no great heroism;\r\n     the merest coward could be a hero in such a position; but to face\r\n     the fire of an unjust and prejudiced public opinion, to attack\r\n     the adamantine walls of long-usurped power, to brave not only the\r\n     enemy abroad, but often that severest of all enemies, your own\r\n     friends at home, requires a heroism that the world has never yet\r\n     recognized, that the battle-field can not supply, but which woman\r\n     possesses.\r\n\r\n     When the Allied Powers endeavored to take Sebastopol they found\r\n     that every incision and inroad they made in the fortress during\r\n     the day was filled up by the enemy during the night; and even\r\n     now, after the terrible sacrifice of life to break it down, they\r\n     are not safe, but the enemy may build it up again. But in a moral\r\n     warfare, no matter how thick and impenetrable the fortress of\r\n     prejudice may be, if you once make an inroad in it, that space\r\n     can never be filled up again; every stone you remove is removed\r\n     for aye and for good; and the very effort to replace it tends\r\n     only to loosen every other stone, until the whole foundation is\r\n     undermined, and the superstructure crumbles at our feet.\r\n\r\n     The PRESIDENT: Before this Convention closes, I want to say a\r\n     word to the women who hear me. This work lies chiefly in our\r\n     hands. We have undertaken no child's play. It is nothing less\r\n     than a change in customs hoary with age--in laws which have\r\n     existed through long years--in mistaken religious interpretations\r\n     and views of duty, which have received the sanction and\r\n     veneration of antiquity. It is to place woman where she may make\r\n     herself fit for life's duties, in whatever department she may\r\n     find herself, whether as woman, daughter, wife, or mother. Every\r\n     influence around us to-day tends to the reverse. The young girl\r\n     stands beside her brother in the world's wide arena, and looks\r\n     out to see what it shall assign her. To him, everything that\r\n     power can win is open, while the world cheers him, by so much as\r\n     he grasps and conquers. To her is presented, what kind of a life?\r\n     There is not a man in the world, who, if such a life were offered\r\n     him, would not sooner lie down peacefully in his grave, than in a\r\n     paltry cage fret away a life that ought to have been broad and\r\n     grand, as God who gave it intended it should be.\r\n\r\n     Horace Greeley says he thinks the intellect of woman is not equal\r\n     to that of man. Horace Greeley was a poor boy, and had to make\r\n     his way up in the world. He has reached a position that is\r\n     attained by few. When he speaks the nation listens. Suppose that\r\n     he had been told by his mother, as she placed her hand upon his\r\n     little head, with all the tenderness that gushes from a mother's\r\n     heart, \"My son, here is your brother; he shall grow up in the\r\n     world of society, and no school or college shall be closed\r\n     against him; the great school of life shall be free to him; he\r\n     shall have a voice in making the laws he is to obey; he shall pay\r\n     taxes, and he shall direct the use of the tax; but for you, alas!\r\n     none of these places will be open; you must therefore rest\r\n     satisfied with helping your brother. He will win power and\r\n     wealth, but none of it shall be your own; if you seek to enter\r\n     into the same position that he is in, the world will scorn and\r\n     deride you.\" And if when he came into life he had found all that\r\n     his mother told him was true, what think you would have been the\r\n     success of Horace Greeley, with all this mountain-weight upon\r\n     him? Would he have taken the place he has now? I am glad he was\r\n     not hindered; I am only sorry that woman is. It is too early for\r\n     him or us to say what the intellect of woman is, till she has had\r\n     the freedom to try its powers. I am reminded of what Frederick\r\n     Douglass said of the negroes: \"You shut us out of the schools and\r\n     colleges, you put your foot on us, and then say, Why don't you\r\n     know something?\" That is just what is said to us.\r\n\r\n     Let us teach men who talk of the wrongs perpetrated in Kansas,\r\n     that they are doing the very same thing to us here. One need not\r\n     go to Kansas to find border ruffians, or bogus legislation, for\r\n     they can all be found here; and when the future historian shall\r\n     record that in Kansas, Missourians deprived free State men of the\r\n     franchise, and that New York men deprived the women of the same,\r\n     it will be said that the border ruffians of Missouri and the\r\n     border ruffians of New York were very much alike--one came with\r\n     the gloved hand, and smiled and bowed, saying, I can't let you\r\n     vote; while the other said, If you do I will blow out your\r\n     brains. The result is the same.\r\n\r\n     I look in the faces of men and marvel that they can meet us in\r\n     the way they do, when they have made such laws against us.\r\n     Clear-headed and far-sighted, they do not appear to realize that\r\n     the outrages they condemn in Kansas, they are themselves all the\r\n     while inflicting upon us. John Randolph, when the women of\r\n     Virginia were making garments for the Greeks, pointed to long\r\n     gangs of slaves, and said, \"Ladies, the Greeks are at your\r\n     doors.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the annual canvass of the State, lectures from the most\r\npopular orators were secured in the large cities. In the winter of\r\n1856, by invitation of Miss Anthony, Theodore Parker, William Lloyd\r\nGarrison, Wendell Phillips, Ralph Waldo Emerson, lectured in\r\nCorinthian Hall, Rochester, to good audiences. In the spring of 1858,\r\nMiss Emily Howland managed a course of lectures in Mozart Hall, New\r\nYork, in aid of \"The Shirt-sewers' and Seamstresses' Union,\" viz:\r\nGeorge Wm. Curtis, \"Fair Play for Women\"; Lucy Stone, \"Woman and the\r\nElective Franchise\"; Hon. Eli Thayer, \"Benefit to Women of Organized\r\nEmigration\"; and Rev. E. H. Chapin, \"Woman and her Work.\" In the\r\nautumn of the same year, through the enterprise of Elizabeth M.\r\nPowell, Henry Ward Beecher, James T. Brady, Solon Robinson, and others\r\naddressed a large audience in Dr. Chapin's church, Mayor Tieman\r\npresiding, to aid in the establishment of a \"Free Library for Working\r\nWomen.\"\r\n\r\nIn January, 1859, Antoinette L. Brown gave a series of Sunday sermons\r\nin Rochester, and in 1860 she preached in Hope Chapel, New York, for\r\nsix months. In Rochester during the winter of 1859, Miss Anthony had a\r\nseries of lectures by George William Curtis, Wendell Phillips,\r\nAntoinette Brown, Ernestine L. Rose, and others. The following letter\r\nwill show that Thomas Starr King was in full sympathy with our\r\nmovement:\r\n\r\n                                              BOSTON, _Sep. 20, 1858_.\r\n\r\n     SUSAN B. ANTHONY.\r\n\r\n     DEAR MADAM:--It would afford me great satisfaction to be able to\r\n     serve you as you request. I am compelled to say, however, that it\r\n     is entirely out of my power. I have already engaged for so much\r\n     work beyond my regular duties, that I shall have no leisure even\r\n     to prepare a new Lyceum address. Not having any lecture upon the\r\n     position of woman that is full enough, and adequate in any way to\r\n     the present state of the discussion, I must reluctantly decline\r\n     the opportunity you offer.\r\n\r\n                         With sincere thanks, I remain truly yours,\r\n                                                       T. S. KING.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1858, Francis Jackson, of Boston, placed $5,000 in\r\nthe hands of Wendell Phillips for woman's enfranchisement, as will be\r\nseen by the following letter:\r\n\r\n                                               BOSTON, _Nov. 6, 1858_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR FRIENDS:--I have had given me five thousand dollars, to be\r\n     used for the Woman's Rights cause; to procure tracts on that\r\n     subject, publish and circulate them, pay for lectures, and secure\r\n     such other agitation of the question as we deem fit and best to\r\n     obtain equal civil and social position for woman.\r\n\r\n     The name of the giver of this generous fund I am not allowed to\r\n     tell you; the only condition of the gift is, that the fund is to\r\n     remain invested in my keeping. In other respects, we three are a\r\n     Committee of Trustees to spend it wisely and efficiently.\r\n\r\n     Let me ask you to write me what plan strikes you as best to begin\r\n     with. I think some agitation specially directed to the\r\n     Legislature very important. It is wished that we should begin our\r\n     efforts at once.\r\n\r\n                              Yours truly,\r\n                                                 WENDELL PHILLIPS,\r\n\r\n     Miss SUSAN B. ANTHONY.\r\n     Mrs. LUCY STONE.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1859 that Charles F. Hovey of Boston left by\r\nwill,[153] a sum of $50,000 to be expended annually in the promotion\r\nof various reforms. Woman's Rights among them.\r\n\r\nMOZART HALL,\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, MAY 13, 14, 1858.\r\n\r\nThe year 1857 seems to have passed without a National Convention,\r\nalthough the work was still vigorously prosecuted in the State of New\r\nYork, but in the spring of 1858, the ninth National Convention was\r\ncalled in New York during the week of the anniversaries when crowds\r\nwere always attracted to attend the various religious and reformatory\r\nmeetings. Henceforward, for many years, a Woman's Rights Convention\r\nwas a marked feature of this period in the month of May. There were\r\nseveral persons at this Convention who had not before honored our\r\nplatform.[154] These, with the usual familiar speakers,[155] filled\r\nthe platform with quite a striking group of ladies and gentlemen. The\r\nmorning session was occupied with the usual preliminary business\r\nmatters, choosing officers, presenting resolutions, and planning new\r\naggressive steps for the coming year. Susan B. Anthony was President\r\non this occasion, and fulfilled her duties to the general\r\nsatisfaction. During the evening session the hall was crowded, all the\r\navailable space for either sitting or standing was occupied, the\r\nplatform and steps were densely packed, and this at twenty-five cents\r\nadmission.\r\n\r\nMr. Phillips, Mrs. Mott, Mrs. Rose, Mr. Garrison, Mr. Higginson, Miss\r\nBrown, and Lucy Stone all spoke with their usual effect. Mrs. Eliza\r\nWoodson Farnham, the author of \"Woman and her Era,\" spoke at length on\r\nthe \"Superiority of Woman.\"\r\n\r\n     She presented a series of resolutions, recognizing the right of\r\n     man in the primary era in his physical and cerebral structure, to\r\n     be the conqueror, the mechanic, the inventor, the clearer of\r\n     forests, the pioneer of civilization, but she looked to the\r\n     dawning of a higher era, when woman should assume her true\r\n     position in harmony with her superior organism, her delicacy of\r\n     structure, her beauty of person, her great powers of endurance,\r\n     and thus prove herself not only man's equal in influence and\r\n     power, but his superior in many of the noblest virtues. In\r\n     woman's creative power during maternity, she recognized her as\r\n     second only to God himself. Woman should recognize man as a John\r\n     the Baptist, going before to prepare the world for her coming, he\r\n     recognizing her greater divinity as equal in the Godhead, as\r\n     heavenly mother as well as father.\r\n\r\nMrs. Farnham[156] enforced her theory of woman's superiority in a long\r\nspeech, which was received with apparent satisfaction by the audience,\r\nthough several on the platform dissented from the claim of\r\nsuperiority, thinking it would be a sufficient triumph over the\r\ntyrannies of the past, if popular thought could be educated to the\r\nidea of the equality of the sexes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sarah Hallock read an extract from the Statutes of New York,\r\ngiving the items set aside by law for use of the wife and minor\r\nchildren, in case the husband died without a will.\r\n\r\n                 (Extract from the Statutes of New York).\r\n\r\n      ARTICLES INVENTORIED, BUT NOT APPROVED, BELONGING TO THE WIDOW\r\n                             AND MINOR CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n     1st. All spinning-wheels, weaving-looms, or stoves put up for\r\n     use.\r\n\r\n     2d. The family Bible, family pictures, school-books, and books\r\n     not exceeding in value fifty dollars.\r\n\r\n     [Mrs. Hallock here interjected, husbands had better give their\r\n     wives cheap books].\r\n\r\n     3d. Ten sheep and their fleeces, and the yarn and cloth\r\n     manufactured from the same; one cow, two swine, and the pork of\r\n     such swine. [Laughter],\r\n\r\n     4th. All necessary wearing apparel, beds, bedsteads, and bedding;\r\n     the clothing of the widow and her ornaments proper to her station\r\n     (as to ornaments, tastes differ as to those proper to her\r\n     station), one table, six chairs (suppose there were seven or ten\r\n     children, what then? queried Mrs. Hallock [Laughter],) six knives\r\n     and forks, six tea-cups and saucers, one sugar-dish, one\r\n     milk-pot, one tea-pot, and six spoons. \"So great a favorite is\r\n     the female sex of the laws of England and America,\" says\r\n     Blackstone.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ROSE protested against _one_ tea-pot; the law didn't mention\r\n     tea-pot at all. [Great laughter].\r\n\r\n     Mrs. HALLOCK: Oh, yes! but not a coffee-pot. [Renewed laughter].\r\n\r\n     Mrs. GAGE: In Ohio they give twelve spoons. [Convulsive\r\n     laughter].\r\n\r\n     Mrs. HALLOCK: We'll get up a delegation to Ohio, then.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. FARNHAM: I would say that I will give up all these things if\r\n     the State will only give us in return one of our children.\r\n     [Applause and laughter].\r\n\r\n     Mrs. HALLOCK: Isn't it a pity that our laws--are they ours?\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ROSE: No.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. HALLOCK: Well, then, your laws. It is a pity that those\r\n     statutes should not be revised so as to give a widow a carpet and\r\n     other smaller articles of luxury. [Great laughter].\r\n\r\nAnd such was the boasted \"protection\" secured to the wives and mothers\r\nby the laws of the most civilized nations on the globe, and such the\r\nlaw-makers in whose hands woman's interests were supposed to be\r\nsecure, when we began our battle for equality. Class laws, class\r\nlegislation, legalized robbery from the unborn child, down to the\r\ncommonest necessaries of life, has been the \"protection\" woman has\r\ncomplained of from fathers, husbands, brothers, and sons. Those just\r\nawaking to an interest in this reform, see but the smoke of the former\r\nbattles; they can not appreciate all the tyranny from which this\r\nagitation has freed them. Step by step, custom by custom, law by law,\r\na partial victory has been wrested, and a public opinion slowly\r\ncreated that promises other victories in the near future.\r\n\r\nThose who have not been through the conflict will never realize how\r\ndark the prospect was in starting. Denied education, and a place in\r\nthe world of work, denied the rights of property, whether of her own\r\nearnings, or her inheritance, with the press and the pulpit, custom,\r\nand public opinion sustaining the law, was there ever a struggle\r\nentered upon, which at its beginning seemed more hopeless than this\r\nfor woman? But these constant presentations of the laws, with the\r\ncomments and arguments in our Conventions, gradually appealed to the\r\nunderstanding of sensible men and women, and opened the eyes of the\r\ncommunity to the wrongs of woman, perpetrated under the specious name\r\nof justice.\r\n\r\nAll the sessions of this Convention were interrupted by the rowdyism\r\nof a number of men occupying the rear part of the hall.\r\n\r\n     PARKER PILLSBURY said he had attended three of these Conventions,\r\n     but had not spoken in one before. He thought the ladies\r\n     encroached a little on the men's rights, as in the first and\r\n     second, the Methodists gave the ladies the use of their church in\r\n     a city of the West, on condition that Parker Pillsbury should not\r\n     be allowed to speak. [Applause and laughter]. Now that the door\r\n     was open, and he had ventured in, he did not know what to say.\r\n     [Laughter and cries of \"Go on\"]. He would recommend the women to\r\n     hold their next Convention at the ballot-box, as that would do\r\n     more good than a hundred such as these. If their votes were\r\n     refused, let them look the tax collectors in the face and defy\r\n     them to come for taxes, as long as they were not allowed a voice\r\n     in the Government. And carry the war into the Church, too, demand\r\n     equality there as well as in the State.\r\n\r\n     He knew an orthodox church, consisting of twelve members. One was\r\n     a man and a deacon, the remainder were women. A vote had to be\r\n     taken for changing the day for the prayer-meeting, but some\r\n     difficulty arose between the minister and the deacon, and the\r\n     only way it could be settled was by the votes of the women. So\r\n     the deacon went round on tip-toe, and put his head under each\r\n     bonnet, and held a little private caucus meeting with one after\r\n     another, and then returned to the altar and reported to the\r\n     minister that the vote was unanimous. If women had any proper\r\n     self-respect, they would scorn to remain one hour in any church\r\n     in which they were not considered and recognized as equals.\r\n\r\n     OLIVER JOHNSON said there was a new church formed called\r\n     \"Progressive Friends,\" in which men and women stood on perfect\r\n     equality. He said there was another church (Henry Ward Beecher's)\r\n     in Brooklyn, where women were expected to vote on all questions\r\n     connected with the business affairs of the congregation. Another\r\n     church in this city (Rev. Dr. Cheever's) had a difficulty in\r\n     which the capitalists tried to dismiss the pastor, because he\r\n     maintained the right of the slave to freedom, and of the woman to\r\n     the elective franchise. He agreed with Mr. Pillsbury that it was\r\n     woman's duty to test her equality in the Church as well as the\r\n     State.\r\n\r\n     AARON M. POWELL took the same ground. As women made the large\r\n     majority in the churches, they could easily secure equal rights\r\n     there if united in an effort to do so. Why, said he, are there no\r\n     young women sitting at the reporters' desks, taking note of the\r\n     proceedings of this Convention? He advocated the elective\r\n     franchise, saying that no class could be protected in all its\r\n     rights without a voice in the laws.\r\n\r\n     A Mr. WARREN said he had no objection to woman's claiming\r\n     equality, but when they declared their superiority, they injured\r\n     themselves and the rising generation in teaching the young to\r\n     disrespect the men of the household. (Great laughter and hisses).\r\n     Woman might be the savior of man, but was not God, and had no\r\n     place in the Godhead. (Laughter and cheers). He spoke from\r\n     experience when he said men had already suffered much from the\r\n     tyrannical usurpations of women. Let woman be the true helpmate\r\n     of man, religiously, politically, morally, socially; but, oh!\r\n     said he, in a sorrowful tone, it will be a sad day for the race\r\n     when woman takes command, and man is pushed aside. (Convulsive\r\n     laughter, and cries of \"Give us your experience.\")\r\n\r\n     Mrs. FARNHAM was glad the subject of woman's superiority had been\r\n     broached, and only regretted that as a scientific fact it could\r\n     not be more seriously discussed.\r\n\r\n     A gentleman deprecated the fact that Mr. Warren had not been more\r\n     fully heard.\r\n\r\n     THE PRESIDENT said it was the audience and not the platform that\r\n     laughed. Loud calls were made for\r\n\r\n     DOUGLASS, to which he responded, claiming woman's right to\r\n     freedom and equality on the same grounds he based his own.\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON maintained woman's right to sit in\r\n     Congress and the legislatures--that there should be the same\r\n     number of women as men in all the national councils. He said\r\n     respect for his sainted mother, love for his noble wife, and for\r\n     the only daughter of his house and heart (my own Fanny), compel\r\n     me to defend the rights of all women. Those who have inaugurated\r\n     this movement are worthy to be ranked with the army of martyrs\r\n     and confessors in the days of old. Blessings on them! They should\r\n     triumph, and every opposition be removed, that peace and love,\r\n     justice and liberty, might prevail throughout the world.\r\n\r\n     A Mr. TYLER remarked that a fear had been expressed that in\r\n     coming to the polls, woman would be compelled to meet men who\r\n     drink and smoke. Do women encounter no such evils in their homes?\r\n     Whisky and tobacco are much greater obstacles at the marriage\r\n     altar than at the polls--in the relation of wife than in that of\r\n     citizen.\r\n\r\nGEORGE WILLIAM CURTIS, then in the height of his reputation (as\r\nHowadji), spoke at length in favor of suffrage for woman, but amid\r\nconstant interruptions. With a short speech from Mrs. Rose, the\r\nConvention adjourned amid great confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nNINTH NATIONAL CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with a call issued by the Central Committee, the Ninth\r\nNational Woman's Rights Convention was held in the City of New York on\r\nThursday, May 12, 1859.\r\n\r\nThe sessions commenced with a business meeting, on the afternoon of\r\nthat day, in Mozart Hall. The meeting was called to order by SUSAN B.\r\nANTHONY, of Rochester, New York, who made a few introductory remarks,\r\nafter which, the question of the expediency of memorializing the\r\nLegislatures of the different States, on the subject of granting equal\r\nrights to Woman, was discussed at some length. At the close of the\r\ndebate, a resolution was adopted, that it was expedient so to\r\nmemorialize the several Legislatures, and a committee[157] was\r\nappointed for that purpose, and a series of resolutions[158] offered\r\nby Caroline H. Dall.\r\n\r\nThese resolutions were discussed by Mrs. Dall, Mrs. Hallock, Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Neal Gay, Lucretia Mott, A. M. Powell, Charles C. Burleigh,\r\nand others.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVENING SESSION.\r\n\r\nAt an early hour, Mozart Hall was crowded to overflowing, every seat\r\nbeing occupied, and crowds standing in the aisle, and the rear of the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nLUCRETIA MOTT had been chosen to preside, but was not able, on account\r\nof the crowd, to reach the platform at the hour appointed. The\r\nConvention was therefore called to order by Susan B. Anthony.\r\n\r\nMrs. CAROLINE H. DALL, of Boston, was the first speaker. She desired\r\nto commemorate the century which had just closed since the death of\r\nMary Woolstonecraft, and to show that what she did in the old world,\r\nMargaret Fuller had done in the new; but the noise and restlessness\r\namong the audience were so great (much of which, we charitably hope,\r\nwas attributable rather to the discomfort of their position than to\r\nany want of respect for the speaker, or for the cause which the\r\nConvention represented), that she yielded to the wish of the presiding\r\nofficer, and sat down without speaking of Margaret Fuller.\r\n\r\nShort speeches were made by Lucretia Mott, Antoinette Brown Blackwell,\r\nand Ernestine L. Rose; but as it proved to be another turbulent\r\nmeeting, Wendell Phillips, who understood from long experience how to\r\nplay with and lash a mob, and thrust what he wished to say into their\r\nlong ears, all with one consent yielded the platform to him, and for\r\nnearly two hours he held that mocking crowd in the hollow of his hand.\r\nIn closing he said:\r\n\r\n     I will not attempt to detain you longer. [\"Go on\"--\"Go on.\"] I\r\n     have neither the disposition nor the strength to trespass any\r\n     longer upon your attention. The subject is so large that it might\r\n     well fill days, instead of hours. It covers the whole surface of\r\n     American society. It touches religion, purity, political economy,\r\n     wages, the safety of cities, the growth of ideas, the very\r\n     success of our experiment. I gave to-night a character to the\r\n     city of Washington which some men hissed. You know it is true. If\r\n     this experiment of self-government is to succeed, it is to\r\n     succeed by some saving element introduced into the politics of\r\n     the present day. You know this: Your Websters, your Clays, your\r\n     Calhouns, your Douglases, however intellectually able they may\r\n     have been, have never dared or cared to touch that moral element\r\n     of our national life. Either the shallow and heartless trade of\r\n     politics had eaten out their own moral being, or they feared to\r\n     enter the unknown land of lofty right and wrong.\r\n\r\n     Neither of these great names has linked its fame with one great\r\n     moral question of the day. They deal with money questions, with\r\n     tariffs, with parties, with State law, and if by chance they\r\n     touch the slave question, it is only like Jewish hucksters\r\n     trading in the relics of Saints. The reformers--the fanatics, as\r\n     we are called--are the only ones who have launched social and\r\n     moral questions. I risk nothing when I say, that the anti-slavery\r\n     discussion of the last twenty years has been the salt of this\r\n     nation; it has actually kept it alive and wholesome. Without it,\r\n     our politics would have sunk beyond even contempt. So with this\r\n     question. It stirs the deepest sympathy; it appeals to the\r\n     highest moral sense; it enwraps within itself the greatest moral\r\n     issues. Judge it, then, candidly, carefully, as Americans, and\r\n     let us show ourselves worthy of the high place to which God has\r\n     called us in human affairs. (Applause).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 MEMORIAL.\r\n\r\n     To the Honorable the Legislature of the State of ----\r\n\r\n     The National Woman's Rights Convention, held in New York City,\r\n     May 12, 1859, appointed your memorialists a Committee to call\r\n     your attention to the anomalous position of one-half the people\r\n     of this Republic.\r\n\r\n     All republican constitutions set forth the great truth that every\r\n     human being is endowed with certain inalienable rights--such as\r\n     life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--and as a\r\n     consequence, a right to the use of all those means necessary to\r\n     secure these grand results.\r\n\r\n     1st.--A citizen can not be said to have a right to life, who may\r\n     be deprived of it for the violation of laws to which she has\r\n     never consented--who is denied the right of trial by a jury of\r\n     her peers--who has no voice in the election of judges who are to\r\n     decide her fate.\r\n\r\n     2d.--A citizen can not be said to have a right to liberty, when\r\n     the custody of her person belongs to another; when she has no\r\n     civil or political rights--no right even to the wages she earns;\r\n     when she can make no contracts--neither buy nor sell, sue or be\r\n     sued--and yet can be taxed without representation.\r\n\r\n     3d.--A citizen can not be said to have a right to happiness, when\r\n     denied the right to person, property, children, and home; when\r\n     the code of laws under which she is compelled to live is far more\r\n     unjust and tyrannical than that which our fathers repudiated at\r\n     the mouth of the cannon nearly one century ago.\r\n\r\n     Now, we would ask on what principle of republicanism, justice, or\r\n     common humanity, a minority of the people of this Republic have\r\n     monopolized to themselves all the rights of the whole? Where,\r\n     under our Declaration of Independence, does the white Saxon man\r\n     get his power to deprive all women and negroes of their\r\n     inalienable rights?\r\n\r\n     The mothers of the Revolution bravely shared all dangers,\r\n     persecutions, and death; and their daughters now claim an equal\r\n     share in all the glories and triumphs of your success. Shall they\r\n     stand before a body of American legislators and ask in vain for\r\n     their right of suffrage--their right of property--their right to\r\n     the wages they earn--their right to their children and their\r\n     homes--their sacred right to personal liberty--to a trial by a\r\n     jury of their peers?\r\n\r\n     In view of these high considerations, we demand, then, that you\r\n     shall, by your future legislation, secure to women all those\r\n     rights and privileges and immunities which in equity belong to\r\n     every citizen of a republic.\r\n\r\n     And we demand that whenever you shall remodel the Constitution of\r\n     the State in which you live, the word \"male\" shall be expurgated,\r\n     and that henceforth you shall legislate for all citizens. There\r\n     can be no privileged classes in a truly democratic government.\r\n\r\n               ELIZABETH CADY STANTON,     MARTHA C. WEIGHT,\r\n               WENDELL PHILLIPS,           CAROLINE M. SEVERANCE,\r\n               CAROLINE H. DALL,           THOMAS W. HIGGINSON,\r\n               ERNESTINE L. ROSE,          SUSAN B. ANTHONY,\r\n                       ANTOINETTE BROWN BLACKWELL,        _Committee_.\r\n\r\nThe above memorial was extensively circulated and sent to the\r\nLegislature of every State in the nation, but, owing to the John Brown\r\nraid and the general unrest and forebodings of the people on the eve\r\nof our civil war, it commanded but little attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n     FORM OF APPEAL AND PETITION CIRCULATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK\r\n                   DURING THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN OF 1859.\r\n\r\n     _To the Women of the Empire State:_\r\n\r\n     It is the desire and purpose of those interested in the Woman's\r\n     Rights movement, to send up to our next Legislature an\r\n     overwhelming petition, for the civil and political rights of\r\n     woman. These rights must be secured just as soon as the majority\r\n     of the women of the State make the demand. To this end, we have\r\n     decided thoroughly to canvass our State before the close of the\r\n     present year. We shall hold conventions in every county,\r\n     distribute tracts and circulate petitions, in order, if possible,\r\n     to arouse a proper self-respect in woman.\r\n\r\n     The want of funds has heretofore crippled all our efforts, but as\r\n     large bequests have been made to our cause during the past year,\r\n     we are now able to send out agents and to commence anew our work,\r\n     which shall never end, until, in Church and State, and at the\r\n     fireside, the equality of woman shall be fully recognized.\r\n\r\n     We hope much from our Republican legislators. Their well-known\r\n     professions encourage us to believe that our task is by no means\r\n     a hard one. We shall look for their hearty co-operation in every\r\n     effort for the elevation of humanity. We have had bills before\r\n     the Legislature for several years, on some of which, from time to\r\n     time, have had most favorable reports. The property bill of '48\r\n     was passed by a large majority. The various bills of rights, to\r\n     wages, children, suffrage, etc., have been respectfully\r\n     considered. The bill presented at the last session, giving to\r\n     married women their rights to make contracts, and to their wages,\r\n     passed the House with only three dissenting votes, but owing to\r\n     the pressure of business at the close of the session, it was\r\n     never brought before the Senate.\r\n\r\n     Whilst man, by his legislation and generous donations, declares\r\n     our cause righteous and just--whilst the very best men of the\r\n     nation, those who stand first in Church and State, in literature,\r\n     commerce, and the arts, are speaking for us such noble words and\r\n     performing such God-like deeds--shall woman, herself, be\r\n     indifferent to her own wrongs, insensible to all the\r\n     responsibilities of her high and holy calling? No! No!! I Let the\r\n     women of the Empire State now speak out in deep and earnest tones\r\n     that can not be misunderstood, demanding all those rights which\r\n     are at the very foundation of Republicanism--a full and equal\r\n     representation with man in the administration of our State and\r\n     National Government.\r\n\r\n     Do you know, women of New York! that under our present laws\r\n     married women have no right to the wages they earn? Think of the\r\n     40,000 drunkards' wives in this State--of the wives of men who\r\n     are licentious--of gamblers--of the long line of those who do\r\n     nothing; and is it no light matter that all these women who\r\n     support themselves, their husbands and families, too, shall have\r\n     no right to the disposition of their own earnings? Roll up, then,\r\n     your petitions[159] on this point, if no other, and secure to\r\n     laboring women their wages at the coming session!\r\n\r\n     Now is the golden time to work! Before another Constitutional\r\n     Convention be called, see to it that the public sentiment of this\r\n     State shall demand suffrage for woman! Remember, \"they who would\r\n     be free, themselves must strike the blow!\"\r\n\r\n                                         E. CADY STANTON,\r\n                                   _Chairman Central Committee._\r\n\r\nOf the canvass of 1859 and '60, we find the following letter in _The\r\nNew York Tribune_, February, 1860.\r\n\r\n     _To the Editor of The Tribune:_\r\n\r\n     SIR:--The readers of _The Tribune_ who have perused its columns\r\n     closely for the last six months will have noticed repeated\r\n     announcements of County Conventions in different parts of the\r\n     State to be addressed by certain ladies engaged in advocating\r\n     equal rights for woman. It may not be uninteresting to them to\r\n     know that every one of those appointments was filled by said\r\n     ladies. Over fifty counties of the State have been thus visited,\r\n     and petitions presented to the people for their signatures,\r\n     praying for equal property rights, and for steps to be taken to\r\n     so amend the Constitution as to secure to woman the right of\r\n     suffrage, which have been numerously signed and duly presented to\r\n     the Legislature. In the rural districts the success has been\r\n     wonderful, considering the unpopularity of the subject; our most\r\n     violent opposers being demagogical Democrats who frankly\r\n     acknowledge that if our doctrines prevail, anti-slavery,\r\n     temperance, moral reform, and Republicanism will conquer.\r\n\r\n     Large bequests have been made in the East for the furtherance of\r\n     this movement, and under the direction of a committee appointed\r\n     for that purpose, these ladies have gone forth to proclaim the\r\n     doctrine of civil and political equality for woman. No laggards\r\n     are they in their work. In the language of Mr. Greeley, they have\r\n     found a work to be done, and have gone at it with ready and\r\n     resolute will; they have not been able to answer all the calls\r\n     made upon their time and talent. One of them (I can speak but for\r\n     one) between the 11th of November and the 31st of January, has\r\n     given sixty-eight lectures, not missing one appointment, resting\r\n     only through the holidays and on Sundays. The others have\r\n     doubtless done as well. In most instances all have been able to\r\n     pay their own expenses, and in some cases their own salaries.\r\n\r\n     These ladies are not disappointed old maids, desolate widows, or\r\n     unhappy wives, though there is one widow and one who has passed\r\n     what is called the sunny side of twenty-five. Miss Susan B.\r\n     Anthony, the general agent, resides at Rochester, and is\r\n     unmarried. Mrs. Ernestine L. Rose, of New York City, is too\r\n     widely known to need comment. The same may be said of Antoinette\r\n     Brown Blackwell, the eloquent minister, accomplished scholar,\r\n     and amiable wife and mother. Mrs. J. Elizabeth Jones, of Ohio, is\r\n     a lady in the ripeness of womanhood, to whom, equally with the\r\n     above, all these adjectives apply. Mrs. Hannah Tracy Cutler, of\r\n     Illinois, has been twice married, and has superintended two\r\n     families of children satisfactorily; she has been teacher in a\r\n     high school in Columbus, Ohio, and matron of a deaf and dumb\r\n     asylum, has taken premiums on sorghum sugar made by her own\r\n     hands, and is also a physician among the poor of her\r\n     neighborhood. Mrs. Lucy N. Colman, of New York, is a widow, and\r\n     has fought life's battle bravely and well for herself and\r\n     children. Mrs. Frances D. Gage, of Missouri, formerly of Ohio,\r\n     might claim the nomination for President under the authority of\r\n     Henry Ward Beecher, \"having brought up six unruly boys,\" whose\r\n     aggregate height would form a column of thirty-six feet in honor\r\n     of their mother, who will all vote the Republican ticket in 1860\r\n     but one, and he is not old enough; and no one of them smokes or\r\n     chews, or stimulates the inner man with intoxicating beverages.\r\n     She is also the mother of two daughters.\r\n\r\n     Two years ago Mr. Greeley said to one of the ladies, \"Why don't\r\n     you ladies go to work?\" They have gone to work; and with the help\r\n     of such men as Garrison, Phillips, Parker, Giddings, Curtis,\r\n     Beecher, Chapin, Brady, and a host of others whom the world\r\n     delights to honor, their cause will surely triumph. It is a\r\n     question of time only; not of fact. God speed the day.\r\n\r\nThe State Convention of 1860 was held in Association Hall, Albany,\r\nFebruary 3d and 4th, with fine audiences throughout, and the usual\r\nforce of speakers. As the outpourings of Miss Anthony's love element\r\nall flowed into the suffrage movement, she was sorely tried with the\r\nimperative cares that the domestic experiments of most of her\r\ncoadjutors so constantly involved. Her urgent missives coming ever and\r\nanon to arouse us to higher duties, are quite inspiring even at this\r\ndate. In a letter to Martha C. Wright, she says:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Bingham, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, will bring\r\n     in a radical report in favor of all our claims, but previous to\r\n     his doing so he wishes our strongest arguments made before the\r\n     Committee, and he says Mrs. Stanton must come. I write her this\r\n     mail, but I wish you would step over there and make her feel that\r\n     the salvation of the Empire State, at least the women in it,\r\n     depends upon her bending all her powers to moving the hearts of\r\n     our law-makers at this time. Mr. Bingham says our Convention here\r\n     has wrought wondrous changes with a large number of the members\r\n     who attended, and so says Mr. Mayo, of the Albanians; indeed our\r\n     claims are so patent they need only to be known to be approved.\r\n     Mrs. Stanton must move heaven and earth now to secure this bill,\r\n     and she can, if she will only try. I should go there myself this\r\n     very night, but I must watch and encourage friends here. The\r\n     Earnings Bill has passed the House, and is in Committee of the\r\n     Whole in the Senate. Then a Guardianship Bill must be drafted and\r\n     put through if possible. I returned from New York last evening;\r\n     have taken the \"Cooper Union,\" for our National Convention in\r\n     May. Saw Miss Howland; she said Mr. Beecher's lecture is to be in\r\n     this week's _Independent_. Only think how many priestly eyes will\r\n     be compelled to look at its defiled page. Theodore Tilton told me\r\n     that Mr. Beecher had had a severe battle to get into _The\r\n     Independent_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton, in answering Miss Anthony's appeal, says:\r\n\r\n     I am willing to do the appointed work at Albany. If Napoleon says\r\n     cross the Alps, they are crossed. I can not, my dear friend,\r\n     \"move heaven and earth,\" but I will do what I can with pen and\r\n     brain. You must come here and start me on the right train of\r\n     thought, as your practical knowledge of just what is wanted is\r\n     everything in getting up the right document. Kind regards to the\r\n     anti-slavery host now with you. I did not think that the easy\r\n     arm-chair I occupied on the Auburn platform was to bring me so\r\n     much glory. Did you know the resolutions of that meeting were\r\n     read on the floor of Congress?--that pleased me greatly. I am\r\n     very proud to stand maternal sponsor for the whole string. I wish\r\n     our Albany resolutions had more snap in them. The Garrison clique\r\n     are the only men in this nation that know how to write a\r\n     resolution.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of February Mrs. Stanton addressed the Legislature on\r\nwoman's right of suffrage and the bill then pending in the Senate. A\r\nmagnificent audience greeted her in the Capitol. She occupied the\r\nSpeaker's desk, and was introduced by Senator Hammond, and spoke as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     GENTLEMEN OF THE JUDICIARY:--There are certain natural rights as\r\n     inalienable to civilization as are the rights of air and motion\r\n     to the savage in the wilderness. The natural rights of the\r\n     civilized man and woman are government, property, the harmonious\r\n     development of all their powers, and the gratification of their\r\n     desires. There are a few people we now and then meet who, like\r\n     Jeremy Bentham, scout the idea of natural rights in civilization,\r\n     and pronounce them mere metaphors, declaring that there are no\r\n     rights aside from those the law confers. If the law made man too,\r\n     that might do, for then he could be made to order to fit the\r\n     particular niche he was designed to fill. But inasmuch as God\r\n     made man in His own image, with capacities and powers as\r\n     boundless as the universe, whose exigencies no mere human law can\r\n     meet, it is evident that the man must ever stand first; the law\r\n     but the creature of his wants; the law giver but the mouthpiece\r\n     of humanity. If, then, the nature of a being decides its rights,\r\n     every individual comes into this world with rights that are not\r\n     transferable. He does not bring them like a pack on his back,\r\n     that may be stolen from him, but they are a component part of\r\n     himself, the laws which insure his growth and development. The\r\n     individual may be put in the stocks, body and soul, he may be\r\n     dwarfed, crippled, killed, but his rights no man can get; they\r\n     live and die with him.\r\n\r\n     Though the atmosphere is forty miles deep all round the globe, no\r\n     man can do more than fill his own lungs. No man can see, hear, or\r\n     smell but just so far; and though hundreds are deprived of these\r\n     senses, his are not the more acute. Though rights have been\r\n     abundantly supplied by the good Father, no man can appropriate to\r\n     himself those that belong to another. A citizen can have but one\r\n     vote, fill but one office, though thousands are not permitted to\r\n     do either. These axioms prove that woman's poverty does not add\r\n     to man's wealth, and if, in the plenitude of his power, he should\r\n     secure to her the exercise of all her God-given rights, her\r\n     wealth could not bring poverty to him. There is a kind of nervous\r\n     unrest always manifested by those in power, whenever new claims\r\n     are started by those out of their own immediate class. The\r\n     philosophy of this is very plain. They imagine that if the rights\r\n     of this new class be granted, they must, of necessity, sacrifice\r\n     something of what they already possess. They can not divest\r\n     themselves of the idea that rights are very much like lands,\r\n     stocks, bonds, and mortgages, and that if every new claimant be\r\n     satisfied, the supply of human rights must in time run low. You\r\n     might as well carp at the birth of every child, lest there should\r\n     not be enough air left to inflate your lungs; at the success of\r\n     every scholar, for fear that your draughts at the fountain of\r\n     knowledge could not be so long and deep; at the glory of every\r\n     hero, lest there be no glory left for you....\r\n\r\n     If the object of government is to protect the weak against the\r\n     strong, how unwise to place the power wholly in the hands of the\r\n     strong. Yet that is the history of all governments, even the\r\n     model republic of these United States. You who have read the\r\n     history of nations, from Moses down to our last election, where\r\n     have you ever seen one class looking after the interests of\r\n     another? Any of you can readily see the defects in other\r\n     governments, and pronounce sentence against those who have\r\n     sacrificed the masses to themselves; but when we come to our own\r\n     case, we are blinded by custom and self-interest. Some of you who\r\n     have no capital can see the injustice which the laborer suffers;\r\n     some of you who have no slaves, can see the cruelty of his\r\n     oppression; but who of you appreciate the galling humiliation,\r\n     the refinements of degradation, to which women (the mothers,\r\n     wives, sisters, and daughters of freemen) are subject, in this\r\n     the last half of the nineteenth century? How many of you have\r\n     ever read even the laws concerning them that now disgrace your\r\n     statute-books? In cruelty and tyranny, they are not surpassed by\r\n     any slaveholding code in the Southern States; in fact they are\r\n     worse, by just so far as woman, from her social position,\r\n     refinement, and education, is on a more equal ground with the\r\n     oppressor.\r\n\r\n     Allow me just here to call the attention of that party now so\r\n     much interested in the slave of the Carolinas, to the similarity\r\n     in his condition and that of the mothers, wives, and daughters of\r\n     the Empire State. The negro has no name. He is Cuffy Douglas or\r\n     Cuffy Brooks, just whose Cuffy he may chance to be. The woman has\r\n     no name. She is Mrs. Richard Roe or Mrs. John Doe, just whose\r\n     Mrs. she may chance to be. Cuffy has no right to his earnings; he\r\n     can not buy or sell, or lay up anything that he can call his own.\r\n     Mrs. Roe has no right to her earnings she can neither buy nor\r\n     sell, make contracts, nor lay up anything that she can call her\r\n     own. Cuffy has no right to his children; they can be sold from\r\n     him at any time. Mrs. Roe has no right to her children; they may\r\n     be bound out to cancel a father's debts of honor. The unborn\r\n     child, even by the last will of the father, may be placed under\r\n     the guardianship of a stranger and a foreigner. Cuffy has no\r\n     legal existence; he is subject to restraint and moderate\r\n     chastisement. Mrs. Roe has no legal existence; she has not the\r\n     best right to her own person. The husband has the power to\r\n     restrain, and administer moderate chastisement.\r\n\r\n     Blackstone declares that the husband and wife are one, and\r\n     learned commentators have decided that that one is the husband.\r\n     In all civil codes, you will find them classified as one. Certain\r\n     rights and immunities, such and such privileges are to be secured\r\n     to white male citizens. What have women and negroes to do with\r\n     rights? What know they of government, war, or glory?\r\n\r\n     The prejudice against color, of which we hear so much, is no\r\n     stronger than that against sex. It is produced by the same cause,\r\n     and manifested very much in the same way. The negro's skin and\r\n     the woman's sex are both _prima facie_ evidence that they were\r\n     intended to be in subjection to the white Saxon man. The few\r\n     social privileges which the man gives the woman, he makes up to\r\n     the negro in civil rights. The woman may sit at the same table\r\n     and eat with the white man; the free negro may hold property and\r\n     vote. The woman may sit in the same pew with the white man in\r\n     church; the free negro may enter the pulpit and preach. Now, with\r\n     the black man's right to suffrage, the right unquestioned, even\r\n     by Paul, to minister at the altar, it is evident that the\r\n     prejudice against sex is more deeply rooted and more unreasonably\r\n     maintained than that against color. As citizens of a republic,\r\n     which should we most highly prize, social privileges or civil\r\n     rights? The latter, most certainly.\r\n\r\n     To those who do not feel the injustice and degradation of the\r\n     condition, there is something inexpressibly comical in man's\r\n     \"citizen woman.\" It reminds me of those monsters I used to see in\r\n     the old world, head and shoulders woman, and the rest of the body\r\n     sometimes fish and sometimes beast. I used to think, What a\r\n     strange conceit! but now I see how perfectly it represents man's\r\n     idea! Look over all his laws concerning us, and you will see just\r\n     enough of woman to tell of her existence; all the rest is\r\n     submerged, or made to crawl upon the earth. Just imagine an\r\n     inhabitant of another planet entertaining himself some pleasant\r\n     evening in searching over our great national compact, our\r\n     Declaration of Independence, our Constitutions, or some of our\r\n     statute-books; what would he think of those \"women and negroes\"\r\n     that must be so fenced in, so guarded against? Why, he would\r\n     certainly suppose we were monsters, like those fabulous giants or\r\n     Brobdignagians of olden times, so dangerous to civilized man,\r\n     from our size, ferocity, and power. Then let him take up our\r\n     poets, from Pope down to Dana; let him listen to our Fourth of\r\n     July toasts, and some of the sentimental adulations of social\r\n     life, and no logic could convince him that this creature of the\r\n     law, and this angel of the family altar, could be one and the\r\n     same being. Man is in such a labyrinth of contradictions with his\r\n     marital and property rights; he is so befogged on the whole\r\n     question of maidens, wives, and mothers, that from pure\r\n     benevolence we should relieve him from this troublesome branch of\r\n     legislation. We should vote, and make laws for ourselves. Do not\r\n     be alarmed, dear ladies! You need spend no time reading Grotius,\r\n     Coke, Puffendorf, Blackstone, Bentham, Kent, and Story to find\r\n     out what you need. We may safely trust the shrewd selfishness of\r\n     the white man, and consent to live under the same broad code\r\n     where he has so comfortably ensconced himself. Any legislation\r\n     that will do for man, we may abide by most cheerfully....\r\n\r\n     But, say you, we would not have woman exposed to the grossness\r\n     and vulgarity of public life, or encounter what she must at the\r\n     polls. When you talk, gentlemen, of sheltering woman from the\r\n     rough winds and revolting scenes of real life, you must be either\r\n     talking for effect, or wholly ignorant of what the facts of life\r\n     are. The man, whatever he is, is known to the woman. She is the\r\n     companion, not only of the accomplished statesman, the orator,\r\n     and the scholar; but the vile, vulgar, brutal man has his mother,\r\n     his wife, his sister, his daughter. Yes, delicate, refined,\r\n     educated women are in daily life with the drunkard, the gambler,\r\n     the licentious man, the rogue, and the villain; and if man shows\r\n     out what he is anywhere, it is at his own hearthstone. There are\r\n     over forty thousand drunkards in this State. All these are bound\r\n     by the ties of family to some woman. Allow but a mother and a\r\n     wife to each, and you have over eighty thousand women. All these\r\n     have seen their fathers, brothers, husbands, sons, in the lowest\r\n     and most debased stages of obscenity and degradation. In your own\r\n     circle of friends, do you not know refined women, whose whole\r\n     lives are darkened and saddened by gross and brutal associations?\r\n     Now, gentlemen, do you talk to woman of a rude jest or jostle at\r\n     the polls, where noble, virtuous men stand ready to protect her\r\n     person and her rights, when, alone in the darkness and solitude\r\n     and gloom of night, she has trembled on her own threshold,\r\n     awaiting the return of a husband from his midnight revels?--when,\r\n     stepping from her chamber, she has beheld her royal monarch, her\r\n     lord and master--her legal representative--the protector of her\r\n     property, her home, her children, and her person, down on his\r\n     hands and knees slowly crawling up the stairs? Behold him in her\r\n     chamber--in her bed! The fairy tale of \"Beauty and the Beast\" is\r\n     far too often realized in life. Gentlemen, such scenes as woman\r\n     has witnessed at her own fireside, where no eye save Omnipotence\r\n     could pity, no strong arm could help, can never be realized at\r\n     the polls, never equaled elsewhere, this side the bottomless pit.\r\n     No, woman has not hitherto lived in the clouds, surrounded by an\r\n     atmosphere of purity and peace--but she has been the companion of\r\n     man in health, in sickness, and in death, in his highest and in\r\n     his lowest moments. She has worshiped him as a saint and an\r\n     orator, and pitied him as madman or a fool. In Paradise, man and\r\n     woman were placed together, and so they must ever be. They must\r\n     sink or rise together. If man is low and wretched and vile, woman\r\n     can not escape the contagion, and any atmosphere that is unfit\r\n     for woman to breathe is not fit for man. Verily, the sins of the\r\n     fathers shall be visited upon the children to the third and\r\n     fourth generation. You, by your unwise legislation, have crippled\r\n     and dwarfed womanhood, by closing to her all honorable and\r\n     lucrative means of employment, have driven her into the garrets\r\n     and dens of our cities, where she now revenges herself on your\r\n     innocent sons, sapping the very foundations of national virtue\r\n     and strength. Alas! for the young men just coming on the stage of\r\n     action, who soon shall fill your vacant places--our future\r\n     Senators, our Presidents, the expounders of our constitutional\r\n     law! Terrible are the penalties we are now suffering for the ages\r\n     of injustice done to woman.\r\n\r\n     Again, it is said that the majority of women do not ask for any\r\n     change in the laws; that it is time enough to give them the\r\n     elective franchise when they, as a class, demand it.\r\n\r\n     Wise statesmen legislate for the best interests of the nation;\r\n     the State, for the highest good of its citizens; the Christian,\r\n     for the conversion of the world. Where would have been our\r\n     railroads, our telegraphs, our ocean steamers, our canals and\r\n     harbors, our arts and sciences, if government had withheld the\r\n     means from the far-seeing minority? This State established our\r\n     present system of common schools, fully believing that educated\r\n     men and women would make better citizens than ignorant ones. In\r\n     making this provision for the education of its children, had they\r\n     waited for a majority of the urchins of this State to petition\r\n     for schools, how many, think you, would have asked to be\r\n     transplanted from the street to the school-house? Does the State\r\n     wait for the criminal to ask for his prison-house? the insane,\r\n     the idiot, the deaf and dumb for his asylum? Does the Christian,\r\n     in his love to all mankind, wait for the majority of the\r\n     benighted heathen to ask him for the gospel? No; unasked and\r\n     unwelcomed, he crosses the trackless ocean, rolls off the\r\n     mountain of superstition that oppresses the human mind, proclaims\r\n     the immortality of the soul, the dignity of manhood, the right of\r\n     all to be free and happy.\r\n\r\n     No, gentlemen, if there is but one woman in this State who feels\r\n     the injustice of her position, she should not be denied her\r\n     inalienable rights, because the common household drudge and the\r\n     silly butterfly of fashion are ignorant of all laws, both human\r\n     and Divine. Because they know nothing of governments, or rights,\r\n     and therefore ask nothing, shall my petitions be unheard? I stand\r\n     before you the rightful representative of woman, claiming a share\r\n     in the halo of glory that has gathered round her in the ages, and\r\n     by the wisdom of her past words and works, her peerless heroism\r\n     and self-sacrifice, I challenge your admiration; and, moreover,\r\n     claiming, as I do, a share in all her outrages and sufferings, in\r\n     the cruel injustice, contempt, and ridicule now heaped upon her,\r\n     in her deep degradation, hopeless wretchedness, by all that is\r\n     helpless in her present condition, that is false in law and\r\n     public sentiment, I urge your generous consideration; for as my\r\n     heart swells with pride to behold woman in the highest walks of\r\n     literature and art, it grows big enough to take in those who are\r\n     bleeding in the dust.\r\n\r\n     Now do not think, gentlemen, we wish you to do a great many\r\n     troublesome things for us. We do not ask our legislators to spend\r\n     a whole session in fixing up a code of laws to satisfy a class of\r\n     most unreasonable women. We ask no more than the poor devils in\r\n     the Scripture asked, \"Let us alone.\" In mercy, let us take care\r\n     of ourselves, our property, our children, and our homes. True, we\r\n     are not so strong, so wise, so crafty as you are, but if any kind\r\n     friend leaves us a little money, or we can by great industry earn\r\n     fifty cents a day, we would rather buy bread and clothes for our\r\n     children than cigars and champagne for our legal protectors.\r\n     There has been a great deal written and said about protection.\r\n     We, as a class, are tired of one kind of protection, that which\r\n     leaves us everything to do, to dare, and to suffer, and strips us\r\n     of all means for its accomplishment. We would not tax man to take\r\n     care of us. No, the Great Father has endowed all his creatures\r\n     with the necessary powers for self-support, self-defense, and\r\n     protection. We do not ask man to represent us; it is hard enough\r\n     in times like these for man to carry backbone enough to represent\r\n     himself. So long as the mass of men spend most of their time on\r\n     the fence, not knowing which way to jump, they are surely in no\r\n     condition to tell us where we had better stand. In pity for man,\r\n     we would no longer hang like a millstone round his neck. Undo\r\n     what man did for us in the dark ages, and strike out all special\r\n     legislation for us; strike the words \"white male\" from all your\r\n     constitutions, and then, with fair sailing, let us sink or swim,\r\n     live or die, survive or perish together.\r\n\r\n     At Athens, an ancient apologue tells us, on the completion of the\r\n     temple of Minerva, a statue of the goddess was wanted to occupy\r\n     the crowning point of the edifice. Two of the greatest artists\r\n     produced what each deemed his masterpiece. One of these figures\r\n     was the size of life, admirably designed, exquisitely finished,\r\n     softly rounded, and beautifully refined. The other was of\r\n     Amazonian stature, and so boldly chiselled that it looked more\r\n     like masonry than sculpture. The eyes of all were attracted by\r\n     the first, and turned away in contempt from the second. That,\r\n     therefore, was adopted, and the other rejected, almost with\r\n     resentment, as though an insult had been offered to a discerning\r\n     public. The favored statue was accordingly borne in triumph to\r\n     the place for which it was designed, in the presence of\r\n     applauding thousands, but as it receded from their upturned eyes,\r\n     all, all at once agaze upon it, the thunders of applause\r\n     unaccountably died away--a general misgiving ran through every\r\n     bosom--the mob themselves stood like statues, as silent and as\r\n     petrified, for as it slowly went up, and up the soft expression\r\n     of those chiselled features, the delicate curves and outlines of\r\n     the limbs and figure, became gradually fainter and fainter, and\r\n     when at last it readied the place for which it was intended, it\r\n     was a shapeless ball, enveloped in mist. Of course, the idol of\r\n     the hour was now clamored down as rationally as it had been cried\r\n     up, and its dishonored rival, with no good will and no good looks\r\n     on the part of the chagrined populace, was reared in its stead.\r\n     As it ascended, the sharp angles faded away, the rough points\r\n     became smooth, the features full of expression, the whole figure\r\n     radiant with majesty and beauty. The rude hewn mass, that before\r\n     had scarcely appeared to bear even the human form, assumed at\r\n     once the divinity which it represented, being so perfectly\r\n     proportioned to the dimensions of the building, and to the\r\n     elevation on which it stood, that it seemed as though Pallas\r\n     herself had alighted upon the pinnacle of the temple in person,\r\n     to receive the homage of her worshippers.\r\n\r\n     The woman of the nineteenth century is the shapeless ball in the\r\n     lofty position which she was designed fully and nobly to fill.\r\n     The place is not too high, too large, too sacred for woman, but\r\n     the type that you have chosen is far too small for it. The woman\r\n     we declare unto you is the rude, misshapen, unpolished object of\r\n     the successful artist. From your stand-point, you are absorbed\r\n     with the defects alone. The true artist sees the harmony between\r\n     the object and its destination. Man, the sculptor, has carved out\r\n     his ideal, and applauding thousands welcome his success. He has\r\n     made a woman that from his low stand-point looks fair and\r\n     beautiful, a being without rights, or hopes, or fears but in\r\n     him--neither noble, virtuous, nor independent. Where do we see,\r\n     in Church or State, in school-house or at the fireside, the much\r\n     talked-of moral power of woman? Like those Athenians, we have\r\n     bowed down and worshiped in woman, beauty, grace, the exquisite\r\n     proportions, the soft and beautifully rounded outline, her\r\n     delicacy, refinement, and silent helplessness--all well when she\r\n     is viewed simply as an object of sight, never to rise one foot\r\n     above the dust from which she sprung. But if she is to be raised\r\n     up to adorn a temple, or represent a divinity--if she is to fill\r\n     the niche of wife and counsellor to true and noble men, if she is\r\n     to be the mother, the educator of a race of heroes or martyrs, of\r\n     a Napoleon, or a Jesus--then must the type of womanhood be on a\r\n     larger scale than that yet carved by man.\r\n\r\n     In vain would the rejected artist have reasoned with the\r\n     Athenians as to the superiority of his production; nothing short\r\n     of the experiment they made could have satisfied them. And what\r\n     of your experiment, what of your wives, your homes? Alas! for the\r\n     folly and vacancy that meet you there! But for your club-houses\r\n     and newspapers, what would social life be to you? Where are your\r\n     beautiful women? your frail ones, taught to lean lovingly and\r\n     confidingly on man? Where are the crowds of educated\r\n     dependents--where the long line of pensioners on man's bounty?\r\n     Where all the young girls, taught to believe that marriage is the\r\n     only legitimate object of a woman's pursuit--they who stand\r\n     listlessly on life's shores, waiting, year after year, like the\r\n     sick man at the pool of Bethesda, for some one to come and put\r\n     them in? These are they who by their ignorance and folly curse\r\n     almost every fireside with some human specimen of deformity or\r\n     imbecility. These are they who fill the gloomy abodes of poverty\r\n     and vice in our vast metropolis. These are they who patrol the\r\n     streets of our cities, to give our sons their first lessons in\r\n     infamy. These are they who fill our asylums, and make night\r\n     hideous with their cries and groans.\r\n\r\n     The women who are called masculine, who are brave, courageous,\r\n     self-reliant and independent, are they who in the face of adverse\r\n     winds have kept one steady course upward and onward in the paths\r\n     of virtue and peace--they who have taken their gauge of womanhood\r\n     from their own native strength and dignity--they who have learned\r\n     for themselves the will of God concerning them. This is our type\r\n     of womanhood. Will you help us raise it up, that you too may see\r\n     its beautiful proportions--that you may behold the outline of the\r\n     goddess who is yet to adorn your temple of Freedom? We are\r\n     building a model republic; our edifice will one day need a\r\n     crowning glory. Let the artists be wisely chosen. Let them begin\r\n     their work. Here is a temple to Liberty, to human rights, on\r\n     whose portals behold the glorious declaration, \"All men are\r\n     created equal.\" The sun has never yet shone upon any of man's\r\n     creations that can compare with this. The artist who can mold a\r\n     statue worthy to crown magnificence like this, must be godlike in\r\n     his conceptions, grand in his comprehensions, sublimely beautiful\r\n     in his power of execution. The woman--the crowning glory of the\r\n     model republic among the nations of the earth--what must she not\r\n     be? (Loud applause).[160]\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ACT CONCERNING THE RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES OF HUSBAND AND WIFE.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1860[161] was offered by Andrew J. Colvin in the Senate as\r\na substitute for a bill from the Assembly, which was simply an\r\namendment of the law of 1848. Senators Hammond, Ramsey, and Colvin\r\nconstituted the Judiciary Committee, to whom the bill was referred.\r\nMr. Colvin objected to it for want of breadth in giving to married\r\nwomen the rights to which he thought them entitled, and urged that a\r\nmuch more liberal measure was demanded by the spirit of the times. In\r\none of Miss Anthony's interviews with Mr. Colvin, she handed him a\r\nvery radical bill just introduced in the Massachusetts Legislature,\r\nwhich after due examination and the addition of two or three more\r\nliberal clauses, was accepted by the Committee, reported to the Senate\r\nby Mr. Colvin, and adopted by that body February 28, 1860[162]. The\r\nbill was concurred in by the Assembly, and signed by the Governor,\r\nEdwin D. Morgan. It is quite remarkable that the bill in its transit\r\ndid not receive a single alteration, modification, or amendment from\r\nthe time it left Mr. Colvin's hands until it took its place on the\r\nstatute-book. The women of the State who labored so persistently for\r\nthis measure, felt that the victory at last was due in no small degree\r\nto the deep interest and patient skill of Andrew J. Colvin. Hon. Anson\r\nBingham, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who did good service in\r\nthe Assembly at this time, should be gratefully remembered by the\r\nwomen of New York. Mr. Bingham acted in concert with Mr. Colvin, both\r\nearnestly putting their shoulders to the wheel, one in the Assembly\r\nand one in the Senate, and with the women pulling all the wires they\r\ncould outside, together they pushed the grand measure through.\r\n\r\nJudge Bingham served our cause also by articles on all phases of the\r\nquestion over the signature of \"Senex,\" published in many journals\r\nthroughout the State. And this, too, at an early day, when every word\r\nin favor of woman's rights was of immense value in breaking down the\r\nprejudice of the ages.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, another act of great benefit to a large number of\r\nhousekeepers, called the \"Boarding House Law,\" was secured by the same\r\nmembers. Miss Emily Howland, Mrs. Margaret Murray, Mrs. Manning, and\r\nMrs. Griffith Satterlee spent some weeks in Albany using their\r\ninfluence in favor of this measure.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1860, Emily Howland arranged a course of lectures on\r\nWoman's Rights, to be given in Cooper Institute, New York. Henry Ward\r\nBeecher delivered his first lecture on the question in this course,\r\nreceiving his fee of $100 in advance, as it was said he considered no\r\nengagement of that sort imperative without previous payment. Mr.\r\nBeecher's speech was published in full in _The New York Independent_,\r\nof which he was then editor-in-chief. The State Committee purchased a\r\nlarge number, which Lydia Mott, of Albany, laid on the desk of every\r\nmember of both Houses. At the time we felt the speech worth to our\r\ncause all it cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nTENTH NATIONAL WOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nCOOPER INSTITUTE, NEW YORK, MAY 10-11, 1860.\r\n\r\nA large audience assembled in Cooper Institute at 10-1/2 o'clock,\r\nThursday morning. Susan B. Anthony called the Convention to order, and\r\nsubmitted a list of officers,[163] nominated at a preliminary meeting,\r\nwhich was adopted without dissent.\r\n\r\nThe President, Martha C. Wright, of Auburn, on taking the Chair,\r\naddressed the Convention as follows:\r\n\r\n     I have only to thank you for the honor you have conferred by\r\n     electing me to preside over the deliberations of this Convention.\r\n     I shall leave it to others to speak of the purposes of this great\r\n     movement and of the successes which have already been achieved.\r\n\r\n     There are those in our movement who ask, \"What is the use of\r\n     these Conventions? What is the use of this constant iteration of\r\n     the same things?\" When we see what has been already achieved, we\r\n     learn the use of this \"foolishness of preaching:\" and after all\r\n     that we demand has been granted, as it will be soon, _The New\r\n     York Observer_ will piously fold its hands and roll up its eyes,\r\n     and say, \"This beneficent movement we have always advocated,\" and\r\n     the pulpits will say \"Amen!\" (Laughter and applause). Then will\r\n     come forward women who have gained courage from the efforts and\r\n     sacrifices of others, and the great world will say, \"Here come\r\n     the women who are going to do something, and not talk.\"\r\n\r\n     There are those, too, who find fault with the freedom of our\r\n     platform, who stand aloof and criticise, fearful of being\r\n     involved in something that they can not fully endorse. Forgetting\r\n     that, as Macaulay says, \"Liberty alone can cure the evils of\r\n     liberty,\" they fear to trust on the platform all who have a word\r\n     to say. But we have invited all to come forward and speak, and\r\n     not to stand aside and afterward criticise what has been said. We\r\n     trust that those present who have an opinion, who have a word to\r\n     say, whether they have ever spoken before or not, will speak now.\r\n     If they disapprove of our resolutions, if they disapprove of\r\n     anything that is said on this platform, let them oppose if they\r\n     can not unite with us. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nSusan B. Anthony was then introduced, and read the following report:\r\n\r\n     For our encouragement in laboring for the elevation of woman, it\r\n     is well ever and anon to review the advancing steps. Each year we\r\n     hail with pleasure new accessions to our faith. Strong words of\r\n     cheer have come to us on every breeze. Brave men and true, from\r\n     the higher walks of literature and art, from the bar, the bench,\r\n     the pulpit, and legislative halls, are ready now to help woman\r\n     wherever she claims to stand. The Press, too, has changed its\r\n     tone. Instead of ridicule, we now have grave debate. And still\r\n     more substantial praises of gold and silver have come to us. A\r\n     gift of $5,000 from unknown hands; a rich legacy from the coffers\r\n     of a Boston merchant prince--the late Charles F. Hovey; and, but\r\n     a few days ago, $400,000 from Mr. Vassar, of Poughkeepsie, to\r\n     found a college for girls, equal in all respects to Yale and\r\n     Harvard.\r\n\r\n     We had in New York a legislative act passed at the last session,\r\n     securing to married women their rights to their earnings and\r\n     their children. Other States have taken onward steps. And, from\r\n     what is being done on all sides, we have reason to believe that,\r\n     as the Northern States shall one by one remodel their\r\n     Constitutions, the right of suffrage will be granted to women.\r\n     Six years hence New York proposes to revise her Constitution.\r\n     These should be years of effort with all those who believe that\r\n     it is the right and the duty of every citizen of a State to have\r\n     a voice in the laws that govern them.\r\n\r\n     Woman is being so educated that she will feel herself capable of\r\n     assuming grave responsibilities as lawgiver and administrator.\r\n     She is crowding into higher avocations and new branches of\r\n     industry. She already occupies the highest places in literature\r\n     and art. The more liberal lyceums are open to her, and she is\r\n     herself the subject of the most popular lectures now before the\r\n     public. The young women of our academies and high schools are\r\n     asserting their right to the discipline of declamation and\r\n     discussion, and the departments of science and mathematics.\r\n     Pewholders, of the most orthodox sects, are taking their right to\r\n     a voice in the government of the church, and in the face of\r\n     priests, crying \"let your women keep silence in the churches,\"\r\n     yes, at the very horns of the altar, calmly, deliberately, and\r\n     persistently casting their votes in the choice of church officers\r\n     and pastors.[164] Mass-meetings to sympathize with the \"strikers\"\r\n     of Massachusetts are being called in this metropolis by women.\r\n     Women are ordained ministers, and licensed physicians. Elizabeth\r\n     Blackwell has founded a hospital in this city, where she proposes\r\n     a thorough medical education, both theoretical and practical, for\r\n     young women. And this Institute in which we are now assembled,\r\n     with its school of design, its library and reading-room, where\r\n     the arts and sciences are freely taught to women, and this hall,\r\n     so cheerfully granted to our Convention, shows the magnanimity of\r\n     its founder, Peter Cooper. All these are the results of our\r\n     twenty years of agitation. And it matters not to us, though the\r\n     men and the women who echo back our thought do fail to recognize\r\n     the source of power, and while they rejoice in each onward step\r\n     achieved in the face of ridicule and persecution, ostracise those\r\n     who have done the work. Who of our literary women has yet\r\n     ventured one word of praise or recognition of the heroic\r\n     enunciators of the great idea of woman's equality--of Mary\r\n     Woolstonecraft, Frances Wright, Ernestine L. Rose, Lucretia Mott,\r\n     Elizabeth Cady Stanton? It matters not to those who live for the\r\n     race, and not for self alone, who has the praise, so that justice\r\n     be done to woman in Church, in State, and at the fireside--an\r\n     equal everywhere with man--they will not complain, though even\r\n     _The New York Observer_ itself does claim to have done for them\r\n     the work.\r\n\r\n     During the past six years this State has been thoroughly\r\n     canvassed, and every county that has been visited by our\r\n     lecturers and tracts has rolled up petitions by the hundreds and\r\n     thousands asking for woman's right to vote and hold office--her\r\n     right to her person, her wages, her children, and her home. Again\r\n     and again have we held Conventions at the capital, and addressed\r\n     our Legislature, demanding the exercise of all our rights as\r\n     citizens of the Empire State. During the past year, we have had\r\n     six women[165] lecturing in New York for several months each.\r\n     Conventions have been held in forty counties, one or more\r\n     lectures delivered in one hundred and fifty towns and villages,\r\n     our petitions circulated, and our tracts and documents sold and\r\n     gratuitously distributed throughout the entire length and breadth\r\n     of the State.\r\n\r\n     A State Convention was held at Albany early in February. Large\r\n     numbers of the members of the Legislature listened respectfully\r\n     and attentively to the discussions of its several sessions, and\r\n     expressed themselves converts to the claims for woman. The bills\r\n     for woman's right to her property, her earnings, and the\r\n     guardianship of her children passed both branches of the\r\n     Legislature with scarce a dissenting voice, and received the\r\n     prompt signature of the Governor.\r\n\r\n     Our Legislature passed yet another bill that brings great relief\r\n     to a large class of women. It was called the Boarding-House Bill.\r\n     It provides that the keepers of private boarding-houses shall\r\n     have the right of lien on the property of boarders, precisely the\r\n     same as do hotel-keepers. We closed our work by a joint hearing\r\n     before the Committees of the Judiciary at the Capitol on the 19th\r\n     of March. Elizabeth Cady Stanton addressed them. The Assembly\r\n     Chamber was densely packed, and she was listened to with marked\r\n     attention and respect. The Judiciary Committees of neither House\r\n     reported on our petition for the right of suffrage, though the\r\n     Chairman, with a large minority of the House Committee and a\r\n     majority of the Senate Committee, favored the claim. The Hon. A.\r\n     J. Colvin, of the Senate Committee, in a letter to me, says:\r\n\r\n     \"The subject was presented at so late a day as to preclude\r\n     action. While a majority of the Senate Committee I think were\r\n     favorable, a majority of the House Committee, so far as I could\r\n     learn, were opposed. So many progressive measures had passed both\r\n     Houses that I felt apprehensive we might perhaps be running too\r\n     great a risk by urging this question of justice and reform at\r\n     this session. I did not therefore press it. Should I remain in\r\n     the Senate, I may take occasion at an early day in the next\r\n     session to bring up the subject and present my views at length.\r\n     The more reflection I give, the more my mind becomes convinced\r\n     that in a Republican Government, we have no right to deny to\r\n     woman the privileges she claims. Besides, the moral element which\r\n     those privileges would bring into existence would, in my\r\n     judgment, have a powerful influence in perpetuating our form of\r\n     government. It may be deemed best, at the next session, to urge\r\n     an early Constitutional Convention. In case one should be called,\r\n     your friends should be prepared to meet the emergency. Is the\r\n     public mind sufficiently enlightened to accept a constitution\r\n     recognizing the right of women to vote and hold office? You\r\n     should consider this.\"\r\n\r\n     The entire expense of the New York State work during the past\r\n     year is nearly four thousand dollars. The present year we\r\n     propose to expend our funds and efforts mostly in Ohio, to\r\n     obtain, if possible, for the women of that State, the liberal\r\n     laws we have secured for ourselves. Ohio, too, is soon to revise\r\n     her Constitution, and we trust she will not be far behind New\r\n     York in recognizing the full equality of woman. We who have\r\n     grasped the idea of woman's destiny, her power and influence, the\r\n     trinity of her existence as woman, wife, and mother, can most\r\n     earnestly work for her elevation to that high position that it is\r\n     the will of God she should ever fill. Though we have not yet\r\n     realized the fullness of our hopes, let us rest in the belief\r\n     that in all these years of struggle, no earnest thought, or word,\r\n     or prayer has been breathed in vain. The influence has gone\r\n     forth, the great ocean has been moved, and those who watch, e'en\r\n     now may see the mighty waves of truth slowly swelling on the\r\n     shores of time.\r\n\r\n          \"One accent of the Holy Ghost,\r\n          A heedless word hath never lost.\"\r\n\r\n     ERNESTINE L. ROSE being introduced, said: Frances Wright was the\r\n     first woman in this country who spoke on the equality of the\r\n     sexes. She had indeed a hard task before her. The elements were\r\n     entirely unprepared. She had to break up the time-hardened soil\r\n     of conservatism, and her reward was sure--the same reward that is\r\n     always bestowed upon those who are in the vanguard of any great\r\n     movement. She was subjected to public odium, slander, and\r\n     persecution. But these were not the only things that she\r\n     received. Oh, she had her reward!--that reward of which no\r\n     enemies could deprive her, which no slanders could make less\r\n     precious--the eternal reward of knowing that she had done her\r\n     duty; the reward springing from the consciousness of right, of\r\n     endeavoring to benefit unborn generations. How delightful to see\r\n     the molding of the minds around you, the infusing of your\r\n     thoughts and aspirations into others, until one by one they stand\r\n     by your side, without knowing how they came there! That reward\r\n     she had. It has been her glory, it is the glory of her memory;\r\n     and the time will come when society will have outgrown its old\r\n     prejudices, and stepped with one foot, at least, upon the\r\n     elevated platform on which she took her position. But owing to\r\n     the fact that the elements were unprepared, she naturally could\r\n     not succeed to any great extent.\r\n\r\n     After her, in 1837, the subject of woman's rights was again taken\r\n     hold of--aye, taken hold of by woman; and the soil having been\r\n     already somewhat prepared, she began to sow the seeds for the\r\n     future growth, the fruits of which we now begin to enjoy.\r\n     Petitions were circulated and sent to our Legislature, and who\r\n     can tell the hardships that then met those who undertook that\r\n     great work! I went from house to house with a petition for\r\n     signatures simply asking our Legislature to allow married women\r\n     to hold real estate in their own name. What did I meet with? Why,\r\n     the very name exposed one to ridicule, if not to worse treatment.\r\n     The women said: \"We have rights enough; we want no more\"; and the\r\n     men, as a matter of course, echoed it, and said: \"You have\r\n     rights' enough; nay, you have too many already.\" (Laughter). But\r\n     by perseverance in sending petitions to the Legislature, and, at\r\n     the same time, enlightening the public mind on the subject, we\r\n     at last accomplished our purpose. We had to adopt the method\r\n     which physicians sometimes use, when they are called to a patient\r\n     who is so hopelessly sick that he is unconscious of his pain and\r\n     suffering. We had to describe to women their own position, to\r\n     explain to them the burdens that rested so heavily upon them, and\r\n     through these means, as a wholesome irritant, we roused public\r\n     opinion on the subject, and through public opinion, we acted upon\r\n     the Legislature, and in 1848-49, they gave us the great boon for\r\n     which we asked, by enacting that a woman who possessed property\r\n     previous to marriage, or obtained it after marriage, should be\r\n     allowed to hold it in her own name. Thus far, thus good; but it\r\n     was only a beginning, and we went on. In 1848 we had the first\r\n     Woman's Rights Convention, and then some of our papers thought it\r\n     only a very small affair, called together by a few \"strong-minded\r\n     women,\" and would pass away like a nine-days' wonder. They little\r\n     knew woman! They little knew that if woman takes anything\r\n     earnestly in her hands, she will not lay it aside unaccomplished.\r\n     (Applause). We have continued our Conventions ever since. A few\r\n     years ago, when we sent a petition to our Legislature, we\r\n     obtained, with but very little effort, upward of thirteen\r\n     thousand signatures. What a contrast between this number and the\r\n     five signatures attached to the first petition, in 1837! Since\r\n     then, we might have had hundreds of thousands of signatures, but\r\n     it is no longer necessary. Public opinion is too well known to\r\n     require a long array of names.\r\n\r\n     We have been often asked. \"What is the use of Conventions? Why\r\n     talk? Why not go to work?\" Just as if the thought did not precede\r\n     the act! Those who act without previously thinking, are not good\r\n     for much. Thought is first required, then the expression of it,\r\n     and that leads to action; and action based upon thought never\r\n     needs to be reversed; it is lasting and profitable, and produces\r\n     the desired effect. I know that there are many who take advantage\r\n     of this movement, and then say: \"You are doing nothing; only\r\n     talking.\" Yes, doing nothing! We have only broken up the ground\r\n     and sowed the seed; they are reaping the benefit, and yet they\r\n     tell us we have done nothing! Mrs. Swisshelm, who has proclaimed\r\n     herself to be \"no woman's rights, woman,\" has accepted a position\r\n     as inspector of logs and lumber. (Laughter). Well, I have no\r\n     objection to her having that avocation, if she have a taste and\r\n     capacity for it--far from it. But she has accepted still more,\r\n     and I doubt not with a great deal more zest and satisfaction--the\r\n     five hundred dollars salary; and I hope she will enjoy it. Then,\r\n     having accepted both the office and the salary, she folds her\r\n     arms, and says: \"I am none of your strong-minded women; I don't\r\n     go for woman's rights.\" Well, she is still welcome to it. I have\r\n     not the slightest objection that those who proclaim themselves\r\n     not strong-minded, should still reap the benefit of a strong mind\r\n     (applause and laughter); it is for them we work. So there are\r\n     some ladies who think a great deal can be done in the Legislature\r\n     without petitions, without conventions, without lectures, without\r\n     public claim, in fact, without anything, but a little lobbying.\r\n     Well, if they have a, taste for it, they are welcome to engage in\r\n     it; I have not the slightest objection. Yes, I have. I, as a\r\n     woman, being conscious of the evil that is done by these lobby\r\n     loafers in our Legislature and in the halls of Congress, object\r\n     to it. (Loud cheers). I will wait five years longer to have a\r\n     right given to me legitimately, from a sense of justice, rather\r\n     than buy it in an underhand way by lobbying. Whatever my\r\n     sentiments may be, good, bad, or indifferent, I express them, and\r\n     they are known. Nevertheless, if any desire it, let them do that\r\n     work. But what has induced them, what has enabled them, to do\r\n     that work? The Woman's Rights movement, although they are afraid\r\n     or ashamed even of the name \"woman's rights.\"\r\n\r\n     You have been told, and much more might be said on the subject,\r\n     that already the Woman's Rights platform has upon it lawyers,\r\n     ministers, and statesmen--men who are among the highest in the\r\n     nation. I need not mention Wm. Lloyd Garrison, or Wendell\r\n     Phillips; but there are others, those even who are afraid of the\r\n     name of reformer, who have stood upon our platform. Brady! Who\r\n     would ever have expected it? Chapin! Beecher! Think of it for a\r\n     moment! A minister advocating the rights of woman, even her right\r\n     at the ballot-box! What has done it? Our agitation has purified\r\n     the atmosphere, and enabled them to see the injustice that is\r\n     done to woman.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ELIZABETH JONES, of Ohio, was the next speaker. She said: I\r\n     wish to preface my remarks with this resolution:\r\n\r\n          _Resolved_, That woman's sphere can not be bounded. Its\r\n          prescribed orbit is the largest place that in her highest\r\n          development she can fill. The laws of mind are as immutable\r\n          as are those of the planetary world, and the true woman most\r\n          ever revolve around the great moral sun of light and truth.\r\n\r\n     As a general proposition, we say that capacity determines the\r\n     true sphere of action, and indicates the kind of labor to be\r\n     performed. I often hear women discussing this subject, much more\r\n     in earnest than in jest, though they profess to be simply amusing\r\n     themselves. One says: \"If I were a man, I should be a mechanic\";\r\n     another says: \"I should be a merchant.\" One says: \"I am sure I\r\n     should be rich\"; another, in the excess of her humor, thinks she\r\n     should be distinguished. Why do women talk thus? Because one\r\n     feels that she has mechanical genius; the power to construct, to\r\n     perfect. Another understands the secrets of trade, and would like\r\n     to incur the heavy responsibilities it involves. A third is\r\n     conscious that she was born a financier; while a fourth has an\r\n     intuitive perception of the elements of success.\r\n\r\n     Many women are beginning to judge for themselves the proper\r\n     sphere of action, and are not only jesting about what they should\r\n     do under other circumstances, but are already entering upon such\r\n     paths as their taste and capacity indicate. Some will doubtless\r\n     make mistakes, which experience will rectify, and others will\r\n     perhaps persist in striving to do that which it will be very\r\n     evident they have no ability to perform. This is the case with\r\n     men who have had freedom in every sphere. Look at the American\r\n     pulpit, for instance. Go through the country, and listen to those\r\n     who claim to be the messengers of God, and if you do not say that\r\n     many are destitute of capacity to fill the sphere they have\r\n     chosen, we shall regard it as an act of obedience on your part to\r\n     the command which says: \"Judge not, lest ye be judged.\"\r\n     (Laughter). Let adaptation be the rule for pulpit occupancy, and\r\n     while it would eject some who are now no honor to the station,\r\n     and no benefit to the people, it would open the place to many an\r\n     Anna and Miriam and Deborah to fulfill the mission which God has\r\n     clearly indicated by the talents He has bestowed.\r\n\r\n     The world says now, man is God's minister, and woman is not fit\r\n     to call sinners to repentance; but let it say: \"Those who have\r\n     faith in the principles of eternal right, and have power to give\r\n     it utterance; those who have the clearest perceptions of moral\r\n     truth; those who understand the wants of the people, are the\r\n     proper persons, whether they be men or women, to dispense to the\r\n     needy multitude the bread of life.\" This would elevate the\r\n     standard of pulpit qualifications, and bring into the field a far\r\n     greater amount of talent to choose from, and thus would the\r\n     intellectual and spiritual needs of the people be more fully\r\n     answered. What is true of this profession will apply with equal\r\n     force to others. Should I be told that the American bar needs no\r\n     more talent, I would reply that it needs decency, and a\r\n     well-founded self-respect. When you enter a court-room, and\r\n     listen to a cross-examination of a delicate nature, one where\r\n     woman is concerned, and she would rather die a hundred deaths, if\r\n     she could, than to have the case dragged before the public, you\r\n     will see it treated in the coarsest way, as if her holiest\r\n     affections and her most sacred functions were fitting themes for\r\n     brutish men to jeer at. And even in the most ordinary cases,\r\n     gentlemen who would spurn the imputation of incivility in social\r\n     life, will so browbeat and badger a witness, that the most\r\n     disgusting bear-baiting would become by comparison a refined\r\n     amusement. If the young aspirants for legal honors should meet\r\n     among the advocates and judges sensible, dignified, and highly\r\n     cultivated women, they would, if I am not much mistaken, get the\r\n     benefit of certain lessons, upon manners and morals, that it is\r\n     essential for all young men to learn. (Applause). It appears to\r\n     me that by association of men and women in this profession, the\r\n     bar might be purged of this indecorum, and possess the humanity,\r\n     the wisdom, and the dignity that should ever characterize a Court\r\n     of Justice.\r\n\r\n     You need not tell me that the profession would be overstocked, if\r\n     women should enter it, for, like men, they must stand on their\r\n     merits. Let there be no proscription on account of sex. Let\r\n     talent be brought fairly into competition, and although many a\r\n     young man, as well as young woman, would sit down forever\r\n     briefless, having neither the capacity nor the acquirements to\r\n     bring or retain clients, yet their loss would be for the public\r\n     good, and for the honor and respectability of the profession. Let\r\n     the talents of women be fully developed, and no man will lose any\r\n     place that he is qualified to fill in consequence, and no woman\r\n     will obtain that place who has not peculiar fitness. All these\r\n     matters will find their own level, ultimately. I can point you to\r\n     localities now where the people prefer women for teachers. A\r\n     Union School in Northern Ohio, which is made up of ten\r\n     departments, employs women for teachers, and a woman as\r\n     superintendent of the whole. The people reason this way: We\r\n     prefer women, because they bring us the best talent. Not that\r\n     they have better talents than men, but with the latter, teaching\r\n     is generally a stepping-stone to a profession. Woman accepts it\r\n     as her highest post, and brings her best energies. With man, it\r\n     is often a subordinate interest, and his best talents will be\r\n     exercised upon what he regards as something higher and better. As\r\n     in this, so in other things. The time will come when talent or\r\n     capacity will govern the choice and not sex. It is so now in Art,\r\n     to a great extent. I think there is not much known of sex there.\r\n     The world does not care who wrote \"Aurora Leigh.\" It does not\r\n     recognize it as the production of a woman, but as the work of\r\n     genius. Let the artists say what they please, the world does not\r\n     care who chisels Zenobia, so that Zenobia be well chiseled. It\r\n     does not care whether Landseer or Rosa Bonheur paints animals, so\r\n     that animals are well painted. No one says this or that is well\r\n     done for a woman, but he says, this is the work of an artist,\r\n     that has no merit; not because a woman did it, not because a man\r\n     did it, but because the author was destitute of capacity to\r\n     embody the idea.\r\n\r\n     Again, read the little village newspapers, got out by little\r\n     editors, and you will find, in many cases, an utter want of\r\n     ability to fill the place that has been chosen. I hope young\r\n     women will not make such mistakes as these young men have done,\r\n     who might have been supposed to know something, if they had only\r\n     kept still. (Laughter). If these papers, to which I have\r\n     referred, were all in the hands of women, and so destitute of\r\n     editorial pith and point as they now are, I should counsel\r\n     against any further efforts for the elevation of the sex,\r\n     believing the case to be hopeless. (Applause). If I mistake not,\r\n     women have a peculiar fitness for trade. Mrs. Dall says, in her\r\n     second lecture, that on the Island of Nantucket, women have\r\n     engaged in commerce very successfully. They did it in the war,\r\n     and afterward, when destitution drove the men to the whale\r\n     fisheries, and again when they went to California. They have had\r\n     much experience; and Eliza Barney tells of seventy women who\r\n     engaged in trade, and retired with a competence, and besides\r\n     brought up and educated large families of children. She says,\r\n     also, that failures were very uncommon when women managed the\r\n     business, and some of the largest and safest fortunes in Boston\r\n     were founded by women. Whenever, therefore, one shows any ability\r\n     for trade, that is her license for engaging in it--a license\r\n     granted under the higher law, and therefore valid. I went into a\r\n     bonnet store the other day, and saw a man-milliner holding up a\r\n     bonnet on his soft white hand to a lady customer, and expatiating\r\n     upon the beauties of the article with an earnestness, if not the\r\n     eloquence, of an orator. She tried it on, and he went into\r\n     ecstacies. (Laughter). It was so becoming! It was so charming! He\r\n     complimented her, and he complimented the bonnet, and had she not\r\n     been a strong-minded woman, I do not know how much of the\r\n     flattery she would have taken for truth. I thought that man was\r\n     out of his sphere: and not only that, but he had crowded some\r\n     woman out of her appropriate place, out of the realm of taste and\r\n     fashion. (Applause). When I passed out on the street, the harsh,\r\n     discordant tone of a fish-woman fell upon my ear. I saw that she\r\n     bore a heavy tub upon her head, evidently seeking by this branch\r\n     of merchandise to procure a living for herself and family. So few\r\n     were the avenues open to her, as she thought, and so much had men\r\n     monopolized the places she could fill, that she was compelled to\r\n     carry fish on her head, until she could raise money enough to\r\n     procure a better conveyance.\r\n\r\n     Again, I see young men selling artificial flowers, and laces and\r\n     embroidery, crinolines and balmorals, and I think to myself they\r\n     had better be out digging coal or making brick. When I go back\r\n     home to the West, I could take a car-load with me, and set them\r\n     to work, and I would greatly benefit their condition, while the\r\n     places they vacate here might be filled by the girls who are now\r\n     starving in your garrets. (Applause). At a shoe-store, instead of\r\n     finding a sprightly miss, to select and fit the ladies gaiters,\r\n     you often see a strong, healthy man, kneeling before the customer\r\n     with a gallantry that would be admirable in a drawing-room, and\r\n     worth infinitely more than the price of the article he is\r\n     selling; and he fusses over the gaiters and over the lady's foot,\r\n     until you wonder if she is not tempted to propel him into a more\r\n     appropriate sphere. (Laughter). Whatever possessed men to imagine\r\n     that God designed them to fit ladies' gaiters, is more than I can\r\n     imagine. (Applause). I am unable to realize how they obtained the\r\n     revelation that for a woman to thus officiate would take her out\r\n     of her appropriate sphere. Shall I be held to my principles here,\r\n     and told that these men succeed in business, and success being\r\n     the test of sphere, therefore they are in their place? It remains\r\n     to be proved that they have succeeded. A man may jump Jim Crow\r\n     from morning till night, or make a fool of himself in any other\r\n     way, and succeed admirably in pleasing auditors and gathering\r\n     pennies; but when you take into consideration his high and\r\n     heavenly origin, and the noble purposes for which he was made,\r\n     you can hardly call it a success. Neither should I think a woman\r\n     was in suitable business, even if it were ever so lucrative and\r\n     well done, unless that business developed her talents; made her\r\n     stronger, more self-reliant, and better fitted her for life and\r\n     its duties. These stores would be a good discipline for young\r\n     girls, but not for men.\r\n\r\n     This whole question lies in a small compass. Our reform would\r\n     leave woman just where God placed her--a moral, accountable\r\n     being, endowed with talents whose scope and character indicate\r\n     the work she is to do; and who is responsible primarily to her\r\n     Creator for the use she makes of those talents. He says to every\r\n     man and to every woman, Go work in my vineyard! That vineyard I\r\n     understand to be the world, embracing all the varied\r\n     responsibilities of life. Whether man shall pursue science,\r\n     literature, or art, whether he shall engage in agriculture,\r\n     manufactures, or mechanics, is for _him_ to determine, and\r\n     whether woman shall engage in any of these things is for _her_ to\r\n     determine. Nothing but an internal consciousness of power to\r\n     perform certain work, and that it will be for her own good, can\r\n     aid her in her choice. If a woman can write vigorous verse, then\r\n     let her write verse. If she can build ships, then let her be a\r\n     ship-builder. I know no reason why. If she can keep house, and\r\n     that takes as much brains as any other occupation, let her be a\r\n     housekeeper. They tell us that \"eternal vigilance is the price of\r\n     liberty\"; eternal vigilance is the price of a well-ordered home,\r\n     and every woman before me knows it. (Applause). I know that the\r\n     conservative, in his fear, says, Surely you would not have woman\r\n     till the soil, sail the seas, run up the rigging of a ship like a\r\n     monkey (I use the language of one of your most distinguished\r\n     men), go to war, engage in political brawls? No! I would not have\r\n     her do anything. She must be her own judge. In relation to\r\n     tilling the soil, the last census of the United Kingdom reports\r\n     128,418 women employed in agriculture. Examples are by no means\r\n     rare where a woman carries on a farm which her deceased husband\r\n     has left, and I have, seen much skill evinced in the management.\r\n     \"In Media, Pa., two girls named Miller carry on a farm of 300\r\n     acres, raising hay and grain, hiring labor, but working mostly\r\n     themselves.\" I have been on a farm in your own State where I saw,\r\n     not Tennyson's six mighty daughters of the plow, but I saw\r\n     three[166] who plowed, and not only that, but they plowed well.\r\n     Doubtless, some of our fastidious young ladies would be greatly\r\n     shocked at such an exhibition, and I must acknowledge that it was\r\n     to me a novel sight; but the more I considered it, the more I\r\n     thought that I would rather see a young woman holding the plow,\r\n     than to see her leading such an aimless, silly life as many a\r\n     young lady leads. I would rather see a young woman holding the\r\n     plow, than to see her decked out in her finery, and sitting idle\r\n     in the parlor, waiting for an offer of marriage. (Applause). I\r\n     hope women will not copy the vices of men. I hope they will not\r\n     go to war; I wish men would not. I hope they will not be\r\n     contentious politicians; I am sorry that men are. I hope they\r\n     will not regard their freedom as a license to do wrong; I am\r\n     ashamed to acknowledge that men do. But we need not fear. We may\r\n     safely trust the judgment of those who tell us that politics and\r\n     morals, and every department into which woman may enter, will be\r\n     elevated and refined by her influence.\r\n\r\n     So far as navigation is concerned, I think many women would not\r\n     be attracted to that life. There might be now and then a Betsy\r\n     Miller, who could walk the quarter-deck in a gale, and that\r\n     certainly would indicate constitutional ability to become a\r\n     sailor. I do not suppose so much violence would be done to her\r\n     nature by navigating the seas, as by helping a drunken husband to\r\n     navigate the streets habitually. (Applause). In relation to\r\n     running up the rigging like a monkey, or in regard to any other\r\n     monkey performance, I do not believe that women will ever enter\r\n     into competition with men in these things, because the latter\r\n     have shown such remarkable aptitude for that business. (Laughter\r\n     and applause). But after all that may be said on this subject, we\r\n     fail to reach one class in the community who have spare time,\r\n     spare energies, abundance of power for work. I mean young ladies\r\n     of wealth and rank. The world shows a degree of toleration now\r\n     toward any young woman who from necessity has engaged in any\r\n     industrial avocation to which women have not heretofore applied\r\n     themselves. But there is no such toleration for the rich. Many of\r\n     these are now striving to kill time with fancy-work and fiction,\r\n     with flirtation and flaunting. Some are destitute of aspiration\r\n     for anything better. These could be moved only by some convulsion\r\n     in the social system, like the earthquake, or like the volcano\r\n     that opens the ground at our feet and shows us our danger. But\r\n     there are others whose convictions lead them to desire something\r\n     better; who feel that they are living to no purpose; who know\r\n     that their own powers, good as any God ever created, are lying in\r\n     inglorious repose. Some of the advocates of our cause have said\r\n     that for these there is no profession but marriage. If they are\r\n     not literary, artistic, or philanthropic, what can they do? They\r\n     are held by a cable, made up of home influence, of fashion, and\r\n     of perverted Scripture, which binds them down to an insipid\r\n     existence. Hence, they suppress all desire for a fuller, larger\r\n     life; they smile graciously upon their fetters; they profess to\r\n     be the happiest of all happy women, and thus they glide along\r\n     through the thoroughfares of society with a lying tongue and an\r\n     aching heart.\r\n\r\n     I wish these had enough vitality of soul and enough energy of\r\n     character to rise superior to the circumstances around them, and\r\n     make some approach to their own ideal. I know this is asking them\r\n     to martyrize themselves. But could they see the beauty and the\r\n     glory that will invest the future woman, when she shall have her\r\n     proper place among the children of the Father; when she shall\r\n     infuse her love, her moral perceptions, her sense of justice,\r\n     into the ethics and governments of the earth; when she shall be\r\n     united to man in a Divine harmony, and her children shall go\r\n     forth to bless all coming generations, they would regard\r\n     martyrdom but dust in the balance compared with such blessing.\r\n     And when the world shall see the moral grandeur, the sublime\r\n     position of a race redeemed by the sanctifying influences of this\r\n     Divine harmony, it will weave for them a brighter chaplet than it\r\n     has ever woven for any of its martyrs who have suffered at the\r\n     stake. (Loud applause).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Rev. BERIAH GREEN, of Whitesboro', N. Y., was next introduced,\r\n     and said:\r\n\r\n     It is not, I suppose, at all the design of this platform in any\r\n     way to abolish what the grammarians call \"the distinction of\r\n     sex\"; and when we speak of \"woman's rights,\" we admit, in the\r\n     very language which is thus employed, that she is a \"woman\"--that\r\n     that is appropriately her character--that under this name she is\r\n     fitly described. Now, a comprehensive description of all the\r\n     rights which any member of the human family, whoever and whatever\r\n     and wherever he may be, is entitled to challenge and maintain, we\r\n     have in the brief and simple expression, the right to be himself;\r\n     the right to be true to the nature which he has inherited; the\r\n     right to the free and full development of the powers with which\r\n     he is endowed; the right to lay out those resources of which he\r\n     is constructed happily, effectively, properly; the right to rise\r\n     to the highest position in excellence and in blessedness to which\r\n     his capacities and powers may elevate him. This is a\r\n     comprehensive description of man's rights, a comprehensive\r\n     description of woman's rights, and a comprehensive description of\r\n     human rights, under every form and phase of application of which\r\n     human rights may be supposed capable.\r\n\r\n     Now, I regard it as a repulsive feature of the age, that one sex\r\n     should feel itself constrained to come forward and defend itself\r\n     from the other sex; to demand a redress of the wrongs to which it\r\n     may be exposed, and a vindication of the rights to which it may\r\n     be entitled; for, look you! most obviously and clearly, the\r\n     relation between the sexes is naturally most intimate. The one\r\n     lives in and through the other. They do not make two distinct\r\n     classes, most obviously and certainly. They do not in nature;\r\n     they do not according to the Divine arrangement; and it always\r\n     seems to me to be most absurd, and in the highest degree\r\n     ungrateful, to present the subject with which we are now\r\n     occupied, under any such aspect. Mankind are divided,\r\n     doubtless--divided now by accident, and now by arrangement--into\r\n     different classes; but to make the women one class, and the men\r\n     another class, seems to me to be essentially and flagrantly\r\n     absurd. (Applause). Manifestly, the grand right of man (employing\r\n     the term man here not generally, but specifically), in his\r\n     relations to woman, as well as in all his other relations, is to\r\n     be grandly, vigorously beautiful; in every way a man; in all the\r\n     relations of life to be true to whatever may be characteristic of\r\n     his nature, and to whatever may be distinctive in his sex. And\r\n     what may be affirmed of him in this respect may be affirmed of\r\n     his mother, of his wife, of his sister.\r\n\r\n     It is a general law of our humanity, an all-comprehensive and all\r\n     controlling principle, that we belong, as human beings, to each\r\n     other. Every man belongs to the whole human family, and the whole\r\n     human family belongs to every one of its members. We are\r\n     mutually, as a matter of course, under the controlling influence\r\n     of this great law; we are mutually to contribute, as effectively\r\n     and wisely as we may, to each other's improvement and welfare.\r\n     This is the great general law which lies at the very basis of our\r\n     being; this is the law which asserts its majesty in the depths of\r\n     our consciousness. This law has manifestly a specific and\r\n     beneficent application to the relation which binds man to woman,\r\n     and unites woman to man. In a natural state of things, where the\r\n     ordinances of our true Father were regarded, where the principles\r\n     of our existence were reverently heeded, as a matter of course,\r\n     individually and generally, man would devote himself, as man,\r\n     generously, magnanimously, his entire self, whatever belongs to\r\n     his manhood, in every department of his being--he would devote\r\n     himself, as man, to woman; and woman, on the other hand, would\r\n     just as characteristically, just as nobly, just as cheerfully,\r\n     just as gratefully, just as effectively, devote herself to the\r\n     improvement and welfare of man; and according to the nature of\r\n     the relation which unites them, the one would supply whatever\r\n     might seem to be demanded in the construction of the other. A man\r\n     is never completely himself until he is united to woman, and a\r\n     woman is never completely herself until she is united to man; and\r\n     thus they become a beautiful unit, playing continually into each\r\n     other's hands, their hearts beating in delightful harmony with\r\n     each other. This is the great fundamental law of our social\r\n     existence. The very germ of the social is to be found in the\r\n     sexual relations which bind men and women together, and society,\r\n     in all its forms and phases, is nothing under heaven but the\r\n     development, the fit, symmetrical, and full development of the\r\n     germ to which I have thus referred.\r\n\r\n     As has already been intimated in the beautiful thoughts which\r\n     have been expressed by those who have preceded me, the great law,\r\n     which was, perhaps, as intelligibly and impressively presented by\r\n     Napoleon as by any other man, giving liberty to every man to use\r\n     the tools who is qualified to use them--\"The tools to him who can\r\n     use them!\"--or, in better language still, as it fell from the\r\n     lips of the Great Teacher, \"Every man according to his\r\n     ability\"--this great law applies with equal force to woman as to\r\n     man. There have been women greatly distinguished for physical\r\n     power. You remember the old story of Kate Guardinier. A\r\n     distinguished wrestler, who came to lay hold of her brother, her\r\n     muscular and gigantic brother, and measure strength with him,\r\n     found that he was absent. \"Well,\" says Kate, \"I will wrestle with\r\n     you, and if I throw you, you need not wait the return of my\r\n     brother.\" And so she did, and he went away, fully satisfied that\r\n     there was no occasion for him, to wait for any more vigorous arm\r\n     than Kate Guardinier wielded. Now, wherever there is a strong\r\n     arm, adapt its task to its powers--that is the will of High\r\n     Heaven. Wherever there are well-trained powers, let these be\r\n     recognized powers, and of course the general results can not be\r\n     otherwise than happy.\r\n\r\n     In regard to the great question who shall take the lead in the\r\n     family or the community, let me say, that I do not care through\r\n     what medium wisdom may reach me, through what medium I may secure\r\n     the benefit of healthful guidance. What I want is wisdom. Wisdom,\r\n     goodness, and power are the soul of all government. Wherever\r\n     these are combined, there you have the results of wisdom,\r\n     goodness, and power. Now, then, if the mother in a household, or\r\n     even if a daughter in a household, is more distinguished for\r\n     these high qualities, for these grand attainments, than any other\r\n     member of that family, why, it is nothing but rebellion against\r\n     God, it is nothing but gibbering madness, that would make any\r\n     member of that family hesitate to avail himself of the guidance\r\n     thus offered, of the light of the wisdom which may thus be poured\r\n     around him. In God's name, give me wisdom, give me genuine power,\r\n     give me magnanimity!--as to the incidents of the matter, I do not\r\n     insist upon them. Whether it be through my father or my mother\r\n     that true guidance is afforded, whether it be by my wife or my\r\n     daughter that good counsel is offered, very clearly, to reject\r\n     these is to spurn the kindness of benignant Heaven.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     WENDELL PHILLIPS said:--We are here to enforce, on the\r\n     consideration of the civil state, those elements of power which\r\n     have already made the social state. You do not find it necessary\r\n     to-day to say to a husband, \"Your wife has a right to read\"; or\r\n     necessary to say to Dickens, \"You have as many women over your\r\n     pages as men.\" You do not find it necessary to say to the male\r\n     members of a church that the women members have a right to change\r\n     their creed. All that is settled; nobody contests it. If a man\r\n     stood up here and said, \"I am a Calvinist, and therefore my wife\r\n     is bound to be one,\" you would send him to a lunatic asylum. You\r\n     would say, \"Poor man! don't judge him by what he says; he don't\r\n     mean it.\" But law is halting back just where that old\r\n     civilization was; we want to change it.\r\n\r\n     We are not doing anything new. There is no fanaticism about it.\r\n     We are merely extending the area of liberty--nothing else. We\r\n     have made great progress. The law passed at the last session of\r\n     the New York Legislature grants, in fact, the whole question. The\r\n     moment you grant us anything, we have gained the whole. You can\r\n     not stop with an inconsistent statute-book. A man is uneasy who\r\n     is inconsistent. As Thomas Fuller says, \"You can not make one\r\n     side of the face laugh, and the other cry!\" You can not have\r\n     one-half your statute-book Jewish, and the other Christian;\r\n     one-half of the statute-book Oriental, the other Saxon. You have\r\n     granted that woman may be hung, therefore you must grant that\r\n     woman may vote. You have granted that she may be taxed,\r\n     therefore, on republican principles, you must grant that she\r\n     ought to have a voice in fixing the laws of taxation--and this\r\n     is, in fact, all that we claim--the whole of it.\r\n\r\n     Now, I want to consider some of the objections that are made to\r\n     this claim. Men say, \"Woman is not fit to vote; she does not know\r\n     enough; she has not sense enough to vote.\" I take this idea of\r\n     the ballot as the Gibraltar of our claim, for this reason,\r\n     because I am speaking in a democracy; I am speaking under\r\n     republican institutions. The rule of despotism is that one class\r\n     is made to protect the other; that the rich, the noble, the\r\n     educated are a sort of probate court, to take care of the poor,\r\n     the ignorant, and the common classes. Our fathers got rid of all\r\n     that. They knocked it on the head by the simple principle, that\r\n     no class is safe, unless government is so arranged that each\r\n     class has in its own hands the means of protecting itself. That\r\n     is the idea of republics. The Briton says to the poor man, \"Be\r\n     content; I am worth five millions, and I will protect you.\" And\r\n     America says, \"Thank you, sir; I had rather take care of\r\n     myself!\"--and that is the essence of democracy. (Applause). It is\r\n     the corner-stone of progress, also; because, the moment you have\r\n     admitted that poor ignorant heart as an element of the\r\n     government, able to mold your institutions, those five millions\r\n     of dollars, feeling that their cradle is not safe and their life\r\n     is in peril, unless that heart is bulwarked with education and\r\n     informed with morality, selfishness dictates that wealth and\r\n     education should do its utmost to educate poverty and hold up\r\n     weakness--and that is the philosophy of democratic institutions.\r\n     (Applause). I am speaking in a republic which admits the\r\n     principle that the poor are not to be protected by the rich, but\r\n     to have the means of protecting themselves. So, too, the\r\n     ignorant; so, too, races. The Irish are not to trust to the sense\r\n     of justice in the Saxon; the German is not to trust to the\r\n     native-born citizen; the Catholic is not to trust to the\r\n     Protestant; but all sects, all classes, are to hold in their own\r\n     hands the scepter--the American scepter--of the ballot, which\r\n     protects each class. We claim it, therefore, for woman. The reply\r\n     is, that woman has not got sense enough. If she has not, so much\r\n     the more shame for your public-schools--educate her! For you will\r\n     not say that woman naturally has not mind enough. If God did not\r\n     give her mind enough, then you are brutes, for you say to her:\r\n     \"Madam, you have sense enough to earn your own living--don't come\r\n     to us!\" You make her earn her own bread, and, if she has sense\r\n     enough to do that, she has enough to say whether Fernando Wood or\r\n     Governor Morgan shall take one cent out of every hundred to pay\r\n     for fireworks. When you hold her up in both hands, and say, \"Let\r\n     me work for you! Don't move one of your dainty fingers! We will\r\n     pour wealth into your lap, and be ye clothed in satin and velvet,\r\n     every daughter of Eve!\"--then you will be consistent in saying\r\n     that woman has not sense enough to vote. But if she has sense\r\n     enough to work, to depend for her bread on her work, she has\r\n     sense enough to vote....\r\n\r\n     But men say it would be very indelicate for woman to go to the\r\n     ballot-box or sit in the Legislature. Well, what would she see\r\n     there? Why, she would see men. (Laughter). She sees men now. In\r\n     \"Cranford Village,\" that sweet little sketch by Mrs. Gaskill, one\r\n     of the characters says, \"I know these men--my father was a man.\"\r\n     (Laughter). I think every woman can say the same. She meets men\r\n     now; she could meet nothing but men at the ballot-box, or, if she\r\n     meets brutes, they ought not to be there. (Applause). Indelicate\r\n     for her to go to the ballot-box!--but you may walk up and down\r\n     Broadway any time from nine o'clock in the morning until nine at\r\n     night, and you will find about equal numbers of men and women\r\n     crowding that thoroughfare, which is never still. You may get\r\n     into an omnibus--women are there, crowding us out, sometimes.\r\n     (Laughter). You can not go into a theater without being crowded\r\n     to death by two women to one man. If you go to the lyceum, woman\r\n     is there. I have stood on this very platform, and seen as many\r\n     women as men before me, and one time, at least, when they could\r\n     not have met any worse men at the ballot-box than they met in\r\n     this hall. (Laughter and applause). You may go to church, and you\r\n     will find her facing men of all classes--ignorant and wise,\r\n     saints and sinners. I do not know anywhere that woman is not. It\r\n     is too late now to say that she can not go to the ballot-box. Go\r\n     back to Turkey, and shut her up in a harem; go back to Greece,\r\n     and shut her up in the private apartments of women; go back to\r\n     the old Oriental phases of civilization, that never allowed\r\n     woman's eyes to light a man's pathway, unless he owned her, and\r\n     you are consistent; but you see, we have broken down the bulwark,\r\n     centuries ago. You know they used to let a man be hung in public,\r\n     and said that it was for the sake of the example. They got\r\n     ashamed of it, and banished the gallows to the jail-yard, and\r\n     allowed only twelve men to witness an execution. It is too late\r\n     to say that you hang men for the example, because the example you\r\n     are ashamed to have public can not be a wholesome example. So it\r\n     is with this question of woman. You have granted so much, that\r\n     you have left yourselves no ground to stand on. My dear, delicate\r\n     friend, you are out of your sphere; you ought to be in Turkey. My\r\n     dear, religiously, scrupulously fashionable, exquisitely anxious\r\n     hearer, fearful lest your wife, or daughter, or sister shall be\r\n     sullied by looking into your neighbors' faces at the ballot-box,\r\n     you do not belong to the century that has ballot-boxes. You\r\n     belong to the century of Tamerlane and Timour the Tartar; you\r\n     belong to China, where the women have no feet, because it is not\r\n     meant that they shall walk. You belong anywhere but in America;\r\n     and if you want an answer, walk down Broadway, and meet a hundred\r\n     thousand petticoats, and they are a hundred thousand answers; for\r\n     if woman can walk the streets, she can go to the ballot-box, and\r\n     any reason of indelicacy that forbids the one covers the other.\r\n\r\n     Men say, \"Why do you come here? What good are you going to do?\r\n     You do nothing but talk.\" Oh, yes, we have done a great deal\r\n     besides talk! But suppose we had done nothing but talk? I saw a\r\n     poor man the other day, and said he (speaking of a certain period\r\n     in his life), \"I felt very friendless and alone--I had only God\r\n     with me\"; and he seemed to think that was not much. And so thirty\r\n     millions of thinking, reading people are constantly throwing it\r\n     in the teeth of reformers that they rely upon talk! What is talk?\r\n     Why, it is the representative of brains. And what is the\r\n     characteristic glory of the nineteenth century? That it is ruled\r\n     by brains, and not by muscle; that rifles are gone by, and ideas\r\n     have come in; and, of course, in such an era, talk is the\r\n     fountain-head of all things. But we have done a great deal. In\r\n     the first place, you will meet dozens of men who say, \"Oh,\r\n     woman's right to property, the right of the wife to her own\r\n     earnings, we grant that; we always thought that; we have had that\r\n     idea for a dozen years.\" I met a man the other day in the cars,\r\n     and we read the statute of your New York Legislature. \"Why,\" said\r\n     he, \"that is nothing; I have assented to that for these fifteen\r\n     years.\" All I could say to that was this: \"This agitation has\r\n     either given you the idea, or it has given you the courage to\r\n     utter it, for nobody ever heard it from you until to-day.\" ...\r\n\r\n     What do we toil for? Why, my friends, I do not care much whether\r\n     a woman actually goes to the ballot-box and votes--that is a\r\n     slight matter; and I shall not wait, either, to know whether\r\n     every woman in this audience wants to vote. Some of you were\r\n     saying to-day, in these very seats, coming here out of mere\r\n     curiosity, to see what certain fanatics could find to say, \"Why,\r\n     I don't want any more rights; I have got rights enough.\" Many a\r\n     lady, whose husband is what he ought to be, whose father is what\r\n     fathers ought to be, feeling no want unsupplied, is ready to say,\r\n     \"I have all the rights I want.\" So the daughter of Louis\r\n     Sixteenth, in the troublous time of 1791, when somebody told her\r\n     that the people were starving in the streets of Paris, exclaimed,\r\n     \"What fools! I would eat bread first!\" Thus wealth, comfort, and\r\n     ease say, \"I have rights enough.\" Nobody doubted it, madam! But\r\n     the question is not of you; the question is of some houseless\r\n     wife of a drunkard; the question is of some ground-down daughter\r\n     of toil, whose earnings are filched from her by the rum debts of\r\n     a selfishness which the law makes to have a right over her, in\r\n     the person of a husband. The question is not of you, it is of\r\n     some friendless woman of twenty, standing at the door of the\r\n     world, educated, capable, desirous of serving her time and her\r\n     race, and saying, \"Where shall I use these talents? How shall I\r\n     earn bread?\" And orthodox society, cabined and cribbed in St.\r\n     Paul, cries out, \"Go sew, jade! We have no other channel for you.\r\n     Go to the needle, or wear yourself to death as a\r\n     school-mistress.\" We come here to endeavor to convince you, and\r\n     so to shape our institutions that public opinion, following in\r\n     the wake, shall be willing to open channels for the agreeable and\r\n     profitable occupation of women as much as for men. People blame\r\n     the shirt-makers and tailors because they pay two cents where\r\n     they ought to pay fifty. It is not their fault. They are nothing\r\n     but the weathercocks, and society is the wind. Trade does not\r\n     grow out of the Sermon on the Mount; merchants never have any\r\n     hearts, they have only ledgers; two per cent. a month is their\r\n     Sermon on the Mount, and a balance on the wrong side of the\r\n     ledger is their demonstration. (Laughter). Nobody finds fault\r\n     with them for it. Everything according to the law of its life. A\r\n     man pays as much for making shirts or coats as it is necessary to\r\n     pay, and he would be a fool and a bankrupt if he paid any more.\r\n     He needs only a hundred workwomen; there are a thousand women\r\n     standing at his door saying, \"Give us work; and if it is worth\r\n     ten cents to do it, we will do it for two\"; and a hundred get the\r\n     work, and nine hundred are turned into the street, to drag down\r\n     this city into the pit that it deserves. (Loud applause).\r\n\r\n     Now, what is the remedy? To take that tailor by the throat, and\r\n     gibbet him in _The New York Tribune_? Not at all; it does the\r\n     women no good, and he does not deserve it. I will tell you what\r\n     is to be done. Behind the door at which those women stand asking\r\n     for work, on one side stands an orthodox disciple of St. Paul,\r\n     and on the other a dainty exquisite; and the one says, it is not\r\n     religious, and the other says, it is not fashionable, for woman\r\n     to be anything but a drudge. Now, strangle the one in his own\r\n     creed, and smother the other in his own perfumes, and give to\r\n     those thousand women freedom to toil. Let public opinion only\r\n     grant that, like their thousand brothers, those thousand women\r\n     may go out, and wherever they find work to do, do it, without a\r\n     stigma being set upon them. Let the educated girl of twenty have\r\n     the same liberty to use the pen, to practice law, to write\r\n     books, to attend the telegraph, to go into the artist's studio,\r\n     to serve in a library, to tend in a gallery of art, to do\r\n     anything that her brother can do. St. Paul is dead and rotten,\r\n     and ought to be forgotten--(Applause, laughter, and a few\r\n     hisses)--so far as this doctrine goes, mark you! for his is the\r\n     noblest figure in all history, except that of Christ, the\r\n     broadest and most masterly intellect of any age; but he was a Jew\r\n     and not a Christian; he lived under Jewish civilization and not\r\n     ours, and was speaking by his own light, and not by inspiration\r\n     of God.\r\n\r\n     This is all we claim; and we claim the ballot for this reason;\r\n     the moment you give woman power, that moment men will see to it\r\n     that she has the way cleared for her. There are two sources of\r\n     power: one is civil, the ballot; the other is physical, the\r\n     rifle. I do not believe that the upper classes--education,\r\n     wealth, aristocracy, conservatism--the men that are in--ever\r\n     yielded, except to fear. I think the history of the race shows\r\n     that the upper classes never granted a privilege to the lower out\r\n     of love. As Jeremy Bentham says, \"The upper classes never yielded\r\n     a privilege without being bullied out of it.\" When man rises in\r\n     revolution, with the sword in his right hand, trembling wealth\r\n     and conservatism say, \"What do you want? Take it; but grant me my\r\n     life.\" The Duke of Tuscany, Elizabeth Barrett Browning has told\r\n     us, swore to a dozen constitutions when the Tuscans stood armed\r\n     in the streets of Florence, and he forgot them when the Austrians\r\n     came in and took the rifles out of the Tuscans' hands. You must\r\n     force the upper classes to do justice by physical or some other\r\n     power. The age of physical power is gone, and we want to put\r\n     ballots into the hands of women....\r\n\r\n     Political economy puts in every man's hand, by the labor of half\r\n     a day, money enough to be drunk a week. There is one temptation,\r\n     dragging down the possibility of self-government into the pit of\r\n     imbruted humanity; and on the other side, is that hideous problem\r\n     of modern civilized life--prostitution--born of orthodox scruples\r\n     and aristocratic fastidiousness--born of that fastidious denial\r\n     of the right of woman to choose her own work, and, like her\r\n     brother, to satiate her ambition, her love of luxury, her love of\r\n     material gratifications, by fair wages for fair work. As long as\r\n     you deny it, as long as the pulpit covers with its fastidious\r\n     orthodoxy this question from the consideration of the public, it\r\n     is but a concealed brothel, although it calls itself an orthodox\r\n     pulpit. (Applause and hisses). I know what I say; your hisses can\r\n     not change it. Go, clean out the Gehenna of New York! (Applause).\r\n     Go, sweep the Augean stable that makes New York the lazar-house\r\n     of corruption! You know that on one side or the other of these\r\n     temptations lies very much of the evil of modern civilized life.\r\n     You know that before them, statesmanship folds its hands in\r\n     despair. Here is a method by which to take care of at least one.\r\n     Give men fair wages, and ninety-nine out of a hundred will\r\n     disdain to steal. The way to prevent dishonesty is to let every\r\n     man have a field for his work, and honest wages; the way to\r\n     prevent licentiousness is to give to woman's capacity free play.\r\n     Give to the higher powers activity, and they will choke down the\r\n     animal. The man who loves thinking, disdains to be the victim of\r\n     appetite. It is a law of our nature. Give a hundred women honest\r\n     wages for capacity and toil, and ninety-nine out of the hundred\r\n     will disdain to win it by vice. _That_ is a cure for\r\n     licentiousness. (Applause).\r\n\r\n     I wish to put into our civil life the element of woman's right to\r\n     shape the laws, for all our social life copies largely from the\r\n     statute-book. Let woman dictate at the capital, let her say to\r\n     Wall Street, \"My votes on finance are to make stocks rise and\r\n     fall,\" and Wall Street will say to Columbia College, \"Open your\r\n     classes to woman; it needs be that she should learn.\" The moment\r\n     you give her the ballot, you take bonds of wealth and fashion and\r\n     conservatism, that they will educate this power, which is holding\r\n     their interest in its right hand. I want to spike the gun of\r\n     selfishness; or rather, I want to double-shot the cannon of\r\n     selfishness. Let Wall Street say, \"Look you! whether the New York\r\n     Central stock shall have a toll placed upon it, whether my\r\n     million shares shall be worth sixty cents in the market or\r\n     eighty, depends upon whether certain women up there at Albany\r\n     know the laws of trade and the secrets of political economy\"--and\r\n     Wall Street will say, \"Get out of the way, Dr. Adams!--absent\r\n     yourself, Dr. Spring!--we don't care for Jewish prejudices; these\r\n     women must have education!\" (Loud applause). Show me the\r\n     necessity in civil life, and I will find you forty thousand\r\n     pulpits that will say St. Paul meant just that. (Renewed\r\n     applause). Now, I am orthodox; I believe in the Bible; I\r\n     reverence St. Paul; I believe his was the most masterly intellect\r\n     that God ever gave to the race; I believe he was the connecting\r\n     link, the bridge, by which the Asiatic and European mind were\r\n     joined; I believe that Plato ministers at his feet; but, after\r\n     all, he was a man, and not God. (Applause). He was limited, and\r\n     made mistakes. You can not anchor this western continent to the\r\n     Jewish footstool of St. Paul; and, after all, that is the\r\n     difficulty--religious prejudice. It is not fashion--we shall beat\r\n     it; it is not the fastidiousness of the exquisite--we shall\r\n     smother it; it is the religious prejudice, borrowed from a\r\n     mistaken interpretation of the New Testament. That is the real\r\n     Gibraltar with which we are to grapple, and my argument with that\r\n     is simply this: You left it when you founded a republic; you left\r\n     it when you inaugurated Western civilization; we must grow out of\r\n     one root.\r\n\r\n     Let me, in closing, show you, by one single anecdote, how mean a\r\n     thing a man can be. You have heard of Mrs. Norton, \"the woman\r\n     Byron,\" as critics call her--the granddaughter of Sheridan, and\r\n     the one on whose shoulders his mantle has rested--a genius by\r\n     right of inheritance and by God's own gift. Perhaps you may\r\n     remember that when the Tories wanted to break down the reform\r\n     administration of Lord Melbourne, they brought her husband to\r\n     feign to believe his wife unfaithful, and to sue her before a\r\n     jury. He did so, brought an action, and an English jury said she\r\n     was innocent; and his own counsel has since admitted, in writing,\r\n     under his own signature, that during the time he prosecuted that\r\n     trial, the Honorable Mr. Norton (for so he is in the Herald's\r\n     Book) confessed all the time that he did not believe a word\r\n     against his wife, and knew she was innocent. She is a writer. The\r\n     profits of her books, by the law of England, belong to her\r\n     husband. She has not lived with him--of course not, for she is a\r\n     woman!--since that trial; but the brute goes every six months to\r\n     John Murray, and eats the profits of the brain of the wife whom\r\n     he tried to disgrace. (Loud cries of \"shame,\" \"shame\"). And the\r\n     law of England says it is right; the orthodox pulpit says, \"If\r\n     you change it, it will be the pulling down of the stars and St.\r\n     Paul.\" I do not believe that the Honorable Mr. Norton is half as\r\n     near to the mind of St. Paul as the Honorable Mrs. Norton. I go,\r\n     therefore, for woman having her right to her brain, to her hands,\r\n     to her toil, to her ballot. \"The tools to him that can use\r\n     them\"--and let God settle the rest. If He made it just that we\r\n     should have democratic institutions, then He made it just that\r\n     everybody who is to suffer under the law should have a voice in\r\n     making it; and if it is indelicate for woman to vote, then let\r\n     Him stop making women (applause and laughter), because\r\n     republicanism and such women are not consistent. I say it\r\n     reverently; and I only say it to show you the absurdity. Why, my\r\n     dear man and woman, we are not to help God govern the world by\r\n     telling lies! He can take care of it Himself. If He made it just,\r\n     you may be certain that He saw to it that it should be delicate;\r\n     and you need not insert your little tiny roots of fastidious\r\n     delicacy into the great giant rifts of God's world--they are only\r\n     in the way. (Applause).\r\n\r\nThe first evening session was called to order at 7-1/2 o'clock. The\r\nPresident in the chair. The audience was very large, the hall being\r\nuncomfortably full, and the attention unremitting and profound. The\r\nmost excellent order was preserved; the meeting, in this respect,\r\nfurnishing a marked and gratifying contrast with the evening sessions\r\nof the last two years at Mozart Hall.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rose, from the Business Committee, presented a series of\r\nresolutions[167], which were read by Miss Anthony. Elizabeth Cady\r\nStanton was the first speaker of the evening. By particular request\r\nshe gave the same address recently delivered before the Legislature at\r\nAlbany, and was followed by Ernestine L. Rose with one of her logical\r\nand convincing arguments.\r\n\r\nSusan B. Anthony then read the following letters:\r\n\r\n                     LETTER FROM HON. GERRIT SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                             PETERBORO, _May 3, 1860_.\r\n\r\n     ELIZABETH CADY STANTON:\r\n\r\n     MY VERY DEAR COUSIN:--It is proper that one of the first letters\r\n     which I write in my new life, should be to the cousin whose views\r\n     are most in harmony with my own. I call it my new life, because I\r\n     have come up into it from the gates of death. May it prove a new\r\n     life also, in being a far better and nobler one than that which I\r\n     had hitherto lived!\r\n\r\n     I wake up with joy to see my old fellow-laborers still in their\r\n     work of honoring God, in benefiting and blessing man. Your own\r\n     zeal for truth is unabated. I see that you are still laboring to\r\n     free the slave from his chains, and woman from her social, civil,\r\n     and political disabilities; and to preserve both man and woman\r\n     from defiling and debasing themselves with intoxicating liquors\r\n     and tobacco. Precious reforms are these which have enlisted your\r\n     powers! It is true that they do not cover the whole ground of\r\n     religious duty. But it is also true that the religion, which,\r\n     like the current one, opposes or ignores them all, is spurious;\r\n     and so, too, that the religion which opposes or ignores any one\r\n     of them is always sadly defective, if not always spurious.\r\n\r\n     Please add the inclosed draft for $25 to the fund for serving the\r\n     cause of woman's rights. To no better cause can money, time, or\r\n     talents be appropriated. I am in high, health, compared with any\r\n     I have enjoyed since the succession of my frightful diseases,\r\n     begun two and a half years ago. My nerves, however, are still\r\n     weak, and most of the year 1859 is still full of confusion and\r\n     darkness to me.\r\n\r\n                         Your friend and cousin,\r\n                                                     GERRIT SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LETTER FROM FRANCIS JACKSON, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                BOSTON, _May 6, 1860_.\r\n\r\n     LUCY STONE:\r\n\r\n     DEAR FRIEND:--I intend to be at the annual meeting of the\r\n     American Anti-Slavery Society, but my engagements are such that I\r\n     shall not stop long enough in New York to attend your meeting of\r\n     Woman's Rights. I herewith inclose you $20 to help the cause\r\n     along.\r\n                                                  FRANCIS JACKSON.\r\n\r\nHon. Erastus D. Culver, of Brooklyn, New York, being present among\r\nthat portion of the audience seated upon the platform, was recognized\r\nand loudly called for, and came forward in response to the call, and\r\nspoke as follows:\r\n\r\n     Mrs. PRESIDENT, LADIES, AND GENTLEMEN:--They used to have, in old\r\n     times, in the country where I was brought up, a minister, who,\r\n     after delivering his sermon, would call upon some brother to get\r\n     up and make the application. Now, I want to give you an\r\n     application of what I have heard to-night, and there seems to be\r\n     a sort of providence in it. This very day, since I opened my\r\n     court this morning, three cases have come in review before me,\r\n     each one of them directly connected with the subject matter of\r\n     this evening's deliberations, and with the law which has been\r\n     alluded to to-night. The first was the case of a woman who had\r\n     brought a suit, in conjunction with her husband (as she had to\r\n     do, as the law was) against the city of Brooklyn, for personal\r\n     injuries, received by falling into a hole; and on the first\r\n     trial, it was found very difficult to make out the case, because\r\n     we were obliged to exclude the woman as a witness. If her husband\r\n     had fallen into that hole, and hurt his side, making him a\r\n     cripple for life, he might have brought a suit, and he would have\r\n     been by law a competent witness: but his wife was not; and as he\r\n     was not with her at the time of the accident, of course he could\r\n     not testify. To-day the case came on again, and they were making\r\n     a very poor show at proving the accident, when the lawyer for the\r\n     lady said, \"I will offer the lady as a witness.\" The other lawyer\r\n     started up (he is an old fogy, who does not keep up with the\r\n     times) and said, \"She is a party out of sight in law; in law, she\r\n     is one of the invisibles\"; when, to my great surprise and joy\r\n     (for I had lost track of it myself) the lady's lawyer pulled out\r\n     from his pocket a slip from a newspaper, which contained the\r\n     noble law of the 20th of March, 1860, and that law says that \"any\r\n     married woman may bring and maintain an action in her own name\r\n     for damages against any person or body corporate for any injury\r\n     to her person or character.\" That obviated the difficulty. The\r\n     law was handed to the opposite lawyer, and when he had read it\r\n     through, with a frown on his face, he said, ill-naturedly, \"If\r\n     your honor please, it is so; they have emancipated the women from\r\n     all obligations to their husbands.\" Now, just look at that old\r\n     presumption of the law, that a married woman could not tell the\r\n     truth, even in a matter about which she knew better than any one\r\n     else, on the ground that she was a _feme covert_, and was\r\n     _nil_--nothing!\r\n\r\n     That was one case. Another was that of a woman who made a bitter\r\n     complaint against her husband, saying that he had become a\r\n     drunkard, and was squandering her estate, and threatened to take\r\n     their two children away. I signed the writ, and the husband and\r\n     two children were brought in. He addressed the Court in his own\r\n     defence, and I have not heard such eloquence in court for many a\r\n     year. He told how he loved his wife, how devoted he was, and\r\n     that it would ruin him for ever to be separated from her. He said\r\n     to his lawyer, \"Do you keep still; I can talk better than you\r\n     can.\" \"Now,\" said he to the Court, \"I adjure you, by the feelings\r\n     of a father and a man, restore to me my wife and children! Do not\r\n     disgrace me in this way!\" All present were deeply affected, and\r\n     it seemed as if he had carried the people with him, whether he\r\n     had the Court or not. His speech sounded admirably; but I am\r\n     sorry to say, that when his wife's turn came, she had not spoken\r\n     five minutes before she had taken the wind entirely out of his\r\n     sails. \"I was married,\" she said, \"eleven years ago, and not a\r\n     fortnight after, he beat me, and left his bruises upon me. He has\r\n     pawned all my clothes, everything I have in the house has been\r\n     pledged, and I am left destitute; and here, your honor, are the\r\n     wounds upon my head, here are the bruises that he has left. I can\r\n     not live with him any longer; I can not be reconciled, until he\r\n     abjures rum and comes home resolved to live a sober life.\"\r\n     \"Well,\" said the husband's lawyer, \"we claim our paramount\r\n     rights--that the father shall have the custody of the children.\"\r\n     Then came up this very law again, and this lawyer was as much\r\n     surprised as the one to whom I first referred. There is a clause\r\n     in that law which declares that, from this time forward, there\r\n     shall be no such thing as \"paramount rights.\" It is declared in\r\n     that statute that from this day \"every married woman is\r\n     constituted and declared to be the joint guardian of her\r\n     children, with equal powers, rights, and duties in regard to\r\n     them, with her husband.\" In view of that law, I said, \"I can not\r\n     take the children away from the mother; she has just as much\r\n     right to them as her husband, and if she says she must have them,\r\n     I will let her have them.\" (Loud applause).\r\n\r\n     Now, ladies and gentlemen, I have never been identified with this\r\n     Woman's Rights movement, but I tell you what it is, we have got\r\n     to admit some things. We have got to admit that these\r\n     indefatigable laborers, amid obloquy and reproach, in Church and\r\n     State, by buffoons and by men, have at last set the under-current\r\n     in motion. The statute-book is their vindication to-night. The\r\n     last measure passed has relieved woman, to a great extent, from\r\n     the disabilities under which she was placed. I am one who\r\n     believes that she may go forward. There will come a time,\r\n     friends, when we shall see the ballot-box open, and one\r\n     particular department (as we have at the post-office) where the\r\n     ladies will all march up and vote. (Applause, and a few hisses).\r\n     Now, you men that hiss, you would like to have them help you\r\n     elect your candidate this year, wouldn't you? I wish most\r\n     sincerely that they could help elect our Republican candidate.\r\n     (Applause). There is to be a still further advance in this\r\n     matter. I do not think it at all degrading to say, that there\r\n     will come a time when ladies will sit in the jury-box, to pass\r\n     upon certain cases that come particularly within their sphere;\r\n     and I will say (now that I am off the bench) that they would make\r\n     better judges than some who are on the benches now. (Laughter and\r\n     applause).\r\n\r\n     Mrs. ROSE added: I have been most happy to hear the remarks of\r\n     Judge Culver. Who can doubt of our success, when judges, and\r\n     noble ones, too--for it is only noble ones who are ready to\r\n     identify themselves with this cause before it becomes fully\r\n     successful--come forward to endorse our movement! All we now have\r\n     to do is, to continue in the good cause, and, depend upon it, the\r\n     time will come when we shall look back to this last spring's\r\n     enactment of the Legislature, as the commencement of the real\r\n     \"good time coming.\" But we have yet some duties to perform. What\r\n     we have gained, has not been gained without labor. Freedom, my\r\n     friends, does not come from the clouds, like a meteor; it does\r\n     not bloom in one night; it does not come without great efforts\r\n     and great sacrifices; all who love liberty, have to labor for it.\r\n     We expect that from this hour, you will all help us to work out\r\n     that glorious problem, whether or not woman can govern herself\r\n     quite as well as man can govern her. Give us the elective\r\n     franchise, and we ask for no more. When we have obtained that, it\r\n     shall be our fault if we do not take all the rights we now claim.\r\n     (Applause).\r\n\r\n     ELIZABETH JONES said: The adoption of the plans now proposed\r\n     would place woman above the necessity of any mercenary marriages.\r\n     She could leave her father's home if she didn't like it, and\r\n     engage in business and support herself. Who cared for the husband\r\n     of Jenny Lind, or of Mrs. Norton? It was not necessary for\r\n     Florence Nightingale, Harriet Hosmer, or Elizabeth Blackwell to\r\n     marry to secure the world's consideration. The wife should have\r\n     equal and joint proprietorship with her husband. Two brothers,\r\n     John and Henry, go to California and form a partnership; John\r\n     cooks while Henry digs. Henry finds one day a lump of gold worth\r\n     a hundred dollars. Will he pay John fifty cents for cooking, and\r\n     take the rest himself? Of course not; he will divide with him. So\r\n     the husband should regard the property that he accumulates as\r\n     owned by his wife jointly and equally with himself. Woman would\r\n     have her rights, let man do what he might. She asked no rights\r\n     from man, for man had none to give her--none to spare from\r\n     himself. Satan promised Jesus all the kingdoms of the world, and\r\n     the glory of them, if He would fall down and worship him; but it\r\n     was well known that the poor devil had not a foot to give. And so\r\n     man could give no rights to woman. She was born with rights, and\r\n     only wanted man to recognize them. Her purpose was to demand them\r\n     persistently, or, if need be, like the Prince of Orange, die in\r\n     the last ditch before she surrendered them. (Applause).\r\n\r\nRev. Samuel Longfellow, of Brooklyn, N. Y., brother of the poet, was\r\nnext introduced, and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n     Mrs. PRESIDENT:--It might seem, that on a platform like this,\r\n     when a woman speaks, her presence is not merely a plea and an\r\n     argument, but also a proof. When a woman speaks, and speaks well,\r\n     speaks so as to interest and move and persuade men, there is no\r\n     need of any argument back of that to prove that she has the\r\n     liberty and the right, and that it is a part of her sphere to do\r\n     it. She has done it; and that of itself is the whole\r\n     argument--both premise and conclusion in one. And I think if\r\n     there were none but men present here, it would be better that\r\n     only women should speak; for there is a subtle power which God\r\n     implanted from the first in woman over man, so that the thought\r\n     of her mind and the tone of her voice are more powerful over us\r\n     than almost any man, be he eloquent as he may; but not only men\r\n     are here, but women, also; and as our friend who has just spoken\r\n     has addressed herself to men, I will address myself to women.\r\n\r\n     I have often thought that the obstacle in the way of a full\r\n     allowance and recognition of woman's right to stand side by side\r\n     with man in all the departments of life, and to add her feminine\r\n     influence and fiber twined in with man's influence and fiber, in\r\n     all things that are thought and done, that the obstacle lay more\r\n     in woman than in man. I have often thought that men were more\r\n     willing to accept these ideas and grant these claims than women\r\n     were even to make the claims for themselves; and I have no doubt\r\n     that those women who have labored, through so much difficulty,\r\n     through so much scorn and obloquy, in behalf of these simple\r\n     rights, will tell you that they have often found the greatest\r\n     opposition among their own sex.\r\n\r\n     The simple proposition which, it seems to me, includes the whole\r\n     of this matter, is, what I should call a self-evident\r\n     truth--that, in all departments of life, men and women, made from\r\n     the first to be co-mates and partners, should stand side by side,\r\n     and work hand to hand. Not because men and women are identical,\r\n     not because they are not different, but because they are\r\n     different; because each has a special quality running through the\r\n     whole organization of the man and the woman, which quality is\r\n     needed to make a complete manhood and womanhood. And then there\r\n     is another proposition, which is this: that whatever any human\r\n     being can do well, that being has a right to do, and the ability\r\n     of any person marks the sphere of that person. (\"Hear\"--\"hear\").\r\n     This, I say, I count to be strictly a self-evident proposition.\r\n     (Applause). If you want to know what the level of water is at any\r\n     particular spot upon the face of the earth, you do not force the\r\n     water up with a force-pump, you do not build a great reservoir\r\n     with high stone walls, to hold it, you simply leave it alone, and\r\n     it finds its level. So, if you want to know what is the true\r\n     sphere of man or woman, just leave the man or the woman alone,\r\n     and the natural law, and the divine law, which can not be broken,\r\n     and which are as sure in the moral and human world as they are in\r\n     the external world, will settle the matter. If you want to know,\r\n     really and sincerely, what woman's sphere is, leave her\r\n     unhampered and untrammeled, and her own powers will find that\r\n     sphere. She may make mistakes, and try, as man often does, to do\r\n     things which she can not, but the experiment will settle the\r\n     matter; and nothing can be more absurd than for man, especially,\r\n     _a priori_, to establish the limits which shall bound woman's\r\n     sphere, or for woman, as a mere matter of speculation, to debate\r\n     what her sphere shall be, since the natural laws are revealed,\r\n     not to speculation, but to action.\r\n\r\n     The obstacle to the progress of the simple ideas which underlie\r\n     this movement and to their being carried out into practice, I\r\n     take to be nothing else than this--the _vis inertiæ_ of\r\n     prejudice, the dead-weight of the customary and familiar--that\r\n     which has been; and that is simply the dead-weight which hangs\r\n     upon the wheels of every movement of reform. A thing has not not\r\n     been, it is not customary, it is strange, it disturbs our\r\n     ordinary modes of thought, and we will have nothing to do with\r\n     it. When you are driving with your carriage along the track of\r\n     the horse-railroad, your wheels run very smoothly; but if you are\r\n     obliged to turn out, it wrenches the wheels and jars your\r\n     carriage; and the deeper the ruts, the more disturbance and\r\n     trouble will you have if you are obliged to move out of them. We\r\n     all move in the ruts of habit and custom; and it disturbs and\r\n     troubles us to be asked to move out of them--to do or think\r\n     anything unusual. This _vis inertiae_ is what stands in the way,\r\n     first and most of all, of the success of this movement, of the\r\n     reception of these ideas, as of every other movement of reform.\r\n     And this dead-weight of prejudice, this _vis inertiae_ of old and\r\n     traditional thought, is concentrated in this phrase, uttered with\r\n     tones of indifference or with tones of self-satisfaction and\r\n     pride, \"I think, for my part, that woman's sphere is home.\" This\r\n     phrase you hear everywhere--in the parlors, in the streets, in\r\n     conventions, and in pulpits, and read in books--\"Woman's sphere\r\n     is home!\" (Applause). \"Well, is it not?\" some one asks among you,\r\n     perhaps. Now, I have no desire to deny that the home is for\r\n     woman, as for man, the most noble sphere of life. I am sure that\r\n     there is not one who will stand upon this platform, or speak or\r\n     write in this cause, who will deny that; not one but will declare\r\n     that they count home a sacred and noble sphere for woman, as for\r\n     man--a sphere for grand and high influence, for noble\r\n     consecration and devoted work; whether it be the simple duties of\r\n     housekeeping, which a high and cultivated soul can make beautiful\r\n     by the spirit in which they are done--or whether it be the care\r\n     of children and the training up of the youthful mind into noble\r\n     thought and preparation for noble action, which is a sphere so\r\n     high, that none of us, perhaps, know how high it is--or whether\r\n     it be as the friend and comforter, encourager and inspirer, to\r\n     all things noble in thought and grand in action, of man. But if\r\n     home be the sphere of woman--as none of us deny or doubt for a\r\n     moment--if it be a sphere for woman high and noble, and to some\r\n     altogether sufficient to bound their capacities and bound their\r\n     desires, it is also a sphere for man--a sphere which he\r\n     altogether too much neglects, not knowing how high and noble it\r\n     is, and that his duty lies at home, however much he ignores it,\r\n     with his wife and with his children. But when it is said that\r\n     home is woman's only sphere--and that is what is meant--it is\r\n     simply a mistake; it is simply a narrow statement. Take the very\r\n     woman who says this. As she passes along the street, she sees a\r\n     placard for a Woman's Rights meeting, and with scornful lip she\r\n     says, \"I think woman's sphere is home\"--and goes promenading up\r\n     and down the street to meet acquaintances, and spends all the\r\n     morning in shopping--because woman's sphere is home! (Applause\r\n     and laughter). And after dinner, she says to her husband, \"Where\r\n     shall we go this evening?\" \"I think we will go to the opera,\" he\r\n     says; and so she leaves the children with the servant, and spends\r\n     half the night at the opera, because woman's sphere is home!\r\n     (Laughter). On Sunday she goes to church morning and evening,\r\n     because woman's sphere is home! and during the week goes to\r\n     concerts and lectures and balls, perhaps, because woman's sphere\r\n     is home! This is the answer to be given to all those who claim\r\n     that woman can do nothing but attend to household affairs, or to\r\n     those duties which are called especially the duties of home. No\r\n     woman attends to these utterly. No woman need neglect the duties\r\n     of home in order to fulfill duties in a wider sphere. It takes as\r\n     much time to sit and hear a lecture as to stand and deliver it;\r\n     to sit and hear a concert as to stand before the audience and\r\n     sing. There is time enough, and if one has a talent for either,\r\n     that is the sphere for him or her.\r\n\r\n     But when this claim is made that woman's sphere is at home, it is\r\n     quite forgotten how many women there are who have not imposed\r\n     upon them the cares of a home; what numbers there are who are not\r\n     at the head of families; what numbers there are who have not\r\n     these domestic ties to call upon them for effort; and it is also\r\n     forgotten how many there are who can not possibly always remain\r\n     at home, because upon their going forth depends the getting of\r\n     the money that shall provide for the wants of the home--that\r\n     shall bring the clothing and the bread that are to supply the\r\n     home's outward wants. To do this, these women must go from their\r\n     homes; and oh! hundreds and thousands of working-women in this\r\n     city are women whose sphere can not be home alone. It is upon\r\n     this ground that there is pressed home upon us the consideration\r\n     of the demands for a wider sphere of work for woman, that she\r\n     shall not be cut off from this and that means of getting a\r\n     living, which are freely opened to man, but from which woman is\r\n     excluded, through prejudices and fears. Let the wide sphere of\r\n     work be opened to woman, that she may select from it, just as man\r\n     does, whatever her strength and skill are sufficient for her to\r\n     accomplish. She is not to be shut up, it is claimed, and justly,\r\n     to a few poor, small, and wretchedly-paid employments, by which\r\n     she can, with her own hands and skill, gain a living, but is to\r\n     be allowed and encouraged to open to herself every variety of\r\n     employment wherein she shall be paid an equal sum with that which\r\n     man is paid for doing the same work; a claim which has been too\r\n     long ignored and set aside, but which will press itself until its\r\n     manifest justice shall compel its admission. The woman who has\r\n     not the care of a family is to be encouraged to expand her\r\n     powers, her talents, and genius, and to apply them to the purpose\r\n     of securing a livelihood, without any obstacle whatever being put\r\n     in the way; for when we talk of man's sphere and woman's sphere,\r\n     it is all a farce. There is no one sphere fitted for all men, any\r\n     more than for all women. Some men can not make good business men,\r\n     and must fail if they try; and some men can not possibly write\r\n     books, or preach, or speak in public, and must fail if they try.\r\n     They do not try, because they have wisdom enough to know that\r\n     they could not succeed. So it will be with women. People commonly\r\n     think, that if you grant this claim of woman's right to make her\r\n     own sphere, that all women will immediately rush into public\r\n     speaking, and be crowding to the platform, or into the pulpit, or\r\n     writing books, or carving statues, or painting pictures. There is\r\n     not the slightest danger of that. Of course, if either of these\r\n     is the true sphere of any woman, she ought to go there; but those\r\n     who have not a talent for these things will not try them.\r\n\r\n     If the right to vote was granted to woman--from which I do not\r\n     see how we can escape--I do not suppose that all women would go\r\n     to the polls, for I know that many men do not, although they have\r\n     much to say about the great privilege which every man enjoys, of\r\n     having a voice in the government, and the responsibility of a\r\n     voter. Things would remain much as now if to-morrow every\r\n     obstacle were removed from woman's path. Only gradually would the\r\n     change occur, as individual after individual found larger room\r\n     for action than that in which she is now pent. As this discussion\r\n     has been going on, woman after woman has been enlarging the\r\n     sphere allowed her. Women write admirable books, paint admirable\r\n     pictures, chisel admirable statues, make most excellent and\r\n     well-instructed physicians. Women are doing everything which it\r\n     is now claimed they have the right to do, except voting, which\r\n     they are not yet permitted to do; and I am not sure, in regard to\r\n     that, that the best plan would not be, as our Platonic friend in\r\n     New England once said, for the women to go quietly and vote,\r\n     without waiting to be asked or told that they would be permitted\r\n     to do so. To be sure, he said, their votes could not be counted,\r\n     but there they would be, and they would have their force. He\r\n     thought that the moral influence of those votes would go a great\r\n     ways, and it is quite possible that they would have that effect.\r\n     But I hope, whether in that way or some other--perhaps before\r\n     that step is taken--men will be led to see, that in the sphere of\r\n     politics, as well as in the sphere of literature and art, woman's\r\n     influence is needed; and all the objections that are made to\r\n     woman's voting are of the most trivial character, that would not\r\n     stand a day before any serious desire that she should have her\r\n     simple right in this matter, so far as she chooses to claim it.\r\n     And her right lies simply in these old propositions, so dear to\r\n     our fathers--upon which they stood and fought an eight years'\r\n     war--\"Taxation without representation is tyranny,\" and that \"all\r\n     just powers of government are derived from the consent of the\r\n     governed.\" And there is nothing in these two propositions which\r\n     confines their application to man; there is nothing in them which\r\n     does not demand that woman should be included as well as man.\r\n     Wherever woman is taxed, she has a right to vote, by this\r\n     fundamental principle of our government; and wherever she is\r\n     legislated for and governed, she is entitled to a voice in that\r\n     legislation and government.\r\n\r\n     This is a very simple matter. To-day, it is only a question of\r\n     time, when, from a matter of speculation, it will become a matter\r\n     of fact, the details of which can be managed as well as anything\r\n     in the world. Women will not be obliged to enter into a scramble\r\n     with dirty and fighting men at the polls--though it is possible,\r\n     if she went where such men are, they would be put on their good\r\n     manners, and be as well-behaved as anybody; but she could have a\r\n     separate place to vote, and go to the polls as quietly, and with\r\n     as little loss of time, as she now goes to the post-office, or\r\n     walks the streets, where rough, rude men congregate, but where\r\n     she has enough room to go and purchase her silks and satins and\r\n     laces in Broadway. (Applause). I congratulate those who, taking\r\n     an interest in this cause, espoused it when it was a great cross\r\n     to bear--who took it up with the simple courage of woman, the\r\n     patient perseverance of woman, and have carried it through as far\r\n     as it has gone now--upon the advances which it has made, upon the\r\n     opening and enlightenment of the public mind, and upon its\r\n     favorable reception, spite of all the obstacles that still\r\n     remain. I bid them be of good cheer, and remember that the great\r\n     law of progress is a law of steps; so that we must needs all be\r\n     patient, while we must also all needs be persevering. It is but a\r\n     question of time and of steps. The great psalm of human progress\r\n     is (to borrow a phrase from the Hebrew Bible) a psalm of degrees.\r\n     By patient steps man rises out of falsehood into truth, out of\r\n     wrongs into rights. So it is with woman, as a part of humanity.\r\n     Let every woman be true to this as her mission; let no woman dare\r\n     to place any obstacle or coldness in the way of this movement;\r\n     but let all calmly consider it, hear the arguments that are made,\r\n     and allow them to have their full weight; look at the simple\r\n     facts, and decide. Then we may, perhaps, all of us live to see\r\n     the day when, throughout all the spheres of his life, and all\r\n     the departments of his action, side by side with man and the\r\n     manly quality, there shall be woman and the womanly quality, and\r\n     a new Eden begin on earth. (Applause).\r\n\r\nThe President said:--Before introducing the next speaker, I want to\r\nexpress the gratitude which we women feel to Mr. Longfellow and the\r\nother gentlemen who have identified themselves with an unpopular and\r\nridiculed cause. Permit me to say one word in relation to this matter\r\nof woman's sphere. There is a lady in my neighborhood, who was\r\nspeaking to me not long since, in the most enthusiastic terms, of this\r\nrecent law that has passed through our Legislature, and of gratitude\r\ntoward Susan B. Anthony, through whose untiring exertions and\r\nexecutive ability, aided by two or three other women, this law has\r\nbeen secured. After she had expatiated for a while on this subject,\r\nher husband said, \"Miss Anthony had a great deal better have been at\r\nhome, taking care of her husband and children.\" Thank Heaven! there is\r\none woman who has leisure to care for others as well as herself.\r\n(Applause).\r\n\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton then presented a series of resolutions,[168] in\r\nsupport of which she addressed the Convention as follows:\r\n\r\n     Mrs. PRESIDENT:--In our common law, in our whole system of\r\n     jurisprudence, we find man's highest idea of right. The object of\r\n     law is to secure justice. But inasmuch as fallible man is the\r\n     maker and administrator of law, we must look for many and gross\r\n     blunders in the application of its general principles to\r\n     individual cases.\r\n\r\n     The science of theology, of civil, political, moral, and social\r\n     life, all teach the common idea, that man ever has been, and ever\r\n     must be, sacrificed to the highest good of society; the one to\r\n     the many--the poor to the rich--the weak to the powerful--and all\r\n     to the institutions of his own creation. Look, what thunderbolts\r\n     of power man has forged in the ages for his own destruction!--at\r\n     the organizations to enslave himself! And through those times of\r\n     darkness, those generations of superstition, behold all along the\r\n     relics of his power and skill, that stand like mile-stones, here\r\n     and there, to show how far back man was great and glorious! Who\r\n     can stand in those vast cathedrals of the old world, as the\r\n     deep-toned organ reverberates from arch to arch, and not feel the\r\n     grandeur of humanity? These are the workmanship of him, beneath\r\n     whose stately dome the architect himself now bows in fear and\r\n     doubt, knows not himself, and knows not God--a mere slave to\r\n     symbols--and with holy water signs the Cross, whilst He who died\r\n     thereon declared man God.\r\n\r\n     I repudiate the popular idea of man's degradation and total\r\n     depravity. I place man above all governments, all\r\n     institutions--ecclesiastical and civil--all constitutions and\r\n     laws. (Applause). It is a mistaken idea, that the same law that\r\n     oppresses the individual can promote the highest good of society.\r\n     The best interests of a community never can require the sacrifice\r\n     of one innocent being--of one sacred right. In the settlement,\r\n     then, of any question, we must simply consider the highest good\r\n     of the individual. It is the inalienable right of all to be\r\n     happy. It is the highest duty of all to seek those conditions in\r\n     life, those surroundings, which may develop what is noblest and\r\n     best, remembering that the lessons of these passing hours are not\r\n     for time alone, but for the ages of eternity. They tell us, in\r\n     that future home--the heavenly paradise--that the human family\r\n     shall be sifted out, and the good and pure shall dwell together\r\n     in peace. If that be the heavenly order, is it not our duty to\r\n     render earth as near like heaven as we may?\r\n\r\n     For years, there has been before the Legislature of this State a\r\n     variety of bills, asking for divorce in cases of drunkenness,\r\n     insanity, desertion, cruel and brutal treatment, endangering\r\n     life. My attention was called to this question very early in\r\n     life, by the sufferings of a friend of my girlhood, a victim of\r\n     one of those unfortunate unions, called marriage. What my great\r\n     love for that young girl, and my holy intuitions, then decided to\r\n     be right, has not been changed by years of experience,\r\n     observation, and reason. I have pondered well these things in my\r\n     heart, and ever felt the deepest interest in all that has been\r\n     written and said upon the subject, and the most profound respect\r\n     and loving sympathy for those heroic women, who, in the face of\r\n     law and public sentiment, have dared to sunder the unholy ties of\r\n     a joyless, loveless union.\r\n\r\n     If marriage is a human institution, about which man may\r\n     legislate, it seems but just that he should treat this branch of\r\n     his legislation with the same common-sense that he applies to all\r\n     others. If it is a mere legal contract, then should it be subject\r\n     to the restraints and privileges of all other contracts. A\r\n     contract, to be valid in law, must be formed between parties of\r\n     mature age, with an honest intention in said parties to do what\r\n     they agree. The least concealment, fraud, or deception, if\r\n     proved, annuls the contract. A boy can not contract for an acre\r\n     of land, or a horse, until he is twenty-one, but he may contract\r\n     for a wife at fourteen. If a man sell a horse, and the purchaser\r\n     find in him great incompatibility of temper--a disposition to\r\n     stand still when the owner is in haste to go--the sale is null\r\n     and void, and the man and his horse part company. But in\r\n     marriage, no matter how much fraud and deception are practiced,\r\n     nor how cruelly one or both parties have been misled; no matter\r\n     how young, inexperienced, or thoughtless the parties, nor how\r\n     unequal their condition and position in life, the contract can\r\n     not be annulled. Think of a husband telling a young and trusting\r\n     girl, but one short month his wife, that he married her for her\r\n     money; that those letters so precious to her, that she had read\r\n     and re-read, and kissed and cherished, were written by another;\r\n     that their splendid home, of which, on their wedding-day, her\r\n     father gave him the deed, is already in the hands of his\r\n     creditors; that she must give up the elegance and luxury that now\r\n     surround her, unless she can draw fresh supplies of money to meet\r\n     their wants! When she told the story of her wrongs to me--the\r\n     abuse to which she was subject, and the dread in which she\r\n     lived--I impulsively urged her to fly from such a monster and\r\n     villain, as she would before the hot breath of a ferocious beast\r\n     of the wilderness. (Applause). And she did fly; and it was well\r\n     with her. Many times since, as I have felt her throbbing heart\r\n     against my own, she has said, \"Oh, but for your love and\r\n     sympathy, your encouragement, I should never have escaped from\r\n     that bondage. Before I could, of myself, have found courage to\r\n     break those chains my heart would have broken in the effort.\"\r\n\r\n     Marriage, as it now exists, must seem to all of you a mere human\r\n     institution. Look through the universe of matter and mind--all\r\n     God's arrangements are perfect, harmonious, and complete! There\r\n     is no discord, friction, or failure in His eternal plans.\r\n     Immutability, perfection, beauty, are stamped on all His laws.\r\n     Love is the vital essence that pervades and permeates, from the\r\n     center to the circumference, the graduating circles of all\r\n     thought and action. Love is the talisman of human weal and\r\n     woe--the open sesame to every human soul. Where two beings are\r\n     drawn together, by the natural laws of likeness and affinity,\r\n     union and happiness are the result. Such marriages might be\r\n     Divine. But how is it now? You all know our marriage is, in many\r\n     cases, a mere outward tie, impelled by custom, policy, interest,\r\n     necessity; founded not even in friendship, to say nothing of\r\n     love; with every possible inequality of condition and\r\n     development. In these heterogeneous unions, we find youth and old\r\n     age, beauty and deformity, refinement and vulgarity, virtue and\r\n     vice, the educated and the ignorant, angels of grace and\r\n     goodness, with devils of malice and malignity: and the sum of all\r\n     this is human wretchedness and despair; cold fathers, sad\r\n     mothers, and hapless children, who shiver at the hearthstone,\r\n     where the fires of love have all gone out. The wide world, and\r\n     the stranger's unsympathizing gaze, are not more to be dreaded\r\n     for young hearts than homes like these. Now, who shall say that\r\n     it is right to take two beings, so unlike, and anchor them right\r\n     side by side, fast bound--to stay all time, until God shall\r\n     summon one away?\r\n\r\n     Do wise, Christian legislators need any arguments to convince\r\n     them that the sacredness of the family relation should be\r\n     protected at all hazards? The family, that great conservator of\r\n     national virtue and strength, how can you hope to build it up in\r\n     the midst of violence, debauchery, and excess? Can there be\r\n     anything sacred at that family altar, where the chief-priest who\r\n     ministers makes sacrifice of human beings, of the weak and the\r\n     innocent? where the incense offered up is not to the God of\r\n     justice and mercy, but to those heathen divinities, who best may\r\n     represent the lost man in all his grossness and deformity? Call\r\n     that sacred, where woman, the mother of the race--of a Jesus of\r\n     Nazareth--unconscious of the true dignity of her nature, of her\r\n     high and holy destiny, consents to live in legalized\r\n     prostitution!--her whole soul revolting at such gross\r\n     association!--her flesh shivering at the cold contamination of\r\n     that embrace, held there by no tie but the iron chain of the law,\r\n     and a false and most unnatural public sentiment? Call that\r\n     sacred, where innocent children, trembling with fear, fly to the\r\n     corners and dark places of the house, to hide themselves from the\r\n     wrath of drunken, brutal fathers, but, forgetting their past\r\n     sufferings, rush out again at their mother's frantic screams,\r\n     \"Help, oh help\"? Behold the agonies of those young hearts, as\r\n     they see the only being on earth they love, dragged about the\r\n     room by the hair of the head, kicked and pounded, and left half\r\n     dead and bleeding on the floor! Call that sacred, where fathers\r\n     like these have the power and legal right to hand down their\r\n     natures to other beings, to curse other generations with such\r\n     moral deformity and death?\r\n\r\n     Men and brethren, look into your asylums for the blind, the deaf\r\n     and dumb, the idiot, the imbecile, the deformed, the insane; go\r\n     out into the by-lanes and dens of this vast metropolis, and\r\n     contemplate that reeking mass of depravity; pause before the\r\n     terrible revelations made by statistics, of the rapid increase of\r\n     all this moral and physical impotency, and learn how fearful a\r\n     thing it is to violate the immutable laws of the beneficent Ruler\r\n     of the universe; and there behold the terrible retributions of\r\n     your violence on woman! Learn how false and cruel are those\r\n     institutions, which, with a coarse materialism, set aside those\r\n     holy instincts of the woman to bear no children but those of\r\n     love! In the best condition of marriage, as we now have it, to\r\n     woman comes all the penalties and sacrifices. A man, in the full\r\n     tide of business or pleasure, can marry and not change his life\r\n     one iota; he can be husband, father, and everything beside; but\r\n     in marriage, woman gives up all. Home is her sphere, her realm.\r\n     Well, be it so. If here you will make us all-supreme, take to\r\n     yourselves the universe beside; explore the North Pole; and, in\r\n     your airy car, all space; in your Northern homes and cloud-capt\r\n     towers, go feast on walrus flesh and air, and lay you down to\r\n     sleep your six months' night away, and leave us to make these\r\n     laws that govern the inner sanctuary of our own homes, and\r\n     faithful satellites we will ever be to the dinner-pot, the\r\n     cradle, and the old arm-chair. (Applause).\r\n\r\n     Fathers, do you say, let your daughters pay a life-long penalty\r\n     for one unfortunate step? How could they, on the threshold of\r\n     life, full of joy and hope, believing all things to be as they\r\n     seemed on the surface, judge of the dark windings of the human\r\n     soul? How could they foresee that the young man, to-day so noble,\r\n     so generous, would in a few short years be transformed into a\r\n     cowardly, mean tyrant, or a foul-mouthed, bloated drunkard? What\r\n     father could rest at his home by night, knowing that his lovely\r\n     daughter was at the mercy of a strong man drunk with wine and\r\n     passion, and that, do what he might, he was backed up by law and\r\n     public sentiment? The best interests of the individual, the\r\n     family, the State, the nation, cry out against these legalized\r\n     marriages of force and endurance. There can be no heaven without\r\n     love, and nothing is sacred in the family and home, but just so\r\n     far as it is built up and anchored in love. Our newspapers teem\r\n     with startling accounts of husbands and wives having shot or\r\n     poisoned each other, or committed suicide, choosing death rather\r\n     than the indissoluble tie; and, still worse, the living death of\r\n     faithless wives and daughters, from the first families in this\r\n     State, dragged from the privacy of home into the public prints\r\n     and courts, with all the painful details of sad, false lives.\r\n     What say you to facts like these? Now, do you believe, men and\r\n     women, that all these wretched matches are made in heaven? that\r\n     all these sad, miserable people are bound together by God? I know\r\n     Horace Greeley has been most eloquent, for weeks past, on the\r\n     holy sacrament of ill-assorted marriages; but let us hope that\r\n     all wisdom does not live, and will not die with Horace Greeley. I\r\n     think, if he had been married to _The New York Herald_, instead\r\n     of the Republican party, he would have found out some Scriptural\r\n     arguments against life-long unions, where great incompatibility\r\n     of temper existed between the parties. (Laughter and applause).\r\n\r\n     Our law-makers have dug a pit, and the innocent have fallen into\r\n     it; and now will you coolly cover them over with statute laws,\r\n     _Tribunes_, and Weeds,[169] and tell them to stay there and pay\r\n     the life-long penalty of having fallen in? Nero was thought the\r\n     chief of tyrants, because he made laws and hung them up so high\r\n     that his subjects could not read them, and then punished them for\r\n     every act of disobedience. What better are our Republican\r\n     legislators? The mass of the women of this nation know nothing\r\n     about the laws, yet all their specially barbarous legislation is\r\n     for woman. Where have they made any provision for her to learn\r\n     the laws? Where is the Law School for our daughters? where the\r\n     law office, the bar, or the bench, now urging them to take part\r\n     in the jurisprudence of the nation?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELIZABETH CADY STANTON (with autograph).]\r\n\r\n     But, say you, does not separation cover all these difficulties?\r\n     No one objects to separation when the parties are so disposed.\r\n     But, to separation there are two very serious objections. First,\r\n     so long as you insist on marriage as a divine institution, as an\r\n     indissoluble tie, so long as you maintain your present laws\r\n     against divorce, you make separation, even, so odious, that the\r\n     most noble, virtuous, and sensitive men and women choose a life\r\n     of concealed misery, rather than a partial, disgraceful release.\r\n     Secondly, those who, in their impetuosity and despair, do, in\r\n     spite of public sentiment, separate, find themselves in their new\r\n     position beset with many temptations to lead a false, unreal\r\n     life. This isolation bears especially hard on woman. Marriage is\r\n     not all of life to man. His resources for amusement and\r\n     occupation are boundless. He has the whole world for his home.\r\n     His business, his politics, his club, his friendships with either\r\n     sex, can help to fill up the void made by an unfortunate union or\r\n     separation. But to woman, marriage is all and everything; her\r\n     sole object in life--that for which she is educated--the subject\r\n     of all her sleeping and her waking dreams. Now, if a noble,\r\n     generous girl of eighteen marries, and is unfortunate, because\r\n     the cruelty of her husband compels separation, in her dreary\r\n     isolation, would you drive her to a nunnery; and shall she be a\r\n     nun indeed? Her solitude is nothing less, as, in the present\r\n     undeveloped condition of woman, it is only through our fathers,\r\n     brothers, husbands, sons, that we feel the pulsations of the\r\n     great outer world.\r\n\r\n     One unhappy, discordant man or woman in a neighborhood, may mar\r\n     the happiness of all the rest. You can not shut up discord, any\r\n     more than you can small-pox. There can be no morality where there\r\n     is a settled discontent. A very wise father once remarked, that\r\n     in the government of his children, he forbade as few things as\r\n     possible; a wise legislation would do the same. It is folly to\r\n     make laws on subjects beyond human prerogative, knowing that in\r\n     the very nature of things they must be set aside. To make laws\r\n     that man can not and will not obey, serves to bring all law into\r\n     contempt. It is very important in a republic, that the people\r\n     should respect the laws, for if we throw them to the winds, what\r\n     becomes of civil government? What do our present divorce laws\r\n     amount to? Those who wish to evade them have only to go into\r\n     another State to accomplish what they desire. If any of our\r\n     citizens can not secure their inalienable rights in New York\r\n     State, they may in Connecticut and Indiana. Why is it that all\r\n     agreements, covenants, partnerships, are left wholly at the\r\n     discretion of the parties, except the contract, which of all\r\n     others is considered most holy and important, both for the\r\n     individual and the race? This question of divorce, they tell us,\r\n     is hedged about with difficulties; that it can not be approached\r\n     with the ordinary rules of logic and common-sense. It is too\r\n     holy, too sacred to be discussed, and few seem disposed to touch\r\n     it. From man's standpoint, this may be all true, as to him they\r\n     say belong reason, and the power of ratiocination. Fortunately, I\r\n     belong to that class endowed with mere intuitions, a kind of\r\n     moral instinct, by which we feel out right and wrong. In\r\n     presenting to you, therefore, my views of divorce, you will of\r\n     course give them the weight only of the woman's intuitions. But\r\n     inasmuch as that is all God saw fit to give us, it is evident we\r\n     need nothing more. Hence, what we do perceive of truth must be as\r\n     reliable as what man grinds out by the longer process of reason,\r\n     authority, and speculation.\r\n\r\n     Horace Greeley, in his recent discussion with Robert Dale Owen,\r\n     said, this whole question has been tried, in all its varieties\r\n     and conditions, from indissoluble monogamic marriage down to free\r\n     love; that the ground has been all gone over and explored. Let me\r\n     assure him that but just one-half of the ground has been\r\n     surveyed, and that half but by one of the parties, and that party\r\n     certainly not the most interested in the matter. Moreover, there\r\n     is one kind of marriage that has not been tried, and that is, a\r\n     contract made by equal parties to live an equal life, with equal\r\n     restraints and privileges on either side. Thus far, we have had\r\n     the man marriage, and nothing more. From the beginning, man has\r\n     had the sole and whole regulation of the matter. He has spoken in\r\n     Scripture, he has spoken in law. As an individual, he has decided\r\n     the time and cause for putting away a wife, and as a judge and\r\n     legislator, he still holds the entire control. In all history,\r\n     sacred and profane, the woman is regarded and spoken of simply as\r\n     the toy of man--made for his special use--to meet his most gross\r\n     and sensuous desires. She is taken or put away, given or\r\n     received, bought or sold, just as the interest of the parties\r\n     might dictate. But the woman has been no more recognized in all\r\n     these transactions, through all the different periods and\r\n     conditions of the race, than if she had had no part nor lot in\r\n     the whole matter. The right of woman to put away a husband, be he\r\n     ever so impure, is never hinted at in sacred history. Even Jesus\r\n     himself failed to recognize the sacred rights of the holy mother\r\n     of the race. We can not take our gauge of womanhood from the\r\n     past, but from the solemn convictions of our own souls, in the\r\n     higher development of the race. No parchments, however venerable\r\n     with the mould of ages, no human institutions, can bound the\r\n     immortal wants of the royal sons and daughters of the great I\r\n     Am,--rightful heirs of the joys of time, and joint heirs of the\r\n     glories of eternity.\r\n\r\n     If in marriage either party claims the right to stand supreme, to\r\n     woman, the mother of the race, belongs the scepter and the crown.\r\n     Her life is one long sacrifice for man. You tell us that among\r\n     all womankind there is no Moses, Christ, or Paul,--no Michael\r\n     Angelo, Beethoven, or Shakspeare,--no Columbus, or Galileo,--no\r\n     Locke or Bacon. Behold those mighty minds attuned to music and\r\n     the arts, so great, so grand, so comprehensive,--these are our\r\n     great works of which we boast! Into you, O sons of earth, go all\r\n     of us that is immortal. In you center our very life-thoughts, our\r\n     hopes, our intensest love. For you we gladly pour out our heart's\r\n     blood and die, knowing that from our suffering comes forth a new\r\n     and more glorious resurrection of thought and life. (Loud\r\n     applause).\r\n\r\nRev. Antoinette Brown Blackwell followed, and prefaced her remarks by\r\nsaying: \"Ours has always been a free platform. We have believed in the\r\nfullest freedom of thought and in the free expression of individual\r\nopinion. I propose to speak upon the subject discussed by our friend,\r\nMrs. Stanton. It is often said that there are two sides to every\r\nquestion; but there are three sides, many sides, to every question.\r\nLet Mrs. Stanton take hers; let Horace Greeley take his; I only ask\r\nthe privilege of stating mine. (Applause). I have embodied my thought,\r\nhastily, in a series of resolutions,[170] and my remarks following\r\nthem will be very brief.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Blackwell continued:\r\n\r\n     I believe that the highest laws of life are those which we find\r\n     written within our being; that the first moral laws which we are\r\n     to obey are the laws which God's own finger has traced upon our\r\n     own souls. Therefore, our first duty is to ourselves, and we may\r\n     never, under any circumstances, yield this to any other. I say we\r\n     are first responsible to ourselves, and to the God who has laid\r\n     the obligation upon us, to make ourselves the grandest we may.\r\n     Marriage grows out of the relations of parties. The law of our\r\n     development comes wholly from within; but the relation of\r\n     marriage supposes two persons as being united to each other, and\r\n     from this relation originates the law. Mrs. Stanton calls\r\n     marriage a \"tie.\" No, marriage is a _relation_; and, once formed,\r\n     that relation continues as long as the parties continue with the\r\n     natures which they now essentially have. Let, then, the two\r\n     parties deliberately, voluntarily consent to enter into this\r\n     relation. It is one which, from its very nature, must be\r\n     permanent. Can the mother ever destroy the relation which exists\r\n     between herself and her child? Can the father annul the relation\r\n     which exists between himself and his child? Then, can the father\r\n     and mother annul the relation which exists between themselves,\r\n     the parents of the child? It can not be. The interests of\r\n     marriage are such that they can not be destroyed, and the only\r\n     question must be, \"Has there been a marriage in this case or\r\n     not?\" If there has, then the social law, the obligations growing\r\n     out of the relation, must be life-long.\r\n\r\n     But I assert that every woman, in the present state of society,\r\n     is bound to maintain her own independence and her own integrity\r\n     of character; to assert herself, earnestly and firmly, as the\r\n     equal of man, who is only her peer. This is her first right, her\r\n     first duty; and if she lives in a country where the law supposes\r\n     that she is to be subjected to her husband, and she consents to\r\n     this subjection, I do insist that she consents to degradation;\r\n     that this is sin, and it is impossible to make it other than sin.\r\n     True, in this State, and in nearly all the States, the idea of\r\n     marriage is that of subjection, in all respects, of the wife to\r\n     the husband--personal subjection, subjection in the rights over\r\n     their children and over their property; but this is a false\r\n     relation. Marriage is a union of equals--equal interests being\r\n     involved, equal duties at stake; and if any woman has been\r\n     married to a man who chooses to take advantage of the laws as\r\n     they now stand, who chooses to subject her, ignobly, to his will,\r\n     against her own, to take from her the earnings which belong to\r\n     the family, and to take from her the children which belong to the\r\n     family, I hold that that woman, if she can not, by her influence,\r\n     change this state of things, is solemnly obligated to go to some\r\n     State where she can be legally divorced; and then she would be as\r\n     solemnly bound to return again, and, standing for herself and her\r\n     children, regard herself, in the sight of God, as being bound\r\n     still to the father of those children, to work for his best\r\n     interests, while she still maintains her own sovereignty. Of\r\n     course, she must be governed by the circumstances of the case.\r\n     She may be obliged, for the protection of the family, to live on\r\n     one continent while her husband is on the other: but she is never\r\n     to forget that in the sight of God and her own soul, she is his\r\n     wife, and that she owes to him the wife's loyalty; that to work\r\n     for his redemption is her highest social obligation, and that to\r\n     teach her children to do the same is her first motherly duty.\r\n     Legal divorce may be necessary for personal and family\r\n     protection; if so, let every woman obtain it. This, God helping\r\n     me, is what I would certainly do, for under no circumstances will\r\n     I ever give my consent to be subjected to the will of another, in\r\n     any relation, for God has bidden me not to do it. But the idea of\r\n     most women is, that they must be timid, weak, helpless, and full\r\n     of ignoble submission. Only last week, a lady who has just been\r\n     divorced from her husband said to me--\"I used to be required to\r\n     go into the field and do the hardest laborer's work, when I was\r\n     not able to do it; and my husband would declare, that if I would\r\n     not thus labor, I should not be allowed to eat, and I was obliged\r\n     to submit.\" I say the fault was as much with the woman as with\r\n     the man; she should never have submitted.\r\n\r\n     Our trouble is not with marriage as a relation between two; it is\r\n     all individual. We have few men or women fit to be married. They\r\n     neither fully respect themselves and their own rights and duties,\r\n     nor yet those of another. They have no idea how noble, how\r\n     godlike is the relation which ought to exist between the husband\r\n     and wife.\r\n\r\n     Tell me, is marriage to be merely a contract--something entered\r\n     into for a time, and then broken again--or is the true marriage\r\n     permanent? One resolution read by Mrs. Stanton said that, as men\r\n     are incompetent to select partners in business, teachers for\r\n     their children, ministers of their religion, or makers,\r\n     adjudicators, or administrators of their laws, and as the same\r\n     weakness and blindness must attend in the selection of\r\n     matrimonial partners, the latter and most important contract\r\n     should no more be perpetual than either or all of the former. I\r\n     do not believe that, rightly understood, she quite holds to that\r\n     position herself. Marriage must be either permanent, or capable\r\n     of being any time dissolved. Which ground shall we take? I insist\r\n     that, from the nature of things, marriage must be as permanent\r\n     and indissoluble as the relation of parent and child. If so, let\r\n     us legislate toward the right. Though evils must sometimes\r\n     result, we are still to seek the highest law of the relation.\r\n\r\n     Self-devotion is always sublimely beautiful, but the law has no\r\n     right to require either a woman to be sacrificed to any man, or a\r\n     man to be sacrificed to any woman, or either to the good of\r\n     society; but if either chooses to devote himself to the good of\r\n     the other, no matter how low that other may have fallen, no\r\n     matter how degraded he may be, let the willing partner strive to\r\n     lift him up, not by going down and sitting side by side with\r\n     him--that is wrong--but by steadily trying to win him back to the\r\n     right: keeping his own sovereignty, but trying to redeem the\r\n     fallen one as long as life shall endure. I do not wish to go to\r\n     the other state of being, and state what shall be our duty there,\r\n     but I do say, that where there is sin and suffering in this\r\n     universe of ours, we may none of us sit still until we have\r\n     overcome that sin and suffering. Then if my husband was wretched\r\n     and degraded in this life, I believe God would give me strength\r\n     to work for him while life lasted. I would do that for the lowest\r\n     drunkard in the street, and certainly I would do as much for my\r\n     husband. I believe that the greatest boon of existence is the\r\n     privilege of working for those who are oppressed and fallen; and\r\n     those who have oppressed their own natures are those who need the\r\n     most help. My great hope is, that I may be able to lift them\r\n     upwards. The great responsibility that has been laid upon me is\r\n     the responsibility never to sit down and sing to myself psalms of\r\n     happiness and content while anybody suffers. (Applause). Then, if\r\n     I find a wretched man in the gutter, and feel that, as a human\r\n     sister, I must go and lift him up, and that I can never enjoy\r\n     peace or rest until I have thus redeemed him and brought him out\r\n     of his sins, shall I, if the man whom I solemnly swore to love,\r\n     to associate with in all the interests of home and its holiest\r\n     relations--shall I, if he falls into sin, turn him off, and go on\r\n     enjoying life, while he is sunk in wretchedness and sin? I will\r\n     not do it. To me there is a higher idea of life. If, as an\r\n     intelligent human being, I promised to co-work with him in all\r\n     the higher interests of life, and if he proves false, I will not\r\n     turn from him, but I must seek first to regenerate him, the\r\n     nearest and dearest to me, as I would work, secondly, to save my\r\n     children, who are next, and then my brothers, my sisters, and the\r\n     whole human family. (Applause).\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Stanton asks, \"Would you send a young girl into a nunnery,\r\n     when she has made a mistake?\" Does Mrs. Stanton not know that\r\n     nunneries belong to a past age, that people who had nothing to do\r\n     might go there and try to expiate their own sins? I would teach\r\n     the young girl a higher way. I do not say to her, \"If you have\r\n     foolishly united yourself to another\" (not \"if you have been tied\r\n     by the law\"; for, remember, it was not the law that tied her; she\r\n     said, \"I will do it,\" and the law said, \"So let it be!\")--\"sunder\r\n     the bond\"; but I say to her, that her duty is to reflect, \"Now\r\n     that I see my mistake, I will commence being true to myself; I\r\n     will become a true unit, strong and noble in myself; and if I can\r\n     never make our union a true one, I will work toward that good\r\n     result, I will live for this great work--for truth and all its\r\n     interests.\" Let me tell you, if she is not great enough to do\r\n     this, she is not great enough to enter into any union!\r\n\r\n     Look at those who believe in thus easily dissolving the marriage\r\n     obligation! In very many cases they can not be truly married, or\r\n     truly happy in this relation, because there is something\r\n     incompatible with it in their own natures. It is not always so;\r\n     but when one feels that it is a relation easily to be dissolved,\r\n     of course, incompatibility at once seems to arise in the other,\r\n     and every difficulty that occurs, instead of being overlooked, as\r\n     it ought to be, in a spirit of forgiveness, is magnified, and the\r\n     evil naturally increased. We purchase a house, the deed is put\r\n     into our hands, and we take possession. We feel at once that it\r\n     is really very convenient. It suits us, and we are surprised that\r\n     we like it so much better than we supposed. The secret is, that\r\n     it is our house, and until we are ready to part with it, we make\r\n     ourselves content with it as it is. We go to live in some country\r\n     town. At first we do not like it; it is not like the home we came\r\n     from; but soon we begin to be reconciled, and feel that, as Dr.\r\n     Holmes said of Boston, our town is the hub of the universe. So,\r\n     when we are content to allow our relations to remain as they are,\r\n     we adapt ourselves to them, and they adapt themselves to us, and\r\n     we constantly, unconsciously (because God made us so) work toward\r\n     the perfecting of all the interests arising from those\r\n     relations. But the moment we wish to sell a house, or remove from\r\n     a town, how many defects we discover! The place has not the same\r\n     appearance to us at all; we wish we could get out of it; we feel\r\n     all the time more and more dissatisfied. So, let any married\r\n     person take the idea that he may dissolve this relation, and\r\n     enter into a new one, and how many faults he may discover that\r\n     otherwise never would have been noticed! The marriage will become\r\n     intolerable. The theory will work that result; it is in the\r\n     nature of things, and that to me is everything.\r\n\r\n     Of course, I would not have man or woman sacrificed--by no means.\r\n     First of all, let every human being maintain his own position as\r\n     a self-protecting human being. At all hazards, let him never sin,\r\n     or consent to be sacrificed to the hurt of himself or of another;\r\n     and when he has taken this stand, let him act in harmony with it.\r\n     Would I say to any woman, \"You are bound, because you are legally\r\n     married to one who is debased to the level of the brute, to be\r\n     the mother of his children?\" I say to her, \"No! while the law of\r\n     God continues, you are bound never to make one whom you do not\r\n     honor and respect, as well as love, the father of any child of\r\n     yours. It is your first and highest duty to be true to yourself,\r\n     true to posterity, and true to society.\" (Applause). Thus, let\r\n     each decide for himself and for herself what is right. But, I\r\n     repeat, either marriage is in its very nature a relation which,\r\n     once formed, never can be dissolved, and either the essential\r\n     obligations growing out of it exist forever, or the relation may\r\n     at any time be dissolved, and at any time those obligations be\r\n     annulled. And what are those obligations? Two persons, if I\r\n     understand marriage, covenant to work together, to uphold each\r\n     other in all excellence, and to mutually blend their lives and\r\n     interests into a common harmony. I believe that God has so made\r\n     man and woman, that it is not good for them to be alone, that\r\n     they each need a co-worker. There is no work on God's footstool\r\n     which man can do alone and do well, and there is no work which\r\n     woman can do alone and do well. (Applause). We need that the two\r\n     should stand side by side everywhere. All over the world, we need\r\n     this co-operation of the two classes--not because they are alike,\r\n     but because they are unlike--in trying to make the whole world\r\n     better. Then we need something more than these class workers. Two\r\n     persons need to stand side by side, to stay up each other's\r\n     hands, to take an interest in each other's welfare, to build up a\r\n     family, to cluster about it all the beauties and excellencies of\r\n     home life; in short, to be to each other what only one man and\r\n     one woman can be to each other in all God's earth.\r\n\r\n     No grown-up human being ought to rush blindly into this most\r\n     intimate, most important, most enduring of human relations; and\r\n     will you let a young man, at the age of fourteen, contract\r\n     marriage, or a young maiden either? If the law undertakes to\r\n     regulate the matter at all, let it regulate it upon principles of\r\n     common-sense. But this is a matter which must be very much\r\n     regulated by public opinion, by our teachers. What do you, the\r\n     guides of our youth, say? You say to the young girl, \"You ought\r\n     to expect to be married before you are twenty, or about that\r\n     time; you should intend to be; and from the time you are fifteen,\r\n     it should be made your one life purpose; and in all human\r\n     probability, you may expect to spend the next ten or twenty years\r\n     in the nursery, and at forty or fifty, you will be an old woman,\r\n     your life will be well-nigh worn out.\" I stand here to say that\r\n     this is all false. Let the young girl be instructed that, above\r\n     her personal interests, her home, and social life, she is to have\r\n     a great life purpose, as broad as the rights and interests of\r\n     humanity. I say, let every young girl feel this, as much as every\r\n     young man does. We have no right, we, who expect to live forever,\r\n     to play about here as if we were mere flies, enjoying ourselves\r\n     in the sunshine. We ought to have an earnest purpose outside of\r\n     home, outside of our family relations. Then let the young girl\r\n     fit herself for this. Let her be taught that she ought not to be\r\n     married in her teens. Let her wait, as a young man does, if he is\r\n     sensible, until she is twenty-five or thirty. (Applause). She\r\n     will then know how to choose properly, and probably she will not\r\n     be deceived in her estimate of character; she will have had a\r\n     certain life-discipline, which will enable her to control her\r\n     household matters with wise judgment, so that, while she is\r\n     looking after her family, she may still keep her great life\r\n     purpose, for which she was educated, and to which she has given\r\n     her best energies, steadily in view. She need not absorb herself\r\n     in her home, and God never intended that she should; and then, if\r\n     she has lived according to the laws of physiology, and according\r\n     to the laws of common-sense, she ought to be, at the age of fifty\r\n     years, just where man is, just where our great men are, in the\r\n     very prime of life! When her young children have gone out of her\r\n     home, then let her enter in earnest upon the great work of life\r\n     outside of home and its relations. (Applause).\r\n\r\n     It is a shame for our women to have no steady purpose or pursuit,\r\n     and to make the mere fact of womanhood a valid plea for\r\n     indolence; it is a greater shame that they should be instructed\r\n     thus to throw all the responsibility of working for the general\r\n     good upon the other sex. God has not intended it. But as long as\r\n     you make women helpless, inefficient beings, who never expect to\r\n     earn a farthing in their lives, who never expect to do anything\r\n     outside of the family, but to be cared for and protected by\r\n     others throughout life, you can not have true marriages; and if\r\n     you try to break up the old ones, you will do it against the\r\n     woman and in favor of the man. Last week I went back to a town\r\n     where I used to live, and was told that a woman, whose husband\r\n     was notoriously the most miserable man in the town, had in\r\n     despair taken her own life. I asked what had become of the\r\n     husband, and the answer was, \"Married again.\" And yet everybody\r\n     there knows that he is the vilest and most contemptible man in\r\n     the whole neighborhood. Any man, no matter how wretched he maybe,\r\n     will find plenty of women to accept him, while they are rendered\r\n     so helpless and weak by their whole education that they must be\r\n     supported or starve. The advantage, if this theory of marriage is\r\n     adopted, will not be on the side of woman, but altogether on the\r\n     side of man. The cure for the evils that now exist is not in\r\n     dissolving marriage, but it is in giving to the married woman her\r\n     own natural independence and self-sovereignty, by which she can\r\n     maintain herself.\r\n\r\n     Yes, our women and our men are both degenerate; they are weak\r\n     and ignoble. \"Dear me!\" said a pretty, indolent young lady, \"I\r\n     had a great deal rather my husband would take care of me, than to\r\n     be obliged to do it for myself.\" \"Of course you would,\" said a\r\n     blunt old lady who was present; \"and your brother would a great\r\n     deal rather marry an heiress, and lie upon a sofa eating\r\n     lollypops, bought with her money, than to do anything manly or\r\n     noble. The only difference is, that as heiresses are not very\r\n     plenty, he may probably have to marry a poor girl, and then\r\n     society will insist that he shall exert himself to earn a living\r\n     for the family; but you, poor thing, will only have to open your\r\n     mouth, all your life long, like a clam, and eat.\" (Applause and\r\n     laughter). So long as society is constituted in such a way that\r\n     woman is expected to do nothing if she have a father, brother, or\r\n     husband able to support her, there is no salvation for her, in or\r\n     out of marriage. When you tie up your arm, it will become weak\r\n     and feeble; and when you tie up woman, she will become weak and\r\n     helpless. Give her, then, some earnest purpose in life, hold up\r\n     to her the true ideal of marriage, and it is enough--I am\r\n     content! (Loud applause).\r\n\r\n     ERNESTINE L. ROSE said:--Mrs. President--The question of a\r\n     Divorce law seems to me one of the greatest importance to all\r\n     parties, but I presume that the very advocacy of divorce will be\r\n     called \"Free Love.\" For my part (and I wish distinctly to define\r\n     my position), I do not know what others understand by that term;\r\n     to me, in its truest significance, love must be free, or it\r\n     ceases to be love. In its low and degrading sense, it is not love\r\n     at all, and I have as little to do with its name as its reality.\r\n\r\n     The Rev. Mrs. Blackwell gave us quite a sermon on what woman\r\n     ought to be, what she ought to do, and what marriage ought to be;\r\n     an excellent sermon in its proper place, but not when the\r\n     important question of a Divorce law is under consideration. She\r\n     treats woman as some ethereal being. It is very well to be\r\n     ethereal to some extent, but I tell you, my friends, it is quite\r\n     requisite to be a little material, also. At all events, we are\r\n     so, and, being so, it proves a law of our nature. (Applause).\r\n\r\n     It were indeed well if woman could be what she ought to be, man\r\n     what he ought to be, and marriage what it ought to be; and it is\r\n     to be hoped that through the Woman's Rights movement--the\r\n     equalizing of the laws, making them more just, and making woman\r\n     more independent--we will hasten the coming of the millennium,\r\n     when marriage shall indeed be a bond of union and affection. But,\r\n     alas! it is not yet; and I fear that sermons, however well meant,\r\n     will not produce that desirable end; and as long as the evil is\r\n     here, we must look it in the face without shrinking, grapple with\r\n     it manfully, and the more complicated it is, the more\r\n     courageously must it be analyzed, combated, and destroyed.\r\n     (Applause).\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Blackwell told us that, marriage being based on the perfect\r\n     equality of husband and wife, it can not be destroyed. But is it\r\n     so? Where? Where and when have the sexes yet been equal in\r\n     physical or mental education, in position, or in law? When and\r\n     where have they yet been recognized by society, or by themselves,\r\n     as equals? \"Equal in rights,\" says Mrs. B. But are they equal in\r\n     rights? If they were, we would need no conventions to claim our\r\n     rights. \"She can assert her equality.\" Yes, she can assert it,\r\n     but does that assertion constitute a true marriage? And when the\r\n     husband holds the iron heel of legal oppression on the\r\n     subjugated neck of the wife until every spark of womanhood is\r\n     crushed out, will it heal the wounded heart, the lacerated\r\n     spirit, the destroyed hope, to assert her equality? And shall she\r\n     still continue the wife? Is that a marriage which must not be\r\n     dissolved? (Applause).\r\n\r\n     According to Mr. Greeley's definition, viz., that there is no\r\n     marriage unless the ceremony is performed by a minister and in a\r\n     church, the tens of thousands married according to the laws of\r\n     this and most of the other States, by a lawyer or justice of the\r\n     peace, a mayor or an alderman, are not married at all. According\r\n     to the definition of our reverend sister, no one has ever yet\r\n     been married, as woman has never yet been perfectly equal with\r\n     man. I say to both, take your position, and abide by the\r\n     consequences. If the few only, or no one, is really married, why\r\n     do you object to a law that shall acknowledge the fact? You\r\n     certainly ought not to force people to live together who are not\r\n     married. (Applause).\r\n\r\n     Mr. Greeley tells us, that, marriage being a Divine institution,\r\n     nothing but death should ever separate the parties; but when he\r\n     was asked, \"Would you have a being who, innocent and\r\n     inexperienced, in the youth and ardor of affection, in the fond\r\n     hope that the sentiment was reciprocated, united herself to one\r\n     she loved and cherished, and then found (no matter from what\r\n     cause) that his profession was false, his heart hollow, his acts\r\n     cruel, that she was degraded by his vice, despised for his\r\n     crimes, cursed by his very presence, and treated with every\r\n     conceivable ignominy--would you have her drag out a miserable\r\n     existence as his wife?\" \"No, no,\" says he; \"in that case, they\r\n     ought to separate.\" Separate? But what becomes of the union\r\n     divinely instituted, which death only should part? (Applause).\r\n\r\n     The papers have of late been filled with the heart-sickening\r\n     accounts of wife-poisoning. Whence come these terrible crimes?\r\n     From the want of a Divorce law. Could the Hardings be legally\r\n     separated, they would not be driven to the commission of murder\r\n     to be free from each other; and which is preferable, a Divorce\r\n     law, to dissolve an unholy union, which all parties agree is no\r\n     true marriage, or a murder of one, and an execution (legal\r\n     murder) of the other party? But had the unfortunate woman, just\r\n     before the poisoned cup was presented to her lips, pleaded for a\r\n     divorce, Mrs. Blackwell would have read her a sermon equal to St.\r\n     Paul's \"Wives, be obedient to your husbands,\" only she would have\r\n     added, \"You must assert your equality,\" but \"you must keep with\r\n     your husband and work for his redemption, as I would do for my\r\n     husband\"; and Mr. Greeley would say, \"As you chose to marry him,\r\n     it is your own fault; you must abide the consequences, for it is\r\n     a 'divine institution, a union for life, which nothing but death\r\n     can end.'\" (Applause). The Tribune had recently a long sermon,\r\n     almost equal to the one we had this morning from our reverend\r\n     sister, on \"Fast Women.\" The evils it spoke of were terrible\r\n     indeed, but, like all other sermons, it was one-sided. Not one\r\n     single word was said about fast men, except that the \"poor victim\r\n     had to spend so much money.\" The writer forgot that it is the\r\n     demand which calls the supply into existence. But what was the\r\n     primary cause of that tragic end? Echo answers, \"what?\" Ask the\r\n     lifeless form of the murdered woman, and she may disclose the\r\n     terrible secret, and show you that, could she have been legally\r\n     divorced, she might not have been driven to the watery grave of a\r\n     \"fast woman.\" (Applause).\r\n\r\n     But what is marriage? A human institution, called out by the\r\n     needs of social, affectional human nature, for human purposes,\r\n     its objects are, first, the happiness of the parties immediately\r\n     concerned, and, secondly, the welfare of society. Define it as\r\n     you please, these are only its objects; and therefore if, from\r\n     well-ascertained facts, it is demonstrated that the real objects\r\n     are frustrated, that instead of union and happiness, there are\r\n     only discord and misery to themselves, and vice and crime to\r\n     society, I ask, in the name of individual happiness and social\r\n     morality and well-being, why such a marriage should be binding\r\n     for life?--why one human being should be chained for life to the\r\n     dead body of another? \"But they may separate and still remain\r\n     married.\" What a perversion of the very term! Is that the union\r\n     which \"death only should part\"? It may be according to the\r\n     definition of the Rev. Mrs. Blackwell's theology and Mr.\r\n     Greeley's dictionary, but it certainly is not according to\r\n     common-sense or the dictates of morality. No, no! \"It is not well\r\n     for man to be alone,\" before nor after marriage. (Applause).\r\n\r\n     I therefore ask for a Divorce law. Divorce is now granted for\r\n     some crimes; I ask it for others also. It is granted for a\r\n     State's prison offense. I ask that personal cruelty to a wife,\r\n     whom he swore to \"love, cherish, and protect,\" may be made a\r\n     heinous crime--a perjury and a State's prison offense, for which\r\n     divorce shall be granted. Willful desertion for one year should\r\n     be a sufficient cause for divorce, for the willful deserter\r\n     forfeits the sacred title of husband or wife. Habitual\r\n     intemperance, or any other vice which makes the husband or wife\r\n     intolerable and abhorrent to the other, ought to be sufficient\r\n     cause for divorce. I ask for a law of Divorce, so as to secure\r\n     the real objects and blessings of married life, to prevent the\r\n     crimes and immoralities now practiced, to prevent \"Free Love,\" in\r\n     its most hideous form, such as is now carried on but too often\r\n     under the very name of marriage, where hypocrisy is added to the\r\n     crime of legalized prostitution. \"Free Love,\" in its degraded\r\n     sense, asks for no Divorce law. It acknowledges no marriage, and\r\n     therefore requires no divorce. I believe in true marriages, and\r\n     therefore I ask for a law to free men and women from false ones.\r\n     (Applause).\r\n\r\n     But it is said that if divorce were easily granted, \"men and\r\n     women would marry to-day and unmarry to-morrow.\" Those who say\r\n     that, only prove that they have no confidence in themselves, and\r\n     therefore can have no confidence in others. But the assertion is\r\n     false; it is a libel on human nature. It is the indissoluble\r\n     chain that corrodes the flesh. Remove the indissolubility, and\r\n     there would be less separation than now, for it would place the\r\n     parties on their good behavior, the same as during courtship.\r\n     Human nature is not quite so changeable; give it more freedom,\r\n     and it will be less so. We are a good deal the creatures of\r\n     habit, but we will not be forced. We live (I speak from\r\n     experience) in uncomfortable houses for years, rather than move,\r\n     though we have the privilege to do so every year; but force any\r\n     one to live for life in one house, and he would run away from it,\r\n     though it were a palace.\r\n\r\n     But Mr. Greeley asks, \"How could the mother look the child in the\r\n     face, if she married a second time?\" With infinitely better grace\r\n     and better conscience than to live as some do now, and show their\r\n     children the degrading example, how utterly father and mother\r\n     despise and hate each other, and still live together as husband\r\n     and wife. She could say to her child, \"As, unfortunately, your\r\n     father proved himself unworthy, your mother could not be so\r\n     unworthy as to continue to live with him. As he failed to be a\r\n     true father to you, I have endeavored to supply his place with\r\n     one, who, though not entitled to the name, will, I hope, prove\r\n     himself one in the performance of a father's duties.\" (Applause).\r\n\r\n     Finally, educate woman, to enable her to promote her\r\n     independence, and she will not be obliged to marry for a home and\r\n     a subsistence. Give the wife an equal right with the husband in\r\n     the property acquired after marriage, and it will be a bond of\r\n     union between them. Diamond cement, applied on both sides of a\r\n     fractured vase, re-unites the parts, and prevents them from\r\n     falling asunder. A gold band is more efficacious than an iron\r\n     law. Until now, the gold has all been on one side, and the iron\r\n     law on the other. Remove it; place the golden band of justice and\r\n     mutual interest around both husband and wife, and it will hide\r\n     the little fractures which may have occurred, even from their own\r\n     perception, and allow them effectually to re-unite. A union of\r\n     interest helps to preserve a union of hearts. (Loud applause).\r\n\r\n     WENDELL PHILLIPS then said: I object to entering these\r\n     resolutions upon the journal of this Convention. (Applause). I\r\n     would move to lay them on the table; but my conviction that they\r\n     are out of order is so emphatic, that I wish to go further than\r\n     that, and move that they do not appear on the journals of this\r\n     Convention. If the resolutions were merely the expressions of\r\n     individual sentiments, then they ought not to appear in the form\r\n     of resolutions, but as speeches, because a resolution has a\r\n     certain emphasis and authority. It is assumed to give the voice\r\n     of an assembly, and is not taken as an individual expression,\r\n     which a speech is.\r\n\r\n     Of course, every person must be interested in the question of\r\n     marriage, and the branch that grows out of it, the question of\r\n     divorce; and no one could deny, who has listened for an hour,\r\n     that we have been favored with an exceedingly able discussion of\r\n     those questions. But here we have nothing to do with them, any\r\n     more than with the question of intemperance, or Kansas, in my\r\n     opinion. This Convention is no Marriage Convention--if it were,\r\n     the subject would be in order; but this Convention, if I\r\n     understand it, assembles to discuss the laws that rest unequally\r\n     upon women, not those that rest equally upon men and women. It is\r\n     the laws that make distinctions between the sexes. Now, whether a\r\n     man and a woman are married for a year or a life is a question\r\n     which affects the man just as much as the woman. At the end of a\r\n     month, the man is without a wife exactly as much as the woman is\r\n     without a husband. The question whether, having entered into a\r\n     contract, you shall be bound to an unworthy partner, affects the\r\n     man as much as the woman. Certainly, there are cases where men\r\n     are bound to women carcasses as well as where women are bound to\r\n     men carcasses. (Laughter and applause). We have nothing to do\r\n     with a question which affects both sexes equally. Therefore, it\r\n     seems to me we have nothing to do with the theory of marriage,\r\n     which is the basis, as Mrs. Rose has very clearly shown, of\r\n     divorce. One question grows out of the other; and therefore the\r\n     question of the permanence of marriage, and the laws relating to\r\n     marriage, in the essential meaning of that word, are not for our\r\n     consideration. Of course I know, as everybody else does, that the\r\n     results of marriage, in the present condition of society, are\r\n     often more disastrous to woman than to men. Intemperance, for\r\n     instance, burdens a wife worse than a husband, owing to the\r\n     present state of society. It is not the fault of the\r\n     statute-book, and no change in the duration of marriage would\r\n     alter that inequality.\r\n\r\n     The reason why I object so emphatically to the introduction of\r\n     the question here is because it is a question which admits of so\r\n     many theories, physiological and religious, and what is\r\n     technically called \"free-love,\" that it is large enough for a\r\n     movement of its own. Our question is only unnecessarily burdened\r\n     with it. It can not be kept within the convenient limits of this\r\n     enterprise; for this Woman's Rights Convention is not Man's\r\n     Convention, and I hold that I, as a man, have an exactly equal\r\n     interest in the essential question of marriage as woman has. I\r\n     move, then, that these series of resolutions do not appear at all\r\n     upon the journal of the Convention. If the speeches are reported,\r\n     of course the resolutions will go with them. Most journals will\r\n     report them as adopted. But I say to those who use this platform\r\n     to make speeches on this question, that they do far worse than\r\n     take more than their fair share of the time; they open a gulf\r\n     into which our distinctive movement will be plunged, and its\r\n     success postponed two years for every one that it need\r\n     necessarily be.\r\n\r\n     Of course, in these remarks, I intend no reflection upon those\r\n     whose views differ from mine in regard to introducing this\r\n     subject before the Convention; but we had an experience two years\r\n     ago on this point, and it seems to me that we might have learned\r\n     by that lesson. No question--Anti-Slavery, Temperance, Woman's\r\n     Rights--can move forward efficiently, unless it keeps its\r\n     platform separate and unmixed with extraneous issues, unmixed\r\n     with discussions which carry us into endless realms of debate. We\r\n     have now, under our present civilization, to deal with the simple\r\n     question which we propose--how to make that statute-book look\r\n     upon woman exactly as it does upon man. Under the law of Divorce,\r\n     one stands exactly like the other. All we have asked in regard to\r\n     the law of property has been, that the statute-book of New York\r\n     shall make the wife exactly like the husband; we do not go\r\n     another step, and state what that right shall be. We do not ask\r\n     law-makers whether there shall be rights of dower and\r\n     courtesy--rights to equal shares--rights to this or that interest\r\n     in property. That is not our business. All we say is, \"Gentlemen\r\n     law-makers, we represent woman; make what laws you please about\r\n     marriage and property, but let woman stand under them exactly as\r\n     man does; let sex deprive her of no right, let sex confer no\r\n     special right; and that is all we claim.\" (Applause). Society has\r\n     done that as to marriage and divorce, and we have nothing more to\r\n     ask of it on this question, as a Woman's Rights body.\r\n\r\n     ABBY HOPPER GIBBONS, of New York City, seconded the motion of Mr.\r\n     Phillips, and said that she wished the whole subject of marriage\r\n     and divorce might be swept from that platform, as it was\r\n     manifestly not the place for it.\r\n\r\n     Mr. GARRISON said he fully concurred in opinion with his friend,\r\n     Mr. Phillips, that they had not come together to settle\r\n     definitely the question of marriage, as such, on that platform;\r\n     still, he should be sorry to have the motion adopted, as against\r\n     the resolutions of Mrs. Stanton, because they were a part of her\r\n     speech, and her speech was an elucidation of her resolutions,\r\n     which were offered on her own responsibility, not on behalf of\r\n     the Business Committee, and which did not, therefore, make the\r\n     Convention responsible for them. It seemed to him that, in the\r\n     liberty usually taken on that platform, both by way of argument\r\n     and illustration, to show the various methods by which woman was\r\n     unjustly, yet legally, subjected to the absolute control of man,\r\n     she ought to be permitted to present her own sentiments. It was\r\n     not the specific object of an Anti-Slavery Convention--for\r\n     example--to discuss the conduct of Rev. Nehemiah Adams, or the\r\n     position of Stephen A. Douglas, or the course of _The York\r\n     Herald_; yet they did, incidentally, discuss all these, and many\r\n     other matters closely related to the great struggle for the\r\n     freedom of the slave. So this question of marriage came in as at\r\n     least incidental to the main question of the equal rights of\r\n     woman.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. BLACKWELL: I should like to say a few words in explanation.\r\n     I do not understand whether our friend Wendell Phillips objects\r\n     to both series of resolutions on the subject of divorce, or\r\n     merely to mine.\r\n\r\n     Mr. PHILLIPS: To both.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. BLACKWELL: I wish simply to say, that I did not come to the\r\n     Convention proposing to speak on this subject, but on another;\r\n     but finding that these resolutions were to be introduced, and\r\n     believing the subject legitimate; I said, \"I will take my own\r\n     position.\" So I prepared the resolutions, as they enabled me at\r\n     the moment better to express my thought than I could do by merely\r\n     extemporizing.\r\n\r\n     Now does this question grow legitimately out of the great\r\n     question of woman's equality? The world says, marriage is not an\r\n     alliance between equals in human rights. My whole argument was\r\n     based on the position that it is. If this question is not\r\n     legitimate, what is? Then do we not ask for laws which are not\r\n     equal between man and woman? What have we been doing here in New\r\n     York State? I spent three months asking the State to allow the\r\n     drunkard's wife her own earnings. Do I believe that the wife\r\n     ought to take her own earnings, as her own earnings? No; I do not\r\n     believe it. I believe that in a true marriage, the husband and\r\n     wife earn for the family, and that the property is the\r\n     family's--belongs jointly to the husband and wife. But if the law\r\n     says that the property is the husband's, if it says that he may\r\n     take the wages of his wife, just as the master does those of the\r\n     slave, and she has no right to them, we must seek a temporary\r\n     redress. We must take the first step, by compelling legislators,\r\n     who will not look at great principles, to protect the wife of the\r\n     drunkard, by giving her her own earnings to expend upon herself\r\n     and her children, and not allow them to be wasted by the husband.\r\n     I say that it is legitimate for us to ask for a law which we\r\n     believe is merely a temporary expedient, not based upon the great\r\n     principle of human and marriage equality. Just so with this\r\n     question of marriage. It must come upon this platform, for at\r\n     present it is a relation which legally and socially bears\r\n     unequally upon woman. We must have temporary redress for the\r\n     wife. The whole subject must be incidentally opened for\r\n     discussion. The only question is one of present fitness. Was it\r\n     best, under all the circumstances, to introduce it now? I have\r\n     not taken the responsibility of answering in the affirmative.\r\n     But it must come here and be settled, sooner or later, because\r\n     its interests are everywhere, and all human relations center in\r\n     this one marriage relation. (Applause).\r\n\r\n     SUSAN B. ANTHONY: I hope Mr. Phillips will withdraw his motion\r\n     that these resolutions shall not appear on the records of the\r\n     Convention. I am very sure that it would be contrary to all\r\n     parliamentary usage to say, that when the speeches which enforced\r\n     and advocated the resolutions are reported and published in the\r\n     proceedings, the resolutions shall not be placed there. And as to\r\n     the point that this question does not belong to this\r\n     platform,--from that I totally dissent. Marriage has ever been a\r\n     one-sided matter, resting most unequally upon the sexes. By it,\r\n     man gains all--woman loses all; tyrant law and lust reign supreme\r\n     with him--meek submission and ready obedience alone befit her.\r\n     Woman has never been consulted; her wish has never been taken\r\n     into consideration as regards the terms of the marriage compact.\r\n     By law, public sentiment and religion, from the time of Moses\r\n     down to the present day, woman has never been thought of other\r\n     than as a piece of property, to be disposed of at the will and\r\n     pleasure of man. And this very hour, by our statute-books, by our\r\n     (so called) enlightened Christian civilization, she has no voice\r\n     whatever in saying what shall be the basis of the relation. She\r\n     must accept marriage as man proffers it, or not at all.\r\n\r\n     And then again, on Mr. Phillips' own ground, the discussion is\r\n     perfectly in order, since nearly all the wrongs of which we\r\n     complain grow out of the inequality, the injustice of the\r\n     marriage laws, that rob the wife of the right to herself and her\r\n     children--that make her the slave of the man she marries.\r\n\r\n     I hope, therefore, the resolutions will be allowed to go out to\r\n     the public, that there may be a fair report of the ideas which\r\n     have actually been presented here, that they may not be left to\r\n     the mercy of the secular press. I trust the Convention will not\r\n     vote to forbid the publication of those resolutions with the\r\n     proceedings.\r\n\r\n     Rev. WM. HOISINGTON, the blind preacher: Publish all that you\r\n     have said and done here, and let the public know it.\r\n\r\n     The question was then put on the motion of Mr. Phillips, and it\r\n     was lost.\r\n\r\n     After which, the resolutions reported by the Business Committee\r\n     were adopted without dissent.\r\n\r\n     Miss MARY GREW, of Philadelphia, said: Friends, we are about to\r\n     separate. This convention was called for the consideration of one\r\n     of the most important questions before the American people. The\r\n     press may ridicule your movement, the pulpit denounce it, but, as\r\n     time rolls on, it will be seen--the press and pulpit will\r\n     see--that it is one of the most important questions that has ever\r\n     agitated the community. It is well that those who are engaged in\r\n     this movement should go forth deeply impressed with the\r\n     importance of the work that is before them. It is well that you\r\n     who have assembled from curiosity, to listen to what these\r\n     \"fanatics\" have to say, should take home with you to your souls\r\n     one thought which is sufficient to settle this whole question.\r\n     All the arguments that have been adduced against us, and against\r\n     granting to woman all her rights, come to us in one form or\r\n     another of prejudice or expediency. Talk with whom you will about\r\n     it,--the priest, politician, merchant, farmer, mechanic, and one\r\n     after another says, (you have heard them, I have heard them, we\r\n     all hear them,) to every right which woman claims, \"I grant you\r\n     that, in the abstract, you are right; but it is not expedient,\r\n     nor wise, nor safe for woman nor man, nor good for the world.\"\r\n     Let me tell you, that the man who grants that the position we\r\n     assume is, in the abstract, right, has granted all we want; and\r\n     if he is not ready to take that step of abstract right, he only\r\n     assumes to be wiser than He who made the world.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. President, I hear every day of my life, almost, the\r\n     assertion that it is fanaticism to say that it is always safe and\r\n     right to follow abstract right. This principle does not belong to\r\n     any one belief; it is the living soul of God's universe, that the\r\n     absolute right is safe. If woman has the same right as man to\r\n     read, to vote, to rule, to learn, to teach, there is nothing\r\n     further to be said about it; and I never care to argue with the\r\n     man who says it is right, but for some reason or other, it ought\r\n     not to be granted, for he has granted everything, and has no\r\n     ground left to stand upon.\r\n\r\n     Is it fanaticism to believe that God is wiser than man; that He,\r\n     \"who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the\r\n     earth,\" who \"commanded the morning, and caused the day-spring to\r\n     know its place,\" is wise enough to give laws to the universe\r\n     which it shall be safe for you and me to obey? (Applause). Into\r\n     this fanaticism this world is to be educated, if it is to be\r\n     saved from going down to moral ruin and death. Remember, then, O\r\n     man! father, husband, brother, clergyman, and\r\n     politician--remember, when these words slip so easily from your\r\n     tongues, as they often do, \"I grant you have the same abstract\r\n     right to do this that man has,\" you grant all that woman claims;\r\n     and remember, as you stand reverently in the presence of God,\r\n     that if you assert that that is not safe which He has pronounced\r\n     to be right, you claim to be wiser, not than these women or these\r\n     men who stand on the platform of the \"Woman's Rights Convention,\"\r\n     but you claim to be wiser than the Creator of man and woman.\r\n     (Applause).\r\n\r\n     Allusion was made here this morning--well and wisely made--to the\r\n     charge that when woman walks out into the avenues of public life,\r\n     there to gain a living for herself and her children, or to help\r\n     guide the nation, she ceases to be domestic, and faithful to the\r\n     cares and shrine of home. We heard something well said this\r\n     morning on the sphere of woman being the home, and we are told\r\n     that this objection to our movement was altogether dishonest,\r\n     contemptible, and ridiculous. It is not always such. Good men and\r\n     true, and sometimes wise men, also, really in their souls believe\r\n     that if a woman touches a ballot, her hand will be unfit for\r\n     domestic duties; that if she teaches in the public congregation,\r\n     she can not act well her part in the family circle. As I listened\r\n     to what was said here, the words called to my mind the image of a\r\n     woman of America, known as a religious and moral teacher, who\r\n     bears a name of which this nation will one day be proud, but now\r\n     slandered by a venal press, scorned by an arrogant pulpit,\r\n     little appreciated by the mass of men and women, for whom the\r\n     bearer of it is laboring night and day. The image of that woman\r\n     rose before me. The world regards her as a public woman, as out\r\n     of her sphere, and infers that she is neglectful of the cares and\r\n     insensible to the loveliness of domestic life; and as I\r\n     remembered her, I felt as I ever feel, that there is not a woman\r\n     who, as a representative of my own sex, I would sooner show to\r\n     the world as the embodiment of all domestic beauty and wifely\r\n     care and motherly fidelity. I only wish that they and you might\r\n     know her as I know her. I only wish that you might see in her, as\r\n     I see in her, the very best possible illustration of the power of\r\n     guiding and guarding all the sanctity of home, of blessing\r\n     husband and children and grandchildren, and exerting in the\r\n     guidance of her household an intellectual power which would be\r\n     the glory of this or any other platform. Not only do husband and\r\n     children \"rise up and call her blessed,\" but in the time to come,\r\n     the children and children's children of those who now scorn her\r\n     name--of priests who have despised it, editors who have ridiculed\r\n     and slandered it, and heaped upon it all of the ignominy of their\r\n     souls--will thank God, as they reap the benefit of her exertions\r\n     and her beautiful life, for the name of LUCRETIA MOTT.\r\n     (Applause).\r\n\r\n     The word I would impress upon you all, as you go hence, is\r\n     this--it is always safe to do right. Carry away with you from\r\n     this Convention, my friends, this one thought--God is wiser than\r\n     man. What He has made right, He has also made safe. His paths are\r\n     paths of pleasantness, and all His ways are peace. And to those\r\n     who go forward, bearing this great cause in their hands, to work\r\n     for themselves, for their sisters, for their mothers--to them I\r\n     would say, \"Be not discouraged at any obstacles that may lie in\r\n     your way! Forget, for a little while, the sneers of the press and\r\n     the pulpit, the laugh of the fashionable lady, who calls you\r\n     unladylike, and the scorn of arrogant men, who appreciate not\r\n     your labors! You need not pay back the laughter and the scorn\r\n     with scorn. Your work is too great, too high, too holy. Forgive\r\n     them, and pass on! Rejoice to think that, in a few years, they,\r\n     too, will rise up and thank you for it. Those who work for\r\n     mankind must be content not to receive their reward in the\r\n     appreciation of their services as they pass through life. It is\r\n     of little consequence. The only thing is to be sure we are doing\r\n     right, and living for some great purpose; for, of all the\r\n     afflictions that can befall a man or woman, there is none so\r\n     great as to pass through life without effecting anything--to die\r\n     and leave the world no better than we found it, never being\r\n     missed in consequence of any useful work we have done.\r\n     (Applause). No good cause can go backward. No good cause\r\n     declines. Nothing can put us down if we are right. All that we\r\n     need to sustain and strengthen us in any great work is to be\r\n     quite satisfied with the smile of God, and to have faith and hope\r\n     that man shall at last be wholly and utterly redeemed and saved.\"\r\n     (Applause).\r\n\r\n     The Convention then adjourned _sine die_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _From The New York Tribune of May 80_.\r\n\r\n                              MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE.\r\n\r\n     _To the Editor of The New York Tribune_:\r\n\r\n     SIR:--At our recent National Woman's Rights Convention many were\r\n     surprised to hear Wendell Phillips object to the question of\r\n     Marriage and Divorce, as irrelevant to our platform. He said: \"We\r\n     had no right to discuss there any laws or customs but those where\r\n     inequality existed in the sexes; that the laws on Marriage and\r\n     Divorce rested equally on man and woman; that he suffered, as\r\n     much as she possibly could, the wrongs and abuses of an\r\n     ill-assorted marriage.\"\r\n\r\n     Now, it must strike every careful thinker, that an immense\r\n     difference rests in the fact, that man has made the laws,\r\n     cunningly and selfishly, for his own purpose. From Coke down to\r\n     Kent, who can cite one clause of the marriage contract where\r\n     woman has the advantage? When man suffers from false legislation,\r\n     he has his remedy in his own hands. Shall woman be denied the\r\n     right of protest against laws in which she has had no voice--laws\r\n     which outrage the holiest affections of her nature--laws which\r\n     transcend the limits of human legislation--in a Convention called\r\n     for the express purpose of considering her wrongs? He might as\r\n     well object to a protest against the injustice of hanging a\r\n     woman, because capital punishment bears equally on man and woman.\r\n\r\n     The contract of marriage is by no means equal. The law permits\r\n     the girl to marry at twelve years of age, while it requires\r\n     several years more of experience on the part of the boy. In\r\n     entering this compact, the man gives up nothing that he before\r\n     possessed--he is a man still; while the legal existence of the\r\n     woman is suspended during marriage, and henceforth she is known\r\n     but in and through the husband. She is nameless, purseless,\r\n     childless--though a woman, an heiress, and a mother.\r\n\r\n     Blackstone says: \"The husband and wife are one, and that one is\r\n     the husband.\" Kent says: \"The legal effects of marriage are\r\n     generally deducible from the principle of the common law, by\r\n     which the husband and wife are regarded as one person, and her\r\n     legal existence and authority lost or suspended during the\r\n     continuance of the matrimonial union.\"--Vol. 2, p. 109. Kent\r\n     refers to Coke on Littleton, 112, a. 187, B. Litt. sec. 168, 291.\r\n\r\n     The wife is regarded by all legal authorities as a\r\n     \"_feme-covert_,\" placed wholly _sub potestate viri_. Her moral\r\n     responsibility, even, is merged in the husband. The law takes it\r\n     for granted that the wife lives in fear of her husband; that his\r\n     command is her highest law: hence a wife is not punishable for\r\n     theft committed in presence of her husband.--Kent, vol. 2, p.\r\n     127. An unmarried woman can make contracts, sue and be sued,\r\n     enjoy the rights of property, to her inheritance--to her\r\n     wages--to her person--to her children; but, in marriage, she is\r\n     robbed by law of all and every natural and civil right. \"The\r\n     disability of the wife to contract, so as to bind herself, arises\r\n     not from want of discretion, but because she has entered into an\r\n     indissoluble connection, by which she is placed under the power\r\n     and protection of her husband.\"--Kent, vol. 2, p. 127. She is\r\n     possessed of certain rights until she is married; then all are\r\n     suspended, to revive again the moment the breath goes out of the\r\n     husband's body.--See \"Cowen's Treatise,\" vol. 2, p. 709.\r\n\r\n     If the contract be equal, whence come the terms \"marital\r\n     power\"--\"marital rights\"--\"obedience and restraint\"--\"dominion\r\n     and control\"--\"power and protection,\" etc., etc.? Many cases are\r\n     stated, showing the exercise of a most questionable power over\r\n     the wife, sustained by the courts.--See Bishop on Divorce, p.\r\n     489.\r\n\r\n     The laws on Divorce are quite as unequal as those on Marriage;\r\n     yes, far more so. The advantages seem to be all on one side, and\r\n     the penalties on the other. In case of divorce, if the husband be\r\n     the guilty party, he still retains the greater part of the\r\n     property. If the wife be the guilty party, she goes out of the\r\n     partnership penniless.--Kent, vol. 2, p. 33; Bishop on Divorce,\r\n     p. 492.\r\n\r\n     In New York and some other States, the wife of the guilty husband\r\n     can now sue for a divorce in her own name, and the costs come out\r\n     of the husband's estate; but, in the majority of the States, she\r\n     is still compelled to sue in the name of another, as she has no\r\n     means of paying costs, even though she may have brought her\r\n     thousands into the partnership. \"The allowance to the innocent\r\n     wife of _ad interim_ alimony and money to sustain the suit, is\r\n     not regarded as strict right in her, but of sound discretion in\r\n     the court.\"--Bishop on Divorce, p. 581.\r\n\r\n     \"Many jurists,\" says Kent, vol. 2, p. 88, \"are of opinion that\r\n     the adultery of the husband ought not to be noticed or made\r\n     subject to the same animadversions as that of the wife, because\r\n     it is not evidence of such entire depravity, nor equally\r\n     injurious in its effects upon the morals, good order, and\r\n     happiness of domestic life. Montesquieu, Pothier, and Dr. Taylor\r\n     all insist that the cases of husband and wife ought to be\r\n     distinguished, and that the violation of the marriage vow, on the\r\n     part of the wife, is the most mischievous, and the prosecution\r\n     ought to be confined to the offense on her part.--\"Esprit des\r\n     Loix,\" tom. 3, 186; \"Traité du Contrat de Mariage,\" No. 516;\r\n     \"Elements of Civil Law,\" p. 254.\r\n\r\n     Say you, \"These are but the opinions of men\"? On what else, I\r\n     ask, are the hundreds of women depending, who this hour demand in\r\n     our courts a release from burdensome contracts? Are not these\r\n     delicate matters left wholly to the discretion of courts? Are not\r\n     young women from the first families dragged into the public\r\n     courts--into assemblies of men exclusively--the judges all men,\r\n     the jurors all men?--no true woman there to shield them by her\r\n     presence from gross and impertinent questionings, to pity their\r\n     misfortunes, or to protest against their wrongs?\r\n\r\n     The administration of justice depends far more on the opinions of\r\n     eminent jurists, than on law alone, for law is powerless when at\r\n     variance with public sentiment.\r\n\r\n     Do not the above citations clearly prove inequality? Are not the\r\n     very letter and spirit of the marriage contract based on the idea\r\n     of the supremacy of man as the keeper of woman's virtue--her sole\r\n     protector and support? Out of marriage, woman asks nothing at\r\n     this hour but the elective franchise. It is only in marriage that\r\n     she must demand her rights to person, children, property, wages,\r\n     life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. How can we discuss\r\n     all the laws and conditions of marriage, without perceiving its\r\n     essential essence, end, and aim? Now, whether the institution of\r\n     marriage be human or divine, whether regarded as indissoluble by\r\n     ecclesiastical courts, or dissoluble by civil courts, woman,\r\n     finding herself equally degraded in each and every phase of it,\r\n     always the victim of the institution, it is her right and her\r\n     duty to sift the relation and the compact through and through,\r\n     until she finds out the true cause of her false position. How can\r\n     we go before the Legislatures of our respective States, and\r\n     demand new laws, or no laws, on divorce, until we have some idea\r\n     of what the true relation is?\r\n\r\n     We decide the whole question of slavery by settling the sacred\r\n     rights of the individual. We assert that man can not hold\r\n     property in man, and reject the whole code of laws that conflicts\r\n     with the self-evident truth of that assertion.\r\n\r\n     Again I ask, is it possible to discuss all the laws of a\r\n     relation, and not touch the relation itself?\r\n\r\n                         Yours respectfully,\r\n                                           ELIZABETH CADY STANTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n           HORACE GREELEY in _The New York Tribune_, May 14, 1860.\r\n\r\n     _One Thousand Persons Present, seven-eighths of them Women, and a\r\n     fair Proportion Young and Good-looking_.--Whether the Woman's\r\n     Rights Convention will finally succeed or not in enlarging the\r\n     sphere of woman, they have certainly been very successful in\r\n     enlarging that of their platform. Having introduced easy Divorce\r\n     as one of the reforms which the new order of things demands, we\r\n     can see no good reason why the platform should not be altogether\r\n     replanked. We respectfully suggest that with this change of\r\n     purpose there shall also be a change in name, and that hereafter\r\n     these meetings shall be called not by name of Woman, but in the\r\n     name of Wives Discontented. Hitherto we have supposed that the\r\n     aim of this movement related to wrongs which woman suffered as\r\n     woman, political and social inequalities, and disabilities with\r\n     which she was mightily burdened. A settlement of the marriage\r\n     relation, we conceive, does not come within this category. As\r\n     there can be no wives without husbands, the subject concerns the\r\n     latter quite as much as it does the former. One of the wrongs\r\n     which it is charged woman suffers from man, is that he legislates\r\n     for her when she is not represented. We acknowledge the justice\r\n     of that plea, and, for that very reason, complain that she, under\r\n     the name of Woman's Rights, should attempt to settle a question\r\n     of such vital importance to him where he is supposed to be\r\n     admitted only on suffrance. We believe in woman's rights; we have\r\n     some conclusions(?) on the rights of husbands and wives; we are\r\n     not yet, we confess, up to that advanced state which enables us\r\n     to consider the rights of wives as something apart from that of\r\n     husbands.\r\n\r\n     On the subject of marriage and divorce we have some very positive\r\n     opinions, and what they are is pretty generally known. But even\r\n     were they less positive and fixed, we should none the less\r\n     protest against the sweeping character of the resolutions\r\n     introduced at the Woman's Rights Convention on Friday by Mrs.\r\n     Elizabeth Cady Stanton. We can not look upon the marriage\r\n     relation as of no more binding force than that which a man may\r\n     make with a purchaser for the sale of dry-goods, or an engagement\r\n     he may contract with a schoolmaster or governess. Such doctrine\r\n     seems to us simply shocking.\r\n\r\n     The intimate relation existing between one man and one woman,\r\n     sanctified by, at least, the memory of an early and sincere\r\n     affection, rendered more sacred by the present bond of dependent\r\n     children, the fruit of that love, hallowed by many joys and many\r\n     sorrows, though they be only remembered joys and sorrows, with\r\n     other interests that can be broken in upon only to be\r\n     destroyed--such a relation, we are very sure, has elements of\r\n     quite another nature than those which belong to the shop or the\r\n     counting-house. In our judgment, the balance of duty can not be\r\n     struck like the balance of a mercantile statement of profit and\r\n     loss, or measured with the calculations we bestow on an account\r\n     current. Such a doctrine we regard as pernicious and debasing. We\r\n     can conceive of nothing that would more utterly sap the\r\n     foundations of sound morality, or give a looser rein to the most\r\n     licentious and depraved appetites of the vilest men and women.\r\n     Upon the physiological and psychological laws which govern\r\n     generation, we do not care here to enter, even if Mrs. Stanton\r\n     leads the way; but we believe that the progress of the world,\r\n     springing out of connections formed under such a dispensation of\r\n     humanity as is here indicated, with so little of duty or\r\n     conscience, with so little hope or expectation of abiding\r\n     affection, with so little intention of permanency as must\r\n     necessarily belong to them, would be more monstrous than the\r\n     world has ever dreamed of. For such a rule of married life\r\n     contemplates no married life at all, and no parental relation. It\r\n     destroys the family; it renders the dearest word in the Saxon\r\n     tongue (home) a vague and unmeaning term; it multiplies a\r\n     thousand-fold and renders universal all the evils which in the\r\n     imperfections of human nature are now occasional under the\r\n     binding force of a moral sense, the duty of continency, and the\r\n     remnant of nothing else is left of love.\r\n\r\n     There are some other things besides in these resolutions to which\r\n     we might object on the score of truth, some things which we\r\n     rather marvel, modest women should say, and that modest women, in\r\n     a mixed assembly, should listen to with patience. But these are\r\n     secondary matters. The thought--more than them all--that the\r\n     marriage tie is of the same nature as a mere business relation,\r\n     is so objectionable, so dangerous, that we do not care to draw\r\n     attention from that one point.\r\n\r\nIn asserting that marriage is an equal relation for husbands and\r\nwives, Mr. Greeley, like Mr. Phillips, begs the whole question. If it\r\nis legitimate to discuss all laws that bear unequally on man and woman\r\nin woman's rights conventions, surely those that grow out of marriage,\r\nwhich are the most oppressive and degrading on the statute-book,\r\nshould command our first consideration. There could be no slaveholders\r\nwithout slaves; the one relation involves the other, and yet it would\r\nbe absurd to say that slaves might not hold a convention to discuss\r\nthe inequality of the laws sustaining that relation, and incidentally\r\nthe whole institution itself, because the slaveholder shared in the\r\nevils resulting from it. There never has been a woman's convention\r\nheld in which the injustice suffered by wives and mothers has not been\r\na topic for discussion, and legitimately so. And if the only way of\r\nescape from the infamous laws by which all power is placed in the\r\nhands of man, is through divorce, then that is the hospitable door to\r\nopen for those who wish to escape. No proposition contained in Mrs.\r\nStanton's speech on divorce, viewed in any light, can be a tenth part\r\nso shocking as the laws on the statute-books, or the opinions\r\nexpressed by many of the authorities in the English and American\r\nsystems of jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to comprehend that the release of the miserable from\r\nfalse relations, would necessarily seduce the contented from happy\r\nones, or that the dearest word in the Saxon tongue (home) should have\r\nno significance, after drunkards and villains were denied the right to\r\nenter it. It is a pleasant reflection, in view of the dolorous results\r\nMr. Greeley foresees from the passage of a divorce law, that the love\r\nof men and women for each other and their children in no way depends\r\non the Statutes of New York. In the State of Indiana, where the laws\r\nhave been very liberal for many years, family life is as beautiful and\r\npermanent as in South Carolina and New York, where the tie can be\r\ndissolved for one cause only. When we consider how little protection\r\nthe State throws round the young and thoughtless in entering this\r\nrelation, stringent laws against all escape are cruel and despotic,\r\nespecially to woman, for if home life, which is everything to her, is\r\ndiscordant, where can she look for happiness?\r\n\r\n                      APPEAL TO THE WOMEN OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n     WOMEN OF NEW YORK:--Once more we appeal to you to make renewed\r\n     efforts for the elevation of our sex. In our marital laws we are\r\n     now in advance of every State in the Union. Twelve years ago New\r\n     York took the initiative step, and secured to married women their\r\n     property, received by gift or inheritance. Our last Legislature\r\n     passed a most liberal act, giving to married women their rights,\r\n     to sue for damages of person or property, to their separate\r\n     earnings and their children; and to the widow, the possession and\r\n     control of the entire estate during the minority of the youngest\r\n     child. Women of New York! You can no longer be insulted in the\r\n     first days of your widowed grief by the coarse minions of the law\r\n     at your fireside, coolly taking an inventory of your household\r\n     goods, or robbing your children of their natural guardian.\r\n\r\n     While we rejoice in this progress made in our laws, we see also a\r\n     change in the employment of women. They are coming down from the\r\n     garrets and up from the cellars to occupy more profitable posts\r\n     in every department of industry, literature, science, and art. In\r\n     the church, too, behold the spirit of freedom at work. Within the\r\n     past year, the very altar has been the scene of well-fought\r\n     battles; women claiming and exercising their right to vote in\r\n     church matters, in defiance of precedent, priest, or Paul.\r\n\r\n     Another evidence of the importance of our cause is seen in the\r\n     deep interest men of wealth are manifesting in it. Three great\r\n     bequests have been given to us in the past year. Five thousand\r\n     dollars from an unknown hand,[171] a share in the munificent fund\r\n     left by that noble man of Boston, Charles F. Hovey, and four\r\n     hundred thousand dollars by Mr. Vassar, of Poughkeepsie, to found\r\n     a college for girls, equal in all respects to Yale and Harvard.\r\n     Is it not strange that women of wealth are constantly giving\r\n     large sums of money to endow professorships and colleges for boys\r\n     exclusively--to churches and to the education of the ministry,\r\n     and yet give no thought to their own sex--crushed in ignorance,\r\n     poverty, and prostitution--the hopeless victims of custom, law,\r\n     and Gospel, with few to offer a helping hand, while the whole\r\n     world combine to aid the boy and glorify the man?\r\n\r\n     Our movement is already felt in the Old World. The nobility of\r\n     England, with Lord Brougham at their head, have recently formed a\r\n     \"Society for Promoting the Employments of Women.\"\r\n\r\n     All this is the result of the agitation, technically called\r\n     \"Woman's Rights,\" through conventions, lectures, circulation of\r\n     tracts and petitions, and by the faithful word uttered in the\r\n     privacy of home. The few who stand forth to meet the world's cold\r\n     gaze, its ridicule, its contumely, and its scorn, are urged\r\n     onward by the prayers and tears, crushed hopes and withered\r\n     hearts of the sad daughters of the race. The wretched will not\r\n     let them falter; and they who seem to do the work, ever and anon\r\n     draw fresh courage and inspiration from the noblest women of the\r\n     age, who, from behind the scene, send forth good words of cheer\r\n     and heartfelt thanks.\r\n\r\n     Six years hence, the men of New York purpose to revise our State\r\n     Constitution. Among other changes demanded, is the right of\r\n     suffrage for women--which right will surely be granted, if\r\n     through all the intervening years every woman does her duty.\r\n     Again do we appeal to each and all--to every class and\r\n     condition--to inform themselves on this question, that woman may\r\n     no longer publish her degradation by declaring herself satisfied\r\n     in her present position, nor her ignorance by asserting that she\r\n     has \"all the rights she wants.\"\r\n\r\n     Any person who ponders the startling fact that there are four\r\n     millions of African slaves in this republic, will instantly put\r\n     the question to himself, \"Why do these people submit to the cruel\r\n     tyranny that our government exercises over them?\" The answer is\r\n     apparent--\"simply because they are ignorant of their power.\"\r\n     Should they rise _en masse_, assert and demand their rights,\r\n     their freedom would be secure. It is the same with woman. Why is\r\n     it that one-half the people of this nation are held in abject\r\n     dependence--civilly, politically, socially, the slaves of man?\r\n     Simply because woman knows not her power. To find out her natural\r\n     rights, she must travel through such labyrinths of falsehood,\r\n     that most minds stand appalled before the dark mysteries of\r\n     life--the seeming contradictions in all laws, both human and\r\n     divine. But, because woman can not solve the whole problem to her\r\n     satisfaction, because she can not prove to a demonstration the\r\n     rottenness and falsehood of our present customs, shall she,\r\n     without protest, supinely endure evils she can not at once\r\n     redress? The silkworm, in its many wrappings, knows not it yet\r\n     shall fly. The woman, in her ignorance, her drapery, and her\r\n     chains, knows not that in advancing civilization, she too must\r\n     soon be free, to counsel with her conscience and her God.\r\n\r\n     The religion of our day teaches that in the most sacred relations\r\n     of the race, the woman must ever be subject to the man; that in\r\n     the husband centers all power and learning; that the difference\r\n     in position between husband and wife is as vast as that between\r\n     Christ and the church; and woman struggles to hold the noble\r\n     impulses of her nature in abeyance to opinions uttered by a\r\n     Jewish teacher, which, alas! the mass believe to be the will of\r\n     God. Woman turns from what she is taught to believe are God's\r\n     laws to the laws of man; and in his written codes she finds\r\n     herself still a slave. No girl of fifteen could read the laws,\r\n     concerning woman, made, executed, and defended by those who are\r\n     bound to her by every tie of affection, without a burst of\r\n     righteous indignation. Few have ever read or heard of the\r\n     barbarous laws that govern the mothers of this Christian\r\n     republic, and fewer still care, until misfortune brings them into\r\n     the iron grip of the law. It is the imperative duty of educated\r\n     women to study the Constitution and statutes under which they\r\n     live, that when they shall have a voice in the government, they\r\n     may bring wisdom and not folly into its councils.\r\n\r\n     We now demand the ballot, trial by jury of our peers, and an\r\n     equal right to the joint earnings of the marriage copartnership.\r\n     And, until the Constitution be so changed as to give us a voice\r\n     in the government, we demand that man shall make all his laws on\r\n     property, marriage, and divorce, to bear equally on man and\r\n     woman.\r\n\r\n                                    { E.

B.--Let every friend commence to get signatures to the\r\n     petition without delay, and send up to Albany early in January,\r\n     either to your representative or to Lydia Mott.\r\n\r\n     How can any wife or mother, who to-day rejoices in her legal\r\n     right to the earnings of her hands, and the children of her love,\r\n     withhold the small pittance of a few hours or days in getting\r\n     signatures to the petition, or a few shillings or dollars to\r\n     carry the work onward and upward, to a final glorious\r\n     consummation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVENTION IN ALBANY AND HEARING BEFORE THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE IN THE\r\nASSEMBLY CHAMBER.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 7TH AND 8TH, 1861.\r\n\r\nThe last Convention before the War was held in Albany. Ernestine L.\r\nRose, Lucretia Mott, William Lloyd Garrison, Rev. Beriah Green, Aaron\r\nM. Powell, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony were the\r\nspeakers. They had a hearing also before the Judiciary Committee on\r\nthe bill then pending asking divorce for various causes.[173] The\r\ninterest in the question was intense at this time, owing to several\r\nvery aggravated cases among leading families, both in this country and\r\nEngland. The very liberal bill pending in the Legislature had drawn\r\nspecial attention to it in the Empire State, which not only made the\r\nwhole question of marriage and divorce a topic of conversation at\r\nevery fireside, but of many editorial debates in our leading journals.\r\nAmong others, Horace Greeley, in _The New York Tribune_, had a\r\nprolonged discussion with the Hon. Robert Dale Owen,[174] in which it\r\nwas generally thought that the weight of argument rested with Mr.\r\nOwen; but it was evident that Mr. Greeley did not think so, as he\r\nafterward republished the whole controversy at his own expense. _The\r\nAlbany Evening Journal_ also took strong grounds against the bill. But\r\nthe opponents invariably discussed the question on the basis that\r\nmarriage was an _equal_ relation, in which man suffered as much as\r\nwoman, ignoring the fact that _man_ had made the laws governing it,\r\nand all to his own advantage.\r\n\r\nFrom the following letter of Lucretia Mott, we see how clear she was\r\nas to the merits of the position we had taken in the discussion of\r\nthis vital question:\r\n\r\n                      ROADSIDE, near Philadelphia, 4th Mo., 30th, '61.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR LYDIA MOTT:--I have wished ever since parting with thee\r\n     and our other dear friends in Albany to send thee a line, and\r\n     have only waited in the hope of contributing a little\r\n     \"substantial aid\" toward your neat and valuable \"depository.\" The\r\n     twenty dollars enclosed is from our Female Anti-Slavery Society.\r\n\r\n     I see the annual meeting in New York is not to be held this\r\n     spring. Sister Martha is here, and was expecting to attend both\r\n     anniversaries. But we now think the Woman's Rights meeting had\r\n     better not be attempted, and she has written Elizabeth C. Stanton\r\n     to this effect.\r\n\r\n     I was well satisfied with being at the Albany meeting. I have\r\n     since met with the following from a speech of Lord Brougham's,\r\n     which pleased me, as being as radical as mine in your stately\r\n     Hall of Representatives:\r\n\r\n     \"Before woman can have any justice by the laws of England, there\r\n     must be a total reconstruction of the whole system; for any\r\n     attempt to amend it would prove useless. The great charter, in\r\n     establishing the supremacy of law over prerogative, provides only\r\n     for justice between man and man; for woman nothing is left but\r\n     common-law, accumulations and modifications of original Gothic\r\n     and Roman heathenism, which no amount of filtration through\r\n     ecclesiastical courts could change into Christian laws. They are\r\n     declared unworthy a Christian people by great jurists; still they\r\n     remain unchanged.\"\r\n\r\n     So Elizabeth Stanton will see that I have authority for going to\r\n     the root of the evil.\r\n\r\n     We had a delightful golden-wedding on the 10th inst. All our\r\n     children and children's children were present, and a number of\r\n     our friends hereaway. Our sister Mary W. Hicks and her grand\r\n     daughter May were all of James's relatives from New York. Brother\r\n     Richard and daughter Cannie could not feel like coming. Brother\r\n     Silas and Sarah Cornell could not come.\r\n\r\n                                   Love to all,\r\n                                                    LUCRETIA MOTT.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 came \"the war of the rebellion,\" the great conflict between\r\nthe North and the South, the final struggle between freedom and\r\nslavery. The women who had so perseveringly labored for their own\r\nenfranchisement now gave all their time and thought to the nation's\r\nlife; their patriotism was alike spontaneous and enduring. In the\r\nsanitary movement, in the hospitals, on the battle-field, gathering in\r\nthe harvests on the far-off prairies--all that heroic women dared and\r\nsuffered through those long dark years of anxiety and death, should\r\nhave made \"justice to woman\" the spontaneous cry on the lips of our\r\nrulers, as we welcomed the return of the first glad days of peace. All\r\nspecific work for her own rights she willingly thrust aside. No\r\nConventions were held for five years; no petitions circulated for her\r\ncivil and political rights; the action of State Legislatures was\r\nwholly forgotten. In their stead, Loyal Leagues were formed, and\r\npetitions by the hundred thousand for the emancipation of the slaves\r\nrolled up and sent to Congress--a measure which with speech and pen\r\nthey pressed on the nation's heart, seeing clearly as they did that\r\nthis was the pivotal point of the great conflict.\r\n\r\nThus left unwatched, the Legislature of New York amended the law of\r\n1860, taking from the mother the lately guaranteed right to the equal\r\nguardianship of her children, replacing it by a species of veto power,\r\nwhich did not allow the father to bind out or will away a child\r\nwithout the mother's consent in writing. The law guaranteeing the\r\nwidow the control of the property, which the husband should leave at\r\ndeath, for the care and protection of minor children, was also\r\nrepealed. This cowardly act of the Legislature of 1862[175] is the\r\nstrongest possible proof of woman's need of the ballot in her own\r\nhand for protection. Had she possessed the power to make and unmake\r\nlegislators, no State Assembly would have dared thus to rob the mother\r\nof her natural rights. But without the suffrage she was helpless.\r\nWhile, in her loyalty to the Government and her love to humanity, she\r\nwas encouraging the \"boys in blue\" to fight for the freedom of the\r\nblack mothers of the South, these dastardly law-makers, filled with\r\nthe spirit of slaveholders, were stealing the children and the\r\nproperty of the white mothers in the Empire State!\r\n\r\nWhen Susan B. Anthony heard of the repeal of 1862, she was filled with\r\nastonishment, and wrote thus to Miss Lydia Mott:\r\n\r\n     DEAR LYDIA:--Your startling letter is before me. I knew some\r\n     weeks ago that that abominable thing was on the calendar, with\r\n     some six or eight hundred bills _before it_, and hence felt sure\r\n     it would not come up this winter, and that in the meantime we\r\n     should sound the alarm. Well, well; while the old guard sleep the\r\n     young \"devils\" are wide-awake, and we deserve to suffer for our\r\n     confidence in \"man's sense of justice,\" and to have all we have\r\n     gained thus snatched from us. But nothing short of this can rouse\r\n     our women again to action. All our reformers seem suddenly to\r\n     have grown politic. All alike say, \"Have no conventions at this\r\n     crisis\"! Garrison, Phillips, Mrs. Mott, Mrs. Wright Mrs. Stanton,\r\n     etc., say, \"Wait until the war excitement abates\"; which is to\r\n     say, \"Ask our opponents if they think we had better speak, or,\r\n     rather, if they do not think we had better remain silent.\" I am\r\n     sick at heart, but I can not carry the world against the wish and\r\n     the will of our best friends. But what can we do now, when even\r\n     the motion to retain the mother's joint guardianship is voted,\r\n     down? Twenty thousand petitions rolled up for that--a hard year's\r\n     work!--the law secured!--the echoes of our words of gratitude in\r\n     the capitol have scarce died away, and now all is lost!\r\n\r\nAnd, worse still, in 1871,[176] after the black man was not only\r\nemancipated, but enfranchised, by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth\r\nAmendments, which, overriding State Constitution and statute law,\r\nabolished the property qualification for colored voters in the State\r\nof New York, another step of retrogressive legislation was taken\r\nagainst woman, in the repeal of section nine[177] of the Act of 1860,\r\nre-enacting the spirit and letter of the old common law, which holds\r\nthat the children born in legal wedlock belong to the father alone.\r\nHad woman held the ballot--that weapon of protection--in her hand to\r\npunish legislators, by withholding her vote from those thus derelict\r\nto duty, no repeal of the law of 1860 could have possibly taken place.\r\n\r\n                                              ALBANY, _April 8, 1881_.\r\n\r\n     DEAR MISS ANTHONY:--Your esteemed favor of the 6th duly received.\r\n\r\n     The Statute of 1862, Laws of 1862, chapter 90, page 157, repealed\r\n     the grandest and crowning section of the Statute of 1860, viz:\r\n     Sections 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11, copies of which sections I\r\n     herewith inclose you. Had these sections remained, wives in this\r\n     State would have possessed equal rights with their husbands, save\r\n     simply the right of voting. It was a great mistake and wrong to\r\n     repeal them. Had I been a member of the Senate at that time, as I\r\n     was not, I don't think it would have been done.\r\n\r\n     I do not know who was the author of the repeal bill, nor did I\r\n     know of its existence until I saw it in the statute-book. I think\r\n     Judge Charles J. Folger, now Chief-Justice of the Court of\r\n     Appeals, was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the\r\n     bill of 1862 must therefore have passed through the hands of that\r\n     Committee, in which it originated, or through which it was\r\n     reported, and by the influence of which it must have been\r\n     adopted.\r\n\r\n     Strange that you women, so watchful and so regardful of your\r\n     rights, should have allowed the repeal of those important\r\n     sections, without strenuous opposition.\r\n\r\n                                   Very sincerely yours,\r\n                                                 ANDREW J. COLVIN.\r\n\r\nWe were busily engaged rolling up petitions for the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment to the Federal Constitution, our hearts and hands full of\r\nwork for the Government in the midst of the war, supposing all was\r\nsafe at Albany. But how comes it that the author of the bill of 1860,\r\nresiding at the capital, never heard of its repeal? If the bill was so\r\nslyly passed that Mr. Colvin himself did not know of it until he saw\r\nit in the statute-book, it is not remarkable that it escaped our\r\nnotice in time to prevent it.\r\n\r\n                                      GENENA, N. Y., _April 12, 1881_.\r\n\r\n     MISS ANTHONY, DEAR MADAM:--I was chairman of the Judiciary\r\n     Committee of the New York Senate in 1862-'3-'4-'5-'6-'7-'8-'9.\r\n     Judge John Willard, of Saratoga County, was a member of the State\r\n     Senate in that year, and a member of that Committee. He was the\r\n     author of the Act of 1862. His object, as I have always\r\n     understood it, was to simplify, make clear, consistent, and\r\n     practical some of the legislation in regard to married women. I\r\n     think, with deference I say it, that you are not strictly\r\n     accurate in calling the legislation of 1862 a repealing one. The\r\n     first section of the Act of 1862 (chap. 172, p. 343) _amends_ the\r\n     third section of the Act of 1860 (chap. 90, p. 157), by striking\r\n     out the provision requiring the assent of the husband, and giving\r\n     the wife the right (or privilege) to contract and convey as a\r\n     _feme sole_, and to covenant for title, etc., etc. That amendment\r\n     rendered unnecessary the fourth, fifth, and sixth sections of the\r\n     Act of 1860. They would have fallen of themselves, that is, have\r\n     been repealed by implication, as inconsistent with the greater\r\n     power and freedom attained by married women by the amendment of\r\n     1862 to the Act of 1860. But _ex abundanti cautela_, as Judge\r\n     Willard would have said, there was an express repeal of them. The\r\n     tenth and eleventh sections of the Act of 1860 were also repealed\r\n     expressly; but not to the sole detriment of married women. The\r\n     tenth section gave to married men and married women a life estate\r\n     in certain cases in one-third of all the real estate of which the\r\n     wife or husband died seized. The wife had before the Act of 1860,\r\n     and has now, that estate. The tenth section gave her nothing. The\r\n     repeal of it took nothing from her. The eleventh section, so far\r\n     as it gave a life estate, is the same as the tenth. So far as it\r\n     gave the use of all the real estate of the intestate for the\r\n     minority of the youngest child, it was an addition to the\r\n     property rights of the wife, but it was also an addition to the\r\n     property rights of the husband. I am not able from memory to say\r\n     why it was repealed; and it is remembrance and not reasoning that\r\n     you ask for. The third section of the Act of 1862 amends the\r\n     seventh of the Act of 1860 by striking out the phrase, \"_except\r\n     her husband_,\" thus enabling a married woman to protect the\r\n     property given to her by the husband, in which the Act of 1860\r\n     was lame, and in other ways gave more freedom and power to\r\n     married women. The fourth section of the Act of 1862 amends the\r\n     eighth section of the Act of 1860, but only in its verbiage. The\r\n     fifth section of the Act of 1862 does not impair the Act of 1860;\r\n     it simply puts the woman before the courts, and the law as an\r\n     entity able to go alone. The sixth section of the Act of 1862\r\n     increases the powers of a married woman, by giving her a veto on\r\n     some acts of her husband. The seventh section is like the fifth.\r\n     In no other respect than those I have named did the Act of 1862\r\n     affect the Act of 1860. In but one thing did it repeal, in the\r\n     sense of taking away any right or power or privilege or freedom\r\n     that the Act of 1860 gave. On the contrary, in some respects, it\r\n     gave more or greater.\r\n\r\n     I am glad that you wrote to me. I am glad that I have the\r\n     opportunity to defend the memory of a good man, Judge John\r\n     Willard. I make bold to ask you to turn to the thirty-seventh\r\n     volume of Barbour's Supreme Court Reports, Appendix, pp. 670 et\r\n     seq., and read the words spoken of him by his peers. I am glad\r\n     also to have the opportunity to speak a word for my Judiciary\r\n     Committee.\r\n\r\n     And I will not close this lengthened answer, without suggesting a\r\n     suspicion, that those who have taken the notion that the Act of\r\n     1862 was a retrograde step, have done so without comparing for\r\n     themselves the two acts.\r\n\r\n     For myself, I have the distinction of being one of less than\r\n     half-a-dozen Senators who voted that women have the right to vote\r\n     for delegates to the Constitutional Convention of 1866; and one\r\n     of about a dozen and a half members of that Convention who voted\r\n     to erase from the suffrage article the word \"male.\" I have never\r\n     been convinced of the expediency of giving to females the\r\n     privilege of suffrage; but I have never been able to see the\r\n     argument by which they were not as much entitled to the _right_\r\n     as males.\r\n\r\n     Trusting that you will forgive the length of this epistle,\r\n\r\n                         I am with respect, yours, etc., etc.,\r\n                                                CHARLES J. FOLGER.\r\n     MISS SUSAN B. ANTHONY.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen by the above letters, both Mr. Colvin and Mr. Folger\r\nmake mistakes in regard to the effect of these bills. In speaking of\r\nthe complete equality of husbands and wives under the law of 1860, Mr.\r\nColvin said, \"All the wife then had to ask was the right of suffrage,\"\r\nquite forgetting that the wife has never had an equal right to the\r\njoint earnings of the copartnership, as no valuation has ever been\r\nplaced on her labor in the household, to which she gives all her time,\r\nthought, and strength, the absolute sacrifice of herself, mind and\r\nbody, all possibility of self-development and self-improvement being\r\nin most cases out of the question. Mr. Folger in saying the repeal of\r\nsection eleven affected man as much as woman, falls into the same\r\nmistake, assuming that the joint earnings belong to man. We say that\r\nthe wife who surrenders herself wholly to domestic life, foregoing all\r\nopportunities for pecuniary independence and personal distinction in\r\nthe world of work, or the higher walks of literature and art, in order\r\nto make it possible for the husband to have home and family ties, and\r\nat the same time, his worldly successes and ambitions, richly earns\r\nthe place of an equal partner. In their joint accumulations, her labor\r\nand economy should be taken into account.\r\n\r\nThis is _the vital point_ of interest to the vast majority of married\r\nwomen, since it is only the _few_ who ever possess anything through\r\nseparate earnings or inheritance. A law securing to the wife the\r\nabsolute right to one-half the joint earnings, and at the death of the\r\nhusband, the same control of property and children that he has when\r\nshe dies, might make some show of justice; but it is a provision not\r\nyet on the statute-books of any civilized nation on the globe.\r\n\r\nThe seeming sophistry of Judge Folger may be traced to the universal\r\nfact that man does not appreciate the arduous and unremitting labors\r\nof the wife in the household, or her settled dissatisfaction in having\r\nno pecuniary recompense for her labors. No man with cultured brain and\r\nskilled hands would consider himself recompensed for a life of toil in\r\nbeing provided with shelter, food, and clothes while his employer was\r\nliving, to be cut down in his old age to a mere pittance; yet such is\r\nthe fate of the majority of wives and widows under the most beneficent\r\nprovisions of our statutes in this favored republic. True, the law\r\nsays \"the husband shall maintain the wife in accordance with his\r\ncircumstances\"; he being judge, jury, executive. Though she may toil\r\nincessantly, and her duties be far more exhaustive than his, yet he is\r\nsupposed to maintain her, and the joint property is always disposed of\r\non that basis. Legislation for woman proceeds on the assumption, that\r\nall she needs is a bare support; and that she is destitute of the\r\nnatural human desire to accumulate, possess, and control the results\r\nof her own labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE (with autograph).]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[89] Jerry McHenry was an athletic mulatto, a cooper by trade, who had\r\nbeen living in Syracuse for many years, since his escape from slavery.\r\nOn the 13th of October, 1850, there was an attempt to kidnap him, but\r\nthe Abolitionists, with such men as Samuel J. May and Gerrit Smith at\r\ntheir head, succeeded in rescuing him by a _coup d'état_, from the\r\nofficers of the law, which involved several trials in Auburn,\r\nCanandaigua, Buffalo, and Albany. As this occurred soon after the\r\npassage of the Fugitive Slave Law, the leading Abolitionists were\r\ndetermined to test its constitutionality in the courts. It was so\r\nsystematically and universally violated, that it soon became a dead\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n[90] A HEROIC WOMAN.--Mrs. Margaret Freeland, of Syracuse, was\r\nrecently arrested upon a warrant issued on complaint of Emanuel\r\nRosendale, a rum-seller, charging her with forcing an entrance to his\r\nhouse, and with stones and clubs smashing his doors and windows,\r\nbreaking his tumblers and bottles, and turning over his whisky barrels\r\nand spilling their contents. Great excitement was produced by this\r\nnovel case. It seems that the husband of Mrs. Freeland was a\r\ndrunkard--that he was in the habit of abusing his wife, turning her\r\nout of doors, etc., and this was carried so far that the police\r\nfrequently found it necessary to interfere to put a stop to his\r\nill-treatment of his family. Rosendale, the complainant, furnished\r\nFreeland with the liquor which turned him into a demon. Mrs. Freeland\r\nhad frequently told him of her sufferings and besought him to refrain\r\nfrom giving her husband the poison. But alas! she appealed to a heart\r\nof stone. He disregarded her entreaties and spurned her from his door.\r\nDriven to desperation she armed herself, broke into the house, drove\r\nout the base-hearted landlord and proceeded upon the work of\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nShe was brought before the court and demanded a trial. The citizens\r\nemployed Charles B. Sedgwick, Esq., as her counsel, and prepared to\r\njustify her assault upon legal grounds. Rosendale, being at once\r\narrested on complaint of Thomas L. Carson for selling liquor\r\nunlawfully, and feeling the force of the storm that was gathering over\r\nhis head, appeared before the Justice, withdrew his complaint against\r\nMrs. Freeland, paid the costs, and gave bail on the complaint of Mr.\r\nCarson, to appear at the General Sessions, and answer to an indictment\r\nshould there be one found.\r\n\r\nMrs. Freeland is said to be \"the pious mother of a fine family of\r\nchildren, and a highly respectable member of the Episcopal Church.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Carson League_ commenting on this affair says:\r\n\r\n\"The rum-seller cowered in the face of public feeling. This case shows\r\nthat public feeling will justify a woman whose person or family is\r\noutraged by a rum-seller, for entering his grocery or tavern and\r\ndestroying his liquor. If the law lets loose a tiger upon her, she may\r\ndestroy it. She has no other resort but force to save herself and her\r\nchildren. Were the women of this city to proceed in a body and destroy\r\nall the liquor of all the taverns and groceries, they would be\r\njustified by law and public opinion. Women should take this war into\r\ntheir hands, when men take side with the murderers of their peace.\r\n\r\n\"A tavern or grocery which makes the neighbors drunken and insane is a\r\npublic nuisance, and may be pulled down and destroyed by the neighbors\r\nwho are injured by it. It is worse than the plague. And if men will\r\nnot put hands on it, then should the women do it. Tell us not it is\r\nproperty. It ceases to be property when it is employed to destroy the\r\npeople. If a man lights his torch and sets about putting fire to the\r\nhouses about him, any person may seize the torch and destroy it. So if\r\na man takes a pistol and passes through the streets shooting the\r\npeople, the pistol ceases to be property and may be taken from him by\r\nforce and destroyed by any person who can do it. We sincerely hope\r\nthat the women of the State will profit by this example, and go to\r\ndestroying the liquor vessels; and their contents.\" To all of which we\r\nrespond AMEN.\r\n\r\n                                             _The Lily_, June, 1853.\r\n\r\n[91] Mrs. Thompson, of Albany; Mrs. Cushman, of New York,\r\n_Vice-Presidents_.

She was _equal_ if not _identical_. Whatever may be\r\nthought of her notions, or sense of propriety in her bold and\r\nconspicuous positions, personally, intellectually, and socially\r\nspeaking, there can be but one opinion as to her superior ability,\r\nenergy, and moral courage; and she may well be regarded as an evangel\r\nand heroine by her sex; especially by the \"Strong Minded\" portion of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[103] _The Daily Standard_, Sept. 8th, 1852, said: The Woman's Rights\r\nConvention will assemble at the City Hall this morning. Some of the\r\nmost able women of the country will be present, and the discussion can\r\nnot fail to be particularly interesting.\r\n\r\n_The Daily Star_, a pro-slavery paper of the most pronounced and\r\nreckless character, said: The women are coming! They flock in upon us\r\nfrom every quarter, all to hear and talk about Woman's Rights. The\r\nblue stockings are as thick as grasshoppers in hay-time, and mighty\r\nwill be the force of \"jaw-logic\" and \"broom-stick ethics\" preached by\r\nthe females of both sexes.\r\n\r\n[104] THE NATIONAL WOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nThe friends of equality, justice, and truth are earnestly invited to\r\nmeet in Syracuse, N. Y., Sept. 8th, 9th, and 10th, 1852, to discuss\r\nthe important question of \"Woman's Rights.\" We propose to review not\r\nonly the past and consider the present, but to mark out new and\r\nbroader paths for the future.\r\n\r\nThe time has come for the discussion of woman's social, civil, and\r\nreligious rights, and also for a thorough and efficient organization;\r\na well-digested plan of operation whereby these social rights, for\r\nwhich our fathers fought, bled, and died, may be secured by us. Let\r\nwoman no longer supinely endure the evils she may escape, but with her\r\nown right hand carve out for herself a higher, nobler destiny than has\r\nheretofore been hers. Inasmuch as through the folly and imbecility of\r\nwoman, the race is what it is, dwarfed in mind and body; and as\r\nthrough her alone it can yet be redeemed, all are equally interested\r\nin the objects of this Convention.\r\n\r\nWe therefore solemnly urge those men and women who desire the\r\nelevation of humanity, to be present at the coming Convention, and aid\r\nus by their wisdom. Our platform will be free to all who are capable\r\nof discussing the subject with candor and truth.

At his elegant dinners distinguished Southerners\r\nwere frequent guests. Hence it was said of him that he dined with\r\nslaveholders, and would have wined with them but for his temperance\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\n[110] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[111] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[112] This noble man was among the first to append his name to the\r\ndeclaration of rights issued at Seneca Falls, and he did not withdraw\r\nit when the press began to ridicule the proceedings of the Convention.\r\n\r\n[113] Rev. Mr. Hatch gave his idea of female loveliness. It consisted\r\nin that shrinking delicacy which, like the modest violet, hid itself\r\nuntil sought; that modesty which led women to blush, to cast down\r\ntheir eyes when meeting men, or walking up the aisle of a church to\r\ndrop the veil; to wear long skirts, instead of imitating the\r\nsun-flower, which lifted up its head, seeming to say: \"Come and admire\r\nme.\" He repeated the remarks made near the door on some of the\r\nspeakers. The President hoped he would keep in order, and not relate\r\nthe vulgar conversation of his associates. He went on in a similar\r\nstrain until the indignation of the audience became universal, when he\r\nwas summarily stopped.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his remarks Miss Anthony suggested that the Reverend\r\ngentleman doubtless belonged to the pin-cushion ministry, educated by\r\nwomen's sowing societies! which, on inquiry, proved true. It was\r\nalmost always the case that the \"poor but pious\" young man, who had\r\nstudied his profession at the expense of women, proved most narrow and\r\nbigoted in his teachings.\r\n\r\n[114] The Jewish.\r\n\r\n[115] See Appendix for comments of _Syracuse Star_ and _New York\r\nHerald_.\r\n\r\n[116] This sermon was reviewed by Matilda Joslyn Gage, and a newspaper\r\ncontroversy between Mr. Sunderland, Mrs. Gage, and others inaugurated.\r\nFor several months the press of the city was enlivened by these\r\nsupplementary debates.\r\n\r\n[117] _President._--Lucretia Mott.\r\n\r\n_Vice-Presidents._--Ernestine L.

It is the husband's\r\nright during his life to the use of the wife's real estate from her\r\ndeath, in case of a child or children born of the marriage. It is\r\ndefeasible now by the wife's will.--Cow. Rep. 74, 2 K. S., 4th Ed.\r\n331. Tenancy by right of dower is the wife's right during her life to\r\nthe use of one-third of the husband's real estate from his death. It\r\noperates in favor of the wife and not in favor of the husband, and is\r\nindefeasible by the husband's will or the husband's acts while living,\r\nand does not depend upon the birth of a child by the marriage.\r\n\r\nThe order of distribution of the husband's personal property on his\r\ndeath is as follows, viz.: 1st, the widow of a family takes articles\r\nexempt from execution as hers, also $150 worth of property besides.\r\n2d, she has one-third of the personal property, absolutely--if there\r\nbe no children, one-half, and if there be no parent or descendant, she\r\nis entitled, of the residue, to $2,000, and if also no brother,\r\nsister, nephew, or niece, all the residue. This order may be varied or\r\ndefeated by his will.\r\n\r\nThe order of distribution of the wife's personal property on her death\r\nwithout will is as follows: It goes, after paying her debts, to her\r\nhusband, if living; if not, then 1st, to her children, 2d to her\r\nfather, 3d to her mother, 4th to her collateral relatives. This order\r\nmay be varied or defeated by her will. She may devise it as she may\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nHis property before marriage continues his after marriage, subject to\r\nher inchoate rights of dower.\r\n\r\nHer property before marriage continues hers absolutely.\r\n\r\nUpon marriage he is liable to support her, and may be compelled to do\r\nit if he prove refractory.\r\n\r\nShe is not liable to support him, however wealthy she may be, or poor\r\nhe may be.\r\n\r\nHe is liable to support the children. She is not so liable, though\r\npossessed of millions.\r\n\r\nThe husband is the guardian of the wife, as against third persons.\r\n(Page 488). But he has no power to preserve, retain, or regain the\r\ncustody of her against her will. (Page 47).\r\n\r\nHe may maintain his action against third persons for enticing her away\r\nor harboring her. But this harboring, to be actionable, must be more\r\nthan a mere permission to her to stay with such third person. (4 Barb.\r\n225).\r\n\r\nIf the husband seek to take away his wife by force, it is an assault\r\nand battery upon her. If a third person, resists such force at her\r\nrequest he is not liable to any action. (Barb. 156).\r\n\r\nThe wife is not the husband's guardian, but if he will desert her he\r\nmay be put under bonds for her support and the support of her children\r\nby him. (2 Rev. Stat., 4th Ed., pp. 53, 54).\r\n\r\nThe husband is liable for the debts of the wife contracted before\r\nmarriage, but only now to the extent of her property received by him.\r\n(7 W. R. 237, 1st Chitty Pl., 66 to 68, laws of 1853). And he is\r\nliable for her debts contracted during marriage, if permitted by him,\r\nor if for necessaries which he neglected to provide.\r\n\r\nThe wife is not liable for her husband's debts contracted at any time.\r\n\r\nThe law casts the custody of the minor children upon the father and\r\nnot upon the mother. But if this custody is abused, it is by the Court\r\nto the mother.\r\n\r\nThe father may appoint a guardian for his infant children. (2 Rev.\r\nStat. 33.) But the Court will not allow such guardian to take the\r\nchildren out of the State against the mother's will, much less to\r\nseparate them unjustly from the mother even though the father's will\r\ncommand it. (5, page 596).\r\n\r\nDuring the separation of husband and wife, it is for the court now to\r\ndecide, under the circumstances of each case, whether father or mother\r\nhas such custody. (2 R. S. 330, 332).\r\n\r\nWhen both seek such custody, and both are equally qualified for it,\r\nthat of daughters and young children is usually given to the mother,\r\nand that of the sons to the father, but this is in the discretion of\r\nthe Court.\r\n\r\nThe earnings of the husband are his. The earnings of the wife are his,\r\nif she live with him and he support her.\r\n\r\nBut he can not compel her to work for him. And if she separate from\r\nhim for cause, he may be restrained for intermeddling with her\r\nearnings.\r\n\r\nThe husband's abandonment and his refusal or neglect to provide for\r\nher, are good causes of separation. (2 R. S. 329, sec. 53, sub. 3).\r\n\r\nFor the husband's torts the wife is not liable. For the wife's torts,\r\ncommitted by her before marriage or during marriage the husband is\r\nliable jointly with the wife. If committed by the wife and husband, or\r\ncommitted by the wife in his presence and without objecting, the\r\nhusband is liable alone. (1 Chitty Pl., 105, 7th American edition).\r\nNay, even felonies (excepting murder, manslaughter, treason, and\r\nrobbery), are excusable in the wife if committed in the husband's\r\npresence and by his coercion--and such coercion is presumed from his\r\npresence. For this he must suffer and she must be spared. (Barb. Crim.\r\nLaw, 247 and 348, and cases there cited).\r\n\r\nIn actions or lawsuits between men and women, the law in theory claims\r\nto be impartial, but in practice it has not been impartial. Before a\r\nCourt of male judges or a jury of men the bias is in favor of the\r\nwoman; and if she is pleasing, in person and manners, such bias is\r\nsometimes pretty strong.\r\n\r\nIf the man and woman between whom litigation arises are husband and\r\nwife, the Court may accord an allowance to be advanced by her husband,\r\nto enable her to defray the expenses of the litigation.\r\n\r\n[125] WOMAN'S RIGHTS.--_Circulate the Petitions_.--The design of the\r\nConvention held last week in Rochester, was to bring the subject of\r\nWoman's legal and civil disabilities, in a dignified form, before the\r\nLegislature of New York. Convinced, as the friends of the movement\r\nare, that in consistency with the principles of Republicanism,\r\nfemales, equally with males, are entitled to Freedom, Representation,\r\nand Suffrage, and confident as they are that woman's influence will be\r\nfound to be as refining and elevating in public as all experience\r\nproves it to be in private, they claim that one-half of the people and\r\ncitizens of New York should no longer be governed by the other half,\r\nwithout consent asked and given. Encouraged by reforms already made,\r\nin the barbarous usages of common law, by the statutes of New York,\r\nthe advocates of woman's just and equal rights demand that this work\r\nof reform be carried on, until every vestige of partiality is removed.\r\nIt is proposed, in a carefully prepared address to specify the\r\nremaining legal disabilities from which the women of this State\r\nsuffer; and a hearing is asked before a joint committee of both\r\nHouses, specially empowered to revise and amend the statutes. Now is\r\nthis movement right in principle? Is it wise in policy? Should the\r\nfemales of New York be placed on a level of equality with males before\r\nthe law? If so, let us petition for impartial justice to Women. In\r\norder to ensure this equal justice should the females of New York,\r\nlike the males, have a voice in appointing the law-makers and\r\nlaw-administrators? If so let us petition for Woman's right to\r\nSuffrage. Finally, what candid man will be opposed to a reference of\r\nthe whole subject to the Representatives of New York, whom the men of\r\nNew York themselves elected. Let us then petition for a hearing before\r\nthe Legislature. A word more, as to the petitions, given below. They\r\nare two in number; one for the Just and Equal Rights of Woman; one for\r\nWoman's Right to Suffrage. It is designed that they should be signed\r\nby men and women, of lawful age--that is, of twenty-one years and\r\nupwards. The following directions are suggested: 1. Let persons, ready\r\nand willing, sign each of the petitions; but let not those, who desire\r\nto secure Woman's Just and Equal Rights, hesitate to sign that\r\npetition because they have doubts as to the right or expediency of\r\nwomen's voting. The petitions will be kept separate, and offered\r\nseparately. All fair-minded persons, of either sex, ought to sign the\r\nfirst petition. We trust that many thousands are prepared to sign the\r\nsecond also. 2. In obtaining signatures, let men sign in one column,\r\nand women in another parallel column. 3. Let the name of the town and\r\ncounty, together with the number of signatures, be distinctly entered\r\non the petitions before they are returned. 4. Let every person, man or\r\nwoman, interested in this movement, instantly and energetically\r\ncirculate the petitions in their respective neighborhoods. We must\r\nsend in the name of every person in the State, who desires full\r\njustice to woman, so far as it is possible. Up then, friends, and be\r\ndoing, to-day. 5. Let no person sign either petition but once. As many\r\npersons will circulate petitions in the same town and county, it is\r\nimportant to guard against this possible abuse. 6. Finally, let every\r\npetition be returned to Rochester, directed to the Secretary of the\r\nConvention, Susan B. Anthony, on the first of February, without fail.\r\nIn behalf of the Business Committee.\r\n\r\n                                           WILLIAM HENRY CHANNING.\r\nROCHESTER, _Dec. 8, 1853_.\r\n\r\nPETITION FOR THE JUST AND EQUAL RIGHTS OF WOMEN.--The Legislature of\r\nthe State of New York have, by the Acts of 1848 and 1849, testified\r\nthe purpose of the people of this State to place married women on an\r\nequality with married men, in regard to the holding, conveying, and\r\ndevising of real and personal property. We, therefore, the undersigned\r\npetitioners, inhabitants of the State of New York, male and female,\r\nhaving attained to the legal majority, believing that women, alike\r\nmarried and single, do still suffer under many and grievous legal\r\ndisabilities, do earnestly request the Senate and Assembly of the\r\nState of New York to appoint a Joint Committee of both Houses, to\r\nrevise the Statutes of New York, and to propose such amendments as\r\nwill fully establish the legal equality of women with men; and we\r\nhereby ask a hearing before such Committee by our accredited\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nPETITION FOR WOMAN'S RIGHT TO SUFFRAGE.--Whereas, according to the\r\nDeclaration of our National Independence, governments derive their\r\njust powers from the consent of the governed, we earnestly request the\r\nLegislature of New York to propose to the people of the State such\r\namendments of the Constitution of the State as will secure to females\r\nan equal right to the Elective Franchise with males; and we hereby ask\r\na hearing before the Legislature by our accredited Representatives.\r\n\r\nN.

Any married woman whose husband, from drunkenness, profligacy, or\r\nany other cause, shall neglect and refuse to provide for her support\r\nand education, or the support and education of her children, and any\r\nmarried woman who may be deserted by her husband, shall have the\r\nright, by her own name, to receive and collect her own earnings, and\r\napply the same for her own support, and the support and education of\r\nher children, free from the control and interference of her husband,\r\nor from any person claiming to be released from the same by and\r\nthrough her husband.\r\n\r\n2. Hereafter it shall be necessary to the validity of any indenture of\r\napprenticeship executed by the father, that the mother of such child,\r\nif she be living, shall, in writing, consent to such indentures; nor\r\nshall any appointment of a general guardian of the person of a child\r\nby the father be valid, unless the mother of such child, if she be\r\nliving, shall, in writing, consent to such appointment.\r\n\r\n[128] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n[129] Ernestine L. Rose, Francis D. Gage, Hannah Tracy Cutler, Lucy N.\r\nColeman, Antoinette L. Brown, Matilda Joslyn Gage, Marietta Richmond,\r\nSarah Pellet, Carrie D. Filkins, Lydia A. Jenkins, Susan B. Anthony,\r\ndividing their time and forces, held conventions in nearly every\r\ncounty of the State, traversing some new section each year. In 1859,\r\nMiss Anthony and Miss Brown made a successful tour of the fashionable\r\nresorts and the northern counties. All this work the State Committee\r\nassigned to its General Agent, giving her all honor and power, without\r\nproviding one dollar. But Miss Anthony with rare executive ability,\r\naccomplished the work and paid all expenses.--E. C. S.\r\n\r\n[130] It is pleasant to record that a few years later Mr. Beecher's\r\nvision was clear on the whole question, and he was often found on the\r\nwoman's rights platform, not only speaking himself, but his sister,\r\nMrs. Isabella Beecher Hooker, also. On one occasion he conducted Miss\r\nKate Field to the platform in Plymouth Church as gracefully as he ever\r\nhanded a lady out to dinner, introduced her to the audience, and\r\npresided during her address. Sitting there he seemed to feel as much\r\nat his ease as if Col. Robert G. Ingersoll had been the speaker.\r\n\r\n[131] As this meeting was hastily decided upon, there was no call\r\nissued; it was merely noticed in the county papers. _The Saratoga\r\nWhig_, August 18, 1854, says:\r\n\r\nWOMEN'S RIGHTS.--The series of conventions that have been holding\r\nsessions in the village during the week, will close this day with a\r\nmeeting for the discussion of the social, legal, and political rights\r\nof women, at which Miss Susan B. Anthony, Mrs. Matilda Joslyn Gage,\r\nand Miss Sarah Pellet will appear. The meetings will be held at St.\r\nNicholas Hall this afternoon at 3 and a half o'clock, and in the\r\nevening at 8 o'clock.\r\n\r\n[132] Any one but the indomitable Susan B. Anthony would have\r\nabandoned all idea of a meeting, but, as it was advertised, she felt\r\nbound to make it a fact. This decision may seem the more remarkable in\r\nview of other facts, that Miss Anthony had but little experience as a\r\nspeaker, and was fully aware of her deficiencies in that line; her\r\nforte lay in planning conventions, raising money, marshalling the\r\nforces, and smoothing the paths for others to go forward, make the\r\nspeeches, and get the glory. Having listened in St. Nicholas Hall for\r\nseveral days to some of the finest orators in the country, it was with\r\ngreat trepidation that she resolved to attempt to hold such audiences\r\nas had crowded all the meetings during the week, and would no doubt\r\ncontinue to do so. However, she had one written speech, which she\r\ndecided to divide, giving the industrial disabilities of women in the\r\nafternoon, and their political rights in the evening, supplementing\r\neach with whatever extemporaneous observations might strike her mind\r\nas she proceeded. With Mrs. Gage to speak at one session and Miss\r\nPellet at the other, Miss Anthony rounded out both meetings to the\r\ngeneral satisfaction. It was thus she always stood ready for every\r\nemergency; when nobody else would or could speak she did; when\r\neverybody wished to speak she was silent.--E. C. S.\r\n\r\n[133] _The Daily Saratogian_. August 19th, said: Mrs. Matilda Joslyn\r\nGage, a medium-sized, lady-like looking woman, dressed in a tasty\r\nplum-colored silk with two flounces, made the first address upon some\r\nof the defects in the marriage laws, quoting Story, Kent, and\r\nBlackstone. She closed by speaking of Mrs. Marcet, an able writer on\r\npolitical economy, her book much used in schools. She referred to Miss\r\nPinckney, of South Carolina, who in nullification times, wrote\r\npowerfully on that subject. It was said that party was consolidated by\r\nthe nib of a lady's pen. She was the first woman in the United States\r\nwho was honored with a public funeral.\r\n\r\n[134] _President_.--Martha C. Wright, of Auburn.\r\n\r\n_Vice-Presidents_.--Rev. Samuel J. May, Syracuse; Lydia Mott, Albany;\r\nErnestine L. Rose, New York; Antoinette L. Brown, New York; Susan B.\r\nAnthony, Rochester; Augusta A.

Hovey, of Boston; Phebe Merritt, of Michigan;\r\nHon. William Hay, of Saratoga Springs.\r\n\r\n[135] Now the successful editor of _Harper's Bazar_.\r\n\r\n[136] This year Miss Anthony canvassed the State, holding conventions\r\nin fifty-four counties, organizing societies, getting signatures to\r\npetitions, and subscribers to _The Una_. At some of these meetings\r\nMrs. Rose, Miss Brown, and Miss Filkins assisted by turn, but the\r\nchief part she carried through alone. She had posters for the entire\r\nState printed in Rochester, her father, brother Merritt, and Mary\r\nLuther folding and superscribing to all the postmasters and the\r\nsheriff of every county. The sheriffs, with but few exceptions, opened\r\nthe Court Houses for the meetings, posted the bills, and attended to\r\nthe advertising. Miss Anthony entered on this work without the pledge\r\nof a dollar. But with free meetings and collections in the afternoon,\r\nand a shilling admission in the evening, she managed to cover the\r\nentire expenses of the campaign.\r\n\r\n[137] WOMEN'S RIGHTS PETITION.\r\n\r\n_To the Honorable, the Senate and Assembly of the State of New York_:\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, the women of the State of New York are recognized as citizens\r\nby the Constitution, and yet are disfranchised on account of sex; we\r\ndo respectfully demand the right of suffrage; a right which involves\r\nall other rights of citizenship, and which can not be justly withheld,\r\nwhen we consider the admitted principles of popular government, among\r\nwhich are the following:\r\n\r\n1st. That all men are born free and equal.\r\n\r\n2d. That government derives its just powers from the consent of the\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\n3d. That taxation and representation should go together.\r\n\r\n4th. That those held amenable to laws should have a share in framing\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWe do, therefore, petition that you will take the necessary steps so\r\nto revise the Constitution of our State, as that all her citizens may\r\nenjoy equal political privileges.\r\n\r\n[138] The committee were Susan B. Anthony, Ernestine L. Rose,\r\nAntoinette L. Brown, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Martha C. Wright, Lydia\r\nMott.\r\n\r\n[139] At the close of this Convention, Charles F. Hovey, as was his\r\nusual custom, planned an excursion for those who had taken part in the\r\nmeetings. He invited them to take a drive to the lake, a few miles out\r\nof Saratoga, gave them a bountiful repast, and together they spent a\r\nday rich in pleasant memories. Listening day after day to the wrongs\r\nperpetrated on woman by law and Gospel of man's creation, Mr. Hovey\r\nalways seemed to feel that he was in duty bound to throw what sunshine\r\nand happiness he could into the lives of women, and thus in a measure\r\natone for the injustice of his sex, and most royally he did this\r\nwhenever an opportunity offered, not only while he lived, but by\r\nbequests at his death.\r\n\r\n[140] Twenty years after this Mrs. Stanton met a lady in Texas, who\r\ntold her about this Saratoga Convention. She said her attention was\r\nfirst called to the subject of woman's rights by some tracts a friend\r\nof hers, then living in Georgia, brought home at that time, and that\r\nwe could form but little idea of the intense interest with which they\r\nwere read and discussed by quite a circle of ladies, who plied her\r\naunt with innumerable questions about the Convention and the\r\nappearance and manners of the ladies who led the movement.\r\n\r\n[141] It is now over forty years that the various branches of the\r\nHutchinson family have been singing the liberal ideas of their day on\r\nthe anti-slavery, temperance, and Woman's Rights platforms, and they\r\nare singing still (1881) with the infusion of some new blood in the\r\nsecond and third generation. Only one year ago traveling in Kansas, on\r\na dreary night train, with no sleeping car attached, I had worried\r\nthrough the weary hours until three o'clock in the morning, when the\r\ncars stopped at Fort Scott. I was slowly pacing up and down the aisle,\r\nwhen in came Asa Hutchinson, violin in hand, and a troop of boys and\r\ngirls behind him. There we stood face to face, both well on the shady\r\nside of sixty-five, our locks as white as snow, each thinking the\r\nother was too old for such hard journeys, he still singing, I still\r\npreaching \"equal rights to all.\" \"Well,\" said I, \"Asa, this is a very\r\nunchristian hour for you to be skylarking over the prairies of\r\nKansas.\" \"Ah!\" said he, dolorously, \"this is no skylarking; we sung\r\nlast night until near eleven o'clock, shook hands, and talked until\r\ntwelve; arose about two, waited an hour at a cold depot, and we all\r\nfeel as cross as bears.\" \"I can sympathize with you,\" I replied; \"I\r\nspent the hours until twelve as you did, entertaining my countrymen\r\nand women, and have been trying to rest ever since.\" In talking over\r\nold times until the day dawned we forgot our fatigue, and as I left\r\nthe cars they gave me a parting salute with the \"good time coming.\"\r\nHow well I remember the power of the young Hutchinsons in the old mob\r\ndays; four brothers and one sister standing side by side on the\r\nplatform in Faneuil Hall, Boston. So hated were the Abolitionists and\r\ntheir doctrines, that not even Wendell Phillips or Abby Kelly could\r\nget a hearing, but when the sweet singers from the old Granite State\r\ncame forward silence reigned, to be broken, however, the moment the\r\nlast notes of harmony died upon their lips.

S.\r\n\r\n[142] Saratoga, Niagara, and Trenton Falls; Clifton, Avon, Sharon, and\r\nBallston Springs, Lake George, etc. In making the tour In 1859, Miss\r\nBrown and Miss Anthony had some recherché out-door meetings in the\r\ngroves of Clifton and Trenton that were highly praised by the press\r\nand the people, and in the long summer days most charming to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n[143] The speakers were Samuel J.

Fremont's campaign.\r\n\r\n[148] Mrs. Jessie Benton Fremont.\r\n\r\n[149] 1. _Resolved_, That the close of a Presidential election affords\r\na peculiarly appropriate occasion to renew the demands of woman for a\r\nconsistent application of Democratic principles.\r\n\r\n2. _Resolved_, That the Republican Party, appealing constantly,\r\nthrough its orators, to female sympathy, and using for its most\r\npopular rallying cry a female name, is peculiarly pledged by\r\nconsistency, to do justice hereafter in those States where it holds\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n3. _Resolved_, That the Democratic Party must be utterly false to its\r\nname and professed principles, or else must extend their application\r\nto both halves of the human race.\r\n\r\n4. _Resolved_, That the present uncertain and inconsistent position of\r\nwoman in our community, not fully recognized either as a slave or as\r\nan equal, taxed but not represented, authorized to earn property but\r\nnot free to control it, permitted to prepare papers for scientific\r\nbodies but not to read them, urged to form political opinions but not\r\nallowed to vote upon them, all marks a transitional period in human\r\nhistory which can not long endure.\r\n\r\n5. _Resolved_, That the main power of the woman's rights movement lies\r\nin this: that while always demanding for woman better education,\r\nbetter employment, and better laws, it has kept steadily in view the\r\none cardinal demand for the right of suffrage; in a democracy the\r\nsymbol and guarantee of all other rights.\r\n\r\n6. _Resolved_, That the monopoly of the elective franchise, and\r\nthereby all the powers of legislative government by man, solely on the\r\nground of sex, is a usurpation, condemned alike by reason and\r\ncommon-sense, subversive of all the principles of justice, oppressive\r\nand demoralizing in its operation, and insulting to the dignity of\r\nhuman nature.\r\n\r\n7. _Resolved_, That while the constant progress of law, education, and\r\nindustry prove that our efforts for women in these respects are not\r\nwasted, we yet proclaim ourselves unsatisfied, and are only encouraged\r\nto renewed efforts, until the whole be gained.\r\n\r\n[150] During the struggle to extend slavery into that free State.\r\n\r\n[151] Jeannette Brown Heath, daughter of Nathan Brown, of Montgomery\r\nCounty, New York. She traveled with Abby Kelly at one time as a\r\ncompanion. Jeannette was a famous horsewoman; the young ladies of the\r\ncounty thought themselves well off when they could purchase a steed\r\nthat she had trained for the saddle. I remember many an escapade in my\r\nyouth on a full-blooded black horse from Jeannette's equery, as I\r\nlived in her neighborhood; she is now residing with two sons and one\r\ndaughter in Rochester, N.

Whipple, and their survivors and survivor, for them to use\r\nand expend, at their discretion, without any responsibility to any\r\none, for promotion of the Anti-Slavery cause and other reforms, such\r\nas Woman's Rights, Non-Resistance, Free Trade and Temperance, at their\r\ndiscretion; and I request said Wendell Phillips and his said\r\nassociates to expend not less than eight thousand dollars annually, by\r\nthe preparation and circulation of books, newspapers, employing\r\nagents, and the delivery of lectures that will, in their judgment,\r\nchange public opinion, and secure the abolition of Slavery in the\r\nUnited States, and promote said other reforms. Believing that the\r\nchain upon four millions of slaves, with tyrants at one end and\r\nhypocrites at the other, has become the strongest bond of the Union of\r\nthe States, I desire said Phillips and his associates to expend said\r\nbequest by employing such agents as believe and practice the doctrine,\r\nof \"No union with slaveholders, religiously or politically\"; and by\r\ncirculating such publications as tend to destroy every pro-slavery\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 17. In case chattel slavery should be abolished in the United\r\nStates before the expenditure of the said residue of my estate, as\r\nstated in said sixteenth article of this Will; then, in that case, I\r\ndesire that the unexpended part of said residue be applied by said\r\nPhillips and his associates, in equal proportions, for the promotion\r\nof Non-Resistance, Woman's Rights and Free Trade; requesting that no\r\nagents be employed by them for the promotion of said causes, except\r\nsuch as believe it wrong to have any voluntary connection with any\r\ngovernment of violence, and such as believe that the natural rights of\r\nmen and women are equal. Whether slavery be abolished or not, I desire\r\nthat a part of the said residue of my estate may be applied to the\r\npromotion of the kindred causes of Temperance, Woman's Rights,\r\nNon-Resistance and Free Trade, at the discretion of the said Phillips\r\nand his associates.\r\n\r\nARTICLE 22. I particularly request that no prayers be solicited from\r\nany person, and that no priest be invited to perform any ceremony\r\nwhatever, over or after my body. The Priesthood are an order of men,\r\nas I believe, falsely assuming to be reverend and divine, pretending\r\nto be called of God; the great body of them in all countries have been\r\non the side of power and oppression; the world has been too long\r\ncheated by them; the sooner they are unmasked, the better for\r\nhumanity. As I have heretofore borne my testimony against slavery,\r\nintemperance, war, tariffs and all indirect taxation, banks and all\r\nmonopolies, I desire to leave on record my abhorrence of them all. The\r\nfear of being buried before I am dead is slight, nevertheless it is\r\ngreater than the fear of death itself. I therefore request my\r\nexecutors not to bury my body until at least three days after my\r\ndecease. In witness whereof, I have hereto set my hand and seal, this\r\ntwenty-eighth day of March, in the year eighteen hundred and\r\nfifty-nine.\r\n\r\n                                             CHARLES F.

And that you\r\nwill enact laws securing to married women the full and entire control\r\nof all property originally belonging to them, and of their earnings\r\nduring marriage; and making the rights of the wife over the children\r\nthe same as a husband enjoys, and the rights of a widow, as to her\r\nchildren, and as to the property left by her husband, the same that a\r\nhusband has in the property and over the children of his deceased\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n[160] Lydia Mott, in writing to a friend, says: \"I have heard but one\r\nopinion about the merits of the address and the manner of its\r\ndelivery, and the press is very complimentary. It was better that one\r\nlike Mrs. Stanton should speak on the occasion than two, unless the\r\nother might have been Wendell Phillips. Mr. Mayo expressed himself\r\nthoroughly satisfied; the whole effect was grand. Even old Father\r\nWoolworth stood the whole time, and very often he would nod assent at\r\ncertain points. The House was packed, but so still that not one word\r\nwas lost. It was worth as much to our cause as our whole Convention,\r\nthough we could not have spared either.\"\r\n\r\n[161] AN ACT CONCERNING THE RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES OF HUSBAND AND\r\nWIFE.\r\n\r\nPassed March 20, 1860.\r\n\r\n_The People of the State of New York, represented in Senate and\r\nAssembly, do enact as follows:_\r\n\r\nSECTION 1. The property, both real and personal, which any married\r\nwoman now owns, as her sole and separate property; that which comes to\r\nher by descent, devise, bequest, gift, or grant; that which she\r\nacquires by her trade, business, labor, or services, carried on or\r\nperformed on her sole or separate account; that which a woman married\r\nin this State owns at the time of her marriage, and the rents, issues,\r\nand proceeds of all such property, shall notwithstanding her marriage,\r\nbe and remain her sole and separate property, and may be used,\r\ncollected, and invested by her in her own name, and shall not be\r\nsubject to the interference or control of her husband, or liable for\r\nhis debts, except such debts as may have been contracted for the\r\nsupport of herself or her children, by her as his agent.\r\n\r\n§ 2. A married woman may bargain, sell, assign, and transfer her\r\nseparate personal property, and carry on any trade or business, and\r\nperform any labor or services on her sole and separate account, and\r\nthe earnings of any married woman from her trade, business, labor, or\r\nservices shall be her sole and separate property, and may be used or\r\ninvested by her in her own name.\r\n\r\n§ 3. Any married woman possessed of real estate as her separate\r\nproperty may bargain, sell, and convey such property, and enter into\r\nany contract in reference to the same; but no such conveyance or\r\ncontract shall be valid without the assent, in writing, of her\r\nhusband, except as hereinafter provided.\r\n\r\n§ 4. In case any married woman possessed of separate real property, as\r\naforesaid, may desire to sell or convey the same, or to make any\r\ncontract in relation thereto, and shall be unable to procure the\r\nassent of her husband as in the preceding section provided, in\r\nconsequence of his refusal, absence, insanity, or other disability,\r\nsuch married woman may apply to the County Court in the county where\r\nshe shall at the time reside, for leave to make such sale, conveyance,\r\nor contract, without the assent of her husband.\r\n\r\n§ 5. Such application may be made by petition, verified by her, and\r\nsetting forth the grounds of such application. If the husband be a\r\nresident of the county and not under disability from insanity or other\r\ncause, a copy of said petition shall be served upon him, with a notice\r\nof the time when the same will be presented to the said court, at\r\nleast ten days before such application. In all other cases, the County\r\nCourt to which such application shall be made, shall, in its\r\ndiscretion, determine whether any notice shall be given, and if any,\r\nthe mode and manner of giving it.\r\n\r\n§ 6. If it shall satisfactorily appear to such court, upon\r\napplication, that the husband of such applicant has willfully\r\nabandoned his said wife, and lives separate and apart from her, or\r\nthat he is insane, or imprisoned as a convict in any state prison, or\r\nthat he is an habitual drunkard, or that he is in any way disabled\r\nfrom making a contract, or that he refuses to give his consent without\r\ngood cause therefor, then such court shall cause an order to be\r\nentered upon its records, authorizing such married woman to sell and\r\nconvey her real estate, or contract in regard thereto without the\r\nassent of her husband, with the same effect as though such conveyance\r\nor contract had been made with his assent.\r\n\r\n§ 7. Any married woman may, while married, sue and be sued in all\r\nmatters having relation to her property, which may be her sole and\r\nseparate property, or which may hereafter come to her by descent,\r\ndevise, bequest, or the gift of any person except her husband, in the\r\nsame manner as if she were sole. And any married woman may bring and\r\nmaintain an action in her own name, for damages against any person or\r\nbody corporate, for any injury to her person or character, the same as\r\nif she were sole; and the money received upon the settlement of any\r\nsuch action, or recovered upon a judgment, shall be her sole and\r\nseparate property.\r\n\r\n§ 8. No bargain or contract made by any married woman, in respect to\r\nher sole and separate property, or any property which may hereafter\r\ncome to her by descent, devise, bequest, or gift of any person except\r\nher husband, and no bargain or contract entered into by any married\r\nwoman in or about the carrying on of any trade or business under the\r\nstatutes of this State, shall be binding upon her husband, or render\r\nhim or his property in any way liable therefor.\r\n\r\n§ 9. Every married woman is hereby constituted and declared to be the\r\njoint guardian of her children, with her husband, with equal powers,\r\nrights, and duties in regard to them, with the husband.\r\n\r\n§ 10. At the decease of husband or wife, leaving no minor child or\r\nchildren, the survivor shall hold, possess, and enjoy a life estate in\r\none-third of all the real estate of which the husband or wife died\r\nseized.\r\n\r\n§ 11. At the decease of the husband or wife intestate, leaving minor\r\nchild or children, the survivor shall hold, possess, and enjoy all the\r\nreal estate of which the husband or wife died seized, and all the\r\nrents, issues, and profits thereof during the minority of the youngest\r\nchild, and one-third thereof during his or her natural life.\r\n\r\n[162] On the final passage of the bill the following Senators, as _The\r\nJournal_ shows, voted in favor of the measure, viz: Senators Abell,\r\nBell, Colvin, Conally, Fiero, Goss, Hillhouse, Kelly, Lapham,\r\nSessions, Manierre, Montgomery, Munroe, P. P. Murphy, Truman, Prosser,\r\nRamsey, Robertson, Rotch, Warner, Williams--21.\r\n\r\n[163] _President._--Martha Wright, of Auburn, New York.\r\n\r\n_Vice-Presidents._--Abby Hopper Gibbons, of New York; Asa Fairbanks,\r\nof Rhode Island; Rev. Antoinette Brown Blackwell, of New Jersey;\r\nThomas Garrett, of Delaware; Wendell Phillips, of Massachusetts;\r\nRobert Purvis, of Pennsylvania; J.

Cady Stanton, Mary Grew, and Wendell Phillips.\r\n\r\n[164] In the Scotch Presbyterian Church at Johnstown, N. Y., there was\r\ngreat excitement at one time on the question of temperance, the pastor\r\nbeing a very active friend to that movement. The opposition were\r\ndetermined to get rid of him, and called a church meeting for that\r\npurpose. To the surprise of the leading men of the congregation, the\r\nwomen came in force, armed with ballots, to defeat their proposed\r\nmeasures. When the time came to vote, according to arrangement, my\r\nmother headed the line marching up to the altar, where stood the\r\ndeacon, hat in hand, to receive the ballots. As soon as he saw the\r\nwomen coming, he retreated behind the railing in the altar, closing\r\nthe little door after him, which the women deliberately opened, and\r\nsoon filled the space, completely surrounding the _inspector of\r\nelection_, and, whichever way he turned, the ballots were thrown into\r\nthe hat; and, when all had voted, my mother put her hand into the hat\r\nand stirred them up with the men's votes, so that it would be\r\nimpossible to separate them. The pastor, representing the interests of\r\ntemperance, had a large majority for his retention. But the men\r\ndeclared the election void because of the illegal voting, and,\r\nbarricading the women out, with closed doors, voted their own measures\r\nthe next day. Rev. Jeremiah Wood presided on the occasion, and whilst\r\nthe women were contending for their rights under the very shadow of\r\nthe altar, he recited various Scriptural texts on woman's sphere, to\r\nwhich these rebellious ones paid not the slightest attention. One\r\ndignified Scotch matron, looking him steadily in the face, indignant,\r\nat the behavior of the men, said with sternness and emphasis: \"I\r\nprotest against such high-handed proceedings.\" The result of this\r\noutbreak, was a decree by the Judicature of the Church, \"that the\r\nwomen of the congregation should have the right to vote in all\r\nbusiness matters,\" which they have most judiciously done ever since.\r\nE. C. S.\r\n\r\n[165] Frances D. Gage, Hannah Tracy Cutler, J. Elizabeth Jones,\r\nAntoinette Brown Blackwell, Lucy N. Colman, and Susan B. Anthony.\r\n\r\n[166] Mrs. Roberts and her daughters in Niagara County.\r\n\r\n[167] _Resolved_, That inasmuch as man, in the progress of his\r\ndevelopment, found that at each advancing step new wants demanded new\r\nrights, and naturally walked out of those places, customs, creeds, and\r\nlaws that in any way crippled and trammeled his freedom of thought,\r\nword, or action, it is his duty to stand aside and leave to woman the\r\nsame rights--to grow up into whatever the laws of her being demand.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That inasmuch as on woman are imposed by her Creator the\r\nduties of self-support and self-defense, and by government the\r\nresponsibilities of taxation and penalties of violated law, she should\r\nbe protected in her natural, inalienable rights, and secured in all\r\nthe privileges of citizenship.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we demand a full recognition of our equal rights,\r\ncivil and political--no special legislation can satisfy us--the\r\nenjoyment of a right to-day is no security that it will be continued\r\nto-morrow, so long as it is granted to us by a privileged class, and\r\nnot secured to us as a sacred right.\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, the essence of republican liberty is the principle that no\r\nclass shall depend for its rights on the mercy or justice of any other\r\nclass, therefore,\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That woman demands her right to the jury-box and the\r\nballot, that she may have, as man has, the means of her own protection\r\nin her own hands.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That woman, in consenting to remain in any organization or\r\nchurch where she has no voice in the choice of officers, trustees, or\r\npastor--no right of protest against false doctrines or action--is\r\nwanting in a proper self-respect, in that dignity which, as a\r\nphilanthropist and a Christian, she should ever manifest.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we from this platform instruct our legal\r\nrepresentatives to make no more appropriations to colleges for boys\r\nexclusively. Now that we are large property holders and tax-payers, we\r\nprotest against the injustice of being compelled to build and endow\r\ncolleges into which we are forbidden to enter.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we advise women to apply to the trustees and heads of\r\npublic libraries, galleries of art, and similar institutions, for\r\nemployment as clerks and attendants, thus securing to themselves, when\r\nadmitted, a more liberal means of support, and furnishing a\r\nstepping-stone to other occupations.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we return thanks to the Legislature of New York for\r\nits acts of justice to woman during the last session. But the work is\r\nnot yet done. We still claim the ballot, the right of trial by a jury\r\nof our own peers, the control and custody of our persons in marriage,\r\nand an equal right to the joint earnings of the co-partnership. The\r\ngeographical position and political power of New York make her example\r\nsupreme; hence we feel assured that when she is right on this\r\nquestion, our work is done.\r\n\r\n[168] 1. _Resolved_, That, in the language (slightly varied) of John\r\nMilton, \"Those who marry intend as little to conspire their own ruin,\r\nas those who swear allegiance, and as a whole people is to an ill\r\ngovernment, so is one man or woman to an ill marriage. If a whole\r\npeople, against any authority, covenant, or statute, may, by the\r\nsovereign edict of charity, save not only their lives, but honest\r\nliberties, from unworthy bondage, as well may a married party, against\r\nany private covenant, which he or she never entered, to his or her\r\nmischief, be redeemed from unsupportable disturbances, to honest peace\r\nand just contentment.\"\r\n\r\n2. _Resolved_, That all men are created equal, and all women, in their\r\nnatural rights, are the equals of men, and endowed by their Creator\r\nwith the same inalienable right to the pursuit of happiness.\r\n\r\n3. _Resolved_, That any constitution, compact, or covenant between\r\nhuman beings, that failed to produce or promote human happiness, could\r\nnot, in the nature of things, be of any force or authority; and it\r\nwould be not only a right, but a duty, to abolish it.\r\n\r\n4. _Resolved_, That though marriage be in itself divinely founded, and\r\nis fortified as an institution by innumerable analogies in the whole\r\nkingdom of universal nature, still, a true marriage is only known by\r\nits results; and, like the fountain, if pure, will reveal only pure\r\nmanifestations. Nor need it ever be said, \"What God hath joined\r\ntogether, let no man put asunder,\" for man could not put it asunder;\r\nnor can he any more unite what God and nature have not joined\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n5. _Resolved_, That of all insulting mockeries of heavenly truth and\r\nholy law, none can be greater than that physical impotency is cause\r\nsufficient for divorce, while no amount of mental or moral or\r\nspiritual imbecility is ever to be pleaded in support of such a\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\n6. _Resolved_, That such a law was worthy those dark periods when\r\nmarriage was held by the greatest doctors and priests of the Church to\r\nbe a work of the flesh only, and almost, if not altogether, a\r\ndefilement; denied wholly to the clergy, and a second time, forbidden\r\nto all.\r\n\r\n7. _Resolved_, That an unfortunate or ill-assorted marriage is ever a\r\ncalamity, but not ever, perhaps never, a crime--and when society or\r\ngovernment, by its laws or customs, compels its continuance, always to\r\nthe grief of one of the parties, and the actual loss and damage of\r\nboth, it usurps an authority never delegated to man, nor exercised by\r\nGod himself.\r\n\r\n8. _Resolved_, That observation and experience daily show how\r\nincompetent are men, as individuals, or as governments, to select\r\npartners in business, teachers for their children, ministers of their\r\nreligion, or makers, adjudicators, or administrators of their laws;\r\nand as the same weakness and blindness must attend in the selection of\r\nmatrimonial partners, the dictates of humanity and common sense alike\r\nshow that the latter and most important contract should no more be\r\nperpetual than either or all of the former.\r\n\r\n9. _Resolved_, That children born in these unhappy and unhallowed\r\nconnections are, in the most solemn sense, of unlawful birth--the\r\nfruit of lust, but not of love--and so not of God, divinely descended,\r\nbut from beneath, whence proceed all manner of evil and uncleanliness.\r\n\r\n10. _Resolved_, That next to the calamity of such a birth to the\r\nchild, is the misfortune of being trained in the atmosphere of a\r\nhousehold where love is not the law, but where discord and bitterness\r\nabound; stamping their demoniac features on the moral nature, with all\r\ntheir odious peculiarities--thus continuing the race in a weakness and\r\ndepravity that must be a sure precursor of its ruin, as a just penalty\r\nof long-violated law.\r\n\r\n[169] Thurlow Weed, editor of _The Albany Evening Journal_, opposed\r\nthe passage of the Divorce Bill before the New York Legislature in\r\n1860.\r\n\r\n[170] _Resolved_, That marriage is the voluntary alliance of two\r\npersons of opposite sexes into one family, and that such an alliance,\r\nwith its possible incidents of children, its common interests, etc.,\r\nmust be, from the nature of things, as permanent as the life of the\r\nparties.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That if human law attempts to regulate marriage at all, it\r\nshould aim to regulate it according to the fundamental principles of\r\nmarriage; and that as the institution is inherently as continuous as\r\nthe life of the parties, so all laws should look to its control and\r\npreservation as such.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That as a parent can never annul his obligations towards\r\neven a profligate child, because of the inseparable relationship of\r\nthe parties, so the married partner can not annul his obligations\r\ntowards the other, while both live, no matter how profligate that\r\nother's conduct may be, because of their still closer and alike\r\npermanent relationship; and, therefore, that all divorce is naturally\r\nand morally impossible, even though we should succeed in annulling all\r\nlegalities.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That gross fraud and want of good faith in one of the\r\nparties contracting this alliance, such as would invalidate any other\r\nvoluntary relation, are the only causes which can invalidate this, and\r\nthis, too, solely upon the ground that the relation never virtually\r\nexisted, and that there are, therefore, no resulting moral\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, however, That both men and women have a first and\r\ninviolable right to themselves, physically, mentally, and morally, and\r\nthat it can never be the duty of either to surrender his personal\r\nfreedom in any direction to his own hurt.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the great duty of every human being is to secure his\r\nown highest moral development, and that he can not owe to society, or\r\nto an individual, any obligation which shall be degrading to himself.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That self-devotion to the good of another, and especially\r\nto the good of the sinful and guilty, like all disinterestedness, must\r\nredound to the highest good of its author, and that the husband or\r\nwife who thus seeks the best interests of the other, is obedient to\r\nthe highest law of benevolence.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That this is a very different thing from the culpable\r\nweakness which allows itself to be immolated by the selfishness of\r\nanother, to the hurt of both; and that the miserable practice, now so\r\ncommon among wives, of allowing themselves, their children and family\r\ninterests, to be sacrificed to a degraded husband and father, is most\r\nreprehensible.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That human law is imperatively obligated to give either\r\nparty ample protection to himself, to their offspring, and to all\r\nother family interests, against wrong, injustice, and usurpation on\r\nthe part of the other, and that, if it be necessary to this, it should\r\ngrant a legal separation;

Knowing that the position of every human being keeps pace with\r\nthe religion and civilization of his country, and that in many ancient\r\nnations woman had secured a good degree of respect and power, as\r\ncompared even with that she has in the present era, it has been\r\ndecided to present this subject from a historical standpoint, and to\r\nshow woman's position under the Christian Church for the last 1,500\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIf in so doing we shall help to show man's unwarranted usurpation over\r\nwoman's religious and civil rights, and the very great difference\r\nbetween true religion and theology, this chapter will not have been\r\nwritten in vain, as it will prove that the most grievous wound ever\r\ninflicted upon woman has been in the teaching that she was not created\r\nequal with man, and the consequent denial of her rightful place and\r\nposition in Church and State.\r\n\r\nWoman had acquired great liberty under the old civilizations. In Rome\r\nshe had not only secured remarkable personal and property rights,[178]\r\nbut she officiated as priestess in the most holy offices of religion.\r\nNot only as Vestal Virgin did she guard the Sacred Fire, upon whose\r\npreservation the welfare of Rome was held to depend, but at the end of\r\nevery consular period women officiated in private worship and\r\nsacrifice to the _Bono Dea_, with mystic ceremonies which no man's\r\npresence was suffered to profane. The Eleusinian mysteries were\r\nattributed to Ceres herself, and but few men had the courage to dare\r\ninitiation into their most secret rites. In ancient Egypt, woman\r\nbought and sold in the markets, was physician, colleges for her\r\ninstruction in medicine existing 1,200 years before Christ; she\r\nfounded its literature, the \"Sacred Songs\" of Isis being deemed by\r\nPlato literally 10,000 years old; as priestess she performed the most\r\nholy offices of religion, holding the Sacred Sistrum and offering\r\nsacrifices to the gods; she sat upon its throne and directed the\r\ncivilization of this country at the most brilliant period of its\r\nhistory; while in the marriage relation she held more than equality;\r\nthe husband at the ceremony promising obedience to the wife in all\r\nthings, a rule which according to Wilkinson, wrought no harm, but, on\r\nthe contrary, was productive of lasting fidelity and regard, the\r\nhusband and wife sitting together upon the same double chair in life,\r\nand lying together in the same tomb after death. Crimes against women\r\nwere rare in olden Egypt, and were punished in the most severe manner.\r\nIn Persia, woman was one of the founders of the ancient Parsee\r\nreligion, which taught the existence of but a single God, thus\r\nintroducing monotheism into that rare old kingdom. The Germans endowed\r\ntheir wives upon marriage with a horse, bridle, and spear, emblematic\r\nof equality, and they held themselves bound to chastity in the marital\r\nrelation. The women of Scandinavia were regarded with respect, and\r\nmarriage was held as sacred by both men and women. These old\r\nBerserkers reverenced their Alruna, or Holy Women, on earth, and\r\nworshiped goddesses in heaven.\r\n\r\nAll Pagandom recognized a female priesthood, some making their\r\nnational safety to depend upon them, like Rome; sybils wrote the Books\r\nof Fate, and oracles where women presided were consulted by many\r\nnations. The proof of woman's also taking part in the offices of the\r\nChristian Church at an early date is to be found in the very\r\nrestrictions which were at a later period placed upon her. The Council\r\nof Laodicea, A.D. 365, in its eleventh canon[179] forbade the\r\nordination of women to the ministry, and by its forty-fourth canon\r\nprohibited them from entering into the altar.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Orleans, A.D. 511, consisting of twenty-six bishops and\r\npriests, promulgated a canon declaring that on account of their\r\nfrailty, women must be excluded from the deaconship.\r\n\r\nNearly five hundred years later than the Council of Laodicea, we find\r\nthe Council of Paris (A.D. 824) bitterly complaining that women serve\r\nat the altar, and even give to the people the body and blood of Jesus\r\nChrist. The Council of Aix-la-Chapelle, only eight years previously,\r\nhad forbidden abbesses from taking upon themselves any priestly\r\nfunction. Through these canons we have the negative proof that for\r\nmany hundred years women preached, baptized,[180] administered the\r\nsacrament, and filled various offices of the Church, and that men took\r\nit upon themselves to forbid them from such functions through\r\nprohibitory canons.\r\n\r\nA curious old black-letter volume published in London in 1632,\r\nentitled \"The Lawes and Resolutions of Women's Rights,\" says, \"the\r\nreason why women have no control in Parliament, why they make no laws,\r\nconsent to none, abrogate none, is their Original Sin.\"\r\n\r\nThis doctrine of her original sin lies at the base of the religious\r\nand political disqualifications of woman. Christianity, through this\r\ndoctrine, has been interpreted as sustaining man's rights alone. The\r\noffices held by her during the apostolic age, she has been gradually\r\ndeprived of through ecclesiastical enactments. To Augustine, whose\r\nearly life was spent in company with the most degraded of woman-kind,\r\nis Christianity indebted for the full development of the doctrine of\r\nOriginal Sin, which, although to be found in the religious systems of\r\nseveral ancient nations, was not a primitive one of the Christian\r\nChurch.[181] Taught as one of the most sacred mysteries of religion,\r\nwhich to doubt or to question was to hazard eternal damnation, it at\r\nonce exerted a most powerful and repressing influence upon woman,\r\nfastening upon her a bondage which the civilization of the nineteenth\r\ncentury has not been able to cast off.\r\n\r\nTo this doctrine of woman's created inferiority we can trace those\r\nirregularities which for many centuries filled the Church with shame,\r\nfor practices more obscene than the orgies of Babylon or Corinth, and\r\nwhich dragged Christendom to a darkness blacker than the night of\r\nheathendom in pagan countries--a darkness upon which the most\r\nsearching efforts of historians cast scarcely one ray of light--a\r\ndarkness so profound that from the seventh to the eleventh century no\r\nindividual thought can be traced. All was sunk in superstition; men\r\nwere bound by Church dogmas, and looked only to aggrandizement through\r\nher. The priesthood, which alone possessed a knowledge of letters,\r\nprostituted their learning to the basest uses; the nobility spent\r\ntheir lives in warring upon each other; the peasantry were the sport\r\nand victim by turns of priest and noble, while woman was the prey of\r\nall; her person and her rights possessing no consideration only as\r\nthey could be made to advance the interest or serve the pleasure of\r\nnoble, husband, father, or priest--some man-god to whose lightest\r\ndesire all her wishes were made to bend. The most pronounced doctrine\r\nof the Church during this period was, that through woman sin had been\r\nintroduced into the world; that woman's whole tendency was toward\r\nevil, and that had it not been for the unfortunate oversight of her\r\ncreation, man would be dwelling in the paradisical innocence and\r\nhappiness of Eden blessed with immortality. The Church looking upon\r\nwoman as under a curse, considered man as God's divinely appointed\r\nagent for its enforcement, and that the restrictions she suffered\r\nunder Christianity were but parts of a just punishment for having\r\ncaused the fall of man. Christian theology thus at once struck a blow\r\nat these old beliefs in woman's equality, broadly inculcating the\r\ndoctrine that woman was created for man, was subordinate to him and\r\nunder obedience to him. It bade woman stand aside from sacerdotal\r\noffices, forbidding her to speak in the church, commanding her to ask\r\nher husband at home for all she wished to know, at once repressing all\r\ntendency toward her freedom among those who adopted the new religion,\r\nand by various decretals taught her defilement through the physical\r\npeculiarities of her being. It placed the legality of marriage under\r\npriestly control, secured to husbands a right of divorce for causes\r\nnot freeing the wife, and so far set its ban upon this relation as to\r\nhold single women above the wife and mother in holiness. After having\r\nforbidden woman the priestly office, it forbade her certain benefits\r\nto be derived therefrom, thus unjustly punishing her for an\r\nineligibility of its own creation; offices in the Church, learning,\r\nand property rights, freedom of thought and action, all were held as\r\nimproper for a being secondary to man, who came into the world, not as\r\npart of the great original plan, but as an afterthought of the\r\nCreator.\r\n\r\nWhile it took many hundred years to totally exclude woman from the\r\npriesthood, the strict celibacy of the male clergy was during the same\r\nperiod the constant effort of the Church. At first its restrictions\r\nwere confined to a single marriage with a woman who had never before\r\nentered that relation. A Council of A.D. 347, consisting of twenty-one\r\nbishops, forbade the ordination of those priests who had been twice\r\nmarried, or who had married a widow. A Council of A.D. 395, ruled that\r\na bishop who had children after ordination, should be excluded from\r\nthe major orders. The Council of A.D. 444, deposed Chelidonius, Bishop\r\nof Besancon, for having married a widow; while the Council of Orleans,\r\nA.D. 511, consisting of thirty-two bishops, decided that any monk who\r\nmarried should be expelled from the ecclesiastical order.\r\n\r\nIn the sixth century a Council was held at Macon (585), consisting of\r\nforty-three bishops with sees, sixteen bishops without sees, and\r\nfifteen envoys. At this Council the celebrated discussion took place\r\nof which it has often been said, the question was whether woman had a\r\nsoul. It arose in this wise. A certain bishop insisted that woman\r\nshould not be called \"homo\"; but the contrary was argued by others\r\nfrom the two facts that the Scriptures say that God created man, male\r\nand female, and that Jesus Christ, son of a woman, is called the son\r\nof man. Woman was, therefore, allowed to remain a human being in the\r\neyes of the clergy, even though considered a very weak and bad one.\r\n\r\nThe Church held two entirely opposing views of marriage. Inasmuch as\r\nit taught that the fall came through marriage, this relation was\r\nregarded by many priests with holy horror as a continuance of the evil\r\nwhich first brought sin into the world. It was declared that God would\r\nhave found some method of populating the world outside of marriage,\r\nand that condition was looked upon as one of peculiar temptation and\r\ntrial. Another class taught its necessity, though in it woman was\r\nunder complete subordination to man. These views can be traced to the\r\nearly fathers; through clerical contempt of marriage, the conditions\r\nof celibacy and virginity were regarded as those of highest virtue.\r\nJerome respected marriage as chiefly valuable in that it gave virgins\r\nto the Church, while Augustine, although he admitted the possibility\r\nof salvation to the married, yet spoke of a mother and daughter in\r\nheaven, the mother shining as a dim star, the daughter as one of the\r\nfirst magnitude.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Apostolic Constitutions,\" held by the Episcopal Church as\r\nregulations established by the apostles themselves, and which are\r\nbelieved by many to be among the earliest Christian records, there are\r\nelaborate directions for the places of all who attend church, the\r\nunmarried being most honored. The virgins and widows and elder women\r\nstood, or sat first of all. The Emperor Honorius banished Jovinius for\r\nasserting the possibility of a man being saved who lived with his\r\nwife, even though he obeyed all the ordinances of the Church and lived\r\na good life.\r\n\r\nSt. Chrysostom, whose prayer is repeated at every Sunday morning\r\nservice of the Episcopal church, described woman as \"a necessary evil,\r\na natural temptation, a desirable calamity, a domestic peril, a deadly\r\nfascination, and a painted ill.\" The doctrine of priestly celibacy\r\nwhich was early taught, though not thoroughly enforced until the\r\neleventh century, and the general tenor of the Church against\r\nmarriage, together with its teaching woman's greater sinfulness, were\r\nthe great causes of undermining the morals of the Christian world for\r\nfifteen hundred years. With these doctrines was also taught the duty\r\nof woman to sacrifice herself in every way to man. The loss of\r\nchastity in a woman was held as a light sin in comparison to the\r\ndegradation that marriage would bring upon the priesthood, and young\r\ngirls ruined by some candidate or priest, considered themselves as\r\ndoing God service by refusing a marriage that would cause the\r\nexpulsion of their lovers from this order. With woman's so-called\r\ndivine self-sacrifice, Heloise chose to remain Abelard's mistress\r\nrather than destroy his prospects of advancement in the Church.[182]\r\n\r\nTo the more strict enforcement of priestly celibacy, the barons were\r\npermitted to make slaves of the wives and children of married priests.\r\nWhile by common law children were held as following the condition of\r\ntheir fathers, under Church legislation they were held to follow the\r\ncondition of their mothers. Serf mothers have thus borne serf children\r\nto free-born fathers, and slave mothers have borne slave children to\r\ntheir masters; while unmarried mothers still bear bastard children to\r\nunknown fathers, the Church thus throwing the taint of illegitimacy\r\nupon the innocent. The relations of man and woman to each other, the\r\nsinfulness of marriage, and the license of illicit relations employed\r\nmost of the thought of the Church.[183] The duty of woman to obey, not\r\nonly her husband, but all men by virtue of their sex, was sedulously\r\ninculcated. She was trained to hold her own desires and even her own\r\nthoughts in complete abeyance to those of man; father, husband,\r\nbrother, son, priest, alike held themselves as her rightful masters,\r\nand every holy principle of her nature was subverted in this most\r\ndegrading assumption. A great many important effects followed the full\r\nestablishment of priestly celibacy. The doctrine of woman's inherent\r\nwickedness took new strength; a formal prohibition of the Scriptures\r\nto the laity was promulgated from Toulouse in the twelfth century; the\r\ncanon law gained control of the civil law; the absolute sinfulness of\r\ndivorce, which had been maintained in councils, yet allowed by the\r\ncivil law, was established; the Inquisition arose; the persecution of\r\nwoman for witchcraft took on a new phase, and a tendency to suicide\r\nwas developed. The wives of priests rendered homeless, and with their\r\nchildren suddenly ranked among the vilest of the earth, were powerless\r\nand despairing, and not a few of them shortened their agony by death\r\nat their own hands. For all these crimes the Church was directly\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\nPriestly celibacy did not cause priestly purity of life,[184] but\r\nlooking upon themselves as especially sanctified and set apart by\r\nvirtue of that celibacy, priests made their holy office the cover of\r\nthe most degrading sensuality.[185] Methods were taken to debauch the\r\nminds of women as well as their bodies. As late as the seventeenth\r\ncentury it was taught that a priest could commit no sin. This was an\r\nold doctrine, but received new strength from the Illumines. It was\r\nsaid that \"The devout, having offered up and annihilated their own\r\nselves, exist no longer but in God. Thenceforth they can do no wrong.\r\nThe better part of them is so divine that it no longer knows what the\r\nother is doing.\" The doctrine of some Protestant sects, \"Once in\r\ngrace, always in grace,\" is of the same character. The very\r\nincarnation was used as a means of weakening woman's virtue. An\r\nenforcement of the duty of an utter surrender of the soul and the will\r\nwas taught by the example of the Virgin, \"who obeyed the angel Gabriel\r\nand conceived, without risk of evil, for impurity could not come of a\r\nspirit.\"[186] Another lesson, of which the present century has some\r\nglimpse, was \"that sin could be killed by sin, as the better way of\r\nbecoming innocent again.\" The result of this doctrine was seen in the\r\nmistresses of the priests, known as \"The Hallowed Ones.\"\r\n\r\nUnder such religious teaching as to woman, naught could be expected\r\nbut that the laity would closely imitate the priesthood. Although\r\nChurch and State may not be legally united, it is impossible for any\r\nreligious opinion to become widely prevalent without its influencing\r\nlegislation. Among the Anglo-Saxons, the priesthood possessed great\r\ninfluence; but after the Norman Conquest, ecclesiasticism gained\r\ngreater control in England. Previous to this, a man was compelled by\r\nlaw to leave his wife one-third of his property, and could leave her\r\nas much, more as he pleased. Under ecclesiastical law he was not\r\npermitted to will her more than one-third, and could leave her as much\r\nless as he pleased. Glanville laid it down as a law of the kingdom\r\nthat no one was compelled to leave another person any portion of his\r\nproperty, and that the part usually devised to wives was left them at\r\nthe dictate of affection and not of law.\r\n\r\nWomen were not permitted to testify in court unless on some question\r\nespecially concerning themselves. It is but twenty years since this\r\nlaw was annulled in Scotland, and but three years since, that by the\r\ninfluence of Signor Morelli,[187] the Parliament of Italy repealed the\r\nold restriction upon woman's testimony.\r\n\r\nSisters were not allowed to inherit with brothers, the property,\r\naccording to old ecclesiastical language, going \"to the worthiest of\r\nblood.\" Blackstone acknowledges that this distinction between brothers\r\nand sisters reflects shame upon England, and was no part of the old\r\nRoman law, where the children of a family inherited equally without\r\ndistinction of sex. It is but two years since the old law of\r\ninheritance of sons alone was repealed in one of the Swiss Cantons.\r\nEven in this enlightened age its repeal met much opposition, men\r\npiteously complaining that they would be ruined by this act of justice\r\ndone their sisters.\r\n\r\nThe minds of people having been corrupted through centuries by Church\r\ndoctrines regarding woman, it was an easy step for the State to aid in\r\nher degradation. The system of Feudalism rising from the theory of\r\nwarfare as the normal condition of man, still further oppressed woman\r\nby bringing into power a class of men accustomed to deeds of violence,\r\nand finding their chief pleasure in the sufferings of others. To be a\r\nwoman, appealed to no instinct of tenderness in this class. To be a\r\nwoman was not to be protected even, unless she held power in her own\r\nright, or was acting in place of some feudal lord. The whole body of\r\nvilleins and serfs were under absolute dominion of the Feudal Lords.\r\nThey were held as possessing no rights of their own: the Priest had\r\ncontrol of their souls, the Lord of their bodies. But it was not upon\r\nthe male serfs that the greatest oppression fell.\r\n\r\nAlthough the tillage of the soil, the care of swine and cattle was\r\ntheirs, the masters claiming the half or more of everything even to\r\none-half the wool shorn from the flock,[188] and all exactions upon\r\nthem were great while their sense of security was slight, it was upon\r\ntheir wives and daughters that the greatest outrages were inflicted.\r\nIt was a pastime of the castle retainers to fall upon peaceful\r\nvillages to the consternation of its women, who were struck, tortured,\r\nwere great, while their sense of security was slight, it was upon and\r\nmade the sport of the ribald soldiery, \"Serfs of the Body,\" they had\r\nno protection. The vilest outrages were perpetrated by the Feudal\r\nLords under the name of Rights. Women were taught by Church and State\r\nalike, that the Feudal Lord or Seigneur had a right to them, not only\r\nas against themselves, but as against any claim of husband or father.\r\nThe law known as _Marchetta_, or Marquette, compelled newly-married\r\nwomen to a most dishonorable servitude. They were regarded as the\r\nrightful prey of the Feudal Lord from one to three days after their\r\nmarriage, and from this custom, the oldest son of the serf was held as\r\nthe son of the lord, \"as perchance it was he who begat him.\" From this\r\nnefarious degradation of woman, the custom of Borough-English arose,\r\nin which the youngest son became the heir. The original signification\r\nof the word borough being to make secure, the peasant through\r\nBorough-English made secure the right of his own son to what\r\ninheritance he might leave, thus cutting off the claim of the possible\r\nson of his hated lord. France, Germany, Prussia, England, Scotland,\r\nand all Christian countries where feudalism existed, held to the\r\nenforcement of Marquette. The lord deemed this right as fully his as\r\nhe did the claim to half the crops of the land, or to the half of the\r\nwool sheared from the sheep. More than one reign of terror arose in\r\nFrance from the enforcement of this law, and the uprisings of the\r\npeasantry over Europe during the twelfth century, and the fierce\r\nJacquerie, or Peasant War, of the fourteenth century in France owed\r\ntheir origin, among other causes, to the enforcement of these claims\r\nby the lords upon the newly-married wife. The Edicts of Marly securing\r\nthe Seigneural Tenure in Lower Canada, transplanted that claim to\r\nAmerica when Canada was under the control of France.\r\n\r\nTo persons not conversant with the history of feudalism, and of the\r\nChurch for the first fifteen hundred years of its existence, it will\r\nseem impossible that such foulness could ever have been part of\r\nChristian civilization. That the crimes they have been trained to\r\nconsider the worst forms of heathendom could have existed in Christian\r\nEurope, upheld by both Church and State for more than a thousand five\r\nhundred years, will strike most people with incredulity. Such,\r\nhowever, is the truth; we can but admit well-attested facts of history\r\nhow severe a blow soever they strike our preconceived beliefs.\r\n\r\nMarquette was claimed by the Lords Spiritual[189] as well as by the\r\nLords Temporal. The Church, indeed, was the bulwark of this base\r\nfeudal claim. With the power of penance and excommunication in its\r\ngrasp, this feudal demand could neither have originated nor been\r\nsustained unless sanctioned by the Church.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, Margaret, wife of Malcolm Conmore, generally known, from\r\nher goodness, as St. Margaret,[190] exerted her royal influence in\r\n1057, against this degradation of her sex, but despite the royal\r\nprohibition and the substitution of the payment of a merk in money\r\ninstead, the custom had such a foothold and appealed so strongly to\r\nman's licentious appetite it still continued, remaining in existence\r\nnearly seven hundred years after the royal edict against its practice.\r\nThese customs of feudalism were the customs of Christianity during\r\nmany centuries.[191] These infamous outrages upon woman were enforced\r\nunder Christian law by both Church and State.[192]\r\n\r\nThe degradation of the husband at this infringement of the lord\r\nspiritual and temporal upon his marital right, has been pictured by\r\nmany writers, but history has been quite silent upon the despair and\r\nshame of the wife. No hope appeared for woman anywhere. The Church,\r\nwhich should have been the great conserver of morals, dragged her to\r\nthe lowest depths, through the vileness of its priestly customs. The\r\nState, which should have defended her civil rights, followed the\r\nexample of the Church in crushing her to the earth. God Himself\r\nseemed to have forsaken woman. Freedom for the peasants was found\r\nalone at night. Known as the Birds of the Night, Foxes and Birds of\r\nPrey, it was only at these night assemblages they enjoyed the least\r\nhappiness or security. Here, with wives and daughters, they met\r\ntogether to talk, of their gross outrages. Out of these foul wrongs\r\ngrew the sacrifice of the \"Black Mass,\" with woman as officiating\r\npriestess, in which the rites of the Church were travestied in solemn\r\nmockery, and defiance cast at that heaven which seemed to permit the\r\npriest and lord alike to trample upon all the sacred rights of\r\nwomanhood in the names of religion and law.\r\n\r\nDuring this mocking service a true sacrifice of wheat was offered to\r\nthe Spirit of the Earth who made wheat to grow, and loosened birds\r\nbore aloft to the God of Freedom the sighs and prayers of the serfs\r\nasking that their descendants might be free. We can not do otherwise\r\nthan regard this sacrifice as the most acceptable offering made in\r\nthat day of moral degradation, a sacrifice and prayer more holy than\r\nall the ceremonials of the Church. This service, where woman, by\r\nvirtue of her greater despair, acted both as altar and priest, opened\r\nby the following address and prayer: \"I will come before Thine altar,\r\nbut save me, O Lord, from the faithless and violent man!\" (from the\r\npriest and the baron).[193] From these assemblages, known as \"Sabbat,\"\r\nor \"the Sabbath,\" from the old Pagan Midsummer-day sacrifice to\r\n\"Bacchus Sabiesa,\" rose the belief in the \"Witches' Sabbath,\" which\r\nfor several hundred years formed a new source of accusation against\r\nwomen, and sent tens of thousands of them to the most horrible death.\r\n\r\nNot until canon or Church law had become quite engrafted upon the\r\ncivil law, did the full persecutions for witchcraft arise. A witch was\r\nheld to be a woman who had deliberately sold her soul to the Evil One,\r\nwho delighted in injuring others, and who chose the Sabbath day for\r\nthe enactment of her impious rites, and who was especially connected\r\nwith black animals; the black cat being held as her familiar in many\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nIn looking at the history of witchcraft, we see three striking points\r\nfor consideration:\r\n\r\n_First._ That women were chiefly accused, a wizard being seldom\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n_Second._ That man, believing in woman's inherent wickedness, and\r\nunderstanding neither the mental nor the physical peculiarities of her\r\nbeing, ascribed all her idiosyncrasies to witchcraft.\r\n\r\n_Third._ That the clergy inculcated the idea that woman was in league\r\nwith the devil, and that strong intellect, remarkable beauty, or\r\nunusual sickness, were in themselves a proof of that league.\r\n\r\nCatholic and Protestant countries alike agreed in holding woman as the\r\nchief accessory of the devil. Luther said, \"I would have no compassion\r\nfor a witch; I would burn them all.\" As late as 1768, John Wesley\r\ndeclared the giving up of witchcraft to be in effect giving up the\r\nBible. James I., on his accession to the throne, ordered the learned\r\nwork of Reginald Scot against witchcraft, to be burned in compliance\r\nwith the act of Parliament of 1603, which ratified a belief in\r\nwitchcraft over the three kingdoms. Under Henry VIII., from whose\r\nreign the Protestant Reformation in England dates, an act of\r\nParliament made witchcraft felony; this act was again confirmed under\r\nElizabeth. To doubt witchcraft was as heretical under Protestantism as\r\nunder Catholicism.\r\n\r\nEven the widely extolled Pilgrim Fathers brought this belief with them\r\nwhen they stepped ashore at Plymouth Rock. With the \"Ducking-Stool\"\r\nand the \"Scarlet Letter\" of shame for woman, while her companion in\r\nsin went free, they also brought with them a belief in witches.\r\nRichard Baxter, the \"greatest of the Puritans,\" condemned those who\r\ndisbelieved in witchcraft as \"wicked Sadducees,\" his work against it\r\nadding intensity to the persecution. Cotton Mather was active in\r\nfomenting a belief in this doctrine.\r\n\r\nSo convinced were those in power of the tendency of woman to diabolism\r\nthat the learned Sir Matthew Hale condemned two women without even\r\nsumming up the evidence. Old women, for no other reason than that they\r\nwere old, were held as most susceptible to the assaults of the devil,\r\nand most especially endowed with supernatural powers for evil, to\r\ndoubt which was equivalent to doubting the Bible. We see a reason for\r\nthis hatred of old women, in the fact that woman was chiefly viewed\r\nfrom a sensual stand-point, and when by reason of age or debility, she\r\nno longer attracted the physical admiration of man, he looked upon her\r\nas of no farther use to the world, and as possessing no right to life.\r\nAt one period it was very unusual for an old woman in the north of\r\nEurope to die peaceably in her bed. The persecution against them raged\r\nwith special virulence in Scotland, where upon the act of the British\r\nParliament in 17--, abolishing the burning and hanging of witches, the\r\nassembly of the Calvinistic Church of Scotland \"confessed\" this act of\r\nParliament \"as a great national sin.\" Looked upon as a sin rather than\r\na crime, the Church sought its control, and when coming under its\r\npower, witchcraft was punished with much greater severity than when\r\nfalling under lay tribunals. It proved a source of great emolument to\r\nthe Church, which was even accused of fostering it for purposes of\r\ngain. A system of \"witch finders\" or \"witch persecutors\" arose.\r\nCardan, a famous Italian physician, said of them: \"In order to obtain\r\nforfeit property, the same persons acted as accusers and judges, and\r\ninvented a thousand stories as proof.\"\r\n\r\nWitchcraft was as a sin almost confined to woman; a wizard was rare,\r\none writer saying: to every 100 witches, we find but one wizard. In\r\nthe time of Louis XIII. this proportion was greatly increased; \"to one\r\nwizard, 10,000 witches,\" another person declared there were 100,000\r\nwitches in France alone. Sprenger, the great Inquisitor, author of\r\n\"The Witch Hammer,\"[194] through whose persecutions many countries\r\nwere flooded with victims, said, \"Heresy of witches, not of wizards,\r\nmust we call it, for these latter are of very small account.\" No class\r\nor condition escaped Sprenger; we read of witches of fifteen years,\r\nand two \"infernally beautiful\"[195] of seventeen years.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament of Toulouse burned 400 witches at one time. Four\r\nhundred women at one hour on the public square, dying the horrid death\r\nof fire, for a crime which never existed save in the imagination of\r\nthose persecutors, and which grew in their imagination from a false\r\nbelief in woman's extraordinary wickedness, based upon a false theory\r\nas to original sin. Not a Christian country but was full of the\r\nhorrors of witch persecution and violent death. Remy, Judge of Nancy,\r\nacknowledged to having himself burnt 800 in sixteen years. Many women\r\nwere driven to suicide in fear of the torture in store for them. In\r\n1595 sixteen of those accused by Remy, destroyed themselves rather\r\nthan fall into his terrible hands. Six hundred were burnt in one small\r\nbishopric in one year; 900 during the same period in another. Seven\r\nthousand lost their lives at Treves; 1,000 in the province of Como in\r\nItaly in a single year; 500 were executed at Geneva in a single month.\r\nUnder the reign of Francis I. more than 100,000 witches are said to\r\nhave been put to death, and for hundreds of years this superstition\r\ncontrolled the Church. In Scotland the most atrocious tortures were\r\ninvented, and women died \"shrieking to heaven for that mercy denied\r\nthem by Christian men.\" One writer casually mentions seeing nine\r\nburning in a single day's journey.\r\n\r\nWhen for \"witches\" we read \"women,\" we shall gain a more direct idea\r\nof the cruelties inflicted by the Church upon woman. Friends were\r\nencouraged to cast accusations upon friends, and rewards were offered\r\nfor conviction. From the pulpit people were exhorted to bring the\r\nwitch to justice. Husbands who had ceased to care for their wives, or\r\nin any way found them a burden, or who for any reason wished to\r\ndissolve the marriage tie, now found an easy method. They had but to\r\naccuse them of witchcraft, and the marriage was dissolved by the death\r\nof the wife at the stake. Mention is made of wives dragged by their\r\nhusbands before the arch-Inquisitor, Sprenger, by ropes around their\r\nnecks. In Protestant, as in Catholic countries, the person accused was\r\nvirtually dead. She was excommunicated from humanity; designated and\r\ndenounced as one whom all must shun, with whom none must buy or sell,\r\nto whom no one must give food or lodging or speech or shelter; life\r\nwas not worth the living.\r\n\r\nBesides those committing suicide, others brought to trial, tired of\r\nlife amid so many horrors, falsely accused themselves, preferring a\r\ndeath by the torture of fire to a life of endless isolation and\r\npersecution. An English woman on her way to the stake, with a\r\ngreatness of soul all must admire, freed her judges from\r\nresponsibility by saying to the people, \"Do not blame my judges, I\r\nwished to put an end to my own self. My parents kept aloof from me; my\r\nhusband had denied me. I could not live on without disgrace. I longed\r\nfor death, and so I told a lie.\"\r\n\r\nOf Sir George Mackenzie, the eminent Scotch advocate, it was said:\r\n\r\n     He went to examine some women who had confessed,[196] and one of\r\n     them told him \"under secrecie\" that she had not confessed\r\n     because she was guilty, but being a poor wretch who wrought for\r\n     her meat, and being defined for a witch, she knew she would\r\n     starve, for no person thereafter would give her either meat or\r\n     lodging, and that all men would beat her and hound dogs at her,\r\n     and therefore she desired to be out of the world, whereupon she\r\n     wept most bitterly, and upon her knees called upon God to witness\r\n     what she said.\r\n\r\nThe death these poor women chose to suffer rather than accept a chance\r\nof life with the name of witch clinging to them,[197] was one of the\r\nmost painful of which we can conceive,[198] although in the diversity\r\nof torture inflicted upon \"the witch,\" it is scarcely possible to say\r\nwhich was the least agonizing.\r\n\r\nNot only was the persecution for witchcraft brought to New England by\r\nthe Puritans, but it has been considered and treated as a capital\r\noffense by the laws of both Pennsylvania and New York. Trials took\r\nplace in both colonies not long before the Salem tragedy; the peaceful\r\nQuaker, William Penn, presiding upon the bench at the time of the\r\ntrial of two Swedish women accused of witchcraft. The Grand Jury\r\nacting under instruction given in a charge delivered by him, found\r\nbills against them, and his skirts were only saved from the guilt of\r\ntheir blood by some technical irregularity in the indictment.\r\n\r\nMarriage with devils was long one of the most ordinary accusations in\r\nwitch trials. The knowledge of witches was admitted, as is shown in\r\nthe widely extended belief of their ability to work miracles. A large\r\npart of the women termed witches were in reality the profoundest\r\nthinkers, the most advanced scientists of those ages. For many hundred\r\nyears the knowledge of medicine, and its practice among the poorer\r\nclasses was almost entirely in their hands, and many discoveries in\r\nthis science are due to them; but an acquaintance with herbs soothing\r\nto pain, or healing in their qualities, was then looked upon as having\r\nbeen acquired through diabolical agency. Even those persons cured\r\nthrough the instrumentality of some woman were ready when the hour\r\ncame to assert their belief in her indebtedness to the devil for that\r\nknowledge. Not only were the common people themselves ignorant of all\r\nscience, but their brains were filled with superstitious fears, and\r\nthe belief that knowledge had been first introduced to the world\r\nthrough woman's obedience to the devil. Thus the persecution which for\r\nages raged against witches, was in reality an attack upon science at\r\nthe hands of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe entire subordination of the common law to ecclesiasticism, dates\r\nin England to the reign of Stephen, who ascended the throne in 1135.\r\nIts new growth of power must be ascribed to avarice, as it then began\r\nto take cognizance of crimes, establishing an equivalent in money for\r\nevery species of wrong-doing. The Church not only remitted penalties\r\nfor crimes already perpetrated, but sold indulgences for the\r\ncommission of new ones. Its touch upon property soon extended to all\r\nthe relations of life. Marriages within the seventh degree were\r\nforbidden by the Church as incestuous, but those who could buy\r\nindulgence were enabled to get a dispensation. No crime so great that\r\nit could not be condoned for money.\r\n\r\nCanon law gained its greatest power in the family relation in its\r\ncontrol over wills, the guardianship of orphans, marriage and divorce.\r\nUnder ecclesiastical law, marriage was held as a sacrament, was\r\nperformed at the church door, the wife being required to give up her\r\nname, her person, her property, her own sacred individuality, and to\r\npromise obedience to her husband in all things. Certain hours of the\r\nday were even set aside as canonical after which no marriage could be\r\ncelebrated.[199] Wherever it became the basis of legislation, the laws\r\nof succession and inheritance, and those in regard to children,\r\nconstantly sacrificed the interests of wives and daughters to those\r\nof husbands and sons. Ecclesiastical law ultimately secured such a\r\nhold upon family property and became so grasping in its demands, that\r\nthe civil law interfered, not, however, in the interests of wives and\r\nchildren, but in the interests of creditors. Canon law had its largest\r\ngrowth through the pious fictions of woman's created inferiority.\r\n\r\nTo the credit of humanity it must be said that the laity did not\r\nreadily yield to priestly power, but made many efforts to wrest their\r\ntemporal concerns from ecclesiastical control. But in the general\r\npaucity of education, together with the abnegation of the will,\r\nsedulously taught by the Church, which brought all its dread power to\r\nbear in threats of excommunication and future eternal torment, the\r\nrights of the people were gradually lost. The control of the\r\npriesthood over all things of a temporal, as well as of a spiritual\r\nnature, tended to make them a distinct body from the laity, and rights\r\nwere divided into those pertaining to persons and things, the rights\r\nof persons belonging to the priesthood alone; but inasmuch as every\r\nman, whatever his condition, could become a priest, and no woman,\r\nhowever learned or pious or high in station, could, the whole tendency\r\nof ecclesiastical law was to separate man and woman into a holy or\r\ndivine sex, and an unholy or impious sex, creating an antagonism\r\nbetween those whose interests are by nature the same. Thus canon law,\r\nbearing upon the business of ordinary life between man and man, fell\r\nwith its greatest weight upon woman; it not only corrupted the common\r\nlaw in England, but perverted the civil law of other countries. The\r\ndenial under common law of the right of woman to make a contract, grew\r\nout of the denial of her right of ownership. Not possessing control\r\nover her own property or her future actions, she was held as legally\r\nunable to make a binding contract.\r\n\r\nProperty is a delicate test of the condition of a nation. It is a\r\nsingular fact of history that the rights of property have everywhere\r\nbeen recognized before the rights of persons, and wherever the rights\r\nof any class to property are attacked, it is a most subtle and\r\ndangerous assault upon personal rights. The chief restrictive element\r\nof slavery was the denial to the slave of the proceeds of his own\r\nlabor. As soon as a slave was allowed to hire his time, the door of\r\nfreedom began to open to him. The enslavement of woman has been much\r\nincreased from the denial of the rights of property to her, not merely\r\nto the fruits of her own labor, but to the right of inheritance.\r\n\r\nThe great school of German jurists[200] teach that ownership increases\r\nboth physical and moral capacity, and that as owner, actual or\r\npossible, man is a more capable and worthy being than he would\r\notherwise be. Inasmuch as under canon law woman was debarred from\r\ngiving testimony in courts of law, sisters were prohibited from taking\r\nan inheritance with brothers, and wives were deprived of property\r\nrights, it is entirely justifiable to say ecclesiastical law injured\r\ncivilization by its destruction of the property rights of women.[201]\r\n\r\nThe worst features of canon law, as Blackstone frankly admits, are\r\nthose touching upon the rights of woman. These features have been made\r\npermanent to this day by the power the Church gained over common\r\nlaw,[202] between the tenth and sixteenth centuries, since which\r\nperiod the complete inferiority and subordination of the female sex\r\nhas been as fully maintained by the State as by the Church. The\r\ninfluence of canon law upon the criminal codes of England and America\r\nhas but recently attracted the attention of legal minds. Wharton,\r\nwhose \"Criminal Law\" has for years been a standard work, did not\r\nexamine their relation until his seventh edition, in which he gave a\r\ncopious array of authors, English, German, and Latin, from whom he\r\ndeduced proof that the criminal codes of these two countries are\r\npre-eminently based upon ecclesiastical law.\r\n\r\nCanon law gave to the husband the power of compelling the wife's\r\nreturn if, for any cause, she left him. She was then at once in the\r\nposition of an outlaw, branded as a run-away who had left her master's\r\nservice, a wife who had left \"bed and board\" without consent, and whom\r\nall persons were forbidden \"to harbor\" or shelter \"under penalty of\r\nthe law.\" The absconding wife was in the position of an excommunicate\r\nfrom the Catholic Church, or of a woman condemned as a witch. Any\r\nperson befriending her was held accessory to the wife's theft of\r\nherself from her husband, and rendered liable to fine and other\r\npunishment for having helped to rob the husband (master) of his wife\r\n(slave).\r\n\r\nThe present formula of advertising a wife, which so frequently\r\ndisgraces the press, is due to this belief in wife-ownership.\r\n\r\n     Whereon my wife ... has left my bed and board without just cause\r\n     or provocation, I hereby forbid all persons from harboring or\r\n     trusting her on my account.\r\n\r\nBy old English law, in case the wife was in danger of perishing in a\r\nstorm, it was allowable \"to harbor\" and shelter her.\r\n\r\nIt is less than thirty years since the dockets of a court in New York\r\ncity, the great metropolis of our nation, were sullied by the suit of\r\na husband against parties who had received, \"harbored\" and sheltered\r\nhis wife after she left him, the husband recovering $10,000 damages.\r\n\r\nAlthough England was Christianized in the fourth century, it was not\r\nuntil the tenth that a daughter had a right to reject the husband\r\nselected for her by her father;[203] and it was not until this same\r\ncentury that the Christian wife of a Christian husband acquired the\r\nright of eating at table with him. For many hundred years the law\r\nentered families, binding out to servile labor all unmarried women\r\nbetween the ages of eleven and forty.\r\n\r\nFor more than a thousand years women in England were legislated for as\r\nslaves. They were imprisoned for crimes that, if committed by a man,\r\nwere punished by simple branding in the hand; and other crimes which\r\nhe could atone for by a fine, were punished in her case by burning\r\nalive. Down to the end of the eighteenth century the punishment of a\r\nwife who had murdered her husband was burning[204] alive; while if the\r\nhusband murdered the wife, his was hanging, \"the same as if he had\r\nmurdered any stranger.\" Her crime was petit treason, and her\r\npunishment was the same as that of the slave who had murdered her\r\nmaster. For woman there existed no \"benefit of clergy,\" which in a man\r\nwho could read, greatly lessened his punishment; this ability to read\r\nenabling him to perform certain priestly functions and securing him\r\nimmunity in crime. The Church having first made woman ineligible to\r\nthe priesthood, punished her on account of the restrictions of its own\r\nmaking. We who talk of the burning of wives upon the funeral pyres of\r\nhusbands in India, may well turn our eyes to the records of Christian\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nWhere marriage is wholly or partially under ecclesiastical law,\r\nwoman's degradation surely follows; but in Catholic and Protestant\r\ncountries a more decent veil has been thrown over this sacrifice of\r\nwoman than under some forms of the Greek Church, where the wife is\r\ndelivered to the husband under this formula: \"Here, wolf, take thy\r\nlamb!\" and the bridegroom is presented with a whip, giving his bride a\r\nfew blows as part of the ceremony, and bidding her draw off his boots\r\nas a symbol of her subjugation to him. With such an entrance ceremony,\r\nit may well be surmised that the marriage relation permits of the most\r\nrevolting tyranny. In Russia, until recently, the wife who killed her\r\nhusband while he was chastising her, was buried alive, her head only\r\nbeing left above ground. Many lingered for days before the mercy of\r\ndeath reached them.\r\n\r\nIvan Panim, a Russian exile, now a student in Harvard College, made\r\nthe following statement in a speech at the Massachusetts Woman\r\nSuffrage Convention, held in February, 1881:\r\n\r\n     A short time ago the wife of a well-to-do peasant came to a\r\n     justice of one of the district courts in Russia and demanded\r\n     protection from the cruelty of her husband. She proved\r\n     conclusively by the aid of competent witnesses, that he had bound\r\n     her naked to a stake during the cold weather, on the street, and\r\n     asked the passers-by to strike her; and whenever they refused, he\r\n     struck her himself. He fastened her, moreover, to the ground, put\r\n     heavy stones and weights on her and broke one of her arms. The\r\n     court declared the husband \"not guilty.\" \"It cannot afford,\" it\r\n     said, \"to teach woman to disobey the commands of her husband.\"\r\n     This is by no means an extreme or isolated case. Few, indeed,\r\n     become known to the public through the courts or through the\r\n     press.[205]\r\n\r\nCanon law made its greatest encroachments at the period that chivalry\r\nwas at its height; the outward show of respect and honor to woman\r\nkeeping pace in its false pretense with the destruction of her legal\r\nrights. Woman's moral degradation was at this time so great that a\r\ncommunity of women was even proposed, and was sustained by Jean de\r\nMeung, the \"Poet of Chivalry,\" in his Roman de la Rose. Christine of\r\nPisa, the first strictly literary woman of Western Europe, took up her\r\npen in defense of her sex against the general libidinous spirit of the\r\nage, writing in opposition to Meung.\r\n\r\nUnder Feudalism, under Celibacy, under Chivalry, under the\r\nReformation, under the principles of new sects of the nineteenth\r\ncentury--the Perfectionists and Mormons alike--we find this one idea\r\nof woman's inferiority, and her creation as a subject of man's\r\npassions openly or covertly promulgated.\r\n\r\nThe Salic law not only denied to women the right to reign, but to the\r\ninheritance of houses and lands. One of its famous articles was:\r\n\"Salic land shall not fall to women; the inheritance shall devolve\r\nexclusively on the males.\" The fact of sex not only prohibited woman's\r\ninheritance of thrones and of lands, but there were forms in this law\r\nby which a man might \"separate himself from his family, getting free\r\nfrom all obligations of relationship and entering upon an entire\r\nindependence.\" History does not tell us to what depths of degradation\r\nthis disseverance of all family ties reduced the women of his\r\nhousehold, who could neither inherit house or land. The formation of\r\nthe Salic code is still buried in the mists of antiquity; it is,\r\nhowever, variously regarded as having originated in the fourth and in\r\nthe seventh century, many laws of its code being, like English common\r\nlaw, unwritten, and others showing \"double origin.\" But our interest\r\ndoes not so greatly lie in its origin, as in the fact that after the\r\nconversion of the Franks to Christianity the law was revised, and all\r\nparts deemed inconsistent with this religion were revoked. The\r\nrestrictions upon woman were retained.\r\n\r\nWoman's wrongs under the Reformation, we discover by glancing at\r\ndifferent periods. The Cromwellian era exhibited an increase of piety.\r\nPuritanism here had its birth, but brought no element of toleration to\r\nwoman. Lydia Maria Child, in her \"History of Woman,\" says:\r\n\r\n     Under the Commonwealth society assumed a new and stern aspect.\r\n     Women were in disgrace; it was everywhere reiterated from the\r\n     pulpit that woman caused man's expulsion from Paradise, and ought\r\n     to be shunned by Christians as one of the greatest temptations of\r\n     Satan. \"Man,\" said they, \"is conceived in sin and brought forth\r\n     in iniquity; it was his complacency to woman that caused his\r\n     first debasement; let him not, therefore, glory in his shame; let\r\n     him not worship the fountain of his corruption.\" Learning and\r\n     accomplishments were alike discouraged; and women confined to a\r\n     knowledge of cooking, family medicines, and the unintelligible\r\n     theological discussions of the day.\r\n\r\nA writer about this period, said: \"She that knoweth how to compound a\r\npudding is more desirable than she who skillfully compoundeth a poem.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Reformation, Luther at first continued celibate,\r\nbut thinking \"to vex the Pope,\" he suddenly, at the age of forty-two,\r\ngave his influence against celibacy by marriage with Catherine Von\r\nBora, a former nun. But although thus becoming an example of priestly\r\nmarriage under the new order of things, Luther's whole course shows\r\nthat he did not believe in woman's equality with man. He took with him\r\nthe old theory of her subordination. It was his maxim that \"no gown or\r\ngarment worse becomes a woman than that she will be wise.\" Although\r\nopposing monastic life, the home under the reformation was governed by\r\nmany of its rules for woman.\r\n\r\n_First_. She was to be under obedience to the masculine head of the\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\n_Second_. She was to be constantly employed for his benefit.\r\n\r\n_Third_. Her society was strictly chosen for her by her master and\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_. This masculine family head was a general father confessor,\r\nto whom she was held responsible in thought and deed.\r\n\r\n_Fifth_. Neither genius nor talent could free woman from such control,\r\nwithout consent.\r\n\r\nLuther, though free from the lasciviousness of the old priesthood, was\r\nnot monogamic in principle. When applied to by the German Elector,\r\nPhilip,[206] Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, for permission to marry a\r\nsecond wife, while his first, Margaret of Savoy, was still living,\r\nLuther called a synod of six of the principal reformers, who in joint\r\nconsultation decided that as the Bible nowhere condemned polygamy, and\r\nas it had been invariably practiced by the highest dignitaries of the\r\nChurch, the required permission should be granted. History does not\r\ntell us that the wife was consulted in the matter. She was held as in\r\ngeneral subordination to the powers that be, as well as in special\r\nsubordination to her husband; but more degrading than all else is the\r\nfact that the doctrine of unchastity for man was brought into the\r\nReformation, as not inconsistent with the principles of the\r\nGospel.[207]\r\n\r\nMany Protestant divines have written in favor of polygamy. John Lyser,\r\na Lutheran minister, living in the latter part of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, defended it strongly in a work entitled \"Polygamia\r\nTriumphatrix.\" A former general of the Capuchin Order, converted to\r\nthe Protestant faith, published, in the sixteenth century, a book of\r\n\"Dialogues in Favor of Polygamy.\" Rev. Mr. Madan, a Protestant divine,\r\nin a treatise called \"Thalypthora,\" maintained that Paul's injunctions\r\nthat bishops should be the husbands of one wife, signified that laymen\r\nwere permitted to marry more than one. The scholarly William Ellery\r\nChanning could find no prohibition of polygamy in the New Testament.\r\nIn his \"Remarks on the Character and Writings of John Milton,\" he\r\nsays: \"We believe it to be an indisputable fact, that although\r\nChristianity was first preached in Asia, which had been from the\r\nearliest days the seat of polygamy, the apostles never denounced it as\r\na crime, and never required their converts to put away all wives but\r\none. No express prohibition of polygamy is found in the New\r\nTestament.\" The legitimate result of such views is seen in Mormonism,\r\nthe latest Protestant sect, which claims its authority from the Bible\r\nas well as from the Book of Mormon. We give the remarks recently made\r\nin defence of polygamy by Bishop Lunt of the Mormon Church, to a\r\nreporter of _The San Francisco Chronicle_:\r\n\r\n     God revealed to Joseph Smith the polygamous system. It is quite\r\n     true that his widow declared that no such revelation was ever\r\n     made, but that was because she had lost the spirit. God commanded\r\n     the human race to multiply and replenish the earth. Abraham had\r\n     two wives, and the Almighty honored the second one by a direct\r\n     communication, Jacob had Leah and Zilpah. David had a plurality\r\n     of wives, and was a man after God's own heart. God gave him\r\n     Saul's wives, and only condemned his adulteries. Moses, Gideon,\r\n     and Joshua had each a plurality of wives. Solomon had wives and\r\n     concubines by hundreds, though we do not believe in the concubine\r\n     system. We leave that to the Gentiles. Virtue and chastity wither\r\n     beneath the monogamic institution, which was borrowed from the\r\n     pagan nations by the early Christians. It was prophesied that in\r\n     the latter days seven women would lay hold of one man and demand\r\n     to bear his name, that they might not be held in dishonor. The\r\n     Protestants and Catholics assail us with very poor grace when it\r\n     is remembered that the first pillars of the religion they claim\r\n     to profess were men like the saints of Utah--polygamists. The\r\n     fact can not be denied. Polygamy is virtually encouraged and\r\n     taught by example by the Old Testament. It may appear shocking\r\n     and blasphemous to Gentiles for us to say so, but we hold that\r\n     Jesus Christ himself was a polygamist. He was surrounded by women\r\n     constantly, as the Scriptures attest, and those women were His\r\n     polygamous wives. The vast disparity between the sexes in all\r\n     settled communities is another argument in favor of polygamy, to\r\n     say nothing of the disinclination among young male Gentiles to\r\n     marrying. The monogamic system condemns millions of women to\r\n     celibacy. A large proportion of them stray from the path of\r\n     right, and these unfortunates induce millions of men to forego\r\n     marriage. As I have said, virtue and chastity wither under the\r\n     monogamic system.\r\n\r\n     There are no illegitimate children in Utah; there are no\r\n     libertines; there are no brothels, excepting where the presence\r\n     of Gentiles creates the demand for them. Even then our people do\r\n     what they can to root out such places. There is a positive\r\n     advantage in having more than one wife. It is impossible to find\r\n     a Gentile home, where comforts and plenty prevail, in which there\r\n     is only one woman. No one woman can manage a household. She must\r\n     have assistance. Hence we claim that when a man marries a second\r\n     wife, he actually benefits the first one, and contributes to her\r\n     ease, and relieves her of a large burden of care. The duties of\r\n     the household are divided between the two women, and everything\r\n     moves on harmoniously and peacefully. The whole thing is a matter\r\n     of education. A girl reared under the monogamic system may look\r\n     with abhorrence on ours; our young women do not do so. They\r\n     expect, when they marry a man, that he will some day take another\r\n     wife, and they consider it quite natural that he should do so. In\r\n     wealthy Gentile communities the concubine system largely takes\r\n     the place of the polygamous system. Any man of intelligence,\r\n     observation, and travel, knows that such is the case. The fact is\r\n     ignored by general consent, and little is said about it, and\r\n     nothing is written about it. It is not regarded as a proper\r\n     subject of conversation or of publication. How much better to\r\n     give lonely women a home while they are uncontaminated, and honor\r\n     them with your name, and perpetually provide for them, and before\r\n     the world recognize your own offspring! The polygamous system is\r\n     the only natural one, and the time rapidly approaches when it\r\n     will be the most conspicuous and beneficent of American\r\n     institutions. It will be the grand characteristic feature of\r\n     American society. Our women are contented with it--more, they are\r\n     the most ardent defenders of it to be found in Utah. If the\r\n     question were put to a vote to-morrow, nine-tenths of the women\r\n     of Utah would vote to perpetuate polygamy.\r\n\r\nThe Mormons claim that polygamy is countenanced by the New Testament\r\nas well as by the Old. They interpret Paul's teaching in regard to\r\nbishops, while commanding them to marry one wife, as also not\r\nprohibiting them from marrying more than one; their interpretation of\r\nthis passage slightly varying from that of Rev. Mr. Madan.\r\n\r\nRev. C. P. Lyford, of the Methodist Church, long a resident of Utah,\r\nin a letter of February 19, 1881, to _The Northern Christian\r\nAdvocate_, a Methodist paper published in Syracuse, says:\r\n\r\n     We read of the stories of India and China, and the wonder of\r\n     their existence is lost in their antiquity. Mohammedanism, with\r\n     its 1,200 years of existence, amazes us that it should have\r\n     obtained such a footing. But here, in our day, surrounded with\r\n     all the advantages of the nineteenth century, that a people\r\n     should have come up from nothing; that a man of low family,\r\n     himself a worthless character, should have come up with a lie in\r\n     his mouth and a stolen manuscript in his hand, and be found\r\n     dictating terms to a strong government, and become an absolute\r\n     despot in a republic, is the most amazing fact of history. It\r\n     took the Methodist Church forty years to get a membership of\r\n     138,000. Mormonism in forty-four years counted 250,000. It seems\r\n     incredible, nevertheless it is a fact. In this brief space of\r\n     time it has also been able to nullify our laws, oppose our\r\n     institutions, openly perpetrate crimes, be represented in\r\n     Congress, boast of the helplessness of the nation to prevent\r\n     these things, and give the Church supremacy over the State and\r\n     the people. Bills introduced in Congress adequate to their\r\n     overthrow have been year after year allowed to fall to the ground\r\n     without action upon them.\r\n\r\n     Our public men can only pronounce against the crime of polygamy;\r\n     the press can see only polygamy in Utah; the public mind is\r\n     impressed with only the heinousness of polygamy. Back of polygamy\r\n     is the tree that produces it and many kindred evils more dear to\r\n     the Mormon rulers. They do not care for all the sentiment or law\r\n     against this one fruit of the tree, if the tree itself is left to\r\n     stand. The tree--the prolific cause of so many and so great evils\r\n     in Utah, the greatest curse of the territory, the strength of\r\n     Mormonism, and its impregnable wall of defence against\r\n     Christianity and civilization, is that arbitrary, despotic, and\r\n     absolute hierarchy known as the Mormon Priesthood.\r\n\r\nMr. Lyford has partial insight into the truth when he says \"back of\r\npolygamy is the tree that produces it and many kindred evils\"; but in\r\ndefining that tree as the hierarchy--the priesthood--he has not\r\nreached the entire truth. He does not touch the ground which supports\r\nthe tree. Polygamy is but one development of the doctrine of woman's\r\ncreated inferiority, the constant tendency of which is to make her a\r\nmere slave, under every form of religion extant, and of which the\r\ncomplex marriage of the Oneida Community was but another logical\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nWhen woman interprets the Bible for herself, it will be in the\r\ninterest of a higher morality, a purer home. Monogamy is woman's\r\ndoctrine, as polygamy is man's. Backofen, the Swiss jurist, says that\r\nthe regulation of marriage by which, in primitive times, it became\r\npossible for a woman to belong only to one man, came about by a\r\nreligious reformation, wherein the women, in armed conflict, obtained\r\na victory over men.\r\n\r\nIn Christian countries to-day, the restrictions on woman in the\r\nmarried relation are much greater than upon man.[208] Adultery, which\r\nis polygamy outside of the married relation, is everywhere held as\r\nmore venial in man than in woman. In England, while the husband can\r\neasily obtain a divorce from his wife, upon the ground of adultery, it\r\nis almost impossible for the wife to obtain a divorce upon the same\r\nground. Nothing short of the husband's bringing another woman into the\r\nhouse, to sustain wifely relations to him, at all justifies her in\r\nproceeding for a separation; and even then, the husband retains\r\ncontrol of the wife's property. A trial[209] in England is scarcely\r\nended in which a husband willed his wife's property to his mistress\r\nand illegitimate children. The courts not only decided in his favor,\r\nbut to this legal robbery of the wife, added the insult of telling her\r\nthat a part of her own money was enough for her, and that she ought to\r\nbe willing that her husband's mistress and illegitimate children\r\nshould share it with her.\r\n\r\nMilton's \"Paradise Lost\" is responsible for many existing views in\r\nregard to woman. After the Reformation, as women began to waken to\r\nliterature, came Milton, a patriot of patriots--as patriots were held\r\nin those days, a man who talked of liberty for men--but who held man\r\nto stand in God's place toward woman. Although it has been affirmed\r\nthat in his blindness Milton dictated his great epic to his daughters,\r\nand a Scotch artist has painted the scene (a picture recently\r\npurchased by the Lenox Library), yet this is one of the myths men call\r\nhistory, and amuse themselves in believing. This tale of blind Milton\r\ndictating \"Paradise Lost\" to his daughters, is a trick[210] designed\r\nto play upon our sympathies. Old Dr. Johnson said of Milton, that he\r\nwould not allow his daughters[211] even to learn to write. Between\r\nMilton and his wives, we know there was tyranny upon one side and\r\nhatred on the other. He could not gain the love of either wife or\r\ndaughter, and yet he is the man who did so much to popularize the idea\r\nof woman's subordination to man. \"He, for God; she, for God in\r\nhim\"--as taught in the famous line: \"God thy law, thou mine.\"\r\n\r\nThat the clerical teaching of woman's subordination to man was not\r\nalone a doctrine of the dark ages, is proven by the most abundant\r\ntestimony of to-day. The famous See trial of 1876, which shook not\r\nonly the Presbytery of Newark, but the whole Synod of New Jersey, and\r\nfinally, the General Presbyterian Assembly of the United States, was\r\nbased upon the doctrine of the divinely appointed subordination of\r\nwoman to man, and arose simply because Dr. See admitted two\r\nladies[212] to his pulpit to speak upon temperance; which act, Rev.\r\nDr. Craven, the prosecutor, declared to have been \"an indecency in the\r\nsight of Jehovah.\" He expressed the general clerical and Church view,\r\nwhen he said:\r\n\r\n     I believe the subject involves the honor of my God. I believe the\r\n     subject involves the headship and crown of Jesus. Woman was made\r\n     for man and became first in the transgression. My argument is\r\n     that subordination is natural, the subordination of sex. Dr. See\r\n     has admitted marital subordination, but this is not enough; there\r\n     exists a created subordination; a divinely arranged and appointed\r\n     subordination of woman as woman, to man as man. Woman was made\r\n     for man and became first in the transgression. The proper\r\n     condition of the adult female is marriage; the general rule for\r\n     ladies is marriage. Women without children, it might be said,\r\n     could preach, but they are under the general rule of\r\n     subordination. It is not allowed women to speak in the Church.\r\n     Man's place is on the platform. It is positively base for a woman\r\n     to speak in the pulpit; it is base in the sight of Jehovah. The\r\n     whole question is one of subordination.\r\n\r\nThus, before a large audience composed mainly of women, Dr. Craven\r\nstood, and with denunciatory manner, frequently bringing his fists or\r\nhis Bible emphatically down, devoted a four hours' speech to proving\r\nthat the Bible taught woman's subordination; one of his statements\r\nbeing that \"in every country, under every clime, from the peasant\r\nwoman of Naples with a handkerchief over her hair, to the women before\r\nhim with bonnets, every one wore something upon her head in token of\r\nher subordination.\" Dr. Craven's position was fully sustained by many\r\nbrother clergymen, some of whom enthusiastically shouted \"Amen!\"\r\n\r\nDr. Ballantine considered the subject too simple for an argument. Dr.\r\nFew Smith, although he admired Miss Smiley, more than almost any other\r\norator he had ever listened to, did not want her or any other woman to\r\npermanently occupy the Presbyterian pulpit. Dr. Wilson rejoiced to see\r\nso many women crowding in the lecture-room; but Brother See should not\r\ntake all the glory to himself. He was glad to see the women take so\r\ndeep an interest in the subject under discussion; but as he looked at\r\nthem he asked himself, \"What will all the little children do, while\r\nthese women are away from home?\"[213]\r\n\r\nThe Christianity of to-day thus continues to teach the existence of a\r\nsuperior and an inferior sex within the Church, possessing different\r\nrights, and held accountable to a different code of morals, when even\r\nwoman's dress is held as typical of her inferiority. Not alone did Dr.\r\nCraven express this idea, but the Right Rev. Dr. Coxe refused the\r\nsacrament to the lady patients at the Clifton Springs Sanitarium in\r\n1868, whose heads were uncovered. This same Right Rev. Dr. Coxe, in a\r\nspeech at his installation as first President of Ingham Seminary for\r\nyoung ladies, declared \"the laws of God to be plainly Salic.\"\r\n\r\nRev. Knox-Little, a High-Church clergyman of England, spent a few\r\nweeks in the United States during the fall of 1880. In the course of\r\nhis stay in Philadelphia he preached a \"Sermon to Women,\" in the large\r\nchurch of St. Clements. The following extract from the report in the\r\nTimes of that city shows its teachings:\r\n\r\n     \"God made himself to be born of a woman to sanctify the virtue of\r\n     endurance; loving submission is an attribute of woman; men are\r\n     logical, but women lacking this quality, have an intricacy of\r\n     thought. There are those who think women can be taught logic;\r\n     this is a mistake. They can never by any power of education\r\n     arrive at the same mental status as that enjoyed by men, but they\r\n     have a quickness of apprehension, which is usually called leaping\r\n     at conclusions, that is astonishing. There, then, we have\r\n     distinctive traits of a woman, namely, endurance, loving\r\n     submission, and quickness of apprehension. Wifehood is the\r\n     crowning glory of a woman. In it she is bound for all time. To\r\n     her husband she owes the duty of unqualified obedience. There is\r\n     no crime which a man can commit which justifies his wife in\r\n     leaving him or applying for that monstrous thing, divorce. It is\r\n     her duty to subject herself to him always, and no crime that he\r\n     can commit can justify her lack of obedience. If he be a bad or\r\n     wicked man she may gently remonstrate with him, but refuse him\r\n     never. Let divorce be anathema; curse it; curse this accursed\r\n     thing, divorce; curse it, curse it! Think of the blessedness of\r\n     having children. I am the father of many children and there have\r\n     been those who have ventured to pity me, 'Keep your pity for\r\n     yourself,' I have replied. 'They never cost me a single pang.' In\r\n     this matter let woman exercise that endurance and loving\r\n     submission which with intricacy of thought are their only\r\n     characteristics.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a sermon as the above, preached to woman, under the fall blaze of\r\nnineteenth century civilization, needs few comments. In it woman's\r\ninferiority and subordination are as openly asserted as at any time\r\nduring the dark ages. According to Rev. Knox-Little, woman possesses\r\nno responsibility; she is deprived of conscience, intelligent thought,\r\nself-respect, and is simply an appendage to man, a thing. As the\r\nclergy in the middle ages divided rights into those of persons and\r\nthings, themselves being the persons, the laity, things, so the Rev.\r\nKnox-Little and his ilk of to-day divide the world into persons and\r\nthings,--men being the persons and women the things.\r\n\r\nIt should require but little thought upon woman's part to see how\r\nclosely her disabilities are interwoven with present religious belief\r\nas to her inferiority and pre-destined subordination. If she needs aid\r\nto thought, the Knox-Littles will help her. Have protests against his\r\nblasphemous doctrine been made by his brother clergymen? Not one. Has\r\na single church denied his degrading theory? Not one. He has been\r\nallowed in this sermon to stand as the representative, not only of\r\nHigh-Church theology in regard to woman, but as expressing the belief\r\nof all churches in her creation and existence as an inferior and\r\nappendage to man.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely a Protestant sect that has not, within a few years,\r\nin some way, placed itself upon record in regard to woman's\r\nsubordination. The Pan-Presbyterian Council that assembled in\r\nEdinburgh a few years since, refused to admit a woman even as a\r\nlistener to its proceedings, although women constitute at least\r\ntwo-thirds of the membership of that Church. A solitary woman who\r\npersisted in remaining to listen to the discussions of this body, was\r\nremoved by force; \"six stalwart Presbyterians\" lending their ungentle\r\naid to her ejection. The same Pan-Presbyterian body when in session in\r\nPhiladelphia in the summer of 1880, laughed to scorn the suggestion of\r\na liberal member, that the status of woman in the Church should\r\nreceive some consideration. The speaker referred to the Sisters of\r\nCharity in the Catholic Church, and to the position of woman among the\r\nQuakers; but although the question was twice introduced, it was as\r\noften met with derisive laughter, and no action was taken upon it. A\r\nvote of the New England Society of Friends at their meeting in\r\nNewport, 1878, proves that as liberal as they have been considered\r\ntoward woman, even they have not in the past held her as upon a plane\r\nof perfect equality. This body voted that hereafter \"women shall be\r\neligible to office in the management of the Society, shall sign all\r\nconveyances of real estate made by the Society, and shall be\r\nconsidered equal to the opposite sex.\"\r\n\r\nThe Congregational Church is placed upon record through laws governing\r\ncertain of its bodies:\r\n\r\n     \"By the word 'church' is meant the adult males duly admitted and\r\n     retained in the First Evangelical Congregational Church in\r\n     Cambridgeport, present at any regular meeting of said church and\r\n     voting by a majority.\"[214]\r\n\r\nIn the Unitarian and Universalist churches, which ordain women to\r\npreach and administer the ordinances, these women pastors are made to\r\nfeel that the innovation is not universally acceptable.\r\n\r\nThe Methodist Church, professing to stand upon a broad basis, still\r\nrefuses to ordain its most influential women preachers, and, within\r\nthe year, has even deprived them of license, though one of them[215]\r\nhas brought more converts to the Church than a dozen of its most\r\ninfluential bishops during the same period. To such bitter lengths has\r\nthe opposition to woman's ordination been carried, that a certain\r\nreverend gentlemen, in debating the subject, declared that he would\r\noppose the admission of the mother of our Lord into the ministry, the\r\ndebate taking on a most unseemly form. The _Syracuse Sunday Morning\r\nCourier_ of March 4, 1877, reported this debate as follows:\r\n\r\n                           WOMEN AS PREACHERS.\r\n\r\n     The subject of permitting women to preach in Methodist pulpits\r\n     was incidentally, but rather racily discussed at the Methodist\r\n     ministers' meeting in New York city a few days since. A Miss\r\n     Oliver--a more or less reverend lady--had been invited to preach\r\n     to the ministers at their next meeting, and the question was\r\n     raised, by what authority she was invited? Thereupon Brother\r\n     Buckley took the floor and gave expression to his dissent in the\r\n     following terms:\r\n\r\n     I am opposed to inviting any woman to preach before this meeting.\r\n     If the mother of our Lord were on earth I should oppose her\r\n     preaching here. [Sensation and murmurs of disapproval]. Oh, I do\r\n     not mind that, I like at the beginning of a speech to find that\r\n     there are two sides to my question. There is no power in the\r\n     Methodist Church by which a woman can be licensed to preach; this\r\n     is history, this is the report made at the last General\r\n     Conference. It is, therefore, not legal for any quarterly\r\n     conference to license a woman to preach, nevertheless here is a\r\n     woman who claims to have such a license, and we are asked to\r\n     invite her to preach.\r\n\r\n     A BROTHER: We have the right!\r\n\r\n     BROTHER BUCKLEY: Oh, you have the right to believe the moon is\r\n     made of green cheese, but yet have no right to commit the\r\n     ministers of this city on an unsettled Church question. [Laughter\r\n     and applause]. The tendency of men--now here is a chance to\r\n     hiss--the tendency of men to endeavor to force female preachers\r\n     on the Church, and the desire to run after female preachers, is,\r\n     as Dr. Finney said to the students at Oberlin, an aberration of\r\n     amativeness. [Roars of laughter and applause]. When men are moved\r\n     by women, then by men under the same circumstances, it is\r\n     certainly due to an aberration of amativeness. [Applause and\r\n     more laughter]. For some time the male and female students at\r\n     Oberlin used to have their prayer-meetings together, but after a\r\n     time they divided, and the young men complained to Dr. Finney\r\n     that the Holy Ghost no longer came with equal force. Dr. Finney\r\n     said this showed amativeness, or that the men were back-sliding.\r\n     [Applause].\r\n\r\n     BROTHER DICKINSON: As to the talk of amativeness, what about our\r\n     holiness meetings and seaside meetings, where we go to hear\r\n     woman, and to be moved by her words and her personality?\r\n     [Applause]. Why are there so many women in the Church? It must be\r\n     amativeness which urges them to go and hear men preach.\r\n     [Laughter].\r\n\r\n     Dr. ROACH: If this meeting has any dignity, has any Christian\r\n     intelligence, has any weight of character, it ought not to take\r\n     this action. [Laughter]. What wildness, what fanaticism, what\r\n     strange freaks will we not take on next? [Laughter and applause].\r\n\r\n     Brother McAllister and others took part in the discussion, and\r\n     finally, amid cries of \"Motion,\" \"Question,\" points of order, and\r\n     the utmost confusion, the question was put, and the meeting\r\n     refused to invite Miss Oliver to preach by a vote of 46 to 38.\r\n     The result was received with ejaculations of \"Amen\" and \"Thank\r\n     God\" and \"God bless Brother Buckley.\" The Chair announced that\r\n     Brother Kittrell will preach next Monday on \"Entire\r\n     Satisfaction,\" and the meeting adjourned.\r\n\r\nMiss Oliver appealed to the General Conference of the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Church in session in Cincinnati, May, 1880, for full\r\ninstallment and ordination. In this appeal she said:\r\n\r\n     I am so thoroughly convinced that the Lord has laid commands upon\r\n     me in this direction, that it becomes with me a question of my\r\n     own soul's salvation. I have passed through tortures to which the\r\n     flames of martyrdom would be nothing, for they would end in a\r\n     day; and through all this time, and to-day, I could turn off to\r\n     positions of comparative ease and profit. I ask you, fathers and\r\n     brethren, tell me what you would do in my place? Tell me what you\r\n     would wish the Church to do toward you, were you in my place?\r\n     Please apply the golden rule, and vote in Conference accordingly.\r\n\r\nAs answer to this appeal, and in reply to all women seeking the\r\nministry of that Church, the Conference passed the following\r\nresolution:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That women have already all the rights and privileges\r\n     in the Methodist Church that are good for them, and that it is\r\n     not expedient to make any change in the books of discipline that\r\n     would open the doors for their ordination to the ministry.[216]\r\n\r\nAn Episcopal Church Convention meeting in Boston in the summer of\r\n1877, busied itself in preparing canons upon marriage and divorce,\r\nthus aiming to reach the finger of the Protestant Church down to a\r\ncontrol of this most private family relation. The Diocesan Convention\r\nof South Carolina, in the spring of 1878, denied women the right to\r\nvote upon Church matters, although some churches in the diocese\r\ncounted but five male members.\r\n\r\nNot alone in her request for ordination has woman met with opposition,\r\nbut in her effort for any separate church work. The formation of\r\nwoman's foreign missionary societies was bitterly opposed by the\r\ndifferent evangelical denominations, although they have raised more\r\nmoney than the male societies have ever been able to do--even helping\r\nthem pay old debts--and have reached large classes of their own sex\r\nwhom the male societies were powerless to touch. By thus supplementing\r\nmen's work, they have made themselves acceptable.\r\n\r\nNot only do councils, convocations, conferences, conventions, synods,\r\nand assemblies proclaim woman's inferiority, but Sunday-schools teach\r\nthe same doctrine. A letter from a correspondent of _The National\r\nCitizen and Ballot-Box_ (Syracuse, N. Y.), in August, 1880, said:\r\n\r\n     Our Sunday-schools here have just finished the lesson on the\r\n     creation and fall of man, and those of us who are capable of\r\n     feeling, felt keenly the thrusts at woman for her infidelity to\r\n     God's laws, and her overpowering influence in dragging man from\r\n     his exalted position in life into a bondage of sin and death, and\r\n     that she is to be held responsible for all the accumulated sins\r\n     of the ages. One man said that \"had not Eve been _lurking_ around\r\n     where she had no business, the devil would never have tempted\r\n     her.\" Another said, \"Had it not been for woman, we might to-day\r\n     be living in ease and splendor,\" and I listened to hear them say\r\n     the fallen angel was a woman.\r\n\r\nThis same doctrine is taught in the public schools. _The Republican_,\r\nof Havre de Grace, Maryland, in its issue of August 6, 1880, gave the\r\nfollowing report of a speech at that time:\r\n\r\n     Thus spoke Master Showell at the Berlin (Wicomico County)\r\n     High-School commencement: \"By woman was Eden lost and man cursed.\r\n     If you trust her, give up all hopes of heaven. She can not love,\r\n     because she is too selfish. She may have a fancy, but that is\r\n     fleeting. Her smiles are deceit; her vows are traced in sand. She\r\n     is a thread of candor with a web of wiles. Her charity is\r\n     hypocrisy; she is deception every way--hair, teeth, complexion,\r\n     heart, tongue, and all. Oh, I hate you, ye cold composition of\r\n     art!\"\r\n\r\nSermons are frequently preached in opposition to woman's demand for\r\nequality of right in Church and State. On the Sunday following the\r\nThirtieth Anniversary Woman Suffrage Convention, held in Rochester,\r\n1878, the Rev. A. H. Strong, D.D., President of the Baptist\r\nTheological Seminary of that city, preached upon \"Woman's Place and\r\nWork,\" saying:\r\n\r\n     In the very creation of mankind in the garden of beauty, God\r\n     ordained the subordination of woman.\r\n\r\nThis president of a theological seminary, where Christian theology is\r\ntaught to embryo Christian ministers, said that woman's subordination\r\nwould be most perfectly seen in the \"Christian humility and gentleness\r\nand endurance of her character, and in her indisposition to assume the\r\nplace or do the work of man,\" forgetting, apparently, that\r\nsubordination, humility, and endurance are precisely the qualities\r\nwhich tend to destroy nobleness of character.\r\n\r\nThe sermon was especially directed against the following resolutions\r\nof this Convention, which throughout the country met much clerical\r\ncriticism and opposition:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That as the duty of every individual is\r\n     self-development, the lessons of self-sacrifice and obedience\r\n     taught women by the Christian Church have been fatal, not only to\r\n     her own highest interests, but through her have also dwarfed and\r\n     degraded the race.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the fundamental principle of the Protestant\r\n     Reformation, the right of individual conscience and judgment in\r\n     the interpretation of Scripture, heretofore conceded to and\r\n     exercised by man alone, should now be claimed by woman, and that\r\n     in her most vital interests she should no longer trust authority,\r\n     but be guided by her own reason.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is through the perversion of the religious\r\n     element in woman, cultivating the emotions at the expense of her\r\n     reason, playing upon her hopes and fears of the future, holding\r\n     this life, with all its high duties, forever in abeyance to that\r\n     which is to come, that she, and the children she has trained,\r\n     have been so completely subjugated by priestcraft and\r\n     superstition.\r\n\r\nProfessor Christlieb, a distinguished German clergyman who was in\r\nattendance upon the Evangelical Alliance in New York, a few years\r\nsince, expressed severe condemnation of the marriage relation as he\r\nsaw it in this country. His criticism is a good exemplification of the\r\ngeneral religious view taken of woman's relation to man. After his\r\nreturn to Germany, a young American student called, it is related,\r\nupon the professor with a note of introduction, and was cordially\r\nreceived by the German, who, while he praised this country, expressed\r\nmuch solicitude about its future. On being asked his reasons, he\r\nfrankly expressed his opinion that \"the Spirit of Christ\" was not\r\nhere, and proceeded to illustrate his meaning. He seriously declared\r\nthat on more than one occasion he had heard an American woman say to\r\nher husband, \"Dear, will you bring me my shawl?\" and the husband had\r\nbrought it! Worse than this, he had seen a husband, returning home at\r\nevening, enter the parlor where his wife was sitting--perhaps in the\r\nvery best chair in the room--and the wife not only did not go and get\r\nhis slippers and dressing-gown, but she even remained seated, and left\r\nhim to find a chair as he could. In the view of this noted German\r\nclergyman, the principles of the wife's equality with the husband, as\r\nshown in the American home, is destructive of Christian\r\nprinciples.[217]\r\n\r\nClerical action to-day, proves woman to hold the same place in the\r\neyes of the Church that she did during the dark ages. Woman is as\r\nfully degraded, taking into consideration our civilization, as she\r\never was. The form alone has changed. She is no longer burned at the\r\nstake as a witch; she is no longer prostituted to feudal lords. The\r\nage has outgrown a belief in the supernatural, and feudalism is dead;\r\nyet the same principle which degraded her five hundred or a thousand\r\nyears since, still exists, even though its manifestation is not the\r\nsame. The feminine principle is still looked upon as secondary and\r\ninferior,[218] though all the facts of nature and science prove it to\r\nextend throughout creation.\r\n\r\nIt is through the Church idea of woman that the press of the world is\r\nfilled with scandals like the one that recently agitated the Romish\r\nChurch, in which the dead Cardinal Antonelli's name was bandied about\r\nin courts of law. It is through Church interpretation of woman's\r\nposition that the suit of his putative daughter, the Countess\r\nLambertina, for his property, was decided against her on the ground\r\nthat she was \"a sacrilegious child.\" The person who commits sacrilege\r\nsteals sacred things. \"Sacrilegious\" means violating sacred things. \"A\r\nsacrilegious child\" is a child who \"violated sacred things\" by coming\r\ninto existence. Her father was holy; he did not violate holy things\r\nwhen he violated and ruined a woman's life. He committed no sacrilege\r\nin the eyes of the Church. His sin was nothing; but the unfortunate\r\nresult of his sin was a violation of holy things by the mere fact of\r\nher coming into existence. What irony of all that is called holy!\r\n\r\nIt is because the Church has taught that woman was created solely for\r\nman, that in tearing asunder a recent will in New York, it was proven\r\nthat the husband, indebted though he was to his wife for the beginning\r\nof his vast fortune, incarcerated her while sane in a lunatic asylum,\r\nbecause she objected to his practical polygamy by his introduction of\r\na mistress into the family.\r\n\r\nPolitical despotism has now its strongest hold in the theory of\r\nwoman's created subordination. Woman has been legislated for as a\r\nclass, and not as a human being upon a basis of equality with man, but\r\nas an inferior to whom a different code was applicable.\r\n\r\nOur recent Secretary of State, William M. Evarts, when counsel in the\r\nBeecher-Tilton trial, defined woman's legal and theological position\r\nas that of subordination to man, declaring that notwithstanding\r\nchanging customs and the amenities of modern life, women were not\r\nfree, but were held in the hollow of man's hand, to be crushed at his\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n     Then Mr. Evarts read from various legal authorities instances and\r\n     opinions bearing upon the subjugation of weak wives by strong\r\n     husbands, the gist of them being that confessions of guilt\r\n     obtained by such husbands from such wives are not entitled to\r\n     great weight. He continued:\r\n\r\n                  RECOGNIZING THE PRINCIPLES OF MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n     This institution of marriage, framed in our nature, built up in\r\n     our civilization, studied, contemplated, understood by the\r\n     jurisprudence of ages, is a solid and real institution, and for\r\n     its great benefits, and as a necessary part of them, it carries\r\n     not only the fact of the wife's subordination to the husband, but\r\n     of the merciful interpretation of that subordination[219] which\r\n     sensible, instructed men ever accord in practical life, and which\r\n     the judges pronounce from the bench, and the juries confirm by\r\n     their verdicts. Now, gentlemen, you may think that is our\r\n     advanced civilization, when so much of independence is assumed\r\n     for women, and such entire equality is accorded to them in\r\n     feeling and in sentiment by their husbands and by the world, that\r\n     the old rule of the common law interpreting this institution of\r\n     marriage, by which a wife was never held responsible to the law,\r\n     or subject to punishment for any crime committed in the presence\r\n     or under the influence of her husband, was one of those traits of\r\n     human nature belonging to ruder ages and to past times; but,\r\n     gentlemen, in our own Court of Appeals, and in the highest\r\n     tribunals of England, within the last few years, there is an\r\n     explicit recognition of these principles.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Evarts cited an English case in which a wife, who\r\n     participated in a robbery under the guidance of her husband, was\r\n     acquitted on the ground that she was irresponsible; and he added\r\n     an argument that the principle of law involved was correct. Then\r\n     he called attention to a recent case in this State, which he held\r\n     was a confirmation of the same sound theory.\r\n\r\nThe teachings of the Church that it was sinful for woman to use her\r\nown reason, to think for herself, to question authority, thus\r\nfettering her will, together with a false interpretation of Scripture,\r\nhave been the instruments to hold her, body and soul, in a slavery\r\nwhose depths of degradation can never be fathomed, whose indescribable\r\ntortures can never be understood by man.\r\n\r\nNot only has woman suffered in the Church, in society, under the laws,\r\nand in the family by this theological degradation of her sex, but in\r\nscience and literature she has met a like fate. Hypatia, who succeeded\r\nher father, Theon, in the government of the Alexandrian school, and\r\nwhose lectures were attended by the wisest men of Europe, Asia, and\r\nAfrica, was torn in pieces by a Christian mob afraid of her learning.\r\n\r\nA monument erected to Catherine Sawbridge Macaulay, as \"Patroness of\r\nLiberty,\" was removed from the Church by order of its rector. Harriet\r\nMartineau met the most strenuous opposition from bishops in her effort\r\nto teach the poor; her day-schools and even her Sunday-schools were\r\nbroken up by clerical influence. Madam Pepe-Carpentier, founder of the\r\nFrench system of primary instruction, of whom Froebel caught his\r\nkindergarten idea, found her labors interrupted, and her life harassed\r\nby clerical opposition.\r\n\r\nMary Somerville, the most eminent English mathematician of this\r\ncentury, was publicly denounced in church by Dean Cockburn, of York;\r\nand when George Eliot died a few weeks since, her lifeless remains\r\nwere refused interment in Westminster Abbey, where so many inferior\r\nauthors of the privileged sex lie buried; the grave even not covering\r\nman's efforts toward the degradation of woman.\r\n\r\nWhen Susannah Wesley dared to conduct religious services in her own\r\nhouse, and to pray for the king, contrary to her husband's wishes, he\r\nseparated from her in consequence. The husband of Annie Besant left\r\nher because she dared to investigate the Scriptures for herself, and\r\nwas sustained by the courts in taking from her the control of her\r\nlittle daughter, simply because the mother thought best not to train\r\nher in a special religious belief, but to allow her to wait until her\r\nreason developed, that she might decide her religious views for\r\nherself. A woman writing in the \"Woman's Kingdom\" department of The\r\n_Chicago Inter-Ocean_, says:\r\n\r\n     The orthodox Church has been almost suicidal in its treatment of\r\n     women (and I write as one whose name still stands on the\r\n     membership list of the Presbyterian Church). Persons who have not\r\n     walked with wounded, lacerated hearts through the terrible\r\n     realities, can form no idea of the suffering occasioned young\r\n     women whose conscience summoned them to speak for temperance and\r\n     woman suffrage, by the persecutions encountered in the Church. We\r\n     have known clergymen come straight from the pulpit where they\r\n     have talked eloquently of \"moral courage,\" of the heroism of\r\n     Martin Luther and Calvin and Wesley, and even of Garrison and\r\n     Harriet Beecher Stowe, to meet with a sneer some brave young\r\n     woman, who, with the same moral courage was proclaiming the truth\r\n     as revealed unto her. Our young women have been denied admittance\r\n     into theological schools; they have been compelled to go out into\r\n     the by-ways and hedges; they have been persecuted for\r\n     righteousness' sake. The Church has decreed that two-thirds of\r\n     its members shall be governed by the masculine one-third; but\r\n     despite this decision, woman will preach and the world will\r\n     listen.\r\n\r\nNot only has woman recognized her own degradation, but the\r\nlargest-hearted men have also seen it. Thomas W. Higginson, in an\r\naddress at the anniversary of the Young Men's Christian Union, in New\r\nYork City, as long ago as 1858, in an address upon women in Christian\r\ncivilization, said:\r\n\r\n     No man can ever speak of the position of woman so mournfully as\r\n     she has done it for herself. Charlotte Bronté, Caroline Norton,\r\n     and indeed the majority of intellectual women, from the beginning\r\n     to the end of their lives, have touched us to sadness even in\r\n     mirth, and the mournful memoirs of Mrs. Siddons, looking back\r\n     upon years when she had been the chief intellectual joy of\r\n     English society, could only deduce the hope, \"that there might be\r\n     some other world hereafter, where justice would be done to\r\n     woman.\"\r\n\r\nThe essayist, E. P. Whipple, in a recent speech before the Papyrus\r\nClub of Boston, said of George Eliot:\r\n\r\n     The great masculine creators and delineators of human character,\r\n     Homer, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Göethe, Scott, and the rest, cheer\r\n     and invigorate us even in the vivid representation of our common\r\n     humanity in its meanest, most stupid, most criminal forms. Now\r\n     comes a woman endowed not only with their large discourse of\r\n     reason, their tolerant views of life, and their intimate\r\n     knowledge of the most obscure recesses of the human heart and\r\n     brain, but with a portion of that rich, imaginative humor which\r\n     softens the savageness of the serious side of life by a quick\r\n     perception of its ludicrous side, and the result of her survey of\r\n     life is, that she depresses the mind, while the men of genius\r\n     animate it, and that she saddens the heart, while they fill it\r\n     with hopefulness and joy. I do not intend to solve a problem so\r\n     complicated as this, but I would say, as some approach to an\r\n     explanation, that this remarkable woman was born under the wrath\r\n     and curse of what our modern philosophers call \"heredity.\" She\r\n     inherited the results of man's dealings with woman during a\r\n     thousand generations of their life together.\r\n\r\nContempt for woman, the result of clerical teaching, is shown in\r\nmyriad forms. Wife-beating is still so common, even in America, that a\r\nnumber of the States have of late introduced bills especially directed\r\nto the punishment of the wife-beater. Great surprise is frequently\r\nshown by these men when arrested. \"Is she not my wife?\" is cried in\r\ntones proving the brutal husband had been trained to consider this\r\nrelationship a sufficient justification for any abuse.\r\n\r\nIn England, wives are still occasionally led to the market by a halter\r\naround the neck to be sold by the husband to the highest bidder.[220]\r\nGeorge Borrow, in his singular narrative, \"The Rommany Rye,\" says:\r\n\r\n     The sale of a wife with a halter around her neck is still a legal\r\n     transaction in England. The sale must be made in the cattle\r\n     market, as if she were a mare, \"all women being considered as\r\n     mares by old English law, and indeed called 'mares' in certain\r\n     counties where genuine old English is still preserved.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the boast of America and Europe that woman holds a higher\r\nposition in the world of work under Christianity than under pagandom.\r\nHeathen treatment of woman in this respect often points the moral and\r\nadorns the tale of returned missionaries, who are apparently forgetful\r\nthat servile labor[221] of the severest and most degrading character\r\nis performed by Christian women in highly Christian countries. In\r\nGermany, where the Reformation had its first inception, woman carries\r\na hod of mortar up steep ladders to the top of the highest buildings;\r\nor, with a coal basket strapped to her back, climbs three or four\r\nflights of stairs, her husband remaining at the foot, pipe in mouth,\r\nawaiting her return to load the hod or basket, that she may make\r\nanother ascent, the payment for her work going into the husband's\r\nhands for his uncontrolled use. Or mayhap this German wife works in\r\nthe field harnessed by the side of a cow, while her husband-master\r\nholds the plough and wields the whip. Or perhaps, harnessed with a\r\ndog, she serves the morning's milk, or drags her husband home from\r\nwork at night.\r\n\r\nIn France women act as porters, carrying the heaviest burdens and\r\nperforming the most repulsive labors at the docks, while eating food\r\nof so poor a quality that the lessening stature of the population\r\ndaily shows the result. In Holland and Prussia women drag barges on\r\nthe canal, and perform the most repulsive agricultural duties. On the\r\nAlps[222] husbands borrow and lend their wives, one neighbor not\r\nscrupling to ask the loan of another's wife to complete some farming\r\ntask, which loan is readily granted, with the understanding that the\r\nfavor is to be returned in kind. In England, scantily clothed women\r\nwork by the side of nude men in coal pits, and, harnessed to trucks,\r\nperform the severe labor of dragging coal up inclined planes to the\r\nmouth of the pit, a work testing every muscle and straining every\r\nnerve, and so severe that the stoutest men shrink from it; while their\r\ndegradation in brick-yards and iron mines has commanded the attention\r\nof philanthropists and legislators.[223]\r\n\r\nA gentleman recently travelling in Ireland blushes for his sex when he\r\nsees the employments of women, young and old. They are patient\r\ndrudges, staggering over the bogs with heavy creels of turf on their\r\nbacks, or climbing the slopes from the seashore, laden like beasts of\r\nburden with the heavy sand-dripping seaweed, or undertaking long\r\njourneys on foot into the market towns, bearing weighty hampers of\r\nfarm produce. In Montenegro, women form the beasts of burden in war,\r\nand are counted among the \"animals\" belonging to the prince. In Italy,\r\nthat land which for centuries led the world in art, women work in\r\nsqualor and degradation under the shadow of St. Peter's and the\r\nVatican for four-pence a day; while in America, under the Christianity\r\nof the nineteenth century, until within twenty years, she worked on\r\nrice and cotton plantations waist-deep in water, or under a burning\r\nsun performed the tasks demanded by a cruel master, at whose hands she\r\nalso suffered the same kind of moral degradation exacted of the serf\r\nunder feudalism. In some portions of Christendom the \"service\"[224] of\r\nyoung girls to-day implies their sacrifice to the Moloch of man's\r\nunrestrained passions.\r\n\r\nAugustine, in his work, \"The City of God,\" taunts Rome with having\r\ncaused her own downfall. He speaks of her slaves, miserable men, put\r\nto labors only fit for the beasts of the field, degraded below them;\r\ntheir condition had brought Rome to its own destruction. If such\r\nwrongs contributed to the overthrow of Rome, what can we not predict\r\nof the Christian civilization which, in the twentieth century of its\r\nexistence, degrades its Christian women to labors fit only for the\r\nbeasts of the field; harnessing them with dogs to do the most menial\r\nlabors; which drags them below even this, holding their womanhood up\r\nto sale, putting both Church and State sanction upon their moral\r\ndeath; which, in some places, as in the city of Berlin, so far\r\nrecognizes the sale of women's bodies for the vilest purposes as part\r\nof the Christian religion, that license for this life is refused until\r\nthey have partaken of the Sacrament; and which demands of the \"10,000\r\nlicensed women of the town\" of the city of Hamburg, certificates\r\nshowing that they regularly attend church and also partake of the\r\nsacrament?\r\n\r\nA civilization which even there has not reached its lowest depths, but\r\nwhich has created in England, as a result of its highest Christian\r\ncivilization, a class of women under the protection of the State,\r\nknown as \"Queen's women,\" or \"Government women,\" with direct purpose\r\nof more fully protecting man in his departure from the moral law, and\r\nwhich makes woman the hopeless slave of man's lowest nature; a system\r\nnot confined to England, but already in practice in France, in Italy,\r\nin Switzerland, in Germany, and nearly every country in Europe. A\r\nsystem of morality which declares \"the necessity\" of woman's\r\ndegradation, and which annually sends its tens of thousands down to a\r\ndeath from which society grants no resurrection.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to the National Woman's Suffrage Convention, held at St.\r\nLouis, May, 1879, upon this condition of Licensed Vice, from Josephine\r\nE. Butler, Hon. Secretary of the Federation and the Ladies' National\r\nAssociation for the Protection of Women; a society which has its\r\nbranches over Europe, and has for years been actively at work against\r\nthis last most hideous form of slavery for women, Mrs. Butler says:\r\n\r\n     England holds a peculiar position in regard to the question. She\r\n     was the last to adopt this system of slavery, and she adopted it\r\n     in that thorough manner which characterizes the actions of the\r\n     Anglo-Saxon race. In no other country has prostitution been\r\n     regulated by law. It has been understood by the Latin races, even\r\n     when morally enervated, that the law could not without risk of\r\n     losing its majesty and force sanction illegality and violate\r\n     justice. In England alone the regulations are law.\r\n\r\n     This legalization of vice, which is the endorsement of the\r\n     \"necessity\" of impurity for man and the institution of the\r\n     slavery of woman, is the most open denial which modern times have\r\n     seen of the principle of the sacredness of the individual human\r\n     being. An English high-class journal dared to demand that women\r\n     who are unchaste shall henceforth be dealt with \"not as human\r\n     beings, but as foul sewers,\" or some such \"material nuisance\"\r\n     without souls, without rights, and without responsibility. When\r\n     the leaders of public opinion in a country have arrived at such a\r\n     point of combined skepticism and despotism as to recommend such a\r\n     manner of dealing with human beings, there is no crime which that\r\n     country may not presently legalize, there is no organization of\r\n     murder, no conspiracy of abominable things that it may not, and\r\n     in due time will not--have been found to embrace in its guilty\r\n     methods. Were it possible to secure the absolute physical health\r\n     of a whole province or an entire continent by the destruction of\r\n     one, only one poor and sinful woman, woe to that nation which\r\n     should dare, by that single act of destruction, to purchase this\r\n     advantage to the many! It will do it at its peril. God will take\r\n     account of the deed not in eternity only, but in time, it may be\r\n     in the next or even in the present generation.\r\n\r\nThe fact of governments lending their official aid to the\r\ndemoralization of woman by the registration system, shows an utter\r\ndebasement of law. This system is directly opposed to the fundamental\r\nprinciple of right, that of holding the accused innocent until proven\r\nguilty, which until now has been recognized as a part of modern law.\r\nUnder the registration or license system, all women within the radius\r\nof its action are under suspicion; all women are held as morally\r\nguilty until they prove themselves innocent. Where this law is in\r\nforce, all women are under an irresponsible police surveillance,\r\nliable to accusation, arrest, examination, imprisonment, and the\r\nentrance of their names upon the list of the lewd women of a town.\r\nUpon this frightful infraction of justice, we have the sentiments of\r\nSheldon Amos, Professor of Jurisprudence in the Law College of London\r\nUniversity. In \"The Science of Law,\" he says, in reference to this\r\nvery wrong:\r\n\r\n     The loss of liberty to the extent to which it exists, implies a\r\n     degradation of the State, and, if persisted in, can only lead to\r\n     its dissolution. No person or class of persons must be under the\r\n     cringing fear of having imputed to them offences of which they\r\n     are innocent, and of being taken into custody in consequence of\r\n     such imputation. They must not be liable to be detained in\r\n     custody without so much as a _prima facie_ case being made out,\r\n     such as in the opinion of a responsible judicial officer leaves a\r\n     presumption of guilt. They must not be liable to be detained for\r\n     an indefinite time without having the question of their guilt or\r\n     innocence investigated by the best attainable methods. When the\r\n     fact comes to be inquired into, the best attainable methods of\r\n     eliciting the truth must be used. In default of any one of these\r\n     securities, _public liberty_ must be said to be proportionately\r\n     at a very low ebb.\r\n\r\nGreat effort has been made to introduce this system into the United\r\nStates, and a National Board of Health, created by Congress in 1879,\r\nis carefully watched in its action, lest its irresponsible powers lead\r\nto its encroachment upon the liberties and personal rights of woman. A\r\nresolution adopted March 2, 1881, at a meeting of the New York\r\nCommittee appointed to thwart the effort to license vice in this\r\ncountry, shows the need of its watchful care.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That this committee has learned with much regret and\r\n     apprehension of the action of the American Public Health\r\n     Association, at its late annual meeting in New Orleans, in\r\n     adopting a sensational report commending European governmental\r\n     regulation of prostitution, and looking to the introduction in\r\n     this country, with modifications, through the medium of State\r\n     legislative enactments and municipal ordinances, of a kindred\r\n     immoral system of State-regulated social vice.\r\n\r\nFrom all these startling facts in Church and State we see that our\r\ngovernment and religion are alike essentially masculine in their\r\norigin and development. All the evils that have resulted from\r\ndignifying one sex and degrading the other may be traced to this\r\ncentral error: a belief in a trinity of masculine Gods in One, from\r\nwhich the feminine element is wholly eliminated.[225] And yet in the\r\nScriptural account of the simultaneous creation of man and woman, the\r\ntext plainly recognizes the feminine as well as the masculine element\r\nin the Godhead, and declares the equality of the sexes in goodness,\r\nwisdom, and power. Genesis i. 26, 27: \"And God said: let us make man\r\n_in our own, image, after our own likeness_.... So God created man in\r\nHis own image; in the image of God created He him; _male_ and _female_\r\ncreated He THEM.... And gave them dominion over the fish of the sea,\r\nand over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth\r\nupon the earth.\"\r\n\r\nWhile woman's subordination is taught as a Scriptural doctrine, the\r\nmost devout and learned biblical scholars of the present day admit\r\nthat the Bible has suffered many interpolations in the course of the\r\ncenturies. Some of these have doubtless occurred through efforts to\r\nrender certain passages clearer, while others have been forged with\r\ndirect intention to deceive. Disraeli says that the early English\r\neditions contain 6,000 errors, which were constantly introduced, and\r\npassages interpolated for sectarian purposes, or to sustain new\r\ncreeds. Sometimes, indeed, they were added for the purpose of\r\ndestroying all Scriptural authority by the suppression of texts. _The\r\nChurch Union_ says of the present translation, that there are more\r\nthan 7,000 variations from the received Hebrew text, and more than\r\n150,000 from the received Greek text.\r\n\r\nThese 7,000 variations in the Old Testament and 150,000 in the New\r\nTestament, are very significant facts. The oldest manuscripts of the\r\nNew Testament are the Alexandrine Codex, known since the commencement\r\nof the seventeenth century, and believed to date back to the middle of\r\nthe fifth century, the Sinaitic, and the Vatican Codices, each\r\nbelieved to have been executed about the middle of the fourth century.\r\nThe Sinaitic Codex was discovered by Professor Tischendorf, a German\r\nscholar, at a monastery upon Mt. Sinai, in fragments, and at different\r\nperiods from 1848 to 1859, a period of eleven years elapsing from his\r\ndiscovery of the first fragment until he secured the last one. The\r\nVatican Codex has been in the Vatican library since its foundation,\r\nbut it has been inaccessible to scholars until very recently. It is\r\nnot known from whence it came or by whom executed, but is deemed the\r\noldest and most authentic copy of the Bible extant. As these oldest\r\ncodices only date to the middle of the fourth century, we have no\r\nrecord of the New Testament, in its present form, for the first three\r\nhundred and fifty years of this era.\r\n\r\nA commission of eminent scholars has been engaged for the past eleven\r\nyears upon a revision of the Bible. The New Testament portion is now\r\nabout ready for the public, but so great and so many are its\r\ndiversities from the old version, that it is prophesied the orthodox\r\nchurch will be torn by disputes between adherents of the old and the\r\nnew, while those anxious for the truth, touch where it may, will be\r\nhonestly in doubt if either one is to be implicitly trusted. Various\r\ncomments and inquiries in regard to this revision have already\r\nappeared in the press.[226] The oldest codices do not contain many\r\ntexts we have learned to look upon as especially holy. Portions of the\r\nSermon on the Mount are not in these old manuscripts, a proof of their\r\ninterpolation to serve the purpose of some one at a later date. In the\r\nsame way additions have been made to the Lord's Prayer. Neither of\r\nthese manuscripts contain the story of the woman taken in adultery, as\r\nnarrated John viii. 1-11, so often quoted as proof of the divine mercy\r\nof Jesus. A letter upon this so long accepted story, from the eminent\r\nscholar, Howard Crosby, D.D., LL.D., a member of the revisory\r\ncommission, will be read with interest:\r\n\r\n     MRS. M. J. GAGE:\r\n\r\n     DEAR MADAME:--The passage in John viii. 1-11, is _not_ in the\r\n     Alexandrian, nor is it in the Sinaitic, Vatican, and Ephraim\r\n     Codices. It is found in twelve uncials (though marked _doubtful_\r\n     in five of these) and in over 300 cursives.\r\n\r\n                                   Yours very truly,\r\n                                                    HOWARD CROSBY.\r\n\r\n     116 East 19th, N. Y., _March 14, '81_.\r\n\r\nThe world still asks, What is Truth? A work has recently been\r\npublished entitled, \"The Christian Religion to A.D. 200.\" It is the\r\nfruit of several-years' study of a period upon which the Church has\r\nbut little record. It finds no evidence of the existence of the New\r\nTestament in its present form during that time; neither does it find\r\nevidence that the Gospels in their present form date from the lives of\r\ntheir professed authors. All Biblical scholars acknowledge that the\r\nworld possesses no record or tradition of the original manuscripts of\r\nthe New Testament, and that to attempt to reestablish the old text is\r\nhopeless. No reference by writers to any part of the New Testament as\r\nauthoritative is found earlier than the third century (A.D. 202). The\r\nfirst collection, or canon, of the New Testament was prepared by the\r\nSynod or Council of Laodicea in the fourth century (A.D. 360). It\r\nentirely omitted the Book of Revelation from the list of sacred works.\r\nThis book has met a similar fate from many sources, not being printed\r\nin the Syriac Testament as late as 1562.\r\n\r\nAmid this vast discrepancy in regard to the truth of the Scriptures\r\nthemselves; with no Hebrew manuscript older than the twelfth century;\r\nwith no Greek one older than the fourth; with the acknowledgment by\r\nscholars of 7,000 errors in the Old Testament, and 150,000 in the New;\r\nwith assurance that these interpolations and changes have been made by\r\nmen in the interest of creeds, we may well believe that the portions\r\nof the Bible quoted against woman's equality are but interpolations of\r\nan unscrupulous priesthood, for the purpose of holding her in\r\nsubjection to man.\r\n\r\nAmid this conflict of authority over texts of Scripture we have been\r\ntaught to believe divinely inspired, destroying our faith in doctrines\r\nheretofore declared essential to salvation, how can we be sure that\r\nthe forthcoming version of the Bible from the masculine revisers of\r\nour day will be more trustworthy than those which have been accepted\r\nas of Divine origin in the past?\r\n\r\n     This chapter is condensed from the writer's forthcoming work,\r\n     \"WOMAN, CHURCH, AND STATE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[178] Maine (Gaius) says of the position of woman under Roman law\r\nbefore the introduction of Christianity: \"The juriconsulists had\r\nevidently at this time assumed the equality of the sexes as a\r\nprinciple of the code of equity. The situation of the Roman woman,\r\nwhether married or single, became one of great personal and property\r\nindependence ... but Christianity tended somewhat, from the very\r\nfirst, to narrow this remarkable liberty. The prevailing state of\r\nreligious sentiment may explain why modern jurisprudence has adopted\r\nthese rules concerning the position of woman which belong peculiarly\r\nto an imperfect civilization.... No society which preserves any\r\ntincture of Christian institutions, is likely to restore to married\r\nwomen the personal liberty conferred on them by middle Roman law.\r\nCanon law has deeply injured civilization.\"\r\n\r\n[179] Canon law is the whole body of Church decrees enacted by\r\ncouncils, bulls, decretals, etc., and is recognized as a system of\r\nlaws primarily established by the Christian Church, and enforced by\r\necclesiastical authority. It took cognizance first merely of what were\r\nconsidered spiritual duties, but ultimately extended itself to\r\ntemporal rights. It was collected and embodied in the ninth century,\r\nsince which period numerous additions have been made.\r\n\r\n[180] The women claimed the right to baptize their own sex. But the\r\nbishops and presbyters did not care to be released from the pleasant\r\nduty of baptizing the female converts.--_Hist. of Christian Religion\r\nfrom A.D. to 200_, _p. 23, Waite_. The Constitution of the Church of\r\nAlexandria, which is thought to have been established about the year\r\n200, required the applicant for baptism to be divested of clothing,\r\nand after the ordinance had been administered, to be anointed with\r\noil.--_Ibid._, _p. 384-5_. The converts were first exorcised of the\r\nevil spirits that were supposed to inhabit them; then, after\r\nundressing and being baptized, they were anointed with oil.--_Bunsen's\r\nChristianity of Mankind_, _Vol. VII._, _p. 386-393_; _3d Vol.\r\nAnalecta_.\r\n\r\n[181] All, or at least the greater part of the fathers of the Greek\r\nChurch before Augustine, denied any real, original sin.--\"Augustinism\r\nand Pelagianism,\" p. 43, Emerson's Translations (Waite).

I\r\nmarry, therefore, because I wish to get out of the Ultramontane\r\nslough.\"--_Galignani's Messenger_, _September 19, 1874_.\r\n\r\n[185] The abbot elect of St. Augustine, at Canterbury, in 1171 was\r\nfound, on investigation, to have seventeen illegitimate children in a\r\nsingle village.

This work was\r\nprinted in 18mo, an unusually small size for that period, for the\r\nconvenience of carrying it in the pocket, where its assertions, they\r\ncould not be called arguments, could be always within reach,\r\nespecially for those traveling witch inquisitors, who proceeded from\r\ncountry to country, like Sprenger himself, to denounce witches. This\r\nwork bore the sanction of the Pope, and was followed, even in\r\nProtestant countries, until the eighteenth century. It based its\r\ntheories upon the Bible, and devoted thirty-three pages to a proof\r\nthat women were especially addicted to sorcery.\r\n\r\n[195] It was observed they (devils) had a peculiar attachment to women\r\nwith beautiful hair, and it was an old Catholic belief that St. Paul\r\nalluded to this in that somewhat obscure passage in which he exhorts\r\nwomen to cover their heads because of the angels.--SPRANGLER.\r\n\r\n[196] One of the most powerful incentives to confession was\r\nsystematically to deprive the suspected witch of her natural sleep....\r\nIron collars, or witches' bridles, are still preserved in various\r\nparts of Scotland, which had been used for such iniquitous purposes.\r\nThese instruments were so constructed that by means of a loop which\r\npassed over the head, a piece of iron having four points or prongs,\r\nwas forcibly thrust into the mouth, two of these being directed to the\r\ntongue and palate, the others pointing outward to each cheek. This\r\ninfernal machine was secured by a padlock. At the back of the collar\r\nwas fixed a ring, by which to attach the witch to a staple in the wall\r\nof her cell. Thus equipped, and day and night waked and watched by\r\nsome skillful person appointed by her inquisitors, the unhappy\r\ncreature, after a few days of such discipline, maddened by the misery\r\nof her forlorn and helpless state, would be rendered fit for\r\nconfessing anything, in order to be rid of the dregs of her wretched\r\nlife. At intervals fresh examinations took place, and they were\r\nrepeated from time to time until her \"_contumacy_,\" as it was termed,\r\nwas subdued.

To\r\nspare the innocent child, the equally innocent mother confessed she\r\nwas a witch. After enduring all the agonies applied to herself, and\r\nall she was made to bear in the persons of her innocent family, she\r\nwas still made to undergo the frightful suffering of death at the\r\nstake.

He then got into the cart in company with a friend, and\r\ndrove the ill-assorted team some sixteen versts (nearly eleven English\r\nmiles), without sparing the whip-cord. When he returned from his\r\nexcursion he shaved the unlucky woman's head, tarred and feathered\r\nher, and turned her out of doors. She naturally sought refuge and\r\nconsolation from her parish priest; but he sent her back to her lord\r\nand master, prescribing further flagellation. An appeal to justice by\r\nthe poor woman and her relatives resulted in a non-suit, and any\r\nrecourse to a higher court will probably terminate in the same manner.\r\n\r\nWOMAN'S LOT IN RUSSIA.--Here and there the popular songs hear traces\r\nof the griefs which in the rough furrows of daily life the Russian\r\nwoman finds it prudent to conceal. \"Ages have rolled away,\" says the\r\npoet Nekrasof; \"the whole face of the earth has brightened; only the\r\nsombre lot of mowjik's wife God forgets to change.\" And the same poet\r\nmakes one of his village heroines say, _apropos_ of the\r\nenfranchisement of the serfs, \"God has forgotten the nook where He hid\r\nthe keys of woman's emancipation.\"\r\n\r\n[206] One of the powerful German Electors, who formerly made choice of\r\nthe Emperor of Germany.\r\n\r\n[207] Even as late as the sixteenth century a plurality of wives was\r\nallowed in some of the Christian countries of Europe, and the German\r\nreformers were inclined to permit bigamy as not inconsistent with the\r\nprinciples of the Gospel.--\"_Woman in all Countries and Nations_,\"\r\nNichols.\r\n\r\n[208] See report of the Seney trial in Ohio, 1879, in which the judge\r\ndecided against the prosecuting wife, upon the ground of her lack of\r\nthe same ownership over the husband that the husband possessed over\r\nthe wife.\r\n\r\n[209] The Birchall case.\r\n\r\n[210] \"History,\" says Voltaire, \"is only a parcel of tricks we play\r\nwith the dead.\"\r\n\r\n[211] JOHN MILTON AND HIS DAUGHTERS.--Milton's Oriental views of the\r\nfunction of women led him not only to neglect, but to positively\r\nprevent the education of his daughters. They were sent to no school at\r\nall, but were handed over to a schoolmistress in the house. He would\r\nnot allow them to learn any language, saying, with a sneer, that \"for\r\na woman one tongue was enough.\" The Nemesis, however, that follows\r\nselfish sacrifice of others is so sure of stroke that there needs no\r\nfuture world of punishment to adjust the balance. The time came when\r\nMilton would have given worlds that his daughters had learned the\r\ntongues. He was blind, and could only get at his precious book--could\r\nonly give expression to his precious verses--through the eyes and\r\nhands of others. Whose hands and whose eyes so proper for this as his\r\ndaughters? He proceeded to train them to read to him, parrot-like, in\r\nfive or six languages, which he (the schoolmaster) could at one time\r\nhave easily taught them; but of which they could not now understand a\r\nword. He turned his daughters into reading-machines. It is appalling\r\nto think of such a task. That Mary should revolt, and at last, after\r\nrepeated contests with her taskmaster, learn to hate her father--that\r\nshe should, when some one spoke in her presence of her father's\r\napproaching marriage, make the dreadful speech that \"it was no news to\r\nhear of his wedding, but if she could hear of his death, that were\r\nsomething\"--is unutterably painful, but not surprising.--_The\r\nAthenæum_.\r\n\r\n[212] Mrs. Robinson, of Indiana, and Mrs. E. S. Whitney, of New York.\r\n\r\n[213] While in the midst of correcting proof, March 22d, the New York\r\npress comes with an article showing how generally women are rousing to\r\ntheir rights. It is headed:\r\n\r\n\"WOMEN AT THE CHURCH POLL--_What Came of Reviving an Old Statute in\r\nPortchester_.--The trustees of the Presbyterian Church in Portchester,\r\nalthough elected on the 24th of February last, did not organize until\r\nabout ten days ago. The reason for this delay lies in the claim made\r\nby some of the congregation that the election was irregular, owing to\r\nwomen having been allowed to vote. Some of the trustees who held over\r\nwere at first inclined to resign, and the matter has been much\r\ndiscussed. When opposition was made to women voting, H. T. Smith\r\nproduced the statute of 1818, which says that any member of the church\r\nat full age shall have a right to vote for trustees. There is nothing\r\nin the act prohibiting women from voting. There are, I believe,\r\nstatutes forbidding women to vote in the Dutch Reformed and Episcopal\r\nChurches; but this is a regular Presbyterian Church. It seems to me\r\nthat the women have worked hard for this church, and that they ought\r\nto have a vote at the election of trustees and other officers. A Sun\r\nreporter called upon the ladies for their version of the troubles.\r\nMiss Pink, who is a school teacher, said: 'We women do four-fifths of\r\nthe work, and contribute more than one-half the money to support the\r\nchurch. Two years ago we were allowed to vote for a minister, and we\r\ndon't see why we shouldn't vote for trustees and at other elections.'\r\nMiss Camp gave similar reasons for voting. Mrs. Montgomery Lyon said:\r\n'If the old trustees didn't know that we had a right to vote, it isn't\r\nour fault. We women do all the work, and why shouldn't we vote!' Women\r\nwill vote for President, soon.\"\r\n\r\n[214] The above is article xiv. of the by-laws of the society\r\nconnected with the aforesaid church. Thus the society undertakes to\r\ndictate to the church who shall have a voice in the selection of a\r\npastor. It is a matter of gratitude that the society, if it forbids\r\nfemales to vote in the church, yet allows them to pray and to help the\r\nsociety raise money.--_Independent_, _N. Y._, _Feb. 24, 1881_.\r\n\r\n[215] BROKEN DOWN.--Mrs. Van Cott, the woman evangelist, has retired\r\nfrom the field, probably forever. Her nervous system is broken down.\r\nDuring the fourteen years of her ministry she has traveled 143,417\r\nmiles, has preached 4,294 sermons, besides conducting 9,333 other\r\nreligious meetings, and writing 9,853 letters.--_Ex_.\r\n\r\n[216] But this Conference, which could not recognize woman's equality\r\nof rights in the Church, adjourned in a body to Chicago, before its\r\nbusiness was completed, by its presence there to influence the\r\nRepublican Nominating Convention in favor of General Grant's name for\r\nthe Presidency.\r\n\r\n[217] A professor of theology said a while ago, how sorry he should be\r\nto have the law recognize that one-half of the income of the family\r\nbelonged to his wife, \"it would establish such a mine-and-thine\r\nrelation.\" It evidently seemed to him, somehow, more harmonious, less\r\nof the earth, earthy, that he could say, \"All mine, my love,\" and that\r\nshe could sweetly respond, \"All thine, dearest.\"--_State\r\nProhibitionist_, _Des Moines, Ia._, _Jan. 28, 1881_.\r\n\r\n[218] The great botanist, Linnæus, was persecuted when he first\r\npresented his sexual system in vegetation to the world.\r\n\r\n[219] The legal subordination of one sex to another is wrong in\r\nitself, and now one of the chief hindrances to human improvement; it\r\nought to be replaced by a principle of perfect equality, admitting no\r\npowers or privileges on the one side or disability on the\r\nother.--_Subjection of Woman, John Stuart Mill_.\r\n\r\n[220] The _Worcester Chronicle_ of recent date gives an account of a\r\nwife sale in England. Thomas Middleton delivered up his wife Mary M.\r\nto Philip Rostius, and sold her for one shilling and a quart of ale,\r\nand parted from her solely and absolutely for life, \"not to trouble\r\none another for life.\" Philip Rostius made his mark as a witness. A\r\nsecond witness was S. H. Shore, Crown Inn, Trim street.\r\n\r\n[221] In the peace made by the Sabines with the Romans, after the\r\nforcible abduction of the Sabine maidens, one of the provisions was\r\nthat no labor, except spinning, should be required of these Roman\r\nwives.\r\n\r\n[222] THE FAIR SEX IN THE ALPS.--The farmers In the Upper Alps, though\r\nby no means wealthy, live like lords in their houses, while the\r\nheaviest portion of agricultural labors devolves on the wife. It is no\r\nuncommon thing to see a woman yoked to the plough with an ass, while\r\nher husband guides it. An Alpine farmer accounts it an act of\r\npoliteness to lend his wife to a neighbor who has too much work, and\r\nthe neighbor in return lends his wife for a few days' labor whenever\r\nrequested.\r\n\r\n[223] Lord Shaftesbury bringing the subject before Parliament.\r\n\r\n[224] A STORY OF IRELAND IN 1880.--Recently, a young girl named\r\nCatherine Cafferby, of Belmullet, in County Mayo--the pink of her\r\nfather's family--fled from the \"domestic service\" of a landlord as\r\nabsolute as Lord Leitrim, the moment the poor creature discovered what\r\nthat \"service\" customarily involved. The great man had the audacity to\r\ninvoke the law to compel her to return, as she had not given\r\nstatutable notice of her flight. She clung to the door-post of her\r\nfather's cabin; she told aloud the story of her terror, and called on\r\nGod and man to save her. Her tears, her shrieks, her piteous pleadings\r\nwere all in vain. The Petty Sessions Bench ordered her back to the\r\nlandlord's \"service,\" or else to pay £5, or two weeks in jail. This is\r\nnot a story of Bulgaria under Murad IV., but of Ireland in the reign\r\nof the present sovereign. That peasant girl went to jail to save her\r\nchastity. If she did not spend a fortnight in the cells, it was only\r\nbecause friends of outraged virtue, justice, and humanity paid the\r\nfine when the story reached the outer world.\r\n\r\n[225] The son of the late William Ellery Channing, in a recent letter\r\nto a friend on this point, says: \"Religions like the Jewish and\r\nChristian, which make God exclusively _male_, consign woman logically\r\nto the subordinate position which is definitely assigned to her in\r\nMahometanism. History has kept this tradition. The subjection of woman\r\nhas existed as an invariable element in Christian civilization. It\r\ncould not be otherwise. If God and Christ were both represented as\r\nmale (and the Holy Ghost, too, in the pictures of the old masters), it\r\nstood to reason and appealed to fanaticism that the male form was the\r\nGodlike. Hence, logically, intellect and physical force were exalted\r\nabove the intuition of conscience and attractive charm. The male\r\nreligion shaped government and society after its own form. Theodore\r\nParker habitually addressed God as our Father and Mother. What we call\r\nGod is the infinite ideal of humanity. The preposterous, ridiculous\r\nabsurdity of supposing God so defined to be of the male sex, and to\r\ncall God 'him,' does not need a word to make it apparent. This ideal\r\nwhich we all reverence, and for which we yearn, necessarily enfolds in\r\n_One_ the attributes which, separated in our human race, express\r\nthemselves in Manhood and Womanhood.\"\r\n\r\n[226] Some person, over the signature of \"A Bible Reader,\" writing in\r\nthe _Sun_ of March 16, says: \"I would be sincerely glad to know what\r\nguarantee we have that ere long we shall not have another revision of\r\nScripture? It is not so long ago since the discovery of Tischendorf of\r\nan important manuscript of the New Testament, which gave a number of\r\nnew readings. There may be in existence other and older manuscripts of\r\nthe Bible than any we now have, from which may be omitted the\r\nnarratives of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection. Should we then\r\nhave to give these up? If the revisers act consistently they would\r\ncertainly have to do so.\r\n\r\n\"It appears that already the Calvinists and the Trinitarians have been\r\ndeprived by the revisers of the texts they relied upon to uphold their\r\npeculiar doctrines. It remains to be seen how the Universalists,\r\nBaptists, and other Christian sects will fare.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPRECEDING CAUSES.\r\n\r\nMARGARET FULLER possessed more influence upon the thought of America,\r\nthan any woman previous to her time. Men of diverse interests and\r\nhabits of thought, alike recognized her power and acknowledged the\r\nquickening influence of her mind upon their own. Ralph Waldo Emerson\r\nsaid of her: \"The day was never long enough to exhaust her opulent\r\nmemory; and I, who knew her intimately for ten years, never saw her\r\nwithout surprise at her new powers.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam R. Channing, in her \"Memoirs,\" says: \"I have no hope of\r\nconveying to my readers my sense of the beauty of our relation, as it\r\nlies in the past, with brightness falling on it from Margaret's risen\r\nspirit. It would be like printing a chapter of autobiography, to\r\ndescribe what is so grateful in memory--its influence upon oneself.\"\r\n\r\nRev. James Freeman Clarke says: \"Socrates without his scholars, would\r\nbe more complete than Margaret without her friends. The insight which\r\nMargaret displayed in finding her friends; the magnetism by which she\r\ndrew them toward herself; the catholic range of her intimacies; the\r\ninfluence which she exerted to develop the latent germ of every\r\ncharacter; the constancy with which she clung to each when she had\r\nonce given and received confidence; the delicate justice which kept\r\nevery intimacy separate, and the process of transfiguration which took\r\nplace when she met any one on this mountain of friendship, giving a\r\ndazzling lustre to the details of common life--all these should be at\r\nleast touched upon and illustrated, to give any adequate view of these\r\nrelations.\" Horace Greeley, in his \"Recollections of a Busy Life,\"\r\nsaid: \"When I first made her acquaintance she was mentally the best\r\ninstructed woman in America.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Transcendentalism rose in New England, drawing the brightest\r\nminds of the country into its faith, Margaret was accepted as its\r\nhigh-priestess; and when _The Dial_ was established for the expression\r\nof those views, she was chosen its editor, aided by Ralph Waldo\r\nEmerson and George Ripley. Nothing could be more significant of the\r\nplace Margaret Fuller held in the realm of thought than the fact, that\r\nin this editorship she was given precedence over the eminent\r\nphilosopher and eminent scholar, her associates.\r\n\r\nShe sought to unveil the mysteries of life and enfranchise her own sex\r\nfrom the bondage of the past, and while still under thirty planned a\r\nseries of conversations (in Boston) for women only, wherein she took a\r\nleading part. The general object of these conferences, as declared in\r\nher programme, was to supply answers to these questions: \"What are we\r\nborn to do?\" and \"How shall we do it?\" or, as has been stated, \"Her\r\nthree special aims in those conversations were, To pass in review the\r\ndepartments of thought and knowledge, and endeavor to place them in\r\none relation to one another in our minds. To systematize thought and\r\ngive a precision and clearness in which our sex are so deficient,\r\nchiefly, I think, because they have so few inducements to test and\r\nclassify what they receive. To ascertain what pursuits are best suited\r\nto us, in our time and state of society, and how we may make the best\r\nuse of our means of building up the life of thought upon the life of\r\naction.\"\r\n\r\nThese conversations continued for several successive winters, and were\r\nin reality a vindication of woman's right to think. In calling forth\r\nthe opinions of her sex upon Life, Literature, Mythology, Art,\r\nCulture, and Religion, Miss Fuller was the precursor of the Woman's\r\nRights agitation of the last thirty-three years. Her work, \"The Great\r\nLawsuit; or, Man _vs._ Woman, Woman _vs._ Man,\" was declared by Horace\r\nGreeley to be the loftiest and most commanding assertion made of the\r\nright of woman to be regarded and treated as an independent,\r\nintelligent, rational being, entitled to an equal voice in framing and\r\nmodifying the laws she is required to obey, and in controlling and\r\ndisposing of the property she has inherited or aided to acquire. In\r\nthis work Margaret said: \"It is the fault of MARRIAGE and of the\r\npresent relation between the sexes, that the woman _belongs_ to the\r\nman, instead of forming a whole with him.... Woman, self-centered,\r\nwould never be absorbed by any relation; it would only be an\r\nexperience to her, as to Man. It is a vulgar error that love--_a_\r\nlove--is to Woman her whole existence; she is also born for Truth and\r\nLove in their universal energy. Would she but assume her inheritance,\r\nMary would not be the only virgin mother.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret Fuller was the first woman upon the staff of _The New York\r\nTribune_, a position she took in 1844, when she was but thirty-four.\r\nMrs. Greeley having made Margaret's acquaintance, attended her\r\nconversations and accepted her leading ideas, planned to have her\r\nbecome a member of the Greeley family, and a writer for _The Tribune_;\r\na position was therefore offered her by Mr. Greeley upon his wife's\r\njudgment. It required but a short time, however, for the great editor\r\nto feel her power, although he failed to fully comprehend her\r\ngreatness. It has been declared not the least of Horace Greeley's\r\nservices to the nation, that he was willing to entrust the literary\r\ncriticisms of _The Tribune_ to one whose standard of culture was so\r\nfar above that of his readers or his own.\r\n\r\nMargaret Fuller opened the way for many women, who upon the editorial\r\nstaff of the great New York dailies, as literary critics and as\r\nreporters, have helped impress woman's thought upon the American mind.\r\n\r\nTheodore Parker, who knew her well, characterized her as a critic,\r\nrather than a creator or seer. But whether we look upon her as critic,\r\ncreator, or seer, she was thoroughly a woman. One of her friends wrote\r\nof her, \"She was the largest woman, and not a woman who wanted to be a\r\nman.\" Woman everywhere, to-day, is a critic. Enthralled as she has\r\nbeen for ages, by both religious and political despotism, no sooner\r\ndoes she rouse to thought than she necessarily begins criticism. The\r\nhoary wrongs of the past still fall with heavy weight upon\r\nwoman--their curse still exists. Before building society anew, she\r\nseeks to destroy the errors and injustice of the past, hence we find\r\nwomen critics in every department of thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK.\r\n\r\n_Seneca Falls and Rochester Conventions._\r\n\r\nWOMEN OUT OF THEIR LATITUDE.\r\n\r\nWe are sorry to see that the women in several parts of this State are\r\nholding what they call \"Woman's Rights Conventions,\" and setting forth\r\na formidable list of those Rights in a parody upon the Declaration of\r\nAmerican Independence.\r\n\r\nThe papers of the day contain extended notices of these Conventions.\r\nSome of them fall in with their objects and praise the meetings\r\nhighly; but the majority either deprecate or ridicule both.\r\n\r\nThe women who attend these meetings, no doubt at the expense of their\r\nmore appropriate duties, act as committees, write resolutions and\r\naddresses, hold much correspondence, make speeches, etc., etc. They\r\naffirm, as among their rights, that of unrestricted franchise, and\r\nassert that it is wrong to deprive them of the privilege to become\r\nlegislators, lawyers, doctors, divines, etc., etc.; and they are\r\nholding Conventions and making an agitatory movement, with the object\r\nin view of revolutionizing public opinion and the laws of the land,\r\nand changing their relative position in society in such a way as to\r\ndivide with the male sex the labors and responsibilities of active\r\nlife in every branch of art, science, trades, and professions.\r\n\r\nNow, it requires no argument to prove that this is all wrong. Every\r\ntrue hearted female will instantly feel that this is unwomanly, and\r\nthat to be practically carried out, the males must change their\r\nposition in society to the same extent in an opposite direction, in\r\norder to enable them to discharge an equal share of the domestic\r\nduties which now appertain to females, and which must be neglected, to\r\na great extent, if women are allowed to exercise all the \"rights\" that\r\nare claimed by these Convention-holders. Society would have to be\r\nradically remodelled in order to accommodate itself to so great a\r\nchange in the most vital part of the compact of the social relations\r\nof life; and the order of things established at the creation of\r\nmankind, and continued _six thousand years_, would be completely\r\nbroken up. The organic laws of our country, and of each State, would\r\nhave to be licked into new shapes, in order to admit of the\r\nintroduction of the vast change that it contemplated. In a thousand\r\nother ways that might be mentioned, if we had room to make, and our\r\nreaders had patience to hear them, would this sweeping reform be\r\nattended by fundamental changes in the public and private, civil and\r\nreligious, moral and social relations of the sexes, of life, and of\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nBut this change is impracticable, uncalled for, and unnecessary. _If\r\neffected_, it would set the world by the ears, make \"confusion worse\r\nconfounded,\" demoralize and degrade from their high sphere and noble\r\ndestiny, women of all respectable and useful classes, and prove a\r\nmonstrous injury to all mankind. It would be productive of no positive\r\ngood, that would not be outweighed tenfold by positive evil. It would\r\nalter the relations of females without bettering their condition.\r\nBesides all, and above all, it presents no remedy for the _real_ evils\r\nthat the millions of the industrious, hard-working, and much suffering\r\nwomen of our country groan under and seek to redress.--_Mechanic's_\r\n(Albany, N. Y.) _Advocate_.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSURRECTION AMONG THE WOMEN.\r\n\r\nA female Convention has just been held at Seneca Falls, N. Y., at\r\nwhich was adopted a \"declaration of rights,\" setting forth, among\r\nother things, that \"all men and _women_ are created equal, and endowed\r\nby their Creator with certain inalienable rights.\" The list of\r\ngrievances which the _Amazons_ exhibit, concludes by expressing a\r\ndetermination to insist that woman shall have \"immediate admission to\r\nall the rights and privileges which belong to them as citizens of the\r\nUnited States.\" It is stated that they design, in spite of all\r\nmisrepresentations and ridicule, to employ agents, circulate tracts,\r\npetition the State and National Legislatures, and endeavor to enlist\r\nthe pulpit and the press in their behalf. This is _bolting_ with a\r\nvengeance.--_Worcester_ (Mass.) _Telegraph_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF PETTICOATS.\r\n\r\nThe women in various parts of the State have taken the field in favor\r\nof a petticoat empire, with a zeal and energy which show that their\r\nhearts are in the cause, and that they are resolved no longer to\r\nsubmit to the tyrannical rule of the _heartless_ \"lords of creation,\"\r\nbut have solemnly determined to demand their \"natural and inalienable\r\nright\" to attend the polls, and assist in electing our Presidents, and\r\nGovernors, and Members of Congress, and State Representatives, and\r\nSheriffs, and County Clerks, and Supervisors, and Constables, etc.,\r\netc., and to unite in the general scramble for office. This is right\r\nand proper. It is but just that they should participate in the\r\nbeautiful and feminine business of politics, and enjoy their\r\nproportion of the \"spoils of victory.\" Nature never designed that they\r\nshould be confined exclusively to the drudgery of raising children,\r\nand superintending the kitchens, and to the performance of the various\r\nother household duties which the cruelty of men and the customs of\r\nsociety have so long assigned to them. This is emphatically the age of\r\n\"democratic progression,\" of _equality_ and _fraternization_--the age\r\nwhen all colors and sexes, the bond and free, black and white, male\r\nand female, are, as they by right ought to be, all tending downward\r\nand upward toward the common level of equality.\r\n\r\nThe harmony of this great movement in the cause of freedom would not\r\nbe perfect if women were still to be confined to petticoats, and men\r\nto breeches. There must be an \"interchange\" of these \"commodities\" to\r\ncomplete the system. Why should it not be so? Can not women fill an\r\noffice, or cast a vote, or conduct a campaign, as judiciously and\r\nvigorously as men? And, on the other hand, can not men \"nurse\" the\r\nbabies, or preside at the wash-tub, or boil a pot as safely and as\r\nwell as women? If they can not, the evil is in that arbitrary\r\norganization of society which has excluded them from the practice of\r\nthese pursuits. It is time these false notions and practices were\r\nchanged, or, rather, removed, and for the political millennium\r\nforeshadowed by this petticoat movement to be ushered in. Let the\r\nwomen keep the ball moving, so bravely started by those who have\r\nbecome tired of the restraints imposed upon them by the antediluvian\r\nnotions of a Paul or the tyranny of man.--_Rochester_ (N.

The women folks have just held a\r\nConvention up in New York State, and passed a sort of \"bill of\r\nrights,\" affirming it their right to vote, to become teachers,\r\nlegislators, lawyers, divines, and do all and sundries the \"lords\"\r\nmay, and of right now do. They should have resolved at the same time,\r\nthat it was obligatory also upon the \"lords\" aforesaid, to wash\r\ndishes, scour up, be put to the tub, handle the broom, darn stockings,\r\npatch breeches, scold the servants, dress in the latest fashion, wear\r\ntrinkets, look beautiful, and be as fascinating as those blessed\r\nmorsels of humanity whom God gave to preserve that rough animal man,\r\nin something like a reasonable civilization. \"Progress!\" Progress,\r\nforever!--_Lowell_ (Mass.) _Courier_.\r\n\r\nTo us they appear extremely dull and uninteresting, and, aside from\r\ntheir novelty, hardly worth notice.--_Rochester Advertiser_.\r\n\r\nThis has been a remarkable Convention. It was composed of those\r\nholding to some one of the various _isms_ of the day, and some, we\r\nshould think, who embraced them all. The only practical good\r\nproposed--the adoption of measures for the relief and amelioration of\r\nthe condition of indigent, industrious, laboring females--was almost\r\nscouted by the leading ones composing the meeting. The great effort\r\nseemed to be to bring out some new, impracticable, absurd, and\r\nridiculous proposition, and the greater its absurdity the better. In\r\nshort, it was a regular _emeute_ of a congregation of females gathered\r\nfrom various quarters, who seem to be really in earnest in their aim\r\nat revolution, and who evince entire confidence that \"the day of\r\ntheir deliverance is at hand.\" Verily, this is a progressive\r\nera!--_Rochester Democrat_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMEN OF PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\nOur Philadelphia ladies not only possess beauty, but they are\r\ncelebrated for discretion, modesty, and unfeigned diffidence, as well\r\nas wit, vivacity, and good nature. Whoever heard of a Philadelphia\r\nlady setting up for a reformer, or standing out for woman's rights, or\r\nassisting to man the election grounds, raise a regiment, command a\r\nlegion, or address a jury? Our ladies glow with a higher ambition.\r\nThey soar to rule the hearts of their worshipers, and secure obedience\r\nby the sceptre of affection. The tenure of their power is a law of\r\nnature, not a law of man, and hence they fear no insurrection, and\r\nnever experience the shock of a revolution in their dominions. But all\r\nwomen are not as reasonable as ours of Philadelphia. The Boston ladies\r\ncontend for the rights of women. The New York girls aspire to mount\r\nthe rostrum, to do all the voting, and, we suppose, all the fighting\r\ntoo.... Our Philadelphia girls object to fighting and holding office.\r\nThey prefer the baby-jumper to the study of Coke and Lyttleton, and\r\nthe ball-room to the Palo Alto battle. They object to having a George\r\nSand for President of the United States; a Corinna for Governor; a\r\nFanny Wright for Mayor; or a Mrs. Partington for Postmaster.... Women\r\nhave enough influence over human affairs without being politicians.\r\n\r\nIs not everything managed by female influence? Mothers, grandmothers,\r\naunts, and sweethearts manage everything. Men have nothing to do but\r\nto listen and obey to the \"of course, my dear, you will, and of\r\ncourse, my dear, you won't.\" Their rule is absolute; their power\r\nunbounded. Under such a system men have no claim to rights, especially\r\n\"equal rights.\"\r\n\r\nA woman is nobody. A wife is everything. A pretty girl is equal to ten\r\nthousand men, and a mother is, next to God, all powerful.... The\r\nladies of Philadelphia, therefore, under the influence of the most\r\nserious \"sober second thoughts,\" are resolved to maintain their rights\r\nas Wives, Belles, Virgins, and Mothers, and not as Women.\"--_Public\r\nLedger and Daily Transcript_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nThis is the age of revolutions. To whatever part of the world the\r\nattention is directed, the political and social fabric is crumbling to\r\npieces; and changes which far exceed the wildest dreams of the\r\nenthusiastic Utopians of the last generation, are now pursued with\r\nardor and perseverance. The principal agent, however, that has\r\nhitherto taken part in these movements has been the rougher sex. It\r\nwas by man the flame of liberty, now burning with such fury on the\r\ncontinent of Europe, was first kindled; and though it is asserted that\r\nno inconsiderable assistance was contributed by the gentler sex to the\r\nlate sanguinary carnage at Paris, we are disposed to believe that such\r\na revolting imputation proceeds from base calumniators, and is a libel\r\nupon woman.\r\n\r\nBy the intelligence, however, which we have lately received, the work\r\nof revolution is no longer confined to the Old World, nor to the\r\nmasculine gender. The flag of independence has been hoisted, for the\r\nsecond time, on this side of the Atlantic; and a solemn league and\r\ncovenant has just been entered into by a Convention of women at Seneca\r\nFalls, to \"throw off the despotism under which they are groaning, and\r\nprovide new guards for their future security.\" Little did we expect\r\nthis new element to be thrown into the cauldron of agitation which is\r\nnow bubbling around us with such fury. We have had one Baltimore\r\nConvention, one Philadelphia Convention, one Utica Convention, and we\r\nshall also have, in a few days, the Buffalo Convention. But we never\r\ndreamed that Lucretia Mott had convened a fifth Convention, which, if\r\nit be ratified by those whom it purposes to represent, will exercise\r\nan influence that will not only control our own Presidential\r\nelections, but the whole governmental system throughout the world....\r\nThe declaration is a most interesting document. We published it in\r\n_extenso_ the other day. The amusing part is the preamble, where they\r\nassert their equality, and that they have certain inalienable rights,\r\nto secure which governments, deriving their just powers from the\r\nconsent of the governed, are instituted; and that after the long train\r\nof abuses and usurpations to which they have been subjected, evincing\r\na design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right,\r\nit is their duty, to throw off such government.\r\n\r\nThe declaration is, in some respects, defective. It complains of the\r\nwant of the elective franchise, and that ladies are not recognized as\r\nteachers of theology, medicine, and law.... These departments,\r\nhowever, do not comprise the whole of the many avenues to wealth,\r\ndistinction, and honor. We do not see by what principle of right the\r\nangelic creatures should claim to compete with the preacher, and\r\nrefuse to enter the lists with the merchant. A lawyer's brief would\r\nnot, we admit, sully the hands so much as the tarry ropes of a\r\nman-of-war; and a box of Brandreth's pills are more safely and easily\r\nprepared than the sheets of a boiler, or the flukes of an anchor; but\r\nif they must have competition in one branch, why not in another? There\r\nmust be no monopoly or exclusiveness. If they will put on the\r\ninexpressibles, it will not do to select those employments only which\r\nrequire the least exertion and are exempt from danger. The laborious\r\nemployments, however, are not the only ones which the ladies, in right\r\nof their admission to all rights and privileges, would have to\r\nundertake. It might happen that the citizen would have to doff the\r\napron and buckle on the sword. Now, though we have the most perfect\r\nconfidence in the courage and daring of Miss Lucretia Mott and several\r\nothers of our lady acquaintances, we confess it would go to our hearts\r\nto see them putting on the panoply of war, and mixing in scenes like\r\nthose at which, it is said, the fair sex in Paris lately took\r\nprominent part.\r\n\r\nIt is not the business, however, of the despot to decide upon the\r\nrights of his victims; nor do we undertake to define the duties of\r\nwomen. Their standard is now unfurled by their own hands. The\r\nConvention of Seneca Falls has appealed to the country. Miss Lucretia\r\nMott has propounded the principles of the party. Ratification meetings\r\nwill no doubt shortly be held, and if it be the general impression\r\nthat this lady is a more eligible candidate for the Presidential chair\r\nthan McLean or Cass, Van Buren or old \"Rough and Ready,\" then let the\r\nSalic laws be abolished forthwith from this great Republic. We are\r\nmuch mistaken if Lucretia would not make a better President than some\r\nof those who have lately tenanted the White House.--_New York Herald_,\r\nJames Gordon Bennett, Proprietor.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. STANTON'S REPLY.\r\n\r\nIn answer to all the newspaper objections, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, in\r\nan article published in the _National Reformer_, Rochester, N. Y.,\r\nGeo. G. Cooper, Editor, Sept. 14, 1848, said as follows:\r\n\r\nThere is no danger of this question dying for want of notice. Every\r\npaper you take up has something to say about it, and just in\r\nproportion to the refinement and intelligence of the editor, has this\r\nmovement been favorably noticed. But one might suppose from the\r\narticles that you find in some papers, that there were editors so\r\nignorant as to believe that the chief object of these recent\r\nConventions was to seat every lord at the head of a cradle, and to\r\nclothe every woman in her lord's attire. Now, neither of these points,\r\nhowever important they be considered by humble minds, were touched\r\nupon in the Conventions.... For those who do not yet understand the\r\nreal objects of our recent Conventions at Rochester and Seneca Falls,\r\nI would state that we did not meet to discuss fashions, customs, or\r\ndress, the rights or duties of man, nor the propriety of the sexes\r\nchanging positions, but simply our own inalienable rights, our duties,\r\nour true sphere. If God has assigned a sphere to man and one to woman,\r\nwe claim the right to judge ourselves of His design in reference to\r\n_us_, and we accord to man the same privilege. We think a man has\r\nquite enough in this life to find out his own individual calling,\r\nwithout being taxed to decide where every woman belongs; and the fact\r\nthat so many men fail in the business they undertake, calls loudly for\r\ntheir concentrating more thought on their own faculties, capabilities,\r\nand sphere of action. We have all seen a man making a jackass of\r\nhimself in the pulpit, at the bar, or in our legislative halls, when\r\nhe might have shone as a general in our Mexican war, captain of a\r\ncanal boat, or as a tailor on his bench. Now, is it to be wondered at\r\nthat woman has some doubts about the present position assigned her\r\nbeing the true one, when her every-day experience shows her that man\r\nmakes such fatal mistakes in regard to himself?\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing as a sphere for a sex. Every man has a\r\ndifferent sphere, and one in which he may shine, and it is the same\r\nwith every woman; and the same woman may have a different sphere at\r\ndifferent times. The distinguished Angelina Grimké was acknowledged by\r\nall the anti-slavery host to be in her sphere, when, years ago, she\r\nwent through the length and breadth of New England, telling the people\r\nof her personal experience of the horrors and abominations of the\r\nslave system, and by her eloquence and power as a public speaker,\r\nproducing an effect unsurpassed by any of the highly gifted men of her\r\nday. Who dares to say that in thus using her splendid talents in\r\nspeaking for the dumb, pleading the cause of the poor friendless\r\nslave, that she was out of her sphere? Angelina Grimké is now a wife\r\nand the mother of several children. We hear of her no more in public.\r\nHer sphere and her duties have changed. She deems it her first and her\r\nmost sacred duty to devote all her time and talents to her household\r\nand to the education of her children. We do not say that she is not\r\n_now_ in her sphere. The highly gifted Quakeress, Lucretia Mott,\r\nmarried early in life, and brought up a large family of children. All\r\nwho have seen her at home agree that she was a pattern as a wife,\r\nmother, and housekeeper. No one ever fulfilled all the duties of that\r\nsphere more perfectly than did she. Her children are now settled in\r\ntheir own homes. Her husband and herself, having a comfortable\r\nfortune, pass much of their time in going about and doing good.\r\nLueretia Mott has now no domestic cares. She has a talent for public\r\nspeaking; her mind is of a high order; her moral perceptions\r\nremarkably clear; her religious fervor deep and intense; and who shall\r\ntell us that this divinely inspired woman is out of her sphere in her\r\npublic endeavors to rouse this wicked nation to a sense of its awful\r\nguilt, to its great sins of war, slavery, injustice to woman and the\r\nlaboring poor. As many inquiries are made about Lucretia Mott's\r\nhusband, allow me, through your columns, to say to those who think he\r\nmust be a _nonentity_ because his wife is so distinguished, that James\r\nMott is head and shoulders above the greater part of _his sex_,\r\nintellectually, morally, and physically. As a man of business, his\r\ntalents are of the highest order. As an author, I refer you to his\r\ninteresting book of travels, \"Three Months in Great Britain.\" In\r\nmanners he is a gentleman; in appearance, six feet high, and\r\nwell-proportioned, dignified, and sensible, and in every respect\r\nworthy to be the companion of Lueretia Mott.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. C. I. H. NICHOLS.\r\n\r\nMiss Barber, of _The Madison_ (Ga.) _Visitor_, promises to \"sit in the\r\ncorner and be a good girl,\" if we will admit her to our next\r\n\"editorial _soirée_.\" Indeed we will, and brother Lamb, of _The\r\nGreenfield Democrat_, shall sit in the other corner and \"cast sheep's\r\n(Lamb's) eyes\" at her; for he copies her naughty declaration of\r\ninferiority, and adds that she \"is just the editress for him\"; that he\r\n\"don't like Mrs. Swisshelm, Mrs. Pierson, and that class.\" We will let\r\nhim off with a whispered reminder that there is a _Mr._ Swisshelm,\r\n_Mr._ Pierson, and more of the same sort for \"_that class_.\" He has\r\nnobody on his side but the musty, fusty old bachelors of the ----, and\r\n----, and ----, who, never having wanted for anything but _puddings_\r\nand _shirts_, imagine, as Mrs. Pierson says, that \"a shirt and a\r\npudding are the two poles of woman's sphere.\"\r\n\r\nBut we can not let Miss Barber off so lightly. She says \"it is written\r\nin the volume of inspiration, as plainly as if traced in sunbeams,\r\nthat man, the creature of God's own image, is superior to woman, who\r\nwas afterward created to be his companion. He has a more stately form,\r\nstronger nerves and muscles, and, in nine cases out of ten, a more\r\nvigorous intellect.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is paying no great compliment to man to suppose\r\nthat God created an inferior to be his companion. But a man, \"_the_\r\ncreature of God's own image!\" And was the material for God's image all\r\nworked up in creating Adam? And if so, whose images are the men of\r\nto-day, who can't possibly lay claim to more of the original stock\r\nthan mother Eve, who set up existence with an _entire rib_! And what\r\nhas it to do with the question of her intellectual equality, that she\r\nwas created _afterward_? If precedence in creation gave any advantage\r\nintellectually, the inferior animals may claim superiority of\r\nintellect over both man and woman. It would be quite as sound logic to\r\nmaintain, as some do, that, as last in the series which commenced in\r\nnothing (?) and rose by gradations to image God, woman's superiority\r\nto all that preceded her in the creation, is probable.... Again, if\r\nwomen have less nerves and muscles, the ox and the ass have a great\r\ndeal more--while God and angels and disembodied spirits have none at\r\nall; so that nerves and muscles are of no more significance in this\r\nquestion of the intellectual equality or inequality of the sexes, than\r\nis the beard that grows on a man's face and not on a woman's. And\r\narguments drawn from such premises always remind us of the profound\r\nlogic of a gentleman we once met in a stage coach, and who is now\r\nholding a high office under Government at Washington. He professed to\r\nset great store by whiskers and mustaches--he had none himself--and\r\ngave as a reason why the beard should be tenderly cherished, that \"it\r\nwas given to man as a badge of his superiority over woman.\" We were\r\nyoung and mischievous then, and so we told him, most complacently,\r\nthat the ladies would readily concede the point, and give him the full\r\nbenefit of his argument and of his beard, since men shared their\r\n\"badge of superiority\" with goats, monkeys, and many other inferior\r\nanimals. Some fifteen years have passed, but we never think of the\r\nhonorable gentleman or see his name attached to official reports,\r\nwithout a laugh.\r\n\r\nMiss Barber assumes woman's entire intellectual equality, in claiming\r\nthat she \"may mould the mind of the future statesman into _whatsoever_\r\nshe will--that \"through him she _can_ and _will_ make the laws.\" And\r\nwe only regret that she should speak so lightly of \"depositing a\r\nlittle strip of paper in the ballot-box.\" To us it is a serious thing,\r\nthat the depositing of that strip of paper gives and takes the rights,\r\nwhose possession is the means of the highest intellectual and moral\r\nculture and enjoyment.--_Windom County Democrat_, Brattleboro,\r\nVermont.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. JANE G. SWISSHELM.\r\n\r\nA MISTAKE.--_Dear Brother Wright_:--In printing my former letter,\r\nthere was a mistake made which I intended to let pass; but as some of\r\nyour cotemporaries have taken an agony over the letter, it may be as\r\nwell to set it right. The last sentence reads, \"Now, I move Grace be\r\nlet alone, and her moral power be no longer invoked by those who have\r\nset her and all the rest of her sex, down on a stool mid-way between\r\nfree negroes and laborers.\" I wrote it \"between free negroes and\r\n_baboons_,\" and meant just what I said. Man, in his code of laws, has\r\nassigned woman a place somewhere between the rational and irrational\r\ncreation. Our Constitutions provide that all \"free white male\r\ncitizens\" of a certain age shall have a right to vote. Here Indians,\r\nnegroes, and women stand side by side. Our gallant legislators\r\nexcluded the \"inferior races\" from the elective franchise because of\r\ntheir inferiority; and just threw their wives and mothers into the\r\nsame heap, because of their great superiority! One was excluded\r\nbecause they hated them, the other because they loved them so very\r\nwell. Yet one sentence covers both cases. Women and negroes stand side\r\nby side in this case, and also in that of exclusion from our colleges.\r\nA negro can not be admitted into one of our colleges or seminaries of\r\nthe highest class. Neither can a woman. Witness the refusal of some\r\nhalf dozen of your medical colleges to admit Miss Blackwell.\r\n\r\nBut free negroes can acquire property, can sell it, keep it, give it\r\naway, or divide it. A baboon has no such rights; neither has a woman\r\nin her highest state of existence here. The right to acquire and hold\r\nproperty is a distinguishing trait between mankind and the brute\r\ncreation. Woman is deprived of that distinction; for all that she has\r\nand all she can acquire, belongs to her master. Custom says she should\r\nbe fed and clothed, dandled and fondled, her freaks borne with and her\r\ngraces admired; it awards the same attentions, in a little different\r\ndegree, to a pet monkey. So woman has been \"set down mid-way between\r\nfree negroes and baboons.\"\r\n\r\n                                   Your good-tempered friend and sister,\r\n                                                JANE G. SWISSHELM.\r\n\r\nBORDERS OF MONKEYDOM, _Sept. 28, 1848_.\r\n\r\nP. S.--There is a man who edits _The Sunday Age_ of New York--H. P.\r\nGrattan--who appears to be in a peck of trouble about \"Blue-Stocking\r\nEffusions\" in general, and my letter to you in particular. He says,\r\n\"We love woman. We bow down to them in adoration. But they have their\r\nproper place; but the moment they step from the pedestal upon which\r\nheaven stood them, they fail to elicit our admiration,\" etc. Then, to\r\nshow what the pedestal is on which he adores them, he adds, \"If they\r\ngave evidence of a knowledge of puddings and pies, how much happier\r\nthey might be,\" in the sunlight of his admiration, of course. Well,\r\nfreedom of conscience in this free land! The Faithful may bow to his\r\nprophet; the Persian adore his sun; the Egyptian may kneel to his\r\ncrocodile; and why should not Mr. Grattan go into rhapsodies before\r\nhis cook, as the dispenser of the good things of this life? The good\r\nbook speaks of \"natural brute beasts who make a god of their bellies,\"\r\nand it might be natural to transfer the homage to her who ministers to\r\nthe stomach. I can see his chosen divinity now, mounted on her\r\n\"pedestal,\" a kitchen stool, her implements before her, crowned with a\r\npudding-pan, her sceptre a batter spoon, and Mr. Grattan down, in rapt\r\nadoration, with eyes upturned, and looks of piteous pleading! Poor\r\nfellow! Do give him his dinner! J. G. S.--_Saturday Visitor_,\r\nPittsburg, Penn.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the titles of editorials and communications in\r\nrespectable papers all over the country: \"Bolting among the Ladies,\"\r\n\"Women Out of their Latitude,\" \"Insurrection among the Women,\" \"The\r\nReign of Petticoats,\" \"Office-Seeking Women,\" \"Petticoats _vs._\r\nBoots.\" The reader can judge, with such texts for inspiration, what\r\nthe sermons must have been.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTIONS AT ROCHESTER.\r\n\r\nThe following resolutions, which had been separately discussed, were\r\nagain read. Amy Post moved their adoption by the meeting, which was\r\ncarried with but two or three dissenting voices:\r\n\r\n1. _Resolved_, That we petition our State Legislature for our right to\r\nthe elective franchise, every year, until our prayer be granted.\r\n\r\n2. _Resolved_, That it is an admitted principle of the American\r\nRepublic, that the only just power of the Government is derived from\r\nthe consent of the governed; and that taxation and representation are\r\ninseparable; and, therefore, woman being taxed equally with man, ought\r\nnot to be deprived of an equal representation in the Government.\r\n\r\n3. _Resolved_, That we deplore the apathy and indifference of woman in\r\nregard to her rights, thus restricting her to an inferior position in\r\nsocial, religious, and political life, and we urge her to claim an\r\nequal right to act on all subjects that interest the human family.\r\n\r\n4. _Resolved_, That the assumption of law to settle estates of men who\r\ndie without wills, having widows, is an insult to woman, and ought to\r\nbe regarded as such by every lover of right and equality.\r\n\r\n5. WHEREAS, The husband has the legal right to hire out his wife to\r\nservice, collect her wages, and appropriate it to his own exclusive\r\nand independent benefit; and,\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, This has contributed to establish that hideous custom, the\r\npromise, of obedience in the marriage contract, effectually, though\r\ninsidiously, reducing her almost to the condition of a slave, whatever\r\nfreedom she may have in these respects being granted as a privilege,\r\nnot as a right; therefore,\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we will seek the overthrow of this barbarous and\r\nunrighteous law; and conjure women no longer to promise obedience in\r\nthe marriage covenant.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the universal doctrine of the inferiority of woman\r\nhas ever caused her to distrust her own powers, and paralyzed her\r\nenergies, and placed her in that degraded position from which the most\r\nstrenuous and unremitting effort can alone redeem her.\r\n\r\nOnly by faithful perseverance in the practical exercise of those\r\ntalents, so long \"wrapped in a napkin and buried under the earth,\" she\r\nwill regain her long-lost equality with man.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That in the persevering and independent course of Miss\r\nBlackwell, who recently attended a series of medical lectures in\r\nGeneva, and has now gone to Europe to graduate as a physician, we see\r\na harbinger of the day when woman shall stand forth \"redeemed and\r\ndisenthralled,\" and perform those important duties which are so truly\r\nwithin her sphere.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That those who believe the laboring classes of women are\r\noppressed, ought to do all in their power to raise their wages,\r\nbeginning with their own household servants.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That it is the duty of woman, whatever her complexion, to\r\nassume, as soon as possible, her true position of equality in the\r\nsocial circle, the Church, and the State.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we tender our grateful acknowledgment to the Trustees\r\nof the Unitarian Church, who have kindly opened their doors for the\r\nuse of this Convention.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we, the friends who are interested in this cause,\r\ngratefully accept the kind offer from the Trustees of the use of\r\nProtection Hall, to hold our meetings whenever we wish.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNATURES TO THE DECLARATION ADOPTED AT SENECA FALLS.\r\n\r\nFirmly relying upon the final triumph of the Right and the True, we do\r\nthis day affix our signatures to this Declaration:\r\n\r\n          Lucretia Mott,                         Hannah Plant,\r\n          Harriet Cady Eaton,                    Lucy Jones,\r\n          Margaret Pryor,                        Sarah Whitney,\r\n          Elizabeth Cady Stanton,                Mary H.

Y., _April 7_.\r\n\r\nDEAR MARIANA:--How rejoiced I am to hear that the women of Ohio have\r\ncalled a Convention preparatory to the remodeling of their State\r\nConstitution. The remodeling of a Constitution, in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, speaks of progress, of greater freedom, and of more enlarged\r\nviews of human rights and duties. It is fitting that, at such a time,\r\nwoman, who has so long been the victim of ignorance and injustice,\r\nshould at length throw off the trammels of a false education, stand\r\nupright, and with dignity and earnestness manifest a deep and serious\r\ninterest in the laws which are to govern her and her country. It needs\r\nno argument to teach woman that she is interested in the laws which\r\ngovern her. Suffering has taught her this already. It is important now\r\nthat a change is proposed, that she speak, and loudly too. Having\r\ndecided to petition for a redress of grievances, the question is, _for\r\nwhat shall you first petition?_ For the exercise of your right to the\r\nelective franchise--nothing short of this. The grant to you of this\r\nright will secure all others; and the granting of every other right,\r\nwhilst this is denied, is a mockery. For instance: What is the right\r\nto property without the right to protect it? The enjoyment of that\r\nright to-day is no security that it will be continued to-morrow, so\r\nlong as it is granted to us as a favor, and not claimed by us as a\r\nright. Woman must exercise her right to the elective franchise, and\r\nhave her own representatives in our National councils, for two good\r\nreasons:\r\n\r\n1st. Men can not represent us. They are so thoroughly educated into\r\nthe belief that woman's nature is altogether different from their own,\r\nthat they have no idea that she can be governed by the same laws of\r\nmind as themselves. So far from viewing us like themselves, they seem,\r\nfrom their legislation, to consider us their moral and intellectual\r\nantipodes; for whatever law they find good for themselves, they\r\nforthwith pass its opposite for us, and express the most profound\r\nastonishment if we manifest the least dissatisfaction. For example:\r\nour forefathers, _full of righteous indignation_, pitched King George,\r\nhis authority, and his tea-chests, all into the sea, and because,\r\nforsooth, they were forced to pay taxes without being represented in\r\nthe British Government. \"Taxation without representation,\" was the\r\ntext for many a hot debate in the forests of the New World, and for\r\nmany an eloquent oration in the Parliament of the Old. Yet, in forming\r\nour new Government, they have taken from us the very rights which they\r\nfought and bled and, died to secure to themselves. They not only tax\r\nus, but in many cases they strip us of all we inherit, the wages we\r\nearn, the children of our love; and for such grievances we have no\r\nredress in any court of justice this side of Heaven. They tax our\r\nproperty to build colleges, then pass a special law prohibiting any\r\nwoman to enter there. A married woman has no legal existence; she has\r\nno more absolute rights than a slave on a Southern plantation. She\r\ntakes the name of her master, holds nothing, owns nothing, can bring\r\nno action in her own name; and the principle on which she and the\r\nslave is educated is the game. The slave is taught what is considered\r\nbest for him to know--which is nothing; the woman is taught what is\r\nbest for her to know--which is little more than nothing, man being the\r\numpire in both cases. A woman can not follow out the impulses of her\r\nown mind in her sphere, any more than the slave can in his sphere.\r\nCivilly, socially, and religiously, she is what man chooses her to be,\r\nnothing more or less, and such is the slave. It is impossible for us\r\nto convince man that we think and feel exactly as he does; that we\r\nhave the same sense of right and justice, the same love of freedom and\r\nindependence. Some men regard us as devils, and some as angels; hence,\r\none class would shut us up in a certain sphere for fear of the evil we\r\nmight do, and the other for fear of the evil that _might be done to\r\nus_; thus, except for the sentiment of the thing, for all the good\r\nthat it does us, we might as well be thought the one as the other. But\r\nwe ourselves have to do with what we are and what we _shall_ be.\r\n\r\n2d. Men can not legislate for us. Our statute books and all past\r\nexperience teach us this fact. His laws, where we are concerned, have\r\nbeen, without one exception, unjust, cruel, and aggressive. Having\r\ndenied our identity with himself, he has no data to go upon in judging\r\nof our wants and interests. If we are alike in our mental structure,\r\nthen there is no reason why we should not have a voice in making the\r\nlaws which govern us; but if we are not alike, most certainly we must\r\nmake laws for ourselves, for who else can understand what we need and\r\ndesire? If it be admitted in this Government that all men and women\r\nare free and equal, then must we claim a place in our Senate Chamber\r\nand House of Representatives. But if, after all, it be found that even\r\nhere we have classes and caste, not \"Lords and Commons,\" but lords and\r\nwomen, then must we claim a lower House, where our Representatives can\r\nwatch the passage of all bills affecting our own welfare, or the good\r\nof our country. Had the women of this country had a voice in the\r\nGovernment, think you our national escutcheon would have been stained\r\nwith the guilt of aggressive warfare upon such weak, defenceless\r\nnations as the Seminoles and Mexicans? Think you we should cherish and\r\ndefend, in the heart of our nation, such a wholesale system of piracy,\r\ncruelty, licentiousness, and ignorance as is our slavery? Think you\r\nthat relic of barbarism, the gallows, by which the wretched murderer\r\nis sent with blood upon his soul, uncalled for, into the presence of\r\nhis God, would be sustained by law? Verily, no, or I mistake woman's\r\nheart, her instinctive love of justice, and mercy, and truth!\r\n\r\nWho questions woman's right to vote? We can show our credentials to\r\nthe right of self-government; we get ours just where man got his; they\r\nare all Heaven-descended, God-given. It is our duty to assert and\r\nreassert this right, to agitate, discuss, and petition, until our\r\npolitical equality be fully recognized. Depend upon it, this is the\r\npoint to attack, the stronghold of the fortress--_the one_ woman will\r\nfind the most difficult to take, _the one_ man will most reluctantly\r\ngive up; therefore let us encamp right under its shadow; there spend\r\nall our time, strength, and _moral_ ammunition, year after year, with\r\nperseverance, courage, and decision. Let no sallies of wit or ridicule\r\nat our expense; no soft nonsense of woman's beauty, delicacy, and\r\nrefinement; no promise of gold and silver, bank stock, road stock, or\r\nlanded estate, seduce us from our position until that one stronghold\r\ntotters to the ground. This done, the rest they will surrender _at\r\ndiscretion_. Then comes equality in Church and State, in the family\r\ncircle, and in all our social relations.\r\n\r\nThe cause of woman is onward. For our encouragement, let us take a\r\nreview of what has occurred during the last few years. Not two years\r\nsince the women of New York held several Conventions. Their meetings\r\nwere well attended by both men and women, and the question of woman's\r\ntrue position was fully and freely discussed. The proceedings of those\r\nmeetings and the Declaration of Sentiments were all published and\r\nscattered far and near. Before that time, the newspapers said but\r\nlittle on that subject. Immediately after, there was scarcely a\r\nnewspaper in the Union that did not notice these Conventions, and\r\ngenerally in a tone of ridicule. Now you seldom take up a paper that\r\nhas not something about woman; but the tone is changing--ridicule is\r\ngiving way to reason. Our papers begin to see that this is no subject\r\nfor mirth, but one for serious consideration. Our literature is also\r\nassuming a different tone. The heroine of our fashionable novel is now\r\na being of spirit, of energy, of will, with a conscience, with high\r\nmoral principle, great decision, and self-reliance.\r\n\r\nContrast Jane Eyre with any of Bulwer's, Scott's, or Shakespeare's\r\nheroines, and how they all sink into the shade compared with that\r\nnoble creation of a woman's genius! The January number of _The\r\nWestminster Review_ contains an article on \"Woman,\" so liberal and\r\nradical, that I sometimes think it must have crept in there by\r\nmistake. Our fashionable lecturers, too, are now, instead of the\r\ntime-worn subjects of \"Catholicism,\" \"The Crusades,\" \"St. Bernard,\"\r\nand \"Thomas à Becket,\" choosing Woman for their theme. True, they do\r\nnot treat this new subject with much skill or philosophy; but enough\r\nfor us that the great minds of our day are taking this direction. Mr.\r\nDana, of Boston, lectured on this subject in Philadelphia. Lucretia\r\nMott followed him, and ably pointed out his sophistry and errors. She\r\nspoke to a large and fashionable audience, and gave general\r\nsatisfaction. Dana was too sickly and sentimental for that meridian.\r\nThe women of Massachusetts, ever first in all moral movements, have\r\nsent, but a few weeks since, to their Legislature, a petition\r\ndemanding their right to vote and hold office in their State. Woman\r\nseems to be preparing herself for a higher and holier destiny. That\r\nsame love of liberty which burned in the hearts of our sires, is now\r\nbeing kindled anew in the daughters of this proud Republic. From the\r\npresent state of public sentiment, we have every reason to look\r\nhopefully into the future. I see a brighter, happier day yet to come;\r\nbut woman must say how soon the dawn shall be, and whether the light\r\nshall first shine in the East or the West. By her own efforts the\r\nchange must come. She must carve out her future destiny with her own\r\nright hand. If she have not the energy to secure for herself her true\r\nposition, neither would she have the force or stability to maintain\r\nit, if placed there by another. Farewell!\r\n\r\n                                   Yours sincerely,\r\n                                                    E. C. STANTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM LUCRETIA MOTT.\r\n\r\nDEAR FRIENDS:--The call for this Convention, so numerously signed, is\r\nindeed gratifying, and gives hope of a large attendance. The letter of\r\ninvitation was duly received, and I need scarcely say how gladly I\r\nwould be present if in my power. Engagements in another direction, as\r\nwell as the difficulty to travel at this season of the year, will\r\nprevent my availing myself of so great a privilege. You will not,\r\nhowever, be at a loss for speakers in your midst, for among the\r\nsigners to the call are the names of many whose hearts \"believe unto\r\nrighteousness\"; out of their abundance, therefore, the mouth will make\r\n\"confession unto salvation.\"\r\n\r\nThe wrongs of woman have too long slumbered. They now begin to cry for\r\nredress. Let them be clearly pointed oat in your Convention; and then,\r\nnot _ask_ as _favor_, but _demand_ as _right_, that every civil and\r\necclesiastical obstacle be removed out of the way.\r\n\r\nRights are not dependent upon equality of mind; nor do we admit\r\ninferiority, leaving that question to be settled by future\r\ndevelopments, when a fair opportunity shall be given for the equal\r\ncultivation of the intellect, and the stronger powers of the mind\r\nshall be called into action.\r\n\r\nIf, in accordance with your call, you ascertain \"the bearing which the\r\ncircumscribed sphere of woman has on the great political and social\r\nevils that curse and desolate the land,\" you will not have come\r\ntogether in vain.\r\n\r\nMay you, indeed, \"gain strength\" by your contest with \"difficulty!\"\r\nMay the whole armor of \"Right, Truth, and Reason\" be yours; Then will\r\nthe influence of the Convention be felt in the assembled wisdom of\r\n_men_ which is to follow; and the good results, as well as your\r\nexample, will ultimately rouse other States to action in this most\r\nimportant cause.\r\n\r\nI herewith forward to you a \"Discourse on Woman,\" which, though\r\nbrought out by local circumstances, may yet contain principles of\r\nuniversal application.\r\n\r\nWishing you every success in your noble effort,\r\n\r\n          I am yours, for woman's redemption and consequent elevation,\r\n                                                    LUCRETIA MOTT.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, _4th mo., 13, 1850_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM LUCY STONE.\r\n\r\n_For the Woman's Rights Convention:_\r\n\r\nDEAR FRIENDS:--The friends of human freedom in Massachusetts rejoice\r\nthat a Woman's Rights Convention is to be held in Ohio. We hail it as\r\na sign of progress, and deem it especially fitting that such a\r\nConvention should be held _now_, when a State Constitution is to be\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nIt is easier, when the old is destroyed, to build the _new_ right,\r\nthan to right it _after_ it is built.\r\n\r\nThe statute books of every State in the Union are disgraced by an\r\narticle which limits the right to the elective franchise to \"male\r\ncitizens of twenty-one years of age and upwards,\" thus excluding\r\none-half the population of the country from all political influence,\r\nsubjecting woman to laws in the making of which she has neither vote\r\nnor voice. The lowest drunkard may come up from wallowing in the\r\ngutter, and, covered with filth, _reel_ up to the ballot-box and\r\ndeposit his vote, and his right to do so is not questioned. The\r\nmeanest foreigner who comes to our shores, who can not speak his\r\nmother-tongue correctly, has secured for him the right of suffrage.\r\nThe negro, crushed and degraded, as if he were not a brother man, made\r\nthe lowest of the law, even he, in some of the States, can vote; but\r\nwoman, in every State, is politically plunged in a degradation lower\r\nthan _his_ lowest depths.\r\n\r\nWoman is taxed under laws made by those who profess to believe that\r\ntaxation and representation are inseparable, while, in the use and\r\nimposition of the taxes, as in representation, she is absolutely\r\nwithout influence. Should she hint that the profession and practice do\r\nnot agree, she is gravely told that \"Women should not talk politics.\"\r\nIn most of the States the married woman loses, by her marriage, the\r\ncontrol of her person and the right of property, and, if she is a\r\nmother, the right to her children also: while she secures what the\r\ntown paupers have--the right to be maintained. The legal disabilities\r\nunder which women labor have no end: I will not attempt to enumerate\r\nthem. Let the earnest women who speak in your Convention enter into\r\nthe detail of this thing, nor stop to \"patch fig-leaves for the naked\r\ntruth,\" but \"before all Israel and the sun,\" expose the atrocities of\r\nthe laws relative to women, until the ears of those who hear shall\r\ntingle. So that the men who meet in Convention to form the new\r\nConstitution for Ohio, shall, for very shame's sake, make haste to put\r\naway the last remnant of the barbarism which your statute book (in\r\ncommon with other States) retains in its inequality and injustice to\r\nwoman. We know too well the stern reform spirit of those who have\r\ncalled this Woman's Eights Convention, to doubt for a moment that\r\nwhat can be done by you to secure equal rights for all, will be done.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts _ought_ to have taken the lead in the work you are now\r\ndoing, but if she chooses to linger, let her young sisters of the West\r\nset her a worthy example; and if the \"Pilgrim spirit is not dead,\"\r\n_we'll pledge Massachusetts to follow her_.\r\n\r\n                         Yours, for Justice and Equal Rights,\r\n                                                       LUCY STONE.\r\n\r\nSOUTHAMPTON, _April 10, 1850_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM SARAH PUGH\r\n\r\n\"Lawrencian Villa is extremely beautiful; the grounds full of\r\nshrubbery and flowers; the splendid dairy, the green-houses and\r\nconservatories--four or five of them appropriated to fruit, flowers,\r\nand rare plants in large numbers--the whole presenting great taste and\r\nskill. Mrs. Lawrence's improvements are not completed; she is\r\nextending her shrubbery and walks. She is undoubtedly one of the most\r\nskillful cultivators and florists in the country (a country abounding\r\nwith them), and carries off more prizes at the horticultural\r\nexhibitions than almost any one else. I am told Mr. Lawrence is an\r\neminent surgeon in London, and that the whole of the country place is\r\nunder Mrs. Lawrence's management.\"--_Colman's Letters from Europe_.\r\n\r\nDEAR FRIENDS:--As I finished reading this paragraph, your letter,\r\ninviting me to your Convention, to be held on the 19th inst., was\r\nreceived. I can not, as I gladly would, be with you. That my mite may\r\nnot be wanting in aid of the cause, taking the above extract for my\r\ntext, I would add as a commentary, that, according to the laws and\r\nusages of a large portion of Christendom, in the event of the death of\r\nMr. Lawrence, Mrs. Lawrence, the one whose skill and taste has formed\r\nthis elegant establishment, would be left by the will of Mr. Lawrence\r\nan income from a part of the estate, and the \"privilege\" of occupying\r\n\"during her natural life,\" two or three rooms in the large mansion,\r\nbut powerless as a stranger in the beautiful demesne made valuable by\r\nher industry and skill! This is not \"supposing\" a case, only in the\r\napplication of it to Mrs. L. In this country, where, as a general\r\nrule, women take their full share of the labor and responsibility of a\r\nhousehold, and thus by their constant assiduity contribute their full\r\nproportion to the means by which a comfortable competence is secured,\r\ndo we not see the disposal of it assumed as a matter of right by the\r\nmale partner of the firm?\r\n\r\nThat women contribute their full share in the building-up of an estate\r\nby _labor_--the only rightful mode--no one that is capable of taking\r\nan enlightened view of the prevailing condition of things will deny.\r\nTrue, she may not wield the axe or guide the plough, braced by the\r\ninvigorating air, for hers is the wearisome task, and the one which\r\nrequires the most skill to attend to the complicated machinery within\r\ndoors; she may not handle the awl or the plane for \"ten hours a day,\"\r\nwith but a small tax on the intellectual, but by her _perpetual_\r\noversight and unvarying labor she may make one dollar, two, or more.\r\n\r\nThis is one form of the many grievances to which women are subjected,\r\nall arising from the false assumption of their inferiority by nature\r\nand by the \"ordination of Providence.\" May your Convention aid in\r\ndispelling this delusion from the minds of men, but chiefly from the\r\nminds of women; for to themselves, in a great degree, is their\r\ndegraded position owing. Rouse them to a belief in their natural\r\nequality, and to a desire to sustain it by cultivation of their\r\nnoblest powers.\r\n\r\nThere is much that crowds on me for utterance, but there will be those\r\namong you that will be able to give a fuller and fitter expression to\r\nthe thoughts that cluster around this all-important question, the\r\n\"Rights and Duties of Women\"--her rights equal to those of men--she\r\nalone the judge of her duties.\r\n\r\nMay your Convention hasten the day when these rights shall be\r\nacknowledged as equal to those of man and independent of him, and when\r\nmen and women shall equally co-operate for the good of all mankind.\r\n\r\n                         With great interest, your friend,\r\n                                                       SARAH PUGH.\r\n\r\n_To the Ohio Convention of Women, Phila., April 15, 1850._\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTIONS OF THE SALEM (OHIO) CONVENTION, 1850.\r\n\r\n6th. _Resolved_, That in those laws which confer on man the power to\r\ncontrol the property and person of woman, and to remove from her at\r\nwill the children of her affection, we recognize only the modified\r\ncode of the slave plantation; and that thus we are brought more nearly\r\nin sympathy with the suffering slave, who is despoiled of all his\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n16th. _Resolved_, That we regard those women who content themselves\r\nwith an idle, aimless life, as involved in the guilt as well as the\r\nsuffering of their own oppression; and that we hold those who go forth\r\ninto the world, in the face of the frowns and the sneers of the\r\npublic, to fill larger spheres of labor, as the truest preachers of\r\nthe cause of Woman's Rights.\r\n\r\n19th. _Resolved_, That, as woman is not permitted to hold office, nor\r\nhave any voice in the Government, she should not be compelled to pay\r\ntaxes out of her scanty wages to support men who get eight dollars a\r\nday for _taking_ the right to _themselves_ to enact laws _for_ her.\r\n\r\n20th. _Resolved_, That we, the women of Ohio, will hereafter meet\r\nannually in Convention, to consult upon and adopt measures for the\r\nremoval of the various disabilities--political, social, religious,\r\nlegal, and pecuniary--to which women, as a class, are subjected, and\r\nfrom which results so much misery, degradation, and crime.\r\n\r\nAfter the Akron Convention in 1851, _The New York Sunday Mercury_\r\npublished a woodcut covering a whole page, representing the\r\nConvention. Every woman in coat and breeches and high-heeled boots,\r\nsitting cross-legged smoking cigars (truly manly arguments for equal\r\npolitical rights). There was not a Bloomer present.\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH CADY STANTON.\r\n\r\n_To the Woman's Convention, held at Akron, Ohio, May 25, 1851:_\r\n\r\nDEAR FRIENDS:--It would give me great pleasure to accept your\r\ninvitation to attend the Convention, but as circumstances forbid my\r\nbeing present with you, allow me, in addressing you by letter, to\r\ntouch on those points of this great question which have, of late, much\r\noccupied my thoughts. It is often said to us tauntingly, \"Well, you\r\nhave held Conventions, you have speechified and resolved, protested\r\nand appealed, declared and petitioned, and now, what next? Why do you\r\nnot do something?\" I have as often heard the reply, \"We know not what\r\nto do.\"\r\n\r\nHaving for some years rehearsed to the unjust judge our grievances,\r\nour legal and political disabilities and social wrongs, let us glance\r\nat what we may do, at the various rights of which we may, even now,\r\nquietly take possession. True, our right to vote we can not exercise\r\nuntil our State Constitutions are remodelled; but we can petition our\r\nlegislators every session, and plead our cause before them. We can\r\nmake a manifestation by going to the polls, at each returning\r\nelection, bearing banners, with inscriptions thereon of great\r\nsentiments handed down to us by our revolutionary fathers--such as,\r\n\"No Taxation without Representation,\" \"No just Government can be\r\nformed without the consent of the Governed,\" etc. We can refuse to pay\r\nall taxes, and, like the English dissenters, suffer our goods to be\r\nseized and sold, if need be. Such manifestations would appeal to a\r\nclass of minds that now take no note of our Conventions or their\r\nproceedings; who never dream, even, that woman thinks herself\r\ndefrauded of a single right. The trades and professions are all open\r\nto us; let us quietly enter and make ourselves, if not rich and\r\nfamous, at least independent and respectable. Many of them are quite\r\nproper to woman, and some peculiarly so. As merchants, postmasters,\r\nand silversmiths, teachers, preachers, and physicians, woman has\r\nalready proved herself fully competent. Who so well fitted to fill the\r\npulpits of our day as woman? All admit her superior to man in the\r\naffections, high moral sentiments, and religious enthusiasm; and so\r\nlong as our popular theology and reason are at loggerheads, we have no\r\nneed of acute metaphysicians or skillful logicians in our pulpits. We\r\nwant those who can make the most effective appeals to our\r\nimaginations, our hopes and fears.\r\n\r\nAgain, as physicians. How desirable are educated women in this\r\nprofession! Give her knowledge commensurate with her natural\r\nqualifications, and there is no position woman could assume that would\r\nbe so pre-eminently useful to her race at large, and her own sex in\r\nparticular, as that of ministering angel to the sick and afflicted; an\r\nangel, not capable of sympathy merely, but armed with the power to\r\nrelieve suffering and prevent disease. The science of Obstetrics is a\r\nbranch of the profession which should be monopolized by woman. The\r\nfact that it is now almost wholly in the hands of the male\r\npractitioner, is an outrage on common decency that nothing but the\r\ntyrant _custom_ can excuse. \"From the earliest history down to 1568,\r\nit was practiced by women. The distinguished individual first to make\r\nthe innovation on this ancient, time-sanctified custom, was no less a\r\npersonage than a court prostitute, the Duchess of Villiers, a favorite\r\nmistress of Louis XIV. of France.\" This is a formidable evil, and\r\nproductive of much immorality, misery, and crime. But now that some\r\ncolleges are open to woman, and the \"Female Medical College of\r\nPennsylvania\" has been established for our sex exclusively, I hope\r\nthis custom may be abolished as speedily as possible, for no excuse\r\ncan be found for its continuance, in the want of knowledge and skill\r\nin our own sex. It seems to me, the existence of this custom argues a\r\nmuch greater want of delicacy and refinement in woman, than would the\r\npractice of the profession by her in all its various branches.\r\n\r\nBut the great work before us is the education of those just coming on\r\nthe stage of action. Begin with the girls of _to-day_, and in twenty\r\nyears we can revolutionize this nation. The childhood of woman must be\r\nfree and untrammeled. The girl must be allowed to romp and play,\r\nclimb, skate, and swim; her clothing must be more like that of the\r\nboy--strong, loose-fitting garments, thick boots, etc., that she may\r\nbe out at all times, and enter freely into all kinds of sports. Teach\r\nher to go alone, by night and day, if need be, on the lonely highway,\r\nor through the busy streets of the crowded metropolis. The manner in\r\nwhich all courage and self-reliance is educated _out_ of the girl, her\r\npath portrayed with dangers and difficulties that never exist, is\r\nmelancholy indeed. Better, far, suffer occasional insults or die\r\noutright, than live the life of a _coward_, or never move without a\r\nprotector. The best protector any woman can have, one that will serve\r\nher at all times and in all places, is _courage_; this she must get by\r\nher own experience, and experience comes by exposure. Let the girl be\r\nthoroughly developed in body and soul, not modeled, like a piece of\r\nclay, after some artificial specimen of humanity, with a body like\r\nsome plate in Godey's book of fashion, and a mind after the type of\r\nFather Gregory's pattern daughters, loaded down with the traditions,\r\nproprieties, and sentimentalities of generations of silly mothers and\r\ngrandmothers, but left free to be, to grow, to feel, to think, to act.\r\nDevelopment is one thing, that system of cramping, restraining,\r\ntorturing, perverting, and mystifying, called education, is quite\r\nanother. We have had women enough befooled under the one system, pray\r\nlet us try the other. The girl must early be impressed with the idea\r\nthat she is to be \"a hand, not a mouth\"; a worker, and not a drone, in\r\nthe great hive of human activity. Like the boy, she must be taught to\r\nlook forward to a life of self-dependence, and early prepare herself\r\nfor some trade or profession. Woman has relied heretofore too entirely\r\nfor her support on the _needle_--that one-eyed demon of destruction\r\nthat slays its thousands annually; that evil genius of our sex, which,\r\nin spite of all our devotion, will never make us healthy, wealthy, or\r\nwise.\r\n\r\nTeach the girl it is no part of her life to cater to the prejudices of\r\nthose around her. Make her independent of public sentiment, by showing\r\nher how worthless and rotten a thing it is. It is a settled axiom with\r\nme, after much examination and reflection, that public sentiment is\r\nfalse on every subject. Yet what a tyrant it is over us all, woman\r\nespecially, whose very life is to please, whose highest ambition is to\r\nbe approved. But once outrage this tyrant, place yourself beyond his\r\njurisdiction, taste the joy of free thought and action, and how\r\npowerless is his rule over you! his sceptre lies broken at your feet;\r\nhis very babblings of condemnation are sweet music in your ears; his\r\ndarkening frown is sunshine to your heart, for they tell of your\r\ntriumph and his discomfort. Think you, women _thus_ educated would\r\nlong remain the weak, dependent beings we now find them? By no means.\r\nDepend upon it, they would soon settle for themselves this whole\r\nquestion of Woman's Rights. As educated capitalists and skillful\r\nlaborers, they would not be long in finding their true level in\r\npolitical and social life.\r\n\r\n                                             E. C. STANTON.\r\nSENECA FALLS, _May 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTIONS OF THE MASSILON (OHIO) CONVENTION, 1852.\r\n\r\n1st. _Resolved_, That in the proposition affirmed by the nation to be\r\nself-evidently true, that \"all men are created equal,\" the word \"MEN\"\r\nis a general term, including the whole race, without distinction of\r\nsex.\r\n\r\n2d. _Resolved_, That this equality of the sexes must extend, and does\r\nextend, to rights personal, social, legal, political, industrial, and\r\nreligious, including, of course, representation in the Government,\r\nthe elective franchise, free choice in occupations, and an impartial\r\ndistribution of the reward of effort; and in reference to all these\r\nparticulars, woman has the same right to choose _her_ sphere of\r\naction, as man to choose _his_.\r\n\r\n3d. _Resolved_, That since every human being has an individual sphere,\r\nand that is the largest he or she can fill, no one has the right to\r\ndetermine the proper sphere of another.\r\n\r\n4th. _Resolved_, That the assertion of these rights for woman, equally\r\nwith man, involves the doctrine that she, equally with him, should be\r\n_protected in their exercise_.\r\n\r\n5th. _Resolved_, That we do not believe any legal or political\r\nrestriction necessary to preserve the distinctive character of woman,\r\nand that in demanding for women equality of rights with their fathers,\r\nhusbands, brothers, and sons, we neither deny that distinctive\r\ncharacter, nor wish them to avoid any duty, or to lay aside that\r\nfeminine delicacy which legitimately belongs to them as mothers,\r\nwives, sisters, and daughters.\r\n\r\n6th. _Resolved_, That to perfect the marriage union and provide for\r\nthe inevitable vicissitudes of life, the individuality of both parties\r\nshould be equally and distinctively recognised by the parties\r\nthemselves, and by the laws of the land; and, therefore, justice and\r\nthe highest regard for the interests of society require that our laws\r\nbe so amended, that married women may be permitted to conduct business\r\non their own account; to acquire, hold, invest, and dispose of\r\nproperty in their own separate and individual right, subject to all\r\ncorresponding and appropriate obligations.\r\n\r\n7th. _Resolved_, That the clause of the Constitution of the State of\r\nOhio, which declares that \"all men have the right of acquiring and\r\npossessing property,\" is violated by the judicial doctrine that the\r\nlabor of the wife is the property of the husband.\r\n\r\n8th. _Resolved_, That in the general scantiness of compensation of\r\nwoman's labor, the restrictions imposed by custom and public opinion\r\nupon her choice of employments, and her opportunities of earning\r\nmoney, and the laws and social usages which regulate the distribution\r\nof property as between men and women, have produced a pecuniary\r\ndependence of woman upon man, widely and deeply injurious in many\r\nways; and not the least of all in too often perverting marriage, which\r\nshould be a holy relation growing out of spiritual affinities, into a\r\nmere bargain and sale--a means to woman of securing a subsistence and\r\na home, and to man of obtaining a kitchen drudge or a parlor ornament.\r\n\r\n9th. _Resolved_, That sacred and inestimable in value as are the\r\nrights which we assert for woman, their possession and exercise are\r\nnot the ultimate end we aim at; for rights are not ends, but only\r\nmeans to ends, implying duties, and are to be demanded in order that\r\nduties may be performed.\r\n\r\n10th. _Resolved_, That God, in constituting woman the mother of\r\nmankind, made her a living Providence, to produce, nourish, guard, and\r\ngovern His best and noblest work from helpless infancy to adult years.\r\nHaving endowed her with faculties ample, but no more than sufficient,\r\nfor the performance of her great work, He requires of her, as\r\nessentially necessary to its performance, the full development of\r\nthose faculties.\r\n\r\n11th. _Resolved_, That we do not charge woman's deprivation of her\r\nrights upon man alone, for woman also has contributed to this result;\r\nand as both have sinned together, we call on both to repent together,\r\nthat the wrong done by both may, by the united exertions of both, be\r\nundone.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH NATIONAL WOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION, CLEVELAND, OHIO, 1853.\r\n\r\n1st. _Resolved_, That by Human Rights, we mean natural Rights, in\r\ncontradistinction to conventional usages, and that because Woman is a\r\nHuman being, she, _therefore_, has Human Rights.\r\n\r\n2d. _Resolved_, because woman is a human being, and man is no more,\r\nshe has, by virtue of her constitutional nature, equal rights with\r\nman; and that state of society must necessarily be wrong which does\r\nnot, in its usages and institutions, afford equal opportunities for\r\nthe enjoyment and protection of these Rights.\r\n\r\n4th. _Resolved_, the common law, by giving the husband the custody of\r\nthe wife's person, does virtually place her on a level with criminals,\r\nlunatics, and fools, since these are the only classes of adult persons\r\nover which the law-makers have thought it necessary to place keepers.\r\n\r\n5th. _Resolved_, That if it be true, in the language of John C.\r\nCalhoun, that \"he who digs the money out of the soil, has a right to\r\nit against the universe,\" then the law which gives to the husband the\r\npower to use and control the earnings of the wife, makes robbery\r\nlegal, and is as mean as it is unjust.\r\n\r\n6th. _Resolved_, That woman will soonest free herself from the legal\r\ndisabilities she now suffers, by securing the right to the elective\r\nfranchise, thus becoming herself a lawmaker; and that to this end we\r\nwill petition our respective State Legislatures to call conventions to\r\namend their Constitutions, so that the right to the elective franchise\r\nshall not be limited by the word \"male.\"\r\n\r\n7th. _Resolved_, That there is neither justice nor sound policy in the\r\npresent arrangements of society, restricting women to so comparatively\r\na narrow range of employments; excluding them from those which are\r\nmost lucrative; and even in those to which they are admitted, awarding\r\nthem a compensation less, generally by one-half or two-thirds, than is\r\npaid to men for an equal amount of service rendered.\r\n\r\n8th. _Resolved_, That, although the question of the intellectual\r\nstrength and attainments of woman has nothing to do with the\r\nsettlement of their rights, yet in reply to the oft-repeated inquiry,\r\n\"Have women, by nature, the same force of intellect with men?\" we will\r\nreply, that this inquiry can never be answered till women shall have\r\nsuch training as shall give their physical and intellectual powers as\r\nfull opportunities for development, by being as heavily taxed and all\r\ntheir resources as fully called forth, as are now those of man.\r\n\r\nMr. Garrison, on being called for, replied that the resolutions would\r\ndo for his speech to-night, and read as follows:\r\n\r\n1st. _Resolved_, That the natural rights of one human being, are those\r\nof every other, in all cases equally sacred and inalienable; hence the\r\nboasted \"Rights of Man,\" about which we hear so much, are simply the\r\n\"Rights of Woman,\" of which we hear so little; or, in other words,\r\nthey are the Rights of Humanity, neither affected by, nor dependent\r\nupon, sex or condition.\r\n\r\n2d. _Resolved_, That those who deride the claims of woman to a full\r\nrecognition of her civil rights and political equality, exhibit the\r\nspirit which tyrants and usurpers have displayed in all ages toward\r\nthe mass of mankind; strike at the foundation of all truly free and\r\nequitable government; contend for a sexual aristocracy, which is as\r\nirrational and unjust in principle, as that of wealth and hereditary\r\ndescent, and show their appreciation of liberty to be wholly one-sided\r\nand supremely selfish.\r\n\r\n3d. _Resolved_, That for the men of this land to claim for themselves\r\nthe elective franchise, and the right to choose their own rulers and\r\nenact their own laws, as essential to their freedom, safety, and\r\nwelfare, and then to deprive all the women of all these safeguards,\r\nsolely on the ground of a difference of sex, is to evince the pride of\r\nself-esteem, the meanness of usurpation, and the folly of a\r\nself-assumed superiority.\r\n\r\n4th. _Resolved_, That woman, as well as man, has a right to the\r\nhighest mental and physical development; to the most ample educational\r\nadvantages; to the occupancy of whatever position she can reach, in\r\nChurch and State, in science and art, in poetry and music, in painting\r\nand sculpture, in civil jurisprudence and political economy, and in\r\nall the varied departments of human industry, enterprise, and skill;\r\nto the elective franchise, and to a voice in the administration of\r\njustice, and the passage of laws for the general welfare.\r\n\r\n5th. _Resolved_, That to pretend that the granting of these claims\r\nwould tend to make woman less amiable and attractive, less regardful\r\nof her peculiar duties and obligations as wife and mother, a wanderer\r\nfrom her proper sphere, bringing confusion into domestic life, and\r\nstrife into the public assembly, is the cant of Papal Rome as to the\r\ndiscordant and infidel tendencies of the right of private judgment in\r\nmatters of faith; is the outcry of legitimacy as to the incapacity of\r\nthe people to govern themselves; is the false allegations which\r\nselfish and timid conservatism is ever making against every new\r\nmeasure of reform, and has no foundation in reason, experience, fact,\r\nor philosophy.\r\n\r\n6th. _Resolved_, That the consequences arising from the exclusion of\r\nwoman from the possession and exercise of her natural rights and the\r\ncultivation of her mental faculties, have been calamitous to the whole\r\nhuman race; making her servile, dependent, unwomanly; the victim of a\r\nfalse gallantry on the one hand, and of tyrannous subjection on the\r\nother; obstructing her mental growth, crippling her physical\r\ndevelopment, and incapacitating her for general usefulness; and thus\r\ninflicting an injury upon all born of woman, and cultivating in man a\r\nlordly and arrogant spirit, a love of dominion, a disposition to\r\nlightly regard her comfort and happiness, all which have been indulged\r\nto a fearful extent, to the curse of his own soul and the desecration\r\nof her nature.\r\n\r\n7th. _Resolved_, That so long as the most ignorant, degraded, and\r\nworthless men are freely admitted to the ballot-box, and practically\r\nacknowledged to be competent to determine who shall be in office and\r\nhow the Government shall be administered, it is preposterous to\r\npretend that women are not qualified to use the elective franchise,\r\nand that they are fit only to be recognized, politically speaking, as\r\n_non compos mentis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nREBECCA M. SANFORD TO THE CLEVELAND CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n                         NEW LONDON, HURON CO., O., _October 3, 1853_.\r\n\r\nFRIENDS OF REFORM:--Not being present at the Convention, I can but\r\nexpress my interest by a few lines.\r\n\r\nThe mere question of woman's civil rights is not a deep one, for it is\r\na natural one, and closely follows her mission in this world. She was\r\nnot created anything else than a helpmeet to man, and where to limit\r\nthat assistance there is no rule in nature, except her physical\r\nfunctions; _there is a limit in law_, but whether the law has the\r\nright to place her where she is, is the question. It must be conceded\r\nthat the law has drawn too great an inference from her ancient social\r\nattitude, and from present custom and prejudice. But has the law the\r\nright to be prejudiced--ought it not to stand pure, and noble, and\r\nmagnanimous, founded on the natural rights of the human soul? The law\r\ngrants woman protection; it also grants negroes, animals, and property\r\nprotection in their certain spheres. It gives no more to woman.\r\n\r\nWoman's sphere is her capability of performing her duty to herself,\r\nher family, and to society, taking self-preservation as the first law\r\nof her nature. At present she does not fully act in her sphere. The\r\nlid of the ballot-box shuts out more than one-half of her duty to\r\nherself, family, and society. The eye of the law is diseased, and\r\nwoman must be made assistant occulist, to render that eye pure and\r\nsingle-sighted. Let not this Convention close until some way and means\r\nare decided upon to secure woman's vote at the polls. The propriety or\r\nimpropriety of the same place and box and other objections, can be\r\ndisposed of in a short time, as occasion requires.\r\n\r\nThis done, the monster evils of society, Intemperance, etc., can be\r\nhandled with ungloved hands.\r\n\r\nAt this time, as far as custom, made potent by law, permits woman to\r\nlead her sons on in the journey of life, she keeps them pure and\r\nunspotted from the world; but where she leaves off, hell's avenues are\r\nopened, and man too often leads them through.\r\n\r\nAllow me, as one who has been obliged to look upon our Conventions\r\nfrom many points of observation, and to note their effects upon the\r\ncommunity by actual communication with that community; as one who\r\nfeels identified in principle and purpose, to suggest perfect unity\r\nand but few resolutions, and those well-digested and fully acted upon.\r\nBeware of _ultraisms_. Give a high tone and elevation to your\r\ndeliberations; bring out the true, the beautiful, the divine of your\r\nown souls, to meet the true, the grand, the divine inspirations of\r\nthis agitation.\r\n\r\nOne thing else I would strongly recommend. Let no gentleman be\r\nappointed to office in the Convention, or by the Convention. You will\r\nthen secure yourselves from outside coarseness, and secure to\r\nyourselves greater respect from the public at large. If you do not\r\ncome to this _now_, you will be obliged to come to it before you\r\nreceive the credit for a _wisdom_ you justly deserve.\r\n\r\nMay God guide you and bless you.\r\n\r\n                                   Yours, strong in the right,\r\n                                               REBECCA M.

SPOFORD.\r\n\r\nPAULINA WRIGHT DAVIS.--_Dear Madam_:--I take the liberty of enclosing\r\nyou an extract from a long epistle I have just received from Helene\r\nMarie Weber. It speaks of matter interesting to us all, and I ask of\r\nyou the favor to submit it to the Convention. Miss Weber, as a\r\nliterary character, stands in the front rank of essayists in France.\r\nShe has labored zealously in behalf of her sex, as her numerous tracts\r\non subjects of reform bear testimony. No writer of the present age,\r\nperhaps, has done more to exalt woman than she has by her powerful\r\nessays. My personal knowledge of Miss Weber enables me to speak\r\nconfidently of her private character. It is utterly false that she is\r\na masculine woman. Her deportment is strictly lady-like, modest, and\r\nunassuming, and her name is beyond reproach. She is a Protestant of\r\nthe Lutheran order; exemplary in all her religious duties, and\r\nunaffectedly pious and benevolent.\r\n\r\nShe is, as you are doubtless aware, a practical agriculturist. The\r\nentire business of her farm is conducted by herself, and she has been\r\neminently successful. She has proved the capacity of woman for\r\nbusiness pursuits. Her success in this vocation is a practical\r\nargument worth a thousand theories. I find no difficulty with her\r\nbecause she dresses like a man. Her dress has not changed her nature.\r\nThose who censure her for abandoning the female dress, make up their\r\njudgment without proper reflection. She has violated no custom of her\r\nown country, and has merely acted according to the honest dictates of\r\nher mind--\"_Honi soit qui mal y pense._\"\r\n\r\nMiss Weber is now about twenty-five years of age. She is a ripe\r\nscholar, and has a perfect command of the English language. I am\r\ndecidedly of the opinion that her visit among us will do a vast deal\r\nof good to our cause, and we ought to give her a hearty welcome when\r\nshe comes. I can assure our most rigid friends that they will all be\r\nreconciled to her attire on five minutes' acquaintance....\r\n\r\n                         I remain, dear madam, yours sincerely,\r\n                                               MILDRED A. SPOFORD.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract from a Letter of_ H. M. WEBER.\r\n\r\n                                   LA PELOUSE, _August 8, 1850_.\r\n\r\n.... Circumstances place it out of my power to visit America during\r\nthe present season.... The newspapers, both of England and America,\r\nhave done me great injustice. While they have described my apparel\r\nwith the minute accuracy of professional tailors, they have seen fit\r\nto charge me with a disposition to undervalue the female sex, and to\r\nidentify myself with the other. Such calumnies are annoying to me. I\r\nhave never wished to be an Iphis--never for a moment affected to be\r\nanything but a woman. I do not think any one ever mistook me for a\r\nman, unless it may have been some stranger who slightly glanced at me\r\nwhile passing along the street or the highway. I adopted male attire\r\nas a measure of convenience in my business, and not through any wish\r\nto appear eccentric or to pass for one of the male sex; and it has\r\never been my rule to dress with the least possible ostentation\r\nconsistent with due neatness. I have never had cause to regret my\r\nadoption of male attire, and never expect to return to a female\r\ntoilette. I am fully aware, however, that my dress will probably\r\nprejudice the great body of our friends in America against me, while\r\npresent impressions on that subject exist; and it was with the view of\r\nallaying this feeling that I wished to address the assembly at\r\nWorcester.\r\n\r\nBy this means I think I could satisfy any liberal-minded person, of\r\neither sex, that there is no moral or political principle involved in\r\nthis question, and that a woman may, if she like, dress in male\r\nhabiliments without injury to herself or others.... Those who suppose\r\nthat woman can be \"the political, social, pecuniary, religious equal\r\nof man\" without conforming to his dress, deceive themselves, and\r\nmislead others who have no minds of their own. While the superiority\r\nof the male dress for all purposes of business and recreation is\r\nconceded, it is absurd to argue that we should not avail ourselves of\r\nits advantages.\r\n\r\nThere are no well-founded objections to women dressing, as we term it,\r\n_en cavalier_. The only two I ever heard are these: \"To do so is\r\ncontrary to law, both human and divine,\" and, \"The male dress is\r\n_outre_ and less graceful than our own.\" These objections may be\r\nanswered in a few words. The human statutes on this subject should be\r\nrepealed, as they surely will be in due time, or be regarded as they\r\nnow are in European States--as dead letters. The practice is not\r\ncontrary to divine law. The alleged prohibition, as contained in the\r\nfifth book of Moses, had reference to a religious custom of the\r\nAmorites, and was limited in its application to the children of\r\nIsrael, who had by Divine command dispossessed that pagan nation of\r\ntheir territory, and destroyed their temples of idolatrous worship.\r\n\r\nThe context will show two other prohibitions on this subject. In the\r\n11th and 12th verses of the same chapter (Deut, xxii.) it is forbidden\r\nto \"wear garments of divers sorts, as of woolen and linen together,\"\r\nand to wear fringes on the vesture. These prohibitions are all of the\r\nsame character, and had an obvious reference to the ceremonies used by\r\nthe pagans in their worship of idols. If one of these prohibitions be\r\nbinding upon nations of the present age, the others are not less so.\r\nTo the second objection, it may be said that beauty and grace in\r\nmatters of dress are determined by no rules, and if the fashion of\r\nmen's clothes be awkward it can easily be improved.\r\n\r\nWomen who prefer the gown should, of course, consult their own\r\npleasure by continuing to wear it; while those whose preference is a\r\nmale dress, ought not to be blamed for adopting it. I close this\r\nhomily by recording my prediction, that in ten years male attire will\r\nbe generally worn by the women of most civilized countries, and that\r\nit will precede the consummation of many great measures which are\r\ndeemed to be of paramount importance. I hope to visit America next\r\nyear. Thanks to the invention of steam, a voyage across the ocean is\r\nnow a mere _bagatelle_. I have not much of the spirit of travel\r\nremaining. My agricultural pursuits confine me at home nearly the\r\nwhole year, but my captivity is a delightful one.\r\n\r\n                                   Affectionately yours,\r\n                                                      H. M. WEBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry Channing, from the Business Committee, suggested a plan\r\nfor organization, and the principles which should govern the movement\r\nfor establishing woman's co-sovereignty with man, and reported the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That as women alone can learn by experience and prove by\r\nworks, what is their rightful sphere of duty, we recommend, as _next\r\nsteps_, that they should demand and secure:\r\n\r\n1st. _Education_ in primary and high-schools, universities, medical,\r\nlegal, and theological institutions, as comprehensive and exact as\r\ntheir abilities prompt them to seek and their capabilities fit them to\r\nreceive.\r\n\r\n2d. _Partnership_ in the labors, gains, risks, and remunerations of\r\nproductive industry, with such limits only as are assigned by taste,\r\nintuitive judgment, or their measure of spiritual and physical vigor,\r\nas tested by experiment.\r\n\r\n3d. A _co-equal share_ in the formation and administration of law,\r\nMunicipal, State, and National, through legislative assemblies,\r\ncourts, and executive offices.\r\n\r\n4th. _Such unions_ as may become the guardians of pure morals and\r\nhonorable manners--a high court of appeal in cases of outrage which\r\ncan not be, and are not touched by civil or ecclesiastical\r\norganizations, as at present existing, and a medium for expressing the\r\nhighest views of justice dictated by human conscience and sanctioned\r\nby holy inspiration.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That a Central Committee be appointed by this Convention,\r\nempowered to enlarge its numbers, on (1st) Education; (2d) Industrial\r\nAvocations; (3d) Civil and Political Rights and Regulations; (4th)\r\nSocial Relations; who shall correspond with each other and with the\r\nCentral Committee, hold meetings in their respective neighborhoods,\r\ngather statistics, facts, and incidents to illustrate, raise funds for\r\nthe movement; and through the press, tracts, books, and the living\r\nagent, guide public opinion upward and onward in the grand social\r\nreform of establishing woman's co-sovereignty with man.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the Central Committee be authorized to call\r\nConventions at such times and places as they see fit, and that they\r\nhold office until the next Annual Convention.\r\n\r\nTo carry out the plan suggested by Mr. Channing, the following\r\nCommittees were appointed:\r\n\r\nMEMBERS OF COMMITTEES.\r\n\r\n_Central Committee_.--Paulina W.

It is enough for our argument that natural and political\r\njustice, and the axioms of English and American liberty, alike\r\ndetermine that rights and burdens--taxation and representation--should\r\nbe co-extensive; hence women, as individual citizens, liable to\r\npunishment for acts which the laws call criminal, or to be taxed in\r\ntheir labor and property for the support of government, have a\r\nself-evident and indisputable right, identically the same right that\r\nmen have, to a direct voice in the enactment of those laws and the\r\nformation of that government.\r\n\r\n4. _Resolved_, That the democrat, or reformer, who denies suffrage to\r\nwomen, is a democrat only because he was not born a noble, and one of\r\nthose levelers who are willing to level only down to themselves.\r\n\r\n5. _Resolved_, That while political and natural justice accords civil\r\nequality to woman; while great thinkers of every age, from Plato to\r\nCondorcet and Mill, have supported their claim; while voluntary\r\nassociations, religious and secular, have been organized on this\r\nbasis, still, it is a favorite argument against it, that no political\r\ncommunity or nation ever existed in which women have not been in a\r\nstate of political inferiority. But, in reply, we remind our opponents\r\nthat the same fact has been alleged, with equal truth, in favor of\r\nslavery; has been urged against freedom of industry, freedom of\r\nconscience, and the freedom of the press; none of these liberties\r\nhaving been thought compatible with a well-ordered state, until they\r\nhad proved their possibility by springing into existence as facts.\r\nBesides, there is no difficulty in understanding why the subjection of\r\nwoman has been a _uniform custom_, when we recollect that we are just\r\nemerging from the ages in which _might_ has been always right.\r\n\r\n6. _Resolved_, That, so far from denying the overwhelming social and\r\ncivil influence of women, we are fully aware of its vast extent;\r\naware, with Demosthenes, that \"measures which the statesman has\r\nmeditated a whole year may be overturned in a day by a woman\"; and for\r\nthis very reason we proclaim it the very highest expediency to endow\r\nher with full civil rights, since only then will she exercise this\r\nmighty influence under a just sense of her duty and responsibility;\r\nthe history of all ages bearing witness, that the only safe course for\r\nnations is to add open responsibility wherever there already exists\r\nunobserved power.\r\n\r\n7. _Resolved_, That we deny the right of any portion of the species to\r\ndecide for another portion, or of any individual to decide for another\r\nindividual what is and what is not their \"proper sphere\"; that the\r\nproper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest to which\r\nthey are able to attain; what this is, can not be ascertained without\r\ncomplete liberty of choice; woman, therefore, ought to choose for\r\nherself what sphere she will fill, what education she will seek, and\r\nwhat employment she will follow, and not be held bound to accept, in\r\nsubmission, the rights, the education, and the sphere which man thinks\r\nproper to allow her.\r\n\r\n8. _Resolved_, That we hold these truths to be self-evident: That all\r\nmen are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with\r\ncertain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and\r\nthe pursuit of happiness; that, to secure these rights, governments\r\nare instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent\r\nof the governed; and we charge that man with gross dishonesty or\r\nignorance, who shall contend that \"men,\" in the memorable document\r\nfrom which we quote, does not stand for the human race; that \"life,\r\nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" are the \"inalienable rights\"\r\nof half only of the human species; and that, by \"the governed,\" whose\r\nconsent is affirmed to be the only source of just power, is meant that\r\n_half_ of mankind only who, in relation to the other, have hitherto\r\nassumed the character of _governors_.\r\n\r\n9. _Resolved_, That we see no weight in the argument that it is\r\n_necessary_ to exclude women from civil life because domestic cares\r\nand political engagements are incompatible; since we do not see the\r\nfact to be so in the case of men; and because, if the incompatibility\r\nbe real, it will take care of itself, neither men nor women needing\r\nany law to exclude them from an occupation when they have undertaken\r\nanother incompatible with it. Second, we see nothing in the assertion\r\nthat women, themselves, do not desire a change, since we assert that\r\nsuperstitious fears and dread of losing men's regard, smother all\r\nfrank expression on this point; and further, if it be their real wish\r\nto avoid civil life, laws to keep them out of it are absurd, no\r\nlegislator having ever yet thought it necessary to compel people by\r\nlaw to follow their own inclination.\r\n\r\n10. _Resolved_, That it is as absurd to deny all women their civil\r\nrights because the cares of household and family take up all the time\r\nof some, as it would be to exclude the whole male sex from Congress,\r\nbecause some men are sailors, or soldiers in active service or\r\nmerchants, whose business requires all their attention and energies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        GLEN HAVEN, _Feb. 18, 1853_.\r\n\r\nPAULINA WRIGHT DAVIS.--_My Dear Friend_:--Bless you for _The Una_, and\r\nfor sending me a copy. I am pleased with its appearance and with the\r\nheartiness of your correspondents. Would you find room for some of my\r\nlucubrations? If so, I will drive my quill a little for you some of\r\nthese evenings. Perhaps I might utter something readable.\r\n\r\nI do not ask you to send me _The Una_, for the dollar must go with the\r\nrequest, and the dollar has yet to be earned by _quill-work_, a task\r\nquite as hard as was work when a child at the _quill-wheel_, winding\r\nyarn from the reel.\r\n\r\nDrop me a line if you would like my assistance as a correspondent, and\r\nwhat I can do, I will cheerfully.\r\n\r\n                                   Very truly, your friend,\r\n                                             J.

HUNT TO THE MASSACHUSETTS CONSTITUTIONAL\r\nCONVENTION.\r\n\r\n_To the Constitutional Convention now sitting in Boston_:\r\n\r\nYour petitioner respectfully prays your honorable body to insert into\r\nthe Constitution a clause securing to females paying town, county, and\r\nStates taxes upon property held in their own right, and who have no\r\nhusbands or other guardians to represent and act for them, the same\r\nright of voting possessed by male tax-paying citizens; or, should your\r\nhonorable body not deem such females capable of exercising the right\r\nof suffrage with due discretion, at least excuse them from the paying\r\nof taxes, in the appropriation of which they have no voice, thus\r\ncarrying out the great principle on which the American Revolution was\r\nbased--that taxation and representation ought to go together. All of\r\nwhich your petitioner will ever pray.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAULINA WRIGHT DAVIS\r\n\r\nDied August 24, 1876, after two years of great suffering. A large\r\ncircle of friends gathered at her elegant residence near Providence,\r\nRhode Island, to pay their last tributes of friendship and respect.\r\nThe chief speaker on the occasion was, at her request, Elizabeth Cady\r\nStanton. She left her noble husband, Hon. Thomas Davis, and two\r\nadopted daughters, to mourn her loss. It was a soft, balmy day, just\r\nsuch as our friend would have chosen, when she was laid in her last\r\nresting-place. Dr. and Mrs. Channing, Theodore Tilton, and Joaquin\r\nMiller, were among those who followed in the funeral _cortège_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nINDIANA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dublin Convention, October, 1851._\r\n\r\nRESOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That all laws and customs having for their perpetuation\r\nthe only plea that they are time-honored, which in any way infringe on\r\nwoman's equal rights, cramp her energies, cripple her efforts, or\r\nplace her before the eyes of her family or the world as an inferior,\r\nare wrong, and should be immediately abolished.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the avenues to gain, in all their varieties, should\r\nbe as freely opened to woman as they now are to man.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the rising generation of boys and girls should be\r\neducated together in the same schools and colleges, and receive the\r\nsame kind and degree of education.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That woman should receive for equal labor, equal pay with\r\nman.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That as the qualification for citizenship in this country\r\nis based on capacity and morality, and as the sexes in their mental\r\ncondition are equal, therefore woman should enjoy the same rights of\r\ncitizenship with man.\r\n\r\nAn association was organized and a constitution was adopted, to which\r\nthe following names were appended: Amanda M.

SAXE not long since, in a poem, satirized literary women very\r\nkeenly, upon which Grace Greenwood wrote a severe criticism on his\r\nvolume, which was published in _The Evening Post_. Mr. Saxe, after\r\nseeing the criticism, wrote a note to the editor of the _Post_, in\r\nwhich he makes an exception in favor of Grace. This calls forth\r\nanother letter from her, from which we make the following extract:\r\n\r\n                                   NEW BRIGHTON, _Jan. 22, 1850_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN:--....At the time of my writing, I was feeling peculiarly\r\nsensitive in regard to my womanly, as well as literary position. The\r\ngrandpapaish lectures of Mr. Dana had troubled and discouraged me. I\r\nsaid, \"If so speak and write our poets, surely the age is on the\r\nbackward line of march.\" I had become impatient and indignant for my\r\nsex, thus lectured to, preached at, and satirized eternally. I had\r\ngrown weary of hearing woman told that her sole business here, the\r\nhighest, worthiest aims of her existence were to be loving, lovable,\r\nfeminine, to win thus a lover and a lord whom she might glorify abroad\r\nand make comfortable at home.\r\n\r\nWe have had enough of this. Man is not best qualified to mark out\r\nwoman's life-path. He knows, indeed, what he desires her to be, but he\r\ndoes not yet understand all that God and nature require of her. Woman\r\nshould not be made up of love alone, the other attributes of her being\r\nshould not be dwarfed that this may have a large, unnatural growth.\r\nHers should be a distinct individuality, an independent moral\r\nexistence--or, at least, the dependence should be mutual. Woman can\r\nbest judge of woman, her wants, capacities, aspirations, and powers.\r\nShe can best speak to her on the life of the affections, on the loves\r\nof her heart, on the peculiar joys and sorrows of her lot. She can\r\nbest teach her to be true to herself, to her high nature, to her brave\r\nspirit; and then, indeed, shall she be constant in her love and\r\nfaithful to her duties, all, even to the most humble. Woman can\r\nstrengthen woman for the life of self-sacrifice, of devotion, of\r\nministration, of much endurance which lies before her.\r\n\r\nA woman of intellect and right feeling would never dream of pointing\r\nout the weak and unfilial Desdemona as an example to her sex in this\r\nage; would never dare to hold up as \"our destined end and aim,\" a one\r\nlove, however romantic and poetical, which might be so selfishly\r\nsought and so unscrupulously secured.\r\n\r\nThank Heaven, woman herself is awaking to a perception of the causes\r\nwhich have hitherto impeded her free and perfect development, which\r\nhave shut her out from the large experiences, the wealth and fullness\r\nof the life to which she was called. She is beginning to feel, and to\r\ncast off the bonds which oppress her--many of them, indeed,\r\nself-imposed, and many gilded and rarely wrought, covered with flowers\r\nand delicate tissues, but none the less bonds--bonds upon the speech,\r\nupon the spirit, upon the life.\r\n\r\nThere surely is a great truth involved in this question of \"Woman's\r\nRights,\" and agitated as it may be, with wisdom and mildness, or with\r\nrashness and the bold, high spirit which shocks and startles at the\r\nfirst, good will come out of it eventually, great good, and the women\r\nof the next age will be the stronger and the freer, aye, and the\r\nhappier, for the few brave spirits who stood up fearlessly for\r\nunpopular truth against the world.\r\n\r\nI know that I expose myself to the charge of being unfeminine in\r\nfeeling, of ultraism. Well, better that than conservatism, though\r\nconservatism were safer and more respectable. Senselessness is always\r\nsafety, and a mummy is a thoroughly respectable personage.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Mr. Saxe. Our poet satirized rather keenly literary\r\nwomen, as a class, in the poem on which I remarked, but afterwards, in\r\nhis communication to the _Post_, most politely intimates that he\r\nexcepts me as one of the \"women of real talent.\" But I will not be\r\nexcepted. I stand in the ranks, liable to all the penalties of the\r\ncalling--exposed to the hot shot of satire and the stinging arrows of\r\nridicule. I will not be received as an exception, where full justice\r\nis not done to the class to which I belong.\r\n\r\nSuppose, now, that I should write a poem to deliver before some\r\n\"Woman's Rights Convention\" or \"Ladies' Literary Association,\" on \"The\r\nTimes,\" which should come down sharp and heavy on the literary men of\r\nthe day, for usurping the delicate employ by right and nature the\r\npeculiar province of woman, \"the weaker vessel\"; for neglecting their\r\nshops, their fields, their counting-houses, and their interesting\r\nfamilies, and wasting their precious time in writing love-tales,\r\n\"doleful ditties,\" and \"distressful strains,\" for the magazines; for\r\nflirting with the muse, while their wives are wanting shoes, or\r\nperpetrating puns, while their children cry for \"buns\"! Suppose that,\r\npointing every line with wit, I should hold them up to contempt as\r\ncareless, improvident lovers of pleasure, given to self-indulgence;\r\ntaking their Helicon more than dashed with gin; seekers after\r\nnotoriety, eccentric in their habits and unmanly in all their tastes!\r\nAfter this, should I very handsomely make an exception in favor of Mr.\r\nSaxe, would he feel complimented?\r\n\r\nAs far as I have known literary women, and as far as they have been\r\nmade known to us in literary biography, the unwomanly and unamiable,\r\nthe poor wives, and daughters, and sisters, have been the rare\r\nexceptions. I mean not alone \"women of genius,\" but would include\r\nthose of mere talent, of mediocre talent even, devoted to letters as a\r\nprofession, and who, by their estimable characters and blameless\r\nlives, are an honor to their calling.\r\n\r\nI believe that for one woman whom the pursuits of literature, the\r\nambition of authorship, and the love of fame have rendered unfit for\r\nhome-life, a thousand have been made thoroughly undomestic by poor\r\nsocial strivings, the follies of fashion, and the intoxicating\r\ndistinction which mere personal beauty confers.\r\n\r\n                                                  GRACE GREENWOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTCHESTER CONVENTION, JUNE 2 AND 3, 1852.\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM MARY MOTT.\r\n\r\n                    AUBURN, DE KALB COUNTY, INDIANA, _May 17, 1852_.\r\n\r\nSISTERS:--You have called another Convention, and all who are the\r\nfriends of equal rights are invited to attend and participate in the\r\ndeliberations. The invitation will probably meet the eye of thousands\r\nwho would gladly encourage you by their presence, did circumstances\r\npermit them to do so. Your aim is the moral, physical, and\r\nintellectual elevation of woman, and through her to benefit the whole\r\nhuman race. Can a Convention be called for a nobler purpose? Have men\r\never aimed so high? They have had Conventions without stint; old men\r\nand young men, Whigs, Democrats, Abolitionists, and Slaveholders, all\r\nhave had Conventions; but how few have aimed at anything higher than\r\npolitical power for themselves and party. We have looked upon their\r\ncontests without personal interest in their result. Some benefits\r\nmight come to our husbands and brothers, but none to us. We are\r\npermitted to talk about liberty, but we may not enjoy it. We may water\r\nthe tree with our tears, while our husbands pluck and enjoy the fruit.\r\nOf what advantage is it to us to live in a Republic? Our social\r\nposition is no better than it was in the days of Queen Elizabeth. Men\r\nhave made great progress since that day; from being subjects they have\r\nbecome sovereigns, ruling, as she professed to rule, by _divine\r\nright_. True, many of these sovereigns have not a foot of ground, and\r\nbut one subject, a wife; but then he has absolute control over that\r\none. Yes, they have made progress; but for that progress they are much\r\nindebted to men who, being in possession of power, were only anxious\r\nto retain and extend it. The Great Charter was extorted from King John\r\nby the barons in order to consolidate their power; they attended to\r\nthe interests of the common people (who then were in a state of\r\nvillanage) just so far as they could clearly see would be for their\r\nown interest, and no further. The world is much indebted to those\r\nsturdy barons; they did more good than they ever thought of doing.\r\nThere were germs in that charter that have borne excellent fruit since\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\nError delights in obscurity; surrounded with clouds and darkness, it\r\nis comparatively secure; but let these clouds be scattered, let the\r\nlight of reason fall upon it, and it is dangerous no longer. Any act\r\nthat causes men to think, is so far an advantage to society. The ideas\r\nwill not be lost. When King James I talked and wrote upon the doctrine\r\nof the divine right of kings, he little thought it would result in the\r\nbeheading of his son Charles, and the expulsion of his son James from\r\nthe throne. Shrouded in mystery, it was approached with reverence, and\r\nseldom critically examined, until he lifted the veil and invited\r\nothers to behold its beauty. What had been a mystery was a mystery no\r\nlonger. He forgot what others remembered--that it might have different\r\naspects for the sovereign and subject. It was judged unworthy of\r\nnational homage, but very desirable as a household god. And men who\r\nthought Paul was in the dark when he wrote, \"Let every soul be subject\r\nunto the higher powers, for there is no power but of God. The powers\r\nthat be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth the powers resisteth\r\nthe ordinance of God; and they that resist shall receive to themselves\r\ndamnation;\" the men, I say, who could not and would not receive such\r\ndoctrine from Paul, found him worthy of all praise when he said,\r\n\"wives, obey your husbands.\" After a while England proposed taxing the\r\nColonies. One party held that protection gave them the right of\r\ntaxation. The other said the British Constitution gave the Government\r\nno power to tax, unless the persons were represented in Parliament.\r\nThey declared their resolution to pay no taxes without representation.\r\nMuch was said about the rights of man. And when at last a three-penny\r\ntax was laid upon tea, the men, being brimful of patriotism, cared\r\nnothing for the tax; it was the principle they cared for, and they\r\nwould fight for their principles. How very sincere they were, let the\r\nmillions of wives answer, whose very existence is ignored in law.\r\nThere was one thing women gained by that contest; they gained a\r\nclearer knowledge of their rights, a better understanding of their\r\nwrongs, which, according to Blackstone, are a deprivation of rights. A\r\nknowledge of these has produced a strong desire to seek a remedy.\r\nHence the call for a Woman's Convention. We must expect some\r\ndifference of opinion as to the extent of the reforms proposed; but\r\nnone who have carefully examined the subject will see reason to doubt\r\nthat our rights run parallel with the rights of man. That being\r\ngranted, we may then inquire into their expediency. Many things we\r\nhave a right to do which are inexpedient; but it is for us to say what\r\nrights we will waive and what we will enjoy.\r\n\r\nWe claim that the professions should be open to woman, believing she\r\ncan preach as acceptably, study the law as thoroughly, and practice\r\nmedicine as successfully, as man. The business of a clerk seems to us\r\nto be peculiarly feminine, and we claim the right to choose any trade\r\nor business for which we have strength and capacity. If it is true\r\nthat governments derive their just powers from the consent of the\r\ngoverned, we would respectfully ask by what authority men legislate\r\nfor us, and who gave them that authority? If the power is a just one,\r\nfrom what source did they derive it? Certainly not from the consent of\r\nthe governed. We presume neither men nor women care for the privilege\r\nof voting, except as a means of securing the enjoyment of the rights\r\nwith which they have been endowed by their Creator, and for the\r\nprotection of which \"Governments were first instituted among men.\" The\r\nrights of women have been long in abeyance, but no lapse of time can\r\ndeprive her of them; they are not transferable. She does not ask the\r\nlaw to confer upon her new rights. She only asks to have her just\r\nrights recognized and protected. A glance at the present position of\r\nwomen will show that the law does not effect this. It places minors,\r\nidiots, insane persons, and married women in the same category. Man\r\ntakes all that the wife has to his own use, and such robberies are so\r\ncommon that they excite no indignation in the breasts of his\r\nfellow-men. He can spend all she has at the gaming-table, and who can\r\nhinder him? He can spend it in dissipation, while his deceived wife is\r\nsuffering at home for the necessaries of life. The law gives him the\r\nproperty, and with that he can usually find tools to work out his\r\ndesigns. The law interposes no barriers between him and his victim. If\r\na married woman had equal protection with her husband, she would be\r\nambitious to acquire property by her own industry, and the habit of\r\nindustry and forethought thus acquired, would be found valuable in\r\nthe marriage relation, and she would not be compelled to enter\r\nmatrimony as a house of refuge. But we are told that marriage is a\r\ncontract, voluntarily entered into by competent parties, and by this\r\ncontract the rights of the woman are transferred to the man. But\r\n_marriage is not a contract_, it is an union instituted by God\r\nHimself, anterior to any contract whatever. Man was not pronounced\r\ngood until woman was created, and God said, Let us make man in our\r\nimage after our own likeness, and let them _have dominion_. But some\r\none may meet us here with the question, did He not say to the woman,\r\nafter the fall, \"Thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule\r\nover thee?\" Yes, the Bible says so; and in the next chapter we are\r\ntold that Adam and Eve had two sons, the eldest called Cain, the\r\nyoungest Abel; and God said to Cain when speaking of Abel, \"Unto thee\r\nshall be his desire, and _thou shalt rule over him_.\" You see they are\r\nthe very words used to Eve; therefore, if dominion was taken from the\r\nwoman and given to the man, it was taken from all younger brothers and\r\ngiven to the first-born. If marriage be a contract, why is it not\r\ngoverned by the same rules that govern other contracts? A\r\nconsideration is necessary to the existence of a contract. In\r\nmarriage, the man offers love for love and hand for hand, but what is\r\nthe consideration for those personal rights of which he dispossesses\r\nher? If a contract, why is there no remedy for its violation either in\r\nlaw or equity, as is the case with other contracts? The bridegroom\r\nsays in the marriage service, \"With all my worldly goods I thee\r\nendow.\" Those who framed that impressive service no doubt considered\r\nit but just that he who received all by the courtesy of England,\r\nshould endow her as liberally, and they thus reminded every bridegroom\r\nof his duty, even before the altar; and what honest man will say he\r\nshould not keep his word?\r\n\r\n                                                  MARY MOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM DR. ELIZABETH BLACKWELL.\r\n\r\n                                        NEW YORK, _May 27, 1852_.\r\n\r\nMRS. DARLINGTON.--_Dear Madam_:---I thank you cordially for your very\r\nkind invitation, and would willingly attend your Convention did not my\r\nduties in New York prevent my leaving the city.\r\n\r\nThe Convention could not choose a more important subject than\r\neducation for discussion, and great good will be done if public\r\nattention is roused to the imperfection of our present system, in\r\nwhich the _physical nature_ and the _duties of life_ are equally\r\nneglected. I believe that the chief source of the false position of\r\nwomen is, the _inefficiency of women themselves_--the deplorable fact\r\nthat they are so often careless mothers, weak wives, poor\r\nhousekeepers, ignorant nurses, and frivolous human beings. If they\r\nwould perform with strength and wisdom the duties which lie\r\nimmediately around them, every sphere of life would soon be open to\r\nthem. They might be priests, physicians, rulers, welcome everywhere,\r\nfor all restrictive laws and foolish customs would speedily disappear\r\nbefore the spiritual power of strong, good women.\r\n\r\nIn order to develop such women, our present method of educating girls,\r\nwhich is an injurious waste of time, must be entirely remodeled, and I\r\nshall look forward with great interest to any plan of action that may\r\nbe suggested by your Convention.\r\n\r\nWith hearty sympathy in every aspiration, and the right hand of\r\nfellowship to every conscientious worker, believe me,\r\n\r\n                                   Very truly yours,\r\n                                              ELIZABETH BLACKWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM PAULINA WRIGHT DAVIS.\r\n\r\nIt is also often asked if women want more rights, why do they not take\r\nthem? Let us see how that may be. Does a woman desire a _thorough_\r\nmedical education, where is the institution fully and property endowed\r\nto receive her? Two women, it is true, have made their way through two\r\nseparate colleges, and when they had honorably won their diplomas, and\r\neven the voice of scandal could not cast a shadow upon them, they were\r\npublicly insulted by having the doors of those institutions closed\r\nupon all others of their sex. If she desires a course of thorough\r\ndisciplinary study for any purpose whatsoever, where is she to find\r\nmeans or the institution to receive her? The academic shades are\r\nforbidden ground to her, while their massive doors turn with no harsh\r\ngrating sound at the magic word of man for man. If we did not feel\r\ntoo deeply the injustice of this, we might comfort ourselves with the\r\nidea that our brains are so superior that we do not need the same\r\namount of study and discipline as the other sex....\r\n\r\nWhen Socrates was advocating the equal education of women for\r\ngovernmental offices, he was met by ridicule. His words in\r\nconsideration of it are full of wisdom. Says the sage, \"The man who\r\nlaughs at women going through their exercises, reaps the unripe fruit\r\nof a ridiculous wisdom, and seems not rightly to know at what he\r\nlaughs, or why he does it, for that ever was and will be deemed a\r\nnoble saying, that the profitable is beautiful and the hurtful\r\nbase.\"....\r\n\r\nThe harmony, unity, and oneness of the race, can not be secured while\r\nthere is class legislation; while one half of humanity is cramped\r\nwithin a narrow sphere and governed by arbitrary power. This\r\nunrecognized half desires these factitious restraints removed, and to\r\nbe placed side by side with the other, simply that there may be full,\r\nfree, and equal development in the future. The moral life which urges\r\nthis claim is the God within us. The force which opposes it, it\r\nmatters not whence it comes, \"is of the earth, earthy.\"....\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM WM. H. AND MARY JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nThe influence of woman as a wife and a mother has been so often\r\nportrayed, that it would be difficult to find a moral writer who has\r\nnot indulged in the fruitful theme, but we can not omit the occasion\r\nof quoting the sentiments of the eloquent Wm. Wirt on this subject:\r\n\"Is not _our_ conduct toward this sex ill-advised and foolish in\r\nrelation to our own happiness? Is it not to reject a boon which\r\nProvidence kindly offers to us, and which, were we to embrace and\r\ncultivate it with skill, would refine and enlarge the sources of our\r\nown enjoyment, and purify, raise, and ennoble our own character beyond\r\nthe power of human calculation?\r\n\r\n\"As the companion of a man of sense and virtue, as an instrument and\r\npartner of his earthly happiness, what is the most beautiful woman in\r\nthe world without a mind--without a cultivated mind, capable of an\r\nanimated correspondence with his own, and of reciprocating all his\r\nthoughts and feelings?\r\n\r\nIs not our conduct on this head ungenerous and ignoble to the other\r\nsex? Do we not deprive them of the brightest and most angelic portion\r\nof their character, degrade them from the rank of intelligence which\r\nthey are formed to hold; and instead of making them the partners of\r\nour souls, attempt to debase them into mere objects of sense?\r\n\r\n\"Is not our conduct mean and dastardly? Does it not look as if we were\r\nafraid that, with equal opportunities, they would rival us in\r\nintelligence, and examine and refute our pretended superiority?\"\r\n\r\nWe congratulate the Convention on the selection of the place for\r\nholding their deliberations. In no part of the State could a community\r\nbe found better qualified to appreciate the objects of such a meeting,\r\nor the means for their accomplishment. Chester has undoubtedly taken\r\nthe lead of all her sister counties in educational movements, as may\r\nbe witnessed in her numerous flourishing schools for both sexes, which\r\nare attracting, as to a common focus, pupils from all parts of the\r\ncountry. And it affords us unmingled pleasure to observe the numerous\r\nfemale schools that have been established in this quarter, and the\r\npatronage that has been extended toward them. These are sure\r\nindications of an improved public sentiment in relation to the\r\ndevelopment of the female mind.\r\n\r\nBut there are other indications of advancement in this particular\r\nstill more encouraging, because they exhibit fruits of the most\r\nennobling powers of the human understanding. We allude to those\r\nbenevolent associations particularly for promoting temperance, in\r\nwhich the females of Chester County have borne such a conspicuous and\r\neffective part. The reflection is, indeed, animating, that at a period\r\nwhen almost all kindred associations in the State, among the other\r\nsex, had languished, and intemperance seemed likely once more to\r\noverwhelm the land with more desolating evils than had ever yet been\r\nknown, there was yet to be found in Chester County an association of\r\nfemales who were nobly bearing the standard of total abstinence, and\r\nby their well-timed labors giving evidence that there was yet vitality\r\nin the cause! Thus we have seen not only in this, but in other fields\r\nof moral reform, that the progress has uniformly been commensurate\r\nwith the intellectual and moral culture of the female mind. Let the\r\nsex, then, give their influence in promoting a system of education\r\nthat will, if carried out, secure to every woman in the land the\r\nblessings of thorough practical instruction. May the deliberations of\r\nthe Convention tend to the promotion of this most desirable object.\r\nWith such developments as must result from the more general diffusion\r\nof knowledge, not only rights, but duties that have been hidden by the\r\nsuggestions of ignorance and bigotry will be brought to light, and the\r\nsex will realize the noble sentiment of one of New England's gifted\r\nsons, that\r\n\r\n    \"New occasions teach new duties--Time makes ancient good uncouth,\r\n    They must upward still and onward, who would keep abreast of Truth!\"\r\n\r\nDesiring that your discussions may be guided by that spirit which has\r\nheretofore characterized them, we remain your friends,\r\n\r\n                                   WM. H. JOHNSON AND MARY JOHNSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESOLUTIONS OF THE WESTCHESTER CONVENTION, 1852.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That every party which claims to represent the humanity,\r\nthe civilization, or the progress of the age, is bound to inscribe on\r\nits banner, \"Equality before the laws, without distinction of sex.\"\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the science of government is not necessarily\r\nconnected with the violence and intrigue which are now frequently\r\npractised by party politicians, neither does the exercise of the\r\nelective franchise, or the _PROPER_ discharge of governmental duties\r\nnecessarily involve the sacrifice of the refinement or sensibilities\r\nof true womanhood.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That in demanding for women that equal station among their\r\nbrethren to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them,\r\nwe do not urge the claim in the spirit of an adverse policy, or with\r\nany idea of separate advantages, or in any apprehension of conflicting\r\ninterests between the sexes.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That while we regret the antagonism into which we are\r\nnecessarily brought to some of the laws, customs, and monopolies of\r\nsociety, we have cause to rejoice that the exposure of the great\r\nwrongs of woman has been so promptly met by a kind spirit, and a\r\ndisposition to redress these wrongs, to open avenues for her\r\nelevation, and to co-operate for her entire enfranchisement.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the greatest and most varied development of the human\r\nmind, and the widest sphere of usefulness, can be obtained only by the\r\nhighest intellectual culture of the whole people, and that all\r\nobstructions should be removed which tend to prevent women from\r\nentering, as freely as men, upon the study of the physical, mental,\r\nand moral sciences.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we can not appreciate the justice or generosity of\r\nthe laws which require women to pay taxes, and thus enable legislators\r\nrichly to endow colleges and universities for their own sex, from\r\nwhich the female sex is entirely excluded.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the growing liberality of legislation and judicial\r\nconstruction, in regard to the property rights of married women,\r\naffords gratifying evidence of the equity of our demands and of their\r\nprogress in public sentiment.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the disposition of property by law as affecting\r\nmarried parties, ought to be the same for the husband and the wife,\r\n\"that she should have, during life, an equal control over the property\r\ngained by their mutual toil and sacrifices; and be heir to her\r\nhusband, precisely to the extent that he is heir to her.\"\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the mother being as much the natural guardian of the\r\nchild as the father, ought so to be recognized in law, and if it is\r\njustly the province of the court to appoint guardians for minors, want\r\nof qualification in the surviving parent should be the required\r\ncondition of the appointment.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the inequality of the remuneration paid for woman's\r\nlabor compared with that of man, is unjust and degrading, for so long\r\nas custom awards to her smaller compensation for services of equal\r\nvalue, she will be held in a state of dependence, not by any order of\r\nnature, but by an arbitrary rule of man.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the distinctive traits of female character, like its\r\ndistinct physical organism, having its foundation in nature, the\r\nwidest range of thought and action, and the highest cultivation and\r\ndevelopment of all its varied powers, will only make more apparent\r\nthose sensibilities and graces which are considered its peculiar\r\ncharm.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That in claiming for woman all the rights of human beings\r\nwe are but asserting her humanity, leaving the differences actually\r\nexisting in the male and female constitutions to take care of\r\nthemselves, these differences furnishing no reason for subjecting one\r\nsex to the other.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That a Committee be appointed to prepare and circulate\r\npetitions, asking of our Legislature such a change in the Constitution\r\nand laws of this State, as shall extend to woman the privilege of the\r\nelective franchise, and equality in the division and inheritance of\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That said Committee be instructed to collect information\r\nupon the rights acknowledged and privileges guaranteed to women by\r\nother States and Governments, publishing it in such way as by them\r\nshall be deemed best for promoting political and legal equality\r\nbetween the sexes.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That H. M. Darlington, P. E. Gibbons, Hannah Wright, Mary\r\nAnn Fulton, Sarah E.

It was unanimously adopted.\r\n\r\nThe Convention adjourned _sine die_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH NATIONAL W. R. CONVENTION, PHILADELPHIA, OCTOBER 18, 19, 20,\r\n1854.\r\n\r\nRESOLUTIONS.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we congratulate the true friends of woman upon the\r\nrapid progress which her cause has made during the year past, in spite\r\nof the hostility of the bad and the prejudices of the good.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That woman's aspiration is to be the only limit of woman's\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That so long as woman is debarred from an equal education,\r\nrestricted in her employments, denied the right of independent\r\nproperty if married, and denied in all cases the right of controlling\r\nthe legislation which she is nevertheless bound to obey, so long must\r\nthe woman's rights agitation be continued.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That in perfect confidence that what we desire will one\r\nday be accomplished, we commit the cause of woman to God and to\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That in demanding the educational rights of woman, we do\r\nnot deny the natural distinctions of sex, but only wish to develop\r\nthem fully and harmoniously.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That in demanding the industrial rights of woman, we only\r\nclaim that she should have \"a fair day's wages for a fair day's work,\"\r\nwhich is, however, impossible while she is restricted to few ill-paid\r\navocations, and unable (if married) to control her own earnings.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That in demanding the political rights of woman, we simply\r\nassert the fundamental principle of democracy--that taxation and\r\nrepresentation should go together, and that, if this principle is\r\ndenied, all our institutions must fall with it.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That our present democracy is an absurdity, since it\r\ndeprives woman even of the political power which is allowed to her in\r\nEurope, and abolishes all other aristocracy only to establish a new\r\naristocracy of sex, which includes _all_ men and excludes all women.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That it is because we recognize the beauty and sacredness\r\nof the family, that we demand for woman an equal position there,\r\ninstead of her losing, as now, the control of her own property, the\r\ncustody of her own children, and, finally, her own legal existence,\r\nunder laws which have all been pronounced by jurists \"a disgrace to a\r\nheathen nation.\"\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we urge it upon the women of every American State:\r\nFirst, to petition the legislatures for universal suffrage and a\r\nreform in the rights of property; second, to use their utmost efforts\r\nto improve female education; third, to open as rapidly as possible new\r\nchannels for female industry.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tracy Cutler made an address upon the objects of the movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nLUCRETIA MOTT'S FUNERAL.\r\n\r\nLueretia Mott died at her quiet home, \"Roadside,\" near Philadelphia,\r\nNov. 11, 1880. Notwithstanding the Associated Press dispatch said,\r\n\"Funeral strictly private by special request,\" the attendance on that\r\noccasion was large. _The Philadelphia Times_ thus describes it: The\r\nfuneral of Lucretia Mott, attended by an immense concourse of people,\r\nat her residence as well as in the cemetery, was an impressive scene\r\nnot soon to be forgotten. A handsome stone house, standing in\r\ntastefully laid out and carefully kept grounds studded with forest\r\ntrees, just west of the old fork road in Cheltenham township,\r\nMontgomery County, was the home of Lucretia Mott. On this occasion the\r\nroad and grounds were densely packed with carriages, people on\r\nhorseback and on foot, coming from many miles about to pay their last\r\ntributes of respect to this noble woman.\r\n\r\nThe funeral was conducted according to the custom of the Society of\r\nFriends, and was in all its appointments simple and unostentatious, in\r\nkeeping with the character of the noble woman who had passed away. No\r\nset forms were observed.\r\n\r\nThe body, in her usual Quaker costume, lay in a room adjoining the\r\nlibrary, in a plain, unpolished walnut coffin, padded and lined with\r\nsome white material, but without any ornamentation whatever. There\r\nwere no flowers and no uttered demonstrations of grief, but a profound\r\nsadness seemed to pervade the house, and for half an hour no sound was\r\nheard in the densely thronged rooms save the muffled tread over the\r\nthick carpets of fresh arrivals and the whispered directions of a\r\nservant, pointing the way to the room where a last look at the dead\r\nmight be had.\r\n\r\nAt half-past 12 o'clock Deborah Wharton arose from her seat in the\r\nparlor, and made a brief but touching address on the life and\r\ncharacter of the deceased. She began by a quotation from the Bible:\r\n\"This day a mighty prince has fallen in Israel.\" She then contrasted\r\nthe condition in life of Lucretia Mott and that of a prince, and\r\nshowed how she had accomplished more for humanity than the most\r\npowerful princes, but without noise and tumult and the shedding of\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nDr. Furness paid a beautiful tribute to the dead. He quoted the\r\nbeatitudes from the the fifth chapter of Matthew, and applied them to\r\nher. \"We are accustomed,\" he said, \"to speak of the dead as having\r\ngone to their reward, but Lucretia Mott had her reward here, and she\r\nshall have it hereafter a hundred fold.\" Dr. Furness closed with an\r\neloquent prayer that the example of the beautiful life ended upon\r\nearth might not be lost upon the living.\r\n\r\nPhoebe Couzins paid a tender and loving tribute that touched every\r\nheart. Then loving hands took up the little coffin--it looked hardly\r\nlarger than a child's--and bore it to the gravelled drive in front of\r\nthe house. The route was down York road to Fairhill, the Friends'\r\ncemetery, at Germantown Avenue and Cambria Street, in this city, which\r\nwas reached about three o'clock. Here several hundred people were\r\nalready gathered to witness the interment. Fairhill is a little\r\ncemetery, about the size of a city square. It is mound-shaped, sloping\r\nup from all sides to the center. It is filled with trees and\r\nshrubbery, but does not contain a single monument, the graves being\r\nsimply marked with little marble blocks, which do not rise more than\r\nsix inches above the ground. In the highest part of the grounds was\r\nthe open grave, by the side of the husband, James Mott, who was buried\r\nabout twelve years ago. Above the grave spread the branches of an\r\naspen tree, and near it is a weeping willow. While thousands stood\r\nabout, the coffin was reverently, solemnly, and silently lowered. The\r\ngrave was then filled up, the friends turned away, and slowly the\r\ncemetery was deserted.\r\n\r\nMemorial services were held the same day and hour by Liberal Germans\r\nin Milwaukie, Wisconsin, and by the City Suffrage Association in New\r\nYork. Dr. Clement Lozier, president of the society, presided. Charles\r\nG. Ames, of Philadelphia; Frederick Hinckley, of Providence; Robert\r\nCollyer, of New York, gave memorial sermons in their respective\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nMRS. STANTON'S REMINISCENCES.\r\n\r\n                                        PETERBORO, _December 1, 1855_.\r\n\r\nELIZABETH C. STANTON.--_My Dear Friend_:--The \"Woman's Rights\r\nMovement\" has deeply interested your generous heart, and you have ever\r\nbeen ready to serve it with your vigorous understanding. It is,\r\ntherefore, at the risk of appearing somewhat unkind and uncivil, that\r\nI give my honest answer to your question. You would know why I have so\r\nlittle faith in this movement. I reply, that it is not in the proper\r\nhands; and that the proper hands are not yet to be found. The present\r\nage, although in advance, of any former age, is, nevertheless, very\r\nfar from being sufficiently under the sway of reason to take up the\r\ncause of woman, and carry it forward to success. A much stronger and\r\nmuch more widely diffused common sense than has characterized any of\r\nthe generations, must play its mightiest artillery upon the stupendous\r\npiles of nonsense, which tradition and chivalry and a misinterpreted\r\nand superstitious Christianity have reared in the way of this cause,\r\nere woman can have the prospect of the recognition of her rights and\r\nof her confessed equality with man.\r\n\r\nThe object of the \"Woman's Rights Movement\" is nothing less than to\r\nrecover the rights of woman--nothing less than to achieve her\r\nindependence. She is now the dependent of man; and, instead of rights,\r\nshe has but privileges--the mere concessions (always revocable and\r\nalways uncertain) of the other sex to her sex. I say nothing against\r\nthis object. It is as proper as it is great; and until it is realized,\r\nwoman can not be half herself, nor can man be half himself. I rejoice\r\nin this object; and my sorrow is, that they, who are intent upon it,\r\nare not capable of adjusting themselves to it--not high-souled enough\r\nto consent to those changes and sacrifices in themselves, in their\r\npositions and relations, essential to the attainment of this vital\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nWhat if a nation in the heart of Europe were to adopt, and uniformly\r\nadhere to, the practice of cutting off one of the hands of all their\r\nnew-born children? It would from this cause be reduced to poverty, to\r\nhelpless dependence upon the charity of surrounding nations, and to\r\njust such a measure of privileges as they might see fit to allow it,\r\nin exchange for its forfeited rights. Very great, indeed, would be the\r\nfolly of this strange nation. But a still greater folly would it be\r\nguilty of, should it, notwithstanding this voluntary mutilation, claim\r\nall the wealth, and all the rights, and all the respect, and all the\r\nindependence which it enjoyed before it entered upon this systematic\r\nmutilation.\r\n\r\nNow, this twofold folly of this one-hand nation illustrates the\r\nsimilar twofold folly of some women. Voluntarily wearing, in common\r\nwith their sex, a dress which imprisons and cripples them, they,\r\nnevertheless, follow up this absurdity with the greater one of\r\ncoveting and demanding a social position no less full of admitted\r\nrights, and a relation to the other sex no less full of independence,\r\nthan such position and relation would naturally and necessarily have\r\nbeen, had they scorned a dress which leaves them less than half their\r\npersonal power of self-subsistence and usefulness. I admit that the\r\nmass of women are not chargeable with this latter absurdity of\r\ncherishing aspirations and urging claims so wholly and so glaringly at\r\nwar with this voluntary imprisonment and this self-degradation. They\r\nare content in their helplessness and poverty and destitution of\r\nrights. Nay, they are so deeply deluded as to believe that all this\r\nbelongs to their natural and unavoidable lot. But the handful of women\r\nof whom I am here complaining--the woman's rights women--persevere\r\njust as blindly and stubbornly as do other women, in wearing a dress\r\nthat both marks and makes their impotence, and yet, O amazing\r\ninconsistency! they are ashamed of their dependence, and remonstrate\r\nagainst its injustice. They claim that the fullest measure of rights\r\nand independence and dignity shall be accorded to them, and yet they\r\nrefuse to place themselves in circumstances corresponding with their\r\nclaim. They demand as much for themselves as is acknowledged to be\r\ndue to men, and yet they refuse to pay the necessary, the\r\nnever-to-be-avoided price of what they demand--the price which men\r\nhave to pay for it.\r\n\r\nI admit that the dress of woman is not the primal cause of her\r\nhelplessness and degradation. That cause is to be found in the false\r\ndoctrines and sentiments of which the dress is the outgrowth and\r\nsymbol. On the other hand, however, these doctrines and sentiments\r\nwould never have become the huge bundle they now are, and they would\r\nprobably have all languished, and perhaps all expired, but for the\r\ndress. For, as in many other instances, so in this, and emphatically\r\nso in this, the cause is made more efficient by the reflex influence\r\nof the effect. Let woman give up the irrational modes of clothing her\r\nperson, and these doctrines and sentiments would be deprived of their\r\nmost vital aliment by being deprived of their most natural expression.\r\nIn no other practical forms of folly to which they might betake\r\nthemselves, could they operate so vigorously and be so invigorated by\r\ntheir operation.\r\n\r\nWere woman to throw off the dress, which, in the eye of chivalry and\r\ngallantry, is so well adapted to womanly gracefulness and womanly\r\nhelplessness, and to put on a dress that would leave her free to work\r\nher own way through the world, I see not but that chivalry and\r\ngallantry would nearly or quite die out. No longer would she present\r\nherself to man, now in the bewitching character of a plaything, a\r\ndoll, an idol, and now in the degraded character of his servant. But\r\nhe would confess her transmutation into his equal; and, therefore, all\r\noccasion for the display of chivalry and gallantry toward her on the\r\none hand, and tyranny on the other, would have passed away. Only let\r\nwoman attire her person fitly for the whole battle of life--that great\r\nand often rough battle, which she is as much bound to fight as man is,\r\nand the common sense expressed in the change will put to flight all\r\nthe nonsensical fancies about her superiority to man, and all the\r\nnonsensical fancies about her inferiority to him. No more will then be\r\nheard of her being made of a finer material than man is made of; and,\r\non the contrary, no more will then be heard of her being but the\r\ncomplement of man, and of its taking both a man and a woman (the\r\nwoman, of course, but a small part of it) to make up a unit. No more\r\nwill it then be said that there is sex in mind--an original sexual\r\ndifference in intellect. What a pity that so many of our noblest women\r\nmake this foolish admission! It is made by the great majority of the\r\nwomen who plead the cause of woman.\r\n\r\nI am amazed that, the intelligent women engaged in the \"Woman's Rights\r\nMovement,\" see not the relation between their dress and the oppressive\r\nevils which they are striving to throw off. I am amazed that they do\r\nnot see that their dress is indispensable to keep in countenance the\r\npolicy and purposes out of which those evils grow. I hazard nothing in\r\nsaying, that the relation between the dress and degradation of an\r\nAmerican woman, is as vital as between the cramped foot and\r\ndegradation of a Chinese woman; as vital as between the uses of the\r\ninmate of the harem and the apparel and training provided for her.\r\nMoreover, I hazard nothing in saying, that an American woman will\r\nnever have made her most effectual, nor, indeed, any serviceable\r\nprotest against the treatment of her sex in China, or by the lords of\r\nthe harem, so long as she consents to have her own person clothed in\r\nways so repugnant to reason and religion, and grateful only to a\r\nvitiated taste, be it in her own or in the other sex.\r\n\r\nWomen are holding their meetings; and with great ability do they urge\r\ntheir claim to the rights of property and suffrage. But, as in the\r\ncase of the colored man, the great needed change is in himself, so,\r\nalso, in the case of woman, the great needed change is in herself. Of\r\nwhat comparative avail would be her exercise of the right of suffrage,\r\nif she is still to remain the victim of her present false notions of\r\nherself and of her relations to the other sex?--false notions so\r\nemphatically represented and perpetuated by her dress? Moreover, to\r\nconcede to her the rights of property would be to benefit her\r\ncomparatively little, unless she shall resolve to break out from her\r\nclothes-prison, and to undertake right earnestly, as right earnestly\r\nas a man, to get property. Solomon says: \"The destruction of the poor\r\nis their poverty.\" The adage that knowledge is power, is often\r\nrepeated; and there are, indeed, many instances to verify it.\r\nNevertheless, as a general proposition, it is a thousandfold more\r\nemphatically true that property is power. Knowledge helps to get\r\nproperty, but property is the power. That the slaves are a helpless\r\nprey, is chiefly because they are so poor and their masters so rich.\r\nThe masses almost everywhere are well-nigh powerless, because almost\r\neverywhere they are poor. How long will they consent to be poor? Just\r\nso long as they shall consent to be robbed of their God-given right\r\nto the soil. That women are helpless is no wonder, so long as women\r\nare paupers.\r\n\r\nAs long as woman shall be silly enough to learn her lessons in the\r\nschools of gallantry and chivalry, so long will it be the height of\r\nher ambition to be a graceful and amiable burden upon the other sex.\r\nBut as soon as she shall consent to place herself under the\r\ninstructions of reason and common sense, and to discard, as wholly\r\nimaginary, those differences between the nature of man and the nature\r\nof woman, out of which have grown innumerable nonsensical doctrines\r\nand notions, and all sorts of namby pamby sentiments, so soon will she\r\nfind that, to no greater extent than men are dependent on each other,\r\nare women to foster the idea of their dependence on men. Then, and not\r\ntill then, will women learn that, to be useful and happy, and to\r\naccomplish the high purposes of their being, they must, no less\r\nemphatically than men, stand upon their own feet, and work with own\r\nhands, and bear the burdens of life with their own strength, and brave\r\nits storms with their own resoluteness.\r\n\r\nThe next \"Woman's Rights Convention\" will, I take it for granted,\r\ndiffer but little from its predecessors. It will abound in righteous\r\ndemands and noble sentiments, but not in the evidence that they who\r\nenunciate these demands and sentiments are prepared to put themselves\r\nin harmony with what they conceive and demand. In a word, for the lack\r\nof such preparation and of the deep earnestness, which alone can\r\nprompt to such preparation, it will be, as has been every other\r\nWoman's Rights Convention, a failure. Could I see it made up of women\r\nwhose dress would indicate their translation from cowardice to\r\ncourage; from slavery to freedom; from the kingdom of fancy and\r\nfashion and foolery to the kingdom of reason and righteousness, then\r\nwould I hope for the elevation of woman, aye, and of man too, as\r\nperhaps I have never yet hoped. What should be the parts and\r\nparticulars of such dress, I am incapable of saying. Whilst the\r\n\"Bloomer dress\" is unspeakably better than the common dress, it\r\nnevertheless affords not half that freedom of the person which woman\r\nis entitled and bound to enjoy. I add, on this point, that however\r\nmuch the dresses of the sexes should resemble each other, decency and\r\nvirtue and other considerations require that they should be obviously\r\ndistinguishable from each other.\r\n\r\nI am not unaware that such views as I have expressed in this letter\r\nwill be regarded as serving to break down the characteristic delicacy\r\nof woman. I frankly admit that I would have it broken down; and that I\r\nwould have the artificial and conventional, the nonsensical and\r\npernicious thing give place to the natural delicacy which would be\r\ncommon to both sexes. As the delicacy, which is made peculiar to one\r\nof the sexes, is unnatural, and, therefore, false, this, which would\r\nbe common to both, would be natural, and, therefore, true. I would\r\nhave no characteristic delicacy of woman, and no characteristic\r\ncoarseness of man. On the contrary, believing man and woman to have\r\nthe same nature, and to be therefore under obligation to have the same\r\ncharacter, I would subject them to a common standard of morals and\r\nmanners. The delicacy of man should be no less shrinking than that of\r\nwoman, and the bravery of woman should be one with the bravery of man.\r\nThen would there be a public sentiment very unlike that which now\r\nrequires the sexes to differ in character, and which, therefore, holds\r\nthem amenable to different codes--codes that, in their partiality to\r\nman, allow him to commit high crimes, and that, in their cruelty to\r\nwoman, make the bare suspicion of such crimes on her part the\r\njustification of her hopeless degradation and ruin.\r\n\r\nThey who advocate that radical change in her dress which common sense\r\ncalls for, are infidels in the eyes of such as subscribe to this\r\ninterpretation of the Bible. For if the Bible teaches that the\r\nHeaven-ordained condition of woman is so subordinate and her\r\nHeaven-ordained character so mean, then they are infidels who would\r\nhave her cast aside a dress so becoming that character and condition,\r\nand have her put on a dress so entirely at war with her humble nature,\r\nas to indicate her conscious equality with man, and her purpose to\r\nassert, achieve, and maintain her independence. Alas, how\r\nmisapprehended are the true objects and true uses of the Bible! That\r\nblessed book is given to us, not so much that we may be taught by it\r\nwhat to do, as that we may be urged by its solemn and fearful commands\r\nand won by its melting entreaties, to do what we already know we\r\nshould do. Such, indeed, is the greatest value of its recorded fact\r\nthat Jesus Christ died to save us from our sins. We already know that\r\nwe should repent of our sins and put them away; and it is this fact\r\nwhich furnishes our strongest possible motive for doing so. But men\r\nrun to the Bible professedly to be taught their duty in matters where\r\ntheir very instincts--where the laws, written in large, unmistakable,\r\nineffaceable letters upon the very foundations of their being--teach\r\nthem their duty. I say _professedly_, for generally it is only so.\r\nThey run to the Bible, not to learn the truth, but to make the Bible\r\nthe minister to folly and sin. They run from themselves to the Bible,\r\nbecause they can more easily succeed in twisting its records into the\r\nservice of their guilty passions and guilty purposes than they can\r\ntheir inflexible convictions. They run to the Bible for a paramount\r\nauthority that shall override and supplant these uncomfortable\r\nconvictions. They run from the teachings of their nature and the\r\nremonstrances of their consciences to find something more palatable.\r\nHence, we find the rum-drinker, and slaveholder, and polygamist, and\r\nother criminals going to the Bible. They go to it for the very purpose\r\nof justifying their known sins. But not only may we not go to the\r\nBible to justify what we ourselves have already condemned, but we must\r\nnot take to the judicature of that book, as an open question, any of\r\nthe wrongs against which nature and common sense cry out--any of the\r\nwrongs which nature and common sense call on us to condemn.\r\n\r\nSo fraught with evil, and ruinous evil, is this practice, on the part\r\nof the Church as well as the world, of inquiring the judgment of the\r\nBible in regard to sins, which the natural and universal conscience\r\ncondemns, but which the inquirer means to persist in, if only he can\r\nget the Bible to testify against his conscience and in favor of his\r\nsins; so baleful, I say, is this practice, as to drive me to the\r\nconclusion that the Bible can not continue to be a blessing to mankind\r\nin spite of it. The practice, in its present wide and well-nigh\r\nuniversal extent, turns the heavenly volume into a curse. Owing to\r\nthis practice, the Bible is, this day, a hindrance rather than a help\r\nto civilization.\r\n\r\nBut if woman is of the same nature and same dignity with man, and if\r\nas much and as varied labor is needed to supply her wants as to supply\r\nthe wants of man, and if for her to be, as she so emphatically is,\r\npoor and destitute and dependent, is as fatal to her happiness and\r\nusefulness and to the fulfillment of the high purposes of her\r\nexistence, as the like circumstances would be to the honor and welfare\r\nof man, why then put her in a dress which compels her to be a\r\npauper--a pauper, whether in ribbons or rags? Why, I ask, put her in a\r\ndress suited only to those occasional and brief moods, in which man\r\nregards her as his darling, his idol, and his angel; or to that\r\ngeneral state of his mind in which he looks upon her as his servant,\r\nand with feelings certainly much nearer contempt than adoration.\r\nStrive as you will to elevate woman, nevertheless the disabilities and\r\ndegradation of this dress, together with that large group of false\r\nviews of the uses of her being and of her relations to man, symbolized\r\nand perpetuated, as I have already said, by this dress, will make your\r\nstriving vain.\r\n\r\nWoman must first fight against herself--against personal and mental\r\nhabits so deep-rooted and controlling, and so seemingly inseparable\r\nfrom herself, as to be mistaken for her very nature. And when she has\r\nsucceeded there, an easy victory will follow. But where shall be the\r\nbattle-ground for this indispensable self-conquest? She will laugh at\r\nmy answer when I tell her, that her dress, aye, her dress, must be\r\nthat battle-ground. What! no wider, no sublimer field than this to\r\nreap her glories in! My further answer is, that if she shall reap them\r\nanywhere, she must first reap them there. I add, that her triumph\r\nthere will be her triumph everywhere; and that her failure there will\r\nbe her failure everywhere.\r\n\r\n                                   Affectionately yours,\r\n                                                     GERRIT SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. STANTON'S REPLY.\r\n\r\n                                        SENECA FALLS, _Dec. 21, 1855_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COUSIN:--Your letter on the \"Woman's Right Movement\" I have\r\nthoroughly read and considered. I thank you, in the name of woman, for\r\nhaving said what you have on so many vital points. You have spoken\r\nwell for a man whose convictions on this subject are the result of\r\nreason and observation; but they alone whose souls are fired through\r\npersonal experience and suffering can set forth the height and depth,\r\nthe source and center of the degradation of women; they alone can feel\r\na steadfast faith in their own native energy and power to accomplish a\r\nfinal triumph over all adverse surroundings, a speedy and complete\r\nsuccess. You say you have but little faith in this reform, because the\r\nchanges we propose are so great, so radical, so comprehensive; whilst\r\nthey who have commenced the work are so puny, feeble, and undeveloped.\r\nThe mass of women are developed at least to the point of discontent,\r\nand that, in the dawn of this nation, was considered a most dangerous\r\npoint in the British Parliament, and is now deemed equally so on a\r\nSouthern plantation. In the human soul, the steps between discontent\r\nand action are few and short indeed. You, who suppose the mass of\r\nwomen contented, know but little of the silent indignation, the deep\r\nand settled disgust with which they contemplate our present social\r\narrangements. You claim to believe that in every sense, thought, and\r\nfeeling, man and woman are the same. Well, now, suppose yourself a\r\nwoman. You are educated up to that point where one feels a deep\r\ninterest in the welfare of her country, and in all the great questions\r\nof the day, in both Church and State; yet you have no voice in either.\r\nLittle men, with little brains, may pour forth their little sentiments\r\nby the hour, in the forum and the sacred desk, but public sentiment\r\nand the religion of our day teach us that silence is most becoming in\r\nwoman. So to solitude you betake yourself, and read for your\r\nconsolation the thoughts of dead men; but from the Bible down to\r\nMother Goose's Melodies, how much complacency, think you, you would\r\nfeel in your womanhood? The philosopher, the poet, and the saint, all\r\ncombine to make the name of woman synonymous with either fool or\r\ndevil. Every passion of the human soul, which in manhood becomes so\r\ngrand and glorious in its results, is fatal to womankind. Ambition\r\nmakes a Lady Macbeth; love, an Ophelia; none but those brainless\r\nthings, without will or passion, are ever permitted to come to a good\r\nend. What measure of content could you draw from the literature of the\r\npast?\r\n\r\nAgain, suppose yourself the wife of a confirmed drunkard. You behold\r\nyour earthly possessions all passing away; your heart is made\r\ndesolate; it has ceased to pulsate with either love, or hope, or joy.\r\nYour house is sold over your head, and with it every article of\r\ncomfort and decency; your children gather round you, one by one, each\r\nnewcomer clothed in rags and crowned with shame; is it with gladness\r\nyou now welcome the embrace of that beastly husband, feel his fevered\r\nbreath upon your cheek, and inhale the disgusting odor of his tobacco\r\nand rum? Would not your whole soul revolt from such an union? So do\r\nthe forty thousand drunkards' wives now in this State. They, too, are\r\nall discontented, and but for the pressure of law and gospel would\r\nspeedily sunder all these unholy ties. Yes, sir, there are women, pure\r\nand virtuous and noble as yourself, spending every day of all the\r\nyears of their existence in the most intimate association with\r\ninfamous men, kept so by that monstrous and unnatural artifice,\r\nbaptized by the sacred name of marriage. I might take you through\r\nmany, many phases of woman's life, into those sacred relations of\r\nwhich we speak not in our conventions, where woman feels her deepest\r\nwrongs, where in blank despair she drags out days, and weeks, and\r\nmonths, and years of silent agony. I might paint you pictures of real\r\nlife so vivid as to force from you the agonized exclamation, How can\r\nwomen endure such things!\r\n\r\nWe who have spoken out, have declared our rights, political and civil;\r\nbut the entire revolution about to dawn upon us by the acknowledgment\r\nof woman's social equality, has been seen and felt but by the few. The\r\nrights, to vote, to hold property, to speak in public, are\r\nall-important; but there are great social rights, before which all\r\nothers sink into utter insignificance. The cause of woman is, as you\r\nadmit, a broader and a deeper one than any with which you compare it;\r\nand this, to me, is the very reason why it must succeed. It is not a\r\nquestion of meats and drinks, of money and lands, but of human\r\nrights--the sacred right of a woman to her own person, to all her\r\nGod-given powers of body and soul. Did it ever enter into the mind of\r\nman that woman too had an inalienable right to life, liberty, and the\r\npursuit of her individual happiness? Did he ever take in the idea that\r\nto the mother of the race, and to her alone, belonged the right to say\r\nwhen a new being should be brought into the world? Has he, in the\r\ngratification of his blind passions, ever paused to think whether it\r\nwas with joy and gladness that she gave up ten or twenty years of the\r\nheyday of her existence to all the cares and sufferings of excessive\r\nmaternity? Our present laws, our religious teachings, our social\r\ncustoms on the whole question of marriage and divorce, are most\r\ndegrading to woman; and so long as man continues to think and write,\r\nto speak and act, as if maternity was the one and sole object of a\r\nwoman's existence--so long as children are conceived in weariness and\r\ndisgust--you must not look for high-toned men and women capable of\r\naccomplishing any great and noble achievement. But when woman shall\r\nstand on an even pedestal with man--when they shall be bound together,\r\nnot by withes of law and gospel, but in holy unity and love, then, and\r\nnot till then, shall our efforts at minor reforms be crowned with\r\ncomplete success. Here, in my opinion, is the starting-point; here is\r\nthe battle-ground where our independence must be fought and won. A\r\ntrue marriage relation has far more to do with the elevation of woman\r\nthan the style and cut of her dress. Dress is a matter of taste, of\r\nfashion; it is changeable, transient, and may be doffed or donned at\r\nthe will of the individual; but institutions, supported by laws, can\r\nbe overturned but by revolution. We have no reason to hope that\r\npantaloons would do more for us than they have done for man himself.\r\nThe negro slave enjoys the most unlimited freedom in his attire, not\r\nsurpassed even by the fashions of Eden in its palmiest days; yet in\r\nspite of his dress, and his manhood, too, he is a slave still. Was the\r\nold Roman in his toga less of a man than he now is in swallow-tail and\r\ntights? Did the flowing robes of Christ Himself render His life less\r\ngrand and beautiful? In regard to dress, where you claim to be so\r\nradical, you are far from consistent.\r\n\r\nBelieving, as you do, in the identity of the sexes, that all the\r\ndifference we see in tastes, in character, is entirely the result of\r\neducation--that \"man is woman and woman is man\"--why keep up these\r\ndistinctions in dress? Surely, whatever dress is convenient for one\r\nsex must be for the other also. Whatever is necessary for the perfect\r\nand full development of man's physical being, must be equally so for\r\nwoman. I fully agree with you that woman is terribly cramped and\r\ncrippled in her present style of dress. I have not one word to utter\r\nin its defense; but to me, it seems that if she would enjoy entire\r\nfreedom, she should dress just like man. Why proclaim our sex on the\r\nhouse-tops, seeing that it is a badge of degradation, and deprives us\r\nof so many rights and privileges wherever we go? Disguised as a man,\r\nthe distinguished French woman, \"George Sand,\" has been able to see\r\nlife in Paris, and has spoken in political meetings with great\r\napplause, as no woman could have done. In male attire, we could travel\r\nby land or sea; go through all the streets and lanes of our cities and\r\ntowns by night and day, without a protector; get seven hundred dollars\r\na year for teaching, instead of three, and ten dollars for making a\r\ncoat, instead of two or three, as we now do. All this we could do\r\nwithout fear of insult, or the least sacrifice of decency or virtue.\r\nIf nature has not made the sex so clearly defined as to be seen\r\nthrough any disguise, why should we make the difference so striking?\r\nDepend upon it, when men and women in their every-day life see and\r\nthink less of sex and more of mind, we shall all lead far purer and\r\nhigher lives.\r\n\r\nYour letter, my noble cousin, must have been written in a most\r\ndesponding mood, as all the great reforms of the day seem to you on\r\nthe verge of failure. What are the experiences of days and months and\r\nyears in the lifetime of a mighty nation? Can one man in his brief\r\nhour hope to see the beginning and end of any reform? When you compare\r\nthe public sentiment and social customs of our day with what they were\r\nfifty years ago, how can you despair of the temperance cause? With a\r\nMaine Law and divorce for drunkenness, the rum-seller and drunkard\r\nmust soon come to terms. Let woman's motto be, \"No union with\r\nDrunkards,\" and she will soon bring this long and well-fought battle\r\nto a triumphant close.\r\n\r\nNeither should you despair of the anti-slavery cause; with its\r\nmartyrs, its runaway slaves, its legal decisions in almost every paper\r\nyou take up, the topic of debate in our national councils, our\r\npolitical meetings, and our literature, it seems as if the nation were\r\nall alive on this question. True, four millions of slaves groan in\r\ntheir chains still, but every man in this nation has a higher idea of\r\nindividual rights than he had twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nAs to the cause of woman, I see no signs of failure. We already have a\r\nproperty law, which in its legitimate effects must elevate the _femme\r\ncovert_ into a living, breathing woman, a wife into a property-holder,\r\nwho can make contracts, buy and sell. In a few years we shall see how\r\nwell it works. It needs but little forethought to perceive that in due\r\ntime these large property-holders must be represented in the\r\nGovernment; and when the mass of women see that there is some hope of\r\nbecoming voters and law-makers, they will take to their rights as\r\nnaturally as the negro to his heels when he is sure of success. Their\r\npresent seeming content is very much like Sambo's on the plantation.\r\nIf you truly believe that man is woman, and woman is man; if you\r\nbelieve that all the burning indignation that fires your soul at the\r\nsight of injustice and oppression, if suffered in your own person,\r\nwould nerve you to a life-long struggle for liberty and independence,\r\nthen know that what you feel, I feel too, and what I feel the mass of\r\nwomen feel also. Judge by yourself, then, how long the women of this\r\nnation will consent to be deprived of their social, civil, and\r\npolitical rights; but talk not to us of failure. Talk not to us of\r\nchivalry, that died long ago. Where do you see it? No gallant knight\r\npresents himself at the bar of justice to pay the penalty of our\r\ncrimes. We suffer in our own persons, on the gallows, and in prison\r\nwalls. From Blackstone down to Kent, there is no display of gallantry\r\nin your written codes. In social life, true, a man in love will jump\r\nto pick up a glove or bouquet for a silly girl of sixteen, whilst at\r\nhome he will permit his aged mother to carry pails of water and\r\narmfuls of wood, or his wife to lug a twenty-pound baby, hour after\r\nhour, without ever offering to relieve her. I have seen a great many\r\nmen priding themselves on their good breeding--gentlemen, born and\r\neducated--who never manifest one iota of spontaneous gallantry toward\r\nthe women of their own household.\r\n\r\nDivines may preach thanksgiving sermons on the poetry of the arm-chair\r\nand the cradle; but when they lay down their newspapers, or leave\r\ntheir beds a cold night to attend to the wants of either, I shall\r\nbegin to look for the golden age of chivalry once more. If a short\r\ndress is to make the men less gallant than they now are, I beg the\r\nwomen at our next convention to add at least two yards more to every\r\nskirt they wear. And you mock us with dependence, too. Do not the\r\nmajority of women in every town support themselves, and very many\r\ntheir husbands, too? What father of a family, at the loss of his wife,\r\nhas ever been able to meet his responsibilities as woman has done?\r\nWhen the mother dies the house is made desolate, the children are\r\nforsaken--scattered to the four winds of heaven--to the care of any\r\none who chooses to take them. Go to those aged widows who have reared\r\nlarge families of children, unaided and alone, who have kept them all\r\ntogether under one roof, watched and nursed them in health and\r\nsickness through all their infant years, clothed and educated them,\r\nand made them all respectable men and women, ask them on whom they\r\ndepended. They will tell you on their own hands, and on that\r\nnever-dying, never-failing love, that a mother's heart alone can know.\r\nIt is into hands like these--to these who have calmly met the terrible\r\nemergencies of life--who, without the inspiration of glory, or fame,\r\nor applause, through long years have faithfully and bravely performed\r\ntheir work, self-sustained and cheered, that we commit our cause. We\r\nneed not wait for one more generation to pass away, to find a race of\r\nwomen worthy to assert the humanity of women, and that is all we claim\r\nto do.\r\n\r\n                                   Affectionately yours,\r\n                                           ELIZABETH CADY STANTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCES D. GAGE'S REPLY TO GERRIT SMITH.\r\n\r\n[From Frederick Douglass' paper].\r\n\r\nFREDERICK DOUGLASS.--_Dear Sir_:--In your issue of Dec. 1st, I find a\r\nletter from Hon. Gerrit Smith to Elizabeth C. Stanton, in reference to\r\nthe Woman's Rights Movement, showing cause, through labored columns,\r\nwhy it has proved a failure.\r\n\r\nThis article, though addressed to Mrs. Stanton, is an attack upon\r\nevery one engaged in the cause. For he boldly asserts that the\r\nmovement \"is not in proper hands, and that the proper hands are not\r\nyet to be found.\" I will not deny the assertion, but must still claim\r\nthe privilege of working in a movement that involves not only my own\r\ninterest, but the interests of my sex, and through us the interests of\r\na whole humanity. And though I may be but a John the Baptist, unworthy\r\nto unloose the latchet of the shoes of those who are to come in _short\r\nskirts_ to redeem the world, I still prefer that humble position to\r\nbeing Peter to deny my Master, or a Gerrit Smith to assert that truth\r\n_can_ fail.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to enter into a full criticism of Mr. Smith's long\r\nletter. He has made the whole battle-ground of the Woman's Rights\r\nMovement her dress. Nothing brighter, nothing nobler than a few inches\r\nof calico or brocade added to or taken from her skirts, is to decide\r\nthis great and glorious question--to give her freedom or to continue\r\nher a slave. This argument, had it come from one of less influence\r\nthan Gerrit Smith, would have been simply ridiculous. But coming from\r\n_him_, the almost oracle of a large portion of our reformers, it\r\nbecomes worthy of an answer from every earnest woman in our cause. I\r\nwill not say one word in defense of our present mode of dress. Not I;\r\nbut bad as it is, and cumbersome and annoying, I still feel that we\r\ncan wear it, and yet be lovers of liberty, speaking out our deep\r\nfeeling, portraying our accumulated wrongs, saving ourselves for a\r\ntime yet from that antagonism which we must inevitably meet when we\r\ndon the semi-male attire. We _must own ourselves under the law first_,\r\nown our bodies, our earnings, our genius, and our consciences; then we\r\nwill turn to the lesser matter of what shall be the garniture of the\r\nbody. Was the old Roman less a man in his cumbrous toga, than\r\nWashington in his tights? Was Christ less a Christ in His vesture,\r\nwoven without a seam, than He would have been in the suit of a\r\nBroadway dandy?\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, to concede to her rights of property, would be to benefit\r\nher comparatively little, unless she shall resolve to break out of her\r\nclothes-prison, and to undertake right earnestly, as earnestly as a\r\nman, to get property.\" So says Gerrit Smith. And he imputes the want\r\nof earnestness to her clothes. It in a new doctrine that high and holy\r\npurposes go from without inward, that the garments of men or women\r\ngovern and control their aspirations. But do not women _now_ work\r\nright earnestly? Do not the German women and our market women labor\r\nright earnestly? Do not the wives of our farmers and mechanics toil?\r\nIs not the work of the _mothers_ in our land as important as that of\r\nthe father? \"Labor is the foundation of wealth.\" The reason that our\r\nwomen are \"paupers,\" is not that they do not labor \"right earnestly,\"\r\nbut that the law gives their earnings into the hands of manhood. Mr.\r\nSmith says, \"That women are helpless, is no wonder, so long as they\r\nare paupers\"; he might add, no wonder that the slaves of the cotton\r\nplantation are helpless, so long as they are paupers. What reduces\r\nboth the woman and the slave to this condition? The law which gives\r\nthe husband and the master entire control of the person and earnings\r\nof each; the law that robs each of the rights and liberties that every\r\n\"free white male citizen\" takes to himself as God-given. Truth falling\r\nfrom the lips of a Lucretia Mott in long skirts is none the less\r\ntruth, than if uttered by a Lucy Stone in short dress, or a Helen\r\nMaria Weber in pants and swallow-tail coat. And I can not yet think so\r\nmeanly of manly justice, as to believe it will yield simply to a\r\nchange of garments. Let us assert our right to be free. Let us get out\r\nof our prison-house of law. Let us own ourselves, our earnings, our\r\ngenius; let us have power to control as well as to earn and to own;\r\nthen will each woman adjust her dress to her relations in life.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith speaks of reforms as failures; what can he mean? \"The\r\nTemperance Reform still drags.\" I have been in New York thirty-seven\r\ndays; have given thirty-three lectures; have been at taverns, hotels,\r\nprivate houses, and depots; rode in stages, country wagons, omnibuses,\r\ncarriages, and railroad cars; met the masses of people daily, and yet\r\nhave not seen one drunken man, scarce an evidence that there was such\r\na thing as intemperance in the Empire State. If the whole body has\r\nbeen diseased from childhood and a cure be attempted, shall we cry out\r\nagainst the physician that his effort is a failure, because the malady\r\ndoes not wholly disappear at once? Oh, no! let us rather cheer than\r\ndiscourage, while we see symptoms of amendment, hoping and trusting\r\nthat each day will give renewed strength for the morrow, till the cure\r\nshall be made perfect. The accumulated ills of centuries can not be\r\nremoved in a day or a year. Shall we talk of the Anti-Slavery Cause as\r\na \"failure,\" while our whole great nation is shaking as if an Etna\r\nwere boiling below? When did the North ever stand, as now, defiant of\r\nslavery? Anti-slavery may be said to be written upon the \"chariots and\r\nthe bells of the horses.\" Our National Congress is nothing more or\r\nless than a great Anti-slavery Convention. Not a bill, no matter how\r\nsmall or how great its importance, but hinges upon the question of\r\nslavery. The Anti-Slavery Cause is no failure; RIGHT CAN NOT FAIL.\r\n\r\n\"The next Woman's Rights Convention will be, as has every other\r\nWoman's Rights Convention, a failure, notwithstanding it will abound\r\nin righteous demands and noble sentiments.\" So thinks Mr. Smith. Has\r\nany Woman's Rights Convention been a failure? No movement so radical,\r\nstriking so boldly at the foundation of all social and political\r\norder, has ever come before the people, or ever so rapidly and widely\r\ndiffused its doctrine. The reports of our conventions have traveled\r\nwherever newspapers are read, causing discussion for and against, and\r\nthese discussions have elicited truth, and aroused public thought to\r\nthe evils growing out of woman's position. New trades and callings are\r\nopening to us; in every town and village may be found advocates for\r\nthe equality of privilege under the law, for every thinking, reasoning\r\nhuman soul. Shall we talk of failure, because forty, twenty, or seven\r\nyears have not perfected all things? When intemperance shall have\r\npassed away, and the four million chattel slaves shall sing songs of\r\nfreedom; when woman shall be recognized as man's equal, socially,\r\nlegally, and politically, there will yet be reforms and reformers, and\r\nmen who will despair and look upon one branch of the reform as the\r\ngreat _battle-ground_, and talk of the failure of the eternal law of\r\nprogress. Still there will be stout hearts and willing hands to work\r\non, honestly believing that truth and right are sustained by no single\r\npoint, and their watchword will be \"Onward!\" We can not fail, for our\r\ncause is just.\r\n\r\n                                             FRANCES D. GAGE.\r\n  ROCHESTER, _Dec. 24, 1855_.\r\n\r\nThe names of those who wore the Bloomer costume at that early day are:\r\nElizabeth Smith Miller, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Amelia Bloomer, Sarah\r\nand Angelina Grimké, Mrs. William Burleigh, Charlotte Beebe Wilbour,\r\nLucy Stone, Susan B. Anthony, Helen Jarvis, Lydia Sayre Hasbrook,\r\nAmelia Williard, Celia Burleigh, Harriet N. Austin, Lydia Jenkins, and\r\nmany patients at sanitariums, many farmers' wives, and many young\r\nladies for skating and gymnastic exercises.\r\n\r\nLooking back to this experiment, we are not surprised at the hostility\r\nof men in general to the dress, as it made it very uncomfortable for\r\nthem to go anywhere with those who wore it. People would stare; some\r\nmen and women make rude remarks; boys follow in crowds, or shout from\r\nbehind fences, so that the gentleman in attendance felt it his duty to\r\nresent the insult by showing fight, unless he had sufficient\r\nself-control to pursue the even tenor of his way without taking the\r\nslightest notice of the commotion his companion was creating. No man\r\nwent through the ordeal with the coolness and dogged determination of\r\nCharles Dudley Miller, escorting his wife and cousin on long\r\njourneyings, at fashionable resorts, in New York and Washington, to\r\nthe vexation of all his gentleman friends and acquaintances.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMELIA BLOOMER COMMENTS ON JANE G. SWISSHELM.\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Nonpareil:_\r\n\r\nJane Grey Swisshelm thinks it is dare-devil independence that is\r\nruining the women of this country.--_Nonpareil_.\r\n\r\nAnd what woman of them all has shown so much \"dare-devil independence\"\r\nas Jane G. Swisshelm? One of the first women to wield the\r\npen-editorial thirty years ago, she was so independent and fearless as\r\nto excite the wonder of her readers. The first woman admitted to the\r\nreporters' gallery in the Capitol of the nation, she astonished and\r\nshocked the country by her attacks upon Daniel Webster and other\r\nprominent senators at that day, and was expelled from the gallery for\r\nher \"dare-devil independence.\" While publishing a paper at St. Cloud,\r\nshe was so outspoken and offensive in her personalities, that her\r\npress and type were destroyed by indignant politicians. After the war\r\nshe obtained an office in one of the departments at Washington, and\r\nstarted a paper called the _Reconstructionist_ in that city. For her\r\n\"dare-devil independence\" as a writer in attacking President Johnson\r\nand charging that he had part in the assassination of President\r\nLincoln, she was relieved of her office and her press destroyed.\r\n\r\nAnd so in whatever she has part; to whatever she sets her hand, she\r\never displays a reckless independence that is truly a marvel to those\r\nwho watch her uncertain course. She fearlessly attacks both friend and\r\nfoe, if they go contrary to her views of right; and both people and\r\nmeasures that to-day have her countenance and approval, are liable\r\nto-morrow to receive an unmerciful lashing from her pen. No woman has\r\nset an example of more \"dare-devil independence\" before \"the women of\r\nthis country\" than Jane G. Swisshelm, and if it is proving their ruin\r\nshe has much to answer for. But we are not prepared to believe her\r\nassertion, and we can not think her a ruined woman, notwithstanding\r\nher many years of \"dare-devil independence.\" The writer has known her\r\nlong, has engaged in many a pen-tilt with her, but has never met her\r\npersonally. She regards her as an able, outspoken defender of the\r\nwronged and oppressed, a fearless advocate of the right as she sees\r\nit, and an \"independent dare-devil\" writer on whatever subject she\r\ndeems worthy of her pen.\r\n\r\n                                             AMELIA BLOOMER.\r\n\r\nCOUNCIL BLUFFS, _July 30, 1880_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK STATE TEMPERANCE CONVENTION, ROCHESTER,\r\n\r\nAPRIL 20, 21, 1852.\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM FRANCES DANA GAGE.\r\n\r\n                                   MCCONNELLSVILLE, O., _April 5, 1852_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MISS ANTHONY:--Yours of March 22d, asking of me words of\r\ncounsel and encouragement for the friends of temperance, who are to\r\nmeet at Rochester on the 20th inst., is before me. Need I tell you how\r\nearnestly my heart responds to that request, and with what joy I hail\r\nevery demonstration on the part of woman that evidences an awakening\r\nenergy in her mind, to the great duties and responsibilities of her\r\nbeing!\r\n\r\nIf we examine the statistics of crime in the United States, we shall\r\nfind that a very large proportion of the criminals of our land are the\r\nvictims of intemperance. The records of poverty, shame, and\r\ndegradation furnish the same evidence against the traffic and use of\r\nardent spirits. Examine those same statistics, and another great truth\r\nstares us in the face--that nine-tenths of all the manufacturers of\r\nardent spirits, of all the drinkers of ardent spirits, and of all the\r\ncriminals made by ardent spirits, are men. But we find, too, in our\r\nsearch, a fact equally interesting to us, that the greatest sufferers\r\nfrom all this crime and shame and wrong, are women. Is it not meet,\r\nthen, that women should lay aside the dependent inactivity which has\r\nhitherto held them powerless, and give their strength to the cause of\r\nreform which is now agitating the minds of the people?\r\n\r\nWhat is woman? The answer is returned to me in tones that shake my\r\nvery soul. She is the mother of mankind! The living providence, under\r\nGod, who gives to every human being its mental, moral, and physical\r\norganism--who stamps upon every human heart her seal for good or for\r\nevil! Who then, but she, should cry aloud, and spare not, when the\r\nchildren she has borne--forgetting their allegiance to her and their\r\nduty to themselves, have assumed the power to rule over her, shutting\r\nher out from their counsels, and surrounding her, without her own\r\nconsent, with circumstances which lead to misery and death; and, in\r\ntheir pride and strength, trampling upon justice, love, and mercy,\r\nwithering her heart by violence and oppression, and yet compelling\r\nher, in her dependence as a wife, to perpetuate in her offspring their\r\nown depraved appetites and disorganized faculties?\r\n\r\nIt will not be denied that woman in all past ages has been made, by\r\nboth law and custom, the inferior of her own children. Man has assumed\r\nto himself the power of being \"lord of creation\"; yet what has he done\r\nfor his kind? Look at the present state of society and receive your\r\nanswer! He has filled the world with madness, with oppression and\r\nwrong; he has allowed snares to be laid at every turn, to entangle the\r\nfeet of our children, and lead them away into vice and crime. He has\r\nlegalized the causes which fill the jails, the penitentiaries, the\r\nhouses of correction, the poorhouses, and asylums with the blood of\r\nour hearts, even our children, and our children's children. There is\r\nnot a drunkard in the land, not a criminal that has been made by\r\nstrong drink, but is the child of a woman. Yet not one woman's vote\r\nhas ever been given to legalize the sale of ardent spirits, that have\r\nmaddened the brain of her child. No woman's vote ever sanctioned the\r\nrum-seller's bar, at which her husband has bartered away his manhood,\r\nand made himself more vile than the brutes that perish.\r\n\r\nShall I be answered that woman's home influence must keep her children\r\nand her husband in the paths of virtue and honor? What! disfranchised\r\nwoman--made by her law-maker an appendage to himself, her intellect\r\nshackled, her labor underrated, her physical power dwarfed and\r\nenfeebled by custom--is she expected to do this mighty thing? I hear\r\nagain an answer--\"Woman is responsible for the moral atmosphere that\r\nsurrounds her.\" Is this indeed so? Men have taken from her every power\r\nto protect herself, even the dignity and respect which the right of\r\nsuffrage confers upon the lowest man in the community, and which makes\r\nhis opinion worth its price among men, is denied her. Men are in the\r\ndaily habit of indulging in immoralities and vices, while they enjoin\r\nit upon woman--\"poor, frail, weak woman,\" as they call us--to destroy\r\nthe influence they have created. They place the temptation before the\r\nchild, then sternly demand of its suffering mother her vigilance and\r\ncare to control the appetite, which he has, it may be, inherited from\r\nhis fathers, back from the third and fourth generation. Perchance,\r\neven through her own breast, he has sucked the poison that is\r\ncorrupting all the streams of his young life. She may have grappled\r\nwith the tempter, and come off conqueror; but can she hold him, the\r\ndrunkard's child--the drunkard's grandchild--with the twofold curse\r\nupon his brow, while men place this direful temptation ever within his\r\nreach, glaring out upon him in beautiful enticement at every corner of\r\nthe street, and at every turn of his daily and nightly walks, and add\r\ntheir influence and example to draw him away from the counsels of a\r\nmother's love, and the endearments of home? Then, when, under the\r\ninfluence of men, he outrages society, and in his maniac madness\r\nviolates the law of the land, and becomes a felon, wasting away his\r\ndays in the gloomy prison, or expiating his crimes upon the gallows,\r\nthey forget what they have done, and, turning to the poor, crushed,\r\nand bleeding heart, which they have pierced with a thousand sorrows,\r\ncry out, \"You, O mother of that guilty man, have not done your duty,\r\nand society holds you responsible for all his suffering and for all\r\nhis crimes. O God! is this not adding insult to injury? How can the\r\nweak control the strong? How can the servant, bound hand and foot by\r\nthe master, do the bidding of the tyrant? But all men are not\r\nweak--all men are not oppressive--all men are not unjust. There is a\r\nstrong force, ever in the field of battle, struggling for truth and\r\nright with earnest heart and firm resolve. Let us arouse, O my\r\nsisters, and add our strength to theirs. The time is coming, aye, now\r\nis, when we must shake off our dependence and inactivity, and live\r\nmore true to ourselves; when we must refuse to live the wives of\r\ndrunkards, perpetuating, as mothers, their vices and crimes, to\r\npollute society.\r\n\r\nLet us unite with the good and true among men, that our efforts may\r\novercome the legions who have hitherto conquered on the side of wrong,\r\nand raise high the standard of love and humanity, where falsehood and\r\nhate have ruled rampant. Let every woman, everywhere, speak out her\r\nbold, free thought on the subject of temperance; and while we plead\r\nwith our rulers to deliver our husbands, fathers, sons, and brothers\r\nfrom the temptations to sin, let us demand with earnestness the right\r\nhereafter to protect ourselves; that we may redeem ourselves from the\r\nunjust law that now taxes every woman, without her own consent,\r\naccording to her property or ability to labor, to pay her proportion\r\nfor the support of vice and crime--that hereafter, when such great\r\nmoral questions are under public discussion, and we, as one-half of\r\nthe people, send up our petitions to our law-makers for a redress of\r\nwrongs, or an abatement of evils, our voice of pleading shall not be\r\nspurned by the heartless sneer, \"They are only women, and the voice of\r\na woman can not affect us at the polls, or disturb the course of our\r\npolitical parties. What care we for her progress or her wrongs?\" Thus\r\nhave we too often been answered, and shall be again, if we do not\r\nprove worthy of the chaplet of freedom, by winning it for ourselves.\r\nLet us then unite heart and hand in this great temperance\r\nreform--laying aside all local animosities, all sectional prejudices\r\nand sectarian jealousies--and, as it were, with one voice and one\r\nspirit, take hold of the work before us, resolved, if we fail to-day,\r\nto rise with renewed energy to-morrow, and \"Never give up!\" be our\r\nmotto, till, without bloodshed, without hate, or uncharitableness, we\r\ngain the victory over those who cater to the most uncontrollable and\r\ndestructive passion that has ever cursed humanity--the passion for\r\nstrong drink--and then, and not till then, will we fold our arms and\r\ntake our rest, amid the hallelujahs of the redeemed.\r\n\r\n                              Yours, in the cause of humanity,\r\n                                                  FRANCES D. GAGE.\r\n  S. B. ANTHONY, _Chairman of Committee_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM MRS. C. I. H. NICHOLS.\r\n\r\n                                   BRATTLEBORO, Vt., _April 13, 1852_.\r\n\r\nSISTERS AND FRIENDS OF TEMPERANCE:--In resorting to the pen as a\r\nmedium of communication with your Convention, I feel, most sensibly,\r\nits inferiority to a _vis-à-vis_ talk--it tells so little, and that so\r\nmeagerly! But, remembering that a single just thought, or vital truth,\r\ncommunicated to intelligent minds and willing hearts, is an investment\r\nsure of increase, I will bless God for the pen, and ask of Him to make\r\nit a tongue for humanity.\r\n\r\nThe limits of a written communication will forbid me to say much, and\r\nI would address myself to a single point broached in your Albany\r\nConvention, and a point that seems to me of the first importance;\r\nbecause a mistake in morals, a wrong perpetrated in the home\r\nrelations, is the greatest of all wrongs to humanity. And marred,\r\nindeed, would be your triumph, if, in preventing the repeal of one\r\nunjust statute, you sanction the enactment of another. So true it is\r\nthat one injustice becomes the source of another, I fear to\r\ncontemplate the enactment of a trifling encroachment even upon\r\ninalienable rights or divinely sanctioned pursuits.\r\n\r\nIn addressing myself to the position that \"drunkenness be made a good\r\nand sufficient cause for divorce,\" I am secured from any fear that you\r\nwill regard me as warring with abstractions, since such a bill has\r\nfound its way into your Legislature, proving that the popular sympathy\r\nfor suffering women and children is already concentrating on divorce\r\nas the remedy. I have hesitated about addressing you on this subject,\r\nlest I might render myself obnoxious to the charge of diverting the\r\nobjects of your meeting, to an occasion for the discussion of\r\nforbidden topics. But an irresistible conviction, that since the\r\nsubject is already launched upon your reform, it is important that a\r\njust view of its bearings should be presented, impels me to throw\r\nmyself upon your sympathy, trusting in the divine power of truth to\r\ncommend both my motives and my positions to your judgments and your\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nAnd first, let me say, I would not be understood as opposed to\r\nemancipating the wretched victims of irremediable abuse. And if there\r\nbe a benevolence, under the warm heaven of Almighty Love, it is the\r\nprotecting of helplessness and innocence from the sufferings that\r\nresult, inevitably, from the rum traffic. But while I fully agree with\r\nMrs. Stanton, that no pure-hearted and understanding woman can\r\ninnocently become the mother of a drunkard's offspring--while I rely\r\nupon the general diffusion of physiological truths to create a\r\nsentiment abhorrent to the idea of raising a posterity, the breath of\r\nwhose life shall be derived from the animalized and morally tainted\r\nvitality of the drunkard--I differ with her in the remedy proposed.\r\n\r\nIf drunkenness were irremediable, and beyond the reach of legislation,\r\nthen would I accept her remedy as the final resort. But regarding\r\ndivorce as, at best, only affording a choice of evils, and drunkenness\r\nas equally within the power of legislation, I propose that drunkenness\r\nbe legislated out of existence, and thus the necessity for divorce,\r\nwhich it creates, be avoided.\r\n\r\nLet a thoroughly prohibitive law destroy the traffic, and the drunkard\r\nwill be found \"clothed\" again and \"in his right mind.\" It will come to\r\nthis glorious consummation at last; and, though years may intervene,\r\nit becomes us to act with reference to the discerned future, and\r\nbeware that transient evils do not betray us into planting life-long\r\nregrets. Allow me to illustrate my idea by narrating incidents of a\r\ncase in point, and which is inwoven with the recollections and\r\ntenderest sympathies of my whole life.\r\n\r\nThe young and lovely mother of five little ones procured a divorce\r\nfrom her husband, whose incompetency and unkindness was the result\r\nsolely of intemperance, and that intemperance the consequence of his\r\nstrong social bias and inability to resist the temptations of a\r\nperiod, when every man put the bottle to his neighbor's month as proof\r\nof his generosity, his friendship, and his good-breeding. His father,\r\non whom the family were dependent for support, urged it upon the wife,\r\nas a duty to her children and due to her own self-respect, to procure\r\na divorce, when, at last, the miserable husband had been sent to\r\nprison for a forgery, involving a small sum, and which he had thought\r\nto meet--before the note came to maturity--undetected.\r\n\r\nShe submitted, and, before the period of his imprisonment expired,\r\nmarried again, by the advice and persuasion of her kind father-in-law,\r\nto a wealthy and excellent man, who offered a father's care and home\r\nto her children, in proof of his affection for herself. But the heart\r\nnever yielded its first love; and, when more than twenty years had\r\npassed, she confessed to a friend \"that, should he reform at the\r\neleventh hour, she must be the most wretched of women.\" He did reform!\r\nand for many years has exhibited those cheerful graces of the\r\nChristian, which, added to his naturally amiable disposition and\r\nunselfish deportment, make his three-score and tenth year seem rather\r\nthe morning than the evening of a life, stretching far away into the\r\nglories of eternity.\r\n\r\nAnd now, tell me, friends, if the picture of that youthful affection,\r\nstrengthened and intensified in the hearts of both by long years of\r\nunavailing regret, does not awaken in you a conviction of some better\r\nway for protecting helpless women and children from the evils of\r\ndrunkenness? Oh, say, can you calmly contemplate the hundreds and\r\nthousands of hearts which would throb with repressed anguish, when the\r\nwretchedness which drove them to divorce shall have vanished with the\r\ndoomed traffic, and reformed men, by the strong arm of law, reclaim\r\ntheir children from the weeping Rachels of the land?\r\n\r\nBut think not, friends, that I am unmindful of the misery of years, or\r\nmonths even, when I plead that divorce shall not be made the necessity\r\nof hunted and betrayed affections, the factitious barrier against\r\nabuse and starvation. I present to your consideration a remedy equally\r\neffective, and far more grateful to the delicate sensibilities and\r\nhopeful affection of the woman and the wife--a remedy which possesses\r\nthe merit of a preventive power, and the collateral security of a\r\nreclaiming influence.\r\n\r\nThe advantage proposed to be secured to the wife of the drunkard, by\r\ndivorce, is the release from his control of her property and person.\r\nSecure to the innocent and suffering wife the guardianship of her\r\nchildren, and the control of her own earnings--in short, make her a\r\nfree, instead of a bond-woman--and you secure to the family of the\r\ndrunkard all the alleviation in the power of legislation, and without\r\ncompelling the wife, from pecuniary necessity or self-immolating\r\nregard for her children, to sever her conjugal relation, and quench\r\nthe hope of a future of rational companionship.\r\n\r\nThe pauperism and extreme degradation of the drunkard's family is\r\nmainly chargeable to the laws, which wreck the energies, by merging\r\nthe means of the wife and mother in the will of the irresponsible\r\nhusband and father.\r\n\r\nWith these views--gathered from facts and heart-broken confidences\r\nopen to few--I appeal to you in the name of the most sacred\r\naffections--I protest, in behalf of humanity, against compelling the\r\nunfortunate of my dependent sex to choose between their present\r\nbondage of means and divorce.\r\n\r\nTo the Christian, who shrinks from divorce, as separating what God\r\nhath joined, I appeal to carry out the principle, preserving\r\neverywhere what God hath joined. Hath He not joined mother and child\r\nin body and spirit? Sever them not. Hath He not joined in each human\r\nbeing necessities and ability to supply them? But, alas! by man's\r\ncarpentry, the ability of woman to supply her wants is pressed into\r\nthe service of man's carnal and wicked appetites, to supply him with\r\nliquid fire, while herself and babes become miserable paupers in body\r\nand in mind!\r\n\r\nI leave the subject here, praying that God may bless your\r\ndeliberations, and guide you into all truth.\r\n\r\n                              Yours, for the oppressed, ever,\r\n                                                      C. I. H. NICHOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYRACUSE CONVENTION, SEPT. 8, 9, 10, 1852.\r\n\r\nELIZABETH CADY STANTON'S LETTER.\r\n\r\n                                             SENECA FALLS, _Sept. 6_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIENDS:--As I can not be present with you, I wish to suggest\r\nthree points for your sincere and earnest consideration.\r\n\r\n1. Should not all women living in States where woman has the right to\r\nhold property refuse to pay taxes, so long as she is unrepresented in\r\nthe government of that State?\r\n\r\nSuch a movement, if simultaneous, would no doubt produce a great deal\r\nof confusion, litigation, and suffering on the part of woman; but\r\nshall we fear to suffer for the maintenance of the same glorious\r\nprinciple for which our forefathers fought, bled, and died? Shall we\r\ndeny the faith of the old Revolutionary heroes, and purchase for\r\nourselves a false power and ignoble ease, by declaring in action that\r\ntaxation without representation is just? Ah, no! like the English\r\nDissenters and high-souled Quakers of our own land, let us suffer our\r\nproperty to be seized and sold, but let us never pay another tax until\r\nour existence as citizens, our civil and political rights be fully\r\nrecognized.... The poor, crushed slave, but yesterday toiling on the\r\nrice plantation in Georgia, a beast, a chattel, a thing, is to-day, in\r\nthe Empire State (if he own a bit of land and a shed to cover him), a\r\nperson, and may enjoy the proud honor of paying into the hand of the\r\ncomplaisant tax-gatherer the sum of seventy-five cents. Even so with\r\nthe white woman--the satellite of the dinner-pot, the presiding genius\r\nof the wash-tub, the seamstress, the teacher, the gay butterfly of\r\nfashion, the _feme covert_ of the law, man takes no note of her\r\nthrough all these changing scenes. But, lo! to-day, by the fruit of\r\nher industry, she becomes the owner of a house and lot, and now her\r\nexistence is remembered and recognized, and she too may have the\r\nprivilege of contributing to the support of this mighty Republic, for\r\nthe \"white male citizen claims of her one dollar and seventy-five\r\ncents a year, because, under the glorious institutions of this free\r\nand happy land, she has been able, at the age of fifty years, to\r\npossess herself of a property worth the enormous sum of three hundred\r\ndollars. It is natural to suppose she will answer this demand on her\r\njoyously and promptly, for she must, in view of all her rights and\r\nprivileges so long enjoyed, consider it a great favor to be permitted\r\nto contribute thus largely to the governmental treasury.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain, this course will necessarily involve a good deal\r\nof litigation, and we shall need lawyers of our own sex whose\r\nintellects, sharpened by their interests, shall be quick to discover\r\nthe loopholes of retreat. Laws are capable of many and various\r\nconstructions; we find among men that as they have new wants, that as\r\nthey develop into more enlarged views of justice, the laws are\r\nsusceptible of more generous interpretation, or changed altogether;\r\nthat is, all laws touching their own interests; for while man has\r\nabolished hanging for theft, imprisonment for debt, and secured\r\nuniversal suffrage for himself, a married woman, in most of the States\r\nin the Union, remains a nonentity in law--can own nothing; can be\r\nwhipped and locked up by her lord; can be worked without wages, be\r\nrobbed of her inheritance, stripped of her children, and left alone\r\nand penniless; and all this, they say, according to law. Now, it is\r\nquite time that we have these laws revised by our own sex, for man\r\ndoes not yet feel that what is unjust for himself, is also unjust for\r\nwoman. Yes, we must have our own lawyers, as well as our physicians\r\nand priests. Some of our women should go at once into this profession,\r\nand see if there is no way by which we may shuffle off our shackles\r\nand assume our civil and political rights. We can not accept man's\r\ninterpretation of the law.\r\n\r\n2. Do not sound philosophy and long experience teach us that man and\r\nwoman should be educated together? This isolation of the sexes in all\r\ndepartments, in the business and pleasure of life, is an evil greatly\r\nto be deplored. We see its bad effects on all sides. Look at our\r\nNational Councils. Would men, as statesmen, ever have enacted such\r\nscenes as the Capitol of our country has witnessed, had the feminine\r\nelement been fairly represented in their midst? Are all the duties of\r\nhusband and father to be made subservient to those of statesman and\r\npolitician? How many of these husbands return to their homes as happy\r\nand contented, as pure and loving, as when they left? Not one in\r\nten.... Experience has taught us that man has discovered the most\r\nprofitable branches of industry, and we demand a place by his side.\r\nInasmuch, therefore, as we have the same objects in life, namely, the\r\nfull development of all our powers, and should, to some extent, have\r\nthe same employments, we need precisely the same education; and we\r\ntherefore claim that the best colleges of our country be open to\r\nus.... This point, the education of boys and girls together, is a\r\nquestion of the day; it was prominent at the late Educational\r\nConvention in Newark, and it is fitting that in our Convention it\r\nshould be fully discussed. My ground is, that the boy and the girl,\r\nthe man and the woman, should be always together in the business and\r\npleasures of life, sharing alike its joys and sorrows, its distinction\r\nand fame; nor will they ever be harmoniously developed until they are\r\neducated together, physically, intellectually, and morally.\r\n\r\nI hope, therefore, that in the proposed People's College, some place\r\nwill be provided where women can be educated side by side with man.\r\nThere is no better test of the spirituality of a man, than is found in\r\nhis idea of the true woman. Men having separated themselves from women\r\nin the business of life, and thus made their natures coarse by contact\r\nwith their own sex exclusively, now demand separate pleasures too; and\r\nin lieu of the cheerful family circle, its books, games, music, and\r\npleasant conversation, they congregate in clubs to discuss politics,\r\ngamble, drink, etc., in those costly, splendid establishments, got up\r\nfor such as can not find sufficient excitement in their own parlors or\r\nstudios. It seems never to enter the heads of these fashionable\r\nhusbands, that the hours drag as heavily with their fashionable wives,\r\nas they sit alone, night after night, in their solitary elegance,\r\nwholly given up to their own cheerless reflections; for what subjects\r\nof thought have they? Gossip and fashion will do for talk, but not for\r\nthought. Their theology is too gloomy and shadowy to afford them much\r\npleasure in contemplation; their religion is a thing of form and not\r\nof life, so it brings them no joy or satisfaction. As to the reforms\r\nof the day, they are too genteel to feel much interest in them. There\r\nis no class more pitiable than the unoccupied woman of fashion thrown\r\nwholly upon herself.... Does not the abuse of the religious element in\r\nwoman demand our earnest attention and investigation?\r\n\r\nPriestcraft did not end with the beginning of the reign of\r\nProtestantism. Woman has always been the greatest dupe, because the\r\nsentiments act blindly, and they alone have been educated in her. Her\r\nveneration, not guided by an enlightened intellect, leads her as\r\nreadily to the worship of saints, pictures, holy days, and inspired\r\nmen and books, as of the living God and the everlasting principles of\r\nJustice, Mercy, and Truth.\r\n\r\nThere is the Education Society, in which women who can barely read and\r\nwrite and speak their own language correctly, form sewing societies,\r\nand beg funds to educate a class of lazy, inefficient young men for\r\nthe ministry, who, starting in life on the false principle that it is\r\na blessing to escape physical labor, begin at once to live on their\r\npiety. What is the result? Why, after going through college,\r\ntheological seminaries, and a brief struggle at fitting up skeleton\r\nsermons, got up by older heads for the benefit of beginners, and after\r\npreaching them for a season to those who hunger and thirst for light\r\nand truth, they sink down into utter insignificance, too inefficient\r\nto keep a place, and too lazy to earn the salt to their porridge,\r\nwhilst the women work on to educate more for the same destiny. Look at\r\nthe long line of benevolent societies, all filled with these male\r\nagents, living, like so many leeches, on the religious element in our\r\nnatures, most of them from the ranks of the clergy, who, unable to\r\nbuild up or keep a church, have taken refuge in some of these\r\ntheological asylums for the intellectually maimed, halt, and blind of\r\nthis profession.\r\n\r\nWoman really thinks she is doing God service when she casts her mite\r\ninto their treasury, when in fact not one-tenth of all the funds\r\nraised ever reach the ultimate object. Among the clergy we find our\r\nmost violent enemies--those most opposed to any change in woman's\r\nposition; yet no sooner does one of these find himself out of place\r\nand pocket, than, if all the places in the various benevolent\r\nsocieties chance to be occupied, he takes a kind of philanthropic\r\nsurvey of the whole habitable globe, and forthwith forms a Female\r\nBenevolent Society for the conversion of the Jews, perhaps, or for\r\nsending the Gospel to the Feejee Islands, and he is, in himself, the\r\nlaw for one and the gospel for the other. Now, the question is, not\r\nwhether the Jews are converted, or whether the Gospel ever reaches the\r\nislands, but, Does the agent flourish? Is his post profitable? And\r\ndoes woman beg and stitch faithfully for his support and for the\r\npromotion of his _glorious mission?_\r\n\r\nNow, I ask women with all seriousness, considering that we have little\r\nto give, had we not better bestow our own charities with our own\r\nhands? And instead of sending our benevolent outgushings in steamers\r\nto parts unknown, had we not better let them flow in streams whose\r\nlength and breadth we can survey at pleasure, knowing their source\r\nand where they empty themselves? Instead of any further efforts in\r\nbehalf of a pin-cushion ministry, I conjure my countrywomen to devote\r\nthemselves from this hour to the education, elevation, and\r\nenfranchisement of their own sex. If the same amount of devotion and\r\nself-sacrifice could be given in this direction now poured out on the\r\nchurches, another generation would give us a nobler type of womanhood\r\nthan any yet molded by any Bishop, Priest, or Pope.\r\n\r\nWoman in her present ignorance is made to rest in the most distorted\r\nviews of God and the Bible and the laws of her being; and like the\r\npoor slave \"Uncle Tom,\" her religion, instead of making her noble and\r\nfree, and impelling her to flee from all gross surroundings, by the\r\nfalse lessons of her spiritual teachers, by the wrong application of\r\ngreat principles of right and justice, has made her bondage but more\r\ncertain and lasting, her degradation more helpless and complete.\r\n\r\n                                             ELIZABETH CADY STANTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 GLOUCESTER, MASS., _August 24, 1852_.\r\n\r\n_To Mrs. Paulina W. Davis:_\r\n\r\nDEAR MADAM:...--I have never questioned what I understand to be the\r\ncentral principle of the reform in which you are engaged. I believe\r\nthat every mature soul is responsible directly to God, not only for\r\nits faith and opinions, but for the details of its life in the world.\r\nIn every crisis of duty there can be consultation, at last, only\r\nbetween one spirit and its Creator. The assertion that woman is\r\nresponsible to man for her belief or conduct, in any other sense than\r\nman is responsible to woman, I reject, not as a believer in any theory\r\nof \"Woman's Rights,\" but as a believer in that religion which knows\r\nneither male nor female, in its imperative demand upon the individual\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\nThis being true, I know not by what logic the obligation of woman to\r\nform her own ideal of life, and pursue the career which her reason and\r\nconscience dictate, can be denied. The sphere of activity in which any\r\nperson will shine, is always an open question until answered by\r\nexperience. I may admire the wisdom of the mind which has discovered\r\nthat half the people in the world are incompetent to act beyond one\r\ncircle of duty; but until the fact has been established by the\r\nuniversal failure of your sex, everywhere outside that fatal line, I\r\nmust admire rather than believe. Every real position in society is\r\nachieved by conquest. I must convince my people that I am a true\r\nminister of the Gospel, before I can claim their respect and support.\r\nAnd when a woman, in the possession of the powers and opportunities\r\ngiven her by God, tells me she must trade, or instruct the young, or\r\nheal the sick, or paint, or sing, or act upon the stage, or call\r\nsinners to repentance, I _can_ say but one thing--just what I must say\r\nto the man who affirms the same--\"My friend, show your _ability_ to\r\nserve society in this way, and all creation can not deprive you of the\r\nright. If you _can do_ this to which you aspire--can do it well, then\r\nyou and everybody will be the gainers. And whoever says you have\r\nforfeited any essential grace or virtue of womanhood by your act,\r\nbetrays, by the accusation, an utter incompetency to judge upon\r\nquestions of human responsibility and obligation.\"\r\n\r\n.... I therefore believe the method of this reform is that declared by\r\nGod when He said to Adam: \"In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat\r\nbread.\" There is no \"royal road\" to womanhood, as there is certainly\r\nnone to manhood. _You_ must achieve what you desire.... Woman must do\r\nmuch before man can help her. I suppose the sexes are about equally\r\nculpable; and I make no peculiar charge, when I say that until I can\r\nsee more individual consecration, more clearness of perception and\r\nfirmness of conduct in regions outside of the walls of the household\r\namong the mass of women, than now, I shall not cherish extravagant\r\nhopes of the great immediate success of your noble object.\r\n\r\n.... Your movement is a part of the great onward march of society, and\r\nmust be exposed to the reverses from outward hostility and inward\r\nfaithlessness, that have always hindered the progress of the race....\r\nThis reform will be a sword of division, and you will not be surprised\r\nwhen those who have entered it from any motive less exalted than\r\nconsecration to duty, fall away in weariness and disgust. Yet all the\r\nmore honorable will it be to those who are content to remain, and\r\nabide the fatal conditions of sincere human effort. You are not very\r\nnear your journey's end; but you are doing much for your sex, in a\r\nmode which will \"tell\" inevitably upon society. I often encounter a\r\nnew spirit of self-respect and honorable independence; a new hope, and\r\nworks corresponding to it, among young women, which I can trace back\r\nto these Conventions. I believe cultivated men in all professions are\r\nbecoming ashamed to treat your arguments with open ridicule or quiet\r\ncontempt, and occupy a position, at least, of fair-minded neutrality,\r\nto a greater degree than ever before, while the popular sympathies are\r\nevery year more enlisted in your success.--With great respect, I\r\nremain your friend and fellow-laborer in the cause of truth,\r\n\r\n                                                      A. D. MAYO.\r\n\r\n\r\nSamuel J. May read the following extract from a letter from Wm. Lloyd\r\nGarrison, of Boston:\r\n\r\n\"Much, very much, do I regret that I can not be at the Woman's Rights\r\nConvention which is to assemble to-morrow in Syracuse; but\r\ncircumstances prevent. I shall be there in spirit, from its\r\norganization to its dissolution. It has as noble an object in view,\r\naye, and as Christian a one, too, as was ever advocated beneath the\r\nsun. Heaven bless all its proceedings.\r\n\r\n                              \"Yours for all Human Rights,\r\n                                               WM. LLOYD GARRISON.\r\n  \"Rev. S. J. MAY.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENTS OF THE PRESS AFTER THE SYRACUSE CONVENTION.\r\n\r\n  _The Syracuse Standard, Sept. 10th_ (a liberal Democratic paper).\r\n\r\nGreat interest was manifested in the proceedings yesterday, and the\r\nhall was densely crowded during the day and evening. Much difficulty\r\nwas found in getting out of the Convention after the adjournment. Each\r\nlady covered at least three steps of the stairway with her dress, and\r\nlittle groups of ladies gathered in the passage-ways and went through\r\nthe ceremony of shaking hands and kissing each other, as though they\r\nhad been separated for years and never expected to meet again. This\r\noperates as a serious obstacle, and we noticed some ladies exhibiting\r\na petulant spirit in being jostled by the crowd which they themselves\r\nhad occasioned, as their dresses were torn and soiled by the feet of\r\nthose who were using their utmost efforts to keep the crowd from\r\npushing them all down-stairs together. This is a great annoyance to\r\nthose who are not fond of going through the world at the slow and\r\nsteady pace of a fashionable lady, and we suggest the practice of\r\nmaking the outside of the hall a place for retailing gossip. Those who\r\nsweep the dirty stairway with their dresses should don the Bloomer\r\ncostume without delay.\r\n\r\n_The Star_, belonging to that portion of the press called \"the\r\nSatanic,\" held to its original character while speaking of the\r\nConvention. It was through this paper that Reverends Sunderland and\r\nAshley made public their sermons against Woman's Rights.\r\n\r\n                    _The Star, September 10th._\r\n\r\nThe women at the Tomfoolery Convention now being held in this city,\r\ntalk as fluently of the Bible and God's teachings in their speeches,\r\nas if they could draw an argument from inspiration in maintenance of\r\ntheir Woman's Rights stuff.... The poor creatures who take part in the\r\nsilly rant of \"brawling women\" and Aunt Nancy men, are most of them\r\n\"ismizers\" of the rankest stamp, Abolitionists of the most frantic and\r\ncontemptible kind, and Christian(?) sympathizers with such heretics as\r\nWm. Lloyd Garrison, Parker Pillsbury, C. C. Burleigh, and S. S.\r\nFoster. These men are all Woman's Righters, and preachers of such\r\ndamnable doctrines and accursed heresies, as would make demons of the\r\npit shudder to hear.\r\n\r\nWe have selected a few appropriate passages from God's Bible for the\r\nconsideration of the infuriated gang (Bloomers and all) at the\r\nConvention: Gen. iii. 16; Tit. ii. 4, 5; Prov. ix. 13, xxi. 9,19; 1\r\nCor. xi. 8, 9; 1 Tim. ii. 8-14; 1 Cor. xiv. 34, 35; Eph. v. 23-24.\r\n\r\n                     _Daily Star, Sept. 11th._\r\n\r\nOur usual amount of editorial matter is again crowded out this morning\r\nby the extreme quantity of gabble the Woman's Righters got off\r\nyesterday. Perhaps we owe an apology for having given publicity to the\r\nmass of corruption, heresies, ridiculous nonsense, and reeking\r\nvulgarities which these bad women have vomited forth for the past\r\nthree days. Our personal preference would have been to have entirely\r\ndisregarded these folks _per signe de mepris_, but the public\r\nappetite cries for these novelties and eccentricities of the times,\r\nand the daily press is expected to gratify such appetites;\r\nfurthermore, we are of opinion that reporting such a Convention as\r\nthis, is the most effectual way of checking the mischief it might\r\notherwise do. The proceedings of these three days' pow-wow are a most\r\nshocking commentary upon themselves, and awaken burning scorn for the\r\nparticipants in them.\r\n\r\nThe Convention adjourned _sine die_ last evening at ten o'clock, and,\r\nfor the credit of our city, we hope its members will adjourn out of\r\ntown as soon as possible, and stay so adjourned, unless they can come\r\namong us for more respectable business. Syracuse has become a by-word\r\nall through the country because of the influence which goes out from\r\nthese foolish Conventions held here, and it is high time that we\r\nshould be looking after our good name.\r\n\r\nWhen the pamphlet report of the Convention's proceedings appeared,\r\n_The Star_ said:\r\n\r\nIt gives the written speeches quite full, but only the skeleton of the\r\nspoken ones, which in reality constituted the cream of the affair....\r\nThis portion of the world's history in relation to these agitating\r\nquestions, is very appropriately treated upon by the Lord Himself:\r\n\"_The sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them for fear,\r\nand for looking after those things which are coming on earth; for the\r\npower of heaven shall be shaken_.\" We recognize the sea as symbolizing\r\nthe ideas which are drifted over the earth's surface, and the waves\r\nroaring, the agitating topics which the times have brought upon us.\r\n\r\n\r\n        _The New York Herald_ (editorial), _Sept. 12, 1852_.\r\n\r\n     THE WOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION--THE LAST ACT OF THE DRAMA.\r\n\r\nThe farce at Syracuse has been played out. We publish to-day the last\r\nact, in which it will be seen that the authority of the Bible, as a\r\nperfect rule of faith and practice for human beings, was voted down,\r\nand what are called the laws of nature set up instead of the Christian\r\ncode. We have also a practical exhibition of the consequences that\r\nflow from woman leaving her true sphere where she wields all her\r\ninfluence, and coming into public to discuss questions of morals and\r\npolitics with men. The scene in which Rev. Mr. Hatch violated the\r\ndecorum of his cloth, and was coarsely offensive to such ladies\r\npresent as had not lost that modest \"feminine element,\" on which he\r\ndwelt so forcibly, is the natural result of the conduct of the women\r\nthemselves, who, in the first place, invited discussion about sexes;\r\nand in the second place, so broadly defined the difference between the\r\nmale and the female, as to be suggestive of anything but purity to the\r\naudience. The women of the Convention have no right to complain; but,\r\nfor the sake of his clerical character, if no other motive influenced\r\nhim, he ought not to have followed so bad an example. His speech was\r\nsound and his argument conclusive, but his form of words was not in\r\nthe best taste. The female orators were the aggressors; but, to use\r\nhis own language, he ought not to have measured swords with a woman,\r\nespecially when he regarded her ideas and expressions as bordering\r\nupon the obscene. But all this is the natural result of woman placing\r\nherself in a false position. As the Rev. Mr. Hatch observed, if she\r\nran with horses she must expect to be betted upon. The whole tendency\r\nof these Conventions is by no means to increase the influence of\r\nwoman, to elevate her condition, or to command the respect of the\r\nother sex.\r\n\r\nWho are these women? what do they want? what are the motives that\r\nimpel them to this course of action? The _dramatis personæ_ of the\r\nfarce enacted at Syracuse present a curious conglomeration of both\r\nsexes. Some of them are old maids, whose personal charms were never\r\nvery attractive, and who have been sadly slighted by the masculine\r\ngender in general; some of them women who have been badly mated, whose\r\nown temper, or their husbands, has made life anything but agreeable to\r\nthem, and they are therefore down upon the whole of the opposite sex;\r\nsome, having so much of the virago in their disposition, that nature\r\nappears to have made a mistake in their gender--mannish women, like\r\nhens that crow; some of boundless vanity and egotism, who believe that\r\nthey are superior in intellectual ability to \"all the world and the\r\nrest of mankind,\" and delight to see their speeches and addresses in\r\nprint; and man shall be consigned to his proper sphere--nursing the\r\nbabies, washing the dishes, mending stockings, and sweeping the\r\nhouse. This is \"the good time coming.\" Besides the classes we have\r\nenumerated, there is a class of wild enthusiasts and visionaries--very\r\nsincere, but very mad--having the same vein as the fanatical\r\nAbolitionists, and the majority, if not all of them, being, in point\r\nof fact, deeply imbued with the anti-slavery sentiment. Of the male\r\nsex who attend these Conventions for the purpose of taking a part in\r\nthem, the majority are hen-pecked husbands, and all of them ought to\r\nwear petticoats.\r\n\r\nIn point of ability, the majority of the women are flimsy, flippant,\r\nand superficial. Mrs. Rose alone indicates much argumentative power.\r\n\r\nHow did woman first become subject to man as she now is all over the\r\nworld? By her nature, her sex, just as the negro is and always will\r\nbe, to the end of time, inferior to the white race, and, therefore,\r\ndoomed to subjection; but happier than she would be in any other\r\ncondition, just because it is the law of her nature. The women\r\nthemselves would not have this law reversed. It is a significant fact\r\nthat even Mrs. Swisshelm, who formerly ran about to all such\r\ngatherings from her husband, is now \"a keeper at home,\" and condemns\r\nthese Conventions in her paper. How does this happen? Because, after\r\nweary years of unfruitfulness, she has at length got her rights in the\r\nshape of a baby. This is the best cure for the mania, and we would\r\nrecommend a trial of it to all who are afflicted.\r\n\r\nWhat do the leaders of the Woman's Rights Convention want? They want\r\nto vote, and to hustle with the rowdies at the polls. They want to be\r\nmembers of Congress, and in the heat of debate to subject themselves\r\nto coarse jests and indecent language, like that of Rev. Mr. Hatch.\r\nThey want to fill all other posts which men are ambitious to\r\noccupy--to be lawyers, doctors, captains of vessels, and generals in\r\nthe field. How funny it would sound in the newspapers, that Lucy\r\nStone, pleading a cause, took suddenly ill in the pains of\r\nparturition, and perhaps gave birth to a fine bouncing boy in court!\r\nOr that Rev. Antoinette Brown was arrested in the middle of her sermon\r\nin the pulpit from the same cause, and presented a \"pledge\" to her\r\nhusband and the congregation; or, that Dr. Harriot K. Hunt, while\r\nattending a gentleman patient for a fit of the gout or _fistula in\r\nano_, found it necessary to send for a doctor, there and then, and to\r\nbe delivered of a man or woman child--perhaps twins. A similar event\r\nmight happen on the floor of Congress, in a storm at sea, or in the\r\nraging tempest of battle, and then what is to become of the woman\r\nlegislator?\r\n\r\n\r\nWORLD'S TEMPERANCE CONVENTION.\r\n\r\nCOMMENTS OF THE PRESS.\r\n\r\n   \"_The New York Herald_\" (editorial article), _September 9, 1853_.\r\n\r\n.... \"We are at length--praised be the stars!--drawing to the\r\ntermination of the clamorous conventions, which have kept the city in\r\na state of ferment and agitation, excitement and fun, for the past two\r\nweeks....\r\n\r\n\"The World's Temperance Convention commenced its sittings on Tuesday,\r\nand is still in session. This organization was calculated to effect\r\nmuch good, had it not been leavened with the elements of discord,\r\nwhich had brought contempt and ridicule on that of the 'Whole World.'\r\nThe Rev. Miss Antoinette Brown cast the brand of disorder into it, by\r\npresenting herself as a delegate from the other association. This was\r\na virtual declaration of Woman's Rights, and a resolute effort to have\r\nthem recognized by the Convention. Neal Dow, as President and as a man\r\nof gallantry, decided on receiving Miss Antoinette's credentials, and\r\nfor a time victory appeared to smile on the Amazons. The triumph,\r\nhowever, was only ephemeral and illusive. The motion was put and\r\ncarried that none but the officers and invited guests of the\r\nConvention should be permitted to occupy places on the platform, and\r\nso, by this indirect movement, Miss Brown saw herself, in the moment\r\nof her brightest hopes, expelled from the stage, and once more the\r\nAnti-Woman's Righters were in the ascendancy.\r\n\r\n\"This was on Tuesday. Next day another stormy scene, arising from the\r\nsame cause, was enacted. The meek, temperate Dow--the light of the\r\nreformation, the apostle of the Maine Liquor Law, the President of the\r\nWorld's Temperance Convention--no longer able to control the stormy\r\nelements which had developed themselves in the council, resolved by a\r\n_coup d'état_ to give the world an instance of his temperate demeanor\r\nand of the liberality of the reformers, and accordingly directed the\r\npolice officers in attendance to clear the hall. The order was\r\nenforced, and even Miss Antoinette Brown, notwithstanding she was the\r\nbearer of credentials, was compelled to evacuate with the rest of the\r\nthrong, and leave Metropolitan Hall to the quiet and peaceful\r\npossession of the male delegates to the World's Temperance Convention.\r\nThus harmony was restored in that obstreperous assembly.\r\n\r\n\"'They made a solitude, and called it peace.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                   \"_Herald,\" September 10, 1853_.\r\n\r\n.... \"Thus stands the case, then. This World's Temperance, or Maine\r\nLaw Convention, headed by Neal Dow, the founder of the aforesaid\r\nstatute, has turned adrift the Woman's Rights party, male and female,\r\nblack and white, the Socialists, the Amalgamationists, the Infidels,\r\nthe Vegetarians, and the Free Colored Americans ... What is to follow\r\nfrom these proceedings, excluding Miss Brown, Phillips, Douglass, and\r\nSmith from the holy cause of temperance? Agitation? Of course. What\r\nelse? Very likely a separate Maine Law coalition movement, comprising\r\nthe Abolitionists, the strong-minded women, and Free Colored Americans\r\nall over the North, in opposition to Neal Dow and the orthodox Maine\r\nLaw party. Thus the house will be divided--is, indeed, already\r\ndivided--against itself. What then? The Scriptures say that such a\r\nhouse can't stand. It can't. And thus the Maine Law is crippled in a\r\nmiserable squabble with fugitive slaves, Bloomers, and Abolitionists.\r\nHow strange! Great country this, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"_National Democrat,\" September 5_ (Rev. Chauncey C. Burr, editor).\r\n\r\n\"Time was when a full-blooded nigger meeting in New York would have\r\nbeen heralded with the cry of 'Tar and feathers!' but, alas! in these\r\ndegenerate days, we are called to lament only over an uproarious\r\ndisturbance. _The Tribune_ groans horribly, it is true, because a set\r\nof deistical fanatics were interrupted in their villainous orgies; but\r\nit should rather rejoice that no harsher means were resorted to than\r\n'tufts of grass.' Talk about freedom! Is any land so lost in\r\nself-respect--so sunk in infamy--that God-defying, Bible-abhorring\r\nsacrilege will be civilly allowed? Because the bell-wether of _The\r\nTribune_, accompanied by a phalanx of blue petticoats, is installed as\r\nthe grand-master of outrages, is that any reason for personal respect\r\nand public humiliation? In view of all the aggravating circumstances\r\nof the case, we congratulate the foolhardy fanatics on getting off as\r\neasy as they did; and we commend the forbearance of the considerate\r\ncrowd in not carrying their coercive measures to extremes, because,\r\nthe humbug being exploded, all that is necessary now is to laugh,\r\nhiss, and vociferously applaud. When men make up their minds to vilify\r\nthe Bible, denounce the Constitution, and defame their country\r\n(although this is a free country), they should go down in some obscure\r\ncellar, remote from mortal ken, and, even there, whisper their hideous\r\ntreason against God and liberty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMOB CONVENTION, 1853.\r\n\r\n1. _Resolved_, That this movement for the rights of woman makes no\r\nattempt to decide whether woman is better or worse than man, neither\r\naffirms nor denies the equality of her intellect with that of\r\nman--makes no pretense of protecting woman--does not seek to oblige\r\nwoman any more than man is now obliged, to vote, take office, labor in\r\nthe professions, mingle in public life, or manage her own property.\r\n\r\n2. _Resolved_, That what we do seek is to gain these rights and\r\nprivileges for those women who wish to enjoy them, and so to change\r\npublic opinion that it shall not be deemed indecorous for women to\r\nengage in any occupation which they deem fitted to their habits and\r\ntalents.\r\n\r\n3. _Resolved_, That the fundamental principle of the Woman's Rights\r\nmovement is--that every human being, without distinction of sex, has\r\nan inviolable right to the full development and free exercise of all\r\nenergies; and that in every sphere of life, private and public,\r\nFunctions should always be commensurate with Powers.\r\n\r\n4. _Resolved_, That each human being is the sole judge of his or her\r\nsphere, and entitled to choose a profession without interference from\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n5. _Resolved_, That whatever differences exist between Man and Woman,\r\nin the quality or measure of their powers, are originally designed to\r\nbe and should become bonds of union and means of co-operation in the\r\ndischarge of all functions, alike private and public.\r\n\r\n6. _Resolved_, That the monopoly of the elective franchise, and\r\nthereby of all the powers of legislation and government, by men,\r\nsolely on the ground of sex, is a monstrous usurpation--condemned\r\nalike by reason and common-sense, subversive of all the principles of\r\njustice, oppressive and demoralizing in its operations, and insulting\r\nto the dignity of human nature.\r\n\r\n7. _Resolved_, That we see no force in the objection, that woman's\r\ntaking part in politics would be a fruitful source of domestic\r\ndissension; since experience shows that she may be allowed to choose\r\nher own faith and sect without any such evil result, though religious\r\ndisputes are surely as bitter as political--and if the objection be\r\nsound, we ought to go further, and oblige a wife to forego all\r\nreligious opinions, or to adopt the religious as well as the political\r\ncreed of her husband.\r\n\r\n8. _Resolved_, That women, like men, must be either self-supported and\r\nself-governed, or dependent and enslaved; that an unobstructed and\r\ngeneral participation in all the branches of productive industry, and\r\nin all the business functions and offices of common life, is at once\r\ntheir natural right, their individual interest, and their public duty;\r\nthe claim and the obligation reciprocally supporting each other; that\r\nthe idleness of the rich, with its attendant physical debility, moral\r\nlaxity, passional intemperance and mental dissipation, and the\r\nignorance, wretchedness, and enforced profligacy of the poor, which\r\nare everywhere the curse and reproach of the sex, are the necessary\r\nresults of their exclusion from those diversified employments which\r\nwould otherwise furnish them with useful occupation, and reward them\r\nwith its profits, honors, and blessings, that this enormous wrong\r\ncries for redress, for reparation by those whose delinquency allows\r\nits continuance.\r\n\r\n_Whereas_, The energies of Man are always in proportion to the\r\nmagnitude of the objects to be obtained; and, whereas, it requires the\r\nhighest motive for the greatest exertion and noblest action;\r\ntherefore,\r\n\r\n9. _Resolved_, That Woman must be recognized politically, legally,\r\nsocially, and religiously the equal of man, and all the obstructions\r\nto her highest physical, intellectual, and moral culture and\r\ndevelopment be removed, that she may have the highest motive to assume\r\nher place in that sphere of action and usefulness which her capacities\r\nenable her to fill.\r\n\r\n10. _Resolved_, That this movement gives to the cause of education a\r\nnew motive and impulse; makes a vast stride toward the settlement of\r\nthe question of wages and social reform; goes far to cure that\r\nwidespread plague--the licentiousness of cities; adds to civilization\r\na new element of progress; and in all these respects commends itself\r\nas one of the greatest reforms of the age.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST APPEAL OF 1854.\r\n\r\nWOMAN'S RIGHTS.--CIRCULATE THE PETITION.\r\n\r\nThe Albany Woman's Rights Convention, held in February last, resolved\r\nto continue the work of Petitioning our State Legislature, from year\r\nto year, until the law of Justice and Equality shall be dispensed to\r\nthe whole people, without distinction of sex.\r\n\r\nIn order to systematize and facilitate the labors of the friends who\r\nshall engage in the work of circulating the Petitions, a Committee was\r\nappointed to devise and present some definite plan of action. In the\r\nestimation of that Committee, the first and most important work to be\r\ndone is to enlighten the people as to the real claims of the Woman's\r\nRights Movement, thereby dispelling their many prejudices, and\r\nsecuring their hearty good-will. To aid in the accomplishment of this\r\nfirst great object, the Committee purpose holding Woman's Rights\r\nMeetings in all the cities and many of the larger villages of the\r\nState, during the coming fall and winter, and gladly, could they\r\ncommand the services of Lecturing Agents, would they thoroughly\r\ncanvass the entire State. But, since to do so is impossible, they\r\nwould urge upon the friends in every county, town, village, and\r\nschool district, to hold public meetings in their respective\r\nlocalities, and, if none among their own citizens feel themselves\r\ncompetent to address the people, invite speakers from abroad. Let the\r\nquestion be fully and freely discussed, both pro and con, by both\r\nfriends and opponents.\r\n\r\nThough the living speaker can not visit every hearthstone throughout\r\nthe length and breadth of the Empire State, and personally present the\r\nclaims of our cause to the hearts and consciences of those who\r\nsurround them, his arguments, by the aid of the invaluable art of\r\nprinting, may. Therefore the Committee have resolved to circulate as\r\nwidely as possible the written statement of Woman's Political and\r\nLegal Rights, as contained in the Address written by Elizabeth Cady\r\nStanton, of Seneca Falls, N. Y., and adopted by the Albany\r\nConvention--presented to our Legislature at its last session. This\r\nAddress has been highly spoken of by many of the best papers in the\r\nState, and pronounced, by eminent lawyers and statesmen, an able and\r\nunanswerable argument. And the Committee, being fully confident of its\r\npower to convince every candid inquirer after truth of the justice and\r\nmercy of our claims, do urgently call upon the friends everywhere to\r\naid them in giving to it a thorough circulation.\r\n\r\nThere is no reform question of the day that meets so ready, so full,\r\nso deep a response from the masses, as does this Woman's Rights\r\nquestion. To ensure a speedy triumph, we have only to take earnest\r\nhold of the work of disseminating its immutable truths. Let us, then,\r\nagitate the question, hold public meetings, widely circulate Woman's\r\nRights Tracts, and show to the world that we are in earnest--that we\r\nwill be heard--that our demands stop not short of justice and perfect\r\nequality to every human being. Let us, at least, see to it, that this\r\nadmirable Address of Mrs. Stanton is placed in the hands of every\r\nintelligent man and woman in the State, and thus the way prepared for\r\nthe gathering up of a mighty host of names to our petitions to be\r\npresented to our next Legislature, a mammoth roll, that shall cause\r\nour law-makers to know that the People are with us, and that if our\r\nprayer be not wisely and justly answered by them, other and truer\r\nrepresentatives will fill those Legislative Halls.\r\n\r\nThe success of our first appeal to our Legislature, made last winter,\r\nencourages us to persevere. That the united prayer of only 6,000 men\r\nand women should cause the reporting and subsequent passage in the\r\nHouse, of a bill granting two of our most special claims--that of the\r\nwife to her earnings, and the mother to her children--is indeed a\r\nresult the most sanguine scarce dared to hope for. What may we not\r\nexpect from our next appeal, that shall be 20,000, nay, more, if we\r\nbut be faithful, 100,000 strong. To the work, then, friends, of\r\nrenovating public sentiment and circulating petitions. There is no\r\ntime to be lost. Our Fourth of July gatherings will afford an\r\nopportunity for both distributing the Address and circulating the\r\npetitions. And, Women of the Empire State, it is for you to do the\r\nwork, it is for you to shake from your feet the dust of tyrant custom,\r\nit is for you to remember that \"he who would be free must himself\r\nstrike the blow.\"\r\n\r\nThe petitions to be circulated are the same as last year--one asking\r\nfor the JUST AND EQUAL RIGHTS OF WOMEN, and the other for WOMAN'S\r\nRIGHT OF SUFFRAGE. The petitions are to be signed by both men and\r\nwomen, the men's names placed in the right column, and the women's in\r\nthe left. All intelligent persons must be ready and willing to sign\r\nthe first, asking a revision of the laws relative to the property\r\nrights of women, and surely no true republican can refuse to give his\r\nor her name to the second, asking for woman the Right of\r\nRepresentation--a practical application of the great principles of\r\n'76.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that there shall be one person in each county to whom\r\nall the petitions circulated in its several towns, villages, and\r\nschool districts, shall be forwarded, and who shall arrange and attach\r\nthem in one roll, stating upon a blank sheet, placed between the\r\npetition and the signatures, the number of signers, the name of the\r\ncounty, and the number of towns represented, and forward them as early\r\nas the 1st of December next, to Susan B. Anthony, Rochester, N. Y.\r\nWhere no person volunteers, or is appointed such county agent, the\r\npetitions, properly labeled, may be sent directly to Rochester.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton's Address is published in neat pamphlet form, in large\r\ntype, and may be had at the following prices: $2 per 100, 37-1/2 cts.\r\nper dozen; or if sent by mail, $3 per 100, and 50 cts. per dozen.\r\nPackages of over 25 may be sent by express to all places on the line\r\nof the railroads at a less cost than by mail.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that every person who reads this notice, and feels an\r\ninterest in the universal diffusion of the true aim and object of the\r\nWoman's Rights agitation, will, without delay, order copies of this\r\naddress to distribute gratuitously or otherwise, among their neighbors\r\nand townsmen. Should there be any wishing to aid in this work, who can\r\nnot command the money necessary to purchase the Address, their orders\r\nwill be cheerfully complied with free of charge.\r\n\r\nThe Committee have on hand a variety of Woman's Rights Tracts, written\r\nby S. J. May, Wendell Phillips, Elizabeth C. Stanton, Mrs. C. I. H.\r\nNichols, Ernestine L. Rowe, T. W. Higginson, and others. Also, the\r\nReports of the several National Woman's Rights Conventions, all of\r\nwhich may be had at very low prices.\r\n\r\nAll correspondence and orders for Address, petitions, etc., should be\r\naddressed to\r\n\r\n                    SUSAN B. ANTHONY, General Agent, Rochester, N. Y.\r\n\r\n_June 22, 1854_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND APPEAL OF 1854.\r\n\r\n_To the Women of the State of New York:_\r\n\r\nWe purpose again this winter to send petitions to our State\r\nLegislature--one, asking for the Just and Equal Rights of Woman, and\r\none for Woman's Right of Suffrage. The latter, we think, covers the\r\nwhole ground, for we can never be said to have just and equal rights\r\nuntil the right of suffrage is ours. Some who will gladly sign the\r\nformer may shrink from making the last demand. But be assured, our\r\ncause can never rest on a safe, enduring basis, until we get the right\r\nof suffrage. So long as we have no voice in the laws, we have no\r\nguarantee that privileges granted us to-day by one body of men, may\r\nnot be taken from us to-morrow by another.\r\n\r\nAll man's laws, his theology, his daily life, go to prove the fixed\r\nidea in his mind of the entire difference in the sexes--a difference\r\nso broad that what would be considered cruel and unjust between man\r\nand man, is kind and just between man and woman. Having discarded the\r\nidea of the oneness of the sexes, how can man judge of the needs and\r\nwants of a being so wholly unlike himself? How can he make laws for\r\nhis own benefit and woman's too at the same time? He can not. He never\r\nhas, as all his laws relative to woman most clearly show. But when man\r\nshall fully grasp the idea that woman is a being of like feelings,\r\nthoughts, and passions with himself, he may be able to legislate for\r\nher, as one code would answer for both. But until then, a sense of\r\njustice, a wise self-love, impels us to demand a voice in his\r\ncouncils.\r\n\r\nTo every intelligent, thinking woman, we put the question, On what\r\nsound principles of jurisprudence, constitutional law, or human\r\nrights, are one-half of the people of this State disfranchised? If you\r\nanswer, as you must, that it is done in violation of all law, then we\r\nask you, when and how is this great wrong to be righted? We say now;\r\nand petitioning is the first step in its accomplishment. We hope,\r\ntherefore, that every woman in the State will sign her name to the\r\npetitions. It is humiliating to know that many educated women so\r\nstultify their consciences as to declare that they have all the rights\r\nthey want. Have you who make this declaration ever read the barbarous\r\nlaws in reference to woman, to mothers, to wives, and to daughters,\r\nwhich disgrace our Statute Books? Laws which are not surpassed in\r\ncruelty and injustice by any slaveholding code in the United States;\r\nlaws which strike at the root of the glorious doctrine for which\r\nour fathers fought and bled and died, \"no taxation without\r\nrepresentation\"; laws which deny a right most sacredly observed by\r\nmany of the monarchies of Europe--\"the right of trial by a jury of\r\none's own peers\"; laws which trample on the holiest and most unselfish\r\nof all human affections--a mother's love for her child--and with\r\nruthless cruelty snap asunder the tenderest ties; laws which enable\r\nthe father, be he a man or a minor, to tear the infant from the\r\nmother's arms and send it, if he chooses, to the Feejee Islands--yea,\r\nto will the guardianship of the _unborn_ child to whomsoever he may\r\nplease, whether to the Sultan of Turkey or the Imam of Muscat; laws by\r\nwhich our sons and daughters may be bound to service to cancel their\r\nfather's debts of _honor_, in the meanest rum-holes and brothels in\r\nthe vast metropolis; laws which violate all that is most pure and\r\nsacred in the marriage relation, by giving to the cruel, beastly\r\ndrunkard the rights of a man, a husband, and father; laws which place\r\nthe life-long earnings of the wife at the disposal of the husband, be\r\nhis character what it may; laws which leave us at the mercy of the\r\nrum-seller and the drunkard, against whom we have no protection for\r\nour lives, our children, or our homes; laws by which we are made the\r\nwatch-dogs to keep a million and a half of our sisters in the foulest\r\nbondage the sun ever shone upon--which forbid us to give food and\r\nshelter to the panting fugitive from the land of slavery.\r\n\r\nIf, in view of laws like these, there be women in this State so lost\r\nto self-respect, to all that is virtuous, noble, and true, as to\r\nrefuse to raise their voices in protest against such degrading\r\ntyranny, we can only say of that system which has thus robbed\r\nwomanhood of all its glory and greatness, what the immortal Channing\r\ndid of slavery, \"If,\" said he, \"it be true that the slaves are\r\ncontented and happy--if there is a system that can blot out all love\r\nof freedom from the soul of man, destroy every trace of his Divinity,\r\nmake him happy in a condition so low and benighted and hopeless, I ask\r\nfor no stronger argument against such a slavery as ours.\" No! never\r\nbelieve it; woman falsifies herself and blasphemes her God, when in\r\nview of her present social, legal, and political position, she\r\ndeclares she has all the rights she wants. If a few drops of Saxon\r\nblood gave our Frederick Douglass such a clear perception of his\r\nhumanity, his inalienable rights, as to enable him, with the\r\nslaveholder's Bible, the slaveholder's Constitution, a Southern public\r\nsentiment and education all laid heavy on his shoulders, to stand\r\nupright and walk forth in search of freedom, with as much ease as did\r\nSamson of old with the massive gates of the city, shall we, the\r\ndaughters of our Hancocks and Adamses, we in whose veins flow the\r\nblood of the Pilgrim Fathers, shall we never try the strength of these\r\nwithes of law and gospel with which in our blindness we have been\r\nbound hand and foot? Yes, the time has come.\r\n\r\n          \"The slumber is broken, the sleeper is risen,\r\n    The day of the Goth and the Vandal is o'er.\r\n    And old Earth feels the tread of Freedom once more.\"\r\n\r\nFail not, Women of the Empire State, to swell our Petitions. Let no\r\nreligious scruples hold you back. Take no heed to man's interpretation\r\nof Paul's injunctions to women. To any thinking mind, there is no\r\ndifficulty in explaining those passages of the Apostle as applicable\r\nto the times in which they were written, as having no reference\r\nwhatever to the Women of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\"Honor the King,\" heroes of '76! Those leaden tea-chests of Boston\r\nHarbor cry out, \"Render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's.\" When\r\nthe men of 1854, with their Priests and Rabbis, shall rebuke the\r\ndisobedience of their forefathers--when they shall cease to set at\r\ndefiance the British lion and the Apostle Paul in their National\r\nPolicy, then it will be time enough for us to bow down to man's\r\ninterpretation of law touching our social relations, and acknowledge\r\nthat God gave us powers and rights, merely that we might show forth\r\nour faith in Him by being helpless and dumb.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Paul, like our State Constitutions, are susceptible of\r\nvarious interpretations. But when the human soul is roused with holy\r\nindignation against injustice and oppression, it stops not to\r\ntranslate human parchments, but follows out the law of its inner\r\nbeing, written by the finger of God in the first hour of its creation.\r\n\r\nOur Petitions will be sent to every county in the State, and we hope\r\nthat they will find at least ten righteous Women to circulate them.\r\nBut should there be any county so benighted that a petition can not be\r\ncirculated throughout its length and breadth, giving to every man and\r\nwoman an opportunity to sign their names, then we pray, not that \"God\r\nwill send down fire and brimstone\" upon it, but that the \"Napoleon\" of\r\nthis movement will flood it with Woman's Rights Tracts and\r\nMissionaries.\r\n\r\n                                   ELIZABETH CADY STANTON,\r\n                    _Chairman N.

B.--All orders for forms of Petitions and Woman's Rights Tracts,\r\nand all communications relating to the movement in this State, should\r\nbe addressed to our General Agent, Susan B. Anthony, Rochester, N. Y.\r\nLet the Petitions be returned, as soon as possible, to Lydia Mott,\r\nAlbany, N. Y., as we wish to present them early in the session, and\r\nthereby give our Legislature due time for the consideration of this\r\nimportant question.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL WOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION, COOPER INSTITUTE, 1856.\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM MRS. STANTON.\r\n\r\n                                   SENECA FALLS, _November 24, 1856_.\r\n\r\nDEAR LUCY STONE:--We may continue to hold our Conventions, we may talk\r\nof our right to vote, to legislate, to hold property, but until we can\r\narouse in woman a proper self-respect, she will hold in contempt the\r\ndemands we now make for our sex. We shall never get what we ask for\r\nuntil the majority of women are openly with us; and they will never\r\nclaim their civil rights until they know their social wrongs. From\r\ntime to time I put these questions to myself: How is it that woman can\r\nlonger silently consent to her present false position? How can she\r\ncalmly contemplate the barbarous code of laws which govern her civil\r\nand political existence? How can she devoutly subscribe to a theology\r\nwhich makes her the conscientious victim of another's will, forever\r\nsubject to the triple bondage of the man, the priest, and the law? How\r\ncan she tolerate our social customs, by which womankind is stripped of\r\nall true virtue, dignity, and nobility? How can she endure our present\r\nmarriage relations, by which woman's life, health, and happiness are\r\nheld so cheap, that she herself feels that God has given her no\r\ncharter of rights, no individuality of her own. I answer, she\r\npatiently bears all this because in her blindness she sees no way of\r\nescape. Her bondage, though it differs from that of the negro slave,\r\nfrets and chafes her just the same. She too sighs and groans in her\r\nchains; and lives but in the hope of better things to come. She looks\r\nto heaven; whilst the more philosophical slave sets out for Canada.\r\nLet it be the object of this Convention to show that there is hope for\r\nwoman this side of heaven, and that there is a work for her to do\r\nbefore she leaves for the celestial city.\r\n\r\nMarriage is a divine institution, intended by God for the greater\r\nfreedom and happiness of both parties--whatever therefore conflicts\r\nwith woman's happiness is not legitimate to that relation. Woman has\r\nyet to learn that she has a right to be happy in and of herself; that\r\nshe has a right to the free use, improvement, and development of all\r\nher faculties, for her own benefit and pleasure. The woman is greater\r\nthan the wife or the mother; and in consenting to take upon herself\r\nthese relations, she should never sacrifice one iota of her\r\nindividuality to any senseless conventionalisms, or false codes of\r\nfeminine delicacy and refinement.\r\n\r\nMarriage, as we now have it, is opposed to all God's laws. It is by no\r\nmeans an equal partnership. The silent partner loses everything. On\r\nthe domestic sign, the existence of a second person is not recognized\r\nby even the ordinary abbreviation, Co. There is the establishment of\r\nJohn Jones. Perhaps his partner supplies all the cents and the\r\nsenses--but no one knows who she is or whence she came. If John is a\r\nluminous body, she shines in his reflection; if not, she hides herself\r\nin his shadow. But she is nameless, for a woman has no name! She is\r\nMrs. John or James, Peter or Paul, just as she changes masters; like\r\nthe Southern slave, she takes the name of her owner. Many people\r\nconsider this a very small matter; but it is the symbol of the most\r\ncursed monopoly on this footstool; a monopoly by man of all the\r\nrights, the life, the liberty, and happiness of one-half of the human\r\nfamily--all womankind. For what man can honestly deny that he has not\r\na secret feeling that where his pleasure and woman's seems to\r\nconflict, the woman must be sacrificed; and what is worse, woman\r\nherself has come to think so too. She believes that all she tastes of\r\njoy in life is from the generosity and benevolence of man; and the\r\nbitter cup of sorrow, which she too often drinks to the very dregs, is\r\nof the good providence of God, sent by a kind hand for her improvement\r\nand development. This sentiment pervades the laws, customs, and\r\nreligions of all countries, both Christian and heathen. Is it any\r\nwonder, then, that woman regards herself as a mere machine, a tool for\r\nmen's pleasure? Verily is she a hopeless victim of his morbidly\r\ndeveloped passions. But, thank God, she suffers not alone! Man too\r\npays the penalty of his crimes in his enfeebled mind, dwarfed body,\r\nand the shocking monstrosities of his deformed and crippled offspring.\r\n\r\nCall yourselves Christian women, you who sacrifice all that is great\r\nand good for an ignoble peace, who betray the best interests of the\r\nrace for a temporary ease? It were nobler far to go and throw\r\nyourselves into the Ganges than to curse the earth with a miserable\r\nprogeny, conceived in disgust and brought forth in agony. What mean\r\nthese asylums all over the land for the deaf and dumb, the maim and\r\nblind, the idiot and the raving maniac? What all these advertisements\r\nin our public prints, these family guides, these female medicines,\r\nthese Madame Restells? Do not all these things show to what a depth of\r\ndegradation the women of this Republic have fallen, how false they\r\nhave been to the holy instincts of their nature, to the sacred trust\r\ngiven them by God as the mothers of the race? Let Christians and\r\nmoralists pause in their efforts at reform, and let some scholar teach\r\nthem how to apply the laws of science to human life. Let us but use as\r\nmuch care and forethought in producing the highest order of\r\nintelligence, as we do in raising a cabbage or a calf, and in a few\r\ngenerations we shall reap an abundant harvest of giants, scholars, and\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\nThe first step in this improvement is the elevation of woman. She is\r\nthe protector of national virtue; the rightful lawgiver in all our\r\nmost sacred relations.\r\n\r\n                                   Yours truly,\r\n                                           ELIZABETH CADY STANTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM N. H. WHITING.\r\n\r\n                              MARSHFIELD, MASS., _September 29, 1856_.\r\n\r\nDEAR FRIEND:--I do not see that I can do much to aid you in your\r\neffort for self-emancipation from the injustice your sex encounters in\r\nthe present social and political arrangements of the world. You know\r\nthe old maxim, \"The gods help them who help themselves.\" This is true\r\nof all times and circumstances. The two inevitable conditions that are\r\nfound in, and are essential to all bondage, are the spirit of\r\noppression, the desire to exercise unlawful dominion on the one side,\r\nand ignorance, servility, the willingness, if not the desire to be\r\nenslaved on the other. The absence of either is fatal to the existence\r\nof the thing itself.\r\n\r\nI apprehend the principal thing you want from our sex, as a\r\npreliminary to your growth and equal position in the great struggle of\r\nlife, is what Diogenes wanted of Alexander, viz., that we shall \"get\r\nout of your sunshine.\" In other words, that we shall remove the\r\nobstacles we have placed in your way. To this end, politically, all\r\nlaws which discriminate between man and woman, to the injury of the\r\nlatter, should at once be blotted out. Women should have an equal\r\nvoice in the creation and administration of that government to which\r\nthey are subject. This will be a fair start in that direction. The\r\nfirst thing to be done, socially, is to so regulate and arrange the\r\nindustrial machinery that women shall have an equal chance to labor in\r\nall the departments, and that the same work shall receive the same pay\r\nwhether done by man or woman. This will do much to clear the track, so\r\nthat all can have a fair chance. This is all you ask, as I take it.\r\nThis you should have. Justice demands it....\r\n\r\nBut, save in the removal of the outward forms of society, which now\r\nenviron and hedge up your way, the active work in all this change in\r\nthe most important human relations must be done by yourselves. \"They\r\nwho would be free, themselves must strike the blow.\" What woman is\r\ncapable of we shall never know until she has a fair chance in the wide\r\narena of universal human life.\r\n\r\nIf the love of frivolity and show and of empty admiration, which now\r\nso generally obtains, is an unfailing characteristic in the female\r\nsex, legislation can not help you. Encouragement, sympathy, can not\r\nhelp you. It is of no use to fight against the eternal laws. But if\r\nthis be only a perversion or misdirection of noble and lovely powers\r\nand faculties, the result of accidental circumstances and vicious\r\ninstitutions, as I believe, then, when the outward pressure is\r\nremoved, the elastic spring of the genuine human spirit, encased in\r\nthe form of woman, shall return; the great curse of civil and domestic\r\nstrife shall cease; the true marriage of the male and female heart can\r\nthen take place, because that perfect equality, under which alone it\r\ncan exist, will be recognized and established.\r\n\r\nYou are engaged in a great work. May you have faith and resolution to\r\ncontinue to the end. It is a long way before you. Man is a plant of\r\nslow growth. His education and development are the work of ages. It is\r\nonly by a landmark extending far back into the dim and misty past we\r\ncan trace his upward path.\r\n\r\nBut though the race grows so slow, and the forward wave is go often\r\npressed backward by the prevailing currents of ignorance,\r\nsuperstition, and oppression, still, it is cheering to know that no\r\ntrue word was ever spoken, or good deed ever done, but it cast some\r\nrays of light into the surrounding darkness, while it gave strength\r\nand vigor to the spirit that sent it forth. That is a grand truth\r\nwhose utterance is attributed to Jesus, \"It is more blessed to give\r\nthan to receive.\" By that gift we may relieve the want of others, but\r\nwe gain far more to ourselves by creating from the chaos of human\r\ncrime and misery a beautiful and godlike act. That act is wrought into\r\nthe fibers of our own individual life, and we are nobler, better,\r\nhappier than before.\r\n\r\nSo you, in the thankless task before you, subject to ribald jest, to\r\nthe cold, heartless sneer, to obloquy and abuse of all sorts from our\r\nand even your sex, who are most immediately to be benefited by your\r\nlabors, will have this great truth to console and stimulate you, that\r\nin every step of this grand procession in which you are marching, you\r\nwill gather rich and substantial food for the sustenance and growth of\r\nyour own mental and moral natures.\r\n\r\n                                   Truly yours,\r\n                                                    N. H. WHITING.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        NEW YORK, _November 25, 1856_.\r\n\r\n_To the Seventh National Woman's Rights Convention_:\r\n\r\nThe central claim for Woman is her right to be, and to do, as well as\r\nto suffer. Allow her everywhere to represent herself and her own\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nCustom and law both deny her this right. If she is too cowardly to\r\ncontend with custom, and to overcome it, let her remain its slave. But\r\nthe law has bound her hand and foot. Here she can not act. The\r\nlaw-makers have forged her chains and riveted them upon her. They\r\nalone can take them off. Shall we not, then, at once demand of\r\nthem--demand of every sovereign State in the Union--the elective\r\nfranchise for woman? With this franchise she can make for herself a\r\ncivil and political equality with man. Without it she is utterly\r\nwithout power to protect herself. She does not need to be protected\r\nlike a child. She does need freedom to use the powers of\r\nself-protection with which her own nature is endowed.\r\n\r\nEach of the several States has its specific laws--statutes and\r\nconstitution--varying in details, but all more or less unjust to her\r\nas wife, mother, property-holder; in short, unjust to her in all her\r\nrelations as citizen. Every State denies to her the right to represent\r\nherself politically. Once give her this, and she can take all the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nWould it not be wholly appropriate, then, for this National Convention\r\nto demand the right of suffrage for her from the Legislature of each\r\nState in the Nation? We can not petition the General Government on\r\nthis point. Allow me, therefore, respectfully to suggest the propriety\r\nof appointing a committee, which shall be instructed to prepare a\r\nmemorial adapted to the circumstances of each legislative body; and\r\ndemanding of each, in the name of this Convention, the elective\r\nfranchise for woman.\r\n\r\nSuch a memorial, presented to the several States during the coming\r\nwinter, could not fail of doing good. It would be pressing home this\r\ngreat question upon all the powers that be in the whole nation; and,\r\nwith comparatively little effort, would, at least, create a healthful\r\nagitation. Who shall say that the just men of some State will not even\r\naccord to us the franchise we claim? With this hint to the wise, I\r\nremain, as ever,\r\n\r\n                              Yours, for equal human rights,\r\n                                     ANTOINETTE L. BROWN BLACKWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. HATTELLE moved that a Committee be at once appointed to draft such\r\na memorial, which was adopted.\r\n\r\nWENDELL PHILLIPS rose to offer as an amendment, that a recommendation\r\ngo forth from this Convention to the women of each State, to\r\ninaugurate their presentation of the subject to their several\r\nLegislatures.\r\n\r\nThomas Wentworth Higginson proposed that the friends of Woman Suffrage\r\nshould publish an almanac each year giving the advance steps in their\r\nmovement. He issued one for 1858, from which we clip the following:\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN'S RIGHTS ALMANAC.\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF WOMAN IN THREE PICTURES.\r\n\r\nI. HINDOO LAWS. 2000 B. C.--\"A man, both day and night, must keep his\r\nwife so much in subjection, that she by no means be mistress of her\r\nown actions. If the wife have her own free-will, notwithstanding she\r\nbe of a superior caste, she will behave amiss.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Creator formed woman for this purpose, that man might have sexual\r\nintercourse with her, and that children might be born from thence.\"\r\n\r\n\"A woman shall never go out of the house without the consent of her\r\nhusband.... and shall act according to the orders of her husband, and\r\nshall pay a proper respect to the Deity, her husband's father, the\r\nspiritual guide, and the guests; and shall not eat until she has\r\nserved them with victuals (if it is physic, she may take it before\r\nthey eat); a woman also shall never go to a stranger's house, and\r\nshall not stand at the door, and must never look out of a window.\"\r\n\r\n\"If a woman, following her own inclinations, goes whithersoever she\r\nchoose, and does not regard the words of her master, such a woman\r\nshall be turned away.\"\r\n\r\n\"If a man goes on a journey, his wife shall not divert herself by\r\nplay, nor shall see any public show, nor shall laugh, nor shall dress\r\nherself with jewels and fine clothes, nor shall see dancing, nor hear\r\nmusic, nor shall sit in the window, nor shall ride out, nor shall\r\nbehold anything choice or rare, but shall fasten well the house-door\r\nand remain private; and shall not eat any dainty victuals, and shall\r\nnot view herself in a mirror; she shall never exercise herself in any\r\nsuch agreeable employment during the absence of her husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is proper for every woman, after her husband's death, to burn\r\nherself in the fire with his corpse.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the following laws scarcely vary at all, in\r\nprinciple, from the preceding:\r\n\r\nII. ANGLO-SAXON LAWS. 1848.--\"By marriage, the husband and wife are\r\none person in law; that is, _the very being or existence of the woman\r\nis suspended during the marriage_, or at least is incorporated and\r\nconsolidated into that of the husband, under whose wing, protection,\r\nand _covert_ she performs everything; and is, therefore, called in our\r\nLaw-French a _feme-covert_, is said to be _covert-baron_, or under the\r\nprotection and influence of her husband, her baron, or lord; and her\r\ncondition during her marriage is called her _coverture_. Upon this\r\nprinciple, of an union of person in husband and wife, depend almost\r\nall the legal rights, duties, and disabilities that either of them\r\nacquire by the marriage.\"--_1 Blackstone Com_., 356.\r\n\r\n\"The husband also, by the old law, might give his wife moderate\r\ncorrection. For, as he is to answer for her misbehavior, the law\r\nthought it reasonable to intrust him with this power of restraining\r\nher by domestic chastisement, in the same moderation that a man is\r\nallowed to correct his apprentices or children. But this power of\r\ncorrection was confined within reasonable bounds, and the husband was\r\nprohibited from using any violence to his wife, _aliter quam ad virum,\r\nex causa regiminis et castigationis uxoris suae licite et\r\nrationabiliter pertinet_ (except as lawfully and reasonably belongs to\r\na husband, for the sake of governing and disciplining his wife). The\r\ncivil law gave the husband the same, or a larger authority over his\r\nwife, allowing him, for some misdemeanors, _flagellis et Fustibus\r\nacriter verberare uxorem_ (to beat his wife severely with whips and\r\ncudgels); for others only _modicam castigationem adhibere_ (to\r\nadminister moderate chastisement). But with us, in the politer reign\r\nof Charles II., this power of correction began to be doubted, and a\r\nwife may now have security of peace against the husband, or, in\r\nreturn, a husband against his wife. Yet the lower rank of people, who\r\nwere always fond of the old common law, still claim and exact their\r\nancient privilege, and the courts of law will still permit a\r\nhusband to restrain a wife of her liberty in case of any gross\r\nmisbehavior.\"--_1 Blackstone_, 366.\r\n\r\n\"The legal effects of marriage are generally deducible from the\r\nprinciple of the common law by which the husband and wife are regarded\r\nas one person, and her legal existence and authority are in a degree\r\nlost or suspended during the continuance of the matrimonial\r\nunion.\"--_2 Kent's Comm. on Am. Law_, 129.\r\n\r\n\"Even now, in countries of the most polished habits, a considerable\r\nlatitude is allowed to marital coercion. In England the husband has\r\nthe right of imposing _such corporal restraints as he may deem\r\nnecessary_, for securing to himself the fulfillment of the obligations\r\nimposed on the wife by virtue of the marriage contract.

JUSTICE COLERIDGE'S JUDGMENT \"_in re Cochrane_.\"--The facts were\r\nbriefly these. A writ of _habeas corpus_ had been granted to the wife,\r\nwho, having been brought into the power of the husband by strategem,\r\nhad since that time been kept in confinement by him. By the return to\r\nthe writ, it appeared that the parties had lived together for about\r\nthree years after their marriage on terms of apparent affection, and\r\nhad two children; that in May, 1836, Mrs. Cochrane withdrew herself\r\nand offspring from his house and protection, and had resided away from\r\nhim against his will, for nearly four years. While absent from her\r\nhusband, Mrs. Cochrane had always resided with her mother, nor was\r\nthere the slightest imputation on her honor. In ordering her to be\r\nrestored to her husband, the learned judge, after stating the question\r\nto be whether by the common law, the husband, in order to prevent his\r\nwife from eloping, _has a right to confine her in his own\r\ndwelling-house, and restrain her from liberty for an indefinite time_,\r\nusing no cruelty nor imposing any hardship or unnecessary restraint on\r\nhis part, and on hers there being no reason from her past conduct to\r\napprehend that she will avail herself of her absence from his control\r\nto injure either his honor or his property, stated, \"_That there could\r\nbe no doubt of the general dominion which the law of England\r\nattributes to the husband over the wife_.\"--_8 Dowling's P. C. 360_.\r\n_Quoted in Westminster Review, Oct., 1856_.\r\n\r\nIII. SIGNS OF THE TIMES. 1857.--It is obvious that the English common\r\nlaw, as above stated, is scarcely a step beyond barbarism. Yet this\r\nlaw remained almost unaltered in the United States, as respects woman,\r\ntill the year 1848--the year of the first local Woman's Rights\r\nConvention, the first National one being held in 1850. Since then\r\nevery year has brought improvements, and even those who denounce the\r\nWoman's Rights Movement, admit the value of these its results.\r\n\r\nThere is near Trenton, says _The Newark Advertiser_, a woman who is a\r\nskillful mechanic. She has made a carriage, and can make a violin or a\r\ngun. She is only 35 years old.\r\n\r\nThis is told as though it were something wonderful for a woman to have\r\nmechanical genius; when the fact is, that there are thousands all over\r\nthe country who would make as good mechanics and handle tools with as\r\nmuch skill and dexterity as men, if they were only allowed to make\r\nmanifest their ingenuity and inclinations. A girl's hands and head are\r\nformed very much like those of a boy, and if put to a trade at the age\r\nwhen boys are usually apprenticed, she will master her business quite\r\nas soon as the boy--be the trade what it may.\r\n\r\nSALE OF A WIFE AT WORCESTER, ENGLAND.--One of these immoral and\r\nillegal transactions was recently completed at Worcester. The\r\nagreement between the fellow who sold and the fellow who bought is\r\ngiven in _The Worcester Chronicle_:\r\n\r\n\"Thomas Middleton delivered up his wife, Mary Middleton, to Phillip\r\nRostins, and sold her for one shilling and a quart of ale, and parted\r\nwholly and solely for life, not trouble one another for life.

But one remarkable fact is overlooked. Society limits woman's\r\nsphere to the needle, the spindle, and the basket; and tradition\r\nreports that she _herself invented all three_. If she has invented her\r\ntools as fast as she has found opportunity to use them, can more be\r\nasked?\"--_T. W. Higginson_.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient Hindoo dramas, wives do not speak the same language\r\nwith their husbands, but employ the dialect of slaves.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of _The London Spectator_ suggests:--\"The employment\r\nof women _as clerks at railway stations_ would not be an unprecedented\r\ninnovation; they not unfrequently fill that position abroad; and I can\r\nrecall at least one instance, when, at a principal station in France,\r\na female clerk displayed under difficult circumstances an amount of\r\nzeal and intelligence which showed her to be admirably suited to her\r\noffice--'the right _woman_ in the right place.'\"\r\n\r\nThe word courage is, in the Spanish and Portuguese languages, a\r\n_feminine_ noun.\r\n\r\nUpwards of ten thousand females in New York, forty thousand in Paris,\r\nand eighty thousand in London, are said, by statisticians, to\r\nregularly earn a daily living by immoral practices. And yet all these\r\nare Christian cities!\r\n\r\nA widow lady of Bury, Mary Chapman, who would appear to have been a\r\nwarlike dame, making her will in 1649, leaves to one of her sons,\r\namong other things, \"also _my_ muskett, rest, bandileers, sword, and\r\nheadpiece, _my_ jacke, a fine paire of sheets, and a hutche.\"\r\n\r\nAddison, in _The Spectator_, refers to a French author, who mentions\r\nthat the ladies of the court of France, in his time, thought it\r\nill-breeding and a kind of female pedantry, to pronounce a hard word\r\nright, for which reason they took frequent occasion to use hard words,\r\nthat they might show a politeness in murdering them. The author\r\nfurther adds, that a lady of some quality at court, having\r\naccidentally made use of a hard word in a proper place, and pronounced\r\nit right, the whole assembly was out of countenance for her.\r\n\r\nSEWING IN NEW YORK.--\"I am informed from one source, that based on a\r\ncalculation some two years ago, the number of those who live by sewing\r\nin New York exceeds fifteen thousand. Another, who has good means of\r\ninformation, tells me there are forty thousand earning fifteen\r\nshillings ($1.87-1/2) per week, and paying twelve shillings ($1.50)\r\nfor board, making shirts at four cents.\"--_E. H. Chapin_, \"_Moral\r\nAspects of City Life_.\"\r\n\r\nThe first \"pilgrim\" who stepped ashore on Plymouth Rock is said, by\r\ntradition, to have been a young girl, named Mary Chilton.\r\n\r\nThe _St. Louis Republican_ mentions that there is one feature about\r\nthe steamer Illinois Belle, of peculiar attractiveness--a lady clerk.\r\n\"Look at her bills of lading, and 'Mary J. Patterson, clerk,' will be\r\nseen traced to a delicate and very neat style of chirography. A lady\r\nclerk on a Western steamer! It speaks strongly of our moral progress.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Borrow, in his singular narrative, \"The Romany Rye,\" states\r\nthat the sale of a wife, with a halter round her neck, is still a\r\nlegal transaction in England. It must be done in the cattle-market, as\r\nif she were a mare, \"all women being considered as mares by old\r\nEnglish law, _and indeed called mares in certain counties where\r\ngenuine old English is still preserved_.\"\r\n\r\nTESTIMONIAL TO MISS MITCHELL.--The fame of our talented countrywoman,\r\nMiss Maria Mitchell, of Nantucket, has spread far and wide among\r\nastronomers, and is cherished with pride by all Americans. We are glad\r\nto learn that it is proposed to present her a testimonial which will\r\nbe at once an appropriate tribute to her talents, and an aid to the\r\nfuture prosecution of her astronomical researches. An observatory on\r\nNantucket Island is for sale on very favorable terms, and a plan is on\r\nfoot for its purchase, to be presented to her. The sum needed is\r\n$3,000, of which more than a third has been raised by ladies in\r\nPhiladelphia and its neighborhood.\r\n\r\nMiss Mitchell is now in Europe, visiting the principal observatories\r\nand astronomers there, and it is hoped that she will soon be\r\ngratefully surprised by learning that the very imperfect means\r\nhitherto at her disposal in pursuing her favorite science are to be\r\nreplaced on her return by a collection of instruments which she will\r\nbe delighted to possess. Drs. Bond, of Harvard College Observatory,\r\nand Hall, of Providence, have interested themselves in securing this\r\nobject, and express strongly their opinion that valuable results to\r\nscience can not fail to be realized by furnishing so skillful and\r\ndiligent an observer as Miss Mitchell the proposed aids to her\r\nresearches. Dr. Bond expresses the conviction that Nantucket enjoys\r\nspecial advantages as an astronomical site, on account of its\r\ncomparative exemption from thermometrical disturbances of the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe hope this worthy tribute to our countrywoman's scientific merit\r\nwill not fail to be paid. Miss Mitchell's friends have the refusal of\r\nthe observatory only till September 1st, and several other purchasers\r\nare ready to take it at once. Dr. Geo. Choate, of Salem, has consented\r\nto receive the pledges of such as desire to be enrolled among the\r\nsubscribers to the fund, among whose names are already the honored\r\nones of Edward Everett, J. I. Bowditch, John C. Brown, of Providence,\r\nand F. Peabody, of Salem, besides other munificent patrons of\r\nscience.--_Journal of Commerce._\r\n\r\nLEARN TO SWIM.--When the steamer Alida was sinking from her collision\r\nwith the Fashion, a Kentucky girl of seventeen was standing on the\r\nguard, looking upon the confusion of the passengers, and occasionally\r\nturning and looking anxiously toward the shore. A gallant young man\r\nstepped up to her and offered to convey her safely to shore. \"Thank\r\nyou,\" replied the lady, \"you need not trouble yourself; I am only\r\nwaiting for the crowd to get out of the way, when I can take care of\r\nmyself.\" Soon the crowd cleared the space, and the lady plunged into\r\nthe water, and swam to the shore with ease, and without any apparent\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nA LADY HORSEBREAKER IN FRANCE.--In consequence of the success obtained\r\nby Madame Isabelle in breaking in horses for the Russian army, the\r\nFrench Minister of War lately authorized her to proceed officially\r\nbefore a commission, composed of general and superior officers of\r\ncavalry, with General Regnault de St. Jean d'Angely at their head, to\r\na practical demonstration of her method on a certain number of young\r\ncavalry horses. After twenty days' training, the horses were so\r\nperfectly broken in, that the minister no longer hesitated to enter\r\ninto an arrangement with Madame Isabelle to introduce her system into\r\nall the imperial schools of cavalry, beginning with that of\r\nSaumur.--_Galignani's Messenger_.\r\n\r\nSince the passage of what is called the Married Woman's Act, in 1848,\r\nin Pennsylvania, there have been brought, in the Court of Common\r\nPleas, one thousand one hundred and thirty-five suits for divorce. A\r\nlarge majority of the cases are brought by the wives, on the ground of\r\ncruel treatment and desertion.\r\n\r\n    \"Women ruled all, and ministers of state\r\n    Were at the doors of women forced to wait--\r\n    Women, who've oft as sovereigns graced the land,\r\n    But never governed well at second-hand.\"\r\n\r\n                              _Churchill's Satires, A.D. 1761._\r\n\r\n\r\nSENATOR ANTHONY.\r\n\r\n\"A Woman's Rights Convention is in session in New York. A collection\r\nof women arguing for political rights, and for the privileges usually\r\nconceded only to the other sex, is one of the easiest things in the\r\nworld to make fun of. There is no end to the smart speeches and the\r\nwitty remarks that may be made on the subject. But when we seriously\r\nattempt to show that a woman who pays taxes ought not to have a voice\r\nin the manner in which the taxes are expended, that a woman whose\r\nproperty and liberty and person are controlled by the laws, should\r\nhave no voice in framing those laws, it is not so easy. If women are\r\nfit to rule in monarchies, it is difficult to say why they are not\r\nqualified to vote in a republic; nor can there be greater indelicacy\r\nin a woman going up to the ballot-box than there is in a woman opening\r\na legislature or issuing orders to an army.\r\n\r\n\"We do not say that women ought to vote; but we say that it is a great\r\ndeal easier to laugh down the idea than to argue it down. Moreover,\r\nthere are a great many things besides voting that are confined to men,\r\nand that women can do quite as well, or even better. There are many\r\nemployments which ought to be opened to women, there are many ways in\r\nwhich women can be made to contribute more largely to their own\r\nindependence and comfort, and to the general good of society. All\r\nwell-directed plans to this end should receive the support of thinking\r\nmen. The danger is that conventions of this kind are apt to overlook\r\nthe present and attainable good, in their efforts for results which\r\nare of less certain value and far less practicable.\"--_Providence\r\nJournal, Edited by Ex-Governor Anthony._\r\n\r\n\r\nWISCONSIN LEGISLATURE, 1857.\r\n\r\nWISCONSIN REPORT ON THE SUFFRAGE QUESTION.--The following extract from\r\nthe report on the extension of the right of suffrage in Wisconsin, we\r\nfind in _The Milwaukee Free Democrat_:\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps no question ever submitted to a community would call forth so\r\nmuch of its mental activity, such a crusade into the realms of\r\nhistory, such a balancing of good and evil, of the past with the\r\npresent, such an examination of the social and political rights and\r\nrelations, as the question whether the right of suffrage ought to be\r\nextended to all citizens over the age of twenty-one, which would, of\r\ncourse, include both sexes. The giddy devotee of fashion would be\r\nsurprised in the midst of her frivolity, and be compelled to think and\r\nreason, in view of a new responsibility which is menacing her. Even if\r\nopposed to the proposition, she would be compelled to organize and\r\ninspire the public opinion necessary to defeat it. Whatever might be\r\nthe event, woman's intellectual position would be changed, and changed\r\nforever, and with hers that of all other classes....\r\n\r\n\"Let no one imagine that he can dispose of this question by a\r\ncontemptuous fling at strong-minded women and hen-pecked husbands. The\r\nprinciple will gain more strength from the character of the arguments\r\nof its opponents than from any number of Bloomer conventions. The\r\nmodern idea of the fashionable belle, floating like a bird of paradise\r\nthrough the soiree; the impersonation of motion and grace in the\r\nball-room, indulging alternately in syncope and rapture over the\r\nmarvelous adventures and despair of the hero of a mushroom romance,\r\nher rapid transition from one excitement to another, to fill up the\r\ndreary vacuum of life, provoking as it does the secret derision of\r\nsensible men; all this comes from that legislation, from that public\r\nopinion, which drives women away from real life; from the discussion\r\nof questions in which her happiness and destiny are involved. A\r\nsenseless, though a false fondness, denies her a participation in all\r\nquestions of the actual world around her. The novel writers therefore\r\ncreate a fictitious world, filled with fantastic and hollow\r\ncharacters, for her to range in. Awhile she believes she is an angel,\r\ntill some unfortunate husband finds her to be a moth on his fortune,\r\nand a baleful shadow stretching across his pathway, without curiosity\r\nor interests in all those practical realities, which the world,\r\noutside of her charmed existence, is attending to. These are the\r\nabortions of a false public opinion. For ages they have been regarded\r\nas the natural results of female organism. Hence, woman has become\r\nfamed as a gossip, because she would degrade herself by discussing\r\nJudge A.'s qualifications for Judge of Probate, though Judge A. may\r\nyet appoint a guardian for her children. In the sewing society, she\r\nsews scandal, or reads brocades, silks, and crinolines, because it\r\nwould be extremely coarse and vulgar in her to read the statutes of\r\nWisconsin, where her rights of person and property, marriage and\r\ndivorce, are regulated. In those statutes she would find that though\r\n$350,000 are appropriated to build a University, she is as effectually\r\nexcluded from that institution as though it was a convent of monks. So\r\nthere is some inconvenience at last in being regarded as a _bona-fide_\r\nangel, for angels have no use for Universities. Some indignant\r\nschool-ma'am begins to suspect the hollow compliments of moon-struck\r\nadmirers, and demands a direct voice in the laws which provide for the\r\nmutual improvement of her sex. But the grave doctor of law puts on his\r\nspectacles, and tells her she is fully and exactly represented in man,\r\nonly more so. When he eats, she eats; when he thinks, she thinks; when\r\nhe gets drunk, she gets drunk; that it would be as absurd to provide\r\nfor the board and education of one's own shadow as to provide a\r\nseparate establishment for woman, who possesses all things, enjoys all\r\nthings, and sways all things in man, as fully as though she did it\r\nherself. And a single woman, or widow, may pay taxes, but it would be\r\noutrageous for her to have a choice in the men who are to spend the\r\nmoney and then cry out for more. When married, ten years ago, her\r\neducation was equal to her husband's, now she can not write a\r\ngrammatical letter: her husband's mind has been enlarged by the influx\r\nof new ideas, and by contacts with the electric atmosphere of thought\r\nin the great world without; but denied as she has been the right of\r\nexpressing her will by a direct vote, she has lost all interest in\r\npassing events; the globe has dwindled to a half-acre lot and the\r\nvillage church. Her partner finds the match unequal, spends his time\r\nwith more congenial society, and is out-and-out in favor of Moses' law\r\nof a galloping divorce. The old stager has filled the political arena\r\nwith frauds and brawls, and bruises and blood; and having levelled the\r\nmorals of the ballot-box with those of the race-ground or box-ring, he\r\nhas yet virtue enough left to declare that woman shall not enter this\r\nmoral Aceldama.\r\n\r\n\"Yet it may be that democracy, for self-preservation, will be\r\ncompelled to invite women to the ballot-box, to restrain and overawe\r\nthe ruffianism of man. Though man smiles with secret derision at the\r\ncompetition of woman, in dress and show, yet he is too tender of her\r\nreputation to allow her the same field with himself wherein to\r\nexercise her powers. We believe that this contortion of character is\r\njustly attributable to the denial of the right of voting, the great\r\nmode by which the questions of the day are decided in this country.\r\nPolitics are our national life. As civilization advances, its issues\r\nwill penetrate still deeper into social and every-day life of the\r\npeople; and no man or woman can be regarded as an entity, as a power\r\nin society, who has not a direct agency in governing its results.\r\nWithout a direct voice in molding the spirit of the age, the age will\r\ndisown us.\r\n\r\n\"But the objection is argued seriously. Political rivalry will arm the\r\nwife against the husband; a man's foes will be those of his own\r\nhousehold. But we believe that political equality will, by lending the\r\nthoughts and purposes of the sexes, to a just degree, into the same\r\nchannel, more completely carry out the designs of nature. Women will\r\nbe possessed of a positive power, and hollow compliments and\r\nrose-water flatteries will be exchanged for a pure admiration and a\r\nwell-grounded respect, when we see her nobly discharging her part in\r\nthe great intellectual and moral struggles of the age, that wait their\r\nsolution by a direct appeal to the ballot-box. Woman's power is, at\r\npresent, poetical and unsubstantial; let it be practical and real.\r\nThere is no reality in any power that can not be coined into votes.\r\nThe demagogue has a sincere respect and a salutary fear of the voter;\r\nand he that can direct the lightning flash of the ballot-box is\r\ngreater than he who possesses a continent of vapor, gilded with\r\nmoonshine.\r\n\r\n\"It is true, the right of voting would carry with it the right to hold\r\noffice; but since it is true that the sexes have appropriate spheres,\r\nthe discretion of individual voters would recognize this fact, and\r\nseldom elect a woman to an office, for which she is unfitted by nature\r\nand education, as incompetent men are now elected. But the cruelty of\r\nour laws is seen in this--that where nature makes exceptions, the laws\r\nare inexorable.\r\n\r\n\"We have shown that woman is not correctly represented by man at the\r\nballot-box. Could her voice be heard, it would alter the choice of\r\npublic men and their character. With legislators compelled to respect\r\nher opinions, the law itself, constitutions, and politics reflect, to\r\na just extent, her peculiar views and interests. Nor is it for us to\r\ndecide whether these would be for the better or worse. Let the\r\nmajority rule. _Vox populi vox Dei._ Woman's intellect would enlarge\r\nwith her more commanding political condition, and though she might\r\nblight the hopes of many a promising aspirant, yet the Union would not\r\nbe dissolved under her administration. Believing the time has come\r\nwhen an appeal on her behalf to the voters of this State will not be\r\nin vain, we have prepared to submit the question to the people, by our\r\namendment to the Senate bill.\r\n\r\n                                                  \"DAVID NOGGLE.\r\n                                                  \"J.

The Ohio and Maine\r\nstatutes are printed below; also a Maine act, giving the husband title\r\nto an allowance from a deceased wife's property, similar to that now\r\ngiven by the law to widows.\r\n\r\nThe memorial presented to the New York Legislature, owing to some\r\nmistake, was not offered till too late for action.\r\n\r\nOHIO STATUTE.--Bill passed by the Ohio Legislature, April 17, 1857.\r\n\r\nSec. 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Ohio,\r\nthat no married man shall sell, dispose of, or in any manner part\r\nwith, any personal property, which is now, or may hereafter be, exempt\r\nfrom sale upon execution, without having first obtained the consent of\r\nhis wife thereto.\r\n\r\nSec. 2. If any married man shall violate the provisions of the\r\nforegoing section, his wife may, in her own name, commence and\r\nprosecute to final judgment and execution, in civil action, for the\r\nrecovery of such property or its value in money.\r\n\r\nSec. 8. Any married woman, whose husband shall desert her, or from\r\nintemperance or other cause become incapacitated, or neglect to\r\nprovide for his family, may, in her own name, make contracts for her\r\nown labor and the labor of her minor children, and in her own name,\r\nsue for and collect her own or their earnings.\r\n\r\nMAINE STATUTE.--At the recent session of the Legislature of Maine, the\r\nfollowing acts were passed:\r\n\r\n\"An Act relating to the property of deceased married women.

Proudhon and Mme. Jenny D'Hericourt. The latter defends,\r\nwith great warmth, the moral, civil, and political emancipation of\r\nwoman. Proudhon, in reply, declares that all the theories of Mme.\r\nD'Hericourt are inapplicable, in consequence of the inherent weakness\r\nof her sex. The periodical in which the contest is going on was\r\nfounded and is conducted by the old St. Simoniens.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE OF THE OHIO SENATE, ON GIVING THE RIGHT\r\nOF SUFFRAGE TO FEMALES.\r\n\r\n                                                  COLUMBUS, 1858.\r\n\r\nThe following petition, numerously signed by both men and women,\r\ncitizens of this State, was, at the first session of the Legislature,\r\nreferred to the undersigned Select Committee:\r\n\r\n\"WHEREAS, The women of the State of Ohio are disfranchised by the\r\nConstitution solely on account of their sex;\r\n\r\n\"We do, respectfully, demand for them the right of suffrage--a right\r\nwhich involves all other rights of citizenship--one that can not,\r\njustly, be withheld, as the following admitted principles of\r\ngovernment show:\r\n\r\n\"First. 'All men are born free and equal.'\r\n\r\n\"Second. 'Government derives its just power from the consent of the\r\ngoverned.'\r\n\r\n\"Third. 'Taxation and representation are inseparable.'\r\n\r\n\"We, the undersigned, therefore, petition your honorable body to take\r\nthe necessary steps for a revision of the Constitution, so that all\r\ncitizens may enjoy equal political rights.\"\r\n\r\nYour Committee have given the subject referred to them a careful\r\nexamination, and now\r\n\r\n                           REPORT.\r\n\r\nYour Committee believe that the prayer of the petitioners ought\r\nto be granted. Our opinion is based both upon grounds of\r\nprinciple and expediency, which we will endeavor to present as\r\nbriefly as is consistent with a due consideration of this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe founders of this Republic claimed and asserted with\r\ngreat emphasis, the essential equality of human rights as a\r\nself-evident truth. They scouted the venerable old dogma of the\r\ndivine right of kings and titled aristocracies to rule the\r\nsubmissive multitude. They were equally explicit in their claim\r\nthat \"taxation and representation are inseparable.\"\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives of Massachusetts, 1764, declared,\r\n\"That the imposition of duties and taxes, by the Parliament of\r\nGreat Britain, upon a _people not represented_ in the House of\r\nCommons, is absolutely irreconcilable with their rights.\" A\r\npamphlet entitled \"The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted,\"\r\nwas sent to the agent of the Colony in England, to show him the\r\nstate of the public mind, and along with it an energetic letter.\r\n\"The silence of the province,\" said this letter, alluding to the\r\nsuggestion of the agent that he had taken silence for consent,\r\n\"should have been imputed to any cause--even to despair--rather\r\nthan be construed into a tacit cession of their rights, or the\r\nacknowledgment of a right in the Parliament of Great Britain, to\r\nimpose duties and taxes on a people who are not represented In\r\nthe House of Commons.\" \"_If we are not represented we are\r\nslaves!_\" Some of England's ablest jurists acknowledge the truth\r\nof this doctrine. Chief Justice Pratt said: \"My position is\r\nthis--taxation and representation are inseparable. The position\r\nis founded in the law of nature. It is more; it is itself an\r\neternal law of nature.\" In defence of this doctrine they waged a\r\nseven years' war: and yet, when they had wrung from the grasp of\r\nGreat Britain the Colonies she would not govern upon this\r\nprinciple, and undertook to organize them according to their\r\nfavorite theory, most of the Colonies, by a single stroke of the\r\npen, cut off one-half of the people from any representation in\r\nthe government which claimed their obedience to its laws, the\r\nright to tax them for its support, and the right to punish them\r\nfor disobedience.\r\n\r\nThis disparity between their theory and practice does not seem to\r\nhave excited much, if any notice, at the time, nor until its\r\nbitter fruits had long been eaten in obscurity and sorrow by\r\nthousands who suffered, but did not complain. Indeed, so\r\napathetic has been the public mind upon this subject, that no one\r\nis surprised to see such a remark as the following by a\r\ndistinguished commentator upon American institutions: \"In the\r\nfree States, except criminals and paupers, _there is no class of\r\npersons_ who do not exercise the elective franchise.\" It seems\r\nwomen are not even a class of persons. They are fairly dropped\r\nfrom the human race, and very naturally, since we have grown\r\naccustomed to recognize as _universal_ suffrage, that which\r\nexcludes by constitutional taboo one-half of the people. To\r\ndeclare that a voice in the government is the right of _all_, and\r\nthen give it only to a _part_--and that the part to which the\r\nclaimant himself belongs--is to renounce even the appearance of\r\nprinciple. As ought to have been foreseen, the class of persons\r\nthus cut off from the means of self-protection, have become\r\nvictims of unequal and oppressive legislation, which runs through\r\nour whole code. We first bind the hands, by the organic law, and\r\nthen proceed with deliberate safety, by the statute, to spoil the\r\ngoods of the victim. Whatever palliation for the past hoary\r\ncustom, false theology, and narrow prejudice may furnish, it is\r\ncertainly time now to remedy those evils, and reduce to practice\r\nour favorite theory of government.\r\n\r\nThe citizens thus robbed of a natural right complain of the\r\ninjustice. They protest against taxation without representation.\r\nThey claim that all _just_ government must derive its power from\r\nthe consent of the governed. A forcible female writer says: \"Even\r\nthis so-called free government of the united States, as at\r\npresent administered, is nothing but a political, hereditary\r\ndespotism to woman; she has no instrumentality whatever in making\r\nthe laws by which she is governed, while her property is taxed\r\n_without_ representation.\"\r\n\r\nBut this feeling, it is claimed, is entertained but by few women;\r\non the contrary, they generally disown such claim when made in\r\ntheir behalf. Supposing the fact to be true to the fullest extent\r\never asserted, if it proves that American women ought to remain\r\nas they are, it proves exactly the same with respect to Asiatic\r\nwomen; for they, too, instead of murmuring at their seclusion and\r\nat the restraint imposed upon them, pride themselves on it, and\r\nare astonished at the effrontery of women who receive visits from\r\nmale acquaintances, and are seen in the streets unveiled. Habits\r\nof submission make women, as well as men, servile-minded. The\r\nvast population of Asia do not desire or value--probably would\r\nnot accept--political liberty, nor the savages of the forest\r\ncivilization; which does not prove that either of these things is\r\nundesirable for them, or that they will not, at some future time,\r\nenjoy it. Custom hardens human beings to any kind of degradation,\r\nby deadening that part of their nature which would resist it. And\r\nthe case of woman is, in this respect even, a peculiar one, for\r\nno other inferior caste that we have heard of has been taught to\r\nregard its degradation as their, its, honor. The argument,\r\nhowever, implies a secret consciousness that the alleged\r\npreference of women for their dependent state is merely apparent,\r\nand arises from their being allowed no choice; for, if the\r\npreference be natural, there can be no necessity for enforcing\r\nit by law. To make laws compelling people to follow their\r\ninclinations, has not, hitherto, been thought necessary by any\r\nlegislator.\r\n\r\nThe plea that women do not desire any change is the same that has\r\nbeen urged, times out of mind, against the proposal of abolishing\r\nany social evil. \"There is no complaint,\" which is generally, and\r\nin this case certainly not true, and when true, only so because\r\nthere is not that hope of success, without which complaint seldom\r\nmakes itself audible to unwilling ears. How does the objector\r\nknow that women do not desire equality of freedom? It would be\r\nvery simple to suppose that if they do desire it they will all\r\nsay so. Their position is like that of the tenants and laborers\r\nwho vote against their own political interests to please their\r\nlandlords or employers, with the unique admission that submission\r\nis inculcated in them from childhood, as the peculiar attraction\r\nand grace of their character. They are taught to think that to\r\nrepel actively even an admitted injustice, done to themselves, is\r\nsomewhat unfeminine, and had better be left to some male friend\r\nor protector. To be accused of rebelling against anything which\r\nadmits of being called an ordinance of society, they are taught\r\nto regard as an imputation of a serious offence, to say the\r\nleast, against the propriety of their sex. It requires unusual\r\nmoral courage, as well as disinterestedness in a woman, to\r\nexpress opinions favorable to woman's enfranchisement, until, at\r\nleast, there is some prospect of obtaining it.\r\n\r\nThe comfort of her individual life and her social consideration,\r\nusually depend on the good-will of those who hold the undue\r\npower; and to the possessors of power, any complaint, however\r\nbitter, of the misuse of it, is scarcely a less flagrant act of\r\ninsubordination than to protest against the power itself. The\r\nprofessions of women in this matter remind us of the State\r\noffenders of old, who, on the point of execution, used to protest\r\ntheir love and devotion to the sovereign by whose unjust mandate\r\nthey suffered. Grlselda, himself, might be matched from the\r\nspeeches put by Shakespeare into the mouths of male victims of\r\nkingly caprice and tyranny; the Duke of Buckingham, for example,\r\nin \"Henry VIII.,\" and even Wolsey.\r\n\r\nThe literary class of women are often ostentatious in\r\ndisclaiming the desire for equality of citizenship, and\r\nproclaiming their complete satisfaction with the place which\r\nsociety assigns them; exercising in this, as in many other\r\nrespects, a most noxious influence over the feelings and opinions\r\nof men, who unsuspectingly accept the servilities of toadyism as\r\nconcessions to the force of truth, not considering that it is the\r\npersonal interest of these women to profess whatever opinions\r\nthey expect will be agreeable to men. It is not among men of\r\ntalent, sprung from the people, and patronized and flattered by\r\nthe aristocracy, that we look for the leaders of a democratic\r\nmovement. Successful literary women are just as unlikely to\r\nprefer the cause of woman to their own social consideration. They\r\ndepend on men's opinion for their literary, as well as for their\r\nfeminine successes; and such is their bad opinion of men, that\r\nthey believe there is not more than one in a thousand who does\r\nnot dislike and fear strength, sincerity, and high spirit in a\r\nwoman. They are, therefore, anxious to earn pardon and toleration\r\nfor whatever of these qualities their writings may exhibit on\r\nother subjects, by a studied display of submission on this; that\r\nthey may give no occasion for vulgar men to say--what nothing\r\nwill prevent vulgar men from saying--that learning makes woman\r\nunfeminine, and that literary ladies are likely to be bad wives.\r\n\r\nBut even if a large majority of women do not desire any change in\r\nthe Constitution, that would be a very bad reason for withholding\r\nthe elective franchise from those who do desire it. Freedom of\r\nchoice, liberty to choose their own sphere, is what is asked. We\r\nhave not heard that the most ardent apostles of female suffrage\r\npropose to compel any woman to make stump speeches against her\r\nwill, or to march a fainting sisterhood to the polls under a\r\npolice, in Bloomer costume. Women who condemn their sisters for\r\ndiscontent with the laws as they are, have their prototype in\r\nthose men of America who, in our revolutionary struggle with\r\nEngland, vehemently denounced and stigmatized as fanatics and\r\nrebels the leaders and malcontents of that day. But neither their\r\npatriotism nor wisdom have ever been much admired by the American\r\npeople, perhaps not even by the English.\r\n\r\nThe objection urged against female suffrage with the greatest\r\nconfidence and by the greatest number, is that such a right is\r\nincompatible with the refinement and delicacy of the sex. That it\r\nwould make them harsh and disputative, like male voters. This\r\nobjection loses most, if not all of its force, when it is\r\ncompared with the well-established usages of society as relates\r\nto woman. She already fills places and discharges duties with the\r\napprobation of most men, which are, to say the least, quite as\r\ndangerous to her refinement and retiring modesty, as the act of\r\nvoting or even holding office would be. In our political\r\ncampaigns all parties are anxious to secure the co-operation of\r\nwomen. They are urged to attend our political meetings, and even\r\nin our mass meetings, when whole acres of men are assembled, they\r\nare importunately urged to take a conspicuous part, sometimes as\r\nthe representatives of the several States, and sometimes as the\r\ndonors of banners and flags, accompanied with patriotic speeches\r\nby the fair donors. And in great moral questions, such as\r\ntemperance, for example, in the right disposition of which woman\r\nis more interested than man, she often discharges a large\r\namount of the labor of the campaign; but yet, when it comes\r\nto the crowning act of voting, she must stand aside--delicacy\r\nforbids--that is too masculine, too public, too exposing, though\r\nit could be done, in most cases, with as little difficulty and\r\nexposure as a letter can be taken out or put in the post-office.\r\n\r\nThen there is that large class of concert singers and readers of\r\nthe drama, who are eulogized and petted by those who are most\r\nshocked at the idea of women submitting themselves to the\r\nexposure of voting. In fact, the whole question of publicity is\r\nsettled to the fullest extent; at least every man must be silent\r\nwho acquiesces in the concert, the drama, or the opera. We need\r\nnot dwell on the exposures of the stage or the indelicacies of\r\nthe ballet, but if Jenny Lind was \"an angel of purity and\r\nbenevolence\" for consenting to stand, chanting and enchanting,\r\nbefore three thousand excited admirers; if Madame Sontag could\r\ngive a full-dress rehearsal (which does not commonly imply a\r\nsuperfluity of apparel) for the special edification of the clergy\r\nof Boston, and be rewarded with duplicate Bibles, it is difficult\r\nto see why a woman may not vote on questions vitally affecting\r\nthe interests of herself, or children, or kindred.\r\n\r\nBut, with all our dainty notions of female proprieties, women\r\nare, by common consent, dragged into court as witnesses, and\r\nsubjected to the most scrutinizing and often indelicate\r\nexaminations and questions, if either party imagines he can gain\r\na sixpence, or dull the edge of a criminal prosecution, by her\r\ntestimony. The interest, convenience, and prejudices of men, and\r\nnot any true regard for the delicacy of the sex, seem to be the\r\nstandard by which woman's rights and duties are to be measured.\r\nIt is prejudice, custom, long-established usage, and not reason,\r\nwhich demand the sacrifice of woman's natural rights of\r\nself-government; a relic of barbarism still lingering in all\r\npolitical, and nearly all religions organizations. Among the\r\npurely savage tribes, woman takes position as a domestic\r\ndrudge--a mere beast of burden, whilst the sensual civilization\r\nof Asia regard her more in the light of a domestic luxury, to be\r\njealously guarded from the profane sight of all men but her\r\nhusband. Both positions equally and widely remote from the noble\r\none God intended her to fill.\r\n\r\nIn Persia and Turkey women grossly offend the public taste if\r\nthey suffer their faces to be seen in the streets. In the latter\r\ncountry they are prohibited by law, in common with \"pigs, dogs,\r\nand other unclean animals,\" as the law styles them, from so much\r\nas entering their mosques. _Our_ ideas of the proper sphere,\r\nduties, and capabilities of woman do not differ from these so\r\nmuch in kind as degree. They are all based upon the assumption\r\nthat man has the right to decide what are the rights, to point\r\nout the duties, and to fix the boundaries of woman's sphere;\r\nwhich, taking for true, our cherished theory of government, to\r\nwit: the _inalienability and equality of human rights_ can hardly\r\nbe characterized by a milder term than that of an impudent and\r\noppressive usurpation. Who has authorized us, whilst railing at\r\nmiters, and crosiers, and scepters, and shouting in the ears of\r\nthe British Lion, as self-evident truths, \"representation and\r\ntaxation are, and _shall_ be, inseparable,\"--\"governments, to be\r\n_just_, must have the consent of the governed;\" to say woman,\r\none-half of the whole race, shall, nevertheless, be taxed without\r\nrepresentation and governed without her consent? Who hath made us\r\na judge betwixt her and her Maker?\r\n\r\nIt is said woman's mental and moral organization is peculiar,\r\ndiffering widely from that of man. Perhaps so. She must then have\r\na peculiar fitness of qualification to judge what will be wise\r\nand just government for her. Let her be free to choose for\r\nherself, in the light of her peculiar organization, to what she\r\nis best adapted. She is better qualified to judge of her proper\r\nsphere than man can be. She knows her own wants and capabilities.\r\nLet us leave her, as God created her, a free agent, accountable\r\nto Him for any violation of the laws of her nature. He has\r\nmingled the sexes in the family relation; they are associated on\r\nterms of equality in some churches. They are active working and\r\nvoting members of literary and benevolent societies. They vote as\r\nshare-holders in stock companies, and in countries where less is\r\nsaid about freedom, and equality, and representation, they are\r\noften called to, and fill, with distinguished ability, very\r\nimportant positions, and often discharge the highest political\r\ntrusts known to their laws. Which of England's kings has shown\r\nmore executive ability than Elizabeth, or which has been more\r\nconscientious and discreet than Annie and Victoria? Spain, too,\r\nhad her Isabella, and France her Maid of Orleans, her Madame\r\nRoland, yes, and her Charlotte Corday. Austria and Hungary their\r\nMaria Theresa. Russia her Catharine; and even the jealous Jewish\r\nTheocracy was judged forty years by a woman. It is too late, by\r\nthirty centuries, to put in the plea of her incompetency in\r\npolitical affairs.\r\n\r\nBut it is objected that it would not do for woman, particularly a\r\nmarried woman, to be allowed to vote. It might bring discord into\r\nthe family if she differed from her husband. If this objection\r\nwere worth anything at all, it would lie with tenfold greater\r\nforce against religious than political organizations. No\r\nanimosities are so bitter and implacable as those growing out of\r\nreligions disagreements; yet we allow women to choose their\r\nreligious creeds, attend their favorite places of worship, and in\r\nsome of them take an equal part in the church business, and all\r\nthis, though the husband is of another religion, or of no\r\nreligion, and no one this side of Turkey claims that the law\r\nshould compel woman to have no religion, or adopt that of her\r\nhusband. But, even if that objection were a good one, more than\r\nhalf the adult women of the State are unmarried.\r\n\r\nIt is said, too, that as woman is not required to perform\r\nmilitary duty, and work on the roads, she ought not to vote. None\r\nbut \"able-bodied\" men, under a certain age, are required to do\r\nmilitary duty, and the effect is practically the same in regard\r\nto the two days' work on the roads, whilst women pay tax for\r\nmilitary and road purposes the same as man. A _man's_ right to\r\nvote does not depend on his ability to perform physical labor,\r\nwhy should a _woman's?_ By the exclusion of woman from her due\r\ninfluence and voice in the government, we lose that elevating and\r\nrefining influence which she gives to religious, social, and\r\ndomestic life. Her presence at our political meetings, all agree,\r\ncontributes greatly to their order, decorum, and decency. Why\r\nshould not the polls, also, be civilized by her presence?\r\n\r\nDoes not the morality of our politics demonstrate a great want of\r\nthe two qualities so characteristic of woman, heart and\r\nconscience? The female element which works such miracles of\r\nreform in the rude manners of men, in all the departments of life\r\nwhere she has the freedom to go, is nowhere more needed than in\r\nour politics, or at the polls.\r\n\r\nWe have endeavored to show that the constitutional prohibition of\r\nfemale suffrage is not only a violation of natural right, but\r\nequally at war with the fundamental principles of the government.\r\nLet us now look at the practical results of this organic wrong.\r\nAfter having taken away from woman the means of protecting her\r\nperson and property, by the peaceable, but powerful ballot, how\r\nhave we discharged the self-imposed duty of legislating for her?\r\nBy every principle of honor, or even of common honesty, we are\r\nbound to see that her interests do not suffer in our hands. That,\r\nif we depart at all from the principle of strict equality, it\r\nshould be in her favor. Let as see what are the facts.\r\n\r\nWhen a woman marries she becomes almost annihilated in the eyes\r\nof the law, except as a subject of punishment. She loses the\r\nright to receive and control the wages of her own labor. If she\r\nbe an administratrix, or executrix, she is counted as dead, and\r\nanother must be appointed. If she have children, they may be\r\ntaken from her against her will, and placed in the care of any\r\none, no matter how unfit, whom the father may select. He may even\r\ngive them away by will. \"The personal property of the wife, such\r\nas money, goods, cattle, and other chattels, which she had in\r\npossession at the time of her marriage, in her own right, and not\r\nin the right of another, vest immediately in the husband, and he\r\ncan dispose of them as he pleases. On his death, they go to his\r\nrepresentatives, like the residue of his property. So, if any\r\nsuch goods or chattels come to her possession in her own right,\r\nafter the marriage, they, in like manner, immediately vest in the\r\nhusband.\" \"Such property of the wife, as bonds, notes, arrears of\r\nrent, legacies, which are termed _choses in action_, do not vest\r\nin the husband by mere operation of marriage. To entitle him to\r\nthem, he must first reduce them into possession, by recovering\r\nthe money, or altering the security, as by making them payable to\r\nhimself. If the husband appoint an attorney to receive a debt or\r\nclaim due the wife, and the attorney received it, or if he\r\nmortgaged the claim or debt, or assign it for a valuable\r\nconsideration, or recover judgment by suit, in his own name, or\r\nif he release it, in all these cases the right of the wife, upon\r\nthe decease of the husband, is gone.\"\r\n\r\nThe real estate of the wife, such as houses and lands, is in\r\nnearly the same state of subjection to the husband's will. He is\r\nentitled to all the rents and profits while they both live, and\r\nthe husband can hold the estate during his life, even though the\r\nwife be dead. A woman may thus be stripped of every available\r\ncent she ever had in the world, and even see it squandered in\r\nministering to the low appetite or passions of a drunken\r\ndebauchee of a husband. And when, by economy and toil, she may\r\nhave acquired the means of present subsistence, this, too, may be\r\n_lawfully_ taken from her, and applied to the same base purpose.\r\nEven her Family Bible, the last gift of a dying mother, her only\r\nremaining comfort, can be lawfully taken and sold by the husband,\r\nto buy the means of intoxication. _This very thing has been\r\ndone._ Can any one believe that laws, so wickedly one-sided as\r\nthese, were ever honestly designed for the equal benefit of woman\r\nwith man? Yet wives are said to have quite a sufficient\r\nrepresentation in the government, through their husbands, to\r\nsecure them protection.\r\n\r\nBut the cruel inequality of the laws relating to woman as wife\r\nare quite outdone by those relating to her as widow. It is these\r\nstricken and sorrowful victims, the law seems especially to have\r\nselected as its prey. Upon the death of the husband, the law\r\ntakes possession of the whole of the estate. The smallest items\r\nof property must be turned out for valuation, to be handled by\r\nstrangers. The clothes that the deceased had worn, the chair in\r\nwhich he sat, the bed on which he died, all these sacred\r\nmemorials of the dead, must undergo the cold scrutiny of officers\r\nof the law. The widow is counted but as an alien, and an\r\nincumbrance on the estate, the bulk of which is designed for\r\nother hands. She is to have doled out to her, like a pauper, by\r\npaltry sixes, the furniture of her own kitchen. \"One table, six\r\nchairs, six knives and forks, six plates, six tea-cups and\r\nsaucers, one sugar-dish, one milk-pail, one tea-pot, and _twelve_\r\nspoons!\" All this munificent provision for, perhaps, a family of\r\nonly a dozen-persons. Think of it, ye widows, and learn to be\r\ngrateful for man's provident care of you in your hour of need!\r\n\r\nThen comes the sale of \"the effects of the deceased,\" as they are\r\ncalled; and amid the fullness and freshness of her grief, the\r\nwidow is compelled to see sold into the hands of strangers, amid\r\nthe coarse jokes and levity of a public auction, articles to her\r\nbeyond all price, and around which so many tender memories cling.\r\nExperience alone can fully teach the torture of this fiery\r\nordeal. But this is only the beginning of her sorrows. If she\r\nhave children, the estate is considered to belong to them, while\r\nshe is but an \"incumbrance\" upon it. She is to have the rents and\r\nprofits of one-third part of the real estate her lifetime, which,\r\nto the vast majority of cases, is so unproductive as to compel\r\nher to leave that spot, endeared to her by so many tender\r\nties--the home of her early love, the birthplace of her\r\nchildren--for a cheaper and less comfortable home. But, bereaved\r\nof her husband and robbed of her property,\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The law hath yet another hold on her.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing up the insulting and injurious assumption of her\r\nincompetency and untrustworthiness, implied in the denial of her\r\nright of suffrage, the guardianship of her children is taken from\r\nher. Her daughter, at the age of twelve, and her son, at fifteen,\r\nare to go through the mockery of choosing for themselves a\r\n_competent_ guardian--a proceeding calculated to destroy the\r\nbeautiful trust and confidence in the wisdom and fitness of the\r\nmother to govern and direct them, so natural and so essential to\r\nthe happiness of children. When the justifying pretext for the\r\ninfliction of all this misery is the benefit of the children, her\r\nmaternal nature will struggle hard to endure it with patience.\r\nBut, until the passage of the law of 1863, \"regulating descents\r\nand distributions,\" when there were no children of either parent,\r\nthe law did not abate its rigor toward her, in the disposition of\r\nthe real estate, which is generally all that is left, after\r\npaying the debts and costs of \"settlement,\" though the whole of\r\nthe houses and lands might have been bought with her money,\r\ntwo-thirds were immediately handed over to the relatives of the\r\nhusband, however above need; and though they might have been\r\nstrangers, or even enemies, to her. She had but a life estate in\r\nthe other third, which, at her death, also went, as the other, to\r\nher husband's heirs. She could not indulge her benevolent\r\nfeelings or gratify her friendships, by devising by will, to\r\napproved charities or favorite friends, the means she no longer\r\nneeded. With a bitter sense of injustice and despairing sorrow,\r\nshe might well adopt the language of the unhappy Jew:\r\n\r\n     \"Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that;\r\n     You take my house, when you do take the prop\r\n     That doth sustain my house; you take my life,\r\n     When you do take the means whereby I live.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the famous right of dower, which has been the subject of\r\nso many stupid eulogies by lawyers and commentators.\r\n\r\nTake an example of the effect of these laws upon an overburdened\r\nheart, which occurred just before the passage of the Act of 1853.\r\nA young couple, by their united means and patient industry, had\r\nsecured for themselves a small, but comfortable home. It\r\nfurnished the means of supplying all their simple wants. It was\r\ntheir own; doubly endeared by the struggles and sacrifices it had\r\ncost them. They were content. They had no children, but they had\r\neach other, and were happy in their mutual love. Death seemed a\r\ngreat way off; and life--it was a real joy. They knew little of\r\nthe laws of estates. Owing nothing, they feared no intrusion upon\r\nthe sanctity of their home. But the husband was killed by the\r\nfalling of a tree; and, after some hours, was found dead by the\r\nagonized wife. There was no will. The wrung heart of the\r\nchildless widow, in her utter bereavement, still clung to her\r\nhome, which, though blighted and desolate, was still dear to her.\r\nThere, at least, she would find shelter. But soon the inexorable\r\nlaw laid its cold, unwelcome hand upon that darkened home. There\r\nmust be letters of administration had--an inventory of the\r\n\"effects\"--an appraisement. Everything was explained by\r\nsympathizing counsel. The \"right of dower\" set conspicuously\r\nin the foreground--\"one equal third part\"--at length she\r\ncomprehended it all. Her home was to pass into other hands:\r\nhenceforth she was to be counted only as an incumbrance on it.\r\nLooking from the misery of the present down the gloom of the\r\nfuture, she could see only widowhood and penury. And whilst the\r\nappraisers were performing their ungracious task of overhauling\r\ncupboards and drawers, and estimating the value in cash of\r\npresents received in her courtship, she, in her quiet despair at\r\nthis last bitter drop added to her full cup, arrayed herself in\r\nher best apparel (which the law generously provides \"she shall\r\nretain\"), and, without uttering a word of complaint or farewell,\r\nwalked to the nearest water and drowned herself.\r\n\r\nIf \"oppression maketh even a wise man mad,\" ought we to wonder\r\nthat a woman, almost crazed by a sudden and terrible bereavement,\r\nupon finding that her calamity, instead of giving her the jealous\r\nand compassionate protection of the law, was to be made the\r\npretext for robbing her of what yet remained of earthly comforts,\r\nshould, in the madness of her despair, cast away the burden of a\r\nlife no longer tolerable? In India she would have been burned\r\nupon the funeral pile of her dead husband; we drive her to\r\nmadness and suicide by the slower, but no less cruel torture, of\r\nstarvation and a breaking heart. Whilst persisting in such\r\nlegislation, how could we expect to escape the woe, denounced by\r\nthe compassionate and long-suffering Saviour, against the\r\n\"hypocrites who devour widows' houses\"?\r\n\r\nIt is said woman can accomplish any object of her desire better\r\nby persuasion, by her smiles and tears and eloquence, than she\r\ncould ever compel by her vote. But with all her powers of coaxing\r\nand eloquence, she has never yet coaxed her partner into doing\r\nher simple justice. Shall we never get beyond the absurd theory\r\nthat every woman is legally and politically represented by her\r\nhusband, and hence has an adequate guarantee? The answer is, that\r\nshe has been so represented ever since representation began, and\r\nthe result appears to be that, among the Anglo-Saxon race\r\ngenerally, the entire system of laws in regard to women is, at\r\nthis moment, so utterly wrong, that Lord Brougham is reported to\r\nhave declared it useless to attempt to amend it--\"There must be a\r\ntotal reconstruction before a woman can have any justice.\" The\r\nwrong lies not so much in any special statute as in the\r\nfundamental theory of the law, yet no man can read the statutes\r\non this subject of the most enlightened nation, without admitting\r\nthat they were obviously made by man, not with a view to woman's\r\ninterest, but his own. Our Ohio laws may not be so bad as the law\r\nrepealed in Vermont in 1850, which _confiscated to the State_\r\none-half the property of every childless widow, unless the\r\nhusband had other heirs. But they must compel from every generous\r\nman the admission, that neither justice nor gallantry has yet\r\navailed to procure anything like impartiality in the legal\r\nprovisions for the two sexes. With what decent show of justice,\r\nthen, can man, thus dishonored, claim a continuance of this\r\nsuicidal confidence? There is something respectable in the frank\r\nbarbarism of the old Russian nuptial consecration, \"Here, wolf,\r\ntake thy lamb.\" But we can not easily extend the same charity to\r\nthe civilized wolf of England and America, clad in the sheep's\r\nclothing of a volume of revised statutes, caressing the person of\r\nthe bride and devouring her property.\r\n\r\nIt is said the husband can, by will, provide against these cases\r\nof hardship and injustice. True, he can, if he will, but does he?\r\nThe number is few, some of the more thoughtful and conscientious;\r\nbut this is only obtaining justice as a favor, and not as a\r\nnatural right. But it is a majority of husbands who make these\r\nlaws, and they generally have no desire to amend them by will.\r\nBesides, the will of the husband is sometimes even worse than the\r\nlaw itself. Such cases are by no means rare. Almost every man's\r\nmemory may furnish one or more examples that have fallen under\r\nhis immediate notice. One or two only we will mention. A woman,\r\nadvanced in life, who owned a valuable farm in her own right, in\r\nthe border of a flourishing town, married a man who had little or\r\nno property. The farm was soon cut up into town lots and sold at\r\nhigh prices. In a few years the husband died, leaving no\r\nchildren, but, by will, directed the division of nearly the whole\r\nof the estate among his relatives, persons who the wife never\r\nsaw. The only remedy in this case was to fall back upon her right\r\nof dower, and submit to the robbery of the law, in order to\r\nescape the worse robbery of the will. This will was not the\r\nresult of any disagreement between the husband and the wife. It\r\nwas only the natural outgrowth of the whole policy of our laws as\r\nregards the property rights of woman. Permit us to notice one\r\nother case, which occurred in a neighboring State. Many similar\r\nones, no doubt, have occurred in our own, the law in both States\r\nbeing the same.\r\n\r\nA woman who had a fortune of fifty thousand dollars in \"personal\r\nproperty,\" married. All this, by the law, belonged absolutely to\r\nthe husband. In a year he died, leaving a will directing that the\r\nwidow should have the proceeds of a certain part of this money,\r\n_so long as she remained unmarried_. If she married again, or at\r\nher death, it was to go to his heirs.\r\n\r\nHow different in all these cases is the condition of the\r\nhusband upon the death of the wife. There in then no officious\r\nintermeddling of the law in his domestic affairs. His house, sad\r\nand desolate though it be, is still sacred and secure from the\r\nfoot of unbidden guests. There is no legal \"settlement\" to eat\r\nup his estate. He is not told that \"one equal third part\" of all\r\nhis lands and tenements shall be set apart for his use during\r\nhis lifetime. \"He has all, everything, even his wife's bridal\r\npresents too are his. If the wife had lands in her own right, and\r\nif they have ever had a living child, he has a life estate in the\r\nwhole of it, not a beggarly 'third part.'\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the result of man's government of woman without her\r\nconsent. Such is the protection he affords her. She now asks\r\nthe means of protecting herself, by the same instrumentality\r\nwhich man considers so essential to his freedom and security,\r\nrepresentation, political equality--THE RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE.\r\nThe removal of this constitutional restriction is of great\r\nconsequence, because it casts upon woman a stigma of inferiority,\r\nof incompetency, of unworthiness of trust. It ranks her with\r\ncriminals and madmen and idiots. It is essential to her,\r\npractically, as being the key to all her rights, which will open\r\nto her the door of equality and justice.\r\n\r\nDoes any one believe that if woman had possessed an equal voice\r\nin making our laws, we should have standing on our statute books,\r\nfor generations, laws so palpably unequal and unjust toward her?\r\nThe idea is preposterous.\r\n\r\nIf our sense of natural justice and our theory of government both\r\nagree, that the being who is to suffer under laws shall first\r\npersonally assent to them, and that the being whose industry the\r\ngovernment is to burden should have a voice in fixing the\r\ncharacter and amount of that burden, then, while woman is\r\nadmitted to the gallows, the jail, and the tax-list, _we have no\r\nright_ to debar her from the ballot-box.\r\n\r\nYour Committee recommend the adoption of the following\r\nresolution:\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the Judiciary Committee be instructed to report\r\nto the Senate, a bill to submit to the qualified electors at the\r\nnext election for senators and representatives, an amendment to\r\nthe Constitution whereby the elective franchise shall be extended\r\nto the citizens of Ohio, without distinction of sex.\r\n\r\n                                          J.
