Until recently the great majority of naturalists\r\nbelieved that species were immutable productions, and had been\r\nseparately created. This view has been ably maintained by many authors.\r\nSome few naturalists, on the other hand, have believed that species\r\nundergo modification, and that the existing forms of life are the\r\ndescendants by true generation of pre existing forms. Passing over\r\nallusions to the subject in the classical writers,[1] the first author\r\nwho in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon.\r\nBut as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he\r\ndoes not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species,\r\nI need not here enter on details.\r\n\r\n [1] Aristotle, in his “Physicæ Auscultationes” (lib.2, cap.8, s.2),\r\n after remarking that rain does not fall in order to make the corn\r\n grow, any more than it falls to spoil the farmer’s corn when threshed\r\n out of doors, applies the same argument to organisation; and adds (as\r\n translated by Mr. Clair Grece, who first pointed out the passage to\r\n me), “So what hinders the different parts (of the body) from having\r\n this merely accidental relation in nature? as the teeth, for example,\r\n grow by necessity, the front ones sharp, adapted for dividing, and the\r\n grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating the food; since they\r\n were not made for the sake of this, but it was the result of accident.\r\n And in like manner as to other parts in which there appears to exist\r\n an adaptation to an end. Wheresoever, therefore, all things together\r\n (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as if they were\r\n made for the sake of something, these were preserved, having been\r\n appropriately constituted by an internal spontaneity; and whatsoever\r\n things were not thus constituted, perished and still perish.” We here\r\n see the principle of natural selection shadowed forth, but how little\r\n Aristotle fully comprehended the principle, is shown by his remarks on\r\n the formation of the teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\nLamarck was the first man whose conclusions on the subject excited much\r\nattention. This justly celebrated naturalist first published his views\r\nin 1801; he much enlarged them in 1809 in his “Philosophie Zoologique”,\r\nand subsequently, 1815, in the Introduction to his “Hist. Nat. des\r\nAnimaux sans Vertébres”. In these works he up holds the doctrine that\r\nall species, including man, are descended from other species. He first\r\ndid the eminent service of arousing attention to the probability of all\r\nchange in the organic, as well as in the inorganic world, being the\r\nresult of law, and not of miraculous interposition. Lamarck seems to\r\nhave been chiefly led to his conclusion on the gradual change of\r\nspecies, by the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties, by\r\nthe almost perfect gradation of forms in certain groups, and by the\r\nanalogy of domestic productions. With respect to the means of\r\nmodification, he attributed something to the direct action of the\r\nphysical conditions of life, something to the crossing of already\r\nexisting forms, and much to use and disuse, that is, to the effects of\r\nhabit. To this latter agency he seems to attribute all the beautiful\r\nadaptations in nature; such as the long neck of the giraffe for\r\nbrowsing on the branches of trees. But he likewise believed in a law of\r\nprogressive development, and as all the forms of life thus tend to\r\nprogress, in order to account for the existence at the present day of\r\nsimple productions, he maintains that such forms are now spontaneously\r\ngenerated.[2]\r\n\r\n [2] I have taken the date of the first publication of Lamarck from\r\n Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire’s (“Hist. Nat. Générale”, tom. ii. page\r\n 405, 1859) excellent history of opinion on this subject. In this work\r\n a full account is given of Buffon’s conclusions on the same subject.\r\n It is curious how largely my grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin,\r\n anticipated the views and erroneous grounds of opinion of Lamarck in\r\n his “Zoonomia” (vol. i. pages 500-510), published in 1794. According\r\n to Isid. Geoffroy there is no doubt that Goethe was an extreme\r\n partisan of similar views, as shown in the introduction to a work\r\n written in 1794 and 1795, but not published till long afterward; he\r\n has pointedly remarked (“Goethe als Naturforscher”, von Dr. Karl\r\n Meding, s. 34) that the future question for naturalists will be how,\r\n for instance, cattle got their horns and not for what they are used.\r\n It is rather a singular instance of the manner in which similar views\r\n arise at about the same time, that Goethe in Germany, Dr. Darwin in\r\n England, and Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (as we shall immediately see) in\r\n France, came to the same conclusion on the origin of species, in the\r\n years 1794-5.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire, as is stated in his “Life”, written by his son,\r\nsuspected, as early as 1795, that what we call species are various\r\ndegenerations of the same type. It was not until 1828 that he published\r\nhis conviction that the same forms have not been perpetuated since the\r\norigin of all things. Geoffroy seems to have relied chiefly on the\r\nconditions of life, or the “_monde ambiant_” as the cause of change. He\r\nwas cautious in drawing conclusions, and did not believe that existing\r\nspecies are now undergoing modification; and, as his son adds, “C’est\r\ndonc un problème à réserver entièrement à l’avenir, supposé même que\r\nl’avenir doive avoir prise sur lui.”\r\n\r\nIn 1813 Dr. W.C. Wells read before the Royal Society “An Account of a\r\nWhite Female, part of whose skin resembles that of a Negro”; but his\r\npaper was not published until his famous “Two Essays upon Dew and\r\nSingle Vision” appeared in 1818. In this paper he distinctly recognises\r\nthe principle of natural selection, and this is the first recognition\r\nwhich has been indicated; but he applies it only to the races of man,\r\nand to certain characters alone. After remarking that negroes and\r\nmulattoes enjoy an immunity from certain tropical diseases, he\r\nobserves, firstly, that all animals tend to vary in some degree, and,\r\nsecondly, that agriculturists improve their domesticated animals by\r\nselection; and then, he adds, but what is done in this latter case “by\r\nart, seems to be done with equal efficacy, though more slowly, by\r\nnature, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the\r\ncountry which they inhabit. Of the accidental varieties of man, which\r\nwould occur among the first few and scattered inhabitants of the middle\r\nregions of Africa, some one would be better fitted than others to bear\r\nthe diseases of the country. This race would consequently multiply,\r\nwhile the others would decrease; not only from their in ability to\r\nsustain the attacks of disease, but from their incapacity of contending\r\nwith their more vigorous neighbours. The colour of this vigorous race I\r\ntake for granted, from what has been already said, would be dark. But\r\nthe same disposition to form varieties still existing, a darker and a\r\ndarker race would in the course of time occur: and as the darkest would\r\nbe the best fitted for the climate, this would at length become the\r\nmost prevalent, if not the only race, in the particular country in\r\nwhich it had originated.” He then extends these same views to the white\r\ninhabitants of colder climates. I am indebted to Mr. Rowley, of the\r\nUnited States, for having called my attention, through Mr. Brace, to\r\nthe above passage of Dr. Wells’ work.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert, afterward Dean of Manchester, in the\r\nfourth volume of the “Horticultural Transactions”, 1822, and in his\r\nwork on the “Amaryllidaceæ” (1837, pages 19, 339), declares that\r\n“horticultural experiments have established, beyond the possibility of\r\nrefutation, that botanical species are only a higher and more permanent\r\nclass of varieties.” He extends the same view to animals. The dean\r\nbelieves that single species of each genus were created in an\r\noriginally highly plastic condition, and that these have produced,\r\nchiefly by inter-crossing, but likewise by variation, all our existing\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIn 1826 Professor Grant, in the concluding paragraph in his well-known\r\npaper (“Edinburgh Philosophical Journal”, vol. XIV, page 283) on the\r\nSpongilla, clearly declares his belief that species are descended from\r\nother species, and that they become improved in the course of\r\nmodification. This same view was given in his Fifty-fifth Lecture,\r\npublished in the “Lancet” in 1834.\r\n\r\nIn 1831 Mr. Patrick Matthew published his work on “Naval Timber and\r\nArboriculture”, in which he gives precisely the same view on the origin\r\nof species as that (presently to be alluded to) propounded by Mr.\r\nWallace and myself in the “Linnean Journal”, and as that enlarged in\r\nthe present volume. Unfortunately the view was given by Mr. Matthew\r\nvery briefly in scattered passages in an appendix to a work on a\r\ndifferent subject, so that it remained unnoticed until Mr. Matthew\r\nhimself drew attention to it in the “Gardeners’ Chronicle”, on April 7,\r\n1860. The differences of Mr. Matthew’s views from mine are not of much\r\nimportance: he seems to consider that the world was nearly depopulated\r\nat successive periods, and then restocked; and he gives as an\r\nalternative, that new forms may be generated “without the presence of\r\nany mold or germ of former aggregates.” I am not sure that I understand\r\nsome passages; but it seems that he attributes much influence to the\r\ndirect action of the conditions of life. He clearly saw, however, the\r\nfull force of the principle of natural selection.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated geologist and naturalist, Von Buch, in his excellent\r\n“Description Physique des Isles Canaries” (1836, page 147), clearly\r\nexpresses his belief that varieties slowly become changed into\r\npermanent species, which are no longer capable of intercrossing.\r\n\r\nRafinesque, in his “New Flora of North America”, published in 1836,\r\nwrote (page 6) as follows: “All species might have been varieties once,\r\nand many varieties are gradually becoming species by assuming constant\r\nand peculiar characters;” but further on (page 18) he adds, “except the\r\noriginal types or ancestors of the genus.”\r\n\r\nIn 1843-44 Professor Haldeman (“Boston Journal of Nat. Hist. U.\r\nStates”, vol. iv, page 468) has ably given the arguments for and\r\nagainst the hypothesis of the development and modification of species:\r\nhe seems to lean toward the side of change.\r\n\r\nThe “Vestiges of Creation” appeared in 1844. In the tenth and much\r\nimproved edition (1853) the anonymous author says (page 155): “The\r\nproposition determined on after much consideration is, that the several\r\nseries of animated beings, from the simplest and oldest up to the\r\nhighest and most recent, are, under the providence of God, the results,\r\n_first_, of an impulse which has been imparted to the forms of life,\r\nadvancing them, in definite times, by generation, through grades of\r\norganisation terminating in the highest dicotyledons and vertebrata,\r\nthese grades being few in number, and generally marked by intervals of\r\norganic character, which we find to be a practical difficulty in\r\nascertaining affinities; _second_, of another impulse connected with\r\nthe vital forces, tending, in the course of generations, to modify\r\norganic structures in accordance with external circumstances, as food,\r\nthe nature of the habitat, and the meteoric agencies, these being the\r\n‘adaptations’ of the natural theologian.” The author apparently\r\nbelieves that organisation progresses by sudden leaps, but that the\r\neffects produced by the conditions of life are gradual. He argues with\r\nmuch force on general grounds that species are not immutable\r\nproductions. But I cannot see how the two supposed “impulses” account\r\nin a scientific sense for the numerous and beautiful coadaptations\r\nwhich we see throughout nature; I cannot see that we thus gain any\r\ninsight how, for instance, a woodpecker has become adapted to its\r\npeculiar habits of life. The work, from its powerful and brilliant\r\nstyle, though displaying in the early editions little accurate\r\nknowledge and a great want of scientific caution, immediately had a\r\nvery wide circulation. In my opinion it has done excellent service in\r\nthis country in calling attention to the subject, in removing\r\nprejudice, and in thus preparing the ground for the reception of\r\nanalogous views.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 the veteran geologist M.J. d’Omalius d’Halloy published in an\r\nexcellent though short paper (“Bulletins de l’Acad. Roy. Bruxelles”,\r\ntom. xiii, page 581) his opinion that it is more probable that new\r\nspecies have been produced by descent with modification than that they\r\nhave been separately created: the author first promulgated this opinion\r\nin 1831.\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen, in 1849 (“Nature of Limbs”, page 86), wrote as follows:\r\n“The archetypal idea was manifested in the flesh under diverse such\r\nmodifications, upon this planet, long prior to the existence of those\r\nanimal species that actually exemplify it. To what natural laws or\r\nsecondary causes the orderly succession and progression of such organic\r\nphenomena may have been committed, we, as yet, are ignorant.” In his\r\naddress to the British Association, in 1858, he speaks (page li) of\r\n“the axiom of the continuous operation of creative power, or of the\r\nordained becoming of living things.” Further on (page xc), after\r\nreferring to geographical distribution, he adds, “These phenomena shake\r\nour confidence in the conclusion that the Apteryx of New Zealand and\r\nthe Red Grouse of England were distinct creations in and for those\r\nislands respectively. Always, also, it may be well to bear in mind that\r\nby the word ‘creation’ the zoologist means ‘a process he knows not\r\nwhat.’” He amplifies this idea by adding that when such cases as that\r\nof the Red Grouse are “enumerated by the zoologist as evidence of\r\ndistinct creation of the bird in and for such islands, he chiefly\r\nexpresses that he knows not how the Red Grouse came to be there, and\r\nthere exclusively; signifying also, by this mode of expressing such\r\nignorance, his belief that both the bird and the islands owed their\r\norigin to a great first Creative Cause.” If we interpret these\r\nsentences given in the same address, one by the other, it appears that\r\nthis eminent philosopher felt in 1858 his confidence shaken that the\r\nApteryx and the Red Grouse first appeared in their respective homes “he\r\nknew not how,” or by some process “he knew not what.”\r\n\r\nThis Address was delivered after the papers by Mr. Wallace and myself\r\non the Origin of Species, presently to be referred to, had been read\r\nbefore the Linnean Society. When the first edition of this work was\r\npublished, I was so completely deceived, as were many others, by such\r\nexpressions as “the continuous operation of creative power,” that I\r\nincluded Professor Owen with other palæontologists as being firmly\r\nconvinced of the immutability of species; but it appears (“Anat. of\r\nVertebrates”, vol. iii, page 796) that this was on my part a\r\npreposterous error. In the last edition of this work I inferred, and\r\nthe inference still seems to me perfectly just, from a passage\r\nbeginning with the words “no doubt the type-form,” &c.(Ibid., vol. i,\r\npage xxxv), that Professor Owen admitted that natural selection may\r\nhave done something in the formation of a new species; but this it\r\nappears (Ibid., vol. iii. page 798) is inaccurate and without evidence.\r\nI also gave some extracts from a correspondence between Professor Owen\r\nand the editor of the “London Review”, from which it appeared manifest\r\nto the editor as well as to myself, that Professor Owen claimed to have\r\npromulgated the theory of natural selection before I had done so; and I\r\nexpressed my surprise and satisfaction at this announcement; but as far\r\nas it is possible to understand certain recently published passages\r\n(Ibid., vol. iii. page 798) I have either partially or wholly again\r\nfallen into error. It is consolatory to me that others find Professor\r\nOwen’s controversial writings as difficult to understand and to\r\nreconcile with each other, as I do. As far as the mere enunciation of\r\nthe principle of natural selection is concerned, it is quite immaterial\r\nwhether or not Professor Owen preceded me, for both of us, as shown in\r\nthis historical sketch, were long ago preceded by Dr. Wells and Mr.\r\nMatthews.\r\n\r\nM. Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, in his lectures delivered in 1850\r\n(of which a Résumé appeared in the “Revue et Mag. de Zoolog.”, Jan.,\r\n1851), briefly gives his reason for believing that specific characters\r\n“sont fixés, pour chaque espèce, tant qu’elle se perpétue au milieu des\r\nmêmes circonstances: ils se modifient, si les circonstances ambiantes\r\nviennent à changer. En résumé, _l’observation_ des animaux sauvages\r\ndémontre deja la variabilité _limitée_ des espèces. Les _expériences_\r\nsur les animaux sauvages devenus domestiques, et sur les animaux\r\ndomestiques redevenus sauvages, la démontrent plus clairment encore.\r\nCes mêmes expériences prouvent, de plus, que les différences produites\r\npeuvent être de _valeur générique_.” In his “Hist. Nat. Générale” (tom.\r\nii, page 430, 1859) he amplifies analogous conclusions.\r\n\r\nFrom a circular lately issued it appears that Dr. Freke, in 1851\r\n(“Dublin Medical Press”, page 322), propounded the doctrine that all\r\norganic beings have descended from one primordial form. His grounds of\r\nbelief and treatment of the subject are wholly different from mine; but\r\nas Dr. Freke has now (1861) published his Essay on the “Origin of\r\nSpecies by means of Organic Affinity”, the difficult attempt to give\r\nany idea of his views would be superfluous on my part.\r\n\r\nMr. Herbert Spencer, in an Essay (originally published in the “Leader”,\r\nMarch, 1852, and republished in his “Essays”, in 1858), has contrasted\r\nthe theories of the Creation and the Development of organic beings with\r\nremarkable skill and force. He argues from the analogy of domestic\r\nproductions, from the changes which the embryos of many species\r\nundergo, from the difficulty of distinguishing species and varieties,\r\nand from the principle of general gradation, that species have been\r\nmodified; and he attributes the modification to the change of\r\ncircumstances. The author (1855) has also treated Psychology on the\r\nprinciple of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and\r\ncapacity by gradation.\r\n\r\nIn 1852 M. Naudin, a distinguished botanist, expressly stated, in an\r\nadmirable paper on the Origin of Species (“Revue Horticole”, page 102;\r\nsince partly republished in the “Nouvelles Archives du Muséum”, tom. i,\r\np. 171), his belief that species are formed in an analogous manner as\r\nvarieties are under cultivation; and the latter process he attributes\r\nto man’s power of selection. But he does not show how selection acts\r\nunder nature. He believes, like Dean Herbert, that species, when\r\nnascent, were more plastic than at present. He lays weight on what he\r\ncalls the principle of finality, “puissance mystérieuse, indéterminée;\r\nfatalité pour les uns; pour les autres volonté providentielle, dont\r\nl’action incessante sur les êtres vivantes détermine, à toutes les\r\népoques de l’existence du monde, la forme, le volume, et la durée de\r\nchacun d’eux, en raison de sa destinée dans l’ordre de choses dont il\r\nfait partie. C’est cette puissance qui harmonise chaque membre à\r\nl’ensemble, en l’appropriant à la fonction qu’il doit remplir dans\r\nl’organisme général de la nature, fonction qui est pour lui sa raison\r\nd’être.”[3]\r\n\r\n [3] From references in Bronn’s “Untersuchungen über die\r\n Entwickelungs-Gesetze”, it appears that the celebrated botanist and\r\n palæontologist Unger published, in 1852, his belief that species\r\n undergo development and modification. Dalton, likewise, in Pander and\r\n Dalton’s work on Fossil Sloths, expressed, in 1821, a similar belief.\r\n Similar views have, as is well known, been maintained by Oken in his\r\n mystical “Natur-Philosophie”. From other references in Godron’s work\r\n “Sur l’Espèce”, it seems that Bory St. Vincent, Burdach, Poiret and\r\n Fries, have all admitted that new species are continually being\r\n produced.\r\n    I may add, that of the thirty-four authors named in this Historical\r\n    Sketch, who believe in the modification of species, or at least\r\n    disbelieve in separate acts of creation, twenty-seven have written\r\n    on special branches of natural history or geology.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1853 a celebrated geologist, Count Keyserling (“Bulletin de la Soc.\r\nGeolog.”, 2nd Ser., tom. x, page 357), suggested that as new diseases,\r\nsupposed to have been caused by some miasma have arisen and spread over\r\nthe world, so at certain periods the germs of existing species may have\r\nbeen chemically affected by circumambient molecules of a particular\r\nnature, and thus have given rise to new forms.\r\n\r\nIn this same year, 1853, Dr. Schaaffhausen published an excellent\r\npamphlet (“Verhand. des Naturhist. Vereins der Preuss. Rheinlands”,\r\n&c.), in which he maintains the development of organic forms on the\r\nearth. He infers that many species have kept true for long periods,\r\nwhereas a few have become modified. The distinction of species he\r\nexplains by the destruction of intermediate graduated forms. “Thus\r\nliving plants and animals are not separated from the extinct by new\r\ncreations, but are to be regarded as their descendants through\r\ncontinued reproduction.”\r\n\r\nA well-known French botanist, M. Lecoq, writes in 1854 (“Etudes sur\r\nGéograph.” Bot. tom. i, page 250), “On voit que nos recherches sur la\r\nfixité ou la variation de l’espéce, nous conduisent directement aux\r\nidées émises par deux hommes justement célèbres, Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire\r\net Goethe.” Some other passages scattered through M. Lecoq’s large work\r\nmake it a little doubtful how far he extends his views on the\r\nmodification of species.\r\n\r\nThe “Philosophy of Creation” has been treated in a masterly manner by\r\nthe Rev. Baden Powell, in his “Essays on the Unity of Worlds”, 1855.\r\nNothing can be more striking than the manner in which he shows that the\r\nintroduction of new species is “a regular, not a casual phenomenon,”\r\nor, as Sir John Herschel expresses it, “a natural in contradistinction\r\nto a miraculous process.”\r\n\r\nThe third volume of the “Journal of the Linnean Society” contains\r\npapers, read July 1, 1858, by Mr. Wallace and myself, in which, as\r\nstated in the introductory remarks to this volume, the theory of\r\nNatural Selection is promulgated by Mr. Wallace with admirable force\r\nand clearness.\r\n\r\nVon Baer, toward whom all zoologists feel so profound a respect,\r\nexpressed about the year 1859 (see Prof. Rudolph Wagner,\r\n“Zoologisch-Anthropologische Untersuchungen”, 1861, s. 51) his\r\nconviction, chiefly grounded on the laws of geographical distribution,\r\nthat forms now perfectly distinct have descended from a single\r\nparent-form.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1859, Professor Huxley gave a lecture before the Royal\r\nInstitution on the ‘Persistent Types of Animal Life’. Referring to such\r\ncases, he remarks, “It is difficult to comprehend the meaning of such\r\nfacts as these, if we suppose that each species of animal and plant, or\r\neach great type of organisation, was formed and placed upon the surface\r\nof the globe at long intervals by a distinct act of creative power; and\r\nit is well to recollect that such an assumption is as unsupported by\r\ntradition or revelation as it is opposed to the general analogy of\r\nnature. If, on the other hand, we view ‘Persistent Types’ in relation\r\nto that hypothesis which supposes the species living at any time to be\r\nthe result of the gradual modification of pre-existing species, a\r\nhypothesis which, though unproven, and sadly damaged by some of its\r\nsupporters, is yet the only one to which physiology lends any\r\ncountenance; their existence would seem to show that the amount of\r\nmodification which living beings have undergone during geological time\r\nis but very small in relation to the whole series of changes which they\r\nhave suffered.”\r\n\r\nIn December, 1859, Dr. Hooker published his “Introduction to the\r\nAustralian Flora”. In the first part of this great work he admits the\r\ntruth of the descent and modification of species, and supports this\r\ndoctrine by many original observations.\r\n\r\nThe first edition of this work was published on November 24, 1859, and\r\nthe second edition on January 7, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\n\r\nAN HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE PROGRESS OF OPINION ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.

Beagle, as naturalist, I was much struck with\r\ncertain facts in the distribution of the organic beings inhabiting\r\nSouth America, and in the geological relations of the present to the\r\npast inhabitants of that continent. These facts, as will be seen in the\r\nlatter chapters of this volume, seemed to throw some light on the\r\norigin of species—that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by\r\none of our greatest philosophers. On my return home, it occurred to me,\r\nin 1837, that something might perhaps be made out on this question by\r\npatiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could\r\npossibly have any bearing on it. After five years’ work I allowed\r\nmyself to speculate on the subject, and drew up some short notes; these\r\nI enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions, which then seemed\r\nto me probable: from that period to the present day I have steadily\r\npursued the same object. I hope that I may be excused for entering on\r\nthese personal details, as I give them to show that I have not been\r\nhasty in coming to a decision.\r\n\r\nMy work is now (1859) nearly finished; but as it will take me many more\r\nyears to complete it, and as my health is far from strong, I have been\r\nurged to publish this abstract. I have more especially been induced to\r\ndo this, as Mr. Wallace, who is now studying the natural history of the\r\nMalay Archipelago, has arrived at almost exactly the same general\r\nconclusions that I have on the origin of species. In 1858 he sent me a\r\nmemoir on this subject, with a request that I would forward it to Sir\r\nCharles Lyell, who sent it to the Linnean Society, and it is published\r\nin the third volume of the Journal of that Society. Sir C. Lyell and\r\nDr. Hooker, who both knew of my work—the latter having read my sketch\r\nof 1844—honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish, with Mr.\r\nWallace’s excellent memoir, some brief extracts from my manuscripts.\r\n\r\nThis abstract, which I now publish, must necessarily be imperfect. I\r\ncannot here give references and authorities for my several statements;\r\nand I must trust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy.\r\nNo doubt errors may have crept in, though I hope I have always been\r\ncautious in trusting to good authorities alone. I can here give only\r\nthe general conclusions at which I have arrived, with a few facts in\r\nillustration, but which, I hope, in most cases will suffice. No one can\r\nfeel more sensible than I do of the necessity of hereafter publishing\r\nin detail all the facts, with references, on which my conclusions have\r\nbeen grounded; and I hope in a future work to do this. For I am well\r\naware that scarcely a single point is discussed in this volume on which\r\nfacts cannot be adduced, often apparently leading to conclusions\r\ndirectly opposite to those at which I have arrived. A fair result can\r\nbe obtained only by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments\r\non both sides of each question; and this is here impossible.\r\n\r\nI much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of\r\nacknowledging the generous assistance which I have received from very\r\nmany naturalists, some of them personally unknown to me. I cannot,\r\nhowever, let this opportunity pass without expressing my deep\r\nobligations to Dr. Hooker, who, for the last fifteen years, has aided\r\nme in every possible way by his large stores of knowledge and his\r\nexcellent judgment.\r\n\r\nIn considering the origin of species, it is quite conceivable that a\r\nnaturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on\r\ntheir embryological relations, their geographical distribution,\r\ngeological succession, and other such facts, might come to the\r\nconclusion that species had not been independently created, but had\r\ndescended, like varieties, from other species. Nevertheless, such a\r\nconclusion, even if well founded, would be unsatisfactory, until it\r\ncould be shown how the innumerable species, inhabiting this world have\r\nbeen modified, so as to acquire that perfection of structure and\r\ncoadaptation which justly excites our admiration. Naturalists\r\ncontinually refer to external conditions, such as climate, food, &c.,\r\nas the only possible cause of variation. In one limited sense, as we\r\nshall hereafter see, this may be true; but it is preposterous to\r\nattribute to mere external conditions, the structure, for instance, of\r\nthe woodpecker, with its feet, tail, beak, and tongue, so admirably\r\nadapted to catch insects under the bark of trees. In the case of the\r\nmistletoe, which draws its nourishment from certain trees, which has\r\nseeds that must be transported by certain birds, and which has flowers\r\nwith separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain insects\r\nto bring pollen from one flower to the other, it is equally\r\npreposterous to account for the structure of this parasite, with its\r\nrelations to several distinct organic beings, by the effects of\r\nexternal conditions, or of habit, or of the volition of the plant\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, of the highest importance to gain a clear insight\r\ninto the means of modification and coadaptation. At the commencement of\r\nmy observations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of\r\ndomesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best\r\nchance of making out this obscure problem. Nor have I been\r\ndisappointed; in this and in all other perplexing cases I have\r\ninvariably found that our knowledge, imperfect though it be, of\r\nvariation under domestication, afforded the best and safest clue. I may\r\nventure to express my conviction of the high value of such studies,\r\nalthough they have been very commonly neglected by naturalists.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations, I shall devote the first chapter of this\r\nabstract to variation under domestication. We shall thus see that a\r\nlarge amount of hereditary modification is at least possible; and, what\r\nis equally or more important, we shall see how great is the power of\r\nman in accumulating by his selection successive slight variations. I\r\nwill then pass on to the variability of species in a state of nature;\r\nbut I shall, unfortunately, be compelled to treat this subject far too\r\nbriefly, as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues\r\nof facts. We shall, however, be enabled to discuss what circumstances\r\nare most favourable to variation. In the next chapter the struggle for\r\nexistence among all organic beings throughout the world, which\r\ninevitably follows from the high geometrical ratio of their increase,\r\nwill be considered. This is the doctrine of Malthus, applied to the\r\nwhole animal and vegetable kingdoms. As many more individuals of each\r\nspecies are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there\r\nis a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any\r\nbeing, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself,\r\nunder the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a\r\nbetter chance of surviving, and thus be _naturally selected_. From the\r\nstrong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to\r\npropagate its new and modified form.\r\n\r\nThis fundamental subject of natural selection will be treated at some\r\nlength in the fourth chapter; and we shall then see how natural\r\nselection almost inevitably causes much extinction of the less improved\r\nforms of life, and leads to what I have called divergence of character.\r\nIn the next chapter I shall discuss the complex and little known laws\r\nof variation. In the five succeeding chapters, the most apparent and\r\ngravest difficulties in accepting the theory will be given: namely,\r\nfirst, the difficulties of transitions, or how a simple being or a\r\nsimple organ can be changed and perfected into a highly developed being\r\nor into an elaborately constructed organ; secondly the subject of\r\ninstinct, or the mental powers of animals; thirdly, hybridism, or the\r\ninfertility of species and the fertility of varieties when\r\nintercrossed; and fourthly, the imperfection of the geological record.\r\nIn the next chapter I shall consider the geological succession of\r\norganic beings throughout time; in the twelfth and thirteenth, their\r\ngeographical distribution throughout space; in the fourteenth, their\r\nclassification or mutual affinities, both when mature and in an\r\nembryonic condition. In the last chapter I shall give a brief\r\nrecapitulation of the whole work, and a few concluding remarks.\r\n\r\nNo one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in\r\nregard to the origin of species and varieties, if he make due allowance\r\nfor our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of the\r\nmany beings which live around us. Who can explain why one species\r\nranges widely and is very numerous, and why another allied species has\r\na narrow range and is rare? Yet these relations are of the highest\r\nimportance, for they determine the present welfare and, as I believe,\r\nthe future success and modification of every inhabitant of this world.\r\nStill less do we know of the mutual relations of the innumerable\r\ninhabitants of the world during the many past geological epochs in its\r\nhistory. Although much remains obscure, and will long remain obscure, I\r\ncan entertain no doubt, after the most deliberate study and\r\ndispassionate judgment of which I am capable, that the view which most\r\nnaturalists until recently entertained, and which I formerly\r\nentertained—namely, that each species has been independently created—is\r\nerroneous. I am fully convinced that species are not immutable; but\r\nthat those belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal\r\ndescendants of some other and generally extinct species, in the same\r\nmanner as the acknowledged varieties of any one species are the\r\ndescendants of that species. Furthermore, I am convinced that natural\r\nselection has been the most important, but not the exclusive, means of\r\nmodification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nVARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nCauses of Variability—Effects of Habit and the use and disuse of\r\nParts—Correlated Variation—Inheritance—Character of Domestic\r\nVarieties—Difficulty of distinguishing between Varieties and\r\nSpecies—Origin of Domestic Varieties from one or more Species—Domestic\r\nPigeons, their Differences and Origin—Principles of Selection,\r\nanciently followed, their Effects—Methodical and Unconscious\r\nSelection—Unknown Origin of our Domestic Productions—Circumstances\r\nfavourable to Man’s power of Selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Causes of Variability._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of\r\nour older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which\r\nstrikes us is, that they generally differ more from each other than do\r\nthe individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature. And\r\nif we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which\r\nhave been cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the\r\nmost different climates and treatment, we are driven to conclude that\r\nthis great variability is due to our domestic productions having been\r\nraised under conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat\r\ndifferent from, those to which the parent species had been exposed\r\nunder nature. There is, also, some probability in the view propounded\r\nby Andrew Knight, that this variability may be partly connected with\r\nexcess of food. It seems clear that organic beings must be exposed\r\nduring several generations to new conditions to cause any great amount\r\nof variation; and that, when the organisation has once begun to vary,\r\nit generally continues varying for many generations. No case is on\r\nrecord of a variable organism ceasing to vary under cultivation. Our\r\noldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still yield new varieties: our\r\noldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or\r\nmodification.\r\n\r\nAs far as I am able to judge, after long attending to the subject, the\r\nconditions of life appear to act in two ways—directly on the whole\r\norganisation or on certain parts alone and in directly by affecting the\r\nreproductive system. With respect to the direct action, we must bear in\r\nmind that in every case, as Professor Weismann has lately insisted, and\r\nas I have incidently shown in my work on “Variation under\r\nDomestication,” there are two factors: namely, the nature of the\r\norganism and the nature of the conditions. The former seems to be much\r\nthe more important; for nearly similar variations sometimes arise\r\nunder, as far as we can judge, dissimilar conditions; and, on the other\r\nhand, dissimilar variations arise under conditions which appear to be\r\nnearly uniform. The effects on the offspring are either definite or in\r\ndefinite. They may be considered as definite when all or nearly all the\r\noffspring of individuals exposed to certain conditions during several\r\ngenerations are modified in the same manner. It is extremely difficult\r\nto come to any conclusion in regard to the extent of the changes which\r\nhave been thus definitely induced. There can, however, be little doubt\r\nabout many slight changes, such as size from the amount of food, colour\r\nfrom the nature of the food, thickness of the skin and hair from\r\nclimate, &c. Each of the endless variations which we see in the plumage\r\nof our fowls must have had some efficient cause; and if the same cause\r\nwere to act uniformly during a long series of generations on many\r\nindividuals, all probably would be modified in the same manner. Such\r\nfacts as the complex and extraordinary out growths which variably\r\nfollow from the insertion of a minute drop of poison by a\r\ngall-producing insect, shows us what singular modifications might\r\nresult in the case of plants from a chemical change in the nature of\r\nthe sap.\r\n\r\nIn definite variability is a much more common result of changed\r\nconditions than definite variability, and has probably played a more\r\nimportant part in the formation of our domestic races. We see in\r\ndefinite variability in the endless slight peculiarities which\r\ndistinguish the individuals of the same species, and which cannot be\r\naccounted for by inheritance from either parent or from some more\r\nremote ancestor. Even strongly-marked differences occasionally appear\r\nin the young of the same litter, and in seedlings from the same\r\nseed-capsule. At long intervals of time, out of millions of individuals\r\nreared in the same country and fed on nearly the same food, deviations\r\nof structure so strongly pronounced as to deserve to be called\r\nmonstrosities arise; but monstrosities cannot be separated by any\r\ndistinct line from slighter variations. All such changes of structure,\r\nwhether extremely slight or strongly marked, which appear among many\r\nindividuals living together, may be considered as the in definite\r\neffects of the conditions of life on each individual organism, in\r\nnearly the same manner as the chill effects different men in an in\r\ndefinite manner, according to their state of body or constitution,\r\ncausing coughs or colds, rheumatism, or inflammation of various organs.\r\n\r\nWith respect to what I have called the in direct action of changed\r\nconditions, namely, through the reproductive system of being affected,\r\nwe may infer that variability is thus induced, partly from the fact of\r\nthis system being extremely sensitive to any change in the conditions,\r\nand partly from the similarity, as Kölreuter and others have remarked,\r\nbetween the variability which follows from the crossing of distinct\r\nspecies, and that which may be observed with plants and animals when\r\nreared under new or unnatural conditions. Many facts clearly show how\r\neminently susceptible the reproductive system is to very slight changes\r\nin the surrounding conditions. Nothing is more easy than to tame an\r\nanimal, and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely\r\nunder confinement, even when the male and female unite. How many\r\nanimals there are which will not breed, though kept in an almost free\r\nstate in their native country! This is generally, but erroneously\r\nattributed to vitiated instincts. Many cultivated plants display the\r\nutmost vigour, and yet rarely or never seed! In some few cases it has\r\nbeen discovered that a very trifling change, such as a little more or\r\nless water at some particular period of growth, will determine whether\r\nor not a plant will produce seeds. I cannot here give the details which\r\nI have collected and elsewhere published on this curious subject; but\r\nto show how singular the laws are which determine the reproduction of\r\nanimals under confinement, I may mention that carnivorous animals, even\r\nfrom the tropics, breed in this country pretty freely under\r\nconfinement, with the exception of the plantigrades or bear family,\r\nwhich seldom produce young; whereas, carnivorous birds, with the rarest\r\nexception, hardly ever lay fertile eggs. Many exotic plants have pollen\r\nutterly worthless, in the same condition as in the most sterile\r\nhybrids. When, on the one hand, we see domesticated animals and plants,\r\nthough often weak and sickly, breeding freely under confinement; and\r\nwhen, on the other hand, we see individuals, though taken young from a\r\nstate of nature perfectly tamed, long-lived, and healthy (of which I\r\ncould give numerous instances), yet having their reproductive system so\r\nseriously affected by unperceived causes as to fail to act, we need not\r\nbe surprised at this system, when it does act under confinement, acting\r\nirregularly, and producing offspring somewhat unlike their parents. I\r\nmay add that as some organisms breed freely under the most unnatural\r\nconditions—for instance, rabbits and ferrets kept in hutches—showing\r\nthat their reproductive organs are not easily affected; so will some\r\nanimals and plants withstand domestication or cultivation, and vary\r\nvery slightly—perhaps hardly more than in a state of nature.\r\n\r\nSome naturalists have maintained that all variations are connected with\r\nthe act of sexual reproduction; but this is certainly an error; for I\r\nhave given in another work a long list of “sporting plants;” as they\r\nare called by gardeners; that is, of plants which have suddenly\r\nproduced a single bud with a new and sometimes widely different\r\ncharacter from that of the other buds on the same plant. These bud\r\nvariations, as they may be named, can be propagated by grafts, offsets,\r\n&c., and sometimes by seed. They occur rarely under nature, but are far\r\nfrom rare under culture. As a single bud out of many thousands produced\r\nyear after year on the same tree under uniform conditions, has been\r\nknown suddenly to assume a new character; and as buds on distinct\r\ntrees, growing under different conditions, have sometimes yielded\r\nnearly the same variety—for instance, buds on peach-trees producing\r\nnectarines, and buds on common roses producing moss-roses—we clearly\r\nsee that the nature of the conditions is of subordinate importance in\r\ncomparison with the nature of the organism in determining each\r\nparticular form of variation; perhaps of not more importance than the\r\nnature of the spark, by which a mass of combustible matter is ignited,\r\nhas in determining the nature of the flames.\r\n\r\n_Effects of Habit and of the Use or Disuse of Parts; Correlated\r\nVariation; Inheritance._\r\n\r\n\r\nChanged habits produce an inherited effect as in the period of the\r\nflowering of plants when transported from one climate to another. With\r\nanimals the increased use or disuse of parts has had a more marked\r\ninfluence; thus I find in the domestic duck that the bones of the wing\r\nweigh less and the bones of the leg more, in proportion to the whole\r\nskeleton, than do the same bones in the wild duck; and this change may\r\nbe safely attributed to the domestic duck flying much less, and walking\r\nmore, than its wild parents. The great and inherited development of the\r\nudders in cows and goats in countries where they are habitually milked,\r\nin comparison with these organs in other countries, is probably another\r\ninstance of the effects of use. Not one of our domestic animals can be\r\nnamed which has not in some country drooping ears; and the view which\r\nhas been suggested that the drooping is due to disuse of the muscles of\r\nthe ear, from the animals being seldom much alarmed, seems probable.\r\n\r\nMany laws regulate variation, some few of which can be dimly seen, and\r\nwill hereafter be briefly discussed. I will here only allude to what\r\nmay be called correlated variation. Important changes in the embryo or\r\nlarva will probably entail changes in the mature animal. In\r\nmonstrosities, the correlations between quite distinct parts are very\r\ncurious; and many instances are given in Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire’s\r\ngreat work on this subject. Breeders believe that long limbs are almost\r\nalways accompanied by an elongated head. Some instances of correlation\r\nare quite whimsical; thus cats which are entirely white and have blue\r\neyes are generally deaf; but it has been lately stated by Mr. Tait that\r\nthis is confined to the males. Colour and constitutional peculiarities\r\ngo together, of which many remarkable cases could be given among\r\nanimals and plants. From facts collected by Heusinger, it appears that\r\nwhite sheep and pigs are injured by certain plants, while dark-coloured\r\nindividuals escape: Professor Wyman has recently communicated to me a\r\ngood illustration of this fact; on asking some farmers in Virginia how\r\nit was that all their pigs were black, they informed him that the pigs\r\nate the paint-root (Lachnanthes), which coloured their bones pink, and\r\nwhich caused the hoofs of all but the black varieties to drop off; and\r\none of the “crackers” (_i.e._ Virginia squatters) added, “we select the\r\nblack members of a litter for raising, as they alone have a good chance\r\nof living.” Hairless dogs have imperfect teeth; long-haired and\r\ncoarse-haired animals are apt to have, as is asserted, long or many\r\nhorns; pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes;\r\npigeons with short beaks have small feet, and those with long beaks\r\nlarge feet. Hence if man goes on selecting, and thus augmenting, any\r\npeculiarity, he will almost certainly modify unintentionally other\r\nparts of the structure, owing to the mysterious laws of correlation.\r\n\r\nThe results of the various, unknown, or but dimly understood laws of\r\nvariation are infinitely complex and diversified. It is well worth\r\nwhile carefully to study the several treatises on some of our old\r\ncultivated plants, as on the hyacinth, potato, even the dahlia, &c.;\r\nand it is really surprising to note the endless points of structure and\r\nconstitution in which the varieties and sub-varieties differ slightly\r\nfrom each other. The whole organisation seems to have become plastic,\r\nand departs in a slight degree from that of the parental type.\r\n\r\nAny variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us. But the\r\nnumber and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both those\r\nof slight and those of considerable physiological importance, are\r\nendless. Dr. Prosper Lucas’ treatise, in two large volumes, is the\r\nfullest and the best on this subject. No breeder doubts how strong is\r\nthe tendency to inheritance; that like produces like is his fundamental\r\nbelief: doubts have been thrown on this principle only by theoretical\r\nwriters. When any deviation of structure often appears, and we see it\r\nin the father and child, we cannot tell whether it may not be due to\r\nthe same cause having acted on both; but when among individuals,\r\napparently exposed to the same conditions, any very rare deviation, due\r\nto some extraordinary combination of circumstances, appears in the\r\nparent—say, once among several million individuals—and it reappears in\r\nthe child, the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute\r\nits reappearance to inheritance. Every one must have heard of cases of\r\nalbinism, prickly skin, hairy bodies, &c., appearing in several members\r\nof the same family. If strange and rare deviations of structure are\r\ntruly inherited, less strange and commoner deviations may be freely\r\nadmitted to be inheritable. Perhaps the correct way of viewing the\r\nwhole subject would be, to look at the inheritance of every character\r\nwhatever as the rule, and non-inheritance as the anomaly.\r\n\r\nThe laws governing inheritance are for the most part unknown; no one\r\ncan say why the same peculiarity in different individuals of the same\r\nspecies, or in different species, is sometimes inherited and sometimes\r\nnot so; why the child often reverts in certain characteristics to its\r\ngrandfather or grandmother or more remote ancestor; why a peculiarity\r\nis often transmitted from one sex to both sexes, or to one sex alone,\r\nmore commonly but not exclusively to the like sex. It is a fact of some\r\nimportance to us, that peculiarities appearing in the males of our\r\ndomestic breeds are often transmitted, either exclusively or in a much\r\ngreater degree, to the males alone. A much more important rule, which I\r\nthink may be trusted, is that, at whatever period of life a peculiarity\r\nfirst appears, it tends to reappear in the offspring at a corresponding\r\nage, though sometimes earlier. In many cases this could not be\r\notherwise; thus the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cattle\r\ncould appear only in the offspring when nearly mature; peculiarities in\r\nthe silk-worm are known to appear at the corresponding caterpillar or\r\ncocoon stage. But hereditary diseases and some other facts make me\r\nbelieve that the rule has a wider extension, and that, when there is no\r\napparent reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age,\r\nyet that it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at\r\nwhich it first appeared in the parent. I believe this rule to be of the\r\nhighest importance in explaining the laws of embryology. These remarks\r\nare of course confined to the first _appearance_ of the peculiarity,\r\nand not to the primary cause which may have acted on the ovules or on\r\nthe male element; in nearly the same manner as the increased length of\r\nthe horns in the offspring from a short-horned cow by a long-horned\r\nbull, though appearing late in life, is clearly due to the male\r\nelement.\r\n\r\nHaving alluded to the subject of reversion, I may here refer to a\r\nstatement often made by naturalists—namely, that our domestic\r\nvarieties, when run wild, gradually but invariably revert in character\r\nto their aboriginal stocks. Hence it has been argued that no deductions\r\ncan be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature. I\r\nhave in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above\r\nstatement has so often and so boldly been made. There would be great\r\ndifficulty in proving its truth: we may safely conclude that very many\r\nof the most strongly marked domestic varieties could not possibly live\r\nin a wild state. In many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock\r\nwas, and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had\r\nensued. It would be necessary, in order to prevent the effects of\r\nintercrossing, that only a single variety should be turned loose in its\r\nnew home. Nevertheless, as our varieties certainly do occasionally\r\nrevert in some of their characters to ancestral forms, it seems to me\r\nnot improbable that if we could succeed in naturalising, or were to\r\ncultivate, during many generations, the several races, for instance, of\r\nthe cabbage, in very poor soil—in which case, however, some effect\r\nwould have to be attributed to the _definite_ action of the poor\r\nsoil—that they would, to a large extent, or even wholly, revert to the\r\nwild aboriginal stock. Whether or not the experiment would succeed is\r\nnot of great importance for our line of argument; for by the experiment\r\nitself the conditions of life are changed. If it could be shown that\r\nour domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion—that\r\nis, to lose their acquired characters, while kept under the same\r\nconditions and while kept in a considerable body, so that free\r\nintercrossing might check, by blending together, any slight deviations\r\nin their structure, in such case, I grant that we could deduce nothing\r\nfrom domestic varieties in regard to species. But there is not a shadow\r\nof evidence in favour of this view: to assert that we could not breed\r\nour cart and race-horses, long and short-horned cattle, and poultry of\r\nvarious breeds, and esculent vegetables, for an unlimited number of\r\ngenerations, would be opposed to all experience.\r\n\r\n_Character of Domestic Varieties; difficulty of distinguishing between\r\nVarieties and Species; origin of Domestic Varieties from one or more\r\nSpecies._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic\r\nanimals and plants, and compare them with closely allied species, we\r\ngenerally perceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less\r\nuniformity of character than in true species. Domestic races often have\r\na somewhat monstrous character; by which I mean, that, although\r\ndiffering from each other and from other species of the same genus, in\r\nseveral trifling respects, they often differ in an extreme degree in\r\nsome one part, both when compared one with another, and more especially\r\nwhen compared with the species under nature to which they are nearest\r\nallied. With these exceptions (and with that of the perfect fertility\r\nof varieties when crossed—a subject hereafter to be discussed),\r\ndomestic races of the same species differ from each other in the same\r\nmanner as do the closely allied species of the same genus in a state of\r\nnature, but the differences in most cases are less in degree. This must\r\nbe admitted as true, for the domestic races of many animals and plants\r\nhave been ranked by some competent judges as the descendants of\r\naboriginally distinct species, and by other competent judges as mere\r\nvarieties. If any well marked distinction existed between a domestic\r\nrace and a species, this source of doubt would not so perpetually\r\nrecur. It has often been stated that domestic races do not differ from\r\neach other in characters of generic value. It can be shown that this\r\nstatement is not correct; but naturalists differ much in determining\r\nwhat characters are of generic value; all such valuations being at\r\npresent empirical. When it is explained how genera originate under\r\nnature, it will be seen that we have no right to expect often to find a\r\ngeneric amount of difference in our domesticated races.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to estimate the amount of structural difference between\r\nallied domestic races, we are soon involved in doubt, from not knowing\r\nwhether they are descended from one or several parent species. This\r\npoint, if it could be cleared up, would be interesting; if, for\r\ninstance, it could be shown that the greyhound, bloodhound, terrier,\r\nspaniel and bull-dog, which we all know propagate their kind truly,\r\nwere the offspring of any single species, then such facts would have\r\ngreat weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many\r\nclosely allied natural species—for instance, of the many\r\nfoxes—inhabiting the different quarters of the world. I do not believe,\r\nas we shall presently see, that the whole amount of difference between\r\nthe several breeds of the dog has been produced under domestication; I\r\nbelieve that a small part of the difference is due to their being\r\ndescended from distinct species. In the case of strongly marked races\r\nof some other domesticated species, there is presumptive or even strong\r\nevidence that all are descended from a single wild stock.\r\n\r\nIt has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals\r\nand plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary, and\r\nlikewise to withstand diverse climates. I do not dispute that these\r\ncapacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated\r\nproductions; but how could a savage possibly know, when he first tamed\r\nan animal, whether it would vary in succeeding generations, and whether\r\nit would endure other climates? Has the little variability of the ass\r\nand goose, or the small power of endurance of warmth by the reindeer,\r\nor of cold by the common camel, prevented their domestication? I cannot\r\ndoubt that if other animals and plants, equal in number to our\r\ndomesticated productions, and belonging to equally diverse classes and\r\ncountries, were taken from a state of nature, and could be made to\r\nbreed for an equal number of generations under domestication, they\r\nwould on an average vary as largely as the parent species of our\r\nexisting domesticated productions have varied.\r\n\r\nIn the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants,\r\nit is not possible to come to any definite conclusion, whether they are\r\ndescended from one or several wild species. The argument mainly relied\r\non by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic animals\r\nis, that we find in the most ancient times, on the monuments of Egypt,\r\nand in the lake-habitations of Switzerland, much diversity in the\r\nbreeds; and that some of these ancient breeds closely resemble, or are\r\neven identical with, those still existing. But this only throws far\r\nbackward the history of civilisation, and shows that animals were\r\ndomesticated at a much earlier period than has hitherto been supposed.\r\nThe lake-inhabitants of Switzerland cultivated several kinds of wheat\r\nand barley, the pea, the poppy for oil and flax; and they possessed\r\nseveral domesticated animals. They also carried on commerce with other\r\nnations. All this clearly shows, as Heer has remarked, that they had at\r\nthis early age progressed considerably in civilisation; and this again\r\nimplies a long continued previous period of less advanced civilisation,\r\nduring which the domesticated animals, kept by different tribes in\r\ndifferent districts, might have varied and given rise to distinct\r\nraces. Since the discovery of flint tools in the superficial formations\r\nof many parts of the world, all geologists believe that barbarian men\r\nexisted at an enormously remote period; and we know that at the present\r\nday there is hardly a tribe so barbarous as not to have domesticated at\r\nleast the dog.\r\n\r\nThe origin of most of our domestic animals will probably forever remain\r\nvague. But I may here state that, looking to the domestic dogs of the\r\nwhole world, I have, after a laborious collection of all known facts,\r\ncome to the conclusion that several wild species of Canidæ have been\r\ntamed, and that their blood, in some cases mingled together, flows in\r\nthe veins of our domestic breeds. In regard to sheep and goats I can\r\nform no decided opinion. From facts communicated to me by Mr. Blyth, on\r\nthe habits, voice, constitution and structure of the humped Indian\r\ncattle, it is almost certain that they are descended from a different\r\naboriginal stock from our European cattle; and some competent judges\r\nbelieve that these latter have had two or three wild progenitors,\r\nwhether or not these deserve to be called species. This conclusion, as\r\nwell as that of the specific distinction between the humped and common\r\ncattle, may, indeed, be looked upon as established by the admirable\r\nresearches of Professor Rütimeyer. With respect to horses, from reasons\r\nwhich I cannot here give, I am doubtfully inclined to believe, in\r\nopposition to several authors, that all the races belong to the same\r\nspecies. Having kept nearly all the English breeds of the fowl alive,\r\nhaving bred and crossed them, and examined their skeletons, it appears\r\nto me almost certain that all are the descendants of the wild Indian\r\nfowl, Gallus bankiva; and this is the conclusion of Mr. Blyth, and of\r\nothers who have studied this bird in India. In regard to ducks and\r\nrabbits, some breeds of which differ much from each other, the evidence\r\nis clear that they are all descended from the common duck and wild\r\nrabbit.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several\r\naboriginal stocks, has been carried to an absurd extreme by some\r\nauthors. They believe that every race which breeds true, let the\r\ndistinctive characters be ever so slight, has had its wild prototype.\r\nAt this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of\r\nwild cattle, as many sheep, and several goats, in Europe alone, and\r\nseveral even within Great Britain. One author believes that there\r\nformerly existed eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to Great\r\nBritain! When we bear in mind that Britain has now not one peculiar\r\nmammal, and France but few distinct from those of Germany, and so with\r\nHungary, Spain, &c., but that each of these kingdoms possesses several\r\npeculiar breeds of cattle, sheep, &c., we must admit that many domestic\r\nbreeds must have originated in Europe; for whence otherwise could they\r\nhave been derived? So it is in India. Even in the case of the breeds of\r\nthe domestic dog throughout the world, which I admit are descended from\r\nseveral wild species, it cannot be doubted that there has been an\r\nimmense amount of inherited variation; for who will believe that\r\nanimals closely resembling the Italian greyhound, the bloodhound, the\r\nbull-dog, pug-dog, or Blenheim spaniel, &c.—so unlike all wild\r\nCanidæ—ever existed in a state of nature? It has often been loosely\r\nsaid that all our races of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a\r\nfew aboriginal species; but by crossing we can only get forms in some\r\ndegree intermediate between their parents; and if we account for our\r\nseveral domestic races by this process, we must admit the former\r\nexistence of the most extreme forms, as the Italian greyhound,\r\nbloodhound, bull-dog, &c., in the wild state. Moreover, the possibility\r\nof making distinct races by crossing has been greatly exaggerated. Many\r\ncases are on record showing that a race may be modified by occasional\r\ncrosses if aided by the careful selection of the individuals which\r\npresent the desired character; but to obtain a race intermediate\r\nbetween two quite distinct races would be very difficult. Sir J.\r\nSebright expressly experimented with this object and failed. The\r\noffspring from the first cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and\r\nsometimes (as I have found with pigeons) quite uniform in character,\r\nand every thing seems simple enough; but when these mongrels are\r\ncrossed one with another for several generations, hardly two of them\r\nare alike, and then the difficulty of the task becomes manifest.\r\n\r\n_Breeds of the Domestic Pigeon, their Differences and Origin._\r\n\r\n\r\nBelieving that it is always best to study some special group, I have,\r\nafter deliberation, taken up domestic pigeons. I have kept every breed\r\nwhich I could purchase or obtain, and have been most kindly favoured\r\nwith skins from several quarters of the world, more especially by the\r\nHon. W. Elliot from India, and by the Hon. C. Murray from Persia. Many\r\ntreatises in different languages have been published on pigeons, and\r\nsome of them are very important, as being of considerable antiquity. I\r\nhave associated with several eminent fanciers, and have been permitted\r\nto join two of the London Pigeon Clubs. The diversity of the breeds is\r\nsomething astonishing. Compare the English carrier and the short-faced\r\ntumbler, and see the wonderful difference in their beaks, entailing\r\ncorresponding differences in their skulls. The carrier, more especially\r\nthe male bird, is also remarkable from the wonderful development of the\r\ncarunculated skin about the head, and this is accompanied by greatly\r\nelongated eyelids, very large external orifices to the nostrils, and a\r\nwide gape of mouth. The short-faced tumbler has a beak in outline\r\nalmost like that of a finch; and the common tumbler has the singular\r\ninherited habit of flying at a great height in a compact flock, and\r\ntumbling in the air head over heels. The runt is a bird of great size,\r\nwith long, massive beak and large feet; some of the sub-breeds of runts\r\nhave very long necks, others very long wings and tails, others\r\nsingularly short tails. The barb is allied to the carrier, but, instead\r\nof a long beak, has a very short and broad one. The pouter has a much\r\nelongated body, wings, and legs; and its enormously developed crop,\r\nwhich it glories in inflating, may well excite astonishment and even\r\nlaughter. The turbit has a short and conical beak, with a line of\r\nreversed feathers down the breast; and it has the habit of continually\r\nexpanding, slightly, the upper part of the œsophagus. The Jacobin has\r\nthe feathers so much reversed along the back of the neck that they form\r\na hood, and it has, proportionally to its size, elongated wing and tail\r\nfeathers. The trumpeter and laugher, as their names express, utter a\r\nvery different coo from the other breeds. The fantail has thirty or\r\neven forty tail-feathers, instead of twelve or fourteen, the normal\r\nnumber in all the members of the great pigeon family: these feathers\r\nare kept expanded and are carried so erect that in good birds the head\r\nand tail touch: the oil-gland is quite aborted. Several other less\r\ndistinct breeds might be specified.\r\n\r\nIn the skeletons of the several breeds, the development of the bones of\r\nthe face, in length and breadth and curvature, differs enormously. The\r\nshape, as well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw,\r\nvaries in a highly remarkable manner. The caudal and sacral vertebræ\r\nvary in number; as does the number of the ribs, together with their\r\nrelative breadth and the presence of processes. The size and shape of\r\nthe apertures in the sternum are highly variable; so is the degree of\r\ndivergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula. The\r\nproportional width of the gape of mouth, the proportional length of the\r\neyelids, of the orifice of the nostrils, of the tongue (not always in\r\nstrict correlation with the length of beak), the size of the crop and\r\nof the upper part of the œsophagus; the development and abortion of the\r\noil-gland; the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers; the\r\nrelative length of the wing and tail to each other and to the body; the\r\nrelative length of the leg and foot; the number of scutellæ on the\r\ntoes, the development of skin between the toes, are all points of\r\nstructure which are variable. The period at which the perfect plumage\r\nis acquired varies, as does the state of the down with which the\r\nnestling birds are clothed when hatched. The shape and size of the eggs\r\nvary. The manner of flight, and in some breeds the voice and\r\ndisposition, differ remarkably. Lastly, in certain breeds, the males\r\nand females have come to differ in a slight degree from each other.\r\n\r\nAltogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which, if shown\r\nto an ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would\r\ncertainly be ranked by him as well-defined species. Moreover, I do not\r\nbelieve that any ornithologist would in this case place the English\r\ncarrier, the short-faced tumbler, the runt, the barb, pouter, and\r\nfantail in the same genus; more especially as in each of these breeds\r\nseveral truly-inherited sub-breeds, or species, as he would call them,\r\ncould be shown him.\r\n\r\nGreat as are the differences between the breeds of the pigeon, I am\r\nfully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct,\r\nnamely, that all are descended from the rock-pigeon (Columba livia),\r\nincluding under this term several geographical races or sub-species,\r\nwhich differ from each other in the most trifling respects. As several\r\nof the reasons which have led me to this belief are in some degree\r\napplicable in other cases, I will here briefly give them. If the\r\nseveral breeds are not varieties, and have not proceeded from the\r\nrock-pigeon, they must have descended from at least seven or eight\r\naboriginal stocks; for it is impossible to make the present domestic\r\nbreeds by the crossing of any lesser number: how, for instance, could a\r\npouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the\r\nparent-stocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop? The supposed\r\naboriginal stocks must all have been rock-pigeons, that is, they did\r\nnot breed or willingly perch on trees. But besides C. livia, with its\r\ngeographical sub-species, only two or three other species of\r\nrock-pigeons are known; and these have not any of the characters of the\r\ndomestic breeds. Hence the supposed aboriginal stocks must either still\r\nexist in the countries where they were originally domesticated, and yet\r\nbe unknown to ornithologists; and this, considering their size, habits\r\nand remarkable characters, seems improbable; or they must have become\r\nextinct in the wild state. But birds breeding on precipices, and good\r\nflyers, are unlikely to be exterminated; and the common rock-pigeon,\r\nwhich has the same habits with the domestic breeds, has not been\r\nexterminated even on several of the smaller British islets, or on the\r\nshores of the Mediterranean. Hence the supposed extermination of so\r\nmany species having similar habits with the rock-pigeon seems a very\r\nrash assumption. Moreover, the several above-named domesticated breeds\r\nhave been transported to all parts of the world, and, therefore, some\r\nof them must have been carried back again into their native country;\r\nbut not one has become wild or feral, though the dovecot-pigeon, which\r\nis the rock-pigeon in a very slightly altered state, has become feral\r\nin several places. Again, all recent experience shows that it is\r\ndifficult to get wild animals to breed freely under domestication; yet\r\non the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons, it must be\r\nassumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly\r\ndomesticated in ancient times by half-civilized man, as to be quite\r\nprolific under confinement.\r\n\r\nAn argument of great weight, and applicable in several other cases, is,\r\nthat the above-specified breeds, though agreeing generally with the\r\nwild rock-pigeon in constitution, habits, voice, colouring, and in most\r\nparts of their structure, yet are certainly highly abnormal in other\r\nparts; we may look in vain through the whole great family of Columbidæ\r\nfor a beak like that of the English carrier, or that of the short-faced\r\ntumbler, or barb; for reversed feathers like those of the Jacobin; for\r\na crop like that of the pouter; for tail-feathers like those of the\r\nfantail. Hence it must be assumed, not only that half-civilized man\r\nsucceeded in thoroughly domesticating several species, but that he\r\nintentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species;\r\nand further, that these very species have since all become extinct or\r\nunknown. So many strange contingencies are improbable in the highest\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nSome facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve\r\nconsideration. The rock-pigeon is of a slaty-blue, with white loins;\r\nbut the Indian sub-species, C. intermedia of Strickland, has this part\r\nbluish. The tail has a terminal dark bar, with the outer feathers\r\nexternally edged at the base with white. The wings have two black bars.\r\nSome semi-domestic breeds, and some truly wild breeds, have, besides\r\nthe two black bars, the wings chequered with black. These several marks\r\ndo not occur together in any other species of the whole family. Now, in\r\nevery one of the domestic breeds, taking thoroughly well-bred birds,\r\nall the above marks, even to the white edging of the outer\r\ntail-feathers, sometimes concur perfectly developed. Moreover, when\r\nbirds belonging to two or more distinct breeds are crossed, none of\r\nwhich are blue or have any of the above-specified marks, the mongrel\r\noffspring are very apt suddenly to acquire these characters. To give\r\none instance out of several which I have observed: I crossed some white\r\nfantails, which breed very true, with some black barbs—and it so\r\nhappens that blue varieties of barbs are so rare that I never heard of\r\nan instance in England; and the mongrels were black, brown and mottled.\r\nI also crossed a barb with a spot, which is a white bird with a red\r\ntail and red spot on the forehead, and which notoriously breeds very\r\ntrue; the mongrels were dusky and mottled. I then crossed one of the\r\nmongrel barb-fantails with a mongrel barb-spot, and they produced a\r\nbird of as beautiful a blue colour, with the white loins, double black\r\nwing-bar, and barred and white-edged tail-feathers, as any wild\r\nrock-pigeon! We can understand these facts, on the well-known principle\r\nof reversion to ancestral characters, if all the domestic breeds are\r\ndescended from the rock-pigeon. But if we deny this, we must make one\r\nof the two following highly improbable suppositions. Either, first,\r\nthat all the several imagined aboriginal stocks were coloured and\r\nmarked like the rock-pigeon, although no other existing species is thus\r\ncoloured and marked, so that in each separate breed there might be a\r\ntendency to revert to the very same colours and markings. Or, secondly,\r\nthat each breed, even the purest, has within a dozen, or at most within\r\na score, of generations, been crossed by the rock-pigeon: I say within\r\na dozen or twenty generations, for no instance is known of crossed\r\ndescendants reverting to an ancestor of foreign blood, removed by a\r\ngreater number of generations. In a breed which has been crossed only\r\nonce the tendency to revert to any character derived from such a cross\r\nwill naturally become less and less, as in each succeeding generation\r\nthere will be less of the foreign blood; but when there has been no\r\ncross, and there is a tendency in the breed to revert to a character\r\nwhich was lost during some former generation, this tendency, for all\r\nthat we can see to the contrary, may be transmitted undiminished for an\r\nindefinite number of generations. These two distinct cases of reversion\r\nare often confounded together by those who have written on inheritance.\r\n\r\nLastly, the hybrids or mongrels from between all the breeds of the\r\npigeon are perfectly fertile, as I can state from my own observations,\r\npurposely made, on the most distinct breeds. Now, hardly any cases have\r\nbeen ascertained with certainty of hybrids from two quite distinct\r\nspecies of animals being perfectly fertile. Some authors believe that\r\nlong-continued domestication eliminates this strong tendency to\r\nsterility in species. From the history of the dog, and of some other\r\ndomestic animals, this conclusion is probably quite correct, if applied\r\nto species closely related to each other. But to extend it so far as to\r\nsuppose that species, aboriginally as distinct as carriers, tumblers,\r\npouters, and fantails now are, should yield offspring perfectly\r\nfertile, _inter se_, seems to me rash in the extreme.\r\n\r\nFrom these several reasons, namely, the improbability of man having\r\nformerly made seven or eight supposed species of pigeons to breed\r\nfreely under domestication—these supposed species being quite unknown\r\nin a wild state, and their not having become anywhere feral—these\r\nspecies presenting certain very abnormal characters, as compared with\r\nall other Columbidæ, though so like the rock-pigeon in most other\r\nrespects—the occasional reappearance of the blue colour and various\r\nblack marks in all the breeds, both when kept pure and when crossed—and\r\nlastly, the mongrel offspring being perfectly fertile—from these\r\nseveral reasons, taken together, we may safely conclude that all our\r\ndomestic breeds are descended from the rock-pigeon or Columba livia\r\nwith its geographical sub-species.\r\n\r\nIn favour of this view, I may add, firstly, that the wild C. livia has\r\nbeen found capable of domestication in Europe and in India; and that it\r\nagrees in habits and in a great number of points of structure with all\r\nthe domestic breeds. Secondly, that although an English carrier or a\r\nshort-faced tumbler differs immensely in certain characters from the\r\nrock-pigeon, yet that by comparing the several sub-breeds of these two\r\nraces, more especially those brought from distant countries, we can\r\nmake, between them and the rock-pigeon, an almost perfect series; so we\r\ncan in some other cases, but not with all the breeds. Thirdly, those\r\ncharacters which are mainly distinctive of each breed are in each\r\neminently variable, for instance, the wattle and length of beak of the\r\ncarrier, the shortness of that of the tumbler, and the number of\r\ntail-feathers in the fantail; and the explanation of this fact will be\r\nobvious when we treat of selection. Fourthly, pigeons have been watched\r\nand tended with the utmost care, and loved by many people. They have\r\nbeen domesticated for thousands of years in several quarters of the\r\nworld; the earliest known record of pigeons is in the fifth Ægyptian\r\ndynasty, about 3000 B.C., as was pointed out to me by Professor\r\nLepsius; but Mr. Birch informs me that pigeons are given in a bill of\r\nfare in the previous dynasty. In the time of the Romans, as we hear\r\nfrom Pliny, immense prices were given for pigeons; “nay, they are come\r\nto this pass, that they can reckon up their pedigree and race.” Pigeons\r\nwere much valued by Akber Khan in India, about the year 1600; never\r\nless than 20,000 pigeons were taken with the court. “The monarchs of\r\nIran and Turan sent him some very rare birds;” and, continues the\r\ncourtly historian, “His Majesty, by crossing the breeds, which method\r\nwas never practised before, has improved them astonishingly.” About\r\nthis same period the Dutch were as eager about pigeons as were the old\r\nRomans. The paramount importance of these considerations in explaining\r\nthe immense amount of variation which pigeons have undergone, will\r\nlikewise be obvious when we treat of Selection. We shall then, also,\r\nsee how it is that the several breeds so often have a somewhat\r\nmonstrous character. It is also a most favourable circumstance for the\r\nproduction of distinct breeds, that male and female pigeons can be\r\neasily mated for life; and thus different breeds can be kept together\r\nin the same aviary.\r\n\r\nI have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some, yet\r\nquite insufficient, length; because when I first kept pigeons and\r\nwatched the several kinds, well knowing how truly they breed, I felt\r\nfully as much difficulty in believing that since they had been\r\ndomesticated they had all proceeded from a common parent, as any\r\nnaturalist could in coming to a similar conclusion in regard to the\r\nmany species of finches, or other groups of birds, in nature. One\r\ncircumstance has struck me much; namely, that nearly all the breeders\r\nof the various domestic animals and the cultivators of plants, with\r\nwhom I have conversed, or whose treatises I have read, are firmly\r\nconvinced that the several breeds to which each has attended, are\r\ndescended from so many aboriginally distinct species. Ask, as I have\r\nasked, a celebrated raiser of Hereford cattle, whether his cattle might\r\nnot have descended from Long-horns, or both from a common parent-stock,\r\nand he will laugh you to scorn. I have never met a pigeon, or poultry,\r\nor duck, or rabbit fancier, who was not fully convinced that each main\r\nbreed was descended from a distinct species. Van Mons, in his treatise\r\non pears and apples, shows how utterly he disbelieves that the several\r\nsorts, for instance a Ribston-pippin or Codlin-apple, could ever have\r\nproceeded from the seeds of the same tree. Innumerable other examples\r\ncould be given. The explanation, I think, is simple: from\r\nlong-continued study they are strongly impressed with the differences\r\nbetween the several races; and though they well know that each race\r\nvaries slightly, for they win their prizes by selecting such slight\r\ndifferences, yet they ignore all general arguments, and refuse to sum\r\nup in their minds slight differences accumulated during many successive\r\ngenerations. May not those naturalists who, knowing far less of the\r\nlaws of inheritance than does the breeder, and knowing no more than he\r\ndoes of the intermediate links in the long lines of descent, yet admit\r\nthat many of our domestic races are descended from the same parents—may\r\nthey not learn a lesson of caution, when they deride the idea of\r\nspecies in a state of nature being lineal descendants of other species?\r\n\r\n_Principles of Selection anciently followed, and their Effects._\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races have been\r\nproduced, either from one or from several allied species. Some effect\r\nmay be attributed to the direct and definite action of the external\r\nconditions of life, and some to habit; but he would be a bold man who\r\nwould account by such agencies for the differences between a dray and\r\nrace-horse, a greyhound and bloodhound, a carrier and tumbler pigeon.\r\nOne of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races is that\r\nwe see in them adaptation, not indeed to the animal’s or plant’s own\r\ngood, but to man’s use or fancy. Some variations useful to him have\r\nprobably arisen suddenly, or by one step; many botanists, for instance,\r\nbelieve that the fuller’s teasel, with its hooks, which can not be\r\nrivalled by any mechanical contrivance, is only a variety of the wild\r\nDipsacus; and this amount of change may have suddenly arisen in a\r\nseedling. So it has probably been with the turnspit dog; and this is\r\nknown to have been the case with the ancon sheep. But when we compare\r\nthe dray-horse and race-horse, the dromedary and camel, the various\r\nbreeds of sheep fitted either for cultivated land or mountain pasture,\r\nwith the wool of one breed good for one purpose, and that of another\r\nbreed for another purpose; when we compare the many breeds of dogs,\r\neach good for man in different ways; when we compare the game-cock, so\r\npertinacious in battle, with other breeds so little quarrelsome, with\r\n“everlasting layers” which never desire to sit, and with the bantam so\r\nsmall and elegant; when we compare the host of agricultural, culinary,\r\norchard, and flower-garden races of plants, most useful to man at\r\ndifferent seasons and for different purposes, or so beautiful in his\r\neyes, we must, I think, look further than to mere variability. We can\r\nnot suppose that all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and\r\nas useful as we now see them; indeed, in many cases, we know that this\r\nhas not been their history. The key is man’s power of accumulative\r\nselection: nature gives successive variations; man adds them up in\r\ncertain directions useful to him. In this sense he may be said to have\r\nmade for himself useful breeds.\r\n\r\nThe great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical. It\r\nis certain that several of our eminent breeders have, even within a\r\nsingle lifetime, modified to a large extent their breeds of cattle and\r\nsheep. In order fully to realise what they have done it is almost\r\nnecessary to read several of the many treatises devoted to this\r\nsubject, and to inspect the animals. Breeders habitually speak of an\r\nanimal’s organisation as something plastic, which they can model almost\r\nas they please. If I had space I could quote numerous passages to this\r\neffect from highly competent authorities. Youatt, who was probably\r\nbetter acquainted with the works of agriculturalists than almost any\r\nother individual, and who was himself a very good judge of animals,\r\nspeaks of the principle of selection as “that which enables the\r\nagriculturist, not only to modify the character of his flock, but to\r\nchange it altogether. It is the magician’s wand, by means of which he\r\nmay summon into life whatever form and mould he pleases.” Lord\r\nSomerville, speaking of what breeders have done for sheep, says: “It\r\nwould seem as if they had chalked out upon a wall a form perfect in\r\nitself, and then had given it existence.” In Saxony the importance of\r\nthe principle of selection in regard to merino sheep is so fully\r\nrecognised, that men follow it as a trade: the sheep are placed on a\r\ntable and are studied, like a picture by a connoisseur; this is done\r\nthree times at intervals of months, and the sheep are each time marked\r\nand classed, so that the very best may ultimately be selected for\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\nWhat English breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous\r\nprices given for animals with a good pedigree; and these have been\r\nexported to almost every quarter of the world. The improvement is by no\r\nmeans generally due to crossing different breeds; all the best breeders\r\nare strongly opposed to this practice, except sometimes among closely\r\nallied sub-breeds. And when a cross has been made, the closest\r\nselection is far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases. If\r\nselection consisted merely in separating some very distinct variety and\r\nbreeding from it, the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be\r\nworth notice; but its importance consists in the great effect produced\r\nby the accumulation in one direction, during successive generations, of\r\ndifferences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eye—differences\r\nwhich I for one have vainly attempted to appreciate. Not one man in a\r\nthousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an\r\neminent breeder. If gifted with these qualities, and he studies his\r\nsubject for years, and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable\r\nperseverance, he will succeed, and may make great improvements; if he\r\nwants any of these qualities, he will assuredly fail. Few would readily\r\nbelieve in the natural capacity and years of practice requisite to\r\nbecome even a skilful pigeon-fancier.\r\n\r\nThe same principles are followed by horticulturists; but the variations\r\nare here often more abrupt. No one supposes that our choicest\r\nproductions have been produced by a single variation from the\r\naboriginal stock. We have proofs that this is not so in several cases\r\nin which exact records have been kept; thus, to give a very trifling\r\ninstance, the steadily-increasing size of the common gooseberry may be\r\nquoted. We see an astonishing improvement in many florists’ flowers,\r\nwhen the flowers of the present day are compared with drawings made\r\nonly twenty or thirty years ago. When a race of plants is once pretty\r\nwell established, the seed-raisers do not pick out the best plants, but\r\nmerely go over their seed-beds, and pull up the “rogues,” as they call\r\nthe plants that deviate from the proper standard. With animals this\r\nkind of selection is, in fact, likewise followed; for hardly any one is\r\nso careless as to breed from his worst animals.\r\n\r\nIn regard to plants, there is another means of observing the\r\naccumulated effects of selection—namely, by comparing the diversity of\r\nflowers in the different varieties of the same species in the\r\nflower-garden; the diversity of leaves, pods, or tubers, or whatever\r\npart is valued, in the kitchen-garden, in comparison with the flowers\r\nof the same varieties; and the diversity of fruit of the same species\r\nin the orchard, in comparison with the leaves and flowers of the same\r\nset of varieties. See how different the leaves of the cabbage are, and\r\nhow extremely alike the flowers; how unlike the flowers of the\r\nheartsease are, and how alike the leaves; how much the fruit of the\r\ndifferent kinds of gooseberries differ in size, colour, shape, and\r\nhairiness, and yet the flowers present very slight differences. It is\r\nnot that the varieties which differ largely in some one point do not\r\ndiffer at all in other points; this is hardly ever—I speak after\r\ncareful observation—perhaps never, the case. The law of correlated\r\nvariation, the importance of which should never be overlooked, will\r\nensure some differences; but, as a general rule, it cannot be doubted\r\nthat the continued selection of slight variations, either in the\r\nleaves, the flowers, or the fruit, will produce races differing from\r\neach other chiefly in these characters.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced to\r\nmethodical practice for scarcely more than three-quarters of a century;\r\nit has certainly been more attended to of late years, and many\r\ntreatises have been published on the subject; and the result has been,\r\nin a corresponding degree, rapid and important. But it is very far from\r\ntrue that the principle is a modern discovery. I could give several\r\nreferences to works of high antiquity, in which the full importance of\r\nthe principle is acknowledged. In rude and barbarous periods of English\r\nhistory choice animals were often imported, and laws were passed to\r\nprevent their exportation: the destruction of horses under a certain\r\nsize was ordered, and this may be compared to the “roguing” of plants\r\nby nurserymen. The principle of selection I find distinctly given in an\r\nancient Chinese encyclopædia. Explicit rules are laid down by some of\r\nthe Roman classical writers. From passages in Genesis, it is clear that\r\nthe colour of domestic animals was at that early period attended to.\r\nSavages now sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals, to\r\nimprove the breed, and they formerly did so, as is attested by passages\r\nin Pliny. The savages in South Africa match their draught cattle by\r\ncolour, as do some of the Esquimaux their teams of dogs. Livingstone\r\nstates that good domestic breeds are highly valued by the negroes in\r\nthe interior of Africa who have not associated with Europeans. Some of\r\nthese facts do not show actual selection, but they show that the\r\nbreeding of domestic animals was carefully attended to in ancient\r\ntimes, and is now attended to by the lowest savages. It would, indeed,\r\nhave been a strange fact, had attention not been paid to breeding, for\r\nthe inheritance of good and bad qualities is so obvious.\r\n\r\n_Unconscious Selection._\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the present time, eminent breeders try by methodical selection, with\r\na distinct object in view, to make a new strain or sub-breed, superior\r\nto anything of the kind in the country. But, for our purpose, a form of\r\nselection, which may be called unconscious, and which results from\r\nevery one trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals,\r\nis more important. Thus, a man who intends keeping pointers naturally\r\ntries to get as good dogs as he can, and afterwards breeds from his own\r\nbest dogs, but he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering\r\nthe breed. Nevertheless we may infer that this process, continued\r\nduring centuries, would improve and modify any breed, in the same way\r\nas Bakewell, Collins, &c., by this very same process, only carried on\r\nmore methodically, did greatly modify, even during their lifetimes, the\r\nforms and qualities of their cattle. Slow and insensible changes of\r\nthis kind could never be recognised unless actual measurements or\r\ncareful drawings of the breeds in question have been made long ago,\r\nwhich may serve for comparison. In some cases, however, unchanged, or\r\nbut little changed, individuals of the same breed exist in less\r\ncivilised districts, where the breed has been less improved. There is\r\nreason to believe that King Charles’ spaniel has been unconsciously\r\nmodified to a large extent since the time of that monarch. Some highly\r\ncompetent authorities are convinced that the setter is directly derived\r\nfrom the spaniel, and has probably been slowly altered from it. It is\r\nknown that the English pointer has been greatly changed within the last\r\ncentury, and in this case the change has, it is believed, been chiefly\r\neffected by crosses with the foxhound; but what concerns us is, that\r\nthe change has been effected unconsciously and gradually, and yet so\r\neffectually that, though the old Spanish pointer certainly came from\r\nSpain, Mr. Borrow has not seen, as I am informed by him, any native dog\r\nin Spain like our pointer.\r\n\r\nBy a similar process of selection, and by careful training, English\r\nrace-horses have come to surpass in fleetness and size the parent\r\nArabs, so that the latter, by the regulations for the Goodwood Races,\r\nare favoured in the weights which they carry. Lord Spencer and others\r\nhave shown how the cattle of England have increased in weight and in\r\nearly maturity, compared with the stock formerly kept in this country.\r\nBy comparing the accounts given in various old treatises of the former\r\nand present state of carrier and tumbler pigeons in Britain, India, and\r\nPersia, we can trace the stages through which they have insensibly\r\npassed, and come to differ so greatly from the rock-pigeon.\r\n\r\nYouatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a course of\r\nselection which may be considered as unconscious, in so far that the\r\nbreeders could never have expected, or even wished, to produce the\r\nresult which ensued—namely, the production of the distinct strains. The\r\ntwo flocks of Leicester sheep kept by Mr. Buckley and Mr. Burgess, as\r\nMr. Youatt remarks, “Have been purely bred from the original stock of\r\nMr. Bakewell for upwards of fifty years. There is not a suspicion\r\nexisting in the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that\r\nthe owner of either of them has deviated in any one instance from the\r\npure blood of Mr. Bakewell’s flock, and yet the difference between the\r\nsheep possessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the\r\nappearance of being quite different varieties.”\r\n\r\nIf there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited\r\ncharacter of the offspring of their domestic animals, yet any one\r\nanimal particularly useful to them, for any special purpose, would be\r\ncarefully preserved during famines and other accidents, to which\r\nsavages are so liable, and such choice animals would thus generally\r\nleave more offspring than the inferior ones; so that in this case there\r\nwould be a kind of unconscious selection going on. We see the value set\r\non animals even by the barbarians of Tierra del Fuego, by their killing\r\nand devouring their old women, in times of dearth, as of less value\r\nthan their dogs.\r\n\r\nIn plants the same gradual process of improvement through the\r\noccasional preservation of the best individuals, whether or not\r\nsufficiently distinct to be ranked at their first appearance as\r\ndistinct varieties, and whether or not two or more species or races\r\nhave become blended together by crossing, may plainly be recognised in\r\nthe increased size and beauty which we now see in the varieties of the\r\nheartsease, rose, pelargonium, dahlia, and other plants, when compared\r\nwith the older varieties or with their parent-stocks. No one would ever\r\nexpect to get a first-rate heartsease or dahlia from the seed of a wild\r\nplant. No one would expect to raise a first-rate melting pear from the\r\nseed of a wild pear, though he might succeed from a poor seedling\r\ngrowing wild, if it had come from a garden-stock. The pear, though\r\ncultivated in classical times, appears, from Pliny’s description, to\r\nhave been a fruit of very inferior quality. I have seen great surprise\r\nexpressed in horticultural works at the wonderful skill of gardeners in\r\nhaving produced such splendid results from such poor materials; but the\r\nart has been simple, and, as far as the final result is concerned, has\r\nbeen followed almost unconsciously. It has consisted in always\r\ncultivating the best known variety, sowing its seeds, and, when a\r\nslightly better variety chanced to appear, selecting it, and so\r\nonwards. But the gardeners of the classical period, who cultivated the\r\nbest pears which they could procure, never thought what splendid fruit\r\nwe should eat; though we owe our excellent fruit in some small degree\r\nto their having naturally chosen and preserved the best varieties they\r\ncould anywhere find.\r\n\r\nA large amount of change, thus slowly and unconsciously accumulated,\r\nexplains, as I believe, the well-known fact, that in a number of cases\r\nwe cannot recognise, and therefore do not know, the wild parent-stocks\r\nof the plants which have been longest cultivated in our flower and\r\nkitchen gardens. If it has taken centuries or thousands of years to\r\nimprove or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of\r\nusefulness to man, we can understand how it is that neither Australia,\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite\r\nuncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture. It is\r\nnot that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange\r\nchance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the\r\nnative plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a\r\nstandard of perfection comparable with that acquired by the plants in\r\ncountries anciently civilised.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man, it should\r\nnot be overlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their\r\nown food, at least during certain seasons. And in two countries very\r\ndifferently circumstanced, individuals of the same species, having\r\nslightly different constitutions or structure, would often succeed\r\nbetter in the one country than in the other, and thus by a process of\r\n“natural selection,” as will hereafter be more fully explained, two\r\nsub-breeds might be formed. This, perhaps, partly explains why the\r\nvarieties kept by savages, as has been remarked by some authors, have\r\nmore of the character of true species than the varieties kept in\r\ncivilised countries.\r\n\r\nOn the view here given of the important part which selection by man has\r\nplayed, it becomes at once obvious, how it is that our domestic races\r\nshow adaptation in their structure or in their habits to man’s wants or\r\nfancies. We can, I think, further understand the frequently abnormal\r\ncharacter of our domestic races, and likewise their differences being\r\nso great in external characters, and relatively so slight in internal\r\nparts or organs. Man can hardly select, or only with much difficulty,\r\nany deviation of structure excepting such as is externally visible; and\r\nindeed he rarely cares for what is internal. He can never act by\r\nselection, excepting on variations which are first given to him in some\r\nslight degree by nature. No man would ever try to make a fantail till\r\nhe saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight degree in an\r\nunusual manner, or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a crop of\r\nsomewhat unusual size; and the more abnormal or unusual any character\r\nwas when it first appeared, the more likely it would be to catch his\r\nattention. But to use such an expression as trying to make a fantail\r\nis, I have no doubt, in most cases, utterly incorrect. The man who\r\nfirst selected a pigeon with a slightly larger tail, never dreamed what\r\nthe descendants of that pigeon would become through long-continued,\r\npartly unconscious and partly methodical, selection. Perhaps the parent\r\nbird of all fantails had only fourteen tail-feathers somewhat expanded,\r\nlike the present Java fantail, or like individuals of other and\r\ndistinct breeds, in which as many as seventeen tail-feathers have been\r\ncounted. Perhaps the first pouter-pigeon did not inflate its crop much\r\nmore than the turbit now does the upper part of its œsophagus—a habit\r\nwhich is disregarded by all fanciers, as it is not one of the points of\r\nthe breed.\r\n\r\nNor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would be\r\nnecessary to catch the fancier’s eye: he perceives extremely small\r\ndifferences, and it is in human nature to value any novelty, however\r\nslight, in one’s own possession. Nor must the value which would\r\nformerly have been set on any slight differences in the individuals of\r\nthe same species, be judged of by the value which is now set on them,\r\nafter several breeds have fairly been established. It is known that\r\nwith pigeons many slight variations now occasionally appear, but these\r\nare rejected as faults or deviations from the standard of perfection in\r\neach breed. The common goose has not given rise to any marked\r\nvarieties; hence the Toulouse and the common breed, which differ only\r\nin colour, that most fleeting of characters, have lately been exhibited\r\nas distinct at our poultry-shows.\r\n\r\nThese views appear to explain what has sometimes been noticed, namely,\r\nthat we know hardly anything about the origin or history of any of our\r\ndomestic breeds. But, in fact, a breed, like a dialect of a language,\r\ncan hardly be said to have a distinct origin. A man preserves and\r\nbreeds from an individual with some slight deviation of structure, or\r\ntakes more care than usual in matching his best animals, and thus\r\nimproves them, and the improved animals slowly spread in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood. But they will as yet hardly have a distinct name, and\r\nfrom being only slightly valued, their history will have been\r\ndisregarded. When further improved by the same slow and gradual\r\nprocess, they will spread more widely, and will be recognised as\r\nsomething distinct and valuable, and will then probably first receive a\r\nprovincial name. In semi-civilised countries, with little free\r\ncommunication, the spreading of a new sub-breed will be a slow process.\r\nAs soon as the points of value are once acknowledged, the principle, as\r\nI have called it, of unconscious selection will always tend—perhaps\r\nmore at one period than at another, as the breed rises or falls in\r\nfashion—perhaps more in one district than in another, according to the\r\nstate of civilisation of the inhabitants—slowly to add to the\r\ncharacteristic features of the breed, whatever they may be. But the\r\nchance will be infinitely small of any record having been preserved of\r\nsuch slow, varying, and insensible changes.\r\n\r\n_Circumstances favourable to Man’s Power of Selection._\r\n\r\n\r\nI will now say a few words on the circumstances, favourable or the\r\nreverse, to man’s power of selection. A high degree of variability is\r\nobviously favourable, as freely giving the materials for selection to\r\nwork on; not that mere individual differences are not amply sufficient,\r\nwith extreme care, to allow of the accumulation of a large amount of\r\nmodification in almost any desired direction. But as variations\r\nmanifestly useful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally, the\r\nchance of their appearance will be much increased by a large number of\r\nindividuals being kept. Hence number is of the highest importance for\r\nsuccess. On this principle Marshall formerly remarked, with respect to\r\nthe sheep of part of Yorkshire, “As they generally belong to poor\r\npeople, and are mostly _in small lots_, they never can be improved.” On\r\nthe other hand, nurserymen, from keeping large stocks of the same\r\nplant, are generally far more successful than amateurs in raising new\r\nand valuable varieties. A large number of individuals of an animal or\r\nplant can be reared only where the conditions for its propagation are\r\nfavourable. When the individuals are scanty all will be allowed to\r\nbreed, whatever their quality may be, and this will effectually prevent\r\nselection. But probably the most important element is that the animal\r\nor plant should be so highly valued by man, that the closest attention\r\nis paid to even the slightest deviations in its qualities or structure.\r\nUnless such attention be paid nothing can be effected. I have seen it\r\ngravely remarked, that it was most fortunate that the strawberry began\r\nto vary just when gardeners began to attend to this plant. No doubt the\r\nstrawberry had always varied since it was cultivated, but the slight\r\nvarieties had been neglected. As soon, however, as gardeners picked out\r\nindividual plants with slightly larger, earlier, or better fruit, and\r\nraised seedlings from them, and again picked out the best seedlings and\r\nbred from them, then (with some aid by crossing distinct species) those\r\nmany admirable varieties of the strawberry were raised which have\r\nappeared during the last half-century.\r\n\r\nWith animals, facility in preventing crosses is an important element in\r\nthe formation of new races—at least, in a country which is already\r\nstocked with other races. In this respect enclosure of the land plays a\r\npart. Wandering savages or the inhabitants of open plains rarely\r\npossess more than one breed of the same species. Pigeons can be mated\r\nfor life, and this is a great convenience to the fancier, for thus many\r\nraces may be improved and kept true, though mingled in the same aviary;\r\nand this circumstance must have largely favoured the formation of new\r\nbreeds. Pigeons, I may add, can be propagated in great numbers and at a\r\nvery quick rate, and inferior birds may be freely rejected, as when\r\nkilled they serve for food. On the other hand, cats, from their\r\nnocturnal rambling habits, can not be easily matched, and, although so\r\nmuch valued by women and children, we rarely see a distinct breed long\r\nkept up; such breeds as we do sometimes see are almost always imported\r\nfrom some other country. Although I do not doubt that some domestic\r\nanimals vary less than others, yet the rarity or absence of distinct\r\nbreeds of the cat, the donkey, peacock, goose, &c., may be attributed\r\nin main part to selection not having been brought into play: in cats,\r\nfrom the difficulty in pairing them; in donkeys, from only a few being\r\nkept by poor people, and little attention paid to their breeding; for\r\nrecently in certain parts of Spain and of the United States this animal\r\nhas been surprisingly modified and improved by careful selection; in\r\npeacocks, from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept;\r\nin geese, from being valuable only for two purposes, food and feathers,\r\nand more especially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of\r\ndistinct breeds; but the goose, under the conditions to which it is\r\nexposed when domesticated, seems to have a singularly inflexible\r\norganisation, though it has varied to a slight extent, as I have\r\nelsewhere described.\r\n\r\nSome authors have maintained that the amount of variation in our\r\ndomestic productions is soon reached, and can never afterward be\r\nexceeded. It would be somewhat rash to assert that the limit has been\r\nattained in any one case; for almost all our animals and plants have\r\nbeen greatly improved in many ways within a recent period; and this\r\nimplies variation. It would be equally rash to assert that characters\r\nnow increased to their utmost limit, could not, after remaining fixed\r\nfor many centuries, again vary under new conditions of life. No doubt,\r\nas Mr. Wallace has remarked with much truth, a limit will be at last\r\nreached. For instance, there must be a limit to the fleetness of any\r\nterrestrial animal, as this will be determined by the friction to be\r\novercome, the weight of the body to be carried, and the power of\r\ncontraction in the muscular fibres. But what concerns us is that the\r\ndomestic varieties of the same species differ from each other in almost\r\nevery character, which man has attended to and selected, more than do\r\nthe distinct species of the same genera. Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire\r\nhas proved this in regard to size, and so it is with colour, and\r\nprobably with the length of hair. With respect to fleetness, which\r\ndepends on many bodily characters, Eclipse was far fleeter, and a\r\ndray-horse is comparably stronger, than any two natural species\r\nbelonging to the same genus. So with plants, the seeds of the different\r\nvarieties of the bean or maize probably differ more in size than do the\r\nseeds of the distinct species in any one genus in the same two\r\nfamilies. The same remark holds good in regard to the fruit of the\r\nseveral varieties of the plum, and still more strongly with the melon,\r\nas well as in many other analogous cases.\r\n\r\nTo sum up on the origin of our domestic races of animals and plants.\r\nChanged conditions of life are of the highest importance in causing\r\nvariability, both by acting directly on the organisation, and\r\nindirectly by affecting the reproductive system. It is not probable\r\nthat variability is an inherent and necessary contingent, under all\r\ncircumstances. The greater or less force of inheritance and reversion\r\ndetermine whether variations shall endure. Variability is governed by\r\nmany unknown laws, of which correlated growth is probably the most\r\nimportant. Something, but how much we do not know, may be attributed to\r\nthe definite action of the conditions of life. Some, perhaps a great,\r\neffect may be attributed to the increased use or disuse of parts. The\r\nfinal result is thus rendered infinitely complex. In some cases the\r\nintercrossing of aboriginally distinct species appears to have played\r\nan important part in the origin of our breeds. When several breeds have\r\nonce been formed in any country, their occasional intercrossing, with\r\nthe aid of selection, has, no doubt, largely aided in the formation of\r\nnew sub-breeds; but the importance of crossing has been much\r\nexaggerated, both in regard to animals and to those plants which are\r\npropagated by seed. With plants which are temporarily propagated by\r\ncuttings, buds, &c., the importance of crossing is immense; for the\r\ncultivator may here disregard the extreme variability both of hybrids\r\nand of mongrels, and the sterility of hybrids; but plants not\r\npropagated by seed are of little importance to us, for their endurance\r\nis only temporary. Over all these causes of change, the accumulative\r\naction of selection, whether applied methodically and quickly, or\r\nunconsciously and slowly, but more efficiently, seems to have been the\r\npredominant power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nVARIATION UNDER NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nVariability—Individual differences—Doubtful species—Wide ranging, much\r\ndiffused, and common species, vary most—Species of the larger genera in\r\neach country vary more frequently than the species of the smaller\r\ngenera—Many of the species of the larger genera resemble varieties in\r\nbeing very closely, but unequally, related to each other, and in having\r\nrestricted ranges.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore applying the principles arrived at in the last chapter to\r\norganic beings in a state of nature, we must briefly discuss whether\r\nthese latter are subject to any variation. To treat this subject\r\nproperly, a long catalogue of dry facts ought to be given; but these I\r\nshall reserve for a future work. Nor shall I here discuss the various\r\ndefinitions which have been given of the term species. No one\r\ndefinition has satisfied all naturalists; yet every naturalist knows\r\nvaguely what he means when he speaks of a species. Generally the term\r\nincludes the unknown element of a distinct act of creation. The term\r\n“variety” is almost equally difficult to define; but here community of\r\ndescent is almost universally implied, though it can rarely be proved.\r\nWe have also what are called monstrosities; but they graduate into\r\nvarieties. By a monstrosity I presume is meant some considerable\r\ndeviation of structure, generally injurious, or not useful to the\r\nspecies. Some authors use the term “variation” in a technical sense, as\r\nimplying a modification directly due to the physical conditions of\r\nlife; and “variations” in this sense are supposed not to be inherited;\r\nbut who can say that the dwarfed condition of shells in the brackish\r\nwaters of the Baltic, or dwarfed plants on Alpine summits, or the\r\nthicker fur of an animal from far northwards, would not in some cases\r\nbe inherited for at least a few generations? And in this case I presume\r\nthat the form would be called a variety.\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted whether sudden and considerable deviations of\r\nstructure, such as we occasionally see in our domestic productions,\r\nmore especially with plants, are ever permanently propagated in a state\r\nof nature. Almost every part of every organic being is so beautifully\r\nrelated to its complex conditions of life that it seems as improbable\r\nthat any part should have been suddenly produced perfect, as that a\r\ncomplex machine should have been invented by man in a perfect state.\r\nUnder domestication monstrosities sometimes occur which resemble normal\r\nstructures in widely different animals. Thus pigs have occasionally\r\nbeen born with a sort of proboscis, and if any wild species of the same\r\ngenus had naturally possessed a proboscis, it might have been argued\r\nthat this had appeared as a monstrosity; but I have as yet failed to\r\nfind, after diligent search, cases of monstrosities resembling normal\r\nstructures in nearly allied forms, and these alone bear on the\r\nquestion. If monstrous forms of this kind ever do appear in a state of\r\nnature and are capable of reproduction (which is not always the case),\r\nas they occur rarely and singly, their preservation would depend on\r\nunusually favourable circumstances. They would, also, during the first\r\nand succeeding generations cross with the ordinary form, and thus their\r\nabnormal character would almost inevitably be lost. But I shall have to\r\nreturn in a future chapter to the preservation and perpetuation of\r\nsingle or occasional variations.\r\n\r\n_Individual Differences._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe many slight differences which appear in the offspring from the same\r\nparents, or which it may be presumed have thus arisen, from being\r\nobserved in the individuals of the same species inhabiting the same\r\nconfined locality, may be called individual differences. No one\r\nsupposes that all the individuals of the same species are cast in the\r\nsame actual mould. These individual differences are of the highest\r\nimportance for us, for they are often inherited, as must be familiar to\r\nevery one; and they thus afford materials for natural selection to act\r\non and accumulate, in the same manner as man accumulates in any given\r\ndirection individual differences in his domesticated productions. These\r\nindividual differences generally affect what naturalists consider\r\nunimportant parts; but I could show, by a long catalogue of facts, that\r\nparts which must be called important, whether viewed under a\r\nphysiological or classificatory point of view, sometimes vary in the\r\nindividuals of the same species. I am convinced that the most\r\nexperienced naturalist would be surprised at the number of the cases of\r\nvariability, even in important parts of structure, which he could\r\ncollect on good authority, as I have collected, during a course of\r\nyears. It should be remembered that systematists are far from being\r\npleased at finding variability in important characters, and that there\r\nare not many men who will laboriously examine internal and important\r\norgans, and compare them in many specimens of the same species. It\r\nwould never have been expected that the branching of the main nerves\r\nclose to the great central ganglion of an insect would have been\r\nvariable in the same species; it might have been thought that changes\r\nof this nature could have been effected only by slow degrees; yet Sir\r\nJ. Lubbock has shown a degree of variability in these main nerves in\r\nCoccus, which may almost be compared to the irregular branching of the\r\nstem of a tree. This philosophical naturalist, I may add, has also\r\nshown that the muscles in the larvæ of certain insects are far from\r\nuniform. Authors sometimes argue in a circle when they state that\r\nimportant organs never vary; for these same authors practically rank\r\nthose parts as important (as some few naturalists have honestly\r\nconfessed) which do not vary; and, under this point of view, no\r\ninstance will ever be found of an important part varying; but under any\r\nother point of view many instances assuredly can be given.\r\n\r\nThere is one point connected with individual differences which is\r\nextremely perplexing: I refer to those genera which have been called\r\n“protean” or “polymorphic,” in which species present an inordinate\r\namount of variation. With respect to many of these forms, hardly two\r\nnaturalists agree whether to rank them as species or as varieties. We\r\nmay instance Rubus, Rosa, and Hieracium among plants, several genera of\r\ninsects, and of Brachiopod shells. In most polymorphic genera some of\r\nthe species have fixed and definite characters. Genera which are\r\npolymorphic in one country seem to be, with a few exceptions,\r\npolymorphic in other countries, and likewise, judging from Brachiopod\r\nshells, at former periods of time. These facts are very perplexing, for\r\nthey seem to show that this kind of variability is independent of the\r\nconditions of life. I am inclined to suspect that we see, at least in\r\nsome of these polymorphic genera, variations which are of no service or\r\ndisservice to the species, and which consequently have not been seized\r\non and rendered definite by natural selection, as hereafter to be\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nIndividuals of the same species often present, as is known to every\r\none, great differences of structure, independently of variation, as in\r\nthe two sexes of various animals, in the two or three castes of sterile\r\nfemales or workers among insects, and in the immature and larval states\r\nof many of the lower animals. There are, also, cases of dimorphism and\r\ntrimorphism, both with animals and plants. Thus, Mr. Wallace, who has\r\nlately called attention to the subject, has shown that the females of\r\ncertain species of butterflies, in the Malayan Archipelago, regularly\r\nappear under two or even three conspicuously distinct forms, not\r\nconnected by intermediate varieties. Fritz Müller has described\r\nanalogous but more extraordinary cases with the males of certain\r\nBrazilian Crustaceans: thus, the male of a Tanais regularly occurs\r\nunder two distinct forms; one of these has strong and differently\r\nshaped pincers, and the other has antennæ much more abundantly\r\nfurnished with smelling-hairs. Although in most of these cases, the two\r\nor three forms, both with animals and plants, are not now connected by\r\nintermediate gradations, it is possible that they were once thus\r\nconnected. Mr. Wallace, for instance, describes a certain butterfly\r\nwhich presents in the same island a great range of varieties connected\r\nby intermediate links, and the extreme links of the chain closely\r\nresemble the two forms of an allied dimorphic species inhabiting\r\nanother part of the Malay Archipelago. Thus also with ants, the several\r\nworker-castes are generally quite distinct; but in some cases, as we\r\nshall hereafter see, the castes are connected together by finely\r\ngraduated varieties. So it is, as I have myself observed, with some\r\ndimorphic plants. It certainly at first appears a highly remarkable\r\nfact that the same female butterfly should have the power of producing\r\nat the same time three distinct female forms and a male; and that an\r\nhermaphrodite plant should produce from the same seed-capsule three\r\ndistinct hermaphrodite forms, bearing three different kinds of females\r\nand three or even six different kinds of males. Nevertheless these\r\ncases are only exaggerations of the common fact that the female\r\nproduces offspring of two sexes which sometimes differ from each other\r\nin a wonderful manner.\r\n\r\n_Doubtful Species._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe forms which possess in some considerable degree the character of\r\nspecies, but which are so closely similar to other forms, or are so\r\nclosely linked to them by intermediate gradations, that naturalists do\r\nnot like to rank them as distinct species, are in several respects the\r\nmost important for us. We have every reason to believe that many of\r\nthese doubtful and closely allied forms have permanently retained their\r\ncharacters for a long time; for as long, as far as we know, as have\r\ngood and true species. Practically, when a naturalist can unite by\r\nmeans of intermediate links any two forms, he treats the one as a\r\nvariety of the other, ranking the most common, but sometimes the one\r\nfirst described as the species, and the other as the variety. But cases\r\nof great difficulty, which I will not here enumerate, sometimes arise\r\nin deciding whether or not to rank one form as a variety of another,\r\neven when they are closely connected by intermediate links; nor will\r\nthe commonly assumed hybrid nature of the intermediate forms always\r\nremove the difficulty. In very many cases, however, one form is ranked\r\nas a variety of another, not because the intermediate links have\r\nactually been found, but because analogy leads the observer to suppose\r\neither that they do now somewhere exist, or may formerly have existed;\r\nand here a wide door for the entry of doubt and conjecture is opened.\r\n\r\nHence, in determining whether a form should be ranked as a species or a\r\nvariety, the opinion of naturalists having sound judgment and wide\r\nexperience seems the only guide to follow. We must, however, in many\r\ncases, decide by a majority of naturalists, for few well-marked and\r\nwell-known varieties can be named which have not been ranked as species\r\nby at least some competent judges.\r\n\r\nThat varieties of this doubtful nature are far from uncommon cannot be\r\ndisputed. Compare the several floras of Great Britain, of France, or of\r\nthe United States, drawn up by different botanists, and see what a\r\nsurprising number of forms have been ranked by one botanist as good\r\nspecies, and by another as mere varieties. Mr. H.C. Watson, to whom I\r\nlie under deep obligation for assistance of all kinds, has marked for\r\nme 182 British plants, which are generally considered as varieties, but\r\nwhich have all been ranked by botanists as species; and in making this\r\nlist he has omitted many trifling varieties, but which nevertheless\r\nhave been ranked by some botanists as species, and he has entirely\r\nomitted several highly polymorphic genera. Under genera, including the\r\nmost polymorphic forms, Mr. Babington gives 251 species, whereas Mr.\r\nBentham gives only 112—a difference of 139 doubtful forms! Among\r\nanimals which unite for each birth, and which are highly locomotive,\r\ndoubtful forms, ranked by one zoologist as a species and by another as\r\na variety, can rarely be found within the same country, but are common\r\nin separated areas. How many of the birds and insects in North America\r\nand Europe, which differ very slightly from each other, have been\r\nranked by one eminent naturalist as undoubted species, and by another\r\nas varieties, or, as they are often called, geographical races! Mr.\r\nWallace, in several valuable papers on the various animals, especially\r\non the Lepidoptera, inhabiting the islands of the great Malayan\r\nArchipelago, shows that they may be classed under four heads, namely,\r\nas variable forms, as local forms, as geographical races or\r\nsub-species, and as true representative species. The first or variable\r\nforms vary much within the limits of the same island. The local forms\r\nare moderately constant and distinct in each separate island; but when\r\nall from the several islands are compared together, the differences are\r\nseen to be so slight and graduated that it is impossible to define or\r\ndescribe them, though at the same time the extreme forms are\r\nsufficiently distinct. The geographical races or sub-species are local\r\nforms completely fixed and isolated; but as they do not differ from\r\neach other by strongly marked and important characters, “There is no\r\npossible test but individual opinion to determine which of them shall\r\nbe considered as species and which as varieties.” Lastly,\r\nrepresentative species fill the same place in the natural economy of\r\neach island as do the local forms and sub-species; but as they are\r\ndistinguished from each other by a greater amount of difference than\r\nthat between the local forms and sub-species, they are almost\r\nuniversally ranked by naturalists as true species. Nevertheless, no\r\ncertain criterion can possibly be given by which variable forms, local\r\nforms, sub species and representative species can be recognised.\r\n\r\nMany years ago, when comparing, and seeing others compare, the birds\r\nfrom the closely neighbouring islands of the Galapagos Archipelago, one\r\nwith another, and with those from the American mainland, I was much\r\nstruck how entirely vague and arbitrary is the distinction between\r\nspecies and varieties. On the islets of the little Madeira group there\r\nare many insects which are characterized as varieties in Mr.\r\nWollaston’s admirable work, but which would certainly be ranked as\r\ndistinct species by many entomologists. Even Ireland has a few animals,\r\nnow generally regarded as varieties, but which have been ranked as\r\nspecies by some zoologists. Several experienced ornithologists consider\r\nour British red grouse as only a strongly marked race of a Norwegian\r\nspecies, whereas the greater number rank it as an undoubted species\r\npeculiar to Great Britain. A wide distance between the homes of two\r\ndoubtful forms leads many naturalists to rank them as distinct species;\r\nbut what distance, it has been well asked, will suffice if that between\r\nAmerica and Europe is ample, will that between Europe and the Azores,\r\nor Madeira, or the Canaries, or between the several islets of these\r\nsmall archipelagos, be sufficient?\r\n\r\nMr. B.D. Walsh, a distinguished entomologist of the United States, has\r\ndescribed what he calls Phytophagic varieties and Phytophagic species.\r\nMost vegetable-feeding insects live on one kind of plant or on one\r\ngroup of plants; some feed indiscriminately on many kinds, but do not\r\nin consequence vary. In several cases, however, insects found living on\r\ndifferent plants, have been observed by Mr. Walsh to present in their\r\nlarval or mature state, or in both states, slight, though constant\r\ndifferences in colour, size, or in the nature of their secretions. In\r\nsome instances the males alone, in other instances, both males and\r\nfemales, have been observed thus to differ in a slight degree. When the\r\ndifferences are rather more strongly marked, and when both sexes and\r\nall ages are affected, the forms are ranked by all entomologists as\r\ngood species. But no observer can determine for another, even if he can\r\ndo so for himself, which of these Phytophagic forms ought to be called\r\nspecies and which varieties. Mr. Walsh ranks the forms which it may be\r\nsupposed would freely intercross, as varieties; and those which appear\r\nto have lost this power, as species. As the differences depend on the\r\ninsects having long fed on distinct plants, it cannot be expected that\r\nintermediate links connecting the several forms should now be found.\r\nThe naturalist thus loses his best guide in determining whether to rank\r\ndoubtful forms as varieties or species. This likewise necessarily\r\noccurs with closely allied organisms, which inhabit distinct continents\r\nor islands. When, on the other hand, an animal or plant ranges over the\r\nsame continent, or inhabits many islands in the same archipelago, and\r\npresents different forms in the different areas, there is always a good\r\nchance that intermediate forms will be discovered which will link\r\ntogether the extreme states; and these are then degraded to the rank of\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nSome few naturalists maintain that animals never present varieties; but\r\nthen these same naturalists rank the slightest difference as of\r\nspecific value; and when the same identical form is met with in two\r\ndistant countries, or in two geological formations, they believe that\r\ntwo distinct species are hidden under the same dress. The term species\r\nthus comes to be a mere useless abstraction, implying and assuming a\r\nseparate act of creation. It is certain that many forms, considered by\r\nhighly competent judges to be varieties, resemble species so completely\r\nin character that they have been thus ranked by other highly competent\r\njudges. But to discuss whether they ought to be called species or\r\nvarieties, before any definition of these terms has been generally\r\naccepted, is vainly to beat the air.\r\n\r\nMany of the cases of strongly marked varieties or doubtful species well\r\ndeserve consideration; for several interesting lines of argument, from\r\ngeographical distribution, analogical variation, hybridism, &c., have\r\nbeen brought to bear in the attempt to determine their rank; but space\r\ndoes not here permit me to discuss them. Close investigation, in many\r\ncases, will no doubt bring naturalists to agree how to rank doubtful\r\nforms. Yet it must be confessed that it is in the best known countries\r\nthat we find the greatest number of them. I have been struck with the\r\nfact that if any animal or plant in a state of nature be highly useful\r\nto man, or from any cause closely attracts his attention, varieties of\r\nit will almost universally be found recorded. These varieties,\r\nmoreover, will often be ranked by some authors as species. Look at the\r\ncommon oak, how closely it has been studied; yet a German author makes\r\nmore than a dozen species out of forms, which are almost universally\r\nconsidered by other botanists to be varieties; and in this country the\r\nhighest botanical authorities and practical men can be quoted to show\r\nthat the sessile and pedunculated oaks are either good and distinct\r\nspecies or mere varieties.\r\n\r\nI may here allude to a remarkable memoir lately published by A. de\r\nCandolle, on the oaks of the whole world. No one ever had more ample\r\nmaterials for the discrimination of the species, or could have worked\r\non them with more zeal and sagacity. He first gives in detail all the\r\nmany points of structure which vary in the several species, and\r\nestimates numerically the relative frequency of the variations. He\r\nspecifies above a dozen characters which may be found varying even on\r\nthe same branch, sometimes according to age or development, sometimes\r\nwithout any assignable reason. Such characters are not of course of\r\nspecific value, but they are, as Asa Gray has remarked in commenting on\r\nthis memoir, such as generally enter into specific definitions. De\r\nCandolle then goes on to say that he gives the rank of species to the\r\nforms that differ by characters never varying on the same tree, and\r\nnever found connected by intermediate states. After this discussion,\r\nthe result of so much labour, he emphatically remarks: “They are\r\nmistaken, who repeat that the greater part of our species are clearly\r\nlimited, and that the doubtful species are in a feeble minority. This\r\nseemed to be true, so long as a genus was imperfectly known, and its\r\nspecies were founded upon a few specimens, that is to say, were\r\nprovisional. Just as we come to know them better, intermediate forms\r\nflow in, and doubts as to specific limits augment.” He also adds that\r\nit is the best known species which present the greatest number of\r\nspontaneous varieties and sub-varieties. Thus Quercus robur has\r\ntwenty-eight varieties, all of which, excepting six, are clustered\r\nround three sub-species, namely Q. pedunculata, sessiliflora and\r\npubescens. The forms which connect these three sub-species are\r\ncomparatively rare; and, as Asa Gray again remarks, if these connecting\r\nforms which are now rare were to become totally extinct the three\r\nsub-species would hold exactly the same relation to each other as do\r\nthe four or five provisionally admitted species which closely surround\r\nthe typical Quercus robur. Finally, De Candolle admits that out of the\r\n300 species, which will be enumerated in his Prodromus as belonging to\r\nthe oak family, at least two-thirds are provisional species, that is,\r\nare not known strictly to fulfil the definition above given of a true\r\nspecies. It should be added that De Candolle no longer believes that\r\nspecies are immutable creations, but concludes that the derivative\r\ntheory is the most natural one, “and the most accordant with the known\r\nfacts in palæontology, geographical botany and zoology, of anatomical\r\nstructure and classification.”\r\n\r\nWhen a young naturalist commences the study of a group of organisms\r\nquite unknown to him he is at first much perplexed in determining what\r\ndifferences to consider as specific and what as varietal; for he knows\r\nnothing of the amount and kind of variation to which the group is\r\nsubject; and this shows, at least, how very generally there is some\r\nvariation. But if he confine his attention to one class within one\r\ncountry he will soon make up his mind how to rank most of the doubtful\r\nforms. His general tendency will be to make many species, for he will\r\nbecome impressed, just like the pigeon or poultry fancier before\r\nalluded to, with the amount of difference in the forms which he is\r\ncontinually studying; and he has little general knowledge of analogical\r\nvariation in other groups and in other countries by which to correct\r\nhis first impressions. As he extends the range of his observations he\r\nwill meet with more cases of difficulty; for he will encounter a\r\ngreater number of closely-allied forms. But if his observations be\r\nwidely extended he will in the end generally be able to make up his own\r\nmind; but he will succeed in this at the expense of admitting much\r\nvariation, and the truth of this admission will often be disputed by\r\nother naturalists. When he comes to study allied forms brought from\r\ncountries not now continuous, in which case he cannot hope to find\r\nintermediate links, he will be compelled to trust almost entirely to\r\nanalogy, and his difficulties will rise to a climax.\r\n\r\nCertainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn between\r\nspecies and sub-species—that is, the forms which in the opinion of some\r\nnaturalists come very near to, but do not quite arrive at, the rank of\r\nspecies; or, again, between sub-species and well-marked varieties, or\r\nbetween lesser varieties and individual differences. These differences\r\nblend into each other by an insensible series; and a series impresses\r\nthe mind with the idea of an actual passage.\r\n\r\nHence I look at individual differences, though of small interest to the\r\nsystematist, as of the highest importance for us, as being the first\r\nstep towards such slight varieties as are barely thought worth\r\nrecording in works on natural history. And I look at varieties which\r\nare in any degree more distinct and permanent, as steps towards more\r\nstrongly marked and permanent varieties; and at the latter, as leading\r\nto sub-species, and then to species. The passage from one stage of\r\ndifference to another may, in many cases, be the simple result of the\r\nnature of the organism and of the different physical conditions to\r\nwhich it has long been exposed; but with respect to the more important\r\nand adaptive characters, the passage from one stage of difference to\r\nanother may be safely attributed to the cumulative action of natural\r\nselection, hereafter to be explained, and to the effects of the\r\nincreased use or disuse of parts. A well-marked variety may therefore\r\nbe called an incipient species; but whether this belief is justifiable\r\nmust be judged by the weight of the various facts and considerations to\r\nbe given throughout this work.\r\n\r\nIt need not be supposed that all varieties or incipient species attain\r\nthe rank of species. They may become extinct, or they may endure as\r\nvarieties for very long periods, as has been shown to be the case by\r\nMr. Wollaston with the varieties of certain fossil land-shells in\r\nMadeira, and with plants by Gaston de Saporta. If a variety were to\r\nflourish so as to exceed in numbers the parent species, it would then\r\nrank as the species, and the species as the variety; or it might come\r\nto supplant and exterminate the parent species; or both might co-exist,\r\nand both rank as independent species. But we shall hereafter return to\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that I look at the term species as\r\none arbitrarily given, for the sake of convenience, to a set of\r\nindividuals closely resembling each other, and that it does not\r\nessentially differ from the term variety, which is given to less\r\ndistinct and more fluctuating forms. The term variety, again, in\r\ncomparison with mere individual differences, is also applied\r\narbitrarily, for convenience sake.\r\n\r\n_Wide-ranging, much-diffused, and common Species vary most._\r\n\r\n\r\nGuided by theoretical considerations, I thought that some interesting\r\nresults might be obtained in regard to the nature and relations of the\r\nspecies which vary most, by tabulating all the varieties in several\r\nwell-worked floras. At first this seemed a simple task; but Mr. H.C.\r\nWatson, to whom I am much indebted for valuable advice and assistance\r\non this subject, soon convinced me that there were many difficulties,\r\nas did subsequently Dr. Hooker, even in stronger terms. I shall reserve\r\nfor a future work the discussion of these difficulties, and the tables\r\nof the proportional numbers of the varying species. Dr. Hooker permits\r\nme to add that after having carefully read my manuscript, and examined\r\nthe tables, he thinks that the following statements are fairly well\r\nestablished. The whole subject, however, treated as it necessarily here\r\nis with much brevity, is rather perplexing, and allusions cannot be\r\navoided to the “struggle for existence,” “divergence of character,” and\r\nother questions, hereafter to be discussed.\r\n\r\nAlphonse de Candolle and others have shown that plants which have very\r\nwide ranges generally present varieties; and this might have been\r\nexpected, as they are exposed to diverse physical conditions, and as\r\nthey come into competition (which, as we shall hereafter see, is a far\r\nmore important circumstance) with different sets of organic beings. But\r\nmy tables further show that, in any limited country, the species which\r\nare the most common, that is abound most in individuals, and the\r\nspecies which are most widely diffused within their own country (and\r\nthis is a different consideration from wide range, and to a certain\r\nextent from commonness), oftenest give rise to varieties sufficiently\r\nwell-marked to have been recorded in botanical works. Hence it is the\r\nmost flourishing, or, as they may be called, the dominant species—those\r\nwhich range widely, are the most diffused in their own country, and are\r\nthe most numerous in individuals—which oftenest produce well-marked\r\nvarieties, or, as I consider them, incipient species. And this,\r\nperhaps, might have been anticipated; for, as varieties, in order to\r\nbecome in any degree permanent, necessarily have to struggle with the\r\nother inhabitants of the country, the species which are already\r\ndominant will be the most likely to yield offspring, which, though in\r\nsome slight degree modified, still inherit those advantages that\r\nenabled their parents to become dominant over their compatriots. In\r\nthese remarks on predominence, it should be understood that reference\r\nis made only to the forms which come into competition with each other,\r\nand more especially to the members of the same genus or class having\r\nnearly similar habits of life. With respect to the number of\r\nindividuals or commonness of species, the comparison of course relates\r\nonly to the members of the same group. One of the higher plants may be\r\nsaid to be dominant if it be more numerous in individuals and more\r\nwidely diffused than the other plants of the same country, which live\r\nunder nearly the same conditions. A plant of this kind is not the less\r\ndominant because some conferva inhabiting the water or some parasitic\r\nfungus is infinitely more numerous in individuals, and more widely\r\ndiffused. But if the conferva or parasitic fungus exceeds its allies in\r\nthe above respects, it will then be dominant within its own class.\r\n\r\n_Species of the Larger Genera in each Country vary more Frequently than\r\nthe Species of the Smaller Genera._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the plants inhabiting a country as described in any Flora, be\r\ndivided into two equal masses, all those in the larger genera (_i.e._,\r\nthose including many species) being placed on one side, and all those\r\nin the smaller genera on the other side, the former will be found to\r\ninclude a somewhat larger number of the very common and much diffused\r\nor dominant species. This might have been anticipated, for the mere\r\nfact of many species of the same genus inhabiting any country, shows\r\nthat there is something in the organic or inorganic conditions of that\r\ncountry favourable to the genus; and, consequently, we might have\r\nexpected to have found in the larger genera, or those including many\r\nspecies, a larger proportional number of dominant species. But so many\r\ncauses tend to obscure this result, that I am surprised that my tables\r\nshow even a small majority on the side of the larger genera. I will\r\nhere allude to only two causes of obscurity. Fresh water and\r\nsalt-loving plants generally have very wide ranges and are much\r\ndiffused, but this seems to be connected with the nature of the\r\nstations inhabited by them, and has little or no relation to the size\r\nof the genera to which the species belong. Again, plants low in the\r\nscale of organisation are generally much more widely diffused than\r\nplants higher in the scale; and here again there is no close relation\r\nto the size of the genera. The cause of lowly-organised plants ranging\r\nwidely will be discussed in our chapter on Geographical Distribution.\r\n\r\nFrom looking at species as only strongly marked and well-defined\r\nvarieties, I was led to anticipate that the species of the larger\r\ngenera in each country would oftener present varieties, than the\r\nspecies of the smaller genera; for wherever many closely related\r\nspecies (_i.e._, species of the same genus) have been formed, many\r\nvarieties or incipient species ought, as a general rule, to be now\r\nforming. Where many large trees grow, we expect to find saplings. Where\r\nmany species of a genus have been formed through variation,\r\ncircumstances have been favourable for variation; and hence we might\r\nexpect that the circumstances would generally still be favourable to\r\nvariation. On the other hand, if we look at each species as a special\r\nact of creation, there is no apparent reason why more varieties should\r\noccur in a group having many species, than in one having few.\r\n\r\nTo test the truth of this anticipation I have arranged the plants of\r\ntwelve countries, and the coleopterous insects of two districts, into\r\ntwo nearly equal masses, the species of the larger genera on one side,\r\nand those of the smaller genera on the other side, and it has\r\ninvariably proved to be the case that a larger proportion of the\r\nspecies on the side of the larger genera presented varieties, than on\r\nthe side of the smaller genera. Moreover, the species of the large\r\ngenera which present any varieties, invariably present a larger average\r\nnumber of varieties than do the species of the small genera. Both these\r\nresults follow when another division is made, and when all the least\r\ngenera, with from only one to four species, are altogether excluded\r\nfrom the tables. These facts are of plain signification on the view\r\nthat species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties; for\r\nwherever many species of the same genus have been formed, or where, if\r\nwe may use the expression, the manufactory of species has been active,\r\nwe ought generally to find the manufactory still in action, more\r\nespecially as we have every reason to believe the process of\r\nmanufacturing new species to be a slow one. And this certainly holds\r\ntrue if varieties be looked at as incipient species; for my tables\r\nclearly show, as a general rule, that, wherever many species of a genus\r\nhave been formed, the species of that genus present a number of\r\nvarieties, that is, of incipient species, beyond the average. It is not\r\nthat all large genera are now varying much, and are thus increasing in\r\nthe number of their species, or that no small genera are now varying\r\nand increasing; for if this had been so, it would have been fatal to my\r\ntheory; inasmuch as geology plainly tells us that small genera have in\r\nthe lapse of time often increased greatly in size; and that large\r\ngenera have often come to their maxima, declined, and disappeared. All\r\nthat we want to show is, that where many species of a genus have been\r\nformed, on an average many are still forming; and this certainly holds\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n_Many of the Species included within the Larger Genera resemble\r\nVarieties in being very closely, but unequally, related to each other,\r\nand in having restricted ranges._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are other relations between the species of large genera and their\r\nrecorded varieties which deserve notice. We have seen that there is no\r\ninfallible criterion by which to distinguish species and well-marked\r\nvarieties; and when intermediate links have not been found between\r\ndoubtful forms, naturalists are compelled to come to a determination by\r\nthe amount of difference between them, judging by analogy whether or\r\nnot the amount suffices to raise one or both to the rank of species.\r\nHence the amount of difference is one very important criterion in\r\nsettling whether two forms should be ranked as species or varieties.\r\nNow Fries has remarked in regard to plants, and Westwood in regard to\r\ninsects, that in large genera the amount of difference between the\r\nspecies is often exceedingly small. I have endeavoured to test this\r\nnumerically by averages, and, as far as my imperfect results go, they\r\nconfirm the view. I have also consulted some sagacious and experienced\r\nobservers, and, after deliberation, they concur in this view. In this\r\nrespect, therefore, the species of the larger genera resemble\r\nvarieties, more than do the species of the smaller genera. Or the case\r\nmay be put in another way, and it may be said, that in the larger\r\ngenera, in which a number of varieties or incipient species greater\r\nthan the average are now manufacturing, many of the species already\r\nmanufactured still to a certain extent resemble varieties, for they\r\ndiffer from each other by a less than the usual amount of difference.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the species of the larger genera are related to each other,\r\nin the same manner as the varieties of any one species are related to\r\neach other. No naturalist pretends that all the species of a genus are\r\nequally distinct from each other; they may generally be divided into\r\nsub-genera, or sections, or lesser groups. As Fries has well remarked,\r\nlittle groups of species are generally clustered like satellites around\r\nother species. And what are varieties but groups of forms, unequally\r\nrelated to each other, and clustered round certain forms—that is, round\r\ntheir parent-species. Undoubtedly there is one most important point of\r\ndifference between varieties and species, namely, that the amount of\r\ndifference between varieties, when compared with each other or with\r\ntheir parent-species, is much less than that between the species of the\r\nsame genus. But when we come to discuss the principle, as I call it, of\r\ndivergence of character, we shall see how this may be explained, and\r\nhow the lesser differences between varieties tend to increase into the\r\ngreater differences between species.\r\n\r\nThere is one other point which is worth notice. Varieties generally\r\nhave much restricted ranges. This statement is indeed scarcely more\r\nthan a truism, for if a variety were found to have a wider range than\r\nthat of its supposed parent-species, their denominations would be\r\nreversed. But there is reason to believe that the species which are\r\nvery closely allied to other species, and in so far resemble varieties,\r\noften have much restricted ranges. For instance, Mr. H.C. Watson has\r\nmarked for me in the well-sifted London catalogue of Plants (4th\r\nedition) sixty-three plants which are therein ranked as species, but\r\nwhich he considers as so closely allied to other species as to be of\r\ndoubtful value: these sixty-three reputed species range on an average\r\nover 6.9 of the provinces into which Mr. Watson has divided Great\r\nBritain. Now, in this same catalogue, fifty-three acknowledged\r\nvarieties are recorded, and these range over 7.7 provinces; whereas,\r\nthe species to which these varieties belong range over 14.3 provinces.\r\nSo that the acknowledged varieties have very nearly the same restricted\r\naverage range, as have the closely allied forms, marked for me by Mr.\r\nWatson as doubtful species, but which are almost universally ranked by\r\nBritish botanists as good and true species.\r\n\r\n_Summary._\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, varieties cannot be distinguished from species—except, first,\r\nby the discovery of intermediate linking forms; and, secondly, by a\r\ncertain indefinite amount of difference between them; for two forms, if\r\ndiffering very little, are generally ranked as varieties,\r\nnotwithstanding that they cannot be closely connected; but the amount\r\nof difference considered necessary to give to any two forms the rank of\r\nspecies cannot be defined. In genera having more than the average\r\nnumber of species in any country, the species of these genera have more\r\nthan the average number of varieties. In large genera the species are\r\napt to be closely but unequally allied together, forming little\r\nclusters round other species. Species very closely allied to other\r\nspecies apparently have restricted ranges. In all these respects the\r\nspecies of large genera present a strong analogy with varieties. And we\r\ncan clearly understand these analogies, if species once existed as\r\nvarieties, and thus originated; whereas, these analogies are utterly\r\ninexplicable if species are independent creations.\r\n\r\nWe have also seen that it is the most flourishing or dominant species\r\nof the larger genera within each class which on an average yield the\r\ngreatest number of varieties, and varieties, as we shall hereafter see,\r\ntend to become converted into new and distinct species. Thus the larger\r\ngenera tend to become larger; and throughout nature the forms of life\r\nwhich are now dominant tend to become still more dominant by leaving\r\nmany modified and dominant descendants. But, by steps hereafter to be\r\nexplained, the larger genera also tend to break up into smaller genera.\r\nAnd thus, the forms of life throughout the universe become divided into\r\ngroups subordinate to groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nSTRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIts bearing on natural selection—The term used in a wide\r\nsense—Geometrical ratio of increase—Rapid increase of naturalised\r\nanimals and plants—Nature of the checks to increase—Competition\r\nuniversal—Effects of climate—Protection from the number of\r\nindividuals—Complex relations of all animals and plants throughout\r\nnature—Struggle for life most severe between individuals and varieties\r\nof the same species: often severe between species of the same genus—The\r\nrelation of organism to organism the most important of all relations.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore entering on the subject of this chapter I must make a few\r\npreliminary remarks to show how the struggle for existence bears on\r\nnatural selection. It has been seen in the last chapter that among\r\norganic beings in a state of nature there is some individual\r\nvariability: indeed I am not aware that this has ever been disputed. It\r\nis immaterial for us whether a multitude of doubtful forms be called\r\nspecies or sub-species or varieties; what rank, for instance, the two\r\nor three hundred doubtful forms of British plants are entitled to hold,\r\nif the existence of any well-marked varieties be admitted. But the mere\r\nexistence of individual variability and of some few well-marked\r\nvarieties, though necessary as the foundation for the work, helps us\r\nbut little in understanding how species arise in nature. How have all\r\nthose exquisite adaptations of one part of the organisation to another\r\npart, and to the conditions of life and of one organic being to another\r\nbeing, been perfected? We see these beautiful co-adaptations most\r\nplainly in the woodpecker and the mistletoe; and only a little less\r\nplainly in the humblest parasite which clings to the hairs of a\r\nquadruped or feathers of a bird; in the structure of the beetle which\r\ndives through the water; in the plumed seed which is wafted by the\r\ngentlest breeze; in short, we see beautiful adaptations everywhere and\r\nin every part of the organic world.\r\n\r\nAgain, it may be asked, how is it that varieties, which I have called\r\nincipient species, become ultimately converted into good and distinct\r\nspecies, which in most cases obviously differ from each other far more\r\nthan do the varieties of the same species? How do those groups of\r\nspecies, which constitute what are called distinct genera, and which\r\ndiffer from each other more than do the species of the same genus,\r\narise? All these results, as we shall more fully see in the next\r\nchapter, follow from the struggle for life. Owing to this struggle,\r\nvariations, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if they\r\nbe in any degree profitable to the individuals of a species, in their\r\ninfinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to their\r\nphysical conditions of life, will tend to the preservation of such\r\nindividuals, and will generally be inherited by the offspring. The\r\noffspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for, of\r\nthe many individuals of any species which are periodically born, but a\r\nsmall number can survive. I have called this principle, by which each\r\nslight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term natural\r\nselection, in order to mark its relation to man’s power of selection.\r\nBut the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer, of the Survival\r\nof the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.\r\nWe have seen that man by selection can certainly produce great results,\r\nand can adapt organic beings to his own uses, through the accumulation\r\nof slight but useful variations, given to him by the hand of Nature.\r\nBut Natural Selection, we shall hereafter see, is a power incessantly\r\nready for action, and is as immeasurably superior to man’s feeble\r\nefforts, as the works of Nature are to those of Art.\r\n\r\nWe will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for existence.\r\nIn my future work this subject will be treated, as it well deserves, at\r\ngreater length. The elder De Candolle and Lyell have largely and\r\nphilosophically shown that all organic beings are exposed to severe\r\ncompetition. In regard to plants, no one has treated this subject with\r\nmore spirit and ability than W. Herbert, Dean of Manchester, evidently\r\nthe result of his great horticultural knowledge. Nothing is easier than\r\nto admit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life, or more\r\ndifficult—at least I found it so—than constantly to bear this\r\nconclusion in mind. Yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind,\r\nthe whole economy of nature, with every fact on distribution, rarity,\r\nabundance, extinction, and variation, will be dimly seen or quite\r\nmisunderstood. We behold the face of nature bright with gladness, we\r\noften see superabundance of food; we do not see or we forget that the\r\nbirds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds,\r\nand are thus constantly destroying life; or we forget how largely these\r\nsongsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by birds\r\nand beasts of prey; we do not always bear in mind, that, though food\r\nmay be now superabundant, it is not so at all seasons of each recurring\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n_The Term, Struggle for Existence, used in a large sense._\r\n\r\n\r\nI should premise that I use this term in a large and metaphorical\r\nsense, including dependence of one being on another, and including\r\n(which is more important) not only the life of the individual, but\r\nsuccess in leaving progeny. Two canine animals, in a time of dearth,\r\nmay be truly said to struggle with each other which shall get food and\r\nlive. But a plant on the edge of a desert is said to struggle for life\r\nagainst the drought, though more properly it should be said to be\r\ndependent on the moisture. A plant which annually produces a thousand\r\nseeds, of which only one of an average comes to maturity, may be more\r\ntruly said to struggle with the plants of the same and other kinds\r\nwhich already clothe the ground. The mistletoe is dependent on the\r\napple and a few other trees, but can only in a far-fetched sense be\r\nsaid to struggle with these trees, for, if too many of these parasites\r\ngrow on the same tree, it languishes and dies. But several seedling\r\nmistletoes, growing close together on the same branch, may more truly\r\nbe said to struggle with each other. As the mistletoe is disseminated\r\nby birds, its existence depends on them; and it may metaphorically be\r\nsaid to struggle with other fruit-bearing plants, in tempting the birds\r\nto devour and thus disseminate its seeds. In these several senses,\r\nwhich pass into each other, I use for convenience sake the general term\r\nof Struggle for Existence.\r\n\r\n_Geometrical Ratio of Increase._\r\n\r\n\r\nA struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at which\r\nall organic beings tend to increase. Every being, which during its\r\nnatural lifetime produces several eggs or seeds, must suffer\r\ndestruction during some period of its life, and during some season or\r\noccasional year, otherwise, on the principle of geometrical increase,\r\nits numbers would quickly become so inordinately great that no country\r\ncould support the product. Hence, as more individuals are produced than\r\ncan possibly survive, there must in every case be a struggle for\r\nexistence, either one individual with another of the same species, or\r\nwith the individuals of distinct species, or with the physical\r\nconditions of life. It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold\r\nforce to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms; for in this case\r\nthere can be no artificial increase of food, and no prudential\r\nrestraint from marriage. Although some species may be now increasing,\r\nmore or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would\r\nnot hold them.\r\n\r\nThere is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally\r\nincreases at so high a rate, that, if not destroyed, the earth would\r\nsoon be covered by the progeny of a single pair. Even slow-breeding man\r\nhas doubled in twenty-five years, and at this rate, in less than a\r\nthousand years, there would literally not be standing room for his\r\nprogeny. Linnæus has calculated that if an annual plant produced only\r\ntwo seeds—and there is no plant so unproductive as this—and their\r\nseedlings next year produced two, and so on, then in twenty years there\r\nwould be a million plants. The elephant is reckoned the slowest breeder\r\nof all known animals, and I have taken some pains to estimate its\r\nprobable minimum rate of natural increase; it will be safest to assume\r\nthat it begins breeding when thirty years old, and goes on breeding\r\ntill ninety years old, bringing forth six young in the interval, and\r\nsurviving till one hundred years old; if this be so, after a period of\r\nfrom 740 to 750 years there would be nearly nineteen million elephants\r\nalive descended from the first pair.\r\n\r\nBut we have better evidence on this subject than mere theoretical\r\ncalculations, namely, the numerous recorded cases of the astonishingly\r\nrapid increase of various animals in a state of nature, when\r\ncircumstances have been favourable to them during two or three\r\nfollowing seasons. Still more striking is the evidence from our\r\ndomestic animals of many kinds which have run wild in several parts of\r\nthe world; if the statements of the rate of increase of slow-breeding\r\ncattle and horses in South America, and latterly in Australia, had not\r\nbeen well authenticated, they would have been incredible. So it is with\r\nplants; cases could be given of introduced plants which have become\r\ncommon throughout whole islands in a period of less than ten years.\r\nSeveral of the plants, such as the cardoon and a tall thistle, which\r\nare now the commonest over the wide plains of La Plata, clothing square\r\nleagues of surface almost to the exclusion of every other plant, have\r\nbeen introduced from Europe; and there are plants which now range in\r\nIndia, as I hear from Dr. Falconer, from Cape Comorin to the Himalaya,\r\nwhich have been imported from America since its discovery. In such\r\ncases, and endless others could be given, no one supposes that the\r\nfertility of the animals or plants has been suddenly and temporarily\r\nincreased in any sensible degree. The obvious explanation is that the\r\nconditions of life have been highly favourable, and that there has\r\nconsequently been less destruction of the old and young and that nearly\r\nall the young have been enabled to breed. Their geometrical ratio of\r\nincrease, the result of which never fails to be surprising, simply\r\nexplains their extraordinarily rapid increase and wide diffusion in\r\ntheir new homes.\r\n\r\nIn a state of nature almost every full-grown plant annually produces\r\nseed, and among animals there are very few which do not annually pair.\r\nHence we may confidently assert that all plants and animals are tending\r\nto increase at a geometrical ratio—that all would rapidly stock every\r\nstation in which they could any how exist, and that this geometrical\r\ntendency to increase must be checked by destruction at some period of\r\nlife. Our familiarity with the larger domestic animals tends, I think,\r\nto mislead us; we see no great destruction falling on them, and we do\r\nnot keep in mind that thousands are annually slaughtered for food, and\r\nthat in a state of nature an equal number would have somehow to be\r\ndisposed of.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between organisms which annually produce eggs or\r\nseeds by the thousand, and those which produce extremely few, is, that\r\nthe slow breeders would require a few more years to people, under\r\nfavourable conditions, a whole district, let it be ever so large. The\r\ncondor lays a couple of eggs and the ostrich a score, and yet in the\r\nsame country the condor may be the more numerous of the two. The Fulmar\r\npetrel lays but one egg, yet it is believed to be the most numerous\r\nbird in the world. One fly deposits hundreds of eggs, and another, like\r\nthe hippobosca, a single one. But this difference does not determine\r\nhow many individuals of the two species can be supported in a district.\r\nA large number of eggs is of some importance to those species which\r\ndepend on a fluctuating amount of food, for it allows them rapidly to\r\nincrease in number. But the real importance of a large number of eggs\r\nor seeds is to make up for much destruction at some period of life; and\r\nthis period in the great majority of cases is an early one. If an\r\nanimal can in any way protect its own eggs or young, a small number may\r\nbe produced, and yet the average stock be fully kept up; but if many\r\neggs or young are destroyed, many must be produced or the species will\r\nbecome extinct. It would suffice to keep up the full number of a tree,\r\nwhich lived on an average for a thousand years, if a single seed were\r\nproduced once in a thousand years, supposing that this seed were never\r\ndestroyed and could be ensured to germinate in a fitting place; so\r\nthat, in all cases, the average number of any animal or plant depends\r\nonly indirectly on the number of its eggs or seeds.\r\n\r\nIn looking at Nature, it is most necessary to keep the foregoing\r\nconsiderations always in mind—never to forget that every single organic\r\nbeing may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase in numbers;\r\nthat each lives by a struggle at some period of its life; that heavy\r\ndestruction inevitably falls either on the young or old during each\r\ngeneration or at recurrent intervals. Lighten any check, mitigate the\r\ndestruction ever so little, and the number of the species will almost\r\ninstantaneously increase to any amount.\r\n\r\n_Nature of the Checks to Increase._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe causes which check the natural tendency of each species to increase\r\nare most obscure. Look at the most vigorous species; by as much as it\r\nswarms in numbers, by so much will it tend to increase still further.\r\nWe know not exactly what the checks are even in a single instance. Nor\r\nwill this surprise any one who reflects how ignorant we are on this\r\nhead, even in regard to mankind, although so incomparably better known\r\nthan any other animal. This subject of the checks to increase has been\r\nably treated by several authors, and I hope in a future work to discuss\r\nit at considerable length, more especially in regard to the feral\r\nanimals of South America. Here I will make only a few remarks, just to\r\nrecall to the reader’s mind some of the chief points. Eggs or very\r\nyoung animals seem generally to suffer most, but this is not invariably\r\nthe case. With plants there is a vast destruction of seeds, but from\r\nsome observations which I have made it appears that the seedlings\r\nsuffer most from germinating in ground already thickly stocked with\r\nother plants. Seedlings, also, are destroyed in vast numbers by various\r\nenemies; for instance, on a piece of ground three feet long and two\r\nwide, dug and cleared, and where there could be no choking from other\r\nplants, I marked all the seedlings of our native weeds as they came up,\r\nand out of 357 no less than 295 were destroyed, chiefly by slugs and\r\ninsects. If turf which has long been mown, and the case would be the\r\nsame with turf closely browsed by quadrupeds, be let to grow, the more\r\nvigorous plants gradually kill the less vigorous, though fully grown\r\nplants; thus out of twenty species grown on a little plot of mown turf\r\n(three feet by four) nine species perished, from the other species\r\nbeing allowed to grow up freely.\r\n\r\nThe amount of food for each species, of course, gives the extreme limit\r\nto which each can increase; but very frequently it is not the obtaining\r\nfood, but the serving as prey to other animals, which determines the\r\naverage number of a species. Thus, there seems to be little doubt that\r\nthe stock of partridges, grouse, and hares on any large estate depends\r\nchiefly on the destruction of vermin. If not one head of game were shot\r\nduring the next twenty years in England, and, at the same time, if no\r\nvermin were destroyed, there would, in all probability, be less game\r\nthan at present, although hundreds of thousands of game animals are now\r\nannually shot. On the other hand, in some cases, as with the elephant,\r\nnone are destroyed by beasts of prey; for even the tiger in India most\r\nrarely dares to attack a young elephant protected by its dam.\r\n\r\nClimate plays an important part in determining the average numbers of a\r\nspecies, and periodical seasons of extreme cold or drought seem to be\r\nthe most effective of all checks. I estimated (chiefly from the greatly\r\nreduced numbers of nests in the spring) that the winter of 1854-5\r\ndestroyed four-fifths of the birds in my own grounds; and this is a\r\ntremendous destruction, when we remember that ten per cent. is an\r\nextraordinarily severe mortality from epidemics with man. The action of\r\nclimate seems at first sight to be quite independent of the struggle\r\nfor existence; but in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food,\r\nit brings on the most severe struggle between the individuals, whether\r\nof the same or of distinct species, which subsist on the same kind of\r\nfood. Even when climate, for instance, extreme cold, acts directly, it\r\nwill be the least vigorous individuals, or those which have got least\r\nfood through the advancing winter, which will suffer the most. When we\r\ntravel from south to north, or from a damp region to a dry, we\r\ninvariably see some species gradually getting rarer and rarer, and\r\nfinally disappearing; and the change of climate being conspicuous, we\r\nare tempted to attribute the whole effect to its direct action. But\r\nthis is a false view; we forget that each species, even where it most\r\nabounds, is constantly suffering enormous destruction at some period of\r\nits life, from enemies or from competitors for the same place and food;\r\nand if these enemies or competitors be in the least degree favoured by\r\nany slight change of climate, they will increase in numbers; and as\r\neach area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, the other species\r\nmust decrease. When we travel southward and see a species decreasing in\r\nnumbers, we may feel sure that the cause lies quite as much in other\r\nspecies being favoured, as in this one being hurt. So it is when we\r\ntravel northward, but in a somewhat lesser degree, for the number of\r\nspecies of all kinds, and therefore of competitors, decreases\r\nnorthward; hence in going northward, or in ascending a mountain, we far\r\noftener meet with stunted forms, due to the _directly_ injurious action\r\nof climate, than we do in proceeding southward or in descending a\r\nmountain. When we reach the Arctic regions, or snow-capped summits, or\r\nabsolute deserts, the struggle for life is almost exclusively with the\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nThat climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other species we\r\nclearly see in the prodigious number of plants which in our gardens can\r\nperfectly well endure our climate, but which never become naturalised,\r\nfor they cannot compete with our native plants nor resist destruction\r\nby our native animals.\r\n\r\nWhen a species, owing to highly favourable circumstances, increases\r\ninordinately in numbers in a small tract, epidemics—at least, this\r\nseems generally to occur with our game animals—often ensue; and here we\r\nhave a limiting check independent of the struggle for life. But even\r\nsome of these so-called epidemics appear to be due to parasitic worms,\r\nwhich have from some cause, possibly in part through facility of\r\ndiffusion among the crowded animals, been disproportionally favoured:\r\nand here comes in a sort of struggle between the parasite and its prey.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in many cases, a large stock of individuals of the\r\nsame species, relatively to the numbers of its enemies, is absolutely\r\nnecessary for its preservation. Thus we can easily raise plenty of corn\r\nand rape-seed, &c., in our fields, because the seeds are in great\r\nexcess compared with the number of birds which feed on them; nor can\r\nthe birds, though having a superabundance of food at this one season,\r\nincrease in number proportionally to the supply of seed, as their\r\nnumbers are checked during the winter; but any one who has tried knows\r\nhow troublesome it is to get seed from a few wheat or other such plants\r\nin a garden; I have in this case lost every single seed. This view of\r\nthe necessity of a large stock of the same species for its\r\npreservation, explains, I believe, some singular facts in nature such\r\nas that of very rare plants being sometimes extremely abundant, in the\r\nfew spots where they do exist; and that of some social plants being\r\nsocial, that is abounding in individuals, even on the extreme verge of\r\ntheir range. For in such cases, we may believe, that a plant could\r\nexist only where the conditions of its life were so favourable that\r\nmany could exist together, and thus save the species from utter\r\ndestruction. I should add that the good effects of intercrossing, and\r\nthe ill effects of close interbreeding, no doubt come into play in many\r\nof these cases; but I will not here enlarge on this subject.\r\n\r\n_Complex Relations of all Animals and Plants to each other in the\r\nStruggle for Existence._\r\n\r\n\r\nMany cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are the\r\nchecks and relations between organic beings, which have to struggle\r\ntogether in the same country. I will give only a single instance,\r\nwhich, though a simple one, interested me. In Staffordshire, on the\r\nestate of a relation, where I had ample means of investigation, there\r\nwas a large and extremely barren heath, which had never been touched by\r\nthe hand of man; but several hundred acres of exactly the same nature\r\nhad been enclosed twenty-five years previously and planted with Scotch\r\nfir. The change in the native vegetation of the planted part of the\r\nheath was most remarkable, more than is generally seen in passing from\r\none quite different soil to another: not only the proportional numbers\r\nof the heath-plants were wholly changed, but twelve species of plants\r\n(not counting grasses and carices) flourished in the plantations, which\r\ncould not be found on the heath. The effect on the insects must have\r\nbeen still greater, for six insectivorous birds were very common in the\r\nplantations, which were not to be seen on the heath; and the heath was\r\nfrequented by two or three distinct insectivorous birds. Here we see\r\nhow potent has been the effect of the introduction of a single tree,\r\nnothing whatever else having been done, with the exception of the land\r\nhaving been enclosed, so that cattle could not enter. But how important\r\nan element enclosure is, I plainly saw near Farnham, in Surrey. Here\r\nthere are extensive heaths, with a few clumps of old Scotch firs on the\r\ndistant hill-tops: within the last ten years large spaces have been\r\nenclosed, and self-sown firs are now springing up in multitudes, so\r\nclose together that all cannot live. When I ascertained that these\r\nyoung trees had not been sown or planted I was so much surprised at\r\ntheir numbers that I went to several points of view, whence I could\r\nexamine hundreds of acres of the unenclosed heath, and literally I\r\ncould not see a single Scotch fir, except the old planted clumps. But\r\non looking closely between the stems of the heath, I found a multitude\r\nof seedlings and little trees, which had been perpetually browsed down\r\nby the cattle. In one square yard, at a point some hundred yards\r\ndistant from one of the old clumps, I counted thirty-two little trees;\r\nand one of them, with twenty-six rings of growth, had, during many\r\nyears tried to raise its head above the stems of the heath, and had\r\nfailed. No wonder that, as soon as the land was enclosed, it became\r\nthickly clothed with vigorously growing young firs. Yet the heath was\r\nso extremely barren and so extensive that no one would ever have\r\nimagined that cattle would have so closely and effectually searched it\r\nfor food.\r\n\r\nHere we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the\r\nScotch fir; but in several parts of the world insects determine the\r\nexistence of cattle. Perhaps Paraguay offers the most curious instance\r\nof this; for here neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run\r\nwild, though they swarm southward and northward in a feral state; and\r\nAzara and Rengger have shown that this is caused by the greater number\r\nin Paraguay of a certain fly, which lays its eggs in the navels of\r\nthese animals when first born. The increase of these flies, numerous as\r\nthey are, must be habitually checked by some means, probably by other\r\nparasitic insects. Hence, if certain insectivorous birds were to\r\ndecrease in Paraguay, the parasitic insects would probably increase;\r\nand this would lessen the number of the navel-frequenting flies—then\r\ncattle and horses would become feral, and this would certainly greatly\r\nalter (as indeed I have observed in parts of South America) the\r\nvegetation: this again would largely affect the insects; and this, as\r\nwe have just seen in Staffordshire, the insectivorous birds, and so\r\nonwards in ever-increasing circles of complexity. Not that under nature\r\nthe relations will ever be as simple as this. Battle within battle must\r\nbe continually recurring with varying success; and yet in the long-run\r\nthe forces are so nicely balanced that the face of nature remains for\r\nlong periods of time uniform, though assuredly the merest trifle would\r\ngive the victory to one organic being over another. Nevertheless, so\r\nprofound is our ignorance, and so high our presumption, that we marvel\r\nwhen we hear of the extinction of an organic being; and as we do not\r\nsee the cause, we invoke cataclysms to desolate the world, or invent\r\nlaws on the duration of the forms of life!\r\n\r\n I am tempted to give one more instance showing how plants and animals,\r\n remote in the scale of nature, are bound together by a web of complex\r\n relations. I shall hereafter have occasion to show that the exotic\r\n Lobelia fulgens is never visited in my garden by insects, and\r\n consequently, from its peculiar structure, never sets a seed. Nearly\r\n all our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of insects\r\n to remove their pollen-masses and thus to fertilise them. I find from\r\n experiments that humble-bees are almost indispensable to the\r\n fertilisation of the heartsease (Viola tricolor), for other bees do\r\n not visit this flower. I have also found that the visits of bees are\r\n necessary for the fertilisation of some kinds of clover; for instance\r\n twenty heads of Dutch clover (Trifolium repens) yielded 2,290 seeds,\r\n but twenty other heads, protected from bees, produced not one. Again,\r\n 100 heads of red clover (T. pratense) produced 2,700 seeds, but the\r\n same number of protected heads produced not a single seed. Humble bees\r\n alone visit red clover, as other bees cannot reach the nectar. It has\r\n been suggested that moths may fertilise the clovers; but I doubt\r\n whether they could do so in the case of the red clover, from their\r\n weight not being sufficient to depress the wing petals. Hence we may\r\n infer as highly probable that, if the whole genus of humble-bees\r\n became extinct or very rare in England, the heartsease and red clover\r\n would become very rare, or wholly disappear. The number of humble-bees\r\n in any district depends in a great measure upon the number of\r\n field-mice, which destroy their combs and nests; and Colonel Newman,\r\n who has long attended to the habits of humble-bees, believes that\r\n “more than two-thirds of them are thus destroyed all over England.”\r\n Now the number of mice is largely dependent, as every one knows, on\r\n the number of cats; and Colonel Newman says, “Near villages and small\r\n towns I have found the nests of humble-bees more numerous than\r\n elsewhere, which I attribute to the number of cats that destroy the\r\n mice.” Hence it is quite credible that the presence of a feline animal\r\n in large numbers in a district might determine, through the\r\n intervention first of mice and then of bees, the frequency of certain\r\n flowers in that district!\r\n\r\nIn the case of every species, many different checks, acting at\r\ndifferent periods of life, and during different seasons or years,\r\nprobably come into play; some one check or some few being generally the\r\nmost potent, but all will concur in determining the average number, or\r\neven the existence of the species. In some cases it can be shown that\r\nwidely-different checks act on the same species in different districts.\r\nWhen we look at the plants and bushes clothing an entangled bank, we\r\nare tempted to attribute their proportional numbers and kinds to what\r\nwe call chance. But how false a view is this! Every one has heard that\r\nwhen an American forest is cut down, a very different vegetation\r\nsprings up; but it has been observed that ancient Indian ruins in the\r\nSouthern United States, which must formerly have been cleared of trees,\r\nnow display the same beautiful diversity and proportion of kinds as in\r\nthe surrounding virgin forests. What a struggle must have gone on\r\nduring long centuries between the several kinds of trees, each annually\r\nscattering its seeds by the thousand; what war between insect and\r\ninsect—between insects, snails, and other animals with birds and beasts\r\nof prey—all striving to increase, all feeding on each other, or on the\r\ntrees, their seeds and seedlings, or on the other plants which first\r\nclothed the ground and thus checked the growth of the trees. Throw up a\r\nhandful of feathers, and all fall to the ground according to definite\r\nlaws; but how simple is the problem where each shall fall compared to\r\nthat of the action and reaction of the innumerable plants and animals\r\nwhich have determined, in the course of centuries, the proportional\r\nnumbers and kinds of trees now growing on the old Indian ruins!\r\n\r\nThe dependency of one organic being on another, as of a parasite on its\r\nprey, lies generally between beings remote in the scale of nature. This\r\nis likewise sometimes the case with those which may strictly be said to\r\nstruggle with each other for existence, as in the case of locusts and\r\ngrass-feeding quadrupeds. But the struggle will almost invariably be\r\nmost severe between the individuals of the same species, for they\r\nfrequent the same districts, require the same food, and are exposed to\r\nthe same dangers. In the case of varieties of the same species, the\r\nstruggle will generally be almost equally severe, and we sometimes see\r\nthe contest soon decided: for instance, if several varieties of wheat\r\nbe sown together, and the mixed seed be resown, some of the varieties\r\nwhich best suit the soil or climate, or are naturally the most fertile,\r\nwill beat the others and so yield more seed, and will consequently in a\r\nfew years supplant the other varieties. To keep up a mixed stock of\r\neven such extremely close varieties as the variously coloured\r\nsweet-peas, they must be each year harvested separately, and the seed\r\nthen mixed in due proportion, otherwise the weaker kinds will steadily\r\ndecrease in number and disappear. So again with the varieties of sheep:\r\nit has been asserted that certain mountain-varieties will starve out\r\nother mountain-varieties, so that they cannot be kept together. The\r\nsame result has followed from keeping together different varieties of\r\nthe medicinal leech. It may even be doubted whether the varieties of\r\nany of our domestic plants or animals have so exactly the same\r\nstrength, habits, and constitution, that the original proportions of a\r\nmixed stock (crossing being prevented) could be kept up for\r\nhalf-a-dozen generations, if they were allowed to struggle together, in\r\nthe same manner as beings in a state of nature, and if the seed or\r\nyoung were not annually preserved in due proportion.\r\n\r\n_Struggle for Life most severe between Individuals and Varieties of the\r\nsame Species._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the species of the same genus usually have, though by no means\r\ninvariably, much similarity in habits and constitution, and always in\r\nstructure, the struggle will generally be more severe between them, if\r\nthey come into competition with each other, than between the species of\r\ndistinct genera. We see this in the recent extension over parts of the\r\nUnited States of one species of swallow having caused the decrease of\r\nanother species. The recent increase of the missel-thrush in parts of\r\nScotland has caused the decrease of the song-thrush. How frequently we\r\nhear of one species of rat taking the place of another species under\r\nthe most different climates! In Russia the small Asiatic cockroach has\r\neverywhere driven before it its great congener. In Australia the\r\nimported hive-bee is rapidly exterminating the small, stingless native\r\nbee. One species of charlock has been known to supplant another\r\nspecies; and so in other cases. We can dimly see why the competition\r\nshould be most severe between allied forms, which fill nearly the same\r\nplace in the economy of nature; but probably in no one case could we\r\nprecisely say why one species has been victorious over another in the\r\ngreat battle of life.\r\n\r\nA corollary of the highest importance may be deduced from the foregoing\r\nremarks, namely, that the structure of every organic being is related,\r\nin the most essential yet often hidden manner, to that of all other\r\norganic beings, with which it comes into competition for food or\r\nresidence, or from which it has to escape, or on which it preys. This\r\nis obvious in the structure of the teeth and talons of the tiger; and\r\nin that of the legs and claws of the parasite which clings to the hair\r\non the tiger’s body. But in the beautifully plumed seed of the\r\ndandelion, and in the flattened and fringed legs of the water-beetle,\r\nthe relation seems at first confined to the elements of air and water.\r\nYet the advantage of the plumed seeds no doubt stands in the closest\r\nrelation to the land being already thickly clothed with other plants;\r\nso that the seeds may be widely distributed and fall on unoccupied\r\nground. In the water-beetle, the structure of its legs, so well adapted\r\nfor diving, allows it to compete with other aquatic insects, to hunt\r\nfor its own prey, and to escape serving as prey to other animals.\r\n\r\nThe store of nutriment laid up within the seeds of many plants seems at\r\nfirst sight to have no sort of relation to other plants. But from the\r\nstrong growth of young plants produced from such seeds, as peas and\r\nbeans, when sown in the midst of long grass, it may be suspected that\r\nthe chief use of the nutriment in the seed is to favour the growth of\r\nthe seedlings, whilst struggling with other plants growing vigorously\r\nall around.\r\n\r\nLook at a plant in the midst of its range! Why does it not double or\r\nquadruple its numbers? We know that it can perfectly well withstand a\r\nlittle more heat or cold, dampness or dryness, for elsewhere it ranges\r\ninto slightly hotter or colder, damper or drier districts. In this case\r\nwe can clearly see that if we wish in imagination to give the plant the\r\npower of increasing in numbers, we should have to give it some\r\nadvantage over its competitors, or over the animals which prey on it.\r\nOn the confines of its geographical range, a change of constitution\r\nwith respect to climate would clearly be an advantage to our plant; but\r\nwe have reason to believe that only a few plants or animals range so\r\nfar, that they are destroyed exclusively by the rigour of the climate.\r\nNot until we reach the extreme confines of life, in the Arctic regions\r\nor on the borders of an utter desert, will competition cease. The land\r\nmay be extremely cold or dry, yet there will be competition between\r\nsome few species, or between the individuals of the same species, for\r\nthe warmest or dampest spots.\r\n\r\nHence we can see that when a plant or animal is placed in a new\r\ncountry, among new competitors, the conditions of its life will\r\ngenerally be changed in an essential manner, although the climate may\r\nbe exactly the same as in its former home. If its average numbers are\r\nto increase in its new home, we should have to modify it in a different\r\nway to what we should have had to do in its native country; for we\r\nshould have to give it some advantage over a different set of\r\ncompetitors or enemies.\r\n\r\nIt is good thus to try in imagination to give any one species an\r\nadvantage over another. Probably in no single instance should we know\r\nwhat to do. This ought to convince us of our ignorance on the mutual\r\nrelations of all organic beings; a conviction as necessary, as it is\r\ndifficult to acquire. All that we can do is to keep steadily in mind\r\nthat each organic being is striving to increase in a geometrical ratio;\r\nthat each, at some period of its life, during some season of the year,\r\nduring each generation, or at intervals, has to struggle for life and\r\nto suffer great destruction. When we reflect on this struggle we may\r\nconsole ourselves with the full belief that the war of nature is not\r\nincessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and\r\nthat the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nNATURAL SELECTION; OR THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural Selection—its power compared with man’s selection—its power on\r\ncharacters of trifling importance—its power at all ages and on both\r\nsexes—Sexual Selection—On the generality of intercrosses between\r\nindividuals of the same species—Circumstances favourable and\r\nunfavourable to the results of Natural Selection, namely,\r\nintercrossing, isolation, number of individuals—Slow action—Extinction\r\ncaused by Natural Selection—Divergence of Character, related to the\r\ndiversity of inhabitants of any small area and to naturalisation—Action\r\nof Natural Selection, through Divergence of Character and Extinction,\r\non the descendants from a common parent—Explains the Grouping of all\r\norganic beings—Advance in organisation—Low forms preserved—Convergence\r\nof character—Indefinite multiplication of species—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow will the struggle for existence, briefly discussed in the last\r\nchapter, act in regard to variation? Can the principle of selection,\r\nwhich we have seen is so potent in the hands of man, apply under\r\nnature? I think we shall see that it can act most efficiently. Let the\r\nendless number of slight variations and individual differences\r\noccurring in our domestic productions, and, in a lesser degree, in\r\nthose under nature, be borne in mind; as well as the strength of the\r\nhereditary tendency. Under domestication, it may truly be said that the\r\nwhole organisation becomes in some degree plastic. But the variability,\r\nwhich we almost universally meet with in our domestic productions is\r\nnot directly produced, as Hooker and Asa Gray have well remarked, by\r\nman; he can neither originate varieties nor prevent their occurrence;\r\nhe can only preserve and accumulate such as do occur. Unintentionally\r\nhe exposes organic beings to new and changing conditions of life, and\r\nvariability ensues; but similar changes of conditions might and do\r\noccur under nature. Let it also be borne in mind how infinitely complex\r\nand close-fitting are the mutual relations of all organic beings to\r\neach other and to their physical conditions of life; and consequently\r\nwhat infinitely varied diversities of structure might be of use to each\r\nbeing under changing conditions of life. Can it then be thought\r\nimprobable, seeing that variations useful to man have undoubtedly\r\noccurred, that other variations useful in some way to each being in the\r\ngreat and complex battle of life, should occur in the course of many\r\nsuccessive generations? If such do occur, can we doubt (remembering\r\nthat many more individuals are born than can possibly survive) that\r\nindividuals having any advantage, however slight, over others, would\r\nhave the best chance of surviving and procreating their kind? On the\r\nother hand, we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree\r\ninjurious would be rigidly destroyed. This preservation of favourable\r\nindividual differences and variations, and the destruction of those\r\nwhich are injurious, I have called Natural Selection, or the Survival\r\nof the Fittest. Variations neither useful nor injurious would not be\r\naffected by natural selection, and would be left either a fluctuating\r\nelement, as perhaps we see in certain polymorphic species, or would\r\nultimately become fixed, owing to the nature of the organism and the\r\nnature of the conditions.\r\n\r\nSeveral writers have misapprehended or objected to the term Natural\r\nSelection. Some have even imagined that natural selection induces\r\nvariability, whereas it implies only the preservation of such\r\nvariations as arise and are beneficial to the being under its\r\nconditions of life. No one objects to agriculturists speaking of the\r\npotent effects of man’s selection; and in this case the individual\r\ndifferences given by nature, which man for some object selects, must of\r\nnecessity first occur. Others have objected that the term selection\r\nimplies conscious choice in the animals which become modified; and it\r\nhas even been urged that, as plants have no volition, natural selection\r\nis not applicable to them! In the literal sense of the word, no doubt,\r\nnatural selection is a false term; but who ever objected to chemists\r\nspeaking of the elective affinities of the various elements?—and yet an\r\nacid cannot strictly be said to elect the base with which it in\r\npreference combines. It has been said that I speak of natural selection\r\nas an active power or Deity; but who objects to an author speaking of\r\nthe attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets? Every\r\none knows what is meant and is implied by such metaphorical\r\nexpressions; and they are almost necessary for brevity. So again it is\r\ndifficult to avoid personifying the word Nature; but I mean by nature,\r\nonly the aggregate action and product of many natural laws, and by laws\r\nthe sequence of events as ascertained by us. With a little familiarity\r\nsuch superficial objections will be forgotten.\r\n\r\nWe shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by\r\ntaking the case of a country undergoing some slight physical change,\r\nfor instance, of climate. The proportional numbers of its inhabitants\r\nwill almost immediately undergo a change, and some species will\r\nprobably become extinct. We may conclude, from what we have seen of the\r\nintimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country\r\nare bound together, that any change in the numerical proportions of the\r\ninhabitants, independently of the change of climate itself, would\r\nseriously affect the others. If the country were open on its borders,\r\nnew forms would certainly immigrate, and this would likewise seriously\r\ndisturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants. Let it be\r\nremembered how powerful the influence of a single introduced tree or\r\nmammal has been shown to be. But in the case of an island, or of a\r\ncountry partly surrounded by barriers, into which new and better\r\nadapted forms could not freely enter, we should then have places in the\r\neconomy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up if some of\r\nthe original inhabitants were in some manner modified; for, had the\r\narea been open to immigration, these same places would have been seized\r\non by intruders. In such cases, slight modifications, which in any way\r\nfavoured the individuals of any species, by better adapting them to\r\ntheir altered conditions, would tend to be preserved; and natural\r\nselection would have free scope for the work of improvement.\r\n\r\nWe have good reason to believe, as shown in the first chapter, that\r\nchanges in the conditions of life give a tendency to increased\r\nvariability; and in the foregoing cases the conditions the changed, and\r\nthis would manifestly be favourable to natural selection, by affording\r\na better chance of the occurrence of profitable variations. Unless such\r\noccur, natural selection can do nothing. Under the term of\r\n“variations,” it must never be forgotten that mere individual\r\ndifferences are included. As man can produce a great result with his\r\ndomestic animals and plants by adding up in any given direction\r\nindividual differences, so could natural selection, but far more easily\r\nfrom having incomparably longer time for action. Nor do I believe that\r\nany great physical change, as of climate, or any unusual degree of\r\nisolation, to check immigration, is necessary in order that new and\r\nunoccupied places should be left for natural selection to fill up by\r\nimproving some of the varying inhabitants. For as all the inhabitants\r\nof each country are struggling together with nicely balanced forces,\r\nextremely slight modifications in the structure or habits of one\r\nspecies would often give it an advantage over others; and still further\r\nmodifications of the same kind would often still further increase the\r\nadvantage, as long as the species continued under the same conditions\r\nof life and profited by similar means of subsistence and defence. No\r\ncountry can be named in which all the native inhabitants are now so\r\nperfectly adapted to each other and to the physical conditions under\r\nwhich they live, that none of them could be still better adapted or\r\nimproved; for in all countries, the natives have been so far conquered\r\nby naturalised productions that they have allowed some foreigners to\r\ntake firm possession of the land. And as foreigners have thus in every\r\ncountry beaten some of the natives, we may safely conclude that the\r\nnatives might have been modified with advantage, so as to have better\r\nresisted the intruders.\r\n\r\nAs man can produce, and certainly has produced, a great result by his\r\nmethodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not natural\r\nselection effect? Man can act only on external and visible characters:\r\nNature, if I may be allowed to personify the natural preservation or\r\nsurvival of the fittest, cares nothing for appearances, except in so\r\nfar as they are useful to any being. She can act on every internal\r\norgan, on every shade of constitutional difference, on the whole\r\nmachinery of life. Man selects only for his own good; Nature only for\r\nthat of the being which she tends. Every selected character is fully\r\nexercised by her, as is implied by the fact of their selection. Man\r\nkeeps the natives of many climates in the same country. He seldom\r\nexercises each selected character in some peculiar and fitting manner;\r\nhe feeds a long and a short-beaked pigeon on the same food; he does not\r\nexercise a long-backed or long-legged quadruped in any peculiar manner;\r\nhe exposes sheep with long and short wool to the same climate; does not\r\nallow the most vigorous males to struggle for the females; he does not\r\nrigidly destroy all inferior animals, but protects during each varying\r\nseason, as far as lies in his power, all his productions. He often\r\nbegins his selection by some half-monstrous form, or at least by some\r\nmodification prominent enough to catch the eye or to be plainly useful\r\nto him. Under nature, the slightest differences of structure or\r\nconstitution may well turn the nicely-balanced scale in the struggle\r\nfor life, and so be preserved. How fleeting are the wishes and efforts\r\nof man! How short his time, and consequently how poor will be his\r\nresults, compared with those accumulated by Nature during whole\r\ngeological periods! Can we wonder, then, that Nature’s productions\r\nshould be far “truer” in character than man’s productions; that they\r\nshould be infinitely better adapted to the most complex conditions of\r\nlife, and should plainly bear the stamp of far higher workmanship?\r\n\r\nIt may metaphorically be said that natural selection is daily and\r\nhourly scrutinising, throughout the world, the slightest variations;\r\nrejecting those that are bad, preserving and adding up all that are\r\ngood; silently and insensibly working, _whenever and wherever\r\nopportunity offers_, at the improvement of each organic being in\r\nrelation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life. We see\r\nnothing of these slow changes in progress, until the hand of time has\r\nmarked the long lapse of ages, and then so imperfect is our view into\r\nlong-past geological ages that we see only that the forms of life are\r\nnow different from what they formerly were.\r\n\r\nIn order that any great amount of modification should be effected in a\r\nspecies, a variety, when once formed must again, perhaps after a long\r\ninterval of time, vary or present individual differences of the same\r\nfavourable nature as before; and these must again be preserved, and so\r\nonward, step by step. Seeing that individual differences of the same\r\nkind perpetually recur, this can hardly be considered as an\r\nunwarrantable assumption. But whether it is true, we can judge only by\r\nseeing how far the hypothesis accords with and explains the general\r\nphenomena of nature. On the other hand, the ordinary belief that the\r\namount of possible variation is a strictly limited quantity, is\r\nlikewise a simple assumption.\r\n\r\nAlthough natural selection can act only through and for the good of\r\neach being, yet characters and structures, which we are apt to consider\r\nas of very trifling importance, may thus be acted on. When we see\r\nleaf-eating insects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey; the alpine\r\nptarmigan white in winter, the red-grouse the colour of heather, we\r\nmust believe that these tints are of service to these birds and insects\r\nin preserving them from danger. Grouse, if not destroyed at some period\r\nof their lives, would increase in countless numbers; they are known to\r\nsuffer largely from birds of prey; and hawks are guided by eyesight to\r\ntheir prey,—so much so that on parts of the continent persons are\r\nwarned not to keep white pigeons, as being the most liable to\r\ndestruction. Hence natural selection might be effective in giving the\r\nproper colour to each kind of grouse, and in keeping that colour, when\r\nonce acquired, true and constant. Nor ought we to think that the\r\noccasional destruction of an animal of any particular colour would\r\nproduce little effect; we should remember how essential it is in a\r\nflock of white sheep to destroy a lamb with the faintest trace of\r\nblack. We have seen how the colour of hogs, which feed on the\r\n“paint-root” in Virginia, determines whether they shall live or die. In\r\nplants, the down on the fruit and the colour of the flesh are\r\nconsidered by botanists as characters of the most trifling importance;\r\nyet we hear from an excellent horticulturist, Downing, that in the\r\nUnited States smooth-skinned fruits suffer far more from a beetle, a\r\nCurculio, than those with down; that purple plums suffer far more from\r\na certain disease than yellow plums; whereas another disease attacks\r\nyellow-fleshed peaches far more than those with other coloured flesh.\r\nIf, with all the aids of art, these slight differences make a great\r\ndifference in cultivating the several varieties, assuredly, in a state\r\nof nature, where the trees would have to struggle with other trees and\r\nwith a host of enemies, such differences would effectually settle which\r\nvariety, whether a smooth or downy, a yellow or a purple-fleshed fruit,\r\nshould succeed.\r\n\r\nIn looking at many small points of difference between species, which,\r\nas far as our ignorance permits us to judge, seem quite unimportant, we\r\nmust not forget that climate, food, &c., have no doubt produced some\r\ndirect effect. It is also necessary to bear in mind that, owing to the\r\nlaw of correlation, when one part varies and the variations are\r\naccumulated through natural selection, other modifications, often of\r\nthe most unexpected nature, will ensue.\r\n\r\nAs we see that those variations which, under domestication, appear at\r\nany particular period of life, tend to reappear in the offspring at the\r\nsame period; for instance, in the shape, size and flavour of the seeds\r\nof the many varieties of our culinary and agricultural plants; in the\r\ncaterpillar and cocoon stages of the varieties of the silkworm; in the\r\neggs of poultry, and in the colour of the down of their chickens; in\r\nthe horns of our sheep and cattle when nearly adult; so in a state of\r\nnature natural selection will be enabled to act on and modify organic\r\nbeings at any age, by the accumulation of variations profitable at that\r\nage, and by their inheritance at a corresponding age. If it profit a\r\nplant to have its seeds more and more widely disseminated by the wind,\r\nI can see no greater difficulty in this being effected through natural\r\nselection, than in the cotton-planter increasing and improving by\r\nselection the down in the pods on his cotton-trees. Natural selection\r\nmay modify and adapt the larva of an insect to a score of\r\ncontingencies, wholly different from those which concern the mature\r\ninsect; and these modifications may affect, through correlation, the\r\nstructure of the adult. So, conversely, modifications in the adult may\r\naffect the structure of the larva; but in all cases natural selection\r\nwill ensure that they shall not be injurious: for if they were so, the\r\nspecies would become extinct.\r\n\r\nNatural selection will modify the structure of the young in relation to\r\nthe parent and of the parent in relation to the young. In social\r\nanimals it will adapt the structure of each individual for the benefit\r\nof the whole community; if the community profits by the selected\r\nchange. What natural selection cannot do, is to modify the structure of\r\none species, without giving it any advantage, for the good of another\r\nspecies; and though statements to this effect may be found in works of\r\nnatural history, I cannot find one case which will bear investigation.\r\nA structure used only once in an animal’s life, if of high importance\r\nto it, might be modified to any extent by natural selection; for\r\ninstance, the great jaws possessed by certain insects, used exclusively\r\nfor opening the cocoon—or the hard tip to the beak of unhatched birds,\r\nused for breaking the eggs. It has been asserted, that of the best\r\nshort-beaked tumbler-pigeons a greater number perish in the egg than\r\nare able to get out of it; so that fanciers assist in the act of\r\nhatching. Now, if nature had to make the beak of a full-grown pigeon\r\nvery short for the bird’s own advantage, the process of modification\r\nwould be very slow, and there would be simultaneously the most rigorous\r\nselection of all the young birds within the egg, which had the most\r\npowerful and hardest beaks, for all with weak beaks would inevitably\r\nperish: or, more delicate and more easily broken shells might be\r\nselected, the thickness of the shell being known to vary like every\r\nother structure.\r\n\r\nIt may be well here to remark that with all beings there must be much\r\nfortuitous destruction, which can have little or no influence on the\r\ncourse of natural selection. For instance, a vast number of eggs or\r\nseeds are annually devoured, and these could be modified through\r\nnatural selection only if they varied in some manner which protected\r\nthem from their enemies. Yet many of these eggs or seeds would perhaps,\r\nif not destroyed, have yielded individuals better adapted to their\r\nconditions of life than any of those which happened to survive. So\r\nagain a vast number of mature animals and plants, whether or not they\r\nbe the best adapted to their conditions, must be annually destroyed by\r\naccidental causes, which would not be in the least degree mitigated by\r\ncertain changes of structure or constitution which would in other ways\r\nbe beneficial to the species. But let the destruction of the adults be\r\never so heavy, if the number which can exist in any district be not\r\nwholly kept down by such causes—or again let the destruction of eggs or\r\nseeds be so great that only a hundredth or a thousandth part are\r\ndeveloped—yet of those which do survive, the best adapted individuals,\r\nsupposing that there is any variability in a favourable direction, will\r\ntend to propagate their kind in larger numbers than the less well\r\nadapted. If the numbers be wholly kept down by the causes just\r\nindicated, as will often have been the case, natural selection will be\r\npowerless in certain beneficial directions; but this is no valid\r\nobjection to its efficiency at other times and in other ways; for we\r\nare far from having any reason to suppose that many species ever\r\nundergo modification and improvement at the same time in the same area.\r\n\r\n_Sexual Selection._\r\n\r\n\r\nInasmuch as peculiarities often appear under domestication in one sex\r\nand become hereditarily attached to that sex, so no doubt it will be\r\nunder nature. Thus it is rendered possible for the two sexes to be\r\nmodified through natural selection in relation to different habits of\r\nlife, as is sometimes the case; or for one sex to be modified in\r\nrelation to the other sex, as commonly occurs. This leads me to say a\r\nfew words on what I have called sexual selection. This form of\r\nselection depends, not on a struggle for existence in relation to other\r\norganic beings or to external conditions, but on a struggle between the\r\nindividuals of one sex, generally the males, for the possession of the\r\nother sex. The result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but\r\nfew or no offspring. Sexual selection is, therefore, less rigorous than\r\nnatural selection. Generally, the most vigorous males, those which are\r\nbest fitted for their places in nature, will leave most progeny. But in\r\nmany cases victory depends not so much on general vigour, but on having\r\nspecial weapons, confined to the male sex. A hornless stag or spurless\r\ncock would have a poor chance of leaving numerous offspring. Sexual\r\nselection, by always allowing the victor to breed, might surely give\r\nindomitable courage, length of spur, and strength to the wing to strike\r\nin the spurred leg, in nearly the same manner as does the brutal\r\ncockfighter by the careful selection of his best cocks. How low in the\r\nscale of nature the law of battle descends I know not; male alligators\r\nhave been described as fighting, bellowing, and whirling round, like\r\nIndians in a war-dance, for the possession of the females; male salmons\r\nhave been observed fighting all day long; male stag-beetles sometimes\r\nbear wounds from the huge mandibles of other males; the males of\r\ncertain hymenopterous insects have been frequently seen by that\r\ninimitable observer M. Fabre, fighting for a particular female who sits\r\nby, an apparently unconcerned beholder of the struggle, and then\r\nretires with the conqueror. The war is, perhaps, severest between the\r\nmales of polygamous animals, and these seem oftenest provided with\r\nspecial weapons. The males of carnivorous animals are already well\r\narmed; though to them and to others, special means of defence may be\r\ngiven through means of sexual selection, as the mane of the lion, and\r\nthe hooked jaw to the male salmon; for the shield may be as important\r\nfor victory as the sword or spear.\r\n\r\nAmong birds, the contest is often of a more peaceful character. All\r\nthose who have attended to the subject, believe that there is the\r\nseverest rivalry between the males of many species to attract, by\r\nsinging, the females. The rock-thrush of Guiana, birds of paradise, and\r\nsome others, congregate, and successive males display with the most\r\nelaborate care, and show off in the best manner, their gorgeous\r\nplumage; they likewise perform strange antics before the females,\r\nwhich, standing by as spectators, at last choose the most attractive\r\npartner. Those who have closely attended to birds in confinement well\r\nknow that they often take individual preferences and dislikes: thus Sir\r\nR. Heron has described how a pied peacock was eminently attractive to\r\nall his hen birds. I cannot here enter on the necessary details; but if\r\nman can in a short time give beauty and an elegant carriage to his\r\nbantams, according to his standard of beauty, I can see no good reason\r\nto doubt that female birds, by selecting, during thousands of\r\ngenerations, the most melodious or beautiful males, according to their\r\nstandard of beauty, might produce a marked effect. Some well-known\r\nlaws, with respect to the plumage of male and female birds, in\r\ncomparison with the plumage of the young, can partly be explained\r\nthrough the action of sexual selection on variations occurring at\r\ndifferent ages, and transmitted to the males alone or to both sexes at\r\ncorresponding ages; but I have not space here to enter on this subject.\r\n\r\nThus it is, as I believe, that when the males and females of any animal\r\nhave the same general habits of life, but differ in structure, colour,\r\nor ornament, such differences have been mainly caused by sexual\r\nselection: that is, by individual males having had, in successive\r\ngenerations, some slight advantage over other males, in their weapons,\r\nmeans of defence, or charms; which they have transmitted to their male\r\noffspring alone. Yet, I would not wish to attribute all sexual\r\ndifferences to this agency: for we see in our domestic animals\r\npeculiarities arising and becoming attached to the male sex, which\r\napparently have not been augmented through selection by man. The tuft\r\nof hair on the breast of the wild turkey-cock cannot be of any use, and\r\nit is doubtful whether it can be ornamental in the eyes of the female\r\nbird; indeed, had the tuft appeared under domestication it would have\r\nbeen called a monstrosity.\r\n\r\n_Illustrations of the Action of Natural Selection, or the Survival of\r\nthe Fittest._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to make it clear how, as I believe, natural selection acts, I\r\nmust beg permission to give one or two imaginary illustrations. Let us\r\ntake the case of a wolf, which preys on various animals, securing some\r\nby craft, some by strength, and some by fleetness; and let us suppose\r\nthat the fleetest prey, a deer for instance, had from any change in the\r\ncountry increased in numbers, or that other prey had decreased in\r\nnumbers, during that season of the year when the wolf was hardest\r\npressed for food. Under such circumstances the swiftest and slimmest\r\nwolves have the best chance of surviving, and so be preserved or\r\nselected, provided always that they retained strength to master their\r\nprey at this or some other period of the year, when they were compelled\r\nto prey on other animals. I can see no more reason to doubt that this\r\nwould be the result, than that man should be able to improve the\r\nfleetness of his greyhounds by careful and methodical selection, or by\r\nthat kind of unconscious selection which follows from each man trying\r\nto keep the best dogs without any thought of modifying the breed. I may\r\nadd that, according to Mr. Pierce, there are two varieties of the wolf\r\ninhabiting the Catskill Mountains, in the United States, one with a\r\nlight greyhound-like form, which pursues deer, and the other more\r\nbulky, with shorter legs, which more frequently attacks the shepherd’s\r\nflocks.\r\n\r\nEven without any change in the proportional numbers of the animals on\r\nwhich our wolf preyed, a cub might be born with an innate tendency to\r\npursue certain kinds of prey. Nor can this be thought very improbable;\r\nfor we often observe great differences in the natural tendencies of our\r\ndomestic animals; one cat, for instance, taking to catch rats, another\r\nmice; one cat, according to Mr. St. John, bringing home winged game,\r\nanother hares or rabbits, and another hunting on marshy ground and\r\nalmost nightly catching woodcocks or snipes. The tendency to catch rats\r\nrather than mice is known to be inherited. Now, if any slight innate\r\nchange of habit or of structure benefited an individual wolf, it would\r\nhave the best chance of surviving and of leaving offspring. Some of its\r\nyoung would probably inherit the same habits or structure, and by the\r\nrepetition of this process, a new variety might be formed which would\r\neither supplant or coexist with the parent-form of wolf. Or, again, the\r\nwolves inhabiting a mountainous district, and those frequenting the\r\nlowlands, would naturally be forced to hunt different prey; and from\r\nthe continued preservation of the individuals best fitted for the two\r\nsites, two varieties might slowly be formed. These varieties would\r\ncross and blend where they met; but to this subject of intercrossing we\r\nshall soon have to return. I may add, that, according to Mr. Pierce,\r\nthere are two varieties of the wolf inhabiting the Catskill Mountains\r\nin the United States, one with a light greyhound-like form, which\r\npursues deer, and the other more bulky, with shorter legs, which more\r\nfrequently attacks the shepherd’s flocks.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that in the above illustration, I speak of the\r\nslimmest individual wolves, and not of any single strongly marked\r\nvariation having been preserved. In former editions of this work I\r\nsometimes spoke as if this latter alternative had frequently occurred.\r\nI saw the great importance of individual differences, and this led me\r\nfully to discuss the results of unconscious selection by man, which\r\ndepends on the preservation of all the more or less valuable\r\nindividuals, and on the destruction of the worst. I saw, also, that the\r\npreservation in a state of nature of any occasional deviation of\r\nstructure, such as a monstrosity, would be a rare event; and that, if\r\nat first preserved, it would generally be lost by subsequent\r\nintercrossing with ordinary individuals. Nevertheless, until reading an\r\nable and valuable article in the “North British Review” (1867), I did\r\nnot appreciate how rarely single variations, whether slight or strongly\r\nmarked, could be perpetuated. The author takes the case of a pair of\r\nanimals, producing during their lifetime two hundred offspring, of\r\nwhich, from various causes of destruction, only two on an average\r\nsurvive to pro-create their kind. This is rather an extreme estimate\r\nfor most of the higher animals, but by no means so for many of the\r\nlower organisms. He then shows that if a single individual were born,\r\nwhich varied in some manner, giving it twice as good a chance of life\r\nas that of the other individuals, yet the chances would be strongly\r\nagainst its survival. Supposing it to survive and to breed, and that\r\nhalf its young inherited the favourable variation; still, as the\r\nReviewer goes onto show, the young would have only a slightly better\r\nchance of surviving and breeding; and this chance would go on\r\ndecreasing in the succeeding generations. The justice of these remarks\r\ncannot, I think, be disputed. If, for instance, a bird of some kind\r\ncould procure its food more easily by having its beak curved, and if\r\none were born with its beak strongly curved, and which consequently\r\nflourished, nevertheless there would be a very poor chance of this one\r\nindividual perpetuating its kind to the exclusion of the common form;\r\nbut there can hardly be a doubt, judging by what we see taking place\r\nunder domestication, that this result would follow from the\r\npreservation during many generations of a large number of individuals\r\nwith more or less strongly curved beaks, and from the destruction of a\r\nstill larger number with the straightest beaks.\r\n\r\nIt should not, however, be overlooked that certain rather strongly\r\nmarked variations, which no one would rank as mere individual\r\ndifferences, frequently recur owing to a similar organisation being\r\nsimilarly acted on—of which fact numerous instances could be given with\r\nour domestic productions. In such cases, if the varying individual did\r\nnot actually transmit to its offspring its newly-acquired character, it\r\nwould undoubtedly transmit to them, as long as the existing conditions\r\nremained the same, a still stronger tendency to vary in the same\r\nmanner. There can also be little doubt that the tendency to vary in the\r\nsame manner has often been so strong that all the individuals of the\r\nsame species have been similarly modified without the aid of any form\r\nof selection. Or only a third, fifth, or tenth part of the individuals\r\nmay have been thus affected, of which fact several instances could be\r\ngiven. Thus Graba estimates that about one-fifth of the guillemots in\r\nthe Faroe Islands consist of a variety so well marked, that it was\r\nformerly ranked as a distinct species under the name of Uria lacrymans.\r\nIn cases of this kind, if the variation were of a beneficial nature,\r\nthe original form would soon be supplanted by the modified form,\r\nthrough the survival of the fittest.\r\n\r\nTo the effects of intercrossing in eliminating variations of all kinds,\r\nI shall have to recur; but it may be here remarked that most animals\r\nand plants keep to their proper homes, and do not needlessly wander\r\nabout; we see this even with migratory birds, which almost always\r\nreturn to the same spot. Consequently each newly-formed variety would\r\ngenerally be at first local, as seems to be the common rule with\r\nvarieties in a state of nature; so that similarly modified individuals\r\nwould soon exist in a small body together, and would often breed\r\ntogether. If the new variety were successful in its battle for life, it\r\nwould slowly spread from a central district, competing with and\r\nconquering the unchanged individuals on the margins of an\r\never-increasing circle.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while to give another and more complex illustration of\r\nthe action of natural selection. Certain plants excrete sweet juice,\r\napparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from the\r\nsap: this is effected, for instance, by glands at the base of the\r\nstipules in some Leguminosæ, and at the backs of the leaves of the\r\ncommon laurel. This juice, though small in quantity, is greedily sought\r\nby insects; but their visits do not in any way benefit the plant. Now,\r\nlet us suppose that the juice or nectar was excreted from the inside of\r\nthe flowers of a certain number of plants of any species. Insects in\r\nseeking the nectar would get dusted with pollen, and would often\r\ntransport it from one flower to another. The flowers of two distinct\r\nindividuals of the same species would thus get crossed; and the act of\r\ncrossing, as can be fully proved, gives rise to vigorous seedlings,\r\nwhich consequently would have the best chance of flourishing and\r\nsurviving. The plants which produced flowers with the largest glands or\r\nnectaries, excreting most nectar, would oftenest be visited by insects,\r\nand would oftenest be crossed; and so in the long-run would gain the\r\nupper hand and form a local variety. The flowers, also, which had their\r\nstamens and pistils placed, in relation to the size and habits of the\r\nparticular insect which visited them, so as to favour in any degree the\r\ntransportal of the pollen, would likewise be favoured. We might have\r\ntaken the case of insects visiting flowers for the sake of collecting\r\npollen instead of nectar; and as pollen is formed for the sole purpose\r\nof fertilisation, its destruction appears to be a simple loss to the\r\nplant; yet if a little pollen were carried, at first occasionally and\r\nthen habitually, by the pollen-devouring insects from flower to flower,\r\nand a cross thus effected, although nine-tenths of the pollen were\r\ndestroyed it might still be a great gain to the plant to be thus\r\nrobbed; and the individuals which produced more and more pollen, and\r\nhad larger anthers, would be selected.\r\n\r\nWhen our plant, by the above process long continued, had been rendered\r\nhighly attractive to insects, they would, unintentionally on their\r\npart, regularly carry pollen from flower to flower; and that they do\r\nthis effectually I could easily show by many striking facts. I will\r\ngive only one, as likewise illustrating one step in the separation of\r\nthe sexes of plants. Some holly-trees bear only male flowers, which\r\nhave four stamens producing a rather small quantity of pollen, and a\r\nrudimentary pistil; other holly-trees bear only female flowers; these\r\nhave a full-sized pistil, and four stamens with shrivelled anthers, in\r\nwhich not a grain of pollen can be detected. Having found a female tree\r\nexactly sixty yards from a male tree, I put the stigmas of twenty\r\nflowers, taken from different branches, under the microscope, and on\r\nall, without exception, there were a few pollen-grains, and on some a\r\nprofusion. As the wind had set for several days from the female to the\r\nmale tree, the pollen could not thus have been carried. The weather had\r\nbeen cold and boisterous and therefore not favourable to bees,\r\nnevertheless every female flower which I examined had been effectually\r\nfertilised by the bees, which had flown from tree to tree in search of\r\nnectar. But to return to our imaginary case; as soon as the plant had\r\nbeen rendered so highly attractive to insects that pollen was regularly\r\ncarried from flower to flower, another process might commence. No\r\nnaturalist doubts the advantage of what has been called the\r\n“physiological division of labour;” hence we may believe that it would\r\nbe advantageous to a plant to produce stamens alone in one flower or on\r\none whole plant, and pistils alone in another flower or on another\r\nplant. In plants under culture and placed under new conditions of life,\r\nsometimes the male organs and sometimes the female organs become more\r\nor less impotent; now if we suppose this to occur in ever so slight a\r\ndegree under nature, then, as pollen is already carried regularly from\r\nflower to flower, and as a more complete separation of the sexes of our\r\nplant would be advantageous on the principle of the division of labour,\r\nindividuals with this tendency more and more increased, would be\r\ncontinually favoured or selected, until at last a complete separation\r\nof the sexes might be effected. It would take up too much space to show\r\nthe various steps, through dimorphism and other means, by which the\r\nseparation of the sexes in plants of various kinds is apparently now in\r\nprogress; but I may add that some of the species of holly in North\r\nAmerica are, according to Asa Gray, in an exactly intermediate\r\ncondition, or, as he expresses it, are more or less dioeciously\r\npolygamous.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the nectar-feeding insects; we may suppose the plant\r\nof which we have been slowly increasing the nectar by continued\r\nselection, to be a common plant; and that certain insects depended in\r\nmain part on its nectar for food. I could give many facts showing how\r\nanxious bees are to save time: for instance, their habit of cutting\r\nholes and sucking the nectar at the bases of certain flowers, which\r\nwith a very little more trouble they can enter by the mouth. Bearing\r\nsuch facts in mind, it may be believed that under certain circumstances\r\nindividual differences in the curvature or length of the proboscis,\r\n&c., too slight to be appreciated by us, might profit a bee or other\r\ninsect, so that certain individuals would be able to obtain their food\r\nmore quickly than others; and thus the communities to which they\r\nbelonged would flourish and throw off many swarms inheriting the same\r\npeculiarities. The tubes of the corolla of the common red or incarnate\r\nclovers (Trifolium pratense and incarnatum) do not on a hasty glance\r\nappear to differ in length; yet the hive-bee can easily suck the nectar\r\nout of the incarnate clover, but not out of the common red clover,\r\nwhich is visited by humble-bees alone; so that whole fields of the red\r\nclover offer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar to the\r\nhive-bee. That this nectar is much liked by the hive-bee is certain;\r\nfor I have repeatedly seen, but only in the autumn, many hive-bees\r\nsucking the flowers through holes bitten in the base of the tube by\r\nhumble bees. The difference in the length of the corolla in the two\r\nkinds of clover, which determines the visits of the hive-bee, must be\r\nvery trifling; for I have been assured that when red clover has been\r\nmown, the flowers of the second crop are somewhat smaller, and that\r\nthese are visited by many hive-bees. I do not know whether this\r\nstatement is accurate; nor whether another published statement can be\r\ntrusted, namely, that the Ligurian bee, which is generally considered a\r\nmere variety of the common hive-bee, and which freely crosses with it,\r\nis able to reach and suck the nectar of the red clover. Thus, in a\r\ncountry where this kind of clover abounded, it might be a great\r\nadvantage to the hive-bee to have a slightly longer or differently\r\nconstructed proboscis. On the other hand, as the fertility of this\r\nclover absolutely depends on bees visiting the flowers, if humble-bees\r\nwere to become rare in any country, it might be a great advantage to\r\nthe plant to have a shorter or more deeply divided corolla, so that the\r\nhive-bees should be enabled to suck its flowers. Thus I can understand\r\nhow a flower and a bee might slowly become, either simultaneously or\r\none after the other, modified and adapted to each other in the most\r\nperfect manner, by the continued preservation of all the individuals\r\nwhich presented slight deviations of structure mutually favourable to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection, exemplified in\r\nthe above imaginary instances, is open to the same objections which\r\nwere first urged against Sir Charles Lyell’s noble views on “the modern\r\nchanges of the earth, as illustrative of geology;” but we now seldom\r\nhear the agencies which we see still at work, spoken of as trifling and\r\ninsignificant, when used in explaining the excavation of the deepest\r\nvalleys or the formation of long lines of inland cliffs. Natural\r\nselection acts only by the preservation and accumulation of small\r\ninherited modifications, each profitable to the preserved being; and as\r\nmodern geology has almost banished such views as the excavation of a\r\ngreat valley by a single diluvial wave, so will natural selection\r\nbanish the belief of the continued creation of new organic beings, or\r\nof any great and sudden modification in their structure.\r\n\r\n_On the Intercrossing of Individuals._\r\n\r\n\r\nI must here introduce a short digression. In the case of animals and\r\nplants with separated sexes, it is of course obvious that two\r\nindividuals must always (with the exception of the curious and not well\r\nunderstood cases of parthenogenesis) unite for each birth; but in the\r\ncase of hermaphrodites this is far from obvious. Nevertheless there is\r\nreason to believe that with all hermaphrodites two individuals, either\r\noccasionally or habitually, concur for the reproduction of their kind.\r\nThis view was long ago doubtfully suggested by Sprengel, Knight and\r\nKölreuter. We shall presently see its importance; but I must here treat\r\nthe subject with extreme brevity, though I have the materials prepared\r\nfor an ample discussion. All vertebrate animals, all insects and some\r\nother large groups of animals, pair for each birth. Modern research has\r\nmuch diminished the number of supposed hermaphrodites and of real\r\nhermaphrodites a large number pair; that is, two individuals regularly\r\nunite for reproduction, which is all that concerns us. But still there\r\nare many hermaphrodite animals which certainly do not habitually pair,\r\nand a vast majority of plants are hermaphrodites. What reason, it may\r\nbe asked, is there for supposing in these cases that two individuals\r\never concur in reproduction? As it is impossible here to enter on\r\ndetails, I must trust to some general considerations alone.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I have collected so large a body of facts, and made\r\nso many experiments, showing, in accordance with the almost universal\r\nbelief of breeders, that with animals and plants a cross between\r\ndifferent varieties, or between individuals of the same variety but of\r\nanother strain, gives vigour and fertility to the offspring; and on the\r\nother hand, that _close_ interbreeding diminishes vigour and fertility;\r\nthat these facts alone incline me to believe that it is a general law\r\nof nature that no organic being fertilises itself for a perpetuity of\r\ngenerations; but that a cross with another individual is\r\noccasionally—perhaps at long intervals of time—indispensable.\r\n\r\nOn the belief that this is a law of nature, we can, I think, understand\r\nseveral large classes of facts, such as the following, which on any\r\nother view are inexplicable. Every hybridizer knows how unfavourable\r\nexposure to wet is to the fertilisation of a flower, yet what a\r\nmultitude of flowers have their anthers and stigmas fully exposed to\r\nthe weather! If an occasional cross be indispensable, notwithstanding\r\nthat the plant’s own anthers and pistil stand so near each other as\r\nalmost to ensure self-fertilisation, the fullest freedom for the\r\nentrance of pollen from another individual will explain the above state\r\nof exposure of the organs. Many flowers, on the other hand, have their\r\norgans of fructification closely enclosed, as in the great\r\npapilionaceous or pea-family; but these almost invariably present\r\nbeautiful and curious adaptations in relation to the visits of insects.\r\nSo necessary are the visits of bees to many papilionaceous flowers,\r\nthat their fertility is greatly diminished if these visits be\r\nprevented. Now, it is scarcely possible for insects to fly from flower\r\nto flower, and not to carry pollen from one to the other, to the great\r\ngood of the plant. Insects act like a camel-hair pencil, and it is\r\nsufficient, to ensure fertilisation, just to touch with the same brush\r\nthe anthers of one flower and then the stigma of another; but it must\r\nnot be supposed that bees would thus produce a multitude of hybrids\r\nbetween distinct species; for if a plant’s own pollen and that from\r\nanother species are placed on the same stigma, the former is so\r\nprepotent that it invariably and completely destroys, as has been shown\r\nby Gärtner, the influence of the foreign pollen.\r\n\r\nWhen the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil, or\r\nslowly move one after the other towards it, the contrivance seems\r\nadapted solely to ensure self-fertilisation; and no doubt it is useful\r\nfor this end: but the agency of insects is often required to cause the\r\nstamens to spring forward, as Kölreuter has shown to be the case with\r\nthe barberry; and in this very genus, which seems to have a special\r\ncontrivance for self-fertilisation, it is well known that, if\r\nclosely-allied forms or varieties are planted near each other, it is\r\nhardly possible to raise pure seedlings, so largely do they naturally\r\ncross. In numerous other cases, far from self-fertilisation being\r\nfavoured, there are special contrivances which effectually prevent the\r\nstigma receiving pollen from its own flower, as I could show from the\r\nworks of Sprengel and others, as well as from my own observations: for\r\ninstance, in Lobelia fulgens, there is a really beautiful and elaborate\r\ncontrivance by which all the infinitely numerous pollen-granules are\r\nswept out of the conjoined anthers of each flower, before the stigma of\r\nthat individual flower is ready to receive them; and as this flower is\r\nnever visited, at least in my garden, by insects, it never sets a seed,\r\nthough by placing pollen from one flower on the stigma of another, I\r\nraise plenty of seedlings. Another species of Lobelia, which is visited\r\nby bees, seeds freely in my garden. In very many other cases, though\r\nthere is no special mechanical contrivance to prevent the stigma\r\nreceiving pollen from the same flower, yet, as Sprengel, and more\r\nrecently Hildebrand and others have shown, and as I can confirm, either\r\nthe anthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilisation, or the\r\nstigma is ready before the pollen of that flower is ready, so that\r\nthese so-named dichogamous plants have in fact separated sexes, and\r\nmust habitually be crossed. So it is with the reciprocally dimorphic\r\nand trimorphic plants previously alluded to. How strange are these\r\nfacts! How strange that the pollen and stigmatic surface of the same\r\nflower, though placed so close together, as if for the very purpose of\r\nself-fertilisation, should be in so many cases mutually useless to each\r\nother! How simply are these facts explained on the view of an\r\noccasional cross with a distinct individual being advantageous or\r\nindispensable!\r\n\r\nIf several varieties of the cabbage, radish, onion, and of some other\r\nplants, be allowed to seed near each other, a large majority of the\r\nseedlings thus raised turn out, as I found, mongrels: for instance, I\r\nraised 233 seedling cabbages from some plants of different varieties\r\ngrowing near each other, and of these only 78 were true to their kind,\r\nand some even of these were not perfectly true. Yet the pistil of each\r\ncabbage-flower is surrounded not only by its own six stamens but by\r\nthose of the many other flowers on the same plant; and the pollen of\r\neach flower readily gets on its stigma without insect agency; for I\r\nhave found that plants carefully protected from insects produce the\r\nfull number of pods. How, then, comes it that such a vast number of the\r\nseedlings are mongrelized? It must arise from the pollen of a distinct\r\n_variety_ having a prepotent effect over the flower’s own pollen; and\r\nthat this is part of the general law of good being derived from the\r\nintercrossing of distinct individuals of the same species. When\r\ndistinct _species_ are crossed the case is reversed, for a plant’s own\r\npollen is always prepotent over foreign pollen; but to this subject we\r\nshall return in a future chapter.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a large tree covered with innumerable flowers, it may be\r\nobjected that pollen could seldom be carried from tree to tree, and at\r\nmost only from flower to flower on the same tree; and flowers on the\r\nsame tree can be considered as distinct individuals only in a limited\r\nsense. I believe this objection to be valid, but that nature has\r\nlargely provided against it by giving to trees a strong tendency to\r\nbear flowers with separated sexes. When the sexes are separated,\r\nalthough the male and female flowers may be produced on the same tree,\r\npollen must be regularly carried from flower to flower; and this will\r\ngive a better chance of pollen being occasionally carried from tree to\r\ntree. That trees belonging to all orders have their sexes more often\r\nseparated than other plants, I find to be the case in this country; and\r\nat my request Dr. Hooker tabulated the trees of New Zealand, and Dr.\r\nAsa Gray those of the United States, and the result was as I\r\nanticipated. On the other hand, Dr. Hooker informs me that the rule\r\ndoes not hold good in Australia: but if most of the Australian trees\r\nare dichogamous, the same result would follow as if they bore flowers\r\nwith separated sexes. I have made these few remarks on trees simply to\r\ncall attention to the subject.\r\n\r\nTurning for a brief space to animals: various terrestrial species are\r\nhermaphrodites, such as the land-mollusca and earth-worms; but these\r\nall pair. As yet I have not found a single terrestrial animal which can\r\nfertilise itself. This remarkable fact, which offers so strong a\r\ncontrast with terrestrial plants, is intelligible on the view of an\r\noccasional cross being indispensable; for owing to the nature of the\r\nfertilising element there are no means, analogous to the action of\r\ninsects and of the wind with plants, by which an occasional cross could\r\nbe effected with terrestrial animals without the concurrence of two\r\nindividuals. Of aquatic animals, there are many self-fertilising\r\nhermaphrodites; but here the currents of water offer an obvious means\r\nfor an occasional cross. As in the case of flowers, I have as yet\r\nfailed, after consultation with one of the highest authorities, namely,\r\nProfessor Huxley, to discover a single hermaphrodite animal with the\r\norgans of reproduction so perfectly enclosed that access from without,\r\nand the occasional influence of a distinct individual, can be shown to\r\nbe physically impossible. Cirripedes long appeared to me to present,\r\nunder this point of view, a case of great difficulty; but I have been\r\nenabled, by a fortunate chance, to prove that two individuals, though\r\nboth are self-fertilising hermaphrodites, do sometimes cross.\r\n\r\nIt must have struck most naturalists as a strange anomaly that, both\r\nwith animals and plants, some species of the same family and even of\r\nthe same genus, though agreeing closely with each other in their whole\r\norganisation, are hermaphrodites, and some unisexual. But if, in fact,\r\nall hermaphrodites do occasionally intercross, the difference between\r\nthem and unisexual species is, as far as function is concerned, very\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nFrom these several considerations and from the many special facts which\r\nI have collected, but which I am unable here to give, it appears that\r\nwith animals and plants an occasional intercross between distinct\r\nindividuals is a very general, if not universal, law of nature.\r\n\r\n_Circumstances favourable for the production of new forms through\r\nNatural Selection._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an extremely intricate subject. A great amount of variability,\r\nunder which term individual differences are always included, will\r\nevidently be favourable. A large number of individuals, by giving a\r\nbetter chance within any given period for the appearance of profitable\r\nvariations, will compensate for a lesser amount of variability in each\r\nindividual, and is, I believe, a highly important element of success.\r\nThough nature grants long periods of time for the work of natural\r\nselection, she does not grant an indefinite period; for as all organic\r\nbeings are striving to seize on each place in the economy of nature, if\r\nany one species does not become modified and improved in a\r\ncorresponding degree with its competitors it will be exterminated.\r\nUnless favourable variations be inherited by some at least of the\r\noffspring, nothing can be effected by natural selection. The tendency\r\nto reversion may often check or prevent the work; but as this tendency\r\nhas not prevented man from forming by selection numerous domestic\r\nraces, why should it prevail against natural selection?\r\n\r\nIn the case of methodical selection, a breeder selects for some\r\ndefinite object, and if the individuals be allowed freely to\r\nintercross, his work will completely fail. But when many men, without\r\nintending to alter the breed, have a nearly common standard of\r\nperfection, and all try to procure and breed from the best animals,\r\nimprovement surely but slowly follows from this unconscious process of\r\nselection, notwithstanding that there is no separation of selected\r\nindividuals. Thus it will be under nature; for within a confined area,\r\nwith some place in the natural polity not perfectly occupied, all the\r\nindividuals varying in the right direction, though in different\r\ndegrees, will tend to be preserved. But if the area be large, its\r\nseveral districts will almost certainly present different conditions of\r\nlife; and then, if the same species undergoes modification in different\r\ndistricts, the newly formed varieties will intercross on the confines\r\nof each. But we shall see in the sixth chapter that intermediate\r\nvarieties, inhabiting intermediate districts, will in the long run\r\ngenerally be supplanted by one of the adjoining varieties.\r\nIntercrossing will chiefly affect those animals which unite for each\r\nbirth and wander much, and which do not breed at a very quick rate.\r\nHence with animals of this nature, for instance birds, varieties will\r\ngenerally be confined to separated countries; and this I find to be the\r\ncase. With hermaphrodite organisms which cross only occasionally, and\r\nlikewise with animals which unite for each birth, but which wander\r\nlittle and can increase at a rapid rate, a new and improved variety\r\nmight be quickly formed on any one spot, and might there maintain\r\nitself in a body and afterward spread, so that the individuals of the\r\nnew variety would chiefly cross together. On this principle nurserymen\r\nalways prefer saving seed from a large body of plants, as the chance of\r\nintercrossing is thus lessened.\r\n\r\nEven with animals which unite for each birth, and which do not\r\npropagate rapidly, we must not assume that free intercrossing would\r\nalways eliminate the effects of natural selection; for I can bring\r\nforward a considerable body of facts showing that within the same area\r\ntwo varieties of the same animal may long remain distinct, from\r\nhaunting different stations, from breeding at slightly different\r\nseasons, or from the individuals of each variety preferring to pair\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIntercrossing plays a very important part in nature by keeping the\r\nindividuals of the same species, or of the same variety, true and\r\nuniform in character. It will obviously thus act far more efficiently\r\nwith those animals which unite for each birth; but, as already stated,\r\nwe have reason to believe that occasional intercrosses take place with\r\nall animals and plants. Even if these take place only at long intervals\r\nof time, the young thus produced will gain so much in vigour and\r\nfertility over the offspring from long-continued self-fertilisation,\r\nthat they will have a better chance of surviving and propagating their\r\nkind; and thus in the long run the influence of crosses, even at rare\r\nintervals, will be great. With respect to organic beings extremely low\r\nin the scale, which do not propagate sexually, nor conjugate, and which\r\ncannot possibly intercross, uniformity of character can be retained by\r\nthem under the same conditions of life, only through the principle of\r\ninheritance, and through natural selection which will destroy any\r\nindividuals departing from the proper type. If the conditions of life\r\nchange and the form undergoes modification, uniformity of character can\r\nbe given to the modified offspring, solely by natural selection\r\npreserving similar favourable variations.\r\n\r\nIsolation also is an important element in the modification of species\r\nthrough natural selection. In a confined or isolated area, if not very\r\nlarge, the organic and inorganic conditions of life will generally be\r\nalmost uniform; so that natural selection will tend to modify all the\r\nvarying individuals of the same species in the same manner.\r\nIntercrossing with the inhabitants of the surrounding districts, will\r\nalso be thus prevented. Moritz Wagner has lately published an\r\ninteresting essay on this subject, and has shown that the service\r\nrendered by isolation in preventing crosses between newly-formed\r\nvarieties is probably greater even than I supposed. But from reasons\r\nalready assigned I can by no means agree with this naturalist, that\r\nmigration and isolation are necessary elements for the formation of new\r\nspecies. The importance of isolation is likewise great in preventing,\r\nafter any physical change in the conditions, such as of climate,\r\nelevation of the land, &c., the immigration of better adapted\r\norganisms; and thus new places in the natural economy of the district\r\nwill be left open to be filled up by the modification of the old\r\ninhabitants. Lastly, isolation will give time for a new variety to be\r\nimproved at a slow rate; and this may sometimes be of much importance.\r\nIf, however, an isolated area be very small, either from being\r\nsurrounded by barriers, or from having very peculiar physical\r\nconditions, the total number of the inhabitants will be small; and this\r\nwill retard the production of new species through natural selection, by\r\ndecreasing the chances of favourable variations arising.\r\n\r\nThe mere lapse of time by itself does nothing, either for or against\r\nnatural selection. I state this because it has been erroneously\r\nasserted that the element of time has been assumed by me to play an\r\nall-important part in modifying species, as if all the forms of life\r\nwere necessarily undergoing change through some innate law. Lapse of\r\ntime is only so far important, and its importance in this respect is\r\ngreat, that it gives a better chance of beneficial variations arising\r\nand of their being selected, accumulated, and fixed. It likewise tends\r\nto increase the direct action of the physical conditions of life, in\r\nrelation to the constitution of each organism.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to nature to test the truth of these remarks, and look at\r\nany small isolated area, such as an oceanic island, although the number\r\nof the species inhabiting it is small, as we shall see in our chapter\r\non Geographical Distribution; yet of these species a very large\r\nproportion are endemic,—that is, have been produced there and nowhere\r\nelse in the world. Hence an oceanic island at first sight seems to have\r\nbeen highly favourable for the production of new species. But we may\r\nthus deceive ourselves, for to ascertain whether a small isolated area,\r\nor a large open area like a continent, has been most favourable for the\r\nproduction of new organic forms, we ought to make the comparison within\r\nequal times; and this we are incapable of doing.\r\n\r\nAlthough isolation is of great importance in the production of new\r\nspecies, on the whole I am inclined to believe that largeness of area\r\nis still more important, especially for the production of species which\r\nshall prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of spreading\r\nwidely. Throughout a great and open area, not only will there be a\r\nbetter chance of favourable variations, arising from the large number\r\nof individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions\r\nof life are much more complex from the large number of already existing\r\nspecies; and if some of these many species become modified and\r\nimproved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or\r\nthey will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been\r\nmuch improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous\r\narea, and will thus come into competition with many other forms.\r\nMoreover, great areas, though now continuous, will often, owing to\r\nformer oscillations of level, have existed in a broken condition, so\r\nthat the good effects of isolation will generally, to a certain extent,\r\nhave concurred. Finally, I conclude that, although small isolated areas\r\nhave been in some respects highly favourable for the production of new\r\nspecies, yet that the course of modification will generally have been\r\nmore rapid on large areas; and what is more important, that the new\r\nforms produced on large areas, which already have been victorious over\r\nmany competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, and will\r\ngive rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species. They\r\nwill thus play a more important part in the changing history of the\r\norganic world.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this view, we can, perhaps, understand some facts\r\nwhich will be again alluded to in our chapter on Geographical\r\nDistribution; for instance, the fact of the productions of the smaller\r\ncontinent of Australia now yielding before those of the larger\r\nEuropæo-Asiatic area. Thus, also, it is that continental productions\r\nhave everywhere become so largely naturalised on islands. On a small\r\nisland, the race for life will have been less severe, and there will\r\nhave been less modification and less extermination. Hence, we can\r\nunderstand how it is that the flora of Madeira, according to Oswald\r\nHeer, resembles to a certain extent the extinct tertiary flora of\r\nEurope. All fresh water basins, taken together, make a small area\r\ncompared with that of the sea or of the land. Consequently, the\r\ncompetition between fresh water productions will have been less severe\r\nthan elsewhere; new forms will have been more slowly produced, and old\r\nforms more slowly exterminated. And it is in fresh water basins that we\r\nfind seven genera of Ganoid fishes, remnants of a once preponderant\r\norder: and in fresh water we find some of the most anomalous forms now\r\nknown in the world, as the Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren, which, like\r\nfossils, connect to a certain extent orders at present widely separated\r\nin the natural scale. These anomalous forms may be called living\r\nfossils; they have endured to the present day, from having inhabited a\r\nconfined area, and from having been exposed to less varied, and\r\ntherefore less severe, competition.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits, the\r\ncircumstances favourable and unfavourable for the production of new\r\nspecies through natural selection. I conclude that for terrestrial\r\nproductions a large continental area, which has undergone many\r\noscillations of level, will have been the most favourable for the\r\nproduction of many new forms of life, fitted to endure for a long time\r\nand to spread widely. While the area existed as a continent the\r\ninhabitants will have been numerous in individuals and kinds, and will\r\nhave been subjected to severe competition. When converted by subsidence\r\ninto large separate islands there will still have existed many\r\nindividuals of the same species on each island: intercrossing on the\r\nconfines of the range of each new species will have been checked: after\r\nphysical changes of any kind immigration will have been prevented, so\r\nthat new places in the polity of each island will have had to be filled\r\nup by the modification of the old inhabitants; and time will have been\r\nallowed for the varieties in each to become well modified and\r\nperfected. When, by renewed elevation, the islands were reconverted\r\ninto a continental area, there will again have been very severe\r\ncompetition; the most favoured or improved varieties will have been\r\nenabled to spread; there will have been much extinction of the less\r\nimproved forms, and the relative proportional numbers of the various\r\ninhabitants of the reunited continent will again have been changed; and\r\nagain there will have been a fair field for natural selection to\r\nimprove still further the inhabitants, and thus to produce new species.\r\n\r\nThat natural selection generally act with extreme slowness I fully\r\nadmit. It can act only when there are places in the natural polity of a\r\ndistrict which can be better occupied by the modification of some of\r\nits existing inhabitants. The occurrence of such places will often\r\ndepend on physical changes, which generally take place very slowly, and\r\non the immigration of better adapted forms being prevented. As some few\r\nof the old inhabitants become modified the mutual relations of others\r\nwill often be disturbed; and this will create new places, ready to be\r\nfilled up by better adapted forms; but all this will take place very\r\nslowly. Although all the individuals of the same species differ in some\r\nslight degree from each other, it would often be long before\r\ndifferences of the right nature in various parts of the organisation\r\nmight occur. The result would often be greatly retarded by free\r\nintercrossing. Many will exclaim that these several causes are amply\r\nsufficient to neutralise the power of natural selection. I do not\r\nbelieve so. But I do believe that natural selection will generally act\r\nvery slowly, only at long intervals of time, and only on a few of the\r\ninhabitants of the same region. I further believe that these slow,\r\nintermittent results accord well with what geology tells us of the rate\r\nand manner at which the inhabitants of the world have changed.\r\n\r\nSlow though the process of selection may be, if feeble man can do much\r\nby artificial selection, I can see no limit to the amount of change, to\r\nthe beauty and complexity of the coadaptations between all organic\r\nbeings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life,\r\nwhich may have been effected in the long course of time through\r\nnature’s power of selection, that is by the survival of the fittest.\r\n\r\n_Extinction caused by Natural Selection._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis subject will be more fully discussed in our chapter on Geology;\r\nbut it must here be alluded to from being intimately connected with\r\nnatural selection. Natural selection acts solely through the\r\npreservation of variations in some way advantageous, which consequently\r\nendure. Owing to the high geometrical rate of increase of all organic\r\nbeings, each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, and it\r\nfollows from this, that as the favoured forms increase in number, so,\r\ngenerally, will the less favoured decrease and become rare. Rarity, as\r\ngeology tells us, is the precursor to extinction. We can see that any\r\nform which is represented by few individuals will run a good chance of\r\nutter extinction, during great fluctuations in the nature or the\r\nseasons, or from a temporary increase in the number of its enemies. But\r\nwe may go further than this; for as new forms are produced, unless we\r\nadmit that specific forms can go on indefinitely increasing in number,\r\nmany old forms must become extinct. That the number of specific forms\r\nhas not indefinitely increased, geology plainly tells us; and we shall\r\npresently attempt to show why it is that the number of species\r\nthroughout the world has not become immeasurably great.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the species which are most numerous in individuals\r\nhave the best chance of producing favourable variations within any\r\ngiven period. We have evidence of this, in the facts stated in the\r\nsecond chapter, showing that it is the common and diffused or dominant\r\nspecies which offer the greatest number of recorded varieties. Hence,\r\nrare species will be less quickly modified or improved within any given\r\nperiod; they will consequently be beaten in the race for life by the\r\nmodified and improved descendants of the commoner species.\r\n\r\nFrom these several considerations I think it inevitably follows, that\r\nas new species in the course of time are formed through natural\r\nselection, others will become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct. The\r\nforms which stand in closest competition with those undergoing\r\nmodification and improvement, will naturally suffer most. And we have\r\nseen in the chapter on the Struggle for Existence that it is the most\r\nclosely-allied forms,—varieties of the same species, and species of the\r\nsame genus or related genera,—which, from having nearly the same\r\nstructure, constitution and habits, generally come into the severest\r\ncompetition with each other. Consequently, each new variety or species,\r\nduring the progress of its formation, will generally press hardest on\r\nits nearest kindred, and tend to exterminate them. We see the same\r\nprocess of extermination among our domesticated productions, through\r\nthe selection of improved forms by man. Many curious instances could be\r\ngiven showing how quickly new breeds of cattle, sheep and other\r\nanimals, and varieties of flowers, take the place of older and inferior\r\nkinds. In Yorkshire, it is historically known that the ancient black\r\ncattle were displaced by the long-horns, and that these “were swept\r\naway by the short-horns” (I quote the words of an agricultural writer)\r\n“as if by some murderous pestilence.”\r\n\r\n_Divergence of Character._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principle, which I have designated by this term, is of high\r\nimportance, and explains, as I believe, several important facts. In the\r\nfirst place, varieties, even strongly-marked ones, though having\r\nsomewhat of the character of species—as is shown by the hopeless doubts\r\nin many cases how to rank them—yet certainly differ far less from each\r\nother than do good and distinct species. Nevertheless according to my\r\nview, varieties are species in the process of formation, or are, as I\r\nhave called them, incipient species. How, then, does the lesser\r\ndifference between varieties become augmented into the greater\r\ndifference between species? That this does habitually happen, we must\r\ninfer from most of the innumerable species throughout nature presenting\r\nwell-marked differences; whereas varieties, the supposed prototypes and\r\nparents of future well-marked species, present slight and ill-defined\r\ndifferences. Mere chance, as we may call it, might cause one variety to\r\ndiffer in some character from its parents, and the offspring of this\r\nvariety again to differ from its parent in the very same character and\r\nin a greater degree; but this alone would never account for so habitual\r\nand large a degree of difference as that between the species of the\r\nsame genus.\r\n\r\nAs has always been my practice, I have sought light on this head from\r\nour domestic productions. We shall here find something analogous. It\r\nwill be admitted that the production of races so different as\r\nshort-horn and Hereford cattle, race and cart horses, the several\r\nbreeds of pigeons, &c., could never have been effected by the mere\r\nchance accumulation of similar variations during many successive\r\ngenerations. In practice, a fancier is, for instance, struck by a\r\npigeon having a slightly shorter beak; another fancier is struck by a\r\npigeon having a rather longer beak; and on the acknowledged principle\r\nthat “fanciers do not and will not admire a medium standard, but like\r\nextremes,” they both go on (as has actually occurred with the\r\nsub-breeds of the tumbler-pigeon) choosing and breeding from birds with\r\nlonger and longer beaks, or with shorter and shorter beaks. Again, we\r\nmay suppose that at an early period of history, the men of one nation\r\nor district required swifter horses, while those of another required\r\nstronger and bulkier horses. The early differences would be very\r\nslight; but, in the course of time, from the continued selection of\r\nswifter horses in the one case, and of stronger ones in the other, the\r\ndifferences would become greater, and would be noted as forming two\r\nsub-breeds. Ultimately after the lapse of centuries, these sub-breeds\r\nwould become converted into two well-established and distinct breeds.\r\nAs the differences became greater, the inferior animals with\r\nintermediate characters, being neither very swift nor very strong,\r\nwould not have been used for breeding, and will thus have tended to\r\ndisappear. Here, then, we see in man’s productions the action of what\r\nmay be called the principle of divergence, causing differences, at\r\nfirst barely appreciable, steadily to increase, and the breeds to\r\ndiverge in character, both from each other and from their common\r\nparent.\r\n\r\nBut how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in nature?\r\nI believe it can and does apply most efficiently (though it was a long\r\ntime before I saw how), from the simple circumstance that the more\r\ndiversified the descendants from any one species become in structure,\r\nconstitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to\r\nseize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature,\r\nand so be enabled to increase in numbers.\r\n\r\nWe can clearly discern this in the case of animals with simple habits.\r\nTake the case of a carnivorous quadruped, of which the number that can\r\nbe supported in any country has long ago arrived at its full average.\r\nIf its natural power of increase be allowed to act, it can succeed in\r\nincreasing (the country not undergoing any change in conditions) only\r\nby its varying descendants seizing on places at present occupied by\r\nother animals: some of them, for instance, being enabled to feed on new\r\nkinds of prey, either dead or alive; some inhabiting new stations,\r\nclimbing trees, frequenting water, and some perhaps becoming less\r\ncarnivorous. The more diversified in habits and structure the\r\ndescendants of our carnivorous animals become, the more places they\r\nwill be enabled to occupy. What applies to one animal will apply\r\nthroughout all time to all animals—that is, if they vary—for otherwise\r\nnatural selection can effect nothing. So it will be with plants. It has\r\nbeen experimentally proved, that if a plot of ground be sown with one\r\nspecies of grass, and a similar plot be sown with several distinct\r\ngenera of grasses, a greater number of plants and a greater weight of\r\ndry herbage can be raised in the latter than in the former case. The\r\nsame has been found to hold good when one variety and several mixed\r\nvarieties of wheat have been sown on equal spaces of ground. Hence, if\r\nany one species of grass were to go on varying, and the varieties were\r\ncontinually selected which differed from each other in the same manner,\r\nthough in a very slight degree, as do the distinct species and genera\r\nof grasses, a greater number of individual plants of this species,\r\nincluding its modified descendants, would succeed in living on the same\r\npiece of ground. And we know that each species and each variety of\r\ngrass is annually sowing almost countless seeds; and is thus striving,\r\nas it may be said, to the utmost to increase in number. Consequently,\r\nin the course of many thousand generations, the most distinct varieties\r\nof any one species of grass would have the best chance of succeeding\r\nand of increasing in numbers, and thus of supplanting the less distinct\r\nvarieties; and varieties, when rendered very distinct from each other,\r\ntake the rank of species.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the principle that the greatest amount of life can be\r\nsupported by great diversification of structure, is seen under many\r\nnatural circumstances. In an extremely small area, especially if freely\r\nopen to immigration, and where the contest between individual and\r\nindividual must be very severe, we always find great diversity in its\r\ninhabitants. For instance, I found that a piece of turf, three feet by\r\nfour in size, which had been exposed for many years to exactly the same\r\nconditions, supported twenty species of plants, and these belonged to\r\neighteen genera and to eight orders, which shows how much these plants\r\ndiffered from each other. So it is with the plants and insects on small\r\nand uniform islets: also in small ponds of fresh water. Farmers find\r\nthat they can raise more food by a rotation of plants belonging to the\r\nmost different orders: nature follows what may be called a simultaneous\r\nrotation. Most of the animals and plants which live close round any\r\nsmall piece of ground, could live on it (supposing its nature not to be\r\nin any way peculiar), and may be said to be striving to the utmost to\r\nlive there; but, it is seen, that where they come into the closest\r\ncompetition, the advantages of diversification of structure, with the\r\naccompanying differences of habit and constitution, determine that the\r\ninhabitants, which thus jostle each other most closely, shall, as a\r\ngeneral rule, belong to what we call different genera and orders.\r\n\r\nThe same principle is seen in the naturalisation of plants through\r\nman’s agency in foreign lands. It might have been expected that the\r\nplants which would succeed in becoming naturalised in any land would\r\ngenerally have been closely allied to the indigenes; for these are\r\ncommonly looked at as specially created and adapted for their own\r\ncountry. It might also, perhaps, have been expected that naturalised\r\nplants would have belonged to a few groups more especially adapted to\r\ncertain stations in their new homes. But the case is very different;\r\nand Alph. de Candolle has well remarked, in his great and admirable\r\nwork, that floras gain by naturalisation, proportionally with the\r\nnumber of the native genera and species, far more in new genera than in\r\nnew species. To give a single instance: in the last edition of Dr. Asa\r\nGray’s “Manual of the Flora of the Northern United States,” 260\r\nnaturalised plants are enumerated, and these belong to 162 genera. We\r\nthus see that these naturalised plants are of a highly diversified\r\nnature. They differ, moreover, to a large extent, from the indigenes,\r\nfor out of the 162 naturalised genera, no less than 100 genera are not\r\nthere indigenous, and thus a large proportional addition is made to the\r\ngenera now living in the United States.\r\n\r\nBy considering the nature of the plants or animals which have in any\r\ncountry struggled successfully with the indigenes, and have there\r\nbecome naturalised, we may gain some crude idea in what manner some of\r\nthe natives would have had to be modified in order to gain an advantage\r\nover their compatriots; and we may at least infer that diversification\r\nof structure, amounting to new generic differences, would be profitable\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of diversification of structure in the inhabitants of the\r\nsame region is, in fact, the same as that of the physiological division\r\nof labour in the organs of the same individual body—a subject so well\r\nelucidated by Milne Edwards. No physiologist doubts that a stomach by\r\nbeing adapted to digest vegetable matter alone, or flesh alone, draws\r\nmost nutriment from these substances. So in the general economy of any\r\nland, the more widely and perfectly the animals and plants are\r\ndiversified for different habits of life, so will a greater number of\r\nindividuals be capable of there supporting themselves. A set of\r\nanimals, with their organisation but little diversified, could hardly\r\ncompete with a set more perfectly diversified in structure. It may be\r\ndoubted, for instance, whether the Australian marsupials, which are\r\ndivided into groups differing but little from each other, and feebly\r\nrepresenting, as Mr. Waterhouse and others have remarked, our\r\ncarnivorous, ruminant, and rodent mammals, could successfully compete\r\nwith these well-developed orders. In the Australian mammals, we see the\r\nprocess of diversification in an early and incomplete stage of\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n_The Probable Effects of the Action of Natural Selection through\r\nDivergence of Character and Extinction, on the Descendants of a Common\r\nAncestor._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the foregoing discussion, which has been much compressed, we may\r\nassume that the modified descendants of any one species will succeed so\r\nmuch the better as they become more diversified in structure, and are\r\nthus enabled to encroach on places occupied by other beings. Now let us\r\nsee how this principle of benefit being derived from divergence of\r\ncharacter, combined with the principles of natural selection and of\r\nextinction, tends to act.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding this rather\r\nperplexing subject. Let A to L represent the species of a genus large\r\nin its own country; these species are supposed to resemble each other\r\nin unequal degrees, as is so generally the case in nature, and as is\r\nrepresented in the diagram by the letters standing at unequal\r\ndistances. I have said a large genus, because as we saw in the second\r\nchapter, on an average more species vary in large genera than in small\r\ngenera; and the varying species of the large genera present a greater\r\nnumber of varieties. We have, also, seen that the species, which are\r\nthe commonest and most widely-diffused, vary more than do the rare and\r\nrestricted species. Let (A) be a common, widely-diffused, and varying\r\nspecies, belonging to a genus large in its own country. The branching\r\nand diverging dotted lines of unequal lengths proceeding from (A), may\r\nrepresent its varying offspring. The variations are supposed to be\r\nextremely slight, but of the most diversified nature; they are not\r\nsupposed all to appear simultaneously, but often after long intervals\r\nof time; nor are they all supposed to endure for equal periods. Only\r\nthose variations which are in some way profitable will be preserved or\r\nnaturally selected. And here the importance of the principle of benefit\r\nderived from divergence of character comes in; for this will generally\r\nlead to the most different or divergent variations (represented by the\r\nouter dotted lines) being preserved and accumulated by natural\r\nselection. When a dotted line reaches one of the horizontal lines, and\r\nis there marked by a small numbered letter, a sufficient amount of\r\nvariation is supposed to have been accumulated to form it into a fairly\r\nwell-marked variety, such as would be thought worthy of record in a\r\nsystematic work.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe intervals between the horizontal lines in the diagram, may\r\nrepresent each a thousand or more generations. After a thousand\r\ngenerations, species (A) is supposed to have produced two fairly\r\nwell-marked varieties, namely _a_1 and _m_1. These two varieties will\r\ngenerally still be exposed to the same conditions which made their\r\nparents variable, and the tendency to variability is in itself\r\nhereditary; consequently they will likewise tend to vary, and commonly\r\nin nearly the same manner as did their parents. Moreover, these two\r\nvarieties, being only slightly modified forms, will tend to inherit\r\nthose advantages which made their parent (A) more numerous than most of\r\nthe other inhabitants of the same country; they will also partake of\r\nthose more general advantages which made the genus to which the\r\nparent-species belonged, a large genus in its own country. And all\r\nthese circumstances are favourable to the production of new varieties.\r\n\r\nIf, then, these two varieties be variable, the most divergent of their\r\nvariations will generally be preserved during the next thousand\r\ngenerations. And after this interval, variety a1 is supposed in the\r\ndiagram to have produced variety _a_2, which will, owing to the\r\nprinciple of divergence, differ more from (A) than did variety _a_1.\r\nVariety _m_1 is supposed to have produced two varieties, namely _m_2\r\nand _s_2, differing from each other, and more considerably from their\r\ncommon parent (A). We may continue the process by similar steps for any\r\nlength of time; some of the varieties, after each thousand generations,\r\nproducing only a single variety, but in a more and more modified\r\ncondition, some producing two or three varieties, and some failing to\r\nproduce any. Thus the varieties or modified descendants of the common\r\nparent (A), will generally go on increasing in number and diverging in\r\ncharacter. In the diagram the process is represented up to the\r\nten-thousandth generation, and under a condensed and simplified form up\r\nto the fourteen-thousandth generation.\r\n\r\nBut I must here remark that I do not suppose that the process ever goes\r\non so regularly as is represented in the diagram, though in itself made\r\nsomewhat irregular, nor that it goes on continuously; it is far more\r\nprobable that each form remains for long periods unaltered, and then\r\nagain undergoes modification. Nor do I suppose that the most divergent\r\nvarieties are invariably preserved: a medium form may often long\r\nendure, and may or may not produce more than one modified descendant;\r\nfor natural selection will always act according to the nature of the\r\nplaces which are either unoccupied or not perfectly occupied by other\r\nbeings; and this will depend on infinitely complex relations. But as a\r\ngeneral rule, the more diversified in structure the descendants from\r\nany one species can be rendered, the more places they will be enabled\r\nto seize on, and the more their modified progeny will increase. In our\r\ndiagram the line of succession is broken at regular intervals by small\r\nnumbered letters marking the successive forms which have become\r\nsufficiently distinct to be recorded as varieties. But these breaks are\r\nimaginary, and might have been inserted anywhere, after intervals long\r\nenough to allow the accumulation of a considerable amount of divergent\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\nAs all the modified descendants from a common and widely-diffused\r\nspecies, belonging to a large genus, will tend to partake of the same\r\nadvantages which made their parent successful in life, they will\r\ngenerally go on multiplying in number as well as diverging in\r\ncharacter: this is represented in the diagram by the several divergent\r\nbranches proceeding from (A). The modified offspring from the later and\r\nmore highly improved branches in the lines of descent, will, it is\r\nprobable, often take the place of, and so destroy, the earlier and less\r\nimproved branches: this is represented in the diagram by some of the\r\nlower branches not reaching to the upper horizontal lines. In some\r\ncases no doubt the process of modification will be confined to a single\r\nline of descent, and the number of modified descendants will not be\r\nincreased; although the amount of divergent modification may have been\r\naugmented. This case would be represented in the diagram, if all the\r\nlines proceeding from (A) were removed, excepting that from _a_1 to\r\n_a_10. In the same way the English racehorse and English pointer have\r\napparently both gone on slowly diverging in character from their\r\noriginal stocks, without either having given off any fresh branches or\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nAfter ten thousand generations, species (A) is supposed to have\r\nproduced three forms, _a_10, _f_10, and _m_10, which, from having\r\ndiverged in character during the successive generations, will have come\r\nto differ largely, but perhaps unequally, from each other and from\r\ntheir common parent. If we suppose the amount of change between each\r\nhorizontal line in our diagram to be excessively small, these three\r\nforms may still be only well-marked varieties; but we have only to\r\nsuppose the steps in the process of modification to be more numerous or\r\ngreater in amount, to convert these three forms into doubtful or at\r\nleast into well-defined species: thus the diagram illustrates the steps\r\nby which the small differences distinguishing varieties are increased\r\ninto the larger differences distinguishing species. By continuing the\r\nsame process for a greater number of generations (as shown in the\r\ndiagram in a condensed and simplified manner), we get eight species,\r\nmarked by the letters between _a_14 and _m_14, all descended from (A).\r\nThus, as I believe, species are multiplied and genera are formed.\r\n\r\nIn a large genus it is probable that more than one species would vary.\r\nIn the diagram I have assumed that a second species (I) has produced,\r\nby analogous steps, after ten thousand generations, either two\r\nwell-marked varieties (_w_10 and _z_10) or two species, according to\r\nthe amount of change supposed to be represented between the horizontal\r\nlines. After fourteen thousand generations, six new species, marked by\r\nthe letters _n_14 to _z_14, are supposed to have been produced. In any\r\ngenus, the species which are already very different in character from\r\neach other, will generally tend to produce the greatest number of\r\nmodified descendants; for these will have the best chance of seizing on\r\nnew and widely different places in the polity of nature: hence in the\r\ndiagram I have chosen the extreme species (A), and the nearly extreme\r\nspecies (I), as those which have largely varied, and have given rise to\r\nnew varieties and species. The other nine species (marked by capital\r\nletters) of our original genus, may for long but unequal periods\r\ncontinue to transmit unaltered descendants; and this is shown in the\r\ndiagram by the dotted lines unequally prolonged upwards.\r\n\r\nBut during the process of modification, represented in the diagram,\r\nanother of our principles, namely that of extinction, will have played\r\nan important part. As in each fully stocked country natural selection\r\nnecessarily acts by the selected form having some advantage in the\r\nstruggle for life over other forms, there will be a constant tendency\r\nin the improved descendants of any one species to supplant and\r\nexterminate in each stage of descent their predecessors and their\r\noriginal progenitor. For it should be remembered that the competition\r\nwill generally be most severe between those forms which are most nearly\r\nrelated to each other in habits, constitution and structure. Hence all\r\nthe intermediate forms between the earlier and later states, that is\r\nbetween the less and more improved states of a the same species, as\r\nwell as the original parent-species itself, will generally tend to\r\nbecome extinct. So it probably will be with many whole collateral lines\r\nof descent, which will be conquered by later and improved lines. If,\r\nhowever, the modified offspring of a species get into some distinct\r\ncountry, or become quickly adapted to some quite new station, in which\r\noffspring and progenitor do not come into competition, both may\r\ncontinue to exist.\r\n\r\nIf, then, our diagram be assumed to represent a considerable amount of\r\nmodification, species (A) and all the earlier varieties will have\r\nbecome extinct, being replaced by eight new species (_a_14 to _m_14);\r\nand species (I) will be replaced by six (_n_14 to _z_14) new species.\r\n\r\nBut we may go further than this. The original species of our genus were\r\nsupposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees, as is so generally\r\nthe case in nature; species (A) being more nearly related to B, C, and\r\nD than to the other species; and species (I) more to G, H, K, L, than\r\nto the others. These two species (A and I), were also supposed to be\r\nvery common and widely diffused species, so that they must originally\r\nhave had some advantage over most of the other species of the genus.\r\nTheir modified descendants, fourteen in number at the\r\nfourteen-thousandth generation, will probably have inherited some of\r\nthe same advantages: they have also been modified and improved in a\r\ndiversified manner at each stage of descent, so as to have become\r\nadapted to many related places in the natural economy of their country.\r\nIt seems, therefore, extremely probable that they will have taken the\r\nplaces of, and thus exterminated, not only their parents (A) and (I),\r\nbut likewise some of the original species which were most nearly\r\nrelated to their parents. Hence very few of the original species will\r\nhave transmitted offspring to the fourteen-thousandth generation. We\r\nmay suppose that only one (F) of the two species (E and F) which were\r\nleast closely related to the other nine original species, has\r\ntransmitted descendants to this late stage of descent.\r\n\r\nThe new species in our diagram, descended from the original eleven\r\nspecies, will now be fifteen in number. Owing to the divergent tendency\r\nof natural selection, the extreme amount of difference in character\r\nbetween species _a_14 and _z_14 will be much greater than that between\r\nthe most distinct of the original eleven species. The new species,\r\nmoreover, will be allied to each other in a widely different manner. Of\r\nthe eight descendants from (A) the three marked _a_14, _q_14, _p_14,\r\nwill be nearly related from having recently branched off from _a_10;\r\n_b_14 and _f_14, from having diverged at an earlier period from _a_5,\r\nwill be in some degree distinct from the three first-named species; and\r\nlastly, _o_14, _e_14, and _m_14, will be nearly related one to the\r\nother, but, from having diverged at the first commencement of the\r\nprocess of modification, will be widely different from the other five\r\nspecies, and may constitute a sub-genus or a distinct genus.\r\n\r\nThe six descendants from (I) will form two sub-genera or genera. But as\r\nthe original species (I) differed largely from (A), standing nearly at\r\nthe extreme end of the original genus, the six descendants from (I)\r\nwill, owing to inheritance alone, differ considerably from the eight\r\ndescendants from (A); the two groups, moreover, are supposed to have\r\ngone on diverging in different directions. The intermediate species,\r\nalso (and this is a very important consideration), which connected the\r\noriginal species (A) and (I), have all become, except (F), extinct, and\r\nhave left no descendants. Hence the six new species descended from (I),\r\nand the eight descendants from (A), will have to be ranked as very\r\ndistinct genera, or even as distinct sub-families.\r\n\r\nThus it is, as I believe, that two or more genera are produced by\r\ndescent with modification, from two or more species of the same genus.\r\nAnd the two or more parent-species are supposed to be descended from\r\nsome one species of an earlier genus. In our diagram this is indicated\r\nby the broken lines beneath the capital letters, converging in\r\nsub-branches downwards towards a single point; this point represents a\r\nspecies, the supposed progenitor of our several new sub-genera and\r\ngenera.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to reflect for a moment on the character of the new\r\nspecies F14, which is supposed not to have diverged much in character,\r\nbut to have retained the form of (F), either unaltered or altered only\r\nin a slight degree. In this case its affinities to the other fourteen\r\nnew species will be of a curious and circuitous nature. Being descended\r\nfrom a form that stood between the parent-species (A) and (I), now\r\nsupposed to be extinct and unknown, it will be in some degree\r\nintermediate in character between the two groups descended from these\r\ntwo species. But as these two groups have gone on diverging in\r\ncharacter from the type of their parents, the new species (F14) will\r\nnot be directly intermediate between them, but rather between types of\r\nthe two groups; and every naturalist will be able to call such cases\r\nbefore his mind.\r\n\r\nIn the diagram each horizontal line has hitherto been supposed to\r\nrepresent a thousand generations, but each may represent a million or\r\nmore generations; it may also represent a section of the successive\r\nstrata of the earth’s crust including extinct remains. We shall, when\r\nwe come to our chapter on geology, have to refer again to this subject,\r\nand I think we shall then see that the diagram throws light on the\r\naffinities of extinct beings, which, though generally belonging to the\r\nsame orders, families, or genera, with those now living, yet are often,\r\nin some degree, intermediate in character between existing groups; and\r\nwe can understand this fact, for the extinct species lived at various\r\nremote epochs when the branching lines of descent had diverged less.\r\n\r\nI see no reason to limit the process of modification, as now explained,\r\nto the formation of genera alone. If, in the diagram, we suppose the\r\namount of change represented by each successive group of diverging\r\ndotted lines to be great, the forms marked _a_14 to _p_14, those marked\r\n_b_14 and _f_14, and those marked _o_14 to _m_14, will form three very\r\ndistinct genera. We shall also have two very distinct genera descended\r\nfrom (I), differing widely from the descendants of (A). These two\r\ngroups of genera will thus form two distinct families, or orders,\r\naccording to the amount of divergent modification supposed to be\r\nrepresented in the diagram. And the two new families, or orders, are\r\ndescended from two species of the original genus; and these are\r\nsupposed to be descended from some still more ancient and unknown form.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in each country it is the species belonging to the\r\nlarger genera which oftenest present varieties or incipient species.\r\nThis, indeed, might have been expected; for as natural selection acts\r\nthrough one form having some advantage over other forms in the struggle\r\nfor existence, it will chiefly act on those which already have some\r\nadvantage; and the largeness of any group shows that its species have\r\ninherited from a common ancestor some advantage in common. Hence, the\r\nstruggle for the production of new and modified descendants will mainly\r\nlie between the larger groups, which are all trying to increase in\r\nnumber. One large group will slowly conquer another large group, reduce\r\nits number, and thus lessen its chance of further variation and\r\nimprovement. Within the same large group, the later and more highly\r\nperfected sub-groups, from branching out and seizing on many new places\r\nin the polity of nature, will constantly tend to supplant and destroy\r\nthe earlier and less improved sub-groups. Small and broken groups and\r\nsub-groups will finally disappear. Looking to the future, we can\r\npredict that the groups of organic beings which are now large and\r\ntriumphant, and which are least broken up, that is, which have as yet\r\nsuffered least extinction, will, for a long period, continue to\r\nincrease. But which groups will ultimately prevail, no man can predict;\r\nfor we know that many groups, formerly most extensively developed, have\r\nnow become extinct. Looking still more remotely to the future, we may\r\npredict that, owing to the continued and steady increase of the larger\r\ngroups, a multitude of smaller groups will become utterly extinct, and\r\nleave no modified descendants; and consequently that, of the species\r\nliving at any one period, extremely few will transmit descendants to a\r\nremote futurity. I shall have to return to this subject in the chapter\r\non classification, but I may add that as, according to this view,\r\nextremely few of the more ancient species have transmitted descendants\r\nto the present day, and, as all the descendants of the same species\r\nform a class, we can understand how it is that there exist so few\r\nclasses in each main division of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.\r\nAlthough few of the most ancient species have left modified\r\ndescendants, yet, at remote geological periods, the earth may have been\r\nalmost as well peopled with species of many genera, families, orders\r\nand classes, as at the present day.\r\n\r\n_On the Degree to which Organisation tends to advance._\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural selection acts exclusively by the preservation and accumulation\r\nof variations, which are beneficial under the organic and inorganic\r\nconditions to which each creature is exposed at all periods of life.\r\nThe ultimate result is that each creature tends to become more and more\r\nimproved in relation to its conditions. This improvement inevitably\r\nleads to the gradual advancement of the organisation of the greater\r\nnumber of living beings throughout the world. But here we enter on a\r\nvery intricate subject, for naturalists have not defined to each\r\nother’s satisfaction what is meant by an advance in organisation. Among\r\nthe vertebrata the degree of intellect and an approach in structure to\r\nman clearly come into play. It might be thought that the amount of\r\nchange which the various parts and organs pass through in their\r\ndevelopment from embryo to maturity would suffice as a standard of\r\ncomparison; but there are cases, as with certain parasitic crustaceans,\r\nin which several parts of the structure become less perfect, so that\r\nthe mature animal cannot be called higher than its larva. Von Baer’s\r\nstandard seems the most widely applicable and the best, namely, the\r\namount of differentiation of the parts of the same organic being, in\r\nthe adult state, as I should be inclined to add, and their\r\nspecialisation for different functions; or, as Milne Edwards would\r\nexpress it, the completeness of the division of physiological labour.\r\nBut we shall see how obscure this subject is if we look, for instance,\r\nto fishes, among which some naturalists rank those as highest which,\r\nlike the sharks, approach nearest to amphibians; while other\r\nnaturalists rank the common bony or teleostean fishes as the highest,\r\ninasmuch as they are most strictly fish-like, and differ most from the\r\nother vertebrate classes. We see still more plainly the obscurity of\r\nthe subject by turning to plants, among which the standard of intellect\r\nis of course quite excluded; and here some botanists rank those plants\r\nas highest which have every organ, as sepals, petals, stamens and\r\npistils, fully developed in each flower; whereas other botanists,\r\nprobably with more truth, look at the plants which have their several\r\norgans much modified and reduced in number as the highest.\r\n\r\nIf we take as the standard of high organisation, the amount of\r\ndifferentiation and specialisation of the several organs in each being\r\nwhen adult (and this will include the advancement of the brain for\r\nintellectual purposes), natural selection clearly leads towards this\r\nstandard: for all physiologists admit that the specialisation of\r\norgans, inasmuch as in this state they perform their functions better,\r\nis an advantage to each being; and hence the accumulation of variations\r\ntending towards specialisation is within the scope of natural\r\nselection. On the other hand, we can see, bearing in mind that all\r\norganic beings are striving to increase at a high ratio and to seize on\r\nevery unoccupied or less well occupied place in the economy of nature,\r\nthat it is quite possible for natural selection gradually to fit a\r\nbeing to a situation in which several organs would be superfluous or\r\nuseless: in such cases there would be retrogression in the scale of\r\norganisation. Whether organisation on the whole has actually advanced\r\nfrom the remotest geological periods to the present day will be more\r\nconveniently discussed in our chapter on Geological Succession.\r\n\r\nBut it may be objected that if all organic beings thus tend to rise in\r\nthe scale, how is it that throughout the world a multitude of the\r\nlowest forms still exist; and how is it that in each great class some\r\nforms are far more highly developed than others? Why have not the more\r\nhighly developed forms every where supplanted and exterminated the\r\nlower? Lamarck, who believed in an innate and inevitable tendency\r\ntowards perfection in all organic beings, seems to have felt this\r\ndifficulty so strongly that he was led to suppose that new and simple\r\nforms are continually being produced by spontaneous generation. Science\r\nhas not as yet proved the truth of this belief, whatever the future may\r\nreveal. On our theory the continued existence of lowly organisms offers\r\nno difficulty; for natural selection, or the survival of the fittest,\r\ndoes not necessarily include progressive development—it only takes\r\nadvantage of such variations as arise and are beneficial to each\r\ncreature under its complex relations of life. And it may be asked what\r\nadvantage, as far as we can see, would it be to an infusorian\r\nanimalcule—to an intestinal worm—or even to an earth-worm, to be highly\r\norganised. If it were no advantage, these forms would be left, by\r\nnatural selection, unimproved or but little improved, and might remain\r\nfor indefinite ages in their present lowly condition. And geology tells\r\nus that some of the lowest forms, as the infusoria and rhizopods, have\r\nremained for an enormous period in nearly their present state. But to\r\nsuppose that most of the many now existing low forms have not in the\r\nleast advanced since the first dawn of life would be extremely rash;\r\nfor every naturalist who has dissected some of the beings now ranked as\r\nvery low in the scale, must have been struck with their really wondrous\r\nand beautiful organisation.\r\n\r\nNearly the same remarks are applicable, if we look to the different\r\ngrades of organisation within the same great group; for instance, in\r\nthe vertebrata, to the co-existence of mammals and fish—among mammalia,\r\nto the co-existence of man and the ornithorhynchus—among fishes, to the\r\nco-existence of the shark and the lancelet (Amphioxus), which latter\r\nfish in the extreme simplicity of its structure approaches the\r\ninvertebrate classes. But mammals and fish hardly come into competition\r\nwith each other; the advancement of the whole class of mammals, or of\r\ncertain members in this class, to the highest grade would not lead to\r\ntheir taking the place of fishes. Physiologists believe that the brain\r\nmust be bathed by warm blood to be highly active, and this requires\r\naërial respiration; so that warm-blooded mammals when inhabiting the\r\nwater lie under a disadvantage in having to come continually to the\r\nsurface to breathe. With fishes, members of the shark family would not\r\ntend to supplant the lancelet; for the lancelet, as I hear from Fritz\r\nMüller, has as sole companion and competitor on the barren sandy shore\r\nof South Brazil, an anomalous annelid. The three lowest orders of\r\nmammals, namely, marsupials, edentata, and rodents, co-exist in South\r\nAmerica in the same region with numerous monkeys, and probably\r\ninterfere little with each other. Although organisation, on the whole,\r\nmay have advanced and be still advancing throughout the world, yet the\r\nscale will always present many degrees of perfection; for the high\r\nadvancement of certain whole classes, or of certain members of each\r\nclass, does not at all necessarily lead to the extinction of those\r\ngroups with which they do not enter into close competition. In some\r\ncases, as we shall hereafter see, lowly organised forms appear to have\r\nbeen preserved to the present day, from inhabiting confined or peculiar\r\nstations, where they have been subjected to less severe competition,\r\nand where their scanty numbers have retarded the chance of favourable\r\nvariations arising.\r\n\r\nFinally, I believe that many lowly organised forms now exist throughout\r\nthe world, from various causes. In some cases variations or individual\r\ndifferences of a favourable nature may never have arisen for natural\r\nselection to act on and accumulate. In no case, probably, has time\r\nsufficed for the utmost possible amount of development. In some few\r\ncases there has been what we must call retrogression or organisation.\r\nBut the main cause lies in the fact that under very simple conditions\r\nof life a high organisation would be of no service—possibly would be of\r\nactual disservice, as being of a more delicate nature, and more liable\r\nto be put out of order and injured.\r\n\r\nLooking to the first dawn of life, when all organic beings, as we may\r\nbelieve, presented the simplest structure, how, it has been asked,\r\ncould the first step in the advancement or differentiation of parts\r\nhave arisen? Mr. Herbert Spencer would probably answer that, as soon as\r\nsimple unicellular organisms came by growth or division to be\r\ncompounded of several cells, or became attached to any supporting\r\nsurface, his law “that homologous units of any order become\r\ndifferentiated in proportion as their relations to incident forces\r\nbecome different” would come into action. But as we have no facts to\r\nguide us, speculation on the subject is almost useless. It is, however,\r\nan error to suppose that there would be no struggle for existence, and,\r\nconsequently, no natural selection, until many forms had been produced:\r\nvariations in a single species inhabiting an isolated station might be\r\nbeneficial, and thus the whole mass of individuals might be modified,\r\nor two distinct forms might arise. But, as I remarked towards the close\r\nof the introduction, no one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as\r\nyet unexplained on the origin of species, if we make due allowance for\r\nour profound ignorance on the mutual relations of the inhabitants of\r\nthe world at the present time, and still more so during past ages.\r\n\r\n_Convergence of Character._\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. H.C. Watson thinks that I have overrated the importance of\r\ndivergence of character (in which, however, he apparently believes),\r\nand that convergence, as it may be called, has likewise played a part.\r\nIf two species belonging to two distinct though allied genera, had both\r\nproduced a large number of new and divergent forms, it is conceivable\r\nthat these might approach each other so closely that they would have\r\nall to be classed under the same genus; and thus the descendants of two\r\ndistinct genera would converge into one. But it would in most cases be\r\nextremely rash to attribute to convergence a close and general\r\nsimilarity of structure in the modified descendants of widely distinct\r\nforms. The shape of a crystal is determined solely by the molecular\r\nforces, and it is not surprising that dissimilar substances should\r\nsometimes assume the same form; but with organic beings we should bear\r\nin mind that the form of each depends on an infinitude of complex\r\nrelations, namely on the variations which have arisen, these being due\r\nto causes far too intricate to be followed out—on the nature of the\r\nvariations which have been preserved or selected, and this depends on\r\nthe surrounding physical conditions, and in a still higher degree on\r\nthe surrounding organisms with which each being has come into\r\ncompetition—and lastly, on inheritance (in itself a fluctuating\r\nelement) from innumerable progenitors, all of which have had their\r\nforms determined through equally complex relations. It is incredible\r\nthat the descendants of two organisms, which had originally differed in\r\na marked manner, should ever afterwards converge so closely as to lead\r\nto a near approach to identity throughout their whole organisation. If\r\nthis had occurred, we should meet with the same form, independently of\r\ngenetic connection, recurring in widely separated geological\r\nformations; and the balance of evidence is opposed to any such an\r\nadmission.\r\n\r\nMr. Watson has also objected that the continued action of natural\r\nselection, together with divergence of character, would tend to make an\r\nindefinite number of specific forms. As far as mere inorganic\r\nconditions are concerned, it seems probable that a sufficient number of\r\nspecies would soon become adapted to all considerable diversities of\r\nheat, moisture, &c.; but I fully admit that the mutual relations of\r\norganic beings are more important; and as the number of species in any\r\ncountry goes on increasing, the organic conditions of life must become\r\nmore and more complex. Consequently there seems at first no limit to\r\nthe amount of profitable diversification of structure, and therefore no\r\nlimit to the number of species which might be produced. We do not know\r\nthat even the most prolific area is fully stocked with specific forms:\r\nat the Cape of Good Hope and in Australia, which support such an\r\nastonishing number of species, many European plants have become\r\nnaturalised. But geology shows us, that from an early part of the\r\ntertiary period the number of species of shells, and that from the\r\nmiddle part of this same period, the number of mammals has not greatly\r\nor at all increased. What then checks an indefinite increase in the\r\nnumber of species? The amount of life (I do not mean the number of\r\nspecific forms) supported on an area must have a limit, depending so\r\nlargely as it does on physical conditions; therefore, if an area be\r\ninhabited by very many species, each or nearly each species will be\r\nrepresented by few individuals; and such species will be liable to\r\nextermination from accidental fluctuations in the nature of the seasons\r\nor in the number of their enemies. The process of extermination in such\r\ncases would be rapid, whereas the production of new species must always\r\nbe slow. Imagine the extreme case of as many species as individuals in\r\nEngland, and the first severe winter or very dry summer would\r\nexterminate thousands on thousands of species. Rare species, and each\r\nspecies will become rare if the number of species in any country\r\nbecomes indefinitely increased, will, on the principal often explained,\r\npresent within a given period few favourable variations; consequently,\r\nthe process of giving birth to new specific forms would thus be\r\nretarded. When any species becomes very rare, close interbreeding will\r\nhelp to exterminate it; authors have thought that this comes into play\r\nin accounting for the deterioration of the aurochs in Lithuania, of red\r\ndeer in Scotland and of bears in Norway, &c. Lastly, and this I am\r\ninclined to think is the most important element, a dominant species,\r\nwhich has already beaten many competitors in its own home, will tend to\r\nspread and supplant many others. Alph. de Candolle has shown that those\r\nspecies which spread widely tend generally to spread _very_ widely,\r\nconsequently they will tend to supplant and exterminate several species\r\nin several areas, and thus check the inordinate increase of specific\r\nforms throughout the world. Dr. Hooker has recently shown that in the\r\nsoutheast corner of Australia, where, apparently, there are many\r\ninvaders from different quarters of the globe, the endemic Australian\r\nspecies have been greatly reduced in number. How much weight to\r\nattribute to these several considerations I will not pretend to say;\r\nbut conjointly they must limit in each country the tendency to an\r\nindefinite augmentation of specific forms.\r\n\r\n_Summary of Chapter._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf under changing conditions of life organic beings present individual\r\ndifferences in almost every part of their structure, and this cannot be\r\ndisputed; if there be, owing to their geometrical rate of increase, a\r\nsevere struggle for life at some age, season or year, and this\r\ncertainly cannot be disputed; then, considering the infinite complexity\r\nof the relations of all organic beings to each other and to their\r\nconditions of life, causing an infinite diversity in structure,\r\nconstitution, and habits, to be advantageous to them, it would be a\r\nmost extraordinary fact if no variations had ever occurred useful to\r\neach being’s own welfare, in the same manner as so many variations have\r\noccurred useful to man. But if variations useful to any organic being\r\never do occur, assuredly individuals thus characterised will have the\r\nbest chance of being preserved in the struggle for life; and from the\r\nstrong principle of inheritance, these will tend to produce offspring\r\nsimilarly characterised. This principle of preservation, or the\r\nsurvival of the fittest, I have called Natural Selection. It leads to\r\nthe improvement of each creature in relation to its organic and\r\ninorganic conditions of life; and consequently, in most cases, to what\r\nmust be regarded as an advance in organisation. Nevertheless, low and\r\nsimple forms will long endure if well fitted for their simple\r\nconditions of life.\r\n\r\nNatural selection, on the principle of qualities being inherited at\r\ncorresponding ages, can modify the egg, seed, or young as easily as the\r\nadult. Among many animals sexual selection will have given its aid to\r\nordinary selection by assuring to the most vigorous and best adapted\r\nmales the greatest number of offspring. Sexual selection will also give\r\ncharacters useful to the males alone in their struggles or rivalry with\r\nother males; and these characters will be transmitted to one sex or to\r\nboth sexes, according to the form of inheritance which prevails.\r\n\r\nWhether natural selection has really thus acted in adapting the various\r\nforms of life to their several conditions and stations, must be judged\r\nby the general tenour and balance of evidence given in the following\r\nchapters. But we have already seen how it entails extinction; and how\r\nlargely extinction has acted in the world’s history, geology plainly\r\ndeclares. Natural selection, also, leads to divergence of character;\r\nfor the more organic beings diverge in structure, habits and\r\nconstitution, by so much the more can a large number be supported on\r\nthe area, of which we see proof by looking to the inhabitants of any\r\nsmall spot, and to the productions naturalised in foreign lands.\r\nTherefore, during the modification of the descendants of any one\r\nspecies, and during the incessant struggle of all species to increase\r\nin numbers, the more diversified the descendants become, the better\r\nwill be their chance of success in the battle for life. Thus the small\r\ndifferences distinguishing varieties of the same species, steadily tend\r\nto increase, till they equal the greater differences between species of\r\nthe same genus, or even of distinct genera.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that it is the common, the widely diffused, and widely\r\nranging species, belonging to the larger genera within each class,\r\nwhich vary most; and these tend to transmit to their modified offspring\r\nthat superiority which now makes them dominant in their own countries.\r\nNatural selection, as has just been remarked, leads to divergence of\r\ncharacter and to much extinction of the less improved and intermediate\r\nforms of life. On these principles, the nature of the affinities, and\r\nthe generally well defined distinctions between the innumerable organic\r\nbeings in each class throughout the world, may be explained. It is a\r\ntruly wonderful fact—the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from\r\nfamiliarity—that all animals and all plants throughout all time and\r\nspace should be related to each other in groups, subordinate to groups,\r\nin the manner which we everywhere behold—namely, varieties of the same\r\nspecies most closely related, species of the same genus less closely\r\nand unequally related, forming sections and sub-genera, species of\r\ndistinct genera much less closely related, and genera related in\r\ndifferent degrees, forming sub-families, families, orders, sub-classes,\r\nand classes. The several subordinate groups in any class cannot be\r\nranked in a single file, but seem clustered round points, and these\r\nround other points, and so on in almost endless cycles. If species had\r\nbeen independently created, no explanation would have been possible of\r\nthis kind of classification; but it is explained through inheritance\r\nand the complex action of natural selection, entailing extinction and\r\ndivergence of character, as we have seen illustrated in the diagram.\r\n\r\nThe affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been\r\nrepresented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely speaks the\r\ntruth. The green and budding twigs may represent existing species; and\r\nthose produced during former years may represent the long succession of\r\nextinct species. At each period of growth all the growing twigs have\r\ntried to branch out on all sides, and to overtop and kill the\r\nsurrounding twigs and branches, in the same manner as species and\r\ngroups of species have at all times overmastered other species in the\r\ngreat battle for life. The limbs divided into great branches, and these\r\ninto lesser and lesser branches, were themselves once, when the tree\r\nwas young, budding twigs; and this connexion of the former and present\r\nbuds by ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all\r\nextinct and living species in groups subordinate to groups. Of the many\r\ntwigs which flourished when the tree was a mere bush, only two or\r\nthree, now grown into great branches, yet survive and bear the other\r\nbranches; so with the species which lived during long-past geological\r\nperiods, very few have left living and modified descendants. From the\r\nfirst growth of the tree, many a limb and branch has decayed and\r\ndropped off; and these fallen branches of various sizes may represent\r\nthose whole orders, families, and genera which have now no living\r\nrepresentatives, and which are known to us only in a fossil state. As\r\nwe here and there see a thin, straggling branch springing from a fork\r\nlow down in a tree, and which by some chance has been favoured and is\r\nstill alive on its summit, so we occasionally see an animal like the\r\nOrnithorhynchus or Lepidosiren, which in some small degree connects by\r\nits affinities two large branches of life, and which has apparently\r\nbeen saved from fatal competition by having inhabited a protected\r\nstation. As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if\r\nvigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so\r\nby generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which\r\nfills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and\r\ncovers the surface with its ever-branching and beautiful ramifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nLAWS OF VARIATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffects of changed conditions—Use and disuse, combined with natural\r\nselection; organs of flight and of vision—Acclimatisation—Correlated\r\nvariation—Compensation and economy of growth—False\r\ncorrelations—Multiple, rudimentary, and lowly organised structures\r\nvariable—Parts developed in an unusual manner are highly variable:\r\nspecific characters more variable than generic: secondary sexual\r\ncharacters variable—Species of the same genus vary in an analogous\r\nmanner—Reversions to long-lost characters—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have hitherto sometimes spoken as if the variations—so common and\r\nmultiform with organic beings under domestication, and in a lesser\r\ndegree with those under nature—were due to chance. This, of course is a\r\nwholly incorrect expression, but it serves to acknowledge plainly our\r\nignorance of the cause of each particular variation. Some authors\r\nbelieve it to be as much the function of the reproductive system to\r\nproduce individual differences, or slight deviations of structure, as\r\nto make the child like its parents. But the fact of variations and\r\nmonstrosities occurring much more frequently under domestication than\r\nunder nature, and the greater variability of species having wide ranges\r\nthan of those with restricted ranges, lead to the conclusion that\r\nvariability is generally related to the conditions of life to which\r\neach species has been exposed during several successive generations. In\r\nthe first chapter I attempted to show that changed conditions act in\r\ntwo ways, directly on the whole organisation or on certain parts alone,\r\nand indirectly through the reproductive system. In all cases there are\r\ntwo factors, the nature of the organism, which is much the most\r\nimportant of the two, and the nature of the conditions. The direct\r\naction of changed conditions leads to definite or indefinite results.\r\nIn the latter case the organisation seems to become plastic, and we\r\nhave much fluctuating variability. In the former case the nature of the\r\norganism is such that it yields readily, when subjected to certain\r\nconditions, and all, or nearly all, the individuals become modified in\r\nthe same way.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to decide how far changed conditions, such as of\r\nclimate, food, &c., have acted in a definite manner. There is reason to\r\nbelieve that in the course of time the effects have been greater than\r\ncan be proved by clear evidence. But we may safely conclude that the\r\ninnumerable complex co-adaptations of structure, which we see\r\nthroughout nature between various organic beings, cannot be attributed\r\nsimply to such action. In the following cases the conditions seem to\r\nhave produced some slight definite effect: E. Forbes asserts that\r\nshells at their southern limit, and when living in shallow water, are\r\nmore brightly coloured than those of the same species from further\r\nnorth or from a greater depth; but this certainly does not always hold\r\ngood. Mr. Gould believes that birds of the same species are more\r\nbrightly coloured under a clear atmosphere, than when living near the\r\ncoast or on islands; and Wollaston is convinced that residence near the\r\nsea affects the colours of insects. Moquin-Tandon gives a list of\r\nplants which, when growing near the sea-shore, have their leaves in\r\nsome degree fleshy, though not elsewhere fleshy. These slightly varying\r\norganisms are interesting in as far as they present characters\r\nanalogous to those possessed by the species which are confined to\r\nsimilar conditions.\r\n\r\nWhen a variation is of the slightest use to any being, we cannot tell\r\nhow much to attribute to the accumulative action of natural selection,\r\nand how much to the definite action of the conditions of life. Thus, it\r\nis well known to furriers that animals of the same species have thicker\r\nand better fur the further north they live; but who can tell how much\r\nof this difference may be due to the warmest-clad individuals having\r\nbeen favoured and preserved during many generations, and how much to\r\nthe action of the severe climate? For it would appear that climate has\r\nsome direct action on the hair of our domestic quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nInstances could be given of similar varieties being produced from the\r\nsame species under external conditions of life as different as can well\r\nbe conceived; and, on the other hand, of dissimilar varieties being\r\nproduced under apparently the same external conditions. Again,\r\ninnumerable instances are known to every naturalist, of species keeping\r\ntrue, or not varying at all, although living under the most opposite\r\nclimates. Such considerations as these incline me to lay less weight on\r\nthe direct action of the surrounding conditions, than on a tendency to\r\nvary, due to causes of which we are quite ignorant.\r\n\r\nIn one sense the conditions of life may be said, not only to cause\r\nvariability, either directly or indirectly, but likewise to include\r\nnatural selection, for the conditions determine whether this or that\r\nvariety shall survive. But when man is the selecting agent, we clearly\r\nsee that the two elements of change are distinct; variability is in\r\nsome manner excited, but it is the will of man which accumulates the\r\nvariations in certain direction; and it is this latter agency which\r\nanswers to the survival of the fittest under nature.\r\n\r\n_Effects of the increased Use and Disuse of Parts, as controlled by\r\nNatural Selection._\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the facts alluded to in the first chapter, I think there can be no\r\ndoubt that use in our domestic animals has strengthened and enlarged\r\ncertain parts, and disuse diminished them; and that such modifications\r\nare inherited. Under free nature we have no standard of comparison by\r\nwhich to judge of the effects of long-continued use or disuse, for we\r\nknow not the parent-forms; but many animals possess structures which\r\ncan be best explained by the effects of disuse. As Professor Owen has\r\nremarked, there is no greater anomaly in nature than a bird that cannot\r\nfly; yet there are several in this state. The logger-headed duck of\r\nSouth America can only flap along the surface of the water, and has its\r\nwings in nearly the same condition as the domestic Aylesbury duck: it\r\nis a remarkable fact that the young birds, according to Mr. Cunningham,\r\ncan fly, while the adults have lost this power. As the larger\r\nground-feeding birds seldom take flight except to escape danger, it is\r\nprobable that the nearly wingless condition of several birds, now\r\ninhabiting or which lately inhabited several oceanic islands, tenanted\r\nby no beasts of prey, has been caused by disuse. The ostrich indeed\r\ninhabits continents, and is exposed to danger from which it cannot\r\nescape by flight, but it can defend itself, by kicking its enemies, as\r\nefficiently as many quadrupeds. We may believe that the progenitor of\r\nthe ostrich genus had habits like those of the bustard, and that, as\r\nthe size and weight of its body were increased during successive\r\ngenerations, its legs were used more and its wings less, until they\r\nbecame incapable of flight.\r\n\r\nKirby has remarked (and I have observed the same fact) that the\r\nanterior tarsi, or feet, of many male dung-feeding beetles are often\r\nbroken off; he examined seventeen specimens in his own collection, and\r\nnot one had even a relic left. In the Onites apelles the tarsi are so\r\nhabitually lost that the insect has been described as not having them.\r\nIn some other genera they are present, but in a rudimentary condition.\r\nIn the Ateuchus or sacred beetle of the Egyptians, they are totally\r\ndeficient. The evidence that accidental mutilations can be inherited is\r\nat present not decisive; but the remarkable cases observed by\r\nBrown-Sequard in guinea-pigs, of the inherited effects of operations,\r\nshould make us cautious in denying this tendency. Hence, it will\r\nperhaps be safest to look at the entire absence of the anterior tarsi\r\nin Ateuchus, and their rudimentary condition in some other genera, not\r\nas cases of inherited mutilations, but as due to the effects of\r\nlong-continued disuse; for as many dung-feeding beetles are generally\r\nfound with their tarsi lost, this must happen early in life; therefore\r\nthe tarsi cannot be of much importance or be much used by these\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nIn some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications of\r\nstructure which are wholly, or mainly due to natural selection. Mr.\r\nWollaston has discovered the remarkable fact that 200 beetles, out of\r\nthe 550 species (but more are now known) inhabiting Madeira, are so far\r\ndeficient in wings that they cannot fly; and that, of the twenty-nine\r\nendemic genera, no less than twenty-three have all their species in\r\nthis condition! Several facts, namely, that beetles in many parts of\r\nthe world are very frequently blown to sea and perish; that the beetles\r\nin Madeira, as observed by Mr. Wollaston, lie much concealed, until the\r\nwind lulls and the sun shines; that the proportion of wingless beetles\r\nis larger on the exposed Desertas than in Madeira itself; and\r\nespecially the extraordinary fact, so strongly insisted on by Mr.\r\nWollaston, that certain large groups of beetles, elsewhere excessively\r\nnumerous, which absolutely require the use of their wings, are here\r\nalmost entirely absent. These several considerations make me believe\r\nthat the wingless condition of so many Madeira beetles is mainly due to\r\nthe action of natural selection, combined probably with disuse. For\r\nduring many successive generations each individual beetle which flew\r\nleast, either from its wings having been ever so little less perfectly\r\ndeveloped or from indolent habit, will have had the best chance of\r\nsurviving from not being blown out to sea; and, on the other hand,\r\nthose beetles which most readily took to flight would oftenest have\r\nbeen blown to sea, and thus destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe insects in Madeira which are not ground-feeders, and which, as\r\ncertain flower-feeding coleoptera and lepidoptera, must habitually use\r\ntheir wings to gain their subsistence, have, as Mr. Wollaston suspects,\r\ntheir wings not at all reduced, but even enlarged. This is quite\r\ncompatible with the action of natural selection. For when a new insect\r\nfirst arrived on the island, the tendency of natural selection to\r\nenlarge or to reduce the wings, would depend on whether a greater\r\nnumber of individuals were saved by successfully battling with the\r\nwinds, or by giving up the attempt and rarely or never flying. As with\r\nmariners shipwrecked near a coast, it would have been better for the\r\ngood swimmers if they had been able to swim still further, whereas it\r\nwould have been better for the bad swimmers if they had not been able\r\nto swim at all and had stuck to the wreck.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of moles and of some burrowing rodents are rudimentary in\r\nsize, and in some cases are quite covered by skin and fur. This state\r\nof the eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse, but aided\r\nperhaps by natural selection. In South America, a burrowing rodent, the\r\ntuco-tuco, or Ctenomys, is even more subterranean in its habits than\r\nthe mole; and I was assured by a Spaniard, who had often caught them,\r\nthat they were frequently blind. One which I kept alive was certainly\r\nin this condition, the cause, as appeared on dissection, having been\r\ninflammation of the nictitating membrane. As frequent inflammation of\r\nthe eyes must be injurious to any animal, and as eyes are certainly not\r\nnecessary to animals having subterranean habits, a reduction in their\r\nsize, with the adhesion of the eyelids and growth of fur over them,\r\nmight in such case be an advantage; and if so, natural selection would\r\naid the effects of disuse.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that several animals, belonging to the most different\r\nclasses, which inhabit the caves of Carniola and Kentucky, are blind.\r\nIn some of the crabs the foot-stalk for the eye remains, though the eye\r\nis gone; the stand for the telescope is there, though the telescope\r\nwith its glasses has been lost. As it is difficult to imagine that\r\neyes, though useless, could be in any way injurious to animals living\r\nin darkness, their loss may be attributed to disuse. In one of the\r\nblind animals, namely, the cave-rat (Neotoma), two of which were\r\ncaptured by Professor Silliman at above half a mile distance from the\r\nmouth of the cave, and therefore not in the profoundest depths, the\r\neyes were lustrous and of large size; and these animals, as I am\r\ninformed by Professor Silliman, after having been exposed for about a\r\nmonth to a graduated light, acquired a dim perception of objects.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to imagine conditions of life more similar than deep\r\nlimestone caverns under a nearly similar climate; so that, in\r\naccordance with the old view of the blind animals having been\r\nseparately created for the American and European caverns, very close\r\nsimilarity in their organisation and affinities might have been\r\nexpected. This is certainly not the case if we look at the two whole\r\nfaunas; with respect to the insects alone, Schiödte has remarked: “We\r\nare accordingly prevented from considering the entire phenomenon in any\r\nother light than something purely local, and the similarity which is\r\nexhibited in a few forms between the Mammoth Cave (in Kentucky) and the\r\ncaves in Carniola, otherwise than as a very plain expression of that\r\nanalogy which subsists generally between the fauna of Europe and of\r\nNorth America.” On my view we must suppose that American animals,\r\nhaving in most cases ordinary powers of vision, slowly migrated by\r\nsuccessive generations from the outer world into the deeper and deeper\r\nrecesses of the Kentucky caves, as did European animals into the caves\r\nof Europe. We have some evidence of this gradation of habit; for, as\r\nSchiödte remarks: “We accordingly look upon the subterranean faunas as\r\nsmall ramifications which have penetrated into the earth from the\r\ngeographically limited faunas of the adjacent tracts, and which, as\r\nthey extended themselves into darkness, have been accommodated to\r\nsurrounding circumstances. Animals not far remote from ordinary forms,\r\nprepare the transition from light to darkness. Next follow those that\r\nare constructed for twilight; and, last of all, those destined for\r\ntotal darkness, and whose formation is quite peculiar.” These remarks\r\nof Schiödte’s it should be understood, apply not to the same, but to\r\ndistinct species. By the time that an animal had reached, after\r\nnumberless generations, the deepest recesses, disuse will on this view\r\nhave more or less perfectly obliterated its eyes, and natural selection\r\nwill often have effected other changes, such as an increase in the\r\nlength of the antennæ or palpi, as a compensation for blindness.\r\nNotwithstanding such modifications, we might expect still to see in the\r\ncave-animals of America, affinities to the other inhabitants of that\r\ncontinent, and in those of Europe to the inhabitants of the European\r\ncontinent. And this is the case with some of the American cave-animals,\r\nas I hear from Professor Dana; and some of the European cave-insects\r\nare very closely allied to those of the surrounding country. It would\r\nbe difficult to give any rational explanation of the affinities of the\r\nblind cave-animals to the other inhabitants of the two continents on\r\nthe ordinary view of their independent creation. That several of the\r\ninhabitants of the caves of the Old and New Worlds should be closely\r\nrelated, we might expect from the well-known relationship of most of\r\ntheir other productions. As a blind species of Bathyscia is found in\r\nabundance on shady rocks far from caves, the loss of vision in the cave\r\nspecies of this one genus has probably had no relation to its dark\r\nhabitation; for it is natural that an insect already deprived of vision\r\nshould readily become adapted to dark caverns. Another blind genus\r\n(Anophthalmus) offers this remarkable peculiarity, that the species, as\r\nMr. Murray observes, have not as yet been found anywhere except in\r\ncaves; yet those which inhabit the several caves of Europe and America\r\nare distinct; but it is possible that the progenitors of these several\r\nspecies, while they were furnished with eyes, may formerly have ranged\r\nover both continents, and then have become extinct, excepting in their\r\npresent secluded abodes. Far from feeling surprise that some of the\r\ncave-animals should be very anomalous, as Agassiz has remarked in\r\nregard to the blind fish, the Amblyopsis, and as is the case with the\r\nblind Proteus, with reference to the reptiles of Europe, I am only\r\nsurprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved,\r\nowing to the less severe competition to which the scanty inhabitants of\r\nthese dark abodes will have been exposed.\r\n\r\n_Acclimatisation._\r\n\r\n\r\nHabit is hereditary with plants, as in the period of flowering, in the\r\ntime of sleep, in the amount of rain requisite for seeds to germinate,\r\n&c., and this leads me to say a few words on acclimatisation. As it is\r\nextremely common for distinct species belonging to the same genus to\r\ninhabit hot and cold countries, if it be true that all the species of\r\nthe same genus are descended from a single parent-form, acclimatisation\r\nmust be readily effected during a long course of descent. It is\r\nnotorious that each species is adapted to the climate of its own home:\r\nspecies from an arctic or even from a temperate region cannot endure a\r\ntropical climate, or conversely. So again, many succulent plants cannot\r\nendure a damp climate. But the degree of adaptation of species to the\r\nclimates under which they live is often overrated. We may infer this\r\nfrom our frequent inability to predict whether or not an imported plant\r\nwill endure our climate, and from the number of plants and animals\r\nbrought from different countries which are here perfectly healthy. We\r\nhave reason to believe that species in a state of nature are closely\r\nlimited in their ranges by the competition of other organic beings\r\nquite as much as, or more than, by adaptation to particular climates.\r\nBut whether or not this adaptation is in most cases very close, we have\r\nevidence with some few plants, of their becoming, to a certain extent,\r\nnaturally habituated to different temperatures; that is, they become\r\nacclimatised: thus the pines and rhododendrons, raised from seed\r\ncollected by Dr. Hooker from the same species growing at different\r\nheights on the Himalayas, were found to possess in this country\r\ndifferent constitutional powers of resisting cold. Mr. Thwaites informs\r\nme that he has observed similar facts in Ceylon; analogous observations\r\nhave been made by Mr. H.C. Watson on European species of plants brought\r\nfrom the Azores to England; and I could give other cases. In regard to\r\nanimals, several authentic instances could be adduced of species having\r\nlargely extended, within historical times, their range from warmer to\r\ncolder latitudes, and conversely; but we do not positively know that\r\nthese animals were strictly adapted to their native climate, though in\r\nall ordinary cases we assume such to be the case; nor do we know that\r\nthey have subsequently become specially acclimatised to their new\r\nhomes, so as to be better fitted for them than they were at first.\r\n\r\nAs we may infer that our domestic animals were originally chosen by\r\nuncivilised man because they were useful, and because they bred readily\r\nunder confinement, and not because they were subsequently found capable\r\nof far-extended transportation, the common and extraordinary capacity\r\nin our domestic animals of not only withstanding the most different\r\nclimates, but of being perfectly fertile (a far severer test) under\r\nthem, may be used as an argument that a large proportion of other\r\nanimals now in a state of nature could easily be brought to bear widely\r\ndifferent climates. We must not, however, push the foregoing argument\r\ntoo far, on account of the probable origin of some of our domestic\r\nanimals from several wild stocks: the blood, for instance, of a\r\ntropical and arctic wolf may perhaps be mingled in our domestic breeds.\r\nThe rat and mouse cannot be considered as domestic animals, but they\r\nhave been transported by man to many parts of the world, and now have a\r\nfar wider range than any other rodent; for they live under the cold\r\nclimate of Faroe in the north and of the Falklands in the south, and on\r\nmany an island in the torrid zones. Hence adaptation to any special\r\nclimate may be looked at as a quality readily grafted on an innate wide\r\nflexibility of constitution, common to most animals. On this view, the\r\ncapacity of enduring the most different climates by man himself and by\r\nhis domestic animals, and the fact of the extinct elephant and\r\nrhinoceros having formerly endured a glacial climate, whereas the\r\nliving species are now all tropical or sub-tropical in their habits,\r\nought not to be looked at as anomalies, but as examples of a very\r\ncommon flexibility of constitution, brought, under peculiar\r\ncircumstances, into action.\r\n\r\nHow much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar climate is\r\ndue to mere habit, and how much to the natural selection of varieties\r\nhaving different innate constitutions, and how much to both means\r\ncombined, is an obscure question. That habit or custom has some\r\ninfluence, I must believe, both from analogy and from the incessant\r\nadvice given in agricultural works, even in the ancient Encyclopædias\r\nof China, to be very cautious in transporting animals from one district\r\nto another. And as it is not likely that man should have succeeded in\r\nselecting so many breeds and sub-breeds with constitutions specially\r\nfitted for their own districts, the result must, I think, be due to\r\nhabit. On the other hand, natural selection would inevitably tend to\r\npreserve those individuals which were born with constitutions best\r\nadapted to any country which they inhabited. In treatises on many kinds\r\nof cultivated plants, certain varieties are said to withstand certain\r\nclimates better than others; this is strikingly shown in works on\r\nfruit-trees published in the United States, in which certain varieties\r\nare habitually recommended for the northern and others for the southern\r\nstates; and as most of these varieties are of recent origin, they\r\ncannot owe their constitutional differences to habit. The case of the\r\nJerusalem artichoke, which is never propagated in England by seed, and\r\nof which, consequently, new varieties have not been produced, has even\r\nbeen advanced, as proving that acclimatisation cannot be effected, for\r\nit is now as tender as ever it was! The case, also, of the kidney-bean\r\nhas been often cited for a similar purpose, and with much greater\r\nweight; but until some one will sow, during a score of generations, his\r\nkidney-beans so early that a very large proportion are destroyed by\r\nfrost, and then collect seed from the few survivors, with care to\r\nprevent accidental crosses, and then again get seed from these\r\nseedlings, with the same precautions, the experiment cannot be said to\r\nhave been even tried. Nor let it be supposed that differences in the\r\nconstitution of seedling kidney-beans never appear, for an account has\r\nbeen published how much more hardy some seedlings are than others; and\r\nof this fact I have myself observed striking instances.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, we may conclude that habit, or use and disuse, have, in\r\nsome cases, played a considerable part in the modification of the\r\nconstitution and structure; but that the effects have often been\r\nlargely combined with, and sometimes overmastered by, the natural\r\nselection of innate variations.\r\n\r\n_Correlated Variation_\r\n\r\n\r\nI mean by this expression that the whole organisation is so tied\r\ntogether, during its growth and development, that when slight\r\nvariations in any one part occur and are accumulated through natural\r\nselection, other parts become modified. This is a very important\r\nsubject, most imperfectly understood, and no doubt wholly different\r\nclasses of facts may be here easily confounded together. We shall\r\npresently see that simple inheritance often gives the false appearance\r\nof correlation. One of the most obvious real cases is, that variations\r\nof structure arising in the young or larvæ naturally tend to affect the\r\nstructure of the mature animal. The several parts which are homologous,\r\nand which, at an early embryonic period, are identical in structure,\r\nand which are necessarily exposed to similar conditions, seem eminently\r\nliable to vary in a like manner: we see this in the right and left\r\nsides of the body varying in the same manner; in the front and hind\r\nlegs, and even in the jaws and limbs, varying together, for the lower\r\njaw is believed by some anatomists to be homologous with the limbs.\r\nThese tendencies, I do not doubt, may be mastered more or less\r\ncompletely by natural selection: thus a family of stags once existed\r\nwith an antler only on one side; and if this had been of any great use\r\nto the breed, it might probably have been rendered permanent by natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nHomologous parts, as has been remarked by some authors, tend to cohere;\r\nthis is often seen in monstrous plants: and nothing is more common than\r\nthe union of homologous parts in normal structures, as in the union of\r\nthe petals into a tube. Hard parts seem to affect the form of adjoining\r\nsoft parts; it is believed by some authors that with birds the\r\ndiversity in the shape of the pelvis causes the remarkable diversity in\r\nthe shape of the kidneys. Others believe that the shape of the pelvis\r\nin the human mother influences by pressure the shape of the head of the\r\nchild. In snakes, according to Schlegel, the shape of the body and the\r\nmanner of swallowing determine the position and form of several of the\r\nmost important viscera.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the bond is frequently quite obscure. M. Is. Geoffroy St.\r\nHilaire has forcibly remarked that certain malconformations frequently,\r\nand that others rarely, coexist without our being able to assign any\r\nreason. What can be more singular than the relation in cats between\r\ncomplete whiteness and blue eyes with deafness, or between the\r\ntortoise-shell colour and the female sex; or in pigeons, between their\r\nfeathered feet and skin betwixt the outer toes, or between the presence\r\nof more or less down on the young pigeon when first hatched, with the\r\nfuture colour of its plumage; or, again, the relation between the hair\r\nand the teeth in the naked Turkish dog, though here no doubt homology\r\ncomes into play? With respect to this latter case of correlation, I\r\nthink it can hardly be accidental that the two orders of mammals which\r\nare most abnormal in their dermal covering, viz., Cetacea (whales) and\r\nEdentata (armadilloes, scaly ant-eaters, &c.), are likewise on the\r\nwhole the most abnormal in their teeth, but there are so many\r\nexceptions to this rule, as Mr. Mivart has remarked, that it has little\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nI know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the laws of\r\ncorrelation and variation, independently of utility, and therefore of\r\nnatural selection, than that of the difference between the outer and\r\ninner flowers in some Compositous and Umbelliferous plants. Everyone is\r\nfamiliar with the difference between the ray and central florets of,\r\nfor instance, the daisy, and this difference is often accompanied with\r\nthe partial or complete abortion of the reproductive organs. But in\r\nsome of these plants the seeds also differ in shape and sculpture.\r\nThese differences have sometimes been attributed to the pressure of the\r\ninvolucra on the florets, or to their mutual pressure, and the shape of\r\nthe seeds in the ray-florets of some Compositæ countenances this idea;\r\nbut with the Umbelliferæ it is by no means, as Dr. Hooker informs me,\r\nthe species with the densest heads which most frequently differ in\r\ntheir inner and outer flowers. It might have been thought that the\r\ndevelopment of the ray-petals, by drawing nourishment from the\r\nreproductive organs causes their abortion; but this can hardly be the\r\nsole case, for in some Compositæ the seeds of the outer and inner\r\nflorets differ, without any difference in the corolla. Possibly these\r\nseveral differences may be connected with the different flow of\r\nnutriment towards the central and external flowers. We know, at least,\r\nthat with irregular flowers those nearest to the axis are most subject\r\nto peloria, that is to become abnormally symmetrical. I may add, as an\r\ninstance of this fact, and as a striking case of correlation, that in\r\nmany pelargoniums the two upper petals in the central flower of the\r\ntruss often lose their patches of darker colour; and when this occurs,\r\nthe adherent nectary is quite aborted, the central flower thus becoming\r\npeloric or regular. When the colour is absent from only one of the two\r\nupper petals, the nectary is not quite aborted but is much shortened.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the development of the corolla, Sprengel’s idea that\r\nthe ray-florets serve to attract insects, whose agency is highly\r\nadvantageous, or necessary for the fertilisation of these plants, is\r\nhighly probable; and if so, natural selection may have come into play.\r\nBut with respect to the seeds, it seems impossible that their\r\ndifferences in shape, which are not always correlated with any\r\ndifference in the corolla, can be in any way beneficial; yet in the\r\nUmbelliferæ these differences are of such apparent importance—the seeds\r\nbeing sometimes orthospermous in the exterior flowers and cœlospermous\r\nin the central flowers—that the elder De Candolle founded his main\r\ndivisions in the order on such characters. Hence modifications of\r\nstructure, viewed by systematists as of high value, may be wholly due\r\nto the laws of variation and correlation, without being, as far as we\r\ncan judge, of the slightest service to the species.\r\n\r\nWe may often falsely attribute to correlated variation structures which\r\nare common to whole groups of species, and which in truth are simply\r\ndue to inheritance; for an ancient progenitor may have acquired through\r\nnatural selection some one modification in structure, and, after\r\nthousands of generations, some other and independent modification; and\r\nthese two modifications, having been transmitted to a whole group of\r\ndescendants with diverse habits, would naturally be thought to be in\r\nsome necessary manner correlated. Some other correlations are\r\napparently due to the manner in which natural selection can alone act.\r\nFor instance, Alph. De Candolle has remarked that winged seeds are\r\nnever found in fruits which do not open; I should explain this rule by\r\nthe impossibility of seeds gradually becoming winged through natural\r\nselection, unless the capsules were open; for in this case alone could\r\nthe seeds, which were a little better adapted to be wafted by the wind,\r\ngain an advantage over others less well fitted for wide dispersal.\r\n\r\n_Compensation and Economy of Growth._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elder Geoffroy and Goethe propounded, at about the same time, their\r\nlaw of compensation or balancement of growth; or, as Goethe expressed\r\nit, “in order to spend on one side, nature is forced to economise on\r\nthe other side.” I think this holds true to a certain extent with our\r\ndomestic productions: if nourishment flows to one part or organ in\r\nexcess, it rarely flows, at least in excess, to another part; thus it\r\nis difficult to get a cow to give much milk and to fatten readily. The\r\nsame varieties of the cabbage do not yield abundant and nutritious\r\nfoliage and a copious supply of oil-bearing seeds. When the seeds in\r\nour fruits become atrophied, the fruit itself gains largely in size and\r\nquality. In our poultry, a large tuft of feathers on the head is\r\ngenerally accompanied by a diminished comb, and a large beard by\r\ndiminished wattles. With species in a state of nature it can hardly be\r\nmaintained that the law is of universal application; but many good\r\nobservers, more especially botanists, believe in its truth. I will not,\r\nhowever, here give any instances, for I see hardly any way of\r\ndistinguishing between the effects, on the one hand, of a part being\r\nlargely developed through natural selection and another and adjoining\r\npart being reduced by the same process or by disuse, and, on the other\r\nhand, the actual withdrawal of nutriment from one part owing to the\r\nexcess of growth in another and adjoining part.\r\n\r\nI suspect, also, that some of the cases of compensation which have been\r\nadvanced, and likewise some other facts, may be merged under a more\r\ngeneral principle, namely, that natural selection is continually trying\r\nto economise in every part of the organisation. If under changed\r\nconditions of life a structure, before useful, becomes less useful, its\r\ndiminution will be favoured, for it will profit the individual not to\r\nhave its nutriment wasted in building up a useless structure. I can\r\nthus only understand a fact with which I was much struck when examining\r\ncirripedes, and of which many other instances could be given: namely,\r\nthat when a cirripede is parasitic within another cirripede and is thus\r\nprotected, it loses more or less completely its own shell or carapace.\r\nThis is the case with the male Ibla, and in a truly extraordinary\r\nmanner with the Proteolepas: for the carapace in all other cirripedes\r\nconsists of the three highly important anterior segments of the head\r\nenormously developed, and furnished with great nerves and muscles; but\r\nin the parasitic and protected Proteolepas, the whole anterior part of\r\nthe head is reduced to the merest rudiment attached to the bases of the\r\nprehensile antennæ. Now the saving of a large and complex structure,\r\nwhen rendered superfluous, would be a decided advantage to each\r\nsuccessive individual of the species; for in the struggle for life to\r\nwhich every animal is exposed, each would have a better chance of\r\nsupporting itself, by less nutriment being wasted.\r\n\r\nThus, as I believe, natural selection will tend in the long run to\r\nreduce any part of the organisation, as soon as it becomes, through\r\nchanged habits, superfluous, without by any means causing some other\r\npart to be largely developed in a corresponding degree. And conversely,\r\nthat natural selection may perfectly well succeed in largely developing\r\nan organ without requiring as a necessary compensation the reduction of\r\nsome adjoining part.\r\n\r\n_Multiple, Rudimentary, and Lowly-organised Structures are Variable._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a rule, as remarked by Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire, both\r\nwith varieties and species, that when any part or organ is repeated\r\nmany times in the same individual (as the vertebræ in snakes, and the\r\nstamens in polyandrous flowers) the number is variable; whereas the\r\nnumber of the same part or organ, when it occurs in lesser numbers, is\r\nconstant. The same author as well as some botanists, have further\r\nremarked that multiple parts are extremely liable to vary in structure.\r\nAs “vegetative repetition,” to use Professor Owen’s expression, is a\r\nsign of low organisation; the foregoing statements accord with the\r\ncommon opinion of naturalists, that beings which stand low in the scale\r\nof nature are more variable than those which are higher. I presume that\r\nlowness here means that the several parts of the organisation have been\r\nbut little specialised for particular functions; and as long as the\r\nsame part has to perform diversified work, we can perhaps see why it\r\nshould remain variable, that is, why natural selection should not have\r\npreserved or rejected each little deviation of form so carefully as\r\nwhen the part has to serve for some one special purpose. In the same\r\nway that a knife which has to cut all sorts of things may be of almost\r\nany shape; whilst a tool for some particular purpose must be of some\r\nparticular shape. Natural selection, it should never be forgotten, can\r\nact solely through and for the advantage of each being.\r\n\r\nRudimentary parts, as is generally admitted, are apt to be highly\r\nvariable. We shall have to recur to this subject; and I will here only\r\nadd that their variability seems to result from their uselessness, and\r\nconsequently from natural selection having had no power to check\r\ndeviations in their structure.\r\n\r\n_A Part developed in any Species in an extraordinary degree or manner,\r\nin comparison with the same part in allied Species, tends to be highly\r\nvariable._\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago I was much struck by a remark to the above effect\r\nmade by Mr. Waterhouse. Professor Owen, also, seems to have come to a\r\nnearly similar conclusion. It is hopeless to attempt to convince any\r\none of the truth of the above proposition without giving the long array\r\nof facts which I have collected, and which cannot possibly be here\r\nintroduced. I can only state my conviction that it is a rule of high\r\ngenerality. I am aware of several causes of error, but I hope that I\r\nhave made due allowances for them. It should be understood that the\r\nrule by no means applies to any part, however unusually developed,\r\nunless it be unusually developed in one species or in a few species in\r\ncomparison with the same part in many closely allied species. Thus, the\r\nwing of the bat is a most abnormal structure in the class of mammals;\r\nbut the rule would not apply here, because the whole group of bats\r\npossesses wings; it would apply only if some one species had wings\r\ndeveloped in a remarkable manner in comparison with the other species\r\nof the same genus. The rule applies very strongly in the case of\r\nsecondary sexual characters, when displayed in any unusual manner. The\r\nterm, secondary sexual characters, used by Hunter, relates to\r\ncharacters which are attached to one sex, but are not directly\r\nconnected with the act of reproduction. The rule applies to males and\r\nfemales; but more rarely to females, as they seldom offer remarkable\r\nsecondary sexual characters. The rule being so plainly applicable in\r\nthe case of secondary sexual characters, may be due to the great\r\nvariability of these characters, whether or not displayed in any\r\nunusual manner—of which fact I think there can be little doubt. But\r\nthat our rule is not confined to secondary sexual characters is clearly\r\nshown in the case of hermaphrodite cirripedes; I particularly attended\r\nto Mr. Waterhouse’s remark, whilst investigating this Order, and I am\r\nfully convinced that the rule almost always holds good. I shall, in a\r\nfuture work, give a list of all the more remarkable cases. I will here\r\ngive only one, as it illustrates the rule in its largest application.\r\nThe opercular valves of sessile cirripedes (rock barnacles) are, in\r\nevery sense of the word, very important structures, and they differ\r\nextremely little even in distinct genera; but in the several species of\r\none genus, Pyrgoma, these valves present a marvellous amount of\r\ndiversification; the homologous valves in the different species being\r\nsometimes wholly unlike in shape; and the amount of variation in the\r\nindividuals of the same species is so great that it is no exaggeration\r\nto state that the varieties of the same species differ more from each\r\nother in the characters derived from these important organs, than do\r\nthe species belonging to other distinct genera.\r\n\r\nAs with birds the individuals of the same species, inhabiting the same\r\ncountry, vary extremely little, I have particularly attended to them;\r\nand the rule certainly seems to hold good in this class. I cannot make\r\nout that it applies to plants, and this would have seriously shaken my\r\nbelief in its truth, had not the great variability in plants made it\r\nparticularly difficult to compare their relative degrees of\r\nvariability.\r\n\r\nWhen we see any part or organ developed in a remarkable degree or\r\nmanner in a species, the fair presumption is that it is of high\r\nimportance to that species: nevertheless it is in this case eminently\r\nliable to variation. Why should this be so? On the view that each\r\nspecies has been independently created, with all its parts as we now\r\nsee them, I can see no explanation. But on the view that groups of\r\nspecies are descended from some other species, and have been modified\r\nthrough natural selection, I think we can obtain some light. First let\r\nme make some preliminary remarks. If, in our domestic animals, any part\r\nor the whole animal be neglected, and no selection be applied, that\r\npart (for instance, the comb in the Dorking fowl) or the whole breed\r\nwill cease to have a uniform character: and the breed may be said to be\r\ndegenerating. In rudimentary organs, and in those which have been but\r\nlittle specialised for any particular purpose, and perhaps in\r\npolymorphic groups, we see a nearly parallel case; for in such cases\r\nnatural selection either has not or cannot come into full play, and\r\nthus the organisation is left in a fluctuating condition. But what here\r\nmore particularly concerns us is, that those points in our domestic\r\nanimals, which at the present time are undergoing rapid change by\r\ncontinued selection, are also eminently liable to variation. Look at\r\nthe individuals of the same breed of the pigeon; and see what a\r\nprodigious amount of difference there is in the beak of tumblers, in\r\nthe beak and wattle of carriers, in the carriage and tail of fantails,\r\n&c., these being the points now mainly attended to by English fanciers.\r\nEven in the same sub-breed, as in that of the short-faced tumbler, it\r\nis notoriously difficult to breed nearly perfect birds, many departing\r\nwidely from the standard. There may truly be said to be a constant\r\nstruggle going on between, on the one hand, the tendency to reversion\r\nto a less perfect state, as well as an innate tendency to new\r\nvariations, and, on the other hand, the power of steady selection to\r\nkeep the breed true. In the long run selection gains the day, and we do\r\nnot expect to fail so completely as to breed a bird as coarse as a\r\ncommon tumbler pigeon from a good short-faced strain. But as long as\r\nselection is rapidly going on, much variability in the parts undergoing\r\nmodification may always be expected.\r\n\r\nNow let us turn to nature. When a part has been developed in an\r\nextraordinary manner in any one species, compared with the other\r\nspecies of the same genus, we may conclude that this part has undergone\r\nan extraordinary amount of modification since the period when the\r\nseveral species branched off from the common progenitor of the genus.\r\nThis period will seldom be remote in any extreme degree, as species\r\nrarely endure for more than one geological period. An extraordinary\r\namount of modification implies an unusually large and long-continued\r\namount of variability, which has continually been accumulated by\r\nnatural selection for the benefit of the species. But as the\r\nvariability of the extraordinarily developed part or organ has been so\r\ngreat and long-continued within a period not excessively remote, we\r\nmight, as a general rule, still expect to find more variability in such\r\nparts than in other parts of the organisation which have remained for a\r\nmuch longer period nearly constant. And this, I am convinced, is the\r\ncase. That the struggle between natural selection on the one hand, and\r\nthe tendency to reversion and variability on the other hand, will in\r\nthe course of time cease; and that the most abnormally developed organs\r\nmay be made constant, I see no reason to doubt. Hence, when an organ,\r\nhowever abnormal it may be, has been transmitted in approximately the\r\nsame condition to many modified descendants, as in the case of the wing\r\nof the bat, it must have existed, according to our theory, for an\r\nimmense period in nearly the same state; and thus it has come not to be\r\nmore variable than any other structure. It is only in those cases in\r\nwhich the modification has been comparatively recent and\r\nextraordinarily great that we ought to find the _generative\r\nvariability_, as it may be called, still present in a high degree. For\r\nin this case the variability will seldom as yet have been fixed by the\r\ncontinued selection of the individuals varying in the required manner\r\nand degree, and by the continued rejection of those tending to revert\r\nto a former and less modified condition.\r\n\r\n_Specific Characters more Variable than Generic Characters._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principle discussed under the last heading may be applied to our\r\npresent subject. It is notorious that specific characters are more\r\nvariable than generic. To explain by a simple example what is meant: if\r\nin a large genus of plants some species had blue flowers and some had\r\nred, the colour would be only a specific character, and no one would be\r\nsurprised at one of the blue species varying into red, or conversely;\r\nbut if all the species had blue flowers, the colour would become a\r\ngeneric character, and its variation would be a more unusual\r\ncircumstance. I have chosen this example because the explanation which\r\nmost naturalists would advance is not here applicable, namely, that\r\nspecific characters are more variable than generic, because they are\r\ntaken from parts of less physiological importance than those commonly\r\nused for classing genera. I believe this explanation is partly, yet\r\nonly indirectly, true; I shall, however, have to return to this point\r\nin the chapter on Classification. It would be almost superfluous to\r\nadduce evidence in support of the statement, that ordinary specific\r\ncharacters are more variable than generic; but with respect to\r\nimportant characters, I have repeatedly noticed in works on natural\r\nhistory, that when an author remarks with surprise that some important\r\norgan or part, which is generally very constant throughout a large\r\ngroup of species, _differs_ considerably in closely-allied species, it\r\nis often _variable_ in the individuals of the same species. And this\r\nfact shows that a character, which is generally of generic value, when\r\nit sinks in value and becomes only of specific value, often becomes\r\nvariable, though its physiological importance may remain the same.\r\nSomething of the same kind applies to monstrosities: at least Is.\r\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire apparently entertains no doubt, that the more an\r\norgan normally differs in the different species of the same group, the\r\nmore subject it is to anomalies in the individuals.\r\n\r\nOn the ordinary view of each species having been independently created,\r\nwhy should that part of the structure, which differs from the same part\r\nin other independently created species of the same genus, be more\r\nvariable than those parts which are closely alike in the several\r\nspecies? I do not see that any explanation can be given. But on the\r\nview that species are only strongly marked and fixed varieties, we\r\nmight expect often to find them still continuing to vary in those parts\r\nof their structure which have varied within a moderately recent period,\r\nand which have thus come to differ. Or to state the case in another\r\nmanner: the points in which all the species of a genus resemble each\r\nother, and in which they differ from allied genera, are called generic\r\ncharacters; and these characters may be attributed to inheritance from\r\na common progenitor, for it can rarely have happened that natural\r\nselection will have modified several distinct species, fitted to more\r\nor less widely different habits, in exactly the same manner: and as\r\nthese so-called generic characters have been inherited from before the\r\nperiod when the several species first branched off from their common\r\nprogenitor, and subsequently have not varied or come to differ in any\r\ndegree, or only in a slight degree, it is not probable that they should\r\nvary at the present day. On the other hand, the points in which species\r\ndiffer from other species of the same genus are called specific\r\ncharacters; and as these specific characters have varied and come to\r\ndiffer since the period when the species branched off from a common\r\nprogenitor, it is probable that they should still often be in some\r\ndegree variable—at least more variable than those parts of the\r\norganisation which have for a very long period remained constant.\r\n\r\n_Secondary Sexual Characters Variable._—I think it will be admitted by\r\nnaturalists, without my entering on details, that secondary sexual\r\ncharacters are highly variable. It will also be admitted that species\r\nof the same group differ from each other more widely in their secondary\r\nsexual characters, than in other parts of their organisation; compare,\r\nfor instance, the amount of difference between the males of\r\ngallinaceous birds, in which secondary sexual characters are strongly\r\ndisplayed, with the amount of difference between the females. The cause\r\nof the original variability of these characters is not manifest; but we\r\ncan see why they should not have been rendered as constant and uniform\r\nas others, for they are accumulated by sexual selection, which is less\r\nrigid in its action than ordinary selection, as it does not entail\r\ndeath, but only gives fewer offspring to the less favoured males.\r\nWhatever the cause may be of the variability of secondary sexual\r\ncharacters, as they are highly variable, sexual selection will have had\r\na wide scope for action, and may thus have succeeded in giving to the\r\nspecies of the same group a greater amount of difference in these than\r\nin other respects.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact, that the secondary differences between the two\r\nsexes of the same species are generally displayed in the very same\r\nparts of the organisation in which the species of the same genus differ\r\nfrom each other. Of this fact I will give in illustration the first two\r\ninstances which happen to stand on my list; and as the differences in\r\nthese cases are of a very unusual nature, the relation can hardly be\r\naccidental. The same number of joints in the tarsi is a character\r\ncommon to very large groups of beetles, but in the Engidæ, as Westwood\r\nhas remarked, the number varies greatly and the number likewise differs\r\nin the two sexes of the same species. Again in the fossorial\r\nhymenoptera, the neuration of the wings is a character of the highest\r\nimportance, because common to large groups; but in certain genera the\r\nneuration differs in the different species, and likewise in the two\r\nsexes of the same species. Sir J. Lubbock has recently remarked, that\r\nseveral minute crustaceans offer excellent illustrations of this law.\r\n“In Pontella, for instance, the sexual characters are afforded mainly\r\nby the anterior antennæ and by the fifth pair of legs: the specific\r\ndifferences also are principally given by these organs.” This relation\r\nhas a clear meaning on my view: I look at all the species of the same\r\ngenus as having as certainly descended from the same progenitor, as\r\nhave the two sexes of any one species. Consequently, whatever part of\r\nthe structure of the common progenitor, or of its early descendants,\r\nbecame variable; variations of this part would, it is highly probable,\r\nbe taken advantage of by natural and sexual selection, in order to fit\r\nthe several places in the economy of nature, and likewise to fit the\r\ntwo sexes of the same species to each other, or to fit the males to\r\nstruggle with other males for the possession of the females.\r\n\r\nFinally, then, I conclude that the greater variability of specific\r\ncharacters, or those which distinguish species from species, than of\r\ngeneric characters, or those which are possessed by all the species;\r\nthat the frequent extreme variability of any part which is developed in\r\na species in an extraordinary manner in comparison with the same part\r\nin its congeners; and the slight degree of variability in a part,\r\nhowever extraordinarily it may be developed, if it be common to a whole\r\ngroup of species; that the great variability of secondary sexual\r\ncharacters and their great difference in closely allied species; that\r\nsecondary sexual and ordinary specific differences are generally\r\ndisplayed in the same parts of the organisation, are all principles\r\nclosely connected together. All being mainly due to the species of the\r\nsame group being the descendants of a common progenitor, from whom they\r\nhave inherited much in common, to parts which have recently and largely\r\nvaried being more likely still to go on varying than parts which have\r\nlong been inherited and have not varied, to natural selection having\r\nmore or less completely, according to the lapse of time, overmastered\r\nthe tendency to reversion and to further variability, to sexual\r\nselection being less rigid than ordinary selection, and to variations\r\nin the same parts having been accumulated by natural and sexual\r\nselection, and thus having been adapted for secondary sexual, and for\r\nordinary purposes.\r\n\r\n_Distinct Species present analogous Variations, so that a Variety of\r\none Species often assumes a Character Proper to an allied Species, or\r\nreverts to some of the Characters of an early Progenitor._—These\r\npropositions will be most readily understood by looking to our domestic\r\nraces. The most distinct breeds of the pigeon, in countries widely\r\napart, present sub-varieties with reversed feathers on the head, and\r\nwith feathers on the feet, characters not possessed by the aboriginal\r\nrock-pigeon; these then are analogous variations in two or more\r\ndistinct races. The frequent presence of fourteen or even sixteen\r\ntail-feathers in the pouter may be considered as a variation\r\nrepresenting the normal structure of another race, the fantail. I\r\npresume that no one will doubt that all such analogous variations are\r\ndue to the several races of the pigeon having inherited from a common\r\nparent the same constitution and tendency to variation, when acted on\r\nby similar unknown influences. In the vegetable kingdom we have a case\r\nof analogous variation, in the enlarged stems, or as commonly called\r\nroots, of the Swedish turnip and ruta-baga, plants which several\r\nbotanists rank as varieties produced by cultivation from a common\r\nparent: if this be not so, the case will then be one of analogous\r\nvariation in two so-called distinct species; and to these a third may\r\nbe added, namely, the common turnip. According to the ordinary view of\r\neach species having been independently created, we should have to\r\nattribute this similarity in the enlarged stems of these three plants,\r\nnot to the vera causa of community of descent, and a consequent\r\ntendency to vary in a like manner, but to three separate yet closely\r\nrelated acts of creation. Many similar cases of analogous variation\r\nhave been observed by Naudin in the great gourd family, and by various\r\nauthors in our cereals. Similar cases occurring with insects under\r\nnatural conditions have lately been discussed with much ability by Mr.\r\nWalsh, who has grouped them under his law of equable variability.\r\n\r\nWith pigeons, however, we have another case, namely, the occasional\r\nappearance in all the breeds, of slaty-blue birds with two black bars\r\non the wings, white loins, a bar at the end of the tail, with the outer\r\nfeathers externally edged near their bases with white. As all these\r\nmarks are characteristic of the parent rock-pigeon, I presume that no\r\none will doubt that this is a case of reversion, and not of a new yet\r\nanalogous variation appearing in the several breeds. We may, I think,\r\nconfidently come to this conclusion, because, as we have seen, these\r\ncoloured marks are eminently liable to appear in the crossed offspring\r\nof two distinct and differently coloured breeds; and in this case there\r\nis nothing in the external conditions of life to cause the reappearance\r\nof the slaty-blue, with the several marks, beyond the influence of the\r\nmere act of crossing on the laws of inheritance.\r\n\r\nNo doubt it is a very surprising fact that characters should reappear\r\nafter having been lost for many, probably for hundreds of generations.\r\nBut when a breed has been crossed only once by some other breed, the\r\noffspring occasionally show for many generations a tendency to revert\r\nin character to the foreign breed—some say, for a dozen or even a score\r\nof generations. After twelve generations, the proportion of blood, to\r\nuse a common expression, from one ancestor, is only 1 in 2048; and yet,\r\nas we see, it is generally believed that a tendency to reversion is\r\nretained by this remnant of foreign blood. In a breed which has not\r\nbeen crossed, but in which _both_ parents have lost some character\r\nwhich their progenitor possessed, the tendency, whether strong or weak,\r\nto reproduce the lost character might, as was formerly remarked, for\r\nall that we can see to the contrary, be transmitted for almost any\r\nnumber of generations. When a character which has been lost in a breed,\r\nreappears after a great number of generations, the most probable\r\nhypothesis is, not that one individual suddenly takes after an ancestor\r\nremoved by some hundred generations, but that in each successive\r\ngeneration the character in question has been lying latent, and at\r\nlast, under unknown favourable conditions, is developed. With the\r\nbarb-pigeon, for instance, which very rarely produces a blue bird, it\r\nis probable that there is a latent tendency in each generation to\r\nproduce blue plumage. The abstract improbability of such a tendency\r\nbeing transmitted through a vast number of generations, is not greater\r\nthan that of quite useless or rudimentary organs being similarly\r\ntransmitted. A mere tendency to produce a rudiment is indeed sometimes\r\nthus inherited.\r\n\r\nAs all the species of the same genus are supposed to be descended from\r\na common progenitor, it might be expected that they would occasionally\r\nvary in an analogous manner; so that the varieties of two or more\r\nspecies would resemble each other, or that a variety of one species\r\nwould resemble in certain characters another and distinct species, this\r\nother species being, according to our view, only a well-marked and\r\npermanent variety. But characters exclusively due to analogous\r\nvariation would probably be of an unimportant nature, for the\r\npreservation of all functionally important characters will have been\r\ndetermined through natural selection, in accordance with the different\r\nhabits of the species. It might further be expected that the species of\r\nthe same genus would occasionally exhibit reversions to long-lost\r\ncharacters. As, however, we do not know the common ancestor of any\r\nnatural group, we cannot distinguish between reversionary and analogous\r\ncharacters. If, for instance, we did not know that the parent\r\nrock-pigeon was not feather-footed or turn-crowned, we could not have\r\ntold, whether such characters in our domestic breeds were reversions or\r\nonly analogous variations; but we might have inferred that the blue\r\ncolour was a case of reversion from the number of the markings, which\r\nare correlated with this tint, and which would not probably have all\r\nappeared together from simple variation. More especially we might have\r\ninferred this from the blue colour and the several marks so often\r\nappearing when differently coloured breeds are crossed. Hence, although\r\nunder nature it must generally be left doubtful, what cases are\r\nreversions to formerly existing characters, and what are new but\r\nanalogous variations, yet we ought, on our theory, sometimes to find\r\nthe varying offspring of a species assuming characters which are\r\nalready present in other members of the same group. And this\r\nundoubtedly is the case.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty in distinguishing variable species is largely due to the\r\nvarieties mocking, as it were, other species of the same genus. A\r\nconsiderable catalogue, also, could be given of forms intermediate\r\nbetween two other forms, which themselves can only doubtfully be ranked\r\nas species; and this shows, unless all these closely allied forms be\r\nconsidered as independently created species, that they have in varying\r\nassumed some of the characters of the others. But the best evidence of\r\nanalogous variations is afforded by parts or organs which are generally\r\nconstant in character, but which occasionally vary so as to resemble,\r\nin some degree, the same part or organ in an allied species. I have\r\ncollected a long list of such cases; but here, as before, I lie under\r\nthe great disadvantage of not being able to give them. I can only\r\nrepeat that such cases certainly occur, and seem to me very remarkable.\r\n\r\nI will, however, give one curious and complex case, not indeed as\r\naffecting any important character, but from occurring in several\r\nspecies of the same genus, partly under domestication and partly under\r\nnature. It is a case almost certainly of reversion. The ass sometimes\r\nhas very distinct transverse bars on its legs, like those on the legs\r\nof a zebra. It has been asserted that these are plainest in the foal,\r\nand from inquiries which I have made, I believe this to be true. The\r\nstripe on the shoulder is sometimes double, and is very variable in\r\nlength and outline. A white ass, but _not_ an albino, has been\r\ndescribed without either spinal or shoulder stripe; and these stripes\r\nare sometimes very obscure, or actually quite lost, in dark-coloured\r\nasses. The koulan of Pallas is said to have been seen with a double\r\nshoulder-stripe. Mr. Blyth has seen a specimen of the hemionus with a\r\ndistinct shoulder-stripe, though it properly has none; and I have been\r\ninformed by Colonel Poole that foals of this species are generally\r\nstriped on the legs and faintly on the shoulder. The quagga, though so\r\nplainly barred like a zebra over the body, is without bars on the legs;\r\nbut Dr. Gray has figured one specimen with very distinct zebra-like\r\nbars on the hocks.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the horse, I have collected cases in England of the\r\nspinal stripe in horses of the most distinct breeds, and of _all_\r\ncolours; transverse bars on the legs are not rare in duns, mouse-duns,\r\nand in one instance in a chestnut; a faint shoulder-stripe may\r\nsometimes be seen in duns, and I have seen a trace in a bay horse. My\r\nson made a careful examination and sketch for me of a dun Belgian\r\ncart-horse with a double stripe on each shoulder and with leg-stripes.\r\nI have myself seen a dun Devonshire pony, and a small dun Welsh pony\r\nhas been carefully described to me, both with _three_ parallel stripes\r\non each shoulder.\r\n\r\nIn the northwest part of India the Kattywar breed of horses is so\r\ngenerally striped, that, as I hear from Colonel Poole, who examined\r\nthis breed for the Indian Government, a horse without stripes is not\r\nconsidered as purely bred. The spine is always striped; the legs are\r\ngenerally barred; and the shoulder-stripe, which is sometimes double\r\nand sometimes treble, is common; the side of the face, moreover, is\r\nsometimes striped. The stripes are often plainest in the foal; and\r\nsometimes quite disappear in old horses. Colonel Poole has seen both\r\ngray and bay Kattywar horses striped when first foaled. I have also\r\nreason to suspect, from information given me by Mr. W.W. Edwards, that\r\nwith the English race-horse the spinal stripe is much commoner in the\r\nfoal than in the full-grown animal. I have myself recently bred a foal\r\nfrom a bay mare (offspring of a Turkoman horse and a Flemish mare) by a\r\nbay English race-horse. This foal, when a week old, was marked on its\r\nhinder quarters and on its forehead with numerous very narrow, dark,\r\nzebra-like bars, and its legs were feebly striped. All the stripes soon\r\ndisappeared completely. Without here entering on further details I may\r\nstate that I have collected cases of leg and shoulder stripes in horses\r\nof very different breeds in various countries from Britain to Eastern\r\nChina; and from Norway in the north to the Malay Archipelago in the\r\nsouth. In all parts of the world these stripes occur far oftenest in\r\nduns and mouse-duns; by the term dun a large range of colour is\r\nincluded, from one between brown and black to a close approach to cream\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nI am aware that Colonel Hamilton Smith, who has written on this\r\nsubject, believes that the several breeds of the horse are descended\r\nfrom several aboriginal species, one of which, the dun, was striped;\r\nand that the above-described appearances are all due to ancient crosses\r\nwith the dun stock. But this view may be safely rejected, for it is\r\nhighly improbable that the heavy Belgian cart-horse, Welsh ponies,\r\nNorwegian cobs, the lanky Kattywar race, &c., inhabiting the most\r\ndistant parts of the world, should have all have been crossed with one\r\nsupposed aboriginal stock.\r\n\r\nNow let us turn to the effects of crossing the several species of the\r\nhorse genus. Rollin asserts that the common mule from the ass and horse\r\nis particularly apt to have bars on its legs; according to Mr. Gosse,\r\nin certain parts of the United States, about nine out of ten mules have\r\nstriped legs. I once saw a mule with its legs so much striped that any\r\none might have thought that it was a hybrid zebra; and Mr. W.C. Martin,\r\nin his excellent treatise on the horse, has given a figure of a similar\r\nmule. In four coloured drawings, which I have seen, of hybrids between\r\nthe ass and zebra, the legs were much more plainly barred than the rest\r\nof the body; and in one of them there was a double shoulder-stripe. In\r\nLord Morton’s famous hybrid, from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the\r\nhybrid and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the same\r\nmare by a black Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the\r\nlegs than is even the pure quagga. Lastly, and this is another most\r\nremarkable case, a hybrid has been figured by Dr. Gray (and he informs\r\nme that he knows of a second case) from the ass and the hemionus; and\r\nthis hybrid, though the ass only occasionally has stripes on his legs\r\nand the hemionus has none and has not even a shoulder-stripe,\r\nnevertheless had all four legs barred, and had three short\r\nshoulder-stripes, like those on the dun Devonshire and Welsh ponies,\r\nand even had some zebra-like stripes on the sides of its face. With\r\nrespect to this last fact, I was so convinced that not even a stripe of\r\ncolour appears from what is commonly called chance, that I was led\r\nsolely from the occurrence of the face-stripes on this hybrid from the\r\nass and hemionus to ask Colonel Poole whether such face-stripes ever\r\noccurred in the eminently striped Kattywar breed of horses, and was, as\r\nwe have seen, answered in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nWhat now are we to say to these several facts? We see several distinct\r\nspecies of the horse genus becoming, by simple variation, striped on\r\nthe legs like a zebra, or striped on the shoulders like an ass. In the\r\nhorse we see this tendency strong whenever a dun tint appears—a tint\r\nwhich approaches to that of the general colouring of the other species\r\nof the genus. The appearance of the stripes is not accompanied by any\r\nchange of form, or by any other new character. We see this tendency to\r\nbecome striped most strongly displayed in hybrids from between several\r\nof the most distinct species. Now observe the case of the several\r\nbreeds of pigeons: they are descended from a pigeon (including two or\r\nthree sub-species or geographical races) of a bluish colour, with\r\ncertain bars and other marks; and when any breed assumes by simple\r\nvariation a bluish tint, these bars and other marks invariably\r\nreappear; but without any other change of form or character. When the\r\noldest and truest breeds of various colours are crossed, we see a\r\nstrong tendency for the blue tint and bars and marks to reappear in the\r\nmongrels. I have stated that the most probable hypothesis to account\r\nfor the reappearance of very ancient characters, is—that there is a\r\n_tendency_ in the young of each successive generation to produce the\r\nlong-lost character, and that this tendency, from unknown causes,\r\nsometimes prevails. And we have just seen that in several species of\r\nthe horse genus the stripes are either plainer or appear more commonly\r\nin the young than in the old. Call the breeds of pigeons, some of which\r\nhave bred true for centuries, species; and how exactly parallel is the\r\ncase with that of the species of the horse genus! For myself, I venture\r\nconfidently to look back thousands on thousands of generations, and I\r\nsee an animal striped like a zebra, but perhaps otherwise very\r\ndifferently constructed, the common parent of our domestic horse\r\n(whether or not it be descended from one or more wild stocks) of the\r\nass, the hemionus, quagga, and zebra.\r\n\r\nHe who believes that each equine species was independently created,\r\nwill, I presume, assert that each species has been created with a\r\ntendency to vary, both under nature and under domestication, in this\r\nparticular manner, so as often to become striped like the other species\r\nof the genus; and that each has been created with a strong tendency,\r\nwhen crossed with species inhabiting distant quarters of the world, to\r\nproduce hybrids resembling in their stripes, not their own parents, but\r\nother species of the genus. To admit this view is, as it seems to me,\r\nto reject a real for an unreal, or at least for an unknown cause. It\r\nmakes the works of God a mere mockery and deception; I would almost as\r\nsoon believe with the old and ignorant cosmogonists, that fossil shells\r\nhad never lived, but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells\r\nnow living on the sea-shore.\r\n\r\n_Summary._—Our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound. Not in\r\none case out of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this\r\nor that part has varied. But whenever we have the means of instituting\r\na comparison, the same laws appear to have acted in producing the\r\nlesser differences between varieties of the same species, and the\r\ngreater differences between species of the same genus. Changed\r\nconditions generally induce mere fluctuating variability, but sometimes\r\nthey cause direct and definite effects; and these may become strongly\r\nmarked in the course of time, though we have not sufficient evidence on\r\nthis head. Habit in producing constitutional peculiarities, and use in\r\nstrengthening, and disuse in weakening and diminishing organs, appear\r\nin many cases to have been potent in their effects. Homologous parts\r\ntend to vary in the same manner, and homologous parts tend to cohere.\r\nModifications in hard parts and in external parts sometimes affect\r\nsofter and internal parts. When one part is largely developed, perhaps\r\nit tends to draw nourishment from the adjoining parts; and every part\r\nof the structure which can be saved without detriment will be saved.\r\nChanges of structure at an early age may affect parts subsequently\r\ndeveloped; and many cases of correlated variation, the nature of which\r\nwe are unable to understand, undoubtedly occur. Multiple parts are\r\nvariable in number and in structure, perhaps arising from such parts\r\nnot having been closely specialised for any particular function, so\r\nthat their modifications have not been closely checked by natural\r\nselection. It follows probably from this same cause, that organic\r\nbeings low in the scale are more variable than those standing higher in\r\nthe scale, and which have their whole organisation more specialised.\r\nRudimentary organs, from being useless, are not regulated by natural\r\nselection, and hence are variable. Specific characters—that is, the\r\ncharacters which have come to differ since the several species of the\r\nsame genus branched off from a common parent—are more variable than\r\ngeneric characters, or those which have long been inherited, and have\r\nnot differed within this same period. In these remarks we have referred\r\nto special parts or organs being still variable, because they have\r\nrecently varied and thus come to differ; but we have also seen in the\r\nsecond chapter that the same principle applies to the whole individual;\r\nfor in a district where many species of a genus are found—that is,\r\nwhere there has been much former variation and differentiation, or\r\nwhere the manufactory of new specific forms has been actively at\r\nwork—in that district and among these species, we now find, on an\r\naverage, most varieties. Secondary sexual characters are highly\r\nvariable, and such characters differ much in the species of the same\r\ngroup. Variability in the same parts of the organisation has generally\r\nbeen taken advantage of in giving secondary sexual differences to the\r\ntwo sexes of the same species, and specific differences to the several\r\nspecies of the same genus. Any part or organ developed to an\r\nextraordinary size or in an extraordinary manner, in comparison with\r\nthe same part or organ in the allied species, must have gone through an\r\nextraordinary amount of modification since the genus arose; and thus we\r\ncan understand why it should often still be variable in a much higher\r\ndegree than other parts; for variation is a long-continued and slow\r\nprocess, and natural selection will in such cases not as yet have had\r\ntime to overcome the tendency to further variability and to reversion\r\nto a less modified state. But when a species with an extraordinarily\r\ndeveloped organ has become the parent of many modified\r\ndescendants—which on our view must be a very slow process, requiring a\r\nlong lapse of time—in this case, natural selection has succeeded in\r\ngiving a fixed character to the organ, in however extraordinary a\r\nmanner it may have been developed. Species inheriting nearly the same\r\nconstitution from a common parent, and exposed to similar influences,\r\nnaturally tend to present analogous variations, or these same species\r\nmay occasionally revert to some of the characters of their ancient\r\nprogenitors. Although new and important modifications may not arise\r\nfrom reversion and analogous variation, such modifications will add to\r\nthe beautiful and harmonious diversity of nature.\r\n\r\nWhatever the cause may be of each slight difference between the\r\noffspring and their parents—and a cause for each must exist—we have\r\nreason to believe that it is the steady accumulation of beneficial\r\ndifferences which has given rise to all the more important\r\nmodifications of structure in relation to the habits of each species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nDIFFICULTIES OF THE THEORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifficulties of the theory of descent with modification—Absence or\r\nrarity of transitional varieties—Transitions in habits of\r\nlife—Diversified habits in the same species—Species with habits widely\r\ndifferent from those of their allies—Organs of extreme perfection—Modes\r\nof transition—Cases of difficulty—Natura non facit saltum—Organs of\r\nsmall importance—Organs not in all cases absolutely perfect—The law of\r\nUnity of Type and of the Conditions of Existence embraced by the theory\r\nof Natural Selection.\r\n\r\n\r\nLong before the reader has arrived at this part of my work, a crowd of\r\ndifficulties will have occurred to him. Some of them are so serious\r\nthat to this day I can hardly reflect on them without being in some\r\ndegree staggered; but, to the best of my judgment, the greater number\r\nare only apparent, and those that are real are not, I think, fatal to\r\nthe theory.\r\n\r\nThese difficulties and objections may be classed under the following\r\nheads: First, why, if species have descended from other species by fine\r\ngradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms?\r\nWhy is not all nature in confusion, instead of the species being, as we\r\nsee them, well defined?\r\n\r\nSecondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance, the\r\nstructure and habits of a bat, could have been formed by the\r\nmodification of some other animal with widely different habits and\r\nstructure? Can we believe that natural selection could produce, on the\r\none hand, an organ of trifling importance, such as the tail of a\r\ngiraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand, an\r\norgan so wonderful as the eye?\r\n\r\nThirdly, can instincts be acquired and modified through natural\r\nselection? What shall we say to the instinct which leads the bee to\r\nmake cells, and which has practically anticipated the discoveries of\r\nprofound mathematicians?\r\n\r\nFourthly, how can we account for species, when crossed, being sterile\r\nand producing sterile offspring, whereas, when varieties are crossed,\r\ntheir fertility is unimpaired?\r\n\r\nThe two first heads will be here discussed; some miscellaneous\r\nobjections in the following chapter; Instinct and Hybridism in the two\r\nsucceeding chapters.\r\n\r\n_On the Absence or Rarity of Transitional Varieties._—As natural\r\nselection acts solely by the preservation of profitable modifications,\r\neach new form will tend in a fully-stocked country to take the place\r\nof, and finally to exterminate, its own less improved parent-form and\r\nother less-favoured forms with which it comes into competition. Thus\r\nextinction and natural selection go hand in hand. Hence, if we look at\r\neach species as descended from some unknown form, both the parent and\r\nall the transitional varieties will generally have been exterminated by\r\nthe very process of the formation and perfection of the new form.\r\n\r\nBut, as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have\r\nexisted, why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the\r\ncrust of the earth? It will be more convenient to discuss this question\r\nin the chapter on the imperfection of the geological record; and I will\r\nhere only state that I believe the answer mainly lies in the record\r\nbeing incomparably less perfect than is generally supposed. The crust\r\nof the earth is a vast museum; but the natural collections have been\r\nimperfectly made, and only at long intervals of time.\r\n\r\nBut it may be urged that when several closely allied species inhabit\r\nthe same territory, we surely ought to find at the present time many\r\ntransitional forms. Let us take a simple case: in travelling from north\r\nto south over a continent, we generally meet at successive intervals\r\nwith closely allied or representative species, evidently filling nearly\r\nthe same place in the natural economy of the land. These representative\r\nspecies often meet and interlock; and as the one becomes rarer and\r\nrarer, the other becomes more and more frequent, till the one replaces\r\nthe other. But if we compare these species where they intermingle, they\r\nare generally as absolutely distinct from each other in every detail of\r\nstructure as are specimens taken from the metropolis inhabited by each.\r\nBy my theory these allied species are descended from a common parent;\r\nand during the process of modification, each has become adapted to the\r\nconditions of life of its own region, and has supplanted and\r\nexterminated its original parent-form and all the transitional\r\nvarieties between its past and present states. Hence we ought not to\r\nexpect at the present time to meet with numerous transitional varieties\r\nin each region, though they must have existed there, and may be\r\nembedded there in a fossil condition. But in the intermediate region,\r\nhaving intermediate conditions of life, why do we not now find\r\nclosely-linking intermediate varieties? This difficulty for a long time\r\nquite confounded me. But I think it can be in large part explained.\r\n\r\nIn the first place we should be extremely cautious in inferring,\r\nbecause an area is now continuous, that it has been continuous during a\r\nlong period. Geology would lead us to believe that most continents have\r\nbeen broken up into islands even during the later tertiary periods; and\r\nin such islands distinct species might have been separately formed\r\nwithout the possibility of intermediate varieties existing in the\r\nintermediate zones. By changes in the form of the land and of climate,\r\nmarine areas now continuous must often have existed within recent times\r\nin a far less continuous and uniform condition than at present. But I\r\nwill pass over this way of escaping from the difficulty; for I believe\r\nthat many perfectly defined species have been formed on strictly\r\ncontinuous areas; though I do not doubt that the formerly broken\r\ncondition of areas now continuous, has played an important part in the\r\nformation of new species, more especially with freely-crossing and\r\nwandering animals.\r\n\r\nIn looking at species as they are now distributed over a wide area, we\r\ngenerally find them tolerably numerous over a large territory, then\r\nbecoming somewhat abruptly rarer and rarer on the confines, and finally\r\ndisappearing. Hence the neutral territory between two representative\r\nspecies is generally narrow in comparison with the territory proper to\r\neach. We see the same fact in ascending mountains, and sometimes it is\r\nquite remarkable how abruptly, as Alph. De Candolle has observed, a\r\ncommon alpine species disappears. The same fact has been noticed by E.\r\nForbes in sounding the depths of the sea with the dredge. To those who\r\nlook at climate and the physical conditions of life as the\r\nall-important elements of distribution, these facts ought to cause\r\nsurprise, as climate and height or depth graduate away insensibly. But\r\nwhen we bear in mind that almost every species, even in its metropolis,\r\nwould increase immensely in numbers, were it not for other competing\r\nspecies; that nearly all either prey on or serve as prey for others; in\r\nshort, that each organic being is either directly or indirectly related\r\nin the most important manner to other organic beings—we see that the\r\nrange of the inhabitants of any country by no means exclusively depends\r\non insensibly changing physical conditions, but in large part on the\r\npresence of other species, on which it lives, or by which it is\r\ndestroyed, or with which it comes into competition; and as these\r\nspecies are already defined objects, not blending one into another by\r\ninsensible gradations, the range of any one species, depending as it\r\ndoes on the range of others, will tend to be sharply defined. Moreover,\r\neach species on the confines of its range, where it exists in lessened\r\nnumbers, will, during fluctuations in the number of its enemies or of\r\nits prey, or in the nature of the seasons, be extremely liable to utter\r\nextermination; and thus its geographical range will come to be still\r\nmore sharply defined.\r\n\r\nAs allied or representative species, when inhabiting a continuous area,\r\nare generally distributed in such a manner that each has a wide range,\r\nwith a comparatively narrow neutral territory between them, in which\r\nthey become rather suddenly rarer and rarer; then, as varieties do not\r\nessentially differ from species, the same rule will probably apply to\r\nboth; and if we take a varying species inhabiting a very large area, we\r\nshall have to adapt two varieties to two large areas, and a third\r\nvariety to a narrow intermediate zone. The intermediate variety,\r\nconsequently, will exist in lesser numbers from inhabiting a narrow and\r\nlesser area; and practically, as far as I can make out, this rule holds\r\ngood with varieties in a state of nature. I have met with striking\r\ninstances of the rule in the case of varieties intermediate between\r\nwell-marked varieties in the genus Balanus. And it would appear from\r\ninformation given me by Mr. Watson, Dr. Asa Gray, and Mr. Wollaston,\r\nthat generally, when varieties intermediate between two other forms\r\noccur, they are much rarer numerically than the forms which they\r\nconnect. Now, if we may trust these facts and inferences, and conclude\r\nthat varieties linking two other varieties together generally have\r\nexisted in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect, then we\r\ncan understand why intermediate varieties should not endure for very\r\nlong periods: why, as a general rule, they should be exterminated and\r\ndisappear, sooner than the forms which they originally linked together.\r\n\r\nFor any form existing in lesser numbers would, as already remarked, run\r\na greater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large\r\nnumbers; and in this particular case the intermediate form would be\r\neminently liable to the inroads of closely allied forms existing on\r\nboth sides of it. But it is a far more important consideration, that\r\nduring the process of further modification, by which two varieties are\r\nsupposed to be converted and perfected into two distinct species, the\r\ntwo which exist in larger numbers, from inhabiting larger areas, will\r\nhave a great advantage over the intermediate variety, which exists in\r\nsmaller numbers in a narrow and intermediate zone. For forms existing\r\nin larger numbers will have a better chance, within any given period,\r\nof presenting further favourable variations for natural selection to\r\nseize on, than will the rarer forms which exist in lesser numbers.\r\nHence, the more common forms, in the race for life, will tend to beat\r\nand supplant the less common forms, for these will be more slowly\r\nmodified and improved. It is the same principle which, as I believe,\r\naccounts for the common species in each country, as shown in the second\r\nchapter, presenting on an average a greater number of well-marked\r\nvarieties than do the rarer species. I may illustrate what I mean by\r\nsupposing three varieties of sheep to be kept, one adapted to an\r\nextensive mountainous region; a second to a comparatively narrow, hilly\r\ntract; and a third to the wide plains at the base; and that the\r\ninhabitants are all trying with equal steadiness and skill to improve\r\ntheir stocks by selection; the chances in this case will be strongly in\r\nfavour of the great holders on the mountains or on the plains improving\r\ntheir breeds more quickly than the small holders on the intermediate\r\nnarrow, hilly tract; and consequently the improved mountain or plain\r\nbreed will soon take the place of the less improved hill breed; and\r\nthus the two breeds, which originally existed in greater numbers, will\r\ncome into close contact with each other, without the interposition of\r\nthe supplanted, intermediate hill variety.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I believe that species come to be tolerably well-defined\r\nobjects, and do not at any one period present an inextricable chaos of\r\nvarying and intermediate links: first, because new varieties are very\r\nslowly formed, for variation is a slow process, and natural selection\r\ncan do nothing until favourable individual differences or variations\r\noccur, and until a place in the natural polity of the country can be\r\nbetter filled by some modification of some one or more of its\r\ninhabitants. And such new places will depend on slow changes of\r\nclimate, or on the occasional immigration of new inhabitants, and,\r\nprobably, in a still more important degree, on some of the old\r\ninhabitants becoming slowly modified, with the new forms thus produced\r\nand the old ones acting and reacting on each other. So that, in any one\r\nregion and at any one time, we ought to see only a few species\r\npresenting slight modifications of structure in some degree permanent;\r\nand this assuredly we do see.\r\n\r\nSecondly, areas now continuous must often have existed within the\r\nrecent period as isolated portions, in which many forms, more\r\nespecially among the classes which unite for each birth and wander\r\nmuch, may have separately been rendered sufficiently distinct to rank\r\nas representative species. In this case, intermediate varieties between\r\nthe several representative species and their common parent, must\r\nformerly have existed within each isolated portion of the land, but\r\nthese links during the process of natural selection will have been\r\nsupplanted and exterminated, so that they will no longer be found in a\r\nliving state.\r\n\r\nThirdly, when two or more varieties have been formed in different\r\nportions of a strictly continuous area, intermediate varieties will, it\r\nis probable, at first have been formed in the intermediate zones, but\r\nthey will generally have had a short duration. For these intermediate\r\nvarieties will, from reasons already assigned (namely from what we know\r\nof the actual distribution of closely allied or representative species,\r\nand likewise of acknowledged varieties), exist in the intermediate\r\nzones in lesser numbers than the varieties which they tend to connect.\r\nFrom this cause alone the intermediate varieties will be liable to\r\naccidental extermination; and during the process of further\r\nmodification through natural selection, they will almost certainly be\r\nbeaten and supplanted by the forms which they connect; for these, from\r\nexisting in greater numbers will, in the aggregate, present more\r\nvarieties, and thus be further improved through natural selection and\r\ngain further advantages.\r\n\r\nLastly, looking not to any one time, but at all time, if my theory be\r\ntrue, numberless intermediate varieties, linking closely together all\r\nthe species of the same group, must assuredly have existed; but the\r\nvery process of natural selection constantly tends, as has been so\r\noften remarked, to exterminate the parent forms and the intermediate\r\nlinks. Consequently evidence of their former existence could be found\r\nonly among fossil remains, which are preserved, as we shall attempt to\r\nshow in a future chapter, in an extremely imperfect and intermittent\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n_On the Origin and Transition of Organic Beings with peculiar Habits\r\nand Structure._—It has been asked by the opponents of such views as I\r\nhold, how, for instance, could a land carnivorous animal have been\r\nconverted into one with aquatic habits; for how could the animal in its\r\ntransitional state have subsisted? It would be easy to show that there\r\nnow exist carnivorous animals presenting close intermediate grades from\r\nstrictly terrestrial to aquatic habits; and as each exists by a\r\nstruggle for life, it is clear that each must be well adapted to its\r\nplace in nature. Look at the Mustela vison of North America, which has\r\nwebbed feet, and which resembles an otter in its fur, short legs, and\r\nform of tail; during summer this animal dives for and preys on fish,\r\nbut during the long winter it leaves the frozen waters, and preys, like\r\nother polecats on mice and land animals. If a different case had been\r\ntaken, and it had been asked how an insectivorous quadruped could\r\npossibly have been converted into a flying bat, the question would have\r\nbeen far more difficult to answer. Yet I think such difficulties have\r\nlittle weight.\r\n\r\nHere, as on other occasions, I lie under a heavy disadvantage, for, out\r\nof the many striking cases which I have collected, I can give only one\r\nor two instances of transitional habits and structures in allied\r\nspecies; and of diversified habits, either constant or occasional, in\r\nthe same species. And it seems to me that nothing less than a long list\r\nof such cases is sufficient to lessen the difficulty in any particular\r\ncase like that of the bat.\r\n\r\nLook at the family of squirrels; here we have the finest gradation from\r\nanimals with their tails only slightly flattened, and from others, as\r\nSir J. Richardson has remarked, with the posterior part of their bodies\r\nrather wide and with the skin on their flanks rather full, to the\r\nso-called flying squirrels; and flying squirrels have their limbs and\r\neven the base of the tail united by a broad expanse of skin, which\r\nserves as a parachute and allows them to glide through the air to an\r\nastonishing distance from tree to tree. We cannot doubt that each\r\nstructure is of use to each kind of squirrel in its own country, by\r\nenabling it to escape birds or beasts of prey, or to collect food more\r\nquickly, or, as there is reason to believe, to lessen the danger from\r\noccasional falls. But it does not follow from this fact that the\r\nstructure of each squirrel is the best that it is possible to conceive\r\nunder all possible conditions. Let the climate and vegetation change,\r\nlet other competing rodents or new beasts of prey immigrate, or old\r\nones become modified, and all analogy would lead us to believe that\r\nsome, at least, of the squirrels would decrease in numbers or become\r\nexterminated, unless they also become modified and improved in\r\nstructure in a corresponding manner. Therefore, I can see no\r\ndifficulty, more especially under changing conditions of life, in the\r\ncontinued preservation of individuals with fuller and fuller\r\nflank-membranes, each modification being useful, each being propagated,\r\nuntil, by the accumulated effects of this process of natural selection,\r\na perfect so-called flying squirrel was produced.\r\n\r\nNow look at the Galeopithecus or so-called flying lemur, which was\r\nformerly ranked among bats, but is now believed to belong to the\r\nInsectivora. An extremely wide flank-membrane stretches from the\r\ncorners of the jaw to the tail, and includes the limbs with the\r\nelongated fingers. This flank-membrane is furnished with an extensor\r\nmuscle. Although no graduated links of structure, fitted for gliding\r\nthrough the air, now connect the Galeopithecus with the other\r\nInsectivora, yet there is no difficulty in supposing that such links\r\nformerly existed, and that each was developed in the same manner as\r\nwith the less perfectly gliding squirrels; each grade of structure\r\nhaving been useful to its possessor. Nor can I see any insuperable\r\ndifficulty in further believing it possible that the membrane-connected\r\nfingers and fore-arm of the Galeopithecus might have been greatly\r\nlengthened by natural selection; and this, as far as the organs of\r\nflight are concerned, would have converted the animal into a bat. In\r\ncertain bats in which the wing-membrane extends from the top of the\r\nshoulder to the tail and includes the hind-legs, we perhaps see traces\r\nof an apparatus originally fitted for gliding through the air rather\r\nthan for flight.\r\n\r\nIf about a dozen genera of birds were to become extinct, who would have\r\nventured to surmise that birds might have existed which used their\r\nwings solely as flappers, like the logger headed duck (Micropterus of\r\nEyton); as fins in the water and as front legs on the land, like the\r\npenguin; as sails, like the ostrich; and functionally for no purpose,\r\nlike the apteryx? Yet the structure of each of these birds is good for\r\nit, under the conditions of life to which it is exposed, for each has\r\nto live by a struggle: but it is not necessarily the best possible\r\nunder all possible conditions. It must not be inferred from these\r\nremarks that any of the grades of wing-structure here alluded to, which\r\nperhaps may all be the result of disuse, indicate the steps by which\r\nbirds actually acquired their perfect power of flight; but they serve\r\nto show what diversified means of transition are at least possible.\r\n\r\nSeeing that a few members of such water-breathing classes as the\r\nCrustacea and Mollusca are adapted to live on the land; and seeing that\r\nwe have flying birds and mammals, flying insects of the most\r\ndiversified types, and formerly had flying reptiles, it is conceivable\r\nthat flying-fish, which now glide far through the air, slightly rising\r\nand turning by the aid of their fluttering fins, might have been\r\nmodified into perfectly winged animals. If this had been effected, who\r\nwould have ever imagined that in an early transitional state they had\r\nbeen inhabitants of the open ocean, and had used their incipient organs\r\nof flight exclusively, so far as we know, to escape being devoured by\r\nother fish?\r\n\r\nWhen we see any structure highly perfected for any particular habit, as\r\nthe wings of a bird for flight, we should bear in mind that animals\r\ndisplaying early transitional grades of the structure will seldom have\r\nsurvived to the present day, for they will have been supplanted by\r\ntheir successors, which were gradually rendered more perfect through\r\nnatural selection. Furthermore, we may conclude that transitional\r\nstates between structures fitted for very different habits of life will\r\nrarely have been developed at an early period in great numbers and\r\nunder many subordinate forms. Thus, to return to our imaginary\r\nillustration of the flying-fish, it does not seem probable that fishes\r\ncapable of true flight would have been developed under many subordinate\r\nforms, for taking prey of many kinds in many ways, on the land and in\r\nthe water, until their organs of flight had come to a high stage of\r\nperfection, so as to have given them a decided advantage over other\r\nanimals in the battle for life. Hence the chance of discovering species\r\nwith transitional grades of structure in a fossil condition will always\r\nbe less, from their having existed in lesser numbers, than in the case\r\nof species with fully developed structures.\r\n\r\nI will now give two or three instances, both of diversified and of\r\nchanged habits, in the individuals of the same species. In either case\r\nit would be easy for natural selection to adapt the structure of the\r\nanimal to its changed habits, or exclusively to one of its several\r\nhabits. It is, however, difficult to decide and immaterial for us,\r\nwhether habits generally change first and structure afterwards; or\r\nwhether slight modifications of structure lead to changed habits; both\r\nprobably often occurring almost simultaneously. Of cases of changed\r\nhabits it will suffice merely to allude to that of the many British\r\ninsects which now feed on exotic plants, or exclusively on artificial\r\nsubstances. Of diversified habits innumerable instances could be given:\r\nI have often watched a tyrant flycatcher (Saurophagus sulphuratus) in\r\nSouth America, hovering over one spot and then proceeding to another,\r\nlike a kestrel, and at other times standing stationary on the margin of\r\nwater, and then dashing into it like a kingfisher at a fish. In our own\r\ncountry the larger titmouse (Parus major) may be seen climbing\r\nbranches, almost like a creeper; it sometimes, like a shrike, kills\r\nsmall birds by blows on the head; and I have many times seen and heard\r\nit hammering the seeds of the yew on a branch, and thus breaking them\r\nlike a nuthatch. In North America the black bear was seen by Hearne\r\nswimming for hours with widely open mouth, thus catching, almost like a\r\nwhale, insects in the water.\r\n\r\nAs we sometimes see individuals following habits different from those\r\nproper to their species and to the other species of the same genus, we\r\nmight expect that such individuals would occasionally give rise to new\r\nspecies, having anomalous habits, and with their structure either\r\nslightly or considerably modified from that of their type. And such\r\ninstances occur in nature. Can a more striking instance of adaptation\r\nbe given than that of a woodpecker for climbing trees and seizing\r\ninsects in the chinks of the bark? Yet in North America there are\r\nwoodpeckers which feed largely on fruit, and others with elongated\r\nwings which chase insects on the wing. On the plains of La Plata, where\r\nhardly a tree grows, there is a woodpecker (Colaptes campestris) which\r\nhas two toes before and two behind, a long-pointed tongue, pointed\r\ntail-feathers, sufficiently stiff to support the bird in a vertical\r\nposition on a post, but not so stiff as in the typical wood-peckers,\r\nand a straight, strong beak. The beak, however, is not so straight or\r\nso strong as in the typical woodpeckers but it is strong enough to bore\r\ninto wood. Hence this Colaptes, in all the essential parts of its\r\nstructure, is a woodpecker. Even in such trifling characters as the\r\ncolouring, the harsh tone of the voice, and undulatory flight, its\r\nclose blood-relationship to our common woodpecker is plainly declared;\r\nyet, as I can assert, not only from my own observations, but from those\r\nof the accurate Azara, in certain large districts it does not climb\r\ntrees, and it makes its nest in holes in banks! In certain other\r\ndistricts, however, this same woodpecker, as Mr. Hudson states,\r\nfrequents trees, and bores holes in the trunk for its nest. I may\r\nmention as another illustration of the varied habits of this genus,\r\nthat a Mexican Colaptes has been described by De Saussure as boring\r\nholes into hard wood in order to lay up a store of acorns.\r\n\r\nPetrels are the most aërial and oceanic of birds, but, in the quiet\r\nsounds of Tierra del Fuego, the Puffinuria berardi, in its general\r\nhabits, in its astonishing power of diving, in its manner of swimming\r\nand of flying when made to take flight, would be mistaken by any one\r\nfor an auk or a grebe; nevertheless, it is essentially a petrel, but\r\nwith many parts of its organisation profoundly modified in relation to\r\nits new habits of life; whereas the woodpecker of La Plata has had its\r\nstructure only slightly modified. In the case of the water-ouzel, the\r\nacutest observer, by examining its dead body, would never have\r\nsuspected its sub-aquatic habits; yet this bird, which is allied to the\r\nthrush family, subsists by diving,—using its wings under water and\r\ngrasping stones with its feet. All the members of the great order of\r\nHymenopterous insects are terrestrial, excepting the genus\r\nProctotrupes, which Sir John Lubbock has discovered to be aquatic in\r\nits habits; it often enters the water and dives about by the use not of\r\nits legs but of its wings, and remains as long as four hours beneath\r\nthe surface; yet it exhibits no modification in structure in accordance\r\nwith its abnormal habits.\r\n\r\nHe who believes that each being has been created as we now see it, must\r\noccasionally have felt surprise when he has met with an animal having\r\nhabits and structure not in agreement. What can be plainer than that\r\nthe webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming? Yet there\r\nare upland geese with webbed feet which rarely go near the water; and\r\nno one except Audubon, has seen the frigate-bird, which has all its\r\nfour toes webbed, alight on the surface of the ocean. On the other\r\nhand, grebes and coots are eminently aquatic, although their toes are\r\nonly bordered by membrane. What seems plainer than that the long toes,\r\nnot furnished with membrane, of the Grallatores, are formed for walking\r\nover swamps and floating plants. The water-hen and landrail are members\r\nof this order, yet the first is nearly as aquatic as the coot, and the\r\nsecond is nearly as terrestrial as the quail or partridge. In such\r\ncases, and many others could be given, habits have changed without a\r\ncorresponding change of structure. The webbed feet of the upland goose\r\nmay be said to have become almost rudimentary in function, though not\r\nin structure. In the frigate-bird, the deeply scooped membrane between\r\nthe toes shows that structure has begun to change.\r\n\r\nHe who believes in separate and innumerable acts of creation may say,\r\nthat in these cases it has pleased the Creator to cause a being of one\r\ntype to take the place of one belonging to another type; but this seems\r\nto me only restating the fact in dignified language. He who believes in\r\nthe struggle for existence and in the principle of natural selection,\r\nwill acknowledge that every organic being is constantly endeavouring to\r\nincrease in numbers; and that if any one being varies ever so little,\r\neither in habits or structure, and thus gains an advantage over some\r\nother inhabitant of the same country, it will seize on the place of\r\nthat inhabitant, however different that may be from its own place.\r\nHence it will cause him no surprise that there should be geese and\r\nfrigate-birds with webbed feet, living on the dry land and rarely\r\nalighting on the water, that there should be long-toed corncrakes,\r\nliving in meadows instead of in swamps; that there should be\r\nwoodpeckers where hardly a tree grows; that there should be diving\r\nthrushes and diving Hymenoptera, and petrels with the habits of auks.\r\n\r\n_Organs of extreme Perfection and Complication._\r\n\r\n\r\nTo suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for\r\nadjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different\r\namounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic\r\naberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I\r\nfreely confess, absurd in the highest degree. When it was first said\r\nthat the sun stood still and the world turned round, the common sense\r\nof mankind declared the doctrine false; but the old saying of _Vox\r\npopuli, vox Dei_, as every philosopher knows, cannot be trusted in\r\nscience. Reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a simple and\r\nimperfect eye to one complex and perfect can be shown to exist, each\r\ngrade being useful to its possessor, as is certainly the case; if\r\nfurther, the eye ever varies and the variations be inherited, as is\r\nlikewise certainly the case; and if such variations should be useful to\r\nany animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of\r\nbelieving that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural\r\nselection, though insuperable by our imagination, should not be\r\nconsidered as subversive of the theory. How a nerve comes to be\r\nsensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than how life itself\r\noriginated; but I may remark that, as some of the lowest organisms in\r\nwhich nerves cannot be detected, are capable of perceiving light, it\r\ndoes not seem impossible that certain sensitive elements in their\r\nsarcode should become aggregated and developed into nerves, endowed\r\nwith this special sensibility.\r\n\r\nIn searching for the gradations through which an organ in any species\r\nhas been perfected, we ought to look exclusively to its lineal\r\nprogenitors; but this is scarcely ever possible, and we are forced to\r\nlook to other species and genera of the same group, that is to the\r\ncollateral descendants from the same parent-form, in order to see what\r\ngradations are possible, and for the chance of some gradations having\r\nbeen transmitted in an unaltered or little altered condition. But the\r\nstate of the same organ in distinct classes may incidentally throw\r\nlight on the steps by which it has been perfected.\r\n\r\nThe simplest organ which can be called an eye consists of an optic\r\nnerve, surrounded by pigment-cells and covered by translucent skin, but\r\nwithout any lens or other refractive body. We may, however, according\r\nto M. Jourdain, descend even a step lower and find aggregates of\r\npigment-cells, apparently serving as organs of vision, without any\r\nnerves, and resting merely on sarcodic tissue. Eyes of the above simple\r\nnature are not capable of distinct vision, and serve only to\r\ndistinguish light from darkness. In certain star-fishes, small\r\ndepressions in the layer of pigment which surrounds the nerve are\r\nfilled, as described by the author just quoted, with transparent\r\ngelatinous matter, projecting with a convex surface, like the cornea in\r\nthe higher animals. He suggests that this serves not to form an image,\r\nbut only to concentrate the luminous rays and render their perception\r\nmore easy. In this concentration of the rays we gain the first and by\r\nfar the most important step towards the formation of a true,\r\npicture-forming eye; for we have only to place the naked extremity of\r\nthe optic nerve, which in some of the lower animals lies deeply buried\r\nin the body, and in some near the surface, at the right distance from\r\nthe concentrating apparatus, and an image will be formed on it.\r\n\r\nIn the great class of the Articulata, we may start from an optic nerve\r\nsimply coated with pigment, the latter sometimes forming a sort of\r\npupil, but destitute of lens or other optical contrivance. With insects\r\nit is now known that the numerous facets on the cornea of their great\r\ncompound eyes form true lenses, and that the cones include curiously\r\nmodified nervous filaments. But these organs in the Articulata are so\r\nmuch diversified that Müller formerly made three main classes with\r\nseven subdivisions, besides a fourth main class of aggregated simple\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect on these facts, here given much too briefly, with\r\nrespect to the wide, diversified, and graduated range of structure in\r\nthe eyes of the lower animals; and when we bear in mind how small the\r\nnumber of all living forms must be in comparison with those which have\r\nbecome extinct, the difficulty ceases to be very great in believing\r\nthat natural selection may have converted the simple apparatus of an\r\noptic nerve, coated with pigment and invested by transparent membrane,\r\ninto an optical instrument as perfect as is possessed by any member of\r\nthe Articulata class.\r\n\r\nHe who will go thus far, ought not to hesitate to go one step further,\r\nif he finds on finishing this volume that large bodies of facts,\r\notherwise inexplicable, can be explained by the theory of modification\r\nthrough natural selection; he ought to admit that a structure even as\r\nperfect as an eagle’s eye might thus be formed, although in this case\r\nhe does not know the transitional states. It has been objected that in\r\norder to modify the eye and still preserve it as a perfect instrument,\r\nmany changes would have to be effected simultaneously, which, it is\r\nassumed, could not be done through natural selection; but as I have\r\nattempted to show in my work on the variation of domestic animals, it\r\nis not necessary to suppose that the modifications were all\r\nsimultaneous, if they were extremely slight and gradual. Different\r\nkinds of modification would, also, serve for the same general purpose:\r\nas Mr. Wallace has remarked, “If a lens has too short or too long a\r\nfocus, it may be amended either by an alteration of curvature, or an\r\nalteration of density; if the curvature be irregular, and the rays do\r\nnot converge to a point, then any increased regularity of curvature\r\nwill be an improvement. So the contraction of the iris and the muscular\r\nmovements of the eye are neither of them essential to vision, but only\r\nimprovements which might have been added and perfected at any stage of\r\nthe construction of the instrument.” Within the highest division of the\r\nanimal kingdom, namely, the Vertebrata, we can start from an eye so\r\nsimple, that it consists, as in the lancelet, of a little sack of\r\ntransparent skin, furnished with a nerve and lined with pigment, but\r\ndestitute of any other apparatus. In fishes and reptiles, as Owen has\r\nremarked, “The range of gradation of dioptric structures is very\r\ngreat.” It is a significant fact that even in man, according to the\r\nhigh authority of Virchow, the beautiful crystalline lens is formed in\r\nthe embryo by an accumulation of epidermic cells, lying in a sack-like\r\nfold of the skin; and the vitreous body is formed from embryonic\r\nsubcutaneous tissue. To arrive, however, at a just conclusion regarding\r\nthe formation of the eye, with all its marvellous yet not absolutely\r\nperfect characters, it is indispensable that the reason should conquer\r\nthe imagination; but I have felt the difficulty far to keenly to be\r\nsurprised at others hesitating to extend the principle of natural\r\nselection to so startling a length.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye with a telescope. We\r\nknow that this instrument has been perfected by the long-continued\r\nefforts of the highest human intellects; and we naturally infer that\r\nthe eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process. But may not\r\nthis inference be presumptuous? Have we any right to assume that the\r\nCreator works by intellectual powers like those of man? If we must\r\ncompare the eye to an optical instrument, we ought in imagination to\r\ntake a thick layer of transparent tissue, with spaces filled with\r\nfluid, and with a nerve sensitive to light beneath, and then suppose\r\nevery part of this layer to be continually changing slowly in density,\r\nso as to separate into layers of different densities and thicknesses,\r\nplaced at different distances from each other, and with the surfaces of\r\neach layer slowly changing in form. Further we must suppose that there\r\nis a power, represented by natural selection or the survival of the\r\nfittest, always intently watching each slight alteration in the\r\ntransparent layers; and carefully preserving each which, under varied\r\ncircumstances, in any way or degree, tends to produce a distincter\r\nimage. We must suppose each new state of the instrument to be\r\nmultiplied by the million; each to be preserved until a better is\r\nproduced, and then the old ones to be all destroyed. In living bodies,\r\nvariation will cause the slight alteration, generation will multiply\r\nthem almost infinitely, and natural selection will pick out with\r\nunerring skill each improvement. Let this process go on for millions of\r\nyears; and during each year on millions of individuals of many kinds;\r\nand may we not believe that a living optical instrument might thus be\r\nformed as superior to one of glass, as the works of the Creator are to\r\nthose of man?\r\n\r\n_Modes of Transition._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could\r\nnot possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight\r\nmodifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find\r\nout no such case. No doubt many organs exist of which we do not know\r\nthe transitional grades, more especially if we look to much-isolated\r\nspecies, around which, according to the theory, there has been much\r\nextinction. Or again, if we take an organ common to all the members of\r\na class, for in this latter case the organ must have been originally\r\nformed at a remote period, since which all the many members of the\r\nclass have been developed; and in order to discover the early\r\ntransitional grades through which the organ has passed, we should have\r\nto look to very ancient ancestral forms, long since become extinct.\r\n\r\nWe should be extremely cautious in concluding that an organ could not\r\nhave been formed by transitional gradations of some kind. Numerous\r\ncases could be given among the lower animals of the same organ\r\nperforming at the same time wholly distinct functions; thus in the\r\nlarva of the dragon-fly and in the fish Cobites the alimentary canal\r\nrespires, digests, and excretes. In the Hydra, the animal may be turned\r\ninside out, and the exterior surface will then digest and the stomach\r\nrespire. In such cases natural selection might specialise, if any\r\nadvantage were thus gained, the whole or part of an organ, which had\r\npreviously performed two functions, for one function alone, and thus by\r\ninsensible steps greatly change its nature. Many plants are known which\r\nregularly produce at the same time differently constructed flowers; and\r\nif such plants were to produce one kind alone, a great change would be\r\neffected with comparative suddenness in the character of the species.\r\nIt is, however, probable that the two sorts of flowers borne by the\r\nsame plant were originally differentiated by finely graduated steps,\r\nwhich may still be followed in some few cases.\r\n\r\nAgain, two distinct organs, or the same organ under two very different\r\nforms, may simultaneously perform in the same individual the same\r\nfunction, and this is an extremely important means of transition: to\r\ngive one instance—there are fish with gills or branchiæ that breathe\r\nthe air dissolved in the water, at the same time that they breathe free\r\nair in their swim-bladders, this latter organ being divided by highly\r\nvascular partitions and having a ductus pneumaticus for the supply of\r\nair. To give another instance from the vegetable kingdom: plants climb\r\nby three distinct means, by spirally twining, by clasping a support\r\nwith their sensitive tendrils, and by the emission of aërial rootlets;\r\nthese three means are usually found in distinct groups, but some few\r\nspecies exhibit two of the means, or even all three, combined in the\r\nsame individual. In all such cases one of the two organs might readily\r\nbe modified and perfected so as to perform all the work, being aided\r\nduring the progress of modification by the other organ; and then this\r\nother organ might be modified for some other and quite distinct\r\npurpose, or be wholly obliterated.\r\n\r\nThe illustration of the swim-bladder in fishes is a good one, because\r\nit shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally\r\nconstructed for one purpose, namely flotation, may be converted into\r\none for a widely different purpose, namely respiration. The\r\nswim-bladder has, also, been worked in as an accessory to the auditory\r\norgans of certain fishes. All physiologists admit that the swim-bladder\r\nis homologous, or “ideally similar” in position and structure with the\r\nlungs of the higher vertebrate animals: hence there is no reason to\r\ndoubt that the swim-bladder has actually been converted into lungs, or\r\nan organ used exclusively for respiration.\r\n\r\nAccording to this view it may be inferred that all vertebrate animals\r\nwith true lungs are descended by ordinary generation from an ancient\r\nand unknown prototype which was furnished with a floating apparatus or\r\nswim-bladder. We can thus, as I infer from Professor Owen’s interesting\r\ndescription of these parts, understand the strange fact that every\r\nparticle of food and drink which we swallow has to pass over the\r\norifice of the trachea, with some risk of falling into the lungs,\r\nnotwithstanding the beautiful contrivance by which the glottis is\r\nclosed. In the higher Vertebrata the branchiæ have wholly\r\ndisappeared—but in the embryo the slits on the sides of the neck and\r\nthe loop-like course of the arteries still mark their former position.\r\nBut it is conceivable that the now utterly lost branchiæ might have\r\nbeen gradually worked in by natural selection for some distinct\r\npurpose: for instance, Landois has shown that the wings of insects are\r\ndeveloped from the trachea; it is therefore highly probable that in\r\nthis great class organs which once served for respiration have been\r\nactually converted into organs for flight.\r\n\r\nIn considering transitions of organs, it is so important to bear in\r\nmind the probability of conversion from one function to another, that I\r\nwill give another instance. Pedunculated cirripedes have two minute\r\nfolds of skin, called by me the ovigerous frena, which serve, through\r\nthe means of a sticky secretion, to retain the eggs until they are\r\nhatched within the sack. These cirripedes have no branchiæ, the whole\r\nsurface of the body and of the sack, together with the small frena,\r\nserving for respiration. The Balanidæ or sessile cirripedes, on the\r\nother hand, have no ovigerous frena, the eggs lying loose at the bottom\r\nof the sack, within the well-enclosed shell; but they have, in the same\r\nrelative position with the frena, large, much-folded membranes, which\r\nfreely communicate with the circulatory lacunæ of the sack and body,\r\nand which have been considered by all naturalists to act as branchiæ.\r\nNow I think no one will dispute that the ovigerous frena in the one\r\nfamily are strictly homologous with the branchiæ of the other family;\r\nindeed, they graduate into each other. Therefore it need not be doubted\r\nthat the two little folds of skin, which originally served as ovigerous\r\nfrena, but which, likewise, very slightly aided in the act of\r\nrespiration, have been gradually converted by natural selection into\r\nbranchiæ, simply through an increase in their size and the obliteration\r\nof their adhesive glands. If all pedunculated cirripedes had become\r\nextinct, and they have suffered far more extinction than have sessile\r\ncirripedes, who would ever have imagined that the branchiæ in this\r\nlatter family had originally existed as organs for preventing the ova\r\nfrom being washed out of the sack?\r\n\r\nThere is another possible mode of transition, namely, through the\r\nacceleration or retardation of the period of reproduction. This has\r\nlately been insisted on by Professor Cope and others in the United\r\nStates. It is now known that some animals are capable of reproduction\r\nat a very early age, before they have acquired their perfect\r\ncharacters; and if this power became thoroughly well developed in a\r\nspecies, it seems probable that the adult stage of development would\r\nsooner or later be lost; and in this case, especially if the larva\r\ndiffered much from the mature form, the character of the species would\r\nbe greatly changed and degraded. Again, not a few animals, after\r\narriving at maturity, go on changing in character during nearly their\r\nwhole lives. With mammals, for instance, the form of the skull is often\r\nmuch altered with age, of which Dr. Murie has given some striking\r\ninstances with seals. Every one knows how the horns of stags become\r\nmore and more branched, and the plumes of some birds become more finely\r\ndeveloped, as they grow older. Professor Cope states that the teeth of\r\ncertain lizards change much in shape with advancing years. With\r\ncrustaceans not only many trivial, but some important parts assume a\r\nnew character, as recorded by Fritz Müller, after maturity. In all such\r\ncases—and many could be given—if the age for reproduction were\r\nretarded, the character of the species, at least in its adult state,\r\nwould be modified; nor is it improbable that the previous and earlier\r\nstages of development would in some cases be hurried through and\r\nfinally lost. Whether species have often or ever been modified through\r\nthis comparatively sudden mode of transition, I can form no opinion;\r\nbut if this has occurred, it is probable that the differences between\r\nthe young and the mature, and between the mature and the old, were\r\nprimordially acquired by graduated steps.\r\n\r\n_Special Diffculties of the Theory of Natural Selection._\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we must be extremely cautious in concluding that any organ\r\ncould not have been produced by successive, small, transitional\r\ngradations, yet undoubtedly serious cases of difficulty occur.\r\n\r\nOne of the most serious is that of neuter insects, which are often\r\ndifferently constructed from either the males or fertile females; but\r\nthis case will be treated of in the next chapter. The electric organs\r\nof fishes offer another case of special difficulty; for it is\r\nimpossible to conceive by what steps these wondrous organs have been\r\nproduced. But this is not surprising, for we do not even know of what\r\nuse they are. In the gymnotus and torpedo they no doubt serve as\r\npowerful means of defence, and perhaps for securing prey; yet in the\r\nray, as observed by Matteucci, an analogous organ in the tail manifests\r\nbut little electricity, even when the animal is greatly irritated; so\r\nlittle that it can hardly be of any use for the above purposes.\r\nMoreover, in the ray, besides the organ just referred to, there is, as\r\nDr. R. McDonnell has shown, another organ near the head, not known to\r\nbe electrical, but which appears to be the real homologue of the\r\nelectric battery in the torpedo. It is generally admitted that there\r\nexists between these organs and ordinary muscle a close analogy, in\r\nintimate structure, in the distribution of the nerves, and in the\r\nmanner in which they are acted on by various reagents. It should, also,\r\nbe especially observed that muscular contraction is accompanied by an\r\nelectrical discharge; and, as Dr. Radcliffe insists, “in the electrical\r\napparatus of the torpedo during rest, there would seem to be a charge\r\nin every respect like that which is met with in muscle and nerve during\r\nthe rest, and the discharge of the torpedo, instead of being peculiar,\r\nmay be only another form of the discharge which attends upon the action\r\nof muscle and motor nerve.” Beyond this we cannot at present go in the\r\nway of explanation; but as we know so little about the uses of these\r\norgans, and as we know nothing about the habits and structure of the\r\nprogenitors of the existing electric fishes, it would be extremely bold\r\nto maintain that no serviceable transitions are possible by which these\r\norgans might have been gradually developed.\r\n\r\nThese organs appear at first to offer another and far more serious\r\ndifficulty; for they occur in about a dozen kinds of fish, of which\r\nseveral are widely remote in their affinities. When the same organ is\r\nfound in several members of the same class, especially if in members\r\nhaving very different habits of life, we may generally attribute its\r\npresence to inheritance from a common ancestor; and its absence in some\r\nof the members to loss through disuse or natural selection. So that, if\r\nthe electric organs had been inherited from some one ancient\r\nprogenitor, we might have expected that all electric fishes would have\r\nbeen specially related to each other; but this is far from the case.\r\nNor does geology at all lead to the belief that most fishes formerly\r\npossessed electric organs, which their modified descendants have now\r\nlost. But when we look at the subject more closely, we find in the\r\nseveral fishes provided with electric organs, that these are situated\r\nin different parts of the body, that they differ in construction, as in\r\nthe arrangement of the plates, and, according to Pacini, in the process\r\nor means by which the electricity is excited—and lastly, in being\r\nsupplied with nerves proceeding from different sources, and this is\r\nperhaps the most important of all the differences. Hence in the several\r\nfishes furnished with electric organs, these cannot be considered as\r\nhomologous, but only as analogous in function. Consequently there is no\r\nreason to suppose that they have been inherited from a common\r\nprogenitor; for had this been the case they would have closely\r\nresembled each other in all respects. Thus the difficulty of an organ,\r\napparently the same, arising in several remotely allied species,\r\ndisappears, leaving only the lesser yet still great difficulty: namely,\r\nby what graduated steps these organs have been developed in each\r\nseparate group of fishes.\r\n\r\nThe luminous organs which occur in a few insects, belonging to widely\r\ndifferent families, and which are situated in different parts of the\r\nbody, offer, under our present state of ignorance, a difficulty almost\r\nexactly parallel with that of the electric organs. Other similar cases\r\ncould be given; for instance in plants, the very curious contrivance of\r\na mass of pollen-grains, borne on a foot-stalk with an adhesive gland,\r\nis apparently the same in Orchis and Asclepias, genera almost as remote\r\nas is possible among flowering plants; but here again the parts are not\r\nhomologous. In all cases of beings, far removed from each other in the\r\nscale of organisation, which are furnished with similar and peculiar\r\norgans, it will be found that although the general appearance and\r\nfunction of the organs may be the same, yet fundamental differences\r\nbetween them can always be detected. For instance, the eyes of\r\nCephalopods or cuttle-fish and of vertebrate animals appear wonderfully\r\nalike; and in such widely sundered groups no part of this resemblance\r\ncan be due to inheritance from a common progenitor. Mr. Mivart has\r\nadvanced this case as one of special difficulty, but I am unable to see\r\nthe force of his argument. An organ for vision must be formed of\r\ntransparent tissue, and must include some sort of lens for throwing an\r\nimage at the back of a darkened chamber. Beyond this superficial\r\nresemblance, there is hardly any real similarity between the eyes of\r\ncuttle-fish and vertebrates, as may be seen by consulting Hensen’s\r\nadmirable memoir on these organs in the Cephalopoda. It is impossible\r\nfor me here to enter on details, but I may specify a few of the points\r\nof difference. The crystalline lens in the higher cuttle-fish consists\r\nof two parts, placed one behind the other like two lenses, both having\r\na very different structure and disposition to what occurs in the\r\nvertebrata. The retina is wholly different, with an actual inversion of\r\nthe elemental parts, and with a large nervous ganglion included within\r\nthe membranes of the eye. The relations of the muscles are as different\r\nas it is possible to conceive, and so in other points. Hence it is not\r\na little difficult to decide how far even the same terms ought to be\r\nemployed in describing the eyes of the Cephalopoda and Vertebrata. It\r\nis, of course, open to any one to deny that the eye in either case\r\ncould have been developed through the natural selection of successive\r\nslight variations; but if this be admitted in the one case it is\r\nclearly possible in the other; and fundamental differences of structure\r\nin the visual organs of two groups might have been anticipated, in\r\naccordance with this view of their manner of formation. As two men have\r\nsometimes independently hit on the same invention, so in the several\r\nforegoing cases it appears that natural selection, working for the good\r\nof each being, and taking advantage of all favourable variations, has\r\nproduced similar organs, as far as function is concerned, in distinct\r\norganic beings, which owe none of their structure in common to\r\ninheritance from a common progenitor.\r\n\r\nFritz Müller, in order to test the conclusions arrived at in this\r\nvolume, has followed out with much care a nearly similar line of\r\nargument. Several families of crustaceans include a few species,\r\npossessing an air-breathing apparatus and fitted to live out of the\r\nwater. In two of these families, which were more especially examined by\r\nMüller, and which are nearly related to each other, the species agree\r\nmost closely in all important characters: namely in their sense organs,\r\ncirculating systems, in the position of the tufts of hair within their\r\ncomplex stomachs, and lastly in the whole structure of the\r\nwater-breathing branchiæ, even to the microscopical hooks by which they\r\nare cleansed. Hence it might have been expected that in the few species\r\nbelonging to both families which live on the land, the equally\r\nimportant air-breathing apparatus would have been the same; for why\r\nshould this one apparatus, given for the same purpose, have been made\r\nto differ, whilst all the other important organs were closely similar,\r\nor rather, identical.\r\n\r\nFritz Müller argues that this close similarity in so many points of\r\nstructure must, in accordance with the views advanced by me, be\r\naccounted for by inheritance from a common progenitor. But as the vast\r\nmajority of the species in the above two families, as well as most\r\nother crustaceans, are aquatic in their habits, it is improbable in the\r\nhighest degree that their common progenitor should have been adapted\r\nfor breathing air. Müller was thus led carefully to examine the\r\napparatus in the air-breathing species; and he found it to differ in\r\neach in several important points, as in the position of the orifices,\r\nin the manner in which they are opened and closed, and in some\r\naccessory details. Now such differences are intelligible, and might\r\neven have been expected, on the supposition that species belonging to\r\ndistinct families had slowly become adapted to live more and more out\r\nof water, and to breathe the air. For these species, from belonging to\r\ndistinct families, would have differed to a certain extent, and in\r\naccordance with the principle that the nature of each variation depends\r\non two factors, viz., the nature of the organism and that of the\r\nsurrounding conditions, their variability assuredly would not have been\r\nexactly the same. Consequently natural selection would have had\r\ndifferent materials or variations to work on, in order to arrive at the\r\nsame functional result; and the structures thus acquired would almost\r\nnecessarily have differed. On the hypothesis of separate acts of\r\ncreation the whole case remains unintelligible. This line of argument\r\nseems to have had great weight in leading Fritz Müller to accept the\r\nviews maintained by me in this volume.\r\n\r\nAnother distinguished zoologist, the late Professor Claparède, has\r\nargued in the same manner, and has arrived at the same result. He shows\r\nthat there are parasitic mites (Acaridæ), belonging to distinct\r\nsub-families and families, which are furnished with hair-claspers.\r\nThese organs must have been independently developed, as they could not\r\nhave been inherited from a common progenitor; and in the several groups\r\nthey are formed by the modification of the fore legs, of the hind legs,\r\nof the maxillæ or lips, and of appendages on the under side of the hind\r\npart of the body.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing cases, we see the same end gained and the same\r\nfunction performed, in beings not at all or only remotely allied, by\r\norgans in appearance, though not in development, closely similar. On\r\nthe other hand, it is a common rule throughout nature that the same end\r\nshould be gained, even sometimes in the case of closely related beings,\r\nby the most diversified means. How differently constructed is the\r\nfeathered wing of a bird and the membrane-covered wing of a bat; and\r\nstill more so the four wings of a butterfly, the two wings of a fly,\r\nand the two wings with the elytra of a beetle. Bivalve shells are made\r\nto open and shut, but on what a number of patterns is the hinge\r\nconstructed, from the long row of neatly interlocking teeth in a Nucula\r\nto the simple ligament of a Mussel! Seeds are disseminated by their\r\nminuteness, by their capsule being converted into a light balloon-like\r\nenvelope, by being embedded in pulp or flesh, formed of the most\r\ndiverse parts, and rendered nutritious, as well as conspicuously\r\ncoloured, so as to attract and be devoured by birds, by having hooks\r\nand grapnels of many kinds and serrated awns, so as to adhere to the\r\nfur of quadrupeds, and by being furnished with wings and plumes, as\r\ndifferent in shape as they are elegant in structure, so as to be wafted\r\nby every breeze. I will give one other instance: for this subject of\r\nthe same end being gained by the most diversified means well deserves\r\nattention. Some authors maintain that organic beings have been formed\r\nin many ways for the sake of mere variety, almost like toys in a shop,\r\nbut such a view of nature is incredible. With plants having separated\r\nsexes, and with those in which, though hermaphrodites, the pollen does\r\nnot spontaneously fall on the stigma, some aid is necessary for their\r\nfertilisation. With several kinds this is effected by the\r\npollen-grains, which are light and incoherent, being blown by the wind\r\nthrough mere chance on to the stigma; and this is the simplest plan\r\nwhich can well be conceived. An almost equally simple, though very\r\ndifferent plan occurs in many plants in which a symmetrical flower\r\nsecretes a few drops of nectar, and is consequently visited by insects;\r\nand these carry the pollen from the anthers to the stigma.\r\n\r\nFrom this simple stage we may pass through an inexhaustible number of\r\ncontrivances, all for the same purpose and effected in essentially the\r\nsame manner, but entailing changes in every part of the flower. The\r\nnectar may be stored in variously shaped receptacles, with the stamens\r\nand pistils modified in many ways, sometimes forming trap-like\r\ncontrivances, and sometimes capable of neatly adapted movements through\r\nirritability or elasticity. From such structures we may advance till we\r\ncome to such a case of extraordinary adaptation as that lately\r\ndescribed by Dr. Crüger in the Coryanthes. This orchid has part of its\r\nlabellum or lower lip hollowed out into a great bucket, into which\r\ndrops of almost pure water continually fall from two secreting horns\r\nwhich stand above it; and when the bucket is half-full, the water\r\noverflows by a spout on one side. The basal part of the labellum stands\r\nover the bucket, and is itself hollowed out into a sort of chamber with\r\ntwo lateral entrances; within this chamber there are curious fleshy\r\nridges. The most ingenious man, if he had not witnessed what takes\r\nplace, could never have imagined what purpose all these parts serve.\r\nBut Dr. Crüger saw crowds of large humble-bees visiting the gigantic\r\nflowers of this orchid, not in order to suck nectar, but to gnaw off\r\nthe ridges within the chamber above the bucket; in doing this they\r\nfrequently pushed each other into the bucket, and their wings being\r\nthus wetted they could not fly away, but were compelled to crawl out\r\nthrough the passage formed by the spout or overflow. Dr. Crüger saw a\r\n“continual procession” of bees thus crawling out of their involuntary\r\nbath. The passage is narrow, and is roofed over by the column, so that\r\na bee, in forcing its way out, first rubs its back against the viscid\r\nstigma and then against the viscid glands of the pollen-masses. The\r\npollen-masses are thus glued to the back of the bee which first happens\r\nto crawl out through the passage of a lately expanded flower, and are\r\nthus carried away. Dr. Crüger sent me a flower in spirits of wine, with\r\na bee which he had killed before it had quite crawled out, with a\r\npollen-mass still fastened to its back. When the bee, thus provided,\r\nflies to another flower, or to the same flower a second time, and is\r\npushed by its comrades into the bucket and then crawls out by the\r\npassage, the pollen-mass necessarily comes first into contact with the\r\nviscid stigma, and adheres to it, and the flower is fertilised. Now at\r\nlast we see the full use of every part of the flower, of the\r\nwater-secreting horns of the bucket half-full of water, which prevents\r\nthe bees from flying away, and forces them to crawl out through the\r\nspout, and rub against the properly placed viscid pollen-masses and the\r\nviscid stigma.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the flower in another closely allied orchid,\r\nnamely, the Catasetum, is widely different, though serving the same\r\nend; and is equally curious. Bees visit these flowers, like those of\r\nthe Coryanthes, in order to gnaw the labellum; in doing this they\r\ninevitably touch a long, tapering, sensitive projection, or, as I have\r\ncalled it, the antenna. This antenna, when touched, transmits a\r\nsensation or vibration to a certain membrane which is instantly\r\nruptured; this sets free a spring by which the pollen-mass is shot\r\nforth, like an arrow, in the right direction, and adheres by its viscid\r\nextremity to the back of the bee. The pollen-mass of the male plant\r\n(for the sexes are separate in this orchid) is thus carried to the\r\nflower of the female plant, where it is brought into contact with the\r\nstigma, which is viscid enough to break certain elastic threads, and\r\nretain the pollen, thus effecting fertilisation.\r\n\r\nHow, it may be asked, in the foregoing and in innumerable other\r\ninstances, can we understand the graduated scale of complexity and the\r\nmultifarious means for gaining the same end. The answer no doubt is, as\r\nalready remarked, that when two forms vary, which already differ from\r\neach other in some slight degree, the variability will not be of the\r\nsame exact nature, and consequently the results obtained through\r\nnatural selection for the same general purpose will not be the same. We\r\nshould also bear in mind that every highly developed organism has\r\npassed through many changes; and that each modified structure tends to\r\nbe inherited, so that each modification will not readily be quite lost,\r\nbut may be again and again further altered. Hence, the structure of\r\neach part of each species, for whatever purpose it may serve, is the\r\nsum of many inherited changes, through which the species has passed\r\nduring its successive adaptations to changed habits and conditions of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nFinally, then, although in many cases it is most difficult even to\r\nconjecture by what transitions organs could have arrived at their\r\npresent state; yet, considering how small the proportion of living and\r\nknown forms is to the extinct and unknown, I have been astonished how\r\nrarely an organ can be named, towards which no transitional grade is\r\nknown to lead. It is certainly true, that new organs appearing as if\r\ncreated for some special purpose rarely or never appear in any being;\r\nas indeed is shown by that old, but somewhat exaggerated, canon in\r\nnatural history of “Natura non facit saltum.” We meet with this\r\nadmission in the writings of almost every experienced naturalist; or,\r\nas Milne Edwards has well expressed it, “Nature is prodigal in variety,\r\nbut niggard in innovation.” Why, on the theory of Creation, should\r\nthere be so much variety and so little real novelty? Why should all the\r\nparts and organs of many independent beings, each supposed to have been\r\nseparately created for its own proper place in nature, be so commonly\r\nlinked together by graduated steps? Why should not Nature take a sudden\r\nleap from structure to structure? On the theory of natural selection,\r\nwe can clearly understand why she should not; for natural selection\r\nacts only by taking advantage of slight successive variations; she can\r\nnever take a great and sudden leap, but must advance by the short and\r\nsure, though slow steps.\r\n\r\n_Organs of little apparent Importance, as affected by Natural\r\nSelection._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs natural selection acts by life and death, by the survival of the\r\nfittest, and by the destruction of the less well-fitted individuals, I\r\nhave sometimes felt great difficulty in understanding the origin or\r\nformation of parts of little importance; almost as great, though of a\r\nvery different kind, as in the case of the most perfect and complex\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we are much too ignorant in regard to the whole\r\neconomy of any one organic being to say what slight modifications would\r\nbe of importance or not. In a former chapter I have given instances of\r\nvery trifling characters, such as the down on fruit and the colour of\r\nits flesh, the colour of the skin and hair of quadrupeds, which, from\r\nbeing correlated with constitutional differences, or from determining\r\nthe attacks of insects, might assuredly be acted on by natural\r\nselection. The tail of the giraffe looks like an artificially\r\nconstructed fly-flapper; and it seems at first incredible that this\r\ncould have been adapted for its present purpose by successive slight\r\nmodifications, each better and better fitted, for so trifling an object\r\nas to drive away flies; yet we should pause before being too positive\r\neven in this case, for we know that the distribution and existence of\r\ncattle and other animals in South America absolutely depend on their\r\npower of resisting the attacks of insects: so that individuals which\r\ncould by any means defend themselves from these small enemies, would be\r\nable to range into new pastures and thus gain a great advantage. It is\r\nnot that the larger quadrupeds are actually destroyed (except in some\r\nrare cases) by flies, but they are incessantly harassed and their\r\nstrength reduced, so that they are more subject to disease, or not so\r\nwell enabled in a coming dearth to search for food, or to escape from\r\nbeasts of prey.\r\n\r\nOrgans now of trifling importance have probably in some cases been of\r\nhigh importance to an early progenitor, and, after having been slowly\r\nperfected at a former period, have been transmitted to existing species\r\nin nearly the same state, although now of very slight use; but any\r\nactually injurious deviations in their structure would of course have\r\nbeen checked by natural selection. Seeing how important an organ of\r\nlocomotion the tail is in most aquatic animals, its general presence\r\nand use for many purposes in so many land animals, which in their lungs\r\nor modified swim-bladders betray their aquatic origin, may perhaps be\r\nthus accounted for. A well-developed tail having been formed in an\r\naquatic animal, it might subsequently come to be worked in for all\r\nsorts of purposes, as a fly-flapper, an organ of prehension, or as an\r\naid in turning, as in the case of the dog, though the aid in this\r\nlatter respect must be slight, for the hare, with hardly any tail, can\r\ndouble still more quickly.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, we may easily err in attributing importance to\r\ncharacters, and in believing that they have been developed through\r\nnatural selection. We must by no means overlook the effects of the\r\ndefinite action of changed conditions of life, of so-called spontaneous\r\nvariations, which seem to depend in a quite subordinate degree on the\r\nnature of the conditions, of the tendency to reversion to long-lost\r\ncharacters, of the complex laws of growth, such as of correlation,\r\ncomprehension, of the pressure of one part on another, &c., and finally\r\nof sexual selection, by which characters of use to one sex are often\r\ngained and then transmitted more or less perfectly to the other sex,\r\nthough of no use to the sex. But structures thus indirectly gained,\r\nalthough at first of no advantage to a species, may subsequently have\r\nbeen taken advantage of by its modified descendants, under new\r\nconditions of life and newly acquired habits.\r\n\r\nIf green woodpeckers alone had existed, and we did not know that there\r\nwere many black and pied kinds, I dare say that we should have thought\r\nthat the green colour was a beautiful adaptation to conceal this\r\ntree-frequenting bird from its enemies; and consequently that it was a\r\ncharacter of importance, and had been acquired through natural\r\nselection; as it is, the colour is probably in chief part due to sexual\r\nselection. A trailing palm in the Malay Archipelago climbs the loftiest\r\ntrees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooks clustered around the\r\nends of the branches, and this contrivance, no doubt, is of the highest\r\nservice to the plant; but as we see nearly similar hooks on many trees\r\nwhich are not climbers, and which, as there is reason to believe from\r\nthe distribution of the thorn-bearing species in Africa and South\r\nAmerica, serve as a defence against browsing quadrupeds, so the spikes\r\non the palm may at first have been developed for this object, and\r\nsubsequently have been improved and taken advantage of by the plant, as\r\nit underwent further modification and became a climber. The naked skin\r\non the head of a vulture is generally considered as a direct adaptation\r\nfor wallowing in putridity; and so it may be, or it may possibly be due\r\nto the direct action of putrid matter; but we should be very cautious\r\nin drawing any such inference, when we see that the skin on the head of\r\nthe clean-feeding male turkey is likewise naked. The sutures in the\r\nskulls of young mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation\r\nfor aiding parturition, and no doubt they facilitate, or may be\r\nindispensable for this act; but as sutures occur in the skulls of young\r\nbirds and reptiles, which have only to escape from a broken egg, we may\r\ninfer that this structure has arisen from the laws of growth, and has\r\nbeen taken advantage of in the parturition of the higher animals.\r\n\r\nWe are profoundly ignorant of the cause of each slight variation or\r\nindividual difference; and we are immediately made conscious of this by\r\nreflecting on the differences between the breeds of our domesticated\r\nanimals in different countries, more especially in the less civilized\r\ncountries, where there has been but little methodical selection.\r\nAnimals kept by savages in different countries often have to struggle\r\nfor their own subsistence, and are exposed to a certain extent to\r\nnatural selection, and individuals with slightly different\r\nconstitutions would succeed best under different climates. With cattle\r\nsusceptibility to the attacks of flies is correlated with colour, as is\r\nthe liability to be poisoned by certain plants; so that even colour\r\nwould be thus subjected to the action of natural selection. Some\r\nobservers are convinced that a damp climate affects the growth of the\r\nhair, and that with the hair the horns are correlated. Mountain breeds\r\nalways differ from lowland breeds; and a mountainous country would\r\nprobably affect the hind limbs from exercising them more, and possibly\r\neven the form of the pelvis; and then by the law of homologous\r\nvariation, the front limbs and the head would probably be affected. The\r\nshape, also, of the pelvis might affect by pressure the shape of\r\ncertain parts of the young in the womb. The laborious breathing\r\nnecessary in high regions tends, as we have good reason to believe, to\r\nincrease the size of the chest; and again correlation would come into\r\nplay. The effects of lessened exercise, together with abundant food, on\r\nthe whole organisation is probably still more important, and this, as\r\nH. von Nathusius has lately shown in his excellent Treatise, is\r\napparently one chief cause of the great modification which the breeds\r\nof swine have undergone. But we are far too ignorant to speculate on\r\nthe relative importance of the several known and unknown causes of\r\nvariation; and I have made these remarks only to show that, if we are\r\nunable to account for the characteristic differences of our several\r\ndomestic breeds, which nevertheless are generally admitted to have\r\narisen through ordinary generation from one or a few parent-stocks, we\r\nought not to lay too much stress on our ignorance of the precise cause\r\nof the slight analogous differences between true species.\r\n\r\n_Utilitarian Doctrine, how far true: Beauty, how acquired._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest lately\r\nmade by some naturalists against the utilitarian doctrine that every\r\ndetail of structure has been produced for the good of its possessor.\r\nThey believe that many structures have been created for the sake of\r\nbeauty, to delight man or the Creator (but this latter point is beyond\r\nthe scope of scientific discussion), or for the sake of mere variety, a\r\nview already discussed. Such doctrines, if true, would be absolutely\r\nfatal to my theory. I fully admit that many structures are now of no\r\ndirect use to their possessors, and may never have been of any use to\r\ntheir progenitors; but this does not prove that they were formed solely\r\nfor beauty or variety. No doubt the definite action of changed\r\nconditions, and the various causes of modifications, lately specified,\r\nhave all produced an effect, probably a great effect, independently of\r\nany advantage thus gained. But a still more important consideration is\r\nthat the chief part of the organisation of every living creature is due\r\nto inheritance; and consequently, though each being assuredly is well\r\nfitted for its place in nature, many structures have now no very close\r\nand direct relation to present habits of life. Thus, we can hardly\r\nbelieve that the webbed feet of the upland goose, or of the\r\nfrigate-bird, are of special use to these birds; we cannot believe that\r\nthe similar bones in the arm of the monkey, in the fore leg of the\r\nhorse, in the wing of the bat, and in the flipper of the seal, are of\r\nspecial use to these animals. We may safely attribute these structures\r\nto inheritance. But webbed feet no doubt were as useful to the\r\nprogenitor of the upland goose and of the frigate-bird, as they now are\r\nto the most aquatic of living birds. So we may believe that the\r\nprogenitor of the seal did not possess a flipper, but a foot with five\r\ntoes fitted for walking or grasping; and we may further venture to\r\nbelieve that the several bones in the limbs of the monkey, horse and\r\nbat, were originally developed, on the principle of utility, probably\r\nthrough the reduction of more numerous bones in the fin of some ancient\r\nfish-like progenitor of the whole class. It is scarcely possible to\r\ndecide how much allowance ought to be made for such causes of change,\r\nas the definite action of external conditions, so-called spontaneous\r\nvariations, and the complex laws of growth; but with these important\r\nexceptions, we may conclude that the structure of every living creature\r\neither now is, or was formerly, of some direct or indirect use to its\r\npossessor.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the belief that organic beings have been created\r\nbeautiful for the delight of man—a belief which it has been pronounced\r\nis subversive of my whole theory—I may first remark that the sense of\r\nbeauty obviously depends on the nature of the mind, irrespective of any\r\nreal quality in the admired object; and that the idea of what is\r\nbeautiful, is not innate or unalterable. We see this, for instance, in\r\nthe men of different races admiring an entirely different standard of\r\nbeauty in their women. If beautiful objects had been created solely for\r\nman’s gratification, it ought to be shown that before man appeared\r\nthere was less beauty on the face of the earth than since he came on\r\nthe stage. Were the beautiful volute and cone shells of the Eocene\r\nepoch, and the gracefully sculptured ammonites of the Secondary period,\r\ncreated that man might ages afterwards admire them in his cabinet? Few\r\nobjects are more beautiful than the minute siliceous cases of the\r\ndiatomaceæ: were these created that they might be examined and admired\r\nunder the higher powers of the microscope? The beauty in this latter\r\ncase, and in many others, is apparently wholly due to symmetry of\r\ngrowth. Flowers rank among the most beautiful productions of nature;\r\nbut they have been rendered conspicuous in contrast with the green\r\nleaves, and in consequence at the same time beautiful, so that they may\r\nbe easily observed by insects. I have come to this conclusion from\r\nfinding it an invariable rule that when a flower is fertilised by the\r\nwind it never has a gaily-coloured corolla. Several plants habitually\r\nproduce two kinds of flowers; one kind open and coloured so as to\r\nattract insects; the other closed, not coloured, destitute of nectar,\r\nand never visited by insects. Hence, we may conclude that, if insects\r\nhad not been developed on the face of the earth, our plants would not\r\nhave been decked with beautiful flowers, but would have produced only\r\nsuch poor flowers as we see on our fir, oak, nut and ash trees, on\r\ngrasses, spinach, docks and nettles, which are all fertilised through\r\nthe agency of the wind. A similar line of argument holds good with\r\nfruits; that a ripe strawberry or cherry is as pleasing to the eye as\r\nto the palate—that the gaily-coloured fruit of the spindle-wood tree\r\nand the scarlet berries of the holly are beautiful objects—will be\r\nadmitted by everyone. But this beauty serves merely as a guide to birds\r\nand beasts, in order that the fruit may be devoured and the matured\r\nseeds disseminated. I infer that this is the case from having as yet\r\nfound no exception to the rule that seeds are always thus disseminated\r\nwhen embedded within a fruit of any kind (that is within a fleshy or\r\npulpy envelope), if it be coloured of any brilliant tint, or rendered\r\nconspicuous by being white or black.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I willingly admit that a great number of male\r\nanimals, as all our most gorgeous birds, some fishes, reptiles, and\r\nmammals, and a host of magnificently coloured butterflies, have been\r\nrendered beautiful for beauty’s sake. But this has been effected\r\nthrough sexual selection, that is, by the more beautiful males having\r\nbeen continually preferred by the females, and not for the delight of\r\nman. So it is with the music of birds. We may infer from all this that\r\na nearly similar taste for beautiful colours and for musical sounds\r\nruns through a large part of the animal kingdom. When the female is as\r\nbeautifully coloured as the male, which is not rarely the case with\r\nbirds and butterflies, the cause apparently lies in the colours\r\nacquired through sexual selection having been transmitted to both\r\nsexes, instead of to the males alone. How the sense of beauty in its\r\nsimplest form—that is, the reception of a peculiar kind of pleasure\r\nfrom certain colours, forms and sounds—was first developed in the mind\r\nof man and of the lower animals, is a very obscure subject. The same\r\nsort of difficulty is presented if we enquire how it is that certain\r\nflavours and odours give pleasure, and others displeasure. Habit in all\r\nthese cases appears to have come to a certain extent into play; but\r\nthere must be some fundamental cause in the constitution of the nervous\r\nsystem in each species.\r\n\r\nNatural selection cannot possibly produce any modification in a species\r\nexclusively for the good of another species; though throughout nature\r\none species incessantly takes advantage of, and profits by the\r\nstructures of others. But natural selection can and does often produce\r\nstructures for the direct injury of other animals, as we see in the\r\nfang of the adder, and in the ovipositor of the ichneumon, by which its\r\neggs are deposited in the living bodies of other insects. If it could\r\nbe proved that any part of the structure of any one species had been\r\nformed for the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate\r\nmy theory, for such could not have been produced through natural\r\nselection. Although many statements may be found in works on natural\r\nhistory to this effect, I cannot find even one which seems to me of any\r\nweight. It is admitted that the rattlesnake has a poison-fang for its\r\nown defence and for the destruction of its prey; but some authors\r\nsuppose that at the same time it is furnished with a rattle for its own\r\ninjury, namely, to warn its prey. I would almost as soon believe that\r\nthe cat curls the end of its tail when preparing to spring, in order to\r\nwarn the doomed mouse. It is a much more probable view that the\r\nrattlesnake uses its rattle, the cobra expands its frill and the\r\npuff-adder swells while hissing so loudly and harshly, in order to\r\nalarm the many birds and beasts which are known to attack even the most\r\nvenomous species. Snakes act on the same principle which makes the hen\r\nruffle her feathers and expand her wings when a dog approaches her\r\nchickens. But I have not space here to enlarge on the many ways by\r\nwhich animals endeavour to frighten away their enemies.\r\n\r\nNatural selection will never produce in a being any structure more\r\ninjurious than beneficial to that being, for natural selection acts\r\nsolely by and for the good of each. No organ will be formed, as Paley\r\nhas remarked, for the purpose of causing pain or for doing an injury to\r\nits possessor. If a fair balance be struck between the good and evil\r\ncaused by each part, each will be found on the whole advantageous.\r\nAfter the lapse of time, under changing conditions of life, if any part\r\ncomes to be injurious, it will be modified; or if it be not so, the\r\nbeing will become extinct, as myriads have become extinct.\r\n\r\nNatural selection tends only to make each organic being as perfect as,\r\nor slightly more perfect than the other inhabitants of the same country\r\nwith which it comes into competition. And we see that this is the\r\nstandard of perfection attained under nature. The endemic productions\r\nof New Zealand, for instance, are perfect, one compared with another;\r\nbut they are now rapidly yielding before the advancing legions of\r\nplants and animals introduced from Europe. Natural selection will not\r\nproduce absolute perfection, nor do we always meet, as far as we can\r\njudge, with this high standard under nature. The correction for the\r\naberration of light is said by Müller not to be perfect even in that\r\nmost perfect organ, the human eye. Helmholtz, whose judgment no one\r\nwill dispute, after describing in the strongest terms the wonderful\r\npowers of the human eye, adds these remarkable words: “That which we\r\nhave discovered in the way of inexactness and imperfection in the\r\noptical machine and in the image on the retina, is as nothing in\r\ncomparison with the incongruities which we have just come across in the\r\ndomain of the sensations. One might say that nature has taken delight\r\nin accumulating contradictions in order to remove all foundation from\r\nthe theory of a pre-existing harmony between the external and internal\r\nworlds.” If our reason leads us to admire with enthusiasm a multitude\r\nof inimitable contrivances in nature, this same reason tells us, though\r\nwe may easily err on both sides, that some other contrivances are less\r\nperfect. Can we consider the sting of the bee as perfect, which, when\r\nused against many kinds of enemies, cannot be withdrawn, owing to the\r\nbackward serratures, and thus inevitably causes the death of the insect\r\nby tearing out its viscera?\r\n\r\nIf we look at the sting of the bee, as having existed in a remote\r\nprogenitor, as a boring and serrated instrument, like that in so many\r\nmembers of the same great order, and that it has since been modified\r\nbut not perfected for its present purpose, with the poison originally\r\nadapted for some other object, such as to produce galls, since\r\nintensified, we can perhaps understand how it is that the use of the\r\nsting should so often cause the insect’s own death: for if on the whole\r\nthe power of stinging be useful to the social community, it will fulfil\r\nall the requirements of natural selection, though it may cause the\r\ndeath of some few members. If we admire the truly wonderful power of\r\nscent by which the males of many insects find their females, can we\r\nadmire the production for this single purpose of thousands of drones,\r\nwhich are utterly useless to the community for any other purpose, and\r\nwhich are ultimately slaughtered by their industrious and sterile\r\nsisters? It may be difficult, but we ought to admire the savage\r\ninstinctive hatred of the queen-bee, which urges her to destroy the\r\nyoung queens, her daughters, as soon as they are born, or to perish\r\nherself in the combat; for undoubtedly this is for the good of the\r\ncommunity; and maternal love or maternal hatred, though the latter\r\nfortunately is most rare, is all the same to the inexorable principles\r\nof natural selection. If we admire the several ingenious contrivances\r\nby which orchids and many other plants are fertilised through insect\r\nagency, can we consider as equally perfect the elaboration of dense\r\nclouds of pollen by our fir-trees, so that a few granules may be wafted\r\nby chance on to the ovules?\r\n\r\n_Summary: the Law of Unity of Type and of the Conditions of Existence\r\nembraced by the Theory of Natural Selection._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have in this chapter discussed some of the difficulties and\r\nobjections which may be urged against the theory. Many of them are\r\nserious; but I think that in the discussion light has been thrown on\r\nseveral facts, which on the belief of independent acts of creation are\r\nutterly obscure. We have seen that species at any one period are not\r\nindefinitely variable, and are not linked together by a multitude of\r\nintermediate gradations, partly because the process of natural\r\nselection is always very slow, and at any one time acts only on a few\r\nforms; and partly because the very process of natural selection implies\r\nthe continual supplanting and extinction of preceding and intermediate\r\ngradations. Closely allied species, now living on a continuous area,\r\nmust often have been formed when the area was not continuous, and when\r\nthe conditions of life did not insensibly graduate away from one part\r\nto another. When two varieties are formed in two districts of a\r\ncontinuous area, an intermediate variety will often be formed, fitted\r\nfor an intermediate zone; but from reasons assigned, the intermediate\r\nvariety will usually exist in lesser numbers than the two forms which\r\nit connects; consequently the two latter, during the course of further\r\nmodification, from existing in greater numbers, will have a great\r\nadvantage over the less numerous intermediate variety, and will thus\r\ngenerally succeed in supplanting and exterminating it.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in this chapter how cautious we should be in concluding\r\nthat the most different habits of life could not graduate into each\r\nother; that a bat, for instance, could not have been formed by natural\r\nselection from an animal which at first only glided through the air.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that a species under new conditions of life may change its\r\nhabits, or it may have diversified habits, with some very unlike those\r\nof its nearest congeners. Hence we can understand, bearing in mind that\r\neach organic being is trying to live wherever it can live, how it has\r\narisen that there are upland geese with webbed feet, ground\r\nwoodpeckers, diving thrushes, and petrels with the habits of auks.\r\n\r\nAlthough the belief that an organ so perfect as the eye could have been\r\nformed by natural selection, is enough to stagger any one; yet in the\r\ncase of any organ, if we know of a long series of gradations in\r\ncomplexity, each good for its possessor, then under changing conditions\r\nof life, there is no logical impossibility in the acquirement of any\r\nconceivable degree of perfection through natural selection. In the\r\ncases in which we know of no intermediate or transitional states, we\r\nshould be extremely cautious in concluding that none can have existed,\r\nfor the metamorphoses of many organs show what wonderful changes in\r\nfunction are at least possible. For instance, a swim-bladder has\r\napparently been converted into an air-breathing lung. The same organ\r\nhaving performed simultaneously very different functions, and then\r\nhaving been in part or in whole specialised for one function; and two\r\ndistinct organs having performed at the same time the same function,\r\nthe one having been perfected whilst aided by the other, must often\r\nhave largely facilitated transitions.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in two beings widely remote from each other in the\r\nnatural scale, organs serving for the same purpose and in external\r\nappearance closely similar may have been separately and independently\r\nformed; but when such organs are closely examined, essential\r\ndifferences in their structure can almost always be detected; and this\r\nnaturally follows from the principle of natural selection. On the other\r\nhand, the common rule throughout nature is infinite diversity of\r\nstructure for gaining the same end; and this again naturally follows\r\nfrom the same great principle.\r\n\r\nIn many cases we are far too ignorant to be enabled to assert that a\r\npart or organ is so unimportant for the welfare of a species, that\r\nmodifications in its structure could not have been slowly accumulated\r\nby means of natural selection. In many other cases, modifications are\r\nprobably the direct result of the laws of variation or of growth,\r\nindependently of any good having been thus gained. But even such\r\nstructures have often, as we may feel assured, been subsequently taken\r\nadvantage of, and still further modified, for the good of species under\r\nnew conditions of life. We may, also, believe that a part formerly of\r\nhigh importance has frequently been retained (as the tail of an aquatic\r\nanimal by its terrestrial descendants), though it has become of such\r\nsmall importance that it could not, in its present state, have been\r\nacquired by means of natural selection.\r\n\r\nNatural selection can produce nothing in one species for the exclusive\r\ngood or injury of another; though it may well produce parts, organs,\r\nand excretions highly useful or even indispensable, or highly injurious\r\nto another species, but in all cases at the same time useful to the\r\npossessor. In each well-stocked country natural selection acts through\r\nthe competition of the inhabitants and consequently leads to success in\r\nthe battle for life, only in accordance with the standard of that\r\nparticular country. Hence the inhabitants of one country, generally the\r\nsmaller one, often yield to the inhabitants of another and generally\r\nthe larger country. For in the larger country there will have existed\r\nmore individuals, and more diversified forms, and the competition will\r\nhave been severer, and thus the standard of perfection will have been\r\nrendered higher. Natural selection will not necessarily lead to\r\nabsolute perfection; nor, as far as we can judge by our limited\r\nfaculties, can absolute perfection be everywhere predicated.\r\n\r\nOn the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand the full\r\nmeaning of that old canon in natural history, “Natura non facit\r\nsaltum.” This canon, if we look to the present inhabitants alone of the\r\nworld, is not strictly correct; but if we include all those of past\r\ntimes, whether known or unknown, it must on this theory be strictly\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nIt is generally acknowledged that all organic beings have been formed\r\non two great laws—Unity of Type, and the Conditions of Existence. By\r\nunity of type is meant that fundamental agreement in structure which we\r\nsee in organic beings of the same class, and which is quite independent\r\nof their habits of life. On my theory, unity of type is explained by\r\nunity of descent. The expression of conditions of existence, so often\r\ninsisted on by the illustrious Cuvier, is fully embraced by the\r\nprinciple of natural selection. For natural selection acts by either\r\nnow adapting the varying parts of each being to its organic and\r\ninorganic conditions of life; or by having adapted them during past\r\nperiods of time: the adaptations being aided in many cases by the\r\nincreased use or disuse of parts, being affected by the direct action\r\nof external conditions of life, and subjected in all cases to the\r\nseveral laws of growth and variation. Hence, in fact, the law of the\r\nConditions of Existence is the higher law; as it includes, through the\r\ninheritance of former variations and adaptations, that of Unity of\r\nType.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nMISCELLANEOUS OBJECTIONS TO THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nLongevity—Modifications not necessarily simultaneous—Modifications\r\napparently of no direct service—Progressive development—Characters of\r\nsmall functional importance, the most constant—Supposed incompetence of\r\nnatural selection to account for the incipient stages of useful\r\nstructures—Causes which interfere with the acquisition through natural\r\nselection of useful structures—Gradations of structure with changed\r\nfunctions—Widely different organs in members of the same class,\r\ndeveloped from one and the same source—Reasons for disbelieving in\r\ngreat and abrupt modifications.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will devote this chapter to the consideration of various\r\nmiscellaneous objections which have been advanced against my views, as\r\nsome of the previous discussions may thus be made clearer; but it would\r\nbe useless to discuss all of them, as many have been made by writers\r\nwho have not taken the trouble to understand the subject. Thus a\r\ndistinguished German naturalist has asserted that the weakest part of\r\nmy theory is, that I consider all organic beings as imperfect: what I\r\nhave really said is, that all are not as perfect as they might have\r\nbeen in relation to their conditions; and this is shown to be the case\r\nby so many native forms in many quarters of the world having yielded\r\ntheir places to intruding foreigners. Nor can organic beings, even if\r\nthey were at any one time perfectly adapted to their conditions of\r\nlife, have remained so, when their conditions changed, unless they\r\nthemselves likewise changed; and no one will dispute that the physical\r\nconditions of each country, as well as the number and kinds of its\r\ninhabitants, have undergone many mutations.\r\n\r\nA critic has lately insisted, with some parade of mathematical\r\naccuracy, that longevity is a great advantage to all species, so that\r\nhe who believes in natural selection “must arrange his genealogical\r\ntree” in such a manner that all the descendants have longer lives than\r\ntheir progenitors! Cannot our critics conceive that a biennial plant or\r\none of the lower animals might range into a cold climate and perish\r\nthere every winter; and yet, owing to advantages gained through natural\r\nselection, survive from year to year by means of its seeds or ova? Mr.\r\nE. Ray Lankester has recently discussed this subject, and he concludes,\r\nas far as its extreme complexity allows him to form a judgment, that\r\nlongevity is generally related to the standard of each species in the\r\nscale of organisation, as well as to the amount of expenditure in\r\nreproduction and in general activity. And these conditions have, it is\r\nprobable, been largely determined through natural selection.\r\n\r\nIt has been argued that, as none of the animals and plants of Egypt, of\r\nwhich we know anything, have changed during the last three or four\r\nthousand years, so probably have none in any part of the world. But, as\r\nMr. G.H. Lewes has remarked, this line of argument proves too much, for\r\nthe ancient domestic races figured on the Egyptian monuments, or\r\nembalmed, are closely similar or even identical with those now living;\r\nyet all naturalists admit that such races have been produced through\r\nthe modification of their original types. The many animals which have\r\nremained unchanged since the commencement of the glacial period, would\r\nhave been an incomparably stronger case, for these have been exposed to\r\ngreat changes of climate and have migrated over great distances;\r\nwhereas, in Egypt, during the last several thousand years, the\r\nconditions of life, as far as we know, have remained absolutely\r\nuniform. The fact of little or no modification having been effected\r\nsince the glacial period, would have been of some avail against those\r\nwho believe in an innate and necessary law of development, but is\r\npowerless against the doctrine of natural selection or the survival of\r\nthe fittest, which implies that when variations or individual\r\ndifferences of a beneficial nature happen to arise, these will be\r\npreserved; but this will be effected only under certain favourable\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated palæontologist, Bronn, at the close of his German\r\ntranslation of this work, asks how, on the principle of natural\r\nselection, can a variety live side by side with the parent species? If\r\nboth have become fitted for slightly different habits of life or\r\nconditions, they might live together; and if we lay on one side\r\npolymorphic species, in which the variability seems to be of a peculiar\r\nnature, and all mere temporary variations, such as size, albinism, &c.,\r\nthe more permanent varieties are generally found, as far as I can\r\ndiscover, inhabiting distinct stations, such as high land or low land,\r\ndry or moist districts. Moreover, in the case of animals which wander\r\nmuch about and cross freely, their varieties seem to be generally\r\nconfined to distinct regions.\r\n\r\nBronn also insists that distinct species never differ from each other\r\nin single characters, but in many parts; and he asks, how it always\r\ncomes that many parts of the organisation should have been modified at\r\nthe same time through variation and natural selection? But there is no\r\nnecessity for supposing that all the parts of any being have been\r\nsimultaneously modified. The most striking modifications, excellently\r\nadapted for some purpose, might, as was formerly remarked, be acquired\r\nby successive variations, if slight, first in one part and then in\r\nanother; and as they would be transmitted all together, they would\r\nappear to us as if they had been simultaneously developed. The best\r\nanswer, however, to the above objection is afforded by those domestic\r\nraces which have been modified, chiefly through man’s power of\r\nselection, for some special purpose. Look at the race and dray-horse,\r\nor at the greyhound and mastiff. Their whole frames, and even their\r\nmental characteristics, have been modified; but if we could trace each\r\nstep in the history of their transformation—and the latter steps can be\r\ntraced—we should not see great and simultaneous changes, but first one\r\npart and then another slightly modified and improved. Even when\r\nselection has been applied by man to some one character alone—of which\r\nour cultivated plants offer the best instances—it will invariably be\r\nfound that although this one part, whether it be the flower, fruit, or\r\nleaves, has been greatly changed, almost all the other parts have been\r\nslightly modified. This may be attributed partly to the principle of\r\ncorrelated growth, and partly to so-called spontaneous variation.\r\n\r\nA much more serious objection has been urged by Bronn, and recently by\r\nBroca, namely, that many characters appear to be of no service whatever\r\nto their possessors, and therefore cannot have been influenced through\r\nnatural selection. Bronn adduces the length of the ears and tails in\r\nthe different species of hares and mice—the complex folds of enamel in\r\nthe teeth of many animals, and a multitude of analogous cases. With\r\nrespect to plants, this subject has been discussed by Nägeli in an\r\nadmirable essay. He admits that natural selection has effected much,\r\nbut he insists that the families of plants differ chiefly from each\r\nother in morphological characters, which appear to be quite unimportant\r\nfor the welfare of the species. He consequently believes in an innate\r\ntendency towards progressive and more perfect development. He specifies\r\nthe arrangement of the cells in the tissues, and of the leaves on the\r\naxis, as cases in which natural selection could not have acted. To\r\nthese may be added the numerical divisions in the parts of the flower,\r\nthe position of the ovules, the shape of the seed, when not of any use\r\nfor dissemination, &c.\r\n\r\nThere is much force in the above objection. Nevertheless, we ought, in\r\nthe first place, to be extremely cautious in pretending to decide what\r\nstructures now are, or have formerly been, of use to each species. In\r\nthe second place, it should always be borne in mind that when one part\r\nis modified, so will be other parts, through certain dimly seen causes,\r\nsuch as an increased or diminished flow of nutriment to a part, mutual\r\npressure, an early developed part affecting one subsequently developed,\r\nand so forth—as well as through other causes which lead to the many\r\nmysterious cases of correlation, which we do not in the least\r\nunderstand. These agencies may be all grouped together, for the sake of\r\nbrevity, under the expression of the laws of growth. In the third\r\nplace, we have to allow for the direct and definite action of changed\r\nconditions of life, and for so-called spontaneous variations, in which\r\nthe nature of the conditions apparently plays a quite subordinate part.\r\nBud-variations, such as the appearance of a moss-rose on a common rose,\r\nor of a nectarine on a peach-tree, offer good instances of spontaneous\r\nvariations; but even in these cases, if we bear in mind the power of a\r\nminute drop of poison in producing complex galls, we ought not to feel\r\ntoo sure that the above variations are not the effect of some local\r\nchange in the nature of the sap, due to some change in the conditions.\r\nThere must be some efficient cause for each slight individual\r\ndifference, as well as for more strongly marked variations which\r\noccasionally arise; and if the unknown cause were to act persistently,\r\nit is almost certain that all the individuals of the species would be\r\nsimilarly modified.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier editions of this work I underrated, as it now seems\r\nprobable, the frequency and importance of modifications due to\r\nspontaneous variability. But it is impossible to attribute to this\r\ncause the innumerable structures which are so well adapted to the\r\nhabits of life of each species. I can no more believe in this than that\r\nthe well-adapted form of a race-horse or greyhound, which before the\r\nprinciple of selection by man was well understood, excited so much\r\nsurprise in the minds of the older naturalists, can thus be explained.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while to illustrate some of the foregoing remarks. With\r\nrespect to the assumed inutility of various parts and organs, it is\r\nhardly necessary to observe that even in the higher and best-known\r\nanimals many structures exist, which are so highly developed that no\r\none doubts that they are of importance, yet their use has not been, or\r\nhas only recently been, ascertained. As Bronn gives the length of the\r\nears and tail in the several species of mice as instances, though\r\ntrifling ones, of differences in structure which can be of no special\r\nuse, I may mention that, according to Dr. Schöbl, the external ears of\r\nthe common mouse are supplied in an extraordinary manner with nerves,\r\nso that they no doubt serve as tactile organs; hence the length of the\r\nears can hardly be quite unimportant. We shall, also, presently see\r\nthat the tail is a highly useful prehensile organ to some of the\r\nspecies; and its use would be much influence by its length.\r\n\r\nWith respect to plants, to which on account of Nägeli’s essay I shall\r\nconfine myself in the following remarks, it will be admitted that the\r\nflowers of the orchids present a multitude of curious structures, which\r\na few years ago would have been considered as mere morphological\r\ndifferences without any special function; but they are now known to be\r\nof the highest importance for the fertilisation of the species through\r\nthe aid of insects, and have probably been gained through natural\r\nselection. No one until lately would have imagined that in dimorphic\r\nand trimorphic plants the different lengths of the stamens and pistils,\r\nand their arrangement, could have been of any service, but now we know\r\nthis to be the case.\r\n\r\nIn certain whole groups of plants the ovules stand erect, and in others\r\nthey are suspended; and within the same ovarium of some few plants, one\r\novule holds the former and a second ovule the latter position. These\r\npositions seem at first purely morphological, or of no physiological\r\nsignification; but Dr. Hooker informs me that within the same ovarium\r\nthe upper ovules alone in some cases, and in others the lower ones\r\nalone are fertilised; and he suggests that this probably depends on the\r\ndirection in which the pollen-tubes enter the ovarium. If so, the\r\nposition of the ovules, even when one is erect and the other suspended\r\nwithin the same ovarium, would follow the selection of any slight\r\ndeviations in position which favoured their fertilisation, and the\r\nproduction of seed.\r\n\r\nSeveral plants belonging to distinct orders habitually produce flowers\r\nof two kinds—the one open, of the ordinary structure, the other closed\r\nand imperfect. These two kinds of flowers sometimes differ wonderfully\r\nin structure, yet may be seen to graduate into each other on the same\r\nplant. The ordinary and open flowers can be intercrossed; and the\r\nbenefits which certainly are derived from this process are thus\r\nsecured. The closed and imperfect flowers are, however, manifestly of\r\nhigh importance, as they yield with the utmost safety a large stock of\r\nseed, with the expenditure of wonderfully little pollen. The two kinds\r\nof flowers often differ much, as just stated, in structure. The petals\r\nin the imperfect flowers almost always consist of mere rudiments, and\r\nthe pollen-grains are reduced in diameter. In Ononis columnæ five of\r\nthe alternate stamens are rudimentary; and in some species of Viola\r\nthree stamens are in this state, two retaining their proper function,\r\nbut being of very small size. In six out of thirty of the closed\r\nflowers in an Indian violet (name unknown, for the plants have never\r\nproduced with me perfect flowers), the sepals are reduced from the\r\nnormal number of five to three. In one section of the Malpighiaceæ the\r\nclosed flowers, according to A. de Jussieu, are still further modified,\r\nfor the five stamens which stand opposite to the sepals are all\r\naborted, a sixth stamen standing opposite to a petal being alone\r\ndeveloped; and this stamen is not present in the ordinary flowers of\r\nthis species; the style is aborted; and the ovaria are reduced from\r\nthree to two. Now although natural selection may well have had the\r\npower to prevent some of the flowers from expanding, and to reduce the\r\namount of pollen, when rendered by the closure of the flowers\r\nsuperfluous, yet hardly any of the above special modifications can have\r\nbeen thus determined, but must have followed from the laws of growth,\r\nincluding the functional inactivity of parts, during the progress of\r\nthe reduction of the pollen and the closure of the flowers.\r\n\r\nIt is so necessary to appreciate the important effects of the laws of\r\ngrowth, that I will give some additional cases of another kind, namely\r\nof differences in the same part or organ, due to differences in\r\nrelative position on the same plant. In the Spanish chestnut, and in\r\ncertain fir-trees, the angles of divergence of the leaves differ,\r\naccording to Schacht, in the nearly horizontal and in the upright\r\nbranches. In the common rue and some other plants, one flower, usually\r\nthe central or terminal one, opens first, and has five sepals and\r\npetals, and five divisions to the ovarium; while all the other flowers\r\non the plant are tetramerous. In the British Adoxa the uppermost flower\r\ngenerally has two calyx-lobes with the other organs tetramerous, while\r\nthe surrounding flowers generally have three calyx-lobes with the other\r\norgans pentamerous. In many Compositæ and Umbelliferæ (and in some\r\nother plants) the circumferential flowers have their corollas much more\r\ndeveloped than those of the centre; and this seems often connected with\r\nthe abortion of the reproductive organs. It is a more curious fact,\r\npreviously referred to, that the achenes or seeds of the circumference\r\nand centre sometimes differ greatly in form, colour and other\r\ncharacters. In Carthamus and some other Compositæ the central achenes\r\nalone are furnished with a pappus; and in Hyoseris the same head yields\r\nachenes of three different forms. In certain Umbelliferæ the exterior\r\nseeds, according to Tausch, are orthospermous, and the central one\r\ncœlospermous, and this is a character which was considered by De\r\nCandolle to be in other species of the highest systematic importance.\r\nProfessor Braun mentions a Fumariaceous genus, in which the flowers in\r\nthe lower part of the spike bear oval, ribbed, one-seeded nutlets; and\r\nin the upper part of the spike, lanceolate, two-valved and two-seeded\r\nsiliques. In these several cases, with the exception of that of the\r\nwell-developed ray-florets, which are of service in making the flowers\r\nconspicuous to insects, natural selection cannot, as far as we can\r\njudge, have come into play, or only in a quite subordinate manner. All\r\nthese modifications follow from the relative position and inter-action\r\nof the parts; and it can hardly be doubted that if all the flowers and\r\nleaves on the same plant had been subjected to the same external and\r\ninternal condition, as are the flowers and leaves in certain positions,\r\nall would have been modified in the same manner.\r\n\r\nIn numerous other cases we find modifications of structure, which are\r\nconsidered by botanists to be generally of a highly important nature,\r\naffecting only some of the flowers on the same plant, or occurring on\r\ndistinct plants, which grow close together under the same conditions.\r\nAs these variations seem of no special use to the plants, they cannot\r\nhave been influenced by natural selection. Of their cause we are quite\r\nignorant; we cannot even attribute them, as in the last class of cases,\r\nto any proximate agency, such as relative position. I will give only a\r\nfew instances. It is so common to observe on the same plant, flowers\r\nindifferently tetramerous, pentamerous, &c., that I need not give\r\nexamples; but as numerical variations are comparatively rare when the\r\nparts are few, I may mention that, according to De Candolle, the\r\nflowers of Papaver bracteatum offer either two sepals with four petals\r\n(which is the common type with poppies), or three sepals with six\r\npetals. The manner in which the petals are folded in the bud is in most\r\ngroups a very constant morphological character; but Professor Asa Gray\r\nstates that with some species of Mimulus, the æstivation is almost as\r\nfrequently that of the Rhinanthideæ as of the Antirrhinideæ, to which\r\nlatter tribe the genus belongs. Aug. St. Hilaire gives the following\r\ncases: the genus Zanthoxylon belongs to a division of the Rutaceæ with\r\na single ovary, but in some species flowers may be found on the same\r\nplant, and even in the same panicle, with either one or two ovaries. In\r\nHelianthemum the capsule has been described as unilocular or\r\ntri-locular; and in H. mutabile, “Une lame _plus ou moins large_,\r\ns’étend entre le pericarpe et le placenta.” In the flowers of Saponaria\r\nofficinalis Dr. Masters has observed instances of both marginal and\r\nfree central placentation. Lastly, St. Hilaire found towards the\r\nsouthern extreme of the range of Gomphia oleæformis two forms which he\r\ndid not at first doubt were distinct species, but he subsequently saw\r\nthem growing on the same bush; and he then adds, “Voilà donc dans un\r\nmême individu des loges et un style qui se rattachent tantôt à un axe\r\nverticale et tantôt à un gynobase.”\r\n\r\nWe thus see that with plants many morphological changes may be\r\nattributed to the laws of growth and the inter-action of parts,\r\nindependently of natural selection. But with respect to Nägeli’s\r\ndoctrine of an innate tendency towards perfection or progressive\r\ndevelopment, can it be said in the case of these strongly pronounced\r\nvariations, that the plants have been caught in the act of progressing\r\ntowards a higher state of development? On the contrary, I should infer\r\nfrom the mere fact of the parts in question differing or varying\r\ngreatly on the same plant, that such modifications were of extremely\r\nsmall importance to the plants themselves, of whatever importance they\r\nmay generally be to us for our classifications. The acquisition of a\r\nuseless part can hardly be said to raise an organism in the natural\r\nscale; and in the case of the imperfect, closed flowers, above\r\ndescribed, if any new principle has to be invoked, it must be one of\r\nretrogression rather than of progression; and so it must be with many\r\nparasitic and degraded animals. We are ignorant of the exciting cause\r\nof the above specified modifications; but if the unknown cause were to\r\nact almost uniformly for a length of time, we may infer that the result\r\nwould be almost uniform; and in this case all the individuals of the\r\nspecies would be modified in the same manner.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact of the above characters being unimportant for the welfare\r\nof the species, any slight variations which occurred in them would not\r\nhave been accumulated and augmented through natural selection. A\r\nstructure which has been developed through long-continued selection,\r\nwhen it ceases to be of service to a species, generally becomes\r\nvariable, as we see with rudimentary organs; for it will no longer be\r\nregulated by this same power of selection. But when, from the nature of\r\nthe organism and of the conditions, modifications have been induced\r\nwhich are unimportant for the welfare of the species, they may be, and\r\napparently often have been, transmitted in nearly the same state to\r\nnumerous, otherwise modified, descendants. It cannot have been of much\r\nimportance to the greater number of mammals, birds, or reptiles,\r\nwhether they were clothed with hair, feathers or scales; yet hair has\r\nbeen transmitted to almost all mammals, feathers to all birds, and\r\nscales to all true reptiles. A structure, whatever it may be, which is\r\ncommon to many allied forms, is ranked by us as of high systematic\r\nimportance, and consequently is often assumed to be of high vital\r\nimportance to the species. Thus, as I am inclined to believe,\r\nmorphological differences, which we consider as important—such as the\r\narrangement of the leaves, the divisions of the flower or of the\r\novarium, the position of the ovules, &c., first appeared in many cases\r\nas fluctuating variations, which sooner or later became constant\r\nthrough the nature of the organism and of the surrounding conditions,\r\nas well as through the intercrossing of distinct individuals, but not\r\nthrough natural selection; for as these morphological characters do not\r\naffect the welfare of the species, any slight deviations in them could\r\nnot have been governed or accumulated through this latter agency. It is\r\na strange result which we thus arrive at, namely, that characters of\r\nslight vital importance to the species, are the most important to the\r\nsystematist; but, as we shall hereafter see when we treat of the\r\ngenetic principle of classification, this is by no means so paradoxical\r\nas it may at first appear.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have no good evidence of the existence in organic beings of\r\nan innate tendency towards progressive development, yet this\r\nnecessarily follows, as I have attempted to show in the fourth chapter,\r\nthrough the continued action of natural selection. For the best\r\ndefinition which has ever been given of a high standard of\r\norganisation, is the degree to which the parts have been specialised or\r\ndifferentiated; and natural selection tends towards this end, inasmuch\r\nas the parts are thus enabled to perform their functions more\r\nefficiently.\r\n\r\nA distinguished zoologist, Mr. St. George Mivart, has recently\r\ncollected all the objections which have ever been advanced by myself\r\nand others against the theory of natural selection, as propounded by\r\nMr. Wallace and myself, and has illustrated them with admirable art and\r\nforce. When thus marshalled, they make a formidable array; and as it\r\nforms no part of Mr. Mivart’s plan to give the various facts and\r\nconsiderations opposed to his conclusions, no slight effort of reason\r\nand memory is left to the reader, who may wish to weigh the evidence on\r\nboth sides. When discussing special cases, Mr. Mivart passes over the\r\neffects of the increased use and disuse of parts, which I have always\r\nmaintained to be highly important, and have treated in my “Variation\r\nunder Domestication” at greater length than, as I believe, any other\r\nwriter. He likewise often assumes that I attribute nothing to\r\nvariation, independently of natural selection, whereas in the work just\r\nreferred to I have collected a greater number of well-established cases\r\nthan can be found in any other work known to me. My judgment may not be\r\ntrustworthy, but after reading with care Mr. Mivart’s book, and\r\ncomparing each section with what I have said on the same head, I never\r\nbefore felt so strongly convinced of the general truth of the\r\nconclusions here arrived at, subject, of course, in so intricate a\r\nsubject, to much partial error.\r\n\r\nAll Mr. Mivart’s objections will be, or have been, considered in the\r\npresent volume. The one new point which appears to have struck many\r\nreaders is, “That natural selection is incompetent to account for the\r\nincipient stages of useful structures.” This subject is intimately\r\nconnected with that of the gradation of the characters, often\r\naccompanied by a change of function, for instance, the conversion of a\r\nswim-bladder into lungs, points which were discussed in the last\r\nchapter under two headings. Nevertheless, I will here consider in some\r\ndetail several of the cases advanced by Mr. Mivart, selecting those\r\nwhich are the most illustrative, as want of space prevents me from\r\nconsidering all.\r\n\r\nThe giraffe, by its lofty stature, much elongated neck, fore legs, head\r\nand tongue, has its whole frame beautifully adapted for browsing on the\r\nhigher branches of trees. It can thus obtain food beyond the reach of\r\nthe other Ungulata or hoofed animals inhabiting the same country; and\r\nthis must be a great advantage to it during dearths. The Niata cattle\r\nin South America show us how small a difference in structure may make,\r\nduring such periods, a great difference in preserving an animal’s life.\r\nThese cattle can browse as well as others on grass, but from the\r\nprojection of the lower jaw they cannot, during the often recurrent\r\ndroughts, browse on the twigs of trees, reeds, &c., to which food the\r\ncommon cattle and horses are then driven; so that at these times the\r\nNiatas perish, if not fed by their owners. Before coming to Mr.\r\nMivart’s objections, it may be well to explain once again how natural\r\nselection will act in all ordinary cases. Man has modified some of his\r\nanimals, without necessarily having attended to special points of\r\nstructure, by simply preserving and breeding from the fleetest\r\nindividuals, as with the race-horse and greyhound, or as with the\r\ngame-cock, by breeding from the victorious birds. So under nature with\r\nthe nascent giraffe, the individuals which were the highest browsers\r\nand were able during dearths to reach even an inch or two above the\r\nothers, will often have been preserved; for they will have roamed over\r\nthe whole country in search of food. That the individuals of the same\r\nspecies often differ slightly in the relative lengths of all their\r\nparts may be seen in many works of natural history, in which careful\r\nmeasurements are given. These slight proportional differences, due to\r\nthe laws of growth and variation, are not of the slightest use or\r\nimportance to most species. But it will have been otherwise with the\r\nnascent giraffe, considering its probable habits of life; for those\r\nindividuals which had some one part or several parts of their bodies\r\nrather more elongated than usual, would generally have survived. These\r\nwill have intercrossed and left offspring, either inheriting the same\r\nbodily peculiarities, or with a tendency to vary again in the same\r\nmanner; while the individuals less favoured in the same respects will\r\nhave been the most liable to perish.\r\n\r\nWe here see that there is no need to separate single pairs, as man\r\ndoes, when he methodically improves a breed: natural selection will\r\npreserve and thus separate all the superior individuals, allowing them\r\nfreely to intercross, and will destroy all the inferior individuals. By\r\nthis process long-continued, which exactly corresponds with what I have\r\ncalled unconscious selection by man, combined, no doubt, in a most\r\nimportant manner with the inherited effects of the increased use of\r\nparts, it seems to me almost certain that an ordinary hoofed quadruped\r\nmight be converted into a giraffe.\r\n\r\nTo this conclusion Mr. Mivart brings forward two objections. One is\r\nthat the increased size of the body would obviously require an\r\nincreased supply of food, and he considers it as “very problematical\r\nwhether the disadvantages thence arising would not, in times of\r\nscarcity, more than counterbalance the advantages.” But as the giraffe\r\ndoes actually exist in large numbers in Africa, and as some of the\r\nlargest antelopes in the world, taller than an ox, abound there, why\r\nshould we doubt that, as far as size is concerned, intermediate\r\ngradations could formerly have existed there, subjected as now to\r\nsevere dearths. Assuredly the being able to reach, at each stage of\r\nincreased size, to a supply of food, left untouched by the other hoofed\r\nquadrupeds of the country, would have been of some advantage to the\r\nnascent giraffe. Nor must we overlook the fact, that increased bulk\r\nwould act as a protection against almost all beasts of prey excepting\r\nthe lion; and against this animal, its tall neck—and the taller the\r\nbetter—would, as Mr. Chauncey Wright has remarked, serve as a\r\nwatch-tower. It is from this cause, as Sir S. Baker remarks, that no\r\nanimal is more difficult to stalk than the giraffe. This animal also\r\nuses its long neck as a means of offence or defence, by violently\r\nswinging its head armed with stump-like horns. The preservation of each\r\nspecies can rarely be determined by any one advantage, but by the union\r\nof all, great and small.\r\n\r\nMr. Mivart then asks (and this is his second objection), if natural\r\nselection be so potent, and if high browsing be so great an advantage,\r\nwhy has not any other hoofed quadruped acquired a long neck and lofty\r\nstature, besides the giraffe, and, in a lesser degree, the camel,\r\nguanaco and macrauchenia? Or, again, why has not any member of the\r\ngroup acquired a long proboscis? With respect to South Africa, which\r\nwas formerly inhabited by numerous herds of the giraffe, the answer is\r\nnot difficult, and can best be given by an illustration. In every\r\nmeadow in England, in which trees grow, we see the lower branches\r\ntrimmed or planed to an exact level by the browsing of the horses or\r\ncattle; and what advantage would it be, for instance, to sheep, if kept\r\nthere, to acquire slightly longer necks? In every district some one\r\nkind of animal will almost certainly be able to browse higher than the\r\nothers; and it is almost equally certain that this one kind alone could\r\nhave its neck elongated for this purpose, through natural selection and\r\nthe effects of increased use. In South Africa the competition for\r\nbrowsing on the higher branches of the acacias and other trees must be\r\nbetween giraffe and giraffe, and not with the other ungulate animals.\r\n\r\nWhy, in other quarters of the world, various animals belonging to this\r\nsame order have not acquired either an elongated neck or a proboscis,\r\ncannot be distinctly answered; but it is as unreasonable to expect a\r\ndistinct answer to such a question as why some event in the history of\r\nmankind did not occur in one country while it did in another. We are\r\nignorant with respect to the conditions which determine the numbers and\r\nrange of each species, and we cannot even conjecture what changes of\r\nstructure would be favourable to its increase in some new country. We\r\ncan, however, see in a general manner that various causes might have\r\ninterfered with the development of a long neck or proboscis. To reach\r\nthe foliage at a considerable height (without climbing, for which\r\nhoofed animals are singularly ill-constructed) implies greatly\r\nincreased bulk of body; and we know that some areas support singularly\r\nfew large quadrupeds, for instance South America, though it is so\r\nluxuriant, while South Africa abounds with them to an unparalleled\r\ndegree. Why this should be so we do not know; nor why the later\r\ntertiary periods should have been much more favourable for their\r\nexistence than the present time. Whatever the causes may have been, we\r\ncan see that certain districts and times would have been much more\r\nfavourable than others for the development of so large a quadruped as\r\nthe giraffe.\r\n\r\nIn order that an animal should acquire some structure specially and\r\nlargely developed, it is almost indispensable that several other parts\r\nshould be modified and coadapted. Although every part of the body\r\nvaries slightly, it does not follow that the necessary parts should\r\nalways vary in the right direction and to the right degree. With the\r\ndifferent species of our domesticated animals we know that the parts\r\nvary in a different manner and degree, and that some species are much\r\nmore variable than others. Even if the fitting variations did arise, it\r\ndoes not follow that natural selection would be able to act on them and\r\nproduce a structure which apparently would be beneficial to the\r\nspecies. For instance, if the number of individuals existing in a\r\ncountry is determined chiefly through destruction by beasts of prey—by\r\nexternal or internal parasites, &c.—as seems often to be the case, then\r\nnatural selection will be able to do little, or will be greatly\r\nretarded, in modifying any particular structure for obtaining food.\r\nLastly, natural selection is a slow process, and the same favourable\r\nconditions must long endure in order that any marked effect should thus\r\nbe produced. Except by assigning such general and vague reasons, we\r\ncannot explain why, in many quarters of the world, hoofed quadrupeds\r\nhave not acquired much elongated necks or other means for browsing on\r\nthe higher branches of trees.\r\n\r\nObjections of the same nature as the foregoing have been advanced by\r\nmany writers. In each case various causes, besides the general ones\r\njust indicated, have probably interfered with the acquisition through\r\nnatural selection of structures, which it is thought would be\r\nbeneficial to certain species. One writer asks, why has not the ostrich\r\nacquired the power of flight? But a moment’s reflection will show what\r\nan enormous supply of food would be necessary to give to this bird of\r\nthe desert force to move its huge body through the air. Oceanic islands\r\nare inhabited by bats and seals, but by no terrestrial mammals; yet as\r\nsome of these bats are peculiar species, they must have long inhabited\r\ntheir present homes. Therefore Sir C. Lyell asks, and assigns certain\r\nreasons in answer, why have not seals and bats given birth on such\r\nislands to forms fitted to live on the land? But seals would\r\nnecessarily be first converted into terrestrial carnivorous animals of\r\nconsiderable size, and bats into terrestrial insectivorous animals; for\r\nthe former there would be no prey; for the bats ground-insects would\r\nserve as food, but these would already be largely preyed on by the\r\nreptiles or birds, which first colonise and abound on most oceanic\r\nislands. Gradations of structure, with each stage beneficial to a\r\nchanging species, will be favoured only under certain peculiar\r\nconditions. A strictly terrestrial animal, by occasionally hunting for\r\nfood in shallow water, then in streams or lakes, might at last be\r\nconverted into an animal so thoroughly aquatic as to brave the open\r\nocean. But seals would not find on oceanic islands the conditions\r\nfavourable to their gradual reconversion into a terrestrial form. Bats,\r\nas formerly shown, probably acquired their wings by at first gliding\r\nthrough the air from tree to tree, like the so-called flying-squirrels,\r\nfor the sake of escaping from their enemies, or for avoiding falls; but\r\nwhen the power of true flight had once been acquired, it would never be\r\nreconverted back, at least for the above purposes, into the less\r\nefficient power of gliding through the air. Bats, might, indeed, like\r\nmany birds, have had their wings greatly reduced in size, or completely\r\nlost, through disuse; but in this case it would be necessary that they\r\nshould first have acquired the power of running quickly on the ground,\r\nby the aid of their hind legs alone, so as to compete with birds or\r\nother ground animals; and for such a change a bat seems singularly\r\nill-fitted. These conjectural remarks have been made merely to show\r\nthat a transition of structure, with each step beneficial, is a highly\r\ncomplex affair; and that there is nothing strange in a transition not\r\nhaving occurred in any particular case.\r\n\r\nLastly, more than one writer has asked why have some animals had their\r\nmental powers more highly developed than others, as such development\r\nwould be advantageous to all? Why have not apes acquired the\r\nintellectual powers of man? Various causes could be assigned; but as\r\nthey are conjectural, and their relative probability cannot be weighed,\r\nit would be useless to give them. A definite answer to the latter\r\nquestion ought not to be expected, seeing that no one can solve the\r\nsimpler problem, why, of two races of savages, one has risen higher in\r\nthe scale of civilisation than the other; and this apparently implies\r\nincreased brain power.\r\n\r\nWe will return to Mr. Mivart’s other objections. Insects often resemble\r\nfor the sake of protection various objects, such as green or decayed\r\nleaves, dead twigs, bits of lichen, flowers, spines, excrement of\r\nbirds, and living insects; but to this latter point I shall hereafter\r\nrecur. The resemblance is often wonderfully close, and is not confined\r\nto colour, but extends to form, and even to the manner in which the\r\ninsects hold themselves. The caterpillars which project motionless like\r\ndead twigs from the bushes on which they feed, offer an excellent\r\ninstance of a resemblance of this kind. The cases of the imitation of\r\nsuch objects as the excrement of birds, are rare and exceptional. On\r\nthis head, Mr. Mivart remarks, “As, according to Mr. Darwin’s theory,\r\nthere is a constant tendency to indefinite variation, and as the minute\r\nincipient variations will be in _all directions_, they must tend to\r\nneutralize each other, and at first to form such unstable modifications\r\nthat it is difficult, if not impossible, to see how such indefinite\r\noscillations of infinitesimal beginnings can ever build up a\r\nsufficiently appreciable resemblance to a leaf, bamboo, or other\r\nobject, for natural selection to seize upon and perpetuate.”\r\n\r\nBut in all the foregoing cases the insects in their original state no\r\ndoubt presented some rude and accidental resemblance to an object\r\ncommonly found in the stations frequented by them. Nor is this at all\r\nimprobable, considering the almost infinite number of surrounding\r\nobjects and the diversity in form and colour of the hosts of insects\r\nwhich exist. As some rude resemblance is necessary for the first start,\r\nwe can understand how it is that the larger and higher animals do not\r\n(with the exception, as far as I know, of one fish) resemble for the\r\nsake of protection special objects, but only the surface which commonly\r\nsurrounds them, and this chiefly in colour. Assuming that an insect\r\noriginally happened to resemble in some degree a dead twig or a decayed\r\nleaf, and that it varied slightly in many ways, then all the variations\r\nwhich rendered the insect at all more like any such object, and thus\r\nfavoured its escape, would be preserved, while other variations would\r\nbe neglected and ultimately lost; or, if they rendered the insect at\r\nall less like the imitated object, they would be eliminated. There\r\nwould indeed be force in Mr. Mivart’s objection, if we were to attempt\r\nto account for the above resemblances, independently of natural\r\nselection, through mere fluctuating variability; but as the case stands\r\nthere is none.\r\n\r\nNor can I see any force in Mr. Mivart’s difficulty with respect to “the\r\nlast touches of perfection in the mimicry;” as in the case given by Mr.\r\nWallace, of a walking-stick insect (Ceroxylus laceratus), which\r\nresembles “a stick grown over by a creeping moss or jungermannia.” So\r\nclose was this resemblance, that a native Dyak maintained that the\r\nfoliaceous excrescences were really moss. Insects are preyed on by\r\nbirds and other enemies whose sight is probably sharper than ours, and\r\nevery grade in resemblance which aided an insect to escape notice or\r\ndetection, would tend towards its preservation; and the more perfect\r\nthe resemblance so much the better for the insect. Considering the\r\nnature of the differences between the species in the group which\r\nincludes the above Ceroxylus, there is nothing improbable in this\r\ninsect having varied in the irregularities on its surface, and in these\r\nhaving become more or less green-coloured; for in every group the\r\ncharacters which differ in the several species are the most apt to\r\nvary, while the generic characters, or those common to all the species,\r\nare the most constant.\r\n\r\nThe Greenland whale is one of the most wonderful animals in the world,\r\nand the baleen, or whalebone, one of its greatest peculiarities. The\r\nbaleen consists of a row, on each side of the upper jaw, of about 300\r\nplates or laminæ, which stand close together transversely to the longer\r\naxis of the mouth. Within the main row there are some subsidiary rows.\r\nThe extremities and inner margins of all the plates are frayed into\r\nstiff bristles, which clothe the whole gigantic palate, and serve to\r\nstrain or sift the water, and thus to secure the minute prey on which\r\nthese great animals subsist. The middle and longest lamina in the\r\nGreenland whale is ten, twelve, or even fifteen feet in length; but in\r\nthe different species of Cetaceans there are gradations in length; the\r\nmiddle lamina being in one species, according to Scoresby, four feet,\r\nin another three, in another eighteen inches, and in the Balænoptera\r\nrostrata only about nine inches in length. The quality of the whalebone\r\nalso differs in the different species.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the baleen, Mr. Mivart remarks that if it “had once\r\nattained such a size and development as to be at all useful, then its\r\npreservation and augmentation within serviceable limits would be\r\npromoted by natural selection alone. But how to obtain the beginning of\r\nsuch useful development?” In answer, it may be asked, why should not\r\nthe early progenitors of the whales with baleen have possessed a mouth\r\nconstructed something like the lamellated beak of a duck? Ducks, like\r\nwhales, subsist by sifting the mud and water; and the family has\r\nsometimes been called _Criblatores_, or sifters. I hope that I may not\r\nbe misconstrued into saying that the progenitors of whales did actually\r\npossess mouths lamellated like the beak of a duck. I wish only to show\r\nthat this is not incredible, and that the immense plates of baleen in\r\nthe Greenland whale might have been developed from such lamellæ by\r\nfinely graduated steps, each of service to its possessor.\r\n\r\nThe beak of a shoveller-duck (Spatula clypeata) is a more beautiful and\r\ncomplex structure than the mouth of a whale. The upper mandible is\r\nfurnished on each side (in the specimen examined by me) with a row or\r\ncomb formed of 188 thin, elastic lamellæ, obliquely bevelled so as to\r\nbe pointed, and placed transversely to the longer axis of the mouth.\r\nThey arise from the palate, and are attached by flexible membrane to\r\nthe sides of the mandible. Those standing towards the middle are the\r\nlongest, being about one-third of an inch in length, and they project\r\nfourteen one-hundredths of an inch beneath the edge. At their bases\r\nthere is a short subsidiary row of obliquely transverse lamellæ. In\r\nthese several respects they resemble the plates of baleen in the mouth\r\nof a whale. But towards the extremity of the beak they differ much, as\r\nthey project inward, instead of straight downward. The entire head of\r\nthe shoveller, though incomparably less bulky, is about one-eighteenth\r\nof the length of the head of a moderately large Balænoptera rostrata,\r\nin which species the baleen is only nine inches long; so that if we\r\nwere to make the head of the shoveller as long as that of the\r\nBalænoptera, the lamellæ would be six inches in length, that is,\r\ntwo-thirds of the length of the baleen in this species of whale. The\r\nlower mandible of the shoveller-duck is furnished with lamellæ of equal\r\nlength with these above, but finer; and in being thus furnished it\r\ndiffers conspicuously from the lower jaw of a whale, which is destitute\r\nof baleen. On the other hand, the extremities of these lower lamellæ\r\nare frayed into fine bristly points, so that they thus curiously\r\nresemble the plates of baleen. In the genus Prion, a member of the\r\ndistinct family of the Petrels, the upper mandible alone is furnished\r\nwith lamellæ, which are well developed and project beneath the margin;\r\nso that the beak of this bird resembles in this respect the mouth of a\r\nwhale.\r\n\r\nFrom the highly developed structure of the shoveller’s beak we may\r\nproceed (as I have learned from information and specimens sent to me by\r\nMr. Salvin), without any great break, as far as fitness for sifting is\r\nconcerned, through the beak of the Merganetta armata, and in some\r\nrespects through that of the Aix sponsa, to the beak of the common\r\nduck. In this latter species the lamellæ are much coarser than in the\r\nshoveller, and are firmly attached to the sides of the mandible; they\r\nare only about fifty in number on each side, and do not project at all\r\nbeneath the margin. They are square-topped, and are edged with\r\ntranslucent, hardish tissue, as if for crushing food. The edges of the\r\nlower mandible are crossed by numerous fine ridges, which project very\r\nlittle. Although the beak is thus very inferior as a sifter to that of\r\na shoveller, yet this bird, as every one knows, constantly uses it for\r\nthis purpose. There are other species, as I hear from Mr. Salvin, in\r\nwhich the lamellæ are considerably less developed than in the common\r\nduck; but I do not know whether they use their beaks for sifting the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nTurning to another group of the same family. In the Egyptian goose\r\n(Chenalopex) the beak closely resembles that of the common duck; but\r\nthe lamellæ are not so numerous, nor so distinct from each other, nor\r\ndo they project so much inward; yet this goose, as I am informed by Mr.\r\nE. Bartlett, “uses its bill like a duck by throwing the water out at\r\nthe corners.” Its chief food, however, is grass, which it crops like\r\nthe common goose. In this latter bird the lamellæ of the upper mandible\r\nare much coarser than in the common duck, almost confluent, about\r\ntwenty-seven in number on each side, and terminating upward in\r\nteeth-like knobs. The palate is also covered with hard rounded knobs.\r\nThe edges of the lower mandible are serrated with teeth much more\r\nprominent, coarser and sharper than in the duck. The common goose does\r\nnot sift the water, but uses its beak exclusively for tearing or\r\ncutting herbage, for which purpose it is so well fitted that it can\r\ncrop grass closer than almost any other animal. There are other species\r\nof geese, as I hear from Mr. Bartlett, in which the lamellæ are less\r\ndeveloped than in the common goose.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that a member of the duck family, with a beak constructed\r\nlike that of a common goose and adapted solely for grazing, or even a\r\nmember with a beak having less well-developed lamellæ, might be\r\nconverted by small changes into a species like the Egyptian goose—this\r\ninto one like the common duck—and, lastly, into one like the shoveller,\r\nprovided with a beak almost exclusively adapted for sifting the water;\r\nfor this bird could hardly use any part of its beak, except the hooked\r\ntip, for seizing or tearing solid food. The beak of a goose, as I may\r\nadd, might also be converted by small changes into one provided with\r\nprominent, recurved teeth, like those of the Merganser (a member of the\r\nsame family), serving for the widely different purpose of securing live\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nReturning to the whales. The Hyperoodon bidens is destitute of true\r\nteeth in an efficient condition, but its palate is roughened, according\r\nto Lacepede, with small unequal, hard points of horn. There is,\r\ntherefore, nothing improbable in supposing that some early Cetacean\r\nform was provided with similar points of horn on the palate, but rather\r\nmore regularly placed, and which, like the knobs on the beak of the\r\ngoose, aided it in seizing or tearing its food. If so, it will hardly\r\nbe denied that the points might have been converted through variation\r\nand natural selection into lamellæ as well-developed as those of the\r\nEgyptian goose, in which case they would have been used both for\r\nseizing objects and for sifting the water; then into lamellæ like those\r\nof the domestic duck; and so onward, until they became as well\r\nconstructed as those of the shoveller, in which case they would have\r\nserved exclusively as a sifting apparatus. From this stage, in which\r\nthe lamellæ would be two-thirds of the length of the plates of baleen\r\nin the Balænoptera rostrata, gradations, which may be observed in\r\nstill-existing Cetaceans, lead us onward to the enormous plates of\r\nbaleen in the Greenland whale. Nor is there the least reason to doubt\r\nthat each step in this scale might have been as serviceable to certain\r\nancient Cetaceans, with the functions of the parts slowly changing\r\nduring the progress of development, as are the gradations in the beaks\r\nof the different existing members of the duck-family. We should bear in\r\nmind that each species of duck is subjected to a severe struggle for\r\nexistence, and that the structure of every part of its frame must be\r\nwell adapted to its conditions of life.\r\n\r\nThe Pleuronectidæ, or Flat-fish, are remarkable for their asymmetrical\r\nbodies. They rest on one side—in the greater number of species on the\r\nleft, but in some on the right side; and occasionally reversed adult\r\nspecimens occur. The lower, or resting-surface, resembles at first\r\nsight the ventral surface of an ordinary fish; it is of a white colour,\r\nless developed in many ways than the upper side, with the lateral fins\r\noften of smaller size. But the eyes offer the most remarkable\r\npeculiarity; for they are both placed on the upper side of the head.\r\nDuring early youth, however, they stand opposite to each other, and the\r\nwhole body is then symmetrical, with both sides equally coloured. Soon\r\nthe eye proper to the lower side begins to glide slowly round the head\r\nto the upper side; but does not pass right through the skull, as was\r\nformerly thought to be the case. It is obvious that unless the lower\r\neye did thus travel round, it could not be used by the fish while lying\r\nin its habitual position on one side. The lower eye would, also, have\r\nbeen liable to be abraded by the sandy bottom. That the Pleuronectidæ\r\nare admirably adapted by their flattened and asymmetrical structure for\r\ntheir habits of life, is manifest from several species, such as soles,\r\nflounders, &c., being extremely common. The chief advantages thus\r\ngained seem to be protection from their enemies, and facility for\r\nfeeding on the ground. The different members, however, of the family\r\npresent, as Schiödte remarks, “a long series of forms exhibiting a\r\ngradual transition from Hippoglossus pinguis, which does not in any\r\nconsiderable degree alter the shape in which it leaves the ovum, to the\r\nsoles, which are entirely thrown to one side.”\r\n\r\nMr. Mivart has taken up this case, and remarks that a sudden\r\nspontaneous transformation in the position of the eyes is hardly\r\nconceivable, in which I quite agree with him. He then adds: “If the\r\ntransit was gradual, then how such transit of one eye a minute fraction\r\nof the journey towards the other side of the head could benefit the\r\nindividual is, indeed, far from clear. It seems, even, that such an\r\nincipient transformation must rather have been injurious.” But he might\r\nhave found an answer to this objection in the excellent observations\r\npublished in 1867 by Malm. The Pleuronectidæ, while very young and\r\nstill symmetrical, with their eyes standing on opposite sides of the\r\nhead, cannot long retain a vertical position, owing to the excessive\r\ndepth of their bodies, the small size of their lateral fins, and to\r\ntheir being destitute of a swimbladder. Hence, soon growing tired,\r\nthey fall to the bottom on one side. While thus at rest they often\r\ntwist, as Malm observed, the lower eye upward, to see above them; and\r\nthey do this so vigorously that the eye is pressed hard against the\r\nupper part of the orbit. The forehead between the eyes consequently\r\nbecomes, as could be plainly seen, temporarily contracted in breadth.\r\nOn one occasion Malm saw a young fish raise and depress the lower eye\r\nthrough an angular distance of about seventy degrees.\r\n\r\nWe should remember that the skull at this early age is cartilaginous\r\nand flexible, so that it readily yields to muscular action. It is also\r\nknown with the higher animals, even after early youth, that the skull\r\nyields and is altered in shape, if the skin or muscles be permanently\r\ncontracted through disease or some accident. With long-eared rabbits,\r\nif one ear flops forward and downward, its weight drags forward all the\r\nbones of the skull on the same side, of which I have given a figure.\r\nMalm states that the newly-hatched young of perches, salmon, and\r\nseveral other symmetrical fishes, have the habit of occasionally\r\nresting on one side at the bottom; and he has observed that they often\r\nthen strain their lower eyes so as to look upward; and their skulls are\r\nthus rendered rather crooked. These fishes, however, are soon able to\r\nhold themselves in a vertical position, and no permanent effect is thus\r\nproduced. With the Pleuronectidæ, on the other hand, the older they\r\ngrow the more habitually they rest on one side, owing to the increasing\r\nflatness of their bodies, and a permanent effect is thus produced on\r\nthe form of the head, and on the position of the eyes. Judging from\r\nanalogy, the tendency to distortion would no doubt be increased through\r\nthe principle of inheritance. Schiödte believes, in opposition to some\r\nother naturalists, that the Pleuronectidæ are not quite symmetrical\r\neven in the embryo; and if this be so, we could understand how it is\r\nthat certain species, while young, habitually fall over and rest on the\r\nleft side, and other species on the right side. Malm adds, in\r\nconfirmation of the above view, that the adult Trachypterus arcticus,\r\nwhich is not a member of the Pleuronectidæ, rests on its left side at\r\nthe bottom, and swims diagonally through the water; and in this fish,\r\nthe two sides of the head are said to be somewhat dissimilar. Our great\r\nauthority on Fishes, Dr. Günther, concludes his abstract of Malm’s\r\npaper, by remarking that “the author gives a very simple explanation of\r\nthe abnormal condition of the Pleuronectoids.”\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the first stages of the transit of the eye from one\r\nside of the head to the other, which Mr. Mivart considers would be\r\ninjurious, may be attributed to the habit, no doubt beneficial to the\r\nindividual and to the species, of endeavouring to look upward with both\r\neyes, while resting on one side at the bottom. We may also attribute to\r\nthe inherited effects of use the fact of the mouth in several kinds of\r\nflat-fish being bent towards the lower surface, with the jaw bones\r\nstronger and more effective on this, the eyeless side of the head, than\r\non the other, for the sake, as Dr. Traquair supposes, of feeding with\r\nease on the ground. Disuse, on the other hand, will account for the\r\nless developed condition of the whole inferior half of the body,\r\nincluding the lateral fins; though Yarrel thinks that the reduced size\r\nof these fins is advantageous to the fish, as “there is so much less\r\nroom for their action than with the larger fins above.” Perhaps the\r\nlesser number of teeth in the proportion of four to seven in the upper\r\nhalves of the two jaws of the plaice, to twenty-five to thirty in the\r\nlower halves, may likewise be accounted for by disuse. From the\r\ncolourless state of the ventral surface of most fishes and of many\r\nother animals, we may reasonably suppose that the absence of colour in\r\nflat-fish on the side, whether it be the right or left, which is\r\nunder-most, is due to the exclusion of light. But it cannot be supposed\r\nthat the peculiar speckled appearance of the upper side of the sole, so\r\nlike the sandy bed of the sea, or the power in some species, as\r\nrecently shown by Pouchet, of changing their colour in accordance with\r\nthe surrounding surface, or the presence of bony tubercles on the upper\r\nside of the turbot, are due to the action of the light. Here natural\r\nselection has probably come into play, as well as in adapting the\r\ngeneral shape of the body of these fishes, and many other\r\npeculiarities, to their habits of life. We should keep in mind, as I\r\nhave before insisted, that the inherited effects of the increased use\r\nof parts, and perhaps of their disuse, will be strengthened by natural\r\nselection. For all spontaneous variations in the right direction will\r\nthus be preserved; as will those individuals which inherit in the\r\nhighest degree the effects of the increased and beneficial use of any\r\npart. How much to attribute in each particular case to the effects of\r\nuse, and how much to natural selection, it seems impossible to decide.\r\n\r\nI may give another instance of a structure which apparently owes its\r\norigin exclusively to use or habit. The extremity of the tail in some\r\nAmerican monkeys has been converted into a wonderfully perfect\r\nprehensile organ, and serves as a fifth hand. A reviewer, who agrees\r\nwith Mr. Mivart in every detail, remarks on this structure: “It is\r\nimpossible to believe that in any number of ages the first slight\r\nincipient tendency to grasp could preserve the lives of the individuals\r\npossessing it, or favour their chance of having and of rearing\r\noffspring.” But there is no necessity for any such belief. Habit, and\r\nthis almost implies that some benefit great or small is thus derived,\r\nwould in all probability suffice for the work. Brehm saw the young of\r\nan African monkey (Cercopithecus) clinging to the under surface of\r\ntheir mother by their hands, and at the same time they hooked their\r\nlittle tails round that of their mother. Professor Henslow kept in\r\nconfinement some harvest mice (Mus messorius) which do not possess a\r\nstructurally prehensive tail; but he frequently observed that they\r\ncurled their tails round the branches of a bush placed in the cage, and\r\nthus aided themselves in climbing. I have received an analogous account\r\nfrom Dr. Günther, who has seen a mouse thus suspend itself. If the\r\nharvest mouse had been more strictly arboreal, it would perhaps have\r\nhad its tail rendered structurally prehensile, as is the case with some\r\nmembers of the same order. Why Cercopithecus, considering its habits\r\nwhile young, has not become thus provided, it would be difficult to\r\nsay. It is, however, possible that the long tail of this monkey may be\r\nof more service to it as a balancing organ in making its prodigious\r\nleaps, than as a prehensile organ.\r\n\r\nThe mammary glands are common to the whole class of mammals, and are\r\nindispensable for their existence; they must, therefore, have been\r\ndeveloped at an extremely remote period, and we can know nothing\r\npositively about their manner of development. Mr. Mivart asks: “Is it\r\nconceivable that the young of any animal was ever saved from\r\ndestruction by accidentally sucking a drop of scarcely nutritious fluid\r\nfrom an accidentally hypertrophied cutaneous gland of its mother? And\r\neven if one was so, what chance was there of the perpetuation of such a\r\nvariation?” But the case is not here put fairly. It is admitted by most\r\nevolutionists that mammals are descended from a marsupial form; and if\r\nso, the mammary glands will have been at first developed within the\r\nmarsupial sack. In the case of the fish (Hippocampus) the eggs are\r\nhatched, and the young are reared for a time, within a sack of this\r\nnature; and an American naturalist, Mr. Lockwood, believes from what he\r\nhas seen of the development of the young, that they are nourished by a\r\nsecretion from the cutaneous glands of the sack. Now, with the early\r\nprogenitors of mammals, almost before they deserved to be thus\r\ndesignated, is it not at least possible that the young might have been\r\nsimilarly nourished? And in this case, the individuals which secreted a\r\nfluid, in some degree or manner the most nutritious, so as to partake\r\nof the nature of milk, would in the long run have reared a larger\r\nnumber of well-nourished offspring, than would the individuals which\r\nsecreted a poorer fluid; and thus the cutaneous glands, which are the\r\nhomologues of the mammary glands, would have been improved or rendered\r\nmore effective. It accords with the widely extended principle of\r\nspecialisation, that the glands over a certain space of the sack should\r\nhave become more highly developed than the remainder; and they would\r\nthen have formed a breast, but at first without a nipple, as we see in\r\nthe Ornithorhyncus, at the base of the mammalian series. Through what\r\nagency the glands over a certain space became more highly specialised\r\nthan the others, I will not pretend to decide, whether in part through\r\ncompensation of growth, the effects of use, or of natural selection.\r\n\r\nThe development of the mammary glands would have been of no service,\r\nand could not have been affected through natural selection, unless the\r\nyoung at the same time were able to partake of the secretion. There is\r\nno greater difficulty in understanding how young mammals have\r\ninstinctively learned to suck the breast, than in understanding how\r\nunhatched chickens have learned to break the egg-shell by tapping\r\nagainst it with their specially adapted beaks; or how a few hours after\r\nleaving the shell they have learned to pick up grains of food. In such\r\ncases the most probable solution seems to be, that the habit was at\r\nfirst acquired by practice at a more advanced age, and afterwards\r\ntransmitted to the offspring at an earlier age. But the young kangaroo\r\nis said not to suck, only to cling to the nipple of its mother, who has\r\nthe power of injecting milk into the mouth of her helpless, half-formed\r\noffspring. On this head Mr. Mivart remarks: “Did no special provision\r\nexist, the young one must infallibly be choked by the intrusion of the\r\nmilk into the wind-pipe. But there _is_ a special provision. The larynx\r\nis so elongated that it rises up into the posterior end of the nasal\r\npassage, and is thus enabled to give free entrance to the air for the\r\nlungs, while the milk passes harmlessly on each side of this elongated\r\nlarynx, and so safely attains the gullet behind it.” Mr. Mivart then\r\nasks how did natural selection remove in the adult kangaroo (and in\r\nmost other mammals, on the assumption that they are descended from a\r\nmarsupial form), “this at least perfectly innocent and harmless\r\nstructure?” It may be suggested in answer that the voice, which is\r\ncertainly of high importance to many animals, could hardly have been\r\nused with full force as long as the larynx entered the nasal passage;\r\nand Professor Flower has suggested to me that this structure would have\r\ngreatly interfered with an animal swallowing solid food.\r\n\r\nWe will now turn for a short space to the lower divisions of the animal\r\nkingdom. The Echinodermata (star-fishes, sea-urchins, &c.) are\r\nfurnished with remarkable organs, called pedicellariæ, which consist,\r\nwhen well developed, of a tridactyle forceps—that is, of one formed of\r\nthree serrated arms, neatly fitting together and placed on the summit\r\nof a flexible stem, moved by muscles. These forceps can seize firmly\r\nhold of any object; and Alexander Agassiz has seen an Echinus or\r\nsea-urchin rapidly passing particles of excrement from forceps to\r\nforceps down certain lines of its body, in order that its shell should\r\nnot be fouled. But there is no doubt that besides removing dirt of all\r\nkinds, they subserve other functions; and one of these apparently is\r\ndefence.\r\n\r\nWith respect to these organs, Mr. Mivart, as on so many previous\r\noccasions, asks: “What would be the utility of the _first rudimentary\r\nbeginnings_ of such structures, and how could such insipient buddings\r\nhave ever preserved the life of a single Echinus?” He adds, “not even\r\nthe _sudden_ development of the snapping action would have been\r\nbeneficial without the freely movable stalk, nor could the latter have\r\nbeen efficient without the snapping jaws, yet no minute, nearly\r\nindefinite variations could simultaneously evolve these complex\r\nco-ordinations of structure; to deny this seems to do no less than to\r\naffirm a startling paradox.” Paradoxical as this may appear to Mr.\r\nMivart, tridactyle forcepses, immovably fixed at the base, but capable\r\nof a snapping action, certainly exist on some star-fishes; and this is\r\nintelligible if they serve, at least in part, as a means of defence.\r\nMr. Agassiz, to whose great kindness I am indebted for much information\r\non the subject, informs me that there are other star-fishes, in which\r\none of the three arms of the forceps is reduced to a support for the\r\nother two; and again, other genera in which the third arm is completely\r\nlost. In Echinoneus, the shell is described by M. Perrier as bearing\r\ntwo kinds of pedicellariæ, one resembling those of Echinus, and the\r\nother those of Spatangus; and such cases are always interesting as\r\naffording the means of apparently sudden transitions, through the\r\nabortion of one of the two states of an organ.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the steps by which these curious organs have been\r\nevolved, Mr. Agassiz infers from his own researches and those of Mr.\r\nMüller, that both in star-fishes and sea-urchins the pedicellariæ must\r\nundoubtedly be looked at as modified spines. This may be inferred from\r\ntheir manner of development in the individual, as well as from a long\r\nand perfect series of gradations in different species and genera, from\r\nsimple granules to ordinary spines, to perfect tridactyle pedicellariæ.\r\nThe gradation extends even to the manner in which ordinary spines and\r\nthe pedicellariæ, with their supporting calcareous rods, are\r\narticulated to the shell. In certain genera of star-fishes, “the very\r\ncombinations needed to show that the pedicellariæ are only modified\r\nbranching spines” may be found. Thus we have fixed spines, with three\r\nequi-distant, serrated, movable branches, articulated to near their\r\nbases; and higher up, on the same spine, three other movable branches.\r\nNow when the latter arise from the summit of a spine they form, in\r\nfact, a rude tridactyle pedicellariæ, and such may be seen on the same\r\nspine together with the three lower branches. In this case the identity\r\nin nature between the arms of the pedicellariæ and the movable branches\r\nof a spine, is unmistakable. It is generally admitted that the ordinary\r\nspines serve as a protection; and if so, there can be no reason to\r\ndoubt that those furnished with serrated and movable branches likewise\r\nserve for the same purpose; and they would thus serve still more\r\neffectively as soon as by meeting together they acted as a prehensile\r\nor snapping apparatus. Thus every gradation, from an ordinary fixed\r\nspine to a fixed pedicellariæ, would be of service.\r\n\r\nIn certain genera of star-fishes these organs, instead of being fixed\r\nor borne on an immovable support, are placed on the summit of a\r\nflexible and muscular, though short, stem; and in this case they\r\nprobably subserve some additional function besides defence. In the\r\nsea-urchins the steps can be followed by which a fixed spine becomes\r\narticulated to the shell, and is thus rendered movable. I wish I had\r\nspace here to give a fuller abstract of Mr. Agassiz’s interesting\r\nobservations on the development of the pedicellariæ. All possible\r\ngradations, as he adds, may likewise be found between the pedicellariæ\r\nof the star-fishes and the hooks of the Ophiurians, another group of\r\nthe Echinodermata; and again between the pedicellariæ of sea-urchins\r\nand the anchors of the Holothuriæ, also belonging to the same great\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nCertain compound animals, or zoophytes, as they have been termed,\r\nnamely the Polyzoa, are provided with curious organs called avicularia.\r\nThese differ much in structure in the different species. In their most\r\nperfect condition they curiously resemble the head and beak of a\r\nvulture in miniature, seated on a neck and capable of movement, as is\r\nlikewise the lower jaw or mandible. In one species observed by me, all\r\nthe avicularia on the same branch often moved simultaneously backwards\r\nand forwards, with the lower jaw widely open, through an angle of about\r\n90 degrees, in the course of five seconds; and their movement caused\r\nthe whole polyzoary to tremble. When the jaws are touched with a needle\r\nthey seize it so firmly that the branch can thus be shaken.\r\n\r\nMr. Mivart adduces this case, chiefly on account of the supposed\r\ndifficulty of organs, namely the avicularia of the Polyzoa and the\r\npedicellariæ of the Echinodermata, which he considers as “essentially\r\nsimilar,” having been developed through natural selection in widely\r\ndistinct divisions of the animal kingdom. But, as far as structure is\r\nconcerned, I can see no similarity between tridactyle pedicellariæ and\r\navicularia. The latter resembles somewhat more closely the chelæ or\r\npincers of Crustaceans; and Mr. Mivart might have adduced with equal\r\nappropriateness this resemblance as a special difficulty, or even their\r\nresemblance to the head and beak of a bird. The avicularia are believed\r\nby Mr. Busk, Dr. Smitt and Dr. Nitsche—naturalists who have carefully\r\nstudied this group—to be homologous with the zooids and their cells\r\nwhich compose the zoophyte, the movable lip or lid of the cell\r\ncorresponding with the lower and movable mandible of the avicularium.\r\nMr. Busk, however, does not know of any gradations now existing between\r\na zooid and an avicularium. It is therefore impossible to conjecture by\r\nwhat serviceable gradations the one could have been converted into the\r\nother, but it by no means follows from this that such gradations have\r\nnot existed.\r\n\r\nAs the chelæ of Crustaceans resemble in some degree the avicularia of\r\nPolyzoa, both serving as pincers, it may be worth while to show that\r\nwith the former a long series of serviceable gradations still exists.\r\nIn the first and simplest stage, the terminal segment of a limb shuts\r\ndown either on the square summit of the broad penultimate segment, or\r\nagainst one whole side, and is thus enabled to catch hold of an object,\r\nbut the limb still serves as an organ of locomotion. We next find one\r\ncorner of the broad penultimate segment slightly prominent, sometimes\r\nfurnished with irregular teeth, and against these the terminal segment\r\nshuts down. By an increase in the size of this projection, with its\r\nshape, as well as that of the terminal segment, slightly modified and\r\nimproved, the pincers are rendered more and more perfect, until we have\r\nat last an instrument as efficient as the chelæ of a lobster. And all\r\nthese gradations can be actually traced.\r\n\r\nBesides the avicularia, the polyzoa possess curious organs called\r\nvibracula. These generally consist of long bristles, capable of\r\nmovement and easily excited. In one species examined by me the\r\nvibracula were slightly curved and serrated along the outer margin, and\r\nall of them on the same polyzoary often moved simultaneously; so that,\r\nacting like long oars, they swept a branch rapidly across the\r\nobject-glass of my microscope. When a branch was placed on its face,\r\nthe vibracula became entangled, and they made violent efforts to free\r\nthemselves. They are supposed to serve as a defence, and may be seen,\r\nas Mr. Busk remarks, “to sweep slowly and carefully over the surface of\r\nthe polyzoary, removing what might be noxious to the delicate\r\ninhabitants of the cells when their tentacula are protruded.” The\r\navicularia, like the vibracula, probably serve for defence, but they\r\nalso catch and kill small living animals, which, it is believed, are\r\nafterwards swept by the currents within reach of the tentacula of the\r\nzooids. Some species are provided with avicularia and vibracula, some\r\nwith avicularia alone and a few with vibracula alone.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to imagine two objects more widely different in\r\nappearance than a bristle or vibraculum, and an avicularium like the\r\nhead of a bird; yet they are almost certainly homologous and have been\r\ndeveloped from the same common source, namely a zooid with its cell.\r\nHence, we can understand how it is that these organs graduate in some\r\ncases, as I am informed by Mr. Busk, into each other. Thus, with the\r\navicularia of several species of Lepralia, the movable mandible is so\r\nmuch produced and is so like a bristle that the presence of the upper\r\nor fixed beak alone serves to determine its avicularian nature. The\r\nvibracula may have been directly developed from the lips of the cells,\r\nwithout having passed through the avicularian stage; but it seems more\r\nprobable that they have passed through this stage, as during the early\r\nstages of the transformation, the other parts of the cell, with the\r\nincluded zooid, could hardly have disappeared at once. In many cases\r\nthe vibracula have a grooved support at the base, which seems to\r\nrepresent the fixed beak; though this support in some species is quite\r\nabsent. This view of the development of the vibracula, if trustworthy,\r\nis interesting; for supposing that all the species provided with\r\navicularia had become extinct, no one with the most vivid imagination\r\nwould ever have thought that the vibracula had originally existed as\r\npart of an organ, resembling a bird’s head, or an irregular box or\r\nhood. It is interesting to see two such widely different organs\r\ndeveloped from a common origin; and as the movable lip of the cell\r\nserves as a protection to the zooid, there is no difficulty in\r\nbelieving that all the gradations, by which the lip became converted\r\nfirst into the lower mandible of an avicularium, and then into an\r\nelongated bristle, likewise served as a protection in different ways\r\nand under different circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn the vegetable kingdom Mr. Mivart only alludes to two cases, namely\r\nthe structure of the flowers of orchids, and the movements of climbing\r\nplants. With respect to the former, he says: “The explanation of their\r\n_origin_ is deemed thoroughly unsatisfactory—utterly insufficient to\r\nexplain the incipient, infinitesimal beginnings of structures which are\r\nof utility only when they are considerably developed.” As I have fully\r\ntreated this subject in another work, I will here give only a few\r\ndetails on one alone of the most striking peculiarities of the flowers\r\nof orchids, namely, their pollinia. A pollinium, when highly developed,\r\nconsists of a mass of pollen-grains, affixed to an elastic foot-stalk\r\nor caudicle, and this to a little mass of extremely viscid matter. The\r\npollinia are by this means transported by insects from one flower to\r\nthe stigma of another. In some orchids there is no caudicle to the\r\npollen-masses, and the grains are merely tied together by fine threads;\r\nbut as these are not confined to orchids, they need not here be\r\nconsidered; yet I may mention that at the base of the orchidaceous\r\nseries, in Cypripedium, we can see how the threads were probably first\r\ndeveloped. In other orchids the threads cohere at one end of the\r\npollen-masses; and this forms the first or nascent trace of a caudicle.\r\nThat this is the origin of the caudicle, even when of considerable\r\nlength and highly developed, we have good evidence in the aborted\r\npollen-grains which can sometimes be detected embedded within the\r\ncentral and solid parts.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the second chief peculiarity, namely, the little mass\r\nof viscid matter attached to the end of the caudicle, a long series of\r\ngradations can be specified, each of plain service to the plant. In\r\nmost flowers belonging to other orders the stigma secretes a little\r\nviscid matter. Now, in certain orchids similar viscid matter is\r\nsecreted, but in much larger quantities by one alone of the three\r\nstigmas; and this stigma, perhaps in consequence of the copious\r\nsecretion, is rendered sterile. When an insect visits a flower of this\r\nkind, it rubs off some of the viscid matter, and thus at the same time\r\ndrags away some of the pollen-grains. From this simple condition, which\r\ndiffers but little from that of a multitude of common flowers, there\r\nare endless gradations—to species in which the pollen-mass terminates\r\nin a very short, free caudicle—to others in which the caudicle becomes\r\nfirmly attached to the viscid matter, with the sterile stigma itself\r\nmuch modified. In this latter case we have a pollinium in its most\r\nhighly developed and perfect condition. He who will carefully examine\r\nthe flowers of orchids for himself will not deny the existence of the\r\nabove series of gradations—from a mass of pollen-grains merely tied\r\ntogether by threads, with the stigma differing but little from that of\r\nthe ordinary flowers, to a highly complex pollinium, admirably adapted\r\nfor transportal by insects; nor will he deny that all the gradations in\r\nthe several species are admirably adapted in relation to the general\r\nstructure of each flower for its fertilisation by different insects. In\r\nthis, and in almost every other case, the enquiry may be pushed further\r\nbackwards; and it may be asked how did the stigma of an ordinary flower\r\nbecome viscid, but as we do not know the full history of any one group\r\nof beings, it is as useless to ask, as it is hopeless to attempt\r\nanswering, such questions.\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to climbing plants. These can be arranged in a long\r\nseries, from those which simply twine round a support, to those which I\r\nhave called leaf-climbers, and to those provided with tendrils. In\r\nthese two latter classes the stems have generally, but not always, lost\r\nthe power of twining, though they retain the power of revolving, which\r\nthe tendrils likewise possess. The gradations from leaf-climbers to\r\ntendril bearers are wonderfully close, and certain plants may be\r\ndifferently placed in either class. But in ascending the series from\r\nsimple twiners to leaf-climbers, an important quality is added, namely\r\nsensitiveness to a touch, by which means the foot-stalks of the leaves\r\nor flowers, or these modified and converted into tendrils, are excited\r\nto bend round and clasp the touching object. He who will read my memoir\r\non these plants will, I think, admit that all the many gradations in\r\nfunction and structure between simple twiners and tendril-bearers are\r\nin each case beneficial in a high degree to the species. For instance,\r\nit is clearly a great advantage to a twining plant to become a\r\nleaf-climber; and it is probable that every twiner which possessed\r\nleaves with long foot-stalks would have been developed into a\r\nleaf-climber, if the foot-stalks had possessed in any slight degree the\r\nrequisite sensitiveness to a touch.\r\n\r\nAs twining is the simplest means of ascending a support, and forms the\r\nbasis of our series, it may naturally be asked how did plants acquire\r\nthis power in an incipient degree, afterwards to be improved and\r\nincreased through natural selection. The power of twining depends,\r\nfirstly, on the stems while young being extremely flexible (but this is\r\na character common to many plants which are not climbers); and,\r\nsecondly, on their continually bending to all points of the compass,\r\none after the other in succession, in the same order. By this movement\r\nthe stems are inclined to all sides, and are made to move round and\r\nround. As soon as the lower part of a stem strikes against any object\r\nand is stopped, the upper part still goes on bending and revolving, and\r\nthus necessarily twines round and up the support. The revolving\r\nmovement ceases after the early growth of each shoot. As in many widely\r\nseparated families of plants, single species and single genera possess\r\nthe power of revolving, and have thus become twiners, they must have\r\nindependently acquired it, and cannot have inherited it from a common\r\nprogenitor. Hence, I was led to predict that some slight tendency to a\r\nmovement of this kind would be found to be far from uncommon with\r\nplants which did not climb; and that this had afforded the basis for\r\nnatural selection to work on and improve. When I made this prediction,\r\nI knew of only one imperfect case, namely, of the young\r\nflower-peduncles of a Maurandia which revolved slightly and\r\nirregularly, like the stems of twining plants, but without making any\r\nuse of this habit. Soon afterwards Fritz Müller discovered that the\r\nyoung stems of an Alisma and of a Linum—plants which do not climb and\r\nare widely separated in the natural system—revolved plainly, though\r\nirregularly, and he states that he has reason to suspect that this\r\noccurs with some other plants. These slight movements appear to be of\r\nno service to the plants in question; anyhow, they are not of the least\r\nuse in the way of climbing, which is the point that concerns us.\r\nNevertheless we can see that if the stems of these plants had been\r\nflexible, and if under the conditions to which they are exposed it had\r\nprofited them to ascend to a height, then the habit of slightly and\r\nirregularly revolving might have been increased and utilised through\r\nnatural selection, until they had become converted into well-developed\r\ntwining species.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the sensitiveness of the foot-stalks of the leaves and\r\nflowers, and of tendrils, nearly the same remarks are applicable as in\r\nthe case of the revolving movements of twining plants. As a vast number\r\nof species, belonging to widely distinct groups, are endowed with this\r\nkind of sensitiveness, it ought to be found in a nascent condition in\r\nmany plants which have not become climbers. This is the case: I\r\nobserved that the young flower-peduncles of the above Maurandia curved\r\nthemselves a little towards the side which was touched. Morren found in\r\nseveral species of Oxalis that the leaves and their foot-stalks moved,\r\nespecially after exposure to a hot sun, when they were gently and\r\nrepeatedly touched, or when the plant was shaken. I repeated these\r\nobservations on some other species of Oxalis with the same result; in\r\nsome of them the movement was distinct, but was best seen in the young\r\nleaves; in others it was extremely slight. It is a more important fact\r\nthat according to the high authority of Hofmeister, the young shoots\r\nand leaves of all plants move after being shaken; and with climbing\r\nplants it is, as we know, only during the early stages of growth that\r\nthe foot-stalks and tendrils are sensitive.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible that the above slight movements, due to a touch\r\nor shake, in the young and growing organs of plants, can be of any\r\nfunctional importance to them. But plants possess, in obedience to\r\nvarious stimuli, powers of movement, which are of manifest importance\r\nto them; for instance, towards and more rarely from the light—in\r\nopposition to, and more rarely in the direction of, the attraction of\r\ngravity. When the nerves and muscles of an animal are excited by\r\ngalvanism or by the absorption of strychnine, the consequent movements\r\nmay be called an incidental result, for the nerves and muscles have not\r\nbeen rendered specially sensitive to these stimuli. So with plants it\r\nappears that, from having the power of movement in obedience to certain\r\nstimuli, they are excited in an incidental manner by a touch, or by\r\nbeing shaken. Hence there is no great difficulty in admitting that in\r\nthe case of leaf-climbers and tendril-bearers, it is this tendency\r\nwhich has been taken advantage of and increased through natural\r\nselection. It is, however, probable, from reasons which I have assigned\r\nin my memoir, that this will have occurred only with plants which had\r\nalready acquired the power of revolving, and had thus become twiners.\r\n\r\nI have already endeavoured to explain how plants became twiners,\r\nnamely, by the increase of a tendency to slight and irregular revolving\r\nmovements, which were at first of no use to them; this movement, as\r\nwell as that due to a touch or shake, being the incidental result of\r\nthe power of moving, gained for other and beneficial purposes. Whether,\r\nduring the gradual development of climbing plants, natural selection\r\nhas been aided by the inherited effects of use, I will not pretend to\r\ndecide; but we know that certain periodical movements, for instance the\r\nso-called sleep of plants, are governed by habit.\r\n\r\nI have now considered enough, perhaps more than enough, of the cases,\r\nselected with care by a skilful naturalist, to prove that natural\r\nselection is incompetent to account for the incipient stages of useful\r\nstructures; and I have shown, as I hope, that there is no great\r\ndifficulty on this head. A good opportunity has thus been afforded for\r\nenlarging a little on gradations of structure, often associated with\r\nstrange functions—an important subject, which was not treated at\r\nsufficient length in the former editions of this work. I will now\r\nbriefly recapitulate the foregoing cases.\r\n\r\nWith the giraffe, the continued preservation of the individuals of some\r\nextinct high-reaching ruminant, which had the longest necks, legs, &c.,\r\nand could browse a little above the average height, and the continued\r\ndestruction of those which could not browse so high, would have\r\nsufficed for the production of this remarkable quadruped; but the\r\nprolonged use of all the parts, together with inheritance, will have\r\naided in an important manner in their co-ordination. With the many\r\ninsects which imitate various objects, there is no improbability in the\r\nbelief that an accidental resemblance to some common object was in each\r\ncase the foundation for the work of natural selection, since perfected\r\nthrough the occasional preservation of slight variations which made the\r\nresemblance at all closer; and this will have been carried on as long\r\nas the insect continued to vary, and as long as a more and more perfect\r\nresemblance led to its escape from sharp-sighted enemies. In certain\r\nspecies of whales there is a tendency to the formation of irregular\r\nlittle points of horn on the palate; and it seems to be quite within\r\nthe scope of natural selection to preserve all favourable variations,\r\nuntil the points were converted, first into lamellated knobs or teeth,\r\nlike those on the beak of a goose—then into short lamellæ, like those\r\nof the domestic ducks—and then into lamellæ, as perfect as those of the\r\nshoveller-duck—and finally into the gigantic plates of baleen, as in\r\nthe mouth of the Greenland whale. In the family of the ducks, the\r\nlamellæ are first used as teeth, then partly as teeth and partly as a\r\nsifting apparatus, and at last almost exclusively for this latter\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nWith such structures as the above lamellæ of horn or whalebone, habit\r\nor use can have done little or nothing, as far as we can judge, towards\r\ntheir development. On the other hand, the transportal of the lower eye\r\nof a flat-fish to the upper side of the head, and the formation of a\r\nprehensile tail, may be attributed almost wholly to continued use,\r\ntogether with inheritance. With respect to the mammæ of the higher\r\nanimals, the most probable conjecture is that primordially the\r\ncutaneous glands over the whole surface of a marsupial sack secreted a\r\nnutritious fluid; and that these glands were improved in function\r\nthrough natural selection, and concentrated into a confined area, in\r\nwhich case they would have formed a mamma. There is no more difficulty\r\nin understanding how the branched spines of some ancient Echinoderm,\r\nwhich served as a defence, became developed through natural selection\r\ninto tridactyle pedicellariæ, than in understanding the development of\r\nthe pincers of crustaceans, through slight, serviceable modifications\r\nin the ultimate and penultimate segments of a limb, which was at first\r\nused solely for locomotion. In the avicularia and vibracula of the\r\nPolyzoa we have organs widely different in appearance developed from\r\nthe same source; and with the vibracula we can understand how the\r\nsuccessive gradations might have been of service. With the pollinia of\r\norchids, the threads which originally served to tie together the\r\npollen-grains, can be traced cohering into caudicles; and the steps can\r\nlikewise be followed by which viscid matter, such as that secreted by\r\nthe stigmas of ordinary flowers, and still subserving nearly but not\r\nquite the same purpose, became attached to the free ends of the\r\ncaudicles—all these gradations being of manifest benefit to the plants\r\nin question. With respect to climbing plants, I need not repeat what\r\nhas been so lately said.\r\n\r\nIt has often been asked, if natural selection be so potent, why has not\r\nthis or that structure been gained by certain species, to which it\r\nwould apparently have been advantageous? But it is unreasonable to\r\nexpect a precise answer to such questions, considering our ignorance of\r\nthe past history of each species, and of the conditions which at the\r\npresent day determine its numbers and range. In most cases only general\r\nreasons, but in some few cases special reasons, can be assigned. Thus\r\nto adapt a species to new habits of life, many co-ordinated\r\nmodifications are almost indispensable, and it may often have happened\r\nthat the requisite parts did not vary in the right manner or to the\r\nright degree. Many species must have been prevented from increasing in\r\nnumbers through destructive agencies, which stood in no relation to\r\ncertain structures, which we imagine would have been gained through\r\nnatural selection from appearing to us advantageous to the species. In\r\nthis case, as the struggle for life did not depend on such structures,\r\nthey could not have been acquired through natural selection. In many\r\ncases complex and long-enduring conditions, often of a peculiar nature,\r\nare necessary for the development of a structure; and the requisite\r\nconditions may seldom have concurred. The belief that any given\r\nstructure, which we think, often erroneously, would have been\r\nbeneficial to a species, would have been gained under all circumstances\r\nthrough natural selection, is opposed to what we can understand of its\r\nmanner of action. Mr. Mivart does not deny that natural selection has\r\neffected something; but he considers it as “demonstrably insufficient”\r\nto account for the phenomena which I explain by its agency. His chief\r\narguments have now been considered, and the others will hereafter be\r\nconsidered. They seem to me to partake little of the character of\r\ndemonstration, and to have little weight in comparison with those in\r\nfavour of the power of natural selection, aided by the other agencies\r\noften specified. I am bound to add, that some of the facts and\r\narguments here used by me, have been advanced for the same purpose in\r\nan able article lately published in the “Medico-Chirurgical Review.”\r\n\r\nAt the present day almost all naturalists admit evolution under some\r\nform. Mr. Mivart believes that species change through “an internal\r\nforce or tendency,” about which it is not pretended that anything is\r\nknown. That species have a capacity for change will be admitted by all\r\nevolutionists; but there is no need, as it seems to me, to invoke any\r\ninternal force beyond the tendency to ordinary variability, which\r\nthrough the aid of selection, by man has given rise to many\r\nwell-adapted domestic races, and which, through the aid of natural\r\nselection, would equally well give rise by graduated steps to natural\r\nraces or species. The final result will generally have been, as already\r\nexplained, an advance, but in some few cases a retrogression, in\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\nMr. Mivart is further inclined to believe, and some naturalists agree\r\nwith him, that new species manifest themselves “with suddenness and by\r\nmodifications appearing at once.” For instance, he supposes that the\r\ndifferences between the extinct three-toed Hipparion and the horse\r\narose suddenly. He thinks it difficult to believe that the wing of a\r\nbird “was developed in any other way than by a comparatively sudden\r\nmodification of a marked and important kind;” and apparently he would\r\nextend the same view to the wings of bats and pterodactyles. This\r\nconclusion, which implies great breaks or discontinuity in the series,\r\nappears to me improbable in the highest degree.\r\n\r\nEveryone who believes in slow and gradual evolution, will of course\r\nadmit that specific changes may have been as abrupt and as great as any\r\nsingle variation which we meet with under nature, or even under\r\ndomestication. But as species are more variable when domesticated or\r\ncultivated than under their natural conditions, it is not probable that\r\nsuch great and abrupt variations have often occurred under nature, as\r\nare known occasionally to arise under domestication. Of these latter\r\nvariations several may be attributed to reversion; and the characters\r\nwhich thus reappear were, it is probable, in many cases at first gained\r\nin a gradual manner. A still greater number must be called\r\nmonstrosities, such as six-fingered men, porcupine men, Ancon sheep,\r\nNiata cattle, &c.; and as they are widely different in character from\r\nnatural species, they throw very little light on our subject. Excluding\r\nsuch cases of abrupt variations, the few which remain would at best\r\nconstitute, if found in a state of nature, doubtful species, closely\r\nrelated to their parental types.\r\n\r\nMy reasons for doubting whether natural species have changed as\r\nabruptly as have occasionally domestic races, and for entirely\r\ndisbelieving that they have changed in the wonderful manner indicated\r\nby Mr. Mivart, are as follows. According to our experience, abrupt and\r\nstrongly marked variations occur in our domesticated productions,\r\nsingly and at rather long intervals of time. If such occurred under\r\nnature, they would be liable, as formerly explained, to be lost by\r\naccidental causes of destruction and by subsequent intercrossing; and\r\nso it is known to be under domestication, unless abrupt variations of\r\nthis kind are specially preserved and separated by the care of man.\r\nHence, in order that a new species should suddenly appear in the manner\r\nsupposed by Mr. Mivart, it is almost necessary to believe, in\r\nopposition to all analogy, that several wonderfully changed individuals\r\nappeared simultaneously within the same district. This difficulty, as\r\nin the case of unconscious selection by man, is avoided on the theory\r\nof gradual evolution, through the preservation of a large number of\r\nindividuals, which varied more or less in any favourable direction, and\r\nof the destruction of a large number which varied in an opposite\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThat many species have been evolved in an extremely gradual manner,\r\nthere can hardly be a doubt. The species and even the genera of many\r\nlarge natural families are so closely allied together that it is\r\ndifficult to distinguish not a few of them. On every continent, in\r\nproceeding from north to south, from lowland to upland, &c., we meet\r\nwith a host of closely related or representative species; as we\r\nlikewise do on certain distinct continents, which we have reason to\r\nbelieve were formerly connected. But in making these and the following\r\nremarks, I am compelled to allude to subjects hereafter to be\r\ndiscussed. Look at the many outlying islands round a continent, and see\r\nhow many of their inhabitants can be raised only to the rank of\r\ndoubtful species. So it is if we look to past times, and compare the\r\nspecies which have just passed away with those still living within the\r\nsame areas; or if we compare the fossil species embedded in the\r\nsub-stages of the same geological formation. It is indeed manifest that\r\nmultitudes of species are related in the closest manner to other\r\nspecies that still exist, or have lately existed; and it will hardly be\r\nmaintained that such species have been developed in an abrupt or sudden\r\nmanner. Nor should it be forgotten, when we look to the special parts\r\nof allied species, instead of to distinct species, that numerous and\r\nwonderfully fine gradations can be traced, connecting together widely\r\ndifferent structures.\r\n\r\nMany large groups of facts are intelligible only on the principle that\r\nspecies have been evolved by very small steps. For instance, the fact\r\nthat the species included in the larger genera are more closely related\r\nto each other, and present a greater number of varieties than do the\r\nspecies in the smaller genera. The former are also grouped in little\r\nclusters, like varieties round species; and they present other\r\nanalogies with varieties, as was shown in our second chapter. On this\r\nsame principle we can understand how it is that specific characters are\r\nmore variable than generic characters; and how the parts which are\r\ndeveloped in an extraordinary degree or manner are more variable than\r\nother parts of the same species. Many analogous facts, all pointing in\r\nthe same direction, could be added.\r\n\r\nAlthough very many species have almost certainly been produced by steps\r\nnot greater than those separating fine varieties; yet it may be\r\nmaintained that some have been developed in a different and abrupt\r\nmanner. Such an admission, however, ought not to be made without strong\r\nevidence being assigned. The vague and in some respects false\r\nanalogies, as they have been shown to be by Mr. Chauncey Wright, which\r\nhave been advanced in favour of this view, such as the sudden\r\ncrystallisation of inorganic substances, or the falling of a facetted\r\nspheroid from one facet to another, hardly deserve consideration. One\r\nclass of facts, however, namely, the sudden appearance of new and\r\ndistinct forms of life in our geological formations supports at first\r\nsight the belief in abrupt development. But the value of this evidence\r\ndepends entirely on the perfection of the geological record, in\r\nrelation to periods remote in the history of the world. If the record\r\nis as fragmentary as many geologists strenuously assert, there is\r\nnothing strange in new forms appearing as if suddenly developed.\r\n\r\nUnless we admit transformations as prodigious as those advocated by Mr.\r\nMivart, such as the sudden development of the wings of birds or bats,\r\nor the sudden conversion of a Hipparion into a horse, hardly any light\r\nis thrown by the belief in abrupt modifications on the deficiency of\r\nconnecting links in our geological formations. But against the belief\r\nin such abrupt changes, embryology enters a strong protest. It is\r\nnotorious that the wings of birds and bats, and the legs of horses or\r\nother quadrupeds, are undistinguishable at an early embryonic period,\r\nand that they become differentiated by insensibly fine steps.\r\nEmbryological resemblances of all kinds can be accounted for, as we\r\nshall hereafter see, by the progenitors of our existing species having\r\nvaried after early youth, and having transmitted their newly-acquired\r\ncharacters to their offspring, at a corresponding age. The embryo is\r\nthus left almost unaffected, and serves as a record of the past\r\ncondition of the species. Hence it is that existing species during the\r\nearly stages of their development so often resemble ancient and extinct\r\nforms belonging to the same class. On this view of the meaning of\r\nembryological resemblances, and indeed on any view, it is incredible\r\nthat an animal should have undergone such momentous and abrupt\r\ntransformations as those above indicated, and yet should not bear even\r\na trace in its embryonic condition of any sudden modification, every\r\ndetail in its structure being developed by insensibly fine steps.\r\n\r\nHe who believes that some ancient form was transformed suddenly through\r\nan internal force or tendency into, for instance, one furnished with\r\nwings, will be almost compelled to assume, in opposition to all\r\nanalogy, that many individuals varied simultaneously. It cannot be\r\ndenied that such abrupt and great changes of structure are widely\r\ndifferent from those which most species apparently have undergone. He\r\nwill further be compelled to believe that many structures beautifully\r\nadapted to all the other parts of the same creature and to the\r\nsurrounding conditions, have been suddenly produced; and of such\r\ncomplex and wonderful co-adaptations, he will not be able to assign a\r\nshadow of an explanation. He will be forced to admit that these great\r\nand sudden transformations have left no trace of their action on the\r\nembryo. To admit all this is, as it seems to me, to enter into the\r\nrealms of miracle, and to leave those of science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nINSTINCT.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstincts comparable with habits, but different in their\r\norigin—Instincts graduated—Aphides and ants—Instincts variable—Domestic\r\ninstincts, their origin—Natural instincts of the cuckoo, molothrus,\r\nostrich, and parasitic bees—Slave-making ants—Hive-bee, its cell-making\r\ninstinct—Changes of instinct and structure not necessarily\r\nsimultaneous—Difficulties of the theory of the Natural Selection of\r\ninstincts—Neuter or sterile insects—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany instincts are so wonderful that their development will probably\r\nappear to the reader a difficulty sufficient to overthrow my whole\r\ntheory. I may here premise, that I have nothing to do with the origin\r\nof the mental powers, any more than I have with that of life itself. We\r\nare concerned only with the diversities of instinct and of the other\r\nmental faculties in animals of the same class.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt any definition of instinct. It would be easy to show\r\nthat several distinct mental actions are commonly embraced by this\r\nterm; but every one understands what is meant, when it is said that\r\ninstinct impels the cuckoo to migrate and to lay her eggs in other\r\nbirds’ nests. An action, which we ourselves require experience to\r\nenable us to perform, when performed by an animal, more especially by a\r\nvery young one, without experience, and when performed by many\r\nindividuals in the same way, without their knowing for what purpose it\r\nis performed, is usually said to be instinctive. But I could show that\r\nnone of these characters are universal. A little dose of judgment or\r\nreason, as Pierre Huber expresses it, often comes into play, even with\r\nanimals low in the scale of nature.\r\n\r\nFrederick Cuvier and several of the older metaphysicians have compared\r\ninstinct with habit. This comparison gives, I think, an accurate notion\r\nof the frame of mind under which an instinctive action is performed,\r\nbut not necessarily of its origin. How unconsciously many habitual\r\nactions are performed, indeed not rarely in direct opposition to our\r\nconscious will! yet they may be modified by the will or reason. Habits\r\neasily become associated with other habits, with certain periods of\r\ntime and states of the body. When once acquired, they often remain\r\nconstant throughout life. Several other points of resemblance between\r\ninstincts and habits could be pointed out. As in repeating a well-known\r\nsong, so in instincts, one action follows another by a sort of rhythm;\r\nif a person be interrupted in a song, or in repeating anything by rote,\r\nhe is generally forced to go back to recover the habitual train of\r\nthought: so P. Huber found it was with a caterpillar, which makes a\r\nvery complicated hammock; for if he took a caterpillar which had\r\ncompleted its hammock up to, say, the sixth stage of construction, and\r\nput it into a hammock completed up only to the third stage, the\r\ncaterpillar simply re-performed the fourth, fifth, and sixth stages of\r\nconstruction. If, however, a caterpillar were taken out of a hammock\r\nmade up, for instance, to the third stage, and were put into one\r\nfinished up to the sixth stage, so that much of its work was already\r\ndone for it, far from deriving any benefit from this, it was much\r\nembarrassed, and, in order to complete its hammock, seemed forced to\r\nstart from the third stage, where it had left off, and thus tried to\r\ncomplete the already finished work.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose any habitual action to become inherited—and it can be\r\nshown that this does sometimes happen—then the resemblance between what\r\noriginally was a habit and an instinct becomes so close as not to be\r\ndistinguished. If Mozart, instead of playing the pianoforte at three\r\nyears old with wonderfully little practice, had played a tune with no\r\npractice at all, be might truly be said to have done so instinctively.\r\nBut it would be a serious error to suppose that the greater number of\r\ninstincts have been acquired by habit in one generation, and then\r\ntransmitted by inheritance to succeeding generations. It can be clearly\r\nshown that the most wonderful instincts with which we are acquainted,\r\nnamely, those of the hive-bee and of many ants, could not possibly have\r\nbeen acquired by habit.\r\n\r\nIt will be universally admitted that instincts are as important as\r\ncorporeal structures for the welfare of each species, under its present\r\nconditions of life. Under changed conditions of life, it is at least\r\npossible that slight modifications of instinct might be profitable to a\r\nspecies; and if it can be shown that instincts do vary ever so little,\r\nthen I can see no difficulty in natural selection preserving and\r\ncontinually accumulating variations of instinct to any extent that was\r\nprofitable. It is thus, as I believe, that all the most complex and\r\nwonderful instincts have originated. As modifications of corporeal\r\nstructure arise from, and are increased by, use or habit, and are\r\ndiminished or lost by disuse, so I do not doubt it has been with\r\ninstincts. But I believe that the effects of habit are in many cases of\r\nsubordinate importance to the effects of the natural selection of what\r\nmay be called spontaneous variations of instincts;—that is of\r\nvariations produced by the same unknown causes which produce slight\r\ndeviations of bodily structure.\r\n\r\nNo complex instinct can possibly be produced through natural selection,\r\nexcept by the slow and gradual accumulation of numerous, slight, yet\r\nprofitable, variations. Hence, as in the case of corporeal structures,\r\nwe ought to find in nature, not the actual transitional gradations by\r\nwhich each complex instinct has been acquired—for these could be found\r\nonly in the lineal ancestors of each species—but we ought to find in\r\nthe collateral lines of descent some evidence of such gradations; or we\r\nought at least to be able to show that gradations of some kind are\r\npossible; and this we certainly can do. I have been surprised to find,\r\nmaking allowance for the instincts of animals having been but little\r\nobserved, except in Europe and North America, and for no instinct being\r\nknown among extinct species, how very generally gradations, leading to\r\nthe most complex instincts, can be discovered. Changes of instinct may\r\nsometimes be facilitated by the same species having different instincts\r\nat different periods of life, or at different seasons of the year, or\r\nwhen placed under different circumstances, &c.; in which case either\r\nthe one or the other instinct might be preserved by natural selection.\r\nAnd such instances of diversity of instinct in the same species can be\r\nshown to occur in nature.\r\n\r\nAgain, as in the case of corporeal structure, and conformably to my\r\ntheory, the instinct of each species is good for itself, but has never,\r\nas far as we can judge, been produced for the exclusive good of others.\r\nOne of the strongest instances of an animal apparently performing an\r\naction for the sole good of another, with which I am acquainted, is\r\nthat of aphides voluntarily yielding, as was first observed by Huber,\r\ntheir sweet excretion to ants: that they do so voluntarily, the\r\nfollowing facts show. I removed all the ants from a group of about a\r\ndozen aphides on a dock-plant, and prevented their attendance during\r\nseveral hours. After this interval, I felt sure that the aphides would\r\nwant to excrete. I watched them for some time through a lens, but not\r\none excreted; I then tickled and stroked them with a hair in the same\r\nmanner, as well as I could, as the ants do with their antennæ; but not\r\none excreted. Afterwards, I allowed an ant to visit them, and it\r\nimmediately seemed, by its eager way of running about to be well aware\r\nwhat a rich flock it had discovered; it then began to play with its\r\nantennæ on the abdomen first of one aphis and then of another; and\r\neach, as soon as it felt the antennæ, immediately lifted up its abdomen\r\nand excreted a limpid drop of sweet juice, which was eagerly devoured\r\nby the ant. Even the quite young aphides behaved in this manner,\r\nshowing that the action was instinctive, and not the result of\r\nexperience. It is certain, from the observations of Huber, that the\r\naphides show no dislike to the ants: if the latter be not present they\r\nare at last compelled to eject their excretion. But as the excretion is\r\nextremely viscid, it is no doubt a convenience to the aphides to have\r\nit removed; therefore probably they do not excrete solely for the good\r\nof the ants. Although there is no evidence that any animal performs an\r\naction for the exclusive good of another species, yet each tries to\r\ntake advantage of the instincts of others, as each takes advantage of\r\nthe weaker bodily structure of other species. So again certain\r\ninstincts cannot be considered as absolutely perfect; but as details on\r\nthis and other such points are not indispensable, they may be here\r\npassed over.\r\n\r\nAs some degree of variation in instincts under a state of nature, and\r\nthe inheritance of such variations, are indispensable for the action of\r\nnatural selection, as many instances as possible ought to be given; but\r\nwant of space prevents me. I can only assert that instincts certainly\r\ndo vary—for instance, the migratory instinct, both in extent and\r\ndirection, and in its total loss. So it is with the nests of birds,\r\nwhich vary partly in dependence on the situations chosen, and on the\r\nnature and temperature of the country inhabited, but often from causes\r\nwholly unknown to us. Audubon has given several remarkable cases of\r\ndifferences in the nests of the same species in the northern and\r\nsouthern United States. Why, it has been asked, if instinct be\r\nvariable, has it not granted to the bee “the ability to use some other\r\nmaterial when wax was deficient?” But what other natural material could\r\nbees use? They will work, as I have seen, with wax hardened with\r\nvermilion or softened with lard. Andrew Knight observed that his bees,\r\ninstead of laboriously collecting propolis, used a cement of wax and\r\nturpentine, with which he had covered decorticated trees. It has lately\r\nbeen shown that bees, instead of searching for pollen, will gladly use\r\na very different substance, namely, oatmeal. Fear of any particular\r\nenemy is certainly an instinctive quality, as may be seen in nestling\r\nbirds, though it is strengthened by experience, and by the sight of\r\nfear of the same enemy in other animals. The fear of man is slowly\r\nacquired, as I have elsewhere shown, by the various animals which\r\ninhabit desert islands; and we see an instance of this, even in\r\nEngland, in the greater wildness of all our large birds in comparison\r\nwith our small birds; for the large birds have been most persecuted by\r\nman. We may safely attribute the greater wildness of our large birds to\r\nthis cause; for in uninhabited islands large birds are not more fearful\r\nthan small; and the magpie, so wary in England, is tame in Norway, as\r\nis the hooded crow in Egypt.\r\n\r\nThat the mental qualities of animals of the same kind, born in a state\r\nof nature, vary much, could be shown by many facts. Several cases could\r\nalso be adduced of occasional and strange habits in wild animals,\r\nwhich, if advantageous to the species, might have given rise, through\r\nnatural selection, to new instincts. But I am well aware that these\r\ngeneral statements, without the facts in detail, can produce but a\r\nfeeble effect on the reader’s mind. I can only repeat my assurance,\r\nthat I do not speak without good evidence.\r\n\r\n_Inherited Changes of Habit or Instinct in Domesticated Animals._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe possibility, or even probability, of inherited variations of\r\ninstinct in a state of nature will be strengthened by briefly\r\nconsidering a few cases under domestication. We shall thus be enabled\r\nto see the part which habit and the selection of so-called spontaneous\r\nvariations have played in modifying the mental qualities of our\r\ndomestic animals. It is notorious how much domestic animals vary in\r\ntheir mental qualities. With cats, for instance, one naturally takes to\r\ncatching rats, and another mice, and these tendencies are known to be\r\ninherited. One cat, according to Mr. St. John, always brought home game\r\nbirds, another hares or rabbits, and another hunted on marshy ground\r\nand almost nightly caught woodcocks or snipes. A number of curious and\r\nauthentic instances could be given of various shades of disposition and\r\ntaste, and likewise of the oddest tricks, associated with certain\r\nframes of mind or periods of time. But let us look to the familiar case\r\nof the breeds of dogs: it cannot be doubted that young pointers (I have\r\nmyself seen striking instances) will sometimes point and even back\r\nother dogs the very first time that they are taken out; retrieving is\r\ncertainly in some degree inherited by retrievers; and a tendency to run\r\nround, instead of at, a flock of sheep, by shepherd-dogs. I cannot see\r\nthat these actions, performed without experience by the young, and in\r\nnearly the same manner by each individual, performed with eager delight\r\nby each breed, and without the end being known—for the young pointer\r\ncan no more know that he points to aid his master, than the white\r\nbutterfly knows why she lays her eggs on the leaf of the cabbage—I\r\ncannot see that these actions differ essentially from true instincts.\r\nIf we were to behold one kind of wolf, when young and without any\r\ntraining, as soon as it scented its prey, stand motionless like a\r\nstatue, and then slowly crawl forward with a peculiar gait; and another\r\nkind of wolf rushing round, instead of at, a herd of deer, and driving\r\nthem to a distant point, we should assuredly call these actions\r\ninstinctive. Domestic instincts, as they may be called, are certainly\r\nfar less fixed than natural instincts; but they have been acted on by\r\nfar less rigorous selection, and have been transmitted for an\r\nincomparably shorter period, under less fixed conditions of life.\r\n\r\nHow strongly these domestic instincts, habits, and dispositions are\r\ninherited, and how curiously they become mingled, is well shown when\r\ndifferent breeds of dogs are crossed. Thus it is known that a cross\r\nwith a bull-dog has affected for many generations the courage and\r\nobstinacy of greyhounds; and a cross with a greyhound has given to a\r\nwhole family of shepherd-dogs a tendency to hunt hares. These domestic\r\ninstincts, when thus tested by crossing, resemble natural instincts,\r\nwhich in a like manner become curiously blended together, and for a\r\nlong period exhibit traces of the instincts of either parent: for\r\nexample, Le Roy describes a dog, whose great-grandfather was a wolf,\r\nand this dog showed a trace of its wild parentage only in one way, by\r\nnot coming in a straight line to his master, when called.\r\n\r\nDomestic instincts are sometimes spoken of as actions which have become\r\ninherited solely from long-continued and compulsory habit, but this is\r\nnot true. No one would ever have thought of teaching, or probably could\r\nhave taught, the tumbler-pigeon to tumble—an action which, as I have\r\nwitnessed, is performed by young birds, that have never seen a pigeon\r\ntumble. We may believe that some one pigeon showed a slight tendency to\r\nthis strange habit, and that the long-continued selection of the best\r\nindividuals in successive generations made tumblers what they now are;\r\nand near Glasgow there are house-tumblers, as I hear from Mr. Brent,\r\nwhich cannot fly eighteen inches high without going head over heels. It\r\nmay be doubted whether any one would have thought of training a dog to\r\npoint, had not some one dog naturally shown a tendency in this line;\r\nand this is known occasionally to happen, as I once saw, in a pure\r\nterrier: the act of pointing is probably, as many have thought, only\r\nthe exaggerated pause of an animal preparing to spring on its prey.\r\nWhen the first tendency to point was once displayed, methodical\r\nselection and the inherited effects of compulsory training in each\r\nsuccessive generation would soon complete the work; and unconscious\r\nselection is still in progress, as each man tries to procure, without\r\nintending to improve the breed, dogs which stand and hunt best. On the\r\nother hand, habit alone in some cases has sufficed; hardly any animal\r\nis more difficult to tame than the young of the wild rabbit; scarcely\r\nany animal is tamer than the young of the tame rabbit; but I can hardly\r\nsuppose that domestic rabbits have often been selected for tameness\r\nalone; so that we must attribute at least the greater part of the\r\ninherited change from extreme wildness to extreme tameness, to habit\r\nand long-continued close confinement.\r\n\r\nNatural instincts are lost under domestication: a remarkable instance\r\nof this is seen in those breeds of fowls which very rarely or never\r\nbecome “broody,” that is, never wish to sit on their eggs. Familiarity\r\nalone prevents our seeing how largely and how permanently the minds of\r\nour domestic animals have been modified. It is scarcely possible to\r\ndoubt that the love of man has become instinctive in the dog. All\r\nwolves, foxes, jackals and species of the cat genus, when kept tame,\r\nare most eager to attack poultry, sheep and pigs; and this tendency has\r\nbeen found incurable in dogs which have been brought home as puppies\r\nfrom countries such as Tierra del Fuego and Australia, where the\r\nsavages do not keep these domestic animals. How rarely, on the other\r\nhand, do our civilised dogs, even when quite young, require to be\r\ntaught not to attack poultry, sheep, and pigs! No doubt they\r\noccasionally do make an attack, and are then beaten; and if not cured,\r\nthey are destroyed; so that habit and some degree of selection have\r\nprobably concurred in civilising by inheritance our dogs. On the other\r\nhand, young chickens have lost wholly by habit, that fear of the dog\r\nand cat which no doubt was originally instinctive in them, for I am\r\ninformed by Captain Hutton that the young chickens of the parent stock,\r\nthe Gallus bankiva, when reared in India under a hen, are at first\r\nexcessively wild. So it is with young pheasants reared in England under\r\na hen. It is not that chickens have lost all fear, but fear only of\r\ndogs and cats, for if the hen gives the danger chuckle they will run\r\n(more especially young turkeys) from under her and conceal themselves\r\nin the surrounding grass or thickets; and this is evidently done for\r\nthe instinctive purpose of allowing, as we see in wild ground-birds,\r\ntheir mother to fly away. But this instinct retained by our chickens\r\nhas become useless under domestication, for the mother-hen has almost\r\nlost by disuse the power of flight.\r\n\r\nHence, we may conclude that under domestication instincts have been\r\nacquired and natural instincts have been lost, partly by habit and\r\npartly by man selecting and accumulating, during successive\r\ngenerations, peculiar mental habits and actions, which at first\r\nappeared from what we must in our ignorance call an accident. In some\r\ncases compulsory habit alone has sufficed to produce inherited mental\r\nchanges; in other cases compulsory habit has done nothing, and all has\r\nbeen the result of selection, pursued both methodically and\r\nunconsciously; but in most cases habit and selection have probably\r\nconcurred.\r\n\r\n_Special Instincts._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall, perhaps, best understand how instincts in a state of nature\r\nhave become modified by selection by considering a few cases. I will\r\nselect only three, namely, the instinct which leads the cuckoo to lay\r\nher eggs in other birds’ nests; the slave-making instinct of certain\r\nants; and the cell-making power of the hive-bee: these two latter\r\ninstincts have generally and justly been ranked by naturalists as the\r\nmost wonderful of all known instincts.\r\n\r\n_Instincts of the Cuckoo._—It is supposed by some naturalists that the\r\nmore immediate cause of the instinct of the cuckoo is that she lays her\r\neggs, not daily, but at intervals of two or three days; so that, if she\r\nwere to make her own nest and sit on her own eggs, those first laid\r\nwould have to be left for some time unincubated or there would be eggs\r\nand young birds of different ages in the same nest. If this were the\r\ncase the process of laying and hatching might be inconveniently long,\r\nmore especially as she migrates at a very early period; and the first\r\nhatched young would probably have to be fed by the male alone. But the\r\nAmerican cuckoo is in this predicament, for she makes her own nest and\r\nhas eggs and young successively hatched, all at the same time. It has\r\nbeen both asserted and denied that the American cuckoo occasionally\r\nlays her eggs in other birds’ nests; but I have lately heard from Dr.\r\nMerrill, of Iowa, that he once found in Illinois a young cuckoo,\r\ntogether with a young jay in the nest of a blue jay (Garrulus\r\ncristatus); and as both were nearly full feathered, there could be no\r\nmistake in their identification. I could also give several instances of\r\nvarious birds which have been known occasionally to lay their eggs in\r\nother birds’ nests. Now let us suppose that the ancient progenitor of\r\nour European cuckoo had the habits of the American cuckoo, and that she\r\noccasionally laid an egg in another bird’s nest. If the old bird\r\nprofited by this occasional habit through being enabled to emigrate\r\nearlier or through any other cause; or if the young were made more\r\nvigorous by advantage being taken of the mistaken instinct of another\r\nspecies than when reared by their own mother, encumbered as she could\r\nhardly fail to be by having eggs and young of different ages at the\r\nsame time, then the old birds or the fostered young would gain an\r\nadvantage. And analogy would lead us to believe, that the young thus\r\nreared would be apt to follow by inheritance the occasional and\r\naberrant habit of their mother, and in their turn would be apt to lay\r\ntheir eggs in other birds’ nests, and thus be more successful in\r\nrearing their young. By a continued process of this nature, I believe\r\nthat the strange instinct of our cuckoo has been generated. It has,\r\nalso recently been ascertained on sufficient evidence, by Adolf Müller,\r\nthat the cuckoo occasionally lays her eggs on the bare ground, sits on\r\nthem and feeds her young. This rare event is probably a case of\r\nreversion to the long-lost, aboriginal instinct of nidification.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected that I have not noticed other related instincts\r\nand adaptations of structure in the cuckoo, which are spoken of as\r\nnecessarily co-ordinated. But in all cases, speculation on an instinct\r\nknown to us only in a single species, is useless, for we have hitherto\r\nhad no facts to guide us. Until recently the instincts of the European\r\nand of the non-parasitic American cuckoo alone were known; now, owing\r\nto Mr. Ramsay’s observations, we have learned something about three\r\nAustralian species, which lay their eggs in other birds’ nests. The\r\nchief points to be referred to are three: first, that the common\r\ncuckoo, with rare exceptions, lays only one egg in a nest, so that the\r\nlarge and voracious young bird receives ample food. Secondly, that the\r\neggs are remarkably small, not exceeding those of the skylark—a bird\r\nabout one-fourth as large as the cuckoo. That the small size of the egg\r\nis a real case of adaptation we may infer from the fact of the\r\nmon-parasitic American cuckoo laying full-sized eggs. Thirdly, that the\r\nyoung cuckoo, soon after birth, has the instinct, the strength and a\r\nproperly shaped back for ejecting its foster-brothers, which then\r\nperish from cold and hunger. This has been boldly called a beneficent\r\narrangement, in order that the young cuckoo may get sufficient food,\r\nand that its foster-brothers may perish before they had acquired much\r\nfeeling!\r\n\r\nTurning now to the Australian species: though these birds generally lay\r\nonly one egg in a nest, it is not rare to find two and even three eggs\r\nin the same nest. In the bronze cuckoo the eggs vary greatly in size,\r\nfrom eight to ten lines in length. Now, if it had been of an advantage\r\nto this species to have laid eggs even smaller than those now laid, so\r\nas to have deceived certain foster-parents, or, as is more probable, to\r\nhave been hatched within a shorter period (for it is asserted that\r\nthere is a relation between the size of eggs and the period of their\r\nincubation), then there is no difficulty in believing that a race or\r\nspecies might have been formed which would have laid smaller and\r\nsmaller eggs; for these would have been more safely hatched and reared.\r\nMr. Ramsay remarks that two of the Australian cuckoos, when they lay\r\ntheir eggs in an open nest, manifest a decided preference for nests\r\ncontaining eggs similar in colour to their own. The European species\r\napparently manifests some tendency towards a similar instinct, but not\r\nrarely departs from it, as is shown by her laying her dull and\r\npale-coloured eggs in the nest of the hedge-warbler with bright\r\ngreenish-blue eggs. Had our cuckoo invariably displayed the above\r\ninstinct, it would assuredly have been added to those which it is\r\nassumed must all have been acquired together. The eggs of the\r\nAustralian bronze cuckoo vary, according to Mr. Ramsay, to an\r\nextraordinary degree in colour; so that in this respect, as well as in\r\nsize, natural selection might have secured and fixed any advantageous\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the European cuckoo, the offspring of the foster-parents\r\nare commonly ejected from the nest within three days after the cuckoo\r\nis hatched; and as the latter at this age is in a most helpless\r\ncondition, Mr. Gould was formerly inclined to believe that the act of\r\nejection was performed by the foster-parents themselves. But he has now\r\nreceived a trustworthy account of a young cuckoo which was actually\r\nseen, while still blind and not able even to hold up its own head, in\r\nthe act of ejecting its foster-brothers. One of these was replaced in\r\nthe nest by the observer, and was again thrown out. With respect to the\r\nmeans by which this strange and odious instinct was acquired, if it\r\nwere of great importance for the young cuckoo, as is probably the case,\r\nto receive as much food as possible soon after birth, I can see no\r\nspecial difficulty in its having gradually acquired, during successive\r\ngenerations, the blind desire, the strength, and structure necessary\r\nfor the work of ejection; for those cuckoos which had such habits and\r\nstructure best developed would be the most securely reared. The first\r\nstep towards the acquisition of the proper instinct might have been\r\nmere unintentional restlessness on the part of the young bird, when\r\nsomewhat advanced in age and strength; the habit having been afterwards\r\nimproved, and transmitted to an earlier age. I can see no more\r\ndifficulty in this than in the unhatched young of other birds acquiring\r\nthe instinct to break through their own shells; or than in young snakes\r\nacquiring in their upper jaws, as Owen has remarked, a transitory sharp\r\ntooth for cutting through the tough egg-shell. For if each part is\r\nliable to individual variations at all ages, and the variations tend to\r\nbe inherited at a corresponding or earlier age—propositions which\r\ncannot be disputed—then the instincts and structure of the young could\r\nbe slowly modified as surely as those of the adult; and both cases must\r\nstand or fall together with the whole theory of natural selection.\r\n\r\nSome species of Molothrus, a widely distinct genus of American birds,\r\nallied to our starlings, have parasitic habits like those of the\r\ncuckoo; and the species present an interesting gradation in the\r\nperfection of their instincts. The sexes of Molothrus badius are stated\r\nby an excellent observer, Mr. Hudson, sometimes to live promiscuously\r\ntogether in flocks, and sometimes to pair. They either build a nest of\r\ntheir own or seize on one belonging to some other bird, occasionally\r\nthrowing out the nestlings of the stranger. They either lay their eggs\r\nin the nest thus appropriated, or oddly enough build one for themselves\r\non the top of it. They usually sit on their own eggs and rear their own\r\nyoung; but Mr. Hudson says it is probable that they are occasionally\r\nparasitic, for he has seen the young of this species following old\r\nbirds of a distinct kind and clamouring to be fed by them. The\r\nparasitic habits of another species of Molothrus, the M. bonariensis,\r\nare much more highly developed than those of the last, but are still\r\nfar from perfect. This bird, as far as it is known, invariably lays its\r\neggs in the nests of strangers; but it is remarkable that several\r\ntogether sometimes commence to build an irregular untidy nest of their\r\nown, placed in singular ill-adapted situations, as on the leaves of a\r\nlarge thistle. They never, however, as far as Mr. Hudson has\r\nascertained, complete a nest for themselves. They often lay so many\r\neggs—from fifteen to twenty—in the same foster-nest, that few or none\r\ncan possibly be hatched. They have, moreover, the extraordinary habit\r\nof pecking holes in the eggs, whether of their own species or of their\r\nfoster parents, which they find in the appropriated nests. They drop\r\nalso many eggs on the bare ground, which are thus wasted. A third\r\nspecies, the M. pecoris of North America, has acquired instincts as\r\nperfect as those of the cuckoo, for it never lays more than one egg in\r\na foster-nest, so that the young bird is securely reared. Mr. Hudson is\r\na strong disbeliever in evolution, but he appears to have been so much\r\nstruck by the imperfect instincts of the Molothrus bonariensis that he\r\nquotes my words, and asks, “Must we consider these habits, not as\r\nespecially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of\r\none general law, namely, transition?”\r\n\r\nVarious birds, as has already been remarked, occasionally lay their\r\neggs in the nests of other birds. This habit is not very uncommon with\r\nthe Gallinaceæ, and throws some light on the singular instinct of the\r\nostrich. In this family several hen birds unite and lay first a few\r\neggs in one nest and then in another; and these are hatched by the\r\nmales. This instinct may probably be accounted for by the fact of the\r\nhens laying a large number of eggs, but, as with the cuckoo, at\r\nintervals of two or three days. The instinct, however, of the American\r\nostrich, as in the case of the Molothrus bonariensis, has not as yet\r\nbeen perfected; for a surprising number of eggs lie strewed over the\r\nplains, so that in one day’s hunting I picked up no less than twenty\r\nlost and wasted eggs.\r\n\r\nMany bees are parasitic, and regularly lay their eggs in the nests of\r\nother kinds of bees. This case is more remarkable than that of the\r\ncuckoo; for these bees have not only had their instincts but their\r\nstructure modified in accordance with their parasitic habits; for they\r\ndo not possess the pollen-collecting apparatus which would have been\r\nindispensable if they had stored up food for their own young. Some\r\nspecies of Sphegidæ (wasp-like insects) are likewise parasitic; and M.\r\nFabre has lately shown good reason for believing that, although the\r\nTachytes nigra generally makes its own burrow and stores it with\r\nparalysed prey for its own larvæ, yet that, when this insect finds a\r\nburrow already made and stored by another sphex, it takes advantage of\r\nthe prize, and becomes for the occasion parasitic. In this case, as\r\nwith that of the Molothrus or cuckoo, I can see no difficulty in\r\nnatural selection making an occasional habit permanent, if of advantage\r\nto the species, and if the insect whose nest and stored food are\r\nfeloniously appropriated, be not thus exterminated.\r\n\r\n_Slave-making instinct._—This remarkable instinct was first discovered\r\nin the Formica (Polyerges) rufescens by Pierre Huber, a better observer\r\neven than his celebrated father. This ant is absolutely dependent on\r\nits slaves; without their aid, the species would certainly become\r\nextinct in a single year. The males and fertile females do no work of\r\nany kind, and the workers or sterile females, though most energetic and\r\ncourageous in capturing slaves, do no other work. They are incapable of\r\nmaking their own nests, or of feeding their own larvæ. When the old\r\nnest is found inconvenient, and they have to migrate, it is the slaves\r\nwhich determine the migration, and actually carry their masters in\r\ntheir jaws. So utterly helpless are the masters, that when Huber shut\r\nup thirty of them without a slave, but with plenty of the food which\r\nthey like best, and with their larvæ and pupæ to stimulate them to\r\nwork, they did nothing; they could not even feed themselves, and many\r\nperished of hunger. Huber then introduced a single slave (F. fusca),\r\nand she instantly set to work, fed and saved the survivors; made some\r\ncells and tended the larvæ, and put all to rights. What can be more\r\nextraordinary than these well-ascertained facts? If we had not known of\r\nany other slave-making ant, it would have been hopeless to speculate\r\nhow so wonderful an instinct could have been perfected.\r\n\r\nAnother species, Formica sanguinea, was likewise first discovered by P.\r\nHuber to be a slave-making ant. This species is found in the southern\r\nparts of England, and its habits have been attended to by Mr. F. Smith,\r\nof the British Museum, to whom I am much indebted for information on\r\nthis and other subjects. Although fully trusting to the statements of\r\nHuber and Mr. Smith, I tried to approach the subject in a sceptical\r\nframe of mind, as any one may well be excused for doubting the\r\nexistence of so extraordinary an instinct as that of making slaves.\r\nHence, I will give the observations which I made in some little detail.\r\nI opened fourteen nests of F. sanguinea, and found a few slaves in all.\r\nMales and fertile females of the slave-species (F. fusca) are found\r\nonly in their own proper communities, and have never been observed in\r\nthe nests of F. sanguinea. The slaves are black and not above half the\r\nsize of their red masters, so that the contrast in their appearance is\r\ngreat. When the nest is slightly disturbed, the slaves occasionally\r\ncome out, and like their masters are much agitated and defend the nest:\r\nwhen the nest is much disturbed, and the larvæ and pupæ are exposed,\r\nthe slaves work energetically together with their masters in carrying\r\nthem away to a place of safety. Hence, it is clear that the slaves feel\r\nquite at home. During the months of June and July, on three successive\r\nyears, I watched for many hours several nests in Surrey and Sussex, and\r\nnever saw a slave either leave or enter a nest. As, during these\r\nmonths, the slaves are very few in number, I thought that they might\r\nbehave differently when more numerous; but Mr. Smith informs me that he\r\nhas watched the nests at various hours during May, June and August,\r\nboth in Surrey and Hampshire, and has never seen the slaves, though\r\npresent in large numbers in August, either leave or enter the nest.\r\nHence, he considers them as strictly household slaves. The masters, on\r\nthe other hand, may be constantly seen bringing in materials for the\r\nnest, and food of all kinds. During the year 1860, however, in the\r\nmonth of July, I came across a community with an unusually large stock\r\nof slaves, and I observed a few slaves mingled with their masters\r\nleaving the nest, and marching along the same road to a tall Scotch-fir\r\ntree, twenty-five yards distant, which they ascended together, probably\r\nin search of aphides or cocci. According to Huber, who had ample\r\nopportunities for observation, the slaves in Switzerland habitually\r\nwork with their masters in making the nest, and they alone open and\r\nclose the doors in the morning and evening; and, as Huber expressly\r\nstates, their principal office is to search for aphides. This\r\ndifference in the usual habits of the masters and slaves in the two\r\ncountries, probably depends merely on the slaves being captured in\r\ngreater numbers in Switzerland than in England.\r\n\r\nOne day I fortunately witnessed a migration of F. sanguinea from one\r\nnest to another, and it was a most interesting spectacle to behold the\r\nmasters carefully carrying their slaves in their jaws instead of being\r\ncarried by them, as in the case of F. rufescens. Another day my\r\nattention was struck by about a score of the slave-makers haunting the\r\nsame spot, and evidently not in search of food; they approached and\r\nwere vigorously repulsed by an independent community of the slave\r\nspecies (F. fusca); sometimes as many as three of these ants clinging\r\nto the legs of the slave-making F. sanguinea. The latter ruthlessly\r\nkilled their small opponents and carried their dead bodies as food to\r\ntheir nest, twenty-nine yards distant; but they were prevented from\r\ngetting any pupæ to rear as slaves. I then dug up a small parcel of the\r\npupæ of F. fusca from another nest, and put them down on a bare spot\r\nnear the place of combat; they were eagerly seized and carried off by\r\nthe tyrants, who perhaps fancied that, after all, they had been\r\nvictorious in their late combat.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I laid on the same place a small parcel of the pupæ of\r\nanother species, F. flava, with a few of these little yellow ants still\r\nclinging to the fragments of their nest. This species is sometimes,\r\nthough rarely, made into slaves, as has been described by Mr. Smith.\r\nAlthough so small a species, it is very courageous, and I have seen it\r\nferociously attack other ants. In one instance I found to my surprise\r\nan independent community of F. flava under a stone beneath a nest of\r\nthe slave-making F. sanguinea; and when I had accidentally disturbed\r\nboth nests, the little ants attacked their big neighbours with\r\nsurprising courage. Now I was curious to ascertain whether F. sanguinea\r\ncould distinguish the pupæ of F. fusca, which they habitually make into\r\nslaves, from those of the little and furious F. flava, which they\r\nrarely capture, and it was evident that they did at once distinguish\r\nthem; for we have seen that they eagerly and instantly seized the pupæ\r\nof F. fusca, whereas they were much terrified when they came across the\r\npupæ, or even the earth from the nest, of F. flava, and quickly ran\r\naway; but in about a quarter of an hour, shortly after all the little\r\nyellow ants had crawled away, they took heart and carried off the pupæ.\r\n\r\nOne evening I visited another community of F. sanguinea, and found a\r\nnumber of these ants returning home and entering their nests, carrying\r\nthe dead bodies of F. fusca (showing that it was not a migration) and\r\nnumerous pupæ. I traced a long file of ants burthened with booty, for\r\nabout forty yards back, to a very thick clump of heath, whence I saw\r\nthe last individual of F. sanguinea emerge, carrying a pupa; but I was\r\nnot able to find the desolated nest in the thick heath. The nest,\r\nhowever, must have been close at hand, for two or three individuals of\r\nF. fusca were rushing about in the greatest agitation, and one was\r\nperched motionless with its own pupa in its mouth on the top of a spray\r\nof heath, an image of despair over its ravaged home.\r\n\r\nSuch are the facts, though they did not need confirmation by me, in\r\nregard to the wonderful instinct of making slaves. Let it be observed\r\nwhat a contrast the instinctive habits of F. sanguinea present with\r\nthose of the continental F. rufescens. The latter does not build its\r\nown nest, does not determine its own migrations, does not collect food\r\nfor itself or its young, and cannot even feed itself: it is absolutely\r\ndependent on its numerous slaves. Formica sanguinea, on the other hand,\r\npossesses much fewer slaves, and in the early part of the summer\r\nextremely few. The masters determine when and where a new nest shall be\r\nformed, and when they migrate, the masters carry the slaves. Both in\r\nSwitzerland and England the slaves seem to have the exclusive care of\r\nthe larvæ, and the masters alone go on slave-making expeditions. In\r\nSwitzerland the slaves and masters work together, making and bringing\r\nmaterials for the nest: both, but chiefly the slaves, tend and milk as\r\nit may be called, their aphides; and thus both collect food for the\r\ncommunity. In England the masters alone usually leave the nest to\r\ncollect building materials and food for themselves, their slaves and\r\nlarvæ. So that the masters in this country receive much less service\r\nfrom their slaves than they do in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nBy what steps the instinct of F. sanguinea originated I will not\r\npretend to conjecture. But as ants which are not slave-makers, will, as\r\nI have seen, carry off pupæ of other species, if scattered near their\r\nnests, it is possible that such pupæ originally stored as food might\r\nbecome developed; and the foreign ants thus unintentionally reared\r\nwould then follow their proper instincts, and do what work they could.\r\nIf their presence proved useful to the species which had seized them—if\r\nit were more advantageous to this species, to capture workers than to\r\nprocreate them—the habit of collecting pupæ, originally for food, might\r\nby natural selection be strengthened and rendered permanent for the\r\nvery different purpose of raising slaves. When the instinct was once\r\nacquired, if carried out to a much less extent even than in our British\r\nF. sanguinea, which, as we have seen, is less aided by its slaves than\r\nthe same species in Switzerland, natural selection might increase and\r\nmodify the instinct—always supposing each modification to be of use to\r\nthe species—until an ant was formed as abjectly dependent on its slaves\r\nas is the Formica rufescens.\r\n\r\n_Cell-making instinct of the Hive-Bee._—I will not here enter on minute\r\ndetails on this subject, but will merely give an outline of the\r\nconclusions at which I have arrived. He must be a dull man who can\r\nexamine the exquisite structure of a comb, so beautifully adapted to\r\nits end, without enthusiastic admiration. We hear from mathematicians\r\nthat bees have practically solved a recondite problem, and have made\r\ntheir cells of the proper shape to hold the greatest possible amount of\r\nhoney, with the least possible consumption of precious wax in their\r\nconstruction. It has been remarked that a skilful workman, with fitting\r\ntools and measures, would find it very difficult to make cells of wax\r\nof the true form, though this is effected by a crowd of bees working in\r\na dark hive. Granting whatever instincts you please, it seems at first\r\nquite inconceivable how they can make all the necessary angles and\r\nplanes, or even perceive when they are correctly made. But the\r\ndifficulty is not nearly so great as at first appears: all this\r\nbeautiful work can be shown, I think, to follow from a few simple\r\ninstincts.\r\n\r\nI was led to investigate this subject by Mr. Waterhouse, who has shown\r\nthat the form of the cell stands in close relation to the presence of\r\nadjoining cells; and the following view may, perhaps, be considered\r\nonly as a modification of his theory. Let us look to the great\r\nprinciple of gradation, and see whether Nature does not reveal to us\r\nher method of work. At one end of a short series we have humble-bees,\r\nwhich use their old cocoons to hold honey, sometimes adding to them\r\nshort tubes of wax, and likewise making separate and very irregular\r\nrounded cells of wax. At the other end of the series we have the cells\r\nof the hive-bee, placed in a double layer: each cell, as is well known,\r\nis an hexagonal prism, with the basal edges of its six sides bevelled\r\nso as to join an inverted pyramid, of three rhombs. These rhombs have\r\ncertain angles, and the three which form the pyramidal base of a single\r\ncell on one side of the comb, enter into the composition of the bases\r\nof three adjoining cells on the opposite side. In the series between\r\nthe extreme perfection of the cells of the hive-bee and the simplicity\r\nof those of the humble-bee, we have the cells of the Mexican Melipona\r\ndomestica, carefully described and figured by Pierre Huber. The\r\nMelipona itself is intermediate in structure between the hive and\r\nhumble bee, but more nearly related to the latter: it forms a nearly\r\nregular waxen comb of cylindrical cells, in which the young are\r\nhatched, and, in addition, some large cells of wax for holding honey.\r\nThese latter cells are nearly spherical and of nearly equal sizes, and\r\nare aggregated into an irregular mass. But the important point to\r\nnotice is, that these cells are always made at that degree of nearness\r\nto each other that they would have intersected or broken into each\r\nother if the spheres had been completed; but this is never permitted,\r\nthe bees building perfectly flat walls of wax between the spheres which\r\nthus tend to intersect. Hence, each cell consists of an outer spherical\r\nportion, and of two, three, or more flat surfaces, according as the\r\ncell adjoins two, three or more other cells. When one cell rests on\r\nthree other cells, which, from the spheres being nearly of the same\r\nsize, is very frequently and necessarily the case, the three flat\r\nsurfaces are united into a pyramid; and this pyramid, as Huber has\r\nremarked, is manifestly a gross imitation of the three-sided pyramidal\r\nbase of the cell of the hive-bee. As in the cells of the hive-bee, so\r\nhere, the three plane surfaces in any one cell necessarily enter into\r\nthe construction of three adjoining cells. It is obvious that the\r\nMelipona saves wax, and what is more important, labour, by this manner\r\nof building; for the flat walls between the adjoining cells are not\r\ndouble, but are of the same thickness as the outer spherical portions,\r\nand yet each flat portion forms a part of two cells.\r\n\r\nReflecting on this case, it occurred to me that if the Melipona had\r\nmade its spheres at some given distance from each other, and had made\r\nthem of equal sizes and had arranged them symmetrically in a double\r\nlayer, the resulting structure would have been as perfect as the comb\r\nof the hive-bee. Accordingly I wrote to Professor Miller, of Cambridge,\r\nand this geometer has kindly read over the following statement, drawn\r\nup from his information, and tells me that it is strictly correct:—\r\n\r\nIf a number of equal spheres be described with their centres placed in\r\ntwo parallel layers; with the centre of each sphere at the distance of\r\nradius x sqrt(2) or radius x 1.41421 (or at some lesser distance), from\r\nthe centres of the six surrounding spheres in the same layer; and at\r\nthe same distance from the centres of the adjoining spheres in the\r\nother and parallel layer; then, if planes of intersection between the\r\nseveral spheres in both layers be formed, there will result a double\r\nlayer of hexagonal prisms united together by pyramidal bases formed of\r\nthree rhombs; and the rhombs and the sides of the hexagonal prisms will\r\nhave every angle identically the same with the best measurements which\r\nhave been made of the cells of the hive-bee. But I hear from Professor\r\nWyman, who has made numerous careful measurements, that the accuracy of\r\nthe workmanship of the bee has been greatly exaggerated; so much so,\r\nthat whatever the typical form of the cell may be, it is rarely, if\r\never, realised.\r\n\r\nHence we may safely conclude that, if we could slightly modify the\r\ninstincts already possessed by the Melipona, and in themselves not very\r\nwonderful, this bee would make a structure as wonderfully perfect as\r\nthat of the hive-bee. We must suppose the Melipona to have the power of\r\nforming her cells truly spherical, and of equal sizes; and this would\r\nnot be very surprising, seeing that she already does so to a certain\r\nextent, and seeing what perfectly cylindrical burrows many insects make\r\nin wood, apparently by turning round on a fixed point. We must suppose\r\nthe Melipona to arrange her cells in level layers, as she already does\r\nher cylindrical cells; and we must further suppose, and this is the\r\ngreatest difficulty, that she can somehow judge accurately at what\r\ndistance to stand from her fellow-labourers when several are making\r\ntheir spheres; but she is already so far enabled to judge of distance,\r\nthat she always describes her spheres so as to intersect to a certain\r\nextent; and then she unites the points of intersection by perfectly\r\nflat surfaces. By such modifications of instincts which in themselves\r\nare not very wonderful—hardly more wonderful than those which guide a\r\nbird to make its nest—I believe that the hive-bee has acquired, through\r\nnatural selection, her inimitable architectural powers.\r\n\r\nBut this theory can be tested by experiment. Following the example of\r\nMr. Tegetmeier, I separated two combs, and put between them a long,\r\nthick, rectangular strip of wax: the bees instantly began to excavate\r\nminute circular pits in it; and as they deepened these little pits,\r\nthey made them wider and wider until they were converted into shallow\r\nbasins, appearing to the eye perfectly true or parts of a sphere, and\r\nof about the diameter of a cell. It was most interesting to observe\r\nthat, wherever several bees had begun to excavate these basins near\r\ntogether, they had begun their work at such a distance from each other\r\nthat by the time the basins had acquired the above stated width (_i.e._\r\nabout the width of an ordinary cell), and were in depth about one sixth\r\nof the diameter of the sphere of which they formed a part, the rims of\r\nthe basins intersected or broke into each other. As soon as this\r\noccurred, the bees ceased to excavate, and began to build up flat walls\r\nof wax on the lines of intersection between the basins, so that each\r\nhexagonal prism was built upon the scalloped edge of a smooth basin,\r\ninstead of on the straight edges of a three-sided pyramid as in the\r\ncase of ordinary cells.\r\n\r\nI then put into the hive, instead of a thick, rectangular piece of wax,\r\na thin and narrow, knife-edged ridge, coloured with vermilion. The bees\r\ninstantly began on both sides to excavate little basins near to each\r\nother, in the same way as before; but the ridge of wax was so thin,\r\nthat the bottoms of the basins, if they had been excavated to the same\r\ndepth as in the former experiment, would have broken into each other\r\nfrom the opposite sides. The bees, however, did not suffer this to\r\nhappen, and they stopped their excavations in due time; so that the\r\nbasins, as soon as they had been a little deepened, came to have flat\r\nbases; and these flat bases, formed by thin little plates of the\r\nvermilion wax left ungnawed, were situated, as far as the eye could\r\njudge, exactly along the planes of imaginary intersection between the\r\nbasins on the opposite side of the ridge of wax. In some parts, only\r\nsmall portions, in other parts, large portions of a rhombic plate were\r\nthus left between the opposed basins, but the work, from the unnatural\r\nstate of things, had not been neatly performed. The bees must have\r\nworked at very nearly the same rate in circularly gnawing away and\r\ndeepening the basins on both sides of the ridge of vermilion wax, in\r\norder to have thus succeeded in leaving flat plates between the basins,\r\nby stopping work at the planes of intersection.\r\n\r\nConsidering how flexible thin wax is, I do not see that there is any\r\ndifficulty in the bees, whilst at work on the two sides of a strip of\r\nwax, perceiving when they have gnawed the wax away to the proper\r\nthinness, and then stopping their work. In ordinary combs it has\r\nappeared to me that the bees do not always succeed in working at\r\nexactly the same rate from the opposite sides; for I have noticed\r\nhalf-completed rhombs at the base of a just-commenced cell, which were\r\nslightly concave on one side, where I suppose that the bees had\r\nexcavated too quickly, and convex on the opposed side where the bees\r\nhad worked less quickly. In one well-marked instance, I put the comb\r\nback into the hive, and allowed the bees to go on working for a short\r\ntime, and again examined the cell, and I found that the rhombic plate\r\nhad been completed, and had become _perfectly flat:_ it was absolutely\r\nimpossible, from the extreme thinness of the little plate, that they\r\ncould have effected this by gnawing away the convex side; and I suspect\r\nthat the bees in such cases stand in the opposed cells and push and\r\nbend the ductile and warm wax (which as I have tried is easily done)\r\ninto its proper intermediate plane, and thus flatten it.\r\n\r\nFrom the experiment of the ridge of vermilion wax we can see that, if\r\nthe bees were to build for themselves a thin wall of wax, they could\r\nmake their cells of the proper shape, by standing at the proper\r\ndistance from each other, by excavating at the same rate, and by\r\nendeavouring to make equal spherical hollows, but never allowing the\r\nspheres to break into each other. Now bees, as may be clearly seen by\r\nexamining the edge of a growing comb, do make a rough, circumferential\r\nwall or rim all round the comb; and they gnaw this away from the\r\nopposite sides, always working circularly as they deepen each cell.\r\nThey do not make the whole three-sided pyramidal base of any one cell\r\nat the same time, but only that one rhombic plate which stands on the\r\nextreme growing margin, or the two plates, as the case may be; and they\r\nnever complete the upper edges of the rhombic plates, until the\r\nhexagonal walls are commenced. Some of these statements differ from\r\nthose made by the justly celebrated elder Huber, but I am convinced of\r\ntheir accuracy; and if I had space, I could show that they are\r\nconformable with my theory.\r\n\r\nHuber’s statement, that the very first cell is excavated out of a\r\nlittle parallel-sided wall of wax, is not, as far as I have seen,\r\nstrictly correct; the first commencement having always been a little\r\nhood of wax; but I will not here enter on details. We see how important\r\na part excavation plays in the construction of the cells; but it would\r\nbe a great error to suppose that the bees cannot build up a rough wall\r\nof wax in the proper position—that is, along the plane of intersection\r\nbetween two adjoining spheres. I have several specimens showing clearly\r\nthat they can do this. Even in the rude circumferential rim or wall of\r\nwax round a growing comb, flexures may sometimes be observed,\r\ncorresponding in position to the planes of the rhombic basal plates of\r\nfuture cells. But the rough wall of wax has in every case to be\r\nfinished off, by being largely gnawed away on both sides. The manner in\r\nwhich the bees build is curious; they always make the first rough wall\r\nfrom ten to twenty times thicker than the excessively thin finished\r\nwall of the cell, which will ultimately be left. We shall understand\r\nhow they work, by supposing masons first to pile up a broad ridge of\r\ncement, and then to begin cutting it away equally on both sides near\r\nthe ground, till a smooth, very thin wall is left in the middle; the\r\nmasons always piling up the cut-away cement, and adding fresh cement on\r\nthe summit of the ridge. We shall thus have a thin wall steadily\r\ngrowing upward but always crowned by a gigantic coping. From all the\r\ncells, both those just commenced and those completed, being thus\r\ncrowned by a strong coping of wax, the bees can cluster and crawl over\r\nthe comb without injuring the delicate hexagonal walls. These walls, as\r\nProfessor Miller has kindly ascertained for me, vary greatly in\r\nthickness; being, on an average of twelve measurements made near the\r\nborder of the comb, 1/353 of an inch in thickness; whereas the basal\r\nrhomboidal plates are thicker, nearly in the proportion of three to\r\ntwo, having a mean thickness, from twenty-one measurements, of 1/229 of\r\nan inch. By the above singular manner of building, strength is\r\ncontinually given to the comb, with the utmost ultimate economy of wax.\r\n\r\nIt seems at first to add to the difficulty of understanding how the\r\ncells are made, that a multitude of bees all work together; one bee\r\nafter working a short time at one cell going to another, so that, as\r\nHuber has stated, a score of individuals work even at the commencement\r\nof the first cell. I was able practically to show this fact, by\r\ncovering the edges of the hexagonal walls of a single cell, or the\r\nextreme margin of the circumferential rim of a growing comb, with an\r\nextremely thin layer of melted vermilion wax; and I invariably found\r\nthat the colour was most delicately diffused by the bees—as delicately\r\nas a painter could have done it with his brush—by atoms of the coloured\r\nwax having been taken from the spot on which it had been placed, and\r\nworked into the growing edges of the cells all round. The work of\r\nconstruction seems to be a sort of balance struck between many bees,\r\nall instinctively standing at the same relative distance from each\r\nother, all trying to sweep equal spheres, and then building up, or\r\nleaving ungnawed, the planes of intersection between these spheres. It\r\nwas really curious to note in cases of difficulty, as when two pieces\r\nof comb met at an angle, how often the bees would pull down and rebuild\r\nin different ways the same cell, sometimes recurring to a shape which\r\nthey had at first rejected.\r\n\r\nWhen bees have a place on which they can stand in their proper\r\npositions for working—for instance, on a slip of wood, placed directly\r\nunder the middle of a comb growing downwards, so that the comb has to\r\nbe built over one face of the slip—in this case the bees can lay the\r\nfoundations of one wall of a new hexagon, in its strictly proper place,\r\nprojecting beyond the other completed cells. It suffices that the bees\r\nshould be enabled to stand at their proper relative distances from each\r\nother and from the walls of the last completed cells, and then, by\r\nstriking imaginary spheres, they can build up a wall intermediate\r\nbetween two adjoining spheres; but, as far as I have seen, they never\r\ngnaw away and finish off the angles of a cell till a large part both of\r\nthat cell and of the adjoining cells has been built. This capacity in\r\nbees of laying down under certain circumstances a rough wall in its\r\nproper place between two just-commenced cells, is important, as it\r\nbears on a fact, which seems at first subversive of the foregoing\r\ntheory; namely, that the cells on the extreme margin of wasp-combs are\r\nsometimes strictly hexagonal; but I have not space here to enter on\r\nthis subject. Nor does there seem to me any great difficulty in a\r\nsingle insect (as in the case of a queen-wasp) making hexagonal cells,\r\nif she were to work alternately on the inside and outside of two or\r\nthree cells commenced at the same time, always standing at the proper\r\nrelative distance from the parts of the cells just begun, sweeping\r\nspheres or cylinders, and building up intermediate planes.\r\n\r\nAs natural selection acts only by the accumulation of slight\r\nmodifications of structure or instinct, each profitable to the\r\nindividual under its conditions of life, it may reasonably be asked,\r\nhow a long and graduated succession of modified architectural\r\ninstincts, all tending towards the present perfect plan of\r\nconstruction, could have profited the progenitors of the hive-bee? I\r\nthink the answer is not difficult: cells constructed like those of the\r\nbee or the wasp gain in strength, and save much in labour and space,\r\nand in the materials of which they are constructed. With respect to the\r\nformation of wax, it is known that bees are often hard pressed to get\r\nsufficient nectar; and I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier that it has been\r\nexperimentally proved that from twelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar\r\nare consumed by a hive of bees for the secretion of a pound of wax; so\r\nthat a prodigious quantity of fluid nectar must be collected and\r\nconsumed by the bees in a hive for the secretion of the wax necessary\r\nfor the construction of their combs. Moreover, many bees have to remain\r\nidle for many days during the process of secretion. A large store of\r\nhoney is indispensable to support a large stock of bees during the\r\nwinter; and the security of the hive is known mainly to depend on a\r\nlarge number of bees being supported. Hence the saving of wax by\r\nlargely saving honey, and the time consumed in collecting the honey,\r\nmust be an important element of success any family of bees. Of course\r\nthe success of the species may be dependent on the number of its\r\nenemies, or parasites, or on quite distinct causes, and so be\r\naltogether independent of the quantity of honey which the bees can\r\ncollect. But let us suppose that this latter circumstance determined,\r\nas it probably often has determined, whether a bee allied to our\r\nhumble-bees could exist in large numbers in any country; and let us\r\nfurther suppose that the community lived through the winter, and\r\nconsequently required a store of honey: there can in this case be no\r\ndoubt that it would be an advantage to our imaginary humble-bee if a\r\nslight modification of her instincts led her to make her waxen cells\r\nnear together, so as to intersect a little; for a wall in common even\r\nto two adjoining cells would save some little labour and wax. Hence, it\r\nwould continually be more and more advantageous to our humble-bees, if\r\nthey were to make their cells more and more regular, nearer together,\r\nand aggregated into a mass, like the cells of the Melipona; for in this\r\ncase a large part of the bounding surface of each cell would serve to\r\nbound the adjoining cells, and much labour and wax would be saved.\r\nAgain, from the same cause, it would be advantageous to the Melipona,\r\nif she were to make her cells closer together, and more regular in\r\nevery way than at present; for then, as we have seen, the spherical\r\nsurfaces would wholly disappear and be replaced by plane surfaces; and\r\nthe Melipona would make a comb as perfect as that of the hive-bee.\r\nBeyond this stage of perfection in architecture, natural selection\r\ncould not lead; for the comb of the hive-bee, as far as we can see, is\r\nabsolutely perfect in economising labour and wax.\r\n\r\nThus, as I believe, the most wonderful of all known instincts, that of\r\nthe hive-bee, can be explained by natural selection having taken\r\nadvantage of numerous, successive, slight modifications of simpler\r\ninstincts; natural selection having, by slow degrees, more and more\r\nperfectly led the bees to sweep equal spheres at a given distance from\r\neach other in a double layer, and to build up and excavate the wax\r\nalong the planes of intersection. The bees, of course, no more knowing\r\nthat they swept their spheres at one particular distance from each\r\nother, than they know what are the several angles of the hexagonal\r\nprisms and of the basal rhombic plates; the motive power of the process\r\nof natural selection having been the construction of cells of due\r\nstrength and of the proper size and shape for the larvæ, this being\r\neffected with the greatest possible economy of labour and wax; that\r\nindividual swarm which thus made the best cells with least labour, and\r\nleast waste of honey in the secretion of wax, having succeeded best,\r\nand having transmitted their newly-acquired economical instincts to new\r\nswarms, which in their turn will have had the best chance of succeeding\r\nin the struggle for existence.\r\n\r\n_Objections to the Theory of Natural Selection as applied to Instincts:\r\nNeuter and Sterile Insects._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been objected to the foregoing view of the origin of instincts\r\nthat “the variations of structure and of instinct must have been\r\nsimultaneous and accurately adjusted to each other, as a modification\r\nin the one without an immediate corresponding change in the other would\r\nhave been fatal.” The force of this objection rests entirely on the\r\nassumption that the changes in the instincts and structure are abrupt.\r\nTo take as an illustration the case of the larger titmouse, (Parus\r\nmajor) alluded to in a previous chapter; this bird often holds the\r\nseeds of the yew between its feet on a branch, and hammers with its\r\nbeak till it gets at the kernel. Now what special difficulty would\r\nthere be in natural selection preserving all the slight individual\r\nvariations in the shape of the beak, which were better and better\r\nadapted to break open the seeds, until a beak was formed, as well\r\nconstructed for this purpose as that of the nuthatch, at the same time\r\nthat habit, or compulsion, or spontaneous variations of taste, led the\r\nbird to become more and more of a seed-eater? In this case the beak is\r\nsupposed to be slowly modified by natural selection, subsequently to,\r\nbut in accordance with, slowly changing habits or taste; but let the\r\nfeet of the titmouse vary and grow larger from correlation with the\r\nbeak, or from any other unknown cause, and it is not improbable that\r\nsuch larger feet would lead the bird to climb more and more until it\r\nacquired the remarkable climbing instinct and power of the nuthatch. In\r\nthis case a gradual change of structure is supposed to lead to changed\r\ninstinctive habits. To take one more case: few instincts are more\r\nremarkable than that which leads the swift of the Eastern Islands to\r\nmake its nest wholly of inspissated saliva. Some birds build their\r\nnests of mud, believed to be moistened with saliva; and one of the\r\nswifts of North America makes its nest (as I have seen) of sticks\r\nagglutinated with saliva, and even with flakes of this substance. Is it\r\nthen very improbable that the natural selection of individual swifts,\r\nwhich secreted more and more saliva, should at last produce a species\r\nwith instincts leading it to neglect other materials and to make its\r\nnest exclusively of inspissated saliva? And so in other cases. It must,\r\nhowever, be admitted that in many instances we cannot conjecture\r\nwhether it was instinct or structure which first varied.\r\n\r\nNo doubt many instincts of very difficult explanation could be opposed\r\nto the theory of natural selection—cases, in which we cannot see how an\r\ninstinct could have originated; cases, in which no intermediate\r\ngradations are known to exist; cases of instincts of such trifling\r\nimportance, that they could hardly have been acted on by natural\r\nselection; cases of instincts almost identically the same in animals so\r\nremote in the scale of nature that we cannot account for their\r\nsimilarity by inheritance from a common progenitor, and consequently\r\nmust believe that they were independently acquired through natural\r\nselection. I will not here enter on these several cases, but will\r\nconfine myself to one special difficulty, which at first appeared to me\r\ninsuperable, and actually fatal to the whole theory. I allude to the\r\nneuters or sterile females in insect communities: for these neuters\r\noften differ widely in instinct and in structure from both the males\r\nand fertile females, and yet, from being sterile, they cannot propagate\r\ntheir kind.\r\n\r\nThe subject well deserves to be discussed at great length, but I will\r\nhere take only a single case, that of working or sterile ants. How the\r\nworkers have been rendered sterile is a difficulty; but not much\r\ngreater than that of any other striking modification of structure; for\r\nit can be shown that some insects and other articulate animals in a\r\nstate of nature occasionally become sterile; and if such insects had\r\nbeen social, and it had been profitable to the community that a number\r\nshould have been annually born capable of work, but incapable of\r\nprocreation, I can see no especial difficulty in this having been\r\neffected through natural selection. But I must pass over this\r\npreliminary difficulty. The great difficulty lies in the working ants\r\ndiffering widely from both the males and the fertile females in\r\nstructure, as in the shape of the thorax, and in being destitute of\r\nwings and sometimes of eyes, and in instinct. As far as instinct alone\r\nis concerned, the wonderful difference in this respect between the\r\nworkers and the perfect females would have been better exemplified by\r\nthe hive-bee. If a working ant or other neuter insect had been an\r\nordinary animal, I should have unhesitatingly assumed that all its\r\ncharacters had been slowly acquired through natural selection; namely,\r\nby individuals having been born with slight profitable modifications,\r\nwhich were inherited by the offspring, and that these again varied and\r\nagain were selected, and so onwards. But with the working ant we have\r\nan insect differing greatly from its parents, yet absolutely sterile;\r\nso that it could never have transmitted successively acquired\r\nmodifications of structure or instinct to its progeny. It may well be\r\nasked how it is possible to reconcile this case with the theory of\r\nnatural selection?\r\n\r\nFirst, let it be remembered that we have innumerable instances, both in\r\nour domestic productions and in those in a state of nature, of all\r\nsorts of differences of inherited structure which are correlated with\r\ncertain ages and with either sex. We have differences correlated not\r\nonly with one sex, but with that short period when the reproductive\r\nsystem is active, as in the nuptial plumage of many birds, and in the\r\nhooked jaws of the male salmon. We have even slight differences in the\r\nhorns of different breeds of cattle in relation to an artificially\r\nimperfect state of the male sex; for oxen of certain breeds have longer\r\nhorns than the oxen of other breeds, relatively to the length of the\r\nhorns in both the bulls and cows of these same breeds. Hence, I can see\r\nno great difficulty in any character becoming correlated with the\r\nsterile condition of certain members of insect communities; the\r\ndifficulty lies in understanding how such correlated modifications of\r\nstructure could have been slowly accumulated by natural selection.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty, though appearing insuperable, is lessened, or, as I\r\nbelieve, disappears, when it is remembered that selection may be\r\napplied to the family, as well as to the individual, and may thus gain\r\nthe desired end. Breeders of cattle wish the flesh and fat to be well\r\nmarbled together. An animal thus characterized has been slaughtered,\r\nbut the breeder has gone with confidence to the same stock and has\r\nsucceeded. Such faith may be placed in the power of selection that a\r\nbreed of cattle, always yielding oxen with extraordinarily long horns,\r\ncould, it is probable, be formed by carefully watching which individual\r\nbulls and cows, when matched, produced oxen with the longest horns; and\r\nyet no one ox would ever have propagated its kind. Here is a better and\r\nreal illustration: According to M. Verlot, some varieties of the double\r\nannual stock, from having been long and carefully selected to the right\r\ndegree, always produce a large proportion of seedlings bearing double\r\nand quite sterile flowers, but they likewise yield some single and\r\nfertile plants. These latter, by which alone the variety can be\r\npropagated, may be compared with the fertile male and female ants, and\r\nthe double sterile plants with the neuters of the same community. As\r\nwith the varieties of the stock, so with social insects, selection has\r\nbeen applied to the family, and not to the individual, for the sake of\r\ngaining a serviceable end. Hence, we may conclude that slight\r\nmodifications of structure or of instinct, correlated with the sterile\r\ncondition of certain members of the community, have proved\r\nadvantageous; consequently the fertile males and females have\r\nflourished, and transmitted to their fertile offspring a tendency to\r\nproduce sterile members with the same modifications. This process must\r\nhave been repeated many times, until that prodigious amount of\r\ndifference between the fertile and sterile females of the same species\r\nhas been produced which we see in many social insects.\r\n\r\nBut we have not as yet touched on the acme of the difficulty; namely,\r\nthe fact that the neuters of several ants differ, not only from the\r\nfertile females and males, but from each other, sometimes to an almost\r\nincredible degree, and are thus divided into two or even three castes.\r\nThe castes, moreover, do not generally graduate into each other, but\r\nare perfectly well defined; being as distinct from each other as are\r\nany two species of the same genus, or rather as any two genera of the\r\nsame family. Thus, in Eciton, there are working and soldier neuters,\r\nwith jaws and instincts extraordinarily different: in Cryptocerus, the\r\nworkers of one caste alone carry a wonderful sort of shield on their\r\nheads, the use of which is quite unknown: in the Mexican Myrmecocystus,\r\nthe workers of one caste never leave the nest; they are fed by the\r\nworkers of another caste, and they have an enormously developed abdomen\r\nwhich secretes a sort of honey, supplying the place of that excreted by\r\nthe aphides, or the domestic cattle as they may be called, which our\r\nEuropean ants guard and imprison.\r\n\r\nIt will indeed be thought that I have an overweening confidence in the\r\nprinciple of natural selection, when I do not admit that such wonderful\r\nand well-established facts at once annihilate the theory. In the\r\nsimpler case of neuter insects all of one caste, which, as I believe,\r\nhave been rendered different from the fertile males and females through\r\nnatural selection, we may conclude from the analogy of ordinary\r\nvariations, that the successive, slight, profitable modifications did\r\nnot first arise in all the neuters in the same nest, but in some few\r\nalone; and that by the survival of the communities with females which\r\nproduced most neuters having the advantageous modification, all the\r\nneuters ultimately came to be thus characterized. According to this\r\nview we ought occasionally to find in the same nest neuter-insects,\r\npresenting gradations of structure; and this we do find, even not\r\nrarely, considering how few neuter-insects out of Europe have been\r\ncarefully examined. Mr. F. Smith has shown that the neuters of several\r\nBritish ants differ surprisingly from each other in size and sometimes\r\nin colour; and that the extreme forms can be linked together by\r\nindividuals taken out of the same nest: I have myself compared perfect\r\ngradations of this kind. It sometimes happens that the larger or the\r\nsmaller sized workers are the most numerous; or that both large and\r\nsmall are numerous, while those of an intermediate size are scanty in\r\nnumbers. Formica flava has larger and smaller workers, with some few of\r\nintermediate size; and, in this species, as Mr. F. Smith has observed,\r\nthe larger workers have simple eyes (ocelli), which, though small, can\r\nbe plainly distinguished, whereas the smaller workers have their ocelli\r\nrudimentary. Having carefully dissected several specimens of these\r\nworkers, I can affirm that the eyes are far more rudimentary in the\r\nsmaller workers than can be accounted for merely by their\r\nproportionately lesser size; and I fully believe, though I dare not\r\nassert so positively, that the workers of intermediate size have their\r\nocelli in an exactly intermediate condition. So that here we have two\r\nbodies of sterile workers in the same nest, differing not only in size,\r\nbut in their organs of vision, yet connected by some few members in an\r\nintermediate condition. I may digress by adding, that if the smaller\r\nworkers had been the most useful to the community, and those males and\r\nfemales had been continually selected, which produced more and more of\r\nthe smaller workers, until all the workers were in this condition; we\r\nshould then have had a species of ant with neuters in nearly the same\r\ncondition as those of Myrmica. For the workers of Myrmica have not even\r\nrudiments of ocelli, though the male and female ants of this genus have\r\nwell-developed ocelli.\r\n\r\nI may give one other case: so confidently did I expect occasionally to\r\nfind gradations of important structures between the different castes of\r\nneuters in the same species, that I gladly availed myself of Mr. F.\r\nSmith’s offer of numerous specimens from the same nest of the driver\r\nant (Anomma) of West Africa. The reader will perhaps best appreciate\r\nthe amount of difference in these workers by my giving, not the actual\r\nmeasurements, but a strictly accurate illustration: the difference was\r\nthe same as if we were to see a set of workmen building a house, of\r\nwhom many were five feet four inches high, and many sixteen feet high;\r\nbut we must in addition suppose that the larger workmen had heads four\r\ninstead of three times as big as those of the smaller men, and jaws\r\nnearly five times as big. The jaws, moreover, of the working ants of\r\nthe several sizes differed wonderfully in shape, and in the form and\r\nnumber of the teeth. But the important fact for us is that, though the\r\nworkers can be grouped into castes of different sizes, yet they\r\ngraduate insensibly into each other, as does the widely-different\r\nstructure of their jaws. I speak confidently on this latter point, as\r\nSir J. Lubbock made drawings for me, with the camera lucida, of the\r\njaws which I dissected from the workers of the several sizes. Mr.\r\nBates, in his interesting “Naturalist on the Amazons,” has described\r\nanalogous cases.\r\n\r\nWith these facts before me, I believe that natural selection, by acting\r\non the fertile ants or parents, could form a species which should\r\nregularly produce neuters, all of large size with one form of jaw, or\r\nall of small size with widely different jaws; or lastly, and this is\r\nthe greatest difficulty, one set of workers of one size and structure,\r\nand simultaneously another set of workers of a different size and\r\nstructure; a graduated series having first been formed, as in the case\r\nof the driver ant, and then the extreme forms having been produced in\r\ngreater and greater numbers, through the survival of the parents which\r\ngenerated them, until none with an intermediate structure were\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nAn analogous explanation has been given by Mr. Wallace, of the equally\r\ncomplex case, of certain Malayan butterflies regularly appearing under\r\ntwo or even three distinct female forms; and by Fritz Müller, of\r\ncertain Brazilian crustaceans likewise appearing under two widely\r\ndistinct male forms. But this subject need not here be discussed.\r\n\r\nI have now explained how, I believe, the wonderful fact of two\r\ndistinctly defined castes of sterile workers existing in the same nest,\r\nboth widely different from each other and from their parents, has\r\noriginated. We can see how useful their production may have been to a\r\nsocial community of ants, on the same principle that the division of\r\nlabour is useful to civilised man. Ants, however, work by inherited\r\ninstincts and by inherited organs or tools, while man works by acquired\r\nknowledge and manufactured instruments. But I must confess, that, with\r\nall my faith in natural selection, I should never have anticipated that\r\nthis principle could have been efficient in so high a degree, had not\r\nthe case of these neuter insects led me to this conclusion. I have,\r\ntherefore, discussed this case, at some little but wholly insufficient\r\nlength, in order to show the power of natural selection, and likewise\r\nbecause this is by far the most serious special difficulty which my\r\ntheory has encountered. The case, also, is very interesting, as it\r\nproves that with animals, as with plants, any amount of modification\r\nmay be effected by the accumulation of numerous, slight, spontaneous\r\nvariations, which are in any way profitable, without exercise or habit\r\nhaving been brought into play. For peculiar habits, confined to the\r\nworkers of sterile females, however long they might be followed, could\r\nnot possibly affect the males and fertile females, which alone leave\r\ndescendants. I am surprised that no one has advanced this demonstrative\r\ncase of neuter insects, against the well-known doctrine of inherited\r\nhabit, as advanced by Lamarck.\r\n\r\n_Summary._\r\n\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured in this chapter briefly to show that the mental\r\nqualities of our domestic animals vary, and that the variations are\r\ninherited. Still more briefly I have attempted to show that instincts\r\nvary slightly in a state of nature. No one will dispute that instincts\r\nare of the highest importance to each animal. Therefore, there is no\r\nreal difficulty, under changing conditions of life, in natural\r\nselection accumulating to any extent slight modifications of instinct\r\nwhich are in any way useful. In many cases habit or use and disuse have\r\nprobably come into play. I do not pretend that the facts given in this\r\nchapter strengthen in any great degree my theory; but none of the cases\r\nof difficulty, to the best of my judgment, annihilate it. On the other\r\nhand, the fact that instincts are not always absolutely perfect and are\r\nliable to mistakes;—that no instinct can be shown to have been produced\r\nfor the good of other animals, though animals take advantage of the\r\ninstincts of others;—that the canon in natural history, of “Natura non\r\nfacit saltum,” is applicable to instincts as well as to corporeal\r\nstructure, and is plainly explicable on the foregoing views, but is\r\notherwise inexplicable—all tend to corroborate the theory of natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nThis theory is also strengthened by some few other facts in regard to\r\ninstincts; as by that common case of closely allied, but distinct,\r\nspecies, when inhabiting distant parts of the world and living under\r\nconsiderably different conditions of life, yet often retaining nearly\r\nthe same instincts. For instance, we can understand, on the principle\r\nof inheritance, how it is that the thrush of tropical South America\r\nlines its nest with mud, in the same peculiar manner as does our\r\nBritish thrush; how it is that the Hornbills of Africa and India have\r\nthe same extraordinary instinct of plastering up and imprisoning the\r\nfemales in a hole in a tree, with only a small hole left in the plaster\r\nthrough which the males feed them and their young when hatched; how it\r\nis that the male wrens (Troglodytes) of North America, build\r\n“cock-nests,” to roost in, like the males of our Kitty-wrens,—a habit\r\nwholly unlike that of any other known bird. Finally, it may not be a\r\nlogical deduction, but to my imagination it is far more satisfactory to\r\nlook at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its\r\nfoster-brothers, ants making slaves, the larvæ of ichneumonidæ feeding\r\nwithin the live bodies of caterpillars, not as specially endowed or\r\ncreated instincts, but as small consequences of one general law leading\r\nto the advancement of all organic beings—namely, multiply, vary, let\r\nthe strongest live and the weakest die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nHYBRIDISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nDistinction between the sterility of first crosses and of\r\nhybrids—Sterility various in degree, not universal, affected by close\r\ninterbreeding, removed by domestication—Laws governing the sterility of\r\nhybrids—Sterility not a special endowment, but incidental on other\r\ndifferences, not accumulated by natural selection—Causes of the\r\nsterility of first crosses and of hybrids—Parallelism between the\r\neffects of changed conditions of life and of crossing—Dimorphism and\r\ntrimorphism—Fertility of varieties when crossed and of their mongrel\r\noffspring not universal—Hybrids and mongrels compared independently of\r\ntheir fertility—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe view commonly entertained by naturalists is that species, when\r\nintercrossed, have been specially endowed with sterility, in order to\r\nprevent their confusion. This view certainly seems at first highly\r\nprobable, for species living together could hardly have been kept\r\ndistinct had they been capable of freely crossing. The subject is in\r\nmany ways important for us, more especially as the sterility of species\r\nwhen first crossed, and that of their hybrid offspring, cannot have\r\nbeen acquired, as I shall show, by the preservation of successive\r\nprofitable degrees of sterility. It is an incidental result of\r\ndifferences in the reproductive systems of the parent-species.\r\n\r\nIn treating this subject, two classes of facts, to a large extent\r\nfundamentally different, have generally been confounded; namely, the\r\nsterility of species when first crossed, and the sterility of the\r\nhybrids produced from them.\r\n\r\nPure species have of course their organs of reproduction in a perfect\r\ncondition, yet when intercrossed they produce either few or no\r\noffspring. Hybrids, on the other hand, have their reproductive organs\r\nfunctionally impotent, as may be clearly seen in the state of the male\r\nelement in both plants and animals; though the formative organs\r\nthemselves are perfect in structure, as far as the microscope reveals.\r\nIn the first case the two sexual elements which go to form the embryo\r\nare perfect; in the second case they are either not at all developed,\r\nor are imperfectly developed. This distinction is important, when the\r\ncause of the sterility, which is common to the two cases, has to be\r\nconsidered. The distinction probably has been slurred over, owing to\r\nthe sterility in both cases being looked on as a special endowment,\r\nbeyond the province of our reasoning powers.\r\n\r\nThe fertility of varieties, that is of the forms known or believed to\r\nbe descended from common parents, when crossed, and likewise the\r\nfertility of their mongrel offspring, is, with reference to my theory,\r\nof equal importance with the sterility of species; for it seems to make\r\na broad and clear distinction between varieties and species.\r\n\r\n_Degrees of Sterility._—First, for the sterility of species when\r\ncrossed and of their hybrid offspring. It is impossible to study the\r\nseveral memoirs and works of those two conscientious and admirable\r\nobservers, Kölreuter and Gärtner, who almost devoted their lives to\r\nthis subject, without being deeply impressed with the high generality\r\nof some degree of sterility. Kölreuter makes the rule universal; but\r\nthen he cuts the knot, for in ten cases in which he found two forms,\r\nconsidered by most authors as distinct species, quite fertile together,\r\nhe unhesitatingly ranks them as varieties. Gärtner, also, makes the\r\nrule equally universal; and he disputes the entire fertility of\r\nKölreuter’s ten cases. But in these and in many other cases, Gärtner is\r\nobliged carefully to count the seeds, in order to show that there is\r\nany degree of sterility. He always compares the maximum number of seeds\r\nproduced by two species when first crossed, and the maximum produced by\r\ntheir hybrid offspring, with the average number produced by both pure\r\nparent-species in a state of nature. But causes of serious error here\r\nintervene: a plant, to be hybridised, must be castrated, and, what is\r\noften more important, must be secluded in order to prevent pollen being\r\nbrought to it by insects from other plants. Nearly all the plants\r\nexperimented on by Gärtner were potted, and were kept in a chamber in\r\nhis house. That these processes are often injurious to the fertility of\r\na plant cannot be doubted; for Gärtner gives in his table about a score\r\nof cases of plants which he castrated, and artificially fertilised with\r\ntheir own pollen, and (excluding all cases such as the Leguminosæ, in\r\nwhich there is an acknowledged difficulty in the manipulation) half of\r\nthese twenty plants had their fertility in some degree impaired.\r\nMoreover, as Gärtner repeatedly crossed some forms, such as the common\r\nred and blue pimpernels (Anagallis arvensis and coerulea), which the\r\nbest botanists rank as varieties, and found them absolutely sterile, we\r\nmay doubt whether many species are really so sterile, when\r\nintercrossed, as he believed.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, on the one hand, that the sterility of various species\r\nwhen crossed is so different in degree and graduates away so\r\ninsensibly, and, on the other hand, that the fertility of pure species\r\nis so easily affected by various circumstances, that for all practical\r\npurposes it is most difficult to say where perfect fertility ends and\r\nsterility begins. I think no better evidence of this can be required\r\nthan that the two most experienced observers who have ever lived,\r\nnamely Kölreuter and Gärtner, arrived at diametrically opposite\r\nconclusions in regard to some of the very same forms. It is also most\r\ninstructive to compare—but I have not space here to enter on\r\ndetails—the evidence advanced by our best botanists on the question\r\nwhether certain doubtful forms should be ranked as species or\r\nvarieties, with the evidence from fertility adduced by different\r\nhybridisers, or by the same observer from experiments made during\r\ndifferent years. It can thus be shown that neither sterility nor\r\nfertility affords any certain distinction between species and\r\nvarieties. The evidence from this source graduates away, and is\r\ndoubtful in the same degree as is the evidence derived from other\r\nconstitutional and structural differences.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations; though\r\nGärtner was enabled to rear some hybrids, carefully guarding them from\r\na cross with either pure parent, for six or seven, and in one case for\r\nten generations, yet he asserts positively that their fertility never\r\nincreases, but generally decreases greatly and suddenly. With respect\r\nto this decrease, it may first be noticed that when any deviation in\r\nstructure or constitution is common to both parents, this is often\r\ntransmitted in an augmented degree to the offspring; and both sexual\r\nelements in hybrid plants are already affected in some degree. But I\r\nbelieve that their fertility has been diminished in nearly all these\r\ncases by an independent cause, namely, by too close interbreeding. I\r\nhave made so many experiments and collected so many facts, showing on\r\nthe one hand that an occasional cross with a distinct individual or\r\nvariety increases the vigour and fertility of the offspring, and on the\r\nother hand that very close interbreeding lessens their vigour and\r\nfertility, that I cannot doubt the correctness of this conclusion.\r\nHybrids are seldom raised by experimentalists in great numbers; and as\r\nthe parent-species, or other allied hybrids, generally grow in the same\r\ngarden, the visits of insects must be carefully prevented during the\r\nflowering season: hence hybrids, if left to themselves, will generally\r\nbe fertilised during each generation by pollen from the same flower;\r\nand this would probably be injurious to their fertility, already\r\nlessened by their hybrid origin. I am strengthened in this conviction\r\nby a remarkable statement repeatedly made by Gärtner, namely, that if\r\neven the less fertile hybrids be artificially fertilised with hybrid\r\npollen of the same kind, their fertility, notwithstanding the frequent\r\nill effects from manipulation, sometimes decidedly increases, and goes\r\non increasing. Now, in the process of artificial fertilisation, pollen\r\nis as often taken by chance (as I know from my own experience) from the\r\nanthers of another flower, as from the anthers of the flower itself\r\nwhich is to be fertilised; so that a cross between two flowers, though\r\nprobably often on the same plant, would be thus effected. Moreover,\r\nwhenever complicated experiments are in progress, so careful an\r\nobserver as Gärtner would have castrated his hybrids, and this would\r\nhave insured in each generation a cross with pollen from a distinct\r\nflower, either from the same plant or from another plant of the same\r\nhybrid nature. And thus, the strange fact of an increase of fertility\r\nin the successive generations of _artificially fertilised_ hybrids, in\r\ncontrast with those spontaneously self-fertilised, may, as I believe,\r\nbe accounted for by too close interbreeding having been avoided.\r\n\r\nNow let us turn to the results arrived at by a third most experienced\r\nhybridiser, namely, the Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert. He is as emphatic in\r\nhis conclusion that some hybrids are perfectly fertile—as fertile as\r\nthe pure parent-species—as are Kölreuter and Gärtner that some degree\r\nof sterility between distinct species is a universal law of nature. He\r\nexperimented on some of the very same species as did Gärtner. The\r\ndifference in their results may, I think, be in part accounted for by\r\nHerbert’s great horticultural skill, and by his having hot-houses at\r\nhis command. Of his many important statements I will here give only a\r\nsingle one as an example, namely, that “every ovule in a pod of Crinum\r\ncapense fertilised by C. revolutum produced a plant, which I never saw\r\nto occur in a case of its natural fecundation.” So that here we have\r\nperfect, or even more than commonly perfect fertility, in a first cross\r\nbetween two distinct species.\r\n\r\nThis case of the Crinum leads me to refer to a singular fact, namely,\r\nthat individual plants of certain species of Lobelia, Verbascum and\r\nPassiflora, can easily be fertilised by the pollen from a distinct\r\nspecies, but not by pollen from the same plant, though this pollen can\r\nbe proved to be perfectly sound by fertilising other plants or species.\r\nIn the genus Hippeastrum, in Corydalis as shown by Professor\r\nHildebrand, in various orchids as shown by Mr. Scott and Fritz Müller,\r\nall the individuals are in this peculiar condition. So that with some\r\nspecies, certain abnormal individuals, and in other species all the\r\nindividuals, can actually be hybridised much more readily than they can\r\nbe fertilised by pollen from the same individual plant! To give one\r\ninstance, a bulb of Hippeastrum aulicum produced four flowers; three\r\nwere fertilised by Herbert with their own pollen, and the fourth was\r\nsubsequently fertilised by the pollen of a compound hybrid descended\r\nfrom three distinct species: the result was that “the ovaries of the\r\nthree first flowers soon ceased to grow, and after a few days perished\r\nentirely, whereas the pod impregnated by the pollen of the hybrid made\r\nvigorous growth and rapid progress to maturity, and bore good seed,\r\nwhich vegetated freely.” Mr. Herbert tried similar experiments during\r\nmany years, and always with the same result. These cases serve to show\r\non what slight and mysterious causes the lesser or greater fertility of\r\na species sometimes depends.\r\n\r\nThe practical experiments of horticulturists, though not made with\r\nscientific precision, deserve some notice. It is notorious in how\r\ncomplicated a manner the species of Pelargonium, Fuchsia, Calceolaria,\r\nPetunia, Rhododendron, &c., have been crossed, yet many of these\r\nhybrids seed freely. For instance, Herbert asserts that a hybrid from\r\nCalceolaria integrifolia and plantaginea, species most widely\r\ndissimilar in general habit, “reproduces itself as perfectly as if it\r\nhad been a natural species from the mountains of Chile.” I have taken\r\nsome pains to ascertain the degree of fertility of some of the complex\r\ncrosses of Rhododendrons, and I am assured that many of them are\r\nperfectly fertile. Mr. C. Noble, for instance, informs me that he\r\nraises stocks for grafting from a hybrid between Rhod. ponticum and\r\ncatawbiense, and that this hybrid “seeds as freely as it is possible to\r\nimagine.” Had hybrids, when fairly treated, always gone on decreasing\r\nin fertility in each successive generation, as Gärtner believed to be\r\nthe case, the fact would have been notorious to nurserymen.\r\nHorticulturists raise large beds of the same hybrid, and such alone are\r\nfairly treated, for by insect agency the several individuals are\r\nallowed to cross freely with each other, and the injurious influence of\r\nclose interbreeding is thus prevented. Any one may readily convince\r\nhimself of the efficiency of insect agency by examining the flowers of\r\nthe more sterile kinds of hybrid Rhododendrons, which produce no\r\npollen, for he will find on their stigmas plenty of pollen brought from\r\nother flowers.\r\n\r\nIn regard to animals, much fewer experiments have been carefully tried\r\nthan with plants. If our systematic arrangements can be trusted, that\r\nis, if the genera of animals are as distinct from each other as are the\r\ngenera of plants, then we may infer that animals more widely distinct\r\nin the scale of nature can be crossed more easily than in the case of\r\nplants; but the hybrids themselves are, I think, more sterile. It\r\nshould, however, be borne in mind that, owing to few animals breeding\r\nfreely under confinement, few experiments have been fairly tried: for\r\ninstance, the canary-bird has been crossed with nine distinct species\r\nof finches, but, as not one of these breeds freely in confinement, we\r\nhave no right to expect that the first crosses between them and the\r\ncanary, or that their hybrids, should be perfectly fertile. Again, with\r\nrespect to the fertility in successive generations of the more fertile\r\nhybrid animals, I hardly know of an instance in which two families of\r\nthe same hybrid have been raised at the same time from different\r\nparents, so as to avoid the ill effects of close interbreeding. On the\r\ncontrary, brothers and sisters have usually been crossed in each\r\nsuccessive generation, in opposition to the constantly repeated\r\nadmonition of every breeder. And in this case, it is not at all\r\nsurprising that the inherent sterility in the hybrids should have gone\r\non increasing.\r\n\r\nAlthough I know of hardly any thoroughly well-authenticated cases of\r\nperfectly fertile hybrid animals, I have reason to believe that the\r\nhybrids from Cervulus vaginalis and Reevesii, and from Phasianus\r\ncolchicus with P. torquatus, are perfectly fertile. M. Quatrefages\r\nstates that the hybrids from two moths (Bombyx cynthia and arrindia)\r\nwere proved in Paris to be fertile _inter se_ for eight generations. It\r\nhas lately been asserted that two such distinct species as the hare and\r\nrabbit, when they can be got to breed together, produce offspring,\r\nwhich are highly fertile when crossed with one of the parent-species.\r\nThe hybrids from the common and Chinese geese (A. cygnoides), species\r\nwhich are so different that they are generally ranked in distinct\r\ngenera, have often bred in this country with either pure parent, and in\r\none single instance they have bred _inter se_. This was effected by Mr.\r\nEyton, who raised two hybrids from the same parents, but from different\r\nhatches; and from these two birds he raised no less than eight hybrids\r\n(grandchildren of the pure geese) from one nest. In India, however,\r\nthese cross-bred geese must be far more fertile; for I am assured by\r\ntwo eminently capable judges, namely Mr. Blyth and Captain Hutton, that\r\nwhole flocks of these crossed geese are kept in various parts of the\r\ncountry; and as they are kept for profit, where neither pure\r\nparent-species exists, they must certainly be highly or perfectly\r\nfertile.\r\n\r\nWith our domesticated animals, the various races when crossed together\r\nare quite fertile; yet in many cases they are descended from two or\r\nmore wild species. From this fact we must conclude either that the\r\naboriginal parent-species at first produced perfectly fertile hybrids,\r\nor that the hybrids subsequently reared under domestication became\r\nquite fertile. This latter alternative, which was first propounded by\r\nPallas, seems by far the most probable, and can, indeed, hardly be\r\ndoubted. It is, for instance, almost certain that our dogs are\r\ndescended from several wild stocks; yet, with perhaps the exception of\r\ncertain indigenous domestic dogs of South America, all are quite\r\nfertile together; but analogy makes me greatly doubt, whether the\r\nseveral aboriginal species would at first have freely bred together and\r\nhave produced quite fertile hybrids. So again I have lately acquired\r\ndecisive evidence that the crossed offspring from the Indian humped and\r\ncommon cattle are inter se perfectly fertile; and from the observations\r\nby Rütimeyer on their important osteological differences, as well as\r\nfrom those by Mr. Blyth on their differences in habits, voice,\r\nconstitution, &c., these two forms must be regarded as good and\r\ndistinct species. The same remarks may be extended to the two chief\r\nraces of the pig. We must, therefore, either give up the belief of the\r\nuniversal sterility of species when crossed; or we must look at this\r\nsterility in animals, not as an indelible characteristic, but as one\r\ncapable of being removed by domestication.\r\n\r\nFinally, considering all the ascertained facts on the intercrossing of\r\nplants and animals, it may be concluded that some degree of sterility,\r\nboth in first crosses and in hybrids, is an extremely general result;\r\nbut that it cannot, under our present state of knowledge, be considered\r\nas absolutely universal.\r\n\r\n_Laws governing the Sterility of first Crosses and of Hybrids._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now consider a little more in detail the laws governing the\r\nsterility of first crosses and of hybrids. Our chief object will be to\r\nsee whether or not these laws indicate that species have been specially\r\nendowed with this quality, in order to prevent their crossing and\r\nblending together in utter confusion. The following conclusions are\r\ndrawn up chiefly from Gärtner’s admirable work on the hybridisation of\r\nplants. I have taken much pains to ascertain how far they apply to\r\nanimals, and, considering how scanty our knowledge is in regard to\r\nhybrid animals, I have been surprised to find how generally the same\r\nrules apply to both kingdoms.\r\n\r\nIt has been already remarked, that the degree of fertility, both of\r\nfirst crosses and of hybrids, graduates from zero to perfect fertility.\r\nIt is surprising in how many curious ways this gradation can be shown;\r\nbut only the barest outline of the facts can here be given. When pollen\r\nfrom a plant of one family is placed on the stigma of a plant of a\r\ndistinct family, it exerts no more influence than so much inorganic\r\ndust. From this absolute zero of fertility, the pollen of different\r\nspecies applied to the stigma of some one species of the same genus,\r\nyields a perfect gradation in the number of seeds produced, up to\r\nnearly complete or even quite complete fertility; and, as we have seen,\r\nin certain abnormal cases, even to an excess of fertility, beyond that\r\nwhich the plant’s own pollen produces. So in hybrids themselves, there\r\nare some which never have produced, and probably never would produce,\r\neven with the pollen of the pure parents, a single fertile seed: but in\r\nsome of these cases a first trace of fertility may be detected, by the\r\npollen of one of the pure parent-species causing the flower of the\r\nhybrid to wither earlier than it otherwise would have done; and the\r\nearly withering of the flower is well known to be a sign of incipient\r\nfertilisation. From this extreme degree of sterility we have\r\nself-fertilised hybrids producing a greater and greater number of seeds\r\nup to perfect fertility.\r\n\r\nThe hybrids raised from two species which are very difficult to cross,\r\nand which rarely produce any offspring, are generally very sterile; but\r\nthe parallelism between the difficulty of making a first cross, and the\r\nsterility of the hybrids thus produced—two classes of facts which are\r\ngenerally confounded together—is by no means strict. There are many\r\ncases, in which two pure species, as in the genus Verbascum, can be\r\nunited with unusual facility, and produce numerous hybrid offspring,\r\nyet these hybrids are remarkably sterile. On the other hand, there are\r\nspecies which can be crossed very rarely, or with extreme difficulty,\r\nbut the hybrids, when at last produced, are very fertile. Even within\r\nthe limits of the same genus, for instance in Dianthus, these two\r\nopposite cases occur.\r\n\r\nThe fertility, both of first crosses and of hybrids, is more easily\r\naffected by unfavourable conditions, than is that of pure species. But\r\nthe fertility of first crosses is likewise innately variable; for it is\r\nnot always the same in degree when the same two species are crossed\r\nunder the same circumstances; it depends in part upon the constitution\r\nof the individuals which happen to have been chosen for the experiment.\r\nSo it is with hybrids, for their degree of fertility is often found to\r\ndiffer greatly in the several individuals raised from seed out of the\r\nsame capsule and exposed to the same conditions.\r\n\r\nBy the term systematic affinity is meant, the general resemblance\r\nbetween species in structure and constitution. Now the fertility of\r\nfirst crosses, and of the hybrids produced from them, is largely\r\ngoverned by their systematic affinity. This is clearly shown by hybrids\r\nnever having been raised between species ranked by systematists in\r\ndistinct families; and on the other hand, by very closely allied\r\nspecies generally uniting with facility. But the correspondence between\r\nsystematic affinity and the facility of crossing is by no means strict.\r\nA multitude of cases could be given of very closely allied species\r\nwhich will not unite, or only with extreme difficulty; and on the other\r\nhand of very distinct species which unite with the utmost facility. In\r\nthe same family there may be a genus, as Dianthus, in which very many\r\nspecies can most readily be crossed; and another genus, as Silene, in\r\nwhich the most persevering efforts have failed to produce between\r\nextremely close species a single hybrid. Even within the limits of the\r\nsame genus, we meet with this same difference; for instance, the many\r\nspecies of Nicotiana have been more largely crossed than the species of\r\nalmost any other genus; but Gärtner found that N. acuminata, which is\r\nnot a particularly distinct species, obstinately failed to fertilise,\r\nor to be fertilised, by no less than eight other species of Nicotiana.\r\nMany analogous facts could be given.\r\n\r\nNo one has been able to point out what kind or what amount of\r\ndifference, in any recognisable character, is sufficient to prevent two\r\nspecies crossing. It can be shown that plants most widely different in\r\nhabit and general appearance, and having strongly marked differences in\r\nevery part of the flower, even in the pollen, in the fruit, and in the\r\ncotyledons, can be crossed. Annual and perennial plants, deciduous and\r\nevergreen trees, plants inhabiting different stations and fitted for\r\nextremely different climates, can often be crossed with ease.\r\n\r\nBy a reciprocal cross between two species, I mean the case, for\r\ninstance, of a female-ass being first crossed by a stallion, and then a\r\nmare by a male-ass: these two species may then be said to have been\r\nreciprocally crossed. There is often the widest possible difference in\r\nthe facility of making reciprocal crosses. Such cases are highly\r\nimportant, for they prove that the capacity in any two species to cross\r\nis often completely independent of their systematic affinity, that is\r\nof any difference in their structure or constitution, excepting in\r\ntheir reproductive systems. The diversity of the result in reciprocal\r\ncrosses between the same two species was long ago observed by\r\nKölreuter. To give an instance: Mirabilis jalapa can easily be\r\nfertilised by the pollen of M. longiflora, and the hybrids thus\r\nproduced are sufficiently fertile; but Kölreuter tried more than two\r\nhundred times, during eight following years, to fertilise reciprocally\r\nM. longiflora with the pollen of M. jalapa, and utterly failed. Several\r\nother equally striking cases could be given. Thuret has observed the\r\nsame fact with certain sea-weeds or Fuci. Gärtner, moreover, found that\r\nthis difference of facility in making reciprocal crosses is extremely\r\ncommon in a lesser degree. He has observed it even between closely\r\nrelated forms (as Matthiola annua and glabra) which many botanists rank\r\nonly as varieties. It is also a remarkable fact that hybrids raised\r\nfrom reciprocal crosses, though of course compounded of the very same\r\ntwo species, the one species having first been used as the father and\r\nthen as the mother, though they rarely differ in external characters,\r\nyet generally differ in fertility in a small, and occasionally in a\r\nhigh degree.\r\n\r\nSeveral other singular rules could be given from Gärtner: for instance,\r\nsome species have a remarkable power of crossing with other species;\r\nother species of the same genus have a remarkable power of impressing\r\ntheir likeness on their hybrid offspring; but these two powers do not\r\nat all necessarily go together. There are certain hybrids which,\r\ninstead of having, as is usual, an intermediate character between their\r\ntwo parents, always closely resemble one of them; and such hybrids,\r\nthough externally so like one of their pure parent-species, are with\r\nrare exceptions extremely sterile. So again among hybrids which are\r\nusually intermediate in structure between their parents, exceptional\r\nand abnormal individuals sometimes are born, which closely resemble one\r\nof their pure parents; and these hybrids are almost always utterly\r\nsterile, even when the other hybrids raised from seed from the same\r\ncapsule have a considerable degree of fertility. These facts show how\r\ncompletely the fertility of a hybrid may be independent of its external\r\nresemblance to either pure parent.\r\n\r\nConsidering the several rules now given, which govern the fertility of\r\nfirst crosses and of hybrids, we see that when forms, which must be\r\nconsidered as good and distinct species, are united, their fertility\r\ngraduates from zero to perfect fertility, or even to fertility under\r\ncertain conditions in excess; that their fertility, besides being\r\neminently susceptible to favourable and unfavourable conditions, is\r\ninnately variable; that it is by no means always the same in degree in\r\nthe first cross and in the hybrids produced from this cross; that the\r\nfertility of hybrids is not related to the degree in which they\r\nresemble in external appearance either parent; and lastly, that the\r\nfacility of making a first cross between any two species is not always\r\ngoverned by their systematic affinity or degree of resemblance to each\r\nother. This latter statement is clearly proved by the difference in the\r\nresult of reciprocal crosses between the same two species, for,\r\naccording as the one species or the other is used as the father or the\r\nmother, there is generally some difference, and occasionally the widest\r\npossible difference, in the facility of effecting an union. The\r\nhybrids, moreover, produced from reciprocal crosses often differ in\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\nNow do these complex and singular rules indicate that species have been\r\nendowed with sterility simply to prevent their becoming confounded in\r\nnature? I think not. For why should the sterility be so extremely\r\ndifferent in degree, when various species are crossed, all of which we\r\nmust suppose it would be equally important to keep from blending\r\ntogether? Why should the degree of sterility be innately variable in\r\nthe individuals of the same species? Why should some species cross with\r\nfacility and yet produce very sterile hybrids; and other species cross\r\nwith extreme difficulty, and yet produce fairly fertile hybrids? Why\r\nshould there often be so great a difference in the result of a\r\nreciprocal cross between the same two species? Why, it may even be\r\nasked, has the production of hybrids been permitted? To grant to\r\nspecies the special power of producing hybrids, and then to stop their\r\nfurther propagation by different degrees of sterility, not strictly\r\nrelated to the facility of the first union between their parents, seems\r\na strange arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing rules and facts, on the other hand, appear to me clearly\r\nto indicate that the sterility, both of first crosses and of hybrids,\r\nis simply incidental or dependent on unknown differences in their\r\nreproductive systems; the differences being of so peculiar and limited\r\na nature, that, in reciprocal crosses between the same two species, the\r\nmale sexual element of the one will often freely act on the female\r\nsexual element of the other, but not in a reversed direction. It will\r\nbe advisable to explain a little more fully, by an example, what I mean\r\nby sterility being incidental on other differences, and not a specially\r\nendowed quality. As the capacity of one plant to be grafted or budded\r\non another is unimportant for their welfare in a state of nature, I\r\npresume that no one will suppose that this capacity is a _specially_\r\nendowed quality, but will admit that it is incidental on differences in\r\nthe laws of growth of the two plants. We can sometimes see the reason\r\nwhy one tree will not take on another from differences in their rate of\r\ngrowth, in the hardness of their wood, in the period of the flow or\r\nnature of their sap, &c.; but in a multitude of cases we can assign no\r\nreason whatever. Great diversity in the size of two plants, one being\r\nwoody and the other herbaceous, one being evergreen and the other\r\ndeciduous, and adaptation to widely different climates, does not always\r\nprevent the two grafting together. As in hybridisation, so with\r\ngrafting, the capacity is limited by systematic affinity, for no one\r\nhas been able to graft together trees belonging to quite distinct\r\nfamilies; and, on the other hand, closely allied species and varieties\r\nof the same species, can usually, but not invariably, be grafted with\r\nease. But this capacity, as in hybridisation, is by no means absolutely\r\ngoverned by systematic affinity. Although many distinct genera within\r\nthe same family have been grafted together, in other cases species of\r\nthe same genus will not take on each other. The pear can be grafted far\r\nmore readily on the quince, which is ranked as a distinct genus, than\r\non the apple, which is a member of the same genus. Even different\r\nvarieties of the pear take with different degrees of facility on the\r\nquince; so do different varieties of the apricot and peach on certain\r\nvarieties of the plum.\r\n\r\nAs Gärtner found that there was sometimes an innate difference in\r\ndifferent _individuals_ of the same two species in crossing; so Sagaret\r\nbelieves this to be the case with different individuals of the same two\r\nspecies in being grafted together. As in reciprocal crosses, the\r\nfacility of effecting an union is often very far from equal, so it\r\nsometimes is in grafting. The common gooseberry, for instance, cannot\r\nbe grafted on the currant, whereas the currant will take, though with\r\ndifficulty, on the gooseberry.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the sterility of hybrids which have their\r\nreproductive organs in an imperfect condition, is a different case from\r\nthe difficulty of uniting two pure species, which have their\r\nreproductive organs perfect; yet these two distinct classes of cases\r\nrun to a large extent parallel. Something analogous occurs in grafting;\r\nfor Thouin found that three species of Robinia, which seeded freely on\r\ntheir own roots, and which could be grafted with no great difficulty on\r\na fourth species, when thus grafted were rendered barren. On the other\r\nhand, certain species of Sorbus, when grafted on other species, yielded\r\ntwice as much fruit as when on their own roots. We are reminded by this\r\nlatter fact of the extraordinary cases of Hippeastrum, Passiflora, &c.,\r\nwhich seed much more freely when fertilised with the pollen of a\r\ndistinct species than when fertilised with pollen from the same plant.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that, although there is a clear and great difference\r\nbetween the mere adhesion of grafted stocks and the union of the male\r\nand female elements in the act of reproduction, yet that there is a\r\nrude degree of parallelism in the results of grafting and of crossing\r\ndistinct species. And as we must look at the curious and complex laws\r\ngoverning the facility with which trees can be grafted on each other as\r\nincidental on unknown differences in their vegetative systems, so I\r\nbelieve that the still more complex laws governing the facility of\r\nfirst crosses are incidental on unknown differences in their\r\nreproductive systems. These differences in both cases follow, to a\r\ncertain extent, as might have been expected, systematic affinity, by\r\nwhich term every kind of resemblance and dissimilarity between organic\r\nbeings is attempted to be expressed. The facts by no means seem to\r\nindicate that the greater or lesser difficulty of either grafting or\r\ncrossing various species has been a special endowment; although in the\r\ncase of crossing, the difficulty is as important for the endurance and\r\nstability of specific forms as in the case of grafting it is\r\nunimportant for their welfare.\r\n\r\n_Origin and Causes of the Sterility of first Crosses and of Hybrids._\r\n\r\n\r\nAt one time it appeared to me probable, as it has to others, that the\r\nsterility of first crosses and of hybrids might have been slowly\r\nacquired through the natural selection of slightly lessened degrees of\r\nfertility, which, like any other variation, spontaneously appeared in\r\ncertain individuals of one variety when crossed with those of another\r\nvariety. For it would clearly be advantageous to two varieties or\r\nincipient species if they could be kept from blending, on the same\r\nprinciple that, when man is selecting at the same time two varieties,\r\nit is necessary that he should keep them separate. In the first place,\r\nit may be remarked that species inhabiting distinct regions are often\r\nsterile when crossed; now it could clearly have been of no advantage to\r\nsuch separated species to have been rendered mutually sterile, and\r\nconsequently this could not have been effected through natural\r\nselection; but it may perhaps be argued, that, if a species was\r\nrendered sterile with some one compatriot, sterility with other species\r\nwould follow as a necessary contingency. In the second place, it is\r\nalmost as much opposed to the theory of natural selection as to that of\r\nspecial creation, that in reciprocal crosses the male element of one\r\nform should have been rendered utterly impotent on a second form, while\r\nat the same time the male element of this second form is enabled freely\r\nto fertilise the first form; for this peculiar state of the\r\nreproductive system could hardly have been advantageous to either\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIn considering the probability of natural selection having come into\r\naction, in rendering species mutually sterile, the greatest difficulty\r\nwill be found to lie in the existence of many graduated steps, from\r\nslightly lessened fertility to absolute sterility. It may be admitted\r\nthat it would profit an incipient species, if it were rendered in some\r\nslight degree sterile when crossed with its parent form or with some\r\nother variety; for thus fewer bastardised and deteriorated offspring\r\nwould be produced to commingle their blood with the new species in\r\nprocess of formation. But he who will take the trouble to reflect on\r\nthe steps by which this first degree of sterility could be increased\r\nthrough natural selection to that high degree which is common with so\r\nmany species, and which is universal with species which have been\r\ndifferentiated to a generic or family rank, will find the subject\r\nextraordinarily complex. After mature reflection, it seems to me that\r\nthis could not have been effected through natural selection. Take the\r\ncase of any two species which, when crossed, produced few and sterile\r\noffspring; now, what is there which could favour the survival of those\r\nindividuals which happened to be endowed in a slightly higher degree\r\nwith mutual infertility, and which thus approached by one small step\r\ntowards absolute sterility? Yet an advance of this kind, if the theory\r\nof natural selection be brought to bear, must have incessantly occurred\r\nwith many species, for a multitude are mutually quite barren. With\r\nsterile neuter insects we have reason to believe that modifications in\r\ntheir structure and fertility have been slowly accumulated by natural\r\nselection, from an advantage having been thus indirectly given to the\r\ncommunity to which they belonged over other communities of the same\r\nspecies; but an individual animal not belonging to a social community,\r\nif rendered slightly sterile when crossed with some other variety,\r\nwould not thus itself gain any advantage or indirectly give any\r\nadvantage to the other individuals of the same variety, thus leading to\r\ntheir preservation.\r\n\r\nBut it would be superfluous to discuss this question in detail: for\r\nwith plants we have conclusive evidence that the sterility of crossed\r\nspecies must be due to some principle, quite independent of natural\r\nselection. Both Gärtner and Kölreuter have proved that in genera\r\nincluding numerous species, a series can be formed from species which\r\nwhen crossed yield fewer and fewer seeds, to species which never\r\nproduce a single seed, but yet are affected by the pollen of certain\r\nother species, for the germen swells. It is here manifestly impossible\r\nto select the more sterile individuals, which have already ceased to\r\nyield seeds; so that this acme of sterility, when the germen alone is\r\neffected, cannot have been gained through selection; and from the laws\r\ngoverning the various grades of sterility being so uniform throughout\r\nthe animal and vegetable kingdoms, we may infer that the cause,\r\nwhatever it may be, is the same or nearly the same in all cases.\r\n\r\nWe will now look a little closer at the probable nature of the\r\ndifferences between species which induce sterility in first crosses and\r\nin hybrids. In the case of first crosses, the greater or less\r\ndifficulty in effecting a union and in obtaining offspring apparently\r\ndepends on several distinct causes. There must sometimes be a physical\r\nimpossibility in the male element reaching the ovule, as would be the\r\ncase with a plant having a pistil too long for the pollen-tubes to\r\nreach the ovarium. It has also been observed that when the pollen of\r\none species is placed on the stigma of a distantly allied species,\r\nthough the pollen-tubes protrude, they do not penetrate the stigmatic\r\nsurface. Again, the male element may reach the female element, but be\r\nincapable of causing an embryo to be developed, as seems to have been\r\nthe case with some of Thuret’s experiments on Fuci. No explanation can\r\nbe given of these facts, any more than why certain trees cannot be\r\ngrafted on others. Lastly, an embryo may be developed, and then perish\r\nat an early period. This latter alternative has not been sufficiently\r\nattended to; but I believe, from observations communicated to me by Mr.\r\nHewitt, who has had great experience in hybridising pheasants and\r\nfowls, that the early death of the embryo is a very frequent cause of\r\nsterility in first crosses. Mr. Salter has recently given the results\r\nof an examination of about 500 eggs produced from various crosses\r\nbetween three species of Gallus and their hybrids; the majority of\r\nthese eggs had been fertilised; and in the majority of the fertilised\r\neggs, the embryos had either been partially developed and had then\r\nperished, or had become nearly mature, but the young chickens had been\r\nunable to break through the shell. Of the chickens which were born,\r\nmore than four-fifths died within the first few days, or at latest\r\nweeks, “without any obvious cause, apparently from mere inability to\r\nlive;” so that from the 500 eggs only twelve chickens were reared. With\r\nplants, hybridized embryos probably often perish in a like manner; at\r\nleast it is known that hybrids raised from very distinct species are\r\nsometimes weak and dwarfed, and perish at an early age; of which fact\r\nMax Wichura has recently given some striking cases with hybrid willows.\r\nIt may be here worth noticing that in some cases of parthenogenesis,\r\nthe embryos within the eggs of silk moths which had not been\r\nfertilised, pass through their early stages of development and then\r\nperish like the embryos produced by a cross between distinct species.\r\nUntil becoming acquainted with these facts, I was unwilling to believe\r\nin the frequent early death of hybrid embryos; for hybrids, when once\r\nborn, are generally healthy and long-lived, as we see in the case of\r\nthe common mule. Hybrids, however, are differently circumstanced before\r\nand after birth: when born and living in a country where their two\r\nparents live, they are generally placed under suitable conditions of\r\nlife. But a hybrid partakes of only half of the nature and constitution\r\nof its mother; it may therefore, before birth, as long as it is\r\nnourished within its mother’s womb, or within the egg or seed produced\r\nby the mother, be exposed to conditions in some degree unsuitable, and\r\nconsequently be liable to perish at an early period; more especially as\r\nall very young beings are eminently sensitive to injurious or unnatural\r\nconditions of life. But after all, the cause more probably lies in some\r\nimperfection in the original act of impregnation, causing the embryo to\r\nbe imperfectly developed, rather than in the conditions to which it is\r\nsubsequently exposed.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the sterility of hybrids, in which the sexual elements are\r\nimperfectly developed, the case is somewhat different. I have more than\r\nonce alluded to a large body of facts showing that, when animals and\r\nplants are removed from their natural conditions, they are extremely\r\nliable to have their reproductive systems seriously affected. This, in\r\nfact, is the great bar to the domestication of animals. Between the\r\nsterility thus superinduced and that of hybrids, there are many points\r\nof similarity. In both cases the sterility is independent of general\r\nhealth, and is often accompanied by excess of size or great luxuriance.\r\nIn both cases the sterility occurs in various degrees; in both, the\r\nmale element is the most liable to be affected; but sometimes the\r\nfemale more than the male. In both, the tendency goes to a certain\r\nextent with systematic affinity, for whole groups of animals and plants\r\nare rendered impotent by the same unnatural conditions; and whole\r\ngroups of species tend to produce sterile hybrids. On the other hand,\r\none species in a group will sometimes resist great changes of\r\nconditions with unimpaired fertility; and certain species in a group\r\nwill produce unusually fertile hybrids. No one can tell till he tries,\r\nwhether any particular animal will breed under confinement, or any\r\nexotic plant seed freely under culture; nor can he tell till he tries,\r\nwhether any two species of a genus will produce more or less sterile\r\nhybrids. Lastly, when organic beings are placed during several\r\ngenerations under conditions not natural to them, they are extremely\r\nliable to vary, which seems to be partly due to their reproductive\r\nsystems having been specially affected, though in a lesser degree than\r\nwhen sterility ensues. So it is with hybrids, for their offspring in\r\nsuccessive generations are eminently liable to vary, as every\r\nexperimentalist has observed.\r\n\r\nThus we see that when organic beings are placed under new and unnatural\r\nconditions, and when hybrids are produced by the unnatural crossing of\r\ntwo species, the reproductive system, independently of the general\r\nstate of health, is affected in a very similar manner. In the one case,\r\nthe conditions of life have been disturbed, though often in so slight a\r\ndegree as to be inappreciable by us; in the other case, or that of\r\nhybrids, the external conditions have remained the same, but the\r\norganisation has been disturbed by two distinct structures and\r\nconstitutions, including of course the reproductive systems, having\r\nbeen blended into one. For it is scarcely possible that two\r\norganisations should be compounded into one, without some disturbance\r\noccurring in the development, or periodical action, or mutual relations\r\nof the different parts and organs one to another or to the conditions\r\nof life. When hybrids are able to breed _inter se_, they transmit to\r\ntheir offspring from generation to generation the same compounded\r\norganisation, and hence we need not be surprised that their sterility,\r\nthough in some degree variable, does not diminish; it is even apt to\r\nincrease, this being generally the result, as before explained, of too\r\nclose interbreeding. The above view of the sterility of hybrids being\r\ncaused by two constitutions being compounded into one has been strongly\r\nmaintained by Max Wichura.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be owned that we cannot understand, on the above or\r\nany other view, several facts with respect to the sterility of hybrids;\r\nfor instance, the unequal fertility of hybrids produced from reciprocal\r\ncrosses; or the increased sterility in those hybrids which occasionally\r\nand exceptionally resemble closely either pure parent. Nor do I pretend\r\nthat the foregoing remarks go to the root of the matter: no explanation\r\nis offered why an organism, when placed under unnatural conditions, is\r\nrendered sterile. All that I have attempted to show is, that in two\r\ncases, in some respects allied, sterility is the common result—in the\r\none case from the conditions of life having been disturbed, in the\r\nother case from the organisation having been disturbed by two\r\norganisations being compounded into one.\r\n\r\nA similar parallelism holds good with an allied yet very different\r\nclass of facts. It is an old and almost universal belief, founded on a\r\nconsiderable body of evidence, which I have elsewhere given, that\r\nslight changes in the conditions of life are beneficial to all living\r\nthings. We see this acted on by farmers and gardeners in their frequent\r\nexchanges of seed, tubers, &c., from one soil or climate to another,\r\nand back again. During the convalescence of animals, great benefit is\r\nderived from almost any change in their habits of life. Again, both\r\nwith plants and animals, there is the clearest evidence that a cross\r\nbetween individuals of the same species, which differ to a certain\r\nextent, gives vigour and fertility to the offspring; and that close\r\ninterbreeding continued during several generations between the nearest\r\nrelations, if these be kept under the same conditions of life, almost\r\nalways leads to decreased size, weakness, or sterility.\r\n\r\nHence it seems that, on the one hand, slight changes in the conditions\r\nof life benefit all organic beings, and on the other hand, that slight\r\ncrosses, that is, crosses between the males and females of the same\r\nspecies, which have been subjected to slightly different conditions, or\r\nwhich have slightly varied, give vigour and fertility to the offspring.\r\nBut, as we have seen, organic beings long habituated to certain uniform\r\nconditions under a state of nature, when subjected, as under\r\nconfinement, to a considerable change in their conditions, very\r\nfrequently are rendered more or less sterile; and we know that a cross\r\nbetween two forms that have become widely or specifically different,\r\nproduce hybrids which are almost always in some degree sterile. I am\r\nfully persuaded that this double parallelism is by no means an accident\r\nor an illusion. He who is able to explain why the elephant, and a\r\nmultitude of other animals, are incapable of breeding when kept under\r\nonly partial confinement in their native country, will be able to\r\nexplain the primary cause of hybrids being so generally sterile. He\r\nwill at the same time be able to explain how it is that the races of\r\nsome of our domesticated animals, which have often been subjected to\r\nnew and not uniform conditions, are quite fertile together, although\r\nthey are descended from distinct species, which would probably have\r\nbeen sterile if aboriginally crossed. The above two parallel series of\r\nfacts seem to be connected together by some common but unknown bond,\r\nwhich is essentially related to the principle of life; this principle,\r\naccording to Mr. Herbert Spencer, being that life depends on, or\r\nconsists in, the incessant action and reaction of various forces,\r\nwhich, as throughout nature, are always tending towards an equilibrium;\r\nand when this tendency is slightly disturbed by any change, the vital\r\nforces gain in power.\r\n\r\n_Reciprocal Dimorphism and Trimorphism._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis subject may be here briefly discussed, and will be found to throw\r\nsome light on hybridism. Several plants belonging to distinct orders\r\npresent two forms, which exist in about equal numbers and which differ\r\nin no respect except in their reproductive organs; one form having a\r\nlong pistil with short stamens, the other a short pistil with long\r\nstamens; the two having differently sized pollen-grains. With\r\ntrimorphic plants there are three forms likewise differing in the\r\nlengths of their pistils and stamens, in the size and colour of the\r\npollen-grains, and in some other respects; and as in each of the three\r\nforms there are two sets of stamens, the three forms possess altogether\r\nsix sets of stamens and three kinds of pistils. These organs are so\r\nproportioned in length to each other, that half the stamens in two of\r\nthe forms stand on a level with the stigma of the third form. Now I\r\nhave shown, and the result has been confirmed by other observers, that\r\nin order to obtain full fertility with these plants, it is necessary\r\nthat the stigma of the one form should be fertilised by pollen taken\r\nfrom the stamens of corresponding height in another form. So that with\r\ndimorphic species two unions, which may be called legitimate, are fully\r\nfertile; and two, which may be called illegitimate, are more or less\r\ninfertile. With trimorphic species six unions are legitimate, or fully\r\nfertile, and twelve are illegitimate, or more or less infertile.\r\n\r\nThe infertility which may be observed in various dimorphic and\r\ntrimorphic plants, when they are illegitimately fertilised, that is by\r\npollen taken from stamens not corresponding in height with the pistil,\r\ndiffers much in degree, up to absolute and utter sterility; just in the\r\nsame manner as occurs in crossing distinct species. As the degree of\r\nsterility in the latter case depends in an eminent degree on the\r\nconditions of life being more or less favourable, so I have found it\r\nwith illegitimate unions. It is well known that if pollen of a distinct\r\nspecies be placed on the stigma of a flower, and its own pollen be\r\nafterwards, even after a considerable interval of time, placed on the\r\nsame stigma, its action is so strongly prepotent that it generally\r\nannihilates the effect of the foreign pollen; so it is with the pollen\r\nof the several forms of the same species, for legitimate pollen is\r\nstrongly prepotent over illegitimate pollen, when both are placed on\r\nthe same stigma. I ascertained this by fertilising several flowers,\r\nfirst illegitimately, and twenty-four hours afterwards legitimately,\r\nwith pollen taken from a peculiarly coloured variety, and all the\r\nseedlings were similarly coloured; this shows that the legitimate\r\npollen, though applied twenty-four hours subsequently, had wholly\r\ndestroyed or prevented the action of the previously applied\r\nillegitimate pollen. Again, as in making reciprocal crosses between the\r\nsame two species, there is occasionally a great difference in the\r\nresult, so the same thing occurs with trimorphic plants; for instance,\r\nthe mid-styled form of Lythrum salicaria was illegitimately fertilised\r\nwith the greatest ease by pollen from the longer stamens of the\r\nshort-styled form, and yielded many seeds; but the latter form did not\r\nyield a single seed when fertilised by the longer stamens of the\r\nmid-styled form.\r\n\r\nIn all these respects, and in others which might be added, the forms of\r\nthe same undoubted species, when illegitimately united, behave in\r\nexactly the same manner as do two distinct species when crossed. This\r\nled me carefully to observe during four years many seedlings, raised\r\nfrom several illegitimate unions. The chief result is that these\r\nillegitimate plants, as they may be called, are not fully fertile. It\r\nis possible to raise from dimorphic species, both long-styled and\r\nshort-styled illegitimate plants, and from trimorphic plants all three\r\nillegitimate forms. These can then be properly united in a legitimate\r\nmanner. When this is done, there is no apparent reason why they should\r\nnot yield as many seeds as did their parents when legitimately\r\nfertilised. But such is not the case. They are all infertile, in\r\nvarious degrees; some being so utterly and incurably sterile that they\r\ndid not yield during four seasons a single seed or even seed-capsule.\r\nThe sterility of these illegitimate plants, when united with each other\r\nin a legitimate manner, may be strictly compared with that of hybrids\r\nwhen crossed _inter se_. If, on the other hand, a hybrid is crossed\r\nwith either pure parent-species, the sterility is usually much\r\nlessened: and so it is when an illegitimate plant is fertilised by a\r\nlegitimate plant. In the same manner as the sterility of hybrids does\r\nnot always run parallel with the difficulty of making the first cross\r\nbetween the two parent-species, so that sterility of certain\r\nillegitimate plants was unusually great, while the sterility of the\r\nunion from which they were derived was by no means great. With hybrids\r\nraised from the same seed-capsule the degree of sterility is innately\r\nvariable, so it is in a marked manner with illegitimate plants. Lastly,\r\nmany hybrids are profuse and persistent flowerers, while other and more\r\nsterile hybrids produce few flowers, and are weak, miserable dwarfs;\r\nexactly similar cases occur with the illegitimate offspring of various\r\ndimorphic and trimorphic plants.\r\n\r\nAltogether there is the closest identity in character and behaviour\r\nbetween illegitimate plants and hybrids. It is hardly an exaggeration\r\nto maintain that illegitimate plants are hybrids, produced within the\r\nlimits of the same species by the improper union of certain forms,\r\nwhile ordinary hybrids are produced from an improper union between\r\nso-called distinct species. We have also already seen that there is the\r\nclosest similarity in all respects between first illegitimate unions\r\nand first crosses between distinct species. This will perhaps be made\r\nmore fully apparent by an illustration; we may suppose that a botanist\r\nfound two well-marked varieties (and such occur) of the long-styled\r\nform of the trimorphic Lythrum salicaria, and that he determined to try\r\nby crossing whether they were specifically distinct. He would find that\r\nthey yielded only about one-fifth of the proper number of seed, and\r\nthat they behaved in all the other above specified respects as if they\r\nhad been two distinct species. But to make the case sure, he would\r\nraise plants from his supposed hybridised seed, and he would find that\r\nthe seedlings were miserably dwarfed and utterly sterile, and that they\r\nbehaved in all other respects like ordinary hybrids. He might then\r\nmaintain that he had actually proved, in accordance with the common\r\nview, that his two varieties were as good and as distinct species as\r\nany in the world; but he would be completely mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe facts now given on dimorphic and trimorphic plants are important,\r\nbecause they show us, first, that the physiological test of lessened\r\nfertility, both in first crosses and in hybrids, is no safe criterion\r\nof specific distinction; secondly, because we may conclude that there\r\nis some unknown bond which connects the infertility of illegitimate\r\nunions with that of their illegitimate offspring, and we are led to\r\nextend the same view to first crosses and hybrids; thirdly, because we\r\nfind, and this seems to me of especial importance, that two or three\r\nforms of the same species may exist and may differ in no respect\r\nwhatever, either in structure or in constitution, relatively to\r\nexternal conditions, and yet be sterile when united in certain ways.\r\nFor we must remember that it is the union of the sexual elements of\r\nindividuals of the same form, for instance, of two long-styled forms,\r\nwhich results in sterility; while it is the union of the sexual\r\nelements proper to two distinct forms which is fertile. Hence the case\r\nappears at first sight exactly the reverse of what occurs, in the\r\nordinary unions of the individuals of the same species and with crosses\r\nbetween distinct species. It is, however, doubtful whether this is\r\nreally so; but I will not enlarge on this obscure subject.\r\n\r\nWe may, however, infer as probable from the consideration of dimorphic\r\nand trimorphic plants, that the sterility of distinct species when\r\ncrossed and of their hybrid progeny, depends exclusively on the nature\r\nof their sexual elements, and not on any difference in their structure\r\nor general constitution. We are also led to this same conclusion by\r\nconsidering reciprocal crosses, in which the male of one species cannot\r\nbe united, or can be united with great difficulty, with the female of a\r\nsecond species, while the converse cross can be effected with perfect\r\nfacility. That excellent observer, Gärtner, likewise concluded that\r\nspecies when crossed are sterile owing to differences confined to their\r\nreproductive systems.\r\n\r\n_Fertility of Varieties when Crossed, and of their Mongrel Offspring,\r\nnot universal._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be urged as an overwhelming argument that there must be some\r\nessential distinction between species and varieties inasmuch as the\r\nlatter, however much they may differ from each other in external\r\nappearance, cross with perfect facility, and yield perfectly fertile\r\noffspring. With some exceptions, presently to be given, I fully admit\r\nthat this is the rule. But the subject is surrounded by difficulties,\r\nfor, looking to varieties produced under nature, if two forms hitherto\r\nreputed to be varieties be found in any degree sterile together, they\r\nare at once ranked by most naturalists as species. For instance, the\r\nblue and red pimpernel, which are considered by most botanists as\r\nvarieties, are said by Gärtner to be quite sterile when crossed, and he\r\nconsequently ranks them as undoubted species. If we thus argue in a\r\ncircle, the fertility of all varieties produced under nature will\r\nassuredly have to be granted.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to varieties, produced, or supposed to have been produced,\r\nunder domestication, we are still involved in some doubt. For when it\r\nis stated, for instance, that certain South American indigenous\r\ndomestic dogs do not readily unite with European dogs, the explanation\r\nwhich will occur to everyone, and probably the true one, is that they\r\nare descended from aboriginally distinct species. Nevertheless the\r\nperfect fertility of so many domestic races, differing widely from each\r\nother in appearance, for instance, those of the pigeon, or of the\r\ncabbage, is a remarkable fact; more especially when we reflect how many\r\nspecies there are, which, though resembling each other most closely,\r\nare utterly sterile when intercrossed. Several considerations, however,\r\nrender the fertility of domestic varieties less remarkable. In the\r\nfirst place, it may be observed that the amount of external difference\r\nbetween two species is no sure guide to their degree of mutual\r\nsterility, so that similar differences in the case of varieties would\r\nbe no sure guide. It is certain that with species the cause lies\r\nexclusively in differences in their sexual constitution. Now the\r\nvarying conditions to which domesticated animals and cultivated plants\r\nhave been subjected, have had so little tendency towards modifying the\r\nreproductive system in a manner leading to mutual sterility, that we\r\nhave good grounds for admitting the directly opposite doctrine of\r\nPallas, namely, that such conditions generally eliminate this tendency;\r\nso that the domesticated descendants of species, which in their natural\r\nstate probably would have been in some degree sterile when crossed,\r\nbecome perfectly fertile together. With plants, so far is cultivation\r\nfrom giving a tendency towards sterility between distinct species, that\r\nin several well-authenticated cases already alluded to, certain plants\r\nhave been affected in an opposite manner, for they have become\r\nself-impotent, while still retaining the capacity of fertilising, and\r\nbeing fertilised by, other species. If the Pallasian doctrine of the\r\nelimination of sterility through long-continued domestication be\r\nadmitted, and it can hardly be rejected, it becomes in the highest\r\ndegree improbable that similar conditions long-continued should\r\nlikewise induce this tendency; though in certain cases, with species\r\nhaving a peculiar constitution, sterility might occasionally be thus\r\ncaused. Thus, as I believe, we can understand why, with domesticated\r\nanimals, varieties have not been produced which are mutually sterile;\r\nand why with plants only a few such cases, immediately to be given,\r\nhave been observed.\r\n\r\nThe real difficulty in our present subject is not, as it appears to me,\r\nwhy domestic varieties have not become mutually infertile when crossed,\r\nbut why this has so generally occurred with natural varieties, as soon\r\nas they have been permanently modified in a sufficient degree to take\r\nrank as species. We are far from precisely knowing the cause; nor is\r\nthis surprising, seeing how profoundly ignorant we are in regard to the\r\nnormal and abnormal action of the reproductive system. But we can see\r\nthat species, owing to their struggle for existence with numerous\r\ncompetitors, will have been exposed during long periods of time to more\r\nuniform conditions, than have domestic varieties; and this may well\r\nmake a wide difference in the result. For we know how commonly wild\r\nanimals and plants, when taken from their natural conditions and\r\nsubjected to captivity, are rendered sterile; and the reproductive\r\nfunctions of organic beings which have always lived under natural\r\nconditions would probably in like manner be eminently sensitive to the\r\ninfluence of an unnatural cross. Domesticated productions, on the other\r\nhand, which, as shown by the mere fact of their domestication, were not\r\noriginally highly sensitive to changes in their conditions of life, and\r\nwhich can now generally resist with undiminished fertility repeated\r\nchanges of conditions, might be expected to produce varieties, which\r\nwould be little liable to have their reproductive powers injuriously\r\naffected by the act of crossing with other varieties which had\r\noriginated in a like manner.\r\n\r\nI have as yet spoken as if the varieties of the same species were\r\ninvariably fertile when intercrossed. But it is impossible to resist\r\nthe evidence of the existence of a certain amount of sterility in the\r\nfew following cases, which I will briefly abstract. The evidence is at\r\nleast as good as that from which we believe in the sterility of a\r\nmultitude of species. The evidence is also derived from hostile\r\nwitnesses, who in all other cases consider fertility and sterility as\r\nsafe criterions of specific distinction. Gärtner kept, during several\r\nyears, a dwarf kind of maize with yellow seeds, and a tall variety with\r\nred seeds growing near each other in his garden; and although these\r\nplants have separated sexes, they never naturally crossed. He then\r\nfertilised thirteen flowers of the one kind with pollen of the other;\r\nbut only a single head produced any seed, and this one head produced\r\nonly five grains. Manipulation in this case could not have been\r\ninjurious, as the plants have separated sexes. No one, I believe, has\r\nsuspected that these varieties of maize are distinct species; and it is\r\nimportant to notice that the hybrid plants thus raised were themselves\r\n_perfectly_ fertile; so that even Gärtner did not venture to consider\r\nthe two varieties as specifically distinct.\r\n\r\nGirou de Buzareingues crossed three varieties of gourd, which like the\r\nmaize has separated sexes, and he asserts that their mutual\r\nfertilisation is by so much the less easy as their differences are\r\ngreater. How far these experiments may be trusted, I know not; but the\r\nforms experimented on are ranked by Sagaret, who mainly founds his\r\nclassification by the test of infertility, as varieties, and Naudin has\r\ncome to the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe following case is far more remarkable, and seems at first\r\nincredible; but it is the result of an astonishing number of\r\nexperiments made during many years on nine species of Verbascum, by so\r\ngood an observer and so hostile a witness as Gärtner: namely, that the\r\nyellow and white varieties when crossed produce less seed than the\r\nsimilarly coloured varieties of the same species. Moreover, he asserts\r\nthat, when yellow and white varieties of one species are crossed with\r\nyellow and white varieties of a _distinct_ species, more seed is\r\nproduced by the crosses between the similarly coloured flowers, than\r\nbetween those which are differently coloured. Mr. Scott also has\r\nexperimented on the species and varieties of Verbascum; and although\r\nunable to confirm Gärtner’s results on the crossing of the distinct\r\nspecies, he finds that the dissimilarly coloured varieties of the same\r\nspecies yield fewer seeds, in the proportion of eighty-six to 100, than\r\nthe similarly coloured varieties. Yet these varieties differ in no\r\nrespect, except in the colour of their flowers; and one variety can\r\nsometimes be raised from the seed of another.\r\n\r\nKölreuter, whose accuracy has been confirmed by every subsequent\r\nobserver, has proved the remarkable fact that one particular variety of\r\nthe common tobacco was more fertile than the other varieties, when\r\ncrossed with a widely distinct species. He experimented on five forms\r\nwhich are commonly reputed to be varieties, and which he tested by the\r\nseverest trial, namely, by reciprocal crosses, and he found their\r\nmongrel offspring perfectly fertile. But one of these five varieties,\r\nwhen used either as the father or mother, and crossed with the\r\nNicotiana glutinosa, always yielded hybrids not so sterile as those\r\nwhich were produced from the four other varieties when crossed with N.\r\nglutinosa. Hence the reproductive system of this one variety must have\r\nbeen in some manner and in some degree modified.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts it can no longer be maintained that varieties when\r\ncrossed are invariably quite fertile. From the great difficulty of\r\nascertaining the infertility of varieties in a state of nature, for a\r\nsupposed variety, if proved to be infertile in any degree, would almost\r\nuniversally be ranked as a species; from man attending only to external\r\ncharacters in his domestic varieties, and from such varieties not\r\nhaving been exposed for very long periods to uniform conditions of\r\nlife; from these several considerations we may conclude that fertility\r\ndoes not constitute a fundamental distinction between varieties and\r\nspecies when crossed. The general sterility of crossed species may\r\nsafely be looked at, not as a special acquirement or endowment, but as\r\nincidental on changes of an unknown nature in their sexual elements.\r\n\r\n_Hybrids and Mongrels compared, independently of their fertility._\r\n\r\n\r\nIndependently of the question of fertility, the offspring of species\r\nand of varieties when crossed may be compared in several other\r\nrespects. Gärtner, whose strong wish it was to draw a distinct line\r\nbetween species and varieties, could find very few, and, as it seems to\r\nme, quite unimportant differences between the so-called hybrid\r\noffspring of species, and the so-called mongrel offspring of varieties.\r\nAnd, on the other hand, they agree most closely in many important\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\nI shall here discuss this subject with extreme brevity. The most\r\nimportant distinction is, that in the first generation mongrels are\r\nmore variable than hybrids; but Gärtner admits that hybrids from\r\nspecies which have long been cultivated are often variable in the first\r\ngeneration; and I have myself seen striking instances of this fact.\r\nGärtner further admits that hybrids between very closely allied species\r\nare more variable than those from very distinct species; and this shows\r\nthat the difference in the degree of variability graduates away. When\r\nmongrels and the more fertile hybrids are propagated for several\r\ngenerations, an extreme amount of variability in the offspring in both\r\ncases is notorious; but some few instances of both hybrids and mongrels\r\nlong retaining a uniform character could be given. The variability,\r\nhowever, in the successive generations of mongrels is, perhaps, greater\r\nthan in hybrids.\r\n\r\nThis greater variability in mongrels than in hybrids does not seem at\r\nall surprising. For the parents of mongrels are varieties, and mostly\r\ndomestic varieties (very few experiments having been tried on natural\r\nvarieties), and this implies that there has been recent variability;\r\nwhich would often continue and would augment that arising from the act\r\nof crossing. The slight variability of hybrids in the first generation,\r\nin contrast with that in the succeeding generations, is a curious fact\r\nand deserves attention. For it bears on the view which I have taken of\r\none of the causes of ordinary variability; namely, that the\r\nreproductive system, from being eminently sensitive to changed\r\nconditions of life, fails under these circumstances to perform its\r\nproper function of producing offspring closely similar in all respects\r\nto the parent-form. Now, hybrids in the first generation are descended\r\nfrom species (excluding those long cultivated) which have not had their\r\nreproductive systems in any way affected, and they are not variable;\r\nbut hybrids themselves have their reproductive systems seriously\r\naffected, and their descendants are highly variable.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our comparison of mongrels and hybrids: Gärtner states\r\nthat mongrels are more liable than hybrids to revert to either parent\r\nform; but this, if it be true, is certainly only a difference in\r\ndegree. Moreover, Gärtner expressly states that the hybrids from long\r\ncultivated plants are more subject to reversion than hybrids from\r\nspecies in their natural state; and this probably explains the singular\r\ndifference in the results arrived at by different observers. Thus Max\r\nWichura doubts whether hybrids ever revert to their parent forms, and\r\nhe experimented on uncultivated species of willows, while Naudin, on\r\nthe other hand, insists in the strongest terms on the almost universal\r\ntendency to reversion in hybrids, and he experimented chiefly on\r\ncultivated plants. Gärtner further states that when any two species,\r\nalthough most closely allied to each other, are crossed with a third\r\nspecies, the hybrids are widely different from each other; whereas if\r\ntwo very distinct varieties of one species are crossed with another\r\nspecies, the hybrids do not differ much. But this conclusion, as far as\r\nI can make out, is founded on a single experiment; and seems directly\r\nopposed to the results of several experiments made by Kölreuter.\r\n\r\nSuch alone are the unimportant differences which Gärtner is able to\r\npoint out between hybrid and mongrel plants. On the other hand, the\r\ndegrees and kinds of resemblance in mongrels and in hybrids to their\r\nrespective parents, more especially in hybrids produced from nearly\r\nrelated species, follow, according to Gärtner the same laws. When two\r\nspecies are crossed, one has sometimes a prepotent power of impressing\r\nits likeness on the hybrid. So I believe it to be with varieties of\r\nplants; and with animals, one variety certainly often has this\r\nprepotent power over another variety. Hybrid plants produced from a\r\nreciprocal cross generally resemble each other closely, and so it is\r\nwith mongrel plants from a reciprocal cross. Both hybrids and mongrels\r\ncan be reduced to either pure parent form, by repeated crosses in\r\nsuccessive generations with either parent.\r\n\r\nThese several remarks are apparently applicable to animals; but the\r\nsubject is here much complicated, partly owing to the existence of\r\nsecondary sexual characters; but more especially owing to prepotency in\r\ntransmitting likeness running more strongly in one sex than in the\r\nother, both when one species is crossed with another and when one\r\nvariety is crossed with another variety. For instance, I think those\r\nauthors are right who maintain that the ass has a prepotent power over\r\nthe horse, so that both the mule and the hinny resemble more closely\r\nthe ass than the horse; but that the prepotency runs more strongly in\r\nthe male than in the female ass, so that the mule, which is an\r\noffspring of the male ass and mare, is more like an ass than is the\r\nhinny, which is the offspring of the female-ass and stallion.\r\n\r\nMuch stress has been laid by some authors on the supposed fact, that it\r\nis only with mongrels that the offspring are not intermediate in\r\ncharacter, but closely resemble one of their parents; but this does\r\nsometimes occur with hybrids, yet I grant much less frequently than\r\nwith mongrels. Looking to the cases which I have collected of\r\ncross-bred animals closely resembling one parent, the resemblances seem\r\nchiefly confined to characters almost monstrous in their nature, and\r\nwhich have suddenly appeared—such as albinism, melanism, deficiency of\r\ntail or horns, or additional fingers and toes; and do not relate to\r\ncharacters which have been slowly acquired through selection. A\r\ntendency to sudden reversions to the perfect character of either parent\r\nwould, also, be much more likely to occur with mongrels, which are\r\ndescended from varieties often suddenly produced and semi-monstrous in\r\ncharacter, than with hybrids, which are descended from species slowly\r\nand naturally produced. On the whole, I entirely agree with Dr. Prosper\r\nLucas, who, after arranging an enormous body of facts with respect to\r\nanimals, comes to the conclusion that the laws of resemblance of the\r\nchild to its parents are the same, whether the two parents differ\r\nlittle or much from each other, namely, in the union of individuals of\r\nthe same variety, or of different varieties, or of distinct species.\r\n\r\nIndependently of the question of fertility and sterility, in all other\r\nrespects there seems to be a general and close similarity in the\r\noffspring of crossed species, and of crossed varieties. If we look at\r\nspecies as having been specially created, and at varieties as having\r\nbeen produced by secondary laws, this similarity would be an\r\nastonishing fact. But it harmonises perfectly with the view that there\r\nis no essential distinction between species and varieties.\r\n\r\n_Summary of Chapter._\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst crosses between forms, sufficiently distinct to be ranked as\r\nspecies, and their hybrids, are very generally, but not universally,\r\nsterile. The sterility is of all degrees, and is often so slight that\r\nthe most careful experimentalists have arrived at diametrically\r\nopposite conclusions in ranking forms by this test. The sterility is\r\ninnately variable in individuals of the same species, and is eminently\r\nsusceptible to action of favourable and unfavourable conditions. The\r\ndegree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic affinity, but\r\nis governed by several curious and complex laws. It is generally\r\ndifferent, and sometimes widely different in reciprocal crosses between\r\nthe same two species. It is not always equal in degree in a first cross\r\nand in the hybrids produced from this cross.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner as in grafting trees, the capacity in one species or\r\nvariety to take on another, is incidental on differences, generally of\r\nan unknown nature, in their vegetative systems, so in crossing, the\r\ngreater or less facility of one species to unite with another is\r\nincidental on unknown differences in their reproductive systems. There\r\nis no more reason to think that species have been specially endowed\r\nwith various degrees of sterility to prevent their crossing and\r\nblending in nature, than to think that trees have been specially\r\nendowed with various and somewhat analogous degrees of difficulty in\r\nbeing grafted together in order to prevent their inarching in our\r\nforests.\r\n\r\nThe sterility of first crosses and of their hybrid progeny has not been\r\nacquired through natural selection. In the case of first crosses it\r\nseems to depend on several circumstances; in some instances in chief\r\npart on the early death of the embryo. In the case of hybrids, it\r\napparently depends on their whole organisation having been disturbed by\r\nbeing compounded from two distinct forms; the sterility being closely\r\nallied to that which so frequently affects pure species, when exposed\r\nto new and unnatural conditions of life. He who will explain these\r\nlatter cases will be able to explain the sterility of hybrids. This\r\nview is strongly supported by a parallelism of another kind: namely,\r\nthat, firstly, slight changes in the conditions of life add to the\r\nvigour and fertility of all organic beings; and secondly, that the\r\ncrossing of forms, which have been exposed to slightly different\r\nconditions of life, or which have varied, favours the size, vigour and\r\nfertility of their offspring. The facts given on the sterility of the\r\nillegitimate unions of dimorphic and trimorphic plants and of their\r\nillegitimate progeny, perhaps render it probable that some unknown bond\r\nin all cases connects the degree of fertility of first unions with that\r\nof their offspring. The consideration of these facts on dimorphism, as\r\nwell as of the results of reciprocal crosses, clearly leads to the\r\nconclusion that the primary cause of the sterility of crossed species\r\nis confined to differences in their sexual elements. But why, in the\r\ncase of distinct species, the sexual elements should so generally have\r\nbecome more or less modified, leading to their mutual infertility, we\r\ndo not know; but it seems to stand in some close relation to species\r\nhaving been exposed for long periods of time to nearly uniform\r\nconditions of life.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that the difficulty in crossing any two species,\r\nand the sterility of their hybrid offspring, should in most cases\r\ncorrespond, even if due to distinct causes: for both depend on the\r\namount of difference between the species which are crossed. Nor is it\r\nsurprising that the facility of effecting a first cross, and the\r\nfertility of the hybrids thus produced, and the capacity of being\r\ngrafted together—though this latter capacity evidently depends on\r\nwidely different circumstances—should all run, to a certain extent,\r\nparallel with the systematic affinity of the forms subjected to\r\nexperiment; for systematic affinity includes resemblances of all kinds.\r\n\r\nFirst crosses between forms known to be varieties, or sufficiently\r\nalike to be considered as varieties, and their mongrel offspring, are\r\nvery generally, but not, as is so often stated, invariably fertile. Nor\r\nis this almost universal and perfect fertility surprising, when it is\r\nremembered how liable we are to argue in a circle with respect to\r\nvarieties in a state of nature; and when we remember that the greater\r\nnumber of varieties have been produced under domestication by the\r\nselection of mere external differences, and that they have not been\r\nlong exposed to uniform conditions of life. It should also be\r\nespecially kept in mind, that long-continued domestication tends to\r\neliminate sterility, and is therefore little likely to induce this same\r\nquality. Independently of the question of fertility, in all other\r\nrespects there is the closest general resemblance between hybrids and\r\nmongrels, in their variability, in their power of absorbing each other\r\nby repeated crosses, and in their inheritance of characters from both\r\nparent-forms. Finally, then, although we are as ignorant of the precise\r\ncause of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids as we are why\r\nanimals and plants removed from their natural conditions become\r\nsterile, yet the facts given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed\r\nto the belief that species aboriginally existed as varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nON THE IMPERFECTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the absence of intermediate varieties at the present day—On the\r\nnature of extinct intermediate varieties; on their number—On the lapse\r\nof time, as inferred from the rate of denudation and of deposition\r\nnumber—On the lapse of time as estimated by years—On the poorness of\r\nour palæontological collections—On the intermittence of geological\r\nformations—On the denudation of granitic areas—On the absence of\r\nintermediate varieties in any one formation—On the sudden appearance of\r\ngroups of species—On their sudden appearance in the lowest known\r\nfossiliferous strata—Antiquity of the habitable earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the sixth chapter I enumerated the chief objections which might be\r\njustly urged against the views maintained in this volume. Most of them\r\nhave now been discussed. One, namely, the distinctness of specific\r\nforms and their not being blended together by innumerable transitional\r\nlinks, is a very obvious difficulty. I assigned reasons why such links\r\ndo not commonly occur at the present day under the circumstances\r\napparently most favourable for their presence, namely, on an extensive\r\nand continuous area with graduated physical conditions. I endeavoured\r\nto show, that the life of each species depends in a more important\r\nmanner on the presence of other already defined organic forms, than on\r\nclimate, and, therefore, that the really governing conditions of life\r\ndo not graduate away quite insensibly like heat or moisture. I\r\nendeavoured, also, to show that intermediate varieties, from existing\r\nin lesser numbers than the forms which they connect, will generally be\r\nbeaten out and exterminated during the course of further modification\r\nand improvement. The main cause, however, of innumerable intermediate\r\nlinks not now occurring everywhere throughout nature depends, on the\r\nvery process of natural selection, through which new varieties\r\ncontinually take the places of and supplant their parent-forms. But\r\njust in proportion as this process of extermination has acted on an\r\nenormous scale, so must the number of intermediate varieties, which\r\nhave formerly existed, be truly enormous. Why then is not every\r\ngeological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links?\r\nGeology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic\r\nchain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection\r\nwhich can be urged against my theory. The explanation lies, as I\r\nbelieve, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it should always be borne in mind what sort of\r\nintermediate forms must, on the theory, have formerly existed. I have\r\nfound it difficult, when looking at any two species, to avoid picturing\r\nto myself forms _directly_ intermediate between them. But this is a\r\nwholly false view; we should always look for forms intermediate between\r\neach species and a common but unknown progenitor; and the progenitor\r\nwill generally have differed in some respects from all its modified\r\ndescendants. To give a simple illustration: the fantail and pouter\r\npigeons are both descended from the rock-pigeon; if we possessed all\r\nthe intermediate varieties which have ever existed, we should have an\r\nextremely close series between both and the rock-pigeon; but we should\r\nhave no varieties directly intermediate between the fantail and pouter;\r\nnone, for instance, combining a tail somewhat expanded with a crop\r\nsomewhat enlarged, the characteristic features of these two breeds.\r\nThese two breeds, moreover, have become so much modified, that, if we\r\nhad no historical or indirect evidence regarding their origin, it would\r\nnot have been possible to have determined from a mere comparison of\r\ntheir structure with that of the rock-pigeon, C. livia, whether they\r\nhad descended from this species or from some other allied species, such\r\nas C. oenas.\r\n\r\nSo with natural species, if we look to forms very distinct, for\r\ninstance to the horse and tapir, we have no reason to suppose that\r\nlinks directly intermediate between them ever existed, but between each\r\nand an unknown common parent. The common parent will have had in its\r\nwhole organisation much general resemblance to the tapir and to the\r\nhorse; but in some points of structure may have differed considerably\r\nfrom both, even perhaps more than they differ from each other. Hence,\r\nin all such cases, we should be unable to recognise the parent-form of\r\nany two or more species, even if we closely compared the structure of\r\nthe parent with that of its modified descendants, unless at the same\r\ntime we had a nearly perfect chain of the intermediate links.\r\n\r\nIt is just possible, by the theory, that one of two living forms might\r\nhave descended from the other; for instance, a horse from a tapir; and\r\nin this case _direct_ intermediate links will have existed between\r\nthem. But such a case would imply that one form had remained for a very\r\nlong period unaltered, whilst its descendants had undergone a vast\r\namount of change; and the principle of competition between organism and\r\norganism, between child and parent, will render this a very rare event;\r\nfor in all cases the new and improved forms of life tend to supplant\r\nthe old and unimproved forms.\r\n\r\nBy the theory of natural selection all living species have been\r\nconnected with the parent-species of each genus, by differences not\r\ngreater than we see between the natural and domestic varieties of the\r\nsame species at the present day; and these parent-species, now\r\ngenerally extinct, have in their turn been similarly connected with\r\nmore ancient forms; and so on backwards, always converging to the\r\ncommon ancestor of each great class. So that the number of intermediate\r\nand transitional links, between all living and extinct species, must\r\nhave been inconceivably great. But assuredly, if this theory be true,\r\nsuch have lived upon the earth.\r\n\r\n_On the Lapse of Time, as inferred from the rate of deposition and\r\nextent of Denudation._\r\n\r\n\r\nIndependently of our not finding fossil remains of such infinitely\r\nnumerous connecting links, it may be objected that time cannot have\r\nsufficed for so great an amount of organic change, all changes having\r\nbeen effected slowly. It is hardly possible for me to recall to the\r\nreader who is not a practical geologist, the facts leading the mind\r\nfeebly to comprehend the lapse of time. He who can read Sir Charles\r\nLyell’s grand work on the Principles of Geology, which the future\r\nhistorian will recognise as having produced a revolution in natural\r\nscience, and yet does not admit how vast have been the past periods of\r\ntime, may at once close this volume. Not that it suffices to study the\r\nPrinciples of Geology, or to read special treatises by different\r\nobservers on separate formations, and to mark how each author attempts\r\nto give an inadequate idea of the duration of each formation, or even\r\nof each stratum. We can best gain some idea of past time by knowing the\r\nagencies at work; and learning how deeply the surface of the land has\r\nbeen denuded, and how much sediment has been deposited. As Lyell has\r\nwell remarked, the extent and thickness of our sedimentary formations\r\nare the result and the measure of the denudation which the earth’s\r\ncrust has elsewhere undergone. Therefore a man should examine for\r\nhimself the great piles of superimposed strata, and watch the rivulets\r\nbringing down mud, and the waves wearing away the sea-cliffs, in order\r\nto comprehend something about the duration of past time, the monuments\r\nof which we see all around us.\r\n\r\nIt is good to wander along the coast, when formed of moderately hard\r\nrocks, and mark the process of degradation. The tides in most cases\r\nreach the cliffs only for a short time twice a day, and the waves eat\r\ninto them only when they are charged with sand or pebbles; for there is\r\ngood evidence that pure water effects nothing in wearing away rock. At\r\nlast the base of the cliff is undermined, huge fragments fall down, and\r\nthese remaining fixed, have to be worn away atom by atom, until after\r\nbeing reduced in size they can be rolled about by the waves, and then\r\nthey are more quickly ground into pebbles, sand, or mud. But how often\r\ndo we see along the bases of retreating cliffs rounded boulders, all\r\nthickly clothed by marine productions, showing how little they are\r\nabraded and how seldom they are rolled about! Moreover, if we follow\r\nfor a few miles any line of rocky cliff, which is undergoing\r\ndegradation, we find that it is only here and there, along a short\r\nlength or round a promontory, that the cliffs are at the present time\r\nsuffering. The appearance of the surface and the vegetation show that\r\nelsewhere years have elapsed since the waters washed their base.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, recently learned from the observations of Ramsay, in\r\nthe van of many excellent observers—of Jukes, Geikie, Croll and others,\r\nthat subaërial degradation is a much more important agency than\r\ncoast-action, or the power of the waves. The whole surface of the land\r\nis exposed to the chemical action of the air and of the rainwater, with\r\nits dissolved carbonic acid, and in colder countries to frost; the\r\ndisintegrated matter is carried down even gentle slopes during heavy\r\nrain, and to a greater extent than might be supposed, especially in\r\narid districts, by the wind; it is then transported by the streams and\r\nrivers, which, when rapid deepen their channels, and triturate the\r\nfragments. On a rainy day, even in a gently undulating country, we see\r\nthe effects of subaërial degradation in the muddy rills which flow down\r\nevery slope. Messrs. Ramsay and Whitaker have shown, and the\r\nobservation is a most striking one, that the great lines of escarpment\r\nin the Wealden district and those ranging across England, which\r\nformerly were looked at as ancient sea-coasts, cannot have been thus\r\nformed, for each line is composed of one and the same formation, while\r\nour sea-cliffs are everywhere formed by the intersection of various\r\nformations. This being the case, we are compelled to admit that the\r\nescarpments owe their origin in chief part to the rocks of which they\r\nare composed, having resisted subaërial denudation better than the\r\nsurrounding surface; this surface consequently has been gradually\r\nlowered, with the lines of harder rock left projecting. Nothing\r\nimpresses the mind with the vast duration of time, according to our\r\nideas of time, more forcibly than the conviction thus gained that\r\nsubaërial agencies, which apparently have so little power, and which\r\nseem to work so slowly, have produced great results.\r\n\r\nWhen thus impressed with the slow rate at which the land is worn away\r\nthrough subaërial and littoral action, it is good, in order to\r\nappreciate the past duration of time, to consider, on the one hand, the\r\nmasses of rock which have been removed over many extensive areas, and\r\non the other hand the thickness of our sedimentary formations. I\r\nremember having been much struck when viewing volcanic islands, which\r\nhave been worn by the waves and pared all round into perpendicular\r\ncliffs of one or two thousand feet in height; for the gentle slope of\r\nthe lava-streams, due to their formerly liquid state, showed at a\r\nglance how far the hard, rocky beds had once extended into the open\r\nocean. The same story is told still more plainly by faults—those great\r\ncracks along which the strata have been upheaved on one side, or thrown\r\ndown on the other, to the height or depth of thousands of feet; for\r\nsince the crust cracked, and it makes no great difference whether the\r\nupheaval was sudden, or, as most geologists now believe, was slow and\r\neffected by many starts, the surface of the land has been so completely\r\nplaned down that no trace of these vast dislocations is externally\r\nvisible. The Craven fault, for instance, extends for upward of thirty\r\nmiles, and along this line the vertical displacement of the strata\r\nvaries from 600 to 3,000 feet. Professor Ramsay has published an\r\naccount of a downthrow in Anglesea of 2,300 feet; and he informs me\r\nthat he fully believes that there is one in Merionethshire of 12,000\r\nfeet; yet in these cases there is nothing on the surface of the land to\r\nshow such prodigious movements; the pile of rocks on either side of the\r\ncrack having been smoothly swept away.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in all parts of the world the piles of sedimentary\r\nstrata are of wonderful thickness. In the Cordillera, I estimated one\r\nmass of conglomerate at ten thousand feet; and although conglomerates\r\nhave probably been accumulated at a quicker rate than finer sediments,\r\nyet from being formed of worn and rounded pebbles, each of which bears\r\nthe stamp of time, they are good to show how slowly the mass must have\r\nbeen heaped together. Professor Ramsay has given me the maximum\r\nthickness, from actual measurement in most cases, of the successive\r\nformations in _different_ parts of Great Britain; and this is the\r\nresult:—\r\n\r\n\r\nFeet Palæozoic strata (not including igneous beds)\t57,154. Secondary\r\nstrata\t13,190. Tertiary strata\t2,240.\r\n\r\n\r\nthat is, very nearly thirteen and three-quarters British miles. Some of\r\nthese formations, which are represented in England by thin beds, are\r\nthousands of feet in thickness on the Continent. Moreover, between each\r\nsuccessive formation we have, in the opinion of most geologists, blank\r\nperiods of enormous length. So that the lofty pile of sedimentary rocks\r\nin Britain gives but an inadequate idea of the time which has elapsed\r\nduring their accumulation. The consideration of these various facts\r\nimpresses the mind almost in the same manner as does the vain endeavour\r\nto grapple with the idea of eternity.\r\n\r\nNevertheless this impression is partly false. Mr. Croll, in an\r\ninteresting paper, remarks that we do not err “in forming too great a\r\nconception of the length of geological periods,” but in estimating them\r\nby years. When geologists look at large and complicated phenomena, and\r\nthen at the figures representing several million years, the two produce\r\na totally different effect on the mind, and the figures are at once\r\npronounced too small. In regard to subaërial denudation, Mr. Croll\r\nshows, by calculating the known amount of sediment annually brought\r\ndown by certain rivers, relatively to their areas of drainage, that\r\n1,000 feet of solid rock, as it became gradually disintegrated, would\r\nthus be removed from the mean level of the whole area in the course of\r\nsix million years. This seems an astonishing result, and some\r\nconsiderations lead to the suspicion that it may be too large, but if\r\nhalved or quartered it is still very surprising. Few of us, however,\r\nknow what a million really means: Mr. Croll gives the following\r\nillustration: Take a narrow strip of paper, eighty-three feet four\r\ninches in length, and stretch it along the wall of a large hall; then\r\nmark off at one end the tenth of an inch. This tenth of an inch will\r\nrepresent one hundred years, and the entire strip a million years. But\r\nlet it be borne in mind, in relation to the subject of this work, what\r\na hundred years implies, represented as it is by a measure utterly\r\ninsignificant in a hall of the above dimensions. Several eminent\r\nbreeders, during a single lifetime, have so largely modified some of\r\nthe higher animals, which propagate their kind much more slowly than\r\nmost of the lower animals, that they have formed what well deserves to\r\nbe called a new sub-breed. Few men have attended with due care to any\r\none strain for more than half a century, so that a hundred years\r\nrepresents the work of two breeders in succession. It is not to be\r\nsupposed that species in a state of nature ever change so quickly as\r\ndomestic animals under the guidance of methodical selection. The\r\ncomparison would be in every way fairer with the effects which follow\r\nfrom unconscious selection, that is, the preservation of the most\r\nuseful or beautiful animals, with no intention of modifying the breed;\r\nbut by this process of unconscious selection, various breeds have been\r\nsensibly changed in the course of two or three centuries.\r\n\r\nSpecies, however, probably change much more slowly, and within the same\r\ncountry only a few change at the same time. This slowness follows from\r\nall the inhabitants of the same country being already so well adapted\r\nto each other, that new places in the polity of nature do not occur\r\nuntil after long intervals, due to the occurrence of physical changes\r\nof some kind, or through the immigration of new forms. Moreover,\r\nvariations or individual differences of the right nature, by which some\r\nof the inhabitants might be better fitted to their new places under the\r\naltered circumstance, would not always occur at once. Unfortunately we\r\nhave no means of determining, according to the standard of years, how\r\nlong a period it takes to modify a species; but to the subject of time\r\nwe must return.\r\n\r\n_On the Poorness of Palæontological Collections._\r\n\r\n\r\nNow let us turn to our richest museums, and what a paltry display we\r\nbehold! That our collections are imperfect is admitted by every one.\r\nThe remark of that admirable palæontologist, Edward Forbes, should\r\nnever be forgotten, namely, that very many fossil species are known and\r\nnamed from single and often broken specimens, or from a few specimens\r\ncollected on some one spot. Only a small portion of the surface of the\r\nearth has been geologically explored, and no part with sufficient care,\r\nas the important discoveries made every year in Europe prove. No\r\norganism wholly soft can be preserved. Shells and bones decay and\r\ndisappear when left on the bottom of the sea, where sediment is not\r\naccumulating. We probably take a quite erroneous view, when we assume\r\nthat sediment is being deposited over nearly the whole bed of the sea,\r\nat a rate sufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil remains.\r\nThroughout an enormously large proportion of the ocean, the bright blue\r\ntint of the water bespeaks its purity. The many cases on record of a\r\nformation conformably covered, after an immense interval of time, by\r\nanother and later formation, without the underlying bed having suffered\r\nin the interval any wear and tear, seem explicable only on the view of\r\nthe bottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an unaltered\r\ncondition. The remains which do become embedded, if in sand or gravel,\r\nwill, when the beds are upraised, generally be dissolved by the\r\npercolation of rain water charged with carbonic acid. Some of the many\r\nkinds of animals which live on the beach between high and low water\r\nmark seem to be rarely preserved. For instance, the several species of\r\nthe Chthamalinæ (a sub-family of sessile cirripedes) coat the rocks all\r\nover the world in infinite numbers: they are all strictly littoral,\r\nwith the exception of a single Mediterranean species, which inhabits\r\ndeep water and this has been found fossil in Sicily, whereas not one\r\nother species has hitherto been found in any tertiary formation: yet it\r\nis known that the genus Chthamalus existed during the Chalk period.\r\nLastly, many great deposits, requiring a vast length of time for their\r\naccumulation, are entirely destitute of organic remains, without our\r\nbeing able to assign any reason: one of the most striking instances is\r\nthat of the Flysch formation, which consists of shale and sandstone,\r\nseveral thousand, occasionally even six thousand feet in thickness, and\r\nextending for at least 300 miles from Vienna to Switzerland; and\r\nalthough this great mass has been most carefully searched, no fossils,\r\nexcept a few vegetable remains, have been found.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the terrestrial productions which lived during the\r\nSecondary and Palæozoic periods, it is superfluous to state that our\r\nevidence is fragmentary in an extreme degree. For instance, until\r\nrecently not a land-shell was known belonging to either of these vast\r\nperiods, with the exception of one species discovered by Sir C. Lyell\r\nand Dr. Dawson in the carboniferous strata of North America; but now\r\nland-shells have been found in the lias. In regard to mammiferous\r\nremains, a glance at the historical table published in Lyell’s Manual,\r\nwill bring home the truth, how accidental and rare is their\r\npreservation, far better than pages of detail. Nor is their rarity\r\nsurprising, when we remember how large a proportion of the bones of\r\ntertiary mammals have been discovered either in caves or in lacustrine\r\ndeposits; and that not a cave or true lacustrine bed is known belonging\r\nto the age of our secondary or palæozoic formations.\r\n\r\nBut the imperfection in the geological record largely results from\r\nanother and more important cause than any of the foregoing; namely,\r\nfrom the several formations being separated from each other by wide\r\nintervals of time. This doctrine has been emphatically admitted by many\r\ngeologists and palæontologists, who, like E. Forbes, entirely\r\ndisbelieve in the change of species. When we see the formations\r\ntabulated in written works, or when we follow them in nature, it is\r\ndifficult to avoid believing that they are closely consecutive. But we\r\nknow, for instance, from Sir R. Murchison’s great work on Russia, what\r\nwide gaps there are in that country between the superimposed\r\nformations; so it is in North America, and in many other parts of the\r\nworld. The most skilful geologist, if his attention had been confined\r\nexclusively to these large territories, would never have suspected that\r\nduring the periods which were blank and barren in his own country,\r\ngreat piles of sediment, charged with new and peculiar forms of life,\r\nhad elsewhere been accumulated. And if, in every separate territory,\r\nhardly any idea can be formed of the length of time which has elapsed\r\nbetween the consecutive formations, we may infer that this could\r\nnowhere be ascertained. The frequent and great changes in the\r\nmineralogical composition of consecutive formations, generally implying\r\ngreat changes in the geography of the surrounding lands, whence the\r\nsediment was derived, accord with the belief of vast intervals of time\r\nhaving elapsed between each formation.\r\n\r\nWe can, I think, see why the geological formations of each region are\r\nalmost invariably intermittent; that is, have not followed each other\r\nin close sequence. Scarcely any fact struck me more when examining many\r\nhundred miles of the South American coasts, which have been upraised\r\nseveral hundred feet within the recent period, than the absence of any\r\nrecent deposits sufficiently extensive to last for even a short\r\ngeological period. Along the whole west coast, which is inhabited by a\r\npeculiar marine fauna, tertiary beds are so poorly developed that no\r\nrecord of several successive and peculiar marine faunas will probably\r\nbe preserved to a distant age. A little reflection will explain why,\r\nalong the rising coast of the western side of South America, no\r\nextensive formations with recent or tertiary remains can anywhere be\r\nfound, though the supply of sediment must for ages have been great,\r\nfrom the enormous degradation of the coast rocks and from the muddy\r\nstreams entering the sea. The explanation, no doubt, is that the\r\nlittoral and sub-littoral deposits are continually worn away, as soon\r\nas they are brought up by the slow and gradual rising of the land\r\nwithin the grinding action of the coast-waves.\r\n\r\nWe may, I think, conclude that sediment must be accumulated in\r\nextremely thick, solid, or extensive masses, in order to withstand the\r\nincessant action of the waves, when first upraised and during\r\nsubsequent oscillations of level, as well as the subsequent subaërial\r\ndegradation. Such thick and extensive accumulations of sediment may be\r\nformed in two ways; either in profound depths of the sea, in which case\r\nthe bottom will not be inhabited by so many and such varied forms of\r\nlife as the more shallow seas; and the mass when upraised will give an\r\nimperfect record of the organisms which existed in the neighbourhood\r\nduring the period of its accumulation. Or sediment may be deposited to\r\nany thickness and extent over a shallow bottom, if it continue slowly\r\nto subside. In this latter case, as long as the rate of subsidence and\r\nsupply of sediment nearly balance each other, the sea will remain\r\nshallow and favourable for many and varied forms, and thus a rich\r\nfossiliferous formation, thick enough, when upraised, to resist a large\r\namount of denudation, may be formed.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that nearly all our ancient formations, which are\r\nthroughout the greater part of their thickness _rich in fossils_, have\r\nthus been formed during subsidence. Since publishing my views on this\r\nsubject in 1845, I have watched the progress of geology, and have been\r\nsurprised to note how author after author, in treating of this or that\r\ngreat formation, has come to the conclusion that it was accumulated\r\nduring subsidence. I may add, that the only ancient tertiary formation\r\non the west coast of South America, which has been bulky enough to\r\nresist such degradation as it has as yet suffered, but which will\r\nhardly last to a distant geological age, was deposited during a\r\ndownward oscillation of level, and thus gained considerable thickness.\r\n\r\nAll geological facts tell us plainly that each area has undergone\r\nnumerous slow oscillations of level, and apparently these oscillations\r\nhave affected wide spaces. Consequently, formations rich in fossils and\r\nsufficiently thick and extensive to resist subsequent degradation, will\r\nhave been formed over wide spaces during periods of subsidence, but\r\nonly where the supply of sediment was sufficient to keep the sea\r\nshallow and to embed and preserve the remains before they had time to\r\ndecay. On the other hand, as long as the bed of the sea remained\r\nstationary, _thick_ deposits cannot have been accumulated in the\r\nshallow parts, which are the most favourable to life. Still less can\r\nthis have happened during the alternate periods of elevation; or, to\r\nspeak more accurately, the beds which were then accumulated will\r\ngenerally have been destroyed by being upraised and brought within the\r\nlimits of the coast-action.\r\n\r\nThese remarks apply chiefly to littoral and sublittoral deposits. In\r\nthe case of an extensive and shallow sea, such as that within a large\r\npart of the Malay Archipelago, where the depth varies from thirty or\r\nforty to sixty fathoms, a widely extended formation might be formed\r\nduring a period of elevation, and yet not suffer excessively from\r\ndenudation during its slow upheaval; but the thickness of the formation\r\ncould not be great, for owing to the elevatory movement it would be\r\nless than the depth in which it was formed; nor would the deposit be\r\nmuch consolidated, nor be capped by overlying formations, so that it\r\nwould run a good chance of being worn away by atmospheric degradation\r\nand by the action of the sea during subsequent oscillations of level.\r\nIt has, however, been suggested by Mr. Hopkins, that if one part of the\r\narea, after rising and before being denuded, subsided, the deposit\r\nformed during the rising movement, though not thick, might afterwards\r\nbecome protected by fresh accumulations, and thus be preserved for a\r\nlong period.\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins also expresses his belief that sedimentary beds of\r\nconsiderable horizontal extent have rarely been completely destroyed.\r\nBut all geologists, excepting the few who believe that our present\r\nmetamorphic schists and plutonic rocks once formed the primordial\r\nnucleus of the globe, will admit that these latter rocks have been\r\nstripped of their covering to an enormous extent. For it is scarcely\r\npossible that such rocks could have been solidified and crystallised\r\nwhile uncovered; but if the metamorphic action occurred at profound\r\ndepths of the ocean, the former protecting mantle of rock may not have\r\nbeen very thick. Admitting then that gneiss, mica-schist, granite,\r\ndiorite, &c., were once necessarily covered up, how can we account for\r\nthe naked and extensive areas of such rocks in many parts of the world,\r\nexcept on the belief that they have subsequently been completely\r\ndenuded of all overlying strata? That such extensive areas do exist\r\ncannot be doubted: the granitic region of Parime is described by\r\nHumboldt as being at least nineteen times as large as Switzerland.\r\nSouth of the Amazon, Boue colours an area composed of rocks of this\r\nnature as equal to that of Spain, France, Italy, part of Germany, and\r\nthe British Islands, all conjoined. This region has not been carefully\r\nexplored, but from the concurrent testimony of travellers, the granitic\r\narea is very large: thus Von Eschwege gives a detailed section of these\r\nrocks, stretching from Rio de Janeiro for 260 geographical miles inland\r\nin a straight line; and I travelled for 150 miles in another direction,\r\nand saw nothing but granitic rocks. Numerous specimens, collected along\r\nthe whole coast, from near Rio de Janeiro to the mouth of the Plata, a\r\ndistance of 1,100 geographical miles, were examined by me, and they all\r\nbelonged to this class. Inland, along the whole northern bank of the\r\nPlata, I saw, besides modern tertiary beds, only one small patch of\r\nslightly metamorphosed rock, which alone could have formed a part of\r\nthe original capping of the granitic series. Turning to a well-known\r\nregion, namely, to the United States and Canada, as shown in Professor\r\nH.D. Rogers’ beautiful map, I have estimated the areas by cutting out\r\nand weighing the paper, and I find that the metamorphic (excluding the\r\n“semi-metamorphic”) and granite rocks exceed, in the proportion of 19\r\nto 12.5, the whole of the newer Palæozoic formations. In many regions\r\nthe metamorphic and granite rocks would be found much more widely\r\nextended than they appear to be, if all the sedimentary beds were\r\nremoved which rest unconformably on them, and which could not have\r\nformed part of the original mantle under which they were crystallised.\r\nHence, it is probable that in some parts of the world whole formations\r\nhave been completely denuded, with not a wreck left behind.\r\n\r\nOne remark is here worth a passing notice. During periods of elevation\r\nthe area of the land and of the adjoining shoal parts of the sea will\r\nbe increased and new stations will often be formed—all circumstances\r\nfavourable, as previously explained, for the formation of new varieties\r\nand species; but during such periods there will generally be a blank in\r\nthe geological record. On the other hand, during subsidence, the\r\ninhabited area and number of inhabitants will decrease (excepting on\r\nthe shores of a continent when first broken up into an archipelago),\r\nand consequently during subsidence, though there will be much\r\nextinction, few new varieties or species will be formed; and it is\r\nduring these very periods of subsidence that the deposits which are\r\nrichest in fossils have been accumulated.\r\n\r\n_On the Absence of Numerous Intermediate Varieties in any Single\r\nFormation._\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom these several considerations it cannot be doubted that the\r\ngeological record, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect; but if we\r\nconfine our attention to any one formation, it becomes much more\r\ndifficult to understand why we do not therein find closely graduated\r\nvarieties between the allied species which lived at its commencement\r\nand at its close. Several cases are on record of the same species\r\npresenting varieties in the upper and lower parts of the same\r\nformation. Thus Trautschold gives a number of instances with Ammonites,\r\nand Hilgendorf has described a most curious case of ten graduated forms\r\nof Planorbis multiformis in the successive beds of a fresh-water\r\nformation in Switzerland. Although each formation has indisputably\r\nrequired a vast number of years for its deposition, several reasons can\r\nbe given why each should not commonly include a graduated series of\r\nlinks between the species which lived at its commencement and close,\r\nbut I cannot assign due proportional weight to the following\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nAlthough each formation may mark a very long lapse of years, each\r\nprobably is short compared with the period requisite to change one\r\nspecies into another. I am aware that two palæontologists, whose\r\nopinions are worthy of much deference, namely Bronn and Woodward, have\r\nconcluded that the average duration of each formation is twice or\r\nthrice as long as the average duration of specific forms. But\r\ninsuperable difficulties, as it seems to me, prevent us from coming to\r\nany just conclusion on this head. When we see a species first appearing\r\nin the middle of any formation, it would be rash in the extreme to\r\ninfer that it had not elsewhere previously existed. So again, when we\r\nfind a species disappearing before the last layers have been deposited,\r\nit would be equally rash to suppose that it then became extinct. We\r\nforget how small the area of Europe is compared with the rest of the\r\nworld; nor have the several stages of the same formation throughout\r\nEurope been correlated with perfect accuracy.\r\n\r\nWe may safely infer that with marine animals of all kinds there has\r\nbeen a large amount of migration due to climatal and other changes; and\r\nwhen we see a species first appearing in any formation, the probability\r\nis that it only then first immigrated into that area. It is well known,\r\nfor instance, that several species appear somewhat earlier in the\r\npalæozoic beds of North America than in those of Europe; time having\r\napparently been required for their migration from the American to the\r\nEuropean seas. In examining the latest deposits, in various quarters of\r\nthe world, it has everywhere been noted, that some few still existing\r\nspecies are common in the deposit, but have become extinct in the\r\nimmediately surrounding sea; or, conversely, that some are now abundant\r\nin the neighbouring sea, but are rare or absent in this particular\r\ndeposit. It is an excellent lesson to reflect on the ascertained amount\r\nof migration of the inhabitants of Europe during the glacial epoch,\r\nwhich forms only a part of one whole geological period; and likewise to\r\nreflect on the changes of level, on the extreme change of climate, and\r\non the great lapse of time, all included within this same glacial\r\nperiod. Yet it may be doubted whether, in any quarter of the world,\r\nsedimentary deposits, _including fossil remains_, have gone on\r\naccumulating within the same area during the whole of this period. It\r\nis not, for instance, probable that sediment was deposited during the\r\nwhole of the glacial period near the mouth of the Mississippi, within\r\nthat limit of depth at which marine animals can best flourish: for we\r\nknow that great geographical changes occurred in other parts of America\r\nduring this space of time. When such beds as were deposited in shallow\r\nwater near the mouth of the Mississippi during some part of the glacial\r\nperiod shall have been upraised, organic remains will probably first\r\nappear and disappear at different levels, owing to the migrations of\r\nspecies and to geographical changes. And in the distant future, a\r\ngeologist, examining these beds, would be tempted to conclude that the\r\naverage duration of life of the embedded fossils had been less than\r\nthat of the glacial period, instead of having been really far greater,\r\nthat is, extending from before the glacial epoch to the present day.\r\n\r\nIn order to get a perfect gradation between two forms in the upper and\r\nlower parts of the same formation, the deposit must have gone on\r\ncontinuously accumulating during a long period, sufficient for the slow\r\nprocess of modification; hence, the deposit must be a very thick one;\r\nand the species undergoing change must have lived in the same district\r\nthroughout the whole time. But we have seen that a thick formation,\r\nfossiliferous throughout its entire thickness, can accumulate only\r\nduring a period of subsidence; and to keep the depth approximately the\r\nsame, which is necessary that the same marine species may live on the\r\nsame space, the supply of sediment must nearly counterbalance the\r\namount of subsidence. But this same movement of subsidence will tend to\r\nsubmerge the area whence the sediment is derived, and thus diminish the\r\nsupply, whilst the downward movement continues. In fact, this nearly\r\nexact balancing between the supply of sediment and the amount of\r\nsubsidence is probably a rare contingency; for it has been observed by\r\nmore than one palæontologist that very thick deposits are usually\r\nbarren of organic remains, except near their upper or lower limits.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that each separate formation, like the whole pile of\r\nformations in any country, has generally been intermittent in its\r\naccumulation. When we see, as is so often the case, a formation\r\ncomposed of beds of widely different mineralogical composition, we may\r\nreasonably suspect that the process of deposition has been more or less\r\ninterrupted. Nor will the closest inspection of a formation give us any\r\nidea of the length of time which its deposition may have consumed. Many\r\ninstances could be given of beds, only a few feet in thickness,\r\nrepresenting formations which are elsewhere thousands of feet in\r\nthickness, and which must have required an enormous period for their\r\naccumulation; yet no one ignorant of this fact would have even\r\nsuspected the vast lapse of time represented by the thinner formation.\r\nMany cases could be given of the lower beds of a formation having been\r\nupraised, denuded, submerged, and then re-covered by the upper beds of\r\nthe same formation—facts, showing what wide, yet easily overlooked,\r\nintervals have occurred in its accumulation. In other cases we have the\r\nplainest evidence in great fossilised trees, still standing upright as\r\nthey grew, of many long intervals of time and changes of level during\r\nthe process of deposition, which would not have been suspected, had not\r\nthe trees been preserved: thus Sir C. Lyell and Dr. Dawson found\r\ncarboniferous beds 1,400 feet thick in Nova Scotia, with ancient\r\nroot-bearing strata, one above the other, at no less than sixty-eight\r\ndifferent levels. Hence, when the same species occurs at the bottom,\r\nmiddle, and top of a formation, the probability is that it has not\r\nlived on the same spot during the whole period of deposition, but has\r\ndisappeared and reappeared, perhaps many times, during the same\r\ngeological period. Consequently if it were to undergo a considerable\r\namount of modification during the deposition of any one geological\r\nformation, a section would not include all the fine intermediate\r\ngradations which must on our theory have existed, but abrupt, though\r\nperhaps slight, changes of form.\r\n\r\nIt is all-important to remember that naturalists have no golden rule by\r\nwhich to distinguish species and varieties; they grant some little\r\nvariability to each species, but when they meet with a somewhat greater\r\namount of difference between any two forms, they rank both as species,\r\nunless they are enabled to connect them together by the closest\r\nintermediate gradations; and this, from the reasons just assigned, we\r\ncan seldom hope to effect in any one geological section. Supposing B\r\nand C to be two species, and a third, A, to be found in an older and\r\nunderlying bed; even if A were strictly intermediate between B and C,\r\nit would simply be ranked as a third and distinct species, unless at\r\nthe same time it could be closely connected by intermediate varieties\r\nwith either one or both forms. Nor should it be forgotten, as before\r\nexplained, that A might be the actual progenitor of B and C, and yet\r\nwould not necessarily be strictly intermediate between them in all\r\nrespects. So that we might obtain the parent-species and its several\r\nmodified descendants from the lower and upper beds of the same\r\nformation, and unless we obtained numerous transitional gradations, we\r\nshould not recognise their blood-relationship, and should consequently\r\nrank them as distinct species.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious on what excessively slight differences many\r\npalæontologists have founded their species; and they do this the more\r\nreadily if the specimens come from different sub-stages of the same\r\nformation. Some experienced conchologists are now sinking many of the\r\nvery fine species of D’Orbigny and others into the rank of varieties;\r\nand on this view we do find the kind of evidence of change which on the\r\ntheory we ought to find. Look again at the later tertiary deposits,\r\nwhich include many shells believed by the majority of naturalists to be\r\nidentical with existing species; but some excellent naturalists, as\r\nAgassiz and Pictet, maintain that all these tertiary species are\r\nspecifically distinct, though the distinction is admitted to be very\r\nslight; so that here, unless we believe that these eminent naturalists\r\nhave been misled by their imaginations, and that these late tertiary\r\nspecies really present no difference whatever from their living\r\nrepresentatives, or unless we admit, in opposition to the judgment of\r\nmost naturalists, that these tertiary species are all truly distinct\r\nfrom the recent, we have evidence of the frequent occurrence of slight\r\nmodifications of the kind required. If we look to rather wider\r\nintervals of time, namely, to distinct but consecutive stages of the\r\nsame great formation, we find that the embedded fossils, though\r\nuniversally ranked as specifically different, yet are far more closely\r\nrelated to each other than are the species found in more widely\r\nseparated formations; so that here again we have undoubted evidence of\r\nchange in the direction required by the theory; but to this latter\r\nsubject I shall return in the following chapter.\r\n\r\nWith animals and plants that propagate rapidly and do not wander much,\r\nthere is reason to suspect, as we have formerly seen, that their\r\nvarieties are generally at first local; and that such local varieties\r\ndo not spread widely and supplant their parent-form until they have\r\nbeen modified and perfected in some considerable degree. According to\r\nthis view, the chance of discovering in a formation in any one country\r\nall the early stages of transition between any two forms, is small, for\r\nthe successive changes are supposed to have been local or confined to\r\nsome one spot. Most marine animals have a wide range; and we have seen\r\nthat with plants it is those which have the widest range, that oftenest\r\npresent varieties, so that, with shells and other marine animals, it is\r\nprobable that those which had the widest range, far exceeding the\r\nlimits of the known geological formations in Europe, have oftenest\r\ngiven rise, first to local varieties and ultimately to new species; and\r\nthis again would greatly lessen the chance of our being able to trace\r\nthe stages of transition in any one geological formation.\r\n\r\nIt is a more important consideration, leading to the same result, as\r\nlately insisted on by Dr. Falconer, namely, that the period during\r\nwhich each species underwent modification, though long as measured by\r\nyears, was probably short in comparison with that during which it\r\nremained without undergoing any change.\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten, that at the present day, with perfect\r\nspecimens for examination, two forms can seldom be connected by\r\nintermediate varieties, and thus proved to be the same species, until\r\nmany specimens are collected from many places; and with fossil species\r\nthis can rarely be done. We shall, perhaps, best perceive the\r\nimprobability of our being enabled to connect species by numerous,\r\nfine, intermediate, fossil links, by asking ourselves whether, for\r\ninstance, geologists at some future period will be able to prove that\r\nour different breeds of cattle, sheep, horses, and dogs are descended\r\nfrom a single stock or from several aboriginal stocks; or, again,\r\nwhether certain sea-shells inhabiting the shores of North America,\r\nwhich are ranked by some conchologists as distinct species from their\r\nEuropean representatives, and by other conchologists as only varieties,\r\nare really varieties, or are, as it is called, specifically distinct.\r\nThis could be effected by the future geologist only by his discovering\r\nin a fossil state numerous intermediate gradations; and such success is\r\nimprobable in the highest degree.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted over and over again, by writers who believe in the\r\nimmutability of species, that geology yields no linking forms. This\r\nassertion, as we shall see in the next chapter, is certainly erroneous.\r\nAs Sir J. Lubbock has remarked, “Every species is a link between other\r\nallied forms.” If we take a genus having a score of species, recent and\r\nextinct, and destroy four-fifths of them, no one doubts that the\r\nremainder will stand much more distinct from each other. If the extreme\r\nforms in the genus happen to have been thus destroyed, the genus itself\r\nwill stand more distinct from other allied genera. What geological\r\nresearch has not revealed, is the former existence of infinitely\r\nnumerous gradations, as fine as existing varieties, connecting together\r\nnearly all existing and extinct species. But this ought not to be\r\nexpected; yet this has been repeatedly advanced as a most serious\r\nobjection against my views.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while to sum up the foregoing remarks on the causes of\r\nthe imperfection of the geological record under an imaginary\r\nillustration. The Malay Archipelago is about the size of Europe from\r\nthe North Cape to the Mediterranean, and from Britain to Russia; and\r\ntherefore equals all the geological formations which have been examined\r\nwith any accuracy, excepting those of the United States of America. I\r\nfully agree with Mr. Godwin-Austen, that the present condition of the\r\nMalay Archipelago, with its numerous large islands separated by wide\r\nand shallow seas, probably represents the former state of Europe, while\r\nmost of our formations were accumulating. The Malay Archipelago is one\r\nof the richest regions in organic beings; yet if all the species were\r\nto be collected which have ever lived there, how imperfectly would they\r\nrepresent the natural history of the world!\r\n\r\nBut we have every reason to believe that the terrestrial productions of\r\nthe archipelago would be preserved in an extremely imperfect manner in\r\nthe formations which we suppose to be there accumulating. Not many of\r\nthe strictly littoral animals, or of those which lived on naked\r\nsubmarine rocks, would be embedded; and those embedded in gravel or\r\nsand would not endure to a distant epoch. Wherever sediment did not\r\naccumulate on the bed of the sea, or where it did not accumulate at a\r\nsufficient rate to protect organic bodies from decay, no remains could\r\nbe preserved.\r\n\r\nFormations rich in fossils of many kinds, and of thickness sufficient\r\nto last to an age as distant in futurity as the secondary formations\r\nlie in the past, would generally be formed in the archipelago only\r\nduring periods of subsidence. These periods of subsidence would be\r\nseparated from each other by immense intervals of time, during which\r\nthe area would be either stationary or rising; whilst rising, the\r\nfossiliferous formations on the steeper shores would be destroyed,\r\nalmost as soon as accumulated, by the incessant coast-action, as we now\r\nsee on the shores of South America. Even throughout the extensive and\r\nshallow seas within the archipelago, sedimentary beds could hardly be\r\naccumulated of great thickness during the periods of elevation, or\r\nbecome capped and protected by subsequent deposits, so as to have a\r\ngood chance of enduring to a very distant future. During the periods of\r\nsubsidence, there would probably be much extinction of life; during the\r\nperiods of elevation, there would be much variation, but the geological\r\nrecord would then be less perfect.\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted whether the duration of any one great period of\r\nsubsidence over the whole or part of the archipelago, together with a\r\ncontemporaneous accumulation of sediment, would _exceed_ the average\r\nduration of the same specific forms; and these contingencies are\r\nindispensable for the preservation of all the transitional gradations\r\nbetween any two or more species. If such gradations were not all fully\r\npreserved, transitional varieties would merely appear as so many new,\r\nthough closely allied species. It is also probable that each great\r\nperiod of subsidence would be interrupted by oscillations of level, and\r\nthat slight climatical changes would intervene during such lengthy\r\nperiods; and in these cases the inhabitants of the archipelago would\r\nmigrate, and no closely consecutive record of their modifications could\r\nbe preserved in any one formation.\r\n\r\nVery many of the marine inhabitants of the archipelago now range\r\nthousands of miles beyond its confines; and analogy plainly leads to\r\nthe belief that it would be chiefly these far-ranging species, though\r\nonly some of them, which would oftenest produce new varieties; and the\r\nvarieties would at first be local or confined to one place, but if\r\npossessed of any decided advantage, or when further modified and\r\nimproved, they would slowly spread and supplant their parent-forms.\r\nWhen such varieties returned to their ancient homes, as they would\r\ndiffer from their former state in a nearly uniform, though perhaps\r\nextremely slight degree, and as they would be found embedded in\r\nslightly different sub-stages of the same formation, they would,\r\naccording to the principles followed by many palæontologists, be ranked\r\nas new and distinct species.\r\n\r\nIf then there be some degree of truth in these remarks, we have no\r\nright to expect to find, in our geological formations, an infinite\r\nnumber of those fine transitional forms, which, on our theory, have\r\nconnected all the past and present species of the same group into one\r\nlong and branching chain of life. We ought only to look for a few\r\nlinks, and such assuredly we do find—some more distantly, some more\r\nclosely, related to each other; and these links, let them be ever so\r\nclose, if found in different stages of the same formation, would, by\r\nmany palæontologists, be ranked as distinct species. But I do not\r\npretend that I should ever have suspected how poor was the record in\r\nthe best preserved geological sections, had not the absence of\r\ninnumerable transitional links between the species which lived at the\r\ncommencement and close of each formation, pressed so hardly on my\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n_On the sudden Appearance of whole Groups of allied Species._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe abrupt manner in which whole groups of species suddenly appear in\r\ncertain formations, has been urged by several palæontologists—for\r\ninstance, by Agassiz, Pictet, and Sedgwick, as a fatal objection to the\r\nbelief in the transmutation of species. If numerous species, belonging\r\nto the same genera or families, have really started into life at once,\r\nthe fact would be fatal to the theory of evolution through natural\r\nselection. For the development by this means of a group of forms, all\r\nof which are descended from some one progenitor, must have been an\r\nextremely slow process; and the progenitors must have lived long before\r\ntheir modified descendants. But we continually overrate the perfection\r\nof the geological record, and falsely infer, because certain genera or\r\nfamilies have not been found beneath a certain stage, that they did not\r\nexist before that stage. In all cases positive palæontological evidence\r\nmay be implicitly trusted; negative evidence is worthless, as\r\nexperience has so often shown. We continually forget how large the\r\nworld is, compared with the area over which our geological formations\r\nhave been carefully examined; we forget that groups of species may\r\nelsewhere have long existed, and have slowly multiplied, before they\r\ninvaded the ancient archipelagoes of Europe and the United States. We\r\ndo not make due allowance for the enormous intervals of time which have\r\nelapsed between our consecutive formations, longer perhaps in many\r\ncases than the time required for the accumulation of each formation.\r\nThese intervals will have given time for the multiplication of species\r\nfrom some one parent-form: and in the succeeding formation, such groups\r\nor species will appear as if suddenly created.\r\n\r\nI may here recall a remark formerly made, namely, that it might require\r\na long succession of ages to adapt an organism to some new and peculiar\r\nline of life, for instance, to fly through the air; and consequently\r\nthat the transitional forms would often long remain confined to some\r\none region; but that, when this adaptation had once been effected, and\r\na few species had thus acquired a great advantage over other organisms,\r\na comparatively short time would be necessary to produce many divergent\r\nforms, which would spread rapidly and widely throughout the world.\r\nProfessor Pictet, in his excellent Review of this work, in commenting\r\non early transitional forms, and taking birds as an illustration,\r\ncannot see how the successive modifications of the anterior limbs of a\r\nsupposed prototype could possibly have been of any advantage. But look\r\nat the penguins of the Southern Ocean; have not these birds their front\r\nlimbs in this precise intermediate state of “neither true arms nor true\r\nwings?” Yet these birds hold their place victoriously in the battle for\r\nlife; for they exist in infinite numbers and of many kinds. I do not\r\nsuppose that we here see the real transitional grades through which the\r\nwings of birds have passed; but what special difficulty is there in\r\nbelieving that it might profit the modified descendants of the penguin,\r\nfirst to become enabled to flap along the surface of the sea like the\r\nlogger-headed duck, and ultimately to rise from its surface and glide\r\nthrough the air?\r\n\r\nI will now give a few examples to illustrate the foregoing remarks, and\r\nto show how liable we are to error in supposing that whole groups of\r\nspecies have suddenly been produced. Even in so short an interval as\r\nthat between the first and second editions of Pictet’s great work on\r\nPalæontology, published in 1844-46 and in 1853-57, the conclusions on\r\nthe first appearance and disappearance of several groups of animals\r\nhave been considerably modified; and a third edition would require\r\nstill further changes. I may recall the well-known fact that in\r\ngeological treatises, published not many years ago, mammals were always\r\nspoken of as having abruptly come in at the commencement of the\r\ntertiary series. And now one of the richest known accumulations of\r\nfossil mammals belongs to the middle of the secondary series; and true\r\nmammals have been discovered in the new red sandstone at nearly the\r\ncommencement of this great series. Cuvier used to urge that no monkey\r\noccurred in any tertiary stratum; but now extinct species have been\r\ndiscovered in India, South America and in Europe, as far back as the\r\nmiocene stage. Had it not been for the rare accident of the\r\npreservation of footsteps in the new red sandstone of the United\r\nStates, who would have ventured to suppose that no less than at least\r\nthirty different bird-like animals, some of gigantic size, existed\r\nduring that period? Not a fragment of bone has been discovered in these\r\nbeds. Not long ago, palæontologists maintained that the whole class of\r\nbirds came suddenly into existence during the eocene period; but now we\r\nknow, on the authority of Professor Owen, that a bird certainly lived\r\nduring the deposition of the upper greensand; and still more recently,\r\nthat strange bird, the Archeopteryx, with a long lizard-like tail,\r\nbearing a pair of feathers on each joint, and with its wings furnished\r\nwith two free claws, has been discovered in the oolitic slates of\r\nSolenhofen. Hardly any recent discovery shows more forcibly than this\r\nhow little we as yet know of the former inhabitants of the world.\r\n\r\nI may give another instance, which, from having passed under my own\r\neyes has much struck me. In a memoir on Fossil Sessile Cirripedes, I\r\nstated that, from the large number of existing and extinct tertiary\r\nspecies; from the extraordinary abundance of the individuals of many\r\nspecies all over the world, from the Arctic regions to the equator,\r\ninhabiting various zones of depths, from the upper tidal limits to\r\nfifty fathoms; from the perfect manner in which specimens are preserved\r\nin the oldest tertiary beds; from the ease with which even a fragment\r\nof a valve can be recognised; from all these circumstances, I inferred\r\nthat, had sessile cirripedes existed during the secondary periods, they\r\nwould certainly have been preserved and discovered; and as not one\r\nspecies had then been discovered in beds of this age, I concluded that\r\nthis great group had been suddenly developed at the commencement of the\r\ntertiary series. This was a sore trouble to me, adding, as I then\r\nthought, one more instance of the abrupt appearance of a great group of\r\nspecies. But my work had hardly been published, when a skilful\r\npalæontologist, M. Bosquet, sent me a drawing of a perfect specimen of\r\nan unmistakable sessile cirripede, which he had himself extracted from\r\nthe chalk of Belgium. And, as if to make the case as striking as\r\npossible, this cirripede was a Chthamalus, a very common, large, and\r\nubiquitous genus, of which not one species has as yet been found even\r\nin any tertiary stratum. Still more recently, a Pyrgoma, a member of a\r\ndistinct subfamily of sessile cirripedes, has been discovered by Mr.\r\nWoodward in the upper chalk; so that we now have abundant evidence of\r\nthe existence of this group of animals during the secondary period.\r\n\r\nThe case most frequently insisted on by palæontologists of the\r\napparently sudden appearance of a whole group of species, is that of\r\nthe teleostean fishes, low down, according to Agassiz, in the Chalk\r\nperiod. This group includes the large majority of existing species. But\r\ncertain Jurassic and Triassic forms are now commonly admitted to be\r\nteleostean; and even some palæozoic forms have thus been classed by one\r\nhigh authority. If the teleosteans had really appeared suddenly in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere at the commencement of the chalk formation, the\r\nfact would have been highly remarkable; but it would not have formed an\r\ninsuperable difficulty, unless it could likewise have been shown that\r\nat the same period the species were suddenly and simultaneously\r\ndeveloped in other quarters of the world. It is almost superfluous to\r\nremark that hardly any fossil-fish are known from south of the equator;\r\nand by running through Pictet’s Palæontology it will be seen that very\r\nfew species are known from several formations in Europe. Some few\r\nfamilies of fish now have a confined range; the teleostean fishes might\r\nformerly have had a similarly confined range, and after having been\r\nlargely developed in some one sea, have spread widely. Nor have we any\r\nright to suppose that the seas of the world have always been so freely\r\nopen from south to north as they are at present. Even at this day, if\r\nthe Malay Archipelago were converted into land, the tropical parts of\r\nthe Indian Ocean would form a large and perfectly enclosed basin, in\r\nwhich any great group of marine animals might be multiplied; and here\r\nthey would remain confined, until some of the species became adapted to\r\na cooler climate, and were enabled to double the southern capes of\r\nAfrica or Australia, and thus reach other and distant seas.\r\n\r\nFrom these considerations, from our ignorance of the geology of other\r\ncountries beyond the confines of Europe and the United States, and from\r\nthe revolution in our palæontological knowledge effected by the\r\ndiscoveries of the last dozen years, it seems to me to be about as rash\r\nto dogmatize on the succession of organic forms throughout the world,\r\nas it would be for a naturalist to land for five minutes on a barren\r\npoint in Australia, and then to discuss the number and range of its\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\n_On the sudden Appearance of Groups of allied Species in the lowest\r\nknown Fossiliferous Strata._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another and allied difficulty, which is much more serious. I\r\nallude to the manner in which species belonging to several of the main\r\ndivisions of the animal kingdom suddenly appear in the lowest known\r\nfossiliferous rocks. Most of the arguments which have convinced me that\r\nall the existing species of the same group are descended from a single\r\nprogenitor, apply with equal force to the earliest known species. For\r\ninstance, it cannot be doubted that all the Cambrian and Silurian\r\ntrilobites are descended from some one crustacean, which must have\r\nlived long before the Cambrian age, and which probably differed greatly\r\nfrom any known animal. Some of the most ancient animals, as the\r\nNautilus, Lingula, &c., do not differ much from living species; and it\r\ncannot on our theory be supposed, that these old species were the\r\nprogenitors of all the species belonging to the same groups which have\r\nsubsequently appeared, for they are not in any degree intermediate in\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nConsequently, if the theory be true, it is indisputable that before the\r\nlowest Cambrian stratum was deposited long periods elapsed, as long as,\r\nor probably far longer than, the whole interval from the Cambrian age\r\nto the present day; and that during these vast periods the world\r\nswarmed with living creatures. Here we encounter a formidable\r\nobjection; for it seems doubtful whether the earth, in a fit state for\r\nthe habitation of living creatures, has lasted long enough. Sir W.\r\nThompson concludes that the consolidation of the crust can hardly have\r\noccurred less than twenty or more than four hundred million years ago,\r\nbut probably not less than ninety-eight or more than two hundred\r\nmillion years. These very wide limits show how doubtful the data are;\r\nand other elements may have hereafter to be introduced into the\r\nproblem. Mr. Croll estimates that about sixty million years have\r\nelapsed since the Cambrian period, but this, judging from the small\r\namount of organic change since the commencement of the Glacial epoch,\r\nappears a very short time for the many and great mutations of life,\r\nwhich have certainly occurred since the Cambrian formation; and the\r\nprevious one hundred and forty million years can hardly be considered\r\nas sufficient for the development of the varied forms of life which\r\nalready existed during the Cambrian period. It is, however, probable,\r\nas Sir William Thompson insists, that the world at a very early period\r\nwas subjected to more rapid and violent changes in its physical\r\nconditions than those now occurring; and such changes would have tended\r\nto induce changes at a corresponding rate in the organisms which then\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nTo the question why we do not find rich fossiliferous deposits\r\nbelonging to these assumed earliest periods prior to the Cambrian\r\nsystem, I can give no satisfactory answer. Several eminent geologists,\r\nwith Sir R. Murchison at their head, were until recently convinced that\r\nwe beheld in the organic remains of the lowest Silurian stratum the\r\nfirst dawn of life. Other highly competent judges, as Lyell and E.\r\nForbes, have disputed this conclusion. We should not forget that only a\r\nsmall portion of the world is known with accuracy. Not very long ago M.\r\nBarrande added another and lower stage, abounding with new and peculiar\r\nspecies, beneath the then known Silurian system; and now, still lower\r\ndown in the Lower Cambrian formation, Mr Hicks has found South Wales\r\nbeds rich in trilobites, and containing various molluscs and annelids.\r\nThe presence of phosphatic nodules and bituminous matter, even in some\r\nof the lowest azotic rocks, probably indicates life at these periods;\r\nand the existence of the Eozoon in the Laurentian formation of Canada\r\nis generally admitted. There are three great series of strata beneath\r\nthe Silurian system in Canada, in the lowest of which the Eozoon is\r\nfound. Sir W. Logan states that their “united thickness may possibly\r\nfar surpass that of all the succeeding rocks, from the base of the\r\npalæozoic series to the present time. We are thus carried back to a\r\nperiod so remote, that the appearance of the so-called primordial fauna\r\n(of Barrande) may by some be considered as a comparatively modern\r\nevent.” The Eozoon belongs to the most lowly organised of all classes\r\nof animals, but is highly organised for its class; it existed in\r\ncountless numbers, and, as Dr. Dawson has remarked, certainly preyed on\r\nother minute organic beings, which must have lived in great numbers.\r\nThus the words, which I wrote in 1859, about the existence of living\r\nbeings long before the Cambrian period, and which are almost the same\r\nwith those since used by Sir W. Logan, have proved true. Nevertheless,\r\nthe difficulty of assigning any good reason for the absence of vast\r\npiles of strata rich in fossils beneath the Cambrian system is very\r\ngreat. It does not seem probable that the most ancient beds have been\r\nquite worn away by denudation, or that their fossils have been wholly\r\nobliterated by metamorphic action, for if this had been the case we\r\nshould have found only small remnants of the formations next succeeding\r\nthem in age, and these would always have existed in a partially\r\nmetamorphosed condition. But the descriptions which we possess of the\r\nSilurian deposits over immense territories in Russia and in North\r\nAmerica, do not support the view that the older a formation is the more\r\ninvariably it has suffered extreme denudation and metamorphism.\r\n\r\nThe case at present must remain inexplicable; and may be truly urged as\r\na valid argument against the views here entertained. To show that it\r\nmay hereafter receive some explanation, I will give the following\r\nhypothesis. From the nature of the organic remains which do not appear\r\nto have inhabited profound depths, in the several formations of Europe\r\nand of the United States; and from the amount of sediment, miles in\r\nthickness, of which the formations are composed, we may infer that from\r\nfirst to last large islands or tracts of land, whence the sediment was\r\nderived, occurred in the neighbourhood of the now existing continents\r\nof Europe and North America. This same view has since been maintained\r\nby Agassiz and others. But we do not know what was the state of things\r\nin the intervals between the several successive formations; whether\r\nEurope and the United States during these intervals existed as dry\r\nland, or as a submarine surface near land, on which sediment was not\r\ndeposited, or as the bed of an open and unfathomable sea.\r\n\r\nLooking to the existing oceans, which are thrice as extensive as the\r\nland, we see them studded with many islands; but hardly one truly\r\noceanic island (with the exception of New Zealand, if this can be\r\ncalled a truly oceanic island) is as yet known to afford even a remnant\r\nof any palæozoic or secondary formation. Hence, we may perhaps infer,\r\nthat during the palæozoic and secondary periods, neither continents nor\r\ncontinental islands existed where our oceans now extend; for had they\r\nexisted, palæozoic and secondary formations would in all probability\r\nhave been accumulated from sediment derived from their wear and tear;\r\nand would have been at least partially upheaved by the oscillations of\r\nlevel, which must have intervened during these enormously long periods.\r\nIf, then, we may infer anything from these facts, we may infer that,\r\nwhere our oceans now extend, oceans have extended from the remotest\r\nperiod of which we have any record; and on the other hand, that where\r\ncontinents now exist, large tracts of land have existed, subjected, no\r\ndoubt, to great oscillations of level, since the Cambrian period. The\r\ncoloured map appended to my volume on Coral Reefs, led me to conclude\r\nthat the great oceans are still mainly areas of subsidence, the great\r\narchipelagoes still areas of oscillations of level, and the continents\r\nareas of elevation. But we have no reason to assume that things have\r\nthus remained from the beginning of the world. Our continents seem to\r\nhave been formed by a preponderance, during many oscillations of level,\r\nof the force of elevation. But may not the areas of preponderant\r\nmovement have changed in the lapse of ages? At a period long antecedent\r\nto the Cambrian epoch, continents may have existed where oceans are now\r\nspread out, and clear and open oceans may have existed where our\r\ncontinents now stand. Nor should we be justified in assuming that if,\r\nfor instance, the bed of the Pacific Ocean were now converted into a\r\ncontinent we should there find sedimentary formations, in recognisable\r\ncondition, older than the Cambrian strata, supposing such to have been\r\nformerly deposited; for it might well happen that strata which had\r\nsubsided some miles nearer to the centre of the earth, and which had\r\nbeen pressed on by an enormous weight of superincumbent water, might\r\nhave undergone far more metamorphic action than strata which have\r\nalways remained nearer to the surface. The immense areas in some parts\r\nof the world, for instance in South America, of naked metamorphic\r\nrocks, which must have been heated under great pressure, have always\r\nseemed to me to require some special explanation; and we may perhaps\r\nbelieve that we see in these large areas the many formations long\r\nanterior to the Cambrian epoch in a completely metamorphosed and\r\ndenuded condition.\r\n\r\nThe several difficulties here discussed, namely, that, though we find\r\nin our geological formations many links between the species which now\r\nexist and which formerly existed, we do not find infinitely numerous\r\nfine transitional forms closely joining them all together. The sudden\r\nmanner in which several groups of species first appear in our European\r\nformations, the almost entire absence, as at present known, of\r\nformations rich in fossils beneath the Cambrian strata, are all\r\nundoubtedly of the most serious nature. We see this in the fact that\r\nthe most eminent palæontologists, namely, Cuvier, Agassiz, Barrande,\r\nPictet, Falconer, E. Forbes, &c., and all our greatest geologists, as\r\nLyell, Murchison, Sedgwick, &c., have unanimously, often vehemently,\r\nmaintained the immutability of species. But Sir Charles Lyell now gives\r\nthe support of his high authority to the opposite side, and most\r\ngeologists and palæontologists are much shaken in their former belief.\r\nThose who believe that the geological record is in any degree perfect,\r\nwill undoubtedly at once reject my theory. For my part, following out\r\nLyell’s metaphor, I look at the geological record as a history of the\r\nworld imperfectly kept and written in a changing dialect. Of this\r\nhistory we possess the last volume alone, relating only to two or three\r\ncountries. Of this volume, only here and there a short chapter has been\r\npreserved, and of each page, only here and there a few lines. Each word\r\nof the slowly-changing language, more or less different in the\r\nsuccessive chapters, may represent the forms of life, which are\r\nentombed in our consecutive formations, and which falsely appear to\r\nhave been abruptly introduced. On this view the difficulties above\r\ndiscussed are greatly diminished or even disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nON THE GEOLOGICAL SUCCESSION OF ORGANIC BEINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the slow and successive appearance of new species—On their different\r\nrates of change—Species once lost do not reappear—Groups of species\r\nfollow the same general rules in their appearance and disappearance as\r\ndo single species—On extinction—On simultaneous changes in the forms of\r\nlife throughout the world—On the affinities of extinct species to each\r\nother and to living species—On the state of development of ancient\r\nforms—On the succession of the same types within the same areas—Summary\r\nof preceding and present chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now see whether the several facts and laws relating to the\r\ngeological succession of organic beings accord best with the common\r\nview of the immutability of species, or with that of their slow and\r\ngradual modification, through variation and natural selection.\r\n\r\nNew species have appeared very slowly, one after another, both on the\r\nland and in the waters. Lyell has shown that it is hardly possible to\r\nresist the evidence on this head in the case of the several tertiary\r\nstages; and every year tends to fill up the blanks between the stages,\r\nand to make the proportion between the lost and existing forms more\r\ngradual. In some of the most recent beds, though undoubtedly of high\r\nantiquity if measured by years, only one or two species are extinct,\r\nand only one or two are new, having appeared there for the first time,\r\neither locally, or, as far as we know, on the face of the earth. The\r\nsecondary formations are more broken; but, as Bronn has remarked,\r\nneither the appearance nor disappearance of the many species embedded\r\nin each formation has been simultaneous.\r\n\r\nSpecies belonging to different genera and classes have not changed at\r\nthe same rate, or in the same degree. In the older tertiary beds a few\r\nliving shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct\r\nforms. Falconer has given a striking instance of a similar fact, for an\r\nexisting crocodile is associated with many lost mammals and reptiles in\r\nthe sub-Himalayan deposits. The Silurian Lingula differs but little\r\nfrom the living species of this genus; whereas most of the other\r\nSilurian Molluscs and all the Crustaceans have changed greatly. The\r\nproductions of the land seem to have changed at a quicker rate than\r\nthose of the sea, of which a striking instance has been observed in\r\nSwitzerland. There is some reason to believe that organisms high in the\r\nscale, change more quickly than those that are low: though there are\r\nexceptions to this rule. The amount of organic change, as Pictet has\r\nremarked, is not the same in each successive so-called formation. Yet\r\nif we compare any but the most closely related formations, all the\r\nspecies will be found to have undergone some change. When a species has\r\nonce disappeared from the face of the earth, we have no reason to\r\nbelieve that the same identical form ever reappears. The strongest\r\napparent exception to this latter rule is that of the so-called\r\n“colonies” of M. Barrande, which intrude for a period in the midst of\r\nan older formation, and then allow the pre-existing fauna to reappear;\r\nbut Lyell’s explanation, namely, that it is a case of temporary\r\nmigration from a distinct geographical province, seems satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThese several facts accord well with our theory, which includes no\r\nfixed law of development, causing all the inhabitants of an area to\r\nchange abruptly, or simultaneously, or to an equal degree. The process\r\nof modification must be slow, and will generally affect only a few\r\nspecies at the same time; for the variability of each species is\r\nindependent of that of all others. Whether such variations or\r\nindividual differences as may arise will be accumulated through natural\r\nselection in a greater or less degree, thus causing a greater or less\r\namount of permanent modification, will depend on many complex\r\ncontingencies—on the variations being of a beneficial nature, on the\r\nfreedom of intercrossing, on the slowly changing physical conditions of\r\nthe country, on the immigration of new colonists, and on the nature of\r\nthe other inhabitants with which the varying species come into\r\ncompetition. Hence it is by no means surprising that one species should\r\nretain the same identical form much longer than others; or, if\r\nchanging, should change in a less degree. We find similar relations\r\nbetween the existing inhabitants of distinct countries; for instance,\r\nthe land-shells and coleopterous insects of Madeira have come to differ\r\nconsiderably from their nearest allies on the continent of Europe,\r\nwhereas the marine shells and birds have remained unaltered. We can\r\nperhaps understand the apparently quicker rate of change in terrestrial\r\nand in more highly organised productions compared with marine and lower\r\nproductions, by the more complex relations of the higher beings to\r\ntheir organic and inorganic conditions of life, as explained in a\r\nformer chapter. When many of the inhabitants of any area have become\r\nmodified and improved, we can understand, on the principle of\r\ncompetition, and from the all-important relations of organism to\r\norganism in the struggle for life, that any form which did not become\r\nin some degree modified and improved, would be liable to extermination.\r\nHence, we see why all the species in the same region do at last, if we\r\nlook to long enough intervals of time, become modified; for otherwise\r\nthey would become extinct.\r\n\r\nIn members of the same class the average amount of change, during long\r\nand equal periods of time, may, perhaps, be nearly the same; but as the\r\naccumulation of enduring formations, rich in fossils, depends on great\r\nmasses of sediment being deposited on subsiding areas, our formations\r\nhave been almost necessarily accumulated at wide and irregularly\r\nintermittent intervals of time; consequently the amount of organic\r\nchange exhibited by the fossils embedded in consecutive formations is\r\nnot equal. Each formation, on this view, does not mark a new and\r\ncomplete act of creation, but only an occasional scene, taken almost at\r\nhazard, in an ever slowly changing drama.\r\n\r\nWe can clearly understand why a species when once lost should never\r\nreappear, even if the very same conditions of life, organic and\r\ninorganic, should recur. For though the offspring of one species might\r\nbe adapted (and no doubt this has occurred in innumerable instances) to\r\nfill the place of another species in the economy of nature, and thus\r\nsupplant it; yet the two forms—the old and the new—would not be\r\nidentically the same; for both would almost certainly inherit different\r\ncharacters from their distinct progenitors; and organisms already\r\ndiffering would vary in a different manner. For instance, it is\r\npossible, if all our fantail-pigeons were destroyed, that fanciers\r\nmight make a new breed hardly distinguishable from the present breed;\r\nbut if the parent rock-pigeon were likewise destroyed, and under nature\r\nwe have every reason to believe that parent forms are generally\r\nsupplanted and exterminated by their improved offspring, it is\r\nincredible that a fantail, identical with the existing breed, could be\r\nraised from any other species of pigeon, or even from any other well\r\nestablished race of the domestic pigeon, for the successive variations\r\nwould almost certainly be in some degree different, and the\r\nnewly-formed variety would probably inherit from its progenitor some\r\ncharacteristic differences.\r\n\r\nGroups of species, that is, genera and families, follow the same\r\ngeneral rules in their appearance and disappearance as do single\r\nspecies, changing more or less quickly, and in a greater or lesser\r\ndegree. A group, when it has once disappeared, never reappears; that\r\nis, its existence, as long as it lasts, is continuous. I am aware that\r\nthere are some apparent exceptions to this rule, but the exceptions are\r\nsurprisingly few, so few that E. Forbes, Pictet, and Woodward (though\r\nall strongly opposed to such views as I maintain) admit its truth; and\r\nthe rule strictly accords with the theory. For all the species of the\r\nsame group, however long it may have lasted, are the modified\r\ndescendants one from the other, and all from a common progenitor. In\r\nthe genus Lingula, for instance, the species which have successively\r\nappeared at all ages must have been connected by an unbroken series of\r\ngenerations, from the lowest Silurian stratum to the present day.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the last chapter that whole groups of species sometimes\r\nfalsely appear to have been abruptly developed; and I have attempted to\r\ngive an explanation of this fact, which if true would be fatal to my\r\nviews. But such cases are certainly exceptional; the general rule being\r\na gradual increase in number, until the group reaches its maximum, and\r\nthen, sooner or later, a gradual decrease. If the number of the species\r\nincluded within a genus, or the number of the genera within a family,\r\nbe represented by a vertical line of varying thickness, ascending\r\nthrough the successive geological formations, in which the species are\r\nfound, the line will sometimes falsely appear to begin at its lower\r\nend, not in a sharp point, but abruptly; it then gradually thickens\r\nupwards, often keeping of equal thickness for a space, and ultimately\r\nthins out in the upper beds, marking the decrease and final extinction\r\nof the species. This gradual increase in number of the species of a\r\ngroup is strictly conformable with the theory; for the species of the\r\nsame genus, and the genera of the same family, can increase only slowly\r\nand progressively; the process of modification and the production of a\r\nnumber of allied forms necessarily being a slow and gradual process,\r\none species first giving rise to two or three varieties, these being\r\nslowly converted into species, which in their turn produce by equally\r\nslow steps other varieties and species, and so on, like the branching\r\nof a great tree from a single stem, till the group becomes large.\r\n\r\n_On Extinction._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have as yet only spoken incidentally of the disappearance of species\r\nand of groups of species. On the theory of natural selection, the\r\nextinction of old forms and the production of new and improved forms\r\nare intimately connected together. The old notion of all the\r\ninhabitants of the earth having been swept away by catastrophes at\r\nsuccessive periods is very generally given up, even by those\r\ngeologists, as Elie de Beaumont, Murchison, Barrande, &c., whose\r\ngeneral views would naturally lead them to this conclusion. On the\r\ncontrary, we have every reason to believe, from the study of the\r\ntertiary formations, that species and groups of species gradually\r\ndisappear, one after another, first from one spot, then from another,\r\nand finally from the world. In some few cases, however, as by the\r\nbreaking of an isthmus and the consequent irruption of a multitude of\r\nnew inhabitants into an adjoining sea, or by the final subsidence of an\r\nisland, the process of extinction may have been rapid. Both single\r\nspecies and whole groups of species last for very unequal periods; some\r\ngroups, as we have seen, have endured from the earliest known dawn of\r\nlife to the present day; some have disappeared before the close of the\r\npalæozoic period. No fixed law seems to determine the length of time\r\nduring which any single species or any single genus endures. There is\r\nreason to believe that the extinction of a whole group of species is\r\ngenerally a slower process than their production: if their appearance\r\nand disappearance be represented, as before, by a vertical line of\r\nvarying thickness the line is found to taper more gradually at its\r\nupper end, which marks the progress of extermination, than at its lower\r\nend, which marks the first appearance and the early increase in number\r\nof the species. In some cases, however, the extermination of whole\r\ngroups, as of ammonites, towards the close of the secondary period, has\r\nbeen wonderfully sudden.\r\n\r\nThe extinction of species has been involved in the most gratuitous\r\nmystery. Some authors have even supposed that, as the individual has a\r\ndefinite length of life, so have species a definite duration. No one\r\ncan have marvelled more than I have done at the extinction of species.\r\nWhen I found in La Plata the tooth of a horse embedded with the remains\r\nof Mastodon, Megatherium, Toxodon and other extinct monsters, which all\r\nco-existed with still living shells at a very late geological period, I\r\nwas filled with astonishment; for, seeing that the horse, since its\r\nintroduction by the Spaniards into South America, has run wild over the\r\nwhole country and has increased in numbers at an unparalleled rate, I\r\nasked myself what could so recently have exterminated the former horse\r\nunder conditions of life apparently so favourable. But my astonishment\r\nwas groundless. Professor Owen soon perceived that the tooth, though so\r\nlike that of the existing horse, belonged to an extinct species. Had\r\nthis horse been still living, but in some degree rare, no naturalist\r\nwould have felt the least surprise at its rarity; for rarity is the\r\nattribute of a vast number of species of all classes, in all countries.\r\nIf we ask ourselves why this or that species is rare, we answer that\r\nsomething is unfavourable in its conditions of life; but what that\r\nsomething is, we can hardly ever tell. On the supposition of the fossil\r\nhorse still existing as a rare species, we might have felt certain,\r\nfrom the analogy of all other mammals, even of the slow-breeding\r\nelephant, and from the history of the naturalisation of the domestic\r\nhorse in South America, that under more favourable conditions it would\r\nin a very few years have stocked the whole continent. But we could not\r\nhave told what the unfavourable conditions were which checked its\r\nincrease, whether some one or several contingencies, and at what period\r\nof the horse’s life, and in what degree they severally acted. If the\r\nconditions had gone on, however slowly, becoming less and less\r\nfavourable, we assuredly should not have perceived the fact, yet the\r\nfossil horse would certainly have become rarer and rarer, and finally\r\nextinct—its place being seized on by some more successful competitor.\r\n\r\nIt is most difficult always to remember that the increase of every\r\nliving creature is constantly being checked by unperceived hostile\r\nagencies; and that these same unperceived agencies are amply sufficient\r\nto cause rarity, and finally extinction. So little is this subject\r\nunderstood, that I have heard surprise repeatedly expressed at such\r\ngreat monsters as the Mastodon and the more ancient Dinosaurians having\r\nbecome extinct; as if mere bodily strength gave victory in the battle\r\nof life. Mere size, on the contrary, would in some cases determine, as\r\nhas been remarked by Owen, quicker extermination, from the greater\r\namount of requisite food. Before man inhabited India or Africa, some\r\ncause must have checked the continued increase of the existing\r\nelephant. A highly capable judge, Dr. Falconer, believes that it is\r\nchiefly insects which, from incessantly harassing and weakening the\r\nelephant in India, check its increase; and this was Bruce’s conclusion\r\nwith respect to the African elephant in Abyssinia. It is certain that\r\ninsects and blood-sucking bats determine the existence of the larger\r\nnaturalised quadrupeds in several parts of South America.\r\n\r\nWe see in many cases in the more recent tertiary formations that rarity\r\nprecedes extinction; and we know that this has been the progress of\r\nevents with those animals which have been exterminated, either locally\r\nor wholly, through man’s agency. I may repeat what I published in 1845,\r\nnamely, that to admit that species generally become rare before they\r\nbecome extinct—to feel no surprise at the rarity of a species, and yet\r\nto marvel greatly when the species ceases to exist, is much the same as\r\nto admit that sickness in the individual is the forerunner of death—to\r\nfeel no surprise at sickness, but, when the sick man dies, to wonder\r\nand to suspect that he died by some deed of violence.\r\n\r\nThe theory of natural selection is grounded on the belief that each new\r\nvariety and ultimately each new species, is produced and maintained by\r\nhaving some advantage over those with which it comes into competition;\r\nand the consequent extinction of less-favoured forms almost inevitably\r\nfollows. It is the same with our domestic productions: when a new and\r\nslightly improved variety has been raised, it at first supplants the\r\nless improved varieties in the same neighbourhood; when much improved\r\nit is transported far and near, like our short-horn cattle, and takes\r\nthe place of other breeds in other countries. Thus the appearance of\r\nnew forms and the disappearance of old forms, both those naturally and\r\nartificially produced, are bound together. In flourishing groups, the\r\nnumber of new specific forms which have been produced within a given\r\ntime has at some periods probably been greater than the number of the\r\nold specific forms which have been exterminated; but we know that\r\nspecies have not gone on indefinitely increasing, at least during the\r\nlater geological epochs, so that, looking to later times, we may\r\nbelieve that the production of new forms has caused the extinction of\r\nabout the same number of old forms.\r\n\r\nThe competition will generally be most severe, as formerly explained\r\nand illustrated by examples, between the forms which are most like each\r\nother in all respects. Hence the improved and modified descendants of a\r\nspecies will generally cause the extermination of the parent-species;\r\nand if many new forms have been developed from any one species, the\r\nnearest allies of that species, _i.e._ the species of the same genus,\r\nwill be the most liable to extermination. Thus, as I believe, a number\r\nof new species descended from one species, that is a new genus, comes\r\nto supplant an old genus, belonging to the same family. But it must\r\noften have happened that a new species belonging to some one group has\r\nseized on the place occupied by a species belonging to a distinct\r\ngroup, and thus have caused its extermination. If many allied forms be\r\ndeveloped from the successful intruder, many will have to yield their\r\nplaces; and it will generally be the allied forms, which will suffer\r\nfrom some inherited inferiority in common. But whether it be species\r\nbelonging to the same or to a distinct class, which have yielded their\r\nplaces to other modified and improved species, a few of the sufferers\r\nmay often be preserved for a long time, from being fitted to some\r\npeculiar line of life, or from inhabiting some distant and isolated\r\nstation, where they will have escaped severe competition. For instance,\r\nsome species of Trigonia, a great genus of shells in the secondary\r\nformations, survive in the Australian seas; and a few members of the\r\ngreat and almost extinct group of Ganoid fishes still inhabit our fresh\r\nwaters. Therefore, the utter extinction of a group is generally, as we\r\nhave seen, a slower process than its production.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the apparently sudden extermination of whole families\r\nor orders, as of Trilobites at the close of the palæozoic period, and\r\nof Ammonites at the close of the secondary period, we must remember\r\nwhat has been already said on the probable wide intervals of time\r\nbetween our consecutive formations; and in these intervals there may\r\nhave been much slow extermination. Moreover, when, by sudden\r\nimmigration or by unusually rapid development, many species of a new\r\ngroup have taken possession of an area, many of the older species will\r\nhave been exterminated in a correspondingly rapid manner; and the forms\r\nwhich thus yield their places will commonly be allied, for they will\r\npartake of the same inferiority in common.\r\n\r\nThus, as it seems to me, the manner in which single species and whole\r\ngroups of species become extinct accords well with the theory of\r\nnatural selection. We need not marvel at extinction; if we must marvel,\r\nlet it be at our presumption in imagining for a moment that we\r\nunderstand the many complex contingencies on which the existence of\r\neach species depends. If we forget for an instant that each species\r\ntends to increase inordinately, and that some check is always in\r\naction, yet seldom perceived by us, the whole economy of nature will be\r\nutterly obscured. Whenever we can precisely say why this species is\r\nmore abundant in individuals than that; why this species and not\r\nanother can be naturalised in a given country; then, and not until\r\nthen, we may justly feel surprise why we cannot account for the\r\nextinction of any particular species or group of species.\r\n\r\n_On the Forms of Life changing almost simultaneously throughout the\r\nWorld._\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely any palæontological discovery is more striking than the fact\r\nthat the forms of life change almost simultaneously throughout the\r\nworld. Thus our European Chalk formation can be recognised in many\r\ndistant regions, under the most different climates, where not a\r\nfragment of the mineral chalk itself can be found; namely, in North\r\nAmerica, in equatorial South America, in Tierra del Fuego, at the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, and in the peninsula of India. For at these distant\r\npoints, the organic remains in certain beds present an unmistakable\r\nresemblance to those of the Chalk. It is not that the same species are\r\nmet with; for in some cases not one species is identically the same,\r\nbut they belong to the same families, genera, and sections of genera,\r\nand sometimes are similarly characterised in such trifling points as\r\nmere superficial sculpture. Moreover, other forms, which are not found\r\nin the Chalk of Europe, but which occur in the formations either above\r\nor below, occur in the same order at these distant points of the world.\r\nIn the several successive palæozoic formations of Russia, Western\r\nEurope and North America, a similar parallelism in the forms of life\r\nhas been observed by several authors; so it is, according to Lyell,\r\nwith the European and North American tertiary deposits. Even if the few\r\nfossil species which are common to the Old and New Worlds were kept\r\nwholly out of view, the general parallelism in the successive forms of\r\nlife, in the palæozoic and tertiary stages, would still be manifest,\r\nand the several formations could be easily correlated.\r\n\r\nThese observations, however, relate to the marine inhabitants of the\r\nworld: we have not sufficient data to judge whether the productions of\r\nthe land and of fresh water at distant points change in the same\r\nparallel manner. We may doubt whether they have thus changed: if the\r\nMegatherium, Mylodon, Macrauchenia, and Toxodon had been brought to\r\nEurope from La Plata, without any information in regard to their\r\ngeological position, no one would have suspected that they had\r\nco-existed with sea-shells all still living; but as these anomalous\r\nmonsters co-existed with the Mastodon and Horse, it might at least have\r\nbeen inferred that they had lived during one of the later tertiary\r\nstages.\r\n\r\nWhen the marine forms of life are spoken of as having changed\r\nsimultaneously throughout the world, it must not be supposed that this\r\nexpression relates to the same year, or even to the same century, or\r\neven that it has a very strict geological sense; for if all the marine\r\nanimals now living in Europe, and all those that lived in Europe during\r\nthe pleistocene period (a very remote period as measured by years,\r\nincluding the whole glacial epoch) were compared with those now\r\nexisting in South America or in Australia, the most skilful naturalist\r\nwould hardly be able to say whether the present or the pleistocene\r\ninhabitants of Europe resembled most closely those of the southern\r\nhemisphere. So, again, several highly competent observers maintain that\r\nthe existing productions of the United States are more closely related\r\nto those which lived in Europe during certain late tertiary stages,\r\nthan to the present inhabitants of Europe; and if this be so, it is\r\nevident that fossiliferous beds now deposited on the shores of North\r\nAmerica would hereafter be liable to be classed with somewhat older\r\nEuropean beds. Nevertheless, looking to a remotely future epoch, there\r\ncan be little doubt that all the more modern _marine_ formations,\r\nnamely, the upper pliocene, the pleistocene and strictly modern beds of\r\nEurope, North and South America, and Australia, from containing fossil\r\nremains in some degree allied, and from not including those forms which\r\nare found only in the older underlying deposits, would be correctly\r\nranked as simultaneous in a geological sense.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the forms of life changing simultaneously in the above\r\nlarge sense, at distant parts of the world, has greatly struck those\r\nadmirable observers, MM. de Verneuil and d’Archiac. After referring to\r\nthe parallelism of the palæozoic forms of life in various parts of\r\nEurope, they add, “If struck by this strange sequence, we turn our\r\nattention to North America, and there discover a series of analogous\r\nphenomena, it will appear certain that all these modifications of\r\nspecies, their extinction, and the introduction of new ones, cannot be\r\nowing to mere changes in marine currents or other causes more or less\r\nlocal and temporary, but depend on general laws which govern the whole\r\nanimal kingdom.” M. Barrande has made forcible remarks to precisely the\r\nsame effect. It is, indeed, quite futile to look to changes of\r\ncurrents, climate, or other physical conditions, as the cause of these\r\ngreat mutations in the forms of life throughout the world, under the\r\nmost different climates. We must, as Barrande has remarked, look to\r\nsome special law. We shall see this more clearly when we treat of the\r\npresent distribution of organic beings, and find how slight is the\r\nrelation between the physical conditions of various countries and the\r\nnature of their inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThis great fact of the parallel succession of the forms of life\r\nthroughout the world, is explicable on the theory of natural selection.\r\nNew species are formed by having some advantage over older forms; and\r\nthe forms, which are already dominant, or have some advantage over the\r\nother forms in their own country, give birth to the greatest number of\r\nnew varieties or incipient species. We have distinct evidence on this\r\nhead, in the plants which are dominant, that is, which are commonest\r\nand most widely diffused, producing the greatest number of new\r\nvarieties. It is also natural that the dominant, varying and\r\nfar-spreading species, which have already invaded, to a certain extent,\r\nthe territories of other species, should be those which would have the\r\nbest chance of spreading still further, and of giving rise in new\r\ncountries to other new varieties and species. The process of diffusion\r\nwould often be very slow, depending on climatal and geographical\r\nchanges, on strange accidents, and on the gradual acclimatization of\r\nnew species to the various climates through which they might have to\r\npass, but in the course of time the dominant forms would generally\r\nsucceed in spreading and would ultimately prevail. The diffusion would,\r\nit is probable, be slower with the terrestrial inhabitants of distinct\r\ncontinents than with the marine inhabitants of the continuous sea. We\r\nmight therefore expect to find, as we do find, a less strict degree of\r\nparallelism in the succession of the productions of the land than with\r\nthose of the sea.\r\n\r\nThus, as it seems to me, the parallel, and, taken in a large sense,\r\nsimultaneous, succession of the same forms of life throughout the\r\nworld, accords well with the principle of new species having been\r\nformed by dominant species spreading widely and varying; the new\r\nspecies thus produced being themselves dominant, owing to their having\r\nhad some advantage over their already dominant parents, as well as over\r\nother species; and again spreading, varying, and producing new forms.\r\nThe old forms which are beaten and which yield their places to the new\r\nand victorious forms, will generally be allied in groups, from\r\ninheriting some inferiority in common; and, therefore, as new and\r\nimproved groups spread throughout the world, old groups disappear from\r\nthe world; and the succession of forms everywhere tends to correspond\r\nboth in their first appearance and final disappearance.\r\n\r\nThere is one other remark connected with this subject worth making. I\r\nhave given my reasons for believing that most of our great formations,\r\nrich in fossils, were deposited during periods of subsidence; and that\r\nblank intervals of vast duration, as far as fossils are concerned,\r\noccurred during the periods when the bed of the sea was either\r\nstationary or rising, and likewise when sediment was not thrown down\r\nquickly enough to embed and preserve organic remains. During these long\r\nand blank intervals I suppose that the inhabitants of each region\r\nunderwent a considerable amount of modification and extinction, and\r\nthat there was much migration from other parts of the world. As we have\r\nreason to believe that large areas are affected by the same movement,\r\nit is probable that strictly contemporaneous formations have often been\r\naccumulated over very wide spaces in the same quarter of the world; but\r\nwe are very far from having any right to conclude that this has\r\ninvariably been the case, and that large areas have invariably been\r\naffected by the same movements. When two formations have been deposited\r\nin two regions during nearly, but not exactly, the same period, we\r\nshould find in both, from the causes explained in the foregoing\r\nparagraphs, the same general succession in the forms of life; but the\r\nspecies would not exactly correspond; for there will have been a little\r\nmore time in the one region than in the other for modification,\r\nextinction, and immigration.\r\n\r\nI suspect that cases of this nature occur in Europe. Mr. Prestwich, in\r\nhis admirable Memoirs on the eocene deposits of England and France, is\r\nable to draw a close general parallelism between the successive stages\r\nin the two countries; but when he compares certain stages in England\r\nwith those in France, although he finds in both a curious accordance in\r\nthe numbers of the species belonging to the same genera, yet the\r\nspecies themselves differ in a manner very difficult to account for\r\nconsidering the proximity of the two areas, unless, indeed, it be\r\nassumed that an isthmus separated two seas inhabited by distinct, but\r\ncontemporaneous faunas. Lyell has made similar observations on some of\r\nthe later tertiary formations. Barrande, also, shows that there is a\r\nstriking general parallelism in the successive Silurian deposits of\r\nBohemia and Scandinavia; nevertheless he finds a surprising amount of\r\ndifference in the species. If the several formations in these regions\r\nhave not been deposited during the same exact periods—a formation in\r\none region often corresponding with a blank interval in the other—and\r\nif in both regions the species have gone on slowly changing during the\r\naccumulation of the several formations and during the long intervals of\r\ntime between them; in this case the several formations in the two\r\nregions could be arranged in the same order, in accordance with the\r\ngeneral succession of the forms of life, and the order would falsely\r\nappear to be strictly parallel; nevertheless the species would not all\r\nbe the same in the apparently corresponding stages in the two regions.\r\n\r\n_On the Affinities of Extinct Species to each other, and to Living\r\nForms._\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now look to the mutual affinities of extinct and living species.\r\nAll fall into a few grand classes; and this fact is at once explained\r\non the principle of descent. The more ancient any form is, the more, as\r\na general rule, it differs from living forms. But, as Buckland long ago\r\nremarked, extinct species can all be classed either in still existing\r\ngroups, or between them. That the extinct forms of life help to fill up\r\nthe intervals between existing genera, families, and orders, is\r\ncertainly true; but as this statement has often been ignored or even\r\ndenied, it may be well to make some remarks on this subject, and to\r\ngive some instances. If we confine our attention either to the living\r\nor to the extinct species of the same class, the series is far less\r\nperfect than if we combine both into one general system. In the\r\nwritings of Professor Owen we continually meet with the expression of\r\ngeneralised forms, as applied to extinct animals; and in the writings\r\nof Agassiz, of prophetic or synthetic types; and these terms imply that\r\nsuch forms are, in fact, intermediate or connecting links. Another\r\ndistinguished palæontologist, M. Gaudry, has shown in the most striking\r\nmanner that many of the fossil mammals discovered by him in Attica\r\nserve to break down the intervals between existing genera. Cuvier\r\nranked the Ruminants and Pachyderms as two of the most distinct orders\r\nof mammals; but so many fossil links have been disentombed that Owen\r\nhas had to alter the whole classification, and has placed certain\r\nPachyderms in the same sub-order with ruminants; for example, he\r\ndissolves by gradations the apparently wide interval between the pig\r\nand the camel. The Ungulata or hoofed quadrupeds are now divided into\r\nthe even-toed or odd-toed divisions; but the Macrauchenia of South\r\nAmerica connects to a certain extent these two grand divisions. No one\r\nwill deny that the Hipparion is intermediate between the existing horse\r\nand certain other ungulate forms. What a wonderful connecting link in\r\nthe chain of mammals is the Typotherium from South America, as the name\r\ngiven to it by Professor Gervais expresses, and which cannot be placed\r\nin any existing order. The Sirenia form a very distinct group of the\r\nmammals, and one of the most remarkable peculiarities in existing\r\ndugong and lamentin is the entire absence of hind limbs, without even a\r\nrudiment being left; but the extinct Halitherium had, according to\r\nProfessor Flower, an ossified thigh-bone “articulated to a well-defined\r\nacetabulum in the pelvis,” and it thus makes some approach to ordinary\r\nhoofed quadrupeds, to which the Sirenia are in other respects allied.\r\nThe cetaceans or whales are widely different from all other mammals,\r\nbut the tertiary Zeuglodon and Squalodon, which have been placed by\r\nsome naturalists in an order by themselves, are considered by Professor\r\nHuxley to be undoubtedly cetaceans, “and to constitute connecting links\r\nwith the aquatic carnivora.”\r\n\r\nEven the wide interval between birds and reptiles has been shown by the\r\nnaturalist just quoted to be partially bridged over in the most\r\nunexpected manner, on the one hand, by the ostrich and extinct\r\nArcheopteryx, and on the other hand by the Compsognathus, one of the\r\nDinosaurians—that group which includes the most gigantic of all\r\nterrestrial reptiles. Turning to the Invertebrata, Barrande asserts, a\r\nhigher authority could not be named, that he is every day taught that,\r\nalthough palæozoic animals can certainly be classed under existing\r\ngroups, yet that at this ancient period the groups were not so\r\ndistinctly separated from each other as they now are.\r\n\r\nSome writers have objected to any extinct species, or group of species,\r\nbeing considered as intermediate between any two living species, or\r\ngroups of species. If by this term it is meant that an extinct form is\r\ndirectly intermediate in all its characters between two living forms or\r\ngroups, the objection is probably valid. But in a natural\r\nclassification many fossil species certainly stand between living\r\nspecies, and some extinct genera between living genera, even between\r\ngenera belonging to distinct families. The most common case, especially\r\nwith respect to very distinct groups, such as fish and reptiles, seems\r\nto be that, supposing them to be distinguished at the present day by a\r\nscore of characters, the ancient members are separated by a somewhat\r\nlesser number of characters, so that the two groups formerly made a\r\nsomewhat nearer approach to each other than they now do.\r\n\r\nIt is a common belief that the more ancient a form is, by so much the\r\nmore it tends to connect by some of its characters groups now widely\r\nseparated from each other. This remark no doubt must be restricted to\r\nthose groups which have undergone much change in the course of\r\ngeological ages; and it would be difficult to prove the truth of the\r\nproposition, for every now and then even a living animal, as the\r\nLepidosiren, is discovered having affinities directed towards very\r\ndistinct groups. Yet if we compare the older Reptiles and Batrachians,\r\nthe older Fish, the older Cephalopods, and the eocene Mammals, with the\r\nrecent members of the same classes, we must admit that there is truth\r\nin the remark.\r\n\r\nLet us see how far these several facts and inferences accord with the\r\ntheory of descent with modification. As the subject is somewhat\r\ncomplex, I must request the reader to turn to the diagram in the fourth\r\nchapter. We may suppose that the numbered letters in italics represent\r\ngenera, and the dotted lines diverging from them the species in each\r\ngenus. The diagram is much too simple, too few genera and too few\r\nspecies being given, but this is unimportant for us. The horizontal\r\nlines may represent successive geological formations, and all the forms\r\nbeneath the uppermost line may be considered as extinct. The three\r\nexisting genera, _a_14, _q_14, _p_14, will form a small family; _b_14\r\nand _f_14, a closely allied family or subfamily; and _o_14, _e_14,\r\n_m_14, a third family. These three families, together with the many\r\nextinct genera on the several lines of descent diverging from the\r\nparent form (A) will form an order; for all will have inherited\r\nsomething in common from their ancient progenitor. On the principle of\r\nthe continued tendency to divergence of character, which was formerly\r\nillustrated by this diagram, the more recent any form is the more it\r\nwill generally differ from its ancient progenitor. Hence, we can\r\nunderstand the rule that the most ancient fossils differ most from\r\nexisting forms. We must not, however, assume that divergence of\r\ncharacter is a necessary contingency; it depends solely on the\r\ndescendants from a species being thus enabled to seize on many and\r\ndifferent places in the economy of nature. Therefore it is quite\r\npossible, as we have seen in the case of some Silurian forms, that a\r\nspecies might go on being slightly modified in relation to its slightly\r\naltered conditions of life, and yet retain throughout a vast period the\r\nsame general characteristics. This is represented in the diagram by the\r\nletter F14.\r\n\r\nAll the many forms, extinct and recent, descended from (A), make, as\r\nbefore remarked, one order; and this order, from the continued effects\r\nof extinction and divergence of character, has become divided into\r\nseveral sub-families and families, some of which are supposed to have\r\nperished at different periods, and some to have endured to the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nBy looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct forms\r\nsupposed to be embedded in the successive formations, were discovered\r\nat several points low down in the series, the three existing families\r\non the uppermost line would be rendered less distinct from each other.\r\nIf, for instance, the genera _a_1, _a_5, _a_10, _f_8, _m_3, _m_6, _m_9,\r\nwere disinterred, these three families would be so closely linked\r\ntogether that they probably would have to be united into one great\r\nfamily, in nearly the same manner as has occurred with ruminants and\r\ncertain pachyderms. Yet he who objected to consider as intermediate the\r\nextinct genera, which thus link together the living genera of three\r\nfamilies, would be partly justified, for they are intermediate, not\r\ndirectly, but only by a long and circuitous course through many widely\r\ndifferent forms. If many extinct forms were to be discovered above one\r\nof the middle horizontal lines or geological formations—for instance,\r\nabove No. VI.—but none from beneath this line, then only two of the\r\nfamilies (those on the left hand _a_14, &c., and _b_14, &c.) would have\r\nto be united into one; and there would remain two families which would\r\nbe less distinct from each other than they were before the discovery of\r\nthe fossils. So again, if the three families formed of eight genera\r\n(_a_14 to _m_14), on the uppermost line, be supposed to differ from\r\neach other by half-a-dozen important characters, then the families\r\nwhich existed at a period marked VI would certainly have differed from\r\neach other by a less number of characters; for they would at this early\r\nstage of descent have diverged in a less degree from their common\r\nprogenitor. Thus it comes that ancient and extinct genera are often in\r\na greater or less degree intermediate in character between their\r\nmodified descendants, or between their collateral relations.\r\n\r\nUnder nature the process will be far more complicated than is\r\nrepresented in the diagram; for the groups will have been more\r\nnumerous; they will have endured for extremely unequal lengths of time,\r\nand will have been modified in various degrees. As we possess only the\r\nlast volume of the geological record, and that in a very broken\r\ncondition, we have no right to expect, except in rare cases, to fill up\r\nthe wide intervals in the natural system, and thus to unite distinct\r\nfamilies or orders. All that we have a right to expect is, that those\r\ngroups which have, within known geological periods, undergone much\r\nmodification, should in the older formations make some slight approach\r\nto each other; so that the older members should differ less from each\r\nother in some of their characters than do the existing members of the\r\nsame groups; and this by the concurrent evidence of our best\r\npalæontologists is frequently the case.\r\n\r\nThus, on the theory of descent with modification, the main facts with\r\nrespect to the mutual affinities of the extinct forms of life to each\r\nother and to living forms, are explained in a satisfactory manner. And\r\nthey are wholly inexplicable on any other view.\r\n\r\nOn this same theory, it is evident that the fauna during any one great\r\nperiod in the earth’s history will be intermediate in general character\r\nbetween that which preceded and that which succeeded it. Thus the\r\nspecies which lived at the sixth great stage of descent in the diagram\r\nare the modified offspring of those which lived at the fifth stage, and\r\nare the parents of those which became still more modified at the\r\nseventh stage; hence they could hardly fail to be nearly intermediate\r\nin character between the forms of life above and below. We must,\r\nhowever, allow for the entire extinction of some preceding forms, and\r\nin any one region for the immigration of new forms from other regions,\r\nand for a large amount of modification during the long and blank\r\nintervals between the successive formations. Subject to these\r\nallowances, the fauna of each geological period undoubtedly is\r\nintermediate in character, between the preceding and succeeding faunas.\r\nI need give only one instance, namely, the manner in which the fossils\r\nof the Devonian system, when this system was first discovered, were at\r\nonce recognised by palæontologists as intermediate in character between\r\nthose of the overlying carboniferous and underlying Silurian systems.\r\nBut each fauna is not necessarily exactly intermediate, as unequal\r\nintervals of time have elapsed between consecutive formations.\r\n\r\nIt is no real objection to the truth of the statement that the fauna of\r\neach period as a whole is nearly intermediate in character between the\r\npreceding and succeeding faunas, that certain genera offer exceptions\r\nto the rule. For instance, the species of mastodons and elephants, when\r\narranged by Dr. Falconer in two series—in the first place according to\r\ntheir mutual affinities, and in the second place according to their\r\nperiods of existence—do not accord in arrangement. The species extreme\r\nin character are not the oldest or the most recent; nor are those which\r\nare intermediate in character, intermediate in age. But supposing for\r\nan instant, in this and other such cases, that the record of the first\r\nappearance and disappearance of the species was complete, which is far\r\nfrom the case, we have no reason to believe that forms successively\r\nproduced necessarily endure for corresponding lengths of time. A very\r\nancient form may occasionally have lasted much longer than a form\r\nelsewhere subsequently produced, especially in the case of terrestrial\r\nproductions inhabiting separated districts. To compare small things\r\nwith great; if the principal living and extinct races of the domestic\r\npigeon were arranged in serial affinity, this arrangement would not\r\nclosely accord with the order in time of their production, and even\r\nless with the order of their disappearance; for the parent rock-pigeon\r\nstill lives; and many varieties between the rock-pigeon and the carrier\r\nhave become extinct; and carriers which are extreme in the important\r\ncharacter of length of beak originated earlier than short-beaked\r\ntumblers, which are at the opposite end of the series in this respect.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the statement, that the organic remains from an\r\nintermediate formation are in some degree intermediate in character, is\r\nthe fact, insisted on by all palæontologists, that fossils from two\r\nconsecutive formations are far more closely related to each other, than\r\nare the fossils from two remote formations. Pictet gives as a\r\nwell-known instance, the general resemblance of the organic remains\r\nfrom the several stages of the Chalk formation, though the species are\r\ndistinct in each stage. This fact alone, from its generality, seems to\r\nhave shaken Professor Pictet in his belief in the immutability of\r\nspecies. He who is acquainted with the distribution of existing species\r\nover the globe, will not attempt to account for the close resemblance\r\nof distinct species in closely consecutive formations, by the physical\r\nconditions of the ancient areas having remained nearly the same. Let it\r\nbe remembered that the forms of life, at least those inhabiting the\r\nsea, have changed almost simultaneously throughout the world, and\r\ntherefore under the most different climates and conditions. Consider\r\nthe prodigious vicissitudes of climate during the pleistocene period,\r\nwhich includes the whole glacial epoch, and note how little the\r\nspecific forms of the inhabitants of the sea have been affected.\r\n\r\nOn the theory of descent, the full meaning of the fossil remains from\r\nclosely consecutive formations, being closely related, though ranked as\r\ndistinct species, is obvious. As the accumulation of each formation has\r\noften been interrupted, and as long blank intervals have intervened\r\nbetween successive formations, we ought not to expect to find, as I\r\nattempted to show in the last chapter, in any one or in any two\r\nformations, all the intermediate varieties between the species which\r\nappeared at the commencement and close of these periods: but we ought\r\nto find after intervals, very long as measured by years, but only\r\nmoderately long as measured geologically, closely allied forms, or, as\r\nthey have been called by some authors, representative species; and\r\nthese assuredly we do find. We find, in short, such evidence of the\r\nslow and scarcely sensible mutations of specific forms, as we have the\r\nright to expect.\r\n\r\n_On the State of Development of Ancient compared with Living Forms._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the fourth chapter that the degree of differentiation\r\nand specialisation of the parts in organic beings, when arrived at\r\nmaturity, is the best standard, as yet suggested, of their degree of\r\nperfection or highness. We have also seen that, as the specialisation\r\nof parts is an advantage to each being, so natural selection will tend\r\nto render the organisation of each being more specialised and perfect,\r\nand in this sense higher; not but that it may leave many creatures with\r\nsimple and unimproved structures fitted for simple conditions of life,\r\nand in some cases will even degrade or simplify the organisation, yet\r\nleaving such degraded beings better fitted for their new walks of life.\r\nIn another and more general manner, new species become superior to\r\ntheir predecessors; for they have to beat in the struggle for life all\r\nthe older forms, with which they come into close competition. We may\r\ntherefore conclude that if under a nearly similar climate the eocene\r\ninhabitants of the world could be put into competition with the\r\nexisting inhabitants, the former would be beaten and exterminated by\r\nthe latter, as would the secondary by the eocene, and the palæozoic by\r\nthe secondary forms. So that by this fundamental test of victory in the\r\nbattle for life, as well as by the standard of the specialisation of\r\norgans, modern forms ought, on the theory of natural selection, to\r\nstand higher than ancient forms. Is this the case? A large majority of\r\npalæontologists would answer in the affirmative; and it seems that this\r\nanswer must be admitted as true, though difficult of proof.\r\n\r\nIt is no valid objection to this conclusion, that certain Brachiopods\r\nhave been but slightly modified from an extremely remote geological\r\nepoch; and that certain land and fresh-water shells have remained\r\nnearly the same, from the time when, as far as is known, they first\r\nappeared. It is not an insuperable difficulty that Foraminifera have\r\nnot, as insisted on by Dr. Carpenter, progressed in organisation since\r\neven the Laurentian epoch; for some organisms would have to remain\r\nfitted for simple conditions of life, and what could be better fitted\r\nfor this end than these lowly organised Protozoa? Such objections as\r\nthe above would be fatal to my view, if it included advance in\r\norganisation as a necessary contingent. They would likewise be fatal,\r\nif the above Foraminifera, for instance, could be proved to have first\r\ncome into existence during the Laurentian epoch, or the above\r\nBrachiopods during the Cambrian formation; for in this case, there\r\nwould not have been time sufficient for the development of these\r\norganisms up to the standard which they had then reached. When advanced\r\nup to any given point, there is no necessity, on the theory of natural\r\nselection, for their further continued process; though they will,\r\nduring each successive age, have to be slightly modified, so as to hold\r\ntheir places in relation to slight changes in their conditions. The\r\nforegoing objections hinge on the question whether we really know how\r\nold the world is, and at what period the various forms of life first\r\nappeared; and this may well be disputed.\r\n\r\nThe problem whether organisation on the whole has advanced is in many\r\nways excessively intricate. The geological record, at all times\r\nimperfect, does not extend far enough back to show with unmistakable\r\nclearness that within the known history of the world organisation has\r\nlargely advanced. Even at the present day, looking to members of the\r\nsame class, naturalists are not unanimous which forms ought to be\r\nranked as highest: thus, some look at the selaceans or sharks, from\r\ntheir approach in some important points of structure to reptiles, as\r\nthe highest fish; others look at the teleosteans as the highest. The\r\nganoids stand intermediate between the selaceans and teleosteans; the\r\nlatter at the present day are largely preponderant in number; but\r\nformerly selaceans and ganoids alone existed; and in this case,\r\naccording to the standard of highness chosen, so will it be said that\r\nfishes have advanced or retrograded in organisation. To attempt to\r\ncompare members of distinct types in the scale of highness seems\r\nhopeless; who will decide whether a cuttle-fish be higher than a\r\nbee—that insect which the great Von Baer believed to be “in fact more\r\nhighly organised than a fish, although upon another type?” In the\r\ncomplex struggle for life it is quite credible that crustaceans, not\r\nvery high in their own class, might beat cephalopods, the highest\r\nmolluscs; and such crustaceans, though not highly developed, would\r\nstand very high in the scale of invertebrate animals, if judged by the\r\nmost decisive of all trials—the law of battle. Beside these inherent\r\ndifficulties in deciding which forms are the most advanced in\r\norganisation, we ought not solely to compare the highest members of a\r\nclass at any two periods—though undoubtedly this is one and perhaps the\r\nmost important element in striking a balance—but we ought to compare\r\nall the members, high and low, at two periods. At an ancient epoch the\r\nhighest and lowest molluscoidal animals, namely, cephalopods and\r\nbrachiopods, swarmed in numbers; at the present time both groups are\r\ngreatly reduced, while others, intermediate in organisation, have\r\nlargely increased; consequently some naturalists maintain that molluscs\r\nwere formerly more highly developed than at present; but a stronger\r\ncase can be made out on the opposite side, by considering the vast\r\nreduction of brachiopods, and the fact that our existing cephalopods,\r\nthough few in number, are more highly organised than their ancient\r\nrepresentatives. We ought also to compare the relative proportional\r\nnumbers, at any two periods, of the high and low classes throughout the\r\nworld: if, for instance, at the present day fifty thousand kinds of\r\nvertebrate animals exist, and if we knew that at some former period\r\nonly ten thousand kinds existed, we ought to look at this increase in\r\nnumber in the highest class, which implies a great displacement of\r\nlower forms, as a decided advance in the organisation of the world. We\r\nthus see how hopelessly difficult it is to compare with perfect\r\nfairness, under such extremely complex relations, the standard of\r\norganisation of the imperfectly-known faunas of successive periods.\r\n\r\nWe shall appreciate this difficulty more clearly by looking to certain\r\nexisting faunas and floras. From the extraordinary manner in which\r\nEuropean productions have recently spread over New Zealand, and have\r\nseized on places which must have been previously occupied by the\r\nindigenes, we must believe, that if all the animals and plants of Great\r\nBritain were set free in New Zealand, a multitude of British forms\r\nwould in the course of time become thoroughly naturalized there, and\r\nwould exterminate many of the natives. On the other hand, from the fact\r\nthat hardly a single inhabitant of the southern hemisphere has become\r\nwild in any part of Europe, we may well doubt whether, if all the\r\nproductions of New Zealand were set free in Great Britain, any\r\nconsiderable number would be enabled to seize on places now occupied by\r\nour native plants and animals. Under this point of view, the\r\nproductions of Great Britain stand much higher in the scale than those\r\nof New Zealand. Yet the most skilful naturalist, from an examination of\r\nthe species of the two countries, could not have foreseen this result.\r\n\r\nAgassiz and several other highly competent judges insist that ancient\r\nanimals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of recent animals\r\nbelonging to the same classes; and that the geological succession of\r\nextinct forms is nearly parallel with the embryological development of\r\nexisting forms. This view accords admirably well with our theory. In a\r\nfuture chapter I shall attempt to show that the adult differs from its\r\nembryo, owing to variations having supervened at a not early age, and\r\nhaving been inherited at a corresponding age. This process, whilst it\r\nleaves the embryo almost unaltered, continually adds, in the course of\r\nsuccessive generations, more and more difference to the adult. Thus the\r\nembryo comes to be left as a sort of picture, preserved by nature, of\r\nthe former and less modified condition of the species. This view may be\r\ntrue, and yet may never be capable of proof. Seeing, for instance, that\r\nthe oldest known mammals, reptiles, and fishes strictly belong to their\r\nproper classes, though some of these old forms are in a slight degree\r\nless distinct from each other than are the typical members of the same\r\ngroups at the present day, it would be vain to look for animals having\r\nthe common embryological character of the Vertebrata, until beds rich\r\nin fossils are discovered far beneath the lowest Cambrian strata—a\r\ndiscovery of which the chance is small.\r\n\r\n_On the Succession of the same Types within the same Areas, during the\r\nlater Tertiary periods._\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Clift many years ago showed that the fossil mammals from the\r\nAustralian caves were closely allied to the living marsupials of that\r\ncontinent. In South America, a similar relationship is manifest, even\r\nto an uneducated eye, in the gigantic pieces of armour, like those of\r\nthe armadillo, found in several parts of La Plata; and Professor Owen\r\nhas shown in the most striking manner that most of the fossil mammals,\r\nburied there in such numbers, are related to South American types. This\r\nrelationship is even more clearly seen in the wonderful collection of\r\nfossil bones made by MM. Lund and Clausen in the caves of Brazil. I was\r\nso much impressed with these facts that I strongly insisted, in 1839\r\nand 1845, on this “law of the succession of types,”—on “this wonderful\r\nrelationship in the same continent between the dead and the living.”\r\nProfessor Owen has subsequently extended the same generalisation to the\r\nmammals of the Old World. We see the same law in this author’s\r\nrestorations of the extinct and gigantic birds of New Zealand. We see\r\nit also in the birds of the caves of Brazil. Mr. Woodward has shown\r\nthat the same law holds good with sea-shells, but, from the wide\r\ndistribution of most molluscs, it is not well displayed by them. Other\r\ncases could be added, as the relation between the extinct and living\r\nland-shells of Madeira; and between the extinct and living brackish\r\nwater-shells of the Aralo-Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\nNow, what does this remarkable law of the succession of the same types\r\nwithin the same areas mean? He would be a bold man who, after comparing\r\nthe present climate of Australia and of parts of South America, under\r\nthe same latitude, would attempt to account, on the one hand through\r\ndissimilar physical conditions, for the dissimilarity of the\r\ninhabitants of these two continents; and, on the other hand through\r\nsimilarity of conditions, for the uniformity of the same types in each\r\ncontinent during the later tertiary periods. Nor can it be pretended\r\nthat it is an immutable law that marsupials should have been chiefly or\r\nsolely produced in Australia; or that Edentata and other American types\r\nshould have been solely produced in South America. For we know that\r\nEurope in ancient times was peopled by numerous marsupials; and I have\r\nshown in the publications above alluded to, that in America the law of\r\ndistribution of terrestrial mammals was formerly different from what it\r\nnow is. North America formerly partook strongly of the present\r\ncharacter of the southern half of the continent; and the southern half\r\nwas formerly more closely allied, than it is at present, to the\r\nnorthern half. In a similar manner we know, from Falconer and Cautley’s\r\ndiscoveries, that Northern India was formerly more closely related in\r\nits mammals to Africa than it is at the present time. Analogous facts\r\ncould be given in relation to the distribution of marine animals.\r\n\r\nOn the theory of descent with modification, the great law of the long\r\nenduring, but not immutable, succession of the same types within the\r\nsame areas, is at once explained; for the inhabitants of each quarter\r\nof the world will obviously tend to leave in that quarter, during the\r\nnext succeeding period of time, closely allied though in some degree\r\nmodified descendants. If the inhabitants of one continent formerly\r\ndiffered greatly from those of another continent, so will their\r\nmodified descendants still differ in nearly the same manner and degree.\r\nBut after very long intervals of time, and after great geographical\r\nchanges, permitting much intermigration, the feebler will yield to the\r\nmore dominant forms, and there will be nothing immutable in the\r\ndistribution of organic beings.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked in ridicule whether I suppose that the megatherium and\r\nother allied huge monsters, which formerly lived in South America, have\r\nleft behind them the sloth, armadillo, and anteater, as their\r\ndegenerate descendants. This cannot for an instant be admitted. These\r\nhuge animals have become wholly extinct, and have left no progeny. But\r\nin the caves of Brazil there are many extinct species which are closely\r\nallied in size and in all other characters to the species still living\r\nin South America; and some of these fossils may have been the actual\r\nprogenitors of the living species. It must not be forgotten that, on\r\nour theory, all the species of the same genus are the descendants of\r\nsome one species; so that, if six genera, each having eight species, be\r\nfound in one geological formation, and in a succeeding formation there\r\nbe six other allied or representative genera, each with the same number\r\nof species, then we may conclude that generally only one species of\r\neach of the older genera has left modified descendants, which\r\nconstitute the new genera containing the several species; the other\r\nseven species of each old genus having died out and left no progeny.\r\nOr, and this will be a far commoner case, two or three species in two\r\nor three alone of the six older genera will be the parents of the new\r\ngenera: the other species and the other old genera having become\r\nutterly extinct. In failing orders, with the genera and species\r\ndecreasing in numbers as is the case with the Edentata of South\r\nAmerica, still fewer genera and species will leave modified\r\nblood-descendants.\r\n\r\n_Summary of the preceding and present Chapters._\r\n\r\n\r\nI have attempted to show that the geological record is extremely\r\nimperfect; that only a small portion of the globe has been geologically\r\nexplored with care; that only certain classes of organic beings have\r\nbeen largely preserved in a fossil state; that the number both of\r\nspecimens and of species, preserved in our museums, is absolutely as\r\nnothing compared with the number of generations which must have passed\r\naway even during a single formation; that, owing to subsidence being\r\nalmost necessary for the accumulation of deposits rich in fossil\r\nspecies of many kinds, and thick enough to outlast future degradation,\r\ngreat intervals of time must have elapsed between most of our\r\nsuccessive formations; that there has probably been more extinction\r\nduring the periods of subsidence, and more variation during the periods\r\nof elevation, and during the latter the record will have been least\r\nperfectly kept; that each single formation has not been continuously\r\ndeposited; that the duration of each formation is probably short\r\ncompared with the average duration of specific forms; that migration\r\nhas played an important part in the first appearance of new forms in\r\nany one area and formation; that widely ranging species are those which\r\nhave varied most frequently, and have oftenest given rise to new\r\nspecies; that varieties have at first been local; and lastly, although\r\neach species must have passed through numerous transitional stages, it\r\nis probable that the periods, during which each underwent modification,\r\nthough many and long as measured by years, have been short in\r\ncomparison with the periods during which each remained in an unchanged\r\ncondition. These causes, taken conjointly, will to a large extent\r\nexplain why—though we do find many links—we do not find interminable\r\nvarieties, connecting together all extinct and existing forms by the\r\nfinest graduated steps. It should also be constantly borne in mind that\r\nany linking variety between two forms, which might be found, would be\r\nranked, unless the whole chain could be perfectly restored, as a new\r\nand distinct species; for it is not pretended that we have any sure\r\ncriterion by which species and varieties can be discriminated.\r\n\r\nHe who rejects this view of the imperfection of the geological record,\r\nwill rightly reject the whole theory. For he may ask in vain where are\r\nthe numberless transitional links which must formerly have connected\r\nthe closely allied or representative species, found in the successive\r\nstages of the same great formation? He may disbelieve in the immense\r\nintervals of time which must have elapsed between our consecutive\r\nformations; he may overlook how important a part migration has played,\r\nwhen the formations of any one great region, as those of Europe, are\r\nconsidered; he may urge the apparent, but often falsely apparent,\r\nsudden coming in of whole groups of species. He may ask where are the\r\nremains of those infinitely numerous organisms which must have existed\r\nlong before the Cambrian system was deposited? We now know that at\r\nleast one animal did then exist; but I can answer this last question\r\nonly by supposing that where our oceans now extend they have extended\r\nfor an enormous period, and where our oscillating continents now stand\r\nthey have stood since the commencement of the Cambrian system; but\r\nthat, long before that epoch, the world presented a widely different\r\naspect; and that the older continents, formed of formations older than\r\nany known to us, exist now only as remnants in a metamorphosed\r\ncondition, or lie still buried under the ocean.\r\n\r\nPassing from these difficulties, the other great leading facts in\r\npalæontology agree admirably with the theory of descent with\r\nmodification through variation and natural selection. We can thus\r\nunderstand how it is that new species come in slowly and successively;\r\nhow species of different classes do not necessarily change together, or\r\nat the same rate, or in the same degree; yet in the long run that all\r\nundergo modification to some extent. The extinction of old forms is the\r\nalmost inevitable consequence of the production of new forms. We can\r\nunderstand why, when a species has once disappeared, it never\r\nreappears. Groups of species increase in numbers slowly, and endure for\r\nunequal periods of time; for the process of modification is necessarily\r\nslow, and depends on many complex contingencies. The dominant species\r\nbelonging to large and dominant groups tend to leave many modified\r\ndescendants, which form new sub-groups and groups. As these are formed,\r\nthe species of the less vigorous groups, from their inferiority\r\ninherited from a common progenitor, tend to become extinct together,\r\nand to leave no modified offspring on the face of the earth. But the\r\nutter extinction of a whole group of species has sometimes been a slow\r\nprocess, from the survival of a few descendants, lingering in protected\r\nand isolated situations. When a group has once wholly disappeared, it\r\ndoes not reappear; for the link of generation has been broken.\r\n\r\nWe can understand how it is that dominant forms which spread widely and\r\nyield the greatest number of varieties tend to people the world with\r\nallied, but modified, descendants; and these will generally succeed in\r\ndisplacing the groups which are their inferiors in the struggle for\r\nexistence. Hence, after long intervals of time, the productions of the\r\nworld appear to have changed simultaneously.\r\n\r\nWe can understand how it is that all the forms of life, ancient and\r\nrecent, make together a few grand classes. We can understand, from the\r\ncontinued tendency to divergence of character, why the more ancient a\r\nform is, the more it generally differs from those now living. Why\r\nancient and extinct forms often tend to fill up gaps between existing\r\nforms, sometimes blending two groups, previously classed as distinct\r\ninto one; but more commonly bringing them only a little closer\r\ntogether. The more ancient a form is, the more often it stands in some\r\ndegree intermediate between groups now distinct; for the more ancient a\r\nform is, the more nearly it will be related to, and consequently\r\nresemble, the common progenitor of groups, since become widely\r\ndivergent. Extinct forms are seldom directly intermediate between\r\nexisting forms; but are intermediate only by a long and circuitous\r\ncourse through other extinct and different forms. We can clearly see\r\nwhy the organic remains of closely consecutive formations are closely\r\nallied; for they are closely linked together by generation. We can\r\nclearly see why the remains of an intermediate formation are\r\nintermediate in character.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the world at each successive period in its history\r\nhave beaten their predecessors in the race for life, and are, in so\r\nfar, higher in the scale, and their structure has generally become more\r\nspecialised; and this may account for the common belief held by so many\r\npalæontologists, that organisation on the whole has progressed. Extinct\r\nand ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of the\r\nmore recent animals belonging to the same classes, and this wonderful\r\nfact receives a simple explanation according to our views. The\r\nsuccession of the same types of structure within the same areas during\r\nthe later geological periods ceases to be mysterious, and is\r\nintelligible on the principle of inheritance.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the geological record be as imperfect as many believe, and it\r\nmay at least be asserted that the record cannot be proved to be much\r\nmore perfect, the main objections to the theory of natural selection\r\nare greatly diminished or disappear. On the other hand, all the chief\r\nlaws of palæontology plainly proclaim, as it seems to me, that species\r\nhave been produced by ordinary generation: old forms having been\r\nsupplanted by new and improved forms of life, the products of variation\r\nand the survival of the fittest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresent distribution cannot be accounted for by differences in physical\r\nconditions—Importance of barriers—Affinity of the productions of the\r\nsame continent—Centres of creation—Means of dispersal by changes of\r\nclimate and of the level of the land, and by occasional means—Dispersal\r\nduring the Glacial period—Alternate Glacial periods in the North and\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn considering the distribution of organic beings over the face of the\r\nglobe, the first great fact which strikes us is, that neither the\r\nsimilarity nor the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various regions\r\ncan be wholly accounted for by climatal and other physical conditions.\r\nOf late, almost every author who has studied the subject has come to\r\nthis conclusion. The case of America alone would almost suffice to\r\nprove its truth; for if we exclude the arctic and northern temperate\r\nparts, all authors agree that one of the most fundamental divisions in\r\ngeographical distribution is that between the New and Old Worlds; yet\r\nif we travel over the vast American continent, from the central parts\r\nof the United States to its extreme southern point, we meet with the\r\nmost diversified conditions; humid districts, arid deserts, lofty\r\nmountains, grassy plains, forests, marshes, lakes and great rivers,\r\nunder almost every temperature. There is hardly a climate or condition\r\nin the Old World which cannot be paralleled in the New—at least so\r\nclosely as the same species generally require. No doubt small areas can\r\nbe pointed out in the Old World hotter than any in the New World; but\r\nthese are not inhabited by a fauna different from that of the\r\nsurrounding districts; for it is rare to find a group of organisms\r\nconfined to a small area, of which the conditions are peculiar in only\r\na slight degree. Notwithstanding this general parallelism in the\r\nconditions of Old and New Worlds, how widely different are their living\r\nproductions!\r\n\r\nIn the southern hemisphere, if we compare large tracts of land in\r\nAustralia, South Africa, and western South America, between latitudes\r\n25° and 35°, we shall find parts extremely similar in all their\r\nconditions, yet it would not be possible to point out three faunas and\r\nfloras more utterly dissimilar. Or, again, we may compare the\r\nproductions of South America south of latitude 35° with those north of\r\n25°, which consequently are separated by a space of ten degrees of\r\nlatitude, and are exposed to considerably different conditions; yet\r\nthey are incomparably more closely related to each other than they are\r\nto the productions of Australia or Africa under nearly the same\r\nclimate. Analogous facts could be given with respect to the inhabitants\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\nA second great fact which strikes us in our general review is, that\r\nbarriers of any kind, or obstacles to free migration, are related in a\r\nclose and important manner to the differences between the productions\r\nof various regions. We see this in the great difference in nearly all\r\nthe terrestrial productions of the New and Old Worlds, excepting in the\r\nnorthern parts, where the land almost joins, and where, under a\r\nslightly different climate, there might have been free migration for\r\nthe northern temperate forms, as there now is for the strictly arctic\r\nproductions. We see the same fact in the great difference between the\r\ninhabitants of Australia, Africa, and South America under the same\r\nlatitude; for these countries are almost as much isolated from each\r\nother as is possible. On each continent, also, we see the same fact;\r\nfor on the opposite sides of lofty and continuous mountain-ranges, and\r\nof great deserts and even of large rivers, we find different\r\nproductions; though as mountain chains, deserts, &c., are not as\r\nimpassable, or likely to have endured so long, as the oceans separating\r\ncontinents, the differences are very inferior in degree to those\r\ncharacteristic of distinct continents.\r\n\r\nTurning to the sea, we find the same law. The marine inhabitants of the\r\neastern and western shores of South America are very distinct, with\r\nextremely few shells, crustacea, or echinodermata in common; but Dr.\r\nGünther has recently shown that about thirty per cent of the fishes are\r\nthe same on the opposite sides of the isthmus of Panama; and this fact\r\nhas led naturalists to believe that the isthmus was formerly open.\r\nWestward of the shores of America, a wide space of open ocean extends,\r\nwith not an island as a halting-place for emigrants; here we have a\r\nbarrier of another kind, and as soon as this is passed we meet in the\r\neastern islands of the Pacific with another and totally distinct fauna.\r\nSo that three marine faunas range northward and southward in parallel\r\nlines not far from each other, under corresponding climate; but from\r\nbeing separated from each other by impassable barriers, either of land\r\nor open sea, they are almost wholly distinct. On the other hand,\r\nproceeding still farther westward from the eastern islands of the\r\ntropical parts of the Pacific, we encounter no impassable barriers, and\r\nwe have innumerable islands as halting-places, or continuous coasts,\r\nuntil, after travelling over a hemisphere, we come to the shores of\r\nAfrica; and over this vast space we meet with no well-defined and\r\ndistinct marine faunas. Although so few marine animals are common to\r\nthe above-named three approximate faunas of Eastern and Western America\r\nand the eastern Pacific islands, yet many fishes range from the Pacific\r\ninto the Indian Ocean, and many shells are common to the eastern\r\nislands of the Pacific and the eastern shores of Africa on almost\r\nexactly opposite meridians of longitude.\r\n\r\nA third great fact, partly included in the foregoing statement, is the\r\naffinity of the productions of the same continent or of the same sea,\r\nthough the species themselves are distinct at different points and\r\nstations. It is a law of the widest generality, and every continent\r\noffers innumerable instances. Nevertheless, the naturalist, in\r\ntravelling, for instance, from north to south, never fails to be struck\r\nby the manner in which successive groups of beings, specifically\r\ndistinct, though nearly related, replace each other. He hears from\r\nclosely allied, yet distinct kinds of birds, notes nearly similar, and\r\nsees their nests similarly constructed, but not quite alike, with eggs\r\ncoloured in nearly the same manner. The plains near the Straits of\r\nMagellan are inhabited by one species of Rhea (American ostrich), and\r\nnorthward the plains of La Plata by another species of the same genus;\r\nand not by a true ostrich or emu, like those inhabiting Africa and\r\nAustralia under the same latitude. On these same plains of La Plata we\r\nsee the agouti and bizcacha, animals having nearly the same habits as\r\nour hares and rabbits, and belonging to the same order of Rodents, but\r\nthey plainly display an American type of structure. We ascend the lofty\r\npeaks of the Cordillera, and we find an alpine species of bizcacha; we\r\nlook to the waters, and we do not find the beaver or muskrat, but the\r\ncoypu and capybara, rodents of the South American type. Innumerable\r\nother instances could be given. If we look to the islands off the\r\nAmerican shore, however much they may differ in geological structure,\r\nthe inhabitants are essentially American, though they may be all\r\npeculiar species. We may look back to past ages, as shown in the last\r\nchapter, and we find American types then prevailing on the American\r\ncontinent and in the American seas. We see in these facts some deep\r\norganic bond, throughout space and time, over the same areas of land\r\nand water, independently of physical conditions. The naturalist must be\r\ndull who is not led to inquire what this bond is.\r\n\r\nThe bond is simply inheritance, that cause which alone, as far as we\r\npositively know, produces organisms quite like each other, or, as we\r\nsee in the case of varieties, nearly alike. The dissimilarity of the\r\ninhabitants of different regions may be attributed to modification\r\nthrough variation and natural selection, and probably in a subordinate\r\ndegree to the definite influence of different physical conditions. The\r\ndegrees of dissimilarity will depend on the migration of the more\r\ndominant forms of life from one region into another having been more or\r\nless effectually prevented, at periods more or less remote—on the\r\nnature and number of the former immigrants—and on the action of the\r\ninhabitants on each other in leading to the preservation of different\r\nmodifications; the relation of organism to organism in the struggle for\r\nlife being, as I have already often remarked, the most important of all\r\nrelations. Thus the high importance of barriers comes into play by\r\nchecking migration; as does time for the slow process of modification\r\nthrough natural selection. Widely-ranging species, abounding in\r\nindividuals, which have already triumphed over many competitors in\r\ntheir own widely-extended homes, will have the best chance of seizing\r\non new places, when they spread out into new countries. In their new\r\nhomes they will be exposed to new conditions, and will frequently\r\nundergo further modification and improvement; and thus they will become\r\nstill further victorious, and will produce groups of modified\r\ndescendants. On this principle of inheritance with modification we can\r\nunderstand how it is that sections of genera, whole genera, and even\r\nfamilies, are confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and\r\nnotoriously the case.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence, as was remarked in the last chapter, of the\r\nexistence of any law of necessary development. As the variability of\r\neach species is an independent property, and will be taken advantage of\r\nby natural selection, only so far as it profits each individual in its\r\ncomplex struggle for life, so the amount of modification in different\r\nspecies will be no uniform quantity. If a number of species, after\r\nhaving long competed with each other in their old home, were to migrate\r\nin a body into a new and afterwards isolated country, they would be\r\nlittle liable to modification; for neither migration nor isolation in\r\nthemselves effect anything. These principles come into play only by\r\nbringing organisms into new relations with each other and in a lesser\r\ndegree with the surrounding physical conditions. As we have seen in the\r\nlast chapter that some forms have retained nearly the same character\r\nfrom an enormously remote geological period, so certain species have\r\nmigrated over vast spaces, and have not become greatly or at all\r\nmodified.\r\n\r\nAccording to these views, it is obvious that the several species of the\r\nsame genus, though inhabiting the most distant quarters of the world,\r\nmust originally have proceeded from the same source, as they are\r\ndescended from the same progenitor. In the case of those species which\r\nhave undergone, during whole geological periods, little modification,\r\nthere is not much difficulty in believing that they have migrated from\r\nthe same region; for during the vast geographical and climatical\r\nchanges which have supervened since ancient times, almost any amount of\r\nmigration is possible. But in many other cases, in which we have reason\r\nto believe that the species of a genus have been produced within\r\ncomparatively recent times, there is great difficulty on this head. It\r\nis also obvious that the individuals of the same species, though now\r\ninhabiting distant and isolated regions, must have proceeded from one\r\nspot, where their parents were first produced: for, as has been\r\nexplained, it is incredible that individuals identically the same\r\nshould have been produced from parents specifically distinct.\r\n\r\n_Single Centres of supposed Creation._—We are thus brought to the\r\nquestion which has been largely discussed by naturalists, namely,\r\nwhether species have been created at one or more points of the earth’s\r\nsurface. Undoubtedly there are many cases of extreme difficulty in\r\nunderstanding how the same species could possibly have migrated from\r\nsome one point to the several distant and isolated points, where now\r\nfound. Nevertheless the simplicity of the view that each species was\r\nfirst produced within a single region captivates the mind. He who\r\nrejects it, rejects the vera causa of ordinary generation with\r\nsubsequent migration, and calls in the agency of a miracle. It is\r\nuniversally admitted, that in most cases the area inhabited by a\r\nspecies is continuous; and that when a plant or animal inhabits two\r\npoints so distant from each other, or with an interval of such a\r\nnature, that the space could not have been easily passed over by\r\nmigration, the fact is given as something remarkable and exceptional.\r\nThe incapacity of migrating across a wide sea is more clear in the case\r\nof terrestrial mammals than perhaps with any other organic beings; and,\r\naccordingly, we find no inexplicable instances of the same mammals\r\ninhabiting distant points of the world. No geologist feels any\r\ndifficulty in Great Britain possessing the same quadrupeds with the\r\nrest of Europe, for they were no doubt once united. But if the same\r\nspecies can be produced at two separate points, why do we not find a\r\nsingle mammal common to Europe and Australia or South America? The\r\nconditions of life are nearly the same, so that a multitude of European\r\nanimals and plants have become naturalised in America and Australia;\r\nand some of the aboriginal plants are identically the same at these\r\ndistant points of the northern and southern hemispheres? The answer, as\r\nI believe, is, that mammals have not been able to migrate, whereas some\r\nplants, from their varied means of dispersal, have migrated across the\r\nwide and broken interspaces. The great and striking influence of\r\nbarriers of all kinds, is intelligible only on the view that the great\r\nmajority of species have been produced on one side, and have not been\r\nable to migrate to the opposite side. Some few families, many\r\nsubfamilies, very many genera, a still greater number of sections of\r\ngenera, are confined to a single region; and it has been observed by\r\nseveral naturalists that the most natural genera, or those genera in\r\nwhich the species are most closely related to each other, are generally\r\nconfined to the same country, or if they have a wide range that their\r\nrange is continuous. What a strange anomaly it would be if a directly\r\nopposite rule were to prevail when we go down one step lower in the\r\nseries, namely to the individuals of the same species, and these had\r\nnot been, at least at first, confined to some one region!\r\n\r\nHence, it seems to me, as it has to many other naturalists, that the\r\nview of each species having been produced in one area alone, and having\r\nsubsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of migration\r\nand subsistence under past and present conditions permitted, is the\r\nmost probable. Undoubtedly many cases occur in which we cannot explain\r\nhow the same species could have passed from one point to the other. But\r\nthe geographical and climatical changes which have certainly occurred\r\nwithin recent geological times, must have rendered discontinuous the\r\nformerly continuous range of many species. So that we are reduced to\r\nconsider whether the exceptions to continuity of range are so numerous,\r\nand of so grave a nature, that we ought to give up the belief, rendered\r\nprobable by general considerations, that each species has been produced\r\nwithin one area, and has migrated thence as far as it could. It would\r\nbe hopelessly tedious to discuss all the exceptional cases of the same\r\nspecies, now living at distant and separated points; nor do I for a\r\nmoment pretend that any explanation could be offered of many instances.\r\nBut, after some preliminary remarks, I will discuss a few of the most\r\nstriking classes of facts, namely, the existence of the same species on\r\nthe summits of distant mountain ranges, and at distant points in the\r\nArctic and Antarctic regions; and secondly (in the following chapter),\r\nthe wide distribution of fresh water productions; and thirdly, the\r\noccurrence of the same terrestrial species on islands and on the\r\nnearest mainland, though separated by hundreds of miles of open sea. If\r\nthe existence of the same species at distant and isolated points of the\r\nearth’s surface can in many instances be explained on the view of each\r\nspecies having migrated from a single birthplace; then, considering our\r\nignorance with respect to former climatical and geographical changes,\r\nand to the various occasional means of transport, the belief that a\r\nsingle birthplace is the law seems to me incomparably the safest.\r\n\r\nIn discussing this subject we shall be enabled at the same time to\r\nconsider a point equally important for us, namely, whether the several\r\nspecies of a genus which must on our theory all be descended from a\r\ncommon progenitor, can have migrated, undergoing modification during\r\ntheir migration from some one area. If, when most of the species\r\ninhabiting one region are different from those of another region,\r\nthough closely allied to them, it can be shown that migration from the\r\none region to the other has probably occurred at some former period,\r\nour general view will be much strengthened; for the explanation is\r\nobvious on the principle of descent with modification. A volcanic\r\nisland, for instance, upheaved and formed at the distance of a few\r\nhundreds of miles from a continent, would probably receive from it in\r\nthe course of time a few colonists, and their descendants, though\r\nmodified, would still be related by inheritance to the inhabitants of\r\nthat continent. Cases of this nature are common, and are, as we shall\r\nhereafter see, inexplicable on the theory of independent creation. This\r\nview of the relation of the species of one region to those of another,\r\ndoes not differ much from that advanced by Mr. Wallace, who concludes\r\nthat “every species has come into existence coincident both in space\r\nand time with a pre-existing closely allied species.” And it is now\r\nwell known that he attributes this coincidence to descent with\r\nmodification.\r\n\r\nThe question of single or multiple centres of creation differs from\r\nanother though allied question, namely, whether all the individuals of\r\nthe same species are descended from a single pair, or single\r\nhermaphrodite, or whether, as some authors suppose, from many\r\nindividuals simultaneously created. With organic beings which never\r\nintercross, if such exist, each species, must be descended from a\r\nsuccession of modified varieties, that have supplanted each other, but\r\nhave never blended with other individuals or varieties of the same\r\nspecies, so that, at each successive stage of modification, all the\r\nindividuals of the same form will be descended from a single parent.\r\nBut in the great majority of cases, namely, with all organisms which\r\nhabitually unite for each birth, or which occasionally intercross, the\r\nindividuals of the same species inhabiting the same area will be kept\r\nnearly uniform by intercrossing; so that many individuals will go on\r\nsimultaneously changing, and the whole amount of modification at each\r\nstage will not be due to descent from a single parent. To illustrate\r\nwhat I mean: our English race-horses differ from the horses of every\r\nother breed; but they do not owe their difference and superiority to\r\ndescent from any single pair, but to continued care in the selecting\r\nand training of many individuals during each generation.\r\n\r\nBefore discussing the three classes of facts, which I have selected as\r\npresenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the theory of “single\r\ncentres of creation,” I must say a few words on the means of dispersal.\r\n\r\n_Means of Dispersal._\r\n\r\n\r\nSir C. Lyell and other authors have ably treated this subject. I can\r\ngive here only the briefest abstract of the more important facts.\r\nChange of climate must have had a powerful influence on migration. A\r\nregion now impassable to certain organisms from the nature of its\r\nclimate, might have been a high road for migration, when the climate\r\nwas different. I shall, however, presently have to discuss this branch\r\nof the subject in some detail. Changes of level in the land must also\r\nhave been highly influential: a narrow isthmus now separates two marine\r\nfaunas; submerge it, or let it formerly have been submerged, and the\r\ntwo faunas will now blend together, or may formerly have blended. Where\r\nthe sea now extends, land may at a former period have connected islands\r\nor possibly even continents together, and thus have allowed terrestrial\r\nproductions to pass from one to the other. No geologist disputes that\r\ngreat mutations of level have occurred within the period of existing\r\norganisms. Edward Forbes insisted that all the islands in the Atlantic\r\nmust have been recently connected with Europe or Africa, and Europe\r\nlikewise with America. Other authors have thus hypothetically bridged\r\nover every ocean, and united almost every island with some mainland.\r\nIf, indeed, the arguments used by Forbes are to be trusted, it must be\r\nadmitted that scarcely a single island exists which has not recently\r\nbeen united to some continent. This view cuts the Gordian knot of the\r\ndispersal of the same species to the most distant points, and removes\r\nmany a difficulty; but to the best of my judgment we are not authorized\r\nin admitting such enormous geographical changes within the period of\r\nexisting species. It seems to me that we have abundant evidence of\r\ngreat oscillations in the level of the land or sea; but not of such\r\nvast changes in the position and extension of our continents, as to\r\nhave united them within the recent period to each other and to the\r\nseveral intervening oceanic islands. I freely admit the former\r\nexistence of many islands, now buried beneath the sea, which may have\r\nserved as halting-places for plants and for many animals during their\r\nmigration. In the coral-producing oceans such sunken islands are now\r\nmarked by rings of coral or atolls standing over them. Whenever it is\r\nfully admitted, as it will some day be, that each species has proceeded\r\nfrom a single birthplace, and when in the course of time we know\r\nsomething definite about the means of distribution, we shall be enabled\r\nto speculate with security on the former extension of the land. But I\r\ndo not believe that it will ever be proved that within the recent\r\nperiod most of our continents which now stand quite separate, have been\r\ncontinuously, or almost continuously united with each other, and with\r\nthe many existing oceanic islands. Several facts in distribution—such\r\nas the great difference in the marine faunas on the opposite sides of\r\nalmost every continent—the close relation of the tertiary inhabitants\r\nof several lands and even seas to their present inhabitants—the degree\r\nof affinity between the mammals inhabiting islands with those of the\r\nnearest continent, being in part determined (as we shall hereafter see)\r\nby the depth of the intervening ocean—these and other such facts are\r\nopposed to the admission of such prodigious geographical revolutions\r\nwithin the recent period, as are necessary on the view advanced by\r\nForbes and admitted by his followers. The nature and relative\r\nproportions of the inhabitants of oceanic islands are likewise opposed\r\nto the belief of their former continuity of continents. Nor does the\r\nalmost universally volcanic composition of such islands favour the\r\nadmission that they are the wrecks of sunken continents; if they had\r\noriginally existed as continental mountain ranges, some at least of the\r\nislands would have been formed, like other mountain summits, of\r\ngranite, metamorphic schists, old fossiliferous and other rocks,\r\ninstead of consisting of mere piles of volcanic matter.\r\n\r\nI must now say a few words on what are called accidental means, but\r\nwhich more properly should be called occasional means of distribution.\r\nI shall here confine myself to plants. In botanical works, this or that\r\nplant is often stated to be ill adapted for wide dissemination; but the\r\ngreater or less facilities for transport across the sea may be said to\r\nbe almost wholly unknown. Until I tried, with Mr. Berkeley’s aid, a few\r\nexperiments, it was not even known how far seeds could resist the\r\ninjurious action of sea-water. To my surprise I found that out of\r\neighty-seven kinds, sixty-four germinated after an immersion of\r\ntwenty-eight days, and a few survived an immersion of 137 days. It\r\ndeserves notice that certain orders were far more injured than others:\r\nnine Leguminosæ were tried, and, with one exception, they resisted the\r\nsalt-water badly; seven species of the allied orders, Hydrophyllaceæ\r\nand Polemoniaceæ, were all killed by a month’s immersion. For\r\nconvenience’ sake I chiefly tried small seeds without the capsules or\r\nfruit; and as all of these sank in a few days, they could not have been\r\nfloated across wide spaces of the sea, whether or not they were injured\r\nby salt water. Afterwards I tried some larger fruits, capsules, &c.,\r\nand some of these floated for a long time. It is well known what a\r\ndifference there is in the buoyancy of green and seasoned timber; and\r\nit occurred to me that floods would often wash into the sea dried\r\nplants or branches with seed-capsules or fruit attached to them. Hence\r\nI was led to dry the stems and branches of ninety-four plants with ripe\r\nfruit, and to place them on sea-water. The majority sank quickly, but\r\nsome which, whilst green, floated for a very short time, when dried\r\nfloated much longer; for instance, ripe hazel-nuts sank immediately,\r\nbut when dried they floated for ninety days, and afterwards when\r\nplanted germinated; an asparagus plant with ripe berries floated for\r\ntwenty-three days, when dried it floated for eighty-five days, and the\r\nseeds afterwards germinated: the ripe seeds of Helosciadium sank in two\r\ndays, when dried they floated for above ninety days, and afterwards\r\ngerminated. Altogether, out of the ninety-four dried plants, eighteen\r\nfloated for above twenty-eight days; and some of the eighteen floated\r\nfor a very much longer period. So that as 64/87 kinds of seeds\r\ngerminated after an immersion of twenty-eight days; and as 18/94\r\ndistinct species with ripe fruit (but not all the same species as in\r\nthe foregoing experiment) floated, after being dried, for above\r\ntwenty-eight days, we may conclude, as far as anything can be inferred\r\nfrom these scanty facts, that the seeds of 14/100 kinds of plants of\r\nany country might be floated by sea-currents during twenty-eight days,\r\nand would retain their power of germination. In Johnston’s Physical\r\nAtlas, the average rate of the several Atlantic currents is\r\nthirty-three miles per diem (some currents running at the rate of sixty\r\nmiles per diem); on this average, the seeds of 14/100 plants belonging\r\nto one country might be floated across 924 miles of sea to another\r\ncountry; and when stranded, if blown by an inland gale to a favourable\r\nspot, would germinate.\r\n\r\nSubsequently to my experiments, M. Martens tried similar ones, but in a\r\nmuch better manner, for he placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea,\r\nso that they were alternately wet and exposed to the air like really\r\nfloating plants. He tried ninety-eight seeds, mostly different from\r\nmine, but he chose many large fruits, and likewise seeds, from plants\r\nwhich live near the sea; and this would have favoured both the average\r\nlength of their flotation and their resistance to the injurious action\r\nof the salt-water. On the other hand, he did not previously dry the\r\nplants or branches with the fruit; and this, as we have seen, would\r\nhave caused some of them to have floated much longer. The result was\r\nthat 18/98 of his seeds of different kinds floated for forty-two days,\r\nand were then capable of germination. But I do not doubt that plants\r\nexposed to the waves would float for a less time than those protected\r\nfrom violent movement as in our experiments. Therefore, it would\r\nperhaps be safer to assume that the seeds of about 10/100 plants of a\r\nflora, after having been dried, could be floated across a space of sea\r\n900 miles in width, and would then germinate. The fact of the larger\r\nfruits often floating longer than the small, is interesting; as plants\r\nwith large seeds or fruit which, as Alph. de Candolle has shown,\r\ngenerally have restricted ranges, could hardly be transported by any\r\nother means.\r\n\r\nSeeds may be occasionally transported in another manner. Drift timber\r\nis thrown up on most islands, even on those in the midst of the widest\r\noceans; and the natives of the coral islands in the Pacific procure\r\nstones for their tools, solely from the roots of drifted trees, these\r\nstones being a valuable royal tax. I find that when irregularly shaped\r\nstones are embedded in the roots of trees, small parcels of earth are\r\nvery frequently enclosed in their interstices and behind them, so\r\nperfectly that not a particle could be washed away during the longest\r\ntransport: out of one small portion of earth thus _completely_ enclosed\r\nby the roots of an oak about fifty years old, three dicotyledonous\r\nplants germinated: I am certain of the accuracy of this observation.\r\nAgain, I can show that the carcasses of birds, when floating on the\r\nsea, sometimes escape being immediately devoured; and many kinds of\r\nseeds in the crops of floating birds long retain their vitality: peas\r\nand vetches, for instance, are killed by even a few days’ immersion in\r\nsea-water; but some taken out of the crop of a pigeon, which had\r\nfloated on artificial sea-water for thirty days, to my surprise nearly\r\nall germinated.\r\n\r\nLiving birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in the\r\ntransportation of seeds. I could give many facts showing how frequently\r\nbirds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances across the\r\nocean. We may safely assume that under such circumstances their rate of\r\nflight would often be thirty-five miles an hour; and some authors have\r\ngiven a far higher estimate. I have never seen an instance of\r\nnutritious seeds passing through the intestines of a bird; but hard\r\nseeds of fruit pass uninjured through even the digestive organs of a\r\nturkey. In the course of two months, I picked up in my garden twelve\r\nkinds of seeds, out of the excrement of small birds, and these seemed\r\nperfect, and some of them, which were tried, germinated. But the\r\nfollowing fact is more important: the crops of birds do not secrete\r\ngastric juice, and do not, as I know by trial, injure in the least the\r\ngermination of seeds; now, after a bird has found and devoured a large\r\nsupply of food, it is positively asserted that all the grains do not\r\npass into the gizzard for twelve or even eighteen hours. A bird in this\r\ninterval might easily be blown to the distance of five hundred miles,\r\nand hawks are known to look out for tired birds, and the contents of\r\ntheir torn crops might thus readily get scattered. Some hawks and owls\r\nbolt their prey whole, and after an interval of from twelve to twenty\r\nhours, disgorge pellets, which, as I know from experiments made in the\r\nZoological Gardens, include seeds capable of germination. Some seeds of\r\nthe oat, wheat, millet, canary, hemp, clover, and beet germinated after\r\nhaving been from twelve to twenty-one hours in the stomachs of\r\ndifferent birds of prey; and two seeds of beet grew after having been\r\nthus retained for two days and fourteen hours. Fresh-water fish, I\r\nfind, eat seeds of many land and water plants; fish are frequently\r\ndevoured by birds, and thus the seeds might be transported from place\r\nto place. I forced many kinds of seeds into the stomachs of dead fish,\r\nand then gave their bodies to fishing-eagles, storks, and pelicans;\r\nthese birds, after an interval of many hours, either rejected the seeds\r\nin pellets or passed them in their excrement; and several of these\r\nseeds retained the power of germination. Certain seeds, however, were\r\nalways killed by this process.\r\n\r\nLocusts are sometimes blown to great distances from the land. I myself\r\ncaught one 370 miles from the coast of Africa, and have heard of others\r\ncaught at greater distances. The Rev. R.T. Lowe informed Sir C. Lyell\r\nthat in November, 1844, swarms of locusts visited the island of\r\nMadeira. They were in countless numbers, as thick as the flakes of snow\r\nin the heaviest snowstorm, and extended upward as far as could be seen\r\nwith a telescope. During two or three days they slowly careered round\r\nand round in an immense ellipse, at least five or six miles in\r\ndiameter, and at night alighted on the taller trees, which were\r\ncompletely coated with them. They then disappeared over the sea, as\r\nsuddenly as they had appeared, and have not since visited the island.\r\nNow, in parts of Natal it is believed by some farmers, though on\r\ninsufficient evidence, that injurious seeds are introduced into their\r\ngrass-land in the dung left by the great flights of locusts which often\r\nvisit that country. In consequence of this belief Mr. Weale sent me in\r\na letter a small packet of the dried pellets, out of which I extracted\r\nunder the microscope several seeds, and raised from them seven grass\r\nplants, belonging to two species, of two genera. Hence a swarm of\r\nlocusts, such as that which visited Madeira, might readily be the means\r\nof introducing several kinds of plants into an island lying far from\r\nthe mainland.\r\n\r\nAlthough the beaks and feet of birds are generally clean, earth\r\nsometimes adheres to them: in one case I removed sixty-one grains, and\r\nin another case twenty-two grains of dry argillaceous earth from the\r\nfoot of a partridge, and in the earth there was a pebble as large as\r\nthe seed of a vetch. Here is a better case: the leg of a woodcock was\r\nsent to me by a friend, with a little cake of dry earth attached to the\r\nshank, weighing only nine grains; and this contained a seed of the\r\ntoad-rush (Juncus bufonius) which germinated and flowered. Mr.\r\nSwaysland, of Brighton, who during the last forty years has paid close\r\nattention to our migratory birds, informs me that he has often shot\r\nwagtails (Motacillæ), wheatears, and whinchats (Saxicolæ), on their\r\nfirst arrival on our shores, before they had alighted; and he has\r\nseveral times noticed little cakes of earth attached to their feet.\r\nMany facts could be given showing how generally soil is charged with\r\nseeds. For instance, Professor Newton sent me the leg of a red-legged\r\npartridge (Caccabis rufa) which had been wounded and could not fly,\r\nwith a ball of hard earth adhering to it, and weighing six and a half\r\nounces. The earth had been kept for three years, but when broken,\r\nwatered and placed under a bell glass, no less than eighty-two plants\r\nsprung from it: these consisted of twelve monocotyledons, including the\r\ncommon oat, and at least one kind of grass, and of seventy\r\ndicotyledons, which consisted, judging from the young leaves, of at\r\nleast three distinct species. With such facts before us, can we doubt\r\nthat the many birds which are annually blown by gales across great\r\nspaces of ocean, and which annually migrate—for instance, the millions\r\nof quails across the Mediterranean—must occasionally transport a few\r\nseeds embedded in dirt adhering to their feet or beaks? But I shall\r\nhave to recur to this subject.\r\n\r\nAs icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and stones, and\r\nhave even carried brushwood, bones, and the nest of a land-bird, it can\r\nhardly be doubted that they must occasionally, as suggested by Lyell,\r\nhave transported seeds from one part to another of the arctic and\r\nantarctic regions; and during the Glacial period from one part of the\r\nnow temperate regions to another. In the Azores, from the large number\r\nof plants common to Europe, in comparison with the species on the other\r\nislands of the Atlantic, which stand nearer to the mainland, and (as\r\nremarked by Mr. H.C. Watson) from their somewhat northern character, in\r\ncomparison with the latitude, I suspected that these islands had been\r\npartly stocked by ice-borne seeds during the Glacial epoch. At my\r\nrequest Sir C. Lyell wrote to M. Hartung to inquire whether he had\r\nobserved erratic boulders on these islands, and he answered that he had\r\nfound large fragments of granite and other rocks, which do not occur in\r\nthe archipelago. Hence we may safely infer that icebergs formerly\r\nlanded their rocky burdens on the shores of these mid-ocean islands,\r\nand it is at least possible that they may have brought thither the\r\nseeds of northern plants.\r\n\r\nConsidering that these several means of transport, and that other\r\nmeans, which without doubt remain to be discovered, have been in action\r\nyear after year for tens of thousands of years, it would, I think, be a\r\nmarvellous fact if many plants had not thus become widely transported.\r\nThese means of transport are sometimes called accidental, but this is\r\nnot strictly correct: the currents of the sea are not accidental, nor\r\nis the direction of prevalent gales of wind. It should be observed that\r\nscarcely any means of transport would carry seeds for very great\r\ndistances; for seeds do not retain their vitality when exposed for a\r\ngreat length of time to the action of sea water; nor could they be long\r\ncarried in the crops or intestines of birds. These means, however,\r\nwould suffice for occasional transport across tracts of sea some\r\nhundred miles in breadth, or from island to island, or from a continent\r\nto a neighbouring island, but not from one distant continent to\r\nanother. The floras of distant continents would not by such means\r\nbecome mingled; but would remain as distinct as they now are. The\r\ncurrents, from their course, would never bring seeds from North America\r\nto Britain, though they might and do bring seeds from the West Indies\r\nto our western shores, where, if not killed by their very long\r\nimmersion in salt water, they could not endure our climate. Almost\r\nevery year, one or two land-birds are blown across the whole Atlantic\r\nOcean, from North America to the western shores of Ireland and England;\r\nbut seeds could be transported by these rare wanderers only by one\r\nmeans, namely, by dirt adhering to their feet or beaks, which is in\r\nitself a rare accident. Even in this case, how small would be the\r\nchance of a seed falling on favourable soil, and coming to maturity!\r\nBut it would be a great error to argue that because a well-stocked\r\nisland, like Great Britain, has not, as far as is known (and it would\r\nbe very difficult to prove this), received within the last few\r\ncenturies, through occasional means of transport, immigrants from\r\nEurope or any other continent, that a poorly-stocked island, though\r\nstanding more remote from the mainland, would not receive colonists by\r\nsimilar means. Out of a hundred kinds of seeds or animals transported\r\nto an island, even if far less well-stocked than Britain, perhaps not\r\nmore than one would be so well fitted to its new home, as to become\r\nnaturalised. But this is no valid argument against what would be\r\neffected by occasional means of transport, during the long lapse of\r\ngeological time, whilst the island was being upheaved, and before it\r\nhad become fully stocked with inhabitants. On almost bare land, with\r\nfew or no destructive insects or birds living there, nearly every seed\r\nwhich chanced to arrive, if fitted for the climate, would germinate and\r\nsurvive.\r\n\r\n_Dispersal during the Glacial Period._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe identity of many plants and animals, on mountain-summits, separated\r\nfrom each other by hundreds of miles of lowlands, where Alpine species\r\ncould not possibly exist, is one of the most striking cases known of\r\nthe same species living at distant points, without the apparent\r\npossibility of their having migrated from one point to the other. It is\r\nindeed a remarkable fact to see so many plants of the same species\r\nliving on the snowy regions of the Alps or Pyrenees, and in the extreme\r\nnorthern parts of Europe; but it is far more remarkable, that the\r\nplants on the White Mountains, in the United States of America, are all\r\nthe same with those of Labrador, and nearly all the same, as we hear\r\nfrom Asa Gray, with those on the loftiest mountains of Europe. Even as\r\nlong ago as 1747, such facts led Gmelin to conclude that the same\r\nspecies must have been independently created at many distinct points;\r\nand we might have remained in this same belief, had not Agassiz and\r\nothers called vivid attention to the Glacial period, which, as we shall\r\nimmediately see, affords a simple explanation of these facts. We have\r\nevidence of almost every conceivable kind, organic and inorganic, that,\r\nwithin a very recent geological period, central Europe and North\r\nAmerica suffered under an Arctic climate. The ruins of a house burnt by\r\nfire do not tell their tale more plainly than do the mountains of\r\nScotland and Wales, with their scored flanks, polished surfaces, and\r\nperched boulders, of the icy streams with which their valleys were\r\nlately filled. So greatly has the climate of Europe changed, that in\r\nNorthern Italy, gigantic moraines, left by old glaciers, are now\r\nclothed by the vine and maize. Throughout a large part of the United\r\nStates, erratic boulders and scored rocks plainly reveal a former cold\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe former influence of the glacial climate on the distribution of the\r\ninhabitants of Europe, as explained by Edward Forbes, is substantially\r\nas follows. But we shall follow the changes more readily, by supposing\r\na new glacial period slowly to come on, and then pass away, as formerly\r\noccurred. As the cold came on, and as each more southern zone became\r\nfitted for the inhabitants of the north, these would take the places of\r\nthe former inhabitants of the temperate regions. The latter, at the\r\nsame time would travel further and further southward, unless they were\r\nstopped by barriers, in which case they would perish. The mountains\r\nwould become covered with snow and ice, and their former Alpine\r\ninhabitants would descend to the plains. By the time that the cold had\r\nreached its maximum, we should have an arctic fauna and flora, covering\r\nthe central parts of Europe, as far south as the Alps and Pyrenees, and\r\neven stretching into Spain. The now temperate regions of the United\r\nStates would likewise be covered by arctic plants and animals and these\r\nwould be nearly the same with those of Europe; for the present\r\ncircumpolar inhabitants, which we suppose to have everywhere travelled\r\nsouthward, are remarkably uniform round the world.\r\n\r\nAs the warmth returned, the arctic forms would retreat northward,\r\nclosely followed up in their retreat by the productions of the more\r\ntemperate regions. And as the snow melted from the bases of the\r\nmountains, the arctic forms would seize on the cleared and thawed\r\nground, always ascending, as the warmth increased and the snow still\r\nfurther disappeared, higher and higher, whilst their brethren were\r\npursuing their northern journey. Hence, when the warmth had fully\r\nreturned, the same species, which had lately lived together on the\r\nEuropean and North American lowlands, would again be found in the\r\narctic regions of the Old and New Worlds, and on many isolated\r\nmountain-summits far distant from each other.\r\n\r\nThus we can understand the identity of many plants at points so\r\nimmensely remote as the mountains of the United States and those of\r\nEurope. We can thus also understand the fact that the Alpine plants of\r\neach mountain-range are more especially related to the arctic forms\r\nliving due north or nearly due north of them: for the first migration\r\nwhen the cold came on, and the re-migration on the returning warmth,\r\nwould generally have been due south and north. The Alpine plants, for\r\nexample, of Scotland, as remarked by Mr. H.C. Watson, and those of the\r\nPyrenees, as remarked by Ramond, are more especially allied to the\r\nplants of northern Scandinavia; those of the United States to Labrador;\r\nthose of the mountains of Siberia to the arctic regions of that\r\ncountry. These views, grounded as they are on the perfectly\r\nwell-ascertained occurrence of a former Glacial period, seem to me to\r\nexplain in so satisfactory a manner the present distribution of the\r\nAlpine and Arctic productions of Europe and America, that when in other\r\nregions we find the same species on distant mountain-summits, we may\r\nalmost conclude, without other evidence, that a colder climate formerly\r\npermitted their migration across the intervening lowlands, now become\r\ntoo warm for their existence.\r\n\r\nAs the arctic forms moved first southward and afterwards backward to\r\nthe north, in unison with the changing climate, they will not have been\r\nexposed during their long migrations to any great diversity of\r\ntemperature; and as they all migrated in a body together, their mutual\r\nrelations will not have been much disturbed. Hence, in accordance with\r\nthe principles inculcated in this volume, these forms will not have\r\nbeen liable to much modification. But with the Alpine productions, left\r\nisolated from the moment of the returning warmth, first at the bases\r\nand ultimately on the summits of the mountains, the case will have been\r\nsomewhat different; for it is not likely that all the same arctic\r\nspecies will have been left on mountain ranges far distant from each\r\nother, and have survived there ever since; they will also, in all\r\nprobability, have become mingled with ancient Alpine species, which\r\nmust have existed on the mountains before the commencement of the\r\nGlacial epoch, and which during the coldest period will have been\r\ntemporarily driven down to the plains; they will, also, have been\r\nsubsequently exposed to somewhat different climatical influences. Their\r\nmutual relations will thus have been in some degree disturbed;\r\nconsequently they will have been liable to modification; and they have\r\nbeen modified; for if we compare the present Alpine plants and animals\r\nof the several great European mountain ranges, one with another, though\r\nmany of the species remain identically the same, some exist as\r\nvarieties, some as doubtful forms or sub-species and some as distinct\r\nyet closely allied species representing each other on the several\r\nranges.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing illustration, I have assumed that at the commencement\r\nof our imaginary Glacial period, the arctic productions were as uniform\r\nround the polar regions as they are at the present day. But it is also\r\nnecessary to assume that many sub-arctic and some few temperate forms\r\nwere the same round the world, for some of the species which now exist\r\non the lower mountain slopes and on the plains of North America and\r\nEurope are the same; and it may be asked how I account for this degree\r\nof uniformity of the sub-arctic and temperate forms round the world, at\r\nthe commencement of the real Glacial period. At the present day, the\r\nsub-arctic and northern temperate productions of the Old and New Worlds\r\nare separated from each other by the whole Atlantic Ocean and by the\r\nnorthern part of the Pacific. During the Glacial period, when the\r\ninhabitants of the Old and New Worlds lived further southwards than\r\nthey do at present, they must have been still more completely separated\r\nfrom each other by wider spaces of ocean; so that it may well be asked\r\nhow the same species could then or previously have entered the two\r\ncontinents. The explanation, I believe, lies in the nature of the\r\nclimate before the commencement of the Glacial period. At this, the\r\nnewer Pliocene period, the majority of the inhabitants of the world\r\nwere specifically the same as now, and we have good reason to believe\r\nthat the climate was warmer than at the present day. Hence, we may\r\nsuppose that the organisms which now live under latitude 60°, lived\r\nduring the Pliocene period further north, under the Polar Circle, in\r\nlatitude 66°–67°; and that the present arctic productions then lived on\r\nthe broken land still nearer to the pole. Now, if we look at a\r\nterrestrial globe, we see under the Polar Circle that there is almost\r\ncontinuous land from western Europe through Siberia, to eastern\r\nAmerica. And this continuity of the circumpolar land, with the\r\nconsequent freedom under a more favourable climate for intermigration,\r\nwill account for the supposed uniformity of the sub-arctic and\r\ntemperate productions of the Old and New Worlds, at a period anterior\r\nto the Glacial epoch.\r\n\r\nBelieving, from reasons before alluded to, that our continents have\r\nlong remained in nearly the same relative position, though subjected to\r\ngreat oscillations of level, I am strongly inclined to extend the above\r\nview, and to infer that during some earlier and still warmer period,\r\nsuch as the older Pliocene period, a large number of the same plants\r\nand animals inhabited the almost continuous circumpolar land; and that\r\nthese plants and animals, both in the Old and New Worlds, began slowly\r\nto migrate southwards as the climate became less warm, long before the\r\ncommencement of the Glacial period. We now see, as I believe, their\r\ndescendants, mostly in a modified condition, in the central parts of\r\nEurope and the United States. On this view we can understand the\r\nrelationship with very little identity, between the productions of\r\nNorth America and Europe—a relationship which is highly remarkable,\r\nconsidering the distance of the two areas, and their separation by the\r\nwhole Atlantic Ocean. We can further understand the singular fact\r\nremarked on by several observers that the productions of Europe and\r\nAmerica during the later tertiary stages were more closely related to\r\neach other than they are at the present time; for during these warmer\r\nperiods the northern parts of the Old and New Worlds will have been\r\nalmost continuously united by land, serving as a bridge, since rendered\r\nimpassable by cold, for the intermigration of their inhabitants.\r\n\r\nDuring the slowly decreasing warmth of the Pliocene period, as soon as\r\nthe species in common, which inhabited the New and Old Worlds, migrated\r\nsouth of the Polar Circle, they will have been completely cut off from\r\neach other. This separation, as far as the more temperate productions\r\nare concerned, must have taken place long ages ago. As the plants and\r\nanimals migrated southward, they will have become mingled in the one\r\ngreat region with the native American productions, and would have had\r\nto compete with them; and in the other great region, with those of the\r\nOld World. Consequently we have here everything favourable for much\r\nmodification—for far more modification than with the Alpine\r\nproductions, left isolated, within a much more recent period, on the\r\nseveral mountain ranges and on the arctic lands of Europe and North\r\nAmerica. Hence, it has come, that when we compare the now living\r\nproductions of the temperate regions of the New and Old Worlds, we find\r\nvery few identical species (though Asa Gray has lately shown that more\r\nplants are identical than was formerly supposed), but we find in every\r\ngreat class many forms, which some naturalists rank as geographical\r\nraces, and others as distinct species; and a host of closely allied or\r\nrepresentative forms which are ranked by all naturalists as\r\nspecifically distinct.\r\n\r\nAs on the land, so in the waters of the sea, a slow southern migration\r\nof a marine fauna, which, during the Pliocene or even a somewhat\r\nearlier period, was nearly uniform along the continuous shores of the\r\nPolar Circle, will account, on the theory of modification, for many\r\nclosely allied forms now living in marine areas completely sundered.\r\nThus, I think, we can understand the presence of some closely allied,\r\nstill existing and extinct tertiary forms, on the eastern and western\r\nshores of temperate North America; and the still more striking fact of\r\nmany closely allied crustaceans (as described in Dana’s admirable\r\nwork), some fish and other marine animals, inhabiting the Mediterranean\r\nand the seas of Japan—these two areas being now completely separated by\r\nthe breadth of a whole continent and by wide spaces of ocean.\r\n\r\nThese cases of close relationship in species either now or formerly\r\ninhabiting the seas on the eastern and western shores of North America,\r\nthe Mediterranean and Japan, and the temperate lands of North America\r\nand Europe, are inexplicable on the theory of creation. We cannot\r\nmaintain that such species have been created alike, in correspondence\r\nwith the nearly similar physical conditions of the areas; for if we\r\ncompare, for instance, certain parts of South America with parts of\r\nSouth Africa or Australia, we see countries closely similar in all\r\ntheir physical conditions, with their inhabitants utterly dissimilar.\r\n\r\n_Alternate Glacial Periods in the North and South._\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we must return to our more immediate subject. I am convinced that\r\nForbes’s view may be largely extended. In Europe we meet with the\r\nplainest evidence of the Glacial period, from the western shores of\r\nBritain to the Ural range, and southward to the Pyrenees. We may infer\r\nfrom the frozen mammals and nature of the mountain vegetation, that\r\nSiberia was similarly affected. In the Lebanon, according to Dr.\r\nHooker, perpetual snow formerly covered the central axis, and fed\r\nglaciers which rolled 4,000 feet down the valleys. The same observer\r\nhas recently found great moraines at a low level on the Atlas range in\r\nNorth Africa. Along the Himalaya, at points 900 miles apart, glaciers\r\nhave left the marks of their former low descent; and in Sikkim, Dr.\r\nHooker saw maize growing on ancient and gigantic moraines. Southward of\r\nthe Asiatic continent, on the opposite side of the equator, we know,\r\nfrom the excellent researches of Dr. J. Haast and Dr. Hector, that in\r\nNew Zealand immense glaciers formerly descended to a low level; and the\r\nsame plants, found by Dr. Hooker on widely separated mountains in this\r\nisland tell the same story of a former cold period. From facts\r\ncommunicated to me by the Rev. W.B. Clarke, it appears also that there\r\nare traces of former glacial action on the mountains of the\r\nsouth-eastern corner of Australia.\r\n\r\nLooking to America: in the northern half, ice-borne fragments of rock\r\nhave been observed on the eastern side of the continent, as far south\r\nas latitude 36° and 37°, and on the shores of the Pacific, where the\r\nclimate is now so different, as far south as latitude 46°. Erratic\r\nboulders have, also, been noticed on the Rocky Mountains. In the\r\nCordillera of South America, nearly under the equator, glaciers once\r\nextended far below their present level. In central Chile I examined a\r\nvast mound of detritus with great boulders, crossing the Portillo\r\nvalley, which, there can hardly be a doubt, once formed a huge moraine;\r\nand Mr. D. Forbes informs me that he found in various parts of the\r\nCordillera, from latitude 13° to 30° south, at about the height of\r\n12,000 feet, deeply-furrowed rocks, resembling those with which he was\r\nfamiliar in Norway, and likewise great masses of detritus, including\r\ngrooved pebbles. Along this whole space of the Cordillera true glaciers\r\ndo not now exist even at much more considerable heights. Further south,\r\non both sides of the continent, from latitude 41° to the southernmost\r\nextremity, we have the clearest evidence of former glacial action, in\r\nnumerous immense boulders transported far from their parent source.\r\n\r\nFrom these several facts, namely, from the glacial action having\r\nextended all round the northern and southern hemispheres—from the\r\nperiod having been in a geological sense recent in both\r\nhemispheres—from its having lasted in both during a great length of\r\ntime, as may be inferred from the amount of work effected—and lastly,\r\nfrom glaciers having recently descended to a low level along the whole\r\nline of the Cordillera, it at one time appeared to me that we could not\r\navoid the conclusion that the temperature of the whole world had been\r\nsimultaneously lowered during the Glacial period. But now, Mr. Croll,\r\nin a series of admirable memoirs, has attempted to show that a glacial\r\ncondition of climate is the result of various physical causes, brought\r\ninto operation by an increase in the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit.\r\nAll these causes tend towards the same end; but the most powerful\r\nappears to be the indirect influence of the eccentricity of the orbit\r\nupon oceanic currents. According to Mr. Croll, cold periods regularly\r\nrecur every ten or fifteen thousand years; and these at long intervals\r\nare extremely severe, owing to certain contingencies, of which the most\r\nimportant, as Sir C. Lyell has shown, is the relative position of the\r\nland and water. Mr. Croll believes that the last great glacial period\r\noccurred about 240,000 years ago, and endured, with slight alterations\r\nof climate, for about 160,000 years. With respect to more ancient\r\nglacial periods, several geologists are convinced, from direct\r\nevidence, that such occurred during the miocene and eocene formations,\r\nnot to mention still more ancient formations. But the most important\r\nresult for us, arrived at by Mr. Croll, is that whenever the northern\r\nhemisphere passes through a cold period the temperature of the southern\r\nhemisphere is actually raised, with the winters rendered much milder,\r\nchiefly through changes in the direction of the ocean currents. So\r\nconversely it will be with the northern hemisphere, while the southern\r\npasses through a glacial period. This conclusion throws so much light\r\non geographical distribution that I am strongly inclined to trust in\r\nit; but I will first give the facts which demand an explanation.\r\n\r\nIn South America, Dr. Hooker has shown that besides many closely allied\r\nspecies, between forty and fifty of the flowering plants of Tierra del\r\nFuego, forming no inconsiderable part of its scanty flora, are common\r\nto North America and Europe, enormously remote as these areas in\r\nopposite hemispheres are from each other. On the lofty mountains of\r\nequatorial America a host of peculiar species belonging to European\r\ngenera occur. On the Organ Mountains of Brazil some few temperate\r\nEuropean, some Antarctic and some Andean genera were found by Gardner\r\nwhich do not exist in the low intervening hot countries. On the Silla\r\nof Caraccas the illustrious Humboldt long ago found species belonging\r\nto genera characteristic of the Cordillera.\r\n\r\nIn Africa, several forms characteristic of Europe, and some few\r\nrepresentatives of the flora of the Cape of Good Hope, occur on the\r\nmountains of Abyssinia. At the Cape of Good Hope a very few European\r\nspecies, believed not to have been introduced by man, and on the\r\nmountains several representative European forms are found which have\r\nnot been discovered in the intertropical parts of Africa. Dr. Hooker\r\nhas also lately shown that several of the plants living on the upper\r\nparts of the lofty island of Fernando Po, and on the neighbouring\r\nCameroon Mountains, in the Gulf of Guinea, are closely related to those\r\non the mountains of Abyssinia, and likewise to those of temperate\r\nEurope. It now also appears, as I hear from Dr. Hooker, that some of\r\nthese same temperate plants have been discovered by the Rev. R.T. Lowe\r\non the mountains of the Cape Verde Islands. This extension of the same\r\ntemperate forms, almost under the equator, across the whole continent\r\nof Africa and to the mountains of the Cape Verde archipelago, is one of\r\nthe most astonishing facts ever recorded in the distribution of plants.\r\n\r\nOn the Himalaya, and on the isolated mountain ranges of the peninsula\r\nof India, on the heights of Ceylon, and on the volcanic cones of Java,\r\nmany plants occur either identically the same or representing each\r\nother, and at the same time representing plants of Europe not found in\r\nthe intervening hot lowlands. A list of the genera of plants collected\r\non the loftier peaks of Java, raises a picture of a collection made on\r\na hillock in Europe. Still more striking is the fact that peculiar\r\nAustralian forms are represented by certain plants growing on the\r\nsummits of the mountains of Borneo. Some of these Australian forms, as\r\nI hear from Dr. Hooker, extend along the heights of the peninsula of\r\nMalacca, and are thinly scattered on the one hand over India, and on\r\nthe other hand as far north as Japan.\r\n\r\nOn the southern mountains of Australia, Dr. F. Müller has discovered\r\nseveral European species; other species, not introduced by man, occur\r\non the lowlands; and a long list can be given, as I am informed by Dr.\r\nHooker, of European genera, found in Australia, but not in the\r\nintermediate torrid regions. In the admirable “Introduction to the\r\nFlora of New Zealand,” by Dr. Hooker, analogous and striking facts are\r\ngiven in regard to the plants of that large island. Hence, we see that\r\ncertain plants growing on the more lofty mountains of the tropics in\r\nall parts of the world, and on the temperate plains of the north and\r\nsouth, are either the same species or varieties of the same species. It\r\nshould, however, be observed that these plants are not strictly arctic\r\nforms; for, as Mr. H.C. Watson has remarked, “in receding from polar\r\ntoward equatorial latitudes, the Alpine or mountain flora really become\r\nless and less Arctic.” Besides these identical and closely allied\r\nforms, many species inhabiting the same widely sundered areas, belong\r\nto genera not now found in the intermediate tropical lowlands.\r\n\r\nThese brief remarks apply to plants alone; but some few analogous facts\r\ncould be given in regard to terrestrial animals. In marine productions,\r\nsimilar cases likewise occur; as an example, I may quote a statement by\r\nthe highest authority, Prof. Dana, that “it is certainly a wonderful\r\nfact that New Zealand should have a closer resemblance in its crustacea\r\nto Great Britain, its antipode, than to any other part of the world.”\r\nSir J. Richardson, also, speaks of the reappearance on the shores of\r\nNew Zealand, Tasmania, &c., of northern forms of fish. Dr. Hooker\r\ninforms me that twenty-five species of Algæ are common to New Zealand\r\nand to Europe, but have not been found in the intermediate tropical\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing facts, namely, the presence of temperate forms on\r\nthe highlands across the whole of equatorial Africa, and along the\r\nPeninsula of India, to Ceylon and the Malay Archipelago, and in a less\r\nwell-marked manner across the wide expanse of tropical South America,\r\nit appears almost certain that at some former period, no doubt during\r\nthe most severe part of a Glacial period, the lowlands of these great\r\ncontinents were everywhere tenanted under the equator by a considerable\r\nnumber of temperate forms. At this period the equatorial climate at the\r\nlevel of the sea was probably about the same with that now experienced\r\nat the height of from five to six thousand feet under the same\r\nlatitude, or perhaps even rather cooler. During this, the coldest\r\nperiod, the lowlands under the equator must have been clothed with a\r\nmingled tropical and temperate vegetation, like that described by\r\nHooker as growing luxuriantly at the height of from four to five\r\nthousand feet on the lower slopes of the Himalaya, but with perhaps a\r\nstill greater preponderance of temperate forms. So again in the\r\nmountainous island of Fernando Po, in the Gulf of Guinea, Mr. Mann\r\nfound temperate European forms beginning to appear at the height of\r\nabout five thousand feet. On the mountains of Panama, at the height of\r\nonly two thousand feet, Dr. Seemann found the vegetation like that of\r\nMexico, “with forms of the torrid zone harmoniously blended with those\r\nof the temperate.”\r\n\r\nNow let us see whether Mr. Croll’s conclusion that when the northern\r\nhemisphere suffered from the extreme cold of the great Glacial period,\r\nthe southern hemisphere was actually warmer, throws any clear light on\r\nthe present apparently inexplicable distribution of various organisms\r\nin the temperate parts of both hemispheres, and on the mountains of the\r\ntropics. The Glacial period, as measured by years, must have been very\r\nlong; and when we remember over what vast spaces some naturalised\r\nplants and animals have spread within a few centuries, this period will\r\nhave been ample for any amount of migration. As the cold became more\r\nand more intense, we know that Arctic forms invaded the temperate\r\nregions; and from the facts just given, there can hardly be a doubt\r\nthat some of the more vigorous, dominant and widest-spreading temperate\r\nforms invaded the equatorial lowlands. The inhabitants of these hot\r\nlowlands would at the same time have migrated to the tropical and\r\nsubtropical regions of the south, for the southern hemisphere was at\r\nthis period warmer. On the decline of the Glacial period, as both\r\nhemispheres gradually recovered their former temperature, the northern\r\ntemperate forms living on the lowlands under the equator, would have\r\nbeen driven to their former homes or have been destroyed, being\r\nreplaced by the equatorial forms returning from the south. Some,\r\nhowever, of the northern temperate forms would almost certainly have\r\nascended any adjoining high land, where, if sufficiently lofty, they\r\nwould have long survived like the Arctic forms on the mountains of\r\nEurope. They might have survived, even if the climate was not perfectly\r\nfitted for them, for the change of temperature must have been very\r\nslow, and plants undoubtedly possess a certain capacity for\r\nacclimatisation, as shown by their transmitting to their offspring\r\ndifferent constitutional powers of resisting heat and cold.\r\n\r\nIn the regular course of events the southern hemisphere would in its\r\nturn be subjected to a severe Glacial period, with the northern\r\nhemisphere rendered warmer; and then the southern temperate forms would\r\ninvade the equatorial lowlands. The northern forms which had before\r\nbeen left on the mountains would now descend and mingle with the\r\nsouthern forms. These latter, when the warmth returned, would return to\r\ntheir former homes, leaving some few species on the mountains, and\r\ncarrying southward with them some of the northern temperate forms which\r\nhad descended from their mountain fastnesses. Thus, we should have some\r\nfew species identically the same in the northern and southern temperate\r\nzones and on the mountains of the intermediate tropical regions. But\r\nthe species left during a long time on these mountains, or in opposite\r\nhemispheres, would have to compete with many new forms and would be\r\nexposed to somewhat different physical conditions; hence, they would be\r\neminently liable to modification, and would generally now exist as\r\nvarieties or as representative species; and this is the case. We must,\r\nalso, bear in mind the occurrence in both hemispheres of former Glacial\r\nperiods; for these will account, in accordance with the same\r\nprinciples, for the many quite distinct species inhabiting the same\r\nwidely separated areas, and belonging to genera not now found in the\r\nintermediate torrid zones.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact, strongly insisted on by Hooker in regard to\r\nAmerica, and by Alph. de Candolle in regard to Australia, that many\r\nmore identical or slightly modified species have migrated from the\r\nnorth to the south, than in a reversed direction. We see, however, a\r\nfew southern forms on the mountains of Borneo and Abyssinia. I suspect\r\nthat this preponderant migration from the north to the south is due to\r\nthe greater extent of land in the north, and to the northern forms\r\nhaving existed in their own homes in greater numbers, and having\r\nconsequently been advanced through natural selection and competition to\r\na higher stage of perfection, or dominating power, than the southern\r\nforms. And thus, when the two sets became commingled in the equatorial\r\nregions, during the alternations of the Glacial periods, the northern\r\nforms were the more powerful and were able to hold their places on the\r\nmountains, and afterwards migrate southward with the southern forms;\r\nbut not so the southern in regard to the northern forms. In the same\r\nmanner, at the present day, we see that very many European productions\r\ncover the ground in La Plata, New Zealand, and to a lesser degree in\r\nAustralia, and have beaten the natives; whereas extremely few southern\r\nforms have become naturalised in any part of the northern hemisphere,\r\nthough hides, wool, and other objects likely to carry seeds have been\r\nlargely imported into Europe during the last two or three centuries\r\nfrom La Plata and during the last forty or fifty years from Australia.\r\nThe Neilgherrie Mountains in India, however, offer a partial exception;\r\nfor here, as I hear from Dr. Hooker, Australian forms are rapidly\r\nsowing themselves and becoming naturalised. Before the last great\r\nGlacial period, no doubt the intertropical mountains were stocked with\r\nendemic Alpine forms; but these have almost everywhere yielded to the\r\nmore dominant forms generated in the larger areas and more efficient\r\nworkshops of the north. In many islands the native productions are\r\nnearly equalled, or even outnumbered, by those which have become\r\nnaturalised; and this is the first stage towards their extinction.\r\nMountains are islands on the land; and their inhabitants have yielded\r\nto those produced within the larger areas of the north, just in the\r\nsame way as the inhabitants of real islands have everywhere yielded and\r\nare still yielding to continental forms naturalised through man’s\r\nagency.\r\n\r\nThe same principles apply to the distribution of terrestrial animals\r\nand of marine productions, in the northern and southern temperate\r\nzones, and on the intertropical mountains. When, during the height of\r\nthe Glacial period, the ocean-currents were widely different to what\r\nthey now are, some of the inhabitants of the temperate seas might have\r\nreached the equator; of these a few would perhaps at once be able to\r\nmigrate southwards, by keeping to the cooler currents, while others\r\nmight remain and survive in the colder depths until the southern\r\nhemisphere was in its turn subjected to a glacial climate and permitted\r\ntheir further progress; in nearly the same manner as, according to\r\nForbes, isolated spaces inhabited by Arctic productions exist to the\r\npresent day in the deeper parts of the northern temperate seas.\r\n\r\nI am far from supposing that all the difficulties in regard to the\r\ndistribution and affinities of the identical and allied species, which\r\nnow live so widely separated in the north and south, and sometimes on\r\nthe intermediate mountain ranges, are removed on the views above given.\r\nThe exact lines of migration cannot be indicated. We cannot say why\r\ncertain species and not others have migrated; why certain species have\r\nbeen modified and have given rise to new forms, while others have\r\nremained unaltered. We cannot hope to explain such facts, until we can\r\nsay why one species and not another becomes naturalised by man’s agency\r\nin a foreign land; why one species ranges twice or thrice as far, and\r\nis twice or thrice as common, as another species within their own\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\nVarious special difficulties also remain to be solved; for instance,\r\nthe occurrence, as shown by Dr. Hooker, of the same plants at points so\r\nenormously remote as Kerguelen Land, New Zealand, and Fuegia; but\r\nicebergs, as suggested by Lyell, may have been concerned in their\r\ndispersal. The existence at these and other distant points of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, of species, which, though distinct, belong to\r\ngenera exclusively confined to the south, is a more remarkable case.\r\nSome of these species are so distinct, that we cannot suppose that\r\nthere has been time since the commencement of the last Glacial period\r\nfor their migration and subsequent modification to the necessary\r\ndegree. The facts seem to indicate that distinct species belonging to\r\nthe same genera have migrated in radiating lines from a common centre;\r\nand I am inclined to look in the southern, as in the northern\r\nhemisphere, to a former and warmer period, before the commencement of\r\nthe last Glacial period, when the Antarctic lands, now covered with\r\nice, supported a highly peculiar and isolated flora. It may be\r\nsuspected that before this flora was exterminated during the last\r\nGlacial epoch, a few forms had been already widely dispersed to various\r\npoints of the southern hemisphere by occasional means of transport, and\r\nby the aid, as halting-places, of now sunken islands. Thus the southern\r\nshores of America, Australia, and New Zealand may have become slightly\r\ntinted by the same peculiar forms of life.\r\n\r\nSir C. Lyell in a striking passage has speculated, in language almost\r\nidentical with mine, on the effects of great alternations of climate\r\nthroughout the world on geographical distribution. And we have now seen\r\nthat Mr. Croll’s conclusion that successive Glacial periods in the one\r\nhemisphere coincide with warmer periods in the opposite hemisphere,\r\ntogether with the admission of the slow modification of species,\r\nexplains a multitude of facts in the distribution of the same and of\r\nthe allied forms of life in all parts of the globe. The living waters\r\nhave flowed during one period from the north and during another from\r\nthe south, and in both cases have reached the equator; but the stream\r\nof life has flowed with greater force from the north than in the\r\nopposite direction, and has consequently more freely inundated the\r\nsouth. As the tide leaves its drift in horizontal lines, rising higher\r\non the shores where the tide rises highest, so have the living waters\r\nleft their living drift on our mountain summits, in a line gently\r\nrising from the Arctic lowlands to a great latitude under the equator.\r\nThe various beings thus left stranded may be compared with savage races\r\nof man, driven up and surviving in the mountain fastnesses of almost\r\nevery land, which serves as a record, full of interest to us, of the\r\nformer inhabitants of the surrounding lowlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION—_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDistribution of fresh-water productions—On the inhabitants of oceanic\r\nislands—Absence of Batrachians and of terrestrial Mammals—On the\r\nrelation of the inhabitants of islands to those of the nearest\r\nmainland—On colonisation from the nearest source with subsequent\r\nmodification—Summary of the last and present chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fresh-water Productions._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs lakes and river-systems are separated from each other by barriers of\r\nland, it might have been thought that fresh-water productions would not\r\nhave ranged widely within the same country, and as the sea is\r\napparently a still more formidable barrier, that they would never have\r\nextended to distant countries. But the case is exactly the reverse. Not\r\nonly have many fresh-water species, belonging to different classes, an\r\nenormous range, but allied species prevail in a remarkable manner\r\nthroughout the world. When first collecting in the fresh waters of\r\nBrazil, I well remember feeling much surprise at the similarity of the\r\nfresh-water insects, shells, &c., and at the dissimilarity of the\r\nsurrounding terrestrial beings, compared with those of Britain.\r\n\r\nBut the wide ranging power of fresh-water productions can, I think, in\r\nmost cases be explained by their having become fitted, in a manner\r\nhighly useful to them, for short and frequent migrations from pond to\r\npond, or from stream to stream, within their own countries; and\r\nliability to wide dispersal would follow from this capacity as an\r\nalmost necessary consequence. We can here consider only a few cases; of\r\nthese, some of the most difficult to explain are presented by fish. It\r\nwas formerly believed that the same fresh-water species never existed\r\non two continents distant from each other. But Dr. Günther has lately\r\nshown that the Galaxias attenuatus inhabits Tasmania, New Zealand, the\r\nFalkland Islands and the mainland of South America. This is a wonderful\r\ncase, and probably indicates dispersal from an Antarctic centre during\r\na former warm period. This case, however, is rendered in some degree\r\nless surprising by the species of this genus having the power of\r\ncrossing by some unknown means considerable spaces of open ocean: thus\r\nthere is one species common to New Zealand and to the Auckland Islands,\r\nthough separated by a distance of about 230 miles. On the same\r\ncontinent fresh-water fish often range widely, and as if capriciously;\r\nfor in two adjoining river systems some of the species may be the same\r\nand some wholly different.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that they are occasionally transported by what may be\r\ncalled accidental means. Thus fishes still alive are not very rarely\r\ndropped at distant points by whirlwinds; and it is known that the ova\r\nretain their vitality for a considerable time after removal from the\r\nwater. Their dispersal may, however, be mainly attributed to changes in\r\nthe level of the land within the recent period, causing rivers to flow\r\ninto each other. Instances, also, could be given of this having\r\noccurred during floods, without any change of level. The wide\r\ndifferences of the fish on the opposite sides of most mountain-ranges,\r\nwhich are continuous and consequently must, from an early period, have\r\ncompletely prevented the inosculation of the river systems on the two\r\nsides, leads to the same conclusion. Some fresh-water fish belong to\r\nvery ancient forms, and in such cases there will have been ample time\r\nfor great geographical changes, and consequently time and means for\r\nmuch migration. Moreover, Dr. Günther has recently been led by several\r\nconsiderations to infer that with fishes the same forms have a long\r\nendurance. Salt-water fish can with care be slowly accustomed to live\r\nin fresh water; and, according to Valenciennes, there is hardly a\r\nsingle group of which all the members are confined to fresh water, so\r\nthat a marine species belonging to a fresh-water group might travel far\r\nalong the shores of the sea, and could, it is probable, become adapted\r\nwithout much difficulty to the fresh waters of a distant land.\r\n\r\nSome species of fresh-water shells have very wide ranges, and allied\r\nspecies which, on our theory, are descended from a common parent, and\r\nmust have proceeded from a single source, prevail throughout the world.\r\nTheir distribution at first perplexed me much, as their ova are not\r\nlikely to be transported by birds; and the ova, as well as the adults,\r\nare immediately killed by sea-water. I could not even understand how\r\nsome naturalised species have spread rapidly throughout the same\r\ncountry. But two facts, which I have observed—and many others no doubt\r\nwill be discovered—throw some light on this subject. When ducks\r\nsuddenly emerge from a pond covered with duck-weed, I have twice seen\r\nthese little plants adhering to their backs; and it has happened to me,\r\nin removing a little duck-weed from one aquarium to another, that I\r\nhave unintentionally stocked the one with fresh-water shells from the\r\nother. But another agency is perhaps more effectual: I suspended the\r\nfeet of a duck in an aquarium, where many ova of fresh-water shells\r\nwere hatching; and I found that numbers of the extremely minute and\r\njust-hatched shells crawled on the feet, and clung to them so firmly\r\nthat when taken out of the water they could not be jarred off, though\r\nat a somewhat more advanced age they would voluntarily drop off. These\r\njust-hatched molluscs, though aquatic in their nature, survived on the\r\nduck’s feet, in damp air, from twelve to twenty hours; and in this\r\nlength of time a duck or heron might fly at least six or seven hundred\r\nmiles, and if blown across the sea to an oceanic island, or to any\r\nother distant point, would be sure to alight on a pool or rivulet. Sir\r\nCharles Lyell informs me that a Dyticus has been caught with an Ancylus\r\n(a fresh-water shell like a limpet) firmly adhering to it; and a\r\nwater-beetle of the same family, a Colymbetes, once flew on board the\r\n“Beagle,” when forty-five miles distant from the nearest land: how much\r\nfarther it might have been blown by a favouring gale no one can tell.\r\n\r\nWith respect to plants, it has long been known what enormous ranges\r\nmany fresh-water, and even marsh-species, have, both over continents\r\nand to the most remote oceanic islands. This is strikingly illustrated,\r\naccording to Alph. de Candolle, in those large groups of terrestrial\r\nplants, which have very few aquatic members; for the latter seem\r\nimmediately to acquire, as if in consequence, a wide range. I think\r\nfavourable means of dispersal explain this fact. I have before\r\nmentioned that earth occasionally adheres in some quantity to the feet\r\nand beaks of birds. Wading birds, which frequent the muddy edges of\r\nponds, if suddenly flushed, would be the most likely to have muddy\r\nfeet. Birds of this order wander more than those of any other; and are\r\noccasionally found on the most remote and barren islands of the open\r\nocean; they would not be likely to alight on the surface of the sea, so\r\nthat any dirt on their feet would not be washed off; and when gaining\r\nthe land, they would be sure to fly to their natural fresh-water\r\nhaunts. I do not believe that botanists are aware how charged the mud\r\nof ponds is with seeds: I have tried several little experiments, but\r\nwill here give only the most striking case: I took in February three\r\ntablespoonfuls of mud from three different points, beneath water, on\r\nthe edge of a little pond; this mud when dry weighed only 6 and 3/4\r\nounces; I kept it covered up in my study for six months, pulling up and\r\ncounting each plant as it grew; the plants were of many kinds, and were\r\naltogether 537 in number; and yet the viscid mud was all contained in a\r\nbreakfast cup! Considering these facts, I think it would be an\r\ninexplicable circumstance if water-birds did not transport the seeds of\r\nfresh-water plants to unstocked ponds and streams, situated at very\r\ndistant points. The same agency may have come into play with the eggs\r\nof some of the smaller fresh-water animals.\r\n\r\nOther and unknown agencies probably have also played a part. I have\r\nstated that fresh-water fish eat some kinds of seeds, though they\r\nreject many other kinds after having swallowed them; even small fish\r\nswallow seeds of moderate size, as of the yellow water-lily and\r\nPotamogeton. Herons and other birds, century after century, have gone\r\non daily devouring fish; they then take flight and go to other waters,\r\nor are blown across the sea; and we have seen that seeds retain their\r\npower of germination, when rejected many hours afterwards in pellets or\r\nin the excrement. When I saw the great size of the seeds of that fine\r\nwater-lily, the Nelumbium, and remembered Alph. de Candolle’s remarks\r\non the distribution of this plant, I thought that the means of its\r\ndispersal must remain inexplicable; but Audubon states that he found\r\nthe seeds of the great southern water-lily (probably according to Dr.\r\nHooker, the Nelumbium luteum) in a heron’s stomach. Now this bird must\r\noften have flown with its stomach thus well stocked to distant ponds,\r\nand, then getting a hearty meal of fish, analogy makes me believe that\r\nit would have rejected the seeds in the pellet in a fit state for\r\ngermination.\r\n\r\nIn considering these several means of distribution, it should be\r\nremembered that when a pond or stream is first formed, for instance on\r\na rising islet, it will be unoccupied; and a single seed or egg will\r\nhave a good chance of succeeding. Although there will always be a\r\nstruggle for life between the inhabitants of the same pond, however few\r\nin kind, yet as the number even in a well-stocked pond is small in\r\ncomparison with the number of species inhabiting an equal area of land,\r\nthe competition between them will probably be less severe than between\r\nterrestrial species; consequently an intruder from the waters of a\r\nforeign country would have a better chance of seizing on a new place,\r\nthan in the case of terrestrial colonists. We should also remember that\r\nmany fresh-water productions are low in the scale of nature, and we\r\nhave reason to believe that such beings become modified more slowly\r\nthan the high; and this will give time for the migration of aquatic\r\nspecies. We should not forget the probability of many fresh-water forms\r\nhaving formerly ranged continuously over immense areas, and then having\r\nbecome extinct at intermediate points. But the wide distribution of\r\nfresh-water plants, and of the lower animals, whether retaining the\r\nsame identical form, or in some degree modified, apparently depends in\r\nmain part on the wide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals,\r\nmore especially by fresh-water birds, which have great powers of\r\nflight, and naturally travel from one piece of water to another.\r\n\r\n_On the Inhabitants of Oceanic Islands._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to the last of the three classes of facts, which I have\r\nselected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty with respect\r\nto distribution, on the view that not only all the individuals of the\r\nsame species have migrated from some one area, but that allied species,\r\nalthough now inhabiting the most distant points, have proceeded from a\r\nsingle area, the birthplace of their early progenitors. I have already\r\ngiven my reasons for disbelieving in continental extensions within the\r\nperiod of existing species on so enormous a scale that all the many\r\nislands of the several oceans were thus stocked with their present\r\nterrestrial inhabitants. This view removes many difficulties, but it\r\ndoes not accord with all the facts in regard to the productions of\r\nislands. In the following remarks I shall not confine myself to the\r\nmere question of dispersal, but shall consider some other cases bearing\r\non the truth of the two theories of independent creation and of descent\r\nwith modification.\r\n\r\nThe species of all kinds which inhabit oceanic islands are few in\r\nnumber compared with those on equal continental areas: Alph. de\r\nCandolle admits this for plants, and Wollaston for insects. New\r\nZealand, for instance, with its lofty mountains and diversified\r\nstations, extending over 780 miles of latitude, together with the\r\noutlying islands of Auckland, Campbell and Chatham, contain altogether\r\nonly 960 kinds of flowering plants; if we compare this moderate number\r\nwith the species which swarm over equal areas in Southwestern Australia\r\nor at the Cape of Good Hope, we must admit that some cause,\r\nindependently of different physical conditions, has given rise to so\r\ngreat a difference in number. Even the uniform county of Cambridge has\r\n847 plants, and the little island of Anglesea 764, but a few ferns and\r\na few introduced plants are included in these numbers, and the\r\ncomparison in some other respects is not quite fair. We have evidence\r\nthat the barren island of Ascension aboriginally possessed less than\r\nhalf-a-dozen flowering plants; yet many species have now become\r\nnaturalised on it, as they have in New Zealand and on every other\r\noceanic island which can be named. In St. Helena there is reason to\r\nbelieve that the naturalised plants and animals have nearly or quite\r\nexterminated many native productions. He who admits the doctrine of the\r\ncreation of each separate species, will have to admit that a sufficient\r\nnumber of the best adapted plants and animals were not created for\r\noceanic islands; for man has unintentionally stocked them far more\r\nfully and perfectly than did nature.\r\n\r\nAlthough in oceanic islands the species are few in number, the\r\nproportion of endemic kinds (_i.e._ those found nowhere else in the\r\nworld) is often extremely large. If we compare, for instance, the\r\nnumber of endemic land-shells in Madeira, or of endemic birds in the\r\nGalapagos Archipelago, with the number found on any continent, and then\r\ncompare the area of the island with that of the continent, we shall see\r\nthat this is true. This fact might have been theoretically expected,\r\nfor, as already explained, species occasionally arriving, after long\r\nintervals of time in the new and isolated district, and having to\r\ncompete with new associates, would be eminently liable to modification,\r\nand would often produce groups of modified descendants. But it by no\r\nmeans follows that, because in an island nearly all the species of one\r\nclass are peculiar, those of another class, or of another section of\r\nthe same class, are peculiar; and this difference seems to depend\r\npartly on the species which are not modified having immigrated in a\r\nbody, so that their mutual relations have not been much disturbed; and\r\npartly on the frequent arrival of unmodified immigrants from the\r\nmother-country, with which the insular forms have intercrossed. It\r\nshould be borne in mind that the offspring of such crosses would\r\ncertainly gain in vigour; so that even an occasional cross would\r\nproduce more effect than might have been anticipated. I will give a few\r\nillustrations of the foregoing remarks: in the Galapagos Islands there\r\nare twenty-six land birds; of these twenty-one (or perhaps\r\ntwenty-three) are peculiar; whereas of the eleven marine birds only two\r\nare peculiar; and it is obvious that marine birds could arrive at these\r\nislands much more easily and frequently than land-birds. Bermuda, on\r\nthe other hand, which lies at about the same distance from North\r\nAmerica as the Galapagos Islands do from South America, and which has a\r\nvery peculiar soil, does not possess a single endemic land bird; and we\r\nknow from Mr. J.M. Jones’s admirable account of Bermuda, that very many\r\nNorth American birds occasionally or even frequently visit this island.\r\nAlmost every year, as I am informed by Mr. E.V. Harcourt, many European\r\nand African birds are blown to Madeira; this island is inhabited by\r\nninety-nine kinds, of which one alone is peculiar, though very closely\r\nrelated to a European form; and three or four other species are\r\nconfined to this island and to the Canaries. So that the islands of\r\nBermuda and Madeira have been stocked from the neighbouring continents\r\nwith birds, which for long ages have there struggled together, and have\r\nbecome mutually co-adapted. Hence, when settled in their new homes,\r\neach kind will have been kept by the others to its proper place and\r\nhabits, and will consequently have been but little liable to\r\nmodification. Any tendency to modification will also have been checked\r\nby intercrossing with the unmodified immigrants, often arriving from\r\nthe mother-country. Madeira again is inhabited by a wonderful number of\r\npeculiar land-shells, whereas not one species of sea-shell is peculiar\r\nto its shores: now, though we do not know how sea-shells are dispersed,\r\nyet we can see that their eggs or larvæ, perhaps attached to seaweed or\r\nfloating timber, or to the feet of wading birds, might be transported\r\nacross three or four hundred miles of open sea far more easily than\r\nland-shells. The different orders of insects inhabiting Madeira present\r\nnearly parallel cases.\r\n\r\nOceanic islands are sometimes deficient in animals of certain whole\r\nclasses, and their places are occupied by other classes; thus in the\r\nGalapagos Islands reptiles, and in New Zealand gigantic wingless birds,\r\ntake, or recently took, the place of mammals. Although New Zealand is\r\nhere spoken of as an oceanic island, it is in some degree doubtful\r\nwhether it should be so ranked; it is of large size, and is not\r\nseparated from Australia by a profoundly deep sea; from its geological\r\ncharacter and the direction of its mountain ranges, the Rev. W.B.\r\nClarke has lately maintained that this island, as well as New\r\nCaledonia, should be considered as appurtenances of Australia. Turning\r\nto plants, Dr. Hooker has shown that in the Galapagos Islands the\r\nproportional numbers of the different orders are very different from\r\nwhat they are elsewhere. All such differences in number, and the\r\nabsence of certain whole groups of animals and plants, are generally\r\naccounted for by supposed differences in the physical conditions of the\r\nislands; but this explanation is not a little doubtful. Facility of\r\nimmigration seems to have been fully as important as the nature of the\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nMany remarkable little facts could be given with respect to the\r\ninhabitants of oceanic islands. For instance, in certain islands not\r\ntenanted by a single mammal, some of the endemic plants have\r\nbeautifully hooked seeds; yet few relations are more manifest than that\r\nhooks serve for the transportal of seeds in the wool or fur of\r\nquadrupeds. But a hooked seed might be carried to an island by other\r\nmeans; and the plant then becoming modified would form an endemic\r\nspecies, still retaining its hooks, which would form a useless\r\nappendage, like the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of\r\nmany insular beetles. Again, islands often possess trees or bushes\r\nbelonging to orders which elsewhere include only herbaceous species;\r\nnow trees, as Alph. de Candolle has shown, generally have, whatever the\r\ncause may be, confined ranges. Hence trees would be little likely to\r\nreach distant oceanic islands; and an herbaceous plant, which had no\r\nchance of successfully competing with the many fully developed trees\r\ngrowing on a continent, might, when established on an island, gain an\r\nadvantage over other herbaceous plants by growing taller and taller and\r\novertopping them. In this case, natural selection would tend to add to\r\nthe stature of the plant, to whatever order it belonged, and thus first\r\nconvert it into a bush and then into a tree.\r\n\r\n_Absence of Batrachians and Terrestrial mammals on Oceanic Islands._\r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to the absence of whole orders of animals on oceanic\r\nislands, Bory St. Vincent long ago remarked that Batrachians (frogs,\r\ntoads, newts) are never found on any of the many islands with which the\r\ngreat oceans are studded. I have taken pains to verify this assertion,\r\nand have found it true, with the exception of New Zealand, New\r\nCaledonia, the Andaman Islands, and perhaps the Solomon Islands and the\r\nSeychelles. But I have already remarked that it is doubtful whether New\r\nZealand and New Caledonia ought to be classed as oceanic islands; and\r\nthis is still more doubtful with respect to the Andaman and Solomon\r\ngroups and the Seychelles. This general absence of frogs, toads and\r\nnewts on so many true oceanic islands cannot be accounted for by their\r\nphysical conditions; indeed it seems that islands are peculiarly fitted\r\nfor these animals; for frogs have been introduced into Madeira, the\r\nAzores, and Mauritius, and have multiplied so as to become a nuisance.\r\nBut as these animals and their spawn are immediately killed (with the\r\nexception, as far as known, of one Indian species) by sea-water, there\r\nwould be great difficulty in their transportal across the sea, and\r\ntherefore we can see why they do not exist on strictly oceanic islands.\r\nBut why, on the theory of creation, they should not have been created\r\nthere, it would be very difficult to explain.\r\n\r\nMammals offer another and similar case. I have carefully searched the\r\noldest voyages, and have not found a single instance, free from doubt,\r\nof a terrestrial mammal (excluding domesticated animals kept by the\r\nnatives) inhabiting an island situated above 300 miles from a continent\r\nor great continental island; and many islands situated at a much less\r\ndistance are equally barren. The Falkland Islands, which are inhabited\r\nby a wolf-like fox, come nearest to an exception; but this group cannot\r\nbe considered as oceanic, as it lies on a bank in connection with the\r\nmainland at a distance of about 280 miles; moreover, icebergs formerly\r\nbrought boulders to its western shores, and they may have formerly\r\ntransported foxes, as now frequently happens in the arctic regions. Yet\r\nit cannot be said that small islands will not support at least small\r\nmammals, for they occur in many parts of the world on very small\r\nislands, when lying close to a continent; and hardly an island can be\r\nnamed on which our smaller quadrupeds have not become naturalised and\r\ngreatly multiplied. It cannot be said, on the ordinary view of\r\ncreation, that there has not been time for the creation of mammals;\r\nmany volcanic islands are sufficiently ancient, as shown by the\r\nstupendous degradation which they have suffered, and by their tertiary\r\nstrata: there has also been time for the production of endemic species\r\nbelonging to other classes; and on continents it is known that new\r\nspecies of mammals appear and disappear at a quicker rate than other\r\nand lower animals. Although terrestrial mammals do not occur on oceanic\r\nislands, aërial mammals do occur on almost every island. New Zealand\r\npossesses two bats found nowhere else in the world: Norfolk Island, the\r\nViti Archipelago, the Bonin Islands, the Caroline and Marianne\r\nArchipelagoes, and Mauritius, all possess their peculiar bats. Why, it\r\nmay be asked, has the supposed creative force produced bats and no\r\nother mammals on remote islands? On my view this question can easily be\r\nanswered; for no terrestrial mammal can be transported across a wide\r\nspace of sea, but bats can fly across. Bats have been seen wandering by\r\nday far over the Atlantic Ocean; and two North American species, either\r\nregularly or occasionally, visit Bermuda, at the distance of 600 miles\r\nfrom the mainland. I hear from Mr. Tomes, who has specially studied\r\nthis family, that many species have enormous ranges, and are found on\r\ncontinents and on far distant islands. Hence, we have only to suppose\r\nthat such wandering species have been modified in their new homes in\r\nrelation to their new position, and we can understand the presence of\r\nendemic bats on oceanic islands, with the absence of all other\r\nterrestrial mammals.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting relation exists, namely, between the depth of the\r\nsea separating islands from each other, or from the nearest continent,\r\nand the degree of affinity of their mammalian inhabitants. Mr. Windsor\r\nEarl has made some striking observations on this head, since greatly\r\nextended by Mr. Wallace’s admirable researches, in regard to the great\r\nMalay Archipelago, which is traversed near Celebes by a space of deep\r\nocean, and this separates two widely distinct mammalian faunas. On\r\neither side, the islands stand on a moderately shallow submarine bank,\r\nand these islands are inhabited by the same or by closely allied\r\nquadrupeds. I have not as yet had time to follow up this subject in all\r\nquarters of the world; but as far as I have gone, the relation holds\r\ngood. For instance, Britain is separated by a shallow channel from\r\nEurope, and the mammals are the same on both sides; and so it is with\r\nall the islands near the shores of Australia. The West Indian Islands,\r\non the other hand, stand on a deeply submerged bank, nearly one\r\nthousand fathoms in depth, and here we find American forms, but the\r\nspecies and even the genera are quite distinct. As the amount of\r\nmodification which animals of all kinds undergo partly depends on the\r\nlapse of time, and as the islands which are separated from each other,\r\nor from the mainland, by shallow channels, are more likely to have been\r\ncontinuously united within a recent period than the islands separated\r\nby deeper channels, we can understand how it is that a relation exists\r\nbetween the depth of the sea separating two mammalian faunas, and the\r\ndegree of their affinity, a relation which is quite inexplicable on the\r\ntheory of independent acts of creation.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing statements in regard to the inhabitants of oceanic\r\nislands, namely, the fewness of the species, with a large proportion\r\nconsisting of endemic forms—the members of certain groups, but not\r\nthose of other groups in the same class, having been modified—the\r\nabsence of certain whole orders, as of batrachians and of terrestrial\r\nmammals, notwithstanding the presence of aërial bats, the singular\r\nproportions of certain orders of plants, herbaceous forms having been\r\ndeveloped into trees, &c., seem to me to accord better with the belief\r\nin the efficiency of occasional means of transport, carried on during a\r\nlong course of time, than with the belief in the former connection of\r\nall oceanic islands with the nearest continent; for on this latter view\r\nit is probable that the various classes would have immigrated more\r\nuniformly, and from the species having entered in a body, their mutual\r\nrelations would not have been much disturbed, and consequently, they\r\nwould either have not been modified, or all the species in a more\r\nequable manner.\r\n\r\nI do not deny that there are many and serious difficulties in\r\nunderstanding how many of the inhabitants of the more remote islands,\r\nwhether still retaining the same specific form or subsequently\r\nmodified, have reached their present homes. But the probability of\r\nother islands having once existed as halting-places, of which not a\r\nwreck now remains, must not be overlooked. I will specify one difficult\r\ncase. Almost all oceanic islands, even the most isolated and smallest,\r\nare inhabited by land-shells, generally by endemic species, but\r\nsometimes by species found elsewhere striking instances of which have\r\nbeen given by Dr. A.A. Gould in relation to the Pacific. Now it is\r\nnotorious that land-shells are easily killed by sea-water; their eggs,\r\nat least such as I have tried, sink in it and are killed. Yet there\r\nmust be some unknown, but occasionally efficient means for their\r\ntransportal. Would the just-hatched young sometimes adhere to the feet\r\nof birds roosting on the ground and thus get transported? It occurred\r\nto me that land-shells, when hybernating and having a membranous\r\ndiaphragm over the mouth of the shell, might be floated in chinks of\r\ndrifted timber across moderately wide arms of the sea. And I find that\r\nseveral species in this state withstand uninjured an immersion in\r\nsea-water during seven days. One shell, the Helix pomatia, after having\r\nbeen thus treated, and again hybernating, was put into sea-water for\r\ntwenty days and perfectly recovered. During this length of time the\r\nshell might have been carried by a marine country of average swiftness\r\nto a distance of 660 geographical miles. As this Helix has a thick\r\ncalcareous operculum I removed it, and when it had formed a new\r\nmembranous one, I again immersed it for fourteen days in sea-water, and\r\nagain it recovered and crawled away. Baron Aucapitaine has since tried\r\nsimilar experiments. He placed 100 land-shells, belonging to ten\r\nspecies, in a box pierced with holes, and immersed it for a fortnight\r\nin the sea. Out of the hundred shells twenty-seven recovered. The\r\npresence of an operculum seems to have been of importance, as out of\r\ntwelve specimens of Cyclostoma elegans, which is thus furnished, eleven\r\nrevived. It is remarkable, seeing how well the Helix pomatia resisted\r\nwith me the salt-water, that not one of fifty-four specimens belonging\r\nto four other species of Helix tried by Aucapitaine recovered. It is,\r\nhowever, not at all probable that land-shells have often been thus\r\ntransported; the feet of birds offer a more probable method.\r\n\r\n_On the Relations of the Inhabitants of Islands to those of the nearest\r\nMainland._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most striking and important fact for us is the affinity of the\r\nspecies which inhabit islands to those of the nearest mainland, without\r\nbeing actually the same. Numerous instances could be given. The\r\nGalapagos Archipelago, situated under the equator, lies at a distance\r\nof between 500 and 600 miles from the shores of South America. Here\r\nalmost every product of the land and of the water bears the\r\nunmistakable stamp of the American continent. There are twenty-six\r\nland-birds. Of these twenty-one, or perhaps twenty-three, are ranked as\r\ndistinct species, and would commonly be assumed to have been here\r\ncreated; yet the close affinity of most of these birds to American\r\nspecies is manifest in every character in their habits, gestures, and\r\ntones of voice. So it is with the other animals, and with a large\r\nproportion of the plants, as shown by Dr. Hooker in his admirable Flora\r\nof this archipelago. The naturalist, looking at the inhabitants of\r\nthese volcanic islands in the Pacific, distant several hundred miles\r\nfrom the continent, feels that he is standing on American land. Why\r\nshould this be so? Why should the species which are supposed to have\r\nbeen created in the Galapagos Archipelago, and nowhere else, bear so\r\nplainly the stamp of affinity to those created in America? There is\r\nnothing in the conditions of life, in the geological nature of the\r\nislands, in their height or climate, or in the proportions in which the\r\nseveral classes are associated together, which closely resembles the\r\nconditions of the South American coast. In fact, there is a\r\nconsiderable dissimilarity in all these respects. On the other hand,\r\nthere is a considerable degree of resemblance in the volcanic nature of\r\nthe soil, in the climate, height, and size of the islands, between the\r\nGalapagos and Cape Verde Archipelagos: but what an entire and absolute\r\ndifference in their inhabitants! The inhabitants of the Cape Verde\r\nIslands are related to those of Africa, like those of the Galapagos to\r\nAmerica. Facts, such as these, admit of no sort of explanation on the\r\nordinary view of independent creation; whereas, on the view here\r\nmaintained, it is obvious that the Galapagos Islands would be likely to\r\nreceive colonists from America, whether by occasional means of\r\ntransport or (though I do not believe in this doctrine) by formerly\r\ncontinuous land, and the Cape Verde Islands from Africa; such colonists\r\nwould be liable to modification—the principle of inheritance still\r\nbetraying their original birthplace.\r\n\r\nMany analogous facts could be given: indeed it is an almost universal\r\nrule that the endemic productions of islands are related to those of\r\nthe nearest continent, or of the nearest large island. The exceptions\r\nare few, and most of them can be explained. Thus, although Kerguelen\r\nLand stands nearer to Africa than to America, the plants are related,\r\nand that very closely, as we know from Dr. Hooker’s account, to those\r\nof America: but on the view that this island has been mainly stocked by\r\nseeds brought with earth and stones on icebergs, drifted by the\r\nprevailing currents, this anomaly disappears. New Zealand in its\r\nendemic plants is much more closely related to Australia, the nearest\r\nmainland, than to any other region: and this is what might have been\r\nexpected; but it is also plainly related to South America, which,\r\nalthough the next nearest continent, is so enormously remote, that the\r\nfact becomes an anomaly. But this difficulty partially disappears on\r\nthe view that New Zealand, South America, and the other southern lands,\r\nhave been stocked in part from a nearly intermediate though distant\r\npoint, namely, from the antarctic islands, when they were clothed with\r\nvegetation, during a warmer tertiary period, before the commencement of\r\nthe last Glacial period. The affinity, which, though feeble, I am\r\nassured by Dr. Hooker is real, between the flora of the south-western\r\ncorner of Australia and of the Cape of Good Hope, is a far more\r\nremarkable case; but this affinity is confined to the plants, and will,\r\nno doubt, some day be explained.\r\n\r\nThe same law which has determined the relationship between the\r\ninhabitants of islands and the nearest mainland, is sometimes displayed\r\non a small scale, but in a most interesting manner, within the limits\r\nof the same archipelago. Thus each separate island of the Galapagos\r\nArchipelago is tenanted, and the fact is a marvellous one, by many\r\ndistinct species; but these species are related to each other in a very\r\nmuch closer manner than to the inhabitants of the American continent,\r\nor of any other quarter of the world. This is what might have been\r\nexpected, for islands situated so near to each other would almost\r\nnecessarily receive immigrants from the same original source, and from\r\neach other. But how is it that many of the immigrants have been\r\ndifferently modified, though only in a small degree, in islands\r\nsituated within sight of each other, having the same geological nature,\r\nthe same height, climate, etc? This long appeared to me a great\r\ndifficulty: but it arises in chief part from the deeply-seated error of\r\nconsidering the physical conditions of a country as the most important;\r\nwhereas it cannot be disputed that the nature of the other species with\r\nwhich each has to compete, is at least as important, and generally a\r\nfar more important element of success. Now if we look to the species\r\nwhich inhabit the Galapagos Archipelago, and are likewise found in\r\nother parts of the world, we find that they differ considerably in the\r\nseveral islands. This difference might indeed have been expected if the\r\nislands have been stocked by occasional means of transport—a seed, for\r\ninstance, of one plant having been brought to one island, and that of\r\nanother plant to another island, though all proceeding from the same\r\ngeneral source. Hence, when in former times an immigrant first settled\r\non one of the islands, or when it subsequently spread from one to\r\nanother, it would undoubtedly be exposed to different conditions in the\r\ndifferent islands, for it would have to compete with a different set of\r\norganisms; a plant, for instance, would find the ground best-fitted for\r\nit occupied by somewhat different species in the different islands, and\r\nwould be exposed to the attacks of somewhat different enemies. If,\r\nthen, it varied, natural selection would probably favour different\r\nvarieties in the different islands. Some species, however, might spread\r\nand yet retain the same character throughout the group, just as we see\r\nsome species spreading widely throughout a continent and remaining the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nThe really surprising fact in this case of the Galapagos Archipelago,\r\nand in a lesser degree in some analogous cases, is that each new\r\nspecies after being formed in any one island, did not spread quickly to\r\nthe other islands. But the islands, though in sight of each other, are\r\nseparated by deep arms of the sea, in most cases wider than the British\r\nChannel, and there is no reason to suppose that they have at any former\r\nperiod been continuously united. The currents of the sea are rapid and\r\ndeep between the islands, and gales of wind are extraordinarily rare;\r\nso that the islands are far more effectually separated from each other\r\nthan they appear on a map. Nevertheless, some of the species, both of\r\nthose found in other parts of the world and of those confined to the\r\narchipelago, are common to the several islands; and we may infer from\r\nthe present manner of distribution that they have spread from one\r\nisland to the others. But we often take, I think, an erroneous view of\r\nthe probability of closely allied species invading each other’s\r\nterritory, when put into free intercommunication. Undoubtedly, if one\r\nspecies has any advantage over another, it will in a very brief time\r\nwholly or in part supplant it; but if both are equally well fitted for\r\ntheir own places, both will probably hold their separate places for\r\nalmost any length of time. Being familiar with the fact that many\r\nspecies, naturalised through man’s agency, have spread with astonishing\r\nrapidity over wide areas, we are apt to infer that most species would\r\nthus spread; but we should remember that the species which become\r\nnaturalised in new countries are not generally closely allied to the\r\naboriginal inhabitants, but are very distinct forms, belonging in a\r\nlarge proportion of cases, as shown by Alph. de Candolle, to distinct\r\ngenera. In the Galapagos Archipelago, many even of the birds, though so\r\nwell adapted for flying from island to island, differ on the different\r\nislands; thus there are three closely allied species of mocking-thrush,\r\neach confined to its own island. Now let us suppose the mocking-thrush\r\nof Chatham Island to be blown to Charles Island, which has its own\r\nmocking-thrush; why should it succeed in establishing itself there? We\r\nmay safely infer that Charles Island is well stocked with its own\r\nspecies, for annually more eggs are laid and young birds hatched than\r\ncan possibly be reared; and we may infer that the mocking-thrush\r\npeculiar to Charles Island is at least as well fitted for its home as\r\nis the species peculiar to Chatham Island. Sir C. Lyell and Mr.\r\nWollaston have communicated to me a remarkable fact bearing on this\r\nsubject; namely, that Madeira and the adjoining islet of Porto Santo\r\npossess many distinct but representative species of land-shells, some\r\nof which live in crevices of stone; and although large quantities of\r\nstone are annually transported from Porto Santo to Madeira, yet this\r\nlatter island has not become colonised by the Porto Santo species:\r\nnevertheless, both islands have been colonised by some European\r\nland-shells, which no doubt had some advantage over the indigenous\r\nspecies. From these considerations I think we need not greatly marvel\r\nat the endemic species which inhabit the several islands of the\r\nGalapagos Archipelago not having all spread from island to island. On\r\nthe same continent, also, pre-occupation has probably played an\r\nimportant part in checking the commingling of the species which inhabit\r\ndifferent districts with nearly the same physical conditions. Thus, the\r\nsouth-east and south-west corners of Australia have nearly the same\r\nphysical conditions, and are united by continuous land, yet they are\r\ninhabited by a vast number of distinct mammals, birds, and plants; so\r\nit is, according to Mr. Bates, with the butterflies and other animals\r\ninhabiting the great, open, and continuous valley of the Amazons.\r\n\r\nThe same principle which governs the general character of the\r\ninhabitants of oceanic islands, namely, the relation to the source\r\nwhence colonists could have been most easily derived, together with\r\ntheir subsequent modification, is of the widest application throughout\r\nnature. We see this on every mountain-summit, in every lake and marsh.\r\nFor Alpine species, excepting in as far as the same species have become\r\nwidely spread during the Glacial epoch, are related to those of the\r\nsurrounding lowlands; thus we have in South America, Alpine\r\nhumming-birds, Alpine rodents, Alpine plants, &c., all strictly\r\nbelonging to American forms; and it is obvious that a mountain, as it\r\nbecame slowly upheaved, would be colonised from the surrounding\r\nlowlands. So it is with the inhabitants of lakes and marshes, excepting\r\nin so far as great facility of transport has allowed the same forms to\r\nprevail throughout large portions of the world. We see the same\r\nprinciple in the character of most of the blind animals inhabiting the\r\ncaves of America and of Europe. Other analogous facts could be given.\r\nIt will, I believe, be found universally true, that wherever in two\r\nregions, let them be ever so distant, many closely allied or\r\nrepresentative species occur, there will likewise be found some\r\nidentical species; and wherever many closely-allied species occur,\r\nthere will be found many forms which some naturalists rank as distinct\r\nspecies, and others as mere varieties; these doubtful forms showing us\r\nthe steps in the process of modification.\r\n\r\nThe relation between the power and extent of migration in certain\r\nspecies, either at the present or at some former period, and the\r\nexistence at remote points of the world of closely allied species, is\r\nshown in another and more general way. Mr. Gould remarked to me long\r\nago, that in those genera of birds which range over the world, many of\r\nthe species have very wide ranges. I can hardly doubt that this rule is\r\ngenerally true, though difficult of proof. Among mammals, we see it\r\nstrikingly displayed in Bats, and in a lesser degree in the Felidæ and\r\nCanidæ. We see the same rule in the distribution of butterflies and\r\nbeetles. So it is with most of the inhabitants of fresh water, for many\r\nof the genera in the most distinct classes range over the world, and\r\nmany of the species have enormous ranges. It is not meant that all, but\r\nthat some of the species have very wide ranges in the genera which\r\nrange very widely. Nor is it meant that the species in such genera\r\nhave, on an average, a very wide range; for this will largely depend on\r\nhow far the process of modification has gone; for instance, two\r\nvarieties of the same species inhabit America and Europe, and thus the\r\nspecies has an immense range; but, if variation were to be carried a\r\nlittle further, the two varieties would be ranked as distinct species,\r\nand their range would be greatly reduced. Still less is it meant, that\r\nspecies which have the capacity of crossing barriers and ranging\r\nwidely, as in the case of certain powerfully-winged birds, will\r\nnecessarily range widely; for we should never forget that to range\r\nwidely implies not only the power of crossing barriers, but the more\r\nimportant power of being victorious in distant lands in the struggle\r\nfor life with foreign associates. But according to the view that all\r\nthe species of a genus, though distributed to the most remote points of\r\nthe world, are descended from a single progenitor, we ought to find,\r\nand I believe as a general rule we do find, that some at least of the\r\nspecies range very widely.\r\n\r\nWe should bear in mind that many genera in all classes are of ancient\r\norigin, and the species in this case will have had ample time for\r\ndispersal and subsequent modification. There is also reason to believe,\r\nfrom geological evidence, that within each great class the lower\r\norganisms change at a slower rate than the higher; consequently they\r\nwill have had a better chance of ranging widely and of still retaining\r\nthe same specific character. This fact, together with that of the seeds\r\nand eggs of most lowly organised forms being very minute and better\r\nfitted for distant transportal, probably accounts for a law which has\r\nlong been observed, and which has lately been discussed by Alph. de\r\nCandolle in regard to plants, namely, that the lower any group of\r\norganisms stands the more widely it ranges.\r\n\r\nThe relations just discussed—namely, lower organisms ranging more\r\nwidely than the higher—some of the species of widely-ranging genera\r\nthemselves ranging widely—such facts, as alpine, lacustrine, and marsh\r\nproductions being generally related to those which live on the\r\nsurrounding low lands and dry lands—the striking relationship between\r\nthe inhabitants of islands and those of the nearest mainland—the still\r\ncloser relationship of the distinct inhabitants of the islands of the\r\nsame archipelago—are inexplicable on the ordinary view of the\r\nindependent creation of each species, but are explicable if we admit\r\ncolonisation from the nearest or readiest source, together with the\r\nsubsequent adaptation of the colonists to their new homes.\r\n\r\n_Summary of the last and present Chapters._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these chapters I have endeavoured to show that if we make due\r\nallowance for our ignorance of the full effects of changes of climate\r\nand of the level of the land, which have certainly occurred within the\r\nrecent period, and of other changes which have probably occurred—if we\r\nremember how ignorant we are with respect to the many curious means of\r\noccasional transport—if we bear in mind, and this is a very important\r\nconsideration, how often a species may have ranged continuously over a\r\nwide area, and then have become extinct in the intermediate tracts—the\r\ndifficulty is not insuperable in believing that all the individuals of\r\nthe same species, wherever found, are descended from common parents.\r\nAnd we are led to this conclusion, which has been arrived at by many\r\nnaturalists under the designation of single centres of creation, by\r\nvarious general considerations, more especially from the importance of\r\nbarriers of all kinds, and from the analogical distribution of\r\nsubgenera, genera, and families.\r\n\r\nWith respect to distinct species belonging to the same genus, which on\r\nour theory have spread from one parent-source; if we make the same\r\nallowances as before for our ignorance, and remember that some forms of\r\nlife have changed very slowly, enormous periods of time having been\r\nthus granted for their migration, the difficulties are far from\r\ninsuperable; though in this case, as in that of the individuals of the\r\nsame species, they are often great.\r\n\r\nAs exemplifying the effects of climatical changes on distribution, I\r\nhave attempted to show how important a part the last Glacial period has\r\nplayed, which affected even the equatorial regions, and which, during\r\nthe alternations of the cold in the north and the south, allowed the\r\nproductions of opposite hemispheres to mingle, and left some of them\r\nstranded on the mountain-summits in all parts of the world. As showing\r\nhow diversified are the means of occasional transport, I have discussed\r\nat some little length the means of dispersal of fresh-water\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\nIf the difficulties be not insuperable in admitting that in the long\r\ncourse of time all the individuals of the same species, and likewise of\r\nthe several species belonging to the same genus, have proceeded from\r\nsome one source; then all the grand leading facts of geographical\r\ndistribution are explicable on the theory of migration, together with\r\nsubsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms. We can\r\nthus understand the high importance of barriers, whether of land or\r\nwater, in not only separating but in apparently forming the several\r\nzoological and botanical provinces. We can thus understand the\r\nconcentration of related species within the same areas; and how it is\r\nthat under different latitudes, for instance, in South America, the\r\ninhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests, marshes, and\r\ndeserts, are linked together in so mysterious a manner, and are\r\nlikewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same\r\ncontinent. Bearing in mind that the mutual relation of organism to\r\norganism is of the highest importance, we can see why two areas, having\r\nnearly the same physical conditions, should often be inhabited by very\r\ndifferent forms of life; for according to the length of time which has\r\nelapsed since the colonists entered one of the regions, or both;\r\naccording to the nature of the communication which allowed certain\r\nforms and not others to enter, either in greater or lesser numbers;\r\naccording or not as those which entered happened to come into more or\r\nless direct competition with each other and with the aborigines; and\r\naccording as the immigrants were capable of varying more or less\r\nrapidly, there would ensue in the to or more regions, independently of\r\ntheir physical conditions, infinitely diversified conditions of life;\r\nthere would be an almost endless amount of organic action and reaction,\r\nand we should find some groups of beings greatly, and some only\r\nslightly modified; some developed in great force, some existing in\r\nscanty numbers—and this we do find in the several great geographical\r\nprovinces of the world.\r\n\r\nOn these same principles we can understand, as I have endeavoured to\r\nshow, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but that of\r\nthese, a large proportion should be endemic or peculiar; and why, in\r\nrelation to the means of migration, one group of beings should have all\r\nits species peculiar, and another group, even within the same class,\r\nshould have all its species the same with those in an adjoining quarter\r\nof the world. We can see why whole groups of organisms, as batrachians\r\nand terrestrial mammals, should be absent from oceanic islands, whilst\r\nthe most isolated islands should possess their own peculiar species of\r\naërial mammals or bats. We can see why, in islands, there should be\r\nsome relation between the presence of mammals, in a more or less\r\nmodified condition, and the depth of the sea between such islands and\r\nthe mainland. We can clearly see why all the inhabitants of an\r\narchipelago, though specifically distinct on the several islets, should\r\nbe closely related to each other, and should likewise be related, but\r\nless closely, to those of the nearest continent, or other source whence\r\nimmigrants might have been derived. We can see why, if there exist very\r\nclosely allied or representative species in two areas, however distant\r\nfrom each other, some identical species will almost always there be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nAs the late Edward Forbes often insisted, there is a striking\r\nparallelism in the laws of life throughout time and space; the laws\r\ngoverning the succession of forms in past times being nearly the same\r\nwith those governing at the present time the differences in different\r\nareas. We see this in many facts. The endurance of each species and\r\ngroup of species is continuous in time; for the apparent exceptions to\r\nthe rule are so few that they may fairly be attributed to our not\r\nhaving as yet discovered in an intermediate deposit certain forms which\r\nare absent in it, but which occur above and below: so in space, it\r\ncertainly is the general rule that the area inhabited by a single\r\nspecies, or by a group of species, is continuous, and the exceptions,\r\nwhich are not rare, may, as I have attempted to show, be accounted for\r\nby former migrations under different circumstances, or through\r\noccasional means of transport, or by the species having become extinct\r\nin the intermediate tracts. Both in time and space species and groups\r\nof species have their points of maximum development. Groups of species,\r\nliving during the same period of time, or living within the same area,\r\nare often characterised by trifling features in common, as of sculpture\r\nor colour. In looking to the long succession of past ages, as in\r\nlooking to distant provinces throughout the world, we find that species\r\nin certain classes differ little from each other, whilst those in\r\nanother class, or only in a different section of the same order, differ\r\ngreatly from each other. In both time and space the lowly organised\r\nmembers of each class generally change less than the highly organised;\r\nbut there are in both cases marked exceptions to the rule. According to\r\nour theory, these several relations throughout time and space are\r\nintelligible; for whether we look to the allied forms of life which\r\nhave changed during successive ages, or to those which have changed\r\nafter having migrated into distant quarters, in both cases they are\r\nconnected by the same bond of ordinary generation; in both cases the\r\nlaws of variation have been the same, and modifications have been\r\naccumulated by the same means of natural selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nMUTUAL AFFINITIES OF ORGANIC BEINGS: MORPHOLOGY: EMBRYOLOGY:\r\nRUDIMENTARY ORGANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nClassification, groups subordinate to groups—Natural system—Rules and\r\ndifficulties in classification, explained on the theory of descent with\r\nmodification—Classification of varieties—Descent always used in\r\nclassification—Analogical or adaptive characters—Affinities, general,\r\ncomplex and radiating—Extinction separates and defines\r\ngroups—Morphology, between members of the same class, between parts of\r\nthe same individual—Embryology, laws of, explained by variations not\r\nsupervening at an early age, and being inherited at a corresponding\r\nage—Rudimentary organs; their origin explained—Summary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classification._\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the most remote period in the history of the world organic beings\r\nhave been found to resemble each other in descending degrees, so that\r\nthey can be classed in groups under groups. This classification is not\r\narbitrary like the grouping of the stars in constellations. The\r\nexistence of groups would have been of simple significance, if one\r\ngroup had been exclusively fitted to inhabit the land, and another the\r\nwater; one to feed on flesh, another on vegetable matter, and so on;\r\nbut the case is widely different, for it is notorious how commonly\r\nmembers of even the same subgroup have different habits. In the second\r\nand fourth chapters, on Variation and on Natural Selection, I have\r\nattempted to show that within each country it is the widely ranging,\r\nthe much diffused and common, that is the dominant species, belonging\r\nto the larger genera in each class, which vary most. The varieties, or\r\nincipient species, thus produced, ultimately become converted into new\r\nand distinct species; and these, on the principle of inheritance, tend\r\nto produce other new and dominant species. Consequently the groups\r\nwhich are now large, and which generally include many dominant species,\r\ntend to go on increasing in size. I further attempted to show that from\r\nthe varying descendants of each species trying to occupy as many and as\r\ndifferent places as possible in the economy of nature, they constantly\r\ntend to diverge in character. This latter conclusion is supported by\r\nobserving the great diversity of forms, which, in any small area, come\r\ninto the closest competition, and by certain facts in naturalisation.\r\n\r\nI attempted also to show that there is a steady tendency in the forms\r\nwhich are increasing in number and diverging in character, to supplant\r\nand exterminate the preceding, less divergent and less improved forms.\r\nI request the reader to turn to the diagram illustrating the action, as\r\nformerly explained, of these several principles; and he will see that\r\nthe inevitable result is, that the modified descendants proceeding from\r\none progenitor become broken up into groups subordinate to groups. In\r\nthe diagram each letter on the uppermost line may represent a genus\r\nincluding several species; and the whole of the genera along this upper\r\nline form together one class, for all are descended from one ancient\r\nparent, and, consequently, have inherited something in common. But the\r\nthree genera on the left hand have, on this same principle, much in\r\ncommon, and form a subfamily, distinct from that containing the next\r\ntwo genera on the right hand, which diverged from a common parent at\r\nthe fifth stage of descent. These five genera have also much in common,\r\nthough less than when grouped in subfamilies; and they form a family\r\ndistinct from that containing the three genera still further to the\r\nright hand, which diverged at an earlier period. And all these genera,\r\ndescended from (A), form an order distinct from the genera descended\r\nfrom (I). So that we here have many species descended from a single\r\nprogenitor grouped into genera; and the genera into subfamilies,\r\nfamilies and orders, all under one great class. The grand fact of the\r\nnatural subordination of organic beings in groups under groups, which,\r\nfrom its familiarity, does not always sufficiently strike us, is in my\r\njudgment thus explained. No doubt organic beings, like all other\r\nobjects, can be classed in many ways, either artificially by single\r\ncharacters, or more naturally by a number of characters. We know, for\r\ninstance, that minerals and the elemental substances can be thus\r\narranged. In this case there is of course no relation to genealogical\r\nsuccession, and no cause can at present be assigned for their falling\r\ninto groups. But with organic beings the case is different, and the\r\nview above given accords with their natural arrangement in group under\r\ngroup; and no other explanation has ever been attempted.\r\n\r\nNaturalists, as we have seen, try to arrange the species, genera and\r\nfamilies in each class, on what is called the Natural System. But what\r\nis meant by this system? Some authors look at it merely as a scheme for\r\narranging together those living objects which are most alike, and for\r\nseparating those which are most unlike; or as an artificial method of\r\nenunciating, as briefly as possible, general propositions—that is, by\r\none sentence to give the characters common, for instance, to all\r\nmammals, by another those common to all carnivora, by another those\r\ncommon to the dog-genus, and then, by adding a single sentence, a full\r\ndescription is given of each kind of dog. The ingenuity and utility of\r\nthis system are indisputable. But many naturalists think that something\r\nmore is meant by the Natural System; they believe that it reveals the\r\nplan of the Creator; but unless it be specified whether order in time\r\nor space, or both, or what else is meant by the plan of the Creator, it\r\nseems to me that nothing is thus added to our knowledge. Expressions\r\nsuch as that famous one by Linnæus, which we often meet with in a more\r\nor less concealed form, namely, that the characters do not make the\r\ngenus, but that the genus gives the characters, seem to imply that some\r\ndeeper bond is included in our classifications than mere resemblance. I\r\nbelieve that this is the case, and that community of descent—the one\r\nknown cause of close similarity in organic beings—is the bond, which,\r\nthough observed by various degrees of modification, is partially\r\nrevealed to us by our classifications.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the rules followed in classification, and the\r\ndifficulties which are encountered on the view that classification\r\neither gives some unknown plan of creation, or is simply a scheme for\r\nenunciating general propositions and of placing together the forms most\r\nlike each other. It might have been thought (and was in ancient times\r\nthought) that those parts of the structure which determined the habits\r\nof life, and the general place of each being in the economy of nature,\r\nwould be of very high importance in classification. Nothing can be more\r\nfalse. No one regards the external similarity of a mouse to a shrew, of\r\na dugong to a whale, of a whale to a fish, as of any importance. These\r\nresemblances, though so intimately connected with the whole life of the\r\nbeing, are ranked as merely “adaptive or analogical characters;” but to\r\nthe consideration of these resemblances we shall recur. It may even be\r\ngiven as a general rule, that the less any part of the organisation is\r\nconcerned with special habits, the more important it becomes for\r\nclassification. As an instance: Owen, in speaking of the dugong, says,\r\n“The generative organs, being those which are most remotely related to\r\nthe habits and food of an animal, I have always regarded as affording\r\nvery clear indications of its true affinities. We are least likely in\r\nthe modifications of these organs to mistake a merely adaptive for an\r\nessential character.” With plants how remarkable it is that the organs\r\nof vegetation, on which their nutrition and life depend, are of little\r\nsignification; whereas the organs of reproduction, with their product\r\nthe seed and embryo, are of paramount importance! So again, in formerly\r\ndiscussing certain morphological characters which are not functionally\r\nimportant, we have seen that they are often of the highest service in\r\nclassification. This depends on their constancy throughout many allied\r\ngroups; and their constancy chiefly depends on any slight deviations\r\nnot having been preserved and accumulated by natural selection, which\r\nacts only on serviceable characters.\r\n\r\nThat the mere physiological importance of an organ does not determine\r\nits classificatory value, is almost proved by the fact, that in allied\r\ngroups, in which the same organ, as we have every reason to suppose,\r\nhas nearly the same physiological value, its classificatory value is\r\nwidely different. No naturalist can have worked at any group without\r\nbeing struck with this fact; and it has been fully acknowledged in the\r\nwritings of almost every author. It will suffice to quote the highest\r\nauthority, Robert Brown, who, in speaking of certain organs in the\r\nProteaceæ, says their generic importance, “like that of all their\r\nparts, not only in this, but, as I apprehend in every natural family,\r\nis very unequal, and in some cases seems to be entirely lost.” Again,\r\nin another work he says, the genera of the Connaraceæ “differ in having\r\none or more ovaria, in the existence or absence of albumen, in the\r\nimbricate or valvular æstivation. Any one of these characters singly\r\nis frequently of more than generic importance, though here even, when\r\nall taken together, they appear insufficient to separate Cnestis from\r\nConnarus.” To give an example among insects: in one great division of\r\nthe Hymenoptera, the antennæ, as Westwood has remarked, are most\r\nconstant in structure; in another division they differ much, and the\r\ndifferences are of quite subordinate value in classification; yet no\r\none will say that the antennæ in these two divisions of the same order\r\nare of unequal physiological importance. Any number of instances could\r\nbe given of the varying importance for classification of the same\r\nimportant organ within the same group of beings.\r\n\r\nAgain, no one will say that rudimentary or atrophied organs are of high\r\nphysiological or vital importance; yet, undoubtedly, organs in this\r\ncondition are often of much value in classification. No one will\r\ndispute that the rudimentary teeth in the upper jaws of young\r\nruminants, and certain rudimentary bones of the leg, are highly\r\nserviceable in exhibiting the close affinity between Ruminants and\r\nPachyderms. Robert Brown has strongly insisted on the fact that the\r\nposition of the rudimentary florets is of the highest importance in the\r\nclassification of the Grasses.\r\n\r\nNumerous instances could be given of characters derived from parts\r\nwhich must be considered of very trifling physiological importance, but\r\nwhich are universally admitted as highly serviceable in the definition\r\nof whole groups. For instance, whether or not there is an open passage\r\nfrom the nostrils to the mouth, the only character, according to Owen,\r\nwhich absolutely distinguishes fishes and reptiles—the inflection of\r\nthe angle of the lower jaw in Marsupials—the manner in which the wings\r\nof insects are folded—mere colour in certain Algæ—mere pubescence on\r\nparts of the flower in grasses—the nature of the dermal covering, as\r\nhair or feathers, in the Vertebrata. If the Ornithorhynchus had been\r\ncovered with feathers instead of hair, this external and trifling\r\ncharacter would have been considered by naturalists as an important aid\r\nin determining the degree of affinity of this strange creature to\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nThe importance, for classification, of trifling characters, mainly\r\ndepends on their being correlated with many other characters of more or\r\nless importance. The value indeed of an aggregate of characters is very\r\nevident in natural history. Hence, as has often been remarked, a\r\nspecies may depart from its allies in several characters, both of high\r\nphysiological importance, and of almost universal prevalence, and yet\r\nleave us in no doubt where it should be ranked. Hence, also, it has\r\nbeen found that a classification founded on any single character,\r\nhowever important that may be, has always failed; for no part of the\r\norganisation is invariably constant. The importance of an aggregate of\r\ncharacters, even when none are important, alone explains the aphorism\r\nenunciated by Linnæus, namely, that the characters do not give the\r\ngenus, but the genus gives the character; for this seems founded on the\r\nappreciation of many trifling points of resemblance, too slight to be\r\ndefined. Certain plants, belonging to the Malpighiaceæ, bear perfect\r\nand degraded flowers; in the latter, as A. de Jussieu has remarked,\r\n“The greater number of the characters proper to the species, to the\r\ngenus, to the family, to the class, disappear, and thus laugh at our\r\nclassification.” When Aspicarpa produced in France, during several\r\nyears, only these degraded flowers, departing so wonderfully in a\r\nnumber of the most important points of structure from the proper type\r\nof the order, yet M. Richard sagaciously saw, as Jussieu observes, that\r\nthis genus should still be retained among the Malpighiaceæ. This case\r\nwell illustrates the spirit of our classifications.\r\n\r\nPractically, when naturalists are at work, they do not trouble\r\nthemselves about the physiological value of the characters which they\r\nuse in defining a group or in allocating any particular species. If\r\nthey find a character nearly uniform, and common to a great number of\r\nforms, and not common to others, they use it as one of high value; if\r\ncommon to some lesser number, they use it as of subordinate value. This\r\nprinciple has been broadly confessed by some naturalists to be the true\r\none; and by none more clearly than by that excellent botanist, Aug. St.\r\nHilaire. If several trifling characters are always found in\r\ncombination, though no apparent bond of connexion can be discovered\r\nbetween them, especial value is set on them. As in most groups of\r\nanimals, important organs, such as those for propelling the blood, or\r\nfor aerating it, or those for propagating the race, are found nearly\r\nuniform, they are considered as highly serviceable in classification;\r\nbut in some groups all these, the most important vital organs, are\r\nfound to offer characters of quite subordinate value. Thus, as Fritz\r\nMüller has lately remarked, in the same group of crustaceans, Cypridina\r\nis furnished with a heart, while in two closely allied genera, namely\r\nCypris and Cytherea, there is no such organ; one species of Cypridina\r\nhas well-developed branchiæ, while another species is destitute of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWe can see why characters derived from the embryo should be of equal\r\nimportance with those derived from the adult, for a natural\r\nclassification of course includes all ages. But it is by no means\r\nobvious, on the ordinary view, why the structure of the embryo should\r\nbe more important for this purpose than that of the adult, which alone\r\nplays its full part in the economy of nature. Yet it has been strongly\r\nurged by those great naturalists, Milne Edwards and Agassiz, that\r\nembryological characters are the most important of all; and this\r\ndoctrine has very generally been admitted as true. Nevertheless, their\r\nimportance has sometimes been exaggerated, owing to the adaptive\r\ncharacters of larvæ not having been excluded; in order to show this,\r\nFritz Müller arranged, by the aid of such characters alone, the great\r\nclass of crustaceans, and the arrangement did not prove a natural one.\r\nBut there can be no doubt that embryonic, excluding larval characters,\r\nare of the highest value for classification, not only with animals but\r\nwith plants. Thus the main divisions of flowering plants are founded on\r\ndifferences in the embryo—on the number and position of the cotyledons,\r\nand on the mode of development of the plumule and radicle. We shall\r\nimmediately see why these characters possess so high a value in\r\nclassification, namely, from the natural system being genealogical in\r\nits arrangement.\r\n\r\nOur classifications are often plainly influenced by chains of\r\naffinities. Nothing can be easier than to define a number of characters\r\ncommon to all birds; but with crustaceans, any such definition has\r\nhitherto been found impossible. There are crustaceans at the opposite\r\nends of the series, which have hardly a character in common; yet the\r\nspecies at both ends, from being plainly allied to others, and these to\r\nothers, and so onwards, can be recognised as unequivocally belonging to\r\nthis, and to no other class of the Articulata.\r\n\r\nGeographical distribution has often been used, though perhaps not quite\r\nlogically, in classification, more especially in very large groups of\r\nclosely allied forms. Temminck insists on the utility or even necessity\r\nof this practice in certain groups of birds; and it has been followed\r\nby several entomologists and botanists.\r\n\r\nFinally, with respect to the comparative value of the various groups of\r\nspecies, such as orders, suborders, families, subfamilies, and genera,\r\nthey seem to be, at least at present, almost arbitrary. Several of the\r\nbest botanists, such as Mr. Bentham and others, have strongly insisted\r\non their arbitrary value. Instances could be given among plants and\r\ninsects, of a group first ranked by practised naturalists as only a\r\ngenus, and then raised to the rank of a subfamily or family; and this\r\nhas been done, not because further research has detected important\r\nstructural differences, at first overlooked, but because numerous\r\nallied species, with slightly different grades of difference, have been\r\nsubsequently discovered.\r\n\r\nAll the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification may\r\nbe explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the\r\nnatural system is founded on descent with modification—that the\r\ncharacters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between\r\nany two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a\r\ncommon parent, all true classification being genealogical—that\r\ncommunity of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been\r\nunconsciously seeking, and not some unknown plan of creation, or the\r\nenunciation of general propositions, and the mere putting together and\r\nseparating objects more or less alike.\r\n\r\nBut I must explain my meaning more fully. I believe that the\r\n_arrangement_ of the groups within each class, in due subordination and\r\nrelation to each other, must be strictly genealogical in order to be\r\nnatural; but that the _amount_ of difference in the several branches or\r\ngroups, though allied in the same degree in blood to their common\r\nprogenitor, may differ greatly, being due to the different degrees of\r\nmodification which they have undergone; and this is expressed by the\r\nforms being ranked under different genera, families, sections or\r\norders. The reader will best understand what is meant, if he will take\r\nthe trouble to refer to the diagram in the fourth chapter. We will\r\nsuppose the letters A to L to represent allied genera existing during\r\nthe Silurian epoch, and descended from some still earlier form. In\r\nthree of these genera (A, F, and I) a species has transmitted modified\r\ndescendants to the present day, represented by the fifteen genera\r\n(_a_14 to _z_14) on the uppermost horizontal line. Now, all these\r\nmodified descendants from a single species are related in blood or\r\ndescent in the same degree. They may metaphorically be called cousins\r\nto the same millionth degree, yet they differ widely and in different\r\ndegrees from each other. The forms descended from A, now broken up into\r\ntwo or three families, constitute a distinct order from those descended\r\nfrom I, also broken up into two families. Nor can the existing species\r\ndescended from A be ranked in the same genus with the parent A, or\r\nthose from I with parent I. But the existing genus F14 may be supposed\r\nto have been but slightly modified, and it will then rank with the\r\nparent genus F; just as some few still living organisms belong to\r\nSilurian genera. So that the comparative value of the differences\r\nbetween these organic beings, which are all related to each other in\r\nthe same degree in blood, has come to be widely different.\r\nNevertheless, their genealogical _arrangement_ remains strictly true,\r\nnot only at the present time, but at each successive period of descent.\r\nAll the modified descendants from A will have inherited something in\r\ncommon from their common parent, as will all the descendants from I; so\r\nwill it be with each subordinate branch of descendants at each\r\nsuccessive stage. If, however, we suppose any descendant of A or of I\r\nto have become so much modified as to have lost all traces of its\r\nparentage in this case, its place in the natural system will be lost,\r\nas seems to have occurred with some few existing organisms. All the\r\ndescendants of the genus F, along its whole line of descent, are\r\nsupposed to have been but little modified, and they form a single\r\ngenus. But this genus, though much isolated, will still occupy its\r\nproper intermediate position. The representation of the groups as here\r\ngiven in the diagram on a flat surface, is much too simple. The\r\nbranches ought to have diverged in all directions. If the names of the\r\ngroups had been simply written down in a linear series the\r\nrepresentation would have been still less natural; and it is\r\nnotoriously not possible to represent in a series, on a flat surface,\r\nthe affinities which we discover in nature among the beings of the same\r\ngroup. Thus, the natural system is genealogical in its arrangement,\r\nlike a pedigree. But the amount of modification which the different\r\ngroups have undergone has to be expressed by ranking them under\r\ndifferent so-called genera, subfamilies, families, sections, orders,\r\nand classes.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification, by\r\ntaking the case of languages. If we possessed a perfect pedigree of\r\nmankind, a genealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford\r\nthe best classification of the various languages now spoken throughout\r\nthe world; and if all extinct languages, and all intermediate and\r\nslowly changing dialects, were to be included, such an arrangement\r\nwould be the only possible one. Yet it might be that some ancient\r\nlanguages had altered very little and had given rise to few new\r\nlanguages, whilst others had altered much owing to the spreading,\r\nisolation and state of civilisation of the several co-descended races,\r\nand had thus given rise to many new dialects and languages. The various\r\ndegrees of difference between the languages of the same stock would\r\nhave to be expressed by groups subordinate to groups; but the proper or\r\neven the only possible arrangement would still be genealogical; and\r\nthis would be strictly natural, as it would connect together all\r\nlanguages, extinct and recent, by the closest affinities, and would\r\ngive the filiation and origin of each tongue.\r\n\r\nIn confirmation of this view, let us glance at the classification of\r\nvarieties, which are known or believed to be descended from a single\r\nspecies. These are grouped under the species, with the subvarieties\r\nunder the varieties; and in some cases, as with the domestic pigeon,\r\nwith several other grades of difference. Nearly the same rules are\r\nfollowed as in classifying species. Authors have insisted on the\r\nnecessity of arranging varieties on a natural instead of an artificial\r\nsystem; we are cautioned, for instance, not to class two varieties of\r\nthe pine-apple together, merely because their fruit, though the most\r\nimportant part, happens to be nearly identical; no one puts the Swedish\r\nand common turnip together, though the esculent and thickened stems are\r\nso similar. Whatever part is found to be most constant, is used in\r\nclassing varieties: thus the great agriculturist Marshall says the\r\nhorns are very useful for this purpose with cattle, because they are\r\nless variable than the shape or colour of the body, &c.; whereas with\r\nsheep the horns are much less serviceable, because less constant. In\r\nclassing varieties, I apprehend that if we had a real pedigree, a\r\ngenealogical classification would be universally preferred; and it has\r\nbeen attempted in some cases. For we might feel sure, whether there had\r\nbeen more or less modification, that the principle of inheritance would\r\nkeep the forms together which were allied in the greatest number of\r\npoints. In tumbler pigeons, though some of the subvarieties differ in\r\nthe important character of the length of the beak, yet all are kept\r\ntogether from having the common habit of tumbling; but the short-faced\r\nbreed has nearly or quite lost this habit; nevertheless, without any\r\nthought on the subject, these tumblers are kept in the same group,\r\nbecause allied in blood and alike in some other respects.\r\n\r\nWith species in a state of nature, every naturalist has in fact brought\r\ndescent into his classification; for he includes in his lowest grade,\r\nthat of species, the two sexes; and how enormously these sometimes\r\ndiffer in the most important characters is known to every naturalist:\r\nscarcely a single fact can be predicated in common of the adult males\r\nand hermaphrodites of certain cirripedes, and yet no one dreams of\r\nseparating them. As soon as the three Orchidean forms, Monachanthus,\r\nMyanthus, and Catasetum, which had previously been ranked as three\r\ndistinct genera, were known to be sometimes produced on the same plant,\r\nthey were immediately considered as varieties; and now I have been able\r\nto show that they are the male, female, and hermaphrodite forms of the\r\nsame species. The naturalist includes as one species the various larval\r\nstages of the same individual, however much they may differ from each\r\nother and from the adult; as well as the so-called alternate\r\ngenerations of Steenstrup, which can only in a technical sense be\r\nconsidered as the same individual. He includes monsters and varieties,\r\nnot from their partial resemblance to the parent-form, but because they\r\nare descended from it.\r\n\r\nAs descent has universally been used in classing together the\r\nindividuals of the same species, though the males and females and larvæ\r\nare sometimes extremely different; and as it has been used in classing\r\nvarieties which have undergone a certain, and sometimes a considerable\r\namount of modification, may not this same element of descent have been\r\nunconsciously used in grouping species under genera, and genera under\r\nhigher groups, all under the so-called natural system? I believe it has\r\nbeen unconsciously used; and thus only can I understand the several\r\nrules and guides which have been followed by our best systematists. As\r\nwe have no written pedigrees, we are forced to trace community of\r\ndescent by resemblances of any kind. Therefore, we choose those\r\ncharacters which are the least likely to have been modified, in\r\nrelation to the conditions of life to which each species has been\r\nrecently exposed. Rudimentary structures on this view are as good as,\r\nor even sometimes better than other parts of the organisation. We care\r\nnot how trifling a character may be—let it be the mere inflection of\r\nthe angle of the jaw, the manner in which an insect’s wing is folded,\r\nwhether the skin be covered by hair or feathers—if it prevail\r\nthroughout many and different species, especially those having very\r\ndifferent habits of life, it assumes high value; for we can account for\r\nits presence in so many forms with such different habits, only by\r\ninheritance from a common parent. We may err in this respect in regard\r\nto single points of structure, but when several characters, let them be\r\never so trifling, concur throughout a large group of beings having\r\ndifferent habits, we may feel almost sure, on the theory of descent,\r\nthat these characters have been inherited from a common ancestor; and\r\nwe know that such aggregated characters have especial value in\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nWe can understand why a species or a group of species may depart from\r\nits allies, in several of its most important characteristics, and yet\r\nbe safely classed with them. This may be safely done, and is often\r\ndone, as long as a sufficient number of characters, let them be ever so\r\nunimportant, betrays the hidden bond of community of descent. Let two\r\nforms have not a single character in common, yet, if these extreme\r\nforms are connected together by a chain of intermediate groups, we may\r\nat once infer their community of descent, and we put them all into the\r\nsame class. As we find organs of high physiological importance—those\r\nwhich serve to preserve life under the most diverse conditions of\r\nexistence—are generally the most constant, we attach especial value to\r\nthem; but if these same organs, in another group or section of a group,\r\nare found to differ much, we at once value them less in our\r\nclassification. We shall presently see why embryological characters are\r\nof such high classificatory importance. Geographical distribution may\r\nsometimes be brought usefully into play in classing large genera,\r\nbecause all the species of the same genus, inhabiting any distinct and\r\nisolated region, are in all probability descended from the same\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n_Analogical Resemblances._—We can understand, on the above views, the\r\nvery important distinction between real affinities and analogical or\r\nadaptive resemblances. Lamarck first called attention to this subject,\r\nand he has been ably followed by Macleay and others. The resemblance in\r\nthe shape of the body and in the fin-like anterior limbs between\r\ndugongs and whales, and between these two orders of mammals and fishes,\r\nare analogical. So is the resemblance between a mouse and a shrew-mouse\r\n(Sorex), which belong to different orders; and the still closer\r\nresemblance, insisted on by Mr. Mivart, between the mouse and a small\r\nmarsupial animal (Antechinus) of Australia. These latter resemblances\r\nmay be accounted for, as it seems to me, by adaptation for similarly\r\nactive movements through thickets and herbage, together with\r\nconcealment from enemies.\r\n\r\nAmong insects there are innumerable instances; thus Linnæus, misled by\r\nexternal appearances, actually classed an homopterous insect as a moth.\r\nWe see something of the same kind even with our domestic varieties, as\r\nin the strikingly similar shape of the body in the improved breeds of\r\nthe Chinese and common pig, which are descended from distinct species;\r\nand in the similarly thickened stems of the common and specifically\r\ndistinct Swedish turnip. The resemblance between the greyhound and\r\nrace-horse is hardly more fanciful than the analogies which have been\r\ndrawn by some authors between widely different animals.\r\n\r\nOn the view of characters being of real importance for classification,\r\nonly in so far as they reveal descent, we can clearly understand why\r\nanalogical or adaptive characters, although of the utmost importance to\r\nthe welfare of the being, are almost valueless to the systematist. For\r\nanimals, belonging to two most distinct lines of descent, may have\r\nbecome adapted to similar conditions, and thus have assumed a close\r\nexternal resemblance; but such resemblances will not reveal—will rather\r\ntend to conceal their blood-relationship. We can thus also understand\r\nthe apparent paradox, that the very same characters are analogical when\r\none group is compared with another, but give true affinities when the\r\nmembers of the same group are compared together: thus the shape of the\r\nbody and fin-like limbs are only analogical when whales are compared\r\nwith fishes, being adaptations in both classes for swimming through the\r\nwater; but between the the several members of the whale family, the\r\nshape of the body and the fin-like limbs offer characters exhibiting\r\ntrue affinity; for as these parts are so nearly similar throughout the\r\nwhole family, we cannot doubt that they have been inherited from a\r\ncommon ancestor. So it is with fishes.\r\n\r\nNumerous cases could be given of striking resemblances in quite\r\ndistinct beings between single parts or organs, which have been adapted\r\nfor the same functions. A good instance is afforded by the close\r\nresemblance of the jaws of the dog and Tasmanian wolf or\r\nThylacinus—animals which are widely sundered in the natural system. But\r\nthis resemblance is confined to general appearance, as in the\r\nprominence of the canines, and in the cutting shape of the molar teeth.\r\nFor the teeth really differ much: thus the dog has on each side of the\r\nupper jaw four pre-molars and only two molars; while the Thylacinus has\r\nthree pre-molars and four molars. The molars also differ much in the\r\ntwo animals in relative size and structure. The adult dentition is\r\npreceded by a widely different milk dentition. Any one may, of course,\r\ndeny that the teeth in either case have been adapted for tearing flesh,\r\nthrough the natural selection of successive variations; but if this be\r\nadmitted in the one case, it is unintelligible to me that it should be\r\ndenied in the other. I am glad to find that so high an authority as\r\nProfessor Flower has come to this same conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary cases given in a former chapter, of widely different\r\nfishes possessing electric organs—of widely different insects\r\npossessing luminous organs—and of orchids and asclepiads having\r\npollen-masses with viscid discs, come under this same head of\r\nanalogical resemblances. But these cases are so wonderful that they\r\nwere introduced as difficulties or objections to our theory. In all\r\nsuch cases some fundamental difference in the growth or development of\r\nthe parts, and generally in their matured structure, can be detected.\r\nThe end gained is the same, but the means, though appearing\r\nsuperficially to be the same, are essentially different. The principle\r\nformerly alluded to under the term of _analogical variation_ has\r\nprobably in these cases often come into play; that is, the members of\r\nthe same class, although only distantly allied, have inherited so much\r\nin common in their constitution, that they are apt to vary under\r\nsimilar exciting causes in a similar manner; and this would obviously\r\naid in the acquirement through natural selection of parts or organs,\r\nstrikingly like each other, independently of their direct inheritance\r\nfrom a common progenitor.\r\n\r\nAs species belonging to distinct classes have often been adapted by\r\nsuccessive slight modifications to live under nearly similar\r\ncircumstances—to inhabit, for instance, the three elements of land, air\r\nand water—we can perhaps understand how it is that a numerical\r\nparallelism has sometimes been observed between the subgroups of\r\ndistinct classes. A naturalist, struck with a parallelism of this\r\nnature, by arbitrarily raising or sinking the value of the groups in\r\nseveral classes (and all our experience shows that their valuation is\r\nas yet arbitrary), could easily extend the parallelism over a wide\r\nrange; and thus the septenary, quinary, quaternary and ternary\r\nclassifications have probably arisen.\r\n\r\nThere is another and curious class of cases in which close external\r\nresemblance does not depend on adaptation to similar habits of life,\r\nbut has been gained for the sake of protection. I allude to the\r\nwonderful manner in which certain butterflies imitate, as first\r\ndescribed by Mr. Bates, other and quite distinct species. This\r\nexcellent observer has shown that in some districts of South America,\r\nwhere, for instance, an Ithomia abounds in gaudy swarms, another\r\nbutterfly, namely, a Leptalis, is often found mingled in the same\r\nflock; and the latter so closely resembles the Ithomia in every shade\r\nand stripe of colour, and even in the shape of its wings, that Mr.\r\nBates, with his eyes sharpened by collecting during eleven years, was,\r\nthough always on his guard, continually deceived. When the mockers and\r\nthe mocked are caught and compared, they are found to be very different\r\nin essential structure, and to belong not only to distinct genera, but\r\noften to distinct families. Had this mimicry occurred in only one or\r\ntwo instances, it might have been passed over as a strange coincidence.\r\nBut, if we proceed from a district where one Leptalis imitates an\r\nIthomia, another mocking and mocked species, belonging to the same two\r\ngenera, equally close in their resemblance, may be found. Altogether no\r\nless than ten genera are enumerated, which include species that imitate\r\nother butterflies. The mockers and mocked always inhabit the same\r\nregion; we never find an imitator living remote from the form which it\r\nimitates. The mockers are almost invariably rare insects; the mocked in\r\nalmost every case abounds in swarms. In the same district in which a\r\nspecies of Leptalis closely imitates an Ithomia, there are sometimes\r\nother Lepidoptera mimicking the same Ithomia: so that in the same\r\nplace, species of three genera of butterflies and even a moth are found\r\nall closely resembling a butterfly belonging to a fourth genus. It\r\ndeserves especial notice that many of the mimicking forms of the\r\nLeptalis, as well as of the mimicked forms, can be shown by a graduated\r\nseries to be merely varieties of the same species; while others are\r\nundoubtedly distinct species. But why, it may be asked, are certain\r\nforms treated as the mimicked and others as the mimickers? Mr. Bates\r\nsatisfactorily answers this question by showing that the form which is\r\nimitated keeps the usual dress of the group to which it belongs, while\r\nthe counterfeiters have changed their dress and do not resemble their\r\nnearest allies.\r\n\r\nWe are next led to enquire what reason can be assigned for certain\r\nbutterflies and moths so often assuming the dress of another and quite\r\ndistinct form; why, to the perplexity of naturalists, has nature\r\ncondescended to the tricks of the stage? Mr. Bates has, no doubt, hit\r\non the true explanation. The mocked forms, which always abound in\r\nnumbers, must habitually escape destruction to a large extent,\r\notherwise they could not exist in such swarms; and a large amount of\r\nevidence has now been collected, showing that they are distasteful to\r\nbirds and other insect-devouring animals. The mocking forms, on the\r\nother hand, that inhabit the same district, are comparatively rare, and\r\nbelong to rare groups; hence, they must suffer habitually from some\r\ndanger, for otherwise, from the number of eggs laid by all butterflies,\r\nthey would in three or four generations swarm over the whole country.\r\nNow if a member of one of these persecuted and rare groups were to\r\nassume a dress so like that of a well-protected species that it\r\ncontinually deceived the practised eyes of an entomologist, it would\r\noften deceive predaceous birds and insects, and thus often escape\r\ndestruction. Mr. Bates may almost be said to have actually witnessed\r\nthe process by which the mimickers have come so closely to resemble the\r\nmimicked; for he found that some of the forms of Leptalis which mimic\r\nso many other butterflies, varied in an extreme degree. In one district\r\nseveral varieties occurred, and of these one alone resembled, to a\r\ncertain extent, the common Ithomia of the same district. In another\r\ndistrict there were two or three varieties, one of which was much\r\ncommoner than the others, and this closely mocked another form of\r\nIthomia. From facts of this nature, Mr. Bates concludes that the\r\nLeptalis first varies; and when a variety happens to resemble in some\r\ndegree any common butterfly inhabiting the same district, this variety,\r\nfrom its resemblance to a flourishing and little persecuted kind, has a\r\nbetter chance of escaping destruction from predaceous birds and\r\ninsects, and is consequently oftener preserved; “the less perfect\r\ndegrees of resemblance being generation after generation eliminated,\r\nand only the others left to propagate their kind.” So that here we have\r\nan excellent illustration of natural selection.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Wallace and Trimen have likewise described several equally\r\nstriking cases of imitation in the Lepidoptera of the Malay Archipelago\r\nand Africa, and with some other insects. Mr. Wallace has also detected\r\none such case with birds, but we have none with the larger quadrupeds.\r\nThe much greater frequency of imitation with insects than with other\r\nanimals, is probably the consequence of their small size; insects\r\ncannot defend themselves, excepting indeed the kinds furnished with a\r\nsting, and I have never heard of an instance of such kinds mocking\r\nother insects, though they are mocked; insects cannot easily escape by\r\nflight from the larger animals which prey on them; therefore, speaking\r\nmetaphorically, they are reduced, like most weak creatures, to trickery\r\nand dissimulation.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that the process of imitation probably never\r\ncommenced between forms widely dissimilar in colour. But, starting with\r\nspecies already somewhat like each other, the closest resemblance, if\r\nbeneficial, could readily be gained by the above means, and if the\r\nimitated form was subsequently and gradually modified through any\r\nagency, the imitating form would be led along the same track, and thus\r\nbe altered to almost any extent, so that it might ultimately assume an\r\nappearance or colouring wholly unlike that of the other members of the\r\nfamily to which it belonged. There is, however, some difficulty on this\r\nhead, for it is necessary to suppose in some cases that ancient members\r\nbelonging to several distinct groups, before they had diverged to their\r\npresent extent, accidentally resembled a member of another and\r\nprotected group in a sufficient degree to afford some slight\r\nprotection, this having given the basis for the subsequent acquisition\r\nof the most perfect resemblance.\r\n\r\n_On the Nature of the Affinities connecting Organic Beings._—As the\r\nmodified descendants of dominant species, belonging to the larger\r\ngenera, tend to inherit the advantages which made the groups to which\r\nthey belong large and their parents dominant, they are almost sure to\r\nspread widely, and to seize on more and more places in the economy of\r\nnature. The larger and more dominant groups within each class thus tend\r\nto go on increasing in size, and they consequently supplant many\r\nsmaller and feebler groups. Thus, we can account for the fact that all\r\norganisms, recent and extinct, are included under a few great orders\r\nand under still fewer classes. As showing how few the higher groups are\r\nin number, and how widely they are spread throughout the world, the\r\nfact is striking that the discovery of Australia has not added an\r\ninsect belonging to a new class, and that in the vegetable kingdom, as\r\nI learn from Dr. Hooker, it has added only two or three families of\r\nsmall size.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on geological succession I attempted to show, on the\r\nprinciple of each group having generally diverged much in character\r\nduring the long-continued process of modification, how it is that the\r\nmore ancient forms of life often present characters in some degree\r\nintermediate between existing groups. As some few of the old and\r\nintermediate forms having transmitted to the present day descendants\r\nbut little modified, these constitute our so-called osculant or\r\naberrant groups. The more aberrant any form is, the greater must be the\r\nnumber of connecting forms which have been exterminated and utterly\r\nlost. And we have evidence of aberrant groups having suffered severely\r\nfrom extinction, for they are almost always represented by extremely\r\nfew species; and such species as do occur are generally very distinct\r\nfrom each other, which again implies extinction. The genera\r\nOrnithorhynchus and Lepidosiren, for example, would not have been less\r\naberrant had each been represented by a dozen species, instead of as at\r\npresent by a single one, or by two or three. We can, I think, account\r\nfor this fact only by looking at aberrant groups as forms which have\r\nbeen conquered by more successful competitors, with a few members still\r\npreserved under unusually favourable conditions.\r\n\r\nMr. Waterhouse has remarked that when a member belonging to one group\r\nof animals exhibits an affinity to a quite distinct group, this\r\naffinity in most cases is general and not special: thus, according to\r\nMr. Waterhouse, of all Rodents, the bizcacha is most nearly related to\r\nMarsupials; but in the points in which it approaches this order, its\r\nrelations are general, that is, not to any one Marsupial species more\r\nthan to another. As these points of affinity are believed to be real\r\nand not merely adaptive, they must be due in accordance with our view\r\nto inheritance from a common progenitor. Therefore, we must suppose\r\neither that all Rodents, including the bizcacha, branched off from some\r\nancient Marsupial, which will naturally have been more or less\r\nintermediate in character with respect to all existing Marsupials; or\r\nthat both Rodents and Marsupials branched off from a common progenitor,\r\nand that both groups have since undergone much modification in\r\ndivergent directions. On either view we must suppose that the bizcacha\r\nhas retained, by inheritance, more of the character of its ancient\r\nprogenitor than have other Rodents; and therefore it will not be\r\nspecially related to any one existing Marsupial, but indirectly to all\r\nor nearly all Marsupials, from having partially retained the character\r\nof their common progenitor, or of some early member of the group. On\r\nthe other hand, of all Marsupials, as Mr. Waterhouse has remarked, the\r\nPhascolomys resembles most nearly, not any one species, but the general\r\norder of Rodents. In this case, however, it may be strongly suspected\r\nthat the resemblance is only analogical, owing to the Phascolomys\r\nhaving become adapted to habits like those of a Rodent. The elder De\r\nCandolle has made nearly similar observations on the general nature of\r\nthe affinities of distinct families of plants.\r\n\r\nOn the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence in\r\ncharacter of the species descended from a common progenitor, together\r\nwith their retention by inheritance of some characters in common, we\r\ncan understand the excessively complex and radiating affinities by\r\nwhich all the members of the same family or higher group are connected\r\ntogether. For the common progenitor of a whole family, now broken up by\r\nextinction into distinct groups and subgroups, will have transmitted\r\nsome of its characters, modified in various ways and degrees, to all\r\nthe species; and they will consequently be related to each other by\r\ncircuitous lines of affinity of various lengths (as may be seen in the\r\ndiagram so often referred to), mounting up through many predecessors.\r\nAs it is difficult to show the blood-relationship between the numerous\r\nkindred of any ancient and noble family, even by the aid of a\r\ngenealogical tree, and almost impossible to do so without this aid, we\r\ncan understand the extraordinary difficulty which naturalists have\r\nexperienced in describing, without the aid of a diagram, the various\r\naffinities which they perceive between the many living and extinct\r\nmembers of the same great natural class.\r\n\r\nExtinction, as we have seen in the fourth chapter, has played an\r\nimportant part in defining and widening the intervals between the\r\nseveral groups in each class. We may thus account for the distinctness\r\nof whole classes from each other—for instance, of birds from all other\r\nvertebrate animals—by the belief that many ancient forms of life have\r\nbeen utterly lost, through which the early progenitors of birds were\r\nformerly connected with the early progenitors of the other and at that\r\ntime less differentiated vertebrate classes. There has been much less\r\nextinction of the forms of life which once connected fishes with\r\nBatrachians. There has been still less within some whole classes, for\r\ninstance the Crustacea, for here the most wonderfully diverse forms are\r\nstill linked together by a long and only partially broken chain of\r\naffinities. Extinction has only defined the groups: it has by no means\r\nmade them; for if every form which has ever lived on this earth were\r\nsuddenly to reappear, though it would be quite impossible to give\r\ndefinitions by which each group could be distinguished, still a natural\r\nclassification, or at least a natural arrangement, would be possible.\r\nWe shall see this by turning to the diagram: the letters, A to L, may\r\nrepresent eleven Silurian genera, some of which have produced large\r\ngroups of modified descendants, with every link in each branch and\r\nsub-branch still alive; and the links not greater than those between\r\nexisting varieties. In this case it would be quite impossible to give\r\ndefinitions by which the several members of the several groups could be\r\ndistinguished from their more immediate parents and descendants. Yet\r\nthe arrangement in the diagram would still hold good and would be\r\nnatural; for, on the principle of inheritance, all the forms descended,\r\nfor instance from A, would have something in common. In a tree we can\r\ndistinguish this or that branch, though at the actual fork the two\r\nunite and blend together. We could not, as I have said, define the\r\nseveral groups; but we could pick out types, or forms, representing\r\nmost of the characters of each group, whether large or small, and thus\r\ngive a general idea of the value of the differences between them. This\r\nis what we should be driven to, if we were ever to succeed in\r\ncollecting all the forms in any one class which have lived throughout\r\nall time and space. Assuredly we shall never succeed in making so\r\nperfect a collection: nevertheless, in certain classes, we are tending\r\ntoward this end; and Milne Edwards has lately insisted, in an able\r\npaper, on the high importance of looking to types, whether or not we\r\ncan separate and define the groups to which such types belong.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have seen that natural selection, which follows from the\r\nstruggle for existence, and which almost inevitably leads to extinction\r\nand divergence of character in the descendants from any one\r\nparent-species, explains that great and universal feature in the\r\naffinities of all organic beings, namely, their subordination in group\r\nunder group. We use the element of descent in classing the individuals\r\nof both sexes and of all ages under one species, although they may have\r\nbut few characters in common; we use descent in classing acknowledged\r\nvarieties, however different they may be from their parents; and I\r\nbelieve that this element of descent is the hidden bond of connexion\r\nwhich naturalists have sought under the term of the Natural System. On\r\nthis idea of the natural system being, in so far as it has been\r\nperfected, genealogical in its arrangement, with the grades of\r\ndifference expressed by the terms genera, families, orders, &c., we can\r\nunderstand the rules which we are compelled to follow in our\r\nclassification. We can understand why we value certain resemblances far\r\nmore than others; why we use rudimentary and useless organs, or others\r\nof trifling physiological importance; why, in finding the relations\r\nbetween one group and another, we summarily reject analogical or\r\nadaptive characters, and yet use these same characters within the\r\nlimits of the same group. We can clearly see how it is that all living\r\nand extinct forms can be grouped together within a few great classes;\r\nand how the several members of each class are connected together by the\r\nmost complex and radiating lines of affinities. We shall never,\r\nprobably, disentangle the inextricable web of the affinities between\r\nthe members of any one class; but when we have a distinct object in\r\nview, and do not look to some unknown plan of creation, we may hope to\r\nmake sure but slow progress.\r\n\r\nProfessor Haeckel in his “Generelle Morphologie” and in another works,\r\nhas recently brought his great knowledge and abilities to bear on what\r\nhe calls phylogeny, or the lines of descent of all organic beings. In\r\ndrawing up the several series he trusts chiefly to embryological\r\ncharacters, but receives aid from homologous and rudimentary organs, as\r\nwell as from the successive periods at which the various forms of life\r\nare believed to have first appeared in our geological formations. He\r\nhas thus boldly made a great beginning, and shows us how classification\r\nwill in the future be treated.\r\n\r\n_Morphology._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the members of the same class, independently of their\r\nhabits of life, resemble each other in the general plan of their\r\norganisation. This resemblance is often expressed by the term “unity of\r\ntype;” or by saying that the several parts and organs in the different\r\nspecies of the class are homologous. The whole subject is included\r\nunder the general term of Morphology. This is one of the most\r\ninteresting departments of natural history, and may almost be said to\r\nbe its very soul. What can be more curious than that the hand of a man,\r\nformed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse,\r\nthe paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be\r\nconstructed on the same pattern, and should include similar bones, in\r\nthe same relative positions? How curious it is, to give a subordinate\r\nthough striking instance, that the hind feet of the kangaroo, which are\r\nso well fitted for bounding over the open plains—those of the climbing,\r\nleaf-eating koala, equally well fitted for grasping the branches of\r\ntrees—those of the ground-dwelling, insect or root-eating,\r\nbandicoots—and those of some other Australian marsupials—should all be\r\nconstructed on the same extraordinary type, namely with the bones of\r\nthe second and third digits extremely slender and enveloped within the\r\nsame skin, so that they appear like a single toe furnished with two\r\nclaws. Notwithstanding this similarity of pattern, it is obvious that\r\nthe hind feet of these several animals are used for as widely different\r\npurposes as it is possible to conceive. The case is rendered all the\r\nmore striking by the American opossums, which follow nearly the same\r\nhabits of life as some of their Australian relatives, having feet\r\nconstructed on the ordinary plan. Professor Flower, from whom these\r\nstatements are taken, remarks in conclusion: “We may call this\r\nconformity to type, without getting much nearer to an explanation of\r\nthe phenomenon;” and he then adds “but is it not powerfully suggestive\r\nof true relationship, of inheritance from a common ancestor?”\r\n\r\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire has strongly insisted on the high importance of\r\nrelative position or connexion in homologous parts; they may differ to\r\nalmost any extent in form and size, and yet remain connected together\r\nin the same invariable order. We never find, for instance, the bones of\r\nthe arm and forearm, or of the thigh and leg, transposed. Hence the\r\nsame names can be given to the homologous bones in widely different\r\nanimals. We see the same great law in the construction of the mouths of\r\ninsects: what can be more different than the immensely long spiral\r\nproboscis of a sphinx-moth, the curious folded one of a bee or bug, and\r\nthe great jaws of a beetle? Yet all these organs, serving for such\r\nwidely different purposes, are formed by infinitely numerous\r\nmodifications of an upper lip, mandibles, and two pairs of maxillæ. The\r\nsame law governs the construction of the mouths and limbs of\r\ncrustaceans. So it is with the flowers of plants.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain this similarity\r\nof pattern in members of the same class, by utility or by the doctrine\r\nof final causes. The hopelessness of the attempt has been expressly\r\nadmitted by Owen in his most interesting work on the “Nature of Limbs.”\r\nOn the ordinary view of the independent creation of each being, we can\r\nonly say that so it is; that it has pleased the Creator to construct\r\nall the animals and plants in each great class on a uniform plan; but\r\nthis is not a scientific explanation.\r\n\r\nThe explanation is to a large extent simple, on the theory of the\r\nselection of successive slight modifications, each being profitable in\r\nsome way to the modified form, but often affecting by correlation other\r\nparts of the organisation. In changes of this nature, there will be\r\nlittle or no tendency to alter the original pattern, or to transpose\r\nthe parts. The bones of a limb might be shortened and flattened to any\r\nextent, becoming at the same time enveloped in thick membrane, so as to\r\nserve as a fin; or a webbed hand might have all its bones, or certain\r\nbones, lengthened to any extent, with the membrane connecting them\r\nincreased, so as to serve as a wing; yet all these modifications would\r\nnot tend to alter the framework of the bones or the relative connexion\r\nof the parts. If we suppose that an early progenitor—the archetype, as\r\nit may be called—of all mammals, birds and reptiles, had its limbs\r\nconstructed on the existing general pattern, for whatever purpose they\r\nserved, we can at once perceive the plain signification of the\r\nhomologous construction of the limbs throughout the class. So with the\r\nmouths of insects, we have only to suppose that their common progenitor\r\nhad an upper lip, mandibles, and two pairs of maxillæ, these parts\r\nbeing perhaps very simple in form; and then natural selection will\r\naccount for the infinite diversity in structure and function of the\r\nmouths of insects. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the general\r\npattern of an organ might become so much obscured as to be finally\r\nlost, by the reduction and ultimately by the complete abortion of\r\ncertain parts, by the fusion of other parts, and by the doubling or\r\nmultiplication of others, variations which we know to be within the\r\nlimits of possibility. In the paddles of the gigantic extinct\r\nsea-lizards, and in the mouths of certain suctorial crustaceans, the\r\ngeneral pattern seems thus to have become partially obscured.\r\n\r\nThere is another and equally curious branch of our subject; namely,\r\nserial homologies, or the comparison of the different parts or organs\r\nin the same individual, and not of the same parts or organs in\r\ndifferent members of the same class. Most physiologists believe that\r\nthe bones of the skull are homologous—that is, correspond in number and\r\nin relative connexion—with the elemental parts of a certain number of\r\nvertebræ. The anterior and posterior limbs in all the higher vertebrate\r\nclasses are plainly homologous. So it is with the wonderfully complex\r\njaws and legs of crustaceans. It is familiar to almost every one, that\r\nin a flower the relative position of the sepals, petals, stamens, and\r\npistils, as well as their intimate structure, are intelligible on the\r\nview that they consist of metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire. In\r\nmonstrous plants, we often get direct evidence of the possibility of\r\none organ being transformed into another; and we can actually see,\r\nduring the early or embryonic stages of development in flowers, as well\r\nas in crustaceans and many other animals, that organs, which when\r\nmature become extremely different are at first exactly alike.\r\n\r\nHow inexplicable are the cases of serial homologies on the ordinary\r\nview of creation! Why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of\r\nsuch numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone apparently\r\nrepresenting vertebræ? As Owen has remarked, the benefit derived from\r\nthe yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition by\r\nmammals, will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls\r\nof birds and reptiles. Why should similar bones have been created to\r\nform the wing and the leg of a bat, used as they are for such totally\r\ndifferent purposes, namely flying and walking? Why should one\r\ncrustacean, which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts,\r\nconsequently always have fewer legs; or conversely, those with many\r\nlegs have simpler mouths? Why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and\r\npistils, in each flower, though fitted for such distinct purposes, be\r\nall constructed on the same pattern?\r\n\r\nOn the theory of natural selection, we can, to a certain extent, answer\r\nthese questions. We need not here consider how the bodies of some\r\nanimals first became divided into a series of segments, or how they\r\nbecame divided into right and left sides, with corresponding organs,\r\nfor such questions are almost beyond investigation. It is, however,\r\nprobable that some serial structures are the result of cells\r\nmultiplying by division, entailing the multiplication of the parts\r\ndeveloped from such cells. It must suffice for our purpose to bear in\r\nmind that an indefinite repetition of the same part or organ is the\r\ncommon characteristic, as Owen has remarked, of all low or little\r\nspecialised forms; therefore the unknown progenitor of the Vertebrata\r\nprobably possessed many vertebræ; the unknown progenitor of the\r\nArticulata, many segments; and the unknown progenitor of flowering\r\nplants, many leaves arranged in one or more spires. We have also\r\nformerly seen that parts many times repeated are eminently liable to\r\nvary, not only in number, but in form. Consequently such parts, being\r\nalready present in considerable numbers, and being highly variable,\r\nwould naturally afford the materials for adaptation to the most\r\ndifferent purposes; yet they would generally retain, through the force\r\nof inheritance, plain traces of their original or fundamental\r\nresemblance. They would retain this resemblance all the more, as the\r\nvariations, which afforded the basis for their subsequent modification\r\nthrough natural selection, would tend from the first to be similar; the\r\nparts being at an early stage of growth alike, and being subjected to\r\nnearly the same conditions. Such parts, whether more or less modified,\r\nunless their common origin became wholly obscured, would be serially\r\nhomologous.\r\n\r\nIn the great class of molluscs, though the parts in distinct species\r\ncan be shown to be homologous, only a few serial homologies; such as\r\nthe valves of Chitons, can be indicated; that is, we are seldom enabled\r\nto say that one part is homologous with another part in the same\r\nindividual. And we can understand this fact; for in molluscs, even in\r\nthe lowest members of the class, we do not find nearly so much\r\nindefinite repetition of any one part as we find in the other great\r\nclasses of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.\r\n\r\nBut morphology is a much more complex subject than it at first appears,\r\nas has lately been well shown in a remarkable paper by Mr. E. Ray\r\nLankester, who has drawn an important distinction between certain\r\nclasses of cases which have all been equally ranked by naturalists as\r\nhomologous. He proposes to call the structures which resemble each\r\nother in distinct animals, owing to their descent from a common\r\nprogenitor with subsequent modification, _homogenous;_ and the\r\nresemblances which cannot thus be accounted for, he proposes to call\r\n_homoplastic_. For instance, he believes that the hearts of birds and\r\nmammals are as a whole homogenous—that is, have been derived from a\r\ncommon progenitor; but that the four cavities of the heart in the two\r\nclasses are homoplastic—that is, have been independently developed. Mr.\r\nLankester also adduces the close resemblance of the parts on the right\r\nand left sides of the body, and in the successive segments of the same\r\nindividual animal; and here we have parts commonly called homologous\r\nwhich bear no relation to the descent of distinct species from a common\r\nprogenitor. Homoplastic structures are the same with those which I have\r\nclassed, though in a very imperfect manner, as analogous modifications\r\nor resemblances. Their formation may be attributed in part to distinct\r\norganisms, or to distinct parts of the same organism, having varied in\r\nan analogous manner; and in part to similar modifications, having been\r\npreserved for the same general purpose or function, of which many\r\ninstances have been given.\r\n\r\nNaturalists frequently speak of the skull as formed of metamorphosed\r\nvertebræ; the jaws of crabs as metamorphosed legs; the stamens and\r\npistils in flowers as metamorphosed leaves; but it would in most cases\r\nbe more correct, as Professor Huxley has remarked, to speak of both\r\nskull and vertebræ, jaws and legs, &c., as having been metamorphosed,\r\nnot one from the other, as they now exist, but from some common and\r\nsimpler element. Most naturalists, however, use such language only in a\r\nmetaphorical sense: they are far from meaning that during a long course\r\nof descent, primordial organs of any kind—vertebræ in the one case and\r\nlegs in the other—have actually been converted into skulls or jaws. Yet\r\nso strong is the appearance of this having occurred that naturalists\r\ncan hardly avoid employing language having this plain signification.\r\nAccording to the views here maintained, such language may be used\r\nliterally; and the wonderful fact of the jaws, for instance, of a crab\r\nretaining numerous characters, which they probably would have retained\r\nthrough inheritance, if they had really been metamorphosed from true\r\nthough extremely simple legs, is in part explained.\r\n\r\n_Development and Embryology._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most important subjects in the whole round of\r\nnatural history. The metamorphoses of insects, with which every one is\r\nfamiliar, are generally effected abruptly by a few stages; but the\r\ntransformations are in reality numerous and gradual, though concealed.\r\nA certain ephemerous insect (Chlöeon) during its development, moults,\r\nas shown by Sir J. Lubbock, above twenty times, and each time undergoes\r\na certain amount of change; and in this case we see the act of\r\nmetamorphosis performed in a primary and gradual manner. Many insects,\r\nand especially certain crustaceans, show us what wonderful changes of\r\nstructure can be effected during development. Such changes, however,\r\nreach their acme in the so-called alternate generations of some of the\r\nlower animals. It is, for instance, an astonishing fact that a delicate\r\nbranching coralline, studded with polypi, and attached to a submarine\r\nrock, should produce, first by budding and then by transverse division,\r\na host of huge floating jelly-fishes; and that these should produce\r\neggs, from which are hatched swimming animalcules, which attach\r\nthemselves to rocks and become developed into branching corallines; and\r\nso on in an endless cycle. The belief in the essential identity of the\r\nprocess of alternate generation and of ordinary metamorphosis has been\r\ngreatly strengthened by Wagner’s discovery of the larva or maggot of a\r\nfly, namely the Cecidomyia, producing asexually other larvæ, and these\r\nothers, which finally are developed into mature males and females,\r\npropagating their kind in the ordinary manner by eggs.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth notice that when Wagner’s remarkable discovery was\r\nfirst announced, I was asked how was it possible to account for the\r\nlarvæ of this fly having acquired the power of a sexual reproduction.\r\nAs long as the case remained unique no answer could be given. But\r\nalready Grimm has shown that another fly, a Chironomus, reproduces\r\nitself in nearly the same manner, and he believes that this occurs\r\nfrequently in the order. It is the pupa, and not the larva, of the\r\nChironomus which has this power; and Grimm further shows that this\r\ncase, to a certain extent, “unites that of the Cecidomyia with the\r\nparthenogenesis of the Coccidæ;” the term parthenogenesis implying that\r\nthe mature females of the Coccidæ are capable of producing fertile eggs\r\nwithout the concourse of the male. Certain animals belonging to several\r\nclasses are now known to have the power of ordinary reproduction at an\r\nunusually early age; and we have only to accelerate parthenogenetic\r\nreproduction by gradual steps to an earlier and earlier age—Chironomus\r\nshowing us an almost exactly intermediate stage, viz., that of the\r\npupa—and we can perhaps account for the marvellous case of the\r\nCecidomyia.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that various parts in the same individual,\r\nwhich are exactly alike during an early embryonic period, become widely\r\ndifferent and serve for widely different purposes in the adult state.\r\nSo again it has been shown that generally the embryos of the most\r\ndistinct species belonging to the same class are closely similar, but\r\nbecome, when fully developed, widely dissimilar. A better proof of this\r\nlatter fact cannot be given than the statement by Von Baer that “the\r\nembryos of mammalia, of birds, lizards and snakes, probably also of\r\nchelonia, are in the earliest states exceedingly like one another, both\r\nas a whole and in the mode of development of their parts; so much so,\r\nin fact, that we can often distinguish the embryos only by their size.\r\nIn my possession are two little embryos in spirit, whose names I have\r\nomitted to attach, and at present I am quite unable to say to what\r\nclass they belong. They may be lizards or small birds, or very young\r\nmammalia, so complete is the similarity in the mode of formation of the\r\nhead and trunk in these animals. The extremities, however, are still\r\nabsent in these embryos. But even if they had existed in the earliest\r\nstage of their development we should learn nothing, for the feet of\r\nlizards and mammals, the wings and feet of birds, no less than the\r\nhands and feet of man, all arise from the same fundamental form.” The\r\nlarvæ of most crustaceans, at corresponding stages of development,\r\nclosely resemble each other, however different the adults may become;\r\nand so it is with very many other animals. A trace of the law of\r\nembryonic resemblance occasionally lasts till a rather late age: thus\r\nbirds of the same genus, and of allied genera, often resemble each\r\nother in their immature plumage; as we see in the spotted feathers in\r\nthe young of the thrush group. In the cat tribe, most of the species\r\nwhen adult are striped or spotted in lines; and stripes or spots can be\r\nplainly distinguished in the whelp of the lion and the puma. We\r\noccasionally, though rarely, see something of the same kind in plants;\r\nthus the first leaves of the ulex or furze, and the first leaves of the\r\nphyllodineous acacias, are pinnate or divided like the ordinary leaves\r\nof the leguminosæ.\r\n\r\nThe points of structure, in which the embryos of widely different\r\nanimals within the same class resemble each other, often have no direct\r\nrelation to their conditions of existence. We cannot, for instance,\r\nsuppose that in the embryos of the vertebrata the peculiar loop-like\r\ncourses of the arteries near the branchial slits are related to similar\r\nconditions—in the young mammal which is nourished in the womb of its\r\nmother, in the egg of the bird which is hatched in a nest, and in the\r\nspawn of a frog under water. We have no more reason to believe in such\r\na relation than we have to believe that the similar bones in the hand\r\nof a man, wing of a bat, and fin of a porpoise, are related to similar\r\nconditions of life. No one supposes that the stripes on the whelp of a\r\nlion, or the spots on the young blackbird, are of any use to these\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe case, however, is different when an animal, during any part of its\r\nembryonic career, is active, and has to provide for itself. The period\r\nof activity may come on earlier or later in life; but whenever it comes\r\non, the adaptation of the larva to its conditions of life is just as\r\nperfect and as beautiful as in the adult animal. In how important a\r\nmanner this has acted, has recently been well shown by Sir J. Lubbock\r\nin his remarks on the close similarity of the larvæ of some insects\r\nbelonging to very different orders, and on the dissimilarity of the\r\nlarvæ of other insects within the same order, according to their habits\r\nof life. Owing to such adaptations the similarity of the larvæ of\r\nallied animals is sometimes greatly obscured; especially when there is\r\na division of labour during the different stages of development, as\r\nwhen the same larva has during one stage to search for food, and during\r\nanother stage has to search for a place of attachment. Cases can even\r\nbe given of the larvæ of allied species, or groups of species,\r\ndiffering more from each other than do the adults. In most cases,\r\nhowever, the larvæ, though active, still obey, more or less closely,\r\nthe law of common embryonic resemblance. Cirripedes afford a good\r\ninstance of this: even the illustrious Cuvier did not perceive that a\r\nbarnacle was a crustacean: but a glance at the larva shows this in an\r\nunmistakable manner. So again the two main divisions of cirripedes, the\r\npedunculated and sessile, though differing widely in external\r\nappearance, have larvæ in all their stages barely distinguishable.\r\n\r\nThe embryo in the course of development generally rises in\r\norganisation. I use this expression, though I am aware that it is\r\nhardly possible to define clearly what is meant by organisation being\r\nhigher or lower. But no one probably will dispute that the butterfly is\r\nhigher than the caterpillar. In some cases, however, the mature animal\r\nmust be considered as lower in the scale than the larva, as with\r\ncertain parasitic crustaceans. To refer once again to cirripedes: the\r\nlarvæ in the first stage have three pairs of locomotive organs, a\r\nsimple single eye, and a probosciformed mouth, with which they feed\r\nlargely, for they increase much in size. In the second stage, answering\r\nto the chrysalis stage of butterflies, they have six pairs of\r\nbeautifully constructed natatory legs, a pair of magnificent compound\r\neyes, and extremely complex antennæ; but they have a closed and\r\nimperfect mouth, and cannot feed: their function at this stage is, to\r\nsearch out by their well-developed organs of sense, and to reach by\r\ntheir active powers of swimming, a proper place on which to become\r\nattached and to undergo their final metamorphosis. When this is\r\ncompleted they are fixed for life: their legs are now converted into\r\nprehensile organs; they again obtain a well-constructed mouth; but they\r\nhave no antennæ, and their two eyes are now reconverted into a minute,\r\nsingle, simple eye-spot. In this last and complete state, cirripedes\r\nmay be considered as either more highly or more lowly organised than\r\nthey were in the larval condition. But in some genera the larvæ become\r\ndeveloped into hermaphrodites having the ordinary structure, or into\r\nwhat I have called complemental males; and in the latter the\r\ndevelopment has assuredly been retrograde; for the male is a mere sack,\r\nwhich lives for a short time and is destitute of mouth, stomach, and\r\nevery other organ of importance, excepting those for reproduction.\r\n\r\nWe are so much accustomed to see a difference in structure between the\r\nembryo and the adult, that we are tempted to look at this difference as\r\nin some necessary manner contingent on growth. But there is no reason\r\nwhy, for instance, the wing of a bat, or the fin of a porpoise, should\r\nnot have been sketched out with all their parts in proper proportion,\r\nas soon as any part became visible. In some whole groups of animals and\r\nin certain members of other groups this is the case, and the embryo\r\ndoes not at any period differ widely from the adult: thus Owen has\r\nremarked in regard to cuttle-fish, “there is no metamorphosis; the\r\ncephalopodic character is manifested long before the parts of the\r\nembryo are completed.” Land-shells and fresh-water crustaceans are born\r\nhaving their proper forms, while the marine members of the same two\r\ngreat classes pass through considerable and often great changes during\r\ntheir development. Spiders, again, barely undergo any metamorphosis.\r\nThe larvæ of most insects pass through a worm-like stage, whether they\r\nare active and adapted to diversified habits, or are inactive from\r\nbeing placed in the midst of proper nutriment, or from being fed by\r\ntheir parents; but in some few cases, as in that of Aphis, if we look\r\nto the admirable drawings of the development of this insect, by\r\nProfessor Huxley, we see hardly any trace of the vermiform stage.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is only the earlier developmental stages which fail. Thus,\r\nFritz Müller has made the remarkable discovery that certain shrimp-like\r\ncrustaceans (allied to Penoeus) first appear under the simple\r\nnauplius-form, and after passing through two or more zoëa-stages, and\r\nthen through the mysis-stage, finally acquire their mature structure:\r\nnow in the whole great malacostracan order, to which these crustaceans\r\nbelong, no other member is as yet known to be first developed under the\r\nnauplius-form, though many appear as zoëas; nevertheless Müller assigns\r\nreasons for his belief, that if there had been no suppression of\r\ndevelopment, all these crustaceans would have appeared as nauplii.\r\n\r\nHow, then, can we explain these several facts in embryology—namely, the\r\nvery general, though not universal, difference in structure between the\r\nembryo and the adult; the various parts in the same individual embryo,\r\nwhich ultimately become very unlike, and serve for diverse purposes,\r\nbeing at an early period of growth alike; the common, but not\r\ninvariable, resemblance between the embryos or larvæ of the most\r\ndistinct species in the same class; the embryo often retaining, while\r\nwithin the egg or womb, structures which are of no service to it,\r\neither at that or at a later period of life; on the other hand, larvæ\r\nwhich have to provide for their own wants, being perfectly adapted to\r\nthe surrounding conditions; and lastly, the fact of certain larvæ\r\nstanding higher in the scale of organisation than the mature animal\r\ninto which they are developed? I believe that all these facts can be\r\nexplained as follows.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly assumed, perhaps from monstrosities affecting the embryo\r\nat a very early period, that slight variations or individual\r\ndifferences necessarily appear at an equally early period. We have\r\nlittle evidence on this head, but what we have certainly points the\r\nother way; for it is notorious that breeders of cattle, horses and\r\nvarious fancy animals, cannot positively tell, until some time after\r\nbirth, what will be the merits and demerits of their young animals. We\r\nsee this plainly in our own children; we cannot tell whether a child\r\nwill be tall or short, or what its precise features will be. The\r\nquestion is not, at what period of life any variation may have been\r\ncaused, but at what period the effects are displayed. The cause may\r\nhave acted, and I believe often has acted, on one or both parents\r\nbefore the act of generation. It deserves notice that it is of no\r\nimportance to a very young animal, as long as it is nourished and\r\nprotected by its parent, whether most of its characters are acquired a\r\nlittle earlier or later in life. It would not signify, for instance, to\r\na bird which obtained its food by having a much-curved beak whether or\r\nnot while young it possessed a beak of this shape, as long as it was\r\nfed by its parents.\r\n\r\nI have stated in the first chapter, that at whatever age any variation\r\nfirst appears in the parent, it tends to reappear at a corresponding\r\nage in the offspring. Certain variations can only appear at\r\ncorresponding ages; for instance, peculiarities in the caterpillar,\r\ncocoon, or imago states of the silk-moth; or, again, in the full-grown\r\nhorns of cattle. But variations which, for all that we can see might\r\nhave appeared either earlier or later in life, likewise tend to\r\nreappear at a corresponding age in the offspring and parent. I am far\r\nfrom meaning that this is invariably the case, and I could give several\r\nexceptional cases of variations (taking the word in the largest sense)\r\nwhich have supervened at an earlier age in the child than in the\r\nparent.\r\n\r\nThese two principles, namely, that slight variations generally appear\r\nat a not very early period of life, and are inherited at a\r\ncorresponding not early period, explain, as I believe, all the above\r\nspecified leading facts in embryology. But first let us look to a few\r\nanalogous cases in our domestic varieties. Some authors who have\r\nwritten on Dogs maintain that the greyhound and bull-dog, though so\r\ndifferent, are really closely allied varieties, descended from the same\r\nwild stock, hence I was curious to see how far their puppies differed\r\nfrom each other. I was told by breeders that they differed just as much\r\nas their parents, and this, judging by the eye, seemed almost to be the\r\ncase; but on actually measuring the old dogs and their six-days-old\r\npuppies, I found that the puppies had not acquired nearly their full\r\namount of proportional difference. So, again, I was told that the foals\r\nof cart and race-horses—breeds which have been almost wholly formed by\r\nselection under domestication—differed as much as the full-grown\r\nanimals; but having had careful measurements made of the dams and of\r\nthree-days-old colts of race and heavy cart-horses, I find that this is\r\nby no means the case.\r\n\r\nAs we have conclusive evidence that the breeds of the Pigeon are\r\ndescended from a single wild species, I compared the young pigeons\r\nwithin twelve hours after being hatched. I carefully measured the\r\nproportions (but will not here give the details) of the beak, width of\r\nmouth, length of nostril and of eyelid, size of feet and length of leg,\r\nin the wild parent species, in pouters, fantails, runts, barbs,\r\ndragons, carriers, and tumblers. Now, some of these birds, when mature,\r\ndiffer in so extraordinary a manner in the length and form of beak, and\r\nin other characters, that they would certainly have been ranked as\r\ndistinct genera if found in a state of nature. But when the nestling\r\nbirds of these several breeds were placed in a row, though most of them\r\ncould just be distinguished, the proportional differences in the above\r\nspecified points were incomparably less than in the full-grown birds.\r\nSome characteristic points of difference—for instance, that of the\r\nwidth of mouth—could hardly be detected in the young. But there was one\r\nremarkable exception to this rule, for the young of the short-faced\r\ntumbler differed from the young of the wild rock-pigeon, and of the\r\nother breeds, in almost exactly the same proportions as in the adult\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nThese facts are explained by the above two principles. Fanciers select\r\ntheir dogs, horses, pigeons, &c., for breeding, when nearly grown up.\r\nThey are indifferent whether the desired qualities are acquired earlier\r\nor later in life, if the full-grown animal possesses them. And the\r\ncases just given, more especially that of the pigeons, show that the\r\ncharacteristic differences which have been accumulated by man’s\r\nselection, and which give value to his breeds, do not generally appear\r\nat a very early period of life, and are inherited at a corresponding\r\nnot early period. But the case of the short-faced tumbler, which when\r\ntwelve hours old possessed its proper characters, proves that this is\r\nnot the universal rule; for here the characteristic differences must\r\neither have appeared at an earlier period than usual, or, if not so,\r\nthe differences must have been inherited, not at a corresponding, but\r\nat an earlier age.\r\n\r\nNow, let us apply these two principles to species in a state of nature.\r\nLet us take a group of birds, descended from some ancient form and\r\nmodified through natural selection for different habits. Then, from the\r\nmany slight successive variations having supervened in the several\r\nspecies at a not early age, and having been inherited at a\r\ncorresponding age, the young will have been but little modified, and\r\nthey will still resemble each other much more closely than do the\r\nadults, just as we have seen with the breeds of the pigeon. We may\r\nextend this view to widely distinct structures and to whole classes.\r\nThe fore-limbs, for instance, which once served as legs to a remote\r\nprogenitor, may have become, through a long course of modification,\r\nadapted in one descendant to act as hands, in another as paddles, in\r\nanother as wings; but on the above two principles the fore-limbs will\r\nnot have been much modified in the embryos of these several forms;\r\nalthough in each form the fore-limb will differ greatly in the adult\r\nstate. Whatever influence long continued use or disuse may have had in\r\nmodifying the limbs or other parts of any species, this will chiefly or\r\nsolely have affected it when nearly mature, when it was compelled to\r\nuse its full powers to gain its own living; and the effects thus\r\nproduced will have been transmitted to the offspring at a corresponding\r\nnearly mature age. Thus the young will not be modified, or will be\r\nmodified only in a slight degree, through the effects of the increased\r\nuse or disuse of parts.\r\n\r\nWith some animals the successive variations may have supervened at a\r\nvery early period of life, or the steps may have been inherited at an\r\nearlier age than that at which they first occurred. In either of these\r\ncases the young or embryo will closely resemble the mature parent-form,\r\nas we have seen with the short-faced tumbler. And this is the rule of\r\ndevelopment in certain whole groups, or in certain sub-groups alone, as\r\nwith cuttle-fish, land-shells, fresh-water crustaceans, spiders, and\r\nsome members of the great class of insects. With respect to the final\r\ncause of the young in such groups not passing through any\r\nmetamorphosis, we can see that this would follow from the following\r\ncontingencies: namely, from the young having to provide at a very early\r\nage for their own wants, and from their following the same habits of\r\nlife with their parents; for in this case it would be indispensable for\r\ntheir existence that they should be modified in the same manner as\r\ntheir parents. Again, with respect to the singular fact that many\r\nterrestrial and fresh-water animals do not undergo any metamorphosis,\r\nwhile marine members of the same groups pass through various\r\ntransformations, Fritz Müller has suggested that the process of slowly\r\nmodifying and adapting an animal to live on the land or in fresh water,\r\ninstead of in the sea, would be greatly simplified by its not passing\r\nthrough any larval stage; for it is not probable that places well\r\nadapted for both the larval and mature stages, under such new and\r\ngreatly changed habits of life, would commonly be found unoccupied or\r\nill-occupied by other organisms. In this case the gradual acquirement\r\nat an earlier and earlier age of the adult structure would be favoured\r\nby natural selection; and all traces of former metamorphoses would\r\nfinally be lost.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, it profited the young of an animal to follow\r\nhabits of life slightly different from those of the parent-form, and\r\nconsequently to be constructed on a slightly different plan, or if it\r\nprofited a larva already different from its parent to change still\r\nfurther, then, on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages,\r\nthe young or the larvæ might be rendered by natural selection more and\r\nmore different from their parents to any conceivable extent.\r\nDifferences in the larva might, also, become correlated with successive\r\nstages of its development; so that the larva, in the first stage, might\r\ncome to differ greatly from the larva in the second stage, as is the\r\ncase with many animals. The adult might also become fitted for sites or\r\nhabits, in which organs of locomotion or of the senses, &c., would be\r\nuseless; and in this case the metamorphosis would be retrograde.\r\n\r\nFrom the remarks just made we can see how by changes of structure in\r\nthe young, in conformity with changed habits of life, together with\r\ninheritance at corresponding ages, animals might come to pass through\r\nstages of development, perfectly distinct from the primordial condition\r\nof their adult progenitors. Most of our best authorities are now\r\nconvinced that the various larval and pupal stages of insects have thus\r\nbeen acquired through adaptation, and not through inheritance from some\r\nancient form. The curious case of Sitaris—a beetle which passes through\r\ncertain unusual stages of development—will illustrate how this might\r\noccur. The first larval form is described by M. Fabre, as an active,\r\nminute insect, furnished with six legs, two long antennæ, and four\r\neyes. These larvæ are hatched in the nests of bees; and when the male\r\nbees emerge from their burrows, in the spring, which they do before the\r\nfemales, the larvæ spring on them, and afterwards crawl on to the\r\nfemales while paired with the males. As soon as the female bee deposits\r\nher eggs on the surface of the honey stored in the cells, the larvæ of\r\nthe Sitaris leap on the eggs and devour them. Afterwards they undergo a\r\ncomplete change; their eyes disappear; their legs and antennæ become\r\nrudimentary, and they feed on honey; so that they now more closely\r\nresemble the ordinary larvæ of insects; ultimately they undergo a\r\nfurther transformation, and finally emerge as the perfect beetle. Now,\r\nif an insect, undergoing transformations like those of the Sitaris,\r\nwere to become the progenitor of a whole new class of insects, the\r\ncourse of development of the new class would be widely different from\r\nthat of our existing insects; and the first larval stage certainly\r\nwould not represent the former condition of any adult and ancient form.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand it is highly probable that with many animals the\r\nembryonic or larval stages show us, more or less completely, the\r\ncondition of the progenitor of the whole group in its adult state. In\r\nthe great class of the Crustacea, forms wonderfully distinct from each\r\nother, namely, suctorial parasites, cirripedes, entomostraca, and even\r\nthe malacostraca, appear at first as larvæ under the nauplius-form; and\r\nas these larvæ live and feed in the open sea, and are not adapted for\r\nany peculiar habits of life, and from other reasons assigned by Fritz\r\nMüller, it is probable that at some very remote period an independent\r\nadult animal, resembling the Nauplius, existed, and subsequently\r\nproduced, along several divergent lines of descent, the above-named\r\ngreat Crustacean groups. So again, it is probable, from what we know of\r\nthe embryos of mammals, birds, fishes and reptiles, that these animals\r\nare the modified descendants of some ancient progenitor, which was\r\nfurnished in its adult state with branchiæ, a swim-bladder, four\r\nfin-like limbs, and a long tail, all fitted for an aquatic life.\r\n\r\nAs all the organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever lived,\r\ncan be arranged within a few great classes; and as all within each\r\nclass have, according to our theory, been connected together by fine\r\ngradations, the best, and, if our collections were nearly perfect, the\r\nonly possible arrangement, would be genealogical; descent being the\r\nhidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been seeking under the\r\nterm of the Natural System. On this view we can understand how it is\r\nthat, in the eyes of most naturalists, the structure of the embryo is\r\neven more important for classification than that of the adult. In two\r\nor more groups of animals, however much they may differ from each other\r\nin structure and habits in their adult condition, if they pass through\r\nclosely similar embryonic stages, we may feel assured that they are all\r\ndescended from one parent-form, and are therefore closely related.\r\nThus, community in embryonic structure reveals community of descent;\r\nbut dissimilarity in embryonic development does not prove discommunity\r\nof descent, for in one of two groups the developmental stages may have\r\nbeen suppressed, or may have been so greatly modified through\r\nadaptation to new habits of life as to be no longer recognisable. Even\r\nin groups, in which the adults have been modified to an extreme degree,\r\ncommunity of origin is often revealed by the structure of the larvæ; we\r\nhave seen, for instance, that cirripedes, though externally so like\r\nshell-fish, are at once known by their larvæ to belong to the great\r\nclass of crustaceans. As the embryo often shows us more or less plainly\r\nthe structure of the less modified and ancient progenitor of the group,\r\nwe can see why ancient and extinct forms so often resemble in their\r\nadult state the embryos of existing species of the same class. Agassiz\r\nbelieves this to be a universal law of nature; and we may hope\r\nhereafter to see the law proved true. It can, however, be proved true\r\nonly in those cases in which the ancient state of the progenitor of the\r\ngroup has not been wholly obliterated, either by successive variations\r\nhaving supervened at a very early period of growth, or by such\r\nvariations having been inherited at an earlier age than that at which\r\nthey first appeared. It should also be borne in mind, that the law may\r\nbe true, but yet, owing to the geological record not extending far\r\nenough back in time, may remain for a long period, or for ever,\r\nincapable of demonstration. The law will not strictly hold good in\r\nthose cases in which an ancient form became adapted in its larval state\r\nto some special line of life, and transmitted the same larval state to\r\na whole group of descendants; for such larval state will not resemble\r\nany still more ancient form in its adult state.\r\n\r\nThus, as it seems to me, the leading facts in embryology, which are\r\nsecond to none in importance, are explained on the principle of\r\nvariations in the many descendants from some one ancient progenitor,\r\nhaving appeared at a not very early period of life, and having been\r\ninherited at a corresponding period. Embryology rises greatly in\r\ninterest, when we look at the embryo as a picture, more or less\r\nobscured, of the progenitor, either in its adult or larval state, of\r\nall the members of the same great class.\r\n\r\n_Rudimentary, Atrophied, and Aborted Organs._\r\n\r\n\r\nOrgans or parts in this strange condition, bearing the plain stamp of\r\ninutility, are extremely common, or even general, throughout nature. It\r\nwould be impossible to name one of the higher animals in which some\r\npart or other is not in a rudimentary condition. In the mammalia, for\r\ninstance, the males possess rudimentary mammæ; in snakes one lobe of\r\nthe lungs is rudimentary; in birds the “bastard-wing” may safely be\r\nconsidered as a rudimentary digit, and in some species the whole wing\r\nis so far rudimentary that it cannot be used for flight. What can be\r\nmore curious than the presence of teeth in foetal whales, which when\r\ngrown up have not a tooth in their heads; or the teeth, which never cut\r\nthrough the gums, in the upper jaws of unborn calves?\r\n\r\nRudimentary organs plainly declare their origin and meaning in various\r\nways. There are beetles belonging to closely allied species, or even to\r\nthe same identical species, which have either full-sized and perfect\r\nwings, or mere rudiments of membrane, which not rarely lie under\r\nwing-covers firmly soldered together; and in these cases it is\r\nimpossible to doubt, that the rudiments represent wings. Rudimentary\r\norgans sometimes retain their potentiality: this occasionally occurs\r\nwith the mammæ of male mammals, which have been known to become well\r\ndeveloped and to secrete milk. So again in the udders of the genus Bos,\r\nthere are normally four developed and two rudimentary teats; but the\r\nlatter in our domestic cows sometimes become well developed and yield\r\nmilk. In regard to plants, the petals are sometimes rudimentary, and\r\nsometimes well developed in the individuals of the same species. In\r\ncertain plants having separated sexes Kölreuter found that by crossing\r\na species, in which the male flowers included a rudiment of a pistil,\r\nwith an hermaphrodite species, having of course a well-developed\r\npistil, the rudiment in the hybrid offspring was much increased in\r\nsize; and this clearly shows that the rudimentary and perfect pistils\r\nare essentially alike in nature. An animal may possess various parts in\r\na perfect state, and yet they may in one sense be rudimentary, for they\r\nare useless: thus the tadpole of the common salamander or water-newt,\r\nas Mr. G.H. Lewes remarks, “has gills, and passes its existence in the\r\nwater; but the Salamandra atra, which lives high up among the\r\nmountains, brings forth its young full-formed. This animal never lives\r\nin the water. Yet if we open a gravid female, we find tadpoles inside\r\nher with exquisitely feathered gills; and when placed in water they\r\nswim about like the tadpoles of the water-newt. Obviously this aquatic\r\norganisation has no reference to the future life of the animal, nor has\r\nit any adaptation to its embryonic condition; it has solely reference\r\nto ancestral adaptations, it repeats a phase in the development of its\r\nprogenitors.”\r\n\r\nAn organ, serving for two purposes, may become rudimentary or utterly\r\naborted for one, even the more important purpose, and remain perfectly\r\nefficient for the other. Thus, in plants, the office of the pistil is\r\nto allow the pollen-tubes to reach the ovules within the ovarium. The\r\npistil consists of a stigma supported on the style; but in some\r\nCompositæ, the male florets, which of course cannot be fecundated, have\r\na rudimentary pistil, for it is not crowned with a stigma; but the\r\nstyle remains well developed and is clothed in the usual manner with\r\nhairs, which serve to brush the pollen out of the surrounding and\r\nconjoined anthers. Again, an organ may become rudimentary for its\r\nproper purpose, and be used for a distinct one: in certain fishes the\r\nswim-bladder seems to be rudimentary for its proper function of giving\r\nbuoyancy, but has become converted into a nascent breathing organ or\r\nlung. Many similar instances could be given.\r\n\r\nUseful organs, however little they may be developed, unless we have\r\nreason to suppose that they were formerly more highly developed, ought\r\nnot to be considered as rudimentary. They may be in a nascent\r\ncondition, and in progress towards further development. Rudimentary\r\norgans, on the other hand, are either quite useless, such as teeth\r\nwhich never cut through the gums, or almost useless, such as the wings\r\nof an ostrich, which serve merely as sails. As organs in this condition\r\nwould formerly, when still less developed, have been of even less use\r\nthan at present, they cannot formerly have been produced through\r\nvariation and natural selection, which acts solely by the preservation\r\nof useful modifications. They have been partially retained by the power\r\nof inheritance, and relate to a former state of things. It is, however,\r\noften difficult to distinguish between rudimentary and nascent organs;\r\nfor we can judge only by analogy whether a part is capable of further\r\ndevelopment, in which case alone it deserves to be called nascent.\r\nOrgans in this condition will always be somewhat rare; for beings thus\r\nprovided will commonly have been supplanted by their successors with\r\nthe same organ in a more perfect state, and consequently will have\r\nbecome long ago extinct. The wing of the penguin is of high service,\r\nacting as a fin; it may, therefore, represent the nascent state of the\r\nwing: not that I believe this to be the case; it is more probably a\r\nreduced organ, modified for a new function: the wing of the Apteryx, on\r\nthe other hand, is quite useless, and is truly rudimentary. Owen\r\nconsiders the simple filamentary limbs of the Lepidosiren as the\r\n“beginnings of organs which attain full functional development in\r\nhigher vertebrates;” but, according to the view lately advocated by Dr.\r\nGünther, they are probably remnants, consisting of the persistent axis\r\nof a fin, with the lateral rays or branches aborted. The mammary glands\r\nof the Ornithorhynchus may be considered, in comparison with the udders\r\nof a cow, as in a nascent condition. The ovigerous frena of certain\r\ncirripedes, which have ceased to give attachment to the ova and are\r\nfeebly developed, are nascent branchiæ.\r\n\r\nRudimentary organs in the individuals of the same species are very\r\nliable to vary in the degree of their development and in other\r\nrespects. In closely allied species, also, the extent to which the same\r\norgan has been reduced occasionally differs much. This latter fact is\r\nwell exemplified in the state of the wings of female moths belonging to\r\nthe same family. Rudimentary organs may be utterly aborted; and this\r\nimplies, that in certain animals or plants, parts are entirely absent\r\nwhich analogy would lead us to expect to find in them, and which are\r\noccasionally found in monstrous individuals. Thus in most of the\r\nScrophulariaceæ the fifth stamen is utterly aborted; yet we may\r\nconclude that a fifth stamen once existed, for a rudiment of it is\r\nfound in many species of the family, and this rudiment occasionally\r\nbecomes perfectly developed, as may sometimes be seen in the common\r\nsnap-dragon. In tracing the homologies of any part in different members\r\nof the same class, nothing is more common, or, in order fully to\r\nunderstand the relations of the parts, more useful than the discovery\r\nof rudiments. This is well shown in the drawings given by Owen of the\r\nleg bones of the horse, ox, and rhinoceros.\r\n\r\nIt is an important fact that rudimentary organs, such as teeth in the\r\nupper jaws of whales and ruminants, can often be detected in the\r\nembryo, but afterwards wholly disappear. It is also, I believe, a\r\nuniversal rule, that a rudimentary part is of greater size in the\r\nembryo relatively to the adjoining parts, than in the adult; so that\r\nthe organ at this early age is less rudimentary, or even cannot be said\r\nto be in any degree rudimentary. Hence rudimentary organs in the adult\r\nare often said to have retained their embryonic condition.\r\n\r\nI have now given the leading facts with respect to rudimentary organs.\r\nIn reflecting on them, every one must be struck with astonishment; for\r\nthe same reasoning power which tells us that most parts and organs are\r\nexquisitely adapted for certain purposes, tells us with equal plainness\r\nthat these rudimentary or atrophied organs are imperfect and useless.\r\nIn works on natural history, rudimentary organs are generally said to\r\nhave been created “for the sake of symmetry,” or in order “to complete\r\nthe scheme of nature.” But this is not an explanation, merely a\r\nrestatement of the fact. Nor is it consistent with itself: thus the\r\nboa-constrictor has rudiments of hind limbs and of a pelvis, and if it\r\nbe said that these bones have been retained “to complete the scheme of\r\nnature,” why, as Professor Weismann asks, have they not been retained\r\nby other snakes, which do not possess even a vestige of these same\r\nbones? What would be thought of an astronomer who maintained that the\r\nsatellites revolve in elliptic courses round their planets “for the\r\nsake of symmetry,” because the planets thus revolve round the sun? An\r\neminent physiologist accounts for the presence of rudimentary organs,\r\nby supposing that they serve to excrete matter in excess, or matter\r\ninjurious to the system; but can we suppose that the minute papilla,\r\nwhich often represents the pistil in male flowers, and which is formed\r\nof mere cellular tissue, can thus act? Can we suppose that rudimentary\r\nteeth, which are subsequently absorbed, are beneficial to the rapidly\r\ngrowing embryonic calf by removing matter so precious as phosphate of\r\nlime? When a man’s fingers have been amputated, imperfect nails have\r\nbeen known to appear on the stumps, and I could as soon believe that\r\nthese vestiges of nails are developed in order to excrete horny matter,\r\nas that the rudimentary nails on the fin of the manatee have been\r\ndeveloped for this same purpose.\r\n\r\nOn the view of descent with modification, the origin of rudimentary\r\norgans is comparatively simple; and we can understand to a large extent\r\nthe laws governing their imperfect development. We have plenty of cases\r\nof rudimentary organs in our domestic productions, as the stump of a\r\ntail in tailless breeds, the vestige of an ear in earless breeds of\r\nsheep—the reappearance of minute dangling horns in hornless breeds of\r\ncattle, more especially, according to Youatt, in young animals—and the\r\nstate of the whole flower in the cauliflower. We often see rudiments of\r\nvarious parts in monsters; but I doubt whether any of these cases throw\r\nlight on the origin of rudimentary organs in a state of nature, further\r\nthan by showing that rudiments can be produced; for the balance of\r\nevidence clearly indicates that species under nature do not undergo\r\ngreat and abrupt changes. But we learn from the study of our domestic\r\nproductions that the disuse of parts leads to their reduced size; and\r\nthat the result is inherited.\r\n\r\nIt appears probable that disuse has been the main agent in rendering\r\norgans rudimentary. It would at first lead by slow steps to the more\r\nand more complete reduction of a part, until at last it became\r\nrudimentary—as in the case of the eyes of animals inhabiting dark\r\ncaverns, and of the wings of birds inhabiting oceanic islands, which\r\nhave seldom been forced by beasts of prey to take flight, and have\r\nultimately lost the power of flying. Again, an organ, useful under\r\ncertain conditions, might become injurious under others, as with the\r\nwings of beetles living on small and exposed islands; and in this case\r\nnatural selection will have aided in reducing the organ, until it was\r\nrendered harmless and rudimentary.\r\n\r\nAny change in structure and function, which can be effected by small\r\nstages, is within the power of natural selection; so that an organ\r\nrendered, through changed habits of life, useless or injurious for one\r\npurpose, might be modified and used for another purpose. An organ\r\nmight, also, be retained for one alone of its former functions. Organs,\r\noriginally formed by the aid of natural selection, when rendered\r\nuseless may well be variable, for their variations can no longer be\r\nchecked by natural selection. All this agrees well with what we see\r\nunder nature. Moreover, at whatever period of life either disuse or\r\nselection reduces an organ, and this will generally be when the being\r\nhas come to maturity and to exert its full powers of action, the\r\nprinciple of inheritance at corresponding ages will tend to reproduce\r\nthe organ in its reduced state at the same mature age, but will seldom\r\naffect it in the embryo. Thus we can understand the greater size of\r\nrudimentary organs in the embryo relatively to the adjoining parts, and\r\ntheir lesser relative size in the adult. If, for instance, the digit of\r\nan adult animal was used less and less during many generations, owing\r\nto some change of habits, or if an organ or gland was less and less\r\nfunctionally exercised, we may infer that it would become reduced in\r\nsize in the adult descendants of this animal, but would retain nearly\r\nits original standard of development in the embryo.\r\n\r\nThere remains, however, this difficulty. After an organ has ceased\r\nbeing used, and has become in consequence much reduced, how can it be\r\nstill further reduced in size until the merest vestige is left; and how\r\ncan it be finally quite obliterated? It is scarcely possible that\r\ndisuse can go on producing any further effect after the organ has once\r\nbeen rendered functionless. Some additional explanation is here\r\nrequisite which I cannot give. If, for instance, it could be proved\r\nthat every part of the organisation tends to vary in a greater degree\r\ntowards diminution than toward augmentation of size, then we should be\r\nable to understand how an organ which has become useless would be\r\nrendered, independently of the effects of disuse, rudimentary and would\r\nat last be wholly suppressed; for the variations towards diminished\r\nsize would no longer be checked by natural selection. The principle of\r\nthe economy of growth, explained in a former chapter, by which the\r\nmaterials forming any part, if not useful to the possessor, are saved\r\nas far as is possible, will perhaps come into play in rendering a\r\nuseless part rudimentary. But this principle will almost necessarily be\r\nconfined to the earlier stages of the process of reduction; for we\r\ncannot suppose that a minute papilla, for instance, representing in a\r\nmale flower the pistil of the female flower, and formed merely of\r\ncellular tissue, could be further reduced or absorbed for the sake of\r\neconomising nutriment.\r\n\r\nFinally, as rudimentary organs, by whatever steps they may have been\r\ndegraded into their present useless condition, are the record of a\r\nformer state of things, and have been retained solely through the power\r\nof inheritance—we can understand, on the genealogical view of\r\nclassification, how it is that systematists, in placing organisms in\r\ntheir proper places in the natural system, have often found rudimentary\r\nparts as useful as, or even sometimes more useful than, parts of high\r\nphysiological importance. Rudimentary organs may be compared with the\r\nletters in a word, still retained in the spelling, but become useless\r\nin the pronunciation, but which serve as a clue for its derivation. On\r\nthe view of descent with modification, we may conclude that the\r\nexistence of organs in a rudimentary, imperfect, and useless condition,\r\nor quite aborted, far from presenting a strange difficulty, as they\r\nassuredly do on the old doctrine of creation, might even have been\r\nanticipated in accordance with the views here explained.\r\n\r\n_Summary._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter I have attempted to show that the arrangement of all\r\norganic beings throughout all time in groups under groups—that the\r\nnature of the relationships by which all living and extinct organisms\r\nare united by complex, radiating, and circuitous lines of affinities\r\ninto a few grand classes—the rules followed and the difficulties\r\nencountered by naturalists in their classifications—the value set upon\r\ncharacters, if constant and prevalent, whether of high or of the most\r\ntrifling importance, or, as with rudimentary organs of no\r\nimportance—the wide opposition in value between analogical or adaptive\r\ncharacters, and characters of true affinity; and other such rules—all\r\nnaturally follow if we admit the common parentage of allied forms,\r\ntogether with their modification through variation and natural\r\nselection, with the contingencies of extinction and divergence of\r\ncharacter. In considering this view of classification, it should be\r\nborne in mind that the element of descent has been universally used in\r\nranking together the sexes, ages, dimorphic forms, and acknowledged\r\nvarieties of the same species, however much they may differ from each\r\nother in structure. If we extend the use of this element of descent—the\r\none certainly known cause of similarity in organic beings—we shall\r\nunderstand what is meant by the Natural System: it is genealogical in\r\nits attempted arrangement, with the grades of acquired difference\r\nmarked by the terms, varieties, species, genera, families, orders, and\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nOn this same view of descent with modification, most of the great facts\r\nin Morphology become intelligible—whether we look to the same pattern\r\ndisplayed by the different species of the same class in their\r\nhomologous organs, to whatever purpose applied, or to the serial and\r\nlateral homologies in each individual animal and plant.\r\n\r\nOn the principle of successive slight variations, not necessarily or\r\ngenerally supervening at a very early period of life, and being\r\ninherited at a corresponding period, we can understand the leading\r\nfacts in embryology; namely, the close resemblance in the individual\r\nembryo of the parts which are homologous, and which when matured become\r\nwidely different in structure and function; and the resemblance of the\r\nhomologous parts or organs in allied though distinct species, though\r\nfitted in the adult state for habits as different as is possible. Larvæ\r\nare active embryos, which have become specially modified in a greater\r\nor less degree in relation to their habits of life, with their\r\nmodifications inherited at a corresponding early age. On these same\r\nprinciples, and bearing in mind that when organs are reduced in size,\r\neither from disuse or through natural selection, it will generally be\r\nat that period of life when the being has to provide for its own wants,\r\nand bearing in mind how strong is the force of inheritance—the\r\noccurrence of rudimentary organs might even have been anticipated. The\r\nimportance of embryological characters and of rudimentary organs in\r\nclassification is intelligible, on the view that a natural arrangement\r\nmust be genealogical.\r\n\r\nFinally, the several classes of facts which have been considered in\r\nthis chapter, seem to me to proclaim so plainly, that the innumerable\r\nspecies, genera and families, with which this world is peopled, are all\r\ndescended, each within its own class or group, from common parents, and\r\nhave all been modified in the course of descent, that I should without\r\nhesitation adopt this view, even if it were unsupported by other facts\r\nor arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nRECAPITULATION AND CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecapitulation of the objections to the theory of Natural\r\nSelection—Recapitulation of the general and special circumstances in\r\nits favour—Causes of the general belief in the immutability of\r\nspecies—How far the theory of Natural Selection may be extended—Effects\r\nof its adoption on the study of Natural History—Concluding remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs this whole volume is one long argument, it may be convenient to the\r\nreader to have the leading facts and inferences briefly recapitulated.\r\n\r\nThat many and serious objections may be advanced against the theory of\r\ndescent with modification through variation and natural selection, I do\r\nnot deny. I have endeavoured to give to them their full force. Nothing\r\nat first can appear more difficult to believe than that the more\r\ncomplex organs and instincts have been perfected, not by means superior\r\nto, though analogous with, human reason, but by the accumulation of\r\ninnumerable slight variations, each good for the individual possessor.\r\nNevertheless, this difficulty, though appearing to our imagination\r\ninsuperably great, cannot be considered real if we admit the following\r\npropositions, namely, that all parts of the organisation and instincts\r\noffer, at least individual differences—that there is a struggle for\r\nexistence leading to the preservation of profitable deviations of\r\nstructure or instinct—and, lastly, that gradations in the state of\r\nperfection of each organ may have existed, each good of its kind. The\r\ntruth of these propositions cannot, I think, be disputed.\r\n\r\nIt is, no doubt, extremely difficult even to conjecture by what\r\ngradations many structures have been perfected, more especially among\r\nbroken and failing groups of organic beings, which have suffered much\r\nextinction; but we see so many strange gradations in nature, that we\r\nought to be extremely cautious in saying that any organ or instinct, or\r\nany whole structure, could not have arrived at its present state by\r\nmany graduated steps. There are, it must be admitted, cases of special\r\ndifficulty opposed to the theory of natural selection; and one of the\r\nmost curious of these is the existence in the same community of two or\r\nthree defined castes of workers or sterile female ants; but I have\r\nattempted to show how these difficulties can be mastered.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the almost universal sterility of species when first\r\ncrossed, which forms so remarkable a contrast with the almost universal\r\nfertility of varieties when crossed, I must refer the reader to the\r\nrecapitulation of the facts given at the end of the ninth chapter,\r\nwhich seem to me conclusively to show that this sterility is no more a\r\nspecial endowment than is the incapacity of two distinct kinds of trees\r\nto be grafted together; but that it is incidental on differences\r\nconfined to the reproductive systems of the intercrossed species. We\r\nsee the truth of this conclusion in the vast difference in the results\r\nof crossing the same two species reciprocally—that is, when one species\r\nis first used as the father and then as the mother. Analogy from the\r\nconsideration of dimorphic and trimorphic plants clearly leads to the\r\nsame conclusion, for when the forms are illegitimately united, they\r\nyield few or no seed, and their offspring are more or less sterile; and\r\nthese forms belong to the same undoubted species, and differ from each\r\nother in no respect except in their reproductive organs and functions.\r\n\r\nAlthough the fertility of varieties when intercrossed, and of their\r\nmongrel offspring, has been asserted by so many authors to be\r\nuniversal, this cannot be considered as quite correct after the facts\r\ngiven on the high authority of Gärtner and Kölreuter. Most of the\r\nvarieties which have been experimented on have been produced under\r\ndomestication; and as domestication (I do not mean mere confinement)\r\nalmost certainly tends to eliminate that sterility which, judging from\r\nanalogy, would have affected the parent-species if intercrossed, we\r\nought not to expect that domestication would likewise induce sterility\r\nin their modified descendants when crossed. This elimination of\r\nsterility apparently follows from the same cause which allows our\r\ndomestic animals to breed freely under diversified circumstances; and\r\nthis again apparently follows from their having been gradually\r\naccustomed to frequent changes in their conditions of life.\r\n\r\nA double and parallel series of facts seems to throw much light on the\r\nsterility of species, when first crossed, and of their hybrid\r\noffspring. On the one side, there is good reason to believe that slight\r\nchanges in the conditions of life give vigour and fertility to all\r\norganic beings. We know also that a cross between the distinct\r\nindividuals of the same variety, and between distinct varieties,\r\nincreases the number of their offspring, and certainly gives to them\r\nincreased size and vigour. This is chiefly owing to the forms which are\r\ncrossed having been exposed to somewhat different conditions of life;\r\nfor I have ascertained by a labourious series of experiments that if\r\nall the individuals of the same variety be subjected during several\r\ngenerations to the same conditions, the good derived from crossing is\r\noften much diminished or wholly disappears. This is one side of the\r\ncase. On the other side, we know that species which have long been\r\nexposed to nearly uniform conditions, when they are subjected under\r\nconfinement to new and greatly changed conditions, either perish, or if\r\nthey survive, are rendered sterile, though retaining perfect health.\r\nThis does not occur, or only in a very slight degree, with our\r\ndomesticated productions, which have long been exposed to fluctuating\r\nconditions. Hence when we find that hybrids produced by a cross between\r\ntwo distinct species are few in number, owing to their perishing soon\r\nafter conception or at a very early age, or if surviving that they are\r\nrendered more or less sterile, it seems highly probable that this\r\nresult is due to their having been in fact subjected to a great change\r\nin their conditions of life, from being compounded of two distinct\r\norganisations. He who will explain in a definite manner why, for\r\ninstance, an elephant or a fox will not breed under confinement in its\r\nnative country, whilst the domestic pig or dog will breed freely under\r\nthe most diversified conditions, will at the same time be able to give\r\na definite answer to the question why two distinct species, when\r\ncrossed, as well as their hybrid offspring, are generally rendered more\r\nor less sterile, while two domesticated varieties when crossed and\r\ntheir mongrel offspring are perfectly fertile.\r\n\r\nTurning to geographical distribution, the difficulties encountered on\r\nthe theory of descent with modification are serious enough. All the\r\nindividuals of the same species, and all the species of the same genus,\r\nor even higher group, are descended from common parents; and therefore,\r\nin however distant and isolated parts of the world they may now be\r\nfound, they must in the course of successive generations have travelled\r\nfrom some one point to all the others. We are often wholly unable even\r\nto conjecture how this could have been effected. Yet, as we have reason\r\nto believe that some species have retained the same specific form for\r\nvery long periods of time, immensely long as measured by years, too\r\nmuch stress ought not to be laid on the occasional wide diffusion of\r\nthe same species; for during very long periods there will always have\r\nbeen a good chance for wide migration by many means. A broken or\r\ninterrupted range may often be accounted for by the extinction of the\r\nspecies in the intermediate regions. It cannot be denied that we are as\r\nyet very ignorant as to the full extent of the various climatical and\r\ngeographical changes which have affected the earth during modern\r\nperiods; and such changes will often have facilitated migration. As an\r\nexample, I have attempted to show how potent has been the influence of\r\nthe Glacial period on the distribution of the same and of allied\r\nspecies throughout the world. We are as yet profoundly ignorant of the\r\nmany occasional means of transport. With respect to distinct species of\r\nthe same genus, inhabiting distant and isolated regions, as the process\r\nof modification has necessarily been slow, all the means of migration\r\nwill have been possible during a very long period; and consequently the\r\ndifficulty of the wide diffusion of the species of the same genus is in\r\nsome degree lessened.\r\n\r\nAs according to the theory of natural selection an interminable number\r\nof intermediate forms must have existed, linking together all the\r\nspecies in each group by gradations as fine as our existing varieties,\r\nit may be asked, Why do we not see these linking forms all around us?\r\nWhy are not all organic beings blended together in an inextricable\r\nchaos? With respect to existing forms, we should remember that we have\r\nno right to expect (excepting in rare cases) to discover _directly_\r\nconnecting links between them, but only between each and some extinct\r\nand supplanted form. Even on a wide area, which has during a long\r\nperiod remained continuous, and of which the climatic and other\r\nconditions of life change insensibly in proceeding from a district\r\noccupied by one species into another district occupied by a closely\r\nallied species, we have no just right to expect often to find\r\nintermediate varieties in the intermediate zones. For we have reason to\r\nbelieve that only a few species of a genus ever undergo change; the\r\nother species becoming utterly extinct and leaving no modified progeny.\r\nOf the species which do change, only a few within the same country\r\nchange at the same time; and all modifications are slowly effected. I\r\nhave also shown that the intermediate varieties which probably at first\r\nexisted in the intermediate zones, would be liable to be supplanted by\r\nthe allied forms on either hand; for the latter, from existing in\r\ngreater numbers, would generally be modified and improved at a quicker\r\nrate than the intermediate varieties, which existed in lesser numbers;\r\nso that the intermediate varieties would, in the long run, be\r\nsupplanted and exterminated.\r\n\r\nOn this doctrine of the extermination of an infinitude of connecting\r\nlinks, between the living and extinct inhabitants of the world, and at\r\neach successive period between the extinct and still older species, why\r\nis not every geological formation charged with such links? Why does not\r\nevery collection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of the\r\ngradation and mutation of the forms of life? Although geological\r\nresearch has undoubtedly revealed the former existence of many links,\r\nbringing numerous forms of life much closer together, it does not yield\r\nthe infinitely many fine gradations between past and present species\r\nrequired on the theory, and this is the most obvious of the many\r\nobjections which may be urged against it. Why, again, do whole groups\r\nof allied species appear, though this appearance is often false, to\r\nhave come in suddenly on the successive geological stages? Although we\r\nnow know that organic beings appeared on this globe, at a period\r\nincalculably remote, long before the lowest bed of the Cambrian system\r\nwas deposited, why do we not find beneath this system great piles of\r\nstrata stored with the remains of the progenitors of the Cambrian\r\nfossils? For on the theory, such strata must somewhere have been\r\ndeposited at these ancient and utterly unknown epochs of the world’s\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nI can answer these questions and objections only on the supposition\r\nthat the geological record is far more imperfect than most geologists\r\nbelieve. The number of specimens in all our museums is absolutely as\r\nnothing compared with the countless generations of countless species\r\nwhich have certainly existed. The parent form of any two or more\r\nspecies would not be in all its characters directly intermediate\r\nbetween its modified offspring, any more than the rock-pigeon is\r\ndirectly intermediate in crop and tail between its descendants, the\r\npouter and fantail pigeons. We should not be able to recognise a\r\nspecies as the parent of another and modified species, if we were to\r\nexamine the two ever so closely, unless we possessed most of the\r\nintermediate links; and owing to the imperfection of the geological\r\nrecord, we have no just right to expect to find so many links. If two\r\nor three, or even more linking forms were discovered, they would simply\r\nbe ranked by many naturalists as so many new species, more especially\r\nif found in different geological substages, let their differences be\r\never so slight. Numerous existing doubtful forms could be named which\r\nare probably varieties; but who will pretend that in future ages so\r\nmany fossil links will be discovered, that naturalists will be able to\r\ndecide whether or not these doubtful forms ought to be called\r\nvarieties? Only a small portion of the world has been geologically\r\nexplored. Only organic beings of certain classes can be preserved in a\r\nfossil condition, at least in any great number. Many species when once\r\nformed never undergo any further change but become extinct without\r\nleaving modified descendants; and the periods during which species have\r\nundergone modification, though long as measured by years, have probably\r\nbeen short in comparison with the periods during which they retained\r\nthe same form. It is the dominant and widely ranging species which vary\r\nmost frequently and vary most, and varieties are often at first\r\nlocal—both causes rendering the discovery of intermediate links in any\r\none formation less likely. Local varieties will not spread into other\r\nand distant regions until they are considerably modified and improved;\r\nand when they have spread, and are discovered in a geological\r\nformation, they appear as if suddenly created there, and will be simply\r\nclassed as new species. Most formations have been intermittent in their\r\naccumulation; and their duration has probably been shorter than the\r\naverage duration of specific forms. Successive formations are in most\r\ncases separated from each other by blank intervals of time of great\r\nlength, for fossiliferous formations thick enough to resist future\r\ndegradation can, as a general rule, be accumulated only where much\r\nsediment is deposited on the subsiding bed of the sea. During the\r\nalternate periods of elevation and of stationary level the record will\r\ngenerally be blank. During these latter periods there will probably be\r\nmore variability in the forms of life; during periods of subsidence,\r\nmore extinction.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the absence of strata rich in fossils beneath the\r\nCambrian formation, I can recur only to the hypothesis given in the\r\ntenth chapter; namely, that though our continents and oceans have\r\nendured for an enormous period in nearly their present relative\r\npositions, we have no reason to assume that this has always been the\r\ncase; consequently formations much older than any now known may lie\r\nburied beneath the great oceans. With respect to the lapse of time not\r\nhaving been sufficient since our planet was consolidated for the\r\nassumed amount of organic change, and this objection, as urged by Sir\r\nWilliam Thompson, is probably one of the gravest as yet advanced, I can\r\nonly say, firstly, that we do not know at what rate species change, as\r\nmeasured by years, and secondly, that many philosophers are not as yet\r\nwilling to admit that we know enough of the constitution of the\r\nuniverse and of the interior of our globe to speculate with safety on\r\nits past duration.\r\n\r\nThat the geological record is imperfect all will admit; but that it is\r\nimperfect to the degree required by our theory, few will be inclined to\r\nadmit. If we look to long enough intervals of time, geology plainly\r\ndeclares that species have all changed; and they have changed in the\r\nmanner required by the theory, for they have changed slowly and in a\r\ngraduated manner. We clearly see this in the fossil remains from\r\nconsecutive formations invariably being much more closely related to\r\neach other than are the fossils from widely separated formations.\r\n\r\nSuch is the sum of the several chief objections and difficulties which\r\nmay justly be urged against the theory; and I have now briefly\r\nrecapitulated the answers and explanations which, as far as I can see,\r\nmay be given. I have felt these difficulties far too heavily during\r\nmany years to doubt their weight. But it deserves especial notice that\r\nthe more important objections relate to questions on which we are\r\nconfessedly ignorant; nor do we know how ignorant we are. We do not\r\nknow all the possible transitional gradations between the simplest and\r\nthe most perfect organs; it cannot be pretended that we know all the\r\nvaried means of Distribution during the long lapse of years, or that we\r\nknow how imperfect is the Geological Record. Serious as these several\r\nobjections are, in my judgment they are by no means sufficient to\r\noverthrow the theory of descent with subsequent modification.\r\n\r\nNow let us turn to the other side of the argument. Under domestication\r\nwe see much variability, caused, or at least excited, by changed\r\nconditions of life; but often in so obscure a manner, that we are\r\ntempted to consider the variations as spontaneous. Variability is\r\ngoverned by many complex laws, by correlated growth, compensation, the\r\nincreased use and disuse of parts, and the definite action of the\r\nsurrounding conditions. There is much difficulty in ascertaining how\r\nlargely our domestic productions have been modified; but we may safely\r\ninfer that the amount has been large, and that modifications can be\r\ninherited for long periods. As long as the conditions of life remain\r\nthe same, we have reason to believe that a modification, which has\r\nalready been inherited for many generations, may continue to be\r\ninherited for an almost infinite number of generations. On the other\r\nhand we have evidence that variability, when it has once come into\r\nplay, does not cease under domestication for a very long period; nor do\r\nwe know that it ever ceases, for new varieties are still occasionally\r\nproduced by our oldest domesticated productions.\r\n\r\nVariability is not actually caused by man; he only unintentionally\r\nexposes organic beings to new conditions of life and then nature acts\r\non the organisation and causes it to vary. But man can and does select\r\nthe variations given to him by nature, and thus accumulates them in any\r\ndesired manner. He thus adapts animals and plants for his own benefit\r\nor pleasure. He may do this methodically, or he may do it unconsciously\r\nby preserving the individuals most useful or pleasing to him without\r\nany intention of altering the breed. It is certain that he can largely\r\ninfluence the character of a breed by selecting, in each successive\r\ngeneration, individual differences so slight as to be inappreciable\r\nexcept by an educated eye. This unconscious process of selection has\r\nbeen the great agency in the formation of the most distinct and useful\r\ndomestic breeds. That many breeds produced by man have to a large\r\nextent the character of natural species, is shown by the inextricable\r\ndoubts whether many of them are varieties or aboriginally distinct\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why the principles which have acted so efficiently\r\nunder domestication should not have acted under nature. In the survival\r\nof favoured individuals and races, during the constantly recurrent\r\nStruggle for Existence, we see a powerful and ever-acting form of\r\nSelection. The struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high\r\ngeometrical ratio of increase which is common to all organic beings.\r\nThis high rate of increase is proved by calculation—by the rapid\r\nincrease of many animals and plants during a succession of peculiar\r\nseasons, and when naturalised in new countries. More individuals are\r\nborn than can possibly survive. A grain in the balance may determine\r\nwhich individuals shall live and which shall die—which variety or\r\nspecies shall increase in number, and which shall decrease, or finally\r\nbecome extinct. As the individuals of the same species come in all\r\nrespects into the closest competition with each other, the struggle\r\nwill generally be most severe between them; it will be almost equally\r\nsevere between the varieties of the same species, and next in severity\r\nbetween the species of the same genus. On the other hand the struggle\r\nwill often be severe between beings remote in the scale of nature. The\r\nslightest advantage in certain individuals, at any age or during any\r\nseason, over those with which they come into competition, or better\r\nadaptation in however slight a degree to the surrounding physical\r\nconditions, will, in the long run, turn the balance.\r\n\r\nWith animals having separated sexes, there will be in most cases a\r\nstruggle between the males for the possession of the females. The most\r\nvigorous males, or those which have most successfully struggled with\r\ntheir conditions of life, will generally leave most progeny. But\r\nsuccess will often depend on the males having special weapons or means\r\nof defence or charms; and a slight advantage will lead to victory.\r\n\r\nAs geology plainly proclaims that each land has undergone great\r\nphysical changes, we might have expected to find that organic beings\r\nhave varied under nature, in the same way as they have varied under\r\ndomestication. And if there has been any variability under nature, it\r\nwould be an unaccountable fact if natural selection had not come into\r\nplay. It has often been asserted, but the assertion is incapable of\r\nproof, that the amount of variation under nature is a strictly limited\r\nquantity. Man, though acting on external characters alone and often\r\ncapriciously, can produce within a short period a great result by\r\nadding up mere individual differences in his domestic productions; and\r\nevery one admits that species present individual differences. But,\r\nbesides such differences, all naturalists admit that natural varieties\r\nexist, which are considered sufficiently distinct to be worthy of\r\nrecord in systematic works. No one has drawn any clear distinction\r\nbetween individual differences and slight varieties; or between more\r\nplainly marked varieties and subspecies and species. On separate\r\ncontinents, and on different parts of the same continent, when divided\r\nby barriers of any kind, and on outlying islands, what a multitude of\r\nforms exist, which some experienced naturalists rank as varieties,\r\nothers as geographical races or sub species, and others as distinct,\r\nthough closely allied species!\r\n\r\nIf, then, animals and plants do vary, let it be ever so slightly or\r\nslowly, why should not variations or individual differences, which are\r\nin any way beneficial, be preserved and accumulated through natural\r\nselection, or the survival of the fittest? If man can by patience\r\nselect variations useful to him, why, under changing and complex\r\nconditions of life, should not variations useful to nature’s living\r\nproducts often arise, and be preserved or selected? What limit can be\r\nput to this power, acting during long ages and rigidly scrutinising the\r\nwhole constitution, structure, and habits of each creature, favouring\r\nthe good and rejecting the bad? I can see no limit to this power, in\r\nslowly and beautifully adapting each form to the most complex relations\r\nof life. The theory of natural selection, even if we look no further\r\nthan this, seems to be in the highest degree probable. I have already\r\nrecapitulated, as fairly as I could, the opposed difficulties and\r\nobjections: now let us turn to the special facts and arguments in\r\nfavour of the theory.\r\n\r\nOn the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent\r\nvarieties, and that each species first existed as a variety, we can see\r\nwhy it is that no line of demarcation can be drawn between species,\r\ncommonly supposed to have been produced by special acts of creation,\r\nand varieties which are acknowledged to have been produced by secondary\r\nlaws. On this same view we can understand how it is that in a region\r\nwhere many species of a genus have been produced, and where they now\r\nflourish, these same species should present many varieties; for where\r\nthe manufactory of species has been active, we might expect, as a\r\ngeneral rule, to find it still in action; and this is the case if\r\nvarieties be incipient species. Moreover, the species of the larger\r\ngenera, which afford the greater number of varieties or incipient\r\nspecies, retain to a certain degree the character of varieties; for\r\nthey differ from each other by a less amount of difference than do the\r\nspecies of smaller genera. The closely allied species also of a larger\r\ngenera apparently have restricted ranges, and in their affinities they\r\nare clustered in little groups round other species—in both respects\r\nresembling varieties. These are strange relations on the view that each\r\nspecies was independently created, but are intelligible if each existed\r\nfirst as a variety.\r\n\r\nAs each species tends by its geometrical rate of reproduction to\r\nincrease inordinately in number; and as the modified descendants of\r\neach species will be enabled to increase by as much as they become more\r\ndiversified in habits and structure, so as to be able to seize on many\r\nand widely different places in the economy of nature, there will be a\r\nconstant tendency in natural selection to preserve the most divergent\r\noffspring of any one species. Hence during a long-continued course of\r\nmodification, the slight differences characteristic of varieties of the\r\nsame species, tend to be augmented into the greater differences\r\ncharacteristic of the species of the same genus. New and improved\r\nvarieties will inevitably supplant and exterminate the older, less\r\nimproved and intermediate varieties; and thus species are rendered to a\r\nlarge extent defined and distinct objects. Dominant species belonging\r\nto the larger groups within each class tend to give birth to new and\r\ndominant forms; so that each large group tends to become still larger,\r\nand at the same time more divergent in character. But as all groups\r\ncannot thus go on increasing in size, for the world would not hold\r\nthem, the more dominant groups beat the less dominant. This tendency in\r\nthe large groups to go on increasing in size and diverging in\r\ncharacter, together with the inevitable contingency of much extinction,\r\nexplains the arrangement of all the forms of life in groups subordinate\r\nto groups, all within a few great classes, which has prevailed\r\nthroughout all time. This grand fact of the grouping of all organic\r\nbeings under what is called the Natural System, is utterly inexplicable\r\non the theory of creation.\r\n\r\nAs natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight, successive,\r\nfavourable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modifications;\r\nit can act only by short and slow steps. Hence, the canon of “Natura\r\nnon facit saltum,” which every fresh addition to our knowledge tends to\r\nconfirm, is on this theory intelligible. We can see why throughout\r\nnature the same general end is gained by an almost infinite diversity\r\nof means, for every peculiarity when once acquired is long inherited,\r\nand structures already modified in many different ways have to be\r\nadapted for the same general purpose. We can, in short, see why nature\r\nis prodigal in variety, though niggard in innovation. But why this\r\nshould be a law of nature if each species has been independently\r\ncreated no man can explain.\r\n\r\nMany other facts are, as it seems to me, explicable on this theory. How\r\nstrange it is that a bird, under the form of a woodpecker, should prey\r\non insects on the ground; that upland geese, which rarely or never\r\nswim, would possess webbed feet; that a thrush-like bird should dive\r\nand feed on sub-aquatic insects; and that a petrel should have the\r\nhabits and structure fitting it for the life of an auk! and so in\r\nendless other cases. But on the view of each species constantly trying\r\nto increase in number, with natural selection always ready to adapt the\r\nslowly varying descendants of each to any unoccupied or ill-occupied\r\nplace in nature, these facts cease to be strange, or might even have\r\nbeen anticipated.\r\n\r\nWe can to a certain extent understand how it is that there is so much\r\nbeauty throughout nature; for this may be largely attributed to the\r\nagency of selection. That beauty, according to our sense of it, is not\r\nuniversal, must be admitted by every one who will look at some venomous\r\nsnakes, at some fishes, and at certain hideous bats with a distorted\r\nresemblance to the human face. Sexual selection has given the most\r\nbrilliant colours, elegant patterns, and other ornaments to the males,\r\nand sometimes to both sexes of many birds, butterflies and other\r\nanimals. With birds it has often rendered the voice of the male musical\r\nto the female, as well as to our ears. Flowers and fruit have been\r\nrendered conspicuous by brilliant colours in contrast with the green\r\nfoliage, in order that the flowers may be easily seen, visited and\r\nfertilised by insects, and the seeds disseminated by birds. How it\r\ncomes that certain colours, sounds and forms should give pleasure to\r\nman and the lower animals, that is, how the sense of beauty in its\r\nsimplest form was first acquired, we do not know any more than how\r\ncertain odours and flavours were first rendered agreeable.\r\n\r\nAs natural selection acts by competition, it adapts and improves the\r\ninhabitants of each country only in relation to their co-inhabitants;\r\nso that we need feel no surprise at the species of any one country,\r\nalthough on the ordinary view supposed to have been created and\r\nspecially adapted for that country, being beaten and supplanted by the\r\nnaturalised productions from another land. Nor ought we to marvel if\r\nall the contrivances in nature be not, as far as we can judge,\r\nabsolutely perfect; as in the case even of the human eye; or if some of\r\nthem be abhorrent to our ideas of fitness. We need not marvel at the\r\nsting of the bee, when used against the enemy, causing the bee’s own\r\ndeath; at drones being produced in such great numbers for one single\r\nact, and being then slaughtered by their sterile sisters; at the\r\nastonishing waste of pollen by our fir-trees; at the instinctive hatred\r\nof the queen-bee for her own fertile daughters; at ichneumonidæ feeding\r\nwithin the living bodies of caterpillars; and at other such cases. The\r\nwonder, indeed, is, on the theory of natural selection, that more cases\r\nof the want of absolute perfection have not been detected.\r\n\r\nThe complex and little known laws governing the production of varieties\r\nare the same, as far as we can judge, with the laws which have governed\r\nthe production of distinct species. In both cases physical conditions\r\nseem to have produced some direct and definite effect, but how much we\r\ncannot say. Thus, when varieties enter any new station, they\r\noccasionally assume some of the characters proper to the species of\r\nthat station. With both varieties and species, use and disuse seem to\r\nhave produced a considerable effect; for it is impossible to resist\r\nthis conclusion when we look, for instance, at the logger-headed duck,\r\nwhich has wings incapable of flight, in nearly the same condition as in\r\nthe domestic duck; or when we look at the burrowing tucu-tucu, which is\r\noccasionally blind, and then at certain moles, which are habitually\r\nblind and have their eyes covered with skin; or when we look at the\r\nblind animals inhabiting the dark caves of America and Europe. With\r\nvarieties and species, correlated variation seems to have played an\r\nimportant part, so that when one part has been modified other parts\r\nhave been necessarily modified. With both varieties and species,\r\nreversions to long-lost characters occasionally occur. How inexplicable\r\non the theory of creation is the occasional appearance of stripes on\r\nthe shoulders and legs of the several species of the horse-genus and of\r\ntheir hybrids! How simply is this fact explained if we believe that\r\nthese species are all descended from a striped progenitor, in the same\r\nmanner as the several domestic breeds of the pigeon are descended from\r\nthe blue and barred rock-pigeon!\r\n\r\nOn the ordinary view of each species having been independently created,\r\nwhy should specific characters, or those by which the species of the\r\nsame genus differ from each other, be more variable than the generic\r\ncharacters in which they all agree? Why, for instance, should the\r\ncolour of a flower be more likely to vary in any one species of a\r\ngenus, if the other species possess differently coloured flowers, than\r\nif all possessed the same coloured flowers? If species are only\r\nwell-marked varieties, of which the characters have become in a high\r\ndegree permanent, we can understand this fact; for they have already\r\nvaried since they branched off from a common progenitor in certain\r\ncharacters, by which they have come to be specifically distinct from\r\neach other; therefore these same characters would be more likely again\r\nto vary than the generic characters which have been inherited without\r\nchange for an immense period. It is inexplicable on the theory of\r\ncreation why a part developed in a very unusual manner in one species\r\nalone of a genus, and therefore, as we may naturally infer, of great\r\nimportance to that species, should be eminently liable to variation;\r\nbut, on our view, this part has undergone, since the several species\r\nbranched off from a common progenitor, an unusual amount of variability\r\nand modification, and therefore we might expect the part generally to\r\nbe still variable. But a part may be developed in the most unusual\r\nmanner, like the wing of a bat, and yet not be more variable than any\r\nother structure, if the part be common to many subordinate forms, that\r\nis, if it has been inherited for a very long period; for in this case\r\nit will have been rendered constant by long-continued natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nGlancing at instincts, marvellous as some are, they offer no greater\r\ndifficulty than do corporeal structures on the theory of the natural\r\nselection of successive, slight, but profitable modifications. We can\r\nthus understand why nature moves by graduated steps in endowing\r\ndifferent animals of the same class with their several instincts. I\r\nhave attempted to show how much light the principle of gradation throws\r\non the admirable architectural powers of the hive-bee. Habit no doubt\r\noften comes into play in modifying instincts; but it certainly is not\r\nindispensable, as we see in the case of neuter insects, which leave no\r\nprogeny to inherit the effects of long-continued habit. On the view of\r\nall the species of the same genus having descended from a common\r\nparent, and having inherited much in common, we can understand how it\r\nis that allied species, when placed under widely different conditions\r\nof life, yet follow nearly the same instincts; why the thrushes of\r\ntropical and temperate South America, for instance, line their nests\r\nwith mud like our British species. On the view of instincts having been\r\nslowly acquired through natural selection, we need not marvel at some\r\ninstincts being not perfect and liable to mistakes, and at many\r\ninstincts causing other animals to suffer.\r\n\r\nIf species be only well-marked and permanent varieties, we can at once\r\nsee why their crossed offspring should follow the same complex laws in\r\ntheir degrees and kinds of resemblance to their parents—in being\r\nabsorbed into each other by successive crosses, and in other such\r\npoints—as do the crossed offspring of acknowledged varieties. This\r\nsimilarity would be a strange fact, if species had been independently\r\ncreated and varieties had been produced through secondary laws.\r\n\r\nIf we admit that the geological record is imperfect to an extreme\r\ndegree, then the facts, which the record does give, strongly support\r\nthe theory of descent with modification. New species have come on the\r\nstage slowly and at successive intervals; and the amount of change\r\nafter equal intervals of time, is widely different in different groups.\r\nThe extinction of species and of whole groups of species, which has\r\nplayed so conspicuous a part in the history of the organic world,\r\nalmost inevitably follows from the principle of natural selection; for\r\nold forms are supplanted by new and improved forms. Neither single\r\nspecies nor groups of species reappear when the chain of ordinary\r\ngeneration is once broken. The gradual diffusion of dominant forms,\r\nwith the slow modification of their descendants, causes the forms of\r\nlife, after long intervals of time, to appear as if they had changed\r\nsimultaneously throughout the world. The fact of the fossil remains of\r\neach formation being in some degree intermediate in character between\r\nthe fossils in the formations above and below, is simply explained by\r\ntheir intermediate position in the chain of descent. The grand fact\r\nthat all extinct beings can be classed with all recent beings,\r\nnaturally follows from the living and the extinct being the offspring\r\nof common parents. As species have generally diverged in character\r\nduring their long course of descent and modification, we can understand\r\nwhy it is that the more ancient forms, or early progenitors of each\r\ngroup, so often occupy a position in some degree intermediate between\r\nexisting groups. Recent forms are generally looked upon as being, on\r\nthe whole, higher in the scale of organisation than ancient forms; and\r\nthey must be higher, in so far as the later and more improved forms\r\nhave conquered the older and less improved forms in the struggle for\r\nlife; they have also generally had their organs more specialised for\r\ndifferent functions. This fact is perfectly compatible with numerous\r\nbeings still retaining simple and but little improved structures,\r\nfitted for simple conditions of life; it is likewise compatible with\r\nsome forms having retrograded in organisation, by having become at each\r\nstage of descent better fitted for new and degraded habits of life.\r\nLastly, the wonderful law of the long endurance of allied forms on the\r\nsame continent—of marsupials in Australia, of edentata in America, and\r\nother such cases—is intelligible, for within the same country the\r\nexisting and the extinct will be closely allied by descent.\r\n\r\nLooking to geographical distribution, if we admit that there has been\r\nduring the long course of ages much migration from one part of the\r\nworld to another, owing to former climatical and geographical changes\r\nand to the many occasional and unknown means of dispersal, then we can\r\nunderstand, on the theory of descent with modification, most of the\r\ngreat leading facts in Distribution. We can see why there should be so\r\nstriking a parallelism in the distribution of organic beings throughout\r\nspace, and in their geological succession throughout time; for in both\r\ncases the beings have been connected by the bond of ordinary\r\ngeneration, and the means of modification have been the same. We see\r\nthe full meaning of the wonderful fact, which has struck every\r\ntraveller, namely, that on the same continent, under the most diverse\r\nconditions, under heat and cold, on mountain and lowland, on deserts\r\nand marshes, most of the inhabitants within each great class are\r\nplainly related; for they are the descendants of the same progenitors\r\nand early colonists. On this same principle of former migration,\r\ncombined in most cases with modification, we can understand, by the aid\r\nof the Glacial period, the identity of some few plants, and the close\r\nalliance of many others, on the most distant mountains, and in the\r\nnorthern and southern temperate zones; and likewise the close alliance\r\nof some of the inhabitants of the sea in the northern and southern\r\ntemperate latitudes, though separated by the whole intertropical ocean.\r\nAlthough two countries may present physical conditions as closely\r\nsimilar as the same species ever require, we need feel no surprise at\r\ntheir inhabitants being widely different, if they have been for a long\r\nperiod completely sundered from each other; for as the relation of\r\norganism to organism is the most important of all relations, and as the\r\ntwo countries will have received colonists at various periods and in\r\ndifferent proportions, from some other country or from each other, the\r\ncourse of modification in the two areas will inevitably have been\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nOn this view of migration, with subsequent modification, we see why\r\noceanic islands are inhabited by only few species, but of these, why\r\nmany are peculiar or endemic forms. We clearly see why species\r\nbelonging to those groups of animals which cannot cross wide spaces of\r\nthe ocean, as frogs and terrestrial mammals, do not inhabit oceanic\r\nislands; and why, on the other hand, new and peculiar species of bats,\r\nanimals which can traverse the ocean, are often found on islands far\r\ndistant from any continent. Such cases as the presence of peculiar\r\nspecies of bats on oceanic islands and the absence of all other\r\nterrestrial mammals, are facts utterly inexplicable on the theory of\r\nindependent acts of creation.\r\n\r\nThe existence of closely allied representative species in any two\r\nareas, implies, on the theory of descent with modification, that the\r\nsame parent-forms formerly inhabited both areas; and we almost\r\ninvariably find that wherever many closely allied species inhabit two\r\nareas, some identical species are still common to both. Wherever many\r\nclosely allied yet distinct species occur, doubtful forms and varieties\r\nbelonging to the same groups likewise occur. It is a rule of high\r\ngenerality that the inhabitants of each area are related to the\r\ninhabitants of the nearest source whence immigrants might have been\r\nderived. We see this in the striking relation of nearly all the plants\r\nand animals of the Galapagos Archipelago, of Juan Fernandez, and of the\r\nother American islands, to the plants and animals of the neighbouring\r\nAmerican mainland; and of those of the Cape de Verde Archipelago, and\r\nof the other African islands to the African mainland. It must be\r\nadmitted that these facts receive no explanation on the theory of\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nThe fact, as we have seen, that all past and present organic beings can\r\nbe arranged within a few great classes, in groups subordinate to\r\ngroups, and with the extinct groups often falling in between the recent\r\ngroups, is intelligible on the theory of natural selection with its\r\ncontingencies of extinction and divergence of character. On these same\r\nprinciples we see how it is that the mutual affinities of the forms\r\nwithin each class are so complex and circuitous. We see why certain\r\ncharacters are far more serviceable than others for classification; why\r\nadaptive characters, though of paramount importance to the beings, are\r\nof hardly any importance in classification; why characters derived from\r\nrudimentary parts, though of no service to the beings, are often of\r\nhigh classificatory value; and why embryological characters are often\r\nthe most valuable of all. The real affinities of all organic beings, in\r\ncontradistinction to their adaptive resemblances, are due to\r\ninheritance or community of descent. The Natural System is a\r\ngenealogical arrangement, with the acquired grades of difference,\r\nmarked by the terms, varieties, species, genera, families, &c.; and we\r\nhave to discover the lines of descent by the most permanent characters,\r\nwhatever they may be, and of however slight vital importance.\r\n\r\nThe similar framework of bones in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, fin\r\nof the porpoise, and leg of the horse—the same number of vertebræ\r\nforming the neck of the giraffe and of the elephant—and innumerable\r\nother such facts, at once explain themselves on the theory of descent\r\nwith slow and slight successive modifications. The similarity of\r\npattern in the wing and in the leg of a bat, though used for such\r\ndifferent purpose—in the jaws and legs of a crab—in the petals,\r\nstamens, and pistils of a flower, is likewise, to a large extent,\r\nintelligible on the view of the gradual modification of parts or\r\norgans, which were aboriginally alike in an early progenitor in each of\r\nthese classes. On the principle of successive variations not always\r\nsupervening at an early age, and being inherited at a corresponding not\r\nearly period of life, we clearly see why the embryos of mammals, birds,\r\nreptiles, and fishes should be so closely similar, and so unlike the\r\nadult forms. We may cease marvelling at the embryo of an air-breathing\r\nmammal or bird having branchial slits and arteries running in loops,\r\nlike those of a fish which has to breathe the air dissolved in water by\r\nthe aid of well-developed branchiæ.\r\n\r\nDisuse, aided sometimes by natural selection, will often have reduced\r\norgans when rendered useless under changed habits or conditions of\r\nlife; and we can understand on this view the meaning of rudimentary\r\norgans. But disuse and selection will generally act on each creature,\r\nwhen it has come to maturity and has to play its full part in the\r\nstruggle for existence, and will thus have little power on an organ\r\nduring early life; hence the organ will not be reduced or rendered\r\nrudimentary at this early age. The calf, for instance, has inherited\r\nteeth, which never cut through the gums of the upper jaw, from an early\r\nprogenitor having well-developed teeth; and we may believe, that the\r\nteeth in the mature animal were formerly reduced by disuse owing to the\r\ntongue and palate, or lips, having become excellently fitted through\r\nnatural selection to browse without their aid; whereas in the calf, the\r\nteeth have been left unaffected, and on the principle of inheritance at\r\ncorresponding ages have been inherited from a remote period to the\r\npresent day. On the view of each organism with all its separate parts\r\nhaving been specially created, how utterly inexplicable is it that\r\norgans bearing the plain stamp of inutility, such as the teeth in the\r\nembryonic calf or the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers\r\nof many beetles, should so frequently occur. Nature may be said to have\r\ntaken pains to reveal her scheme of modification, by means of\r\nrudimentary organs, of embryological and homologous structures, but we\r\nare too blind to understand her meaning.\r\n\r\nI have now recapitulated the facts and considerations which have\r\nthoroughly convinced me that species have been modified, during a long\r\ncourse of descent. This has been effected chiefly through the natural\r\nselection of numerous successive, slight, favourable variations; aided\r\nin an important manner by the inherited effects of the use and disuse\r\nof parts; and in an unimportant manner, that is, in relation to\r\nadaptive structures, whether past or present, by the direct action of\r\nexternal conditions, and by variations which seem to us in our\r\nignorance to arise spontaneously. It appears that I formerly underrated\r\nthe frequency and value of these latter forms of variation, as leading\r\nto permanent modifications of structure independently of natural\r\nselection. But as my conclusions have lately been much misrepresented,\r\nand it has been stated that I attribute the modification of species\r\nexclusively to natural selection, I may be permitted to remark that in\r\nthe first edition of this work, and subsequently, I placed in a most\r\nconspicuous position—namely, at the close of the Introduction—the\r\nfollowing words: “I am convinced that natural selection has been the\r\nmain but not the exclusive means of modification.” This has been of no\r\navail. Great is the power of steady misrepresentation; but the history\r\nof science shows that fortunately this power does not long endure.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly be supposed that a false theory would explain, in so\r\nsatisfactory a manner as does the theory of natural selection, the\r\nseveral large classes of facts above specified. It has recently been\r\nobjected that this is an unsafe method of arguing; but it is a method\r\nused in judging of the common events of life, and has often been used\r\nby the greatest natural philosophers. The undulatory theory of light\r\nhas thus been arrived at; and the belief in the revolution of the earth\r\non its own axis was until lately supported by hardly any direct\r\nevidence. It is no valid objection that science as yet throws no light\r\non the far higher problem of the essence or origin of life. Who can\r\nexplain what is the essence of the attraction of gravity? No one now\r\nobjects to following out the results consequent on this unknown element\r\nof attraction; notwithstanding that Leibnitz formerly accused Newton of\r\nintroducing “occult qualities and miracles into philosophy.”\r\n\r\nI see no good reasons why the views given in this volume should shock\r\nthe religious feelings of any one. It is satisfactory, as showing how\r\ntransient such impressions are, to remember that the greatest discovery\r\never made by man, namely, the law of the attraction of gravity, was\r\nalso attacked by Leibnitz, “as subversive of natural, and inferentially\r\nof revealed, religion.” A celebrated author and divine has written to\r\nme that “he has gradually learned to see that it is just as noble a\r\nconception of the Deity to believe that He created a few original forms\r\ncapable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe\r\nthat He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by\r\nthe action of His laws.”\r\n\r\nWhy, it may be asked, until recently did nearly all the most eminent\r\nliving naturalists and geologists disbelieve in the mutability of\r\nspecies? It cannot be asserted that organic beings in a state of nature\r\nare subject to no variation; it cannot be proved that the amount of\r\nvariation in the course of long ages is a limited quantity; no clear\r\ndistinction has been, or can be, drawn between species and well-marked\r\nvarieties. It cannot be maintained that species when intercrossed are\r\ninvariably sterile and varieties invariably fertile; or that sterility\r\nis a special endowment and sign of creation. The belief that species\r\nwere immutable productions was almost unavoidable as long as the\r\nhistory of the world was thought to be of short duration; and now that\r\nwe have acquired some idea of the lapse of time, we are too apt to\r\nassume, without proof, that the geological record is so perfect that it\r\nwould have afforded us plain evidence of the mutation of species, if\r\nthey had undergone mutation.\r\n\r\nBut the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one\r\nspecies has given birth to other and distinct species, is that we are\r\nalways slow in admitting any great changes of which we do not see the\r\nsteps. The difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists,\r\nwhen Lyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffs had been\r\nformed, and great valleys excavated, by the agencies which we still see\r\nat work. The mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of\r\neven a million years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of\r\nmany slight variations, accumulated during an almost infinite number of\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nAlthough I am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this\r\nvolume under the form of an abstract, I by no means expect to convince\r\nexperienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of\r\nfacts all viewed, during a long course of years, from a point of view\r\ndirectly opposite to mine. It is so easy to hide our ignorance under\r\nsuch expressions as the “plan of creation,” “unity of design,” &c., and\r\nto think that we give an explanation when we only restate a fact. Any\r\none whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained\r\ndifficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will\r\ncertainly reject the theory. A few naturalists, endowed with much\r\nflexibility of mind, and who have already begun to doubt the\r\nimmutability of species, may be influenced by this volume; but I look\r\nwith confidence to the future, to young and rising naturalists, who\r\nwill be able to view both sides of the question with impartiality.\r\nWhoever is led to believe that species are mutable will do good service\r\nby conscientiously expressing his conviction; for thus only can the\r\nload of prejudice by which this subject is overwhelmed be removed.\r\n\r\nSeveral eminent naturalists have of late published their belief that a\r\nmultitude of reputed species in each genus are not real species; but\r\nthat other species are real, that is, have been independently created.\r\nThis seems to me a strange conclusion to arrive at. They admit that a\r\nmultitude of forms, which till lately they themselves thought were\r\nspecial creations, and which are still thus looked at by the majority\r\nof naturalists, and which consequently have all the external\r\ncharacteristic features of true species—they admit that these have been\r\nproduced by variation, but they refuse to extend the same view to other\r\nand slightly different forms. Nevertheless, they do not pretend that\r\nthey can define, or even conjecture, which are the created forms of\r\nlife, and which are those produced by secondary laws. They admit\r\nvariation as a vera causa in one case, they arbitrarily reject it in\r\nanother, without assigning any distinction in the two cases. The day\r\nwill come when this will be given as a curious illustration of the\r\nblindness of preconceived opinion. These authors seem no more startled\r\nat a miraculous act of creation than at an ordinary birth. But do they\r\nreally believe that at innumerable periods in the earth’s history\r\ncertain elemental atoms have been commanded suddenly to flash into\r\nliving tissues? Do they believe that at each supposed act of creation\r\none individual or many were produced? Were all the infinitely numerous\r\nkinds of animals and plants created as eggs or seed, or as full grown?\r\nand in the case of mammals, were they created bearing the false marks\r\nof nourishment from the mother’s womb? Undoubtedly some of these same\r\nquestions cannot be answered by those who believe in the appearance or\r\ncreation of only a few forms of life or of some one form alone. It has\r\nbeen maintained by several authors that it is as easy to believe in the\r\ncreation of a million beings as of one; but Maupertuis’ philosophical\r\naxiom “of least action” leads the mind more willingly to admit the\r\nsmaller number; and certainly we ought not to believe that innumerable\r\nbeings within each great class have been created with plain, but\r\ndeceptive, marks of descent from a single parent.\r\n\r\nAs a record of a former state of things, I have retained in the\r\nforegoing paragraphs, and elsewhere, several sentences which imply that\r\nnaturalists believe in the separate creation of each species; and I\r\nhave been much censured for having thus expressed myself. But\r\nundoubtedly this was the general belief when the first edition of the\r\npresent work appeared. I formerly spoke to very many naturalists on the\r\nsubject of evolution, and never once met with any sympathetic\r\nagreement. It is probable that some did then believe in evolution, but\r\nthey were either silent or expressed themselves so ambiguously that it\r\nwas not easy to understand their meaning. Now, things are wholly\r\nchanged, and almost every naturalist admits the great principle of\r\nevolution. There are, however, some who still think that species have\r\nsuddenly given birth, through quite unexplained means, to new and\r\ntotally different forms. But, as I have attempted to show, weighty\r\nevidence can be opposed to the admission of great and abrupt\r\nmodifications. Under a scientific point of view, and as leading to\r\nfurther investigation, but little advantage is gained by believing that\r\nnew forms are suddenly developed in an inexplicable manner from old and\r\nwidely different forms, over the old belief in the creation of species\r\nfrom the dust of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked how far I extend the doctrine of the modification of\r\nspecies. The question is difficult to answer, because the more distinct\r\nthe forms are which we consider, by so much the arguments in favour of\r\ncommunity of descent become fewer in number and less in force. But some\r\narguments of the greatest weight extend very far. All the members of\r\nwhole classes are connected together by a chain of affinities, and all\r\ncan be classed on the same principle, in groups subordinate to groups.\r\nFossil remains sometimes tend to fill up very wide intervals between\r\nexisting orders.\r\n\r\nOrgans in a rudimentary condition plainly show that an early progenitor\r\nhad the organ in a fully developed condition, and this in some cases\r\nimplies an enormous amount of modification in the descendants.\r\nThroughout whole classes various structures are formed on the same\r\npattern, and at a very early age the embryos closely resemble each\r\nother. Therefore I cannot doubt that the theory of descent with\r\nmodification embraces all the members of the same great class or\r\nkingdom. I believe that animals are descended from at most only four or\r\nfive progenitors, and plants from an equal or lesser number.\r\n\r\nAnalogy would lead me one step further, namely, to the belief that all\r\nanimals and plants are descended from some one prototype. But analogy\r\nmay be a deceitful guide. Nevertheless all living things have much in\r\ncommon, in their chemical composition, their cellular structure, their\r\nlaws of growth, and their liability to injurious influences. We see\r\nthis even in so trifling a fact as that the same poison often similarly\r\naffects plants and animals; or that the poison secreted by the gall-fly\r\nproduces monstrous growths on the wild rose or oak-tree. With all\r\norganic beings, excepting perhaps some of the very lowest, sexual\r\nreproduction seems to be essentially similar. With all, as far as is at\r\npresent known, the germinal vesicle is the same; so that all organisms\r\nstart from a common origin. If we look even to the two main\r\ndivisions—namely, to the animal and vegetable kingdoms—certain low\r\nforms are so far intermediate in character that naturalists have\r\ndisputed to which kingdom they should be referred. As Professor Asa\r\nGray has remarked, “the spores and other reproductive bodies of many of\r\nthe lower algæ may claim to have first a characteristically animal, and\r\nthen an unequivocally vegetable existence.” Therefore, on the principle\r\nof natural selection with divergence of character, it does not seem\r\nincredible that, from some such low and intermediate form, both animals\r\nand plants may have been developed; and, if we admit this, we must\r\nlikewise admit that all the organic beings which have ever lived on\r\nthis earth may be descended from some one primordial form. But this\r\ninference is chiefly grounded on analogy, and it is immaterial whether\r\nor not it be accepted. No doubt it is possible, as Mr. G.H. Lewes has\r\nurged, that at the first commencement of life many different forms were\r\nevolved; but if so, we may conclude that only a very few have left\r\nmodified descendants. For, as I have recently remarked in regard to the\r\nmembers of each great kingdom, such as the Vertebrata, Articulata, &c.,\r\nwe have distinct evidence in their embryological, homologous, and\r\nrudimentary structures, that within each kingdom all the members are\r\ndescended from a single progenitor.\r\n\r\nWhen the views advanced by me in this volume, and by Mr. Wallace or\r\nwhen analogous views on the origin of species are generally admitted,\r\nwe can dimly foresee that there will be a considerable revolution in\r\nnatural history. Systematists will be able to pursue their labours as\r\nat present; but they will not be incessantly haunted by the shadowy\r\ndoubt whether this or that form be a true species. This, I feel sure\r\nand I speak after experience, will be no slight relief. The endless\r\ndisputes whether or not some fifty species of British brambles are good\r\nspecies will cease. Systematists will have only to decide (not that\r\nthis will be easy) whether any form be sufficiently constant and\r\ndistinct from other forms, to be capable of definition; and if\r\ndefinable, whether the differences be sufficiently important to deserve\r\na specific name. This latter point will become a far more essential\r\nconsideration than it is at present; for differences, however slight,\r\nbetween any two forms, if not blended by intermediate gradations, are\r\nlooked at by most naturalists as sufficient to raise both forms to the\r\nrank of species.\r\n\r\nHereafter we shall be compelled to acknowledge that the only\r\ndistinction between species and well-marked varieties is, that the\r\nlatter are known, or believed to be connected at the present day by\r\nintermediate gradations, whereas species were formerly thus connected.\r\nHence, without rejecting the consideration of the present existence of\r\nintermediate gradations between any two forms, we shall be led to weigh\r\nmore carefully and to value higher the actual amount of difference\r\nbetween them. It is quite possible that forms now generally\r\nacknowledged to be merely varieties may hereafter be thought worthy of\r\nspecific names; and in this case scientific and common language will\r\ncome into accordance. In short, we shall have to treat species in the\r\nsame manner as those naturalists treat genera, who admit that genera\r\nare merely artificial combinations made for convenience. This may not\r\nbe a cheering prospect; but we shall at least be freed from the vain\r\nsearch for the undiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe other and more general departments of natural history will rise\r\ngreatly in interest. The terms used by naturalists, of affinity,\r\nrelationship, community of type, paternity, morphology, adaptive\r\ncharacters, rudimentary and aborted organs, &c., will cease to be\r\nmetaphorical and will have a plain signification. When we no longer\r\nlook at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as something\r\nwholly beyond his comprehension; when we regard every production of\r\nnature as one which has had a long history; when we contemplate every\r\ncomplex structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances,\r\neach useful to the possessor, in the same way as any great mechanical\r\ninvention is the summing up of the labour, the experience, the reason,\r\nand even the blunders of numerous workmen; when we thus view each\r\norganic being, how far more interesting—I speak from experience—does\r\nthe study of natural history become!\r\n\r\nA grand and almost untrodden field of inquiry will be opened, on the\r\ncauses and laws of variation, on correlation, on the effects of use and\r\ndisuse, on the direct action of external conditions, and so forth. The\r\nstudy of domestic productions will rise immensely in value. A new\r\nvariety raised by man will be a far more important and interesting\r\nsubject for study than one more species added to the infinitude of\r\nalready recorded species. Our classifications will come to be, as far\r\nas they can be so made, genealogies; and will then truly give what may\r\nbe called the plan of creation. The rules for classifying will no doubt\r\nbecome simpler when we have a definite object in view. We possess no\r\npedigree or armorial bearings; and we have to discover and trace the\r\nmany diverging lines of descent in our natural genealogies, by\r\ncharacters of any kind which have long been inherited. Rudimentary\r\norgans will speak infallibly with respect to the nature of long-lost\r\nstructures. Species and groups of species which are called aberrant,\r\nand which may fancifully be called living fossils, will aid us in\r\nforming a picture of the ancient forms of life. Embryology will often\r\nreveal to us the structure, in some degree obscured, of the prototypes\r\nof each great class.\r\n\r\nWhen we can feel assured that all the individuals of the same species,\r\nand all the closely allied species of most genera, have, within a not\r\nvery remote period descended from one parent, and have migrated from\r\nsome one birth-place; and when we better know the many means of\r\nmigration, then, by the light which geology now throws, and will\r\ncontinue to throw, on former changes of climate and of the level of the\r\nland, we shall surely be enabled to trace in an admirable manner the\r\nformer migrations of the inhabitants of the whole world. Even at\r\npresent, by comparing the differences between the inhabitants of the\r\nsea on the opposite sides of a continent, and the nature of the various\r\ninhabitants of that continent in relation to their apparent means of\r\nimmigration, some light can be thrown on ancient geography.\r\n\r\nThe noble science of geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection\r\nof the record. The crust of the earth, with its embedded remains, must\r\nnot be looked at as a well-filled museum, but as a poor collection made\r\nat hazard and at rare intervals. The accumulation of each great\r\nfossiliferous formation will be recognised as having depended on an\r\nunusual occurrence of favourable circumstances, and the blank intervals\r\nbetween the successive stages as having been of vast duration. But we\r\nshall be able to gauge with some security the duration of these\r\nintervals by a comparison of the preceding and succeeding organic\r\nforms. We must be cautious in attempting to correlate as strictly\r\ncontemporaneous two formations, which do not include many identical\r\nspecies, by the general succession of the forms of life. As species are\r\nproduced and exterminated by slowly acting and still existing causes,\r\nand not by miraculous acts of creation; and as the most important of\r\nall causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of\r\naltered and perhaps suddenly altered physical conditions, namely, the\r\nmutual relation of organism to organism—the improvement of one organism\r\nentailing the improvement or the extermination of others; it follows,\r\nthat the amount of organic change in the fossils of consecutive\r\nformations probably serves as a fair measure of the relative, though\r\nnot actual lapse of time. A number of species, however, keeping in a\r\nbody might remain for a long period unchanged, whilst within the same\r\nperiod, several of these species, by migrating into new countries and\r\ncoming into competition with foreign associates, might become modified;\r\nso that we must not overrate the accuracy of organic change as a\r\nmeasure of time.\r\n\r\nIn the future I see open fields for far more important researches.\r\nPsychology will be securely based on the foundation already well laid\r\nby Mr. Herbert Spencer, that of the necessary acquirement of each\r\nmental power and capacity by gradation. Much light will be thrown on\r\nthe origin of man and his history.\r\n\r\nAuthors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the\r\nview that each species has been independently created. To my mind it\r\naccords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the\r\nCreator, that the production and extinction of the past and present\r\ninhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes, like\r\nthose determining the birth and death of the individual. When I view\r\nall beings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of\r\nsome few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Cambrian\r\nsystem was deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled. Judging from\r\nthe past, we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit\r\nits unaltered likeness to a distinct futurity. And of the species now\r\nliving very few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant\r\nfuturity; for the manner in which all organic beings are grouped, shows\r\nthat the greater number of species in each genus, and all the species\r\nin many genera, have left no descendants, but have become utterly\r\nextinct. We can so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to\r\nforetell that it will be the common and widely spread species,\r\nbelonging to the larger and dominant groups within each class, which\r\nwill ultimately prevail and procreate new and dominant species. As all\r\nthe living forms of life are the lineal descendants of those which\r\nlived long before the Cambrian epoch, we may feel certain that the\r\nordinary succession by generation has never once been broken, and that\r\nno cataclysm has desolated the whole world. Hence, we may look with\r\nsome confidence to a secure future of great length. And as natural\r\nselection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal\r\nand mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to contemplate a tangled bank, clothed with many\r\nplants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various\r\ninsects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth,\r\nand to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different\r\nfrom each other, and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner,\r\nhave all been produced by laws acting around us. These laws, taken in\r\nthe largest sense, being Growth with reproduction; Inheritance which is\r\nalmost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and\r\ndirect action of the conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a\r\nRatio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a\r\nconsequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and\r\nthe Extinction of less improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature,\r\nfrom famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of\r\nconceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly\r\nfollows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several\r\npowers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms\r\nor into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on\r\naccording to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning\r\nendless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are\r\nbeing evolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY OF THE PRINCIPAL SCIENTIFIC TERMS USED IN THE PRESENT VOLUME.*\r\n\r\n\r\n   * I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. W.S. Dallas for this\r\n   Glossary, which has been given because several readers have\r\n   complained to me that some of the terms used were unintelligible to\r\n   them. Mr. Dallas has endeavoured to give the explanations of the\r\n   terms in as popular a form as possible.\r\n\r\nABERRANT.—Forms or groups of animals or plants which deviate in\r\nimportant characters from their nearest allies, so as not to be easily\r\nincluded in the same group with them, are said to be aberrant.\r\n\r\nABERRATION (in Optics).—In the refraction of light by a convex lens the\r\nrays passing through different parts of the lens are brought to a focus\r\nat slightly different distances—this is called _spherical aberration;_\r\nat the same time the coloured rays are separated by the prismatic\r\naction of the lens and likewise brought to a focus at different\r\ndistances—this is _chromatic aberration_.\r\n\r\nABNORMAL.—Contrary to the general rule.\r\n\r\nABORTED.—An organ is said to be aborted, when its development has been\r\narrested at a very early stage.\r\n\r\nALBINISM.—Albinos are animals in which the usual colouring matters\r\ncharacteristic of the species have not been produced in the skin and\r\nits appendages. Albinism is the state of being an albino.\r\n\r\nALGÆ.—A class of plants including the ordinary sea-weeds and the\r\nfilamentous fresh-water weeds.\r\n\r\nALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS.—This term is applied to a peculiar mode of\r\nreproduction which prevails among many of the lower animals, in which\r\nthe egg produces a living form quite different from its parent, but\r\nfrom which the parent-form is reproduced by a process of budding, or by\r\nthe division of the substance of the first product of the egg.\r\n\r\nAMMONITES.—A group of fossil, spiral, chambered shells, allied to the\r\nexisting pearly Nautilus, but having the partitions between the\r\nchambers waved in complicated patterns at their junction with the outer\r\nwall of the shell.\r\n\r\nANALOGY.—That resemblance of structures which depends upon similarity\r\nof function, as in the wings of insects and birds. Such structures are\r\nsaid to be _analogous_, and to be _analogues_ of each other.\r\n\r\nANIMALCULE.—A minute animal: generally applied to those visible only by\r\nthe microscope.\r\n\r\nANNELIDS.—A class of worms in which the surface of the body exhibits a\r\nmore or less distinct division into rings or segments, generally\r\nprovided with appendages for locomotion and with gills. It includes the\r\nordinary marine worms, the earth-worms, and the leeches.\r\n\r\nANTENNÆ.—Jointed organs appended to the head in Insects, Crustacea and\r\nCentipedes, and not belonging to the mouth.\r\n\r\nANTHERS.—The summits of the stamens of flowers, in which the pollen or\r\nfertilising dust is produced.\r\n\r\nAPLACENTALIA, APLACENTATA or Aplacental Mammals.—See _mammalia_.\r\n\r\nARCHETYPAL.—Of or belonging to the Archetype, or ideal primitive form\r\nupon which all the beings of a group seem to be organised.\r\n\r\nARTICULATA.—A great division of the Animal Kingdom characterised\r\ngenerally by having the surface of the body divided into rings called\r\nsegments, a greater or less number of which are furnished with jointed\r\nlegs (such as Insects, Crustaceans and Centipedes).\r\n\r\nASYMMETRICAL.—Having the two sides unlike.\r\n\r\nATROPHIED.—Arrested in development at a very early stage.\r\n\r\nBALANUS.—The genus including the common Acorn-shells which live in\r\nabundance on the rocks of the sea-coast.\r\n\r\nBATRACHIANS.—A class of animals allied to the Reptiles, but undergoing\r\na peculiar metamorphosis, in which the young animal is generally\r\naquatic and breathes by gills. (_Examples_, Frogs, Toads, and Newts.)\r\n\r\nBOULDERS.—Large transported blocks of stone generally embedded in clays\r\nor gravels.\r\n\r\nBRACHIOPODA.—A class of marine Mollusca, or soft-bodied animals,\r\nfurnished with a bivalve shell, attached to submarine objects by a\r\nstalk which passes through an aperture in one of the valves, and\r\nfurnished with fringed arms, by the action of which food is carried to\r\nthe mouth.\r\n\r\nBRANCHIÆ.—Gills or organs for respiration in water.\r\n\r\nBRANCHIAL.—Pertaining to gills or branchiæ.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIAN SYSTEM.—A series of very ancient Palæozoic rocks, between the\r\nLaurentian and the Silurian.

(_Examples_, Crab, Lobster,\r\nShrimp, &c.)\r\n\r\nCURCULIO.—The old generic term for the Beetles known as Weevils,\r\ncharacterised by their four-jointed feet, and by the head being\r\nproduced into a sort of beak, upon the sides of which the antennæ are\r\ninserted.\r\n\r\nCUTANEOUS.—Of or belonging to the skin.\r\n\r\nDEGRADATION.—The wearing down of land by the action of the sea or of\r\nmeteoric agencies.\r\n\r\nDENUDATION.—The wearing away of the surface of the land by water.\r\n\r\nDEVONIAN SYSTEM or FORMATION.—A series of Palæozoic rocks, including\r\nthe Old Red Sandstone.\r\n\r\nDICOTYLEDONS, or DICOTYLEDONOUS PLANTS.—A class of plants characterised\r\nby having two seed-leaves, by the formation of new wood between the\r\nbark and the old wood (exogenous growth) and by the reticulation of the\r\nveins of the leaves. The parts of the flowers are generally in\r\nmultiples of five.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENTATION.—The separation or discrimination of parts or organs\r\nwhich in simpler forms of life are more or less united.\r\n\r\nDIMORPHIC.—Having two distinct forms.—DIMORPHISM is the condition of\r\nthe appearance of the same species under two dissimilar forms.\r\n\r\nDIOECIOUS.—Having the organs of the sexes upon distinct individuals.\r\n\r\nDIORITE.—A peculiar form of Greenstone.\r\n\r\nDORSAL.—Of or belonging to the back.\r\n\r\nEDENTATA.—A peculiar order of Quadrupeds, characterised by the absence\r\nof at least the middle incisor (front) teeth in both jaws.

It is believed that glacial periods have\r\noccurred repeatedly during the geological history of the earth, but the\r\nterm is generally applied to the close of the Tertiary epoch, when\r\nnearly the whole of Europe was subjected to an arctic climate.\r\n\r\nGLAND.—An organ which secretes or separates some peculiar product from\r\nthe blood or sap of animals or plants.\r\n\r\nGLOTTIS.—The opening of the windpipe into the œsophagus or gullet.\r\n\r\nGNEISS.—A rock approaching granite in composition, but more or less\r\nlaminated, and really produced by the alteration of a sedimentary\r\ndeposit after its consolidation.\r\n\r\nGRALLATORES.—The so-called wading-birds (storks, cranes, snipes, &c.),\r\nwhich are generally furnished with long legs, bare of feathers above\r\nthe heel, and have no membranes between the toes.\r\n\r\nGRANITE.—A rock consisting essentially of crystals of felspar and mica\r\nin a mass of quartz.\r\n\r\nHABITAT.—The locality in which a plant or animal naturally lives.\r\n\r\nHEMIPTERA.—An order or sub-order of insects, characterised by the\r\npossession of a jointed beak or rostrum, and by having the fore-wings\r\nhorny in the basal portion and membranous at the extremity, where they\r\ncross each other. This group includes the various species of bugs.\r\n\r\nHERMAPHRODITE.—Possessing the organs of both sexes.\r\n\r\nHOMOLOGY.—That relation between parts which results from their\r\ndevelopment from corresponding embryonic parts, either in different\r\nanimals, as in the case of the arm of man, the fore-leg of a quadruped,\r\nand the wing of a bird; or in the same individual, as in the case of\r\nthe fore and hind legs in quadrupeds, and the segments or rings and\r\ntheir appendages of which the body of a worm, a centipede, &c., is\r\ncomposed. The latter is called _serial homology_. The parts which stand\r\nin such a relation to each other are said to be _homologous_, and one\r\nsuch part or organ is called the _homologue_ of the other. In different\r\nplants the parts of the flower are homologous, and in general these\r\nparts are regarded as homologous with leaves.\r\n\r\nHOMOPTERA.—An order or sub-order of insects having (like the Hemiptera)\r\na jointed beak, but in which the fore-wings are either wholly\r\nmembranous or wholly leathery, The _Cicadæ_, frog-hoppers, and\r\n_Aphides_, are well-known examples.\r\n\r\nHYBRID.—The offspring of the union of two distinct species.\r\n\r\nHYMENOPTERA.—An order of insects possessing biting jaws and usually\r\nfour membranous wings in which there are a few veins.

A striking difference in\r\nembryonic development has led to the division of this class into two\r\ngreat groups; in one of these, when the embryo has attained a certain\r\nstage, a vascular connection, called the _placenta_, is formed between\r\nthe embryo and the mother; in the other this is wanting, and the young\r\nare produced in a very incomplete state. The former, including the\r\ngreater part of the class, are called _Placental Mammals;_ the latter,\r\nor _Aplacental Mammals_, include the Marsupials and Monotremes\r\n(_Ornithorhynchus_).\r\n\r\nMAMMIFEROUS.—Having mammæ or teats (see MAMMALIA).\r\n\r\nMANDIBLES.—in insects, the first or uppermost pair of jaws, which are\r\ngenerally solid, horny, biting organs.
